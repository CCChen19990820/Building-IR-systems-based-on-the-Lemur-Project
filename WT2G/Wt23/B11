Subject: Pipe purchase

Dear Steve,

Hi there! Would you be kind enough to advise me on the purchase of a pipe?

For the past several years, I have smoked a filtered Medico pipe. I would
like to place my faithful pipe aside and purchase a good filterless pipe. I
honestly considered a Dunhill, but the bottomline price was above what I was
willing to invest in my first real pipe purchase. Prehaps for Christmas, but
not as my 35th birthday gift.
 
Yesterday, I visited the Connoisseur Pipe Shop here in New York City (1285
Avenue of the Americas). I spoke at great length with Ed Burak, the shop
owner. I explained about my lack of knowledge as well as my lack of pipes. I
am currently smoking a "straight" pipe. Ed quickly showed me a pipe with just
a slight bend in it. He said it was all briar and all made in his shop. The
cost $125.00. Now I must honestly tell you that I have no problem paying
$125.00 for a pipe which will last for years to come.

My questions are simple:

1. Have you ever heard anything about the quality of pipes produced by this
shop?

2. Due to my lack of knowledge (limited to reading the Pipe Digest, The
Ultimate Pipe Book by Hacker and based upon my limited experience), I called
the Connoisseur Pipe Shop this morning. I asked Ed if I would be permitted to
place the pipe in my mouth. He flatly said NO due to "my safety and that of
his other customers". I told him that I wanted to see how it felt. His
response was "Would I make a bit that was not comfortable?" Is it common not
to allow a customer the option of seeing how a pipe feels prior to it's
purchase? He barely allowed me to hold it and look at it. I honestly wonder
if I'm in the wrong place. After all, I fell in love with the pipe, but I
really have not looked at other pipes in the same shop. Should I take his
advise and purchase a slightly bent pipe as my first "real" pipe?
He did sell me some very good tobak called Scottish Ribbon.

Steve, can you please advise me before this Friday (the date of the intended
purchase).

Thank you!!

[ I own two Connoisseur pipes; they're both good values.  Re holding
the pipe in your mouth, it's not something that any shopkeeper would
likely have let you do, for sanitary reasons and also because you
could have gotten tooth marks in the stem. -S. ]

Subject: building a humidor

Dear Digestees,

I need some help with humidor plans.  I am building a poolhouse, the
upstairs of which will be my "smoking room", flytying room, etc.  I want to
build a chest type or walk-in closet type humidor that might hold 2-3
thousand cigars.  My builder is an excellent cabinetmaker, but he is a
little daunted by the prospect of building this beast.  Does anybody have
any plans or any suggestions about this?  Any advice either commercial in
nature or not, will be welcome by e-mail to ???????@????.???.

Thanks in advance!

Subject: L'art de Fumer la pipe (Part 2)

Steve,

In Digest #190, I translated 7 rules for the pipe smoker from a brochure I
picked up in a French pipe shop.  The brochure is by Ch. CORRIEU.  Here is
the rest of the brochure with, what I hope, is an accurate translation.
 Again, I am NOT a French-language scholar and I will have omitted the
different accent markings over certain words.  I do not wish to offend.  :)

Le fumeur de pipe se distingue des autres par son caractere et sa
personnalite.  Il a confiance en lui; il sait reflechir, se concentrer, il
possede surtout la faculte de prendre le temps de vivre et de savourer des
instants de tranquillite que la plupart des hommes ne connaissent pas.
(The pipe smoker differs from other men by his character and personality.  He
is self-confidant, he is able to think and concentrate; also he is able to
take time for life and to enjoy quiet moments that most people do not
experience.)

Le  vrai fumeur de pipe est exigeant sur la qualite de la bruyere.  Il
choisit sa pipe avec soin, en tenant compte de la vieillesse de la bruyere,
de la legerete de la pipe et de la veine du bois.
(The true pipe-smoker is difficult to please where the quality of the briar
is concerned.  He chooses his pipe carefully and considers the age of the
briar, the lightness of the pipe, and the grain of the wood.)

C'est en pensant aux veritables connaisseurs que les "CORRIEU", depuis
plusieurs generations, selectionnent minutieusement et laissent secher
pendant des annees les meilleures bruyeres qu'ils recoltent dans le Massif
des Maures.
(This is for true connoisseurs, that "Corrieu" has been carefully selecting
and drying for years, for several generations, the best briars of the
"Maures" mountains.)

Here is the address given:
Ch. CORRIEU
Fabricant des Pipes de Cogolin
58, av Clemenceau 83310 Cogolin France
I have no connection whatsoever with this company.  I do own several of their
pipes and smoke them regularly.

Subject: Steve Weiner: Pipemaker (fwd)

Steve, one of the ideas I had for the Ohio Pipe Collectors newsletter was
a series of pipemaker profiles, starting of course with Ohio pipemakers. 
This is the first in that series, which I would like to share with your
readers if you can print it.
                           STEVE WEINER
The Artisan
	Steve Weiner, Ohio pipemaker, lives in Olmstead Falls, Ohio (a
suburb of Cleveland), with his wife, Bonnie.  Their daughter graduated
from Ohio University a year ago.  Steve is president of his own utility
bill consulting business, which performs electric, gas and local telephone
billing audits and verifications for such clients as businesses and
schools.  He carves pipes in his basement workshop in the time remaining.
	After smoking cigarettes for many years, Steve decided to
experiment with pipes in 1979, mostly, as he says, "out of curiosity. 
Pipe smoking quickly turned into pipe collecting, and I was hooked on the
hobby."  Then, in 1989, Steve's 89-year-old grandfather, a pattern maker
by trade, died and left Steve the contents of his workshop: a drill press,
two motors, hand files and countless drill bits and other odds and ends. 
Steve had previously toyed with the idea of crafting a pipe, but this
legacy helped him make up his mind.  He built a workbench, set up a shop
and began producing pipes--"or at least what I called pipes.  They
certainly didn't look like the Ascorti, Jacapo and Butera pipes I had been
smoking, but I kept at it, and after a while they started to look like
something."
	In the summer of 1990, Steve got a "real break"--a visit with Mike
Butera in his Houston shop.  As Steve says, "During one long Saturday, I
learned more about pipemaking than I had in the entire previous year. 
When I got back home, I applied what I learned from Mike and, with some
practice, began getting results that actually surprised me."  Steve
attended his first PCCA show as a pipemaker in 1991.  He was honored as
best Pipemaker at the 1991 and 1994 C.O.R.P.S. shows in Richmond, VA and
received an award of merit at the 1993 PCCA show in Washington, D.C.
	When I asked Steve what ideal, in terms of craftsmanship and
smoking qualities, he strives for, he answered that, in his opinion, "the
best pipes being made today are those by Mike Butera.  This is the
standard to which I compare my pipes.  I have yet to meet it, but I will
keep trying.
	I remarked to Steve that, as with every craftsman/artist, times
must occur when he rises above the workmanlike job of producing a good,
aesthetically pleasing product of which he can be proud and becomes
inspired.  What, I asked, causes such moments of inspiration?  "Luck," he
replied.  "What inspires me is an exceptionally nice piece of wood.  When
I come across a nicely grained, flawless piece of wood, I tend to increase
my effort to make the perfect pipe."
	Steve doesn't have one favorite tobacco but enjoys latakia blends
and is currently smoking a matured Virginia from John B. Hayes called
Tom's Red &amp; Black.
The Pipes
	Steve Weiner makes his pipes from plateau briar and Italian
lucite stems.  The dot he puts in the stem is also briar, and his stem
inlays are briar or lucite.  He stamps each pipe with his name and
"U.S.A.," and he numbers and dates each one.  For example, the pipe
stamped "00594" is the fifth pipe he finished in 1994.
	Steve subjects his pipes to a two-step treatment process, the
first to remove any excess resin from the wood and the second to coat the
inside of the bowl with his special carbonizing formula to ease the
break-in process and protect the wood.
	Steve hand shapes every pipe, using sanding disks, hand files
and sandpaper.  He turns the tenons on a small lathe and then buffs
them for an exact fit.  He hand sands his smooth pipes to 320 grit and
then buffs, stains and waxes them.  He hand carves his rough-finished
pipes.
	Because Steve was a dedicated pipe smoker long before he started
making pipes, he has definite ideas about what is needed to make a
satisfying smoke:
*	He tapers his tobacco holes but not so severely that a tamper will
	not fit into the bottom of the bowl.
*	His air holes are relatively large to make for an easy draw.
*	He constructs each pipe so that you can slide a pipe cleaner all
	the way to the bottom of the bowl without removing the stem.
*	He slightly rounds the lip so it is not uncomfortable to the tongue.
	Steve's production varies with the time he can spend on his craft.
 For 1993 and 1994, he averaged 116 pipes.  He has no philosophical
objections to sandblasted pipes, but, because of space and expense
considerations, he has not invested in sandblasting equipment.  Therefore,
when a briar block will not yield a smooth piece, he carves it.  About 80%
of his pipes are carved, and virtually all of his pipes are standard
shapes or variations thereof.  His retail prices start at $140 for a basic
carved piece but can go up to $400 to $500 for smooth pieces with
exceptional size and grain.  Steve sells many of his pipes through Barclay
Pipe &amp; Tobacco in Columbus, but he has also placed pipes in shops in
Akron, Chagrin Falls, Cleveland and San Francisco and in Virginia and
North and South Carolina.

Steve Weiner--artisan, OPC member, and all-around good guy--can be
contacted at 6683 Laurel Lane, Olmstead Falls, Ohio 44138 or call (216)
235-9338.  Steve has rented a table at the September 23 OPC show and will
be there to display, talk about and sell his pipes.  And he has also
promised to donate one of them to the raffle.
	--Bill Unger (reprinted from the May Ohio Pipe Collectors newsletter)

 If you've got one pipe, you're a pipesmoker.  If you've got more than one,
 you're a pipe collector.

Subject: Re: #3(3) Pipes Digest #190 -...

I wanted to thank you for sending me Pipes Digest, reading them has been a
lot of fun.  I've only briefly flirted with pipes, cigars have been my main
source of tobacco enjoyment.  I started out with mild panatelas and coronas
but lately have been enjoying thicker ring gauge robustos, etc..  Currently
my mild mainstay is a Macanudo Hyde Park (5 1/2 x 49) but for true bliss I
love Romeo y Julieta Vintage cigars.  I'd be interested to hear what cigars
your readers were enjoying.  I'm a little frustrated with all the cuban cigar
reviews in C.A.  But I suppose it's just a U.S. problem due to our
chickenshit trade embargo.  My wife's brother in law is a Spaniard and says
that the Cuban smokes available in Spain are inconsistent in quality at best.
 I'd be interested to hear what our friend in Barcelona thinks about that.  

That's all for now.  Happy Smoking!

Smoke Signal #16
?????@???.???.???

One day during a visit to England this month, I stopped for lunch, in the
ancient town of Tewkesbury. On my way back to the car, I passed a bookshop
dealing in used books and was inexorably drawn into its dusty interior. It was
there that I came across a portfolio of papers that I discovered once belonged
to Dr. John H. Watson, M. D. Unaware of the nature of these papers, the
proprietor of the shop sold them to me in return for a five-pound note.

&gt;From this portfolio I have cobbled together the short story that
follows in the file attachment. A story that I believe will be of
interest to many of the subscribers to the Internet Pipes Digest. It
is for your enjoyment and may not be used for any commercial
purpose. I reserve the right to retain the copyright and be named as

to put forth those cases that have provided ample exercise for
my friend's extraordinary deductive powers. In course of events,
not all problems brought to Holmes' notice needed him to strain
every sinew in the sifting and weighing of facts. And so it is
with the problem of the pipe- smoking woman. It hardly taxed
Holmes as a criminal expert, but it did draw upon his store of
arcane knowledge, a knowledge that allowed him to cut off one
arm of an ungodly, depraved, and wicked trade, the mere thought
of which still sickens me, even I who have been privileged to
see so much of the world.
     London had been enjoying something of an Indian summer that year
and it was towards the end of this period that Holmes and I were
in our rooms sitting either side of a cheerful fire, one of the
first to take the chill off the evening. We had partaken of a
hearty dinner and were at our ease digesting, helped by a noble
brandy and a couple of fine cigars, when the final post of the
day brought a letter for Holmes.
     "It is from my brother Mycroft," said Holmes.
     "He has something of interest for you, no doubt?"
     "No doubt, Watson," said Holmes, tossing the envelope across to
me.
     My first acquaintance with Holmes' brother was in the not
altogether successful 'Adventure of the Greek Interpreter.' Then
as now Mycroft Holmes was the provenance of our case. His letter
read thus:

     "Will you dine with me tomorrow at the club? I have something
out of the ordinary for you."

     "You will come too, I hope," said Holmes as I passed him the
letter.
     "I have nothing doing tomorrow and should be delighted to wait
upon you."
     "Excellent, Watson, we must be there at Noon precisely. The
Diogenes Club is most particular to have its luncheon with the
sun at its zenith."

     Next day, just short of the Noon hour, Holmes and I were walking
down Pall Mall from the St. James end towards The Carlton and
the unassuming door that was the entrance to the Diogenes Club.
As usual we entered mumchance and were shown past the glass
panelling to the strangers room where we found Mycroft Holmes
larger, more corpulent than I remembered. He was sitting at a
table containing covered dishes, in the bow-window overlooking
the street.
     "Ah! Sherlock, how good of you to come," said Mycroft, "I
received your note. I hope you walked up an appetite. Here there
are some cutlets that should dull its edge. Please be seated."
     Holmes and I sat down and a servant removed the covers of the
dishes and helped us to our lunch.
     "You are beginning to find the weather disagreeable Doctor,"
said Mycroft, taking me by surprise.
     "Why, yes I am finding the first chills of winter uncomfortable,
but how can you know?"
     Mycroft smiled, "From your chronicles I collect that you were
wounded in Afganistan. I saw you and Sherlock walking down the
street and I noticed you limping more than when last we met. My
inference is that the chilly nights are making themselves felt."
     "Well, it's true," said I with a laugh.
     "Watson is an interesting study, I know, but Mycroft, your
letter indicated that you had something of interest to me," said
Holmes in some impatience.
     "Yes, Sherlock, it may be nothing, but it is curious," said
Mycroft as he tucked into his cutlets and mashed potatoes.
     Holmes leant back in his chair and touched together the
finger-tips of each hand, rested his elbows on the arms of the
chair, and put his two index fingers just under his lower lip.
It was an attitude I knew well. He left his food uneaten and
listened to Mycroft who went on with his story between
mouthfuls. . . .
     "A fellow lodger in my building is Admiral William Babbington of
the Admiralty. He is a zealous officer who once sailed with
Lucky Jack Aubrey.  He is also known for having an eye for the
ladies."
     Holmes remained unmoved and had assumed that familiar,
heavy-lidded expression of eye indicating deep concentration.
     "Each day," Mycroft continued, "Admiral Babbington lunches at
Black's, his club. He is an officer of an older Navy and likes
his lunch at two o'clock. It is his custom to spend the
preprandial hour between one and two in the reading room at
Black's drinking gin and bitters, while seated in the window
overlooking the street and Button's club opposite; a vantage
point from which he can admire the skirts passing to and fro
below."
     Holmes sat perfectly still.
     "About a week ago Admiral Babbington was on watch as usual and,
getting ready to go to table, raised his glass to his lips,
cocking back his head to drain his drink. In so doing he
happened to glance across the street and saw a handsome woman
sitting at a garret window in the building next door to
Button's."
     "My dear Mycroft, there is nothing unusual about that," said
Holmes in a bored drawl.  "Next door to Button's is Mother
Abbott's, a notorious bawdy house for the wealthy rakes that
belong to Button's and other hot-blooded young men about town.
There are sure to be handsome young women sitting in the windows
of the top floors. Is that not where they live when not on duty?"
     "Yes, indeed. However, what struck the Admiral as odd is that
the young woman in question was smoking a pipe."
     "Well, well, there is nothing too odd about that either, these
days."
     "No, but the Admiral said that she smoked like a pirate and did
the same every day this past week, more so since the young woman
has detected Babbington's interest in her."
     "Ha! Is that so," said Holmes leaning forward in his chair.
     "I thought you would see the possibilities," said Mycroft,
wiping his mouth on his napkin. "What is more, if you present
yourself at Black's today you will find the Admiral ready to
receive you between one and two o'clock. There are fifteen
minutes wanting before one. I will leave you to make your own
way there as I have some reading to do next door in one of those
supportive armchairs."
     Holmes gave a quick smile and said: "Come, Watson, let us see
this pipe-smoking woman for ourselves."
     We left Mycroft sunk in a deep leather armchair with the Times
over his face and made our way to Black's club. As we walked
along the pavement Holmes chuckled to himself.
     "Well, Watson, what do you think of this case of the
pipe-smoking woman?"
     "As you said, Holmes, a woman who smokes a pipe, while not
common, is not all that unusual, and I would not be surprised at
the activity amongst the employees of a place such as Mother
Abbott's. What does surprise me is that Admiral Babbington
should have noticed such a person."
     "That the Admiral should notice a woman does not surprise me in
the least," said Holmes. "In his day he was notorious for his
amours. That he should have noticed a woman in a garret window
is sheer luck, since his attention was focussed in the street
below. Few people, Watson, see much above fifteen degrees from
the horizontal. It was only the chance of his tossing off a
drink coupled with his roving eye, sensitised as it is from a
lifetime of admiration for the female form, that led him to
notice the woman in the first place. He noticed her and her
voracious habit of pipe.  It is a fortuitous combination of
events that leads us to Black's and the possibility of an
instructive half-hour."
     As Holmes finished his didactic speech we came to the steps of
Black's and went up into the foyer of the club. Holmes gave his
card to the attendant and asked after Admiral Babbington.  Soon
a pageboy appeared and took us up to the reading-room on the
first floor front. We crossed the room and were met by a small,
ruddy complected man of weather beaten aspect.  Admiral
Babbington appeared to be well into his seventh decade of life.
     "Ah! Mr. Holmes," he said addressing my tall, lean companion.
"How good of you to come. It may be just one of the whores
enjoying her baccy, but it struck me as such a queer thing that
I mentioned it to your brother, who is my neighbour, and he
thought you might be interested in her as a curiosity. He said
that you take interest in the smallest details."
     "It is the details that count, Admiral," said Holmes. "This is
my friend and collegue Dr.  Watson."
     "Pleased to know you Sir," said the Admiral, his sea-going voice
coming strong from his aging body. His handshake could still
crack walnuts. I observed that when younger he was a man of
barrel-chest, active and vigorous. Although in age his pot-belly
was now larger than his chest.  The Admiral ushered us to the
chairs drawn close to the window overlooking the street. Below,
the population of London ebbed and flowed, bustled and jostled.
     "Will you join me in a tot. The sun's over the yardarm and I
like to whet my appetite."
     The steward brought Holmes and me a decanter of brandy and a
gasogene.  When we were settled with our drinks, the Admiral
raised his glass.
     "Gentlemen, the Queen. God bless her."
     "The Queen," said Holmes and I, standing.
     Remaining seated, the Admiral noticed my look of surprise.
     "In the navy we have a dispensation to take the Loyal Toast
seated; saves broken heads you know, the deckheads being so low.
     "With luck our woman with the pipe should be at her station,"
the Admiral continued and looked up towards the garret rooms of
Mother Abbott's across the street.
     "Yes, there she is. By Jove, what a charming face."
     Admiral Babbington moved out of his chair to make room for
Holmes. I knelt down beside his chair and, looking over his
shoulder, saw in the distance a fine featured woman with a mass
of blond hair about her head. She was sitting in one of the
garret windows smoking a short clay pipe of the type known as a
cutty. Catching sight of us, she increased her rate of smoking
to the point where it appeared positively rhythmical. Holmes
watched for several minutes in silence and then stiffened into a
quivering bodily excitement typical of him when his mental
faculties are stimulated to fever pitch. A demeanour
unnoticeable to those unacquainted with Holmes, but of deep
meaning to me as I know him so well.
     "You will not mind me smoking, Admiral?" Said Holmes.
     "Of course not, Sir, by all means light your pipe. There is
nothing like a pipe to calm a man's nerves; swear by it, that
and Bosun's grog."
     Holmes pulled a battered briar from his pocket, one with a most
capacious bowl, and filled it with his fulsome, extra strong
shag tobacco. Soon he was puffing away with such passionate fury
that the Admiral and I fell back to a safe distance from the
cloud of blue smoke.
     "By Heavens, Doctor! Mr. Holmes is more of a smoker than that
unusual woman. Is he always so?"
     I had always known Holmes as a voracious smoker, particularly
when working out a knotty problem. Three pipes an hour was quite
usual, but never have I seen him smoke with such singular
intensity of purpose. The Admiral and I retired to the other
side of the room and watched Holmes smoke three pipes in thirty
minutes. He sat in the window gazing up at the woman in the
garret, pausing in his rythmical puffing from time to time to
lean back in his chair and gaze up across the street.
     "Do ye think he has taken a fancy to her?" Said the Admiral.
     "Well, there certainly seems to be a meeting of minds," said I,
"but I have never known Holmes to take anything other than a
strictly professional interest in the sex. His pleasure is
derived solely from intellectual stimulation."
     "But a quite charming figurehead, don't ye think Doctor?"
     I could do nothing but agree with the Admiral, for the woman
appeared to be of some beauty even from a distance. After forty
minutes of vigorous smoking, Holmes knocked out the ash from his
pipe, rose from his chair and walked across the room to us.
     "This is more serious than I thought, Watson. Admiral, where is
the nearest point from here that one could get passage down the
Thames?"
     "Why, Mr. Holmes, I should think on the South side of Lambeth
bridge.  There is a pier at which you could board a cutter."
     "Thank you. I may need your help later today. May I prevail upon
your naval experience?"
     "Of course, Sir, I should be proud to be associated with you."
     "Capital! In that case, Admiral, allow me to ask if you have
ships at your command in the estuary of the Thames?"
     "Why yes, Sir, there is the gunboat Vengence anchored at the
Nore. Her captain, James Croaker, dined with me yesterday. He
was a squeaker with me years ago when I was first made post. We
can signal him by sending a despatch from here to Sheerness."
     "Come, Watson, there is no time to be lost. I will send a
special messenger with instructions later, Admiral. Until then,
good day to you Sir. A most instructive hour. Thank you for
bringing this curiosity to my attention."
     As we left Black's, Holmes paused on the steps and scrutinised
Mother Abbott's and Button's club across the street. Moving on,
he was silent as we walked. I could see that he was thinking
deeply and, not willing to break in upon his train of thought,
held my counsel.
     "This is a black business," said Holmes at last, "with some
similarity to our case of the Greek Interpreter, but I hope to
prevent something altogether darker by far."
     "Do you mean to say that the death of that emaciated man was not
dark enough?" Said I with some heat.
     "Not at all, Watson, in many respects this case may have a fate
worse than death in store for this lady, Miss LaVada Sorensen,
unless we can intervene and effect a rescue."
     This revelation stopped me in my tracks.
     "My dear Holmes, this is too much. How can you presume to know
this woman's name?  By what small clues have you deduced it?"
     "You have seen what I have seen," said Holmes as we continued
walking, "but there are no clues from which you can make such a
deduction. No, Watson, the fact is that you do not know, and
cannot know what I know.  Now, I must leave you here and press
on to Scotland Yard for an interview with Inspector Stanley
Hopkins. We will meet again at our rooms in time for dinner.
Until then, goodbye."
     And there Holmes left me, he to see the well-known Hopkins of
the Yard and me for a puzzling afternoon back at Baker Street.
No matter how I cogitated on the events of the morning I could
not discover the means by which Holmes came about his
information. There was nothing left for me to do but wait.

     Holmes returned to our rooms a little after seven o'clock. He
sat down to table and peered under the covers of the dishes.
     "I am famished, Watson, having taken nothing to eat since this
morning, but I think Mrs.  Hudson's steak and kidney pie will
restore me."
     Holmes ate in silence and I knew that it would be fruitless to
question him about his movements that afternoon. He would tell
me in his own time.  I sat beside the fire reading the evening
paper.
     "Watson, I owe you an explanation. . ."
     I put down my paper. Holmes wiped his mouth on his napkin, came
across and sat in his chair, loaded his old and blackened clay
pipe with a plug of tobacco from the toe of the Persian slipper.
With the tongs, he picked up a glowing ember from the grate of
the fire and applied it to the tobacco.  When he had the pipe
going to his satisfaction, he leant back in his chair and
thrust his feet towards the fire.
     "Yes, Watson, I owe you an explanation."
     "Well, Holmes, I confess to being entirely in the dark over this
affair."
     "Time was of the essence. I could not delay to bring you fully
into my confidence. Even now I am not sure there are not gaps in
my net through which these evil people may escape."
     "Is it as bad as that?"
     "Yes, Watson, it is. However, let me bring you up to the moment
with events as I have seen them. We have time for there is
nothing we can do until later this evening when I expect to hear
from Hopkins.
     "Cast your mind back to this morning and let me tell you that
Miss LaVada Sorensen is an American of Scandinavian descent. She
is a telegraphist lately come to London. She has no relatives
and has fallen prey to white slavers."
     "My God, Holmes, this is monstrous, but how do you know?"
     "Miss Sorensen told me so, she is a telegraphist and like her I
am familiar with Mr.  Samuel Morse's code, it being my
professional duty to a nodding acquaintence with codes and
ciphers of many types."
     "So, Miss Sorensen signalled you with Morse's code, but how?"
     "With her pipe, Watson. She is a lady with a keen mind. I sat
there in Admiral Babbington's chair. She saw me and started
sending a smoke signal encoded in Morse -- four short puffs; one
short puff; one short, one long, two short puffs; followed by
one short, two long puffs, one short puff. I recognised a rhythm
at once but it was only after the third repeat that I understood
that it was Morse that I was seeing. By the fourth repeat I
understood that I was seeing HELP."
     "A distress," I cried.
     "Precisely, Watson. It was at that point that I lit my pipe and
sent back the reply: Who are you? Followed by: What is wrong?
She gave me her name in answer to the first question. To the
second she replied: White slave; prisoner. Then I replied: Do
not despair. I regret I could not send and receive faster, but
clarity of signal was of the utmost importance, the pipe not
being the most facile means of communication."
     "Very good, Holmes, but how do you know that she is an American
of Scandinavian descent and alone in the world?"
     "That is information I deduced from her answers to my questions.
Her Christian name, LaVada, is of peculiarly American origin.
Her surname, Sorensen, is Scandinavian, hence my deduction, a
deduction supported in part by her blond hair and the bone
structure of her face.  Obviously, if she is being held against
her will she must have no relatives or friends because if she
did they would have instituted enquiries as to her whereabouts,
and I have seen none such in the newspapers in recent weeks.
Also, her captors must know this or they would not have made so
bold as to kidnap her."
     "Wonderful, but is she not lucky to have attracted the Admiral's
eye? Why not someone in the street?"
     "She is extremely lucky, Watson. In the first place, city
dwellers rarely look up, and if they did they could not see the
garret windows from ground level, they are only visible from the
upper floors of Black's. As it is, the chances of being seen are
a thousand to one against someone taking notice from the upper
windows of Black's. Most people when they look out of a window
look down into the street below. As chance would have it,
Admiral Babbington happened to look up and his eye was attracted
by a pretty woman. Anyone else would have dismissed her as one
of Mother Abbott's girls and not given her a second glance.
Lucky for her, the Admiral is something of a connoisseur of the
female form no matter what line of business that form might be
engaged in. And to make the odds even larger against her gaining
help, the Admiral happened to mention the curiosity to Mycroft
who thought it might be of interest to me. So, you see, Watson,
the chances of Miss Sorensen's rescue relies on a long chain of
remote coincidence. So much so that if I were less of a
scientific and pragmatic man I should be inclined to attribute
her luck to divine intervention. Even now the forces of evil are
not checked, her luck could run out."
     "By God, Holmes, what are we doing sitting here? We must rescue
this distressed lady at once."
     "Ah! Always the man of action, Watson. We cannot charge into
Mother Abbott's brothel and demand possession of this lady's
person, the law is against us. We must be warranted in our
actions, which is why I went in haste to Scotland Yard to
convince Hopkins to raid the place. But the machinery of the law
is slow moving. A warrant must be issued and the constables
marshalled. I fear. . . but hark, that wheel grinding the curb
outside must be the cab containing Hopkins himself. It is almost
twelve o'clock and the raid should be complete."
     We heard the front door slam and Hopkins heavy tread upon the
stair. The boy in buttons opened the door and showed in our
visitor. We could tell by Hopkins' dejected appearance that all
was not well.
     "Well, Hopkins?" said Holmes as the inspector slumped into the
spare chair.
     "The birds have flown, Mr. Holmes. I think they had warning."
     "I am not surprised. I expected as much," said Holmes, "Mother
Abbott's is used by some of the most distinguished names in the
government. What did you find?"
     "As you said Mr. Holmes, the garret rooms had been occupied.
There was a table, two chairs, and a bed. We found smoking
materials on the table and we could see the reading room windows
of Black's. We questioned the girls, but none of them could say
who was in the room as they were closely guarded. Mother Abbott
is not to be found."
     "All is not lost," said Holmes as he scribbled in haste on a
page from his notebook. He pulled the bell-knob and gave the
note to the boy with instructions to take it to Admiral
Babbington.
     "If you will return for breakfast in the morning, Hopkins, I
think I may have an answer to this."
     "I'll be glad to, Mr. Holmes, and I don't mind saying that I'm
at risk from this botched raid. Disturbing high society whores
for no reason. My job's at stake," Hopkins rose and turned to
leave.
     "Do not worry. We should have something by morning."
     "I hope you're right, Mr. Holmes, I hope you're right."
     Our door slammed again and Holmes said: "We had better turn in
ourselves and see what the morning brings when the tide turns."

     Next morning, I came down as the clock struck eight to find
Holmes about already with several telegrams opened on the table
in front of him. I poured myself a cup of coffee and heard the
sound of the doorbell.
     "Good morning, Watson, I trust you slept well?"
     "Yes, Holmes, I did, but who is that at this hour?"
     "It is the boy from the telegraph office if I am not mistaken."
     There was a knock at the door and in came Billy with a telegram
that he gave to Holmes who opened and quickly read it.
     "Excellent! Excellent! There is no reply. It is as I expected.
Have you seen the report of Hopkins' raid in 'The Times',
Watson? You will just have time to read it before he arrives."
     I picked up the paper, reading the leader while sipping my
coffee.
     "The leader writer doesn't show Hopkins in very good light,"
said I.
     "No, Watson, he does not, but I hope to rectify that this very
morning. We will wait until he arrives for his breakfast and
then I will put him at his ease for he is anxious as you will
see."
     At a quarter before the hour, Hopkins was shown up to our rooms
and he did indeed look careworn. His face showed the strain he
was under and his mouth was drawn into a thin, tight line. He
sat heavily into the spare chair and Holmes passed him a cup of
coffee.
     "It's a bad business Mr. Holmes. Have you seen 'The Times' this
morning?" Holmes nodded his assent. "The Commissioner is making
my life very difficult. I hope you have some better news for
me."
     "Indeed, I do have better news," said Holmes. "The watch we set
at the Cinque Ports proved fruitless, as I expected, but
nevertheless it was a safety measure only. This telegram from
Sheerness is of good report. See for yourself."
     Hopkins snatched the proffered telegram from Holmes' hand and
read eagerly.
     "Thank heavens we're not on a wild goose chase after all!
Captain Croaker detained them, taking them out of the cutter on
its way out of the Thames estuary early this morning.  What a
relief to me Mr. Holmes."
     "Yes, Hopkins, I apologise for putting you at such a
disadvantage, but I think you will find that the publicity
surrounding your successful capture of the London end of this
vile trade will more than make up for the temporary
inconvenience. Pray, sit up to the table and enjoy your
breakfast. There are some excellent kippers in that chafing
dish; fried bacon, eggs, kidneys, and tomatoes; toast and
marmalade."
     "Mr. Holmes, you have quite restored my appetite. Indeed, I find
myself sharp set all of a sudden. Pray, tell me how you came to
draw all these threads into your hands."
     I joined Hopkins in breaking our fast while Holmes stood in
front of the fire, leaning his left elbow on the mantlepiece and
propping his foot on the fender, his blackened clay pipe in his
right hand, it charged with the dottles of yesterday's smoking,
blue smoke rising from the bowl.  He related the events leading
up to this capture alluded to in the last telegram. Hopkins and
I listened while we ate.
     "Doctor Watson is not privy to the events from last night," said
Holmes, "so, I will begin there, Hopkins, if you don't mind."
     "Not at all, Mr. Holmes. Not at all," said Hopkins in some
lightness of heart.
     "As you know, Watson, the raid on Mother Abbott's yielded
nothing, the abbess having been forewarned in time for her to
steal a march from us. As soon as I knew the outcome I sent a
special message to Admiral Babbington.  Hopkins had the Cinque
Ports watched. . . ."
     "Yes, Mr. Holmes, at your suggestion," said he.
     "As I thought would happen, this information was also passed to
the abbess and her associates, which left them with one avenue
of escape. . . ."
     "By water down the Thames," said I.
     "Exactly. My message to the Admiral warned him to send a signal
to Captain James Croaker in 'The Vengence' who detained the
cutter off the Nore and took the occupants prisoner.  He is
bringing Miss LaVada Sorensen up the Thames on the flood tide
and Mother Abbott's accomplices are being held in chains until
they can be brought before the proper authorities. The captain
and Miss Sorensen should be with us by one o'clock."
     "Marvellous," said Hopkins.
     "Wonderful," said I.
     Hopkins finished his breakfast and then left us for the Yard to
make arrangements to receive the prisoners and to write his
report. Holmes and I spent the morning reading the papers while
waiting for the arrival of Captain Croaker and Miss Sorensen.

     Captain Croaker made good time. At half past twelve, Miss
Sorensen was shown into our rooms on the arm of Captain James
Croaker, a fine example of a seafaring officer, six feet tall,
dressed in brass-buttoned sea-going rig, grey eyed, auburn
haired, and possessed of a fine, luxurient beard.  Leaning
heavily on his arm, Miss Sorensen was the most remarkably
striking figure of womanhood that I have had the good fortune to
look upon. She was dressed in a high- necked dress of dark
violet taffeta, of full bosom and slim waist, her fine blond
hair escaping in wisps from a hastily contrived chignon. Her
eyes were of a peculiar and startling blue, contrasted by the
dark circles of skin below wrought by her vicissitudes; her fine
Scandinavian features were haggard by the long days of
captivity. Shorter than the captain, she was about five feet,
six inches in height. Together they made a handsome couple.
     "Miss Sorensen, Captain Croaker, please sit down," said Holmes
indicating the settee.
     With remarkable solicitude, the gallant captain helped the
weakened Miss Sorensen be comfortable, arranging pillows behind
her in support of her back.
     "I am glad you received our signal, Captain, and were entirely
successful in your endeavour," said Holmes.
     "So am I, Sir. We caught the cutter coming out on the remains of
the ebb tide and, with little room to manoeuvre, hove to when I
had the master gunner put a nine-pound ball across her bow. I
sent my first officer across in a boat with an armed boarding
party. They found Miss Sorensen bound and gagged in the
forepeak. We have handed those blackguards over to the police."
     "Well done, Captain. There are one or two points about which I
am unclear and I wonder if I might prevail upon Miss Sorensen to
give me and Dr.  Watson a brief summary of the circumstances of
her kidnap."
     "I must thank you Mr. Holmes, and the other gentlemen for my
rescue for I was in despair of ever being free again and
thinking of taking my own life rather than suffer the
indignities to which I was destined," said Miss Sorensen in soft
accents of North America. She continued: "My mother died while
giving birth to me. I was brought up by my father who was in
business in Chicago. He was afflicted with a weak heart and
joined my mother just before I graduated from Vassar College. My
father believed in the benefit of a sound education and sent me
there to attain it. After my graduation, I took a job as a
telegraphist in Chicago and learned Sam Morse's code. This job
was a temporary step to keep me from dwelling too much on my
loss and to give me time to decide what I should do with my
life. While at Vassar, I had studied much about the ancient
philosophers and systems of government common in the Old
Countries of Europe. I decided that I would like to see for
myself the mode of living and the foundations on which the
countries of Great Britain and Europe are based.  However,
despite my father's success in business, I did not have
unlimited funds at my disposal. To support myself I would need
some form of employment and hit upon the notion of using my
education in conjunction with acting as governess to the
children of some wealthy family.
     "From Chicago, I came to London and stayed in a boarding house
where I met a charming man, an explorer and traveller, Mr.
Fortesque Bland. While letting it be known that I was seeking a
position as a governess, I was rash enough to reveal that I was
alone in the world.  On the pretext of going to meet a
prospective employer, Bland decoyed me into Mother Abbott's
house where I was held prisoner in the rooms in the upper part
of the house. Bland had lived amongst the people of Persia and
the Levant, and had contracted with Mother Abbott to sell me
into the slavery of some Eastern Potentate's hareem. Apparently,
I would fetch a high price on account of my stature and blond
hair. . . ."
     "Damn fiends! I would very much like to have them flogged around
the fleet and then run up to the yardarm by the neck," said the
Captain in an angry voice that rattled the windows.
     "Part of the preparation for my journey was to habituate me to
opium in an effort to make me more pliable. Mother Abbott had
been feeding it to me in my food. Each day, I would recover from
the stupor and sit at the window.  Looking down, I noticed a man
sitting in the window of the building opposite. I had discovered
that I could steady my nerves by smoking tobacco as I have done
in the loneliness of my past. All I was provided with was a pipe
and coarse tobacco. Sitting in the window smoking and looking
down on the man across the street, I felt that if I could
attract his attention I might succeed in rescue. You may imagine
the intensity with which I looked at that man, but each day he
would turn away after sitting for an hour, and each day my
despair grew until one day he chanced to look up.
     "Always there was someone in the room with me while I was
conscious. When the man in the window below and across the
street took notice I would puff the letters HELP in Sam Morse's
code. I noticed that he wore a uniform and thought that he would
understand, but I found that the code is not commonly known and
my despair deepened. As the days passed, I began to think how I
could take my life to prevent the abuse waiting for me.
Yesterday, the man was at his window and again I started sending
my cry for help in tobacco smoke.
     "Imagine my disappointment when the man looked up at me as usual
and left his chair, and my astonishment when he was replaced by
Mr. Holmes who, after three or four sends, lit his own pipe and
sent me: Who are you? My heart stopped and I cried out but
managed to cover my confusion with a fit of coughing, so that my
guard was not suspicious. I sent my replies and was able to rest
easier than at any time during the month long eternity that was
my prelude to Hell.  My dismay, Mr. Holmes. . . . My dismay at
the sudden move from the house. . . . It was too much to bear.
Some word was brought to Mother Abbott and her cohort causing me
to be hustled from the house in a cab to the river and a boat
that set sail on the ebb tide.  It was too much for me and, half
stupified, I cried and cried until I was gagged by those
ruffians.
     "Hope returned when we were stopped in our flight by good
Captain Croaker and his crew. At last I am free and I can only
thank you from the depths of my heart."
     So said the unfortunate Miss LaVada Sorensen who had begun to
shake and burst into the most piteous sobbing. Captain Croaker
was at her side instantly, offering her the use of his
handkerchief.
     "I am so sorry, gentlemen, but I am feeling the effects of the
opium."
     "And the nervous strain of your captivity," said I, feeling her
pulse.  "You must have complete rest."
     "Dr. Watson is quite corrrect, Miss Sorensen," said Holmes. "I
think you have completed all the details for me. You must rest
and recuperate and be ready to give evidence at the trial of
these people."
     "I have a friend, Dr. Frederick Clenchwater who has a nursing
home by the sea in Bournemouth. I will give you a letter of
introduction. He will take you in and effect a cure."
     "Alas, Dr. Watson, I have not the money for such a treatment."
     "Do not worry," said Holmes, "I think we can take care of that."
     "Certainly. Certainly," said the Captain.
     "Could you leave your ship long enough to escort Miss Sorensen
to Bournemouth, Captain? There is a four o'clock train from
Waterloo today."
     "I should be delighted to be of service. My first officer will
take care of the ship until I return."
     "I will give Miss Sorensen a mild sedative to steady her for the
journey until she can reach the care of Clenchwater," said I.
     "Then, Captain, you and Miss Sorensen should stay and take a
bite for lunch and then go on to Bournemouth as soon as
possible," said Holmes, ringing the bell for Mrs. Hudson.

     After our guests had departed, Holmes said: "That lady was very
lucky," and picked up his violin. Soon he was engrossed in a
series of melancholy improvisations upon a theme.

     All that remains for me to say is that six months later, Captain
James Croaker and Miss LaVada Sorensen were married. They now
live at Hambledon, in the county of Hampshire and have two sons
and a daughter.

Subject: PCI Show, St Louis, MO

I just returned from the PCI show in St Louis and thought I'd take a
couple of minutes to type up a brief trip report.  I'm sure others will
cover the event in greater detail, but some may find this of some
interest.
  
Military life causes me to travel a great deal--and enables me to visit
far-flung tobacconists--but until now my travels had never brought me to 
the correct place and time to attend a major show.  Unfortunately, I was 
only able to drive over for Saturday, so I missed the Organization of 
Online Pipe Smokers (OOPS) smoker Friday evening.  Craig Tarler must have 
sent 25 pounds of tobacco as his contribution, and "Dr. Ray" and gang made a 
valiant effort to finish it off.  They failed in this task (leaving
more than enough to maintain a pipe "filling station" Saturday), but did
manage to set off the smoke detector.  I am disappointed to have missed 
this particular bit of excitement &lt;G&gt;.
   
It was very exciting to be able to meet face-to-face with folks I had
previously known only from e-mail exchanges, letters, and telephone
calls.  Several PD and a.s.p denizens were in attendance, and I am
pleased to report that they are--without exception--as nice in person as
they are online.  It was also a pleasure to be able to meet Nikos Levin,
Jack Ehrmantraut, Bob Hamlin, Roswitha Anderson, and several folks I
knew only by reputation.  My firmly held opinion that pipe smokers are
the best people ramains unshaken.
   
I went to the show with the intent of purchasing an Ashton (I didn't
have one) and a 1963 Dunhill (for some strange egocentric reason, I have 
always craved a pipe made during my birth year), and I was able to achieve 
both goals.
   
I was shopping for a Dunhill shell, as I prefer their looks and the
price is usually right.  While going over the tables, however, I picked
up a beautiful straight grain--a "DRC".  I was turning the little pipe 
over in my hands, admiring it, when I noticed that there was a "3" after 
"England".  I believe in fate, so after some protracted dickering (which 
included the addition of a Dunhill folding tamper to the bargain) I walked 
away with my first Dunhill Dead Root and my "birthday pipe" at a very
good price.
    
I bought the Ashton (actually a "Taylor Made") from Dennis Congos of the 
Carolina Briar Friars.  Dennis visited Bill Taylor in 1990 and Bill made 
this pipe for him.  Dennis selected the bowl, and Bill hand-cut the brindled 
vulcanite stem for him on the spot.  It is a huge, gorgeous, thick-walled 
pipe with a marvelous straight grain, reminiscent of an old Charatan 
freehand.  I showed the pipe to Bob Hamlin, and he is of the opinion that 
the bowl was turned by Sid Cooper.  The pipe cannot have been smoked a dozen 
times and still retains its original finish.  The fact that I know the story 
behind the pipe makes owning it even more enjoyable.
   
I drove back to Leavenworth, Kansas (my very temporary home) a very happy 
man and look forward to attending next year's show in Dallas (only three
hours from my slightly less temporary home).  [Wonder if I can get the
Army to send me to Virginia for the C.O.R.P.S. show... &lt;G&gt;]

Subject: Response to hookah experience

Steve:
    I just thought that I would relate to the good people of PD how my 
experience with the hookah that I just got in last week went. First, I 
ordered the largest one in stock from the Haight-Ashbury Tobacco Center 
in San Francisco. It turned out to be about three feet in height. I also 
ordered some little disks of charcoal and the tobacco that usually goes 
with it. The tobacco is from Egypt and India and is extremely wet-my 
guess is that it is soaked in molasses and other flaovoring is added in. 
The stuff will not ignite unless you place one of the charcoal disks on 
top of the little mound. I filled the glass bottom with water and a 
little bit of some Lebanese liquor called "arak". Placing the top part on 
and sealing the connection with the rubber gasket provided, I inserted 
the hose and tested for leaks. There were none. I put a small amount of 
the apricot -flavored Egyptian tobak on the ceramic plug on top along 
with a charcoal disk. The little disk throws off quite a bit of sparks 
when it first ignites but then settles down to a nice hot glow. Smoking 
this thing involved drawing on the hose which produced a vacuum in the 
glass, causing the smoke from the burning leaf to be drawn down into the 
water/arak solution. The smoke then bubbled up into the container where I 
was able to access it with the hose. The smoke was very cool and had a 
hint of the arak taste. All in all, a different experience which I intend 
on exploring further.

Subject: Pipe store in Paris

Steve:  An offering for the Directory.

Au Ca=EFd
24, Boulevard Saint-Michel
75006 PARIS
This shop has been around a while.  It carries Butz-Choquin, Ropp pipes,
several other French and other brands, also Meerschaum pipes, lighters, ash
trays, accessories.  Pretty neat store, easy to find, in the Latin Quarter.

I also recommend =C0 la Civette, just across from the Palais Royal on the ru=
e
St. Honor=E9 (quite near the Louvre).  Upscale store, nice pipes, lighters,
cigars, etc.

[ Sounds good, and I'd like to put it in, but the message got a bit
garbled... Perhaps some special characters? -S. ]

Subject: Calabash and Meerschaum questions

A few years ago when my great uncle passed away I came across a pipe
collection of his that no one knew he had.  There were only about 6 or so
pipes: one a Digby bulldog, one from a state park in Ky., one with a carved
monkey face on it (!), and another with a broken mouthpiece that had a club
on the shank of the pipe.  However, the two pipes that caught my attention
was an old calabash pipe with a porcelain bowl, and  the largest carved
meerschaum I have ever seen in real life. Larger than my fist, it is a
carving of a woman holding up a flower, which is the bowl of the pipe.  It is
a precolored meerschaum and the manufacturer's label on the inside of the
case is called "WDC -  genuine meerschaum". My questions are these:  while
the pipes seem in good condition in terms of stem and body of the pipes, I am
unable to get a good draw off of the calabash due to the cork being either
rotted or worn away from years of use.  Can calabash pipes be recorked or
refitted to provide a better draw?  Additionally, the draw on the meerschaum
is not very good and the stem on this pipe appears to have been replaced at a
later date (black vulcanite).  Can this too be reconditioned to a smokable
order, and can old amber stems be replaced on to old meerschaum pipes? If any
of these pipes can be reconditioned, where can it be done, and should I even
smoke them due to their age and possible value? Finally, has anyone ever
heard of the abovementioned meerschaum company so I could get an approximate
date and value on this meerschaum pipe?  I know these are  a LOT of
questions, but I feel that these two pipes are among the most interesting in
my collection, if not the most valuable, and would like to gather any info
about their repair and history from the any readers of Pipe Digest if there
is any information to give.  Thanks a million for your time, and happy
smoking.

- LenrdZelig

[ I'd suggest getting in touch with Jim Cooke about the repair, unless
anyone knows of a calabash expert. Good luck! -S. ]

Subject:       Re: Congratulations and Craven's Mixture

Dear Steve,
I haven't written before, but do enjoy the Pipe Digest and 
appreciate all the excellent work you do. Congratulations and best
wishes to you and Jean on your marriage. My wife and I have been
happily married for 31 years, and I've always been an avid, perhaps
too avid, pipe smoker, and she has never been a smoker, so this may
be a good sign.

As for the request for a clone of Craven's Mixture, Craig Tarler, 
who I am pleased to see has become a regular contributer to PD, has
one called Yale Mixture. For those who may not know it, he is the 
President of Cornell &amp; Diehl, and does a mail-order business in fine
tobacco at very reasonable prices. As he is a gentleman, and doesn't
toute his business with every post to the PD, let me give his e-mail
address: ???@???.???. I notice his e-mail address in the PD is 
???@???.???.???, which may be his personal, not business address. 
IMHO, his service matches (no pun intended) the quality of his many
blends: terrific. I'm smoking a bowl of his Continental Air as I 
type this. People stop me in the street and ask what it is that 
smells so good. 

Cheers to you and yours, and greetings to all sotweed devotees!

when I suddenly heard the clang of the bell." A.C.Doyle, The 
Adventure of the Crooked Man. (Must have been the wedding bell.)

[ Many thanks, Spencer! I've tried Craig's analog of Craven's, and
while I can't attest to its authenticity, it was enjoyed. -S. ]

Subject:  Pipe Smoker's Ephemeris

     Dear Steve,
     
     I am an avid collector and smoker of very large pipes and cigars.
     How do I get onto alt.smokers.pipes from AOL?  Since this is such a 
     limited field of interest, I am trying everything I can to get more 
     information on large pipes, and people who smoke them.  Hopefully by 
     talking with other big pipe smokers, I will be able to find some new 
     sources of pipes and other helpful information along the way.  I very 
     much enjoy pipe and cigar talk, so I am always looking for 
     correspondence with other pipe and cigar smoking devotees.
     
     Any information that you can forward would be really appreciated!
     
     Happy Smoking,
     
     Mark Peterson

[ Again, can any of our AOL members help Mark! Please reply directly
to him. -S. ]

Subject: Dunhill Guide

Steve: 

Just a quick note to let you know that I saw your "request" in the
Digest for Dunhill information. I am in the process of putting
togeather a complete Dunhill history, finish, dating guide for you
that will include patent numbers, complete (as possible) dating
information, finishes, etc.

I have a lot of this information now, but I've written London to get
as much dating information as possible to update my current
guides. This will be a major work when its published (like the Ashton
&amp; Castello "guides"), so give me some time and I promise it will be
worth the wait!

btw: Congrates!

-Bob 

[ Thanks, Bob! Looking forward to the Dunhill guide, which I hope will
go on our sites (and in the Digest if it's not too long to fit). -S. ]

1)  Jeremy Brett, the incarnation of Holmes on the silver screen, died
yesterday quietly in his sleep.  Will have more info at the next meeting and
suggest we do something (?) at the show to honour this event.

2) Nikos Levin has a home page on the WEB:

Finally, be sure to check your mail frequently.... The brochure abstract that
I posted on several pipe and tobacco related BBS's and forums lists the CORPS

Subject: PD intro

Hello Steve and fellow pipe smokers!

And by the way congratulations Steve!

I've been reading the Digest since november 94, and thought that I
finally should introduce myself. Really don't know why I haven't done
it before. I guess the main reason is that I have been a "little" bit
afraid of trying to express my self in English. Well here I go.

I'm a 26 year old Norwegian, studying microelectronics and VLSI at
University of Oslo. I'm currently working on my Cand Scient thesis, I
think it is about equal to a master degree in the US.

I began pipe smoking at the age of 14. I've had a couple of years as a
cigarett smoker as well, but the "fun" part of smoking has always been
the pipe!  Through my 12 yaers as a pipe smoker, I have tried several
blends of tobacco. In the last couple of years I have found the blends
that has become my favourite. It is aromatic mixtures of the Danish
brand "My Own Blend". Especially "MC13", but also "1970", "OB89" and
"16V". These tobaccos are worthwhile trying if you like sweet smelling
and tasting aromatics.

I have about 10 pipes and use 6 of them. A small collection just
waiting to grow... . My favourit pipes are a Brebbia and a Bari. These
two pipes give me really enjoyable smoking. The four others are cheap
and no good, bought at a time when knowledge and founds where
shourt. I still live on a small budget, but buy pipes when I have
saved enough money. My favourite shapes are Lovat, Bulldog and "short"
Billiards. I prefer straight stems, because they are both easy to
clean and look's good.

Well, that's it for now folks. Light up an enjoy!

Subject: A couple of questions

Hey there, fellow pipe smokers.  I have a couple of questions 
for the PD community:
	First of all, I have noticed some differences between aromatic
and non-aromatic tobacco besides the obvious one of flavour.  It seems
that when I smoke aromatic tobacco, I have problems with unattractive
gurgling sounds in my pipe, particularly towards the end of a bowl.
Also, there is a certain amount of wet tobacco left in the bowl that
is unsmokable.  Is this because of the additives in aromatic tobacco?
What are those additives?  It seems like aromatic tobacco is moister
to start with, even sticky sometimes.  I don't really trust tobacco
that is sticky.  What's the deal?  Also, one of the types of aromatic
tobacco that I have enjoyed (although, on the whole, I enjoy the
non-aromatic oriental stuff more) is called black cavendish.  Now some
of the black cavendish I've sampled has been very sweet, moist, and
sticky, while other samples have been drier and less odiferous.  Also,
I have seen other tobacco labelled "cavendish" which hasn't been black
at all (does "Dutch Cavendish" ring a bell?).  What's the difference?
Why does aromatic tobacco burn hotter?
	Secondly, I hear (I mean read) a lot of folks talking about
pre-19-something Dunhills.  I just bought a used Dunhill at a Flea
market for $2.  It's both a beautiful smoking and looking pipe, with a
nice tight grain and lots of birds-eye.  How can I tell how old it is?
Although I am somewhat of a collector, I really only classify my pipes
by how nice they look and how well they smoke.  I'm starting to think
it would be nice to know some more information about my pipes, if only
so that I could brag about them to other pipe smokers I might meet.
For example, I have three Petersons and, although they're all
attractive-looking, one of them doesn't smoke all that well.  I have
another labelled "Algor" which looks kind of funny, but smokes
beautifully.  Can someone recommend some literature that might contain
useful information about lesser known brands?
				Thanks, Tim Ramsay

Subject: good inexpensive cigars

Well having happily braved a flurry of EMAIL regarding good, relatively
cheap cigars, I thought I'd report back with an overview. Thanks to all who
sent in their suggestions and I hope you don't mind if share your thoughts
with PD.

The parameters were: high 40's to 50's ring size, length not to important,
AVO like in mildness.

1. "IMHO the best cheap cigar is the La Unica
which is a Fuente bundled cigar.  It comes in both maduro and natural.  I
pay around $30 (a little more or less depending on size) for a bundle of 20.
The La Unica is a dominician cigar.  I have not found a Good cheap honduran
cigar.  I usually stick with Excaliburs."

2. "One of our quests is to find the perfect $1.00 cigar and I believe we
have a few  
that might fit that description.  You said to use Avos as a  
model--which one Avo has at least seven shapes all of which taste  
different?  Judging from your default, the HDM Rothschlide I'm  
guessing Avo Belecosos  or its little brother the petite belecosos.   
Using those two, I might suggest Don Juan Robustos ($1.25), Old  
Fashioned Dominicana No.32 ($1.50)???, Bacarat (watch out for the  
sweet gum on the wrapper), Old Fashioned Jamaicans ($1.10).  

Another hint, for smoother cigars age them at least six months in a  
Spanish cedar humidor, it can turn a Don Diego into a work of art." 

3. "I read your comments in Pipe Digest #199, requesting info on good cigars
that 
could be had for $ 2.00 or less a piece. One cigar that I enjoy immensely
and is 
quite reasonable in price is sold by Mr. Robert C. Hamlin of PCCA. 

He is on compuserve and runs a mail order business. Bob is a honorable man and 
runs a good business. He has contributed to the pipe digest on numerous 
occasions, as well, he contributes greatly to the Cigar and Pipe forum on 
compuserve. His email address is ?????.??@??????????.???

Anyway, these cigars, called PS Cigars(Private Stock, I think?) are
actually Davidoff seconds. I don't think I have to tell you just how
expensive Davidoffs are. After having smoked over a hundred of these
cigars, I have never had a bad one. The only thing I can find wrong
with them is the color of the wrappers may vary from cigar to
cigar. Currently I smoke a 6 X 48rg that is absolutely delightful,
although he has many sizes available and his prices will fit right in
with what you are looking for."

4. "My recommendation is the Licenciados Excelentes, a Lonsdale rated 89 by
Cigar Aficionado.  I get them at Georgetown Tobacco in DC for about $1.75.
(C.A. got theirs for $1.60, but Georgetown is expensive.)

You can pick and choose from the Arturo Fuente cigars.  I've never gotten
one I didn't like."

5. "Hoyo de Monterrey Exquisito #50.  This is a bundled cigar that I get
from J*R
Cigar (1-800-JR-CIGAR). I've only seen them offered mail order through J*R.
Size is 6x50. It comes in both EMS and maduro wrappers, and I prefer the EMS.
Price from J*R is $30 for a bundle of 25, which works out to $1.20 per cigar.
This is a full bodied cigar, with hints of chocolate, probably comparable to
the HdM Rothschilds that you smoke. It's my favorite everyday, working in the
yard type cigar.

Hoyo de Monterrey Excalibur #3. I usually smoke the #1 or the #2, but the #3
falls into your parameters of under $2. The actual cost from J*R is $39 per
box of 20, which works out to $1.95 per cigar. Size is 6x50, and it comes in
either natural or maduro wrapper. A milder and smoother smoke than the
Exquisito #50, probably compares favorably to the Avo. I have a friend who
likes the Avo #5, and he really enjoys the Excalibur #1.

Vueltabajo Robusto. Size is 4.5x50 and only comes in natural. Cost from J*R
is $42 for a box of 25 ($1.68 per cigar). A well made cigar with a smooth,
complex, almost vanilla like flavor. FWIW, I've also smoked the Vueltabajo
Churchill and for some reason, it didn't have the same flavor."

6. "Try macanudo prince phillips they are about $28 for a box of 10.
(hey not under 2 bucks but if you smoke avo's, these are bargains)."

And to this list I'll add Licenciados Churchill seconds from Mike's Cigars,
a great cigar. I have no idea why these are seconds. 

Thanks again everybody.

Robin

Subject: Pipe Makers

Steve, congratulations on your marriage.  One trusts you have had a great
honeymoon and that it consisted of visiting more places than all the pipe
shops within visiting distance of wherever you went.
 
I'd like to share the following article with you and the Digest readers.
It appeared in the September issue of the Ohio Pipe Collectors newsletter.
I encourage anyone who would like to join our club (currently 65 members)
or to receive a complimentary copy of the newsletter to write me.--Bill
Unger
 
OHIO PIPEMAKERS: NUMBER TWO IN A SERIES
 
                   STEPHEN AND ROSWITHA ANDERSON
 The Artisans
 
     Steve and Roswitha Anderson, fulltime Ohio pipemakers, live in
Columbus, where Steve was born and raised.  Steve, the son of an electrical
engineer and woodworker with whom Steve began working at a young age,
started smoking pipes at 15 and nurturing the idea that he would like to
make pipes someday.  While serving in the U.S. Army in Germany in the early
1960s, Steve used his free time to travel and visit as many European
pipemakers as he could, questioning them about their methods and examining
their tools and machinery.
 
     Roswitha, a native German, had undertaken four years of schooling and
apprenticeship as a seamstress/clothing designer, a career for which she
was unable to find work when she finished. So she went to work in a
children's home--the very one Steve's unit later "adopted" and provided
with the hardboiled eggs for a traditional Easter egg hunt.  Steve, the
unit's translator, spoke German.  Roswitha knew nothing about pipes, but
she soon learned because many of her dates with Steve involved his
continuing hunt for European pipe manufacturers to study.
 
     Steve and Roswitha married in 1964 and returned to the States in 1965.
Steve resumed his old job at Western Electric, but he and Roswitha
continued collecting information about pipemaking.  In these years, the
U.S. still contained many small pipemaking factories, and the Andersons
traveled "tens of thousands of miles" to visit them and to make offers for
their unused tools.  Other tools were hand forged to their specifications.
A great influence on them and one of the most helpful of the pipemakers
they visited was Andre Mermet, who Steve calls "a great pipemaker."
Mermet made all the Wilke pipes as well as pipes for the military.
 
     In the late 60s, Steve and Roswitha began making pipes under the S&amp;R
symbol--which is an S in the form of a pipe with smoke coming out of it and
an R superimposed through it.  In those days, Steve and Roswitha would
travel to as many as 25 craft shows a year and produce about 2,000 pipes,
90% of them "cheap" (in the $15-20 range) because, Steve says, "that's what
people were buying."  But the rat race started to get to them and, facing
burnout, they started cutting back.  Today they do about seven shows a year
and produce 500-600 pipes of a much higher grade, ranging in price from $35
to $250.  The most expensive pipe they have ever made and sold was a
seven-day straight-grain set in a hand-crafted box that sold immediately
for $5400.
 
     Steve Anderson creates the more traditional pipe shapes produced by
S&amp;R Wood Crafts: Pipes &amp; Pleasures.  He enjoys researching historical pipe
literature and ads for forgotten pipe shapes that he can recreate in his
workshop.  Roswitha uses her design background to conceive and carve their
line of freehand pipes.  She is possibly the only fulltime woman custom
pipemaker in the world.
 
     For years, the Andersons observed the tradition of many Old World
Masters and lived above their 1,000-square-foot shop, which features a
well-stocked retail outlet in the front (their pipes and other pipe lines,
tobacco, accessories and a cigar humidor). Behind it is their even larger
3,000-square-foot workshop, which is filled with all the machines and tools
of their trade, half- finished pipes and many hundreds of briar blocks
waiting to be carved.  Recently, however, they became tired of the Old
World crowding and purchased a house to spread out in.
 
     Over the years, the Andersons' work has received more than 25 awards
for excellence.  In 1984, Pipe Collectors International chose Steve and
Roswitha to produce the 1985 collector club pipe. These pipes, individually
numbered and stamped with the PCI logo, were distributed to PCI members all
over the world.  The Andersons competed with nine of the largest European
pipe companies and two large U.S. companies for the honor.  They were the
first American pipemakers ever chosen to produce a PCI collector pipe.
 
     Early in 1985, the Andersons flew to Saint-Claude, France, where Steve
was inducted into the Confrerie des Maitres-Pipiers de Saint-Claude, France
(the Brotherhood of Master Pipemakers of Saint-Claude, France) at its 70th
meeting.  Saint-Claude is usually recognized as the birthplace of the briar
pipe.  The Brotherhood, which dates from the late 1700s, is the only world-
wide organized pipemakers' guild.  It is presided over by the Master
Pipemakers, all direct descendants of the original pipemakers of
Saint-Claude.  The Brotherhood is limited to persons who have been
recognized for their contributions to the pipe industry.  Members must be
invited to join--they cannot apply.  Steve Anderson's signature is now
written in the golden book of the Brotherhood, a book that also dates from
the Brotherhood's founding.  His presentation pipe is now displayed in the
permanent collection of the pipe museum at Saint-Claude.
 
     When I asked Steve and Roswitha what ideal, in terms of craftsmanship
and smoking qualities they strive for, they couldn't confine themselves to
a single answer.  Steve still regards Andre Mermet as a great pipemaker,
and they expressed admiration for the pipes of Mike Butera in the U.S. and,
in England, of Barry Jones, who owns Upshall and used to turn the old
Charatan bowls, and Les and Dolly Woods, who make Ferndowns. Steve believes
that U.S. pipemaker J.T. Cooke is a "fantastic artisan" and "perhaps the
best pipemaker in the U.S. today--maybe in the world."  They also spoke
with awe of some of the work being done in Japan, especially the Tsuge
pipe.
 
     Both Steve and Roswitha are pipe smokers, and both like Esoterica
tobaccos.  Steve's favorite is Pembroke, while Roswitha prefers And So to
Bed.
 
     Steve somehow finds the time and energy to work as an unpaid video
producer, director and camera man for the Columbus public access television
station.  He has spoken of his desire to produce a pipemaking video, a
project that many pipe smokers would like to see him accomplish.
 
The Pipes
 
     S&amp;R pipes are all made from the highest grade of Mediterranean briar,
which the Andersons bring back themselves from New York when a consignment
arrives so as to avoid careless handling of the rough-cut blocks in
shipment.  Once in their shop, the briar blocks are air cured for a minimum
of two years before the Andersons begin selecting the blocks to be made
into pipes.  Steve and Roswitha have separate work spaces, with most of the
same tools duplicated in each.  Roswitha designs all the S&amp;R freehand
shapes and helps out with the traditional shapes, but Steve does all the
drilling and mortise work because he's so good at it.
 
     When one examines the S&amp;R workshop, it appears highly mechanized.
Many of the Andersons' boring and cutting machines have been hand-forged to
their specifications; others they purchased from the old pipe firms
discovered in their travels. However, the machinery is only an aid to speed
the process of boring, drilling and shaping the rough briar blocks.  The
final product is carved and finished by hand, and the artistic paneling or
detailing makes each pipe unique even though it may have a traditional
shape.
 
     Steve Anderson is proud of his sandblasting work, which he has given a
lot of thought to and has taught to many other pipemakers.  In Europe,
sandblasted pipes have traditionally been tumbled together in a large drum
while being blasted, which does not produce uniform results.  The
Andersons' sandblasting setup occupies an entire room to itself.  Before
sandblasting one of their pipes, the Andersons carefully mask off various
parts of it in order to produce exactly the effect they want.
 
     The Andersons carefully inspect every pipe between each step of its
making.  If a serious flaw appears, the pipe is discarded. S&amp;R high-grade
pipes come with one of three finishes:
 
     ~    A smooth finish for pipes made of flawless briar.  Some of these
pipes are rubbed with an oil finish, but most are stained to highlight the
grain.
 
     ~    A sandblast, for pipes with minor surface flaws.
 
     ~    A Coral Rock finish, which is a pipe that is first carved with a
hand-made cutter and then etched (blasted) with glass beads.  This process
brings a very fine, spider-web-like grain back out from the carving.
 
     Steve and Roswitha began dating their high-grade pipes (those that
cost over $35) in 1985.  Using a base of 50, they stamp each S&amp;R pipe with
a two-digit number.  Thus a pipe stamped "45" would be made in 1995.  They
do not date their carved pipes, which retail below $35.
 
     Steve and Roswitha Anderson--artisans, OPC members and extremely nice
people--can be contacted at 4244 East Main St., Columbus, OH 43213 or call
(614) 235-6422.

If you've got one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you've got more than
one, you're a pipe collector.

[ Bill, many thanks.  Your efforts on behalf of the OPC really show in
their newsletter, which is a favorite of mine. And, no, I went through
the honeymoon on an estimated thirty grams of MacBaren Burley and not
one visit to a pipe shop... -S. ]

Subject: Greetings from California

Dear Steve -

Well, we just had our West Coast Pipe &amp; Cigar Expo a couple of weeks ago.
 And what a show it was!  I'll write more about it later, but I just
wanted to let everyone know that we're in production on a video of the
Expo.  When it's ready I hope you won't mind if I put in a plug for
it.  In the meantime I wanted to pass along the following excerpt from
the latest Southwest Pipe &amp; Cigar League newsletter.  The first item
should be of interest to everyone, while the second is aimed more at
the PD subscribers in California.  I would also like to ask our
subscribers to get the word out on all this stuff!

Best Regards,

Steve J. (Briar Man)

			      LEGISLATIVE ALERT

	As you probably know, our dear president Clinton has proposed
new measures to crack down on teen smoking.  These measures involve
the FDA (of course), which has wanted to regulate nicotine as a drug.
Now that Clinton and FDA head control-freak David Kessler have teamed
up, the push is under way to try and build public support for these
measures.  Fact is, the public support ain't there, but that won't
stop them from trying to take us further down the road towards tobacco
prohibition.  Although the target has been specifically stated as
cigarettes only, make no mistake - if this goes through pipe tobacco
and cigars WILL end up being on the list later on.

	Reason I mention all this is that the public comment period is
open until November 9, 1995.  I URGE ALL OF YOU TO WRITE TO THE FDA
AND TELL THEM THAT YOU OPPOSE THEIR REGULATION OF TOBACCO.  You can
send your letters to:

Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305)
Food &amp; Drug Administration, Room 1-23
12420 Parklawn Drive
Rockville, MD  20857

Your letter MUST reference Docket #95N-0253-J.  Put the docket number at the
top of your letter.  PLEASE BE SURE TO GET YOUR LETTERS TO THE FDA BEFORE 
NOVEMBER 9!  Also, for good measure you should write to your elected
officials in Washington about this.  Kessler is seeking nothing less than
police powers for the FDA, and given the Agency's expansion of power under
his leadership I don't think I need to tell you about the implications of FDA
involvement in regulating (read "banning") tobacco.  SO WRITE TODAY!

[ I'll write in on HFA-305, Steve. Thanks for the pointer! And, BTW, I
saw that the latest issue of NML photos feature a pipe made by a
fellow named "S. Johnson." Any relation? :-) -S. ]

Subject: change of address

Steve

I'm moving my E-mail and internet access from Delphi.com to Halcyon, so my 
new address is: ????????@???????.???.  This isn't an easy move, I've been 
at Delphi for 2 years now and have made some good friends there.  But the 
slowness of their News server, as well as the way they have dragged their 
feet on introducing their new interface, I've waited well over a year.

This move has also been fairly exciting, the downloading of new software 
and getting to know how to use it.  It's a far cry from using Delphi's 
interface and their software.  The complications with using seperate mail, 
news, web, telnet and FTP software, getting it all working together is both 
fustrating and invigorating.

Now that the formalities are out of the way let me congratulate you on your 
marriage.  I wish you all the happiness in the world.  I only hope that it 
doesn't keep you from your Pipe Digest duties.  There are three places 
where I find great pipe information, here, ASP, and the Cigar and Pipe 
forum on Compuserve.  Of the three, this is the only one without flames.  I 
used to read ASC, but the signal to noise ratio is just to high there.

My pipe collection is growing daily, well not quite so quick, but it has 
grown.  One of my latest has been a Nording Freehand without a finish.  
After smoking it for awhile it has started to develop a nice patina.  It is 
a rather large piece of briar and that causes it to be heavy in the mouth.  
Also it smokes a tad wet, but the use of pipe cleaners takes care of that.

One of the subjects which I've seen no dicussion of is the qualities of 
various brands of pipe cleaners.  I use BJ Long's for the lucite stems of 
my Italian pipes, which tend to have lips, and Peterson's to clean out the 
shanks.  The Peterson's seem to be thicker and more absorbent than any of 
the others which I have found.  What do you and other use?

A problem I have found is that pipe racks are not built for bents and pipes 
with wide stems.  I've been looking for a large rack with large open holes 
for these pipes.  The complication is that I can' afford to pay a lot for 
it.  If anyone knows where to find such a rack, let me know.

[CIGAR] While in Princeton, look up "A Little Taste of Cuba" (70
Witherspoon St, Princeton NJ 08542; phone (609) 683-8988.)  Jorge
Armenteros, the proprietor, has hit upon a retailing idea which could
spark a revolution: a "cigar parlor."  What this seems to be is a
small storefront shop where one can come in at lunchtime or after
work, buy a 'gar, sit down on a comfortable couch, and puff away,
unmolested by the smoke-cringing Puritans that infest the rest of
Princeton.  Kind of like a seven-day-a-week Bloom's Cigar Camp. The
shop isn't large, and the selection doesn't rival Holt's, but it is a
major source of comfort in a hostile area.

Jorge also carries the Butera line of pipe tobacco, and is working on
building up a line of pipes.  Stop in, and let him know you heard
about it in the Digest! -S.

Steve and all,

	there's a new search engine for article search on the Web

Subject: Casillas Cigars

I recently visited the Casillas Cigars factory (1221 16th st.) in downtown
Sacramento.  There are two rolling tables set up by the front window, manned
by some very experienced Cuban rollers (they used to work at Tower Cigars
before setting up their own shop).

All cigars are handmade, all but one long filler, using a blend of up to
five different tobaccos.  Most wrappers are Ecudorean maduro, with some
natural Connecticut shade used.  The construction is excellent, with an easy
(but not too loose) draw.  The tobacco is of a high quality, with a medium
bodied, rich blend of flavors.

Sizes ranged from the "Pencil" (36 x 5.5, $1.40), to the "Excalibur" (58 x
8.5, $5).  My favorite is the Rotthschild (46 x 5, $2.30); it has a nice
oily maduro wrapper and a nice blend of flavors; it reminds me of my
favorite smoke, the AF Don Carlos Robusto.

The best part about Casillas is the laid back atmosphere.  You can sit
around and enjoy a smoke and discuss cigars with a master roller as he does
his work.  I brought my boys in to visit, so they could see that cigars were
truly a hand made product.  The folks are very friendly and justifiably
proud of their product.  They have a large humidor/aging room (a former meat
locker), where the finished product is stored in bundles.  Output is in the
low hundreds a day, so don't expect to see these in your local store soon.
But a visit to the factory is recommended to any cigar lover passing through
Sacramento, I'm sure you will find it a very pleasant experience.

Subject: A Few Words

Steve,

First, a belated congratulations.  I haven't been able to read
the last few Pipes Digests due to an enormous workload, but at
least my travels have allowed me to sample a couple Cuban cigars.

The Cubans were a "Romeo y Julieta" and a "Dunhill".  I was a
little surprised by the Dunhill label, but not being well-
versed in cigars, maybe you can help.  There was nothing
distinguished about it, especially compared to the "Romeo y
Julieta" which was (IMHO) terrific.  Please be aware, that was
my very first Cuban.

Now, a question.  Since I seem to be transfering planes in both
Frankfurt and Amsterdam, does anyone know where in the airports
I can find the Cubans for sale?  I've been very rushed and have
not been able to search those airports and they are just not
available at the Helsinki airport.

You raised an interesting point about having a dedicated smoking
room adjacent to non-smoking areas (such as dining and reception).
That would be a terribly civilized and relaxing conclusion to a
meal, something that many of us have considered.  But I rather
doubt that the U.S. culture would support it.  Next time, take
your vacation in Austria.  Stay outside Vienna for country charm
or in one of the numerous places in the oldest part of Vienna.
Then relax in one of the coffee houses.  What you described is
just what you get, as many relaxing hours in an overstuffed chair
with a beer, schnapps, cafe mit schlag, a newspaper, conversation,
peace and quiet, as anyone could ask for.

In fact, Europe just seems more relaxed.  Maybe because the culture
is centuries older, maybe because they don't try to legislate against
Natural Selection.

Best Wishes.

[ Thanks, Brian!  Perhaps the Cubans are no further than the duty free
shop. -S. ]

Subject: Smoking in San Diego; FDA and Kessler

     Steve--Time to thank you once again for the Digest and 
     congratulate you on your nuptials.  I've been subscribed for a 
     little over half a year and always enjoyed seeing the mailing 
     from your address in the mailbox.
     
     I am writing to mention some smoking I enjoyed on ny vacation to 
     San Diego at the end of August.  I went to law school and met my 
     wife there, back in the 80's, so I was already familiar with most 
     of the area's smoke shops.  One of my favorites was Captain 
     Hunt's in Seaport Village (a little tourist shopping center on 
     the water near downtown).  As I mentioned in my introductory post 
     several months ago, my favorite pipe tobacco of all time is an 
     English called "Churchill" which I have found nowhere else (so I 
     believe it's proprietary, although I could be wrong).  I was able 
     to get a pouch and although it is still a great smoke, somehow it 
     had a different character.  Churchill was my first English, and 
     as Richard Hacker wrote, an English can be a bit like smoking 
     meat (which still makes me laugh).  I was wondering if by now 
     (several years of smoking Englishes, later), I have become 
     accustomed to the Latakia and am more appreciative of the other 
     blend constituents?  Or is it possible for a commercial blend to 
     be changed without notice?  Anybody have any thoughts?
     
     On the FDA, Kessler, and some of the commentary from recent 
     Digests, I thought I would add a thought or two.  First, make no 
     mistakes, I am fully aware of the fear that the FDA's attention 
     to tobacco will inevitably lead to total prohibition.  I am 
     somewhat sympathetic to that point of view because there are 
     analogous precedents in other areas (like government promoted 
     censorship).
     
     I think a few mistakes of perception must be mentioned, though.  
     First, in response to Steve J.:  The FDA's regulatory authority 
     is justified under the "police power" of the state.  That 
     authority legally imbues a government with the ability to pass 
     regulations which affect the "health, safety, and welfare" of the 
     populace.  Such regulations are deemed important to the extent 
     that a reviewing court need only find a "rational relationship" 
     (a low legal threshold) between the regulation and the health, 
     safety, or welfare issue that is at stake for a police power 
     regulation to be upheld on challenge.  So Steve is a bit 
     overwrought in suggesting that FDA Commissioner Kessler is 
     seeking police power for the FDA.
     
     Second, while regulation of tobacco might be a "de facto" result 
     of any action by this administration, the regulation at issue 
     concerns the issue of whether a)nicotine is a drug, and b)whether 
     cigarette makers manipulate nicotine content of cigarettes.  The 
     regulation, then, would address the cigarette as a *delivery 
     device* for nicotine, and enable the government to intervene in 
     the selling of the device to (in this case) minors.
     
     The reason I though it important to risk a flame war and bring 
     these points up is that I support the use of public comment to 
     communicate with both legislators and agencies.  Before anyone 
     runs off halfcocked and starts filling my box with expletive 
     mail, let me say one last thing.  I have been smoking pipes and 
     cigars regularly for 17 years or so.  I relish this pleasure and 
     will never relinquish it to someone for their satisfaction at the 
     expense of my own.  However, if you want to effectively take part 
     in the public process, you have to assert yourself credibly or 
     risk being marginalized.  I hope everyone reads my comments in 
     the right spirit.
     
     Sincerely, Dave Hirsh, Seattle, WA. USA

[ A most thoughtful and reasoned commentary, Dave; you seem to know
your subject.  However, under a similar argument, the FDA could
intervene in the sale of cans of Coca-Cola or cups of 7-11 coffee as
"delivery devices" for caffeine.  Even if it is supported by law, the
FDA's assertion of jurisdiction over tobacco is not comforting; they
might, having finished with cigarettes, make the same "delivery
device" assertion about cigars or pipes.

And see the "Quote of the Week" below. -S. ]

&gt;I do especially like the long, churchwarden clays.  The long stem delivers
&gt;a nice cool smoke.  They are difficult to clean, however.

I don't know how widely available they are, but when I bought my
churchwarden, the store also sold super-long pipecleaners especially made
for it...

Subject: Canadian Pipe Shop-Kingston area

Gord Ferguson's assessment of Kingston's The Pipe and Pouch in the last PD
is accurate in all respects but that of the owner's name.  The Pipe and
Pouch is owned by MIKE Fagan, not Bill Fagan.  Bill is Mike's father and
often tends the store when Mike is out on errands.  Interestingly enough,
Mike happens to be on Rex Poggenpohl's list of american pipe makers (said
list immediately preceeds Gord's description of the P and P in last weeks
digest)!  I own several of Mike's pipes and one of them, made of Ethiopian
bubinga wood, is the sweetest smoking pipe in my collection.  It also has
a bowl large enough to eat soup out of- maybe there's a connection? 
Anyway, I heartily second Gord's endorsement of the Pipe and Pouch and
have smoked many a
hand-rolled cigar in one of Mike's overstuffed chairs.

[ Thanks for the clarification; I had his name as Mike in the Guide,
and wanted to confirm that. -S. ]

Subject: Inns For Smokers

Further to your search for B&amp;B's that permit smoking. . .

The Pelican Inn in Muir Beach, CA (in Marin County just north of the Golden
Gate Bridge) is an old British inn with leaded glass windows, thick-timbered
ceilings, low-beamed door, old iron latches, clean white plaster and
well-worn dark wood floors.  It has 5 or 6 guest rooms, each different but
usually including a high or canopied bed, antique sideboards, Olde English
tapestries and decorations, and a sublime view out over the flowered lawn
toward the Muir Woods.  Downstairs is a characterful dining room with long
rough-hewn tables, a huge stone fireplace, and much heavy pewter.  The menu
is unfailingly British and a fine place for lamb, prime rib, and bangers
with stewed tomatoes in the morning.  Off the entry is a small
honest-to-goodness pub, with a healthy selection of ales and stouts.  Some
evenings this pub becomes quite lively with the local Britophiles and
various dart teams, while other times it is a quiet place for a tasty ale
and a chat with the bartender.  And, getting to the point, the inn reserves
a private sitting room for guests, furnished with antique tables, deep soft
chairs, and a roaring fireplace.  On our last stay, although all the guest
rooms were full we were the only ones using the sitting room, where we
played whist and drank ale (the pub being only a door away) while a heavy
rain fell outside.   I recall -- although anyone planning a stay should
double-check!!! -- that smoking was permitted in the private sitting room
and the pub.  As you can tell, this is one of my favorite places in the
whole world and if anyone on the list chooses to stay there I hope it's not
when I need a room.  The only downside, alas, is the price which currently
hovers around $200 a night.  Don't have the phone number but its listed in
Information.

Subject: Another Inn For Smoking

Here's another inn where smoking is permitted.  The Griswold Inn in Essex,
CT, is the oldest inn in the United States, or so they say.  It is a
beautiful old collection of white-sided New England buildings with a variety
of guest rooms ranging from smallish to mediumish, but all filled with charm
and comfort.  The dining room encompasses several large book-lined library
rooms and the menu is very fine.  The adjacent pub has a corner from where
musicians, some rather odd, occasionally play for guests at the several
round tables.  One night the entertainment was some rather proficient
spoon-playing, and I noticed a board behind the bar where regulars
apparently kept their spoons.  The bar itself is large and long and backed
with all manner of liquors, local New England beers and ales, and the
indispensable Guiness Stout.  I don't recall that smoking was permitted in
the guest rooms, although there were no loud signs to that effect, but the
pub is a very pleasant place to idle away an evening, nursing a quiet
pipeful and slowly drawing on a Guiness.  In fact, that is where I was first
introduced to pipe-smoking.

I guess the Griswold is more of an "inn" than a B&amp;B, but the prices are
reasonable and I'd just as soon stay there, with the fine food, good ale,
and mellow company, than at a B&amp;B.


[ Thanks for both of your letters, John!  Both places sound most
pleasant. -S. ]

Subject: [PIPES] [CIGARS]

Hello Steve,

  When I opened my e-mail this morning and saw PD #200 waiting for me, I
thought, "Holy mackerel!  Has it been 3 weeks already?"  Checking back to
#199 I saw that indeed it has.  Where does the time go?

  Congratulations on your marriage!  I wish you both a life of joy and
contentment.

  Well, I'm feeling real accomplished.  It took me over 5 months to do so,
but I've finally read all the back issues of the Digest.  Do I get a gold
star or something?  (No, probably not--how would you send a gold star via
e-mail?)  I'm kind of sorry that I'm done, however, because now I don't
have anything to look forward to at the end of a long day when I just
hanging around waiting for my commuter shuttle to pick me up.  Oh well,
maybe I can start over or use the keyword search to read articles on the
same subject or something.

  September has been full of smoking adventures and I though I'd summarize
a couple.  First of all, I was in a local mall shop which consisted of 80
percent gift items (of the pewter, Harley-Davidson,
beautiful-Indian-maiden-with-her-pet-wolf variety) and 20 percent
tobacco-related items.  They had a small humidor and I was picking out a
few premium cigars for my enjoyment, when the sales person pointed out
bundles of Honduran hand-mades that were on sale for $14.95 claiming they
were very good cigars.  I decided to try them, and indeed they are pretty
good--especially when one considers they only cost 60 cents apiece.  I've
smoked $7 cigars that I didn't like as well.  Anyway, the moral of this
story is, I plan on trying bundles again.  Oh sure, the color of the
wrapper doesn't always exactly match, and yes, there may be a blemish on
the wrapper that doesn't show up in a premium, but they smoke well.  So, if
any of the PD readers are looking for an inexpensive, yet good cigar, they
might try buying a bundle from the country of their choice.

  A couple of weeks ago I went to the L.A. Pipe and Cigar Expo.  Steve
Johnson will, no doubt, provide the Digest with a full report.  But let me
just say that I was certainly impressed.  Just imagine a hotel ballroom
full of people from all walks of life coming together because of their
common interest and delight in tobacco and the various ways it can be
smoked.  Lots of pipes on display, lots of cigar manufacturers on hand,
lots of high grade Scotch and Irish whiskeys to be sampled, lots of
friendly people.  I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.  (As an aside, I
saw a play last Friday called 'I Hate Hamlet' in which John Barrymore comes
back from the dead to tutor our hero on playing Hamlet.  The young man asks
Barrymore if one can smoke in heaven.  Barrymore replies,  "Of
course...it's heaven!"  My sentiments exactly.)  I bought myself a couple
of Paul Perri pipes.  These are hand carved by Paul, a retired tobacconist
who still carves mainly as a hobby, out of very nice wood.  I bought 2
pipes for--get this--$92!  I told Paul I thought his prices criminally low
(of course, I said this after I safely tucked my purchases away).  They're
easily worth two to three times what he charges.  Oh well, if he wants to
sell me a hand-carved, straight-grained briar with no visible flaws for
$60, I guess I'll just have to put up with it.

  Anyway, I enjoyed the expo and was sorry I could only stay 5 hours.  I
even missed the banquet (sob).  I highly recommend to anyone in the
vicinity to stop in next year.

  Someone a couple of issues backed asked what the difference was between
'natural' and 'maduro' cigar wrappers.  Although one could quote at length
on the various shades of  wrappers (everything from claro claro to obscuro
maduro), suffice it to say that natural is light to medium brown, and
maduro is dark brown.  Maduro is fermented for a longer period of time
which imparts the darker color and also a more full-bodied flavor.  As a
result, maduro cigars have the reputation of being "strong."  However,
everything is relative, and I've smoked maduros that were quite mellow.

  I guess I've rambled on enough for now.  (My excuse is that I haven't
submitted in a while, so I thought I'd make up for lost time; however, in
all probability, the real reason is that I just like to babble.)  Again,
congrats on your marriage.

[ Thanks! After five weeks, it's still great. :-) -S. ]

Subject: NJ Pipe Clubs &amp; a new addition

Steve,

First, let me send a slightly belated congratulation to you and Jean.  May you 
have many, happy years together.

Next, are there any pipe clubs in the North / Northwest New Jersey or East 
Pennsylvania (i.e. Pocono Mt.) area?  I've seen several cigar clubs in Cigar 
Aficianado, but no Pipe clubs.  I work in central Jersey (Somerset/Piscataway) 
and live up by the Deleware Water Gap, so would like to find a club in that 
general area - New York City is a heck of drive home with no trains available 
:-(.  Please let me know if anyone knows of one.

Finally, I'd like to mention the latest addition to my collection, a Stanwell 
Hans Christian Anderson sandblast.  Purchased at John David, Ltd. in Menlo 
Park Mall, it is a beautiful straight (it actually has a slight curve to it) 
that comes with 2 bits - a smaller, "normal" bit and a churchwarden bit.  
I've always wanted to try a churchwarden, but figured it would not get a lot 
of use and didn't want to invest a lot of money in one since my collection is 
currently rather small.  This pipe solved my dilemma. It smokes wonderfully 
and comes with a special canister and a green Stanwell shopping bag (for the 
wife, as the owner suggested).  It is also available in a very attractive 
smooth, which IMHO looks better in the standard length than the sandblast, but 
the opposite is true as a churchwarden.  I'm looking forward to enjoying it by 
the fire once those winter snows hit.

Thanks for letting me gush...

Smoke in peace,

Jake

[ Please let me know too! -S. ]

Subject: Pipes

Steve, here's another article from the September Ohio Pipe Collectors
newsletter that I'd like to share with you and your subscribers.  Pipemaker
Steve Anderson of S&amp;R, who heard Doug deliver the speech, was the first to
alert me to it.  The OPC now stands at 90 members, but we're still actively
recruiting, and I welcome e-mail requests for information or complimentary
newsletters.
 
A NEW TAKE ON DR. GRABOW
 
     Doug Allen, OPC member and President of Sparta Industries, delivered
the following speech at the 1995 PCI show in St. Louis.  Hearing about it,
I prevailed upon Doug to let it appear in print first in the OPC
newsletter, and he graciously agreed. Reader comments and replies are
encouraged.
 
                     The Honorable Dr. Grabow
 
                            Doug Allen
 
     This evening, gathered with this large group of pipe lovers, I'd like
to honor the greatest of pipes--Dr. Grabow.  Surely, you're saying, I must
have taken leave of my senses to call Dr. Grabow the greatest of pipes.
Well, I've made a claim, so let me try to justify my outrageous statement.
 
     In our country, one measure of greatness has always been size: the
bigger, the better; the more, the merrier.  Dr. Grabow sells nearly one
million pipes a year.  But, you argue, certainly in this case more is not
necessarily merrier.  Simply because the masses smoke a Dr. Grabow doesn't
mean it should be classed as a great pipe. Certainly, you insist, a Dr.
Grabow cannot be judged as comparable to the Mastro de Paja that my good
friend Thomas Cristiano is showing this weekend.  Nor would anyone compare
the collectability of a Dr. Grabow to Steve Anderson's handmades.  Why then
am I standing here talking about Dr. Grabow?  Can it be the construction?
 
     Yes, in many ways the methods of making a Dr. Grabow are exactly the
same as those the fine Italian artisans employ.  Of course there are
differences.  We don't spend as much time sanding a Dr. Grabow as the
Lorenzetti Brothers might, for example.  Our bits, though we use some
lucite, may not be as fancy as Cesare Barontini produces for our
Mastercraft Aldo Velani line.  The most similar feature between a Dr.
Grabow and the exquisite pipes many of you are smoking tonight is the wood.
Every Dr. Grabow pre-smoked pipe starts with exactly the same block of
briar as does your favorite.  Yet this lowly block of wood is why I speak
about the greatness of Dr. Grabow.
 
     Before I finish that thought about Dr. Grabow, let me talk for a few
minutes about the wood.  The White Heather (Erica Arborea) grows in the
sandy soil of the mountains ringing the Mediterranean Sea.  After about
five hot summers and mild winters, a small fibrous growth starts forming
just above the roots.  After many years (even centuries) of growth, the
burl is ready to be harvested.  This harvest is a time-consuming,
back-breaking job.  During one trip to Greece, I clambered over the hills
to observe the workers (paid by the weight of their finds) dig these burls
using only a pick and lots of elbow grease.  Thansis, a typical worker,
uses his family burro to move his wood about 15 kilometers to his meeting
spot with George Siderakis, the mill owner. The burls are washed and then
kept wet, to avoid splitting, until the cutter is ready to change the burl
into briar blocks. Imagine sitting in a loft all day with your feet
dangling down and an 18-inch saw blade whirling at a couple thousand RPMs
near your crotch.  If that isn't enough, the wood they're cutting is wet
and still a little muddy.  Do you remember the last time you tried to cut a
slightly damp 2x4?  It's tough, dirty work and the workers get paid only
for the usable block they cut during the long day.  As the blocks are cut,
the cutter grades the wood based on visible grain and imperfections
showing.  During all this, the wood must be kept wet.
 
     When a fairly large amount of cut wood has been accumulated, it is
boiled in a large copper vat for 24 hours.  The boiling removes most of the
natural oils from the wood.  This is the beginning of the break-in process
for your new pipe.  Only after boiling can the wood-drying process begin.
At the saw mill, the cut blocks are allowed to dry for approximately 90
days.  After drying, the blocks are sorted by size and bagged for shipping
to a pipemaker.
 
     Once we receive a shipment of briar, we continue the drying in special
rooms for another 90 days minimum.  For the highest grade pipes, we dry the
wood for at least a year before turning and then another six months after
turning but before any sanding or other work.  This insures you the
easiest, most enjoyable break-in period and the most pleasurable smoking
experience overall.
 
     I know you think I've gotten off track by talking about how the wood
is harvested when I started talking about the greatness of Dr. Grabow
pre-smoked pipes.  The wood is the greatness of Dr. Grabow.  No, we don't
use all straight-grain, perfect blocks for Dr. Grabow.  Many of the more
perfect blocks are used in our production of the Alpha USA series and the
Blue Ridge Collection.  Because we buy almost all the world's production of
non-straight-grain and less-than-perfect briar blocks, the price of your
favorite Dunhill is only in the thousand-dollar neighborhood, or you only
have to pay several hundred dollars or more for that exquisite Mastro de
Paja.
 
     We buy slightly over half the world's total briar wood production.  If
it weren't for the Dr. Grabow drug-store pipe, the briar wood industry
along the Mediterranean sea would all but disappear.  This in turn would
drive up the price of wood far beyond what the market would allow, thus
ending the pipe business as we know it today.  We know this is true
because, eight years ago, Sparta Industries found itself vastly overstocked
with briar and quit buying for three years.  During that time, six of 21
small briar-processing factories--29% of the total--closed their doors, and
five of them did not re-open when we began buying briar again after three
years.
 
     So, as with many things in our world, our small, humble entry into the
market paves the way for the rest.  Richard Nixon coined a phrase that
perfectly describes Dr. Grabow--the silent majority.
 
     Don't misunderstand me.  Even though Dr. Grabow is a great pipe, I
still save my pennies in hopes of one day affording one of Tom's beautiful
Mastro de Paja pipes.  But I hope that, while you puff on your favorite,
you'll more fully appreciate the role Dr. Grabow plays in the world of
smoking pipes.

If you've got one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you've got more than
one, you're a pipe collector.

Subject: OPC Pipe Show

Steve, while I'm still feeling on top of the world, I'd like to give you a
brief report on the OPC swap/sell pipe show that took place this past
Saturday on Sept. 23.  Bottom line is, it was terrific.  We rented all 40
available tables to dealers of various sorts, including Nikos and Marsh
Levin of NML Pipes Direct, Jack Ehrmantraut of PCI, Ken Layden of Sparta
Industries, pipemakers Steve and Roswitha Anderson, Steve Weiner and Tim
West and a host individual collectors.  Thousands of beautiful pipes were
spread out and hundreds were sold, bought and traded.  We estimate that as
many as 400 people came through the doors, and the OPC made enough money so
that, for the first time, I can quit worrying about the cost of printing
and mailing my newsletter, which just keeps getting bigger (and, I hope,
more interesting and information filled).  We also signed up 17 new
members, bringing our grand total to 90.  The smoking contest (won by Jim
Tedesco, who finished second at the PCI show in St. Louis) was a hit, as
was the raffle (50 cents a ticket and a free ticket for every pipe
purchased), which consisted of 43 distinct items with a retail value of
just under $2,000.
 
It was a hectic day for me as I scurried about like a mother hen trying to
ensure that everything went smoothly and also to sell a few of my own
pipes, but tremendously gratifying.  Everybody I talked to--dealers and
public--seemed to be having a great and rewarding time.
 
I was especially gratified to meet Neil Murray, publisher of the
Agricultural &amp; Mechanical Gazette (yes, it's a pipe magazine for those of
you who don't know), who drove down from Michigan and who isn't nearly as
strange in person as you might think from reading his mag.  Neil even
walked off with a can of McClelland tobacco raffle prize and seemed quite
pleased.
 
Everything went so well that we have already nailed down August 24, 1996,
as the date for our 1996 show--same place but with enough room this time to
hold 65 dealer tables.  I urge everyone to note this in their calendars and
make plans to attend.  We promise a bigger and better show next year, with
more dealers, pipe shops, pipe companies and individuals and with even more
raffle prizes.
 
Thanks for your help in publicizing this event and the Ohio Pipe Collectors
(which is not limited to people in Ohio--we have five members from out of
the States) over the past several months. All of us owe you a great debt of
gratitude for the job you're doing.  Remember that when your energies start
to
flag.

If you've got one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you've got more than
one, you're a pipe collector.

Subject: Inexpensive Hondurans

Steve--
Some subscribers are looking for an inexpensive Honduran cigar.  I
recommend La Primadora. You can get a bundle of 25 for under $20. I've
tried the Starbrite (a robusto, 4.5x50) and the Petite Cetro (5.5x42)
and I love them.  They also have a Churchill and other sizes.  All
come in natural or maduro.  You can't go wrong.

Congrats on your marriage.

Pleasant smoking,

Sheldon Richman

Dear Steve,

I have been receiving Pipes Digest for almost a year now and I think it is
a terrific resource. My e-mail address has recently changed to
????????@??????????.???. I also have an important question I would like to
ask. I have recently moved to an area of the country that lacks a good
cigar store and I have convinced some people to help me open a place that
smokers can sit and enjoy their heaters as well as find a great selection
of their favorite smokes. How can I find a list of cigar manufacturers to
build my inventory? What would be my main concerns as a cigar store owner?

Thanks, your loyal subscriber,

Lewis Carpenter
????????@??????????.???

[ I'd say two large concerns would be finding a suitable location and
making sure that your market will support the shop. You might want to
chat with Jorge of "A Little Taste," above, who seems to have
succeeded in doing what you're trying to do. -S. ]

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #200 -- September 27, 1995

Hello Steve and all,

PD #200 had a listing of 20th  century US Pipemakers which included the Owl
Shop and two possible locations.

While I try to avoid Worcester, Mass., at all costs, I know that there is
indeed an  Owl Shop in New Haven, Conn. on College Street across from the
Shubert Theater. Unfortunately I don't have the exact street number. They
publish a catalog and mail order of their products is available. They offer
about a dozen varieties of tobacco under their own label. Having a
preference to English blends, I consume their Patterson's Mixture and
Harkness Tower. Never having gone there to acquire a pipe, I can't say
whether they offer briars bearing their own marque.

There is also a walk-in humidor which is a cigar smoker's paradise.

Regards

Roy Zartarian

Subject: Nording and other things

        I was lucky enough to catch a fine brace of Nording freehands at
the local Tinder Box (they're fairly hard to come by here in Columbus).  A
matched set for my wife and myself.  I know - how cute.  But here's how I
see it.  I am 24.  If I collect pipes for the next 50 years, and I have 20
pipes now, I will have a very, very nice collection.  If I have a fifty
year old set of signed Nording freehands that are _matched_ ... I will be a
very, very happy man.  Wouldn't we all?

        I was surprised to see the Don Juan cigars rate among the Cubans in
the last Cigar Aficionado (with, I believe, an 89).   Though my latest has
been the Hemingway Signature, I thought I'd give my checkbook a break and
try a few Don Juans.  I was pleasantly surprised with the powerful, spicy
flavor and the firm draw.  I smoked the Robusto, not the Churchill; I am
very anxious to try the Churchill.  It does seem to remind me of the one
Cuban I have smoked.  Ah well ... Let's all hope for the end of the
embargo!

        I was very pleased to see Old Cave back in the Ohio wine stores -
though the new bottle threw me for a loop.  I wonder how many times I have
missed it whilst digging through the wine racks of Columbus?  For those of
you who haven't tried Chateau Reynella's Fine Old Tawny, little is better
with a fine cigar or your favorite pipe.  In fact, I am enjoying Sherlock
in my new Nording with a glass of Old Cave right now.  Old Cave is a very
deep port, with several layers of fruit, raisin, plum and tobacco.  I am
not a wine expert (I'm not an anything expert) but this port is really fine
with tobacco.  Anytime you're in Columbus, look me up and we'll share a
glass.

        I feel fortunate to own a new Tim West churchwarden.  Really, a
fine pipe.  It is my first churchwarden.  I now can read and smoke a pipe
without having my TMJ act up!  The pipe is long enough and cool enough to
sit in the crook of my elbow while I smoke.  It smokes best with Dunhill's
early morning.  That wasn't surprising, until I met Tim at the Columbus
Pipe Swap put on by Regis and Bill's Ohio Pipe Collectors.  It seems that
many of his pipes smoke best with Early Morning.  In fact, that became
quite a topic of discussion amongst some of us and it was determined that
every pipe of his that we had smoked smokes best w=00=00=00=00=00=00=05=EAy =
Morning.
Coincidence?  I don't think so!!  Perhaps Tim has a deal with Dunhill ...

        I was very pleased with the Columbus Pipe Show held last week.
Having just paid tuition for myself and my wife, I didn't buy more than a
used pipe case for five bucks.  However, I finally met Regis, Bill and Neil
Murray who is the editor of the Agricultural &amp; Mechanical Gazette.  Anyone
who doesn't already subscribe to this fine publication, should.  You can
reach Neil at 47758 Hickory St. #22305 in Wixom, MI 48393.  It is a well
written and edited journal for all pipe smokers.  Similar to this one!

        I also participated in my first pipe smoking competition at the
show.  I learned one lesson - don't get to talking about any serious
subject.  My inattention led to a beatable record of 16 minutes.  Next
time, I guess.

        Well, I've taken enough time away from Propositional Calculus for
one night.  Has anyone noticed that the difficulty of the course is
inversely related to the number of credit hours it is worth?  Shouldn't it
not be that way?  I tool Accounting, didn't study and get a B+.  Five
credit hours.  I took Marketing, worked my butt off and get a B+.  Four
credit hours.  I am taking Prop Calc.  I am reading, reviewing previous
math courses, and doing homework every night and every day.  Three credit
hours.  Figure it out.

        Until next time, gentlemen, I remain

                                                Sincerely Yours,

                                                Sempf

&gt; Subject: Tobacco shop in New Orleans

&gt; My favorite tobacco store here in New Orleans is the Epitome.  They are 
&gt; located at 729 St. Louis Street, next to Antoine's in the French Quarter.  
&gt; They are a dealer for Dunhill and they have a variety of pipes in all price 
&gt; ranges.

Are they still charging over $3 for an Arturo Fuente Chateau Fuente?

&gt; From: ????????@???.???????.??? (Steve Masticola)
&gt; Subject: The Bed and Breakfast Circuit

&gt; The B&amp;Bs seem to be generally an antismoking lot.  And, although Nova
&gt; Scotia is reported to be a home to puffins, I'm glad I didn't see any
&gt; of them.  If I had encountered one, after three thousand miles of
&gt; cutesy "No Puffin" signs, I might have been tempted to thoughts of
&gt; avicide...

We did the Nova Scotia B&amp;B thing last summer.  Those pufffin signs are 
*truly* obnoxious.

&gt; SALMON RIVER HOUSE, Head of Jeddore, NS:  The circle-slash-puffin
&gt; again.  However, the river plus an Adirondack chair made a welcome
&gt; place for a pipe.  Featured a great blue heron which had the maddening
&gt; habit of posing for a picture, then disappearing when I went for the
&gt; camera. 

Yes!  We stayed there too.  I probably sat in that same Adirondack chair 
with my pipe one evening.  I stayed and smoked until the sun went down.

&gt; I hope that someday I can find _some_ B&amp;B or inn which features a
&gt; comfortable indoor smoking room. 

I truly don't believe they exist. 

By the way, congratulations on the nuptials.

[ Thanks, Rick! BTW, the pictures I took of the sunset at Salmon River
turned out goregeous; my equipment was a Nikon 6006, 35-80mm lens,
Kodacolor Gold 400, Bogen monopod, Peterson "Sherlock Holmes," and
MacBaren "Golden Extra."  And see John Liu's letter above; some
pipe-friendly inns _do_ exist, and they need our support if they are
not to be overtaken by the noisome puffin signs!  -S. ]

Hi Steve, Congrats on the wedding. This is my "alternate" address and I 
would appreciate it if yopu could change my subscription to the Digest 
from ???????@??? to ?????@????.???. Thanks. I finally got to use the 
resource guide on a recent business trip to Ohio and, I must say, it was 
a lifesaver (for a pipesmoker, anyway). Finding myself in Dayton and 
running low on a good English blend, I found the Tobacco Wharf listed 
and stopped by for a visit. I thought I'd gone to pipe smoker's heaven 
because there are no shops around here of this caliber B-{(. I looked a 
round for a bit and struck up a conversation with the owner (Ron Houck) 
and his son (also Ron) and told them how I found out about them (Central 
PA check told them I wasn't a regular). I left with a great Irish second 
and an ounce of English blend and a satisfied grin. Anyone in that neck 
of the woods is encouraged to stop by for a pleasant conversation and 
great smoke.

Verlyn


[ Glad to have been of help! The address change should have been
confirmed. -S. ]

Subject: Owl Shop, New Haven

Hello again Steve,

This is a followup to my earlier message about the Owl Shop.  The mailing
address is :

        268 College Street
        New Haven, CT 06510

The telephone is (203)624-3250. Or, the area code may be changed to 860 - I
can't remember whether New Haven is one of the areas getting a new Conn.
area code.

The shop's own blends actually number twenty-five, not a dozen as I said
earlier.

Subject: Contact

Dear friends !
My name is Claudio Feo , I am a30 years old  Italian working in
International Aid business in Norway and writing to you from Oslo . 
I understand from a friend that yours is the address of a pipe smokers
E-mail . Well , if this is true....I am a pipe smoker ! I would be very
happy to get information from your mail . Living in Oslo  is  rather
frustrating when it comes to pipes and tobaccos . There is no pipe culture
in this town : only two decent shops where some tobaccoes and pipes can be
chosen . The only thing that helps is the vicinity of Denmark !
I am a dry English blend smoker at my 5th year of pipe smoking  ( never
smoked a cigarette in my life ), I have about 50 pipes , the best of them
are produced by Italian artisans .
I am looking forward to receive some information from you !
Thank you for your attention .

Best regards

Claudi Feo

Subject: Hello

Just a note to let you know that the next issue is under way.  I have
some really great photos from the ohio pipe show.  That was one of the
Best shows that I have attended.  Just tons of fun.  I met more Gazette
subscribers there, Ohio is BIG A&amp;M Gazette country.  Too bad you missed
all of the fun, but then you did have to run off and get married.  I met
so many people, Michael Stanley, Bill Unger, Bill &amp; Gabriella Sempf just
to name a few.  The Sempf's are a nice young couple and is Gabriella
ever cute?

    You never commented on your photo in the Gazette from the Big Smoke
in Washington.  Was it that bad or are you running ragged at work like
me?

Anyway, I am certainly going to attend all future Ohio Pipe Shows.  Even
if it is in Ohio, right next OSU.  I just have to hide my Michigan
plates on my car.  Columbus is really one of my favorite cities.  And
not just because there are so many pipe carvers in the general area.
There is an area of the city called the "German Village" which is
essentially the original founding core of the city.  REALLY GREAT German
restaurants and BEER can be found there.  The down town of Columbus
itself is interesting from a design perspective.  The old buildings are
really beautiful.
    Well, Take care.

Subject: My favorite pipe shop

Steve,

I have been very fortunate in life to visit some of the world's finest
pipe/tobacco shops.  Shops in London,  Amsterdam,  Geneva, Copenhagen,
Florence, Paris et al.  Some of these shops are overwhelming in terms of
their pipes, humidors, and accessories.  While visiting these shops,  my wife
holds on to my American Express card with both hands.  (She has this hangup
about financial solvency!)

I know that it's listed in the Resource Guide, but my favorite pipe shop is
Uhle's in Milwaukee.  The first time I entered Uhle's, I knew that I would
love it.  There were about a dozen customers inside.  Most of them were
smoking a pipe.  As I walked in, several of them either nodded in my
direction or murmured a greeting.  Store personnel bustled about; one of them
was smoking a maduro-wrapped churchill.  (I have been in an increasing number
of smoke shops that don't permit smoking in the store, not because of local
ordinances prohibiting it, but because non-smoking coffee-customers might be
offended.  Makes sense, huh?)

Uhle's has a plentiful supply of pipes and accessories.  They operate a small
tobacco factory, where they hand-blend their pipe tobaccos.  I have purchased
at least eight of their blends, aromatic and non-aromatic, and there wasn't a
beast in the bunch!  They offer over two dozen of their own blends.

Where I think that Uhle's Pipe Shop really shines is in their customer
service.  I'm the type of customer who places a premium on service before
price.  Though I have been in Uhle's a number of times, the fact that I live
in northern New England makes in-store visits an infrequent event.  Their
toll-free number (1-800-877-7024) makes ordering a cinch.  Readers should
keep in mind that each June, all pipes are 1/3 off the regular prices.  Last
June, I purchased a couple of pipes at Uhle's by phone.  The young lady who
took my call (I believe her name was Laurie) was patient and helpful.  She
steered me to a nifty Dunhill Dublin Tan Shell, and an E. Andrews Canadian.
 They are welcome additions to the quiver.  All of the personnel are
courteous and knowledgeable.  (I've done plenty of business with Peretti's of
Boston, for example.  They are certainly knowledgeable and expert blenders,
but a couple of them are a little grumpy and brusque.  As a result, I buy
less from Peretti's.)

There are great pipe shops in this country.  But IMHO, few can match Uhle's
for "smoking satisfaction."  Perhaps it's that Midwestern friendliness; I
don't know.  But Uhle's keeps my bowl lit just fine.

Congratulations, Steve, on your recent nuptials.  It appears that you have
far better taste (in a spouse) than your bride does.   ;)  Would you agree?
 I recall my own wedding night.  My beautiful bride complained to me that I
was a lousy lover.  I thought this was terribly unfair after only 30 seconds!

Subject: Please renew my subscription

Dear Steve,

As happens from time to time, email addresses change.  AOL was to expensive
and it took a long time to find a service that I wanted being busy with
other things during the summer.

I have missed not being able to recieve Pipes Digest and will probably look
for back issues.

Please restart my subscription at this address which I expect to be much
more permanent.

BTW, does anyone know where I can buy a box or 2 of Punch Prince Consort
Double Maduros.

Best Regards,
Stuart M. Altschuler

Subject: Great !!

Dear Steve and dear PD readers !
I just received the first PD mail .....very good .
I become a passionate pipe smoker 5 years ago . Obviously I spent most of
these years learning the fine art . I'm sure I still have a long way to go ,
but the endless discovery is part of every passion . 
As Italian I feel like a strange animal living in Oslo far from the warmth
and in a country where pipe smoking is one of the few things not subsidized
by the State . 
I work for a Norwegian humanitarian organization , my job is often taking me
to East Africa and in particular to
 S. Sudan . 
The first time I went to this forgotten and war ridden part of the world , I
discovered with great pleasure that many people ( as many as to name it a
culture ) are pipe smokers , in particular one of the main tribe : the dinkas .
They produce beautiful pipes whose bowls are made out of ebony . The
peculiarity and...believe the beauty , of the pipes are the mouthpieces
which are made out of  brass obtained melting bullets( they are not
difficult to find in a country that has been in war for 40 years !) .
Another funny detail of the S. Sudanese pipes is the protection inside the
bowl : to avoid the fast burning of the wood a tin sheet is placed inside
the bowl , the tin is obtained by the big tin of cooking oil that the people
receive as food aid !
 If anybody has resisted to this description , I guess that he would have an
obvious question : "What do they smoke?" " Cow dung !"  is the answer  .
Infact they mix cow dung with locally grown ( very scarce ) tobacco . 
Well I think this is enough from me as first mail .
It has been a pleasure to read of you and from you !

My regards 

Claudio

[ Well, that's something that the government not only can't regulate,
but produces for public consumption in mass quantities... Thanks for
the funny, Claudio! -S. ]

From: "George A. Gleason" &lt;??@????.???&gt;
Subject: PD submission

Steve-

I'd like to ask you to consider the following item for inclusion in Pipes
Digest; it's our Net press release on the Smoker's Rights Phone Card (60% of
our net, i.e. 10% of retail price, goes to organisations fighting against
tobak prohibition).  

I understand there's always controversy about something "commercial" on the
Net, but about that I'd say this:  Raising money for smokers' rights is
good.  Doing it by selling something is better because it can raise a lot
more and get publicity as well; people who wouldn't write a check to a
lobbying group would buy a product, as sales of environmental group T-shirts
at rock concerts demonstrate amply.  My friends &amp; I are telecom
professionals in a worker-owned corporation.  Telecom is what we do for a
living, so it makes sense to find a way to put that to the service of our
cause (stopping the prohibitionists).  A project of this scale *can't* be
done with volunteer labor; it simply takes tooo much time.  Therefore the
people working on it have to be paid for their time in one way or another
(unless they're independently wealthy; which we're not).  

Now if we were a nonprofit organisation, we'd pay our costs of labor by
going out and soliciting grant money.  However, we're not a nonprofit, so we
can't get grants.  What we *can* do is sell a product on a commercially
viable basis, and make it commercially viable for retailers to carry it.  So
that's what we're doing; and we're donating 60% of our net to the cause.  

You may notice that Greg Pease has been heavily involved with this project.
He knows all of the details of what we're doing, including our spreadsheets,
and we've all gotten to know each other quite well over this time; the point
being that you can write to him (or Marty Pulvers, who also is aware of this
and strongly supports it) for references on the project and on my partners
and I personally.  If you check out all the details on us and what we're
doing, I'm sure you'll find it worth supporting.  

thanks-

-George Gleason  (enclosure follows)

(PS, feel free to include the 2nd and 3d paragraphs of this note in PD if
you think it necessary to explain the whole "commercial" thing.)

===== enclosure ======

We have an announcement...

In order to help prevent tobacco prohibition, we've decided to call the
power of the free market to action. Use of the Smoker's Rights Phone Card
puts a percentage of your long-distance dollars toward fighting the campaign
currently being waged against tobacco and our freedom to enjoy it.

The Smoker's Rights Phone Card is produced by Liberty Telecom, a newly
formed subsidiary of IS&amp;N Inc., of Berkeley California.  Retail price is
competitive with other major carriers' long distance phonecards.
Appropriate discounts are available for tobacco distributors, retailers,
restaurateurs, and of course smokers' rights groups.

An oversight board including people in the trade will have full access to
our bookkeeping related to the phonecard, and will make decisions regarding
issues and organisations to fund.  Currently , the oversight board consists
of Marty Pulvers of Sherlock's Haven, Stephen Richman of Esoterica
Tobacciana and The Piedmont Tobacconist, and Dave Menache or Menache's, a
local restaurant / pub.  

The development team for the phonecard included Joel Sandler and I of IS&amp;N,
and Gregory Pease (a regular participant of this newsgroup) and Irwin
Friedman of Friedman &amp; Pease.  Jointly we developed the concept for the card
and the funding / oversight mechanism into a real product.  The first issue
of the card features a beautiful photograph of fine cigars.  Forthcoming
issues will feature other tobacco-related photos; we can also provide custom
photography and imprints for promotional use by tobacco shops etc.  

In light of the recent noise coming from Washington, it would seem that the
time is right for something that will generate funding and publicity for our
cause.  We believe that with good retail exposure and press coverage, this
card could prove that there is a significant demographic group of
aficionados of fine tobacco who are willing to stand up for our liberties.

(distributor and retailer pricing available; ditto for direct sale by
smokers' rights groups as a fund-raiser)

IS&amp;N / Liberty Tel can be reached at 510-644-8085, or send email to
???????@????????.???

===== end enclosure =====

Note: Steve, feel free to report this stuff any way you like, i.e. using our
text or not... the only thing I ask is, if there are any technical aspects
of this which aren't perfectly clear (e.g. how a debit phone card works),
I'd appreciate the opportunity to provide clear &amp; correct information.

-gg

[ No edits needed, George; I've placed it in the Resource Guide. Good
luck; sounds like a lot of good people are supporting this one! -S. ]

Subject: Info

Dear Steve;

Could you please include me in your *Pipe Digest*?

Also, a brief story if I may. I found a cigar www site that seemed quite 
interesting. However, as I am often leery of products being sold via the 
Internet, I was cautious. Fortunately, they are here in Miami so I paid 
them a visit. Well, as it turns out, they are a quaint little cigar shop 
that I passed so many times before (since 1962) but never noticed. There 
are 3 very very old Cuban cigar makers doing everything by hand. It turns 
out that a close (much younger) family member did a web page for them and 
takes orders via email or by calling a 1800 number. They make the cigars 
then ship them.

When I got back to the office I ordered via the web and got the same 
cigars (I ordered a bundle of #1 maduros) that I saw them make at the 
shop. They are very very good and very inexpensive. I've been a customer 
every since. (I still have them shipped to me even though we are in the 
same city.) So a happy/positive story from people that are doing an 
honest business with a fine Cuban cigar via the Internet.

They are at <a href="http://www.webcom.com/~cubacigr">http://www.webcom.com/~cubacigr</a>

Thank you and I look forward to receiving the digest.

        Steve:  I need some help identifying some pipes: I recently came
across two beautiful pipes that I assumed were Dunhills, great grain and a
small white dot on the stem, closer inspection revealed the initials JRV in
a samll oval and the word PERFECT beneath the oval.  Does anyone have any

<TITLE>Pipes Digest Article: 201.033</TITLE>
</head>
<body>
<pre>
From: "Robert C. Holmes" &lt;???????@????????.???&gt;
Subject: Introductory Posting

Hi Steve; I have now "digested" enough of the back issues of the
digest to get a sense for the etiquette, etc. and thought that I'd
introduce myself. At the outset let me echo the sentiments of most
subscribers in saying that your efforts in establishing and moderating
the Pipe Digest are much appreciated. Not only is it interesting to
"meet" other pipe smokers, but it is also nice to have a repository
for the technical information the Digest contains.
		I have been a confirmed pipe smoker for over 35 years
now. Like many of us I started smoking a pipe in College and have
continued more or less uninterrupted until now. I think there must be
a natural progression for pipe smokers/collectors which begins with
buying the cheapest possible pipe - throwing it away and buying a
better grade mass-produced pipe. Then one moves on to collecting lots
of medium grade pipes with the odd good one thrown in.  Finally you
reach the point where fewer but MUCH better is best! Over the years I
suppose I've owned 300+/- pipes but I'm now down to about
50. Luckily,before I retired, my job not only provided a reasonable
amount of disposable income, it also required a good deal of
travelling which meant that I got the chance to buy pipes all over
Canada, the U.S. and Britain. I don't miss the job, but I do miss
these opportunities.

		For the last 2-3 years I've restricted my purchases to
one or two "High End" pipes annually and I've now given up buying the
major brands in favour of purchasing from individual pipemakers like
David Jones, Jim/Debbie Cooke, etc. I find it much more satisfying to
actually talk to the pipemaker before, (and sometimes during), the
process. Not only does that give me a chance to be pretty specific
about what I want, it also results in a pipe which is truly personal.

		Rather than go on at length about what pipes I have,
what tobaccos I smoke, etc, I'll leave it there. If I think I have
something to contribute from time to time I'll do so, other than that
I'll "lurk" faithfully. In closing there is one area that I'd be
interested in hearing from others on and that is the subject of
"antique" tobacco blends. A number of manufacturers - most notably
Germaine and Sons (Esoterica Tobacciana) claim to produce blends in
the "old" style. Not having been around that long I'm not sure how one
determines that the blends are, in fact, faithful reproductions of
Victorian or Edwardian blends. I would be interested in hearing
from/about other manufacturers who are re-creating "antique" blends or
from anyone who has information about sources for true antique
tobacco.

		Again, many thanks for your efforts, Kind regards, Bob
Holmes.

Subject: Hello!!!

It's nice to find a place on the crazy world of Cyberspace devoted 
specifically to the pleasures of tobacco!  Let me introduce myself.  My 
name is Paul B. Smith, and I am a first year college student in Illinois. 
 I have had the pleasure to partake of cigars for app. 2 years now and I 
wish to move on to the domain of pipes.  I turned 18 on Monday, Oct. 09, 
but have been purchasing products since I was 16 without many problems.  
I read alot of great info. already but thought I would relay the msg. 
that this portion of the Internet has an avid new fan who looks forward 
to future knowledge which will be gained through Net services here at

Subject: Re: Pipes

Steve,  Congratulations on your nuptials.  I'm sure you know that 
beautiful, intelligent and tolerant nonsmokers represent a woefully small 
segment of the American population.  I found one such person, married her 
twenty-one years ago, and have no intention of having to find another.  I 
congratulate you on your good fortune.
 
Wednesday, September 27th was an extremely hectic day.  The day's events 
at the office confirmed Graham's Law of Organizational Pseudo-dynamics -- 
The Urgent always drives out the Important.  Upon returning home, I 
thought my day had turned around when I discovered that my order of 
tobacco from Cornell and Diehl had been delivered.  As I prepared to open 
the package, several family-members reminded me of pressing household 
responsibilities.  My first choice would have been to continue with my 
tobacco shipment.  However, I was over-ruled and reminded of Graham's 
Observation of Household Pseudo-democracy  --  SOMETIMES YOU LOSE THE 
VOTE, ONE TO NOTHING.  After nearly two hours of attending to these 
unanticipated and unwelcome tasks, I returned to my package.  Inside the 
cardboard box several bags of Craig's blends waited patiently for me.  I 
went into the next room to fetch a briar and as I returned the scent of 
the fragrant herb was filling the house.  It was then that my beautiful, 
intelligent and tolerant nonsmoking spouse reminded me that I promised to 
take her to see the brilliant Italian film, Il Postino, The Postman.  
Being a man of my word, I set the package aside.  
 
Although I would have preferred being elsewhere, the movie was most 
enjoyable.  However, I found myself quite distracted during a scene in 
movie when the local fishermen gathered at their village movie house to 
see the latest newsreels and smoke their pipes.  There I sat, smoke-free 
and insanely jealous.  Despite this distraction, the film was a most 
soul-satisfying experience.
 
I finally returned to my package at about 11:00 pm.  I filled a favorite 
briar with the great anticipation that can only come from unfulfilled 
expectations and denied satisfaction.  I began the first satisfying 
puffs, and decided to check my e-mail with my new Macintosh computer.  
Previously, all of my electronic activities, including reading Pipe 
Digest, have occurred in a smoke-free office environment.  I was 
relishing the opportunity to catch up on my correspondence while enjoying 
the long denied smoke.  I put a new Pierre Bensusan compact disk in the 
drive and sat back leisurely puffing and basking in the warm glow of the 
CRT.  Low and behold, there waiting for me was Pipe Digest #200.  Take 
courage fellow followers of the sacred herb, it is possible to lose every 
battle, and still win the war.

Subject: hookahs

Dear Steve-

There has been some some talk of hookah smoking in the digest lately, and
some question as to what is traditionally added to the water to scent or
flavor it.  Yes, it's arrak (sp), and it is an alcoholic beverage (not just
a scent or cologne as was guessed) made from dates.  Cool, huh?  Sounds
like it would be pretty nasty with latakia...

Happy puffin,
Patrick North
PS-"Happy puffin" would refer to my hope that your future smokes are good
ones,                           not a "pleased penguin."

	I have been reading at random about 20 of your Pipes 
Digest Pages.  I like the forum?, area?, web site?, very much. 
I have been smoking pipes, cigars and cigarettes for 35 years. 
The cigs. are an early habit, the pipes and cigars are pure 
pleasure and two that I have been enjoying for over 30 years.  
I have about 100 pipes in my collection, and a homemade 
humidor of Vermillion (Paduk wood), that holds about 500 
cigars.  Some of them are 15 years old, that I have aged, 
babied, and pampered, and only share with special friends. 
Mainly those friends that I have had longer than the 
Cigars.The humidor is actually double walled, the interior 
walls made of 3/8's inch Spanish Cedar.  I haave read that 
some readers are trying to make their own humidors, and hope 
that they are not trying to use liners or wood other than 
Spanish Cedar, because they will end up with some odd tasting 
Cigars to say the least. Only Spanish Cedar will improve the 
taste of fine cigars, and allow them to improve with ageing.
I have to sign off for now, but I shall return.

Subject: Ghost Storyteller Secret

The following pipe related story is excerpted from an article in the
Birmingham Post Herald of 10/20/95 titled "TANGLED WEBS: Ghost-story tellers
share their secrets", written by Rebecca Taylor.  The subject of the excerpt
is Kathryn Tucker Windham, an Alabama author with a wonderful series of
southern ghost story collections to her credit, and an accomplished
storyteller.
******************************************************************************

     Maybe some can do it better than others, but Mrs. Windham insists that
everyone is a storyteller.  When she is onstage, she says, she never uses
spooky voices or sound effects;  she just tries to be herself.
     "My father was a wonderful storyteller, and I grew up listening to him
tell stories and listening to other good storytellers on our front porch,"
she says.  "And they just told straightforward stories; they told things the
way they happened."
     "I hope I kind of do it the way he did.  It was natural for him."
     Mrs. Windham says she often pauses when she is telling a story - not for
dramatic effect, but because it seemed natural.
     "I never realized why I did that until a few months ago.  Somebody said
to me, 'You know why you pause?'  And I said, 'Well, no, not really.'
     They said, 'Well, it's because of your father, his timing.  He smoked a
pipe, and he paused to puff on his pipe, and you're pausing for exactly the
same length of time that it would take to puff on a pipe.'  It had never
occurred to me."

******************************************************************************
And she is a great storyteller, find one of her audio tapes or videos and
enjoy a bowl of your favorite tobacco with some good southern ghost stories
for Halloween!

[ What a wonderful idea! And, BTW, it is rumored that a good smoke
will help to keep at bay the ghosties and goblins and long-leggedy
beasties and and things that go bump in the night...-S. ]

<TITLE>Pipes Digest Article: 202.002</TITLE>

<body>
<pre>
From: Jason Vagner &lt;?????@???.???&gt;
Subject: An introduction

	Hi Steve.

	I've been reading the digest for quite a while now, and I may have made
a hasty introduction before, but now I have the urge to send in something
longer with the excuse of re-introducing myself to the fellow Piper's.

	My name is Jason Vagner and I'm a 24-year old cigar fan living in Tempe
AZ (yes, home of the next SuperBowl, I can see the stadium from my house and
from the way this town is acting, it's as if the Big Game is next week). I'm a
writer with an English degree working as a system/network administrator for
Arizona State University. Along with my roommate Greg Nigh, we the founders of
AIDS Authority, a non-profit organization supporting those researching or
seeking more information on the scientific position that HIV is neither
sufficient nor necessary to cause that which is commonly referred to as "AIDS".
(No, we don't assert that people *aren't* suffering from some
immuno-suppressive condition, it's just something a little different, and not
entirely understood). For more information on this specifically, please check
<a href="http://www.aidsauthority.org.">http://www.aidsauthority.org.</a>

	There is a tie-in, though, to smoker's rights. We have three different
levels of discourse that we as AIDS Authority develop. The third and most
"academic" includes a concern that our current medical industrial complex has
gotten into the habit of "medicalizing" normal physical functions, mitigating
the state known as "healthy", and gaining jurisdiction over normal bodily
processes. This is then backed by legislative support.

	How this actually works with regards to tobacco is another matter,
though. Normally, our discourse applies to pharmaceuticals and the medical
system applying drugs and substances to bodies. This debate is different in
that those attacked are organizations manufacturing substances with ostensibly
adverse affects on the body. Personally, as a cigar smoker (with a desire to
get into pipes) I see this kind of tobacco as quite different from cigarettes
and chewing tobacco. The "organizations" that manufacture each product work in
very different ways. How many *major* tobacco organizations own hand-made cigar
manufacturers? (I actually don't know, so I don't mean this as a rhetorical
question).

	But, AIDS Authority doesn't concern itself with tobacco at all. I was
just rambling about the connection, politically speaking, between the efforts
of one of my concerns and this situation that smokers are dealing with.

	On a personal, puffing note: being a 24 year old cigar smoker has its
expected drawbacks. Even though I'm now a clean cut guy (and no longer the
long-hair I was up till the beginning of this summer), I still find it
difficult not to be eyed suspiciously in the more traditional smoke shops.
Perhaps it's just the local proprietors here in Phoenix, but I've unfortunately
found that the most welcome atmosphere to be the local "head shop" which
happens to have acquired a walk-in humidor from the neighboring liquor store
that it bought out. The novelty of fine cigars in such a store has created
quite a curiosity among shop keeper and customers alike. But I share the
disgust of my friend, who used to work there, at being in line with my cigars
with the same folks buying crack pipes and other hard paraphanelia.

	But, between my heavy work load and the scorching summer heat, it's
only now getting enjoyable to sit outside in the early evenings and enjoy a
cigar. My wife, the one handy with tools (give me a keyboard and her a
sledgehammer), built a wonderful pair of hammocks in our backyard. It makes an
absolutely delicious location in which to lay back and force a peaceful and
relaxing hour into my schedule.

	Up until very recently, though, the evening hours were still in the
80s, and the daytime temperatures in the (not so low) 100s. We're now enjoying
70 (and sometime 66ish) degree nights, and our little cold spell is going to be
broken with a 102 day on Thursday. As you can expect, we in Arizona *love* to
complain about the heat. It's a neverending topic of conversation. I eagerly
await the crisp mornings and chilly evenings that might, for such a brief time,
fall upon us.

	And so it has been difficult for me to find a *favorite* assortment of
cigars. I still collect wrappers and make notes, I still visit the cigar shops
each week to collect a new array of cigars, and I'm still waiting to purchase
my first full box (humidor, too).

	I've enjoyed the list very much since the beginning, more so than Cigar
Afficienado. I've found the editor's interviews with tobacco luminaries to be
quite painful (how many cigars did you make last year? how many did you ship to
America? how many do you think you'll make this year?) and not as enjoyable as
it had been in the beginning. The novelty of that period has worn off, but left
me a die-hard fan who's only dying for a little time to indulge further.

Subject:       Cuban

I simply want to know if there is anywhere where I may be able to 
purchase- more than likely order- a Cuban Cigar? I have never had one 
and at least once in my life I would like to be able to say that I 
have been able to smoke a Cuban Cigar.

                    Thanks-
                        Joshua B. Hoynes

From: ??????@??.??? (Ralph T. Webb)
Subject: A question or two, or three

Thanks for signing me up for the digest.  I'm enjoying catching up on the
back issues.  If I'm not directing my questions or comments to the
appropriate address for you, please let me know.  

A couple of questions for your readers, please.

1.  I started pipe smoking when an undergrad at Florida State back in the
60's. Tallahassee had one of the classiest shopes I've ever seen, called
Jack Kirk's Smoker's World.  Jack started me off with a BBB straight-grain,
virgin apple.  Still one of my favorite pipes.  Jack blended his own pipe
tobaccos, and I still have pipe-dreams of one called Mocca.  Jack was
something of a character, and seemed to have dropped off the face of the
earth.  I would mail-order from him into the 80's, then one of my orders
came back "addressee unknown."  Over the years, I've often wondered what
happened to him.  With your wide readership, I wonder if anyone out there
ever knew of the shop or Jack's fate or if he's still lurking around the
Tallahassee area.

2.  In doing a keyword search on back issues, I see only one reference to
Kriswell pipes.  I know they are long out of business, but would like to ask
if any readers know where I could get my hands on any used ones.  I've still
got one, had a couple stolen while I was in Viet Nam, and would like to get
my hands on another--or two.

Thanks.

Subject: Tobacco Tavern

I read the new digest and picked out the first submission about "A Little
Taste of Cuba."  I am a student at Penn State University's main campus in
State College, PA.   There is a similar place here called Tobacco Tavern.
The front of the shop has a conversation circle of 4 couches where anyone
who loves a  a peaceful smoke can sit anytime to escape the outside world.
Good coffee, good conversation, and of course, a good smoke are the norm.  A
wide selection of pipes, tobaccos,  and cigars span the rest of the shop.
Drop by and fill your pipe.  I highly recommend the Blackberry Brandy tobac.

Subject:       Re: I'm a knothead

Steve - I accidentally erased the second half of #201 from my server. 
Could I prevail upon you to ship it again? Thanks!  I really enjoyed 
my first issue (I'm a newbie).  

I'm doing a Ph.D. in Hospitality Management at Penn State.  I picked
PSU after I accidentally stumbled into the Tobacco Taverne, a State
College shop which does great, reasonably priced, unusual blends and
carries a good line of private label cigars. The owner just opened a
branch in Altoona.

I really enjoy the place; if I have to stay out here for three years, 
 this'll help.  Congrats on nups!

[ Issue sent, Jon. Sounds like a great place!  If someone could supply
me with better contact information (full address &amp; phone number), I'll
augment the Guide's sketchy entry.  And thanks! Married 7 weeks and
it's still great. -S. ]

Subject: My 1st Pipes Digest Reading

Thank you for including me on your PD subscription list.  I enjoyed reading 
all of the postings and found one of special interest; that was the list of 
US pipemakers posted by ??????????@???.???.  As I purused the list, I 
noticed the name of a late friend, Charles Hollyday.
  Charles (Chuck) Hollyday, maker of CHP-X, Hollyday Pipes, Charles Hollyday 
Pipes, and probably others.. passed away on May 20, 1995, in Traverse City, 
Michigan. Chuck had spent the last years of his life operating a Graphics 
printing business here, making a very few pipes, and ably assisting me in 
hosting an annual trout camp for local fly fishermen. (the party and signage 
was great)  Chuck could be frequently found at Nolan's Cigar and Pipe Shop 
here in town. Mike Nolan still has a few CHP-X, and recent Hollyday 
creations; including a matched 7-day set with a Chuck-made display box.
  I am smoking a CHP-X which he made for me prior to his death.
  He is survived by his wife Margaret, daughter Leslie, and son Dan.
  Chuck Hollyday was a gifted pipemaker and a fine friend.  All of us in 
Traverse City, Michigan mourn his passing.

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #201 -- October 15, 1995

The fellow who wrote from Utah in the last issue will find a GREAT 
homegrown pipe/cigar store in Salt Lake City: Jeanie's Smoke Shop.  
They have lots of pipes; every brand, and recently completed a very 
large reach-in humidor for cigars.  Their prices are lower than the 
mall's Tinderbox (in the interest of full disclosure, yes, we have a 
Tinderbox, but it should be avoided at all costs in favor of Jeanie's). 
 The store is right downtown on State Street between 100 South and 200 
South.  It's been here for many years, was started by Jeanie's husband, 
and is now owned by Gary, Jeanie's son.  Jeanie still works the 
counter.

It's a great place.

[ Thanks, Mark!  From the Guide, they're at 156 South State Street,
Salt Lake City, UT 84111; phone (801)-322-2817. -S. ]

Subject: Tight fisted smoker

Dear steve, 
having read some of the entries regarding hard or nearly impossible to find
favorite tobaccos, I would like to share a tip for cutting down on the amount
of "best" tobacco used in filling your pipe.  
Like many others that I have observed in your digest, I have come up short of
my supply of favorite weed from time to time.  When this happens, I have on
hand a moderate supply of Straight White Burley.  I use the White Burley,
which has little flavor of it's own, to start filling my pipe.  Usually about
1/4 to 1/3 full, and then fill the rest of the pipe with the more expensive,
or hard to find blend.  
The White Burley will take on the flavor of the better tobacco that is packed
on top of it, and while it may not give you a full bowl of your "best", it
will let you smoke every bit of your favorite to the very end of your pouch.
 The White (unflavored) Burley will smoke fine at the bottom of the bowl, and
will actually pick-up flavor and aroma from the tobacco packed on top of it.
 When you are down to your last ounce of your "best" this will extend it to 2
ounces.
I hope this helps some of my fellow smokers.  It comes from a pipe smoker of
35 years experience smoking pipes and cigars.  Randolph Ruwe

[ Good idea, Randolph! -S. ]

Subject: Cigar Parlour

Hello:

&gt; [CIGAR] While in Princeton, look up "A Little Taste of Cuba" (70
&gt; Witherspoon St, Princeton NJ 08542; phone (609) 683-8988.)  Jorge
&gt; Armenteros, the proprietor, has hit upon a retailing idea which could
&gt; spark a revolution: a "cigar parlor."

And in Toronto, visit Thomas Hinds on Cumberland near Yonge and Bloor. A fine 
parlour, tremendous selection of Cubans, and their own excellent Dominican 
private label line.

I like to cure my cigars in my own humidor, so I typically take my own
into the shop, buy a couple, and smoke the one I brought. They never
object if you bring your own, but I want to support the establishment.

Friday afternoon is an excellent time to drop in--the couches and chairs are 
overflowing with fellow smokers.

I think I'll head over right now...

[ I would too, but it's a twelve-hour drive... -S. ]

Subject: First Post - Cigar Smoker Looking for a Lost One

Hello Steve,

I have a request of anyone on the list.  I used to smoke a
little Honduran (I think) called a Florentine.  Every pay
day I'd go to the shop and pick one or two up.  They were
small ones and very mild.  Maybe four inch long and, oh, 5/8
inch diameter (I never can remember that ring size).

Well, one day, the shop stopped carrying them and I was out.  
Can't find them anywhere.  If anyone on the list might have 
heard of, or have any info on such a smoke, I'd really like 
to hear from them.  { ?????@??.????.??????.??? }
 
Got to go.  Have a Romeo and Julieta No. 2 which needs my
attn.
 
Thanks for adding me to the list.  

Good smoking.

RR

Subject:       El Credito /Dunhill

I should take a moment to introduce myself.  My name is Doug Connolly 
and I've recently moved back to Madison, WI and once again have 
access to the digest.  My brother-in-law lives in Miami and is 
usually good enough to stop in at El Credito and pick me up a box 
when he visits.  I've enjoyed these cigars for a couple of years 
but have had trouble getting a hold of some of the larger sizes.  
I've also been told that they've raised the prices something like 40-
50%.  Can't blame for that though with the demand they must be 
experiencing.  Secondly, has anyone had the problem of entering a 
Dunhill, not dressed in a suit and being followed through the store 
and into the humidor? The clerk had never left until I made my 
choice.  Guess they think I'll be walking off with one of those 
$900 belts. Just kidding.

Subject: Pipe Digest

Steve, I'm writing to you because you seem to be the repository for
all pipe information!  I am 28 and have been smoking a pipe for a
whole 4 months now.  I got started mostly because I like the smell of
tobacco, hate cigarettes, and a pipe seemed to go well with my newly
grown beard!  I got started by checking out a number of tobacco shops
in the Hartford (CT) area.  I chose the smallest shop I found, where I
thought I could get some individual attention.  I walked in one sunny
afternoon and asked the owner if he could get me started pipe smoking.
He had me pick out a pipe first.  I chose a bent stem, mahogany
stained wood pipe for about $30.  He explained the benefits of a good
pipe, and commended my choice.  (I can't recall who made the pipe!)
He then got me the required accessories, and picked out a mellow blend
called "Nick's blend".  It smelled great.  He gave me a pamphlet on
how to light up, and I drove straight home to try it out.  I had some
trouble keeping it lit, but finally managed to puff steadily.  It
tasted great!  I had tried a few cigarettes before, and they were blah
compared to this!  My roommate said she didn't like the smell, but she
smoked up a storm from cigarettes, and those really don't smell right!
(She did admit later that she soon liked the smell of the tobacco.)
Anyway, I like to smoke a pipe every few nights or so.  I'm not
fanatic about it yet, but I do find it soothing and tasty.  I think
I'm ready to try a bolder blend.  Do you have any suggestions for a
popular blend?  I'm in Alabama now, so don't pick anything too exotic!
Thanks for your ear.

Sincerely,(smoke in peace!)

Steve Jones

[ A lot of mail-order dealers will be glad to send you a sampler pack
for a nominal price, Steve.  And, BTW, the repository for all pipe
information is not moi. Most likely it's Ben Rapaport. -S. ]

Subject: Strong words

What do scientists say when they get *seriously* angry?  In the
case of

	Abelson, Philip H.
	1995	"Flaws in Risk Assessments", Science,
		volume 270, page 215 (13 October 1995)

he chooses this closing:

	When scientists plan experiments, they seek
	to control the important variables and to
	achieve time-invariant reproducible results.
	Those at EPA [the Environmental Protection
	Agency of the USA] with the responsibility
	for establishing protocols for risk assess-
	ment experiments have acted as if they did
	not share these goals.

Ouch!

Here's a bit of the background:  Abelson is a Deputy Editor,
and former Editor-in-Chief (or whatever the title was at that
time) of *Science*.  He still returns from time to time to
write guest editorials, like the one cited here.  His writing
is, for my money, consistently strides ahead of that of any
other editorialist for the journal:  he is precise, he writes
about subjects that are important and interesting, he is hu-
mane, and he makes it clear when there's a bad smell in the
air.  In this case, his topic is "[c]hemical risk assessment
studies conducted with rodents", the words he chose to begin
his article.  The USA has spent "more than a trillion dollars
over the past 20 years" on such research, "although it has not
been shown that such studies have substantially benefited human
health."  There are a number of reasons efficacy deserves
scrutiny.  In this week's editorial, his concern is with "gen-
etic drift in the test animals and ... a failure to control
their consumption of food."
My point:  I recommend the editorial not only for its content,
but also as a demonstration that civilized speech makes an
even better weapon than the vulgar language and undisciplined
thoughts that so pervade NetNews.

Subject: Pipe Digest and Europe

Steve

First, please apologize my poor english. My name is Claude 
Fuhrer and I live in Switzerland. I receive your digest since 
number 146, and I find it very interesting. Unfortunately, 
there not many informations about pipe smoking here in 
Switzerland and more generally in Europe. Therefore, I propose 
to start a little discussion about pipe smoking ressource in 
Europe. 

I don't know if it is the right place for such a annoncement, 
but if someone want to see my WWW page about pipe smoking, the 
URL address is :
<a href="http://www-iiia.unine.ch/CG.GRP/azubi.distrib/pipes-books.html">http://www-iiia.unine.ch/CG.GRP/azubi.distrib/pipes-books.html</a>

If you have some questions or suggestion about this page, 
please feel free to send your comment to my email 
(??????@????.?????.??).

Thank you for your help.

Claude

P.S. If your mailing list is not the right place for such 
announcement, could please suggest where I should post it ?

[ The Digest is fine for your announcement, Claude! -S. ]

Subject: Cigars in the Outer Banks

	I just returned from a weekend trip to the Outer Banks.  I
realized after I got there that I had forgotten to brink cigars, so 
I checked the yellow pages (James Earl Jones would have been proud).
There's a place in Nags Head called Island Tobacco on Mile Post 14 in
The Outer Banks Mall that fit the bill.
	It's a small place, about as big as the kitchen in my first
apartment.  Despite the size, it had a pretty decent selection of cigar
and pipe stuff.  I bought a Don Tomas Special #100 for four bucks and 
L O V E D it.  My father got a Macanudo Prince Phillip, and my buddy 
Jason got a box of Baccarat Churchills.  I understand that Island 
Tobacco also has a shop in Corolla, for anyone who stays in Duck or 
further up.  I believe they mail order, too.
	Take care...

Subject: OPC Show Dates

Steve, I'd like to get a correction on the 1996 swap/sell pipe show out
to you and all your readers.  In my report on the 1995 show, I gave a date
that later had to be changed due to events beyond our control.  But we now
have a firm date of Sept. 14, 1996.  In addition, Sept. 27, 1997, is the
scheduled date for the 1997 show.  1995 was a grand success, but we
promise that 1996 will be bigger (room for 65 tables) and better.  Details
will follow over the coming months.
 
We invite everyone to be there for a great time.  And anyone interested in
the Ohio Pipe Collectors, from anywhere in the country, should drop me a
line.

If you've got one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you've got more than
one, you're a pipe collector.
Bill Unger
Secretary, Ohio Pipe Collectors

Subject: PD chats

Hi Steve and friends !
It is been a pleasure to receive the PD . I am calmly waiting for the next ,
and enjoying the idea of an electronic sitting- room for pipe smokers'
chit-chats .
I spent week 41 and 42 in Danmark , together with my beloved . I don't think
there is another place in the world with so many and so visible pipe smokers
! Although I do not like the danish pipe blends ( too sweet and wet ) , I
enormously enjoy just the vision of so many people walking , working ,
sitting and drinking with a pipe as companion . It is curious and lovely
that lot's of shops in Danmark have combined sale licence to sell tobacco
and wine . Can you imagine  the  paradise those shops are  for me.......an
italian pipe smoker ?

I would like to say a couple of words on the prohibition debate .  I will
probably be provocative but I do not feel comfortable in joining cigarette
smokers in the counter campaign against smoking . I don't have anything
against cigarette smokers,  but   their addiction makes them fundamentalists
as fundamentalist is the nature of their smoking and as fundamentalist are
the campaigner against smoking in public places . Finally : fundamentalism
is the wrongest answer to itself !
I might be too confident ( or just living in Europe ),  but I believe that a
reasonable solution will be found to the problem respectful of everybodies'
phisical and psicological health . I shall add that I can still feel a big
simpathy and curiosity around  pipe smokers ( and keep in mind that my
Balkan is not exactly the sweetest blend one can smell !) .
No hard feelings just a provocation for some more chit-chat !

Claudio

[ Claudio, I'm not sure what you mean by "fundamentalism" here;
perhaps you could explain? -S. ]

Subject: Pipes Digest Article

[PIPES]
I'm finally getting around to posting a vacation trip report.  I picked up
some nice estate pipes and found a new pipe shop for the resource guide.

I went back to Arkansas and Oklahoma (visiting relatives).  While holed up
in Little Rock, watching the wife doing some Olympic class jewelry shopping,
I figured I might as well get into the act.  Hauled out the Yellow Pages;
let's see... pipes, no... try tobacco... aha, here we are.  Off I go to a
place called, oddly enough, The Pipe and Tobacco Shop.

Walked in and was promptly amazed by the selection.  The first shop I've
seen clay churchwardens out on display.  They also had a nice Caminetto
with gold windcap and chain (looks like the one pictured on page 262 of the
second edition of Hacker's book) for a mere US$ 6500 (yes, that's four
digits before you get to the change).  Nice pipe, but just a tad out of my
budget.  Let's look at some estate pipes.

There were a dozen or so estate pipes displayed, and at very reasonable
prices, at least compared to Atlanta.  As it turns out, the shop refurbs the
pipes on site and perform repairs.  After prowling through the pipes, I
purchased three of them:  1) A small, smooth GBD bent bulldog.  Grain not
outstanding, but a nice patina and nary a flaw anywhere.  Age unknown.  2) A
smooth Comoy Dublin.  Again, no flaws; age unknown, but the lettering is a
different style than the newer ones.  3)  A small (4.75 inches overall
length), smooth, silver banded Barling straight bulldog.  Bowl rim is some-
what rounded from wear, but otherwise in outstanding condition.  Age
unknown; no shape number, the silver band has two sets of initials and
some other stampings on it.  I can also recommend their tobacco blend
_Sherlock's_.  Enough Latakia to bring a strong man to his knees. Sum
total for this expedition was just under $100.  I had almost that much
fun picking out the pipes.

On a local note, for those of us who live in the northwest part of the
Atlanta metro area, a new shop recently opened in Marietta.  Data follows.
I am also informed that a Tinder Box has opened in Town Center Mall, but I
haven't investigated.

The rumor I hear from Ron at the Wharf is that Escudo has been discontinued 
and all the US suppliers are out of it.  Has anyone else heard anything 
about this?

[ That's been a recurrent rumor, and as far as I know is without
substance. The 100 gram tins have been discontinued, but you can still
get 50-gram tins. -S. ]

Subject: PD tidbits

Steve --

A few tidbits for the PD........

1) McClelland does it again.  Many PDers are well-familiar with
McClelland tobaccos, either from their local tobacconist or from the
spelndid limited-production blends purveyed by Bob Hamlin and (the
late) Barry Levin.  Well, the original Ashton tobaccos are now being
produced by McClelland (and marketed by Holt's in Philadelphia).
IMHO, the McClelland versions are *much* better than the earlier
productions.  The "Celebrated Sovereign" (with Syrian latakia) is
especially good.

2) If ever there was any doubt about the value of "old" tobacco.......
While on a business trip last month in the UK, I visited a pipe/
tobacconist shop in Aberystwyth, Wales, and found a few tins of "old"
Rattray's.  I recognized it as "old" by virtue of two features: First,
the label was yellowed on one side, due to prolonged exposure to the
light -- having sat for a long time on the shelf.  Second (and more
importantly), thanks to the informative tutorial by Bob Hamlin, I
noted from the nomenclature on the label that it was at least 10 years
old. -- I just finished a tin of "Jocks Mixture" from the batch, and
it was a uniquely pleasing experience; such a nice Oriental taste,
nestled in a softly-rounded Virginia base.  Granted, "old" tobacco
is too expensive (when one can find it) for everyday smoking; but one
should treat one's self on occasion!

3) On that same trip to the UK (yes, I *did* get some business done
along the way!), I was in Liverpool for several days.  From a tip in
THE PIPE SMOKERS EPHEMERIS, I arranged a peronal tour of Ogden's/
Imperial Tobacco Co. -- What a fantastic experience!  BTW:  In 1996,
"St. Bruno Flake" turns 100 years old. (Look for something "special"
from Liverpool early in the year!)

(The trip to the UK ended in London -- with a pipe purchase from
Astley's [IMHO, the best pipe shop in London] and a slowly-embered
Cuban Hoyo de Monterrey Epicure #1 from James Fox/Robert Lewis.)

Puff, Puff,
Rick Welch

Subject: FDA regulations

Yo, Steve!

Just finished writing up the latest Southwest Pipe &amp; Cigar League
newsletter.  In it I included a reminder about the deadline for
submitting comments to the FDA re. their proposed tobacco regs.  I'm
passing that part of our newsletter along to you and all of our other
PD subscribers.  The below excerpt contains important info, so PLEASE
USE IT, EVERYONE!

BTW - just wanted to put in my vote of approval for the way the PDs are now
being distributed.  As an America OnHold user I find downloading the PD as a
file much easier (and faster) than the old e-mail method!

Later!

Steve J. (Briar Man)

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

In the last newsletter I told you about the public comment period for the
FDA's proposed tobacco regulations.  This is a reminder that this public
comment period ends on NOVEMBER 9TH.  I also want to once again give you the
address where you can send your letters.  That address is:

Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305)
Food &amp; Drug Administration, Room 1-23
12420 Parklawn Drive
Rockville, MD  20857

Last time, I mentioned a docket number that you need to reference at the top
of your letter.  There are actually two docket numbers, so please note the
following:  Docket #95N-0253-J refers to the proposal to regulate nicotine as
a drug and classify cigarettes as nicotine delivery devices for the purpose
of regulation.  Docket #95N-0253 refers to the FDA's proposed restrictions on
the sales, marketing and distribution of cigarettes.  I won't go into any
detail on what those proposed restrictions are, but if you've been following
this story in the news then you'll know that they're quite extreme.

There's something here that bears repeating.  Some of you may feel that the
FDA's actions are justified, and after all pipe tobacco and cigars are being
specifically exempted from the proposals - FOR NOW!  Regardless of whatever
feelings you may have about cigarettes, it would be naive to think that the
FDA will stop there.  David Kessler is a megalomaniac, and under his
leadership the FDA has expanded its power enormously.  Do they need any more?
 I don't think so, and when they level their sights on tobacco we had better
get very concerned regardless of whatever they happen to be going after
today.  To those of you who have not already written to the FDA I urge you to
do so RIGHT NOW!  Remember, the deadline is NOVEMBER 9TH!!  And don't forget
that you MUST reference the appropriate docket numbers at the top of your
letters.

Also - there's a congressman who wants to know what we have to say about the
FDA proposals.  His name is Bart Gordon (R - Tenn.), and through the American
Smokers' Alliance he has requested copies of public comment letters opposing
the FDA's proposals.  Congressman Gordon is vigorously opposed to what the
FDA wants to do, and we need to help him in his efforts.  If you have already
written to the FDA and you've kept a copy of your letter (or letters), or if
you haven't written yet, but are going to please be sure to send a photocopy
of your correspondence to :

the Hon. Bart Gordon
U.S. House of Representatives
2201 Rayburn HOB
Washington, D.C.  20515

While you're at it you should send a copy of your letters to our other friend
in congress, Tom Bliley.  His address is:

the Hon. Thomas J. Bliley, Jr.
U.S. House of Representatives
2125 Rayburn HOB
Washington, D.C.  20515

It is becoming apparent that should the proposals go through, the FDA will
face serious opposition from congress.  It is therefore VITAL for us to do
everything we can to stop the regulatory monster that threatens all of us, so
once again - WRITE TO THE FDA AND TELL THEM YOU OPPOSE THEIR REGULATION OF
TOBACCO, SEND COPIES OF YOUR LETTERS TO CONGRESSSMEN GORDON AND BLILEY, AND
DO IT NOW!!! 

[ Thanks for the reminder, Steve!  I have written the FDA, and will
mail copies to Gordon and Bliley, as well as to the one local
congressbeing who will likely listen. -S. ]

Subject: Cigar Dinner

Steve, etc.:

Here are belated congratulations and a belated report on the first ever
Cigar Dinner at the Peabody Hotel in Memphis. The dinner was held in the
posh Chez Phillipe Restaurant and featured a six course dinner, cigars by
PGC Hajenius and wines by Clos du Val.

The food was exceptional and ranged from Roquefort Laced with Potato to
Blackened Escolar on Carmelized Vidalia Onion Sandwich with a Melange of
Southern Peas and Ginger Beurre blanc to Smoked Baby Beef Tenderloin Breaded
with Grilled Vegetables on Smoked Arkansas Risotto. Each course was
accompanied by two wines--an 80's vintage and a 90's vintage--and the
dessert (Carmelized Pear under Kirsch Marinated Plum Salad and Grapefruit
Sauce) featured a remarkable California Brandy.

The cigars were delivered after each course and were a mild disappointment.
I mean this literally. They were machine made, short filler panatellas of
various sizes. The were mildly flavored and mildly spiced with faint
undertones of mildness. Still, they weren't nasty, just bland. So bland, in
fact, that a first-timer was on his sixth before someone told him he wasn't
supposed to inhale the smoke. He claimed to be woozy, but never got sick.
The best cigar was the last: the Hajenius Grande Finale #1. Medium flavored,
medium spiced, a pleasant after-dinner smoke. As we left we were given a
three pack of these to take home.

All in all it was a great night, although the Peabody has a few
organizational quirks to work out--for example, not having the first cigar
ready when we  entered, and not stopping us from therefore pilfering cigars
from the large humidors they had apparently intended to give away in a
drawing. Still, I'm looking forward to the next dinner, which will hopefully
take place in December.

The Peabody, by the way, is cigar friendly all the time. I recommend
plopping down on one of the sofas in their lounge, ordering a
single-malt--or the aforementioned brandy--and lighting up a Churchill. No
one will even look at you funny.

Give 'em hell.

DL

***Wonderful coffee. Meal in itself.***

[ Too bad about the cigars, but the meal sounds like it was not to be
missed!  Does Congressman Gordon ever drop by? :-) -S. ]

Subject: C&amp;D News

Steve:

Will you please run this in PD if it's not too commercial. Tnx. Will
understand if you don't.

The following blends are now offered in one pound pressed blocks (the way
tobacco was sold 100 years ago) at a $2 per pound premium: #414P, #531P,
#965P and #967P. Putting tobacco under high pressure mingles the oils and
flavors, making the smoke smoother and removing the sharp distinctions
between tobaccos.

In addition, we have a new blend in pressed form only, #967PV, Bromley's
Best. This is a combination of #967 with a small amount of #414 added to cut
the heavy Perique in #967. The blend was named in honor of Dr. Ray Bromley
who suggested it and who contributes so much to our discussions.

Cornell &amp; Diehl has been building a new "tobaccery" (and home) and we will
be moving in the middle of December. Therefore, we will be closed from
December 12 to December 26 inclusive. We will accept orders during this time
for shipment December 27 and later. Orders received before January 1 will be
honored at the current prices.

In addition, there will be a price increase January first to $14.75 per
pound. This is the first increase in 2 years and we just can't continue to
absorb our costs. Shipping may go up, but not unless UPS makes its usual
annual increase more than last year. We'll try to hold the line on that.

Best,

Craig

Subject: Escudo 50gm

Dear Steve

	I noticed your comment in the last Pipe Digest which avers that 
Escudo is only unavailable in 100g tins, but is available in 50's.  I am 
unsure what to make of this.  I have it on excellent authority that 
Escudo is out of production, and unavailable from major suppliers who may 
still list it in their catalogs, but can no longer deliver.  Further, my 
original understanding was that the 50g tins were the first to be gone, 
and the 100's were the last.  If you have any knowledge of suppliers who 
have current stock of Escudo in any size, other than Bob Hamlin (who has 
10 year old 100g tins for $50), I would like to know about it.  I would 
not like to know about suppliers who still catalog Escudo, but have no 
stock; they are embarassing to contact.  Frankly, you need not even 
contact me personally about this matter, although I would be delighted to 
be first to know about any suppliers who haven't sold out weeks or months 
ago.  Rather, a clarification in the newsgroup or next P.D. would be 
excellent.  Thanks for reading this.

Subject: Logically Absurd Conclusions (again)

Steve,
        (Apologies to all.  I don't know why my message didn't appear after
my heading in Digest 202.  I was trying to cut and paste and apparently
didn't do it correctly.  Anyway, I'll type it out this time...)
        I read the following on NandoNet News on 10/26/95: (I hope the "free
market think tank" is pursuing this with tongue in cheek) -

Group to FDA: if tobacco is a drug, so is coffee

WASHINGTON - A free market think tank said Wednesday if the Food and
Drug Administration goes ahead with its drive to regulate tobacco as a
drug it should do the same for coffee and cola.  "FDA's tobacco
proposal sets out new criteria for classifying substances as drugs and
devices, and these criteria are as applicable to caffeine as they are
to nicotine," Competitive Enterprise Institute general counsel Sam
Kasman said in a news release.  "FDA has an obligation to apply these
criteria evenhandedly."  Hoping to "wake up" the FDA as it formulates
its policy on nicotine, the institute filed a petition saying
regulation of caffeine beverages would be the logical next step.  The
petition noted that the drive to treat nicotine as a drug was based on
arguments that it is addictive and affects the central nervous system,
that cigarette makers manipulate the level of nicotine to obtain these
effects, and that most regular smokers begin as minors.  "All the
arguments FDA uses against tobacco can also be used against caffeine,"
the news release said, adding that a wide range of soft drink
advertising campaigns show the industry deliberately markets these
products to young people.

        I guess there are those who won't be happy until we're all
existing (??) solely on bottled water and organically grown celery!
But as absurd as this story may sound (to me, anyway) I think it does
illustrate very well what could happen if we are not vigilant in
protecting our rights to choose to smoke (and drink caffeinated
beverages!!).

[ I also heard that there's another group that wants to ban
wood-burning fireplaces, on the grounds that wood smoke is "16 times
as bad as tobacco smoke."  Maybe the FDA will classify fireplaces as
drug delivery devices next... -S. ]

Subject:      partner question

I have an interesting situation. I have been interested in pipe smoking for a
couple of years but had never done anything about it until recently. I decided
to go to a local shop, inquire about the hobby and the merchandise, and the
nice lady there sold me a good pipe and some mild tobacco. I went home, lit up
for the first time, and after figuring out how to keep it lit, proceeded to
actually enjoy the experience quite a bit. So whats the point of the story you
say? Well, I've always been an anti-smoking sort of person - to cigarettes that
is, I really have no use for them at all. My long term girlfriend knows this
and shares my view, disliking smoking herself and not going to places where it
would be prevalent. My problem is this, I've discovered I like pipe smoking
and wish to contuine but how do I broach this subject to my girlfriend, who
apparently hates all forms of smoking and thinks I do too.(because I actually
did until I tried it!) If I just pull out my pipe next time were together and
light up, she'll think I've gone insane! So, what's a newly "converted" pipe
puffer to do? Before you even start, finding a new girlfriend is NOT an option
under consideration!! ;)  Thanks for your help! ---- P.S. this same situation
applies to friends and associates, none of which have seen me smoke. -DDS

[ I guess a lot of new cigar smokers have had the same predicament.
I'd just tell her about your new-found pleasure, in a non-threatening
way, and ask her to be tolerant.  Maybe it'd be a good idea to offer
to switch to any kind of pipe tobacco whose aroma she particularly
enjoys.  A nice vanilla Cavendish works wonders.

Have other members dealt successfully with this problem? Best of luck! -S. ]

Hi.  I'm a very young pipe smoker and justed started about, oh I don't
know, about 6 months ago.  Anyhow,  my friends and I really love a 
great pipe.  In fact,  I have even converted my friends to a pipe from
pot.  The only problem is we can't really get it and I almost done with 
my pouch.  I also wanted to comment on how great it is to have so
 many subscribers.  Second of all, I wanted to know if anyone was opposed
to me smoking a pipe, and if so, why?
Thanks=-)

Matt here at State College,

        In response to the strange looks that Jason Vagner gets in the smoke
shops as a 24 year old cigar smokers, I can definitely relate, I'm an 18
year old pipe smoker.
        Also, another plug for that Tobacco Tavern in State College (I'm not
working for them, I promise).  Bill Pickering saw some clay churchwardens in
Arkansas, the Tavern's got them.  $12.95 each, and if you buy two, you get a
nice wooden stand with them.

From: Joel Bloch &lt;????@?????.??.??&gt;

Steve,

I've been receiving the PD since your return from your honeymoon, and would
like to start off by offering you and the Mrs. my heartiest congrats.

I've been smoking since I was 13 (am now 49), but, unfortunately, I started
out with cigarettes, and only discovered the pleasure of pipe smoking many
years later.

Living in Israel, as I have for the past 27 years, I find myself rather
limited in the selection of pipes available, and with a rather small pipe
smoking population (most Israelis are cigarette smokers). There also don't
seem to be many real tobacconists in business, and so I'm limited as to
what's available as far as what to put in my pipe and smoke it goes.

I have, however, been able to build up a small collection of reasonably good
pipes over the years, including some locally made Shalom pipes and some
Petersons, the pride and joy of my collection being the 3 Peterson
Meerschaums that I own.

I've gotten used to the fact that I usually have to smoke my pipe by myself,
although it's always been my feeling that a good pipe is best enjoyed in the
company of at least one other piper, as there is never a lack of a subject
for conversation. Once you've discussed the weather, the local politics,
financial and job situations, you can always go on to the important stuff,
like pipes and tobacco. (I've never heard cigarette smokers have a
discussion about various brands of cigarettes - have you?)

Anyway, those are my thoughts for the moment. I enjoy getting the PD, and

Subject: Uhle's, and moving the Smokelist...

Salve', all!

	Steve, please change my address from ??????@????.???.???.??? to
??????@??????.???.  I recently received my Bachelor's in Philospphy, so
my net access must now move from that Great Mouthful of a domain to a
pleasingly mnemonic, not to mention sarcastic, domain reminiscent of the
infamous alt.foo.bar.bar.bar newsgroup naming scheme -- a delightful
transition, methinks.  Natch, the Smokelist of ratings for imported and
luxury-brand cigarets has moved with me, tho' the "finger server" idea
seems to be a bit boondoggled here; I've got the file permissions (if
not persimmons) correct, but I've been getting reports of Osterized
results coming back when someone tries to finger my account.  I'd really
appreciate it if PD subscribers could give me some feedback on how my
account is returning "finger" inquiries.  Pals?  Some help?  (Oh, I will
suggest that piping to "more" [i.e. finger ??????@??????.??? | more] is
advisable, as the Smokelist is several screens long.)

	Now, on other matters...

[somebody, I neglected to save whom] quoth:
&gt; I know that it's listed in the Resource Guide, but my favorite pipe shop is
&gt; Uhle's in Milwaukee.  The first time I entered Uhle's, I knew that I would
&gt; love it.  There were about a dozen customers inside.  Most of them were
&gt; smoking a pipe.  As I walked in, several of them either nodded in my
&gt; direction or murmured a greeting.  Store personnel bustled about; one of them
&gt; was smoking a maduro-wrapped churchill.  (I have been in an increasing number
&gt; of smoke shops that don't permit smoking in the store, not because of local
&gt; ordinances prohibiting it, but because non-smoking coffee-customers might be
&gt; offended.  Makes sense, huh?)

	&lt;sigh.&gt; Uhle's is yet another of the reasons I regret ever having
left Milwaukee.  A swell lot, the whole crew of 'em.  I'd highly recommend
a trip to Uhle's (BTW, it's pronounced "YOU-lees") for anyone breezing
through Brewtown, especially if you can make it on a Thursday evening when
the shop stays open 'til 8pm for the clientele's weekly rite of tobacco-
stoked, after-work fraternization.  The place is downtown on the main
drag, Wisconsin Avenue, next to the Riverside Theatre and across from
Marshall Field's.  My favourite guys there are Jeff, who makes me think of
a former nine-to-fiver who made a wish for his dream-job and *got* it, and
Stan, the young, somewhat-anachronistic, jovial eccentric.  Tell 'em Tyson
(the guy with the cigaret list) sent ya.

	Check out the pipes in the display cases, especially the little
case in the middle of the floor -- bulldogs the size of a *billiard ball*;
an Ueliphant (sp?) pipe which has *no bend* from stem to bowl (!), just a
sweeping flare from bit to mouth, with a slight curve upward; an ancient
Dunhill trench lighter of ingeniously simple design; and then there's the
little silver box apparatus of indeterminate purpose (it has a trough-
shaped well under the top lid, and the side lid reveals a metal bottle
under the well with a wick kept under a tethered screw-top), which they
got as a freebie in a shipment, and which they've promised to give away to
anyone who can identify it authoritatively (no speculation; you've got to
*recognize* the blasted thing).  

&gt; Uhle's has a plentiful supply of pipes and accessories.  They operate a small
&gt; tobacco factory, where they hand-blend their pipe tobaccos.  I have purchased
&gt; at least eight of their blends, aromatic and non-aromatic, and there wasn't a
&gt; beast in the bunch!  They offer over two dozen of their own blends.

	Drop in anytime from about Thanksgiving to X-mas, when Uhle's has
their annual "Christmas Blend" available -- a "festively aromatic" blend,
different every year, sold only during that month-and-a-half or so (altho'
one of these proved so popular that it made it onto the regular menu; it
became their new "Brand X (Trapper's Treat)" after the old Brand X had to
be retired owing to the unavailability of a crucial ingredient).  Those of
us on Uhle's mailing list get a holiday postcard redeemable for a 1.5-oz.
pouch of the blend, gratis.  True, it may be mere test-marketing, but they
sure do it with class, no?

Subject: Visit to Puerto Rico

Dear Steve,

I have been enjoying the digest very much.  Thanks for your hard work.

I am going to Puerto Rico in January.  And, I have a few questions.  1.
 Where can I find a good cigar shop?  2.  I know of at least one cigar
manufacturer on the island (Consolidated).  Are there any others and do they
offer tours?  3.  Does anyone hand roll cigars in PR?

Thanks for the help.

Rod

Subject: #200

I found the archive on Steve B page Thanxs . One day I d like to write some
sort of history on Am pipemakers before their stories are lost. Here s an
inquiry I wrote to Rex which I doubt  he ll be able to answer would you be
able to include this in some form for PD feel free to edit MT

Dear Rex
Just read thru the list . I didn t realize there were so many and I  didn t
realize there were so many I knew. But I  am saddened to read of the death
of Frank Augsbergerer of Champaign, IILL. Frank moved to West Caldwell NJ
at the tender age of 17 to learn how  to be a pipemaker under Jack
Weinberger, JHW pipe,who Curt and I had  were working for. Talk about wet
behind the ears. Frank was so funny it was unbelievable. But he sincerly
wanted to be a pipe maker in the worst way. I forget everything that
happened but he eventually moved back home as Jack broke him in slower than
he thought his potential deserved. But he did start making pipes on his
own. I m sorry to say over the years I lost track of him and  I would like
to hear some sort of epilouge. If anyone has any knowledger of  what
happenned to Frank , I d like to know. Mark Tinsky

I m going to send  a copy to Steve M  maybe he ll print it. Also I heard
George Allen of E. Stroudsburg died. I was friendly with him and then one
day I stopped in at his shop to see him and it was no more. Just recently I
heard he had  died.

Subject: The OLDIES

Steve --

As you may recall, I recently e-mailed a contribution to PD #202
concerning "old" tobaccos.  I would be *very* interested in hearing
from pipesmokers who have tried various oldies.  I am "aging" a
growing cache of tobacco myself (ca. 75 tins -- and growing!).  As
you may know, Bob Hamlin (PCCA) sometimes obtains limited supplies
of oldies and makes them available to the membership.  Bob is a
repository of information on these tobaccos. -- Are there PDers out
there who have smoked oldies (&gt;10 years old)?  What was your reaction
to them?

Puff, Puff,
Rick Welch

Subject: St. Paul Minnesota

Recently one of your readers asked, "Are there pipe clubs in Minnesota?"
 As all subscribers to the Agricultural &amp; Mechanical Gazette know ( this
is a shameless plug for my publication) The Grumblers Club meets each
saturday morning at the J.R. Fielding Tobacconist -- located on
Lexington Ave in St. Paul.  This is one of the better pipe shops -- they
do have cigars too, but who cares -- in Minnesota.  The Grumblers Club
is a pipe smoking club, of very irregular fellows, who sit around the
round table at the front of the shop and review Minnesota and national
problems.  As you may recognize, actually solving all or even some of
Minnesota's problems is probably beyond the capability of any group of
humans.
    Anyway, lot of interesting folks there including politicians,
airline pilots, 3M employees, university folks, police, retired guys,
and just about any other career field you might want to find.  And the
only requirement is that you have a pipe, cigar and an opinion.
    See what people miss by not subscribing to the most entertaining
literary publication in the Great North Woods?  Not to mention our Pipe
Fiction -- not to be confused with Pulp Fiction -- or Science Fiction
Thanks.
         Neil Murray


[ Sounds like a neat club, Neil!  Kind of an in-person alt.peeves,
with antis not allowed. -S. ]

Subject: Great Digest

Steve - my congrats on a great digest.  I'm in awe every time a get a new
digest and I see the number of new people who have become members. GREAT JOB!
I have to also pass along a pleasant surprise thanks to Bill Fink Jr.'s
generous offer to provide a free sample of tobacco (Pipe Digest #200) from
his company - Finck Cigar Company.  I received my sample yesterday and truly
enjoyed a pipeful of "Royal Achievment".  So much so that I took advantage of
a sampler offer and mail ordered several sample packs (1.5 oz)  from his
catalog.  Thanks to your digest for providing the source.

Lester Aradi

[ Yes, we've been enjoying Bill's sampler too! -S. ]

Subject: New C&amp;D Oferings

Steve:  I tried some new blends (pressed) that Craig had at the CORPS show and
I thought your readers might be interested in my impressions.

Craig Tarler of Cornell and Diehl Tobacco has a new style of pipe tobacco: 
blends pressed under hydraulic pressure.  The result is a one pound brick. 
Just cut or break off a small amount, crumble to the desired texture and fill
your pipe.  This is not like a flake or disk such as Erinmore Flake or
Macbarren's Twist.  The blends Craig offered at the Richmond CORPS show (he
brought several for people to sample) were natural blends lacking the
additives or stickiness needed to form a hard mass.  Instead his brick
crumbles cleanly and easily.

The samples Craig brought were his Oriental Silk, Yale Mixture, and Exclusive
(the Escudo match) blends, all of which I have smoked before and enjoyed. 
The pressing process doesn't change the final texture or taste but it makes a
significant difference in the overall effect.  The flavors of the individual
tobaccos blend and marry to each other in the pressing process.  I found the
result in all of the offerings to be a smoother, more mellow smoke that did
not sacrifice the blend's unique character.  And that mellow effect actually
became more pronounced as I continued to smoke the bowl.  It was improvement
without change.  These are my impressions but several veteran smokers,
familiar with these blends, agreed with me.

Craig will not be offering all of his blends in this manner, but there will
be several.  Ask him about it when you place your next order.

On another matter, I tried a couple of C&amp;D blends which were new to me. 
(Yes, there are a few I haven't tried yet.)  I like the challenge of
describing a purely subjective impression (taste) in a way that others can
understand.  So here goes.

Trade Winds:  This is a blend of burley, Virginia and sweetened latakia.  It
is flavorful but not harsh or overpowering.  One of the appeals of this blend
for me is that it goes very well with sweet black tea, especially, for me,
Earl Gray.  I'll be enjoying this combination on cold winter evenings.

Scot's Pub:  This is a blend of Scandanavian style cavendish tobaccos, medium
cut, and lightly flavored with scotch whiskey.  This blend has plenty of
flavor but provided a mild smoke without a heavy aroma for those around me. 
(Scot's Pub would be a good "morning pipe" for those of us who indulge in a
bowl of tobacco before lunch.)  For fun of an evening, I tried it with
different scotches.  My preferred brand is Lagavulin (when I can afford it). 
It completely overwhelmed the taste of the tobacco but Lagavulin is one of
the most pungent of the single malts.  On the other hand, it complemented the
taste of lighter, blended scotches such as J&amp;B and Scoresby.  Scot's Pub also
went well with medium strength coffee and tea.  I'm not much for aromatics,
especially the heavy, sticky kind, but this blend is flavored lightly enough
to let the tobacco taste come though.  (Craig lays on the flavor by hand
instead of steaming them in, which results in a more elegant, less sticky
blend.)  I'll be getting some with my next order.

If others have tried these blends, I would be curious to know if you agree
with my impressions.  As usual, I have no connection with C&amp;D except as a
satisfied customer.  Happy Puffing!  The Bear.

Subject: Re: Hello...

To Steve and Friends,

	 I read all your info. on the WWW and a few newsletters, and
finally decided to go out and confront the inevitable - I bought my first
pipe.  I recently turned 18, but have been enjoying the luxury of cigars
for a couple of years now.  I decided to branch off into the pipe smoking
realm, and to this point have not been disappointed.  It is rather
difficult to pinpoint the unique attraction to pipes, especially for a
young man such as myself, but I have concluded that such an inquiry is
irrelevant.  There is something about cradling a pipe in your hand on a
cold day looking outside a window at the franctic pace of others.  I
admire such simplicity.  

	I am currently enrolled in Eastern Illinois University, and 
originate from the St. Louis area.  There are app. 5 or so shops in the 
Metro area, but the vast plains of Illinois are not exactly a breeding 
ground for many tobacco shops.  The nearest location is Jon's Pipe Shop 
at the University of Illinois, which is an hour or so from here.  

	I felt confident as I strode into the establishment, armed with 
my newly acquired knowledge from your handy resources on the Internet.  
Such information was absolutely invaluable to the proper selection of a 
quality pipe.  I decided on a Canadian style GBD mainly because of the looks 
and affordable price.  It met the approval of a few connoiseurs who were 
present at the time which was an extra vote of confidence.  I don't have 
a lot of money right now, so I wanted to make sure I was getting the best 
purchase I could.  The proprietors were very friendly and threw in all 
the necessities with the original price of the pipe - which I greatly 
apprecitated.  Another gentlemen present at the time, was even kind 
enough to buy me an ounce and a half of his special blend to get me 
started.  Needless to say, with the treatment I recieved, I will 
certainly return.

	I did have some troubles keeping the pipe lit, though. I 
purchased the Canadian because I wanted to avoid the problems associated 
with moisture collecting in the bowl from my mouth.  Perhaps I will 
venture into such an investment as that in another time.  I have worked 
out some of the intial problems, and things are finally moving along.

	I am running out of time here; the lab closes in 15 min.  Just 
wanted to write and share a few details of my first experiences with the 
fine art of pipe smoking.  God bless you all.

				Sincerely,

					Paul B. Smith

Can anyone tell me how to read the code on the underside of the box on Cuban
cigars?

I believe this shows the factory or origin and date.

Thanks.

Terence.

Hello Everyone -

Just a quick not to say the Pulvers' Prior Briar Tobacco List is up for
those of you anxiously waiting (and patiently, I must add).

The address is as always <a href="http://www.netreach.com/busonweb/Sherlocks/">http://www.netreach.com/busonweb/Sherlocks/</a>

For those of you waiting for new pipes, we should have something VERY soon.
A list of 150 will be up shortly, with at least twenty-five that you will
be able to view through your WWW browser.  For those of you who aren't on
the snail-mail list, you have a very short time to get on it before we send
out the long-awaited mailer.  Please send it to ?????????@????????.???
(please, if you've sent it already chances are we have triplicates of your
address already...).

Thanks for all the interest!

Subject: pipe digest subscription

Hi Steve
Thank you for including me in your mailing list. I am already enjoying your
latest issue and I have this feeling that I am going to meet the nicest
people on earth through the digest.

I am an oppressed pipe smoker struggling to pursue what I think is a very
healthy habit in a society which is becoming increasingly intolerant and
paternalistic towards minorities. My puffing friends have all been converted
by the health freak and anti-smokers; most were just too tired to resist.
What I need is a group which can give me the moral support to go on puffing;
a group which says that "you are not alone".

Shid

Subject: That odd feeling

Hi,
   Hope that someone out there can help me.I recieved a sampler pack of
tobbacco from  Craig Tarler a few weeks ago. I love most of the samples that
I got,but I have trouble smoking them. I will get through only one third to
one half of the bowl and I start feeling queezy and light headed. I have had
this feeling before with pipe tobbaccos that were very harsh and that I never
wanted to touch again, but this is the first time with really good tasting
ones that feel really "light" on my pallet. 
   I have been smokeing pipes and cigars for almost four years and I rotate
through about ten pipes and clean each after every use.
   Thatnks for any help that you can give me.
                                                                 Karl

waaaaaay too tight!  (Sorry, couldn't resist. :-) -S. ]

Quote of the Week: 

"It is not the critic who counts, not the one who points out how the
strong man stumbled or how the doer of deeds might have done them
better.  The credit belongs to the man who in actually in the arena,
whose face is marred with sweat and dust and blood; who strives
valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the
great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy
cause; who if he wins, knows the triumphs of high achievement; and
who, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his
place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither
victory nor defeat."

[KUDOS] Yr. Moderator is normally not one to blow his own horn.
However, now that Neil Murray has let the cat out of the bag in the
A&amp;M Gazette, it can (must!) be told.  At their annual convention in
Richmond last October, the Conclave of Richmond Pipe Smokers (CORPS)
has awarded Yr. Obdt. Servant with the acclaim of "Communicator of the
Year!"  Unfortunately, owing to previous committments, I was unable to
receive the award in person.  High praise indeed, considering that
their other two awards went to Craig Tarler (Tobacconist), Jim Cooke
(Pipe Maker), and Tom Christiano (Collector)! To Linwood, Valts, and
all the other CORPS crew, many thanks! 

(BTW, Neil, may I say that the Gazette is looking better with every
issue!)

And now, as Thanksgiving Day (in the U.S.) approaches, join us as we
settle back for a few puffs of something to complement the dinner, and
give thanks for the opportunity to live well, and to commune with our
brothers and sisters of the leaf...

Subject: No Pipes in Newark

Hi Steve,

I recently flew into Newark and had a three hour layover.  I went to the
Presidents' Club, flashed my Platinum Card to the person at the desk, picked
up a newspaper and sat down.  After an hour or so, I walked over to the
smoking section to see if I could enjoy a bowlful.  (Of  the two Presidents'
Clubs at the Newark airport, I was at the larger, upstairs one that overlooks
the food court.  It can accomodate several hundred people, I would guess.)  I
was there in the late morning, on a weekday.  There were fewer than 12 people
in the entire Club.  There was no one in the smoking section, at the time.
 Under the "Smoking Section" sign was another sign: "No Pipes or Cigars
Please."  Rather than ignore the No Pipes sign, I went to the desk to request
if I may smoke in the deserted smoking section - no one would be bothered.
 Instead of a simple "yes" or "no", I received a lecture from the woman
saying that I should be grateful that smoking (of cigarettes) is allowed at
the Newark airport at all.  I told her that I have little to be grateful for,
in this instance, since I don't smoke cigarettes.  I then politely asked her
for the address of Continental Airlines' CEO.  (Continental runs the
Presidents' Clubs, along with Northwest - I believe.)  She dismissed me by
saying, "Get the address from the in-flight magazine on my next plane."

Normally I am not hesitate to write letters of complaint to companies.  I
fully intended to write Continental about their smoking policy and the curt
response from the woman.  But several days have gone by, and each time I
begin to write, I just get discouraged.  I'm resigned to the fact that since
I smoke a pipe, I'm  a second-class citizen in many eyes.  The opposition has
worn me down.

I hate feeling sorry for myself - it's like shoveling smoke.  But I do feel
that the freedom to smoke within reasonable limits was lost long ago in the
U.S.  I doubt that any of your readers will live to see the day when the
clock is turned back to more tolerant attitudes on this issue.

Subject: Japanese Pipe Maker

First, can you change my address from ????????@????.??? to ??????@???.??.???

At the last Pipe Collectors Internation meeting in St. Louis, there was a 
display of Japanes pipes.  Does someone happen to know more information 
about that pipe maker?  I am now living in Japan, and would love to visit 
his shop, and maybe pick up a new pipe.  I remember them being quite 
beautiful.

One of the regular problems I faced back in the states was finding a place 
to smoke in peace with my fellwo pipe and cigar smokers.  All that has 
changed here.  There are almost no non-smoking areas in the entire country. 
Although it is quite a shock to the locals when I pull out a cigar or pipe, 
I have always been alowed to smoke in peace.  Unfortunately, pipe and cigar 
smoking are almost unheard of in this country.  So, when I say I can smoke 
in peace, I mean just that, total peace.  One of the things I miss most 
about America is meeting with my friends and discussing all manor of things 
over a bowlfull.  To be honest, it is far better ot have smoking companions 
than a place to smoke.

as we learn of them.  I hypothesize that, if Japan ever gets as prissy
as the U.S. is now, they will share our economic decline. -S.]

Subject: On the road again

Hi friends !
I' m on my way to Africa again . I' spend ther rest of November in South
Sudan , enjoying some good puffs of cow dung ( some says that it doesn't
make a big difference with my Balkan ) under the trees in the savannah .
This time I will stop over in Rome and try to visit my favourite pipe shop .
I take the chance to tip you on it : it's called Baker &amp; Musico' and it is
placed right behind the Fontana di Trevi . It is a beautiful pipe shop whit
a very relaxing and competent atmosphere .   B&amp;M and in particular Giorgio
Musico' do their best to make each of us at home; it is a place I would
suggest to any beginner because of their capacity to direct your choice
without making one feel like a "new comer" . I have learnt a lot in that
shop and , of course , I found there some of my best pipes . An example ? A
Castello , smoked twice by a customer  and cleaned by Paolo Baker ( who is
also an excellent...and expensive  pipe maker ) sold  for as much as USD 75
!!!! If any of you is passing by Rome I could send more details also on
other pipe shops , but if any of you is going straight to visit Baker &amp;
Musico' , please give them my regards , they remember me as the guy living
in Norway and often going to Africa !

Claudio

[ BTW, Claudio, I wonder if it's possible to visit the Amorelli shop?
I've been very impressed with his work. -S. ]

Many thanks to Elliot Evans for his tip in issue 173 of using a
vacu-formed video cassette case for keeping cigars fresh while
traveling. I was recently in Texas for 1 week and it kept the cigars
beautifully. Coincidently, I also used a case from Disney's
Fantasia. Thanks again Elliot......

Subject: [PIPES]

Hello Steve,

  I just finished PD #203 and, as always, I received a degree of comfort
reading the comments of fellow smokers and knowing that none of us are
alone even though it can feel that way sometimes.

  I've had the pleasure recently of introducing some friends of mine to the
joys of the pipe and cigar.  They've seen me sitting back and enjoying
myself so often, that, one by one, they've subcumbed to to allure of fine
tobaccos, processed and aged with care.  Although none of them are
prodigious smokers yet by any means, I've been able to share from my stock
of cigars and pipe tobaccos and impart whatever wisdom and knowledge I've
managed to accumulate over the past 18 years or so.  The process has been
rewarding for me too, because now I have some friends with whom I can share
a quiet smoke whenever our path manage to cross.

  Last night I was in my den sitting in a reclining leather chair in front
of a small fire, a wee drop of good Irish whiskey close to hand, and my
pipe burning nicely, and I was thankful once again for the simple pleasures
of life; and that old saying came to mind, "Living well is the best
revenge."  And living well doesn't necessarily mean living extravagantly.
A comfortable chair, a cheerie fire, if possible, and a pipe are all that's
needed sometimes to ward off-if only for a short while-a legion of demons.

  My wife and I are great fans of the late Jeremy Brett and his
interpretation of Sherlock Holmes.  For this reason, she's been urging me
to buy a churchwarden-such as Jeremy so often smoked throughout the
series-to add to my collection.  Last week I stopped in at the Claremont
Tobacco House to pick up a couple ounces of one their house blends and
there, on a rack behind the counter, were several churchwardens with
smallish bowls and graceful curved stems.  After examining several of them
and learning that they were reasonably priced, I selected one, and so now
am the proud owner of a churchwarden.  I must admit, it seems the perfect
pipe for said leather chair in front of the aforementioned fire.  I look
forward to becoming well acquainted with it during the coming winter
months.

[ Indeed, Ed; enjoy the fire and your churchwarden. The Sherlockians
might be able to provide us with a list of all the pipes Holmes smoked
(which don't include the calabash)... -S. ]

Subject: news for pipes list

Dear Steve, your readers might like to know that Larry Weinfeld passed away
last week.  Larry was the president of Hollco-Rohr, probably the nation's
largest pipe and tobacco importer and wholesaler.   The entire industry
will miss him; not because he was one of the most important people in the
pipe business, but because he was a gentleman and, to most, a dear friend.
He is survived by his wife, Trudy Rohr Weinfield and his two sons: Brad and
Mark

Larry was originally a CPA who, in the 1960s, stepped into his
father-in-law, Max Rohr's, business to help out for "a year or two".   Max
was the US wholesaler for Savenelli pipes, some English brands, the
nostalgic old German "alter modish phifen" with staghorn bits and fancy
painted porcelain or carved wooden bowls, Decco wooden stands, humidors and
such.  It was a good solid, well respected in the industry, and Max himself
was well loved by everyone that knew him.  Larry and Trudy carried on that
tradition with the addition of their own style.  They were one of the few
businesses willing to take chances on both special people and unusual
merchandise.  They expanded the company lines and introduced new artists
such as Miccoli, whom they found carving freehands in the window of a pipe
shop in Long Beach.  They were one of the first to bring in pipes from St.
Cloud, France: first the carved heads, and then the myriad other fine pipes
to come out of that small city.   They brought in the Fantasia from
Belgium.  Its colorful exterior and meerschaum lining was an immediate hit
in the US and there were a wide variety of copies; but, it took someone,
to take the chance and try it first.

What Larry did not do was probably as important as what he did.  He was an
honest man who's ethics were beyond question and who was willing to give up
making money if he felt it was morally suspect.  For example, Max Rohr had
always carried a traditional hooka from the Middle East, but when illegal
drugs became a problem he no longer imported that item, and he no doubt
lost a great deal of money by refusing to carry any kind of dope
paraphernalia.

Unlike most business who claim to be, the Weinfeld's truly treated the
people who worked with them like family  members and unique individuals.
I have seen Larry listen to how a company car was wrecked by a UFO in the
middle of New Mexico and why someone HAD to be off work in order to watch a
bowling tournament on television.  They celebrated weddings and births,
they helped out when help was needed, and they kept in touch with the
families of those who retired or had passed away.

Larry was charming, personable,  and a great joker. Dealing with Larry, and
his wife Trudy, was always a joy.  If there was a problem, all it took was
a phone call.  No one ever worried about taking them at their word.

Larry was also extremely patient.  It took my husband, Geoffrey, three days
to place his first order when he opened his pipe shop in 1969.   Larry and
a salesman answered every question, helped start him on private label
pipes, and gave him sound, honest advice -- all for a one thousand dollar
order.   The company also became a resource we value a great deal and Larry
became a dear friend.  Our lives will be poorer for the loss of Larry
Wenfield.  And, I thought all of you should know something about a man that
has given so much to this industry and to the people in it.

[ Thanks for the news, Al, though it be sad. -S. ]

Subject: For PD: Shot Down re. Condor

Received the following answer from Gallaher International Ltd. to my inquiry
about importing Condor:

"The reason for us ceasing the supply of Condor to the USA was due to
increasing costs caused by low sales and the health warning requirements of
the U.S. Our existing distributor, J B Russell wished to continue with the
product.

"I would  like to thank you for your interest and am sory that we are not
able to be of assistance to you."

Anyone who wishes to protest may FAX Mr. A J Williams, Sales manager, at 011

the US. 

Best,

Subject:       Pipe smoking

Hi Michael and other youthful pipe smokers,

I saw your note over the Pipes Digest and have a short response to 
your question about whether anyone approves or disapproves of your 
choice to smoke a pipe.

I should tell you a little about myself so that you know my 
perspective on the issue.  I am 48, will be 49 on 11 December.  Have 
been smoking a pipe very sporadically over the years since I was 
about 19.  I tend to smoke a bowlful of tobacco each day for a few 
days and then put my pipes away for months at a time.  I'm the same 
way with beer and wine.  I enjoy them as special treats for special 
occasions or feelings.  If I have one beer a week, that is a lot.  I 
definitely don't smoke or drink anything alcoholic if I am not 
feeling well and happy.  I have a moderate, nonjudgmental 
attitude about the pleasures of life.  Also, I am a performing 
and teaching musician and a teacher of yoga and meditation.

I believe that smoking pipe should be a treat, not something that 
nags at you.  It should be a relaxing activity that you can enjoy 
while you stop the world.  This is in contrast with the act of 
smoking cigarettes.  The people who make and sell cigarettes hope 
that you become addicted and that you never stop.  Pipe smoke is not 
inhaled and is meant to give a special pleasure to thinking, 
discriminating people.

If you can enjoy a pipe's taste and aroma and not become dependent 
upon it for the nicotine, then your pleasure will be much more than 
just burning vegetable matter.  You don't have to smoke a lot to 
enjoy it--maybe a bowlful every other day or so at most.  This is so 
that your taste buds will have a rest.  If you don't let your mouth 
rest it can lead to serious problems in the mouth: first 
numbness, later possibly cancer.  Also, you would not want the 
effects of the smoke to interfere with your enjoyment of food.  I 
believe that this is the way gentle people can enjoy a pipe in a 
reasonable way.

By the way, I also used to use recreational drugs, but I have stopped 
for many years.  I discovered that meditation can give me much more 
pleasure than _any_ drug ever could.

Wishing you much pleasure in all you do,
J.

Matt here at State College,

        In response to the strange looks that Jason Vagner gets in the smoke
shops as a 24 year old cigar smokers, I can definitely relate, I'm an 18
year old pipe smoker.
        Also, another plug for that Tobacco Tavern in State College (I'm not
working for them, I promise).  Bill Pickering saw some clay churchwardens in
Arkansas, the Tavern's got them.  $12.95 each, and if you buy two, you get a
nice wooden stand with them.

Subject: pipes digest

Hello everybody-
   To all the young men who have written about feeling uncomfortable smoking
a pipe in public, I hear you brothers.  What I have done is bought the
smallest pipe I could find.  A smaller pipe seems to draw less attention to
itself.
   Also, I have tried a few different types of tobacco and I have found that
I like the very sweet, aromatic blends.  I would love to hear any
recommendations from other pipe smokers with a sweet tooth like myself.

                                                                         Tony

Subject: So your girlfriend thinks smoking stinks.

Dear Steve-
In regards to Derrick Stamos' post on the last issue...  Well, this can be
a sticky situation.  My girlfriend has bean very understanding about my
smoking, but doesn't really like the smell of the blends I like (English
style), so if I'm smoking around her, I make a compromise and smoke
something a little more accessible, like a honeydew cavendish.  Still, this
leaves a problem when taking into consideration the juxtapostioning of our
orbicular facial muscles.  She thinks it's icky to kiss a pipe mouth.
Needless to say, I don't smoke a lot around her.  If all this seems a
little off subject, just keep in mind that compromise can be a beau-te-ful
thing.  And why so secretive?  I'm sure she would be more upset to find you
dressed in her clothes than to discover you sneaking a smoke. Present your
position in a reasonable manner and roll with the punches.  We're rooting
for you.

Sincerely,
Patrick "Dr. Ruth" North

[ Thanks, Patrick!  And see the next. Know what you mean about English
blends; Jean didn't like the C&amp;D Craven's analogue that I lit up when
I started editing this issue. -S. ]

  &gt;&gt;  Subject:      partner question

   Hey LT!  Have you tried smoking chiles in the pipe yet?  I've always kinda 
wondered about chile-flavored tobacco but never seriously :-)...

   Seriously on topic though:  I was in the exact same way.  My SO hates 
cigar smell but puts up with it because a&gt; I smoke outside (tough this time 
of year in MI) and b&gt; her father smokes cigars also so it's a "bonding 
thing"...  As for the pipe, she's more tolerant because I smoke aromatic 
blends in the bowl.  Cherry and vanilla tones seem to elicit the nicest 
comments.  If you do smoke inside, have some sort of smell abatement device 
for use: smoker's candle, ozium, exhaust fan, smell-be-gone, whatever...

Cheers!

[ Know what you mean about vanilla; having replaced the Craven
analogue with vanilla Cavendish (also by C&amp;D), all is well. -S. ]

Subject: Re: PD #203, 1LT D. Stamos

	First as a new subscriber, I would like to say thank you for 
presenting a source of information on pipe and cigar smoking.  As someone 
who is fairly new to cigar smoking and researching and considering pipe 
smoking, I can simpathize with what Derrick Stamos  wrote and would like 
to respond.  For all my life I have been anti-smoke, cigarette that is.  
Recently while purchasing a gift of a few cigars for a freind, I ventured 
into cigar smoking myself.  I enjoyed the experience quite a bit and my 
interest and enjoyment continues to grow.  I too was concerned with the 
reaction of my then girlfreind, now fiance, who too is anti-cigarette.  
At first, her reactions to me smoking cigars was more a reaction to bad 
breath and stale smoke smell in my car.  To my surprise, while we were 
sharing our first apartment together, Jennifer's curiosity in cigar 
smoking got the best of her.  On Super Bowl Sunday, while I was at work, 
she decided to try a cigar of her own.  She proceded to take one of my 
cigars which I had bought the day before and attempt smoking it.  
Unfortunatly she cad difficulty cutting and lighting it and her attempt 
failed.  When I got home I was both mad that she had butchered a cigar, 
but happy that she was interested in sharing one of my interests.  I 
showed her how to correctly cut the end of the cigar and light it.  We 
both enjoyed the cigar together. Since then, we have shared a few other 
cigars, and she sometimes surprises me by asking if I have any cigars 
because she wants to smoke one.  I was also concerned with the reaction 
of family and freinds.  They all have been supportive and quite 
interested in my hobby.
	I would say that you should not hide this from her, but offer to 
share it with her.  If she does not want to share this pleasure with you, 
hopefully she will not mind if you continue to smoke your pipe, even if 
you have to refrain when you are with her.  Somethimes smoking alone is 
the greatest time of relaxation and enjoyment.

Good luck on sharing your pleasures in life with someone near and dear to 
you.

The Native Americans as well as other cultures have smoked a pipe as a 
sign of peace.  Maybe we can learn from this example.

Matthew Reese

&gt;Hi, Stan,
&gt;Do I take it correctly from your username that you do aerobatics?
&gt;~\U S.

I used to do them.  Just for fun.  Spins for grins you might say.
I owned a Cessna 150 Aerobat at one time and I would go up and
wring it out from time to time.  The snaprolls were my favorite.
Now I own non-aerobatic airplanes, a '68 C-150 and a '38 Aeronca.
The Cessna won't complain if I pull it up through an occasional
loop or roll but those snaprolls are taboo.  I'd be afraid of
twisting the tail feathers off.  Oh well, I just have to be 
satisfied to contemplate the rush and swirl of a snaproll as I
draw from a mellow bowl of Rattrays 7 Reserve.  Such are the affairs
of life.

Well, thanks for signing me up.  I look forward to reading the digest.

Stan

Hi Steve, thanks for the most recent issue.  I enjoy the digest and I'll 
have to agree with a comment by a fellow member:  It's nice to know there 
are others out there who enjoy the relaxing and contemplative experience 
that pipe-smoking offers.  Just wanted to throw in my two cents worth on 
Smokin' Joes.  I recently ordered two tobaccos from them.  Their Cherry 
Cavendish is nice, and there "Double Bourbon" blend is delightful.  And 
for those pipe-smokers here in southern California, specifically Orange 
County, everyone of you should check out "The Tobacco Barn."  Take care. 
I've been smoking my pipe now for almost three years.  While maybe it's true 
what the health nuts say, and tobacco isn't the healthiest thing in the 
world, but the way I see it is that the relaxation I feel from 
pipe-smoking in this crazy world of ours is extending my life by years.  
Anyway, to all my pipe-smoking bretheren out there, smoke in peace.

Scott

Subject: Smoke Signal #19 [PIPE]

Smoke Signal #19
shead @ssd.fsi.com

In the two-hundredth issue of the Internet Pipes Digest, I noted a
comment that there had been no recent discussion of pipe cleaners. It
is odd how these things enter the collective consciousness.  Well, it
is true that not everybody is worrying about pipe cleaners, just me and
another fellow I have never met.

Pipe cleaners have been mildly bothersome to me, at least it is the
quality of cleaner that has perturbed my usual equanimity. On my
seven-day rack, I have several types of pipe: The bulldog and Marxman
Captain have short, straight stems; the remaining five have stems
quarter-bent.  That is to say: the Bjarne squat bulldog, the squat
bulldog from the own-brand of Ted's Pipe Shoppe, the Peterson Dublin,
the Savinelli Roma, and the Willmer Apple, all have stems with a slight
bend. In an effort to spare wear and tear on the mortice and tenons, I
rarely pull the pipes apart, preferring instead to run a couple of pipe
cleaners through the mouthpiece, into the bowl after each smoke.

Ted's Pipe Shoppe, my local tobacconist, sells three kinds of pipe
cleaner: ordinary, tapered, and ream &amp; clean. Bryco has these cleaners
made in China, distributed in this country by Bryn Mawr Smokers
Sundries, Inc. All work well on the straight stemmed pipes, but require
more tricky operation on the bent stems. With the bents, one needs to
know the location of the draft hole in the shank of the pipe. When
cleaning the bent stems, I have to put a slight curve in the end of the
cleaner. Run it into the shank, feeling for the draft hole by pushing
forward on the cleaner until it stops, pulling out, twisting, pushing
in, etcetera, until I get unobstructed movement into the bowl. It is an
annoying and tricky operation, made difficult by limp pipe cleaners,
cleaners made out of wire of insufficient stiffness that often buckle
in the pipe. It is my Peterson Dublin that is the real test of a pipe
cleaner, it has the typical steck bit with the small round hole through
which I can pass the 'ream &amp; clean' only, all other pipe cleaners buckle
under the pressure needed to insert them into the stem, except, that
is, the Parker conical cleaners made of better wire.

Some years ago, 1987 I think it was, I stopped in the town of Havant,
in the county of Hampshire, England, for the first time in many years.
My purpose was to visit Williams, the Pipemaster in North Street, on
the West side of the road, opposite the Electricity Board showrooms. He
was still there although getting ready to close the business, a small
tobacconist's shop. It was there that I bought one hundred of Parker's
Conical Cleaners. What a difference there is between these quality
cleaners and the poor stuff foisted on us these days. On the one hand,
the Parker's have a firm dense nap around good stiff wire. On the other
hand, Bryco cleaners are sickly, wide-awake and feverish, looking as
though they haven't had a nap in a long time, and what is there, will
moult, shedding fluff onto one's trousers and into one's pipe. They
make them with poor, tired wire that gives up at the first sign of
resistance in the pipe-stem.

I had been saving the Parker cleaners for special occasions, but now I
am down to a few remains, and writing to Parker's, in London, brought
no new supply. Lately, I wrote to my Dad in Axminster to see if he
could get me some. He sent me a half-dozen packets of "Big Ben"
"Quality Tapered Pipe Cleaners" made in England. Better than the Bryco
they are less than the Parker's. With the Big Ben came a letter:
"Unlike you, we haven't a good tobacconist in the town, although we do
have a small, old-fashioned shop which sells sweets by weight -- loose,
and tobacco loose too. She had tapered pipe cleaners which I use, but
no others. She had not heard of conical cleaners and there is no
mention of such items in her trade list. . . . Fewer and fewer people
are smoking here and there is great confict going on between those who
do and those who don't. Particularly in public places. Smoking is
banned on trains and most service vehicles. Only this morning I read of
a man [on a train] who, when asked to put out his cigarette, took out a
starting-pistol and threatened to shoot. Needless to say, he was
arrested at the next stop."

Big Ben pipe cleaners pass the Peterson steck-test, but only after a
modification to the bit enlarging the orifice slightly. Recently, the
post brought me another variety of pipe cleaner, samples from John
Turner of Quality Tobacco (UK), these are much more like the Parker
cleaners of old with a dense nap, they pass the steck-test too.

Soon we will be outlaws in a time when even a mediocre pipe cleaner
cannot be had. Slowly, the conduit of balsamic smoke will close, like
the hardening of an artery, and we will be forced to lay our favourite
pipes aside and mourn the passing of old friends.

[ Always enjoy the Smoke Signals, Andrew!  BTW, I'd add to avoid
Peterson's brand cleaners, which JR Cigar sells.  They're too bulky to
go through most stems, especially those with P (steck) bits. -S. ]

Subject: Keeping Up.

Hi fellow smokers!
Well I have finally got this e-mail thing down pat.  For a while I was unable
to figure out where my computer had put the issues of the digest it had
downloaded.  I finally found them in the download manager, coverted them to
microsoft word format resaved and printed them out.  Now how do I find the
issues I am missing?  Aren't they available on the web somewhere?  Please
tell we how to download them.  
I have had some wonderful and not so wonderful cigar smoking escapades
lately.  First the not so wonderful.  A Pleides.  YUCK!!!!  A friend gave me
a few in trade.  Now I know why he gave these overpriced Lawrence Welk (piece
of shit with a band around it) cigars to me.
Now for the better experiences.  I took a long weekend trip to visit a friend
in the Winston-Salem area of North Carolina a few weeks ago.  I had
anticipated this trip very much, knowing that the JR outlet store was close
by and ther there was a Tinderbox in the local mall.  The first day we went
to the Tinderbox and I purchased some Davidoffs which we were free to smoke
anywhere in the mall.  While shopping for a pair of shoes in the shoe
department of an anonymous department store a woman complained about the
aroma of my fine cigar (this was my first Davidoff, a Gran Cru #1), the
manager of the shoe department quickly explained to her that the neither the
store nor the mall had adopted a smoking policy.  She kindly stepped a few
feet back out of my halo of blue.  He privately explained to her that smokers
have the same rights that nonsmokers do.  I was in absolute heaven, a
combination of the flavor of my cigar and knowing that I was free to enjoy it
down to it's last centimeter.  
Now it was off to JR's wearing my new shoes.  There I smoked a few more
cigars while enjoying the coversation of the helpful and friendly staff.  I
had been there once before and was pleased to see that Brenda (I tink she is
the cigar store manager) was there that evening.  She is both friendly and
knowledgeable.  I share with her some of my stash of more prized cigars from
a recent trip to the Thomas Hinds shop in Toronto.  I was pleased to hand
over some of my hard-earned cash for a few boxes of cigars.
Back to the Tinderbox the next day.  Again more handing over.  They have a
great selection of Davidoffs, Avos, Zinos, Ashtons, La Glorias, etc...  I
boughta few more boxes.  At dinner that evening my friend and I, at the
reluctance of his new wife, lit up our                Double R's and were
asked to put them out by the restaurant manager.  After dinner at a cafe we
were allowed to indulge in our smoking pleasure.  The manager was very
friendly, allowing us to smoke.
A wonderful weekend!!

Rob.

[ Yes, Rob, there are Web and FTP sites, listed at the end of each
issue.  Thanks for the word! -S. ]

They also sell stains and waxes for refinishing pipes.

Subject: Re: McClelland's ? Reserve

Hi Steve....long time no speak....

Kathy Levin is long gone from the tobacco business, as of early last
Spring. The Personal Reserve Line is now offered by McClelland to all
retail tobacco shops across the USA (official as of RTDA in August,
actually as of the PCI Convention in late May). Keep in mind that
McClelland is selling only 50% of the original PR blends, the rest
have been discontinued.

The PCCA "Collector Reserve" tobaccos are produced by McClellend,
however they are not the same as PR blends. CR tobaccos are single
run, limited edition blends that are only produced once per blend. CR
tobacco is only available thru PCCA with various blends on hand at any
one time.

As far as PR blends, I have Dark Star in stock, but none of the others
right now. If you are unable to find these from a local shop, let me
know and I'll special order whatever you need from McClelland for
you. I do not expect to carry PR blends on a regular basis since they
are available throughout the country and I've got CR blends.

-Bob  

[ Thanks, Bob!  To other readers, this, and some later letters about
McClelland's, were responses to a search I'd done for Personal Reserve
sampler packs. Jorge in Princeton says he'll stock McClelland.  BTW,
please let us know when this year's CR issue becomes available. -S. ]

Strange coincidence.  Just this morning I was re-reading some back
issues of PD and ran across mention of the fact that Kathy offered
sampler packs.  I was considering placing a call myself.

Bob does carry *some* of the Personal Reserve series--I understand
he'll be adding more of the line next year.  (Side note:  call Bob and
order some of the Collector's Reserve Winter 95-96; mine hasn't
arrived yet, but I am sure it will be worth the wait.  It is to be a
medium-full Turkish/Virginia/latakia/perique blend.  The base has been
aged for several years, and the complete blend has been aged in the
tin for over a year.  Like others in this series, it is not to be
missed.  I presume your beloved doesn't mind the heady aroma of a good
English/Oriental blend &lt;g&gt;.)

Back on topic:  Nikos has announced that he is now carrying the
Personal Reserve series; perhaps he took over from Kathy.  If you
solve the mystery, I would like to know as well.

Steve,I was talking to Nikos and his Wife at the OPC show in Columbus in
September.He said that Kathy is out of the business and I believe he is
taking the tobacco over.I was able to obtain my all time favorite
virginia"Sophisticate"at the show(5 tins!/$4.00 ea)from another vendor at
the same show)I'm a happy man! McClelland is marketing a number of the
Personal Reserve blends themselves.I saw them at my local
tobacconist(Cousin's Cigar in Cleveland)several weeks ago.Speaking of that
show,boy did Neil Murray do a really nice write-up or what?He is really a

Synchronicity, indeed...

While continuing to peruse PD back-issues (I was off work today), I
discovered that you and I had remarkably similar early pipe-smoking
experiences.

We used "cane" (bamboo) instead of milkweed for the stems, however.  My
father buys tobacco for me now, but it doesn't smoke nearly as sweet as that
stolen "Sir Walter Raleigh" &lt;G&gt;.

Dear Steve,

Thanks a lot for my subcripction. I have been always related to
tobacco, since my family was on it.  I am dedicated to tobacco
business in Spain and I can see in your Digest that European countries
are not well present on it. I think that I should be able to submitt
you with some adresses in Spain, for Pipe Clubs, as well as excellent
tobacco shops, to improve your readers' trip to my country, whenever
it occurs.  I will be in contact with further information, Best

&gt;Seriously, I don't know.  I won the pipe as a door prize, at the last
&gt;NY Pipe Club show to be held in New York City.  (How could I tell
&gt;which it is, Barling fanz?)

Look at the nomenclature.  Older Ye Olde Woods will have the BARLING in
block letters in a semi-circle.  Pre-trans YOW's have three digit shape
numbers, while transitional pipes have 4.  Post-transition pieces have
the Barling in script letters.  There are some examples of Barlings made
in Denmark, of all things.  Guinea Grains are a bit tougher, as they
started the script lettering in the pre-trans days, but the typeface is
a bit different.  Also, GGs have 4-digit shape numbers even in the
"olden days," thought they only start with 1 or 2, while later models
seem to start with a 4.  There are *old* Barlings around which are
simply stamped "BARLING"S MAKE" in a semi-circle; no other grading is
evident.  These pipes are generally from the early part of the century,
and ar ea low grade version of the YOW.  YOW's come in different
flavours, as well; Fossil is a sandblast, Special is, well, um, special,
Straight Grain is the closest thing Barling ever got to one, and I've
even seen Birdseye stamped on a particularly nice cross-cut.  I believe
this to be quite rare.

If yo have any questions, send me the nomenclature description of this
piece, and I'll try to shed whatever light I can on it.  I have to
admit, sometimes I just have to get a feel for whether or not the pipe
is old; old wood just has a certain quality about it that new wood
doesn't.  To date, this method hasn't failed me once!

Cheers,
Gregory

Subject: Belated Introduction

Dear
Well, it seems like it must be close to two years that I've been lurking on
the digest and enjoying it very much. I'm the quiet kind but decided to
finally add my voice to the community. I am 47 years old, have been smoking a
pipe for about thirty year, sometimes more regularly than other. Over the
past ten years pretty regularly, except that in the summer, when I have more
time to sit out in my backyard, I tend to smoke more cigars. I've been part
of the ridiculous cigar-mania of the last few years. I live a few blocks from
Holt's in Philadelphia, and can enjoy a cigar after lunch with espresso, in
their smoker's lounge. I have been in Philadelphia for 7 years. I am the
Rabbi of a downtown Conservative Congregation. Before this I was in Seattle
Washington, but I grew up in New York and began my pipe hunting at places
like Wilke when the elderly Wilke women still worked there, Lane's, Wally
Frank, Dunhill, et.al. It was during that period that I became an early
subscriber to the Pipe Smoker's Ephemeris. Anyway, so much for introduction.
This summer I had the pleasure of introducing my 18 year old son to the art
of pipe smoking (at his request) and he is probably now reading this as he
too is a subscriber to Pipe Digest. Last month he and he drove to Lancaster
PA to visit Demuth's after reading about it in Cigar Afficianado. While there
I purchased a lovely little pipe that I've enjoyed ever since. It is
identified only by the letters HJR on the bottom of the shank. I am assuming
it is a local carver. Can anyone tell me whose it is? I am partial, nowadays,
to American artisans and their work. I smoke Boswells, Wileys, Wests etc.
Finally, I want to thank you not only for the Digest as a whole, but for
turning me on to Cornell &amp; Diehl. I have recently received a sample pack of
five of their blends and words can hardly do justice to my satisfaction. I
love the Exclusive, and the Crowley's Best most. Finally, congratulations,
belatedly, on your marriage, and keep up the good work.
Ira Stone

[ Shalom, Ira! -S. ]

Subject: General Stuff

Good Evening Steve and All ...
        Two items of interest for you tonite. I received a new catalogue 
from PIMO. It seems that Isidore and Maryana Alkalaj have retired and Al and 
Ginny Baier have taken over the company. I didn't check the resource guide 
but the address seems different. It's STEMCO-PIMO, Butternut Lane, 
PO Box 2043, Manchester Center, Vermont 05255-2043
        The next thing is an article that appeared in the Halifax Daily News 
on Tues Nov 14. 95  Hell.. maybe there's hope for us smokers yet. I don't 
feel quite so doomed :-)

The Doctor Game
Dr. W. Gifford-Jones

"Don't just blame tobacco"

What kills the majority of people who suffer from lung cancer?  Ask anyone 
this question and they quickly condemn the tobacco industry.  But are the 
cigarette manufacturers the only culprits responsible for the increase in 
the number of people dying from this disease?
Almost one-third of all cancer deaths in North America and other 
industrialized nations are due to lung cancer.  And for years the disease 
has been more prevalent in men.
But lung cancer deaths have dramatically increased in women during the last 
20 years.  It has overtaken cancer of the breast as the prime cancer killer. 
 It's generally believed the reason is increased smoking by women.  But 
there's been another change.  Doctors know heavy smokers often develop 
either squamous cell or small "oat" cell cancer of the lung.
In recent years adenocarcinoma, often referred to as the "non-smoker's" 
cancer, has been on the rise.  In 1965 this malignancy accounted for 12 per 
cent of lung cancers.  Today it's 40 per cent in both sexes.
Dr. Mark Green, professor of medicine at the University of California, 
claims bronchoalveolar cancer of the lung is more common.  It's also more 
likely to occur in non-smokers.
Green reports patients who develop this malignancy have lungs that have been 
scarred by recurrent bouts of pneumonia, tuberculosis and other illnesses.
Researchers at St. Louis University report another worrying finding in the 
January issue of "Cancer".  They found international studies indicate lung 
cancer in non-smokers could account for more deaths in the U.S. than any 
other cancers except cancer of the colon and breast in women and cancer of 
the colon and prostate in men.
No one wants to state the obvious too loud for fear the tobacco companies 
will say, "I told you so."  And that smokers will have less incentive to 
stop smoking.  but it appears there's more to the development of lung cancer 
than smoking.
What is responsible for the increase in non-smokers?  A Swedish study found 
an increase in lung cancer in those exposed to residential radon gas, a 
breakdown product of uranium.  However, other studies fail to show
this linkage. 
Other possible causes are genetics and environmental exposure to asbestos, 
arsenic, chromium, nickel and coke oven fumes.  recent studies also show 
smoking marijuana may increase risk.
Regrettably, the symptoms of lung cancer do not appear early.  They are most 
often discovered during an X-ray.  Or when patients spit up blood or develop 
a persistent cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain.  By this time the 
tumor has often spread.
There's still no easy way to diagnose this disease.  Doctors no longer 
consider routine chest X-rays as a useful screening tool.  Cancer normally 
shows up radiographically only at an advanced stage.
Patients who have suspicious symptoms can be examined with a bronchoscoe and 
biopsies.  Treatmentis surgical if the cancer is confined to the lung or has 
only spread to nearby lymph nodes.  For patients in whom cancer 
metastasized, radiation with or without chemotherapy may be of help.
I'm not providing support for the tobacco industry. The anti-smoking message 
is still right on. Nor do I want to give solace to smokers.  Smoking is 
still the major cause of lung cancer.
The message is still clear.  The sooner smokers toss out the habit the lower 
the chance of dying from the disease.
We also need more research on why non-smokers die of this disease.  But lung 
cancer gets less money for research than breast cancer.  One reasonis many 
people consider lung cancer a self-inflicted disease.

From: ???????@??.??????.??? (Stephen B. Wyman )
Subject: Assorted thoughts and ramblings

Dear Steve,

It has been a while since I last posted to the PD, so let me start by 
offering my congratulations on your marriage.  That explains why I did 
not see you at the show/swap in Newark in early Septemeber. A group of 
us traveled down from the Boston area, all memebers of the illustrious 
Sherlock Holmes Pipe Collectors Club, organized by the peerless Allan 
Rosenfeld, master of Petersons.  It was my first show, although I had 
gone to Nikos Levin and Bob Hamlin's swap meet in Westborough Mass in 
June 94.  All of us had a great time.  Despite being a certified "non 
serious collector" -- an appellation I earned from Jack Ehrmantrout 
based on his assessment of my collection -- I earned the title within 
our group of gaining the most net new pipes from the show.

I had a chance to meet some of the names from the PD and buy a couple 
of pipes from John Eels of Virginia (an unsmoked Cooke and a Radice) as 
well as swapping for a couple of Ferndowns, a Nachwalter and a Personal 
Reserve made for Barry Levin.  The last is a spitting image of a 
Dunhill and smokes as well as a Dunhill for a fraction of the price.

The Sherlock Holmes Pipe Coollectors Club continues to gather strength. 
All PDers in the Boston, Worcester, Providence area are welcome to join 
us.  We meet the second Wednesday of each month in Mansfield Mass, near 
Foxboro, the home of the struggling New England Patriots.  Jon Cohen, 
Ron Lau, both PDers, have joined our ranks in the last year and we are 
glad to have them.  We would like to have more.

The Novemeber meeting was a high spot in this years's schedule.  Tom 
Cristiano, Tampa based carver of Calabrese pipes and importer of Mastro 
de Paja pipes, along with his wife and distributor, Mr. Topper, came to 
the meeting.  Michael from Brookline News in Brookline Massachusetts 
was the sponsor of their visit and arranged it for us.

A brief diversion.  Michael runs Brookline News.  Almost all members of 
the SHPCC know Mike and have for many years.  I sat next to a member 
who has known Mike for more than twenty years.  Others in the group 
have been shopping at Brookline News, a well hidden jewel in the Boston 
pipe community, for years, and none of us know Mike's last name. Ironic 
since we spend a good part of each meeting talking about finds we have 
made at his store and how much he adds to the pipe scene in Boston.

Back to the main story.  Mr. Cristiano brought around two hundred 
Mastros to show off and to allow us to buy at a discount from retail.  
They ranged from exquisite carved pipes in the $150 range to 
magnificent straight grained specimens at four significant digits to 
the left of the decimal point.  All works of art.  All pipes one would 
love to add to their collection.

He also showed a video of harveting briar, cutting the raw product into 
useable chunks, removing sap, and shaping into pipes at the Mastro 
factory. Next time I think a pipe is too expensive, I will rememeber 
the work which went into digging up the root and the care which went 
into shaping and finishing the pipe and be glad the price is as low as 
it is.  If any of you have a chance to see the video, which is in 
Italian, I urge that you do so.

Tom says he is readying a line of his own pipes, Calabrese, for 
distribution in the US.  He brought freehands with him, but says he is 
making traditional shapes to add to the line.  Beautiful grain, and 
terrific workmanship at very reasonable prices-- $150-250.  
Interestingly, he says the traditional shapes take more work than the 
freehands.

Turning to another subject, the fight being waged against smoking by 
the FDA and the government in general, I am starting to see signs that 
that arbitor of the American taste, television, may be swinging the 
pendulum back in our favor.  On two shows produced by David Kelly 
(Chicago Hope and Picket Fences) charecters are regularly smoking 
cigars and cigarettes.  Adam Arkin, in a made for TV movie, was seen 
smoking cigarettes, and he was the FBI guy, not the villian.  On 
Pursuit of Happiness, a third rate show, one of the main players smokes 
a pipe.

It may be too early to suggest this is a trend, but I am seeing more 
people on TV smoking and they are not the villians.  We probably are 
not going to return to the days of Twelve Angry Men or Casablanca where 
all the players smoked, but perhaps we are headed toward more tolerence 
of smoking by ordinay people.  Any thoughts from the rest of the group 
and have you seen the trend as well, if it is a trend?

Last a public message to Gregory Pease.  Greg any chance of your osting 
your collected essays some place for us to retrieve.

See you all soon.  In the meantime, smoke in peace.

Steve Wyman

[ Sorry I missed you at the Newark show, Steve!  And re the
trend... things may be loosening just the slightest little bit.  Too
early to tell.  Let us hope -- and keep on speaking out. -S. ]

Subject: Great Worldwide Smoke-in: Report

Dear Steve;

	You are making my mouth water talking about fine cigars. 
Years ago when IU worked in a tobacconist shop I acquired a tast 
for Macanudos, Royal Jamaicans and my favorite, H. Upmans.  
However, I stopped buying them over five years ago when the price 
of good cigars reached the $4.00 each minimum level.  When I can 
buy enough pipe tobacco for several hours enjoyment for the price 
of one cigar, I just can't justify the expense.  Oh for the old 
days when cigars were affordable!

			Sad about cigars but happy with my pipe,

Subject: Tobacconist in Boulder CO?

Hi Steve;

	Just to let you know, ther are two towns just to the east 
of Boulder, Louisville and Longmont where Bar patrons can still 
smoke which are specifically marketing to smokers now, and, from 
what I hear, are doing a bang up business.  I live about 40 miles 
away so I don;t know the bar names or I would post them so that 
our friends in alt,smokers.pipes could stop for one before 
entering the Peoples Republic of Boulder.

				Take care,

Tim O'Hare                    "Consistency is the last refuge
The Pros From Dover            of the unimaginative."

Subject: Thankgiving 

Hello Steve and all;
Hope everyone out there in internetland either has or will have a memorable
Thanksgiving(depending when this is posted)I am looking forward to
Thanksgiving for many reasons;I have a beautiful Wife who loves me and
doesn't yell about my pipes or cigars(except Bombay Extra)My two fantastic
sons,Paul 7&amp;Neal 4 who provide me with constant joy and a sense of what is
really important in life and finally,I am having Thanksgiving dinner in the
home of a pipe friendly Brother-in-law!In fact,he recently took up the pipe
as part of his hobby of historical re-enactments of the war of 1812(Fort
Meigs,Toledo).You see,people didn't smoke cigarettes in 1812,so if you want
to smoke during these re-enactments;you had better have a clay pipe.So,I'm
going to take a clay Churchwarden I recently bought and and a tin of
Nutcracker Flake from Levin pipes.This 1993-94 holiday issue tobacco is a
really nice dark stoved virginia mixture.That,combined with a great meal
and a bottle of Warre's 77 vintage port,should provide the start of a
truely memorable day.I think I'll take a briar along s well,I hear clays
tend to break easily :)maybe I'll even watch some football.Enjoy your
Holiday.
                    Mike Stanley
p.s.I'm still not sure what the status of Cope's Escudo is regarding its
future availability but I managed to pick up only two 50gr and four 100gr
tins total, in a search of all the pipe shops in the greater Cleveland
area.

[JR _still_ lists it, though I didn't check whether they actually had
any. -S. ]

Steve,

Please add to your Resource Guide the following establishment:

Phillip's "Bayou Humidor"
1152 Acadian Thruway
Baton Rouge, Louisana
(Tel: 504-343-1152)

This is one of those (nowadays) rare shops that still deals
exclusively with pipes, tobaccos, cigars, and smoking paraphernalia
(no gift junk!).  Phillip Eversburg, the proprietor, is a true
pipe/cigar aficionado and romantic.  In addition to the usual things,
there is a *large* pipe repair shop.  Phil is a wiz at pipe repairs
and restorations.  Very relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere!

 -- Rick Welch

[ Added, Rick. And happy Thanksgiving! -S. ]

Subject: What to drink while smoking

First, a moment to praise the angel I married. I smoke cigars outside
because I can't stand the smell of a used cigar. She let me move her
favorite leather chair and a table into our covered entryway so I could
smoke dry during the eight months of rain we get every year. When it
got cold she dug up a mat to keep my feet off the chilly cement. She
prefers I smoke the pipes inside, she loves the smell of the English blends.

So on to the question. Sometimes she feels compelled to bring me a bit of
a tipple when I'm smoking (she doesn't drink herself, but she makes a
career out of spoiling me). What should I order? I don't like to drink
Scotch while smoking, I think it detracts from the peat. I generally like
port with cigars, but I don't know anything whatsoever about ports, does
anybody have any specific recommendations? and, what else do you think
goes with a good cigar or a bowlful of strong latakia blend?

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #204 -- November 21, 1995

Hi Steve,

First let me thank you for this wonderful service. As a relatively new
subscriber I have not yet submitted a letter to the digest and it will be a
thrill to do so. 

My comments are in response to James Lawson's letter in Digest #204 in which
he describes an instance of discrimination in an airport lounge, and his
reaction to that treatment. 

Just last night I went to one of my favorite coffee shops, in Berkeley,
California. The shop has an extensive outdoor patio where smoking is
expressly prohibited. I sat down with a book I been meaning to finish and
lit my Pipe - nobody said anything. 

That incident, in and of itself, does not constitute what would normally be
referred to as news. The point is that in Berkeley, where smoking is illegal
in all public areas (this includes the sidewalk) I was able to finish not
one, but two bowls in addition to my book and a few lattes. I will add that
I have had similar successes all around the Bay Area, and not just with
pipes, but with cigars too.

What makes these victories so astounding is the fact that I remember hearing
comments a few years ago, that it was easier to get away with molesting a
child on the sidewalk in Berkeley than to smoke a cigar, my questions:
What's happening? Why is it that cigars and pipes are becoming acceptable
again? Is it that they do not subscribe to the interests of under-aged
smokers and thus, draw less "heat" from the usual sources? Is it that I am
particularly lucky in my quest for smoke inhalation? 

I would like to hear other stories of public-pipe-smoking escapades,
successes an failures. Also, I think it would be of interest to readers to
share geographically related knowledge of pipe-smoke-friendly bars,
restaurants and cafes.

Take care and thank you for your support,
-Adam.

Subject: Young Smokers of America 

&gt;        In response to the strange looks that Jason Vagner gets in the smoke
&gt;shops as a 24 year old cigar smokers, I can definitely relate, I'm an 18
&gt;year old pipe smoker.

Boy if you young guys think it is bad now try going into Rich's Cigars in
the early 70's with a 18 year old baby face that looks like not a day over
13 and clumsily trying to buy a first cigar. The place was at the time
populated by these ancient clerks and Mr. Rich himself. The guy who "waited"
on me had thick glasses, very stooped shoulders and black socks. I remember
the socks so well because I was for the most part staring at he floor.
Anyway he carded me! For a cigar! He thrust a glass tubed Bering at me, I
handed him 85 cents and that was that. 

You go in Rich's now and the kids waiting on you have goatees and piercings.
The other day I actually bought a cigar from a "girl"! She seemed like she
knew her stuff too. Yow! Part of me kind of likes the change, but still the
old place was magical and in many ways completely right. In retrospect that
right of passage was just about perfect. 

And now as then I think a cigar looks better sticking out of an older face,
mine finally fits which is both sad and a relief. So baby facers if you're
gonna smoke stogies you'll just have to go though the odd looks and
occasional titters. Rest assured you do look as silly as I did. And for God
sake take off the band. 

OK this brings up a couple of issues. 

1. Anybody else want to reminisce about their first cigars?
2. What do other long time cigar smokers make of all these new smokers and
what I call the "Cigar Aficionado Effect", (which translates basically to
"great review, now out of stock")?

Subject: Swan Vestas

&gt;&gt;anybody know of a shop that still has a cache of swan vestas for sale?
&gt;&gt;i understand they're not being manufactured anymore. 

&gt;[ Have heard nothing about them recently. Diamond matches are still
&gt;available, and IMHO are about as good as the Swans are. -S. ]

Craig Tarler and Bob Hamlin both carry Swan Vestas.

 The three (albeit slight) advantages to Swan Vestas over Diamonds and Blue 
Tips (also IMHO):

1) more "pop"
2) no sulfur
3) a really cool box

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #207 -- January 4, 1996

Dear Steve,

I have been enjoying the Pipes Digest for several months now.  Although I
have been smoking pipes for almost 20 years, in the past year or so I have
learned more from the Digest and alt.smokers.pipes than in all the other
years combined.  What an articulate and civilized group of folks the on-line
pipe smoking community is!

Here is my first contribution to the Digest.  I hope it is useful.

Thanks,

John Edlund

IN SEARCH OF THE COOL SMOKE

    Although I have been smoking a pipe for many years, recently I became
more interested in pipes and pipe smoking, and as a result I have been
smoking more.  This led to a tongue and mouth that were occasionally a little
worse for wear, and I began searching for a cooler pipe.  My arsenal of pipes
up to that point consisted entirely of mid-range pipes and seconds.  I had
good names--Peterson, Nording, Savinelli, Stanwell--but certainly nothing
from the top of the line in any mark.  However, as my fortunes had not
changed, I was not in a position to purchase a handful of Dunhills or
Castellos.  So I began to experiment with some different designs instead.

The Churchwarden

    The first pipe I bought with the cool smoke in mind was a Stanwell briar
churchwarden called the "Hans Christian Anderson" model.  This pipe came with
two bits: a standard length and a churchwarden.  (It also came with a green
Stanwell tote bag, which my wife found to be the perfect thing in which to
carry her ice skates.) The pipe is a delight to smoke and is definitely
cooler with the churchwarden bit.  I believe it is not merely the extra
length that cools the smoke.  Somehow, the extra length changes the physics
of the draw in subtle ways, making it easier not to oversmoke the pipe and
create a furnace.  The pipe stays lit with slow and meditative puffing, and
the physical length of the thing discourages one from moving about very much,
so that one does not have to even think about getting up to mow the lawn or
trim the roses.  Definitely a success in the search for the cool smoke, but
as any smoker knows, one cool pipe is not enough.

    A clay churchwarden would be another candidate for a cool smoke, but so
far I have not been able to find one at a reasonable price.  The clay is so
fragile that people in the seventeenth century bought them by the dozen, or
even by the gross.  Nowadays it seems that they are being sold as authentic
replicas of the past.  The last one I saw cost $45.  I will continue to
search.

The Calabash

    This Christmas I got a Pioneer calabash.  I had heard about the calabash
pipe, but I had never really looked at one closely.  For those who haven't
examined one, it is a simple and effective design consisting of four pieces:
a large piece of block meerschaum with a fairly large bowl bored into it, the
gourd, a black lucite ferrule, and a black lucite bit.  The meerschaum sits
on top of the gourd, held tightly in place by a cork gasket.  Although the
meerschaum doesn't exactly screw in, I was advised to turn the bowl 1/4 turn
counter-clockwise to remove it, and 1/4 turn clockwise to seat it again, and
to remove the bowl periodically to let the gourd dry out.  So far it has not
been necessary to dry it out.

    The calabash provides a very cool smoke, because of the large air
chamber in the gourd.  I have been smoking Cornell &amp; Diehl #531 in it, and it
is just delightful.  It is a large pipe, and a little heavy, so it is
definitely a stay at home smoke and not a pipe to hold in your teeth while
working on something, but it has quickly become my favorite companion with a
book.

    Smoking a calabash is almost effortless.  I rarely have to relight, and
there is never any dottle.  It smokes down to grey ash every time, and it
lasts a long time, on one occasion, through an entire samurai movie.  The
gourd has already begun to darken with use, even though I have probably only
smoked it about 10 times.

The Kirsten

    I heard about Kirstens on alt.smokers.pipes.  I sent away for their
catalogue and received it very quickly.  They call it "the world's coolest
pipe." I faxed them an order for a 1/4 bent Cavalier at $40, and received it
in six days.

    A Kirsten also consists of four basic parts--the aluminum "radiator"
stem, the valve on the front, the mouthpiece, and the screw on bowl.  The
stem comes in black, silvertone or brasstone; the mouthpiece in ebonite or
lucite, and there are several bowl shapes with a variety of finishes.  The
bowls are mostly briar, but you can also get meerschaum.  Mine has a medium
light-finished briar bowl in a shape called "mandarin."  There are several
standard packages, but in effect you can order any combination of parts you
like.

    According to the catalogue, the basic design was created by Dr. Kirsten,
an aeronautical engineer, in 1936.  He had been advised by his doctor to
switch to a pipe from cigarettes, but he didn't like the briar pipes
available to him.  He was trying to get the cooling properties of a
churchwarden into a smaller, more portable package.  The result certainly
looks like a pipe designed by an engineer.  It has a sort of "future as seen
from the past" quality, like it came from an old movie serial like Flash
Gordon, or Commander Cody and his Lost Planet Airmen.  The briar bowl just
doesn't look quite natural sitting on top of the shiny, cooling fin-equipped
aluminum barrel, but I suppose that it is a tribute to the exceptional
qualities of briar that there is no satisfactory high tech material to
replace it.  The full bent pipes in the catalogue look somewhat like
saxophones, and one large black full bent with a white meerschaum bowl
doesn't look much like anything readily identifiable at all, though it _is_
rather attractive.

    The bowl on mine, which has a nice mixed straight grain,  is wider and
shallower than most briars.  I have a bit of trouble at the beginning,
usually requiring two or more charring lights, but after you get it going it
smokes well.  There is a bit of a metallic taste until the pipe warms up.
After that, it is an enjoyable and flavorful smoke, and quite a bit of fun.

    Is it cool?  Well, as you smoke, moisture from the tobacco condenses
inside the barrel of the pipe, as the excess heat radiates from the aluminum
surface.  This moisture would have otherwise arrived at your tongue as steam,
so it is beneficial to remove it.  You can turn the valve and shut off the
draft hole, so the condensate can't leak out into the bowl when you dump the
ashes or put the pipe in your coat pocket, as tends to happen with a Peterson
system pipe.  All in all, the Kirsten works well, and delivers a smoke that
is cooler than the briar churchwarden, but not quite as cool as the calabash.
 Opinions will certainly differ on the aesthetic qualities of the Kirsten,
which may offend, intrigue or delight you, but all three pipes are noticeably
cooler than any of my standard briars, and offer a respite from tongue bite
and cooked mouth.  Of course, as always, your mileage may vary.

Subject: Newbie question

Hi pipers.  I am new to the world of pipe collecting.  I recently  
went to my local pipe shop and selected a nice briar 'second.'  With  
the purchase of the pipe I was allowed to select an ounce of tobacco.   
I chose a wonderfully aromatic blend called champagne.  It smelled  
wonderful.

Now, I have been around people smoking pipes before and have very  
much enjoyed the smell.  When I lit this thing, not one smidgen of  
the previously wonderful aroma was present...all I got was the taste  
and smell of old, stale, burnt tobacco -- quite similar to what I  
remember my old high school restroom smelling like.  This cannot be  
what pipers enjoy.  I know that something must be wrong.

Is it possible I am doing something wrong?  Or could a cheaply made  
pipe result in such a distasteful and smelly mess?  I read the howto  
docs and faqs.  Honestly, none of the smells I associate with being  
around pipe smokers in the past was present here...this was as bad as  
or worse than cheap cigarrete smoke (no offense, but cigarette smoke  
bothers me).

Any advice or instruction would be greatly appreciated...thanks.

Stephen: Thanks for sending all the issues of PD. My computer is new
and it has taken me some time to be able to access and read these
issues. Great stuff! I collect Marxman pipes - especially large pieces
and any unsmoked pipes.  I also collect Marxman advertising items and
any relevant literature. I have other pipes in addition to the
Marxmans. I also smoke Dunhills, Petersons, and Barlings. I am not a
frequent smoker, but when I do, I smoke Edward G. Robinson blend
(available from Fred Stoker &amp; Sons). This may be a silly question, but
am I contributing to PD by virtue of this letter? Or, must I submit
another way?  Thanks again.

[ No, just mail it to me.  Good luck on the Marxmans! -S. ]

Subject: cigars

Sir,
I wanted to let you know that Wilson/Lucas, Inc. of Moscow, Idaho have
produced the Rudyard Kipling poem, The Betrothed, as a suitable for framing,
full color art print (18x24). This work expresses the sentiments of cigar
smokers everywhere and of course has the famous line A WOMAN IS ONLY A WOMAN
BUT A GOOD CIGAR IS A SMOKE. If any are interested in such a product, they
can write Wilson /Lucas at P.O. Box 10001, Moscow, Idaho 83843 or call
208-883-3300. The product costs $39.95 plus shipping and handling. A
postcard version is also available and can be sent as sample on request.
One can also reach me at my email address (I am the Wilson of Wilson/Lucas).
Feel free to let anyone else who loves cigars know of this. Thank you.

Your humble servant,
Evan Wilson

[ Done, Evan!  Though I doubt that, with many women smoking cigars
these days, the poem expresses a universal sentiment... In "With Pipe
and Book" (the book, not the shop) are a couple of poems _by_ woman
cigar smokers; perhaps you'd consider putting those out as well? -S. ]

[ADMIN] I've made a few changes to the intro letter (among other
things, removing the suggestion that new members an introductory
letter.)  This was originally put in during the Dark Ages, when there
generally weren't enough submissions to fill the Digest.  As some have
pointed out, we don't have this problem anymore :-)

Subject: subscribing to pipe digest

Thanks for the pipe digest.  I've heard a lot about it.

I just filled out the registration so, here is a litttle pipe bio per 
your request:

I collect Butera and Ser Jacopo as the primary brands in my collection 
although there are plenty of other Italian and English brands along 
with some Danish pieces in my collection.  I collect mostly briars 
although I do have some meerschaum.

Shapes of interest include bent bulldogs, authors and Rhodesians; 
calabashes (briar and gourd) Oom Pauls, bent billiards and bent apples.

Blends of choice:  Full English and Matured Virginias especially 
Esoterica Tobacciana blends and Butera Latakia 1 and his several 
Virginias.

I'm an internet newbie (two days ago), but have been puffing on my 
pipes since '69; cigars since '67.  

My first pipe was a baby gift (I still have it).

I'm trying out netcom and if I try any others I'll keep you updated on 
address changes.  Thanks in advance for bearing with me on this.  I 
look forward to getting the digest.

Steve and PD Readers....

The Friends of Tobacco is a grass roots organization dedicated to 
lobbying congress and protecting smokers interests.

A primary function of FOT is to watch for dastardly legislation slipped 
in by the unholy anti-smoking legions of the night :)

The Web page is at Fuji

Dear Fellow PipePeople...

I am seeking the names and addresses of businesses and/or companies in the US
or Canada that sell refurbished used pipes (predominantly from the Sherlock
Holmes Pipe Collection series).  As well, I understand Series II of this
collection has begun...any referrals to locate this series from a Canadian
distributor (in the Toronto area)?  I'd appreciate your time in responding to
me:  ???????@????.?????.??]

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #208 -- January 14, 1996

Dear Steve, et al,

    In response to Mark Faulkner's query about meerschaums, by all means try
one!  I've been smoking pipes for the past twenty years and just bought my
first meerschaum a week ago.  It's a much drier and more pleasant smoke.  I
had avoided them in the past because the only ones I could seem to find
were, IMHO, garish and too expensive.  I obviously gave up to soon because I
found a nicely carved, small billiard SMS block for $27.  Look around,
they're out there.

tobacconist because I am so young , but thats OK.  just wanted to say
hi and thanks for all the info.

Hello everybody -

I wanted to leave a quick message for those of you who are trying to reach
the Pulvers' Prior Briar tel #.  The authentic # is now: 1-800-863-PIPE -
not 415-691-0338 - Please make a note of it.  Your orders should be
processed much faster now.

I just lit up a reconditioned pipe from L&amp;Co - and it smokes great.  I just
tried Margate tobacco, and it looks like it's going to be one of my
favorite blends on my very small list.

I just got # 208 - Thanks Steve!

Subject: Kabik Pipe

I don't smoke my pipes very much these days (mostly cigars), but I
have one pipe I've never quite been able to sell, give away, or store
in a closet.  It's a straight-grain freehand that I bought about 20
years ago.  On the back, under the stem, it's inscribed "Sculptur by
Kabik."  I was given to understand that the pipe maker carved pipes
for Ben Wade, and also sold pipes under his own name.

    Do you, or any PD readers, know anything about this pipe?

    Also, thanks very much for PD -- it's always a welcome arrival in 
the E-mailbox.

From: ????????@??????.??? (Paul J. Ste. Marie)
Subject: Cracking Meerschaums

&gt;My meerschaum is carved as an eagle's claw holding the bowl from
&gt;underneath. ... One other day, I looked at the shank and thought I saw a
&gt;hairline crack 1/2 way up. Hmm, was that there from day one? Hmm, the crack
&gt;gets bigger after the bowl heats up, yep, it's a crack to be sure. Then
&gt;last night I was having another great smoke and was finishing up and I
&gt;*heard* what sounded like a crack coming from the pipe. What a horrifying
&gt;sound to hear! This morning I looked at the shank again; it's definately a
&gt;crack.
&gt;
&gt;Do you suppose that I just got an inferior pipe or are all the meerschaums
&gt;this fragile?

Two possibilities--1) the crack was there to begin with or 2) you've let a 
cake build up in the meerschaum.  DO NOT LET A CAKE DEVELOP IN A 
MEERSCHAUM!!!!  The meerschaum is softer than the cake and it will crack 
very easily, since the cake expands with heat faster than the meeschaum 
does.  You can ream it out, but you've got to be very careful in the 
process--the reamer will remove meerschaum faster than cake, so you've got 
to watch for spots where you've reamed away the cake and stay away from those.
The other big no-no with meerschaum is tapping out the ash, especially while 
holding the stem or shank.  This is a good way to knock the bowl right off 
the pipe.  To empty a meerschaum tip it upside down, and if the ash doesn't 
fall out on its own use a pipe tool to gentle loosen it.  Don't dig at the 
pipe.  Wiping out the bowl after use with a cotton cloth (old t-shirts are 
good for this) will help keep a cake from forming.  Any sticky tar deposits 
can be **gently** scaped away with a pipe tool.

Two basic principles to always remember with a meerschaum:

1)  No cake.  It doesn't need one, and a cake will split it apart.

2)  Never apply any sort of force on the shank relative to the bowl--eg no 
tapping, no holding the shank while reaming, etc.

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #208 -- January 14, 1996

Any insurance agents out there?  I've been doing some consulting work for a
local agency that does business over the internet, and the question of rate
discrimination for cigar and pipe lovers came up.  There was an article in
the Fall Cigar Aficianado that listed some insurance carriers that offer
non-smoker rates for cigar smpkers.  However, these were all "captive"
agencies (those whose agents can sell policies only for that particular
company).  Are there any non-captive companies that offer separate rates?  I
understand the reasoning is that they give a qualification physical that
tests for nicotine in the blood, and cannot differentiate between cigarettes
and other forms of tobacco.  I'm wondering why the captive companies can
offer lower rates.

Subject: Lighter repairs &amp; Barling pipe's history

Dear Steve:

Thank you for changing my address. As for the question of Pat Barling about 
information on the history of Barling pipes (PD 208), R. Hacker's book "The 
ultimate pipe book" has a good synopsis about that subject. Also there is an 
excellent article "A smoker's guide to Barling" by T. Gage in "Pipe 
Friendly" vol. 1, # 3 pp. 7, 1995.

There was also an inquiry sometime ago about a place which can repair 
expensive cigarette and pipe lighters (Dunhill, Dupont, Christian Dior, 
etc.). The following is the address of an excellent place which you can add 
to the directory:

Authorized Repair Service
30 West 57th Street
NYC, NY 10019
Tel: 212-586-0947
FAX: 212586-1296

I have also noticed in your update of the directory that you did not include 
as per PD 195 the excellent pipe and tobacco store her in Birmingham AL This 
store has a larger and better quality pipe selection than many of the big 
name stores I have visited around the country. For your convenience, the 
name and address again is: 

The Briary
741B Brookwood Village
Birmingham, AL 35209
Tel 205-871-2839.

Thanks

[ Occasionally I drop 'em... thanks for the recap! -S.]

Subject: PD 208

Dear Steve,

I subscribe to the PD under a different e-mail address
(??????????@???.???). Haven't written for some time, but there was a
notice in the latest issue about Gawith Hoggarth &amp; Co. I have dealt
with Bob Lynch for about a year, and I find many of his tobacs
outstanding. It is the only place I know for gettin STRONG
tobacs. These include the twists, dark flake, and my favorite, Bob's
square cut. Bob Lynch, the proprietor will be away from home from the
end of January until mid April. Lucky man! At any rate, those who try
to contact them will probably face a lengthy delay because of this.
In his brochure, Bob includes an alternative address: Tom Colwell 325
Germonds Rd.  W. Nyack, NY 10994.  I haven't tried him, so can't vouch
for results.  Regards, Michael Braun

Subject: Stephen Y's pipe smoking &amp; youth post

     Dear Steve, Stephen Y. &amp; fellow PD subscribers,
     
     I tried to respond directly to Stephen Yenchko's post to PD 208, but 
     the message was returned. Looking it over again, I suppose it's OK to 
     post to the Digest. Maybe Stephen will get my scribblings this way. 
     --------------------------------------------------

     Dear Stephen ....
     
     I wrote to say that I found your recent post to the PD interesting and 
     informative. I wasn't sure exactly what document/message/topic you 
     were responding to, but I was intrigued by your insights concerning 
     pipe and cigar smoking among youth. 
     
     I was principally interested in the topic because, even at my age 
     (33), I have felt over the past few years very inhibited by the 
     prospect of smoking my pipe in public. I was encouraged to know that 
     you have noticed this contradictory social prohibition and taken a 
     course of action among your peers. Although I can't say I've shared 
     the experiences you described, I tend to agree with a few of your 
     premises and would like to see the culture surrounding pipe and cigar 
     smoking to continue its evolution. I would also like to see in the     
     general public a recognition that pipe and cigar smoking are practices 
     which are entirely distinct from the more conventional (ab)uses of     
     tobacco in U.S. culture.
     
     As I mentioned, I have felt of sorts as a pipe smoker. I think I first 
     started smoking a pipe (in secret, of course) when I was 16. At 18, I 
     went to university, where I fairly quickly made several friends who 
     also smoked pipes occasionally. This was not an act motivated by a 
     reaction to the social environment, but by an attraction to the 
     pleasures of smoking fine tobacco. All during my undergrad. and 
     graduate school days, pipesmoking was relatively common among my 
     classmates, so it didn't seem at all odd to be a pipesmoker in my age 
     group. It was also an activity that marked camaraderie and friendship. 
     I was not alone, and pipe smokers were generally not socially 
     marginalized, certainly not in my social milieu. In fact, a visible 
     proportion of 17- to 22-year-old undergraduates smoked pipes on my 
     campus. After a time, though, it somehow became less socially 
     acceptable to be seen smoking anything. While I have certainly 
     welcomed the general prohibition against smoking in public places, I 
     don't really consider my sometimes infrequent pipesmoking to fall into 
     the same category as the most common form of tobacco (ab)use. It is 
     not a physical or chemical addiction for me (sometimes I don't 
     smoke my pipe for weeks at a time). However, the only places (other 
     than home and foreign countries) where I feel truly comfortable 
     smoking are pipe shops. And even there, I sometimes get an occasional 
     odd look - because (I'm sometimes told) I still don't quite look my 
     age. I've met a few fellow pipe smokers on my periodic trips to the 
     tobacconist and elsewhere, but my sense is that many of us feel 
     inhibited. One thing I have noticed over the last year, however, is 
     that pipes and cigars are appearing on my campus with more frequency. 
     I think a small portion of the student population may have begun to 
     appreciate the aesthetic qualities of the pastime.  
     
     Thanks for the interesting post.
     
          John

[ Glad to hear it! Perhaps one of these days we'll return to
acceptability. -S. ]

have any pipes made for the clan, if so how to get my hands on one.
	I have also heard that there are some blends made in Ireland,
Again how to get my paws on some to try out.  I know that the family
has a castle Museum Called Tullynally Castle. Tel No (044)61159/61425

Subject: younger cigar smoker

hi,

My name is Andy Hacker. I'm 23 years old and I've been smoking cigars for
over 2 years now and I love them. Unfortunatly, I don't have many friends who
are cigar smokers themselves. So basically I end up smoking outside on my
own(pretty rough huh?) Anyway, I don't mind it that much. 
My first cigar experiences were over 2 summers ago and Phillies Titans, which
since then I'm well beyond them. Soon after  that came the first cigar shop I
ever set foot into, in Hartford CT,  and to tell the truth I felt like a kid
in a candy store. I had no idea what to get, but I wanted one of everything.
I ended up with a Macanudo and an Oscar. I kept going back, and now i visit
 2 shops local to me in NJ and when I'm in New York I visit Nat Sherman,
which is a beautiful place.  My personal favorites are Nat Sherman
Telegraphs, Macanudo  Prince Phillips, Ashton 8-9-8s and Las Cabrillas
DeSotos. Although when I was starting out I did have the luck of trying my
first Cuban cigar(and only to this point) A Cuban Montecristo, and that was
the smoothest cigar I've had to this point. 
Unfortunatly, as I said there aren't to many cigar smokers my age in this
area. If anyone knows of cigar groups in the central NJ area I'd like to find
out about them. I know of one in Trenton and one in Wayne,NJ but I figure
that they are for an older crowd.  My e-mail  is ????????@???.???
thank you

Subject: Grant's in San Francisco

In issue #208, someone wanted to know why "Grant's" pipe shop in San
Francisco was not on the resource guide.  Here is the address
Grant's 
Pipes, Tobaccos, Fine Cigars
564 Market St.
San Francisco
(415) 981-1000

I have only bought pipe tobacco there.  The blend I like from Grant's in
called "No. 2131".  It's got a bit of Latakia in it so I guess that it's an
English style.  Grants pipe selection was o.k.
The Bay Area shop that I think is just great is Sherlock's Haven.  I have
never seen so many pipes in one store ever.  And there prices seemed very
good.  They had a Petersen system pipe selling for around $30 and I remember
buying the same pipe 8 or 10 years ago in Houston for around $40 to $45.  The
next pipe I get will probly be from Sherlock's Heaven.

The last pipe I bought was from the "Piedmont Tobacconist"  in Oakland CA.
 It was made by a maker in Santa Cruz CA by the name of "Andre".  The pipe
only cost $25 but it  smokes great!    The pipe is  a small straight pipe
with an apple bowl.  I'm very glad to know that you don't have to spend a
fourtune to get a great pipe.

Subject: Cigars and Pipes:  Truly an art form

Hi, All!   

I hope that everybody is enjoying the new year and I would just like to
remind everybody that cigar aficianado George Burns turns 100 years old (yes,
100 years old!) on Saturday, January 20!

By the way,  in the last post, you said:

"smoke is definitely not a good thing for computers."

I don't know about you guys (and girls), but I don't enjoy smoking near the
computer.  First of all, it causes damage.  And I am not in the position
where I have the time to clean or replace my equipment.  

Second of all,  to me, smoking is not a "thing;" it is an art.  To me, it is
not done while watching tv or using the computer.  Smoking is something that
should be savored.  It is what should be done while sipping fine cognac,
talking with friends, or after enjoying a heavy meal.   

Smoking is not an addiction, it is a form of relaxation.

Anyway, this is just my opinion.

Mike  (?????????@???.???)

[ Well, IMHO, one can rlax while at the computer or TV, too... to each
his or he own. -S.]

John Edlund &lt;???????@??????????.???&gt;  in PD 208 wrote that he had recently
tried a Calabash pipe.  I have not seen any Calalbash pipes in the stores

Subject: Pipes and Poems

Steve,

	I am fairly new to pipe smoking and PD, so this is my first post.
In my area there are not more than 2 or 3 smoke shops that I know of, and 
the ones that there are do not seem to be geared towards pipes but more 
towards cigars and buying bulk cigarettes.  I started smoking with a 
second that I got at the one store that carries an assortment of pipes.  
I would like to get a few better pipes but have not been able to locate 
any of the names normally seen in PD.  Here's my question, finally.  The 
store owner has, and recommends, Alpha's. Are these pipes worth buying, 
and does anybody have any opinions about the Alpha's?

	On a different note I recently read the last issue of PD in which 
Paul Kupferschmidt  submitted poems from "Pipe and Pouch."  I have also 
recently read this entire collection and ironically enough was going to 
mention it in my first letter to PD.  This book contains poems on 
smoking that express my own and many others view,s which I am sure anybody 
who subscribes to PD would love.  It is my favorite book of poetry which 
I intend to buy as soon as I can find it.  I highly recommend it to 
everyone in this group.

	That is about all for now so until next time, happy puffing.

Chris Bolstad

Subject: Condor &amp; Pipe Digest

Hi Steve,

In thinking about my second message canceling the first message in this
particular series, I'd really prefer if you'd cancel both those messages,
and put this as a more suitable reply -- a good supply of Condor has done
wonders for my mood.

&gt;From: ?????????@???????.??.??.??
&gt;Subject: A belated introduction

&gt;I was particularly interested in one item in the latest PD (no 207 if 
&gt;memory serves) about the availability (or not) of Condor in the US. 
&gt;Interested, and bemused, as here in the UK Condor is regarded as a 
&gt;supermarket/drugstore tobacco, rather than as a premium tobacco that 
&gt;one would actively seek out. I've never tried it, so I'm speaking from 
&gt;ignorance here :-). 

Wow!  Condor available in supermarkets!  Fantastic!  I always thought the
U.K. civilized. :)

--Chet

P.S. I've received orders from John Turner and G. Smith &amp; Sons (both very
pleasant and both received in little over a week).  I've also received a
pleasant note from another U.K. tobacconist (and I have to update my Condor
availability page).

[Both previous messages cancelled, as per your request. -S.]

Subject: MAGNUM-PLUS Size Pipes

Is anyone out there interested in BIG, MAGNUM-PLUS size pipes and cigars?

I have been smoking a pipe for 20 years now, and have always looked for the 
largest possible pipes.  I am a fan of big pipes for the sake of 
their appearance and for the way they draw.  A major part of my enjoyment in 
pipesmoking is inhaling the smoke, rather than just puffing away - this tends 
to heat the bowl up quickly.  I have found that the larger the bowl, the easier
it is to smoke for longer periods of time without overheating the pipe. 

For the last six years, I have been collecting pipes from JM Boswell,
170 South Main St, Chambersburg, PA 17201, phone (717)264-1711.  My
latest pipe is a nearly perfect straightgrain quarter-bent billiard
(length 14", height 3.5", and inside bowl diam 1.5"- 1 oz tobacco
capacity).  The workmanship is beautiful and the draw is excellent.

My longest Boswell is 22", but the biggest one overall is a rough carved finish
billiard/Canadian 14" long, 7" high, and an inside bowl diam of 1.5".  The
airhole is 1/4" from the bowl to the tip of the bit, which is custom made of
clear lucite. You can literally breathe through this pipe without having to 
pull hard.  This one holds about 1.5 oz of tobacco, usually English. 

I would like to share information/pictures with Magnum Pipesmokers.
I'm always looking for a source for bigger bowls!  My address is:
?????????????????????@????.????.???

Subject: Pipe Stuff

Steve,

  Thanks for the great work you're doing on PD. It's a real pleasure to sit
for a time with a fine pipe, a glass of spirits, and the wealth of insights
in these pages.

   A couple of issues back, you asked about pipes with multiple (fixed)
bowels.  Here are the specifics for the work of a local - west coast -
carver.   His pipes have 3 bowls on seperate branches.  Each is removable
(for cleaning).  The bowls and stem are attached with Jobey fitments. There
is a slight dip to them like the old safari pipes.  There are no valves, you
would have to cap one or two bowls when not in use.  These pipes are made
from 3 blocks of briar in apple shape.  Smooth  =$300.00 &amp; Blast (somewhat
smaller) =$200.00. 

  Apologies for not mentioning the carver by name, but he is retired and
doesn't want publicity.  I can only say that I have over a dozen of his
pieces and am quite satisfied with all of them.  If you or anyone else wants
to get one of these pipes, I'll act as his unpaid agent.  Lastly (I hope I
don't say this badly)... this is not his favorite style to make, but he'll do
it if you're truely interested.

  On another matter Bill Unger (for C.H.'Sarge' Stock) asked about TB#1:
 
 The Tinder Box Wilshire (the 1st store)
 2729 Wilshire Blvd.
 Santa Monica, CA  90403 
 (310) 828-4511.  
 Ed Kolpin Sr. still in charge.

  Also, belated congrats on your marriage.  I wish you much happiness.

  Lastly, I'll put in a shameless plug for PIPE FRIENDLY.  With the February,
1996 issue, we're going international (world wide).  Please E-mail for
details.

Until later ... Smoke Well!

[Shameless, Joel!  Thanks for the info.  The price is a bit steep for
a tr-out, but maybe something will turn up in the prr-owned market.
Or I'll get busy and try carving my own. -S.]

Subject: Pipe Sweetening

I saw the question in the latest PD about pipe sweetening.  I worked at a 
Tinder Box for 17 years.  We used to refresh and refurbish pipes for 
customers. I always told people not to use bottled  sweetener. First the 
stuff has mint flavorings, not something I want in my pipe. The main 
ingredient for sweetening is alcohol.  I use and suggested using your 
favorite whiskey, vodka or bourbon.  Place the pipe in a single stand or an 
ashtray(without the stem) and fill the bowl with the booze of choice. Let 
stand for a few minutes then wipe out the bowl with paper toweling.  Run 
pipe cleaners through the air hole until they come out clean.

If the stem is not Lucite, dip a pipe cleaner in the booze and run it 
through the stem. If the stem is Lucite, use only warm water and soap to 
clean. alcohol will melt Lucite!
Let the bowl and stem dry for a day then enjoy!

In extreme cases of sour pipes use this method: fill the bowl with table 
salt, let stand for a day, dump it all out and then do the booze treatment. 
 The most important thing is to let your pipe rest and air out. Smoking the 
same pipe over and over will yield a very sour pipe.

I know many readers are very young and would not remember the hey-day of 
pipe smoking in the mid to late 70's. Working at the Box was great then, we 
blended custom blends mixes for hundreds of smokers.  The store record for 
Camminetto sales in one day was 17!  Some guys would by a premium pipe every 
time they came in!

I taught many, many people how to pack their first bowl and loved the look 
on their faces when they puffed their first puff as a pipe smoker. I tried 
to help the younger fellows by sharing as much knowledge as I could, for 
they were and are the future of pipe smoking!

Please add another shop to the resource list. It's a new shop in Michigan 
City, Indiana.
"The Golden Leaf"
232 W. Fourth Street. Michigan City, IN 46360
219.872.9692

This place has a room to sit, smoke, sip coffee and talk smoke! The owner's 
name is Phil.

Keep on puffin!
Wayne Samardzich

[ Thanks, Wayne!  Is the Golden Leaf a small chain?  There was a
report of another shop by the same name, in Minneapolis, in PD
#206. And, also, the pipe shop cum smoking room may just be the wave
of the future. -S. ]

&gt;Hello Steve,
        As you can see, I received Digest #206. I have not received #207 or
#208. My provider has been upgrading again and put up a new mail server, so
this may be the reason. My E-mail address is still good as
?????@????.???????.??? as far as I know since I've been getting other mail.
I don't mean to whine - I can always print them from the Website, but it's
somehow more exciting to get them in the inbox.
        I've been smoking Craig Tarler's blends all the time now. #971PV and
531P. The pressing of the tobacco into bricks does indeed seem to marry the
individual ingredients of each blend. Craig has been super and the service
and the product are top quality. As you know, I'm sure' he's in the new
quarters now and Cornell&amp;Diehl should really be cranking out even more of
the good stuff.
        Thanks for the great service you have done to the whole community of
smokers --... ...--

Subject: What to drink

Dear Steve,

Instead of writing a paper for an Art History class, I browsed over the
latest Pipes Digest and found that we (being the "pipies") haven't settled
on the perfect beverage to accompany a pipeful of tobak.  Since this debate
(?) seems like it will be around until there are no longer matches on the
face of the earth, I thought I'd add my two cents.  Some time back, someone
(the name escapes me) posted several times extolling the virtues of a tea
called lapsang suchon and its compatability with a pipe, especially one
filled with an English style blend.  Sounded interesting at the time, but I
dismissed it since I never thought I would run into such a blend of tea.
Wrong again.  Turns out, the stuff is more readily available than the
exotic name may suggest.  The tea has an unmistakeable smokey scent,similar
to some Scotches.  But, as any good pipey knows, the scent can be quite
different from the actual taste, and this is just the case.  Lapsang suchon
has a very smoky aroma, but the flavor of the tea is much more straight
forward- not bitter, and nearly sweet.  From my experience, it does
accompany an English blend quite well, and not being much of an aromatic
smoker myself, I think it may lend itself nicely to all but the sweetest of
aromatics.  The stuff isn't expensive at all, and is IMHO certainly worth a
go.  Check out your local coffee shop for the smoky stuff.  As a final
word, I prefer to enjoy fine Scotch and fine tobacco separately, as I would
hate to slight either of their deserved attention.
Happy puffing and sipping,
Patrick North

Subject: Meerschaum

Steve --

Some etymological/geographical meanderings of possible interest to 
others......Meerschaum:

I must confess to having a fetish (some would say obsession!) with
origins.  This weekend, while puffing away on my Astley's meerschaum 
that my wife (with heavy hinting) gave me for Xmas, I had a spurt of 
interest in probing into the origin thereof.  As we all know, the word 
is German, "sea foam," apparently arising from the early notion that 
the material was compressed foam from the sea.  (Transliterally, the 
word is "ecume de mer" in French.)

Recently, I was browsing in Philip Eversberg's library at his shop, the
BAYOU HUMIDOR, in Baton Rouge.  From time to time, I delve into the book,
TOBACCO ENCYCLOPEDIA, edited by Ernst Voges (published in Germany by
Tobacco Journal International, 1984).  Voges says that, contrary to popular
belief, Meerschaum comes from the lingua franca (the old, mixed-tongue
trading lingo used betweeen the Mediterranean countries and the Eastern
states) word, "mertschavon."  -- Voges does not give any reference for
this assertion, so I don't know if his claim is reliable.

With piqued interest, I delved into my dear companion, the Oxford English
Dictionary.  The OED says that Meerschaum is a transliteration of the
Persian word, "kefidarya," meaning "foam of the sea" (no surprise!).
Now, I found in the OED a rare, obsolete minerology word, "keffekill,"
which is derived from the Persian "kefigil," meaning "foam of clay."
Also, the OED has an old minerology word, "keffekilite," defined as
"a greyish lithomarge found in the Crimea." -- As the geographical readers
of PD will be quick to note, the Crimea is a peninsular region in the
former USSR, protruding into the northern Black Sea (due north from Turkey,
whose northern part forms the Black Sea's southern shore).  Curiously,
there is a town in the Crimea called "Keffe."

We may never know the ultimate historical context of this wonderful stuff
we call Meerschaum!  One thing is certain:  It was well known (and used for
a variety of purposes, including *soap*) long before the time of the
famous legend of the Hungarian Count Andrassy's visit to Turkey -- and the
ensuing employment of Meerschaum for pipes by the aristocracy.  The Turks,
themselves, were probably using the mineral locally for pipes before the
ol' Count's trip. -- Voges, in the aforementioned Encyclopedia, states that
the Turkish word for Meerschaum is "luletashi," meaning "pipe stone."

Amongst this hodge-podge melting pot of information, I lean toward the
Persian association, since their influence in that region long preceded the
Ottoman Turkish period.

A coincidence regarding the Crimea...... The Crimean War in the 1850's
apparently played a significant role in exposing Europeans and British
taste buds to the delights of Turkish/Oriental tobaccos.  They were allied
with the Turks (against the Russians) during that war (e.g., see Carl
Ehwa's book).

I would be interested in additional information on the history of Meerschaum
from PD readers.

All for now,
Rickey Welch

Hi Steve,

I've included a couple of photos of Mark Tinsky pipes to go along with my
Mark Tinsky page:

                Dear Mr. Edlund:
                        I was just reading the latest issue of Pipe Digest
#208 ans came upon your letter you submitted after issue #207. In your
letter you speak about Kirsten pipes. I have several of them that I
purchased in my youth ( smile ). They have been well used I can tell you.
However a couple of them have to be repaired and when I tried to get them
repaired where I purchased them, I was informed that Kirsten had gons out of
business - even the 800 number I had written down doesn't work. You sound as
if you know of a new way to contact them. If you could help me out I would
be very grateful. Thank you - Jim McKinney Jr., 2065 Knox Road 850E, Wataga,

Subject: Address change for PD

Steve,

[Administrativa deleted. -S.]

I've been reading PD for a few months now and I find it tremendously
interesting. Keep up the good work!

A note for those who are having trouble viewing the large filesize PD. Load
the file into a word processor instead of using your system text editor or
mail reader. Text editors are intended for the creation and editing of
small text files such as scripts or program code that is to be linked to
other code at compilation time. Larger documents are the domain of word
processors.

Any word processor should do. I have used both WordPerfect and ClarisWorks
on the Mac to read the digest. Currently, I am using WordPerfect because it
allows me to reformat the text with a macro. My macro removes the hard
carriage returns, changes the point size of the text for easier onscreen
reading and then adjusts the margins so that the text will fill my screen.
I will share this macro with anyone who is interested. It is not perfect
but is a good start.

I never print the PD. Whenever I run across an interesting entry, I simply
copy that text to a separate file and save it in an appropriate folder on
my disk. Thus I have folders relating to tobacco, pipe maintenance,
histories, shops and suchlike.

Doug

[ Thanks for the advice, Doug!  I'm sure many readers will find it
helpful. -S. ]

Subject: Lee Van Cleef

Hi Steve,

Last Sunday I viewed the Sergio Leone film trilogy starring Clint Eastwood
and Lee Van Cleef on TNT.  Although I have seen these movies several times, I
continue to be struck by the pipe that Lee Van Cleef smoked in the second
movie "For a Few Dollars More."  It is  large, 3/4 bent, tan in color, and
appears to be a sandblast.  It seems to have an amber (or maybe bone) stem.
 What a pipe!

Have any readers seen a pipe like the one in the movie?  I'd like any
information (even anecdotal) regarding it.  Perhaps one of the large pipe
manufacturers put out a "Lee Van Cleef" model after the movie came out in
1966.  Maybe one of the custom pipe makers such as Alberto Bonfiglioli could
duplicate the pipe.

I wish I had taped the movies (they were shown in the letter-box format).  To
me, just the image of Van Cleef slowly and deliberately lighting that pipe,
makes the movie memorable.  He looks legit' smoking a pipe.  When I recently
saw the movie "Apollo XIII" I thought that a couple of the actors (smoking
brand new pipes!) looked a little phony.  Did anyone else think so?

James Lawson     aka   BriarPipes

******************************************************************************
******"The aluminum linoleum has a minimum of lanolin with a modicum of
molybdenum."     Say this 3 times rapidly, with a pipe clenched in teeth.
******************************************************************************

[Well, James, Mr. Van Cleef might not be the perfect role model for
pipe smokers, since he played the "heavy" in the spaghetti
Westerns. But he did indeed look like he knew what he was doing with
hs pipe... BTW, ever see "Gettysburg"? -S.]

Subject:       S.G.'s Report

Hello All,

I would like to enlist the help of our other _Pipes Digest_ readers in 
tracking down a document.

Recently, a letter in the _Pipes Digest_ contained a quote from 
the Surgeon General's report which may first have appeared in an 
installment of _Pipes Digest_ about a year ago.

The quote as used stated that pipe smokers have longer life 
expectancies than non-smokers.  The source was cited as: "Surgeon 
General's Report, Public Health Service Publication #1103, pp. 92 and 
112."

Unfortunately:

1.  The _Surgeon General's Report_ and the _Public Health Service 
Publication_ are *two* separate publications.  

2.  None of either publication have numbers like "1103", only 
dates of publication.  

I work in the George Mason University Library where we have many of 
the GPO documents and I would like to see the entire publication to 
read the text for myself.  

Can anyone offer a correction for the title, page numbers or other 
information for locating the said document and quote?

Many thanks for any help,

John

Subject: In Search of Clean Air

I submitted a posting to the Pipes Digest in #206 asking about what
people do to keep the inside are odor-free during the winter months.
I thought I would share some of the responses which I received.

Ralph T. Webb highly recommends an aril called OZIUM which removes
odors from the air.  I bought some in the automotive section at K-Mart
to give it a try. A small spray can costs as much as a decent cigar!
I got about 4 night's use from the tiny can. Definitely clears up a
lot (but not all) of the smell.  I later found through the CompuServe
Wine forum that this product is available at warehouse clubs such as
Sam's Club in a BIG spray can which is much more economical. I'll
still use it, but only in the economy size.  Interesting note on
OZIUM; it contains Propylene Glycol, the same stuff used in Credos to
maintain a constant humidity in our humidors! OZIUM works by keeping
very fine droplets airborne for quite some time, which allows the
absorption of airborne stink particles, for lack of a better term.  I
suppose the PG doesn't evaporate like water would, so it does a better
job than just misting with water.  I read some people would mist with
plain water to _knock down_ the smoke. I would think you would have
smelly carpeting after the droplets settled.

I also tried _smoker's candles_ which are about 3 inched in diameter
with a small core of green stuff that melts with the wax and burns off
something to neutralize the smoke.  This did a tremendous job of
keeping the smoke and haze away. I had some friends over with 4 of
these candles going and after about 9 cigars, there was no smoke
hanging in the air.  However, the next morning it still smelled like
an ash tray in the house.  They helped, but like the OZIUM, did not
eliminate the smell completely.  Perhaps I should have left them
buring all night? I had to sprinkle the carpeting with Carpet Fresh
and really air the place out.  Unfortunately the temperature dropped
from a balmy 40 F to a chilly 10F that afternoon!

Yet another suggestion from the Compuserve forum was to place a bowl
of vinegar overnight in the room he smoked in.  I haven't tried it,
but one pipie said it worked great.  It has something to do with the
acid in the vinegar reacting with something in the smoke that was
alkiline, but I am not a chemistry expert.  I haven't tried it yet.  I
wonder if misting the air with vinegar would work?

My quest for clean smelling air at home has been greatly assisted by
the opening of a new tobacconist in Minnetonka, just a few miles out
of my way home from the office.  J.T. Tobacconist has a smoking lounge
with nice leather furnishings, dart boards, a very large humidor which
will soon contain lockers you may rent and a nice selection of
cigars. All the accessories you would need too, such as humidors,
cutters, lighters, ashtrays. Not being a pipe smoker (yet) I have not
really assessed the pipe collection, but there seems to be a range in
prices from $20 to over $100.  The pipe tobacco is in a dozen or so
jars on the counter. The owners, Jeff and Tim, are very nice and
support a great atmoshpere.  They are willing to give you assistance
in selecting smokes, but won't give unsolicited (read arrogant)
advise.  Great place to stop on the way home from work. There happens
to be a liquor store accross the street with a fine selection of
single-malts, and Jeff keeps a stock of paper cups on hand just in
case. :) If you stop in, let them know how you heard of them.

J.T. Tobacconist
17613 Minnetonka Blvd.   (At the intersection of hwy 101 and Minnetonka Blvd)
Minnetonka, MN  

I think this is enough for one submission.  Keep the fires burning!

Dear Steve,
I just got to read PD#208 and found it very enjoyable and useful as 
usual.  I wonder if I could get a current issue of the Resource 
Guide?  I've just received some tobacco from a new Pipe Digest 
subscriber in Germany, and found it not only quite good but quite 
different from anything I have smoked.   Two of the blends are 
Lotzbect and Graf Luckner (Sea Devil).  There seems to be a slight 
flavor of what I have come to identify with Irish tobaccos ( and I 
wonder if anyone can identify that for me).  The Lotzbect Latakia 
Melange is even quite beautiful in the pouch, with a variety of textures and 
colors. I wonder if German tobaccos are available in the U.S., and if 
there are any German brands of pipes available as well.  I have never 
seen either for sale here, in many years of pipe smoking.  Which 
leads to another question: are there decent brands (not the work of 
individual carvers) of pipes produced in countries other than the 
ones generally associated with pipe production? I have an Israeli 
pipe with a bamboo shank I picked up at a pipe show, and I believe 
Alpha used to be produced there, but is now made in the U.S. (?)  
Perhaps some of your international coterie of subscribers could share 
some information about local pipes?  
BTW, in the same package with the German tobacco was a tin of Fox's 
Banker's Mixture, a product of James J. Fox &amp; Co. Ltd., of Dublin and 
London.  I had never heard of it before, and it was a wonderful 
treat. It is one of the best English (not Irish) type blends I have 
ever smoked.  Listed on the tin as "A Rich Medium Blend," I find the 
combination of full flavor and aroma coupled with a cool, mild smoke 
unique in my 35 years of smoking.  If I can part with some, I send it 
to Craig at Cornell &amp; Diehl and ask him to clone it for me.  I will 
be writing to Gawith-Hoggarth English Tobaccos, mentioned in #208, to 
see if it is available.  

The best to you and yours, and the rest of the sotweed fanciers,
Spencer Schein

Subject: Looking for Humidor Plans

Greetings, fellow lovers of The Leaf!

I was reading some of the back issues of the Digest (about 162, I
think the Fall of '94) and came across a posting from ???????@???.???.
He had humidor plans which he was willing to sell for $5 a pop.  I
tried to e-mail him regarding the offer and the message was bounced
back. Does anyone know of his whereabouts?  I would like to make a
humidor, and the plans were to have extensive how-to's on construction
techniques, so I thought it would helpful. He left a snail-mail
address which I am also trying: Chavete, PO Box 5561, Slidell, LA
70469.

Did anyone else on the list purchase the plans and make one of Chavete's 
humidors?

I have heard people asking about construction of humidors but I have
never seen much of a reply. I would think out of our readership of
close to 2000 that there would be some knowledgeable
smokers/woodworkers with some construction hints to share. I have read
the Humidor FAQ from Bob Curtis (if I recall correctly) and it had
some good info, but not a lot on construction techniques that I find
valuable.

Subject: Pipe Cleaning

Steve, I thought I'd try a reply to Wayne Baker's query in the last
newsletter about pipe sweetener and refreshing pipes.  My feeling is that
one should refresh his (or her) pipes every six months or a year, depending
on how heavily you smoke them and how badly your tobacco tends to produce
gunk (i.e., aromatics). Wayne is correct--the commercial pipe sweetener is
expensive, and it's mostly alcohol anyway.  So get you a sufficient
quantity of the highest proof grain alcohol you can obtain.  Some states
still sell a high-proof drinking alcohol that's almost pure (Everclear, I
think it's called), although Ohio doesn't for some reason.  If you have to
get the alcohol with the poison in it that prohibits drinking, do it.
Everything is going to evaporate before you smoke the pipe again, so it
can't hurt you.
 
Ream your bowl down to the thickness of a nickel.  Start with the stem and
run alcohol-soaked bristly pipe cleaners through it until they come out
clean.  (You can wipe the cleaners off on a rag and keep reusing them.)
Then get a bunch of q-tips, soak them the ends in alcohol and clean out
that part of the shank before the air hole until the q-tips come out clean.
Then use bristly cleaners again to clean out the shank from the air hole
down to the bottom of the bowl (there must be technical terms for these
pipe parts, but I don't know them), again til they come out clean.
Finally, double a soft, thin pipe cleaner and insert it down the shank (so
the alcohol won't run out).  Fill the bowl with table salt and then, being
careful not to overfill (I use an eyedropper), fill the bowl with alcohol.
Let sit upright for 24 hours.  Dump out the dried, discolored salt, use the
doubled pipe cleaner to clean off the sides of the bowl, and blow through
the shank.  Repeat if the pipe still is sour, but this should do the trick.

If you've got one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you've got more than
one, you're a pipe collector.

Subject: Meerschaum Pipes

Dear Steve;
I am a newcomer to pipe smoking since October of 95. I have a 
"collection" of primarily Dr. Grabow drugstore Briar pipes. I currently 
have a total of five (5) briar pipes. Is there a lot of difference 
between drug store pipes and more exspensive pipes that I could buy at a 
pipe store?  Some pipe smokers tell me yes there is a difference others 
tell me I am wasting my money. The basic question is why spend 35-50 
dollars on a pipe when I can get a drugstore Dr. Grabow for 9-19 dollars? 
My biggest frustration with pipe smoking so far is the moisture build up 
or "gurgling" sound. Also do not enjoy having  liquid saliva come through 
the stem and into my mouth. I am thinking about getting purchasing a Dr. 
Grabow meerschaum lined bowl for 18.95 at a local drugstore. But I don't 
know if there would be much of a difference between smoking briar and 
smoking meerschaum lined bowls. Please advise. Perhaps a used estate 
meerschuam would be the way to go? Any advise you send me would be 
welcome If you want my mailing address I would be glad to send it to you 
in the next e-mail message. Have a nice day.

Tony

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #208 -- January 14, 1996

Hi Steve,

I've been really enjoying PD for sometime and have decided to see if maybe 
someone could help me.  First, I've been smoking a pipe for about 10 years, 
mostly high grades.  Thanks to PD, I don't feel alone in this pipeless world. 

I have two questions in particular.  If anyone would like to email me a 
response, please feel free.

Some years ago, in traveling around the southwest I came across the most 
wonderful Nording.  It was a flame grain that had a wonderfully carved Lucite 
bit and a beautiful straight grain.....I should have purchased it but for one 
reason or another, I didn't.  Well.....years later I still dream of this pipe 
and I can't seem to find anyone who can help me.  It cost (at the time) about 
$300.00.  I know I can order a freehand or straght grain from Nording, but 
this particular style was wonderful!

The other question is:  Has There been any new publications done by Richard 
Carlton Hacker?  A friend of mine was reading my old copy of The Ultimate 
Pipe Book and asked me if there was anthing new by him.  My friend found his 
writing so enjoyable that he now wants to start smoking a pipe. (more power 
to him!).

One additional comment, someone had mentioned in one of the last issues about 
a new "smoke shop" in Scottdale, Arizona called the Village Smoke Shop.  
Well, I visited Craig Cooper and found his shop to be wonderful.  He is new, 
and has a limited selection, but it is growing and he is willing to order 
anything.  He is funny and well natured and created a wonderful atmospher!  I 
truly enjoyed spending time in his shop.  So THANKS! for the suggestion!  I 
found myself in Washington D.C. this Christmas and was determined to visit 
one of my favorite locations, the GeorgeTown Tab., But they nolonger seem 
interested in serving the Pipe Smokers of the world, so its nice to find a 
new "Smoke shop" in my local area that does enjoy having the pipe smokeing 
population around!

Love the PD Steve, thanks for the hard work!

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest Web Page

Dear Steve, 

I spent a long time looking at your Web page today and was most
impressed.  You really have pulled together some really useful
information and it has illustrated to me just how good a web page can
be .

I notice that you have a commercial section and I wondered if there is
any way that our Quality tobacco catalog might be listed therein. Our
catalog is simply a text file which contains around 150 tobaccos that
we supply mail order worldwide.  ( Current copy attached for your
information ).By the way, you may be interested to learn that we are
about to add a cigar section to our mail order list which will contain
some 200 Continental, Dominican, Honduran and Cuban cigars.

Our postings in the Pipes Digest and OoOps have resulted in hundreds
of enquiries and we are now supplying tobacco on a regular basis to
the USA as a result.  Judging by the reaction of these discerning
fellows I have little doubt that other pipesmokers would enjoy reading
our catalog and would down load it if it were more readily available.

I have considered my own Web page but apart from my own catalog I
could only put up a poor imitation of The Pipes Digest page, and there
is little point in doing that .If there is any way that I could
actively participate in your page I would be most happy to do so. I
could for example act as a source of information re: English tobaccos
( I have been doing this in response to enquiries already received ) .
Perhaps you have some thoughts on this ?

I hope you don't me asking Steve

Yours sincerely

John

[As always, John, I have to give the credit for the Web page to whom
it's due: the Webmaster, Steve Beaty (?????@?????.?????????.???).
Although I haven't asked Steve, I think subpage on English blends,
though, would be a welcome addition; so would a few more scanned
pictures of famous pipe smokers (or even notorious ones: Joseph
Stalin, Lee Van Cleef, etc? :-) Not having ready access to a scanner,
I've been so far unable to help. -S. ]

Subject: Requesting data

 Dear Sir

  I`ve just regiestrated your magazine about pipes are related topics.
I must say that it fascinates me to know that I`m not the only "drole" who
smokes pipe.
Nevertheless, I`m quite new at this so called "pipe business". I only smoke
pipe for about 6 months, so that I`m a rookie.
  Two things derived me to write to you again:
First of all, I couldnt find that "How To..." rubrique (section), that so
interests me for the obvious reasons, where can I find it?
Second, though I really enjoyed reading your mag, I must say that I think it
is too premature for me to be at, because I really know so little.
I`ve noticed your repeatenly requests to inform you if one wants to
unsubscribe, and though I`d really want to continue getting the articles and
advices, I`d hate to be  a burden on you. If you have other readers waiting,
please unsubscribe me.

                                             Thank you very much, and please
                                             forgive me for the trouble

message is sent for a variety of reasons, but there's always room for
a new member, and no waiting list. -S.]

Subject: Of pipes and men - stone pipes, Tyrolean pipes, duties

Dear Steve,

Thank-you for the subscription to the Pipe mail group. I sent you my request 
from the web site last week, and have been spending my time from then to now 
reading the back issues. You are now approaching 2000 members, and to think 
what a big deal it was when you broke 100! Congratulations.

I'd like to introduce myself, and then pose three questions to your erudite 
readers. One concerns an East Indian stone pipe gifted to me, and another 
the Tyrolean or 'alte mode' porcelain pipe willed to me. I'd also like to 
ask about import duties into Canada for tobacco products. For those of you 
not up to reading yet another bio, pipe descriptions, what I smoke, please 
skip the next three paragraphs.

I'm a 32 year old father of three, Ada programmer in Calgary, Alberta. Our 
household also includes a Border Collie mix, two cats, a budgie, and two 
gold-fish. My other interests include home-brewing (I prefer the dark German 
Bocks, my wife the light lagers), bag-piping, Scottish Country dancing 
(imagine square-dancing without a caller), Tae-Kwon Do (National TKD 
Federation, 7th degree/ green stripe), and Scouting (58th Friendship 
Beavers, Thorncliffe/Greenview, aka "Big Brown Bear"). Believe it our not, 
my mother tongue is German. In the past I've been an Air Cadet (176th 
Winnipeg, glider's and single engine pilot's licensee), a student 
(University of Regina, '88), and reserve Signals officer (734 Communication 
Squadron, Regina).

Currently I own four pipes, two of which I smoke regularly. The first is a 
eight bent apple-shaped bulldog with an oval shank and saddle bit. The 
second is the classic straight 'Dad' pipe with a tapered bit. My first ever 
pipe, sadly, hangs on the wall, never to be smoked again. It's a half bent 
three/quarter egg shape, with a really thin military bit. The top has an 
attached spark arrester (lid), and is also lined on the inside with a sheet 
metal of some kind. It was given to me by the man I new as my Grandfather 
(my real paternal Grandfather was killed in or near Stalingrad. All the 
family got back was his wedding ring, his paybook, and an Iron Cross, First 
class with Oak Clusters. No explanation, no other apparent survivors in the 
Regiment to tell what happened.) It was in  the back yard of my 
Grandmother's home in Hamburg, among the apple trees on a beautiful summer's 
after-noon after weeding the tree nursery. I was smoking Drum at the time, 
and he offered to get me started on the pipe. The stem has broken twice now, 
and it's no longer worth repairing. It's been on and off between cigarettes 
and pipes since then, but I think the pipe has finally won after these last 
two months. I even got the point once of throwing out almost all my pipes 
eight years ago, a move that I now regret . I miss my blond sand-blasted 
bulldog. Sniff, sniff.

At the moment I'm smoking mostly Cavendishes (vanilla, black, and cherry), 
and Erinmore flake. I too am still searching for the ultimate smoke, and 
have determined to work my way through every jar in the local tobacconist's 
store.

Now enough about me. Here are my questions:

First question - when my brother came back from India several years ago, he 
brought along a stone pipe. With the exception of the elephants head carved 
on the side, it is a symmetrical column. The over-all effect is one a long, 
skinny tea-cup, with the elephant's trunk forming the handle. There is no 
shank, and the smoke hole is at the bottom of the pipe. The bowl is unusual 
in the there is a 3/16" gap along the bottom of the bowl were the floor 
meets the wall, all the way around. Now, my question is: Is the a museum 
piece, a tourist's trinket, and how would I smoke it if I wanted to? I 
imagine that the pipe would be inserted perpendicular to a hollow bamboo 
piece, closed and one end, and smoked this way. Otherwise I would have to 
tilt my head back at a ninety degree angle to get at the smoke and avoid 
spilling ashes.

Second question - I have an 'alte mode' or Tyrolean pipe handed down to me 
from the afore-mentioned 'grandfather'. Unfortunately, between there and 
here, it has been used as a decoration, dropped, glued back together 
(several times), and is no longer smokable. Its one of those porcelain 
jobbies in four pieces: a large bowl with a metal lid, a U-shaped bottom, a 
long straight bamboo tube, and a mouthpiece. The bowl is decorated with a 
hunting scene. My brother (the same one who was in India) has promised to go 
cruising through the tobacconists of the Black Forest and price a new one 
out for me (he is currently doing a Masters in Architecture at the 
University of Heidleberg) in exchange for some stuff from the Mountain 
Equipment Co-op. The question is, assuming that I get my hands on one of 
these babies - how do I smoke it? Does it need to be packed in a certain 
way? Does it need to be re-lit more often? Or should I just smoke the damn 
thing and let you guys know? I imagine it would be a nice, long, cool smoke 
(if a bit wet), good for a cold winter evening in front of the VCR.

Third and last question - has anyone out there had any luck mail ordering 
tobacco internationally or inter-provincially. I'm wondering (although I 
doubt it) if one can get stuff mailed from outside the country for personal 
use, and avoid paying some or all provincial and/or federal tariffs 
(legally, of course). Or if ordering tobacco from one province (Ontario, 
say) to another (Alberta, say) and avoid some or all of the provincial 
tariffs (legally, for personal use, of course).

Thanks again, Steve for all the effort you've put into this mail group. I 
certainly appreciate it, and I'm sure many others do as well. Next time: a 
report of tobacconists in Calgary, Winnipeg, and Regina.

Cheers,
Bernie May

[Interesting on the stone pipe, Bernie!  I'd say go ahead and try it
out if you'd like. Will defer the other questions to our readers with
experience, but we'd be glad to hear of the results! -S.]

Subject: RE: Pipes Digest #209 -- January 29, 1996

Dear Steve, 

I've been smoking cigars now for a couple of years, and I must admit that 
when I can afford them, they are my true passion.  However, I am a college
student and cigars are expensive so last year I tried a pipe.  Very different,
but very pleasureable, too.  I do not know anything about pipes (briar?, 
meerschaum?, cake?, etc.) but I would like to learn.  Ive found that asking 
local tabaconists usually only results in a sales pitch.  Where is best to 
pick up on these things?  Is there some comprehensive book for beginers?
I don't even know the finer points of actually smoking my pipe.  Where can I
learn?
Any help you could give would be greatly appreciated.

			Thanks!

Sami's is the better.) -S. ]

Subject: A PD submission

Hi Steve,

Once again I must say that your dedication to the pipes digest is greatly
appreciated by all that you serve.  Thanks...

James "BriarPipes" Lawson said:

&gt;I continue to be struck by the pipe that Lee Van Cleef smoked in the second
&gt;movie "For a Few Dollars More."  It is  large, 3/4 bent, tan in color, and
&gt;appears to be a sandblast.  It seems to have an amber (or maybe bone) stem.
&gt; What a pipe!

I was very intrigued with it myself and had some of the same reactions,
such as: 

&gt;I wish I had taped the movies (they were shown in the letter-box format).  To
&gt;me, just the image of Van Cleef slowly and deliberately lighting that pipe,
&gt;makes the movie memorable.  He looks legit' smoking a pipe. 

I also thought that Van Cleef was either A) a real life pipesmoker or B) did
some very good rehearsing because he looked very natural.

What I'm hoping is that there is a PD reader who has a way of getting a
video frame into a .GIF or .JPG file -- Also, I've often thought of putting
a page up off my homepage (which is under very slow construction right now
at www.cris.com/~jcjewell) that is dedicated to pictures and .AVI or .MOV
files of famous people or movie clips of pipe smoking.  I need to start
keeping track of who I see and where I see them, though.  Another movie that
I saw not long ago, I don't remember the name of it, but it had Bryan
Denehey (sp?) in it as Leslie Groves, the military officier in charge of the
Manhattan project.  Many of the nuclear scientists smoked pipes.  I suppose
it was much more common then (that was before my time :)

If there would be an interest in seeing such a collection of pipe pictures
and video clips, and other PD readers had some things to contribute, I'd do
the HTML work and put it up.  Write me:

????????@????.???

--Jeff "Charlie" Jewell

[ I believe that the movie about the A-bomb was titled "Fat Man and Little
Boy." Don't remember that Groves smoked a pipe, but Oppenheimer definitely
did. Excellent picture, BTW. -S. ]

Subject: Actors and Pipe Smoking

In the last digest I heard mention briefly of the notion that many times 
actors are playing a character who smokes a pipe, but he does not have 
the knowledge of how to realistically smoke a pipe.  I too have noticed 
this quite often.  Lee Van Cleef (mentioned last time) was either an 
excellent actor or he really knew and enjoyed smoking a pipe for his 
portrayal was realistic.  Watson seemed a more sincere pipe smoker than 
Sherlock himself in the black and white films from the 40's... even in 
television it is easy to spot.... If any of you watched Simon &amp; Simon in 
the 80's, Gerald McRaney's character was far a far more realistic in 
using a pipe as a disguise (realistically) than was the actor who played 
his brother on the show.  They would regularly don pipes or cigars as a 
part of an undercover disguise.  It was easy to see Gerald McRaney knew 
his way around a briar or cigar, whereas the other one did not.
  
I guess I am just mentioning I also notice the true pipe smokers in the 
movies and tv.... and I look at them favorably.  The poor imposters... 
those that go through the motions in a contrived manner... actually 
detract from a flim or show and distract me.  I wonder if anyone else 
notices this same situation?

Subject: Irish tobacco by Mullingars

(Steve, This is meant to be a post to the Digest -- have I sent it to
the right address?)

In PD 209, someone was asking about tobacco blends from Ireland.  Many
years ago I bought a few tins of tobacco from Ireland, by a company
called Mullingars.  I don't remember the name of the blend, but it
wasn't "Irish Mead" (which is (was?) also made by Mulingars).   I really
enjoyed the tins, but have never been able to find it again.  Does
anyone know anything about Mulingars -- if they are still in business,
and how they might be reached?

Thanks for any info ...

Subject:       Submission for PD:  Try the Drugstore Brands!!!

If you are like me, you don't have memories of adults smoking 
Dunhills with fine English blends of Latikia, Virginias, and  
Orientals, spiced with Perique.  No,  I  recall all those guys 
in the barber shop with their Dr. Grabows , Medicos, and if they were 
really fancy, Kaywoodies,,, puffing away on Prince Albert, Velvet, Half 
and Half, Carter Hall, and Sir Walter Raleigh.  There were so many 
brands of pipe tobacco, most still being sold.  I still see Granger, 
Our Advertiser, Field and Stream, Revelation, Kentucky Club, and 
Middleton's Cherry Blend for sale in the supermarkets, along with 
other old "standards".   You can still find the boards of cheap 
laquered pipes, and here in Missouri the Missouri Meerschaum factory 
still churns out several million corn cobs each year.  Can all the 
people that use those cheap pipes and smoke that cheap tobacco know 
something we don't?

I know the "drugstore brands" lack sophistication and character.  I 
realize that the accomplished pipester would never smoke them in the 
company of folks who "know" about pipes.  But, just like a blond 
cheerleader and a Z-28 are a LOT of fun, although not at all classy, 
a corn cob and a bowl of Half and Half is a great smoke!!!

So, when no one is looking, I sneak some cheap tobacco in the cart at 
the supermarket.  I even have a few Medicos with the FILTERS hidden 
away from the pipes I show to my friends.  And sometimes, when no one 
is looking, I kick back with a cheap pipe and smoke the brands I used 
to see when I was a little boy in the barbershop.

It's a lot of fun, except Prince Albert doesn't come in a pocket tin 
anymore.  Imagine that, no more "Prince Albert in a can" jokes.  
Another piece of Americana gone.  But Velvet still comes in the can.

So go ahead, slum a little.  Nobody at the pipe shop needs to know.  

Van Adams

[ Indeed, Van!  Craig Tarler also related a story to me about a show he
attended, at which a group of "macho English smokers" bought up his stock
of Apricots and Cream.  And Prince Albert still does come in a can; I think
the 16-ounce size. Hasn't anyone let him out yet? :-) -S.]

Subject: Kabik Pipes

Steve, you'll probably get hundreds of replies to the letter in # 209 about
Kabik pipes, but I'll add what I know.  I can't imagine having one and not
being able to sell or give it away--perhaps that was a joke.  Anyway,
Michael Kabik is a noted American pipemaker of long standing.  He started
his Sven-Lar line in the mid-70s, which are the ones marked "Skulptur by
Kabik."  All these that I have seen are beautiful pipes.  They often (or
usually--I'm not sure) came with their own pipe rest carved from a block of
briar.  Often, in fact, there is a two-pipe set resting in a carved briar
block and facing different
directions.

If you've got one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you've got more than
one, you're a pipe collector.

Subject: (1) Information re.: KABIK ; (2) DRUG STORE PIPES

1. Michael V. Kabik a pipe maker for some 17 years when listed in DIRECTORY
OF AMERICAN PIPEMAKERS in 1987. Among the pipe brands for which he crafted
are: CHP-X PIPES, KANE, GRAN-HILL, TOBAK LTD., SVEN-LAR, DANE CRAFT, WENHALL
PRESIDENTIALS, SCULPTUR, and his own name.

2. DRUG STORE PIPES
    A subscriber wants to know if there's a difference between his Dr. Grabow
drug store pipes and more expensive ones. He then goes on to answer his own
question, perhaps unknowingly, when he complains about the moisture build-up
and "gurgling" sound when he smokes his Dr Grabows. The difference of course
is that the cheap drug store pipes are made from the interior of the briar
burl which is dense and relativeatly grain free.Consequently it doesn't
absorb moisture like the outer surface of the burl (plateau) which is
lightweight, porous and beautifully grained. It's the latter that's used for
more expensive pipes and as any seasoned pipe smoker will attest, well worth
the extra price.

Subject: Pipe Question

  Hi Steve... two questions for you:

  1. Just saw "Hot Shots: Part Deux" on TV last night. In once scene, Lloyd
Bridges is smoking a pipe. He also smoked a pipe in "Joe Versus The
Volcano". Is Lloyd a true pipesmoker or was he acting??

  2.  Does Walter Cronkite still smoke a pipe and if so, what blend does he
smoke? (I threw a message in the a.s.p but never got a reply)

Thanks in advance, talk to you soon...   John

Subject: PD Submission

Dear Steve, et al;

I'd like to put my two cents worth on a couple of questions.  In response to
Morris Acevedo's question about calabashes (calabashi?, calabi?), they are
$57 for a small and $65 for a large in my area.  To Chris Bolstad's question
about Alphas, I own two of the Israeli Alphas.  They are passably good pipes
but, IMHO, I'd rather buy a GBD for less money.  My understanding is that
they are now being made by Sparta of Dr Grabow fame.  The Israeli Alpha's
I've seen are usually fanciful and I think that is their appeal.  I paid $30
each for the ones I have. For those asking about Condor, I recently
purchased a box of six pouches from JR (@15 dollars).  I bought it at their
store, but they may also carry it mail order.  It is, btw, very good tobacco.

Smokingly yours,

Phil Cunningham

Greetings!

#include "ManyThanksForDigest.H"

Being that at least two folks have recomended the Salt packing method for 
cleaning overly sour pipes, I wanted to add a caution.

&gt;From Experience: Do NOT use the Salt treatment method on Meerschaum Calabash 
inserts. They WILL Crack beyond repair!

Still looking for a Meerschaum insert. (Couple - three folks have already
given me leads (Thanks Guys!), but I can always use more.)

From: ???????@???.????.??? (Frederick A. Larson)
Subject: SG report

In the last PD, a librarian asked about the Surgeon General's report which
notes that pipesmokers live longer than nonsmokers. The report is:

Public Health Service. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.
Smoking and health: report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General
of the Public Health Service. Washington, DC: US Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare, Public Health Service, 1964; DHHS publication
no.(PHS)64-1103.

It's long out of print, but should be in a good library if not stolen
(common), lost or defaced by anti-tobacco "researchers." The chapter
referenced is Chapter 8, which deals with mortality rates. The quotes often
seen online from this report are rarely accurate verbatim quotes. However,
the general sense of the "quotes" is correct. This report (and later ones
from the SG which more thoroughly address pipe and cigar smoking) should
give any pipe smoker considerable comfort. Having read all the reports, it
is clear to me that pipe smoking has risks, but significant health risks
are not among them.

Someone plainly needs to put these reports on the net. They are public
documents produced by the feds with tax dollars. I have decent scans of
relevant portions of 64-1103. Might also have portions of the 1979 report
on pipes and cigars. If someone is willing to put these up on the Web, I'll
contribute the scans. They really belong on the Pipes Digest page.

Contact me if interested.

Subject: Info Request

Dear Steve and PD readers,
       
        Thank you for what you have done with the Digest. I have only
recieved three issues, but each was printed and read over many times by my
friends.  I am 23 years old and have been smoking a pipe for about 5 years
now (I come from a long line of pipe smokers).  I collect mostly Savinelli's
and smoke cavindish blends (but I like to try different tobaccos
occasionally). I have many friends that enjoy pipes now, most of which I
converted from cigars or cigarettes when we were in High School (I bought my
best friend a meerschaum for Christmas, and Christmas was good!).

        The reason that I am writing is that a new cigar shop has opened
here in town, they specialize in rare and hard to find cigars.  I've been in
several times because they keep threatening to unpack a bunch of Dunhills.
The manager, Bill, is interested in ordering some pipe tobaccos from Europe
and employed my help in acquiring a few resources.  1) We are looking for
addresses for shops in European locals from which we may obtain high quality
tobacco. 2) We are also looking for someone in Fresno, the Bay Area, and/or
California to do repair work/refurbishing/manufacturing of pipes. Top dollar
will be paid for quality craftsmanship. Please send any reply to my address
listed below.

Thank you in advance for any and all assistance.

Subject: pipe digest 

Great site!  I haven't smoked my pipes in quite a few years - others in my
household don't like it - so I think I'll start up again this spring out in
the garage while I'm working on my cars.  And I'll write my congressman.
Any hints on what I should be telling him?  Thanks for any help. -- Mike

Subject: Digest submission - Smoking Large Pipes

SMOKING LARGE PIPES 

I am sending in this article for those who are interested in smoking very large
pipes.  By magnum, I mean an internal bowl size of 1-1/4" or larger, and a bowl
height of 3" or higher. 

Smoking Magnum size pipes is a little bit different than smoking conventional
size pipes.  The bowl is a lot bigger, the air passage through the shank and
bit should be bigger, and they are heavier.  Each of these attributes make a
difference in the way that the pipes are smoked and enjoyed. 

When packing the bowl full of tobacco, start filling the pipe loosely until it
is half full, then lightly pack with the fingers until it is lightly springy.
Continue to fill the bowl to the top by pushing down more firmly so that the
surface of the tobacco is slightly firm.  Top off the bowl if necessary,
because the large size of the bowl allows for a lot of compaction, and the
finished cake of tobacco in the bowl may have sunken half an inch or more in
the final packing procedure. 

Blow from the bowl end of the pipe to clear out small bits of tobacco that may
have found their way into the shank area of the airway.  Blow from the bit end,
then suck air in through the bit to see if the draw is adequate.  If you have
packed too tightly, the draw will be difficult.  Empty the pipe with a pipe
tool into your pouch and try again.  If the bowl is packed too tightly, the
draw will be too slow and if packed too lightly, it will smoke too hot and the
tobacco will sink down dramatically when you tamp during smoking.  One of the
most attractive features of a super oversized pipe is the freedom of air
(smoke) movement through the pipe.  This is referred to as the "draw". 

After the pipe is packed, you are ready to light up.  I suggest a butane pipe
lighter such as a Colibri clip lighter.  Matches are too slow and cumbersome
for wide bowls, just be careful not to scorch the top edge of the bowl with
your lighter.  Zippos are fine, but they do leave a lighter fluid taste behind.
They also have a slower moving flame which requires a great deal of suction to 
pull the flame down into the tobacco.  If you have no problem with either one 
of these characteristics, then a Zippo is fine.  In windy locations, a Zippo is 
the only lighter that will stay lit - the Zippo pipe lighter is good under 
these situations.  

Begin by holding the pipe so that the bowl is vertical, not tipped forward or
to the side.  Holding the lighter in one hand and the pipe in the other, hold
the flame over the surface of the tobacco and begin puffing in with the cheeks,
holding the bit right at your lips.  The flame should be pulled straight down
into the tobacco.  Move the flame over the surface of the tobacco and scorch
the entire surface.  The tobacco will puff up and curl. Tamp the surface of the
tobacco lightly and make it level again.  This procedure usually needs to
repeated two more times before the entire surface of the tobacco is a bright
orange glow.  At this time, you can slow down and start smoking normally.  Big
bowls will take more tamping to get them going properly, because the tobacco
tends to curl up more when the bowl is a large diameter. Big pipes also take
more puffing than a smaller one to get completely lit. 

If you have never inhaled on your pipe before, try holding the pipe in your
teeth and breathe normally through your mouth so that you get a gentle stream
of smoke with each breath.  For a beginner, you should not try to inhale any
deeper right away.  Wait until this level of smoking feels comfortable before
you go any farther.  Tamp the tobacco when the smoke seems to get weaker.
Tamping is required when the top layer of tobacco ash is light and gray
colored.  Experience will indicate when tamping is required by the way the pipe
draws and the way the smoke tastes.  Do not press too hard, or the tobacco cake
will be overly compressed and will not pass the smoke through properly. 

Large pipes do not get as wet on the bottom as smaller ones do.  The wide bowl
size and greater surface of burning tobacco seems to vaporize a lot of the
water in contrast to a smaller pipe.  Use a long pipe cleaner through the end
of the bit all the way to the bottom of the bowl.  Use a twisting motion if
necessary to work it all the way down.  10-12 inch pipe cleaners are not
uncommon and are indispensable for big pipe smoking. 

After you have become accustomed to inhaling the light stream of smoke,  try
sealing up the lips a little more so that you get more smoke and less air.
Experiment with this for a while until you are able to take in a short blast of
smoke, then open the lips and top off the breath with air.  Exhaling through
the nose will increase the contact area for the smoke, and thus increase the
amount of smoke products that you absorb.  This will also create a different
feel than exhaling through the lips. 

As you become more familiar with this smoking technique, you can try increasing
the smoke to air ratio until you achieve a very pleasant warm feeling in the
chest as you smoke.  You can either inhale continuously with a constant
smoke/air mixture while you have the pipe in your teeth, or you can inhale a
burst of smoke followed by a topping off of air.  You may want to try holding
the pipe in your hand and pulling in the smoke using your cheeks as you inhale
as if you were lighting the pipe.  You can use this technique in lighting your
pipe as well. 

Some of the largest magnums almost require that you inhale while lighting the
pipe so that enough air gets through the pipe, otherwise, the tobacco may not
get completely lit evenly.  After you are comfortable with this, you can light
the pipe while it is in your teeth simply by inhaling forcefully while you
circle the lighter above the tobacco. 

Smoke the pipe down to 1/4 of the bowl, but no further.  The bottom of the 
tobacco has served as a filter and has accumulated a lot of excess bitterness.  
When you reach that point, is is best to switch to another pipe and let this 
one rest for a while.  If you do not have time to finish the whole bowl, rubber 
pipe covers are available that fit very well into 1.25" diameter bowls.  Just 
tamp and push one into the top of the bowl.  This will prevent smouldering and
spilling of ash.  For wider pipe bowls, have your pipemaker make a tapered plug
of briar resembling a bottle stopper. 

Magnum size pipes are heavier than normal pipes, so you will need to become
accustomed to the extra weight in your teeth.  The very largest of pipes are
not very practical for carrying around and are probably best enjoyed while
seated.  Of course with enough determination, you can do just about anything,
so if you really want to smoke your biggest pipes away from home, get busy and
practice! 

When you have become accustomed to smoking your larger size pipes, you will 
begin to appreciate the richness of the smoke and the greater satisfaction of 
the higher smoke volume that they produce.  Each pipefull lasts longer too,
so you can enjoy smoking longer without having to reload or switch to another 
pipe.

Steve--

You continue to do a bang-up job on PD.  I enjoy every issue.  I am moving to
Charlottesville, Va., at the end of March and am wondering if there are good
tobacco shops, cigar/pipe-friendly establishments, and smoking clubs in the
area.  I'd appreciate any tips from my fellow PD'ers.  Thanks.

Subject: re: German pipe brands

Dear Spencer,

   There are indeed decent brands that come from Germany, but not many, 
that is only two, as far as I know. One of them is *Vauen*. The 
history of the name is quite interesting. At the end of the 19th 
century two remarkable manufacturers of briar pipes located in 
Nuernberg (Ziener &amp; Ellenberger and Gebhard Otto) were left. They 
joined in 1901 and formed the "Vereinigte Pfeifenfabriken Nuernberg" 
(united pipe factories Nuernberg). The abreviated name "V.N." was 
vocalized to "Vauen" (German spelling of the letters) in 1911.
   The second one is *Oldenkott*. They were, along with Vauen, the 
most important manufacturers of briar pipes in the 1950ies, when 
increasing whealth allowed a market for luxury goods again, producing 
mostly pipes in the so called English style. The factory is situated 
in Rees.
   One problem about export and availability are the differences in smoking 
habits. After the publication of the Terry-report in 1964, the 9mm 
coal-filled filters for pipes became so popular in Germany that
 by now almost 90 per cent of the pipes sold in Germany are 9mm's. 
As a result, Vauen (who first patented the coal filter system in 1934) 
produce exclusively 9mm filter pipes by now. They really have 
significant advantages: 50 per cent less tar, 65 per cent less 
nicotine and a dry smoke (the paper tube absorbes the moisture).
   I've been told, that smokers in other European countries and the 
U.S. prefer filterless pipes or the 4-6mm paper rolls. That might be 
a reason, why the *excellent* (as well beautiful as smooth smoking) pipes 
made by Vauen are so little known abroad. If you're interested in 
contacting them, I'll check out the adress. 

With thanks to our benefactor Steve for his magnificent work,

Dirk Bahlo.

Subject: Pressed Tobacco

Good Evening Steve ...

        I'm looking for some information on the process of pressing tobacco 
and types of casing.
        Last fall, I had a real good crop of tobacco (about 100lbs) and up 
till now I've been spritzing whatever I was going to use with a liquour to 
bring up the moisture content and then running it through a blender. Sounds 
crude but it works well. However, I read an article that stated some of the 
tobacco companies case their product with whiskey, liquours, and/or other 
chemicals and then press the tobacco for about a month. During this 
time,heat is applied and a type of fermentation takes place.
        Well, to make a long story short, I've built a press and heat source 
etc,etc. and now I'm stuck. Has anybody in the group had anything to do with 
this type of process? I need to know how much pressure and how much heat. 
The article I read gave a time frame of about a month but they weren't to 
specific. What types of casing are being used?
        I tried to track down the author of the article but to no avail. I 
don't mind experimenting a little bit but I'd hate like hell to lose a large 
quantity of tobacco.
        If anyone has information on this they can e-mail me direct so it 
doesn't take up valuable space in the Digest. BTW ... Hats off to you for 
the terrific job you do on the digest. It's the best in my book and I really 
appreciate receiving it.

        Thank you ... Gerry Hilton

[ Ehwa, p. 168, gives a brief description of the casing and pressing
processes. But he's not specific either, except to say that a hydraulic
press is used and that the pressed portion is about 16 inches
square. Apparently, the heat is optional. -S. ]

Subject: Quality Tobacco Uk - New products

Dear Steve,

Please find attached a new Quality Tobacco UK catalog that contains 88
( yes - eighty eight ) new  tobacco products. This brings the total Mail Order
list up to 228 products in all.

Thanks for refering me to Steve Beaty, he has very Kindly put our catalog
up on the Pipes Digest Web page and it can now be obtained by downloading
it from there as well as directly from me by E_Mail.

I have received a lot of enquiries about Old English tobaccos. One that has 
cropped up a lot is Ogdens Readbreast Flake, so I thought everyone might
like to know what Ogdens had to say about this.

Readbreast Flake was last produced in the early 60's. The nearest comparable
tobaccos are  Ogdens BK Flake ( LOOSE ) which used to be known as Bulwark
and Ogdens Walnut  Flake in 50gm packs. Of these Walnut Flake is the first
choice.

Personally I prefer Bulwark which is Black and strong, burns very slowly
and has a wonderful "Old Fashioned" aroma. Both are available from our
catalog.

Regards to all

John

Subject: Discrimination In Smoke

Steve,

I recently posted some questions on Nording pipes and wanted to thank the 
readers of PD for thier help!  I usually wouldn't post again so soon, however 
something very disturbing happened this weekend.

I am a buisness owner here in Phoenix, Az.  As usual, I spent the day 
Saterday at work.  My birthday is coming soon, and I had decided to purchase 
a present for myself.  Needless to say, it was a pipe, some tobacco, and 
other assesories that where long overdue.  I asked my wife if she could stop 
at one of my preferred "smoke shops" and purchase the goodies.  She was 
shopping with one of her friends and said that she would be happy to stop 
for me.  (She's the best!)  When she arrive at "Ye Olde Pipe &amp; Tobacco 
Shoppe" on 2115 E.Camelback, Phoenix, Az.  It was moderatly crowded. (as is 
the norm on saterday). She went to the counter, to recieve some help in 
purchasing my new goodies.  This is where it gets disturbing.

Of the several (so called "Gentlemen") working there, they would not serve 
her.  She asked for help several times, however, they seemed more interested 
in helping only the "men" that came into the shop.  She remained in the store 
for 10 minutes and could not recieve any help from the store personel.  This 
is after many "men" had entered the store after her and where immediatly 
served.  My wife, (for good reason) left in anger at the treatment she had 
recieved.

My wife is not easily angered.  When I returned home, she told me the story 
of how she had been discriminated against.  I normally would have taken her 
word for it, but I couldn't believe my ears, so I called her friend to find 
out what had happened.  To my horror and discust, my wife's story was true, 
except that she had waited 15 minutes before leaving the retched place.

This type of treatment is outrages and unforgivable!  Not only has "Ye Olde 
Pipe &amp; Tobacco" lost a $400 sale, I WILL NEVER SHOP THERE AGAIN!  I will make 
sure that I tell all the people I meet of the terrible treatment that 
"females" recieve there.  As a member of several buisness organizations in 
Arizona, I will tell this story to every single one of them!

It is unfortunate that women should recieve such treatment as a lower-class 
citizen when entering a place.  It is unforgivable that it also happened to 
be a "Smoke shop".  I have had wonderful experiences at the other shops I've 
been to in this country, and I am shocked that it ever happened at all.  My 
wife has gone to a tobaccanist several times for me when I couldn't make it. 
 This is the first time she has ever been treated this way.

A note to "Smoke Shops".  Customer service is your buisness (as is mine).  No 
matter if the customer is a "male", "female", "black", "white", "red", 
"purple", or from another planet. 

I've enjoyed the friends that I have meet at "Smoke Shops" and will continue 
to meet new friends.  Thanks to all the customer oriented shops, I will be 
HAPPY to do buisness with you!

From: ????????@???.??? (Ed Berggren)
Subject: [PIPES]

Hello, Steve,

  Because I was planning a short 2-day trip to Phoenix this last weekend, I
went back to Digest #207 and re-read Joyce Perry's reviews of local pipe
shops.  As a result, on Saturday I stopped in at Ye Olde Pipe and Tobacco
Shop.  Although it's a relatively small shop, they had a very nice
selection of both pipes and cigars from low to high end.  The salespeople
were all very friendly and knowledgeable and were very pleased when I told
them that I read about them in the Digest.

  While there I picked up a very nice freehand carved by a local pipemaker
named DeJarnett.  It's a solid, rugged-looking piece, but is surprisingly
lightweight for its size.  It was also very reasonably priced.  I'm not the
judge of wood that some of our fellow readers are, but I've seen pipes of
comparable size and quality that sold for 2 to 3 times as much.  Apparently
Mr. DeJarnett has been honing his skills for awhile and has only recently
begun to offer his pipes for sale via this retail outlet.  I had an
opportunity to smoke it last night and it was a delight--and it will only
get better with age and seasoning.

  I also bought a couple ounces of the shop's "House Blend."  It's a
lightly aromatic blend with some Latakia thrown in.  I found it to be quite
pleasant.  It's light in body, but is full of flavor with a hint of
sweetness that isn't overpowering like some aromatics can be.  It stayed
lit with little fuss and burned cool all the way down.

  Anyway, residents of and travelers to Phoenix looking for a good,
friendly tobacco shop could do a lot worse than trying out Ye Olde Pipe and
Tobacco.  I understand they will soon be moving into larger quarters within
the same shopping complex and so I look forward to visiting them again to
see what they do with the extra space.  I don't know if Joyce sent you the
particulars to add this shop to the Resource Guide.  If not here they are
(sorry, I don't know the zip code):

  Ye Olde Pipe &amp; Tobacco Shop
  Town &amp; Country Shopping Center
  2115 E. Camelback Rd.
  Phoenix, AZ
  (602) 955-7740

--Ed

[ I haven't received anything about them from Joyce.  Given Jason's wife's
experience, it isn't hard to see a possible reason why not. I will list
them in the Guide, but with the following notation: "Caveat: reported
discrimination against women customers."

If anyone in the shop wishes to address this matter, please take it up
directly with Jason and his wife.  I'll drop the caveat at such time as
they ask me to. -S. ]

Subject: Pipe Groups and Home Pages

Hi Steve,

Just wanted to let you know that I enjoy all the info from the digest, give
yourself a pat on the back for all the good work.

Also, I have discovered two new smoking support home pages you might want to
tie links to or at least let everyone else known about. The first is call
Friends of Tobacco (FOT), they are pretty politically oriented towards
notifying members about new laws which affect smokers and ways to state your
concerns to your Senator and such. Their URL is: www.fuji.com/fot. 

If nothing else, their worth taking a look at.

The second one is the South American Pipe Club. Similar to PD but based in
Brasilia, Brazil. A good link to unite us world wide. I have joined SAPC and
became a charter member by being one of the only two North Americans to join. 

Considering the changing time and antagonistic attitude smokers must deal
with today, supporting another group of Pipies couldn't hurt.

Finally, would it be possible to add a section to the directory for pipe
making supplies??. You could start by adding the following two:

American Smoking Pipe Co.
HC 88 Box 223
30 Tall Oaks Terrace
Pocono Lake, Pa. 18347

Stemco-Pimo, Inc
Butternut Lane
P.O. Box 2043
Manchester, Vt 05255

I've have looked far and wide to try and find some kind of supplier to
attempt my hand at making a pipe or two, I spent more time just trying to
find a supplier then it will probable take me to make the pipe.........

Thanks and Good Smoking

John

Subject: tobaccos

HELP ME!!

I am a student at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana.  Needless
to say there is not an abundance of good tobacco stores around.  I saw a
posting for Gawith Hoggarth British Tobaccos a few Digests ago and I wrote
to them and recieved a catalog.  On the menu (of very fine tobaccos!!) I
saw a tobacco called Latakia.  I think I have some of that blended in with
some other tobacco I bought at my home in Dallas, Texas.  The tobacconist
in Dallas told me it was a very strong blend that was treated in Syria (under
camel dung??)  It sounds crazy, but that's what I remember him telling me.
Steve, please tell me (if you can) a little more about this tobacco because
I like it a lot.  Thanks!

[ Latakia is "fumigated" over hardwood fires and then fermented; the camel
dung story is the stuff of which Urban Legends are made. -S. ]

Subject: Pipe smoking in other countries

I was wondering if anyone has information about the areas of the world 
that have the highest percentage of pipe smokers?  
  
I was under the impression that at least until the 80's that pipe smoking 
was a very widespread habit in men of both Poland and Ireland.  Are there 
places in the world where pipe smoking is more common in men than is 
cigarette smoking or cigar smoking?  
  
Also.... does anyone know if Lech Walesa (electrician, prior president of 
Poland) is still a pipe smoker?  I do not recall seeing any photos of him 
while president that showed tobacco use.  I was curious if he is still a 
kindred spirit or if he has quit the habit?

Subject: Tobacconists

I wish to add two addresses to the resource guide.

1.  Tobacco Hut,  5714 Hickman Rd., Des Moines, IA 50310
     This shop primarily sells cigars.  The selection is good, the prices are
even better.  

2.  Cigarros Antillas Mfg., Calle General Harding, Esq. Calle Concepcion de
Garcia
Local #3, Old San Juan,  00902
     This shop is located close to where the cruise ships dock.  He only
sells one brand of cigars.  But, he makes these cigars himself (and you can
watch).  So, it is interesting.
If in San Juan, pay him a visit.

Thanks,

Rod

Steve,

        as you, and many others are aware, the Pipes Web page was blacked
out for two days in response to President Clinton's signing of the
telecommunications decency act.  things are back to normal now.  for those
who think this is a site that is unaffected, i did a keyword search on the
work "breast".  it turned up six matches in the articles over the years.  i
used this word as it was banned on a rather popular online service, until it
was pointed out that it would cause the discussion of breast cancer to cease.

Subject: Holt's

Steve,

Just a short note to let you know that Holt' Tobacconists have moved.  I had
the opportunity to be in Philadelphia for the first time, my daughter had a
graduate interview at Hahnemann, and went searching for Holt's.  I was
greatly disappointed when I saw the vacant shop.  So heading back to my hotel
I was lucky enough to walk right by their new establishment.  What a treat!!!
 Not being from a big city I was impressed with size and selection of their
inventory.  I bought myself a half dozen Ashton's with the help of the sales
clerk. (I'm not used to a wide selection) Their smoking lounge was not open
at the time but if I'm ever back I'll make sure to stop by again.

Address:     Holt's Tobacconists
                  1522 Walnut Street
                   Philadelphia, PA 19102

Subject: For Pipes Digest

Steve,

Thanks for processing my subscription to Pipes Digest.  I have two questions
that maybe the readers can answer:

During the mid-1970s I frequented a pipe shop in Lexington, KY.  It was
owned by Bob Vie (a retired Marine, I believe).  I still remember his name
because it is on a line of Savinelli seconds that he sold as "Bob Vie
Matts."  I still have the ones I bought then and they are still some of my
favorites.  Does anyone know if Bob is still in business?

I humidify my cigars with a Credo round humidor.  Credo sells a
"rejuvenator" liquid which is supposed to keep this device working well.
The trouble is this stuff is wildly expensive.  "Experts" tell me that the
rejuvenator fluid is just glycerine and is available at any drugstore.  I
read in the latest issue of Pipes Digest that the liquid is propylene
glycol.  Does anyone know what this stuff really is, and is there an
available substitute that won't cause my humidifier and cigars to melt-down?

Thanks for a great resource for those of us who still enjoy a load of good
tobacco in a nice pipe.

Dennis Dolle

Subject: Home Cigar-Making Kit

I smoke both pipes and cigars.  I recently purchased some equipment from a
local cigar maker to roll my own cigars, and have become quite good at it.
I have found it to be both enjoyable and economical. I got to thinking,
"people can purchase home beer-brewing kits, so why doesn't someone come up
with a quality home cigar-making kit, as well?"  Has this been attempted by
anyone before?  If not, how many of your readers might be interested in
purchasing a complete kit with a how-to video for, say, about fifty
dollars, if they were available?  I guess I'm test-marketing my idea here.
In any event, I would really like to know.  Perhaps if there is enough
interest, I will make arrangements to have the kits produced.  Also, if
anyone is interested in this, they can e-mail me.  Thanks.

Steve R. Russo

From: "James D. Beard" &lt;???@????????.?????.???&gt;
Subject: Item for Pipes Digest -- Bio

Steve and all,

I have been reading current (and past) Pipe Digests for some time
now, and as an official member (PD #206) wish to contribute a
10,000-words-or-less version of who/what/why I am with respect
to pipes and pipe smoking.  To wit:

My initial attempt to take up pipe smoking at about 14 years of age in
rural Oklahoma led me to a single $20 pipe (quite expensive, for that
area in those days, circa 1960) and the drug store tobacco rack:
Rum &amp; Maple, Half &amp; Half, Amphora, Prince Albert (actually, one of 
the better ones), etc.  That, combined with ignorance, led to failure.

Upon entering college (Oklahoma State University, newly renamed from
Oklahoma State Agricultural and Mechanical College), I took another
try at the pipe, testing mostly imported tobaccos, and I also tested
cigars and cigarettes.  The pipe experiments went nowhere fast, with
Balkan Sobranie providing the only moments that remain in memory. 
The "prestige" cigar on campus, Dutch Masters, I found uninteresting,
and Mississippi River Crooks were pleasant but too expensive for me
to consume at the rate I wanted to smoke them.  I wound up with a
Camel cigarette habit, nonfilter of course.

To digress, the Camel habit had a minor side effect a few years 
later,  that has served as a reminder to me that tastes do differ. 
Briefly, I wandered around III Corps with the 11th Armored Cavalry
(then-Col  George S. Patton, Jr., Commanding) for the last 7 months
of my 2  years 2 months 4 days in Vietnam.  One of the benefits to
being in the boonies was that every few weeks a goodie box would
arrive, containing toiletries, other sundries, and carton upon carton
of cigarettes.  All free.  Donated by the manufacturers.  A horde 
would descend upon the box, as guys scrambled to get their favorite 
brand of weeds.  I would simply wait a half hour, until the box was 
sitting there with no one in attendance, and then go over and pick 
up the 2 cartons of Camels that would be all that remained in the 
bottom of the box.  Never once were the Camels gone.  Never once was 
there anything in the box other than the Camels.  But, to return from 
this divergence and back to a slightly earlier time:

After arrival at the Defense Language Institute, Presidio of 
Monterey, CA, a few months after joining the Army, I made another 
try.  A $30 pipe and assorted tinned tobaccos from the tobacconist 
on Alvarado St introduced me to MacBaren's Golden Blend, but did not 
lead to a lasting habit.

After my hitch in the Army was up, I went to San Francisco to study
Japanese, and at an estate auction I went to with my wife-to-be I
acquired a set of "estate" pipes, in the literal sense.  Not knowing
how to sanitize them properly, I simply submerged all mouthpieces
in boiling water for 15 minutes, matched the ones that survived to
their respective bowls, cleaned the bowls and shanks with drugstore
ethanol, and went in search of a good tobacco in San Francisco-area
tobacco shops.  I tried the Dunhill mixtures, virtually everything
else that came in a can from the UK or Europe, and a miscellany of
whatever was available and recommended by tobacconists I ran across. 
MacBaren's proved to be the best of a bad lot, and I smoked Golden
Extra and a few other MacBaren's tinned goods for a time before
abandoning the attempt yet again.  By this time, I had learned a good
bit about pipe smoking, and about tobaccos, but things simply did not
jell.

In truth, I had become comfortable with my Camel habit, and when the
added complexity of pipe smoking yielded less pleasure than the
Camel, I could see no point in forcing the issue.  I did later give up
the Camels once, for 2 years.  I gained 5 pounds, my teeth resumed
rotting (I have so much metal in my mouth that you could mine it, all
from pre-smoking days plus the 2 years I was off the weed), my
metabolism was unpleasantly erratic, and I really missed the 
pleasures of the Injun weed.  I resumed my habit, pledging to
never again give up smoking.  This, later, resulted in a minor
complication, when my daughter developed asthma and the doctor's
orders were clear:  No smoking in the house or around Diana anywhere,
as it could trigger (in retrospect, had  triggered) an asthma attack.
Them things ain't fun, and they can be fatal.  Thenceforth, my smoking
was done outside, in my car when not accompanied by daughter, and at
other locations where smoking was accepted.

Then, I was posted to the UK by the Defense Department in mid-1992. 
That Christmas, what did I get from my wife but a pipe, of the filter 
variety.  She had quit smoking a few months after I met her (at my
suggestion, I might add, but that is another story), and considered
it her wifely duty to nag me occasionally to give up the evil weed,
but to no effect whatsoever.  She thought perhaps she could
encourage a shift from cigarette to pipe, which in her estimation
would be an improvement if not an ideal state of affairs.

I reflected on my past failed attempts to take up the pipe, decided
that if ever I were to succeed at it England would be the place where
it would occur, and presented myself at Tobacco World in the Regent
Arcade, pipe in hand, demanding that the piece of rubbish cum filter
be replaced with a good pipe and inquiring what sort of tobaccos were
on offer.

Peter Kelly (may he rest in peace) metaphorically took me in hand. 
He gently interrogated me on my past experiences with the pipe and
circumstances under which I would be smoking, swapped the disdained
piece of wood for a Peterson model 317, and provided an ounce of
Kentucky Nougat tobacco plus the necessary incidentals: inexpensive
IMCO butane pipe lighter, butane, flints, tapered pipe cleaners, and
such.  To this day, I have no idea what tobacco was in the Kentucky
Nougat.  Peter had several house blends he made up in the back room,
and like most tobacconists he viewed his ingredients lists as
proprietary.

About 3 weeks later, I complained to Peter that the pipe was still
smoking hot, even though it was beginning to break in well.  Instead
of the expected lecture on proper puffing, he simply took
three-quarters ounce of Kentucky Nougat, added to it a quarter ounce
of Scotch Cake, and sent me off again.  The heat problem was solved. 
And my next time in, I bought a second Peterson 317, this time a
Rustic, which smoked even better than the first smooth-finish one.
(The collection is now at 14 pipes, and I am thinking about a rack
that would hold 24 to allow room for growth.  But back to sequence.)

 I had started taking my pipe (later pipes) to work, and smoking
while on break, and I found a couple of mentors that were to prove
crucial.  My section chief, Mike Greenall, had taken up pipe smoking
while in the RAF.  His preferred pipe was a Dr. Plumb's Perfect Pipe,
Miniature (i.e. a short pipe with a very heavy bowl that sold for
about 6 or 7 pounds -- about $10 to $12 worth of UK Sterling, not 
weight).  He generally carried it in a shirt or jacket pocket- lit or 
unlit -in polite company, but with the stem tucked in his sock in an 
informal environment.  His tobacco was the original Condor.  His
first  bit of advice was that the quality of pipe was less important
than the quantity.  I should have a minimum of a half-dozen, and a
few more extras would be all to the good. 

My other mentor was one Mr. Black, a former Royal Army man, who
declared himself to have no sense of taste at all but a smoker of
Condor because of the psychic and physical pleasure it offered.  He
taught me much of what I know about how to take care of pipes and
tobaccos.  

Information gained over a 2.5-year period from these three (Peter
Kelly, Mike Greenall, and Mr. Black) plus what I have gained from my
small but expanding library of pipe and tobacco literature, seasoned
with opinion distilled from personal experience, constitutes my
stock in trade offered on alt.smokers.pipes.

But to return to tobaccos:  Even though the Kentucky Nougat-Scotch
Cake was smokeable, and pleasing in taste, I still was not entirely 
satisfied.  Often, I would smoke a bowl, and find myself craving a 
cigarette.  Not what I really wanted.

I resumed trials of other tobaccos.  I liked a pleasant aroma and
taste, and experimentation soon established that I craved strength in
both nicotine and tar.  And, to complicate matters, my mucous
membranes in the sinuses, throat, and mouth proved sensitive to most
tobaccos that provided aroma/taste, nicotine, and tar, all in
abundance.

After buying a couple of pounds of tobacco in "an ounce of this, and
try an ounce of that" fashion, I tallied the results and took the list
in to Peter.  With a couple of exceptions, everything that I liked and
that seemed to like me proved to be a flake tobacco made by Gawith,
Hoggarth &amp; Co.  I promptly focused on GHC tobaccos, and tried others
that Peter stocked that I had not yet sampled.  The twist tobaccos
proved to be pleasant, but too strong for me.  (Perhaps in my old
age, when I need to be parsimonious in my pleasures...).  And the mild
to medium varieties also were pleasant, but I reencountered the
earlier problem of finishing a bowl of pipe tobacco and craving a
cigarette.  The shag and other ready-rubbed varieties were ok, but
not as good as the flakes.  To summarize my current position on GHC
tobaccos, bearing in mind that these reflect highly personal 
judgments:

Rum Flake and Coniston Cut Plug are my staple tobaccos.  I sometimes
start with the Cut Plug earlier in the day and leave the Rum Flake for
evenings, when a slightly heavier effect is desired, but it is far
from unusual for me to take up an unfinished bowl of Rum Flake from
the night before and relight it to start the day.

Glengarry Flake provides a pleasant aroma, at a slight cost in
strength and a slight touch more irritation to the membranes.  I
liked it enough to get a pound for more thorough assessment, but since
the arrival of  Broken Flake No. 7 (see below) have been smoking that
instead.      

Bob's Flake provides a chocolate flavor and aroma that I find
pleasing.  It is a touch light on strength, so I usually smoke only
one bowl of it and then switch back to something stronger.

Broken Flake No. 7 offers a pleasant change of pace from the 
preceding.  I received a sample of it while in the UK (two bowls
worth) and a pound provided by Bob Lynch arrived just recently.  
I am still working on the detailed assessment.  

Kendal Flake is pleasant enough, but decidedly lacking in strength.

Dark Flake is very good on taste and strength, but slightly abrasive.

I assume that Peter's Scotch Cake was GHC Broken Scotch Cake.  It is
essentially neutral in taste and strength, but burns very cool and
slow.  Get some and mix it with a tobacco you like the taste of but
that burns too fast and hot.

If you like Virginia, get some of the GHC-manufactured Virginia. 
You may find that just as not all that glitters is pyrite, not all
Virginia is  of equal value.  The manufacturing process used does
make a difference. 

A paper read long ago on statistical analysis of failures in
semiconductors convinced me that a sample size under 30 meant that no
meaningful analysis could be done.  As my pipe collection remains
below half that magic number,  I probably should never discuss it at
all.  I have done so, on occasion,  in posts to alt.smokers.pipes,
and will probably do so again, but I will  spare you gentle reader
the gory details on this occasion.

To take up a theme implicit in my chronology above, my transition
from Oklahoma nonsmoking teenager to confirmed pipe smoker has taken
decades and several serious efforts.  This may be ascribed to
ignorance on my part, and of that there was plenty, but a second
critical factor was that tobaccos suitable for me were not readily
available.  The third factor, pipes, was a problem only in so far as
I did not realize how many I needed nor how critical having that
number was.

Had I known in 1961 what I know today, and had Gawith, Hoggarth &amp;
Co. tobaccos been available, I would not have missed the pleasures
and satisfaction of pipe smoking during most of my life.  It is not
my intent or desire to convert others to a theology of pipe smoking,
nor do I think those things that have proved most important to
me will be similarly important to all others.  But I do think there
are many today who like me in the 1960s would take up and enjoy the
pipe if they could, but do not due to ignorance and lack of guidance.
To help them, as Peter, Mike and Mr. Black helped me, I am pleased to
contribute to Pipe Digest, alt.smokers.pipes, and other fora.  And 
given the tobaccos readily available in the U.S., I think they need 
all the help they can get.

Which brings me to a final tag-end:  Some have noticed that I "plug"
Gawith, Hoggarth &amp; Co. tobaccos in posts to alt.smokers.pipes.  And of
course, you may have noticed my views above.  I must confess, my
motives  are not entirely altruistic.  True, I personally find
consider them the  best tobaccos available, but not all may share
that view.  The crux for me is, if the GHC distributor for the U.S.
and Canada Bob Lynch  gives up the business entirely (and he has
already given up advertising,  because it is too expensive) or should
he die (and he is a retiree, with  a limited life-span ahead of him)
and the business not be lucrative  enough for someone else to carry
on, I shall be able to get my preferred  tobaccos only by ordering
them from the UK, and that is expensive!   When I was sampling
everything available from tobacconists in the  Northern Virginia area
(Tobacco Barn, John B. Hayes, Georgetown Tobacco,  John Crouch, plus
telephone inquiries to Fader's and the Smoke Shop in  Annapolis), and
finding nothing but what I considered adulterated rubbish  and
only-marginally-unacceptable import tins, I called Ann Kelly and had 
her send me a couple of pounds Air Mail.  Bottom Line on the
Mastercard  bill:  $80 a pound.

Ouch!

Subject: pipe smoking on the campus

this letter is partly in regards to a letter in the last digest 
concerning pipe smoking on college campuses.

i currently attend calvin college in grand rapids michigan.  i have been 
smoking at great intervals a borrowed (from my father) bent whitehall of 
london briar. this has been somewhat inhibited by a campus rule.  our campus 
has a no smoking policy in all the buildings on campus.  (tons of fun in 
the cold michigan winters, let me tell you.)  despite this, the 
percentage of smokers here is quite high.  sadly, most choose cheap 
cigarettes.  

part of my motive for learning the art of the pipe was the society that 
goes on outside the buildings.  especially on warmer nights, the 
gathering of smokers allows for plans to be made and ideas to be shared.  
we have a comunity here.  though our number may be small, we pipe smokers 
are a happy lot.

Subject: Cigar Lists

   =========== A 1 Cigar's Notice ==========

We have received the first shipment of the year from Cuba. 
Most are fillins of higher volume lower priced cigars.

**"The Cubans have changed the Inspection Codes"** 

As of Janruary 1, 1996 the old inspection codes are no more.

We received MonteCristos No. 3 and the tubos #6.
Romeo y Julieta Cazadores and Cedros de Luxe No 1.
Juan Lopez Seleccion No 1 (great)

Some of the reserved cigars are being shipped now.

There are Cuban cigar shortages and shipment delays.

Everyone that deals with Cuba has a limiting Cigar quota.  
These quotas are calculated the first of every year.
On certain cigars the whole year's quota is sold by mid year.
This is the big reason for the end-of-the-year cigar shortages.  

We have some great cigars in the bonded warehouse.
Check the "Available" list.
If you do not receive the "Available" list 
and would like to, please email us.
    * Where there is a will, there is a way. *

Subject: Parker Pipes and aging tobacco

Hello Steve and all pipe smokers;

The other day I was smoking one of my favorite tobaccos(LPI Bombay court)
in one of my favorite pipes and wonder;why don't more people talk about
Parker pipes?I bought this one about six years ago new.Its a large,half
bent smooth finish "Earl".Even at a rather overpriced tobacconist,I beleive
I paid $55.00 or so.If I remember correctly this is the brand that uses the
seconds from Dunhill.The pipe looks like a Dunhill and smokes
wonderfully.It does have a number of sand pits on the surface,but they are
barely noticable and certainly don't have any effect on the smoke.I would
imagine this to be a group six size bowl.I don't remember the last pipe
shop I was in that I noticed Parkers.I have heard of Parker-Hardcastle but
don't know if they are of the same maker or the same(Dunhill seconds)
quality as this Parker.I wonder if anyone else has any thoughts on the
suject.
     As far as tobacco aging goes,I've been putting away a tin here and a
tin there for the last four years or so and am really begining to reap the
rewards.The aforementioned tin of Bombay Court is dated 9/5/91.Upon opening
it,the tobacco,particularly the Virginias was covered with sugar
crystals.The smoke was sooooo smooth.The oriental and latakia was a perfect
marriage!The taste is vastly different from the cans of Bombay that I've
opened in the past,and smoked without the benefit of aging.I'm hoping this
is the case for the older tins of Escudo that I have laying around as
well.I usually pick up a tin of something each time I visit a tobacco shop
and put a date on it for my "cellar".My regular smoke usually rotates
between MacBaren Plumcake and Dunhill Royal Yacht.In the house,for those
times I need a nice smelling aromatic,I really am impressed with
Cornell&amp;Diehl #815,a really nice chocolate that smokes to the bottom of the
bowl leaving nothing but a grey-white ash.Try that with Capt Black.Of
course Capt does have a non smoker pleasing aroma.
Well,keep up the good work and I think if circulation gets much higher,your
sign-off will stand a good chance of coming true(Pipe smokers may indeed
rule the world!).
               Humbly Submitted
               Mike Stanley:-?

[ADMIN] Kam Kashani (????@???.???), Robert Pluta
(??????@???????????.???) and Stuart Altschuler (???@?????.???) all
responded to my question re Sergio Iannini's message (subject:
"Special Offer for Pipes Digest readers") in the last issue.  Well,
this is a case in which Yr. Obdt. Moderator should have read his own
policy!  Which says, pretty plainly, that advertising is welcome if
it's brief, not repeated too much, and on topic for the group (e.g.,
for pipes, cigars, tobacco, and related stuff.)  But off-topic ads
(e.g., for phone services) are another matter, and always have been;
the article simply shouldn't have gotten in.  My apologies to anyone
whose hackles were raised.

And now, let us take the phone off the hook, light up, and smooth our
hackles a bit...  and look in this issue for some upcoming pipe shows,
including one by the New Yok Pipe Club this weekend!

Subject:       Re: Pipes Digest #210 -- February 12, 1996

Fine Pipes Have Arrived in Moscow!

After three and a half years living here in
Moscow and doing my pipe shopping just about
anywhere else, collector's pipes such as
Ser Jacopo, Mastro de Paja and Stanwell have
arrived, along with Dunhill. I hope to join
the fray soon by becoming the agent for Courrieu;
they invited me to meet with them when I visit
France again in April.

The only question is, how badly did I get ripped
off by buying a Ser Jacopo Delecta with silver
band and spigot for 360$ (1,690,000 rubles,
for anyone who follows Russia)? What is the going
price for such a pipe in the US or Europe?

Also, this pipe, the 50th in my collection, marked
my first purchase of a filter pipe. I know that
in my native New York, real men don't smoke filter pipes,
but the filter really makes a difference in 
controlling wetness. I will probably add a few
more filter pipes to my collection this year.
Any comments on filter pipes?

Yitzchak Schier, Moscow.

[ Was the Ser Jacopo new or "estate", Yitzchak?  I've had many others
praise the European 9mm filter system. -S. ]

 ... just a few comments on Dirk Bahlo's message:
 &gt; 
 &gt; From: "Dirk Bahlo" &lt;????.?????@??.???????????????.??&gt;
 &gt; Subject: re: German pipe brands
 
 &gt;    There are indeed decent brands that come from Germany, but not many, 
 &gt; that is only two, as far as I know. One of them is *Vauen*. The 

There are also some (approx. 5-10) excellent German pipe makers who
make a few hand-made pipes per year; names that cross my mind are:
Ingo Garbe (who actually lives in Denmark these days), Klaus
Billerbeck (Hamburg), Juls (Julian Schaefer?), Bertram Safferling,
etc). Futhermore, there is a company called DB Design (?) located in
Berlin; they produce machine-made pipes I would consider to be in the
same category as Vauen. And there is Bentley, who either have their
design made in Switzerland and produce in Germany, or vice versa (I
keep confusing this).

I am personally not so enthusiastic about Vauen pipes; I own two of
them found bothsomewhat dissappointing. As to my experience, you get
better value for money from Stanwell or Savinelli. But this is of
course a matter of personal taste. It might be related to the fact
that I belong to the minority of 10% in Germany who do not like
filters...  Btw, Vauen will also deliver their pipes without a
filter-hole in the shank (upon request).

 &gt;    The second one is *Oldenkott*. 

As far as I know, Oldenkott went bankrupt a couple of years ago. They
became known outside Germany for producing the famous Porsche
pipe. Now and then you can still find some of their pipes in the
shops.

Finally, and not related to the above: if you should happen to be in
Milan, Italy: stand in front of the cathedral, look for a shopping
arcade to the left (after visiting the cathedral of course :-)). Near
its end on the right hand side, there is a shop with a spectacular
selection of Castello pipes (probably more than 200 pieces). Prices
are _very_ interesting due to the "cheap" Italian Lira (a "Collection
Fiamata" was about US-$ 300.00 a few weeks ago).  A real "must".  Some
knowledge of Italian is, however, useful.

Best,
	Joachim.

[ Thanks, Joachim!  If anyone can get the name of the shop in Milan,
I'll put it in the Guide. -S. ]

A quick correction.  In the last digest, someone commented about 
Gerald MCRainey and Jameson Parker of the TV show "Simon &amp; Simon".  It 
was thought that Gerald McRainey was much more comfortable with them than 
Jameson Parker.  I have a newsletter from Amphora that I picked up at a 
pipe show in Northern Virginia a few years back that has an article from 
Richard Hacker where he had interviewed Jameson Parker who IS a pipe 
smoker. So perhaps his seeming discomfort was just really good acting. . .

Subject: Lee Van Cleef's pipe

Several pipees have wondered whether the actor Lee Van Cleef is (was?) a 
"real life" pipe smoker, and what that pipe was he smoked in "For a Few 
Dollars More".  In The Ultimate Pipe Book, Hacker identifies Van Cleef 
as a notable pipee, and comments "actor Lee Van Cleef puffed on a 
well-used meerschaum as he played a bounty hunter opposite Clint 
Eastwood ..." (p. 214).

For what it's worth,
Timothy Woods

            Jeff "Charlie" Jewell, Wrote about acters smoking pipes in the
movies. I also notice acters when they are smoking pipes my alltime favorite
movie "THE WINDS OF WAR" features Peter Graves smoking a pipe, and another
acter his name escapes me right now. But those scenes sparked my interest in
smoking a pipe.

      Just thought I'd put my 2 cents in

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #210 -- February 12, 1996

Dear readers of Pipe Digest:

I am a relatively new pipe smoker and have a short question.  I recently
bought a tin of an English style tobacco from a well known and expensive
tobacco distributor known better for their cigars, which shall remain
nameless as I enjoy their cigars.  However, when I opened the tin, the smell
was, well, very unpleasant.  Now I love the smell of a tobacco shop, and
have never disliked any pipe tobacco I've encountered until now.  Is it
possible I received a bad tin, or is it because the mixture is "English" and
I'm used to more "Danish" blends of Virginia, Burley and Cavendish tobaccos?
The mixture in question is composed of red Virginia, Oriental tobaccos and
Latakia.

S.M.S.

[ Latakia smells fairly strong... can you describe the way in which it
was unpleasant? -S. ]

Subject: Dunhill's Fellowship of the White Spot.

Dear Steve,

I have been off-line for a while and found some old e-mails asking for
invitations to join Dunhill's Fellowship of the White Spot. I regret that it
took me so long to respond the their requests. Since my computer problems are
fixed and I am back on line I will be happy to send any invitations to those
that request them. If any members would like one mailed to them they may
e-mail me their postal address. My e-mail address is ??????????@???.???. If
any members have requested this in the past and found me unresponsive I
appologize. Any postal addresses received will be kept in strict confidence.
Nobody hates unsolicited mail more than me.

Sincerely,

Subject: Reply to Jason Helmick Letter

Hi Steve,

As always I enjoyed the PD this morning over a good cup of coffee and my
morning wake pipe. While reading Jason Helmick's letter I was reminded of
the attitude of our local tobacco shop. Its the Pipe and Pouch Tobacco Shop
located in Fairbanks, Alaska. The proprietory, who's name is Dave, also
tends to be rather rude. In fact his rudness has me ordering my pipe and
tobac by mail rather than endure his attitude. I have been to his shop on
six different occasions and on five of them he has treated me as if I was
more of an inconvience, rather than a paying customer. One the sixth he
smiled, well actual this occured during the third visit or I would'nt have
tried his place a fifth and sixth time. At first I assumed he was just
having a bad day. So either all his days are bad or he's just does'nt care
about his clientel.

This has cost him quit a bit in the last couple of years. I actual live in
North Pole, Ak. approximately 15 miles from Fairbanks, and although he is
the only tobac shop for 350 miles, I'll never use him again. I have bought
about 8 new pipes during the last 24 months, this includes Peterson,
Bonfiglioli, and West's, not cheap pipes and various amounts of different
tobaccos for my smoking enjoyment. So to all who visit Fairbanks, bring your
own tobacco. The service is'nt worth it.

Now for a good note, if your traveling through Anchorage on your way up
north, stop by and vist the Tobacco Cache on Northern Lights Blvd. They have
always helped me with any questions and will blend any mix you like. I don't
have their address at the moment, but will get it and send to you for
inclusion in the digest. And if their are any fellow pipe smokers in living
in the bush, the TC will does mail orders.

Thanks, John 

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
	Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I 
	cannot change, the courage to change the things I can,
	and the wisdom to ignore those that piss me off.

Subject: Merchandise Offering for Pipes Digest Readers

Steve, I have a rather interesting cigar-related fashion item that might be
of interest to some of your readers.  It's a sweatshirt that artistically
're-creates' a newspaper clipping of the rather wonderful things Bill Clinton
said about cigars and pipes last summer during the Washington Tobacco
Industry Inquest.  I'd be delighted to send you a sample sweatshirt, with my
compliments, to see if you think that there might be a palatable way of
offering it to readers (I seem to remember some specific restrictions
regarding commerciality when I first signed on to the newsletter).

By way of background, I have a rather popular cigar-of-the-month club (Black
Tie Connoisseurs 'Cigar Celebration'; <a href="http://www.nafta.net/cigars/blacktie)-">http://www.nafta.net/cigars/blacktie)-</a>
we sell the sweatshirt, along with a limited number of other items, for
$29.95 + S/H/Tax in IL.

[ Personal note deleted. -S. ]

Dear Steve,

I tryed all over the net, but you seem to be the best to help me with a 
little bad problem, that I can't solve in Italy.

I broken a mouthpiece of a Parker Pipe, new(!), that I received as 
present. :-((

Now I need as soon as possible an address in Europe for the Parker to 
send the defective mouthpiece to have a good one back.

I don't like that who gave me the gift realised that a very expensiv pipe 
was defective, you know... So I need to find Parker very soon to hide 
this tragedy!!!

If you can't help me I'll aprreciate any suggestions.

Thanks a lot and sorry for annoying you.

Francesco De Luca

[ Parker isn't in the Guide.  Can anyone help Francesco?  Also see the
following; if true, it might be worthwhile to contact Dunhill. -S. ]

Hello, Steve, I really enjoy the digest. Up to now, I have restrained from
posting any comments, but in Mike Stanley's article, Parker pipes are
mentioned. It just so happens, that last Saturday, I was browsing the local
Huntsville pipe shop, The Humidor, and came across a Parker Hardcastle. I,
too, have the understanding that Parker Hardcastles are produced by Dunhill.
Nevertheless, this pipe has quickly turned into the favorite in my
collection of Petersons, GBDs, and varied expensive Italian handmades. It's
light, smokes cool, and has the traditional look of and English pipe which I
like. Though, I paid $65.00 for this pipe, I feel it was well worth it. Keep
up the great work and smoke in peace.

Subject: Important Information

Hi all you cigar aficianados!

I have very important news for all of you in the New Jersey/New York area, if
you are interested in smokers' nights.

Here is the ad that I found in the newspaper:

Cigar Evening Smoke-In Gala Planned for area Aficianados

Carmen J. Maggio, president of Rowe-Manse Emporium, announced plans today for
the first in a series of Smoker's Evenings in New Jersey.  A "Magnificent
Evening for Cigar Aficianados" will be held on March 8, 1996 at Mayfair Farms
in West Orange, New Jersey.

The magnificent evening will include a wonderful 5 course Gourmet Dinner,
complete with cocktail hour, international hors 'oeurvres, fine wines and
brandies along with fine hand-made cigars to compliment each course.  The
evening also includes an expert cigar roller, a guest speaker, appearances by
stage and screen personalities and numerous door prizes ranging from weekends
for two at Trump Plaza to cigar humidors.

Carmen J. Maggio indicates that there will be additional Cigar Dinners held
throughout the year.  Rowe-Manse also has a Cigar Club which cigar smokers
may join to take advantage of specials, events, etc. etc.

Mr. Maggio is currently searching for a 1920's railroad car, which he plans
to use as a "smoking car" to provide a comfortable setting for his
cigar-smoking customers to relax and enjoy a cappuccino with their cigars
while wives shop.  The railroad car will be placed at the rear of the store.
  
{{{Just a note, guys.  I didn't write this.  So I didn't put in the part
about smoking while wives shop.  I consider myself a "womanist,"  and I
understand that many of the smokers on this list are woman.  Well, on with
the advertisement}}}

Those interested in signing aboard for a truly magnificent evening are
encouraged to call  1-800-633-3100

IF you guys would like to go, feel free, but I already have prior
engagements.

Bye,

Mike

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #210 -- February 12, 1996

Dear Steve,

I have been with PD since PD #198, but this is my first
contribution.

In PD #210, Steve Russo (????????@????.????????.???) mentions
something about roll-you-own cigars. I, for one, would be
interested in more information, as I am both a pipe and cigar
smoker (I started on the pipe, though). (Note that this is cc'd
to him.)

This triggered a thought: where do I get the raw materials? Since
my family maintains a large garden, I am sure I can take a
corner, or even expand the present one, to produce tobacco.

So, the question is, does anyone know about growing tobacco? What
should I treat the soil with? Does tobacco prefer acid/alkaline
conditions? Will I be able to get a crop in the northeast (NE PA,
almost NYS)? Most importantly, where do I get seed/shoots to
start the plants?

I would like to thank anyone in advance for any information.

John Belli
aka Sir Twist

PS to SM: Keep up the great work on the Digest! I look forward to
it every other week.

I've collected a few sources of seed in the Guide.

On a related topic, Gerry Hilton (???????@???.????.??.??), having
grown quite a bit of Nova Scotian leaf, asked about pressing his own
tobacco in the last issue of the Digest. By conicidence, the latest
issue of "Pipe Friendly" has a nice article from Steve Johnson
(????????@???.???) on a home-built pressing process.  Contact Joel

Subject: Home Cigar-Making Kit (up date)

Hi Steve,

I have an unfortunate up date to my attempt at producing a Home
Cigar-Making Kit.  Due to the prohibitive massive government red tape (ATF)
involved in getting a license to sell tobacco products and leafs, the
reality of producing this kit is too difficult.  However, there is a cigar
maker in Sacramento, CA who makes the best handmade cigars anywhere in the
world.  Casillas Cigars are every bit as good in quality as A. Fuente,
Padron, Macanudo, ect. for about half the price.  Each cigar consists of :
Wrapper - Connecticut Natural, Ecuador Natural, Mexican, and Maduro.   Long
Filler - Ecuador, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Nicaragua.
Binders- Mexican, Ecuador.
Wrapper + Filler + Binder =  5 Country Blend.   Compare that to any
commercially available cigar!

CASILLAS CIGARS
1221 16Th Street
Sacramento, CA 95814
(916) 442-4554

Enjoy! and tell them Steve Russo sent you. Thanks

Steve R. Russo

[ Thanks, Steve!  Since cigar rollers typically take years to learn
their craft, I'm sure that this is even a better find than a
roll-your-own kit. -S. ]

Subject: Pipe situation in France

I need some information from others who are familiar with the pipe
situation in France.  I will be in France in June of this year, with most
of the time spent in the South of France in Provence.

Anybody had any experience on shops, local carvers, museums, etc.

Any information or leads would be appreciated.  I may be contacted through
E-Mail: ????????@??????.???

Best to all!

Subject: pipe bio

Hi everybody I'm new to this internet stuff so please bear with me. I am 32
yrs old and have a small collection of pipes mostly ascorti and cao
meerschaum pipes. I have enjoyed smoking my pipes since high school. I like
to collect matched sets of briar &amp; meerschaum pipes, so if anyone knows
where I may find some please let me know, I also would like to find a
supplier of Ascorti pipes since the tinder box stores in my area seem to be
closing shop.

I would also like to reply to Tony Spiegel question about differences
between drug store pipes and the more expensive pipes. I to started out with
drug store pipes then my granfather bought me my first Ascorti pipe. I think
you will find that quality pipes will burn cooler and therefor smoke better.
Some cheaper pipes also use wood fillers to make the pipe look better but
this also causes hot spots.  There are also different grades of briars just
as ther are different grades of wood used in building fine furniture.If you
can afford the better pipes I think you will enjoy relaxing with them more.

I would also like to thank Douglas Cope for his helpful hints on viewing the
pipe digest and the saving of usefull info to files.

By the way I realy enjoy the pipe digest.  Keep up the good work

From: ???????@???.????????.??? (Jon Erik Penvose)
Subject: A few thoughts regarding Pipes Digest #210...

Greetings,

A few various and sundry items hopefully of general interest.  First,
I was impressed by Mark Peterson's rather complete tutorial relating
to the use of oversized pipes.  I personally dislike very large pipes,
as they make my jawbone hurt from the weight.  However, his
suggestions on smoking technique would certainly help those who are
not gaining full enjoyment from their pipe smoking experience.  I am
not clear though, on what Mr. Peterson meant by inhaling smoke.  Does
this mean inhaling into the lungs?  Whenever I inhale pipe smoke into
my lungs, it is by accident and it is not at all pleasant.  I have
been under the impression that almost no one inhales pipe smoke into
the lungs.  I wonder, is the practice more prevalant than I thought it
was?

Second, regarding the question of commercial advertising in the
Digest.  Please cast my vote against advertising that is not related
to the subject of this publication.  I realize everyone has to make a
living, but this is not the place for it.

The real driving force that caused me to write this time regards the
submission by Jason C. Helmick regarding the unfortunate experience
suffered by his wife and her friend.  Here is a situation where a
paying customer is treated like dirt by a salesperson for no better
reason than the fact that he can not put his predjuces aside long
enough to conduct a business transaction.  When I read Mr. Helmick's
letter, I was impacted; I felt an emotional response (this is unusual
for me, I normally have a very detached view of things).  As I
reflected upon it, I found that I felt ashamed and embarrassed by the
clerk's actions to the ladies.  You see, I believe that pipe smokers
are a distinct class of people.  I assert that, more often than not,
pipe smokers are people who have resolved certain basic problems
dealing with life.  A pipe smoker is someone who is and should be the
voice of reason, calm, and balance.  I found that the feeling of
embarassment I felt was the fact that these salesclerks and I are
supposed to be part of the same niche in society.  Their inexcuseable
actions reflect not only on myself, but all pipe smokers as a whole.
And that, my good friends, is a terrible shame.

I myself was once made to feel unwelcome by the owner of a smokeshop.
Last year, I learned that a Tinder Box location was opening in nearby
Harrisburg, PA.  I had frequented a Tinder Box when I lived for a time
in Tacoma, WA, and I was satisfied with my dealings there.  I had a
Friday off, so I braved the crushing Friday afternoon city traffic to
pay a visit.  I soon learned that this Tinder Box was tailored for the
suit, tie, and cufflinks crowd; which does not include me very often.
Although the owner was not openly rude, he made it crystal clear that
I was not a welcome guest in his store.  What a dissapointment.

Well, I suppose I've lectured long enough.  Keep up the good work,
Steve.  It does not go unnoticed.

Regards,

Jon Erik Penvose (???????@???.???????.???)

[ Thanks, Jon!  I also was wondering what readers thought about Mark
Peterson's suggestion on inhaling smoke.  I've known people who did,
but personally I agree with you. -S. ]

Subject: Re:  A little about me

Hi Steve,

My name is Jude Rennolds.  This e-mail is my girlfriends.  I am blind, 
have a seeing eye dog and love pipes and pipe smoking.  Toni and I and 
recently discovered the Net.  This is facisinating for me.  She has 
been reading the different things that we are coming across.  

I have been a pipe for about 20 years.  I have a few pipes that I love.
My favorits being, Cessini 8-dot (I think that how that is spelled), 
Lovat, I have a Dunhill from the '30's an number 2 i would say, and a 
Savanelli, Punto 'Oro.  I have others, but these I enjoy most of the 
time.  Some of my favorite tobaccos are Dunhill Black Aromatic, 
Straight Virginia, house Blend from Gus's Smoke shop, Sherman Oaks, 
CA., Ancient Mariner, Boswains Mate, also from Gus's, Honey Cavendish, 
from the Tinder Box, Santa Monica and Epicurian also from the Tinder 
Box.  I have smoked for many years and I like variety, but for the 
present the Honey Cavendish is my favorite.  I am really enjoying 
finding these resources.  It has taken many years to find out that it 
takes skill to smoke a pipe.  

I will relate a story that happened a fews years back.  My pipe smoking 
brother and I were at Gus's in the Valley, I bought a Comoy Bulldog, He 
a #2 Dunhill Billiard (both estate pipes).  AT the time my favorite 
tabacco was Punchbowl, from a company in Ireland, and my friend smoked 
Craven mixture, same company.  We bought our treasures, could hardly 
wait to light up, ran to the car, and reclined the seats, and I have a 
little keychain screwdriver for opening tins, with our ears to our tins 
we opened the tins to hear the hissing of the air escaping the tins.  
Loaded our bowls, lit our pipes and smoked ourselves into a coma.  We 
could not wait to drive home.  Coming out of the coma we realized that 
the car was full of smoke, visability zero, opened the windows, smoke 
billowed out, and passerbys were laughing.  What a heavenly memory.

Thanks and looking forward to being a subscriber!

Not a PD submission but simply a question - in #210 you mention a pipe show 
near Newark airport the weekend of 3/1.  Who is running the show and do you 
have anymore information?  I'd appreciate it if you could forward anything you

Subject: Ohio Pipe Collectors 1996 Swap/Sell Show

Steve, I'm really pleased to announce the final details of the 1996 Ohio
Pipe Collectors swap/sell pipe show (pipes only; no cigars) on Saturday,
Sept. 14, 1996 at the Holiday Inn on Lane Ave. in Columbus.  This is the
same location as last year, but we have increased the space by half again,
with room for 65 dealer tables.  Again, there will be no admission charge
for the public. Dealer tables are $25 until June 1, $30 thereafter, first
come first served.  As Neil Murray recorded so well, in words and pictures,
in his Agricultural and Mechanical Gazette, last year's show was a huge
success.  We're getting a much earlier start this year and are expecting a
much bigger and better show.
 
The Holiday Inn (614-294-4848) is offering a special rate of $69 for show
attendees for single, double, triple and quadruple rooms, so for all who
plan to come, get your reservation in early and troll for others to share a
room with you.
 
Last year was my first attempt at producing a show, and I was extremely
nervous, but right now I'm confident of a huge success. If any of your
subscribers would like a show flyer (or more than one if you can distribute
them), please send me your mailing address.  Also, if anyone would like to
rent one or more tables, contact me for a participation sheet, which also
contains a line for donations to our raffle--the thing that keeps us in the
black, as the rest of our money goes for show expenses and producing our
quarterly newsletter (or magazine, as my wife said after the last one).  If
anyone would like to donate something for the raffle in exchange for all
the fulsome praise we can heap upon you and publicity we can give you,
please write for a sheet.
 
Having gone over 100 members last year, we are shooting for 200 this year
(dues only $12 per year, pro-rated for new members). As always, anyone
interested in joining the OPC should contact me for a complimentary
newsletter.  Our mailing address is Ohio Pipe Collectors, P.O. Box 9642,
Columbus OH 43209.  Thanks for your help.

If you've got one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you've got more than
one, you're a pipe collector.
Bill Unger
Secretary, Ohio Pipe Collectors

Subject: Italian pipe makers

Hi Steve,

Wonder if you can help me out on this one.  My brother in law is going to 
Italy for 2 weeks and I'd like him to pick me up a pipe (or a couple 
depending on price).  I was wondering if you knew of or had a reference 
of Italian pipe makers listed by town?  The highgrade briar Italian pipe 
makers must sell direct, don't they?  Or is it better to go to a 
smoke/pipe shop to buy?  Any idea of quality pipe shops in Italy?  How 
do the prices compare, I am assuming that they will be better buying over 
there than trying to purchase here.  

I know this is a lot to ask but you are the guru.......

Thanks 
Joe Murphy

Subject: militias in ASP...?

Steve-

Have you seen the recent postings by [deleted. -S.] and a few
others...?  Louis went ranting that if the feds ever came to take away
his tobacco or his automatic weapons he'd shoot them the way Gordon
Liddy recommended (i.e.  to be sure to kill them quickly), and then
someone else who has (of all things!) a service record with the USMC
on his sig said something vaguely approving about that, and now we
have [deleted. -S.] talking about something that sounds suspiciously
related.  Are these guys just doing the macho mode or is there
something we should be "concerned about"...?

Not to go calling for censorship of their little rants, but frankly it bugs
me, and it's not like I'm being squeamish or anything.  What's your opinion
of all this...?  

-george   ??@????.???

[ Personal opinion: Those who wave guns as a first response deserve no
more respect than those who wave prohibitions.  Neither is mature or
well-reasoned.

And please see below for one man's far better response to a town with
prohibitionistic tendencies! -S. ]

Subject: Boulder smoking ban &amp; Laudisio's Italian Restaurant

[ Picked up from alt.smokes.cigars, with permission of the author. -S. ]

There is a thread within ASC about Boulder's anti-smoking law. 

Essentially, Boulder residents voted to ban all smoking in public
places (yes, to Boulder-ites, your restaurant is a public place). In
order to permit smoking, the room must be sealed from any non-smoking
areas (yeah - sealed). You must have a seperate ventilation system
also.

One restaurant was going to have a cigar dinner, but caved in because
they feared lingering smells the following day. One Hotel had a nice
smoking area, but banned cigars now because the cigarrette smokers
complained about the smell! ( Hotel Boulderado - call and let them
hear from you if you're inclined (303) 442-4344 )

Now realize, this town thinks of itself as "too hip". There are more
"under 50-year olds" living off trust funds per-capita than anywhere
else in the USA. Heard the term: idle-rich? They're here and deciding
how we should live. (hey, nothing against being rich - I trying also)
The kicker is that this town supports and promotes the notions of
"freedom" and "self-expression" like Atlanta promotes the Olympics! 

There is one true maverick in this town and he's a real character.
Antonio Laudisio. His restaurant (one of the finest and the BEST wine
list in town) has been non-smoking for 8 years prior to the smoking
ban. The "ban" completely goes against his grain and he is putting his
money behind his principals. 

Antonio cleared out a stockroom, painted the walls and ceiling, added
persian carpet and fine antiques, installed a mother of a ventilation
system, installed a humidor, added lots of Wine Spectator and CA mags,
and great books on Cuba and cigars. The lighting is subtle and the
service is terrific. His entire staff is attentive to the cigar crowd
and very polite.

Now, Laudisio's Italian Restaurant is THE place in this area for cigar
smokers!  There has never been any pressure to spend money and
sometimes we spend alot, sometimes very little. We have a secluded
smoking room, lots of conversation, great people and true freedom to
do as we please.

If you even think of coming to the Boulder area, please stop in and
say hello to some fellow  ASCers.

Their number is 303/442-1300.

Matt Steele

[ Excellent, Matt!  And if you're reading this, please give my
congratulations to Antonio on his bravery, and wish him the best of
success in his venture. -S. ]

Subject: Help Me

     Dear Sir

I started smoking pipe not long ago, and i have some difficulties in it. I
asked a friend of mine, who is also a new pipe smoker, and he suggested that
i contact you for help (in fact, i`m sending that email through him).
I`ve read your "how to" section about pipes, and i have several "up to the
point" questions. If you would be willing to help me, i would very gratefull.

1. In your "how to" section, you wrote : "Try to smoke all the way down". Is
this mean that i am to smoke to tobacco "all the way down" to the lungs? -a
salesman in the pipe shop told me that it is forbidden, for you can die from
the hot smoke you breath. Nevertheless, only through smoking the pipe all
the way to the lungs gives me the sense of taste from the tobacco. What
shall i do?

2. You said that a "cake" is leaving of millimieters of tobacco inside your
bowl. I have 2 questions concerning that: I`m using a "Dr Plumb" pipe. Is
that necessary in order to have a "better" smoke? -and second, do i need to
clean the bowl (i.e to through out all the tobacco left in it) after every
smoke, and leave the so called "cake"?

3. You also mentioned a rhythmical smoking of the pipe. How can that be
obtained?

I`m very sorry for all the trouble i cause, but it means a lot to me.

Thank you in advance,

Joe Sartre.

[ (1) By "all the way down," I meant "all the way down to the bottom
of the bowl." (2) The cake is necessary to avoid burning the wood of
the pipe as you smoke.  But if the pipe was advertised as "needs no
breaking in", it was probably pre-carbonized, and thus you don't have
to build up a cake.  The cake can only be removed by scraping the
walls of the bowl; don't worry about losing it when you empty the
pipe. (3) You're in an orchestra and you're asking _me_ about rhythm?
:-) Seriously, though, assuming that you've packed and lit it
correctly: if it gets too hot to hold, or burns your tongue, puff
slower.  If it goes out a lot, puff faster.  Hope this helps! -S. ]

Subject: PD Submission/Nordings

Steve, 
I visited a tobacco shop last week that had Nordings along with Erick's 
(or Erica's, sorry not sure) and the owner said they were "the same as 
Nordings," i.e., produced by the same company, just a different name. Is 
this correct? What are the differences? All were priced at $95.00. Is 
this high, low or competitive? I'm a relatively new subscriber 
so I apologize in advance if this is something already hashed over in the 
digest. Keep up the good work! PD is a pleasure I look forward to always.
Best Regards, J.M.

Subject: pipes irc room

Hi,I had not talked to you before. I am not a pipe smoker but have been
interested in them quite awhile. I have been chatting with a group on irc
on the pipes room. I think someone said they saw you there once.  I would
like to chat with you sometime,and i know the others would too. I do read
some of the things on the pipes digest site and the newsgroup. I know mark
tinsky has been on once. I asked him if he would like to chat also. It is
on irc.dal.net,6667 on the room named pipes. The group usually comes on
after 10 pm, some nights are slower than other. The usual big chat is sat
night. I am one of the ops but VicVixvi,his nickname on there, is the
creator of the room. Hope to see you there if you are not too busy. I
always like chatting with new people. Rich.

[ Thanks, Rich!  Haven't been on the pipes channel, but I was on the
cigars channel once, many years ago. One of these days I'll reinstall
irc and get on. -S. ]

Subject: Newbie

Steve,

Thank you for the intro... what a great publication!  After 20 zillion
cigarettes, (I recall smoking only 3) I finally started *tasting*
tobacco, with a Ben Wade Regent.  Wow!  I live in L.A., and have been
frequenting the Wilshire Ave. Tinder Box store.  Presently, going
through the process of trying an ounce of 'this or that'.
 
 I really enjoy the English blends, particularly "Baker Street Full".
Like searching for a full bodied coffee, or a fine bourbon, or cigar,
I'm sure this will take time.  Would you please direct me to some of
the 'Pipe Clubs' in L.A.?

-Billy

[ To find an L.A. pipe club, your best bet would probably be to mail
Steve Johnson, ????????@???.???. -S. ]

  I am looking for recommendations for a cigar friendly restaraunt in San 
Diego, CA. and hoping that one of your many readers can e-mail me a swift 
response from the anti-tobacco state....

[ I have Liberty Tobacco in Digest #174, but that's not a restaurant.
But maybe they could help; their number is (619) 292-1772. Any others? -S. ]

Subject: help with my calabash

Howdy!

     I was wondering if anyone in pipe land could help me with my 
calabash delima?  I have a giant calabash pipe that I received as a gift 
when I was a rookie pipe smoker.  While I was attempting to master the 
fine art of pipe smoking I had put sever scorch marks on the meershaum on 
top of the bowl.  Can anyone please tell me if and how these scorches can 
be removed from my prize possession?

Subject: letter from a new member 

Steve,

     I have just recently subscribed and read the PD you mailed. I found it
very interesting. One observation I made is there do not seem to be a large
percentage of cigar smokers contributing to the Digest. Is that typical or
are most of the members pipe smokers as opposed to cigar smokers? Also, do
you have any information concerning cigar clubs?
     As a matter of information for your cigar smokers, several of us have
started making a cigar friendly bar a regular after work meeting place on
Thursdays. It is the Paisley Pineapple in Greensboro, NC. It is on the second
floor above the restaurant and has a nice decor and is furnished with sofas
and easy chairs. The owner keeps a table-top humidor stocked or you can bring
your own. For subscribers who live in the area it is located in the 300 block
of S. Elm St.
     I am new to AOL and I look forward to receiving and contributing to the
digest.

                                               Keep on puffin'
                                               Randy Carroll (RCCIGAR)
                                               High Point, NC

[ Well, Randy, it all depends on what the members post here.  We have,
I'm sure, hundreds members who smoke cigars, exclusively, primarily,
or occasionally.  Same with pipes, etc.

The Guide does list a bunch of cigar clubs; new ones are always
welcomed.  I'll put the Paisley Pineapple in. Thanks for the note! -S. ]

Subject: pipedigest

Steve
Thanks for enrolling me. I have a couple of questions/inquiries that
hopefully generate some responses. 1. I have a particular interest in
Charatans -usuallly large at least, freehand and/unusual shapes and GBD
Uniques. Anyone that has any available, let me know. 2. A particular
request for two Charatans that I parted with maybe 3-4 years ago that I
would like to get back-probably very little chance. But just in case,
these two were sold for me at Barcays in Columbus, Ohio and were both
large/extra large executives freehand. The 1st was straight, "broken
top"bowl style and unstained with typical slanting bowl and "flowers like
" at base of bowl, 2nd a full bend ,"broken topSTyle" bowl. 3. How do I
join pipe Club of London and pay here in US?
Thanks.

John

[ From the Guide, the Pipe Club of London is at 9 Frances Street
Chesham Buckinghamshire HP5 3EQ, Great Britain. See Pipes Digest
#192. -S. ]

Another milestone in the Digest's history: we're now _well_ ahead of
the 2000-member mark, and still growing!  Thanks to all who've made
the Digest the colossal behemoth juggernaut it is today! :-)

And speaking of (possible) colossal behemoth juggernauts...

[ASTRONOMY] I know that many members are forced to smoke outside (and
indeed, in the next century, we may be the only people who still _go_
outside at all.)  So why not make the best of it?  While you're
outdoors, watch for a new comet, named Hyakutake, which is scheduled
to appear very bright and large in the evening skies later this month.
Who knows, it may make up for Kohoutek, Halley, et. al.!  You can
learn more about it on the Web page:

	<a href="http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/comet/hyakutake/">http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/comet/hyakutake/</a>

Lest you think this is too far off topic, also check out "The Stars: A
New Way To See Them" by H.A. Rey.  The constellation Bootes
(Herdsman), which is visible in the Northern Hemisphere sky now, is
depicted sitting and smoking a pipe.  As Rey says, it's "a sensible
thing for a herdsman to do."  And a fun read!

[PROHIBITIONS] And, if you thought the anti-tobacco jihad was bad, you
ain't seen nothing yet!  Even more scandalous is the suspectedly
Illuminati-run Committee to Ban Dihydrogen Monoxide:

	<a href="http://www.circus.com/~no_dhmo/">http://www.circus.com/~no_dhmo/</a>

But, while you still can, why not join us with a smoke and a glass of
vintage dihydrogen monoxide, as we search for stray comets...

&gt; The only question is, how badly did I get ripped off by buying a Ser
&gt; Jacopo Delecta with silver band and spigot for 360$ (1,690,000 rubles,
&gt; for anyone who follows Russia)? What is the going price for such a
&gt; pipe in the US or Europe?

And I had asked whether it was new or estate. -S.]

The pipe in question was new. The same price is charged for a Peterson
straight grain w/ silver spigot.

Smoke Signal #21
?????@???.???.???

Saturday, 24 June 1876, General George Armstrong Custer
arrived at the confluence of the Big Horn and Little Big Horn
rivers in the Montana Territory. Custer was leading the vanguard
of troops under command of General Terry; the main body was due
to join Custer on the 26th. Intelligence reports spoke of the
presence of a small force of Indians, to which Custer responded
by divided his command into three parties that moved forward, on
the 25th, to encircle the enemy. Surprised by a force much larger
than expected, Custer led the two hundred and twenty-six men of
the center column into the thick of battle. Custer, the Little
Big Horn, and the rest are history. They knew news of victory in
Indian communities in all directions, long before it reached the
ears of the European settlers. Indians of the plains used the
smoke signal to exchange messages across long distances, a series
of long and short puffs. On a clear day they could hear for
miles.

Friday, 10 November 1995, was a clear day; one of those days
on the Southern Plains typical for its bright light, clear skies
of pale blue, cool still air, and winter vegetation of sepia
tinted hues similar to the colors used on the Dunhill Christmas
card; a day on which Smoke Signal Nineteen rose into the vault
above, its message read and understood by David Webb,
representative for Alfred Dunhill Pipes Limited in London. Mr.
Webb sent me E-mail to let me know that Dunhill now owns Parker
and that we can have pipe cleaners direct from Dunhill in London.
Sometime later, the noon stagecoach brought me a packet of fifty
cleaners, accompanied by a Christmas card from Mr. Webb for
Dunhill, and a request that I confirm they still work as they
always have. Here is my assessment of Parker's Conical Pipes
Cleaners as made in England today.

Upon inspection, the Parker cleaner of today is clearly a
fraction of an inch longer than the cleaner of old. I am in the
happy situation of directly comparing old and new. The nap of the
old cleaner is of slightly better quality, it is a trifle denser;
the nap on the new cleaner is not quite as tightly bound. I can
say that the new cleaner has the required stiffness of character
to pass the steck-test in triumph. Overall, Parker's Conical Pipe
Cleaners continue to clean as they did, although I would like to
see a return to the restful nap of old. I have some of these old
cleaners that I will be glad to send to Mr. Webb, so that he can
see for himself.

A footnote: In Digest #211, Mr. De Luca reported having a Parker
pipe with a broken stem. Dunhill own Parkers and should, therefore,
be capable of making repairs to these pipes.

Andrew,
?????@???.???.???

[ A smoke signal that's news we can use, Andrew! Thanks! -S. ]

Subject: trip report

Steve and all,

        well, i'm sitting in DaVinci, the Rome airport.  it's six in the
morning, and i didn't end up spending the night on a bench here, as i've
done before, but that's telling the end of story before the beginning.

        i'm on a two-week trip visiting Italy and India for a conference and
some HP work.  recently, Enzo Medici created a cool personal pipe-smoking
page at <a href="http://www.flashnet.it/medici/">http://www.flashnet.it/medici/</a>  we did a little corresponding, and
he graciously invited me to stop by if i was ever in Roma.  well, little did
he know that i had a trip planned in the next two weeks :-)  so, we met each
other in the airport one Sunday and he and his wonderful daughter and wife
took me to a great lunch and showed me around Roma a little.  i saw where
"Il Circolo della Pipa" (<a href="http://www.flashnet.it/medici/pipeclub.htm),">http://www.flashnet.it/medici/pipeclub.htm),</a> the
Roma pipe club meets.  they have their own building!  i took a picture or
two of it, i may scan one of them in for the pipes page...  Enzo gave me a
copy of the Italian magazine "Smoking".  it's helped me with my rusty
Italian :-)  on the cover there are three beautiful pipes shown, a Dunhill,
a Savinelli, and the actual Castello that Enzo was smoking when he met me in
the airport.  235 of them were made and it's a nice pipe.  speaking of nice
pipes, Enzo has more than a few.  Dunhills, Ser Jacapos, Savinellis; you get
the idea...  beautiful, one and all.

        the president of Circolo della Pipa is Fausto Fincato and Enzo
maintains that he has the best pipe shop in Roma.  Fincato is already in the
resource guide, and Enzo would know the best.

        the food was great, the company was better (Enzo and his daughter
Annalisa speak wonderful English, much better than my Italiano).  Enzo then
gave me a pipe.  not just any pipe.  one that had been made especially for
him (his initials are on it).  unsmoked.  straight grained.  beautiful.  i
was beyond words, and truth is, still am.  i will always cherish this pipe.
i'll take some pictures of it and put them on the web page too.

        Enzo has a nice web page and a nice setup at home.  fast computer,
and a bigger monitor than i have :-)  he was very humble (umile, a new
Italiano word for me) about all that he did for me.  they put me on a train
for Napoli a very happy camper.  i was on the island of Ischia for five
days.  had a great La Gloria Cubana cigar while there.  paradise...  warm,
beautiful, and a good cigar to help commemorate the event.  gotta find a
place to get more of those cigars...  like i'm the only person looking...
had an A.F. short story two years ago on Ischia: it's good to take great
cigars for moments like those.

        back to reality.  i took the train back to Roma whereupon i missed
my flight to Delhi.  it was evening, there were no more planes for India
that night, and all the hotels were full :-(  could have been major sadness
if i hadn't had Enzo's cellular phone number.  i called him asking for help
in finding a place to stay for the night, and he insisted i stay with him.
the beautiful Annalisa gave up her room for the weary traveler, we had
another great meal, and i slept like a baby...  Enzo took me to the airport
early in the morning as the trains don't run that early (we're spoiled by
all the flights and transportation here in the States...)

        nothing to report from India.  not a big pipe-smoking place it appears.

        so the upshot of this rambling tome is: i am once again amazed how
nice pipe smokers can be.  i have memories from this trip that will last a
lifetime.  a public thanks to Enzo and his family.  i look forward to being
able to repay their kindness when they visit me!

        i'll be near Melbourne Australia the week of June 10; if anybody
wants to get together for a quick bowl, drop me a line!

        ciao!

[ Later... -S. ]

Steve and all,

        i've been playing with the web page some more.  i've added links at
the top to indices that don't have either the smoke trail background (for
those with monochrome monitors) or tables (for users with the AOL or older
Microsoft viewers).  also at the top are links to the major subsections of
the page.  i've also added a change of address form for updating the mailing
list when an email address changes.

        thanks,

Steve Beaty                                               ?????@??.??.???

award-winning Web site! -S. ]

Hello Fellow Smokers,

      I thoroughly enjoy my news letter, and have not written but as of late.
 I want to thank all of you for helping me enjoy my hobby to it's fullest.
 Although I am predominantly a gigar afficianado, I do dabble in the pipe
art.
      I would like to announce the newest addition to my town.  The soon to
open club is called the "Havana Club".  Amongst its inventory there is a wall
sized mural of the tobacco fields of the far south.  I was pleased to see
this classy joint opening up within walking distance of my home.  It is in
the town of Matawan, NJ.  I wish the owners well.
   On another note, I myself am looking for a humidor, and I do not care
about looks, I would prefer an antique, of high quality and affordable price.
 E me if anyone has one to part with.

Happy Smoking with Regards,
Joe

<H1>Message from the <br>Regional Director</H1>
<hr>
</center>

A wave of change has broken over the European Region of the World Health Organization (WHO), transforming the social, political and economic landscape. The most important feature of this landscape for health is the deep and widening gap between the eastern and western halves of the Region. Nevertheless, the recent work of the WHO Regional Office for Europe (WHO/Europe) shows that the European policy for health for all, with its 38 targets, offers the best way to meet the health challenges of both the old Europe and the new.
<p>
The policys enduring value lies in its comprehensive approach to health, its firm fundamental principles, and the flexibility of their application. This means that the WHO Regional Office for Europe pursues a wide variety of goals in all areas relevant to health - including lifestyles, the environment and health services - with any combination of methods and partners that suits the circumstances. The principles of health for all harmonize these efforts, while the policy itself unites them.
<p>
Two of the policys principles are participation in decision-making by everyone concerned, and intersectoral and international cooperation. Health for all expresses WHOs recognition that health is everybodys business and that cooperation maximizes the effectiveness of all the partners in the task. WHO/Europe seeks constantly to widen its networks of partners and ways of working with them. The World Wide Web is an important tool in this work. It offers fast, efficient means through which WHO/Europe can share information and contacts, and thus widen and strengthen the alliance for health for all.

<H2>The Verona Initiative to Provide New Arena for Health Debate
</H2>


The Fondazione Incontri Madruzzo (Italy), the City of Verona and
the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe
have announced plans jointly to launch a new European arena for
innovative debate on the measures that can produce health and
wellbeing. This so-called Verona initiative will provide mechanisms
for clarifying policy options aimed at creating and sustaining
health and recommend actions based on solid evidence of their
potential benefits.
<P>
&quot;Throughout Europe decision makers on all levels in both
public and private sectors are searching for ways to maximize
the social and economic impact of limited developmental resources,&quot;
noted Dr. Marc Danzon, Director of Health Promotion and Disease
Prevention for the WHO Regional Office for Europe, speaking to
decision-makers from government and industry gathered at the Fondazione
Incontri di Madruzzo project launch in Verona. &quot;While much
experience and knowledge exist, lessons learned are not effectively
being disseminated and integrated into practice.&quot;
<P>
The Verona initiative aims to address this challenge by:
<UL>
<LI>commissioning some of the world's best economic and social
thinkers to review key trends and actions affecting health and
to draw conclusions about what appears to be working and what
is not;
<LI>convening the experts to report and debate their findings
in a series of symposia over the next four years; and
<LI>utilizing print and telecommunications widely to publicize
and disseminate the outcomes and recommendations of these debates.

</UL>


&quot;Verona will be the stage, the whole of Europe will be the
audience.&quot; declared Erio Ziglio, WHO Regional Adviser for
Health Promotion and Investment. &quot;Good work alone is not
enough. The Verona initiative will provide both a scientific and
ethical platform for communicating information essential to public
health creation as we enter the new millennium.&quot;

<H2>Investment for Health in Poland <BR>
Overcoming the Obstacles to Collaborative Action </H2>

<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe
will convene top-level national and regional policy-makers from
Poland's key health-creating sectors: housing, education, health
and social services in Warsaw on 12-14 December. An action learning
workshop will be held that will focus on managing change and innovation
in health promotion. In collaboration with the Health Promotion
Department of Poland's National Institute of Cardiology and under
the auspices of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, this
gathering will for the first time bring together leaders from
different sectors to explore common strategies to invest scarce
resources to produce the most benefit to health.
<P>
&quot;This important workshop aims to catalyse a process to remove
obstacles to effective collaborative action,&quot; notes Erio
Ziglio WHO Regional Adviser Health Promotion and Investment. &quot;Many
of the determinants of health - such as environmental factors
or lifestyles - are themselves multicausal. This means that no
sector or agency can control all the factors that are involved
in promoting health. Innovative collaborative approaches are required.&quot;
<P>
The WHO Investment for Health team has assisted decision-makers
in municipalities and regions throughout Europe to draw upon their
and others' experience with identifying ways to overcome barriers
to effective collaborative action.
<P>
&quot;We have found that health can serve as a very useful common
ground for resolving priority conflicts between competing sectors,&quot;
notes Professor Alfred Rutten, Director of the Regional Centre
for Health Promotion, University of Chemnitz-Zwickau, Germany.
&quot;In our region of West Saxony a multisectoral investment
for health strategy is transforming severe economic, social and
ecological problems into sustainable strengths for future development.&quot;

<P>
&quot;By identifying practical organizational and managerial tools
and interventions to support change and innovation within the
Polish context,&quot; notes Professor Lowell Levin, a professor
at the School of Public Health, Yale University, USA and one of
the WHO experts coordinating the Warsaw workshop, &quot;we expect
the participants to overcome traditional obstacles to cooperation
and enhance their capacities to contribute not only to improved
health but also to their country's social and economic development.&quot;
<H3>Obstacles to collaborative action</H3>

<P>
Obstacles to collaborative action include:
<UL>
<LI>lack of understanding about the benefits that might be achieved;
<LI>territorialism - organizations and decision-makers guarding
their area of expertise and responsibility against perceived &quot;threats
of invasion&quot;, loss of prestige and power, etc.;
<LI>competition for limited financial resources;
<LI>inflexibility in the formal budget-setting process;
<LI>rules and regulations governing what can and can not be done
by an individual sector;
<LI>insecurity about the implications of change;
<LI>lack of trust between individuals and departments;
<LI>clashes in organizational culture and working practices;
<LI>organizational cultures that discourage creative thinking
and risk taking;
<LI>differences in power, status and influence;
<LI>hidden agendas - personal as well as departmental;
<LI>concern about blurring of responsibilities;
<LI>career structures that do not recognize or reward intersectoral
work;
<LI>rapid changes in organizations and politics and turnover of
people, which hinder continuity; 
<LI>data systems that focus on single sectors and communication
processes that inhibit cross-sectoral work.

<P>
Since September 1992, the World Health Organization (WHO) through
its Regional Office for Europe, has been providing humanitarian
assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). After more than
three years of nonpartisan work on and behind the battle lines,
many lessons have been learned about preserving and promoting
public health in war conditions. WHO's 1995 report describes how
this coordinated public health response has saved lives, reduced
suffering, and supported and developed local capacities for action,
and how it now provides a platform for reconstruction and development.

<HR>

<P>
Mostar Bridge, January 1996.<BR>
As all the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) begin to
cross the bridge to peace, WHO will continue to work on all sides
for the improvement of the health situation, the re-establishment
of personal, professional, and political connections and networks,
reconciliation and the substantiation of the peace.<BR>
<BR clear=left>

<P>
This report is dedicated to the memory of all the health workers
in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) who lost their lives in this
terrible war and to the many doctors, nurses and other health
professionals with whom WHO has worked over the past four years
to preserve and promote health in the most difficult of conditions.

<H2>WHO European Information Service <BR>on Medical Supplies
(ISMS)
</H2>
<HR>
</center>

The Information Service for Medical Supplies (ISMS) produces quarterly
updated reports on the current situation of medical needs and
supplies in the newly independent states (NIS). Information selected
from the latest reports on vaccines, life-saving drugs and basic
medical equipment in the NIS is presented:

The establishment of the WHO European Information Service on Medical
Supplies (ISMS) originates in the conclusions of the meeting of
the Medical Working Group of the Coordinating Conference on Assistance
to the Newly Independent States, in Washington, DC, on 22-23 January,1992.
Confronted with the enormous difficulties of assessing the health
needs of these countries, the group gave a mandate to WHO to create
a centre to provide up-to-date information on specific health
needs to potential donors. This mandate was confirmed at the Second
Coordinating Conference in Lisbon on 23-24 May 1992. <BR>
<BR>
Following this decision, WHO created a clearing-house whose task
was to collect, process and distribute a broad range of health-related
information and data in connection with the health status and
needs of the populations of NIS. Given the immediate priorities
that needed to be addressed first and foremost, as a result of
the breakdown of supplies of all kinds in these countries, the
format of the clearing-house was reviewed and its objectives were
adjusted. Subsequently, ISMS was incorporated into the EUROHEALTH
programme and put under the responsibility of the Country Health
Development Department in WHO/Europe. On this basis, top priority
has been given to identifying the short-term availability of essential
medical supplies in the form of vaccines, pharmaceutical products
and basic medical equipment in the NIS and the Baltic States.


<P>
The choice of vaccines is based on the WHO Expanded Programme
on Immunization (EPI) routine, which includes the following: OPV,
DPT, BCG and measles vaccine. As regards pharmaceutical products,
a list of life-saving drugs has been drawn up by WHO/Europe for
which each interested country is requested to indicate its level
of needs and supplies. ISMS issues the following hard-copy quarterly
reports on medical needs for vaccines and life-saving drugs in
the NIS:


<UL>
<LI>summary overview report on vaccine needs and supplies in the
NIS (updated quarterly).

<LI>summary overview report on life-saving drugs needs in the
NIS (updated quarterly).

<LI>country quarterly reports on the status of needs for and supplies
of vaccines and life-saving drugs. (These reports contain a wealth
of information on projections of needs, production where applicable,
purchases and donations delivered in the previous quarter. They
also contain information on planned imports and donations in the
next quarter).

<H1><a name="P01">Alarming upsurge of syphilis in the newly independent
states</A></H1>


Recent data on sexually transmitted diseases reported from the
countries of central and eastern Europe (CCEE) and the newly independent
states (NIS) indicate a dramatic upsurge of sexually transmitted
diseases (STDs), especially in some NIS. The data on syphilis
are particularly alarming (see Table 1) and they are strong indicators
of a general trend towards a rise in STDs. Available data also
demonstrate an increase in notified cases of gonorrhoea, though
less pronounced than that for syphilis. Most syphilis cases are
likely to be treated in the public sector and are therefore duly
notified. For gonorrhoea, underreporting may be greater, since
there appears to be a rapid rise in the proportion of individuals
seeking private care or treating themselves to avoid the rigid regime of the state services.

<P>
A WHO mission to Moscow in December 1995 assessed the current
situation with regard to the epidemiology, surveillance and control
of syphilis and gonorrhoea in the Russian Federation and recommended
priority action for control. The WHO team found evidence of the
occurrence of substantial epidemics of both gonorrhoea and syphilis.
Syphilis has increased forty-fold between 1988 and 1995, in particular
among younger people. The epidemic has not yet peaked, and substantial
efforts are required to reduce incidence.

</TABLE>

a 1995 data<p>

The epidemics appear to have been triggered by factors related
to the process of rapid social change and economic transition,
in particular:
<UL>
<LI>changes in sexual behaviour (travel and migration, a growing
sex industry, and ideological changes in terms of more liberal
attitudes to sex);
<LI>reduced quality in some parts of the state health care services,
and the emergence of not yet fully developed private services;
and
<LI>the need to improve primary prevention and sexual health promotion.

</UL>




In addition to the significant morbidity and human suffering associated
with acute infection, and the sequelae of long-term infection,
the epidemics may pave the way for rapidly increasing rates of
HIV transmission, reaching levels far greater than those encountered
in western European countries. There are three reasons for this:
<UL>
<LI>the upsurge of STDs points to changes in sexual behaviour
that will facilitate HIV transmission;
<LI>the very high syphilis incidence must be associated with a
significant prevalence of genital ulcer disease (GUD), facilitating
transmission of HIV; and
<LI>contact is increasing between the Russian Federation and areas
with high HIV prevalence.
</UL>




The WHO team pointed out that the epidemics of syphilis and gonorrhoea
in the Russian Federation and parallel epidemics in other CCEE
and NIS have major implications for Europe as a whole. Western
European countries are already seeing increases in syphilis cases
related to the CCEE and NIS.

<P>
The WHO Regional Office for Europe and the United Nations Programme
on AIDS (UNAIDS) are jointly planning a series of actions to address
the problem. As a first step a meeting of experts from the most
seriously affected countries is planned. The aim of the meeting
is to develop national action plans.

<H1><a name="P02">Coming soon?</A> Polio-free Europe!</H1>

<H2>The situation </H2>


In 1995, 205 cases of poliomyelitis were reported to the WHO Regional
Office for Europe. Of the total, 146 cases occurred during the
outbreak of poliomyelitis in Chechnya, Russian Federation, from
June to November 1995. For the first time in the history of polio
in Europe, the number of countries reporting endemic cases of
polio has been reduced to only 9. Another very important development
is that the number of territories with endemic poliomyelitis was
reduced by 48% from 1994 to 1995. Consequently, only few &quot;hot
spots&quot; of polio remain in Europe.

<p>
<img src="cd1101.gif">




<H2>Operation MECACAR</H2>


In total, more than 60 million children have been immunized during
Operation MECACAR 1995 (mass vaccination with oral poliomyelitis
vaccine in the Mediterranean, Caucasian and central Asian republics).
The progress of polio eradication in Europe through Operation
MECACAR can be described as follows.
<UL>
<LI>In 1994, 201 (95%) of a total of 215 cases of poliomyelitis
reported in Europe were from countries involved in Operation MECACAR.
<LI>In 1995, only 49 (24%) of a total of 205 cases of poliomyelitis
reported in Europe were from MECACAR countries.
<LI>After the second round of MECACAR in June-August 1995, only
17 cases of poliomyelitis were reported from June to December
1995 from MECACAR countries in Europe, while 159 cases were reported
during the same period in 1994.
</UL>




The broader political and public health implications of the Operation
- in terms of alliance building at all levels, increased political
commitment and support for health, and capacity building at local
and national level - are equally significant.
<H2>Perspectives for 1996 </H2>

<P>
Strongly encouraged by the WHO Regional Office for Europe, the
health ministry of the Russian Federation has taken significant
steps to achieve the target of polio eradication. Two rounds of
national immunization days in 1996 are in preparation and the
activities will be coordinated with Operation MECACAR. Romania
is preparing local immunization days covering 22 districts, and
national Immunization Days will be organized in Albania in April
and May 1996. To achieve the target of making Europe free of polio
by the end of 1997, implementation of the mass vaccination strategy
in the Kosovo region of the territory of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) is urgently required in
1996. Activities to improve surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis
in many countries of Europe will have a high priority. This effort
will require a strengthening of the regional laboratory network
(LABNET) and its performance. Finally, the first meeting of the
European Regional Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis
Eradication took place in Paris, on 7-8 March 1996. The purpose
of the meeting was to define the terms of reference for the Commission,
to discuss and propose the process of certification for the Member
States of the European Region, and to formulate the main activities
to be included in the plan of action of the Commission.

<H1><a name="P03">Diphtheria in the NIS</A></H1>

<H2>The diphtheria situation</H2>


In 1995, a total of 50,464 cases of diphtheria were reported from
Member States to the WHO Regional Office for Europe, compared
to a total of 47,261 cases in 1994. It was originally estimated
that more than 100,000 cases of diphtheria would occur in 1995,
if drastic disease control measures were not applied.
<P>
The following updates from the Russian Federation
and the Republic of Moldova are given, with graphs illustrating
the monthly number of cases of diphtheria in 1994 and 1995.

<H3>Russian Federation</H3>


As a result of widespread immunization during the last year, the
incidence of diphtheria in the second half of 1995 appears to
be 100% lower than during the same period in 1994. The authorities
have made huge efforts, and over the course of the past few years,
nearly 70 million adults have been vaccinated against diphtheria
(65% of the entire adult population).
<p>
<img src="cd1102.gif">




<H3>Republic of Moldova</H3>


The national diphtheria control campaign, based on the WHO/United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) strategy, started in June 1995.
The diphtheria epidemic in the Republic of Moldova is showing
signs of retreat. Reported cases for the last three months show
a sharp reduction, despite the season of high transmission. The
highest coverage was achieved in the group aged 7 to 15 years,
corresponding closely to the age group with the highest incidence
and number of deaths due to diphtheria. The average coverage of
the population since 1 January 1994 has increased to 68.4%, even
if the campaigns only had an impact since 1 June 1995. 
<p>

<img src="cd1103.gif">

A nation-wide
campaign (versus
campaigns for geographical areas or high-risk occupational groups)
may be a factor explaining the difference in incidence between
Republic of Moldova and neighbouring Ukraine. Another factor may
be that antibiotics for the prophylactic treatment of primary
contacts were provided and used widely for the first time in November
1995. Antibiotic use is reported to have increased from 8.5% of
contacts in 1994 to 44.5% in 1995.

<H2>Diphtheria control activities in the other NIS</H2>


Nine months after the launch of the Public Health Diphtheria Control
Emergency Appeal, the contributions of donors and particularly
the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) and the U.S.
Agency for International Development (USAID), have enabled most
NIS to set up national diphtheria control programmes based on
the WHO/UNICEF strategy. Thanks to vaccines and other medical
supplies received, large-scale mass immunization campaigns have
been initiated. The needs of a first group of countries have almost
entirely been met: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, the Republic
of Moldova, Ukraine and the Baltic states. A second group of countries,
including Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, have received contributions
to cover part of their needs. The last group of countries, including
Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, have not yet received
contributions. Some countries allocated much of their own funds
for diphtheria control, particularly  Belarus, Kazakhstan and
Uzbekistan.

<P>
The first Workshop on Laboratory Diagnosis of Diphtheria was organized
jointly by WHO Regional Office for Europe and the Public Health
Laboratory Service/WHO Diphtheria Reference Centre (PHLS) in London,
on 14 to 16 November 1995. It was attended by key microbiologists
from 12 NIS. The main objectives were to introduce the diphtheria
laboratory kit, to identify key personnel, to identify problems
within laboratory diagnostics for diphtheria and to exchange experiences.
The participants are now able to hold similar workshops in their
own countries, using the components and materials of the diphtheria
laboratory kit. <BR>

<P>
The second Workshop took place in Vilnius, on 11 to 13 March 1996,
and brought together 14 participants from Belarus, Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania and St Petersburg, with facilitators from PHLS and the
Public Health Institute in Helsinki.
<P>
The first consignment of diphtheria laboratory diagnostic kits
has now been received in Georgia, and consignments to Armenia
and Ukraine are being shipped from PHLS, in London. The dispatch
of kits to Azerbaijan and Tajikistan is next in line.

<H2>Country diphtheria activity update</H2>

<H3>Ukraine</H3>


Ukraine's mass immunization campaign was launched in April 1995
with a grant from ECHO through the Finnish Red Cross. A first
round of immunizations occurred in April; a second round in June/July;
and a third round in September/October. Regions will continue
mass campaigns or mop-up activities in 1996 with vaccines provided
by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH)/USAID
and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies (IFRC).

<H3>Belarus</H3>


The health ministry began more intensive immunization activities
with the arrival of additional vaccine supplies in 1995. The 1995
diphtheria control strategy focused on reaching the highest level
possible of persons under 16 years of age and target groups of
adults. It is believed that very high immunity levels now exist
in the population under 17 years of age and that high coverage
has been achieved in the 1995 target groups of adults.

<H3>Turkmenistan</H3>


A mass immunization campaign of the population 4 to 40 years of
age was conducted on 15 to 20 January 1996, made possible by a
government allocation of US$&nbsp;2 211 000.

<H3>Uzbekistan</H3>


Planning of logistics and supplies for a mass immunization campaign
is progressing. The government has allocated much of its own funds,
but has not received any external funds so far.



<H1><a name="P04">Bacterial meningitis in Europe</A></H1>

<P>
<I>The following information is an excerpt from the report</I>
Surveillance of Bacterial Meningitis in Europe 1994, <I>issued
in December 1995 by Marian Conolly and Professor Norman Noah from
the Department of Public Health and Epidemiology, King's College
School of Medicine and Dentistry in London, United Kingdom.
</I>
<P>
The incidence of meningococcal disease in Europe has remained
fairly stable over the past year although there was some variation
in trends within countries. There appears to be an increase in
incidence from south to north, although it is important to take
into consideration the completeness of case ascertainment in many
northern European countries. There is a seasonal distribution
of cases with peaks in the winter months.

<P>
Meningococcal disease mainly attacked the young. Nearly 80% of
cases were under 20 years of age, with the highest incidence in
those aged 4 years of age and under. There was a disproportionate
number of cases amongst males, with 51% overall for 1994 and 58%
under 20 years of age. Overall the case fatality rate was 7.6
with a higher rate for septicaemia (9.6). Adults were more likely
to die than children with the case fatality rate reaching over
25% in the elderly. As in 1993 an excess of cases of septicaemia
was detected in the 1 to 4 year old age group and also for over
65's in 1994.
<P>
Serogroup B predominated except in the Czech Republic where the
highest percentage of cases were group C:2a. A significant proportion
of cases in the Moscow area were group A. There appeared to be
some variation in age distribution for each serogroup. The serotype
and serosubtype information has proved to be particularly difficult
to analyse.

<P>
The genetic and evolutionary relationships between serotypes and
serosubtypes are not clear, and a coherent picture of spread within
and across Europe does not merge from the present data collected.


<P>
Nearly half of the strains tested were resistant to sulphonamides
and less than 10% were resistant to penicillin although there
was some variation between countries. The epidemic of group C:2a
disease continues in the Czech Republic. Otherwise fairly small
and minor outbreaks were reported.

<P>
The incidence of <I>Haemophilius influenzae</I> meningitis was
about a quarter of the incidence of meningococcal disease, mainly
affecting the 1 to 4 year old age group.

<P>
The incidence of pneumococcal meningitis is less than half of
<I>Neisseria meningitidis</I>. It affects mainly older adults
and the elderly and also pre-school children.

<P>
<I>In their concluding remarks, the editors stress that bacterial
meningitis continues to present a major health problem. The collection
and dissemination of information about the disease is a key element
in ensuring its early recognition and prompt treatment. This report
contributes greatly to the understanding of the disease and its
eventual control. For copies of the report, please contact the

Social and economic hardship and the displacement of hundreds
of thousands of people after the hostilities between Azerbaijan
and Armenia contributed greatly to the worsening of the malaria
situation. Reported cases rose from 110 in 1991 to at least 2802
cases (<I>Plasmodiam vivax</I>) in 1995. The actual number is
considerably higher, since case detection activities have been
strongly reduced. Cases are found mainly in the southern regions
and in refugee camps around Baku. Although the political situation
has improved, the health ministry still has great problems in
mounting effective epidemic control operations. Experienced staff
are available, but there are neither drugs nor insecticides. About
4000 to 5000 cases are expected to occur in 1996.
<P>
<B>Action.</B>  A WHO assessment visit in March 1996, organized
by the WHO Regional Office for Europe, will develop an action
plan for malaria control.
<H3>Tajikistan</H3>


At least 10 000 cases occurred in 1995, mainly <I>P. vivax</I>;
11 cases of <I>P. falciparum </I>malaria were diagnosed in 1995<I>.</I>
No resistance was reported. Excessive migration, including refugees
from Afghanistan, was a contributing factor. Neither drugs nor
insecticides are available, and there is no trained staff. The
possibility of a serious malaria epidemic in the southern areas
cannot be ruled out, and it may occur in an explosive way since
a great majority of the population are non-immunes. Numerous malaria
foci may occur in other vulnerable areas, and <I>P. falciparum</I>
malaria may become endemic again.
<H3>Action. Based on new data received from the health
ministry in Tajikistan, an action plan has been elaborated.
</H3>

<H3>Turkey</H3>


An assessment mission was carried out in 1995. More than 100,000
cases (<I>P. vivax</I>) were reported, mainly in south-eastern
Anatolya,  with a lower increase in the Adana region and in the
whole country (importations). New large irrigation projects in
Anatolya will cause further increase of incidence.
<P>
<B>Action.</B> Training of entomologists, communicable disease/malaria
officers and primary health care officers will start in the Adana
Malaria Centre in 1996. A project for malaria control has been
elaborated.<BR>

<H1><a name="P06">The sick child initiative:</A> Integrated case management</H1>


Worldwide, pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria, measles and malnutrition
cause more than 70% of the deaths in children under 5 years of
age. There are feasible and effective ways that health workers
in clinics can care for children with these illnesses and prevent
most of the deaths. WHO and UNICEF used updated technical findings
to describe management of these illnesses in a set of combined
guidelines, instead of separate guidelines for each illness. Furthermore,
a training package has been developed to teach the integrated
case management process to health workers who treat sick children.


<P>
Health workers are experienced in treating common childhood diseases,
but are often trained only in the use of separate, disease-specific
guidelines, such as those for malaria or diarrhoea. Thus, they
may have difficulty combining different guidelines when caring
for a sick child with several problems. They may not know which
problems are most important to treat or, with limited time and
drugs, they may not be able to identify and treat all of the problems.
There are important relationships between the illnesses. Thus,
effective case management needs to consider all of a child's symptoms.


<P>
Following the integrated case management process, health workers
can quickly consider all of a child's symptoms and determine if
a child is severely ill and needs urgent referral. If not, the
health worker can follow the guidelines to treat the child's illnesses.
The guidelines also describe counselling for mothers and other
care givers.

<P>
The case management guidelines incorporate existing WHO guidelines
for diseases (such as diarrhoeal diseases, acute respiratory infections
and malaria) and for immunization, and address most but not all
of the major reasons a child is brought to a clinic for an illness.


<P>
For more information, please contact the WHO Regional Office for
Europe.

<H1><a name="P07">Rapid government response</A> stems Ebola outbreak in Gabon</H1>


As of 29 February, a total number of 27 cases with 18 deaths was
reported from Gabon. Cases ranged in age from 7 months to 65 years
(mean 24 years); 74 of 187 contacts remain under surveillance.
All of the cases were reported to have originated in the village
of Mayibout II, located in a remote area of northern Gabon. Control
measures instituted in Gabon by the Ministry of Health and an
international medical team appear to be containing the further
spread. Sporadic secondary cases, however, can still be expected.


<P>
WHO attributes the limited spread of the outbreak in Gabon to
several key factors: One was the rapid response of the Ministry
of Health in recognizing the threat at an early stage and reacting
appropriately. Control measures included the isolation of actual
and suspected cases, which reduced the odds of secondary infection.
Another important factor was a large-scale information campaign
conducted by the government to inform the public about haemorrhagic
fever, its mode of transmission and ways to avoid infection. Finally,
in contrast to last year's epidemic in Zaire, which struck in
an urban zone, the outbreak in Gabon occurred in a rural area
with low population density, a natural advantage in limiting the
further spread of infection.

<P>
Of particular concern to investigators was the possibility of
secondary infections among health workers in the provincial hospital
of Makokou, where the Ebola patients were admitted on 5 to 6 February.
The 21-day incubation period is still in effect, but no health
workers have manifested symptoms of the disease.
<H1><a name="P08">UNAIDS</A> and the WHO Regional Office for Europe</H1>


The WHO Global Programme on AIDS (GPA), including the GPA unit
at the Regional Office, closed at the end of 1995. It has been
replaced by the new joint United Nations Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS).
Currently UNAIDS operates in Europe from its headquarters in Geneva,
and two intercountry offices in Almaty, Kazakhstan and Kiev, Ukraine.
In accordance with the role of WHO as one of six cosponsoring
agencies of UNAIDS, the WHO Regional Office for Europe has established
the post of Regional Adviser, AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases
programme (ASD). This programme is now part of the Communicable

<H2><a name="P02">Setting the scene</A></H2>
Let us imagine an emergency situation which may perhaps be slightly like the one you yourself are in:
<ul>
<li>A civil war has broken out in the province of Lactograd, Ruritania. Lactograd has a population of 2 million.
<li>International newspapers report extensive civil unrest, massive unemployment, starvation, outbreaks of hepatitis and cholera. Many deaths from diarrhoea and undernutrition are reported.
<li>Traditionally Lactograds economy has been based on mining, steel factories and heavy industry. These industries are now in a state of disrepair. Unemployment is very high and few people have enough money to survive.
<li>Lactograd was only 50% self-sufficient in their staple foods of wheat and corn flour before the war.
<li>Because Lactograd can no longer get food from neighbouring provinces food shortages are becoming more and more common.
<li>The drinking water is no longer safe. There is no electricity, and wood is scarce because the nearby mountains have been stripped of trees which are gradually cut down during the fuel crisis.  The province is completely cut off from the coast, main highways and neighbouring provinces.  All communications except for amateur radio hams have been destroyed and can not be repaired.
<li>Before the emergency everyone used the health care system, but now it is not even safe to move about.  The health care system does not have any medical supplies anyway. Health workers feel desperate.  In particular, since infant formula is not available, they feel they can do nothing for mothers with young babies who come to the clinic and tell that they have no milk or who are afraid their baby does not get enough milk from them.

<li>Luckily, a very old and wise family doctor still works in Lactograd.  He is very experienced in helping mothers deliver babies and keep them alive and healthy.  Mothers now come to him in a desperate state to ask if he has any infant formula for their babies.

<li>He surprises them by stating that no mother actually needs infant formula, and that now they have a wonderful opportunity to re-learn to breastfeed the way their foremothers always did.
<li>He reassures them that breastfeeding is the perfect way to safeguard the health of their babies during the present emergency, but, he says:
</ul>
<b>
Mothers need <I>support</I> to start, maintain or re-establish lactation!
</b>
<ul>
<li>The audience is not immediately convinced that mother's milk is best and that all mothers are able to breastfeed.  So they begin to ask the old doctor for more information.
</ul>

<HR>

<h3>Dialogue between doctor and mothers</h3>
<I>One mother says:</I>

<p><B>Bottle feeding with infant formula has been used for a long time in very rich countries, and it seems to be so scientific;  it must surely be a superior way of feeding my baby?</B>

<I>The old doctor reassures her:</I><P>
Infant formula is only a crude imitation of breast milk, made from cow's milk.  It was actually very unsafe for babies until the 1920's.  Doctors then knew little about the many wonderful properties of human milk, since no-one had studied these.  Soon commercial companies saw that infant formula was a product which could earn them a lot of money, since parents always are willing to spend money on what they think is the best for their babies.  Inevitably the infant formula manufacturers began to sell these new products very actively. Unfortunately they were helped in this by doctors who believed that artificial feeding was superior to breastfeeding.  Also doctors found that it was easier for them  to advise mothers about bottle-feeding than about breastfeeding - which they had never been taught about in their medical education.<P>

<I>The mother still wonders:</I><P>

<B>The health nurse told me that just last month she was fortunate enough to have some free infant formula donated by Save the Babies in Ruritania ... I thought that was a very helpful gesture from the organization?</B><P>

<I>The old doctor states:</I><P>

Unfortunately, even if the organisation may have meant well,  the motives of the infant formula manufacturers are not so charitable.  Their aim is to open new sales possibilities and to increase their share of the very competitive baby food market.  One way to achieve this is to supply relief commodities to countries suffering an emergency.  Through getting their product on the market with the assistance of humanitarian organizations these companies gain credibility and free advertising. They get their company's brand known, in preparation for future market opportunities, especially in former socialist countries.  More often than not the products are not donated by the companies, but bought from them for donors' or even
taxpayers' money.<P>

<I>The mother has yet another question:</I><P>

<B>The health nurse told me that very few women in Lactograd have milk - even before the war </B><P>
<I>The old doctor reflects a little:</I><P>

Would you agree that most of you start to bottle-feed, not because you can not breastfeed, but because you doubt your ability to produce enough good milk for your babies?  This doubt is reinforced by friends and family who ask you if you really can breastfeed.  Unfortunately we in the health care system often are the first to undermine your confidence, by separating you from the baby soon after birth and telling you to look at the clock rather than at the baby in order to find out when it is hungry.  We doctors are indeed at fault for not really teaching each other enough about this important subject in our medical and nursing schools.<P>

When I was a young doctor, babies were usually born at home. The baby stayed with the mother after delivery and normally grandmother was there to teach her daughter breastfeeding - as she had learned from her mother.  Modern mothers do not have such support from female family members. Instead mothers like you receive advice from well-meaning, but poorly trained health workers.  Their advice may often be inappropriate,
and they may be unable to tell you a lot of things you actually need to know to succeed in breastfeeding.  Breastfeeding is, unfortunately, not something mothers instinctively know how to do.  It is an art that has to be learned.<P>

<I>Another mother also wants to comment:</I><P>

<B>My doctor told me that I was tired and nervous, and that my milk really never was enough for the baby, so bottle-feeding would be a better solution for both of us?</B><P>

<I>The old doctor answers:</I><P>
I am afraid this statement is not necessarily correct.  But as I said, health workers have not been trained in the management of lactation.  Before, when babies were born at home, there was no need for us to understand the physiology of breastfeeding.  Mothers always succeeded teaching one another without our help.  I have learned what I know from these mothers who gave birth at home, and from their female helpers.  Today, old doctors like me, who know the tricks of the trade, could surely help train others.  And some of my colleagues are, quite frankly, rather unsure of what to say to a mother who feels that she has too little
milk or sore nipples.  So, rather than risk saying something wrong, they recommend artificial feeding.  Many have been visited by infant formula company representatives who have told them how safe and good their products are.<P>

<I>One mother has another problem:</I><P>

<B>I have lost weight, and I am not eating well.  I am sure I will not have enough milk for my
baby.</B><P>

<I>The old doctor reassures her:</I><P>

It may seem strange, but you do not need to worry. Your weight loss has very little effect on your ability to breastfeed.  There has been much research on this recently, which has shown that women's ability to produce enough milk for their babies is remarkably robust.  Experience from extreme famines has shown that you would have to be very severely undernourished before the amount of milk is affected.  In your case, the weight loss is nowhere near severe enough to affect your ability to produce milk.  The human race through the centuries has survived many wars and emergencies without infant formula! <P>

<I>This  problem preoccupies many mothers:</I><P>

<B>But we can no longer afford to buy fresh meat. Our diet consists mainly of food aid rations. Surely if we eat a diet of such poor quality we will produce milk of poor quality?</B><P>

<I>The old doctor reassures them:</I><P>
Meat is not an essential part of a healthy diet. In fact vegetarians are often healthier than those who eat a lot of meat. I agree that food aid rations are not very tasty and do become monotonous in the long run. However the rations do contain the nutrients you need, and usually pregnant and lactating women get priority for supplementary feeding. The research I told you about, from for example Gambia, Bangladesh and Sudan,  shows that breastfed babies grew normally even when mothers were chronically undernourished. <P>
<I>One mother still wonders:</I><P>

<B>My doctor told me that I am anaemic, does not this mean that my baby will be anaemic,
too?</B><P>

<I>The old doctor reassures her:</I><P>
During the nine months before your baby is born it is able to "stock up" on nutrients from your body, and these stores will last for some time after birth.  You should try to get enough food for yourself to make up for these losses for your own sake.  For this you do not need special foods.  Ordinary vegetables such as carrots and turnips, and beans, peas, potatoes <B>and, not to forget, bread!</B> are good sources of vitamins, minerals and protein.  Your body efficiently extracts these nutrients from your bloodstream into your milk.<P>

<I>One mother has a different question:</I><P>
<B>Is it true that psychological stress may dry up my milk?  I have been told this so often, and I am sure that I myself am stressed in these terrible times.</B><P>

<I>The old doctor reassures her:</I><P>
Some mothers surely feel that acute stress does affect breastfeeding.  But the effect is only temporary:  if this happens to you, do not stop breastfeeding, but put the baby to the breast even if there seems to be "no" milk.  The milk is there,  it is only temporarily inhibited.  Keep on offering the breast, and the milk will return.  Actually,  giving the breast may in itself help against stress,  since breastfeeding usually is comforting to you as well as to the baby. <P>


I have sometimes been confronted with the erroneous belief that mothers who were breastfeeding before the emergency now suddenly will need breast milk substitutes. What is vital is that you continue to breastfeed and that you reject all offers of breast milk substitutes, however well meant.  If you get infant formula anyway, drink it yourself, or mix it into the family food where it does no harm!<P>

<I>One mother starts to wonder:</I><P>
<B>Might it actually be more dangerous to feed my baby bottles during the emergency?</B><P>

<I>The old doctor confirms:</I><P>
Yes, there are indeed several specific problems with artificial feeding just now.  You never know when you and your babies may have to live in all kinds of temporary shelters where water and electricity supplies may be damaged.  There is no guarantee of safe, clean water, or even fuel for the sterilisation which is required for safe bottle-feeding.  You know that it is often difficult to get enough infant formula for your babies.  Food markets collapse, and regular supplies of formula are unreliable. Some of you are not able to afford the high price of infant formula on the market because of your low income and others lack money
altogether.<P>

The advantage of breast milk is that it provides a regular, sterile supply of the highest quality food, and it costs no money.  Your milk has the ability to help prevent diarrhoea and many other illnesses such as respiratory infections.  Bottle-fed babies, on the other hand,  are exposed to increased risk of infection, and they are not getting the protection provided by the many anti-ineffective factors in breast milk.<P>

<I>Many of the women are now beginning to be convinced:</I><P>
<B>This does seem to mean that our breast milk actually is superior to infant formula?</B><P>
<I>The old doctor reassures them:</I><P>

Yes, most definitely. Your milk is alive whereas any infant formula will be dead. Your
breastmilk contains many active ingredients which either kill the germs and bacteria which you and your babies are continually exposed to, or it hinders them from passing into your baby's body.  Also your milk contains the right type and amount of all the nutrients your baby needs, including protein.  Actually the composition of your milk changes in the course of the feed.  In the beginning of the feed your milk looks thin and bluish,  but it supplies your baby with the necessary protein, vitamins and minerals and <I>water.  </I>This means that your baby does not need extra water by bottle. During the last part of the feed,  your milk looks more creamy,  and it supplies your baby with fat and so provides extra
<I>energy.</I> <P>

<I>The mothers are now quite convinced:</I><P>

<B>We believe in what you say, and we want to breastfeed, but we still do not know how to get enough milk</B><P>

<I>The old doctor pulls out a small booklet, which looks suspiciously similar to this one, and
says:</I><P>
Why don't you read this little booklet, which describes some of the basic principles of breastfeeding, and guidelines on what to do.  If, after you have read it, you still have questions, you should ask them to a health worker who is known to be helpful, or another mother who has successfully breastfed.  Breastfeeding is mainly a confidence trick, so what you most need, is to find advisers who encourage you and who know what they are talking about.  You have to choose not to listen to those who say that "you will surely lose your milk" for one reason or another.  Remember:  All women who have given birth, will get milk. Maintaining the milk supply requires confidence and knowledge.  This booklet gives the knowledge, but the confidence you must find ways to build within yourself.  As time passes, the best
confidence-giver will be your own success.

<H1><a name="P03">How to breastfeed</A></H1>

Experience shows that women are able to continue breastfeeding even under severe and long-lasting physiological and psychological stress.  Most breastfeeding problems are due to one of the three following factors:
<UL>
<LI>restricted feeding of the baby,
<LI>poor positioning of the baby,
<LI>lack of confidence in the mother.
</UL>

All of these are easy to overcome, when you know how.  To know how, you need the facts presented in this book,  and to be aware that even more information is available, for example from WHO and UNICEF.  When you know how, you can overcome possible problems and even prevent them from happening at all!<P>

<B>The breast</B><P>
Your breast is actually a gland, which consists of 15-25 separate, branched segments (see figure below).  These are surrounded by supporting and fat tissue.  Milk-producing cells line the small, balloon-like alveoli, which are small chambers of milk clustered at the end of each branch.  Milk ducts lead from the alveoli to ever larger ducts which widen to milk stores, so-called "sinuses", just behind the opening to your nipple. <P>

<img src="nut01.gif" align=left>   <img src="nut02.gif"align=left><P>
<B>Fig. 1 The breast.  A cluster of alveoli is enlarged.</B><P>


<H3><a name="P04">Milk production</A></H3>

Your baby's suckling at the breast releases hormones from your brain,  and these regulate milk production.  The more the baby stimulates the breast and hormone release by suckling, the more milk you produce.  Also, the more milk is removed from the breast, the more is produced.  Conversely, if your babys suckling is reduced, your milk production also will be reduced. <P>

This means that if you try to restrict or regulate breastfeeding to a certain number of feeds or a limited time at the breast, the message you give to your body is to produce a restricted amount, and your baby may not get the milk it actually needs.  If instead the baby's appetite and needs are allowed to determine how often and for how long you feed,
the milk production will adjust to the baby's need.<P>

Your breast is never completely "empty" of milk.  Normally, your baby leaves some milk in the breast.  Production goes on very intensely as the baby feeds, and continues after your baby has finished feeding.  When the breast is very full of milk, and the alveoli are stretched out like little full balloons,  the production of milk slows down.<P>

The composition of your milk changes during a feed, from watery "foremilk" at the beginning to fat rich "hindmilk" at the end.  The composition and amount of milk also change during the day and over the months.<P>

<H2><a name="P05">How to meet the needs of your baby</A></H2>

<UL>
<LI>Your baby is a very special person, no two babies are alike.  Babies' needs for food vary widely.  As milk composition changes during the day and over time, so does babies' needs.  Fortunately most babies are able to regulate what they take very precisely in accordance with what they need.
<LI>Put your baby to your breast when it shows signs of hunger or discomfort, day or night, from the first day onwards.  Some days your baby may need to feed 10-12 times in a day or more.  Some days, it may only need to feed 6-8 times.
<LI>Do <I>not </I>wait for the baby to start crying before you offer the breast.
<LI>Be aware that if you give your baby a "pacifier" with a rubber nipple,  or if you keep it tightly swaddled, it may be difficult for you to see the signs babies normally make when they are hungry.  Hungry babies turn their head, wave their arms and touch their mouth with the hands, while salivating and making "sucking movements" with mouth and tongue, as if they imagine a lovely feed.  They actually have many ways of telling you about their hunger -  crying is only the last, desperate resort!
<LI>Remember that breast-milk is more easily and rapidly digested than infant formula so your baby will probably need to feed more frequently at the breast than it would have done on the bottle.
<LI>Accept that most babies also need to breastfeed at night.  To make this easy, keep your baby close to your bed at night, so that you can feed it in your bed while you doze.  This is not dangerous, you will instinctively be attentive to your baby in this situation.  Breastfeeding makes you relax, so that you rest while you feed even if you are not fast asleep.
<LI>Let your baby suckle your breast until it is satisfied.  Do not pay any attention to the clock when you feed.   Some days your baby may feed fast; other days more slowly.  Your baby may feed in spurts and rest a little in between; or it may feed more steadily.  You will learn to listen to the sounds your baby makes when it swallows, especially whether it is still taking milk from your breast.  If your baby is well positioned (see below) it will not damage your nipples even if
it is suckling frequently and for long periods.
<LI>If your baby spontaneously lets go of your breast, make a pause.  Then try to offer the same breast once more, to make sure your baby takes as much of the fat rich "hindmilk" as it needs.  Then, if your baby refuses the first breast, offer the second one.  If this offer, too, is refused, it means that your baby has taken what it wants.
<LI>Offer an alternate breast first in each feeding.  If your baby has a "favourite" breast this is not a problem.  In fact one breast alone can produce enough milk to feed your baby.  Remember that women have successfully breastfed twins and even triplets.
<LI>Try to give your baby only breast milk and <B><I>nothing else </B></I>for the first six months.  The milk covers all your baby's needs for food and drink for this period.  Even when it is very hot, or the baby has a fever, there is
<I>no need for extra water</I> if the baby gets the breast as often as it wants.
<LI>Remember that "normal" growth in babies will include some deviation from the average both on the over- and the underside of the growth curve!  In the first months normal weight gain usually varies between 500-800 grams per month.  If the monthly weight gain is less than this, there is no reason to  panic or to resort to infant formula.  See if the baby can be coaxed to feed more often.  Have an experienced woman check that the baby is well positioned at the
breast,  and that it feeds "efficiently" (see later).
<LI>Be aware that babies grow in spurts.  At any time, your baby may suddenly want to feed more often for some days,  and your milk will increase.  Babies are very good at regulating demand and supply, if they are allowed to set the pace for themselves.
</UL>


<H2><a name="P06">The flow of milk</A></H2>


When your baby is suckling at your breast, this releases hormones that make your milk flow towards the milk stores behind your nipples.  This is called the "let-down reflex".  The mere sight or thought of your baby may start the reflex and make your milk flow.  Conversely, the let-down reflex can be temporarily delayed or inhibited by worry, pain, embarrassment and other unpleasant feelings - such as those you may have during the present emergency.<P>

In such cases the milk flow may be interrupted temporarily,  from a few minutes to several hours.  Remember that this is always temporary and can always be reversed.  <I>It is not physically possible to "lose" your milk or your ability to breastfeed</I>.<P>

<B>Fig. 2 How the baby takes the breast</B><P>

<h3><a name="P08">How the baby gets the milk</A></h3>
The milk is not really "sucked" out of the breast, rather it is "milked" out of the milk stores (sinuses) behind the nipple.  The pressure of the baby's tongue and bottom lip against these stores, together with the inner pressure created by the let-down reflex, actually squirts the milk out.  A good "milking" movement of the baby's mouth is possible only when the baby is close enough to the breast and well positioned.  <P>

Conversely, if you hold the baby too far from your body it can only reach the tip of your nipple, and just to keep the nipple inside the mouth it will have to suck forcefully.  It may then inadvertently damage the skin on your nipple.  This is the origin of most "sore nipples".  Sometimes this also results in the baby getting less milk than it needs.


<H2><a name="P09">How to position: step by step</A></H2>
<OL>
<LI>	Make yourself comfortable so that you can relax. Sit or lie in a position which makes it easy for you to keep the baby close to your breast for a considerable length of time.  There are many positions,  lying, sitting, squatting ...  None can be labelled "correct" or wrong so long as you relax and the baby gets well to the breast.
<LI>Hold your baby in a way that it does not have to turn its head to reach your breast.  Who would like to eat with the head turned?  This means that the baby's chest is turned to your chest, or tummy to your tummy.  See to it that the baby is comfortable, too.
<LI>Hold the baby so close that it does not have to tug at your breast while it is feeding.  If your baby has to use its considerable suction power to keep your breast in the mouth, it is very likely to hurt your nipple.
<LI>Support your baby's back,  do <B><I>not</B></I> hold onto the head. If your baby is forced to take your breast with the back of its head locked in a firm grip, it may instinctively try to bend away, "fighting" at your breast.
<LI>When you start the feed,  your babys nose should be at a level with the nipple.  This means that the baby will need to tilt the head back a little to reach the nipple.  You can steer the position of the baby's body by its bottom!
<LI>Do not use your fingers to keep your breast away from the baby's nose. If you do this, you distort the shape of your breast and your baby may be unable to get a good hold of the breast. When well positioned, the baby breathes through the sides of its nostrils.
<LI>Do not hold and move your breast as if it were a bottle.  This will make it difficult for your  baby to grasp your breast well.  Your baby should have a good mouthful of breast so that it gets at the milk stores.  If it is necessary to support your breast, do so from below, preferably with a flat hand against the ribcage.  The fingers should at all times be
well (say, 10 cm ...) away from the nipple.
<LI>If the baby is sleepy or fussy you can focus its mind on feeding by gently stroking the cheek or mouth, or touching them with your nipple.  If you milk out a drop of milk and leave it on the nipple this may awaken the appetite further.  When you do this the baby will usually open its mouth, often making "milking" movements with the tongue.
<LI>When you see that your baby's mouth is wide open, the tongue well down in the lower part of the mouth,  the trick is to quickly pull your baby towards you,  giving it a chance to "latch on".  Several tries may be necessary, this is not always successful at the first attempt!
<LI>	If the baby was angry, hungry or crying when put to the breast, the tongue may have got on to the overside of the nipple, making the milking movement of the mouth impossible.  Try to calm the baby down before you try to feed again.  Some babies have periods of protest each time you try to feed.  You may then have to make the baby take the breast almost without it noticing, whenever there is a good opportunity.  If the baby prefers only one breast, let it have it!  You may be a little lopsided, but it does no harm to the baby.
<LI>Remember that it is the baby who comes to the breast, <I>not</I> the breast to the baby
</OL>

<B>Checklist for positioning</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>Your babys mouth should be wide open and the lips turned outward.
<LI>When it is well latched on, the babys lips and gums can effortlessly compress some of the area around the nipple (areola).
<LI>The tongue should be in the baby's lower jaw,  so that tongue and lower jaw together may make the wavelike, "milking" movement which squirts out the milk by compressing the milk stores against the palate.
<LI>The tongue may be visible between the lips and your breast.
<LI>	Your baby suckles slowly and deeply and the movement may even extend to its ears! Swallowing can often be seen or heard.
<LI>	Because it is being held so close the baby's chin and nose may touch your breast.  You need not fear that it can not breathe;  babies' noses are specially designed to ensure breathing in this position.  Exceptionally a baby may have difficulties, and responds by "fighting" at the breast.  More often "fighting" is triggered by the baby being unable to
move the head freely,  for example if it is being locked in place by an adult hand.
<LI>	When the baby is well positioned and your milk is flowing,  breastfeeding does <I>not</I>hurt.

<H2><a name="P10">How to get breastfeeding started</A></H2>

		Ideally,  your baby should have its first feed as soon as it is ready after birth. If you and your baby stay in skin-to-skin contact, from immediately after birth until the baby on its own has found the way to the breast,  latched on and had its first feed, the two of you have had the best possible start.  <P>

		If this was not possible, do not worry.  The process of finding the breast in peace and quiet, and latching on on its own accord may be re-enacted at a later stage,  even several weeks after birth, when the baby is placed
naked (or with a diaper) on your warm skin and allowed to follow its own instincts.  Do not expect immediate reaction, it may take some hours for your baby to remember what it was all supposed to be about.<P>

		Try always to arrange it so that you can stay together with your baby 24 hours a day from the very start. In this way you have a good chance to learn to understand the messages of your baby. This will also lower the risk of infection which could be a greater problem during an emergency.<P>

		It used to be thought that <B><I>swaddled</I> </B>babies were protected from external infections.  There is no scientific evidence that this is the case.  Tight swaddling makes it impossible for your baby to move and to communicate with you, and it is difficult to properly position the stiff little bundle in a comfortable way for latching on to your breast. It is preferable to wrap your baby loosely in a cotton cloth or a warm shawl, or, as a compromise, to swaddle only the lower part of the body, leaving the arms and head free to move.<P>

		Do  not hesitate to keep your baby with you in bed if you think this is more comfortable. There is no risk of "smothering" your baby.<P>

		There is <I>no</I> need to wash your nipples or breasts before breastfeeding your baby.  Human milk is a very efficient disinfectant.  Soap, disinfectants or alcohol  remove the natural skin oil and increases your risk of developing sore nipples.  <P>


<H2><a name="P11">Re-lactation and induced lactation</A></H2>


			In an emergency situation there may be no infant formula available.  It will then be useful to know that your region is full of women who are all potential breast milk factories.  It may be hard to believe but any woman who has given birth can <I>re</I>-lactate, and <I>any</I> woman with ordinary mammary glands can induce milk production in her breasts, even if she has never been pregnant.<P>

			It is a little easier to <I>re-</I>lactate if you have already had babies,  than it is to induce lactation if you have never been pregnant at all.  This has both physiological and psychological reasons.  If you have recently been pregnant you will usually have more milk producing gland tissue, and you can produce more milk than a woman who has not been through the process of pregnancy and gland tissue proliferation.  However, the process of breastfeeding in itself stimulates gland proliferation.<P>


<H2><a name="P12">How re-lactation works</A></H2>
		When the baby starts suckling your "empty" breast, whether you are the babys mother or not,  this induces your brain to start the production of milk-producing hormones.  It is possible to get exactly the same effect by hand-milking (see below).  Also, if you, or the father, for that matter, gently stroke the nipple and rolls it between two fingers until it becomes erectile,  for some minutes  several times a day, the breasts will begin to produce milk.  This does however take a little more than usual lovemaking!  If a mother who prepares herself for adoption, for example, has time for such preparation, she can do this
exercise at least twice a day, for example when dressing and undressing.  <P>

		When the baby gets to the breast, its mouth, gums and jaws produce enough stimulus for milk production to continue or to get started, provided it is willing to take the breast.  <P>

		In re-lactation it usually takes from 1-7 days for the milk to "come in", and it may take from 2-6 weeks before the mother is able to exclusively breastfeed.  If lactation is to be induced it may even take a little longer.<P>

<LI>See if it is possible to press out some liquid from your breast.  Whatever the liquid is or looks like, the baby will like it and thrive on it.  If nothing comes out, put some drops of donor milk or infant formula on the nipple.  Then put your baby in a good position, as described above, and try to get it to latch on to your breast.
<LI>If your baby refuses to suckle a breast from which nothing comes out, you may use a nursing supplementer as an "extra breast".  This is a plastic straw leading to a bottle or cup of donated human milk or infant formula.  (see figure).  The straw is fastened to the breast with surgical tape, with the opening at the tip of the nipple.  The flow of milk can be regulated by raising or lowering the bottle or cup,  or by pinching the straw.  The straw may also be tied into a loose knot which may be loosened or tightened for regulation.  If you attach the straw to a syringe,  you can regulate the flow by pressing the syringe pump.  It may be necessary for you to have three or four hands during this procedure,  so fatherly assistance, for example,  is usually very welcome.  Your baby may now be willing to give your breast the suckling stimulus it needs.
<LI>Some babies become full too rapidly when they use the nursing supplementer, and do not stimulate your breast for long enough for your milk supply to build up.  If so, you may have to be a little stingy with using the device when your own milk starts to come in.  Remember it is not only the suckling stimulus which regulate your production level, but also
the amount of milk removed from your breast.
<LI>If this whole procedure proves difficult, do not despair.  You can always use hand milking to stimulate your milk supply, and this is often the simplest and easiest way possible.  Continue to offer your breast to the baby at regular or irregular intervals, 8-10 times a day.

<LI>Stimulate the let-down reflex (or flow of milk) by gently massaging the breast,  stroking very gently from the base of the breast towards the nipple.  Manipulate the nipple between thumb and index finger.  Warm compresses on the breast, including the nipple,  may help relax the "sphincter" muscle around the tip of the nipple, which is normally contracted to stop the milk from dripping out.  A hot bath or shower, if that luxury is available to you, may have the same effect.
<LI>Place the thumb above and the index and middle fingers below the areola.
<LI>Press the fingers towards the chest wall.
<LI>Compress the milk stores between your fingers, and you may almost feel that the milk is pushed out through the nipple. Press and release. Press and release. Press and...release. Do this action repeatedly in order to mimic the rhythm of your baby's "milking".  The interior pressure created naturally by the let-down reflex, may help your milk flow out.
<LI>Be patient, no milk may come out at first. Avoid hard squeezing, pulling and pushing at the nipple or breast. This will not help the milk flow and may be harmful.
<LI>Press and release continuously until the milk flow stops.
<LI>Move the fingers around the areola so that all your milk stores are reached (you can use both hands in turn).
<LI>Repeat the procedure from step 3, at least until both breasts are soft and comfortable.
</OL>

<H2><a name="P16">Storage and feeding of expressed breast-milk</A></H2>

		Expressed breast-milk must be stored in a clean, closed container in the coolest place possible.  Because of its anti-bacterial properties,  milk can well be kept for one day at room temperature in a shady place. <P>

		Expressed breast-milk should be given by cup.  A very small, flexible plastic cup is recommended.  Feeding the baby by cup has the advantage that the cup itself is very easy to clean simply by washing it very well.  The baby is not confused by having to take the milk through a rubber nipple, which requires a very different use of the facial muscles than when the breast is "milked".



<H2><a name="P17">Cup-feeding: step by step</A></H2>
<OL>
<LI>Place the baby in a reasonably  upright position on your lap.
<LI>If necessary, support the baby's back and neck with one arm.  You may have to restrain the baby's eager arms with one hand so that the precious drops are not spilled!
<LI>Place the cup at the baby's mouth, keep it level so that the milk almost touches the upper lip.
<LI>Let the baby lap up the milk with the tongue (like a kitten).  Do not pour the milk into the mouth, but keep it level.  Let the baby set the pace.  You will be surprised at how your baby finds its own technique.
<LI>Be patient, try again if it does not work the first time around.  It does take some time to learn to master this technique, just as it does with breastfeeding.
<LI>Let the baby take as much as it wants - do not try to force-feed it.  If your baby is premature or ill, it may need to rest from time to time during the feed, and you have to be prepared that the feeding procedure will take some time!

<H2>Diphtheria, cholera, tuberculosis and other diseases threaten Europe</H2>

Borderlines may act as checkpoints for people and goods crossing from country to country.
<P>
But as new and re-emerging diseases threaten Europe, no country can seal off its borders from risks to public health.
<P>
The dangers? Diphtheria. Cholera and other diarrhoeal diseases. Tuberculosis. Acute respiratory infections. Viral hepatitis. Polio. AlDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. The solution? A comprehensive strategy to be implemented immediately across Europe, as urgently requested by the Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region. The Regional Office for Europe will lead the effort.

<H3>The facts</H3>
<UL>
<LI>A huge diphtheria epidemic affects the newly independent states of the former USSR. An    estimated 55 000-60 000 new cases occurred in 1995. Europe now accounts for more than 80% of diphtheria cases reported worldwide.
<LI>The number of registered cholera cases in the WHO European Region increased nine times from 1993 to 1994. In 1995, 17 of the 50 Member States reported at least one imported cholera case.
<LI>In many of the countries in the eastern part of the Region, mortality due to tuberculosis is increasing. Tuberculosis strains resistant to drugs are spreading. The downward trend of tuberculosis incidence in western Europe has levelled off, owing to TB cases in immigrant populations.
<LI>In many eastern European countries, mortality due to acute respiratory infections of    children below 5 years of age is more than 100 times higher than in western Europe. Throughout the European Region, influenza epidemics cause millions of cases and thousands of deaths.
<LI>In Europe, malaria was a nearly forgotten disease in the 1980s. But the number of registered cases has exploded in recent years,    from 20 000 in 1992 to more than 100 000 in 1995. While most cases are found in Turkey, Tajikistan and Azerbaijan, there are 3000-4000 imported malaria cases in other countries of the European Region.

<LI>Hepatitis has a large health and economic impact on all European countries. Even in western European countries, such as Germany, an estimated 50 000 cases of hepatitis B occur annually, 10% of which result in chronic diseases. The annual economic loss caused by hepatitis B in Germany is an estimated DM 3 billion. The incidence of hepatitis B is up to 10 times higher in many southeastern and eastern European countries.
<LI>Worldwide, 7121 cases of polio were reported in 1994, down from 35 255 cases in 1988. Through Operation MECACAR (MEditerranean, CAucasian, and Central Asian Republic), WHO's campaign to eliminate polio in the European and the Eastern Mediterranean Regions, the elimination of this feared disease may be possible by 1997.
<LI>Worldwide, an estimated 17 million people are infected with HIV. Six million cases of AIDS    have occurred. In Europe, the number of reported AlDS cases is 150 000; the number of HIV infections is estimated to be 500 000.
<LI>Almost all countries of the former USSR have experienced a sharp increase in sexually    transmitted diseases - up to 10 times higher than 10-20 years ago. In 1994, 120 000 cases of syphilis were reported in the Russian Federation alone. As of October 1995, 200 000 cases
already had been reported.
</ul>

<H3>But isn't this a central and eastern European problem only?</H3>

When the subject is communicable diseases, there's no such thing as "somebody else's problem". In western Europe, communicable diseases are responsible for about 7% of total deaths and cause more than 60% of all acute illnesses. Elsewhere in Europe those percentages are much higher.
<P>
<img src="cdbroc01.gif" align=left>

<I>Goal 8: Improve public information and education strategies to increase the acceptance of communicable disease prevention programmes
</I>
<br clear=left>
<P>

Although major outbreaks to date have been confined mainly to central and eastern Europe and particularly the newly independent states of the former USSR, there is a significant danger of importation of communicable diseases to western Europe. In fact, imported cases of diphtheria already have been documented in Finland, Germany and Norway. And most western European adults have not kept up with diphtheria booster immunizations. This means that they are vulnerable.
<P>
Between 40% and 50% of new tuberculosis cases in many western European countries have occurred in migrant populations.
<P>
Today's mobile societies mean communicable diseases cannot be sealed off. lmports through business travellers, holiday makers, immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers have shown that communicable diseases are crossing national borders.

<H2>WHO's plan for success</H2>

The WHO Regional Office for Europe has developed a 10-point strategy to combat these public health threats. In addition to the cost of vaccines, an estimated $5 million-$6 million is needed for successful implementation of the strategy. With those funds, we will coordinate and lead efforts to:

<OL>
<LI>Control the epidemic of diphtheria in the newly independent states of the former USSR through mass immunization, appropriate case management and improved surveillance;

<LI>Interrupt transmission of wild polio viruses in Europe by the end of 1997 through     strengthened polio surveillance and coordinated mass immunization campaigns (carried out under Operation MECACAR and focusing on countries still having endemic polio);

<LI>Strengthen national immunization programmes in all European countries, including the implementation of new and improved vaccines and with special emphasis on programmes in the newly independent states;

<LI>Strengthen and support tuberculosis control in the whole European Region;

<LI>Help the countries of central and eastern Europe and the newly independent states     implement WHO-recommended strategies for the control of diarrhoeal and acute respiratory diseases;

<LI>Improve surveillance for early detection of emerging and re-emerging diseases (including resistance to antibiotics) by establishing a network of national collaborating laboratories;

<LI>Prevent the HIV/AIDS epidemic from rising above the current level, and reduce the personal and social implications of HIV infection/AIDS through the development of comprehensive care and support; stop the alarming upsurge in sexually transmitted diseases by strengthening prevention of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases;

<LI>Improve public information and education strategies to increase the acceptance of     communicable disease prevention programmes;

<LI>Protect and restore the health service infrastructure related to the control of     communicable diseases through initiatives likely to produce immediate results; and


<li>Assist countries to improve basic hygiene and water quality in high-risk areas in order to lower the danger of outbreaks of food- and water-borne diseases.
</ol>

<H2>The cost of neglect</H2>


The high cost of neglecting this public health emergency is immeasurable, both in lives and in financial resources. Consider, however, two examples of imported polio outbreaks. In 1992/1993, the Netherlands spent US $10 million fighting 72 cases of polio. When an imported polio outbreak struck Finland a decade ago, nine people contracted the disease, but the entire population had to be immunized.


<H3>Immunization: the most cost-effective weapon</H3>

The social and economic changes sweeping central and eastern Europe have influenced the infrastructure of the programmes for disease prevention and control in these countries. As a result, many communicable diseases, once controlled by immunization, have re-emerged. Only sustained national immunization efforts can slow and finally control the epidemics that can spread from country to country.
<P>
Remember smallpox? Until recently, this often fatal disease claimed tens of thousands of lives every year. WHO launched a campaign in 1967 to eradicate smallpox, and the last case occurred in 1977 - marking the first disease ever eliminated in the history of humankind. The eradication of polio could be the next success story.
<P>
Quite simply, immunization is the single most powerful weapon to reduce disease incidence, to eliminate distinct diseases, and to prevent the re-emergence of diseases in countries having achieved reduction through immunization long ago. It is also one of the most cost-effective strategies for public health.

<P>
<img src="cdbroc02.gif" align=left>

<I>Goal 3: Strengthening national immunization programmes - Delivering polio vaccine
</I>
<br clear=left>
<H2>WHO is uniquely positioned
to combat communicable diseases
</h2>

WHO holds a unique place in the public health sector. With nearly 50 years of experience in helping Member States to implement standard programmes, we are motivated by only one force: our commitment to protecting public health.
<P>
WHO's comprehensive health networks and local staff infrastructures worldwide, combined with decades of technical expertise, allow the Organization to address public health concerns immediately. For example, when the recent Ebola fever crisis struck in Zaire, WHO rapidly headed for the scene - with the medical experts and equipment kits needed.
<P>
WHO takes a global view of public health issues. The Regional Office for Europe receives data on communicable diseases from all European countries, and analyzes and evaluates those data to help Member States plan and carry out appropriate public health strategies.

<P>
<img src="cdbroc04.gif" align=left>

<I>Goal 2: lnterrupt transmission of wild polio viruses in Europe by the end of 1997</I>
<P>
<br clear=left>
<P>
<img src="cdbroc03.gif" align=left>

<I>Goal 6: lmprove surveillance for early detection of emerging and re-emerging diseases - Training of microbiologists in diphtheria diagnosis </I>

<br clear=left>

<P>

WHO:

<UL>
<LI>Has the methodology for control.
<LI>Makes the technical recommendations.
<LI>Develops the requirements for production and control of vaccines.
<LI>Has the methodology for monitoring and surveillance.
<LI>Provides training in all these fields to assist countries in implementing national policies.
</UL>

WHO does not operate alone; on the contrary, we give great importance to coordinating activities and working in partnership with other organizations.
<P>
In 1994 an Interagency Immunization Coordinating Committee was created to support primary immunization and disease control in the newly independent states. The governments of many countries are generously supporting public health efforts in the newly independent states of the former USSR.
<P>
WHO's track record speaks for itself - from the eradication of smallpox, declared in 1980, to the impending eradication of polio and dracunculiasis (Guinea-worm infection) by the turn of the century.

<H3>How will we measure success?</H3>


Success is not some vague concept we declare after a few immunization programmes or educational campaigns. Concrete results require the measurement of concrete goals. These are just some of the ways in which we will gauge our success:

<UL>
<LI>Interruption of the transmission of wild polio viruses in the European Region by the end of 1997; worldwide eradication declared by the year 2000.
<LI>Reduction of diphtheria incidence in the newly independent states to pre-epidemic levels by the end of 1997.
<LI>Coverage of at least 90% of Europe's children with diphtheria, measles, pertussis, polio and    tetanus vaccines; the same level of coverage in countries where mumps, rubella, and hepatitis B vaccines are available by the end of 1997.
<LI>For all countries in the European Region, self-sufficiency in the provision of vaccines within approximately 10 years.
<LI>Implementation of WHO strategies on epidemic preparedness and outbreak control, aimed at emerging and re-emerging diseases.
<LI>Reduction of sexually transmitted diseases and new HIV infections through the establishment and consolidation of comprehensive programmes throughout Europe by the <LI>end of 1997.
<LI>Ensuring that WHO recommendations on tuberculosis control become operational in the
majority of countries of the European Region.
</ul>
<H2>We must act now</H2>

Financial support is urgently needed to address these specific, targeted, time-limited interventions. We must act now to protect the health of all of Europe's people. Delays can spell disaster, requiring actions that are far more costly than prevention.
<P>
In the interest of a healthy Europe, please support this initiative to combat communicable diseases.

<HR>

<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized agency of
the United Nations with primary responsibility for international
health matters and public health. Through WHO, which was created
in 1948, the health professions of over 180 countries exchange
their knowledge and experience, working for the attainment by
all citizens of the world of a level of health that will permit
them to lead socially and economically productive lives.
<P>
WHO/Europe (the WHO Regional Office for Europe) is one of six
regional offices throughout the world, each with its own programme
geared to the particular health problems of the countries it serves.
<P>
The WHO European Region embraces some 850 million people living
in an area that stretches from Greenland in the north-west and
the Mediterranean in the south to the Pacific coast of the Russian
Federation in the east. WHO/Europe therefore concentrates both
on the problem of industrial and post-industrial societies and
on those faced by the emerging democracies of the central and
eastern part of the Region. Since 1990, the number of <A href="../country/members.htm"><B>Member States</B></A>
has increased from 32 to 50.
<P>
WHO/Europe is governed by the <A href="regcom.htm"><B>Regional Committee for Europe</B></A>,
which comprises representatives of every Member State. Through
the Regional Committee all Member States collectively formulate
regional policies, supervise WHO/Europe's activities, recommend
technical activities and approve the budget. WHO/Europe in turn
advises and guides the Member States in their technical activities
and promotes the development of networks of experts and other
partners. 
<P>
WHO/Europe has four technical departments. Three mirror the main
groups of health for all and work for better health, healthy lifestyles,
healthy environments and appropriate health care. The fourth ties
together the threads of the various technical programmes into
country projects, with special emphasis on the countries of central
and eastern Europe (CCEE) and the newly independent states (NIS)
of the former USSR.
<P>
WHO/Europe has a permanent staff of some 260 people from over
40 nations. In addition, over 1000 experts join in the work every
year, along with collaborating centres and research institutes
across the Region. The regular annual budget is about US $23 million.
Funds donated by other sources, including the United Nations and
individual governments, have grown in recent years to about US
$25 million per year.

<HR>

Improving health throughout the European Region is too big a job for any one organization. So WHO/Europe carries out its work with a wide variety of partners: individuals, groups and organizations within and outside governments, and in different sectors and levels of activity. WHO/Europe's networks form a special category of partner. They are dedicated to particular goals - such as creating healthy cities or reducing chronic disease - and pursue them through formal structures and statements of purpose. Networks are vital partners in the work for health for all.

<H1>The Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative</H1>

<br clear=left>
<hr>

<H2>Mission and objectives </H2>

<P>
The Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) was launched by WHO
and UNICEF in 1991 at the meeting of the International Paediatric
Association in Ankara, with the following objectives:
<UL>
<LI>to enable mothers to make an informed choice about how to
feed their newborns;
<LI>to support early initiation of breastfeeding;
<LI>to promote exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months;
<LI>to ensure the cessation of free and low cost infant formula
supply to hospitals;
<LI>to include, possibly at a later stage and where needed, other
mother and infant health care issues.
</UL>

<P>
This is a global network that aims to give every baby the best
start in life by creating a health care environment where breastfeeding
is the norm, thus helping to reduce the levels of infant morbidity
and mortality in each country.
<H2>Structure and organization </H2>


In the WHO European Region, as at March 1996, there were 191 BFHI
hospitals in 11 countries. By the year 2000, it is hoped the number
of BFHI hospitals will double and that every country in the WHO
European Region will strive to have at least one BFHI hospital.
All BFHI hospitals follow <a href="#ten"><B>the ten steps to successful breastfeeding.</b></A>
<P>
Maternity services and maternity hospitals have been chosen as
the target hospitals that are eligible to join the BFHI network.
Hospitals indicate their interest by contacting their national
Breastfeeding Committee or the European Joint WHO/UNICEF BFHI
Action Task Force, in WHO/Europe, WHO headquarters or UNICEF,
Geneva.
<P>
Maternity services and hospitals can assess what is needed to
achieve BFHI status by using the hospital self-appraisal tool
specially designed for this purpose. When the hospital complies
with all the stated criteria outlined in the tool, it can then
request external assessment, which is organized by the national
authorities. The assessment is a rigorous procedure, lasting three
days and carried out by internationally trained professional assessors.
<P>
Depending on the result of the assessment the hospital is designated
a Baby-friendly Hospital and receives an award (plaque) or a Certificate
of Commitment.
<H2>Funding </H2>


BFHI is funded in many ways including the maternity hospitals,
UNICEF and WHO regular budget and voluntary donations.

<H2>Ten steps to successful breastfeeding </A></H2>


Every facility providing maternity services and care for newborn
infants should follow these ten steps to successful breastfeeding.
<OL>
<LI>Have a written breast-feeding policy that is routinely communicated
to all health care staff.
<LI>Train all health care staff in skills necessary to implement
this policy.
<LI>Inform all pregnant women about the benefits and management
of breastfeeding.
<LI>Help mothers initiate breastfeeding within a half-hour of
birth.
<LI>Show mothers how to breastfeed, and how to maintain lactation
even if they should be separated from their infants.
<LI>Give newborn infants no food and drink other than breast milk,
unless<I> medically</I> indicated.
<LI>Practise rooming-in - allow mothers and infants to remain
together - 24 hours a day.
<LI>Encourage breast-feeding on demand.
<LI>Give no artificial teats or pacifiers (also called dummies
or soothers) to breastfeeding infants.
<LI>Foster the establishment of breast-feeding support groups
and refer mothers to them on discharge from the hospital or clinic.

<H2>Infant feeding
</H2>
<H3>The problem
</H3>The introduction of modern technology in this century has succeeded in doing what centuries of famine, privation and disaster could not do.  Moving births from homes to hospitals combined with the mass production of breast-milk substitues have led to an unprecedented drop in the number of breastfed babies all over the world.  Health services have unwittingly contributed to the decline in breastfeeding by introducing routines and procedures that interfere with the normal establishment of breastfeeding.

<H2>The concept </H2>

A health promoting hospital tries to incorporate the concepts,
values and standards of health promotion into the organizational
structure and culture of the hospital. The goal is to improve
the quality of health care, and the conditions for and satisfaction
of the staff, patients and relatives. The method is to apply the
principles of the <a href="../../policy/ottawa.htm"><b>Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion</b></A> to develop the hospital in the ways expressed
in the Budapest Declaration on Health Promoting Hospitals.
<H2>The WHO European Project </H2>

The objective of the WHO European Health Promoting Hospitals project
is to promote a movement of hospitals throughout the WHO European
Region:
<UL>
<LI>to facilitate and encourage cooperation and the exchange of
experience and programmes between the participating hospitals;
<LI>to introduce health promotion into the culture of the hospitals;
<LI>to broaden the focus of hospital management and structures
to include health care, not just curative care;
<LI>to develop documented and evaluated examples of good practice
for the use of other institutions; and
<LI>to identify areas of common interest in which to develop programmes
and evaluation procedures.
</UL>

<H3>Approaches for development </H3>

Four approaches have been identified for developing health promoting
hospitals in the European Region.
<OL>
<LI>The Health Promoting Hospitals European Network is a wide
network of hospitals implementing health promoting activities
and other institutions interested in the subject. Some 400 hospitals
belong to this Network.
<LI>The Health Promoting Hospitals Pilot Project includes 20 European
hospitals committed to changing and adjusting their structure
and culture to become healthier institutions for patients, staff
and the community.
<LI>The thematic networks intend to bring together hospitals that
are carrying out specific health promoting activities, such as
creating a smoke-free environment, improving the quality of life
of patients or reducing stress in personnel. A project on health
promotion for elderly cardiovascular patients is being developed
in collaboration with the European Union.
<LI>The regional/national networks aim at facilitating and encouraging
the cooperation and exchange of experience between the hospitals
of a region or country, including identification of areas of common
interest, sharing of resources and development of common evaluation
systems. To date, some 270 hospitals from 11 European countries
participate in the regional/national networks.
</OL>

<H3>Main areas for programme development </H3>

<UL>
<LI>The wellbeing of staff and patients
<LI>The quality of services
<LI>Disease prevention, health education and rehabilitation
<LI>Sanitation and the protection of the environment
<LI>Relations between the hospital and the community
<LI>Coordination between primary health care and hospitals.
</UL>

<H2>Membership </H2>

<H3>Health Promoting Hospitals European and thematic networks
</H3>

Full membership is open to hospitals that:
<UL>
<LI>endorse the principles of the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion
(LINK) and the Budapest Declaration on Health Promoting Hospitals
as guidelines for action; and
<LI>develop programmes or activities for health promotion based
on the Budapest Declaration to introduce comprehensive organizational
change.
</UL>


Affiliated members or observers include hospitals, other institutions
and people that:
<UL>
<LI>endorse the principles of the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion
and the Budapest Declaration; and
<LI>are interested in the development of the project, or in collaborating
with hospitals in the project.
</UL>

<H3>Regional/National networks recognized by WHO </H3>


Individual members must fulfil the requirements for full members
of the Health Promoting Hospitals European Network.
<P>
Each network defines its own requirements and conditions for membership.
<P>
To secure membership or for more information, please contact the
Ludwig Boltzmann Institute or the Hospitals Unit of the WHO Regional
Office for Europe.
<H2>Background </H2>


The Health Promoting Hospitals Movement of the WHO Regional Office
for Europe is a project of the Hospitals Unit of the Department
of Health Policy and Services. The project started officially
at a workshop on hospitals and health that was held in Vienna
in 1990. It was established as a multi-city action plan of the
<a href="../hcp/index.htm"><b>WHO Healthy Cities project.</A></B> The Ludwig Boltzmann
Institute for the Sociology of Health and Medicine was appointed
coordinating centre for the project. On the basis of the Ottawa
Charter for Health Promotion and the experiences of the Healthy
Cities project, the Budapest Declaration on Health Promoting Hospitals
was developed at the first business meeting of the Health Promoting
Hospitals Network, which was held in Budapest in 1991. The Declaration
focuses on the content and aims of the member hospitals. Since
then, other networks have been established to facilitate and encourage
the development of the project.
<P>
Business meetings and annual conferences are held to exchange
information and experiences and to decide on the future developments
of the project.
<P>
A newsletter is published twice a year as well as various leaflets
and information booklets.
<H2>Management </H2>

The Hospitals unit of the WHO Regional Office for Europe and the
Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for the Sociology of Health and Medicine
coordinate the project. The four networks are interrelated to
maximize the benefits of exchanging experience with selected programmes
and structures.

<P>
The WHO Regions for Health Network in Europe was founded in November
1992. Already over 20 European regions have agreed to work with
each other to achieve better health for their local people, using
the <U>health for all</U> approach(LINK to HFA).
<P>
Through pooling ideas, experience and resources, the Network members
aim to sharpen the focus on health at local level.
<P>
This text aims to give you a concise view of why the Network was
set up, its structure and some of its current activities. For
those interested in knowing more, it lists the addresses of the
Network Secretariat and the focal points<B> </B>in each participating
region. If you want to join the Network or help it or a member
region with money, ideas or know-how, please approach one of the
people on the list.
<H2>Statement of intent </H2>

<P>
Following discussions in Lugano and Cardiff, representatives of
regions across Europe agreed on 17 November 1992 in Dusseldorf
to establish a Regions for Health Network. Recognizing that health
for all transcends boundaries, political, geographical and professional,
and to share knowledge, they agreed to adopt the following strategic
intent:
<P>
Through joint work the Regions for Health Network aims to strengthen
the focus at regional level on achieving health for all.
<P>
In moving forward, the founding members affirmed that progress
will be achieved through following a strategic direction emphasizing:
<UL>
<LI>dynamic alliances - working together to bring about health
gain at the regional and local level across Europe;
<LI>knowledge transfer - promoting excellence and effectiveness,
and eliminating waste and unnecessary duplication;
<LI>intersectoral action - making health for all<B> </B>the business
of everyone. 
</UL>

<P>
Those who join declare their willingness to promote the Network's
intent to the best of their capacity. They agree to exchange ideas
and experiences and, where appropriate, to work together on policy
development and projects to effect change at the regional and
local levels. The members will foster the widest collaboration,
bringing together from every sector all who can contribute to
improving health. In pursuit of the intent, the Network will encourage
links to other European groups.
<P>
Starting from this core of founding members, the Network will
in principle welcome all those who are interested in realizing
its strategic intent and who believe it matches their own approach.
In practice, the growth and development of the Network will depend
on the organizational and financial resources available and will
be guided by the results of continuous monitoring and evaluation
of its impact.
<P>
In keeping with the principles of health for all, the Network
members accept that solidarity and equity require that the burden
of running the Network may be shared unequally, but the benefits
will accrue to all.
<H2>Organization </H2>

<P>
Each member region appoints someone locally as a focal point to
act as its main link with the Network. The <U>focal points</U>
(LINK to Contacts) and other representatives of the regions attend
the Annual General Meeting of the Network, which is where progress
is evaluated and major decisions are taken on future action.
<P>
Guided by the decisions of the Annual General Meeting, a Steering
Committee composed of representatives from 6 of the regions and
the Secretariat plan and monitor joint projects and the general
running of the Network.
<P>
The members are called upon to harness their local resources (people,
know-how and expertise) and contribute support in cash and in
kind towards achieving the goals of the Network, drawing in partners
as appropriate.
<P>
To help coordinate the work of the Network, the WHO Regional Office
for Europe has established a Secretariat. It works closely with
the Steering Committee and acts as the main contact between the
WHO and the members, encouraging and supporting the Network and
strengthening links between it and other WHO programmes and activities.
The Secretariat is also responsible for the transfer of information
to member regions, other regions, WHO Member States, other parts
of WHO and other international bodies.
<H2>The Network in action </H2>

<P>
Regions joining the Regions for Health Network (RHN) accept responsibility
for working towards the strategic intent, through
<UL>
<LI>their own local initiatives
<LI>involvement in joint projects
<LI>securing financial and other support from their own region
and from sponsors
<LI>developing ways of promoting the work of the Network to others:
politicians, planners, health care providers, partners in other
sectors and the general public. 
</UL>

<P>
The purpose of RHN is to achieve tangible, serious improvements
in the protection, maintenance and promotion of health at regional
level. Besides the objectives set out in the statement of intent,
it aims at increasing equity in health, wide participation in
decision-making and promoting a balance between issues of lifestyle,
environment and health care. It encourages new approaches to policy
analysis and sharing models of good practice. Joint action involving
several countries is already in hand, especially emphasizing the
involvement of countries from central and eastern Europe.
<P>
The activities of RHN are generated by the members, each of which,
on joining, identifies its own strengths and areas where it would
appreciate help from other members.
<P>
There are a number of activities currently under way, including:
<UL>
<LI>a major exercise in developing health policy linking three
regions in western Europe with three counties in Hungary;
<LI>a number of projects looking at how information can be used
to derive improvements in health at regional level;
<LI>training seminars combining resources from a number of regions

</UL>

<P>
A major conference is organized each year in association with
the Annual General Meeting, offering the opportunity to all members
to meet and discuss a theme of significance to them all.
<P>
A newsletter published twice a year keeps members and others in
touch with the activities and future plans of RHN.
<H2>Programme design </H2>

<P>
RHN was always intended to be an open network, not a select club.
Because the vision has to be tempered with realism, the pace of
expansion must not exceed the resources available and the need
to evaluate progress.
<P>
While in principle membership should be open to all, criteria
have been established to ensure that new members have an appropriate
level of commitment.
<H3>Formal essential criteria </H3>

<UL>
<LI>The region must be identifiable as an administrative unit,
an existing group of subunits, or a region clearly recognized
for its similar socioeconomic, cultural characteristics.
<LI>The region must have a degree of autonomy to make decisions.

</UL>

<H3>Political essential criterion </H3>

<UL>
<LI>There must be a clearly stated interest in developing a policy
based on health for all, and acceptance of the strategic intent
of RHN. 
</UL>

<H3>Other criteria for full membership </H3>

<UL>
<LI>The region must have a potential and willingness to mobilize
resources for HFA (economic, intellectual, etc.).
<LI>The region must have a capacity for building up new partnership
for health (i.e. the potential for intersectoral action).
<LI>The region should have structures for monitoring and evaluating
progress. 
</UL>

<H3>Financial or in-kind contribution for membership </H3>

<P>
All members are expected to contribute to the running of RHN,
through an annual subscription and other financial or in-kind
support as set out in the fund-raising strategy. Special provisions
are made for regions that have a problem with foreign currency.
<P>
Regions unable to meet all these criteria may enter into associate
membership prior to joining as full members.

<h1>Health for all</H1>


<HR>
</center>

The work of WHO/Europe is based on the regional policy for health for all, which includes 38 targets. They fall into five groups: targets for better health, lifestyles conducive to health, healthy environments, appropriate health care services and the support needed to attain them.<p>
The regional health for all (HFA) policy, strategy and targets were
approved by the thirty-fifth session of the Regional Committee in 1984. The policy and targets were updated in 1989-1991 and the updated version was approved by
the forty-first session of the Regional Committee in 1991. Progress towards achieving the targets has been evaluated regularly. (See the results of the most recent monitoring in <a href="../country/euro/part0h.htm"> <b><i>Health in Europe</i></b> </A>and check progress on health for all indicators on the <a href="ftp://ftp.who.dk/in"><b>HFA database.</b></A>) The regional policy and targets will be further updated in 1998, following a review of the progress towards health for all in 1997.<P>

<H2>The broad perspective</H2>
The health policy for Europe consists of 38 targets. They can be divided into <a href="hfagroup.htm">groups,</A> addressing:


<UL>
<LI>the improvements in health status expected by the year 2000;
<LI>the developments in prevention, treatment, care and rehabilitation, changes in lifestyles and
improvements in environment that will make it possible to attain the targets;
<LI>policy formulation and sustained implementation on the basis of political, managerial and institutional
support and coordination.
</UL>
The health outcomes that the HFA movement in the European Region is striving to achieve have four
dimensions:<P>
<UL>
<B><LI>ensuring equity in health</B> by reducing disparities in health status between countries and
between groups within countries;
<B><LI>adding life to years</B> by helping people achieve and use their full physical, mental and social
potential;
<B><LI>adding health to life</B> by reducing disease and disability;
<B><LI>adding years to life</B> by increasing life expectancy.
</UL>
Six major themes run through the health for all targets.<P>
<UL>
<LI>Equity is the essence of health for all. All people should have a fair opportunity to realize their full
health potential.
<LI>The prevention of disease and promotion of health are important strategic issues to give people a
positive sense of health so that they can make full use of their physical, mental and social capacities.
<LI>Well informed and motivated people and communities will participate actively in setting their
priorities, and in making and carrying out decisions.
<LI>Many sectors of society must collaborate in order to achieve health for all. Intersectoral participation is
needed to ensure health and protection from risks in the physical, economic and social environment.
<LI>A harmonious health service system meets the basic needs of each community by focusing on primary
health care with adequate referral services and provides affordable, quality care.
<LI>An increasing number of health problems transcend national frontiers.
</UL>

for MS DOS </H2>

<H3>Updated February 1997 </H3>

<H3>(Provisional updating) </H3>
<hr>
</center>

This package contains data on selected health statistics for European
countries, called Health for All Indicators, and includes software
to display these data in a user-friendly way. Full list of indicators
of this package can be exported as a text file and printed whenever
needed (see Help text). The World Health Organization, Regional
Office for Europe, collects data from various sources, primarily
from national counterparts on health statistics. The main sources
of information are listed in the file SOURCES.HFA. The database
is periodically updated, as more recent data become available.
<P>
The HFAP/PC can be downloaded from Internet by:
<H3>1) Using FTP: </H3>

<UL>
<LI>Connect to ftp.who.dk
<LI>Use ANONYMOUS as userid and your own Internet ID as password

<LI>Choose files from the library /IN or /HFA
<LI>The files SETHFAD.EXE and README.DOS contain the DOS version

<LI>The files SETHFAW.EXE and README.WIN contain the Windows'
version
<LI>Switch to binary mode before receiving the .EXE files.
</UL>

<H3>2) Via WWW </H3>

<UL>
<LI>Connect to home page of WHO/EURO's World-Wide Web Server (http://www.who.dk)
<LI>Select &quot;Country Information&quot;
<LI>Download instructions and HFA data base.
</UL>

<P>
Requests for copies of the HFA/PC (both DOS and WINDOWS versions)
can also be forwarded to:
<P>
ADR/DIS unit, WHO Regional Office for Europe, Scherfigsvej 8, DK-2100
Copenhagen, Telefax: +45 39 17 18 18
<P>
Copies can also be obtained from the WHO documentation centres
that have been established in a number of countries. Please note
that the Regional Office may charge a certain amount to cover
the cost of the diskette and handling expenses.
<P>
The HFA/PC package may be copied for use by other individual users
or organizations, under the condition that it is not used for
commercial purposes and this README.1st file is also copied without
change.
<H3>Disclaimer </H3>


Users should note that the data for some indicators have been
obtained from various sources, and that the comparability of these
indicators between countries is limited, owing to differences
in the definitions and measurement practices used in different
countries and/or time periods. Some of historical mortality data
for before 1990 for the former USSR have been received via technical
collaboration with the institutions possessing these data and
cannot be seen as official data provided to WHO by the Member
States concerned. Any changes in the data that may subsequently
be received from new Member States will be included in later versions
of the package.

<P>
Your comments on the usefulness of this HFA/PC program and suggestions
for improvement would be very appreciated.


<H3>Installation<BR>
</H3>


To run the HFA/PC, your PC will require about 4 Mbyte RAM and
3 Mbyte of harddisk space to work with the HFA/PC program, depending
on what other programs you are running.  The PC should be at least
386SX.software.

<P>
1)  Create a directory on your hard disk and copy all files from
the distribution diskette (or ones downloaded from Internet) into
the new directory. You can do this with the following MS DOS-commands:


<P>
C:&gt;MD HFAWIN97
<P>
C:&gt;CD HFAWIN97
<P>
C:\HFAWIN97&gt;COPY A:\*.*

<P>
OR    COPY B:\*.*
<P>
2)  Then run the SETHFAW.EXE file to decompress data files:
<P>
C:\HFAWIN97\&gt;SETHFAW
<P>
3)  After the installation, your directory now contains approximately
220 files.
<P>
4)  You can then delete the SETHFAW.EXE in order to save space.
<P>
5)  Log on to Windows (3.0 or 3.1) and use the normal Windows
procedure to define the HFA.EXE from the newly created directory
as an icon in one of your windows.
<P>
6)  When you first run this program you must establish the Data
Path.  Do this by starting the program, click on the File menu,
then click on Data Path, select Primary, then click OK to confirm
that the data files will be kept in the same directory as the
software.
<H3>Disclaimer / &quot;about&quot; menu item</H3>


When you first access this program, you will be presented with
a disclaimer screen which contains very important information
and which should be read carefully.  After you have entered the
Country Selection List, selected and STORED some country names,
a WHO.INI file is created which inhibits the program from showing
the disclaimer text each time you start the HFA/PC program.  This
text will however still be accessible by entering the ABOUT menu
item, or by reading the DISCLAIM.ER file.  The DISCLAIM.BAT file
will print the DISCLAIM.ER file on your screen or you may use
your usual full-screen editor to print or browse this file.
<H3>Useful files</H3>


1)  The SOURCES.HFA file is a listing of all indicators with their
source(s) and definition.  Users should note that the data for
some indicators have been obtained from various sources, and that
the intercountry comparability for these indicators is limited
due to varying definitions and measurement practices used in different
countries and/or time periods.  The SOURCES.BAT file will print
the SOURCES.HFA file on your screen or you may use your usual
full-screen editor to print or browse this file.
<P>
2)  The COUNTRY.HFA contains all the country names with abbreviations
which this software uses.  These country abbreviations and names
are for computer processing of data and are not necessarily the
ones recognised officially, nor do they express any opinion whatsoever
on the part of the Secretariat of the World Health Organization
concerning the legal status of any country or territory.  The
COUNTRY.BAT file will print the COUNTRY.HFA file on your screen
or you may use your usual full-screen editor to print or browse
this file.
<H3>Definitions</H3>


1)  The EUROPEAN AVERAGE (EUR) and the other regional averages
(CEE, EU, NIS, NRD) are population-weighted averages.  They are
normally calculated when a minimum of 50% of the countries (except
for the CEE average) have data for a given indicator for a selected
time period.  The number of countries included in the average
calculations for different indicators will therefore vary.  Also,
as new data is received, more countries will meet the criteria
for inclusion in the appropriate average calculations, with the
result that averages for the same indicator and year may vary
between versions of the HFA/PC.  To ensure that a time series
includes the same countries throughout, data are checked by country
and year and missing values are calculated.  The program uses
linear interpolation for the calculation of the missing values.
 The same calculations are made for the EU AVERAGE (15 European
Union countries), the CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN AVERAGE (12
countries not including the ex-USSR), the NEWLY INDEPENDENT STATES
AVERAGE (15 countries of the former USSR) and the NORDIC AVERAGE
(5 countries).

<P>
It should be noted that the averages for NIS and CEE can show
inconsistent trends.  This is due to the combination of data from
ex-countries and from the present countries, e.g., ex-Czechoslovakia
is now 2 countries, ex-USSR is now 15 countries, ex-Yugoslavia
is now 5 countries.  Data definitions or completeness can differ
and in a few cases give unstable trends in the NIS or CEE averages.

<P>
2)  The STANDARDIZED DEATH RATE (SDR) is the age-standardized
death rate calculated using the direct method, i.e., the age specific
rates are averaged, using as weights the distribution of the European
standard population as defined in the World Health Statistics
Annual.  This standardized rate represents what the crude rate
would have been in the population if that population had the same
age distribution as the standard population.

<P>
3)  Each INDICATOR has a 6 character numerical code.  The first
two numbers indicate to which HFA target the indicator belongs.
 Codes starting with 99 are used for supplementary indicators
and are not the indicators approved by the WHO European Regional
Committee.  Also, some indicators have not been included in this
package as the data is considered of insufficient availability
and/or quality.

<P>
4)  Full-time equivalent (FTE) is calculated by adding full- and
the appropriate proportion of part-time occupied posts.

<H3>Hints and other useful information
</H3>


1) A DATA AVAILABILITY chart can be accessed by entering the Indicators
Selection Menu, selecting an indicator and then clicking twice
on the circle indicating the relevant population group, i.e. Total,
Male or Female.  In addition, the Tables A or B can be consulted.
 When in the Map display or one of the Bar Charts, one can point
and click to learn data details of that country.
<P>
2) The PROJECTIONS to the year 2000 shown in this software are
simple linear approximations of curves and, therefore, only a
rough estimate of a trend.  You should treat the projections with
caution.  To display a projection, enter one of the line graphs
and point the cursor to the year from which the projection should
be calculated and press the left mouse button.

<P>
3) The option to select the FIRST AVAILABLE YEAR or the LAST AVAILABLE
YEAR must be used with caution.  Comparison of countries may be
misleading because the years for which data are available can
vary significantly between countries. Check the Data Availability
facility or Table B for details on data years.

<P>
4) The TWO INDICATOR COMPARISON CHART facilitates comparison between
indicators and/or between sexes. As on the other presentation
graphs you decide on indicators and sex by pulling down the INDICATOR
and SEX menus. You will be asked to indicate whether you are changing
the left/right indicator/sex. Note that two different indicators
might provoke different scaling on the two Y-axis. For comparing
MALE and FEMALE for the same indicator, choose the same indicator
for left/right.

<P>
5) The BOXPLOT shows where a given country (indicated by an asterisk)
is placed as compared to other countries.  The brackets indicate
the middle part of the distribution, by default containing 80%
of all countries (to change, pull down the RANGE menu bar).  The
BOXPLOT allows one to observe the position of a country for several
indicators simultaneously.  By comparing boxplots for different
years, one can quickly assess whether the country is relatively
progressing or regressing as compared to other countries.  The
minimum and maximum values of the indicator for the countries,
appear on the sides of each box and the value of the selected
country (which corresponds to the asterisk) is shown below the
boxes.

<P>
6) If you encounter an APPLICATION OR SYSTEM ERROR, it can relate
to the actual installation of Windows and not to this program.


<P>
7) If the PRINTOUTS look strange (if the text is to small or overlaps),
it is most likely a problem in the printer driver.  If possible,
try to print via another printer driver or try another PC with
a different printer attached.

Press release EURO/01/97<BR>
Copenhagen, January 1997<BR>
<BR>

<H2>BBC World Service and the World Health Organization promote
healthy living in Romania and Uzbekistan
</H2>


BBC World Service and the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional
Office for Europe have jointly been awarded a grant from the British
Government Know How Fund to pioneer a mass media health education
initiative in Romania and Uzbekistan. Radio broadcasts and educational
booklets in Uzbek and Romanian will be used to inform people about
the health risks associated with smoking, lack of exercise, poor
diet and alcohol abuse, and health care professionals will receive
special training in their localities.

<P>
Dr Franklin Apfel, WHO Regional Adviser for Communication and
Public Affairs, said: &quot;There has been a sharp increase in
rates of premature death among adults in eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union over the past few years. Much of this increase
is the result of a fall in living standards and lifestyle-related
factors such as smoking, poor diet and high alcohol consumption.&quot;


<P>
Jenny Stevens, coordinator of the BBC World Service part of the
project, said: &quot;This project aims to increase public awareness
of the risks and develop the professional competence of local
health education agencies in Romania and Uzbekistan.&quot;

<P>
The WHO Regional Office for Europe aims to improve the level of
health in <B>all</B> European countries and to reduce the
disparity between levels of health in eastern and western Europe.
Figures for life expectancy in eastern European countries and
the former Soviet Union are several years lower than the WHO target
of 75 years; most European Union countries have already achieved
this target. In the former Soviet Union, life expectancy for men
dropped to 59 years in the early 1990s; this level is below the
official retirement age and as low as levels in the 1950s.

Copenhague, janvier 1997<BR>

<H2>Le World Service de la BBC et l'Organisation mondiale de la
sant&eacute; (OMS) oeuvrent faveur de modes de vie sains <BR>
en Roumanie et en Ouzb&eacute;kistan<BR>
</H2>


Le World Service de la BBC et le Bureau r&eacute;gional de l'Organisation
mondiale de la sant&eacute; (OMS) pour l'Europe se sont vu conjointement
accorder, par le <I>Know How Fund</I> du Gouvernement britannique,
une subvention pour lancer une campagne d'&eacute;ducation sanitaire
de masse en Roumanie et en Ouzb&eacute;kistan. Des &eacute;missions
de radio et des brochures &eacute;ducatives en ouzbek et en roumain
informeront la population sur les risques sanitaires li&eacute;s
au tabagisme, &agrave; l'absence d'exercice physique, &agrave;
une mauvaise alimentation et &agrave; l'abus d'alcool. Par ailleurs,
des professionnels de la sant&eacute; recevront, sur place, une
formation sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;e.

<P>
Comme le fait observer le Dr Franklin Apfel, conseiller r&eacute;gional
de l'OMS pour la communication et les relations ext&eacute;rieures
: &#171;On a not&eacute;, ces derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es,
une brusque augmentation de l'incidence des d&eacute;c&egrave;s
pr&eacute;matur&eacute;s chez les adultes d'Europe orientale et
de l'ancienne Union sovi&eacute;tique. Cette augmentation est
due en grande partie &agrave; la chute du niveau de vie et &agrave;
des facteurs li&eacute;s au comportement : tabagisme, mauvaise
alimentation et abus d'alcool&#187;.

<P>
Jenny Stevens, coordinatrice de la partie du projet assur&eacute;e
par le World Service de la BBC, pr&eacute;-cise de son c&ocirc;t&eacute;
: &#171;Ce projet a pour but de sensibiliser le public aux risques
encourus et de d&eacute;velopper la comp&eacute;tence professionnelle
des organismes roumains et ouzbeks d'&eacute;ducation sanitaire&#187;.


<P>
Le Bureau r&eacute;gional de l'OMS pour l'Europe s'efforce d'am&eacute;liorer
la sant&eacute; dans <B>tous </B>les pays europ&eacute;ens et
de r&eacute;duire, &agrave; cet &eacute;gard, les disparit&eacute;s
existant entre l'Europe orientale et l'Europe occidentale. L'esp&eacute;rance
de vie dans les pays d'Europe orientale et dans l'ancienne Union
sovi&eacute;tique est inf&eacute;rieure de plusieurs ann&eacute;es
au but fix&eacute; par l'OMS, qui est de 75 ans. La plupart des
pays europ&eacute;ens ont d&eacute;j&agrave; atteint ce but. Dans
l'ancienne Union sovi&eacute;tique, l'esp&eacute;rance de vie
des hommes est descendue &agrave; 59 ans au d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es
90. Ce niveau est inf&eacute;rieur &agrave; l'&acirc;ge officiel
de la retraite et correspond aux niveaux enregistr&eacute;s dans
les ann&eacute;es 50.

<H4>Pressemitteilung EURO/01/97<BR>
Kopenhagen, Januar 1997</H4>

<H2>BBC World Service und die Weltgesundheitsorganisation f&ouml;rdern
ein gesundes Leben in Rum&auml;nien und Usbekistan
</H2>


BBC World Service und das Regionalb&uuml;ro f&uuml;r Europa der
Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) haben gemeinsam vom Know-How-Fund
der britischen Regierung einen Zuschuss f&uuml;r eine Massenmedieninitiative
zur Gesundheitserziehung in Rum&auml;nien und Usbekistan erhalten.
Mit Rundfunksendungen und Aufkl&auml;rungsbrosch&uuml;ren in Usbekisch
und Rum&auml;nisch werden die Menschen &uuml;ber die gesundheitlichen
Risiken des Rauchens, fehlender k&ouml;rperlicher Bet&auml;tigung,
einer schlechten Ern&auml;hrung und des Alkoholmissbrauchs aufgekl&auml;rt,
und Gesundheitsfachkr&auml;fte werden in ihren Gemeinden besonders
geschult. 

<P>
Dr. Franklin Apfel, WHO-Beauftragter f&uuml;r Kommunikation und
&Ouml;ffentlichkeitsarbeit, erkl&auml;rte: ,,Die Fr&uuml;htodesraten
unter Erwachsenen in Osteuropa und der ehemaligen Sowjetunion
sind w&auml;hrend der letzten paar Jahre krass gestiegen. Ein
Gro&szlig;teil dieser Zunahme geht auf den sinkenden Lebensstandard
und Faktoren der Lebensweise wie Rauchen, schlechte Ern&auml;hrung
und hohen Alkoholkonsum zur&uuml;ck.&quot;

<P>
Jenny Stevens, Koordinatorin des von BBC World Service &uuml;bernommenen
Projektteils, sagte dazu: ,,Mit diesem Projekt soll in der &Ouml;ffentlichkeit
das Bewusstsein f&uuml;r die Risiken gesch&auml;rft und die Fachkompentenz
der &ouml;rtlichen Gesundheitserziehungsstellen in Rum&auml;nien
und Usbekistan verbessert werden.&quot;

<P>
Das WHO-Regionalb&uuml;ro f&uuml;r Europa strebt die Verbesserung
des Gesundheitszustands in allen europ&auml;ischen L&auml;ndern
an und m&ouml;chte das Gesundheitsgef&auml;lle zwischen Ost- und
Westeuropa abbauen. Die Lebenserwartung in den osteurop&auml;ischen
L&auml;ndern und in der ehemaligen Sowjetunion liegt mehrere Jahre
unter dem WHO-Ziel von 75&nbsp;Jahren. Die meisten L&auml;nder
der Europ&auml;ischen Union haben dieses Ziel dagegen bereits
erreicht. In der ehemaligen Sowjetunion ging die Lebenserwartung
der M&auml;nner Anfang der 90er Jahre drastisch auf 59&nbsp;Jahre
zur&uuml;ck, sie liegt somit unter dem offiziellen Rentenalter
und auf dem Niveau der 50er Jahre.

Press release EURO/02/97<BR>
Copenhagen, January 1997<P>

<H2>Pharmacists help smokers to quit</H2>


Pharmacists in Europe have joined forces to help smokers quit.
The EuroPharm Forum, which includes 31 national European pharmaceutical
associations and the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional
Office for Europe, has adopted a new Pharmacists' Charter on Action
against Smoking (see box) which aims at involving pharmacists
in smoking cessation programmes in the communities they serve.


<P>
Tobacco is the number one killer in Europe. Last year tobacco
killed 1.2 million people in the WHO European Region alone. This
amounted to 14% of all deaths. Just under one half of all adult
men and one quarter of women in the WHO European Region are daily
smokers. The number of young people who are starting to smoke
is rising throughout the Region. Because nicotine is so addictive,
once these young people start to smoke, they will continue for
an average of 20 years.

<P>
&quot;In the face of this enormous health risk and alarming trend,&quot;
states Dr Peter Anderson, WHO Regional Adviser for the Tobacco
or Health programme, &quot;much firmer action needs to be taken
to prevent young people from starting to smoke and to ensure that
professionals are knowledgeable and available to assist all people
to break their nicotine addiction.&quot;

<P>
By displaying posters and providing literature and advice to smokers
who request prescription and non-prescription medicines for smoking-related
problems, pharmacists throughout Europe have been very successful
in raising awareness of the health risks of smoking and helping
smokers to quit. The EuroPharm Forum is building on these successes
by incorporating relevant learning into practical training materials.
The Forum's new manual, <I>The role of the pharmacist in smoking
cessation</I>, will be issued as a booklet in the WHO Smoke-free
Europe Series.

<P>
&quot;Every smoker should have an opportunity to take in the message
that he or she can stop smoking and that support is available,&quot;
states Dr Jo Asvall, WHO Regional Director for Europe. &quot;Pharmacists,
as highly trained and easily accessible members of the primary
health care team, are ideally positioned to convey this message
and to provide support.&quot;

<HR>

<P>
The Pharmacists' Charter on Action against
Smoking
<P>
Calls for pharmacists to contribute to a smoke-free Europe by:

<UL>
<LI>providing a role model;
<LI>forbidding all smoking in the pharmacy to guard against the
risks of passive smoking, particularly to those who are most vulnerable,
including young children and asthmatics;
<LI>highlighting the health risks of smoking;
<LI>encouraging smokers to quit;
<LI>providing advice, help and support to smokers who want to
quit; and
<LI>urging governments to ban the advertising of tobacco products.

Copenhague, janvier 1997

<H2>Les pharmaciens aident les fumeurs &agrave; abandonner le
tabac
</H2>


Les pharmaciens d'Europe ont joint leurs efforts pour aider les
fumeurs &agrave; abandonner le tabac. Le Forum EuroPharm, qui
regroupe 31 associations nationales de pharmaciens et le Bureau
r&eacute;gional de l'Organisation mondiale de la sant&eacute;
(OMS) pour l'Europe, a adopt&eacute; une Charte du pharmacien
contre le tabagisme (voir encadr&eacute;), qui vise &agrave; associer
les pharmaciens aux programmes de 
sevrage tabagique dans les collectivit&eacute;s qu'ils desservent.


<P>
Le tabac est le tueur n&#176;1 en Europe. L'an dernier, il a tu&eacute;
1,2 million de personnes uniquement dans la R&eacute;gion europ&eacute;enne
de l'OMS. Cela repr&eacute;sente 14% du nombre total de d&eacute;c&egrave;s.
Pr&egrave;s de la moiti&eacute; des hommes adultes et un quart
des femmes de la R&eacute;gion europ&eacute;enne de l'OMS fument
quotidiennement. Le nombre de jeunes qui commencent &agrave; fumer
augmente dans l'ensemble de la R&eacute;gion. La nicotine cr&eacute;e
une forte d&eacute;pendance : une fois que ces jeunes commencent
&agrave; fumer, ils continuent en moyenne pendant 20 ans.

<P>
&#171;Face &agrave; ce risque &eacute;norme pour la sant&eacute;
et &agrave; cette &eacute;volution alarmante&#187;, d&eacute;clare
le Dr Peter 
Anderson, conseiller r&eacute;gional de l'OMS pour le programme
Tabac ou sant&eacute;, &#171;il faut prendre des mesures bien
plus &eacute;nergiques pour emp&ecirc;cher les jeunes de commencer
&agrave; fumer et veiller &agrave; ce que les professionnels soient
form&eacute;s et dispos&eacute;s &agrave; aider tous ceux qui
veulent rompre avec leur d&eacute;pendance &agrave; la nicotine&#187;.


<P>
En exposant des affiches et en proposant informations et conseils
aux fumeurs qui demandent des m&eacute;dicaments - en vente libre
ou sur ordonnance - d'aide au sevrage tabagique, les pharmaciens
d'Europe ont sensibilis&eacute; les fumeurs aux risques pour la
sant&eacute; li&eacute;s au tabagisme et les ont aid&eacute; &agrave;
cesser de fumer. Le Forum EuroPharm tire parti de ces succ&egrave;s
en int&eacute;grant les enseignements utiles de cette exp&eacute;rience
dans des ouvrages de formation. Le nouveau manuel du Forum, intitul&eacute;
<I>The role of the pharmacist in smoking cessation</I> [Le r&ocirc;le
du pharmacien dans le sevrage tabagique], sera publi&eacute; sous
la forme d'une brochure dans la collection Europe sans tabac de
l'OMS.

<P>
&#171;Chaque fumeur doit pouvoir recevoir le message selon lequel
il peut cesser de fumer et peut se faire aider&#187;, d&eacute;clare
le Dr Jo Asvall, directeur r&eacute;gional de l'OMS pour l'Europe.
&#171;Les pharmaciens, membres hautement qualifi&eacute;s et facilement
accessibles de l'&eacute;quipe des soins primaires, sont id&eacute;alement
plac&eacute;s pour propager ce message et offrir une aide&#187;.

Kopenhagen, Januar 1997
<H2>Apotheker helfen Rauchern, das Rauchen aufzugeben</H2>


Die Apotheker in Europa wollen den Rauchern mit vereinten Kr&auml;ften
helfen, das Rauchen aufzugeben. Das EuroPharm Forum, dem 31&nbsp;nationale
Apothekerverb&auml;nde in Europa sowie das Regionalb&uuml;ro der
Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) angeh&ouml;ren, hat eine neue
Apothekercharta zu Ma&szlig;nahmen gegen das Rauchen (siehe Kasten)
verabschiedet, mit der man sich das Ziel gesetzt hat, die Apotheker
in den von ihnen versorgten Gemeinden in Anti-Raucherprogramme
einzubeziehen.
<P>
Der Tabak ist in Europa der Killer Nummer eins. Im letzten Jahr
hat er allein in der Europ&auml;ischen Region der WHO 1,2 Mio.
Menschen umgebracht. Das sind 14% aller Todesf&auml;lle. Knapp
die H&auml;lfte aller erwachsenen M&auml;nner und ein Viertel
der Frauen in der Europ&auml;ischen Region der WHO rauchen t&auml;glich.
Die Zahl der jungen Menschen, die zu Rauchern werden, nimmt in
der gesamten Region zu. Weil Nikotin so s&uuml;chtig macht, werden
diese jungen Menschen durchschnittlich 20&nbsp;Jahre rauchen,
wenn sie erst einmal damit angefangen haben.

<P>
,,Angesichts dieses enormen gesundheitlichen Risikos und des beunruhigenden
Trends,&quot; erkl&auml;rt Dr. Peter Anderson, WHO-Regionalbeauftragter
f&uuml;r das Programm Tabak oder Gesundheit, ,,muss mit sehr viel
krasseren Ma&szlig;nahmen versucht werden, die jungen Menschen
daran zu hindern, zu Rauchern zu werden, und zu gew&auml;hrleisten,
dass die Gesundheitsberufe gen&uuml;gend wissen und den Menschen
helfend zur Seite stehen, wenn sie aus ihrer Nikotinsucht ausbrechen
wollen.&quot;

<P>
Durch Plakate, schriftliches Material und Ratschl&auml;ge f&uuml;r
Raucher, die nach rezeptpflichtigen und rezeptfreien Arzneimitteln
f&uuml;r durch das Rauchen bedingte Probleme fragen, konnten die
Apotheker in ganz Europa das Bewusstsein f&uuml;r die gesundheitlichen
Risiken des Rauchens erfolgreich sch&auml;rfen und den Rauchern
helfen, das Rauchen aufzugeben. Das EuroPharm Forum baut auf diesen
Erfolgen auf, indem es die brauchbaren Lehren in praktische Schulungsmaterialien
aufnimmt. Das neue Handbuch des Forums <I>The role of the pharmacist
in smoking cessation</I>, erscheint als Brosch&uuml;re in der
WHO-Schriftenreihe, Europa nikotinfrei.
<P>
"Jeder Raucher sollte die M&ouml;glichkeit haben zu begreifen,
dass er das Rauchen aufgeben kann und daf&uuml;r Unterst&uuml;tzung
zur Verf&uuml;gung steht&quot;, erkl&auml;rt Dr. Jo Asvall, WHO-Regionaldirektor
f&uuml;r Europa. ,,Die Apotheker als bestens ausgebildete und
leicht ansprechbare Mitglieder des f&uuml;r die prim&auml;re Gesundheitsversorgung
zust&auml;ndigen Teams sind in der idealen Lage, diese Gewissheit
vermitteln und Unterst&uuml;tzung leisten zu k&ouml;nnen&quot;.
<HR>

<P>
<H3>Die Apothekercharta zu Ma&szlig;nahmen
gegen das Rauchen
</H3>
fordert die Apotheker auf, ihren Beitrag zu einem rauchfreien
Europa zu leisten, und zwar indem sie:
<UL>
<LI>eine Vorbildrolle &uuml;bernehmen;
<LI>das Rauchen in der Apotheke verbieten, um die Risiken des
Passivrauchens, insbesondere f&uuml;r die schw&auml;chsten Gruppen,
u.&nbsp;a. kleine Kinder und Asthmatiker, abzuwehren;
<LI>die gesundheitlichen Risiken des Rauchens hervorheben;
<LI>Raucher dazu ermutigen, das Rauchen aufzugeben;
<LI>Rauchern, die das Rauchen aufgeben m&ouml;chten, mit Rat,
Hilfe und Unterst&uuml;tzung zur Seite stehen und
<LI>die Regierungen eindringlich bitten, die Werbung f&uuml;r
Tabakprodukte zu verbieten.

Press release EURO/03/97<BR>
January 1997
<P>
<I>Simultaneously issued from Copenhagen and Sarajevo
</I>
<H2> Expired drugs in Mostar to be recovered and made safe
</H2>


Hazardous waste and pharmaceutical experts, coordinated by the
World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe, have
begun sorting through 200 tonnes of out-dated and unusable drugs
stockpiled in Mostar. Over the next two months, teams of local
and international specialists will segregate, re-package, label
and safely store potentially harmful items while acceptable disposal
routes are identified.

<P>
&quot;During the war, large quantities of drugs and medical supplies
were donated by companies, [nongovernmental organizations] and
individuals from many well meaning groups to the people of Bosnia
and Herzegovina,&quot; explains Tim Grayling, Public Health Engineer,
WHO Office for Humanitarian Assistance - Bosnia and Herzegovina.
&quot;Unfortunately, some of these donations arrived unannounced,
unlabeled, with different types of medicines in the same boxes,
some out-of-date, some half used, and often without any supporting
documentation. Overworked national pharmacists in Mostar simply
could not process the huge volume of donations. Some of the drugs
destined for elsewhere in central Bosnia and Herzegovina were
held up in Mostar by the regular interruption of humanitarian
convoys. As a result, large volumes of pharmaceutical materials
accumulated in warehouses in and around East and West Mostar.&quot;


<P>
In early 1996, Pharmaciens sans fronti&egrave;res (PSF) and WHO
initiated a drugs management programme in Mostar, which resulted
in all new donations being strictly processed and correctly utilized.
WHO international guidelines for drug donations were adopted by
major donors and aid organizations in May 1996. The ever-increasing
growth of stockpiles has since been stopped.

<P>
&quot;Indiscriminate disposal of current stockpiles could pose
a very real risk to local public health and to the environment,&quot;
states Ren&eacute; Kersauze, Director, Nancy Project Office (France),
WHO European Centre for Environment and health. &quot;If not properly
disposed of, hazardous materials could contaminate water resources
and soil.&quot;

<P>
The Mostar programme, funded by the European Community Humanitarian
Office (ECHO) and the Overseas Development Administration of the
United Kingdom, will make safe, prior to disposal, any hazardous
waste that is found.

<P>
In addition, WHO has prepared guidelines for the disposal of pharmaceuticals
in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Adoption of these guidelines is currently
being considered by the health ministries in both the Federation
and Republika Srpska.

<P>
At present, no specialized facilities for chemical waste treatment
or incineration exist in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The guidelines
provide advice on potentially feasible methods of sorting and
disposing of the estimated total of 800 tonnes of expired drugs,
using resources that could be made available in the country. This
quantity represents primarily the remainder of the many thousands
of tonnes of drugs that were donated and used to save many lives
during the war.

Copenhague, janvier 1997
<P>
<I>Diffus&eacute; simultan&eacute;ment depuis Copenhague et Sarajevo

</I>
<H2>Des experts pr&eacute;parent l'&eacute;limination de tonnes

de m&eacute;dicaments p&eacute;rim&eacute;s &agrave; Mostar
</H2>


Des sp&eacute;cialistes des d&eacute;chets dangereux et des pharmacologues,
dont les travaux sont coordonn&eacute;s par le Bureau r&eacute;gional
de l'Europe de l'Organisation mondiale de la sant&eacute; (OMS),
ont commenc&eacute; &agrave; trier 200&nbsp;tonnes de m&eacute;dicaments
p&eacute;rim&eacute;s et inutilisables entrepos&eacute;s &agrave;
Mostar. Au cours des deux mois &agrave; venir, des &eacute;quipes
de sp&eacute;cialistes locaux et internationaux proc&eacute;deront
au tri, au remballage, &agrave; l'&eacute;tiquetage et &agrave;
l'entreposage dans de bonnes conditions de s&eacute;curit&eacute;
de m&eacute;dicaments potentiellement dangereux. Pendant ce temps,
on d&eacute;finira des m&eacute;thodes acceptables pour l'&eacute;limination
de ces produits.

<P>
&#171;Pendant la guerre, des entreprises, [des organisations non
gouvernementales] et des particuliers faisant partie de nombreuses
associations bien intentionn&eacute;es ont donn&eacute; de grandes
quantit&eacute;s de m&eacute;dicaments et de fournitures m&eacute;dicales
au peuple de Bosnie-Herz&eacute;govine&#187;, explique Tim Grayling,
ing&eacute;nieur de sant&eacute; publique du Bureau de l'aide
humanitaire de l'OMS - Bosnie-Herz&eacute;govine. &#171;Malheureusement,
certains de ces dons sont arriv&eacute;s sans avis pr&eacute;alable,
non &eacute;tiquet&eacute;s, avec diff&eacute;rents types de m&eacute;dicaments
dans la m&ecirc;me bo&icirc;te, certains p&eacute;rim&eacute;s,
d'autres &agrave; moiti&eacute; utilis&eacute;s, et souvent sans
notices ou autres documents. Les pharmaciens locaux de Mostar
&eacute;taient surcharg&eacute;s de travail et ne pouvaient pas
traiter l'&eacute;norme volume des dons. Certains m&eacute;dicaments
destin&eacute;s &agrave; d'autres localit&eacute;s de Bosnie-Herz&eacute;govine
centrale ont &eacute;t&eacute; bloqu&eacute;s &agrave; Mostar
en raison de l'interruption r&eacute;guli&egrave;re de l'acheminement
des fournitures humanitaires. De ce fait, de grandes quantit&eacute;s
de produits pharmaceutiques se sont accumul&eacute;es dans des
entrep&ocirc;ts de Mostar Est et Ouest et des environs.&#187;


<P>
Au d&eacute;but de 1996, Pharmaciens sans fronti&egrave;res et
l'OMS ont lanc&eacute; un programme de prise en charge des m&eacute;dicaments
&agrave; Mostar, ce qui a permis de proc&eacute;der &agrave; un
traitement appropri&eacute; et &agrave; une utilisation judicieuse
de tous les nouveaux dons. Les r&egrave;gles internationales de
l'OMS concernant les dons de m&eacute;dicaments ont &eacute;t&eacute;
adopt&eacute;es par les principaux donateurs et les grandes organisations
d'aide en mai 1996. Depuis lors, l'augmentation constante des
stocks a cess&eacute;.
<P>
&#171;L'&eacute;limination sans discernement des stocks actuels
pourrait cr&eacute;er des risques tr&egrave;s r&eacute;els pour
la sant&eacute; publique locale et pour l'environnement&#187;,
indique Ren&eacute; Kersauze, directeur du Bureau de projets de
Nancy (France), qui fait partie du Centre europ&eacute;en de l'environnement
et de la sant&eacute; de l'OMS. &#171;Si on ne les &eacute;limine
pas de fa&ccedil;on convenable, les produits dangereux pourraient
contaminer les ressources en eau et le sol.&#187;

<P>
Le programme de Mostar, financ&eacute; par l'Office humanitaire
de la Communaut&eacute; europ&eacute;enne et l'Administration
de la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement du Royaume-Uni,
permettra de rendre inoffensifs tous les d&eacute;chets dangereux
trouv&eacute;s, qui seront ensuite &eacute;limin&eacute;s.

<P>
En outre, l'OMS a &eacute;labor&eacute; des r&egrave;gles concernant
l'&eacute;limination des m&eacute;dicaments en Bosnie-Herz&eacute;govine.
L'adoption de ces r&egrave;gles est actuellement envisag&eacute;e
par les minist&egrave;res de la sant&eacute; de la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration
et de la Republika Srpska.

<P>
Actuellement, il n'existe pas d'installations sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;es
pour le traitement ou l'incin&eacute;ration des d&eacute;chets
chimiques en Bosnie-Herz&eacute;govine. Les r&egrave;gles susmentionn&eacute;es
&eacute;noncent des conseils sur les m&eacute;thodes qui peuvent
&ecirc;tre utilis&eacute;es pour trier et &eacute;liminer l'ensemble
des m&eacute;dicaments p&eacute;rim&eacute;s, estim&eacute; &agrave;
800&nbsp;tonnes, en recourant aux ressources qui pourraient &ecirc;tre
fournies aux pays. Cette quantit&eacute; repr&eacute;sente essentiellement
ce qui reste des milliers de tonnes de m&eacute;dicaments qui
ont &eacute;t&eacute; donn&eacute;s et utilis&eacute;s pour sauver
de nombreuses vies pendant la guerre.

Pressemitteilung EURO/03/97<BR>
 Januar 1997
<P>
<I>Geht gleichzeitig in Kopenhagen
und Sarajewo an die Presse
</I>
<H2>Veraltete Arzneimittel in Mostar sollen gefunden und
sicher gemacht werden
</H2>

Koordiniert vom Regionalb&uuml;ro f&uuml;r
Europa der Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) sortieren Experten
f&uuml;r Sonderm&uuml;ll und Arzneimittel in Mostar 200 Tonnen
dort gelagerte unbrauchbare Arzneimittel, deren G&uuml;ltigkeitsdauer
abgelaufen ist. W&auml;hrend der n&auml;chsten beiden Monate werden
einheimische und internationale Spezialistenteams potentiell sch&auml;dliche
Arzneimittel entmischen, neu verpacken, etikettieren und sicher
lagern, w&auml;hrend man zugleich nach unbedenklichen Entsorgungswegen
sucht.
<P>
&quot;W&auml;hrend des Krieges wurden von Unternehmen,
nichtstaatlichen Organisationen und Einzelpersonen den Menschen
von Bosnien-Herzegowina in bester Absicht gro&szlig;e Mengen Arzneimittel
und medizinische Ausr&uuml;stung gespendet&quot;, erkl&auml;rt
Tim Grayling, Hygieneingenieur im WHO-B&uuml;ro f&uuml;r Humanit&auml;re
Hilfe in Bosnien-Herzegowina. ,,Leider kamen einige Spenden unangemeldet,
unetikettiert, mit unterschiedlichen Arzneimitteln in den gleichen
Kartons, einige waren bereits veraltet, andere halb aufgebraucht,
oft fehlte jegliche Art von Beipackzettel. Die &uuml;berarbeiteten
Apotheker in Mostar konnten mit der ungeheuren Spendenmenge einfach
nicht fertig werden. Einige Arzneimittel, die f&uuml;r andere
Orte in Bosnien-Herzegowina bestimmt waren, wurden durch die dauernde
Unterbrechung der humanit&auml;ren Konvoiversorgung in Mostar
zur&uuml;ck gehalten, weshalb sich in den Lagerh&auml;usern in
und um Ost- und West-Mostar gro&szlig;e Mengen pharmazeutischer
Materialien angesammelt haben.&quot;
<P>
Anfang 1996 regten die Pharmaciens sans fronti&egrave;res
(PSF) und die WHO in Mostar ein Managementprogramm f&uuml;r Arzneimittel an, was dazu f&uuml;hrte, dass
alle neuen Spenden genauestens gehandhabt und korrekt genutzt
wurden. Im Mai 1996 nahmen die wichtigsten Geber und Hilfsorganisationen
die von der WHO herausgegebenen internationalen Leitlinien f&uuml;r
Arzneimittelspenden an. Seither t&uuml;rmen sich keine neuen Lagerbest&auml;nde
mehr auf.
<P>
"Die undurchdachte Beseitigung der derzeitigen
Best&auml;nde k&ouml;nnte die Gesundheit der Bev&ouml;lkerung
und die Umwelt vor Ort ernstlich gef&auml;hrden&quot;, so Ren&eacute;
Kersauze, Direktor des Projektb&uuml;ros in Nancy (Frankreich)
des Europ&auml;ischen WHO-Zentrums f&uuml;r Umwelt und Gesundheit.
,,Wenn die gef&auml;hrlichen Materialien nicht korrekt entsorgt
werden, k&ouml;nnten sie Wasservorr&auml;te und Boden kontaminieren.&quot;

<P>
Durch das vom Amt f&uuml;r Humanit&auml;re
Hilfe (ECHO) der Europ&auml;ischen Gemeinschaft und der Overseas
Development Administration, dem Amt f&uuml;r internationale Entwicklungshilfe,
des Vereinigten K&ouml;nigreichs finanzierte Programm werden alle
gefundenen gef&auml;hrlichen Abf&auml;lle vor ihrer Entsorgung
gesichert.
<P>
Dar&uuml;ber hinaus hat die WHO Leitlinien
f&uuml;r die Arzneimittelentsorgung in Bosnien-Herzegowina ausgearbeitet.
Zur Zeit erw&auml;gen die Gesundheitsministerien des Bundes wie
der Republik Srpska eine &Uuml;bernahme dieser Leitlinien.
<P>
Gegenw&auml;rtig gibt es in Bosnien-Herzegowina
keine gesonderten Einrichtungen f&uuml;r die Handhabung oder Verbrennung
chemischer Abf&auml;lle. Die Leitlinien dienen als Orientierungshilfe
&uuml;ber potentiell praktikable Methoden zur Sortierung und Entsorgung
der sch&auml;tzungsweise insgesamt 800 Tonnen veralteter Arzneimittel,
und zwar mit landeseigenen Ressourcen. Diese Menge besteht haupts&auml;chlich
aus dem Rest der Tausende von Tonnen Arzneimittelspenden, die
w&auml;hrend des Krieges viele Leben gerettet haben.

Press release EURO/01/96<BR>
Copenhagen, May 1996

<H1>Tobacco confirmed as the number one killer in Europe
</H1>


New data from the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office
for Europe confirm that tobacco is the number one killer in Europe.
Last year, tobacco killed 1.2 million people in the WHO European
Region (population: 850 million) alone. This is 14% or 1 in 7
of all deaths.  But the figures mask a huge difference between
the western and eastern halves of the Region.  In eastern Europe,
tobacco will kill 1 in 5 men aged 35 before they reach the age
of 69 - this figure is twice as high as that for western Europe.
But tobacco is not just a problem for eastern Europe. Tobacco
kills the highest number of women in the western part of the Region.
For example, of all the Danish women who currently die between
35 and 69 years of age, it is estimated that one third of the
deaths are attributable to smoking.

<P>
In the WHO European Region, just under one half of all adult men
and one quarter of women are daily smokers. These figures are
higher in the eastern half of the Region, where rates of smoking
are increasing for both men and women. Although the number of
adult smokers is falling in the western countries, the number
of young people who are starting to smoke is rising throughout
the Region. One in five 15-year-old boys and girls are cigarette
smokers. Because nicotine is so addictive, once these young people
start to smoke, they will continue for an average of 20 years
before they quit.

<P>
In the face of this enormous health crisis, much firmer action
needs to be taken to prevent young people from starting to smoke
and to ensure that public opinion demands stronger measures against
tobacco.

<P>
It is no longer acceptable to allow the marketing of tobacco products
through any form of advertising or sponsorship.  Other ways of
controlling the epidemic are to ensure that cigarettes are expensive
and to make as many public places as possible smoke free.


<HR>

<P>
<CENTER><H3>World No-Tobacco Day</H3></CENTER>

Every year the World Health Organization invites people all over the world to focus on issues related to tobacco or health on 31 May, which has been designated by the World Health Assembly as World No-Tobacco Day. The celebration of World No-Tobacco Day aims at encouraging governments, communities, groups and individuals to become aware of the problems caused by the use of tobacco, especially among young people, and to take appropriate action to combat this harmful behaviour.  This year, the theme "Sport and the arts without tobacco" offers an opportunity to mobilize athletes, artists and the media in support of WHOs objective of promoting a society and a way of life where tobacco use is no longer an accepted norm.

Communiqu&eacute; de presse EURO/01/96
<BR>
Copenhague, mai 1996


<H1>Le tabac, le plus s&ucirc;r moyen de mourir &agrave; petit
feu</H1>


Des donn&eacute;es toutes r&eacute;centes recueillies par le Bureau
r&eacute;gional de l'Europe de l'Organisation mondiale de la sant&eacute;
(OMS) confirment que le tabac est la premi&egrave;re cause de
d&eacute;c&egrave;s en Europe.  L'ann&eacute;e derni&egrave;re,
le tabagisme a tu&eacute; 1&nbsp;200&nbsp;000 personnes en Europe.
 Cela repr&eacute;sente 14% des d&eacute;c&egrave;s, ou 1 d&eacute;c&egrave;s
sur 7.  En fait, ces chiffres recouvrent des diff&eacute;rences
consid&eacute;rables entre l'Europe occidentale et l'Europe orientale.
 En Europe orientale, un homme sur cinq &acirc;g&eacute; aujourd'hui
de 35 ans mourra &agrave; cause du tabac avant d'atteindre l'&acirc;ge
de 69 ans.  C'est deux fois plus qu'en Europe occidentale.


<P>
Pourtant, les pays d'Europe occidentale n'ont pas de quoi pavoiser:
le tabac y est la principale cause de d&eacute;c&egrave;s chez
les femmes.  Au Danemark, par exemple, on estime qu'un tiers des
d&eacute;c&egrave;s de femmes dans le groupe d'&acirc;ge des 35-69
ans sont dus au tabagisme.


<P>
 En Europe, un peu moins de la moiti&eacute; des hommes et un
quart des femmes fument r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement.  Les chiffres
sont plus &eacute;lev&eacute;s en Europe orientale, o&ugrave;
les taux de tabagisme augmentent tant pour les hommes que pour
les femmes.  Le nombre d'adultes qui fument est en r&eacute;gression
dans les pays d'Europe occidentale, mais le nombre de jeunes qui
commencent &agrave; fumer augmente dans l'Europe tout enti&egrave;re.
 Un jeune de 15 ans sur cinq fume des cigarettes.  Comme la nicotine
cr&eacute;e une d&eacute;pendance, les jeunes qui fument resteront
accroch&eacute;s pendant 20 ans en moyenne.

<P>


Face &agrave; cette calamit&eacute;, il faut agir beaucoup plus
&eacute;nergiquement pour dissuader les jeunes d'allumer la premi&egrave;re
cigarette et convaincre l'opinion publique d'exiger des mesures
plus efficaces pour lutter contre le tabagisme.

<P>
La promotion du tabac par la publicit&eacute; ou le parrainage
est devenue intol&eacute;rable.  En outre, il faut veiller &agrave;
ce que le tabac soit cher et interdire autant que possible le
tabagisme dans les lieux publics.

<H3><CENTER>La Journ&eacute;e mondiale sans tabac<BR>
</CENTER></H3>

<P>
<I>Le 31 mai de chaque ann&eacute;e, l'Organisation mondiale
de la sant&eacute; demande &agrave; tous les habitants de la plan&egrave;te
de r&eacute;fl&eacute;chir aux probl&egrave;mes pos&eacute;s par
le tabagisme.  La c&eacute;l&eacute;bration de la Journ&eacute;e
mondiale sans tabac est l'occasion de sensibiliser les pouvoirs
publics, les collectivit&eacute;s locales, le mouvement associatif
et les particuliers aux m&eacute;faits du tabagisme, en particulier

<H4>Press release EURO/02/96
<BR>
Copenhagen, June 1996
</H4>
<H2>First and foremost, health care reform must lead to better
health for people

</H2>


Cost containment alone provides an inadequate basis for sustainable
health care reform, advises the World Health Organization (WHO)
Regional Office for Europe. An expert report to be released at
the<B> WHO Conference on European Health Care Reforms </B> in
Ljubljana, Slovenia, on 17 June emphasizes the  importance of
 measuring the success of reform against long-term gains in health
status.

<P>
The WHO study found little evidence of positive economic effects
from encouraging citizens to choose among insurers or to make
co-payments. On the contrary, unless these demand-reducing approaches
are accompanied by &quot;protective&quot; regulation, they may
substantially reduce access  to necessary health services and
thus threaten the overall health of the population. <BR>

<P>
The WHO report concludes that the health care reforms most likely
to achieve social and economic success are those that focus on
changing behaviour on the <I>supply side: </I>that is, the behaviour
of hospitals and physicians. Health reforms that use strategies
such as global hospital budgeting and performance-based payments
for providers appear to be more successful in achieving economic
and social goals.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
One demand-side reform that the WHO study saw as positive was
efforts to enhance the role of citizens and patients. These measures
include legislation to protect the rights of patients, to enable
citizens' voices to be heard in the policy process, and to ensure
that patients have reliable information to use in making informed
choices of their  health care providers.

<P>
&quot;Reform measures will be judged not only by short-term savings
to public budgets, but also by their ability to promote health
and to generate health gain for the entire population,&quot; states
Jo E. Asvall, WHO Regional Director for Europe.
<P>
&quot;First and foremost health care must lead to better health
for people. This is  equally important in all countries of the
Region.&quot;

<P>
The study sets the stage for an intensified initiative by WHO
to assist policy-makers in surmounting the challenges facing European
health care systems.

<P>
The issues in the expert report will be taken up when ministerial-level
delegations from the 50 Member States of the WHO European Region
meet in Ljubljana, Slovenia, from 17 to 20 June 1996 at the <B>WHO
Conference on</B> <B>European Health Care Reforms</B>.   Ministers
will exchange experience, analyse actions to date and adopt a
charter that articulates a common set of principles and strategies.
<BR>

<P>
&quot;Health care systems throughout Europe are bustling with
change,&quot; notes Dr Bozidar Voljc, Minister of Health of the
Republic of Slovenia. &quot; It is important to communicate and
exchange experiences so that common problems can be tackled uniformly,
since no country has yet found an ideal solution.&quot;<BR>

<H4>Communiqu&eacute; de presse EURO/02/96
<BR>Copenhague, juin 1996
</H4>

<H2>L'objectif premier de la r&eacute;forme des syst&egrave;mes
de sant&eacute; est d'am&eacute;liorer la sant&eacute; de tout
un chacun
</H2>

<P>
A elle seule, la ma&icirc;trise des d&eacute;penses
ne permet pas de r&eacute;aliser une r&eacute;forme viable des
syst&egrave;mes de sant&eacute;.  C'est ce qui ressort d'une &eacute;tude
du Bureau r&eacute;gional de l'Europe de l'Organisation mondiale
de la sant&eacute;.  Cette &eacute;tude, qui sera rendue publique
le 17 juin prochain &agrave; Ljubljana (Slov&eacute;nie), lors
de la <B>Conf&eacute;rence de l'OMS sur la r&eacute;forme des
syst&egrave;mes de sant&eacute; en Europe</B>, souligne que le
succ&egrave;s de toute r&eacute;forme doit s'appr&eacute;cier
en fonction de l'am&eacute;lioration &agrave; long terme de la
sant&eacute; de la population.

<P>
 L'&eacute;tude de l'OMS montre que le libre choix entre plusieurs
assureurs et le syst&egrave;me du ticket mod&eacute;rateur ne
pr&eacute;sentent gu&egrave;re d'avantages &eacute;conomiques
pour la collectivit&eacute;.  En fait, si ces m&eacute;thodes
de r&eacute;duction de la demande ne vont pas de pair avec une
r&eacute;glementation protectrice, elles risquent de r&eacute;duire
consid&eacute;rablement l'acc&egrave;s &agrave; des services de
sant&eacute; n&eacute;cessaires et donc de mettre en p&eacute;ril
la sant&eacute; de la population.

<P>
 Cette &eacute;tude conclut que les r&eacute;formes des syst&egrave;mes
de sant&eacute; qui ont le plus de chances de donner de bons r&eacute;sultats
sur les plans &eacute;conomique et social sont celles qui agissent
sur l'offre, c'est-&agrave;-dire sur le comportement des h&ocirc;pitaux
et des m&eacute;decins.  L'exp&eacute;rience montre que des r&eacute;formes
telles que l'octroi aux h&ocirc;pitaux de budgets globaux ou la
r&eacute;mun&eacute;ration des dispensateurs de soins en fonction
des r&eacute;sultats sont celles qui ont le plus d'efficacit&eacute;
&eacute;conomique et sociale.
<P>
 L'&eacute;tude montre toutefois qu'il est possible d'agir utilement
au niveau de la demande, en donnant un r&ocirc;le plus important
aux citoyens et aux patients.  A cet effet, il faut l&eacute;gif&eacute;rer
pour prot&eacute;ger les droits des patients, donner aux citoyens
voix au chapitre lors de l'&eacute;laboration des politiques et
bien informer les patients pour leur permettre de choisir en connaissance
de cause ceux qui les soignent.
<P>

<P>
&quot;Au-del&agrave; des &eacute;conomies budg&eacute;taires &agrave;
court terme, les r&eacute;formes n'aboutiront que si elles se
traduisent par une am&eacute;lioration de la sant&eacute; de la
population tout enti&egrave;re&quot;, a d&eacute;clar&eacute;
le Dr&nbsp;Jo&nbsp;Asvall, directeur du Bureau r&eacute;gional
de l'OMS pour l'Europe.  &quot;L'objectif premier de la r&eacute;forme
est l'am&eacute;lioration de la sant&eacute; de tous.  Ce principe
est valable dans tous les pays d'Europe.&quot;

<P>
 L'&eacute;tude pr&eacute;cit&eacute;e permettra &agrave; l'OMS
d'intensifier les efforts qu'elle d&eacute;ploie pour aider les
responsables politiques &agrave; surmonter les probl&egrave;mes
auxquels sont confront&eacute;s les syst&egrave;mes de sant&eacute;
europ&eacute;ens.

<P>
Lors de la <B>Conf&eacute;rence de l'OMS
sur la r&eacute;forme des syst&egrave;mes de sant&eacute; en Europe</B>,
qui aura lieu &agrave; Ljubljana (Slov&eacute;nie) du 17 au 20
juin 1996, les d&eacute;l&eacute;gations de niveau minist&eacute;riel
des 50 Etats membres de la R&eacute;gion europ&eacute;enne de
l'OMS discuteront des questions abord&eacute;es dans l'&eacute;tude.
 Les ministres &eacute;changeront des donn&eacute;es d'exp&eacute;rience,
analyserons les mesures prises et adopteront une charte, qui &eacute;nonce
un ensemble de principes et de strat&eacute;gies.

<P>
 &quot;Dans toute l'Europe, les syst&egrave;mes de sant&eacute;
connaissent des changements consid&eacute;rables&quot;, a relev&eacute;
le Dr Bozidar Voljc, ministre de la sant&eacute; de la R&eacute;publique
de Slov&eacute;nie.  &quot;Il importe de confronter nos exp&eacute;riences
pour pouvoir nous attaquer aux probl&egrave;mes de fa&ccedil;on
uniforme, car aucun pays n'a encore trouv&eacute; de solution
id&eacute;ale.&quot;

<H4>Pressemitteilung EURO/02/96<BR>

Kopenhagen, Juni 1996
</H4>

<H2>Gesundheitsreform mu&szlig; in erster Linie den Menschen bessere
Gesundheit bringen
</H2>

<P>
Kostend&auml;mpfung allein bildet eine unzureichende Grundlage
f&uuml;r eine tragf&auml;hige Gesundheitsreform, so das Regionalb&uuml;ro
f&uuml;r Europa der Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO). Ein Expertenbericht,
der am 17.&nbsp;Juni zu der in Ljubljana, Slowenien, stattfindenden
<B>WHO-Konferenz Gesundheitsreformen in Europa</B> erscheint,
betont, da&szlig; es wichtig ist, den Reformerfolg an langfristigen
Verbesserungen des Gesundheitszustands zu messen.

<P>
Laut WHO-Studie spricht nur wenig f&uuml;r positive &ouml;konomische
Auswirkungen, wenn die Bev&ouml;lkerung angehalten wird, sich
zwischen verschiedenen Versicherungen zu entscheiden oder sich
durch Zuzahlungen an den Kosten der Versorgung zu beteiligen.
Diese nachfragereduzierenden Methoden k&ouml;nnten ganz im Gegenteil
den Zugang zu notwendigen gesundheitlichen Leistungen sogar erheblich
einschr&auml;nken und damit die Gesundheit der Bev&ouml;lkerung
insgesamt bedrohen, wenn sie nicht durch ,,Schutzbestimmungen&quot;
flankiert werden.<BR>

<P>
Der WHO-Bericht gelangt zu dem Schlu&szlig;, da&szlig; der soziale
und wirtschaftliche Erfolg von Gesundheitsreformen am ehesten
dann wahrscheinlich ist, wenn Reformen sich darauf konzentrieren,
das Verhalten auf der <I>Angebotsseite</I> zu &auml;ndern, d.&nbsp;h.
das Verhalten von Krankenh&auml;usern und &Auml;rzten. Gesundheitsreformen,
die Strategien wie z.&nbsp;B. eine globale Krankenhausbudgetierung
und leistungsbasierte Anbieterverg&uuml;tung einsetzen, scheinen
ihre wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Ziele erfolgreicher erreichen
zu k&ouml;nnen.

<P>
Eine in der WHO-Studie als positiv betrachtete Reform auf der
Nachfrageseite sind Bem&uuml;hungen, die Rolle der B&uuml;rger
und Patienten zu st&auml;rken. Zu diesen Ma&szlig;nahmen z&auml;hlen
Gesetze zum Schutz der Patientenrechte und andere, die es erm&ouml;glichen,
die Stimme des B&uuml;rgers im politischen Entscheidungsproze&szlig;
zu ber&uuml;cksichtigen und zu gew&auml;hrleisten, da&szlig; Patienten
verl&auml;&szlig;liche Informationen erhalten, die es ihnen erlauben,
sich ihre gesundheitlichen Leistungserbringer bewu&szlig;t auszuw&auml;hlen.

<P>
,,Reformma&szlig;nahmen werden sich nicht nur an kurzfristigen
Einsparungen im &ouml;ffentlichen Haushalt messen lassen m&uuml;ssen,
sondern auch daran, ob sie imstande sind, Gesundheit zu f&ouml;rdern
und f&uuml;r die gesamte Bev&ouml;lkerung ein Mehr an Gesundheit
zu bewirken&quot;, sagt Jo E. Asvall, WHO-Regionaldirektor f&uuml;r
Europa. ,,In erster Linie mu&szlig; Gesundheitsreform den Menschen
bessere Gesundheit bringen. Das ist f&uuml;r alle L&auml;nder
der Region gleich wichtig.&quot;

<P>
Die Studie dient als Grundlage einer verst&auml;rkten WHO-Initiative,
den politischen Entscheidungstr&auml;gern zu helfen, den Herausforderungen,
denen sich die europ&auml;ischen Gesundheitssysteme gegen&uuml;bersehen,
begegnen zu k&ouml;nnen.

<P>
Hochrangige ministerielle Delegationen aus den 50&nbsp;Mitgliedstaaten
der Europ&auml;ischen WHO-Region werden sich vom 17. bis 20. Juni
1996 in Ljubljana, Slowenien, bei der <B>WHO-Konferenz Gesundheitsreformen
in Europa</B> mit den Themenkomplexen des Expertenberichts auseinandersetzen.
Die Minister werden Erfahrungen austauschen, die bisherigen Ma&szlig;nahmen
analysieren und eine Charta verabschieden, in der gemeinsame Prinzipien
und Strategien niedergelegt sind.
<P>
"In ganz Europa arbeitet man intensiv an Reformen der Gesundheitssysteme,&quot;
stellt Dr.&nbsp;Bozidar&nbsp;Voljc, Minister f&uuml;r Gesundheit
der Republik Slowenien, fest. ,,Es ist wichtig, da&szlig; Erfahrungen
weitergegeben und ausgetauscht werden, damit gemeinsame Probleme
einheitlich angegangen werden k&ouml;nnen, denn bisher hat noch
kein Land eine Ideall&ouml;sung gefunden.&quot;

<H1><CENTER>The Ljubljana Charter<BR>
on<BR>
Reforming Health Care
</H1>

<H2>Final draft for endorsement</H2>

<H2>18 June 1996</CENTER></H2>

<HR>

<H2>Preamble</H2>

<OL>
<LI>The purpose of this Charter is to articulate a set of principles
which are an integral part of current health care systems or which
could improve health care in all the &nbsp;Member States of the
World Health Organization in the European Region. These principles
emerge from the experience of countries implementing health care
reforms and from the European health for all targets, especially
those related to health care systems.
<LI>This Charter addresses health care reforms in the specific
context of Europe and is centred on the principle that health
care should first and foremost lead to better health and quality
of life for people.
<LI>The improvements in the health status of the population are
an indicator of development in the society. Health services are
important, but they are not the only sector influencing peoples'
wellbeing: other sectors also have a contribution to make and
responsibility to bear in health, and intersectorality must therefore
be an essential feature of health care reform.
</OL>


4. <I>In cognizance of this, we the Ministers of Health or their
representatives from the European Member States of WHO (participants
in the Ljubljana Conference) hereby pledge ourselves to promote
the following principles and call upon all citizens and urge all
governments, institutions and communities to join us in this endeavour.
We further request the WHO Regional Office for Europe to take
the necessary action to support Member States in giving effect
to these principles.</I>
<P>
____________________________
<BR>
This document does not confer legal rights


<H2>Fundamental principles</H2>


5. Within the European context, health care systems need to be:

<H3>5.1 Driven by values</H3>


Health care reforms must be governed by principles of human dignity,
equity, solidarity and professional ethics.
<H3>5.2 Targeted on health</H3>


Any major health care reform should relate to clear targets for
health gain. The protection and promotion of health must be a
prime concern of all society.
<H3>5.3 Centred on people</H3>


Health care reforms must address citizens' needs taking into account,
through the democratic process, their expectations about health
and health care. They should ensure that the citizen's voice and
choice decisively influence the way in which health services are
designed and operate. Citizens must also share responsibility
for their own health.
<H3>5.4 Focused on quality</H3>


Any health care reform must have as its aim - and include a clear
strategy for - continuous improvement in the quality of the health
care delivered, including its cost-effectiveness.
<H3>5.5 Based on sound financing</H3>


 The financing of health care systems should enable such care
to be delivered to all citizens in a sustainable way. This entails
universal coverage and equitable access by all people to the necessary
care. That, in turn, requires the efficient use of health resources.
 To guarantee solidarity, governments must play a crucial role
in regulating the financing of health care systems.
<H3>5.6 Oriented towards primary health care</H3>


Reforms, with primary health care as a philosophy, should ensure
that health services at all levels protect and promote health,
improve the quality of life, prevent and treat diseases, rehabilitate
patients and care for the suffering and terminally ill. They should
reinforce joint decision-making by the patient and care provider
and promote the comprehensiveness and continuity of care within
their specific cultural environments.
<H2>Principles for managing change</H2>


6. The following principles are keys to managing change effectively:


<H3>6.1  Develop health policy</H3>


6.1.1  Health care reform should take place as a coherent part
of an overall policy for health for all which is consonant with
the socioeconomic conditions of each country. This policy development
process needs to be based on a broad consensus involving as many
relevant social actors as possible.
<P>
6.1.2  Major policy, managerial and technical decisions on development
of the health care system should be based on evidence where available.
Reforms must be continuously monitored and evaluated in a way
that is transparent to the public.
<P>
6.1.3  Governments must raise value-related issues for public
debate and ensure equitable distribution of resources and access
of the entire population to health services. They should also
take facilitating legislative and regulatory initiatives. Whenever
market mechanisms are appropriate, they should favour competition
in ensuring  quality and in using scarce resources.
<H3>6.2  Listen to the citizen's voice and choice</H3>


6.2.1  The citizen's voice and choice should make as significant
a contribution to shaping health care services as the decisions
taken at other levels of economic, managerial and professional
decision-making.
<P>
6.2.2  The citizen's voice should be heard on issues such as the
content of health care, contracting, quality of services in the
provider/patient relationship, the management of waiting lists
and the handling of complaints.
<P>
6.2.3  The exercise of choice and of other patients' rights, requires
extensive, accurate and timely information and education. This
entails access to publicly verified information on health services'
performance.
<H3>6.3  Reshape health care delivery</H3>


6.3.1  Self care, family care and other informal care, as well
as the work of a variety of social institutions, need to be brought
closer together with the formal health care services. This requires
continuous communication and appropriate referral and information
systems.
<P>
6.3.2  Well designed strategies are needed to shift working capacity
from acute hospital care to primary health care, community care,
day care and home care, whenever necessary.
<P>
6.3.3  Regional health service networks need to be reinforced
insofar as they are more cost-effective, allow for a better organization
of the response to medical emergencies and facilitate cooperation
between hospitals and  with primary health care.
<P>
6.3.4  Continuous quality development in health care requires
information systems based on selected quality indicators that
can be abstracted from routine work and fed back to individual
physicians, nurses and other health care providers.
<H3>6.4  Reorient human resources for health care</H3>


6.4.1  In the health services, greater attention needs to be paid
to identifying and stimulating appropriate professional profiles
that can be part of the multi-professional teams of tomorrow's
health care systems.
<P>
6.4.2  There is a need for a broader vision than that of traditional
curative care in the basic training, specialization and continuing
education of health care personnel. Quality of care, disease prevention
and health promotion should be an integral part of training.
<P>
6.4.3  Proper incentives should be introduced to encourage health
personnel to be more conscious of quality, cost and  outcomes
of care. Professional and payment organizations should cooperate
actively with health authorities to promote such a development.
<H3>6.5  Strengthen management</H3>


6.5.1 <B> </B>There is a need to develop a set of managerial functions
and public health infrastructures entrusted with the tasks of
guiding or influencing the overall system to achieve the desired
improvements in the population's health.
<P>
6.5.2  Individual health care institutions should enjoy the maximum
possible autonomy in management of their resources consistent
with the principles of an equitable and efficient health care
system.
<P>
6.5.3 Management development needs to be strongly promoted by
strengthening individual capacities to lead, negotiate and communicate
and by developing institutional tools to deliver health care more
effectively and efficiently.
<H3>6.6  Learn from experience</H3>


6.6.1  There is a need to promote the national and international
exchange of experience with implementing health care reform and
supporting reform initiatives.
<P>
6.6.2  This support must be founded on a well validated knowledge
base with regard to health care reforms, with cross-cultural differences
in health care being properly understood and appropriately valued.

<H1>La Charte de Ljubljana <BR>
sur la r&eacute;forme <BR>
des syst&egrave;mes de sant&eacute;</H1>

<H3>18 juin 1996</H3>
</center>
Note: Le pr&eacute;sent document ne conf&egrave;re pas de droits
juridiques.<BR>

<H2>Pr&eacute;ambule</H2>

1. La pr&eacute;sente Charte a pour objet de d&eacute;finir un
ensemble de principes s'int&eacute;grant aux syst&egrave;mes de
sant&eacute; existants ou permettant d'am&eacute;liorer les soins
de sant&eacute; dans tous les &Eacute;tats membres europ&eacute;ens
de l'Organisation mondiale de la sant&eacute;. Ces principes se
fondent sur l'exp&eacute;rience acquise par les pays dans la mise
en oeuvre de la r&eacute;forme des syst&egrave;mes de sant&eacute;
et sur la strat&eacute;gie europ&eacute;enne de la Sant&eacute;
pour tous, en particulier sur les buts relatifs aux syst&egrave;mes
de sant&eacute;.
<P>
2. La Charte envisage la r&eacute;forme des syst&egrave;mes de
sant&eacute; dans le contexte particulier de l'Europe et est centr&eacute;e
sur le principe selon lequel les syst&egrave;mes de sant&eacute;
ont avant tout pour objectif d'am&eacute;liorer l'&eacute;tat
de sant&eacute; et la qualit&eacute; de vie des individus.
<P>
3. L'am&eacute;lioration de l'&eacute;tat de sant&eacute; de la
population est un indicateur du d&eacute;veloppement de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;.
Les services de sant&eacute; jouent un r&ocirc;le important, mais
ne sont pas les seuls &agrave; avoir un impact sur le bien-&ecirc;tre
des individus : d'autres secteurs ont aussi une contribution &agrave;
apporter et une responsabilit&eacute; &agrave; assumer en mati&egrave;re
de sant&eacute;. L'intersectorialit&eacute; doit donc &ecirc;tre
l'un des &eacute;l&eacute;ments essentiels de la r&eacute;forme
des syst&egrave;mes de sant&eacute;.
<OL>
<LI><I>Conscients de ce qui pr&eacute;c&egrave;de, Nous, ministres
de la sant&eacute; des &Eacute;tats membres europ&eacute;ens de
l'Organisation mondiale de la sant&eacute; ou leurs repr&eacute;sentants,
participant &agrave; la Conf&eacute;rence de Ljubljana, nous engageons
par la pr&eacute;sente Charte &agrave; promouvoir les principes
suivants et invitons tous les citoyens, gouvernements, &eacute;tablissements
et collectivit&eacute;s &agrave; se joindre &agrave; cette initiative.
Nous prions en outre le Bureau r&eacute;gional de l'OMS pour l'Europe
de prendre les mesures n&eacute;cessaires pour aider les &Eacute;tats
membres &agrave; donner effet &agrave; ces principes.</I>
</OL>

<H2>Principes fondamentaux</H2>


5. Dans le contexte europ&eacute;en, les syst&egrave;mes de sant&eacute;
doivent reposer sur les principes suivants&nbsp;:
<H3>5.1 Un &eacute;l&eacute;ment moteur : les valeurs fondamentales
</H3>


La r&eacute;forme des syst&egrave;mes de sant&eacute; doit &ecirc;tre
guid&eacute;e par les valeurs fondamentales que sont la dignit&eacute;
humaine, l'&eacute;quit&eacute;, la solidarit&eacute; et l'&eacute;thique
professionnelle.
<H3>5.2 Un objectif : la sant&eacute;</H3>

<P>
Toute r&eacute;forme importante devrait se fixer des objectifs
clairs d'am&eacute;lioration de la sant&eacute;. La protection
et la promotion de la sant&eacute; doivent &ecirc;tre les pr&eacute;occupations
majeures de l'ensemble de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;.
<H3>5.3 Un acteur essentiel : l'individu</H3>

<P>
La r&eacute;forme des syst&egrave;mes de sant&eacute; doit r&eacute;pondre
aux besoins des citoyens en tenant compte, dans le cadre du processus
d&eacute;mocratique, de leurs attentes en mati&egrave;re de sant&eacute;
et de soins. L'opinion et le choix des citoyens doivent pouvoir
exercer une influence d&eacute;cisive sur la fa&ccedil;on dont
les services de sant&eacute; sont con&ccedil;us et fonctionnent.
Les citoyens doivent aussi partager la responsabilit&eacute; de
leur propre sant&eacute;.
<H3>5.4 Un p&ocirc;le de convergence : la qualit&eacute;</H3>


Toute r&eacute;forme des syst&egrave;mes de sant&eacute; doit
avoir pour objectif d'am&eacute;liorer de mani&egrave;re constante
la qualit&eacute; des soins dispens&eacute;s, y compris leur rapport
co&ucirc;t-efficacit&eacute;, et doit comporter &agrave; cet effet
une strat&eacute;gie claire.
<H3>5.5 Un mode de financement viable</H3>


Le financement des syst&egrave;mes de sant&eacute; doit permettre
que les soins soient dispens&eacute;s &agrave; tous de mani&egrave;re
viable. Cela signifie, pour chaque individu, le droit au paiement
des prestations et l'acc&egrave;s &eacute;quitable aux soins,
d'o&ugrave; la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'une utilisation rationnelle
des ressources. Les gouvernements doivent, pour garantir la solidarit&eacute;,
participer activement &agrave; la r&eacute;glementation du financement
des syst&egrave;mes de sant&eacute;.
<H3>5.6 Un &eacute;l&eacute;ment fondamental : les soins de sant&eacute;
primaires</H3>


Les auteurs de la r&eacute;forme doivent, en s'inspirant de la
philosophie des soins de sant&eacute; primaires, veiller &agrave;
ce que les services de sant&eacute; assurent, &agrave; tous les
niveaux,  la protection et l'am&eacute;lioration de la sant&eacute;,
l'am&eacute;lioration de la qualit&eacute; de la vie, la pr&eacute;vention
et le traitement des maladies, la r&eacute;adaptation des patients
et la prise en charge des personnes souffrantes et en fin de vie.
La r&eacute;forme doit faciliter la prise conjointe de d&eacute;cisions
par le patient et le prestataire et renforcer le caract&egrave;re
global et continu des soins compte tenu des particularit&eacute;s
de chaque environnement culturel.
<H2>Principes de gestion de la r&eacute;forme</H2>


6. Les principes suivants sont les cl&eacute;s d'une gestion efficace
de la r&eacute;forme :
<H3>6.1 D&eacute;velopper la politique de sant&eacute;</H3>

6.1.1 La r&eacute;forme d'un syst&egrave;me de sant&eacute; doit
s'int&eacute;grer de mani&egrave;re coh&eacute;rente dans une
politique globale de sant&eacute; pour tous s'accordant avec la
situation socio-&eacute;conomique de chaque pays. Ce processus
de d&eacute;veloppement doit reposer sur un large consensus associant
le plus grand nombre possible d'acteurs sociaux int&eacute;ress&eacute;s.
<P>
6.1.2 Les d&eacute;cisions politiques, administratives et techniques
importantes relatives &agrave; l'&eacute;laboration du syst&egrave;me
de sant&eacute; doivent se fonder, dans toute la mesure possible,
sur des &eacute;l&eacute;ments concrets. La r&eacute;forme doit
faire l'objet d'une surveillance et d'une &eacute;valuation permanentes
s'op&eacute;rant de fa&ccedil;on transparente pour le public.
<P>
6.1.3 Les gouvernements doivent susciter un d&eacute;bat g&eacute;n&eacute;ral
sur les valeurs &agrave; respecter, et assurer une r&eacute;partition
&eacute;quitable des ressources ainsi que l'acc&egrave;s de tous
aux services de sant&eacute;. Ils doivent aussi prendre des mesures
l&eacute;gislatives et r&eacute;glementaires allant dans ce sens.
Chaque fois que des m&eacute;canismes de march&eacute; peuvent
&ecirc;tre mis en oeuvre, ceux-ci doivent favoriser la concurrence
afin d'optimaliser la qualit&eacute; et l'utilisation des rares
ressources.
<H3>6.2 Pr&ecirc;ter attention &agrave; l'opinion et au choix
des citoyens</H3>


6.2.1 L'opinion et le choix des citoyens doivent contribuer autant
&agrave; la conception des services de sant&eacute; qu'aux d&eacute;cisions
prises aux autres niveaux - &eacute;conomique, administratif et
profes-sionnel.
<P>
6.2.2 La voix des citoyens doit se faire entendre sur des points
tels que le contenu des soins, la conclusion de contrats de services,
la qualit&eacute; de l'interaction prestataire/patient, la gestion
des listes d'attente et le suivi donn&eacute; aux r&eacute;clamations.
<P>
6.2.3 Les citoyens, pour pouvoir exercer un choix et leurs droits
en tant que patients, doivent b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier de moyens
importants, corrects et opportuns d'information et d'&eacute;ducation.
Cela signifie qu'ils doivent pouvoir acc&eacute;der &agrave; des
informations publiquement v&eacute;rifi&eacute;es concernant le
fonctionnement des services de sant&eacute;.
<H3>6.3 Restructurer les services de sant&eacute;</H3>


6.3.1 Les activit&eacute;s d'auto-prise en charge, de soins familiaux
et non structur&eacute;s, ainsi que celles des diverses institutions
sociales, doivent davantage &ecirc;tre mises en accord avec celles
des services de sant&eacute; structur&eacute;s. Il faut pour cela
entretenir des contacts suivis et disposer de syst&egrave;mes
d'orientation et d'information appropri&eacute;s.
<P>
6.3.2 Des strat&eacute;gies bien con&ccedil;ues doivent &ecirc;tre
mises au point pour transf&eacute;rer, chaque fois que cela est
n&eacute;cessaire, les moyens des soins d'aigu hospitaliers vers
les soins de sant&eacute; primaires, les soins de proximit&eacute;,
les soins ambulatoires et les soins &agrave; domicile.
<P>
6.3.3 Les r&eacute;seaux r&eacute;gionaux de services de sant&eacute;
doivent &ecirc;tre renforc&eacute;s lorsqu'ils offrent un meilleur
rapport co&ucirc;t-efficacit&eacute;, permettent de mieux faire
face aux urgences m&eacute;dicales et facilitent la coop&eacute;ration
entre les h&ocirc;pitaux et avec les soins de sant&eacute; primaires.
<P>
6.3.4 Pour pouvoir am&eacute;liorer de mani&egrave;re continue
la qualit&eacute; des soins, il faut disposer de syst&egrave;mes
d'information reposant sur des indicateurs choisis de qualit&eacute;
des soins &eacute;tablis &agrave; partir des activit&eacute;s
courantes et communiqu&eacute;s en retour aux m&eacute;decins,
infirmi&egrave;res et autres prestataires de soins.
<H3>6.4 R&eacute;affecter les ressources humaines pour la sant&eacute;
</H3>

<P>
6.4.1 Dans les services de sant&eacute;, un effort doit &ecirc;tre
fait pour recenser et encourager les cat&eacute;gories professionnelles
les mieux &agrave; m&ecirc;me de prendre part aux &eacute;quipes
pluridisciplinaires des syst&egrave;mes de sant&eacute; de demain.
<P>
6.4.2 Il faut adopter, dans la formation de base, sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;e
et continue des personnels de sant&eacute;, une vision plus large
que celle des soins curatifs traditionnels. La qualit&eacute;
des soins, la pr&eacute;vention de la maladie et la promotion
de la sant&eacute; doivent faire partie int&eacute;grante de la
formation.
<P>
6.4.3 Des mesures d'incitation appropri&eacute;es devraient &ecirc;tre
mises en place pour encourager les personnels de sant&eacute;
&agrave; se pr&eacute;occuper davantage de la qualit&eacute;,
du co&ucirc;t et des r&eacute;sultats des soins. Les organismes
professionnels et de paiement devraient coop&eacute;rer activement
avec les respon-sables de la sant&eacute; publique pour favoriser
cette &eacute;volution.
<H3>6.5 Am&eacute;liorer la gestion</H3>


6.5.1 Il faut, si l'on veut r&eacute;aliser les am&eacute;liorations
souhait&eacute;es en mati&egrave;re de sant&eacute; de la population,
mettre au point un ensemble de fonctions administratives et d'infrastructures
de sant&eacute; publique charg&eacute;es de guider et d'orienter
l'ensemble du syst&egrave;me.
<P>
6.5.2 Les &eacute;tablissements de soins doivent jouir de la plus
grande autonomie possible dans la gestion de leurs ressources,
dans le respect des principes d'un syst&egrave;me de sant&eacute;
&eacute;quitable et efficace.
<P>
6.5.3 L'am&eacute;lioration de la gestion doit &ecirc;tre fermement
soutenue en renfor&ccedil;ant l'aptitude de chaque individu &agrave;
diriger, &agrave; n&eacute;gocier et &agrave; communiquer, et
en mettant au point des m&eacute;ca-nismes institutionnels permettant
de dispenser les soins de mani&egrave;re plus efficace et plus
rationnelle.
<H3>6.6 Tirer les enseignements de l'exp&eacute;rience</H3>

<P>
6.6.1 Il faut faciliter, au niveaux national et international,
l'&eacute;change de donn&eacute;es d'exp&eacute;rience concernant
la mise en oeuvre de la r&eacute;forme des syst&egrave;mes de
sant&eacute; et l'appui apport&eacute; aux initiatives prises
dans ce domaine.
<P>
6.6.2 Cet appui doit s'appuyer sur des informations av&eacute;r&eacute;es
concernant la r&eacute;forme des syst&egrave;mes de sant&eacute;,
en tenant d&ucirc;ment compte des diff&eacute;rences culturelles
qui existent en mati&egrave;re de sant&eacute; et en les appr&eacute;ciant
&agrave; leur juste valeur.

&uuml;ber die<BR>
Reformierung der Gesundheitsversorgung</H1>

<H2>Endg&uuml;ltiger Entwurf zur Verabschiedung<BR>
18. Juni 1996</CENTER></H2>


<HR>

<H2>Pr&auml;ambel</H2>

<OL>
<LI>Mit dieser Charta soll Prinzipien Ausdruck verliehen werden,
die integraler Bestandteil der Gesundheitssysteme sind oder die
die Gesundheitsversorgung in allen Mitgliedstaaten der Europ&auml;ischen
Region der Weltgesundheitsorganisation verbessern k&ouml;nnen.
Diese Grunds&auml;tze entspringen den von den L&auml;ndern bei
der Umsetzung von Gesundheitsreformen gemachten Erfahrungen und
den europ&auml;ischen Zielen zur ,,Gesundheit f&uuml;r alle&quot;,
vor allem den sich auf Gesundheitssysteme beziehenden Zielen.
<LI>Diese Charta befa&szlig;t sich mit Gesundheitsreformen im
spezifisch europ&auml;ischen Kontext und rankt sich um das Prinzip,
da&szlig; Gesundheitsversorgung in erster Linie den Menschen zu
besserer Gesundheit und Lebensqualit&auml;t verhelfen sollte.
<LI>Die Verbesserungen im Gesundheitszustand der Bev&ouml;lkerung
sind ein Indikator der gesellschaftlichen Entwicklung. Gesundheitsdienste
sind zwar wichtig, sind jedoch nicht der einzige Sektor, der das
Wohlergehen der Menschen beeinflu&szlig;t: Auch andere Sektoren
k&ouml;nnen ihren Beitrag zur Gesundheit leisten und m&uuml;ssen
ihren Teil der Verantwortung daf&uuml;r &uuml;bernehmen, weshalb
Intersektoralit&auml;t ein wesentliches Kennzeichen der Gesundheitsreform
sein mu&szlig;.

<LI><I>In Erkenntnis dieser Sachlage verpflichten wir, die Gesundheitsminister
oder ihre Vertreter aus den Mitgliedstaaten der Europ&auml;ischen
Region der WHO (die Teilnehmer der Konferenz von Ljubljana), uns
hiermit, die folgenden Grunds&auml;tze zu f&ouml;rdern sowie alle
B&uuml;rger aufzurufen und alle Regierungen, Institutionen und
Gemeinwesen dringend zu ersuchen, uns in diesem Bem&uuml;hen zu
folgen. Wir ersuchen ferner das WHO-Regionalb&uuml;ro f&uuml;r
Europa, die Ma&szlig;nahmen zu ergreifen, die erforderlich sind,
um die Mitgliedstaaten dabei zu unterst&uuml;tzen, diesen Prinzipien
Wirkung zu verleihen.</I>


</OL>


________________________________<BR>
Durch dieses Dokument entstehen keinerlei rechtlich bindende Anspr&uuml;che.

<H2>Grunds&auml;tze</H2>


5. Im europ&auml;ischen Kontext m&uuml;ssen Gesundheitssysteme:


<H3>5.1 Von Werten getragen sein</H3>


Gesundheitsreformen m&uuml;ssen von den Grunds&auml;tzen der W&uuml;rde
des Menschen, der Chancengleichheit, der Solidarit&auml;t und
des Berufsethos getragen sein.
<H3>5.2 Sich gezielt auf die Gesundheit richten</H3>


Jede gr&ouml;&szlig;ere Gesundheitsreform sollte sich an klaren
Zielen f&uuml;r einen Zugewinn an Gesundheit ausrichten. Schutz
und F&ouml;rderung der Gesundheit m&uuml;ssen das vorrangige Ziel
jeder Gesellschaft sein.
<H3>5.3 Sich um den Menschen drehen</H3>


Gesundheitsreformen m&uuml;ssen sich mit den Bed&uuml;rfnissen
der B&uuml;rger auseinandersetzen und durch den demokratischen
Proze&szlig; die von ihnen in Gesundheit und Gesundheitsversorgung
gesetzten Erwartungen ber&uuml;cksichtigen. Die Reformen sollten
gew&auml;hrleisten, da&szlig; sich das Wort der B&uuml;rger entscheidend
darauf auswirkt, wie die Gesundheitsdienste geplant werden und
arbeiten. Die B&uuml;rger m&uuml;ssen auch selbst Verantwortung
f&uuml;r ihre Gesundheit &uuml;bernehmen.
<H3>5.4 Sich auf Qualit&auml;t konzentrieren
</H3>


Jede Gesundheitsreform mu&szlig; die laufende Verbesserung der
Qualit&auml;t der geleisteten Gesundheitsversorgung, darunter
auch der Kostenwirksamkeit, zum Ziel haben und eine klare Strategie
daf&uuml;r vorsehen.
<H3>5.5 Eine tragf&auml;hige Finanzierungsgrundlage haben</H3>


Die Finanzierung von Gesundheitssystemen sollte eine tragf&auml;hige
Versorgung aller B&uuml;rger erm&ouml;glichen. Das bedeutet, da&szlig;
die notwendige Versorgung alle umfassen und f&uuml;r alle gleich
zug&auml;nglich sein mu&szlig;. Das setzt wiederum voraus, da&szlig;
die Gesundheitsressourcen effizient genutzt werden. Damit die
Solidarit&auml;t gew&auml;hrleistet ist, mu&szlig; der Staat bei
der Regulierung der Finanzierung von Gesundheitssystemen eine
entscheidende Rolle spielen.
<H3>5.6 Auf die prim&auml;re Gesundheitsversorgung ausgerichtet
sein</H3>


Sich auf das Konzept der prim&auml;ren Gesundheitsversorgung gr&uuml;ndende
Reformen sollten sicherstellen, da&szlig; die Gesundheitsdienste
auf allen Ebenen die Gesundheit sch&uuml;tzen und f&ouml;rdern,
die Lebensqualit&auml;t verbessern, auf die Verh&uuml;tung und
Behandlung von Krankheiten ausgerichtet sind, die Rehabilitation
von Patienten gew&auml;hrleisten und sich um die Leidenden und
Todkranken k&uuml;mmern. Man sollte mit Reformen verst&auml;rkt
darauf dringen, da&szlig; Entscheidungen von Patient und Leistungserbringer
gemeinsam gef&auml;llt und in dem jeweiligen kulturspezifischen
Umfeld der umfassende Charakter und die Kontinuit&auml;t der Versorgung
gef&ouml;rdert werden.
<H3>Prinzipien der Steuerung des Wandels</H3>


6. Die folgenden Prinzipien bilden den Schl&uuml;ssel
zu einer effektiven Steuerung der Ver&auml;nderungen:
<H3>6.1 Gesundheitspolitik weiterentwickeln</H3>


6.1.1 Gesundheitsreformen sollten Teil eines &uuml;bergeordneten
programmatischen Konzepts der ,,Gesundheit f&uuml;r alle&quot;
sein, das mit den sozio&ouml;konomischen Bedingungen des jeweiligen
Landes vereinbar ist. Dieser programmatische Entwicklungsproze&szlig;
mu&szlig; sich auf einen breiten Konsens gr&uuml;nden, der m&ouml;glichst
viele relevante gesellschaftliche Akteure einbezieht.
<P>
6.1.2 Wichtige Grundsatz-, Management- und Fachentscheidungen
&uuml;ber die Weiterentwicklung des Gesundheitssystems sollten
sich soweit m&ouml;glich auf Evidenzkriterien st&uuml;tzen. Die
Reformen m&uuml;ssen laufend in f&uuml;r die &Ouml;ffentlichkeit
transparenter Weise verfolgt und evaluiert werden.
<P>
6.1.3 Die Regierungen m&uuml;ssen eine &ouml;ffentliche Wertedebatte
f&uuml;hren und gew&auml;hrleisten, da&szlig; die Ressourcen gerecht
verteilt werden und die gesamte Bev&ouml;lkerung Zugang zu den
gesundheitlichen Leistungen hat. Sie sollten dies au&szlig;erdem
durch gesetzgeberische und regulatorische Initiativen erleichtern.
Soweit Marktmechanismen geeignet erscheinen, sollten sie einen
Wettbewerb beg&uuml;nstigen, der Qualit&auml;t und optimale Ausnutzung
knapper Ressourcen gew&auml;hrleistet.
<H3>6.2 Auf das Wort der B&uuml;rger h&ouml;ren und ihre Entscheidung
respektieren</H3>


6.2.1 Das Wort der B&uuml;rger und die von ihnen getroffene Wahl
sollten die Gesundheitsdienste ebenso wesentlich mitgestalten
wie die auf anderen Ebenen der &ouml;konomischen, managementbezogenen
und professionellen Entscheidungsfindung getroffenen Beschl&uuml;sse.
<P>
6.2.2 Der B&uuml;rger sollte zu Fragen geh&ouml;rt werden, die
die inhaltliche Gestaltung der Gesundheitsversorgung, das Aushandeln
von vertraglichen Vereinbarungen, die Qualit&auml;t der Anbieter-/Patienten-Beziehungen,
die Handhabung von Wartelisten und die Behandlung von Beschwerden
betreffen.
<P>
6.2.3 Wahlfreiheit und Aus&uuml;bung anderer Patientenrechte erfordern
eine umfangreiche, korrekte und rechtzeitige Informations- und
Aufkl&auml;rungsarbeit. Das wiederum setzt ordnungsgem&auml;&szlig;
verifizierte und &ouml;ffentlich zug&auml;ngliche Informationen
&uuml;ber die Leistung der Gesundheitsdienste voraus.
<H3>6.3 Die Praxis der Gesundheitsversorgung umgestalten</H3>


6.3.1 Selbstbetreuung, Betreuung in der Familie und andere informelle
F&uuml;rsorgeformen m&uuml;ssen enger mit den offiziellen Gesundheitsdiensten
verzahnt werden. Das erfordert st&auml;ndigen Kontakt und bedarfsgerechte
&Uuml;berweisungs- und Informationssysteme.
<OL>
<LI>Gut geplante Strategien sind erforderlich, um gegebenenfalls
Kapazit&auml;ten aus der akuten Krankenhausversorgung in die prim&auml;re
Gesundheitsversorgung, die Gemeindepflege, Tagespflege und h&auml;usliche
Pflege zu &uuml;berf&uuml;hren.
</OL>


6.3.3 Regional vernetzte Gesundheitsdienste sollten ausgebaut
werden, sofern sie kostenwirksamer sind, eine besser organisierte
Reaktion auf medizinische Notf&auml;lle erm&ouml;glichen und die
Zusammenarbeit zwischen Krankenh&auml;usern und Einrichtungen
der prim&auml;ren Gesundheitsversorgung erleichtern.
<P>
6.3.4 Die laufende Qualit&auml;tsverbesserung der Gesundheitsversorgung
erfordert Informationssysteme, die auf ausgew&auml;hlten Qualit&auml;tsindikatoren
basieren. Sie sollten sich aus der t&auml;glichen Arbeit ableiten
lassen und eine R&uuml;ckmeldung an den einzelnen Arzt, die Pflegefachkraft
oder einen anderen Erbringer von Gesundheitsversorgung erm&ouml;glichen.
<H3>6.4 Personelle Ressourcen f&uuml;r die Gesundheitsversorgung
neu ausrichten</H3>


6.4.1 St&auml;rkere Beachtung mu&szlig; im Gesundheitswesen die
Ermittlung und Anregung bedarfsgerechter Berufsprofile finden,
die in die multiprofessionellen Teams der Gesundheitssysteme von
morgen passen.
<P>
6.4.2 In der Grundausbildung, der Fort- und Weiterbildung des
Personals der Gesundheitsversorgung braucht man einen breiteren
Ausblick als den der herk&ouml;mmlichen kurativen Versorgung.
Qualit&auml;t der Versorgung, Krankheitspr&auml;vention und Gesundheitsf&ouml;rderung
sollten untrennbarer Bestandteil der Ausbildung sein.
<P>
6.4.3 Durch geeignete Anreize sollte man das Gesundheitspersonal
dazu anhalten, ein st&auml;rkeres Bewu&szlig;tsein f&uuml;r Qualit&auml;t,
Kosten und Resultat der Versorgung zu entwickeln. Berufsverb&auml;nde
und Finanztr&auml;gerorganisationen sollten gemeinsam mit den
Gesundheitsbeh&ouml;rden aktiv an der F&ouml;rderung einer solchen
Entwicklung arbeiten.
<H3>6.5 Das Management st&auml;rken</H3>


6.5.1 Es m&uuml;ssen Leitungsfunktionen und Public-Health-Infrastrukturen
entwickelt werden, denen die Aufgabe obliegt, das Gesamtsystem
so zu lenken oder zu beeinflussen, da&szlig; die angestrebten
Verbesserungen im Gesundheitszustand der Bev&ouml;lkerung erreicht
werden.
<P>
6.5.2 Die einzelnen Institutionen der Gesundheitsversorgung sollten
die gr&ouml;&szlig;tm&ouml;gliche Unabh&auml;ngigkeit genie&szlig;en,
ihre Ressourcen in &Uuml;bereinstimmung mit den Prinzipien eines
verteilungsgerechten und effizienten Gesundheitssystems verwalten
zu k&ouml;nnen.
<P>
6.5.3 Das Management mu&szlig; stark gef&ouml;rdert werden, und
zwar durch die St&auml;rkung der individuellen F&uuml;hrungs-,
Verhandlungs- und Kommunikationskompetenzen und durch die Schaffung
institutioneller Instrumente f&uuml;r eine wirksamere und effizientere
Erbringung von Gesundheitsversorgung.
<H3>6.6 Aus den Erfahrungen lernen</H3>


6.6.1 Der nationale und internationale Austausch von Erfahrungen
&uuml;ber die Durchf&uuml;hrung von Gesundheitsreformen und die
Unterst&uuml;tzung von Reforminitiativen mu&szlig; gef&ouml;rdert
werden.
<P>
6.6.2 F&uuml;r den Bereich der Gesundheitsreformen mu&szlig; diese
Unterst&uuml;tzung auf einer validierten Wissensgrundlage basieren,
mit der interkulturelle Unterschiede der Gesundheitsversorgung
richtig verstanden und sinnvoll bewertet werden k&ouml;nnen.

<H1>Wild poliomyelitis outbreak in Albania</H1>
<hr>
</center>

 A mysterious outbreak of paralytic disease which started in Albania
in April is poliomyelitis, according to the World Health Organization.
Wild poliovirus was identified by WHO reference laboratories in
Rome, Italy and Bilthoven, Holland.
<P>
 The outbreak started in the countryside in the northwestern part
of Albania, later spreading to Tirana and the rest of the country.
As of today, there are 66 cases and 7 deaths. Initial press reports
linked the outbreak to a recent mass immunization campaign carried
out in Albania in April and May 1996 when 350,000 children under
five years were immunized. &quot;With these new laboratory results,
we can now firmly say that there is no link between the campaign
and the outbreak&quot;, comments Dr Harry Hull of the WHO Expanded
Programme on Immunization. &quot;In fact, the spring campaign
clearly protected children. Only five of the 66 cases were in
children less than five years of age. The vast majority of cases
occurred in teenagers and adults&quot;. There are seven cases
in the 0 to 9 years category and the remaining 59 cases range
from 10 to 47 years of age.
<P>
 The assessment is echoed by Dr Bruno Martin, UNICEF's Regional
Adviser on Health: &quot;The spring campaign has protected children
under five. The outbreak which claimed an unusually high number
of adults shows that mass vaccination is effective and necessary
in order to protect children from a life-threatening or disabling
disease&quot;.
<P>
 WHO and UNICEF, partners in the global polio eradication initiative,
are seeking international support for another mass immunization
campaign in Albania. &quot;We have to move fast&quot;, says Dr
George Oblapenko of the WHO Regional Office for Europe. &quot;The
immunization campaign will have to cover mostly the adult population,
simply because that's where the majority of cases are. Provisionally,
this effort will require 3,2 million doses of polio vaccine which
will cost about US$300,000 for one round. Currently, we have only
a donation of 300,000 doses of vaccine from the Red Cross of Monaco.
In the meantime, visitors to Albania should ensure that they are
adequately immunized against polio before they depart.&quot;.
<P>
 The WHO Regional Office for Europe is holding a one-day consultation
in Copenhagen on the outbreak of paralytic disease in Albania
on 20 September 1996 with representatives of all major partners
and donor community in the global polio eradication campaign.
It is expected that representatives of the Albanian Health Ministry
will also attend the consultation. The main purpose is not only
to sum up available epidemiological information gathered by WHO
experts working with Albania authorities but also to work out
details of the immunization campaign and to prepare a social mobilization
plan.
<P>
 WHO, UNICEF and Rotary International are helping to organize
mass polio immunization campaigns in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
Moldova, Romania and the Ukraine in the next month. The organizations
believe that it is crucial for the success of polio eradication
to conduct such large scale operations in neighbouring countries
at the same time, thus denying the virus an opportunity to circulate
freely in the environment.
<P>
 Prior to this outbreak, there had been 11 confirmed cases of
polio reported in the European Region of WHO in 1996, with 10
cases in Turkey and one in Ukraine. For comparison, there were
206 registered cases of confirmed polio in the European Region
in 1995.  WHO, UNICEF, Rotary International, Centers for Disease
Control (USA) and other international partners, remain firmly
committed to polio eradication by the year 2000. It will be the
second virus, after smallpox, to disappear completely from the
face of the Earth.

<center>
<H1>Flambee de poliomyelite en Albanie</H1>
<hR>
</center>
<P>
La myst&eacute;rieuse flamb&eacute;e apparue en Albanie
en avril est bien due &agrave; la poliomy&eacute;lite, selon l'Organisation
mondiale de la Sant&eacute; (OMS). Le poliovirus sauvage a en
effet &eacute;t&eacute; mis en &eacute;vidence par les laboratoires
de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence OMS de Rome (Italie) et de Bilthoven
(Pays-Bas).
<P>
 La flamb&eacute;e est d'abord apparue dans une zone rurale du
nord-ouest de l'Albanie pour s'&eacute;tendre par la suite &agrave;
Tirana et au reste du pays. A ce jour, on a recens&eacute; 66
cas et sept d&eacute;c&egrave;s. Les premi&egrave;res informations
parues dans la presse ont &eacute;tabli un lien avec la r&eacute;cente
campagne de vaccination massive organis&eacute;e dans le pays
en avril et mai deniers, au cours de laquelle 350 000 enfants
de moins de cinq ans ont &eacute;t&eacute; vaccin&eacute;s. &quot;Ces
nouveaux r&eacute;sultats de laboratoire nous permettent d'affirmer
qu'il n'y a aucun lien entre la campagne et la flamb&eacute;e&quot;,
a d&eacute;clar&eacute; le Dr Harry Hull, du Programme &eacute;largi
de Vaccination de l'OMS. &quot;Au contraire, la campagne de ce
printemps a prot&eacute;g&eacute; les enfants. Seuls cinq des
66 cas recens&eacute;s concernaient des enfants de moins de cinq
ans, la grande majorit&eacute; ayant touch&eacute; des adolescents
et des adultes.&quot; Sept cas int&eacute;ressent le groups de
z&eacute;ro &agrave; neuf ans, les 59 autres &eacute;tant survenus
chez des sujets &acirc;g&eacute;s de 10 &agrave; 46 ans.
<P>
 Le Dr Bruno Martin, Conseiller r&eacute;gional de l'UNICEF pour
la Sant&eacute; est du m&ecirc;me avis : &quot;La campagne de
ce printemps a prot&eacute;g&eacute; les enfants de moins de cinq
ans. La flamb&eacute;e qui a touch&eacute; un nombre inhabituel
d'adultes d&eacute;montre que la vaccination massive est efficace
et n&eacute;cessaire pour prot&eacute;ger les enfants de cette
maladie incapacitante et potentiellement mortelle.&quot;
<P>
 L'OMS et l'UNICEF, qui participent &agrave; l'initiative pour
l'&eacute;radication mondiale de la poliomy&eacute;lite, recherchent
un appui international pour organiser une autre campagne de vaccination
massive en Albanie. &quot;Le temps presse&quot;, souligne le Dr
George Oblapenko, du Bureau r&eacute;gional OMS de l'Europe. &quot;La
campagne devra couvrir surtout les adultes, pour la simple et
bonne raison que c'est chez eux que l'on enregistre la majorit&eacute;
des cas. On peut dire provisoirement qu'il faudra 3,2 millions
de doses de vaccin antipoliomy&eacute;litique, ce qui co&ucirc;tera
initialement quelque US$ 300 000. Pour le moment, nous avons re&ccedil;u
un seul don de 300 000 doses de la Croix-Rouge mon&eacute;gasque.
Tous les voyageurs qui se rendent en Albanie doivent v&eacute;rifier
qu'ils sont bien immunis&eacute;s contre la poliomy&eacute;lite
avant leur d&eacute;part.&quot;
<P>
 Le Bureau r&eacute;gional de l'Europe organise une journ&eacute;e
de consultation &agrave; Copenhague sur la flamb&eacute;e albanaise
le 20 septembre prochain avec des repr&eacute;sentants de tous
les principaux partenaires et de la communaut&eacute; des donateurs
associ&eacute;s &agrave; la campagne mondiale d'&eacute;radication
de la poliomy&eacute;lite. Des repr&eacute;sentants du Minist&egrave;re
albanais de la Sant&eacute; devraient &eacute;galement participer
&agrave; la consultation. Il s'agit non seulement de faire le
point des donn&eacute;es &eacute;pid&eacute;miologiques recueillies
par les experts de l'OMS qui ont collabor&eacute; avec les autorit&eacute;s
albanaises, mais aussi de mettre au point les modalit&eacute;s
de la campagne de vaccination et de pr&eacute;parer un plan de
mobilisation sociale.
<P>
 L'OMS, l'UNICEF et le Rotary International contribuent aussi
&agrave; organiser des campagnes de vaccination massive contre
la poliomy&eacute;lite en R&eacute;publique de Moldova, en R&eacute;publique
f&eacute;d&eacute;rale de Yougoslavie, en Roumanie et en Ukraine
le mois prochain. Pour l'OMS et l'UNICEF, il est essentiel d'organiser
simultan&eacute;ment ce type d'op&eacute;ration &agrave; grand
&eacute;chelle dans les pays voisins pour emp&ecirc;cher le virus
de circuler librement et garantir le succ&egrave;s de l'initiative
de l'&eacute;radication.
<P>
 Avant cette flamb&eacute;e, 11 cas confirm&eacute;s de poliomy&eacute;lite
avaient &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;clar&eacute;s dans la R&eacute;gion
europ&eacute;enne de l'OMS en 1996 : 10 en Turquie et un en Ukraine.
A titre de comparaison, on avait enregistr&eacute; 206 cas confirm&eacute;s
de poliomy&eacute;lite dans la R&eacute;gion europ&eacute;enne
en 1995. L'OMS, l'UNICEF, le Rotary International, ainsi que les
Centers for Disease Control (Etats-Unis d'Am&eacute;rique) et
les autres partenaires internationaux restent fid&egrave;les &agrave;
leur engagement r&eacute;solu d'&eacute;radiquer la poliomy&eacute;lite
d'ici l'an 2000. Le poliovirus serait ainsi apr&egrave;s le virus
de la variole le deuxi&egrave;me virus &agrave; dispara&icirc;tre
compl&egrave;tement de la surface de la plan&egrave;te.

Copenhagen, 22 October 1996
<H2>Mysterious illness reported in school children<BR>
in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia</H2>


A WHO expert team is investigating an outbreak of a mysterious
illness which has affected 1000 school children and resulted in
over 600 hospitalizations in the Tetovo municipality in the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).
<P>
Since 26 September 1996, hundreds of primary and secondary school
students aged 11 to 17, all of Albanian descent, have been admitted
to the Tetovo Medical Centre with an unknown cause syndrome as
it was characterized by headache, abdominal pains, breathlessness,
dizziness, weakness, muscle pains and other less frequent symptoms.
All the patients received symptomatic treatment and improved rapidly.
After one to three days they were discharged from the hospital
and returned home. No deaths have been reported.
<P>
The syndrome which is affecting only Albanian children, has raised
serious concerns amongst both the local population and government
authorities.
<P>
On 14 October, Dr I. Filipce, Minister of Health, requested the
WHO Regional Office for Europe to provide an expert team to assist
in determining the cause of this outbreak. The WHO team, including
epidemiological, toxicological, and paediatric specialists, arrived
in Tetovo on 16 October.
<P>
The preliminary findings of the WHO expert team have revealed
no evidence of an infectious or toxicological cause for the syndrome.
The investigations are, however, not yet complete. WHO personnel
will remain in the country to continue the investigations, at
the end of which a report will be released.

<H2>Ex-R&eacute;publique yougoslave de Mac&eacute;doine - <BR>
une &eacute;pid&eacute;mie myst&eacute;rieuse chez les &eacute;coliers
</H2>

<HR>
Une &eacute;quipe d'experts de l'OMS enqu&ecirc;te actuellement
sur une &eacute;pid&eacute;mie myst&eacute;rieuse dont ont &eacute;t&eacute;
victimes 1000 &eacute;coliers et qui a n&eacute;cessit&eacute;
l'hospitalisation de 600 d'entre eux, dans la municipalit&eacute;
de Tetovo, en ex-R&eacute;publique yougoslave de Mac&eacute;doine.
<P>
Depuis le 26 septembre 1996, des centaines d'&eacute;l&egrave;ves
d'&eacute;coles primaires et secondaires, &acirc;g&eacute;s de
11 &agrave; 17 ans, tous d'origine albanaise, ont d&ucirc; &ecirc;tre
trait&eacute;s au Centre m&eacute;dical de Tetovo, pour un syndrome
de cause inconnue. Celui-ci se caract&eacute;rise par des maux
de t&ecirc;te, des maux de ventre, un essoufflement, des &eacute;tourdissements,
des acc&egrave;s de faiblesse, des douleurs musculaires et d'autres
sympt&ocirc;mes moins fr&eacute;quents. Tous les malades, apr&egrave;s
avoir re&ccedil;u un traitement symptomatique, se sont r&eacute;tablis
rapidement. Apr&egrave;s un s&eacute;jour d'un &agrave; trois
jours &agrave; l'h&ocirc;pital ils ont pu rentrer chez eux. Aucun
d&eacute;c&egrave;s n'a &eacute;t&eacute; signal&eacute;.
<P>
Ce syndrome, qui a seulement touch&eacute; les enfants albanais,
a suscit&eacute; de graves inqui&eacute;tudes aussi bien dans
la population locale que parmi les autorit&eacute;s.
<P>
Le 14 octobre, le Dr I. Filipce, ministre de la sant&eacute; du
pays, a demand&eacute; au Bureau r&eacute;gional de l'OMS pour
l'Europe d'envoyer dans le pays une &eacute;quipe charg&eacute;e
de rechercher la cause de cette &eacute;pid&eacute;mie. Cette
&eacute;quipe, qui comprend des sp&eacute;cialistes en &eacute;pid&eacute;miologie,
en toxicologie et en p&eacute;diatrie est arriv&eacute;e &agrave;
Tetovo le 16 octobre.
<P>
Les premi&egrave;res constatations de l'&eacute;quipe d'experts
n'ont pas apport&eacute; de preuves quant &agrave; la cause infectieuse
ou toxicologique du syndrome. Cette enqu&ecirc;te cependant n'est
pas achev&eacute;e, et les experts de l'OMS demeureront dans le
pays pour poursuivre leurs recherches. Un rapport sera publi&eacute;
lorsque celles-ci seront achev&eacute;es.

Kopenhagen, 22. Oktober 1996</H1>

<H2>R&auml;tselhafte Krankheit bei Sch&uuml;lern in der ehemaligen
<BR>
jugoslawischen Republik Mazedonien gemeldet</H2>

<P>
Ein WHO-Expertenteam untersucht den Ausbruch einer r&auml;tselhaften
Krankheit, von der 1000 Schulkinder betroffen sind und die in
der Gemeinde Tetovo der ehemaligen jugoslawischen Republik Mazedonien
in &uuml;ber 600 F&auml;llen zu Krankenhauseinweisungen gef&uuml;hrt
hat.
<P>
Seit dem 26. September 1996 sind Hunderte von Sch&uuml;lern der
Altersgruppe 11-17&nbsp;Jahre, alle albanischer Herkunft, mit
einem Syndrom unbekannter Ursache, das sich durch Kopfschmerzen,
Unterbauchschmerzen, Atemnot, Schwindel, Schw&auml;chegef&uuml;hl,
Muskelschmerzen und andere weniger h&auml;ufige Symptome &auml;u&szlig;ert,
in das &Auml;rztezentrum Tetovo eingeliefert worden. Alle Patienten
erhielten eine Symptombehandlung und waren in rascher Besserung.
Nach ein bis drei Tagen wurden sie aus dem Krankenhaus entlassen
und kehrten nach Hause zur&uuml;ck. Todesf&auml;lle wurden nicht
gemeldet.
<P>
Das Syndrom, von dem nur albanische Kinder betroffen sind, hat
in der Bev&ouml;lkerung des Einzugsgebiets und bei den staatlichen
Beh&ouml;rden gro&szlig;e Besorgnis ausgel&ouml;st.
<P>
Am 14.&nbsp;Oktober ersuchte Dr. I. Filipce, Minister f&uuml;r
Gesundheit, das WHO-Regionalb&uuml;ro f&uuml;r Europa um die Entsendung
eines Expertenteams, das bei der Ermittlung der Ursache dieses
Krankheitsausbruchs behilflich sein sollte. Das WHO-Team mit Spezialisten
aus Epidemiologie, Toxikologie und Kinderheilkunde kam am 16.&nbsp;Oktober
in Tetovo an.
<P>
Die vorl&auml;ufigen Erkenntnisse des WHO-Expertenteams sprechen
nicht f&uuml;r eine infekti&ouml;se oder toxikologische Ursache
des Syndroms. Die Untersuchungen sind jedoch noch nicht abgeschlossen.
Die WHO-Mitarbeiter bleiben im Land, um die Untersuchungen weiterzuf&uuml;hren,
nach deren Abschlu&szlig; ein Bericht ver&ouml;ffentlicht wird.

Copenhagen, November 1996



<H1>Albanian Poliomyelitis Epidemic Coming under Control </H1>



A significant decrease in new cases of poliomyelitis has been noted since the first round of the emergency national immunization campaign in Albania, announced WHO and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) experts at a meeting with vaccination coordinators from 11 central and eastern European countries in Rome, Italy, 24-26 October 1996. <BR>
<center>

<IMG SRC="pr0696-1.GIF">



</center>


<P>
Beginning in April, the outbreak in Albania, due to imported poliovirus,
grew to affect a large number of people in August and September.
To date, 129 cases have been reported, and 13 deaths. With outside
assistance, Albania conducted its first round of an emergency
mass immunization campaign from 7 to 14 October, reaching over
90% of all residents up to 50 years of age. Since the completion
of the first round of immunization, only 10 new cases have been
reported. A second round will be conducted in November. WHO and
UNICEF are making a joint emergency appeal to donor governments
to help Albania complete these control efforts, and care for the
victims of the outbreak.
<P>
Laboratory tests have shown that the same virus has caused of
poliomyelitis in neighbouring countries. In the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia, 20 cases have been discovered in young children
in the Kosovo and Metohija region, adjacent to Albania. In an
urgent mass campaign carried out from 27 to 29 September, 98%
of children under age 5 years were immunized in the Kosovo and
Metohija region and bordering districts in Serbia.
<P>
In August and September, 6 cases of poliomyelitis were discovered
in unvaccinated young children in an ethnic subgroup in various
areas of Greece. Special immunization efforts are underway to
reach these populations.
<P>
While health authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina and The Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have not observed cases of paralytic
poliomyelitis to date, surveillance activities have been strengthened
and mass vaccination campaigns are being carried out with WHO
and UNICEF assistance.
<P>
&quot;Polio eradiction is still on target,&quot; declared Dr Sieghart
Dittman, Coordinator, Communicable Diseases, WHO Regional Office
for Europe, &quot;but all countries will need to step up efforts
aimed at complete vaccination coverage, which includes transient
and 'hard to reach' populations.&quot;

Copenhague, novembre 1996



<H1 align=center>L'&eacute;pid&eacute;mie de poliomy&eacute;lite est enray&eacute;e
en Albanie</H1>


Depuis le lancement de la premi&egrave;re phase
de la campagne de vaccination nationale contre la poliomy&eacute;lite,
le nombre de cas nouveaux de cette maladie a fortement baiss&eacute;
en Albanie. C'est ce qu'ont annonc&eacute; des experts de l'Organisation
mondiale de la sant&eacute; (OMS) et du Fonds des Nations Unies
pour l'enfance (UNICEF) lors d'une r&eacute;union avec les coordinateurs
des activit&eacute;s de vaccination de 11 pays d'Europe centrale
et orientale. Cette r&eacute;union a eu lieu &agrave; Rome, du
24 au 26 octobre dernier.

<P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="pr06961f.GIF">
</center>
<P>
L'&eacute;pid&eacute;mie observ&eacute;e en
Albanie a &eacute;t&eacute; provoqu&eacute;e par un virus import&eacute;.
Elle a d&eacute;but&eacute; en avril et a touch&eacute; un grand
nombre de personnes en ao&ucirc;t et en septembre. Jusqu'&agrave;
pr&eacute;sent, 129 cas ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;clar&eacute;s
et 13 d&eacute;c&egrave;s se sont produits. Gr&acirc;ce &agrave;
une aide ext&eacute;rieure, l'Albanie a r&eacute;alis&eacute;
la premi&egrave;re phase d'une campagne de vaccination de masse,
qui a dur&eacute; du 7 au 14&nbsp;octobre. Cela a permis de prot&eacute;ger
plus de 90% des r&eacute;sidents &acirc;g&eacute;s de 0 &agrave;
50 ans. Depuis l'ach&egrave;vement de cette premi&egrave;re phase,
10 nouveaux cas seulement ont &eacute;t&eacute; signal&eacute;s.
Une deuxi&egrave;me phase aura lieu en novembre. L'OMS et l'UNICEF
lancent un appel d'urgence commun aux gouvernements pour qu'ils
aident l'Albanie &agrave; mener &agrave; bien ses efforts et &agrave;
soigner les personnes atteintes.
<P>
Les examens de laboratoire ont montr&eacute;
que le m&ecirc;me virus a &eacute;t&eacute; &agrave; l'origine
de cas de poliomy&eacute;lite dans les pays voisins. En R&eacute;publique
f&eacute;d&eacute;rative de Yougoslavie, 20 petits enfants ont
&eacute;t&eacute; touch&eacute;s par la maladie, au Kosovo et
dans la r&eacute;gion de Metohija, qui sont limitrophes de l'Albanie.
Une campagne de vaccination men&eacute;e d'urgence du 27 au 29
septembre a permis de vacciner 98% des enfants de moins de 5 ans
au Kosovo, dans la r&eacute;gion de Metohija et dans les zones
limitrophes de la Serbie.

<P>En ao&ucirc;t et en septembre, la poliomy&eacute;lite
a &eacute;t&eacute; diagnostiqu&eacute;e, dans plusieurs r&eacute;gions
de Gr&egrave;ce, chez 6 jeunes enfants non vaccin&eacute;s appartenant
&agrave; un petit groupe ethnique. Les autorit&eacute;s m&egrave;nent
une action de vaccination sp&eacute;ciale pour atteindre la population
affect&eacute;e.
<P>
En Bosnie-Herz&eacute;govine et en ex-R&eacute;publique
yougoslave de Mac&eacute;doine, aucun cas de poliomy&eacute;lite
paralytique n'a &eacute;t&eacute; constat&eacute; jusqu'&agrave;
pr&eacute;sent. Cependant, la surveillance a &eacute;t&eacute;
renforc&eacute;e et des campagnes de vaccination de masse sont
men&eacute;es avec l'aide de l'OMS et de l'UNICEF.
<P>
&#171;L'&eacute;radication de la poliomy&eacute;lite
pourra &ecirc;tre r&eacute;alis&eacute;e dans les d&eacute;lais
pr&eacute;vus&#187;, a d&eacute;clar&eacute; le Dr&nbsp;Sieghart
Dittman, responsable du service Maladies transmissibles au Bureau
r&eacute;gional de l'OMS pour l'Europe. Il a cependant ajout&eacute;
que tous les pays devraient intensifier leurs efforts pour obtenir
une couverture vaccinale totale, dont doivent notamment b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier
les personnes itin&eacute;rantes et les populations traditionnellement
difficiles &agrave; atteindre.

Pressemitteilung EURO/06/96<BR>
Kopenhagen, November 1996
<H1 align="center">Poliomyelitis-Epidemie in Albanien unter Kontrolle
</H1>


Seit der ersten Runde der landesweiten sofortigen Impfkampagne
in Albanien konnte ein signifikanter R&uuml;ckgang der neuen Erkrankungsf&auml;lle
in Poliomyelitis verzeichnet werden, gaben Experten der WHO und
des Kinderhilfswerks der Vereinten Nationen (UNICEF) auf einer
Tagung mit Impf-Koordinatoren aus 11 mittel- und osteurop&auml;ischen
L&auml;ndern bekannt, die vom 24.-26. Oktober 1996 in Rom stattfand.
<P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="pr06961g.GIF">
</center>

<P>
Die Epidemie in Albanien ist auf ein importiertes Poliovirus zur&uuml;ckzuf&uuml;hren.
Sie begann im April; im August und September war bereits eine
gro&szlig;e Zahl von Personen betroffen. Bis heute sind 129&nbsp;F&auml;lle
gemeldet worden, darunter 13&nbsp;Todesf&auml;lle. Mit ausl&auml;ndischer
Hilfe f&uuml;hrte Albanien vom 7.-14.&nbsp;Oktober die erste breit
angelegte Impfkampagne durch, mit einem Erfassungsgrad von &uuml;ber
90%&nbsp;aller Einwohner im Alter bis zu 50&nbsp;Jahren. Nach
der ersten Impfrunde wurden nur noch 10&nbsp;neue F&auml;lle gemeldet.
Im November wird die zweite Massenimpfung durchgef&uuml;hrt. WHO
und UNICEF haben einen Soforthilfeappell an Geberl&auml;nder gerichtet,
um Albanien zu helfen, die Krankheit erfolgreich zu bek&auml;mpfen
und die Opfer zu versorgen.
<P>
Labortests haben gezeigt, da&szlig; das gleiche Virus in Nachbarl&auml;ndern
zu Poliomyelitis-Erkrankungen gef&uuml;hrt hat. In der Bundesrepublik
Jugoslawien wurden bei Kleinkindern in den an Albanien angrenzenden
Gebieten des Kosovo und der Region Metohija 20&nbsp;F&auml;lle
festgestellt. In einer vom 27.-29.&nbsp;September durchgef&uuml;hrten
Sofortkampagne wurden im Kosovo, in der Region Metohija sowie
in den serbischen Grenzgebieten 98% der Kinder im Alter bis zu
5&nbsp;Jahren geimpft.
<P>
Im August und September wurden in verschiedenen Gebieten Griechenlands
sechs Poliomyelitis-F&auml;lle unter nichtgeimpften Kleinkindern
einer ethnischen Minderheitengruppe festgestellt. Gezielte Sonderimpfaktionen
werden zur Immunisierung der betroffenen Bev&ouml;lkerungsgruppen
durchgef&uuml;hrt.
<P>
In Bosnien-Herzegowina und in der ehemaligen jugoslawischen Republik
Mazedonien haben die Gesundheitsbeh&ouml;rden bisher noch keine
F&auml;lle von paralytischer Poliomyelitis festgestellt. Dennoch
wurden die &Uuml;berwachungsma&szlig;nahmen versch&auml;rft und
mit Hilfe der WHO und des UNICEF werden Massenimpfungen durchgef&uuml;hrt.
<P>
,,Die Eradikation der Poliomyelitis ist in greifbare N&auml;he
ger&uuml;ckt&quot;, erkl&auml;rte der am WHO-Regionalb&uuml;ro
f&uuml;r Europa zust&auml;ndige Koordinator f&uuml;r &uuml;bertragbare
Krankheiten, Dr.&nbsp;Sieghart&nbsp;Dittman, ,,doch m&uuml;ssen
alle L&auml;nder ihre Bem&uuml;hungen verst&auml;rken, um eine
l&uuml;ckenlose Durchimpfung zu erreichen, das gilt speziell f&uuml;r
Migranten und sonstige ,schwer erreichbare' Bev&ouml;lkerungsgruppen.&quot;

Copenhagen, November  1996

<H2>European Forum of Nursing and Midwifery Associations and WHO
Established </H2>

<H3>&quot;A Formidable Force for Change&quot;</H3>


To strengthen nursing leadership in the promotion of health and
health care in Europe, representatives of 26 national nursing
associations and the WHO Regional Office for Europe established
the European Forum of Nursing and Midwifery Associations and WHO
in Madrid, Spain on 9 November 1996.
<P>
&quot;Europe's nurses represent a formidable force that can impact
all peoples health,&quot; declared
<P>
 Dr J.E. Asvall, WHO Regional Director for Europe, in his address
to the founding meeting.
<P>
 &quot;If we can  together release the health promoting potential
that exists in the millions of skilled nurses that are the backbone
of our health systems, we can help all countries to deal more
effectively with their health problems.&quot;
<P>
Europe's 4.5 million nurses and midwives constitute the largest
group of health care workers in almost every country. They will
be represented in the Forum by their professional associations.
Founding member associations welcomed the opportunity to be more
formally linked to each other and WHO as a way of strengthening
the voice of all nurses in both international policy and strategy
development.
<P>
The Forum will build upon the experience of European fora for
medical and pharmaceutical associations, which have been working
with WHO to promote public health in Europe since 1991. Their
activities have included consensus statements on important public
health concerns (such as tobacco policies), public and professional
education, and the development and dissemination of models of
good practice in health education and promotion.
<P>
 &quot;The Forum provides European nurses and midwives with a
pragmatic structure that ensures that planned developments really
take effect,&quot; noted Ainna Fawcett Henesy, Acting Regional
Adviser for Nursing and Midwifery. &quot;The Forum will have a
strong voice and will be a force for change, for better health
and quality of life for the hundreds of millions of people in
our Region into the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century.&quot;

<H2>Le Forum europ&eacute;en des associations d'infirmi&egrave;res/sages-femmes
et de l'OMS Cr&eacute;e </H2>

<H3>&#171;Une formidable force de changement&#187;</H3>


Pour aider les professions infirmi&egrave;res &agrave; promouvoir
la sant&eacute; et les soins en Europe, des repr&eacute;sentants
de 26 associations nationales d'infirmi&egrave;res et le Bureau
r&eacute;gional de l'OMS pour l'Europe ont cr&eacute;&eacute;
&agrave; Madrid (Espagne), le 9 novembre 1996, le Forum europ&eacute;en
des associations d'infirmi&egrave;res/sages-femmes et de l'OMS.
<P>
&#171;Les infirmi&egrave;res d'Europe repr&eacute;sentent une
formidable force capable d'exercer un impact d&eacute;terminant
sur la sant&eacute; de tous&#187;, a d&eacute;clar&eacute; J.E.
Asvall, directeur r&eacute;gional de l'OMS pour l'Europe, lors
de la s&eacute;ance inaugurale. &#171;Si nous parvenons, ensemble,
&agrave; lib&eacute;rer le potentiel d'action en faveur de la
sant&eacute; qui existe chez les millions d'infirmi&egrave;res
qualifi&eacute;es formant l'&eacute;pine dorsale de nos syst&egrave;mes
de sant&eacute;, nous pourrons aider les pays &agrave; faire face
plus efficacement &agrave; leurs probl&egrave;mes sanitaires.&#187;
<P>
Les 4,5 millions d'infirmi&egrave;res et de sages-femmes d'Europe
constituent la cat&eacute;gorie d'agents de sant&eacute; la plus
importante dans la quasi-totalit&eacute; des pays. Elles seront
repr&eacute;sent&eacute;es dans le Forum par leurs associations
professionnelles. Les associations fondatrices se sont f&eacute;licit&eacute;es
de l'occasion qui leur est ainsi offerte d'&ecirc;tre reli&eacute;es
entre elles et avec l'OMS de fa&ccedil;on plus structur&eacute;e,
ce qui leur permettra de mieux faire entendre la voix des infirmi&egrave;res
lors de l'&eacute;laboration des politiques et strat&eacute;gies
internationales.
<P>
Le Forum s'inspirera de l'exp&eacute;rience des forums europ&eacute;ens
d'associations de m&eacute;decins et de pharmaciens, qui s'attachent
avec l'OMS &agrave; promouvoir la sant&eacute; publique en Europe
depuis 1991 &agrave; travers diff&eacute;rentes activit&eacute;s
: formulation de d&eacute;clarations de consensus sur des questions
importantes de sant&eacute; publique (sur le tabagisme, par exemple),
&eacute;ducation du public et des professionnels, conception et
diffusion de mod&egrave;les de bonne pratique en mati&egrave;re
d'&eacute;ducation et de promotion de la sant&eacute;.
<P>
&#171;Le Forum met &agrave; la disposition des infirmi&egrave;res
et des sages-femmes europ&eacute;ennes une structure pragmatique
qui permet de s'assurer que les activit&eacute;s planifi&eacute;es
sont effectivement mises en &#156;uvre&#187;, a not&eacute; Ainna
Fawcett Henesy, conseiller r&eacute;gional par int&eacute;rim
pour les soins infirmiers et l'obst&eacute;trique. &#171;Il fera
entendre sa voix et favorisera le changement pour am&eacute;liorer,
au 21e si&egrave;cle, la sant&eacute; et la qualit&eacute; de
vie des centaines de millions d'habitants de notre R&eacute;gion&#187;.

Pressemitteilung EURO/07/96
<BR>Kopenhagen, November 1996

<H2>Europ&auml;isches Forum der Pflege- und Hebammenverb&auml;nde
und der WHO <BR>
etabliert</H2>

<H3><CENTER><I>&#132;Ein hervorragendes
Instrument f&uuml;r einen Wandel&quot;</I></CENTER></H3>


In Madrid (Spanien) haben
die Vertreter von 26&nbsp;nationalen Pflegevereinigungen sowie
des WHO-Regionalb&uuml;ros f&uuml;r Europa am 9. November 1996
das Europ&auml;ische Forum der Pflege- und Hebammenverb&auml;nde
und der WHO etabliert, um die ma&szlig;gebliche Rolle der Pflegefachkr&auml;fte
auf dem Gebiet der Gesundheitsf&ouml;rderung und der Gesundheitsversorgung
in Europa auszubauen.
<P>
&#132;Europas Pflegefachkr&auml;fte
stellen ein bemerkenswertes Potential dar, das einen Einflu&szlig;
auf die Gesundheit aller V&ouml;lker nehmen kann&quot;, erkl&auml;rte
der WHO-Regionaldirektor f&uuml;r Europa, J.E. Asvall, in seiner
Rede auf der Gr&uuml;ndungstagung.
<P>
Wenn es uns gemeinsam gelingt,
das bei den Pflegefachkr&auml;ften, die das R&uuml;ckgrat unseres
Gesundheitssystems bilden, vorhandene Gesundheitsf&ouml;rderungspotential
freizusetzen, k&ouml;nnen wir allen L&auml;ndern helfen, ihre
Gesundheitsprobleme effizienter anzugehen.&quot;
<P>
Europas 4,5 Millionen Krankenschwestern
und Hebammen stellen in nahezu jedem Land die gr&ouml;&szlig;te
Gruppe der Mitarbeiter des Gesundheitswesens. Sie werden &uuml;ber
ihre Berufsverb&auml;nde in dem neu geschaffenen Forum vertreten
sein. Die Gr&uuml;ndungsmitglieder haben es begr&uuml;&szlig;t,
dadurch formeller miteinander und mit der WHO verflochten zu sein
und sehen darin eine M&ouml;glichkeit, der Stimme aller Pflegefachkr&auml;fte
sowohl bei der Gestaltung der internationalen Grundsatzprogramme
als auch bei der Strategieentwicklung besser Ausdruck verleihen
zu k&ouml;nnen.
<P>
Das Forum baut auf den Erfahrungen
der europ&auml;ischen Foren von &Auml;rzte- und Apothekerverb&auml;nden
auf, die seit 1991 mit der WHO zusammenarbeiten, um die Gesundheit
der Bev&ouml;lkerung in Europa zu f&ouml;rdern. Zu ihren Aktivit&auml;ten
geh&ouml;ren Konsenserkl&auml;rungen &uuml;ber wichtige Anliegen
der &ouml;ffentlichen Gesundheit (beispielsweise die Tabakpolitik),
die Aufkl&auml;rung der &Ouml;ffentlichkeit und die Ausbildung
der Fachkr&auml;fte, sowie die Entwicklung und Verbreitung von
Modellen f&uuml;r gute Praktiken auf dem Gebiet der Gesundheitserziehung
und Gesundheitsf&ouml;rderung.
<P>
&#132;Das Forum bietet den
europ&auml;ischen Krankenschwestern und Hebammen eine pragmatische
Struktur, die gew&auml;hrleistet, da&szlig; die geplanten Entwicklungen
in die Praxis umgesetzt werden,&quot; bemerkte die amtierende
Regionalbeauftragte f&uuml;r das Pflege- und Hebammenwesen, Ainna
Fawcett Henesy. &#132;Das Forum wird eine starke Stimme haben
und es ist ein Instrument f&uuml;r Ver&auml;nderungen, f&uuml;r
bessere Gesundheit und h&ouml;here Lebensqualit&auml;t f&uuml;r
hunderte Millionen Menschen in unserer Region an der Schwelle
des 21.&nbsp;Jahrhunderts.&quot;<BR>

Press release EURO/08/96<BR>
Copenhagen,  December  1996
<H2>Expert team reports on cause of mysterious illness in schoolchildren
of Albanian descent in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
</H2>


Between 26 September and 12 October 1996, about 1000 schoolchildren
(aged 11-17) in the municipality of Tetovo in The Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, all of them of Albanian descent, were treated
by the local health service for a symptom complex of unidentified
origin characterized by abdominal pain, headache, difficulty in
breathing, anxiety and other, less frequent symptoms. Most of
the children were hospitalized for 2-3 days in the Tetovo Medical
Centre. All recovered quickly with symptomatic treatment only.
No deaths were reported.
<P>
The outbreak has been a source of considerable stress on the country
as a whole , since some members of the ethnic Albanian community
have claimed that the children might have been poisoned.
<P>
On October 14, Dr I. Filipce, Minister of Health of The Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, requested assistance from the
WHO Regional Office for Europe in evaluating the cause of the
outbreak. On October 16, a WHO team of experts - including a toxicologist,
epidemiologist, paediatrician, psychologist and psychiatrist -
arrived in Tetovo to begin their work. The team spent three weeks
in the country, reviewing clinical and epidemiological evidence.
The team had access to all existing files and worked with complete
freedom. Some children were clinically examined and a sample of
parents and teachers was interviewed and underwent a psychological
questionnaire. A substantial amount of medical records was reviewed
and an epidemiological case-control study with a self-administered
questionnaire was conducted in a supervised environment. Toxicological
studies were also carried out. Based on these investigations,
the following conclusions were drawn.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>Report on the Emergency Mission to the Tetovo Region
-</B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Expert Team Conclusions</B></CENTER>
<UL>
<LI>The onset of symptoms was sudden, the duration short, and
no measurable side effects or long-term effects, apart from the
symptoms tending to recur in some children, were found.
<LI>It seems reasonably clear that an infectious agent was not
the cause of the symptom complex; the outbreak pattern and symptom
complex are not consistent with any known infectious processes.
<LI>Although not all environmental aspects could be investigated,
since specific environmental sampling did not take place, it appears
unlikely that the outbreak was due to general environmental poisoning,
since cases were confined to children of Albanian descent. Other
children and adults in the same environments were not affected.
<LI>A school-focused poisoning does not appear to be the cause
in that, if an agent had been administered on a selective class-by-class
basis, a more balanced sex ratio of affected people (rather than
the observed 66% female to 34% male) would have been observed.
<LI>The recurrent cases and relapses seen by members of the team
seem to be psychologically induced. The members of the WHO team,
however, did not see the 1000 children in the main outbreak; they
only studied their medical files and used data from a retrospective
epidemiological survey.
<LI>Although no specific evidence points to the conclusion, it
is possible that other factors, such as a minor viral or bacterial
infection or food intoxication, could have been involved in the
initial cases. One possible hypothesis is that such an event might
have started the whole outbreak. The schoolchildren saw symptoms
in their fellows and jumped to the conclusion that there had been
a &quot;poisoning&quot;. This could have resulted in case recruitment
around the first cases, possibly fostered by a stress situation,
anxiety or tension that exists between and within ethnic groups
in certain areas of the Tetovo municipality.
<LI>The number of people involved effectively excludes a mass
simulation and indicates psychologically induced events linked
to stress and anxiety.
<LI>While the team recognizes the important health service dimensions
of this outbreak, it feels that too little attention has been
paid to other contributing factors, such as the educational setting,
public order and social peace monitoring, and ethnic relations.
This carries the risk of putting the health care system under
an inappropriate spotlight and making it bear a disproportionate
responsibility for the present situation. Unless this approach
is improved, a similar problem could occur in the future.
</UL>

<P>
&quot;All evidence points to human suffering and tension in the
affected children and their families, in the schools, hospitals,
and municipal life related to this outbreak as the most crucial
findings of these missions&quot;, noted Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO team
leader. &quot;Regardless of whether tension may have played an
instrumental role in the origin of the outbreak, the resulting
human suffering and tension should now be considered the main
health problem.&quot;
<P>
The expert team recommended the establishment of a community support
group - including national and local politicians, representatives
of affected citizen groups and individuals (children, adults and
teachers), health and other government agencies, health professionals
and the media - to share information, rebuild confidence and prevent
the occurrence of similar events in the future or at least minimize
their impact.
<P>
&quot;While we are relieved to know that no infectious or toxic
agents have been identified,&quot; noted Dr&nbsp;I. Filipce, at
the conclusion of his discussions with Dr&nbsp;J.E. Asvall, WHO
Regional Director for Europe, and Ms Jakab in Copenhagen on 4-6
December, &quot;our sympathies extend to the children and their
families who have been suffering these symptoms. We will take
action on the recommendations made by the WHO team and work hard
to prevent such episodes from recurring.&quot;
<P>
Dr Filipce and WHO will hold a  press conference in Skopje on
Friday 13 December to discuss the findings of the expert report.
<P>
&quot;This outbreak is a poignant example of how health is determined
by many different physical, social, cultural and political factors,&quot;
noted Dr&nbsp;Asvall. &quot;By actively involving the many people
and institutions who influence the creation of health in this
setting, not just those in the official health care system, health
can provide a common ground for conflict resolution and thus,
eventually, also to healing and better social development.&quot;

Copenhague, D&eacute;cembre 1996<BR>

<H2>Une &eacute;quipe d'experts &agrave; la recherche des causes
d'une myst&eacute;rieuse<BR>
maladie touchant des &eacute;coliers de souche albanaise dans
<BR>
l'ex-R&eacute;publique yougoslave de Mac&eacute;doine<BR>
</H2>

<P>
Entre le 26 septembre et le 12 octobre 1996, pr&egrave;s de mille
&eacute;coliers (&acirc;g&eacute;s de 11 &agrave; 17 ans) de la
ville de Tetovo (ex-R&eacute;publique yougoslave de Mac&eacute;doine),
tous de souche albanaise, ont &eacute;t&eacute; trait&eacute;s
par les services de sant&eacute; locaux pour un syndrome d'origine
ind&eacute;termin&eacute;e caract&eacute;ris&eacute; par des douleurs
abdominales, des maux de t&ecirc;te, des difficult&eacute;s &agrave;
respirer, des acc&egrave;s d'angoisse et d'autres sympt&ocirc;mes
moins fr&eacute;quents. Les enfants ont &eacute;t&eacute; hospitalis&eacute;s,
pour la plupart, pendant 2&nbsp;&agrave; 3 jours au Centre m&eacute;dical
de Tetovo. Tous ont gu&eacute;ri rapidement gr&acirc;ce &agrave;
un traitement exclusivement symptomatique. Aucun d&eacute;c&egrave;s
n'a &eacute;t&eacute; signal&eacute;.
<P>
La maladie a engendr&eacute; un stress consid&eacute;rable dans
l'ensemble du pays, certains membres de la communaut&eacute; de
souche albanaise pr&eacute;tendant que les enfants avaient pu
&ecirc;tre empoisonn&eacute;s.
<P>
Le 14 octobre, le Dr I. Filipce, ministre de la sant&eacute; de
l'ex-R&eacute;publique yougoslave de Mac&eacute;doine, a demand&eacute;
au Bureau r&eacute;gional de l'OMS pour l'Europe d'enqu&ecirc;ter
sur les causes de la maladie. Le 16 octobre, une &eacute;quipe
d'experts de l'OMS compos&eacute;e d'un toxicologue, d'un &eacute;pid&eacute;mio-logiste,
d'un p&eacute;diatre, d'un psychologue et d'un psychiatre est
arriv&eacute;e &agrave; Tetovo pour commencer son travail de recherche.
L'&eacute;quipe a pass&eacute; trois semaines dans le pays, &eacute;tudiant
la situation clinique et &eacute;pid&eacute;miologique. Elle a
eu acc&egrave;s &agrave; tous les dossiers existants et a travaill&eacute;
en toute libert&eacute;. Certains enfants ont &eacute;t&eacute;
soumis &agrave; un examen clinique et un &eacute;chantillon de
parents et d'enseignants a &eacute;t&eacute; interrog&eacute;
au moyen d'un questionnaire psychologique. Un grand nombre de
dossiers m&eacute;dicaux ont &eacute;t&eacute; examin&eacute;s
et une &eacute;tude &eacute;pid&eacute;miologique cas-t&eacute;moins
par questionnaire auto-administr&eacute; a &eacute;t&eacute; men&eacute;e
en milieu contr&ocirc;l&eacute;. Des &eacute;tudes toxicologiques
ont aussi &eacute;t&eacute; men&eacute;es. Ces recherches ont
permis de tirer plusieurs conclusions.
<H3>Rapport de la mission d'urgence dans la r&eacute;gion de Tetovo
:<BR>
conclusions de l'&eacute;quipe d'experts</H3>

<UL>
<LI>L'apparition des sympt&ocirc;mes a &eacute;t&eacute; brutale,
leur dur&eacute;e limit&eacute;e et l'on n'a observ&eacute; aucun
effet secondaire, ni &agrave; court ni &agrave; long terme, mis
&agrave; part les sympt&ocirc;mes tendant &agrave; r&eacute;appara&icirc;tre
chez certains enfants.
<LI>On peut raisonnablement penser que la cause du syndrome n'&eacute;tait
pas un agent infectieux; le sch&eacute;ma de la maladie et le
syndrome ne correspondent &agrave; aucun processus infectieux
connu.
<LI>Bien qu'il n'ait pas &eacute;t&eacute; possible d'&eacute;tudier
tous les aspects environnementaux - aucun &eacute;chantillonnage
sp&eacute;cifique n'ayant &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;alis&eacute;
-, il semble improbable que la maladie ait &eacute;t&eacute; caus&eacute;e
par un empoisonnement g&eacute;n&eacute;ral li&eacute; &agrave;
l'environnement, les cas &eacute;tant limit&eacute;s &agrave;
des enfants de souche albanaise. D'autres enfants et adultes vivant
dans le m&ecirc;me milieu n'&eacute;taient pas atteints.
<LI>Un empoisonnement scolaire semble exclus pour la raison que
si l'on avait administr&eacute; un agent de mani&egrave;re s&eacute;lective
classe par classe, on aurait observ&eacute; une r&eacute;partition
par sexe plus &eacute;quilibr&eacute;e des personnes atteintes
(plut&ocirc;t que les 66% de filles et 34% de gar&ccedil;ons observ&eacute;s).
<LI>Les r&eacute;currences et les rechutes observ&eacute;es par
les membres de l'&eacute;quipe semblent avoir des causes psychologiques.
L'&eacute;quipe de l'OMS n'a pas vu, cependant, les mille enfants
pendant l'&eacute;pisode principal de la maladie; elle a seulement
&eacute;tudi&eacute; leurs dossiers m&eacute;dicaux et exploit&eacute;
les donn&eacute;es d'une enqu&ecirc;te &eacute;pid&eacute;miologique
r&eacute;trospective.
<LI>Bien qu'aucun &eacute;l&eacute;ment sp&eacute;cifique n'invite
&agrave; cette conclusion, il est possible que d'autres facteurs
(infection virale ou bact&eacute;rienne mineure, intoxication
alimentaire) aient pu jouer un r&ocirc;le dans les premiers cas.
Il est possible qu'un tel &eacute;v&eacute;nement ait pu d&eacute;clencher
toute l'&eacute;pid&eacute;mie. Les &eacute;coliers ont observ&eacute;
les sympt&ocirc;mes dont &eacute;taient atteints leurs camarades
et en ont imm&eacute;diatement conclu qu'il s'agit d'un &#171;empoisonnement&#187;.
Il a pu s'ensuivre un ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne de multiplication
autour des premiers cas, peut-&ecirc;tre favoris&eacute; par une
situation de stress, d'angoisse ou de tension existant entre -
et au sein - des groupes ethniques de certains quartiers de la
ville de Tetovo.
<LI>Le nombre de personnes atteintes exclut effectivement toute
simulation de masse et donne &agrave; penser qu'il s'agit d'&eacute;v&eacute;nements
d'origine psychologique li&eacute;s au stress et &agrave; l'angoisse.
<LI>L'&eacute;quipe, tout en admettant la dimension sanitaire
non n&eacute;gligeable de cet &eacute;pisode, estime qu'on a accord&eacute;
trop peu d'attention &agrave; d'autres facteurs : milieu scolaire,
maintien de l'ordre public et de la paix sociale, relations ethniques.
On risque ainsi de trop mettre l'accent sur le syst&egrave;me
de sant&eacute; et de le tenir dans une mesure disproportionn&eacute;e
responsable de la situation pr&eacute;sente. Si l'on ne rem&eacute;die
pas &agrave; cet &eacute;tat de fait, on risque de voir un probl&egrave;me
similaire se reproduire &agrave; l'avenir.
</UL>

<P>
&#171;Les souffrances et les tensions observ&eacute;es chez les
enfants atteints et chez leurs familles, &agrave; l'&eacute;cole,
&agrave; l'h&ocirc;pital et dans la vie quotidienne sont les &eacute;l&eacute;ments
les plus importants observ&eacute;s lors de cette mission&#187;,
a d&eacute;clar&eacute; Zsuzsanna Jakab, qui dirigeait l'&eacute;quipe.
&#171;Quelque crucial qu'ait &eacute;t&eacute; le r&ocirc;le jou&eacute;
par la tension dans la survenue de la maladie, les souffrances
humaines et le stress qui en ont r&eacute;sult&eacute; doivent
d&eacute;sormais &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme la
cl&eacute; de ce probl&egrave;me sanitaire.&#187;
<P>
L'&eacute;quipe d'experts a recommand&eacute; de cr&eacute;er
un groupe de soutien - compos&eacute; d'&eacute;lus nationaux
et locaux, de repr&eacute;sentants des citoyens et individus concern&eacute;s
(enfants, adultes et enseignants), de repr&eacute;sentants des
pouvoirs publics, de professionnels de la sant&eacute; et des
m&eacute;dias. Ce groupe aurait pour t&acirc;che d'&eacute;changer
des informations, de restaurer la confiance, de pr&eacute;venir
la r&eacute;apparition d'&eacute;v&eacute;nements similaires ou,
tout au moins, de minimiser leur impact.
<P>
&#171;Bien que nous soyons rassur&eacute;s de savoir qu'aucun
agent infectieux ou toxique n'a &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;tect&eacute;&#187;,
a d&eacute;clar&eacute; le Dr&nbsp;I. Filipce, &agrave; la fin
les discussions qu'il a eues &agrave; Copenhague, du 4 au 6 d&eacute;cembre,
avec le Dr&nbsp;J.E. Asvall, directeur r&eacute;gional de l'OMS
pour l'Europe et Mme Jakab, &#171;notre sympathie va aux enfants
et aux familles qui ont souffert de cette &eacute;preuve. Nous
appliquerons les recommandations de l'OMS et travaillerons dur
pour emp&ecirc;cher que de tels &eacute;pisodes ne se reproduisent.&#187;
<P>
Le Dr Filipce et des repr&eacute;sentants de l'OMS tiendront &agrave;
Skopje, le 13 d&eacute;cembre, une conf&eacute;rence de presse
au cours de laquelle ils commenteront les conclusions du rapport.

<P>
&#171;Cet &eacute;pisode est un exemple r&eacute;v&eacute;lateur
de la mani&egrave;re dont la sant&eacute; est d&eacute;termin&eacute;e
par de nombreux facteurs physiques, sociaux, culturels et politiques&#187;,
a d&eacute;clar&eacute; le Dr&nbsp;Asvall. &#171;En associant
activement les repr&eacute;sentants de ces secteurs - et pas seulement
les agents du syst&egrave;me de sant&eacute; officiel - &agrave;
la promotion de la sant&eacute;, on pourra r&eacute;soudre des
conflits et, partant, soulager et assurer un meilleur d&eacute;veloppement
social.&#187;<BR>

Pressemitteilung EURO/08/96<BR>
Kopenhagen, Dezember 1996
<H2>Expertenteam berichtet &uuml;ber Ursache mysteri&ouml;ser
Krankheit
unter Schulkindern albanischer Herkunft in
der ehemaligen jugoslawischen Republik Mazedonien </H2>


Zwischen 26. September und 12. Oktober 1996 wurden in der Gemeinde
Tetovo der ehemaligen jugoslawischen Republik Mazedonien etwa
1000 Schulkinder (im Alter von 11 bis 17&nbsp;Jahren), alle albanischer
Herkunft, vom &ouml;rtlichen Gesundheitsdienst wegen eines Symptomkomplexes
von nicht ermitteltem Ursprung behandelt, der durch Bauchschmerzen,
Kopfschmerzen, Atembeschwerden, Angstgef&uuml;hle sowie andere,
weniger h&auml;ufige Symptome, gekennzeichnet war. Die meisten
Kinder wurden zwei bis drei Tage station&auml;r in das &Auml;rztezentrum
Tetovo eingewiesen. Alle erholten sich mit ausschlie&szlig;lich
symptomatischer Behandlung schnell. Es wurden keine Todesf&auml;lle
gemeldet.
<P>
Der Ausbruch bedeutete eine erhebliche Belastung f&uuml;r das
Land insgesamt, da einige ethnische Albaner behauptet hatten,
da&szlig; die Kinder m&ouml;glicherweise vergiftet worden seien.
<P>
Am 14. Oktober bat Dr. I. Filipce, Minister f&uuml;r Gesundheit
der ehemaligen jugoslawischen Republik Mazedonien das WHO-Regionalb&uuml;ro
f&uuml;r Europa um Hilfe bei der Beurteilung der Ausbruchsursache.
Am 16. Oktober reiste ein WHO-Expertenteam, bestehend aus einem
Toxikologen, einem Epidemiologen, einem Kinderarzt, einem Psychologen
und einem Psychiater nach Tetovo, um dort die Arbeit aufzunehmen.
Das Team blieb drei Wochen im Land und &uuml;berpr&uuml;fte die
klinische und epidemiologische Beweislage. Das Team hatte Zugang
zu allen bestehenden Unterlagen und arbeitete v&ouml;llig frei.
Einige Kinder wurden klinisch untersucht, eine Eltern- und Lehrerstichprobe
wurde interviewt und f&uuml;llte einen psychologischen Fragebogen
aus. Man &uuml;berpr&uuml;fte eine erhebliche Menge &auml;rztlicher
Unterlagen und f&uuml;hrte unter Aufsicht eine epidemiologische
Fallkontrollstudie mit von den Befragten selbst ausgef&uuml;llten
Frageb&ouml;gen durch. Es wurden auch toxikologische Studien durchgef&uuml;hrt.
Auf der Grundlage dieser Untersuchungen gelangte man zu folgendem
Schlu&szlig;.
<H3><CENTER>Bericht &uuml;ber die Notfallmission
in die Region Tetovo -</CENTER></H3>

<H3><CENTER>Schlu&szlig;folgerungen
des Expertenteams</CENTER></H3>

<UL>
<LI>Die Symptome setzten pl&ouml;tzlich ein, waren von kurzer
Dauer, und, abgesehen von den Symptomen, die bei einigen Kindern
wiederholt auftauchten, wurden keine me&szlig;baren Nebenwirkungen
oder langfristigen Auswirkungen festgestellt.
<LI>Es scheint einigerma&szlig;en klar zu sein, da&szlig; der
Symptomkomplex nicht durch einen infekti&ouml;sen Wirkstoff verursacht
wurde; Ausbruchsmuster und Symptomkomplex stimmen mit keinem bekannten
Infektionsproze&szlig; &uuml;berein.
<LI>Es konnten zwar nicht alle Umweltaspekte untersucht werden,
da keine spezifische Umweltstichprobe erhoben wurde, es erscheint
jedoch unwahrscheinlich, da&szlig; der Ausbruch auf eine allgemeine
Umweltvergiftung zur&uuml;ckzuf&uuml;hren ist, da sich die F&auml;lle
auf Kinder albanischer Herkunft beschr&auml;nkten. Andere, unter
den gleichen Umweltverh&auml;ltnissen lebende Kinder und Erwachsene
waren nicht betroffen.
<LI>Eine Vergiftung im schulischen Rahmen scheint nicht die Ursache
zu sein, da man dann ein ausgewogeneres geschlechtsbezogenes Verh&auml;ltnis
der davon Betroffenen h&auml;tte erwarten m&uuml;ssen (d. h. nicht
das tats&auml;chlich beobachtete Verh&auml;ltnis von 66% M&auml;dchen
gegen&uuml;ber 34% Jungen), wenn einzelne Klassen einem Wirkstoff
ausgesetzt gewesen w&auml;ren.
<LI>Die von den Teammitgliedern beobachteten wiederkehrenden F&auml;lle
und R&uuml;ckf&auml;lle scheinen psychologisch induziert zu sein.
Das WHO-Team hat allerdings die 1000 Kinder des gro&szlig;en Ausbruchs
nicht gesehen; es sichtete nur die &auml;rztlichen Unterlagen
und benutzte Daten einer retrospektiven epidemiologischen Erhebung.
<LI>Es ist m&ouml;glich, da&szlig; bei den urspr&uuml;nglichen
F&auml;llen andere Faktoren, wie beispielsweise eine kleinere
Virus- oder Bakterieninfektion bzw. eine Lebensmittelvergiftung,
eine Rolle gespielt haben, obgleich nichts spezifisch darauf hinweist.
Eine m&ouml;gliche Hypothese lautet, da&szlig; ein solches Ereignis
den gesamten Ausbruch ausgel&ouml;st haben k&ouml;nnte. Die Sch&uuml;ler
sahen die Symptome ihrer Kameraden und schlossen daraus, da&szlig;
man es mit einer ,,Vergiftung&quot; zu tun habe. Das k&ouml;nnte
um die ersten F&auml;lle herum weitere ausgel&ouml;st haben, m&ouml;glicherweise
gef&ouml;rdert durch die Stre&szlig;situation, durch Angst oder
die Angespanntheit, die in bestimmten Gebieten der Gemeinde Tetovo
zwischen den ethnischen Gruppen und innerhalb der Gruppierungen
bestehen.
<LI>Die Zahl der von dem Ausbruch Betroffenen schlie&szlig;t eine
Massensimulation effektiv aus und spricht f&uuml;r psychologisch
induzierte, mit Stre&szlig; und Angst verbundene Ereignisse.
<LI>Das Team ist sich zwar der f&uuml;r das Gesundheitswesen wichtigen
Aspekte dieses Ausbruchs bewu&szlig;t, ist jedoch der Ansicht,
da&szlig; anderen mitwirkenden Faktoren zu wenig Aufmerksamkeit
gewidmet wurde. Das gilt f&uuml;r den schulischen Rahmen, f&uuml;r
die &Uuml;berwachung der &ouml;ffentlichen Ordnung und des sozialen
Friedens und die ethnischen Beziehungen. Damit ger&auml;t das
Gesundheitsversorgungssystem in Gefahr, in ein unzweckm&auml;&szlig;iges
Rampenlicht zu geraten und eine unverh&auml;ltnism&auml;&szlig;ig
gro&szlig;e Verantwortung f&uuml;r die vorliegende Situation tragen
zu m&uuml;ssen. Geschehen in dieser Hinsicht keine Verbesserungen,
k&ouml;nnte es k&uuml;nftig zu &auml;hnlichen Problemen kommen.

</UL>


"Alles spricht daf&uuml;r, da&szlig; die wichtigsten Erkenntnisse
des Teams in Zusammenhang mit diesem Ausbruch menschliches Leiden
und Spannungen bei den betroffenen Kindern und ihren Familien,
in den Schulen, Krankenh&auml;usern und im Gemeindeleben aufgezeigt
haben&quot;, stellte Zsuzsanna Jakab, die WHO-Teamleiterin, fest.
"Unabh&auml;ngig davon, ob f&uuml;r den Ursprung des Ausbruchs
die
gespannte Situation eine wesentliche Rolle gespielt hat, sollte
man jetzt das dadurch bewirkte Leiden und die so ausgel&ouml;ste
Spannung als das wichtigste gesundheitliche Problem betrachten.&quot;
<P>
Die Expertengruppe empfahl, in der Gemeinde eine St&uuml;tzgruppe
zu bilden, der Landes- und Kommunalpolitiker, Vertreter der betroffenen
B&uuml;rgergruppen und Einzelpersonen (Kinder, Erwachsene und
Lehrer), Vertreter von Gesundheitsbeh&ouml;rden und anderen staatlichen
Stellen, der Gesundheitsfachkr&auml;fe und der Medien angeh&ouml;ren
sollten, um Informationen auszutauschen, das Vertrauen wieder
herzustellen und &auml;hnliche Ereignisse in Zukunft zu verhindern
oder zumindest ihre Auswirkungen auf ein Mindestma&szlig; zu beschr&auml;nken.
<P>
"Wir sind erleichtert, da&szlig; man keine infekti&ouml;sen oder
toxischen Wirkstoffe gefunden hat&quot;, erkl&auml;rte Dr. I.
Filipce beim Abschlu&szlig; des vom 4. bis 6. September in Kopenhagen
mit Dr. J.E. Asvall, dem WHO-Regionaldirektor f&uuml;r Europa,
und Frau Jakab gef&uuml;hrten Gespr&auml;chs. ,,Doch unser Mitgef&uuml;hl
gilt den Kindern und ihren Familien, die unter diesen Symptomen
leiden mu&szlig;ten. Wir werden die Empfehlungen des WHO-Teams
aufgreifen und uns sehr darum bem&uuml;hen, k&uuml;nftig &auml;hnliche
Episoden zu vermeiden.&quot;
<P>
Auf einer Pressekonferenz am 13. Dezember in Skopje werden Dr.
Filipce und die WHO die Ergebnisse des Expertenberichts besprechen.
<P>
,,Dieser Ausbruch zeigt &uuml;beraus deutlich, da&szlig; Gesundheit
durch viele verschiedene physische, soziale, kulturelle und politische
Faktoren bestimmt wird&quot;, bemerkte Dr. Asvall. ,,Wenn man
in die Arbeit nicht nur das offizielle Gesundheitssystem, sondern
auch aktiv die vielen, an der Schaffung von Gesundheit ma&szlig;geblich
beteiligten Menschen und Institutionen einbezieht, kann die Gesundheit
eine gemeinsame Grundlage f&uuml;r die Konfliktl&ouml;sung und
damit letztlich auch f&uuml;r die Heilung und eine bessere soziale
Entwicklung abgeben.&quot;

Press release EURO/09/96<BR>
 Copenhagen, December  1996
<P>
<H2>WHO selects a new Director for Programme Management<BR>
for WHO / Europe<BR>
</H2>


Dr Serguei Litvinov has been selected for the post of Director,
Programme Management of the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional
Office for Europe, effective 1 January 1997.
<P>
Dr Litvinov will succeed Dr David Macfadyen who is retiring from
the Organization.

<P>
Dr Litvinov started his work in WHO in the Regional Office for
Africa as a medical officer in the Ministry of Health, Ghana (1973-1979).
He next served as Assistant, Director-General in the Division
of Communicable Diseases at WHO headquarters in Geneva (1983-1987).
 In 1993, he joined the Regional Office for Europe to lead the
(then) new EUROHEALTH programme, focused on assisting in the public
health development of the newly independent states of the former
Soviet Union. During 1996, Dr Litvinov has been the (acting) Director
of the Country Health Department.

<P>
Prior to, and between WHO assignments, Dr Litvinov has worked
in the Ministry of Health and the Central Research Institute of
Epidemiology in Moscow. He received his medical degree from the
Second Medical Institute in Moscow in 1962. He has special training
in Tropical Medicine and the Epidemiology of Communicable Diseases.


<P>
 &quot;Dr Litvinov has earned the respect not only of his colleagues
in the Regional Office for Europe but also of the representatives
of the Member States,&quot; stated Dr Jo E. Asvall, Regional Director.
 &quot;We are very fortunate to have someone with his experience
and background to take over the demanding responsibility of Director,
Programme Management.  Dr Litvinov's wide knowledge of WHO, public
health and the needs of the European Member States combine to
make him an exceptional person in whom we can easily place our
confidence to lead the programmes of the Organization at this
important time in WHO.&quot;

<P>
Dr Litvinov lives in Copenhagen, Denmark with his wife and daughter.

Le Dr Serguei Litvinov a &eacute;t&eacute; nomm&eacute; au poste
de Directeur de la gestion des programmes du Bureau r&eacute;gional
de l'Organisation mondiale de la sant&eacute; (OMS) pour l'Europe

&agrave; ce poste au Dr David Macfadyen, qui prend sa retraite

<P>
Le Dr Litvinov a d&eacute;but&eacute; sa carri&egrave;re &agrave;
l'OMS au Bureau r&eacute;gional de l'Afrique comme conseiller
m&eacute;dical aupr&egrave;s du minist&egrave;re de la sant&eacute;
du Ghana (1973-1979). Il a ensuite assum&eacute; les fonctions
de directeur g&eacute;n&eacute;ral adjoint au sein de la Division
des maladies transmissibles du Si&egrave;ge de l'OMS &agrave;
Gen&egrave;ve (1983-1987). En 1993, il est entr&eacute; au Bureau
r&eacute;gional de l'Europe pour diriger le programme EUROSANT&Eacute;,
qui venait d'&ecirc;tre cr&eacute;&eacute;. Ce programme a pour
vocation de contribuer au d&eacute;veloppement sanitaire des &Eacute;tats
nouvellement ind&eacute;pendants de l'ancienne Union sovi&eacute;tique.
En 1996, le Dr Litvinov a assum&eacute; les fonctions de directeur

il a suivi une formation sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;e en m&eacute;decine
tropicale et en &eacute;pid&eacute;miologie des maladies transmissibles.


<P>
&#171;Le Dr Litvinov a gagn&eacute; le respect non seulement de

repr&eacute;sentants des &Eacute;tats membres &#187;, a d&eacute;clar&eacute;
le Dr Jo E. Asvall, directeur r&eacute;gional. &#171; Nous sommes
ravis de voir quelqu'un ayant son exp&eacute;rience et ses r&eacute;f&eacute;rences
prendre le relais au poste difficile de Directeur de la gestion
des programmes. L'excellente connaissance qu'a le Dr&nbsp;Litvinov
de l'OMS, de la sant&eacute; publique et des besoins des &Eacute;tats
membres europ&eacute;ens fait de lui une personne en qui nous
pouvons sans difficult&eacute; placer notre confiance pour diriger
les programmes du Bureau en cette p&eacute;riode capitale pour
l'OMS&#187;.

Mit Wirkung vom 1. Januar 1997 tritt Dr. Serguei
Litvinov das Amt des Direktors f&uuml;r Programm-Management des
Regionalb&uuml;ros f&uuml;r Europa der Weltgesundheitsorganisation

<P>
Dr. Litvinov begann seine Arbeit in der WHO
im Regionalb&uuml;ro
f&uuml;r Afrika als medizinischer Referent im Ministerium f&uuml;r
Gesundheit,
Ghana (1973-1979). Danach war er (1983-1987) in der Abteilung
f&uuml;r &Uuml;bertragbare Krankheiten am WHO-Hauptb&uuml;ro in
Genf beigeordneter Generaldirektor. 1993 kam er an das Regionalb&uuml;ro
f&uuml;r Europa, um das (damals) neue
EUROHEALTH-Programm zu leiten, das schwerpunktm&auml;&szlig;ig
auf die Hilfe f&uuml;r die Entwicklung des Gesundheitswesens
in den Nachfolgestaaten der Sowjetunion ausgerichtet ist. 1996
war Dr. Litvinov (amtierender) Direktor der Abteilung Gesundheitliche
Entwicklung in den L&auml;ndern.

Kollegen am Regionalb&uuml;ro
f&uuml;r Europa, sondern auch die der Delegierten der Mitgliedstaaten

&uuml;bernehmen kann. Dr.&nbsp;Litvinovs umfassendes Public-Health-Wissen,
seine Kenntnis der WHO und der Erfordernisse in den europ&auml;ischen
Mitgliedstaaten machen ihn
zu einer au&szlig;ergew&ouml;hnlichen Pers&ouml;nlichkeit, der
wir die Leitung der Programme unseres B&uuml;ros in dieser f&uuml;r
die WHO so wichtigen Zeit ohne weiteres anvertrauen k&ouml;nnen.&quot;

<B>Health reform:   WHO report forms basis
for new European health care reforms</B>
<P>
<B>An expert report released at the WHO Conference on European
Health Care Reforms in Ljubljana, Slovenia, set the stage for
an intensified initiative by WHO to help policy-makers to surmount
the challenges facing European health care systems.</B>
<P>
The issues in the report were taken up when ministerial-level
delegations from 49 Member States of the WHO European Region met
in Ljubljana, Slovenia, from 17 to 20 June 1996 at the WHO Conference
on European Health Care Reforms. Ministers exchanged experiences,
analysed action to date and adopted the Ljubljana Charter on Health
Care Reforms, which articulates a common set of principles and
strategies.
<P>
The report emphasized the importance of measuring the success
of reform against long-term gains in health status. Cost containment
alone provides an inadequate basis for sustainable health care
reform, the report stated.
<P>
This sentiment was strongly underlined by WHO Regional Director
for Europe, Dr Jo E. Asvall, in his opening address to the Conference:
&quot;The problem in most countries today is that haphazard and
often drastic cuts are made in health care budgets without sufficient
understanding of what the functional consequences of the cuts
will be for the health care that people will receive. Until now,
health care administrations have attached little importance to
analysing the cost-effectiveness of different strategies ... such
a situation is clearly no longer acceptable!&quot;
<P>
The WHO study found little evidence of positive economic effects
from encouraging citizens to choose among insurers or to make
co-payments. On the contrary, the report expressed concern that
unless these demand-reducing approaches are accompanied by protective
regulation, they may substantially reduce access to necessary
health services and thus threaten the overall health of the population.
<P>
Against this background of shared concern, the newly adopted Ljubljana
Charter is centred on the principle that health care reform is
first and foremost about attaining better health for people. This
implies both a concern for having clear outcome targets for interventions
and clear mechanisms that ensure people's participation in the
process of reform. The Charter also lists the key action strategies
that can guarantee that reforms are geared towards achieving shared
goals.
<P>
In light of the pressing needs and expectations of the people
of Europe, the impact of the Ljubljana Charter on European policy-makers
is expected to be considerable.
<P>
&quot;Health care systems throughout Europe are bustling with
change,&quot; noted Dr Bozidar Voljc, Minister of Health of the
Republic of Slovenia. &quot;It is important to communicate and
exchange experiences so that common problems can be tackled uniformly,
since no country has yet found an ideal solution.&quot;

To maximize comparability between countries, a template and a
questionnaire have been developed. These provide detailed guidelines
and specific questions, definitions and examples to assist in
the process of developing the HiT profile. Quantitative data on
health services are based on the WHO health for all database,
OECD health data and World Bank data.
<P>
The current series of HiT profiles includes over half of the countries
in the Region. This is a continuing initiative with plans to extend
coverage to all countries in the Region and to up-date the material
at regular intervals and to monitor reforms over the longer term.

<P>
Background Bullets:
<UL>
<LI>Drugs represent an increasing percentage of health care costs
from around 10% in western European countries to an estimated
30% in several NIS countries
<LI>Drugs are the foremost used medical technology and they often

<LI>Access to drugs may still be a citizen's right in all European
countries, but it is unfortunately not a daily life reality anymore,
particularly in NIS.
<LI>The pharmaceutical industry panorama in Europe is changing
fast due to changes in regulation, drug financing and technological
progress
<LI>Role of government in pharmaceuticals sector is changing
<LI>Consumer awareness and empowerment is changing demands
</UL>



<P>
Pharmaceutical problems in NIS are due to
<UL>
<LI>breakdown central production and supply
<LI>reduction in budgets
<LI>breakdown of regulatory system

RC Resolution calls for
<P>
Member States to draw up drug policies that provide access for
the whole population to needed medicines at an affordable cost
to the society and the individual;
<P>
To strengthen regulation and quality assurance of pharmaceuticals
as appropriate, including control of their marketing and of spontaneous
and intensive monitoring of adverse drug reactions;
<P>
To apply the interagency Guidelines for Drug Donations;
<P>
To evaluate the roles of public and private sectors;
<P>
It further appeals to those involved in the production and sale
of drugs as well as health personnel involved in their presentation
to use ethical criteria as appropriate to their spheres of competence,
activity and responsibility.
<H1>Highlights of the year </H1>

<H3>J.E. Asvall, Regional Director for Europe </H3>

<H2>Humanitarian assistance </H2>

<H3>Bosnia and Herzegovina</H3>

<img src="..\tech\ch\ar08.gif" border=5 align=left>
The devastation caused by armed conflicts in the Region reached
levels not experienced for the last fifty years. So while the
end to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina was welcomed, there was
no doubt that the task of reconstruction would require the combined
efforts of the whole international community for many years ahead.
The Regional Office has been involved in that task from an early
stage and has given much input into drafting a framework document
for efforts to rebuild the health system in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
WHO chairs the sectoral task force on health, which is one of
the task groups established subsequent to the presentation of
the reconstruction framework.
<H3>Croatia</H3>


In Croatia, the Regional Office has been working very closely
with the Government in its efforts to develop a master plan for
reconstruction of its health care facilities following damage
from war.
<H3>Chechynia</H3>


WHO (like other United Nations organizations) has been operating
in the area around Chechnya itself. Two staff members have set
up an office in North Ossetia to help implement a project which
included the provision of vitally needed laboratory kits, drugs,
vaccines and medical equipment. Humanitarian assistance has also
been provided to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Tajikistan.
<H3>Economic development in the Region</H3>


Economic development has been extremely varied in the Region.
In western European countries, slow economic grow of about 2-4%
per annum has continued. The countries of central and eastern
Europe (CCEE) as a whole have managed to reverse the previous
trend, achieving average growth rates of about 4%, although there
were considerable variations between individual countries. For
most of the newly independent states (NIS) the situation continued
to be bleak, with further reductions in gross domestic product
in 1995.
<center>
<img src="gdp.gif"border=5>

</center>


<H3>General health trends</H3>


Overall health improvements have been noted for many western European
countries, notably a reduction (for the first time) in reported
number of new cases of AIDS. Trends in life expectancy and infant
mortality showed signs of improvement in CCEE and, although the
situation for the NIS in general was poor, there was for the first
time since the late 1980s a slight increase in life expectancy
in the Baltic states and the Russian Federation. In contrast to
those modestly positive trends, the situation of noncommunicable
diseases showed severe deterioration in NIS, with mortality from
diseases of the circulatory system rising sharply.

<center>
<img src="life.gif" border=5><P>
<img src="infant.gif" border=5>
</center>



<H3>Homicide and suicide</H3>


Equally alarming were the figures for mortality from external
causes such as injury and poisoning, homicide and suicide, where
steep increases were seen in the NIS, while the trend in CCEE
and western Europe was fairly stable or slightly downward.
<center>
<img src="suicide.gif" border=5>
<P>
<img src="homicide.gif" border=5>
</center>

<H2>Communicable diseases </H2>


The diphtheria epidemic that emerged in the Russian Federation
in 1990 has since affected all 15 NIS, with over 50&nbsp;000 cases
by 1995, yet it was an instance where a major public health intervention
has proved successful. On the basis of the difference between
projected and reported cases, an estimated  100&nbsp;000 cases
have been prevented due to the combined efforts of the Member
States involved, with international assistance. However, continued
support is still needed.

<P>
<center><img src="diph.gif" border=5></center><P>

The MECACAR initiative to eradicate poliomyelitis involved 22
Member States, 14 from the European and 8 from the Eastern Mediterranean
regions. Several rounds of mass vaccination had been carried out
and only 12 cases of poliomyelitis had been reported in the European
Region from January to June 1996.
<P>
<center><img src="polio.gif" border=5></center><p>

The increased incidence of malaria was a new problem. The Regional
Office had been collaborating intensively with WHO headquarters
on that issue, and plans for malaria control in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan
and Turkey had been drawn up and submitted to the international
donor community for support.
<P>
Particularly disturbing was the recent very rapid increase in
the incidence of syphilis in NIS and, albeit to a lesser extent,
in some CCEE. That development represented a great danger of the
spread of AIDS - the most recent figures on HIV  incidence from
Ukraine, for example, unfortunately mirrored the rise seen for
syphilis.nsive action, yet unfortunately it came at a time when
the WHO programme on AIDS had been disbanded. The advent of the
UNAIDS programme in January 1996 had led to a two-thirds reduction
in the number of Regional Office staff active in that field.<P>
<center><img src="hiv.gif" border=5></center>

<H2>Mad Cow Disease </H2>


The sudden discovery of a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
gave rise to much concern. WHO headquarters responded to that
new threat by organizing several technical meetings, and guidelines
for the establishment of a surveillance system will shortly be
forthcoming. The Standing Committee of the Regional Committee
(SCRC) advised that a regional surveillance system should be organized
(see resolutions above).
<H2>Health care reform </H2>

<img src="reform.gif" align=left border=5>
The Ljubljana Conference on health care reform had confirmed that
blindly applying market principles to the health sector would
have severe repercussions for health care in Region. The charter
endorsed at the Conference placed strong emphasis on developing
health care systems that were governed by principles of human
dignity, equity, solidarity and professional ethics, and it clearly
mapped out six strategies for action. The extensive material produced
for the Conference will be a great asset for follow-up action
by health care reform networks in countries.
<H2>Quality of care </H2>

<img src="quality.gif" border=5 align=left>
A major achievement in this area has been the formulation of national
policies in Denmark and Belgium, with 11 more countries starting
such work. The development of specific clinical quality indicators,
which had started in the area of diabetes, was now being expanded
to include selected mental health conditions, low back pain, oral
health, vascular surgical interventions, delivery and stroke.
<P>
In November 1995 a pan-European consensus conference on stroke
management was organized by the Regional Office in collaboration
with a large number of international organizations active in that
field. Agreement was reached on goals for stroke management by
the year 2005.
<H2>Lifestyles and health </H2>


<img src="alcohol.gif" align=left border=5>
Of the many and varied activities in the area of lifestyles and
health, the Conference on Health, Society and Alcohol deserves
special mention. In spite of the sensitive nature of the issue,
remarkable agreement was reached on the underlying values that
should be applied in order to reduce the health problems caused
by alcohol consumption. It is now up to each Member State to review
its national strategies in the light of the information generated
by that Conference.
<br clear=left>
<P>
<img src="tobacco.gif" align=left border=5>
The Regional Office has consolidated its collaboration with the
European Forum of Medical Associations (EFMA) on the problem of
tobacco: at the EFMA meeting in 1996 there was support for much
stronger action on tobacco and health in the European Region.
<br clear=left>
<H2>Environment and health </H2>

<img src="uk.gif" align=left border=5>
Particularly encouraging developments took place with regard to
the development of national environment and health action plans.
The first completed national plan was that of the United Kingdom,
and at least 16 other Member States have begun a similar development.
<br clear=left>
<P>
The year 1996 was the tenth anniversary of the Chernobyl accident
and the lessons learned from that disaster have been reviewed.
The Regional Office, WHO headquarters and IARC have finalized
a programme of work covering the next five-year period.
<H2>Health for All policy </H2>

<img src="hfabook.gif" align=left border=5>
The Bratislava meeting on future trends sparked
ideas for the update of the European Health for All (HFA) policy,
the first draft of which will be presented to the Regional Committee
at its next session.


<P>
Several Member States have national policy documents under development,
and Malta has recently finalized its new HFA policy. There has
also been substantial activities in that field at subnational
level.
<br clear=left>

<H2>Networking the networks
</H2>
<center>
<img src="network.gif" border=5></center><p>
In recent years, the Regional Office has made increasing use of
its many networks (CINDI, Health-promoting hospitals, Healthy
Cities, the Regions for Health Network, Health-promoting schools).
While each of those networks has its own character, partners,
target groups and methods of working, they share the common goal
of promoting a common understanding of European HFA policy. Efforts
have therefore been made to integrate these networks more effectively,
both within the Regional Office and in Member States.
<H2>International collaboration
</H2>


Cooperation with the World Bank has been intensified and a joint
seminar took place. Many different collaborative actions have
been carried out with the European Commission. Of particular note
was the report prepared by the Regional Office on the &quot;State
of health in the European Union&quot;, which was used as the basis
for a Commision communication in September 1995.

<H1>WHO and UNHRC campaigns for<BR>
 freedom of movement in Bosnia and Herzegovina</H1>

<H2>Restrictions on freedom of movement between the two entities
of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina threaten health and
peace </H2>

<H3>What is freedom of movement (FOM) in the context of health
in Bosnia and Herezegovina?</H3>


Simply put, people - patients and health care workers alike -
 should have access to all health facilities within the borders
of their country regardless of their ethnicity or place of residence.

<P>
Patients should be able to obtain appropriate services at the
closest health facility. Health workers should be able to work
in communities in which they are a minority.
<P>
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, these principles have been formally
adopted through the signing of the Dayton peace accord.
<P>
In reality, restriction of movement is far more prevalent than
freedom of movement.
<H2>How big a problem is this?</H2>


There is relatively little freedom of movement for
patients and health workers alike. Incidents of cross-border referrals
and service provision are exceptional. Opportunities for displaced
health workers to return to their original place of work are not
materializing.
<HR>

<P>
Vinac is a small town in western Bosnia and Herzegovina about
10 kms from Jajce. Vinac has one small <I>ambulata</I> (medical
centre). The Vinac <I>ambulata</I> has had problems in referring
patients to the closest hospital (in Jajce), because of current
restrictions of movement.
<P>
<CENTER><I>Vinac doctor speaks:</I></CENTER>
<P>
<I>&quot;There is no freedom of movement. When people
go to Jajce, they are stopped by the police and sent back. We
cannot take that risk with our patients.&quot;</I>
<HR>

<H2>What are the health consequences of restricted freedom of
movement?</H2>

<P>
Restricted freedom of movement has far-reaching negative
consequences for health.
<P>
 On a broad scale, living with prolonged fear and
a sense of entrapment can only serve to erode the health and happiness
of any community. Financially, the duplication of resources in
the development of two or three parallel and independent health
systems in Bosnia and Herzegovina is costly, impractical and unsustainable.
<P>
 On a personal level, the restriction of movement
denies patients proper treatment and services.  Restricted movement
also means that supplies and equipment cannot get to the people
who need them.
<H2>What can be done?</H2>


 All is not negative, however. National and international
agencies have begun actively to work on technical and other solutions.
<P>
 Police check points have been reduced in number and
are now operating more professionally.
<P>
 UNHCR has been coordinating efforts to reopen bus
lines across the interentity boundary line. Bus lines have begun
operating again with international supervision thus allowing public
transportation across borders / boundaries.
<P>
 Health professionals on many levels have begun to
communicate again.
<P>
 The ministers of health of the two entities (the
Federation and the Republika Srpska) meet regularly to discuss
important issues and try to harmonize health service reconstruction.
<HR>


<CENTER><I> Minister of Health, Tuzla Canton, speaks: </I></CENTER>
<P>
<I> &quot;First of all, the health professionals can
receive a patient and provide a good service and try to make patients
understand that they are not enemies. Patients cannot be enemies
and health professionals cannot be enemies; they have to cooperate.&quot; </I>
<HR>

<P>
 Virtually all health professionals express the willingness
to treat any patient, regardless of ethnicity or place of residence.
<H2>WHO initiatives</H2>


 WHO is addressing these issues in several ways.
<P>
 For the general population, a mass distribution of
pamphlets, supported by a local media campaign, is being organized
jointly by the WHO Bosnia and Herzegovina office in Sarajevo and
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
<P>
 The pamphlet, entitled <I>The right to medical care
and freedom of movement for patients and medical staff</I>, draws
people's attention to the principles enshrined in medical ethics
and international conventions. It is being produced in local languages
for distribution from the WHO and UNHCR field offices.
<P>
 Opening and facilitating dialogue between health
professionals is another step.
<P>
 On the federal level, WHO Team Leader and Senior
Adviser on Health Reforms, J. Michael McGinnis, M.D., has been
chairing sectoral task force meetings in Bosnia and Herzegovina
sponsored by the World Bank. These meetings have provided the
forum for the ministers of health of the two entities to meet
regularly and discuss major health care issues.
<P>
 Public health initiatives are at the heart of WHO's
work; for example, infectious disease control requires cross-border
participation of professionals from all sides.
<P>
 On the canton level, the WHO field office in Tuzla

 The WHO office in Banja Luka is supporting pharmaceutical
safety net initiatives aimed at ensuring that all people have
access to medicines and supplies.
<P>
 The WHO field office in Mostar has been very active
is promoting cross-border links. Joint seminars in physical rehabilitation

<P>
<I> &quot;We did not like what your people did to
us during the war, but at least we understand now that it was

<P>
 &quot;Health can and must be a bridge to peace,&quot;
says Dr Jo E. Asvall, WHO Regional Director for Europe. &quot;

<H1>The WHO/West Saxony Investment for Health Initiative  </H1>

<H2>Health as the Common Ground </H2>
</center>

West Saxony, like many other regions in the former eastern Germany,
is confronting special difficulties which threaten people's health.
 Closure of  state-owned enterprises has contributed to high unemployment.
 Uranium mining has had significant negative effects on the environment.
Limited budgets and large needs are forcing policy makers to make
tough choices.
<P>
The WHO / West Saxony <I><B>Investment for Health</B></I> project
will help decision makers choose policy options that achieve better
health for people in the region; choices that also contribute
to the social and economic development of the area.  &quot;While
providing disease care will always be a necessary expenditure,
health promotion should be seen as an important developmental
investment<I>, </I>&quot; states Dr Erio Ziglio, WHO Regional
Adviser for Health Promotion and Investment.  &quot;This project
aims to maximize the health benefit derived from each Deutsch
Mark spent on social development programmes.&quot;
<P>
Major projects have been launched by the Region and private enterprise
aimed at improving the economy, employment possibilities, environmental
conditions, physical and social well being of the people of West
Saxony.  &quot;All of these projects are investments in health,&quot;
notes Professor Lowell Levin, Yale University School of Public
Health (USA) and one of the WHO experts assigned to the project.
&quot; The WHO team will facilitate learning and exchange across
projects, advise on the comparative effectiveness of different
policy options and approaches, and develop the skills of a local
network of people who can successfully lead and manage the change
process.&quot;
<P>
Utilizing this approach the WHO Investment for Health team has
assisted decision makers in municipalities and Regions in Italy
and Spain to choose health creating policies and in so doing has
helped economic development and resolve priority conflicts between
competing sectors, e.g., agriculture and tourism.
<P>
&quot;The WHO Regional Office for Europe is very pleased to be
invited to participate in this  <I>Investment for Health</I> project
in West Saxony,&quot; declared Marc Danzon, M.D., Director of
Health Promotion and Disease Prevention.  &quot;Our team looks
forward to working with local policy makers over the next eighteen
months and demonstrating the value of utilising health as the
common ground upon which to build developmental policies.&quot;

<H1>Drug policy and donation in the Baltics and NIS </H1>


Progress and problems related to drug regulations
and donations will be the focus of discussion as health ministers
in charge of pharmaceuticals and chief drug regulators from the
newly independent states (NIS) and the three Baltic countries
meet for the first time in Hiller&oslash;d, Denmark14-16 October
1996.
<P>
Worrisome trends challenge drug policy makers in these eastern
parts of the European region.
<UL>
<LI>Drugs represent an increasing percentage of health care costs
with an estimated 30% in several NIS countries compared to around
10% in western European.
<LI>Access to drugs is not a daily life reality , particularly
in NIS.
<LI>The influence of private pharmaceutical interests on prescribing
patterns is growing.
<LI>The role of government in the pharmaceuticals sector is changing.
<LI>Consumer awareness and empowerment is making new demands on
governments.
<LI>International drug donations need sharper management and co-ordination.
</UL>

<P>
&quot; The problems these drug policy makers face are real and
immediate,&quot; states Kees de Joncheere, WHO Regional Adviser,
Pharmaceutical Programmes, Europe. &quot;The health of their populations
is deteriorating,  they are running out of money, and drugs continue
to be used in increasingly irrational ways. The aim of this meeting
is to assist these key decision makers in creating policies which
accurately reflect available funds, the new market situation and
focus on rational drug use and cost containment.&quot;
<P>
The WHO European Office has been actively involved in the development
of national essential drugs programmes and pharmaceutical sector
reforms in the NIS and the countries of central and eastern Europe
since 1992. Intensive project work is currently underway in the
Central Asian Republics, the Caucasian Republics and the Russian
Federation.

<H1>EuroPharm Forum catalyses good pharmacy practice in a changing
world </H1>

<P>
New ways pharmacists can help people with asthma and chronic illnesses
will be the focus of the 5<SUP>th</SUP> annual meeting of the
award winning EuroPharm Forum to be held at the WHO Regional Office
for Europe in Copenhagen, Denmark 17-18 October 1996.
<P>
The EuroPharm Forum aims to improve health through catalysing
the development of health generating pharmacy practice projects
at national level.
<P>
&quot;The Forum has had a global influence on the way pharmacists
practise,&quot; noted Kees de Joncheere, WHO Regional Adviser
for Pharmaceuticals. &quot;The projects developed by the Forum
have shown the world how much pharmacists as primary care professionals
can contribute to improving peoples health.&quot;
<P>
EuroPharm Forum projects have assisted pharmacists help people
stop smoking, control diabetes and use medicines better. In recognition
of the innovative and far-reaching effect of these projects the
Forum received the 1996 Pharmaceutical Practitioner of the Year
Award<B> </B>from the International Pharmaceutical Federation
(IFP).
<P>
This year the Forum will be proposing to its Members asthma and
chronic disease projects which aim to improve the capacities of
pharmacists to assist people with asthma and chronic diseases.
An asthma project &quot;package&quot; developed by the WHO Collaborating
Centre for Pharmacy in Hiller&oslash;d, Denmark will be presented
for discussion.
<P>
Pharmaceutical associations from 30 of the 50 WHO European Member
States are expected to attend this year's meeting.

<P>WHO/EUROPE collects, analyses and disseminates information in many
forms. Much of it appears in publications and documents, which are
distributed through networks, sold in bookshops, displayed in libraries,
and widely translated into the many languages of the Region. </P>
<P>A catalogue is published regularly and new books are announced.</P>
<HR>




The World Health Organization is a specialized agency of the United Nations with primary responsibility for
international health matters and public health.  Through this Organization, which was created in 1948, the health
professions of over 180 countries exchange their knowledge and experience with the aim of making possible the
attainment by all citizens of the world of a level of health that will permit them to lead a socially and economically
productive life.<P>
	The WHO Regional Office for Europe is one of six regional offices throughout the world, each with its own
programme geared to the particular health problems of the countries it serves.  The European Region embraces some
850 million people living in an area stretching from Greenland in the north and the Mediterranean in the south to the
Pacific shores of Russia.  The European programme of WHO therefore concentrates both on the problems associated
with industrial and post-industrial society and on those faced by the emerging democracies of central and eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union.  In its strategy for attaining the goal of health for all the Regional Office is
arranging its activities in three main areas:  lifestyles conducive to health, a healthy environment, and appropriate
services for prevention, treatment and care.<P>
	The European Region is characterized by the large number of languages spoken by its peoples, and the
resulting difficulties in disseminating information to all who may need it.  Applications for rights of translation of
Regional Office books are therefore most welcome.<P>
The Regional Office for Europe of the World Health Organization welcomes requests for permission to reproduce or
translate its publications, in part or in full.  Applications and enquiries should be addressed to the Office of
Publications, WHO Regional Office for Europe, Scherfigsvej 8, DK-2100 Copenhagen , Denmark, which will be
glad to provide the latest information on any changes made to the text, plans for new editions, and reprints and
translations already available.<P>

<H1>Introduction</H1>

<br clear=left>
<hr>
</center>
<H2>From chaos to structure</H2>

<P>
In September 1992 the World Health Organization (WHO), through
its Regional Office for Europe, initiated a programme of humanitarian
assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). At the onset of
the conflicts, the Regional Office had little experience of war
situations.
<P>
<img src="ar03.gif" border=5 align=right>

After more than three years of work under war conditions, many
lessons have been learned. WHO has developed and implemented a
field-based strategic approach. Exposed to a similar conflict
today, WHO would make a different immediate response. The health
consequences of war could be more systematically targeted. Action
strategies built on the accumulated experience of field staff
would be implemented more quickly.
<H2>Changing profile</H2>

<P>
Little by little, the profile of WHO has changed from our traditional
image as an organization setting technical standards to a more
active defender of health of populations. Today WHO works not
only symbolically but directly at the front lines of human health.
<P>
In this mission area, WHO has been linking a field presence on
the ground with our strength of international expertise. WHO has
taken the lead in coordinating the health efforts of the international
donors, intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) and nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) with our traditional partners in health,
the health authorities and professionals in countries. This has
enhanced the effectiveness of the humanitarian assistance, and
helped identify gaps and avoid duplication.
<P>

<img src="ar04.gif" border=5 align=right>
WHO's presence of core staff in a network of field offices offered
the opportunity to carry out systematic assessments of needs and
resources on the spot. These were used to guide the emergency
response from the perspectives of modern knowledge of public health.
Later, this approach offered us the chance to move gradually and
naturally from direct emergency assistance, through a transitional
state, into the mid- and longer-term perspectives of health development
and reform.
<P>
A significant element in this process has been capacity building
among local health professionals at all levels. No health care
system could be prepared for such a disaster. War&Otilde;s unnatural
drain on local expertise made it even more important to offer
support to the health workers that remained.
<img src="ar05.gif" align=right border=5>

<H2>Three kinds of problems</H2>
<P>
War generates three kinds of public health problems.
<P>
The first kind comprises the problems related to the breakdown
of existing health care systems and normal preventive actions.
War leads directly to the destruction of the health system, including
hospitals and other health institutions. The socioeconomic consequences
of war, with the lack of medical essentials and medicines, as
well as the breakdown of family and social networks, lead indirectly
to a deterioration in health. The chronically ill and the elderly
become particularly vulnerable.
<P>
For example, the lack of food, clean water, heating, electricity
and systematic rubbish collection, plus the disruption of vaccination
programmes, increases the risks of infectious diseases.
<P>
<img src="ar06.gif" align=right>

The second type comprises emergency and rehabilitation problems
arising from war-related physical injuries. Huge numbers of wounded
people, with lost limbs, spinal cord lesions, traumatic brain
damage and other injuries, change health profiles dramatically.
<P>
Third are mental health problems due to the traumatization of
the whole population by the
<P>
violations of human rights committed in the war. The result is
not an epidemic of mental illness; it is more the reactions of
normal people to a sick situation. As alcoholism, drug abuse,
violence, suicides and psychosomatic diseases increase, these
reactions have major consequences for health.
<P>
WHO has addressed all three problem areas. Actions include technical
advice (including capacity building), delivering medical supplies,
and carrying out model projects and programmes to demonstrate
comprehensive WHO guidelines in practice.
<br clear=left>
<img src="ar07.gif" align=right>

<H2>Proactive public health</H2>

<P>
Although WHO is a neutral and professional organization, we have
insisted on and worked proactively to promote optimal public health
interventions. In the dialogue with our varied partners, we have
stressed the necessity of a focus on primary health care and community-oriented
approaches (for example, in mental health and rehabilitation).
<P>

Another principle has been to work on all sides of the front lines
using documented humanitarian and other health needs to guide
our steps. This perspective has not always been popular among
the warring factions.
<img src="ar08.gif" align=right>

Ethical dilemmas have arisen from efforts to balance the mandate of working with the national authorities as natural partners with interventions based on humanitarian needs. To work on both sides of the front line does not mean an acceptance of a particular political view. Rather, WHO has taken an approach of "ethical neutrality", emphasizing respect for human rights. There is no doubt that human rights violations undermine health.


<H2>The next phase
</H2>In November 1995, the Dayton peace agreement changed the scenario.
<P>
Nevertheless, in the next phase of WHOs work in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), we will continue to work on all sides. The Implementation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (IFOR) mandate has been to stop the war and separate military forces. Our work focuses on uniting people again. WHO works for reconciliation and the substantiation of the peace. Work to improve the health situation in the post-war phase can form bridges to re-establish personal, professional and political connections and networks. Activities to build health and peace are critical to prevent new wars.
<P>
With these remarks let me invite you to read a more detailed description of the lessons learned through this work in 1995, as summarized in our annual report.

<H1>What does WHO do?</H1>
<br clear=left>
<hr>
</center>

<H2>A gruesome year of war</H2>

<P>
The Dayton peace agreement ended 1995 on a note of hope. But it
had been another gruesome year of war. More than 12 000 deaths
were reported by the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina alone.
Some of these people actually died earlier, and their bodies were
exhumed from mass graves. Thousands presumed killed in Srebrenica
have not yet been included in the figures.
<P>
This brings the death toll since the beginning of the conflict
in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia to an estimated 200 000.
There were approximately 200 000 wounded and disabled. More than
3.8 million people have been driven from their homes.

<img src="ar09.gif" align=left>

<H2>Linking global to local</H2>

<P>
WHO takes a world view. It is the one global public health authority
capable of surveying the total health situation.
<P>
Following our health for all mandate, we have helped preserve
and promote public health impartially in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Croatia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).
<P>
WHO is the only health alliance working officially with each government.
We carry out our work through local health authorities.
<P>
This often makes our presence less  visible to many. None the
less, WHO serves as the knowledge chip inside the public health
computer. We process vital information, drawing on worldwide health
databases and networks of scientific experts to assist with local
action.
<P>
In the longest and bitterest conflict on the continent since the
Second World War, we have learned the importance of making our
knowledge chip more visible. Nearly four years of experience in
a war zone have taught us that effective coordination demands
more than knowledge. It requires a field presence that can:
<UL>
<LI>work with all agencies involved in public health projects
(health ministries, national, regional and local health authorities,
other United Nations agencies, the International Federation of
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the European Community, NGOs
and donors);
<LI>function on the local, regional, national and international
levels;
<LI>assess needs and do preparedness planning;
<LI>do its job as closely as possible to where needs exist;
<LI>provide supplies and technical help with their use;
<LI>act rapidly to fill gaps; and
<LI>be a strong, independent advocate for health.
</UL>
<img src="ar10.gif" align=right>

<H2>The field presence</H2>
<P>
The WHO field presence is a network of international and local
health professionals and support personnel, staffing central and
satellite offices throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia,
and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).
Currently these offices are located in Banja Luka, Belgrade, Bihac,
Mostar, Eastern Slavonia, Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zagreb and Zenica.
<br clear=left>
<img src="ar11.gif" align=right>

<P>
This field deployment allows rapid response to health emergencies
such as epidemics and refugee influxes. In the longer term, the
links with local health authorities lay the groundwork for better
health planning, reconstruction and reform.
<P>
In line with a continuing management improvement strategy recommended
by independent evaluators in 1994, decision-making has been increasingly
decentralized to the head offices in each region. Now those closest
to the situation can respond faster to emergencies.
<P>
The WHO Coordination and Humanitarian Assistance Unit in Copenhagen
guides overall policy, mobilizes resources (personnel, funds and
supplies) and ties field activities to a global network of experts.
These activities are supported by the Division of Emergency and
Humanitarian Action at WHO headquarters in Geneva.
<H2>Scores of agencies</H2>

<P>
All WHO offices are engaged in coordination. Creating and running
meetings and other networking mechanisms have drawn agencies working
in the mission area into a more effective whole. Multi-agency
networks have been formed around each field office. These facilitate
mutual learning and support leading to a dynamic response system
across the board.

<img src="ar12.gif" align=left>

<H2>NGO clearing-house</H2>

<P>
WHO offices in the mission region assumed an NGO clearinghouse
function. Throughout the nearly four-year conflict, NGOs have
swiftly and efficiently provided critically needed supplies and
training.
<P>
Operating outside the United Nations banner, NGOs fill specialized
niches. But some lack an overview of the total health situation.
This is WHO&Otilde;s forte. We have served a coordinating function
from the outset, advising many NGOs on using their resources according
to need and orienting new NGOs wanting to become involved in the
region.
<P>
With so many operating in the region, this has proved a challenging
task. Everyone is for coordination but few really want to be coordinated.
We have done our best to identify the gaps and steer the right
agencies towards filling them. And when this was not possible
we tried to fill the gap ourselves.
<P>
The provision of basic microbiology and biochemistry supplies,
chlorine tablets, antibiotics, spare parts for equipment in health
units, and thermal underwear for freezing refugees are all examples
of our efforts to fill gaps in 1995.
<H2>Passing the word</H2>

<P>
Throughout the war, WHO has collected and circulated information.
News was passed along in several forms. From the Sarajevo office,
an update on communicable diseases in Bosnia and Herzegovina was
published monthly.
<P>
<img src="ar13.gif" align=right>

Besides the latest epidemiological figures, the bulletin highlighted
the implications of these diseases for international humanitarian
assistance and stressed appropriate action.
<P>
Monthly reports from the Zagreb field office were issued and widely
circulated. These were integral in drawing information together
about WHO programmes for donors and other regional organizations.

<P>
Not only were WHO activities reported, but significant changes
in the regional situations of all relevant agencies got attention.
<H2>A health directory</H2>

<P>
Health coordination in Belgrade is a joint activity with the Institute
of Public Health of Serbia, where twice-a-week conferences are
held. Topics cover the entire Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia
and Montenegro) and, when necessary, the health activities of
the Republika Srpska.
<P>
Satellite meetings in Kosovo, run by IFRC, and in Vojvodina, run
by the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), are pulled
together with central meetings. Attendance has been consistently
high. A joint directory, Partners in health, published three times
a year, lists the health programmes of each agency.
<H2>&quot;Pending crisis&quot; bulletins</H2>

<img src="ar15.gif" align=left border=5>

<P>
Pulling things together and suggesting plans of action, the Sarajevo
office produced its own ad hoc weekly bulletins on the health
status of the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
<P>
In the summer of 1995, the numbers of civilians killed or injured
in Bosnia and Herzegovina sharply increased. Getting any medical
supplies through the siege to the towns was almost impossible.
Shelling was directed against hospitals and wounded or sick people.
Water, food, gas and electricity were again turned into weapons
of war.
<P>
Such awful abuses of health-related human rights obviously provoked
heated discussion among WHO field staff over how to deal with
it. What does a health organization do in such a situation?
<P>
The bulletins stressed the harm being done to health. They shed
the words of diplomacy to point to flagrant human rights violations.
Snipers were seen shooting patients in hospital beds. There is
no nice way to report such incidents. Nor is WHO a peacekeeper
or police officer; we could not stop it. What we could do was
blow the horn. This we did.<BR>

<P>


The <I>Pending health crisis bulletin</I> (issued from May to
September) provided NGOs and the international community with
critical data on disease outbreaks and war wounded, as well as
issues related to health and human rights.
<HR>

<H2>The fall of Srebrenica</H2>

<P>
During the fall of Srebrenica in June 1995, thousands of people
fled the city and set up camps in the Tuzla area of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. The threats to health were huge. Tents were scarce
and too hot. Clothing and bedclothes were filthy and sparse. Poorly
designed latrines were neither treated nor covered. Unchlorinated
drinking water and the lack of waste disposal made a dangerous
situation worse.
<P>
A preparedness plan drawn up by WHO was activated within hours.
The WHO field office in Tuzla set up a crisis centre in the camp
and appraised health conditions.
<P>
The centre provided logistical support for other organizations,
with a meeting place, communications services and temporary supply
depot. Here health coordination meetings were held twice daily
during the worst crises.
<P>
To serve the homeless thousands, WHO and local public health workers
developed evaluation forms used by all agencies during the emergency.
These allowed all concerned to get a true picture of conditions
as a basis for accurate reporting and referral. Important diseases
and health problems could now be rapidly sized up. Each agency
could offer special services in a networked effort.
<P>
With tasks geographically and technically divided, various groups
addressed urgent needs. Crisis coordination meetings revealed
gaps, and these were filled as fast as possible.

<H2>Krajina exodus</H2>
<img src="ar14.gif" align=right>

<P>
How well have all the many health agencies worked together? A
major test came in August 1995 when some 200 000 people from the
Krajina region fled into the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia
and Montenegro). Vital drugs and other aid were distributed to
these refugees through existing health structures. Their most
basic needs were met as the relevant agencies quickly divided
their tasks.
<P>
M&eacute;decins sans fronti&egrave;res (MSF), for example, set
up way station aid posts in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Yugoslav
Red Cross and Institute of Public Health fielded mobile medical
teams. NGOs distributed medical supplies collected as a joint
operation.
<P>
The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) undertook health assessment
among the expelled. And WHO sorted and distributed medical supplies
from the emergency airlift and chaired networking meetings every
second day to update the emergency response.
<P>
This extraordinary display of teamwork was limited only by a shortage
of medical supplies, owing to insufficient donor interest. So
refugee needs in some areas still remain unmet.
<HR>


<H2>Sanctions</H2>

<P>
The temptation to take sides can be enormous. But that is not
our business as health field workers. It is worth remembering,
too, that not all acts detrimental to public health are direct
consequences of war actions.
<P>

<P>
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), for
example, had sanctions imposed by the Security Council since May
1992. So WHO could provide only limited amounts of technical and
material assistance. Although medical supplies were specifically
exempt, in practice the sanctions created great difficulty in
purchasing and distributing humanitarian aid.
<P>
WHO field staff were always alert to the impact of sanctions on
public health. Basic medical equipment and supplies became less
available. The death rate mounted, especially in emergencies where
intensive care was needed. And in perinatal care, the death rate
shot up by 20% to 50%, depending upon the area and hospital.
<P>
Public health in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro) suffered as a direct consequence of the conflict and
the sanctions. WHO throughout the war intervened with the sanctions
committee whenever the supply of materials for health care was
delayed.

<H2>Keeping health services going</H2>

<P>
We are linkers. WHO connects and coordinates. But what do we do
at the grass-roots level in a land of carnage?
<P>
War disrupts systems for information, personnel, supply and deployment.
It strains and drains health services through war-related injuries,
communicable diseases, death and destruction.
<P>
Overcoming such obstacles takes courage, creativity, commitment
and persistence. Local doctors and nurses throughout the war have
worked without pay. Where health centres were destroyed, they
worked in makeshift premises. There was a constant shortage of
medical supplies.
<P>
Yet somehow, with international support, they kept the health
service going.


<img src="ar16.gif" align=left>
 

<H2>Six assistance targets</H2>

<P>
Experience showed that the local health services in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia
and Montenegro) needed help in several areas.
<P>
A broad, on-site health operation ought to have six primary assistance
targets. It should:
<OL>
<LI>monitor health, nutrition, food security, and environmental
conditions;
<LI>provide essential health supplies to meet health emergencies,
to prepare for cold weather and upsurges in fighting;
<LI>circulate information on priority health issues;
<LI>prevent and control epidemics of, for example, typhus, haemorrhagic
fever, tuberculosis, influenza, relapsing fever, meningitis, typhoid
fever, diphtheria, shigellosis, cholera and other diarrhoeal diseases;
<LI>develop skills and procedures that can be transferred to public
health care in peacetime; and
<LI>set priorities for system reconstruction and reform, and develop
options for the rebuilding process, including the role of key
public health institutions such as health ministries and polyclinics.
</OL>
<img src="ar17.gif" align=right>
<H2>War injuries</H2>

<P>
According to Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities, the death rate
directly due to war injuries in 1995 was 5.8 per 1000 inhabitants.
That is roughly
<P>
equal to the natural death rate (6.8 per 1000) in the same region.

<P>
War injuries posed a terrible public health threat throughout
the mission area. WHO supported vital emergency and rehabilitation
services with supplies and training.
<P>
About half of all supplies provided by WHO in 1995 went to clinics
and hospitals treating the war injured. The rest was used in public
health kits and customized kits for the treatment of communicable
diseases and for reproductive and mental health. Field offices
organized training on treating the physical and psychological
effects of war injuries.
<P>
The physical rehabilitation programme was expanded throughout
the mission area. Many more prosthetic devices were produced locally
in WHO-established orthopaedic workshops, subsidized by the Finnish
and Swedish governments. The needs of vulnerable groups such as
the chronically ill, children, elderly and soldiers coming home
were highlighted. Model communitybased programmes for rehabilitation
and mental health were established and expanded.
<HR>

<H2>Cluster bombing</H2>

<P>
In early May 1995, Zagreb was hit by cluster bombs, injuring hundreds
of civilians and killing some. Street scenes of the aftermath
were televized worldwide, telling their own story. WHO moved to
assist at hospitals caring for victims of the shelling. Among
those needing emergency aid was the Children's Hospital, which
had taken a direct hit. WHO shunted supplies to it to help ease
the burden.

</TABLE>

<H2></H2>

<HR>

<H2>Outbreaks of communicable diseases</H2>

<P>
Common diseases are common everywhere. So it's part of our job
to say that, when you hear hoofbeats approaching, chances are
it&Otilde;s horses, not zebras. That is a common cold, we might
say, not tularaemia. WHO helped distinguish the common from the
exotic. We helped quell panic and arranged for scarce resources
to be put to the best use.<BR>

<P>
Last year, rumours circulated that one side was engaged in biological
warfare. WHO confirmed that a respiratory outbreak was caused
by nonvirulent microbes normally present in the environment, not
some exotic contagion. Social scientists set about calming the
edgy community.
<H2>Influenza</H2>

<P>
Influenza season hit rather late last year and rather hard, although
there were no more deaths than usual. The number of reported influenza
cases peaked in early March and the rate continued high into April.
<P>
WHO attempted to deliver flu vaccine to high-risk groups. But
this was stopped when it became apparent that the vaccine was
being diverted for military use.
<P>
More than 23,700 cases of flu were reported in Bosnia (excluding
Herzegovina) in 1995, as compared with 3,864 the year before.
Undoubtedly war influences reporting and statistics, but the total
was many times higher than in 1994.

<img src="ar18a.gif" align=right>

<H2>Tuberculosis</H2>

<P>
Since December 1993, WHO has directly supported tuberculosis (TB)
control in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).
<P>
Accessible high-priority hospitals and general practitioners&Otilde;
surgeries were supplied with anti-TB drugs and prepackaged kits.
These TB kits encourage diagnosis by sputum analysis rather than
expensive X-ray. The recommended treatment regimens were shorter,
with fewer drugs, so there was better patient compliance.
<P>
Before the kits were delivered, TB workers were briefed on current
WHO recommendations for effective TB control. The TB control and
education programme is now in place, endorsed by field offices
and supported by workshops and visiting consultants.
<H2>Rat poison</H2>

<P>
When sanitation collapsed, the rat population soared. That led
to a sudden upswing in rodent-borne diseases, especially the highly
infectious haemorrhagic fever and tularaemia. To halt the contagion,
WHO tried to distribute rat poison.
<P>
But the project caused our logistics unit a lot of trouble. The
warring factions, fearing that the chemicals would be used by
their enemies, insisted upon multiple checks before issuing clearance
to enter their territories. We were hamstrung by legal red tape.

<P>
In the end, WHO&Otilde;s neutral image, cooperation with local
authorities, and a hand from sister agencies such as the Office
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and
the United Kingdom Overseas Development Administration (ODA) allowed
us to set up a reliable supply chain. Rodenticides were delivered
to the neediest spots with the shortest possible delay.
<H2>Tularaemia</H2>

<P>
In late April 1995 three soldiers from Novitravnik in the Zenica
regional hospital were diagnosed with tularemia. Resembling plague,
this bacterial disease is transmitted from rats and other rodents
to humans by insect vectors or by handling infected animals. Lymph
glands are enlarged and the patient runs a high temperature. The
pneumonic form is highly contagious. Antibiotics are used in treatment.
<P>
The diagnoses were confirmed by bacterial cultures transported
by WHO to technicians at a lab in Zagreb. During May another 18
cases were confirmed in the Zenica region&ETH;13 from one municipality
and the others from various places. Over the same period, 47 others
were reported from the Tuzla area. There were allegedly more than
100 other cases around Banja Luka, but details could not be confirmed.
<P>
Fortunately there have been no tularaemia deaths. Response measures
included the distribution of rodent poisons and informing the
public about hygienic measures and possible sources of infection.
<H2>Haemorrhagic fevers</H2>

<P>
Viral haemorrhagic fevers are another story. These acute infections
cause high fever, internal bleeding and shock, and sometimes death.

<P>
Haemorrhagic fever was a real problem in the region. Between December
1994 and May 1995, more than 140 cases were
<P>
reported in the Tuzla area, with a few deaths and several sufferers
needing haemodialysis.
<P>
In Serb-held parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, more than 80 cases
were reported in the first three months of 1995. Serb soldiers
in Banja Luka told of another one or two sufferers being evacuated
every day in that region during the same period.
<P>
Altogether 347 cases of Puumala and Hantaan haemorrhagic fevers
were documented in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1995. There were
confirmed reports from Croatia of 25 cases, mostly in the Rijeka
region, with 3 deaths.
<P>
In response, WHO assisted the local labs in diagnosis. Our field
offices distributed rodenticides to all regions in February.
<hr>

<H2>Lab assistance
</H2>The Bosnia and Herzegovina public health system by tradition is centralized. Remote clinics and physicians had to have communicable disease diagnoses confirmed in the central laboratories of Sarajevo before they could take action.
<P>
But with the city under siege for so long, this wasnt possible. By the time the answer came back, people could be dead.
<P>
Last year WHO took a direct hand in the action. While we couldnt stop the blockade, we could fly over it. When a haemorrhagic fever outbreak was suspected, and local authorities were unable to move promptly, WHO arranged for patient specimens to be flown by United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) to the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control in Stockholm. Answers returned within 24 hours and responses were activated.<P>
In wartime, needs must drive actions. When the system was strained, WHO tried to adapt a flexible problem-solving approach. Flexibility focused on strengthening the skills of local health professionals. This will prove crucial in peacetime.

<HR>
<img src="ar19.gif" align=right>

<H2>Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic fever</H2>

<P>
Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is found in Europe only
in Crim and Kosovo. Up to half the people who contract CCHF die
of it, so the strain is far more virulent than the Puumala and
Hantaan strains found in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. Rodents
are among the wildlife hosts; ticks are the vectors. Traditional
preventive measures are not very effective. In April of 1995 the
disease broke out in Kosovo; several cases were detected. By July
the official number had increased to 60. The public health workers
in Kosovo asked for WHO&Otilde;s expertise in controlling the
contagion.
<P>
Our response was orchestrated at WHO headquarters. The Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States prepared
an expert mission with free-of-charge drugs for all patients,
as well as scientific and technical partnership, for the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).
<P>
Unfortunately, the burst of publicity over the outbreak created
problems with refugee relocation, and the Federal government canceled
the mission when the epidemic seemed to be receding naturally.
In the end there were 116 confirmed CCHF cases; 16 people died.

<H2>Water quality assurance</H2>

<P>
In the winter of 1995, during an intense period of the siege of
Sarajevo, drinking-water became polluted. WHO moved to import
and hand out chlorine tablets to households in some at-risk parts
of the city. Regrettably, other parts were totally inaccessible.

<P>
Health monitoring later revealed big differences in waterborne
diseases between the areas supplied with tablets and the others.
While it is a shame that all households could not be reached,
without a constant field presence and monitoring network, WHO
would not have been able to meet the urgent needs of those neighborhoods
that did get the water purification tablets.
<P>
From the very beginning, water quality has been a top issue. Ensuring
clean water sources to many parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina was
out of the question, so WHO distributed chlorine tablets and testing
kits to the most needy areas. Until safe water supplies can be
guaranteed, we will go on distributing the tablets.
<P>
The WHO European Centre for Environment and Health unit in Nancy,
France, is working with 60 towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina on
the development of water and sanitation systems.
<H2>Information for action</H2>

<P>
Accurate, updated information is as important to WHO as it is
to the military. Knowing exactly when to intervene for health
depends upon what&Otilde;s going on with health right now.
<P>
Perhaps war's greatest inconvenience for public health programmes
is the disruption of information collection. Skirmishes in Bosnia
and Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(Serbia and Montenegro) often severed communications with our
own offices and area health centres.
<P>
Even when the lines were open, the people there who were acting
as information gatherers had left for somewhere else, or were
otherwise occupied with the sick and wounded. Or the computers
and typewriters were broken, or the clinic was out of paper.
<P>
War zones may be impenetrable as a result of battle or just a
lack of fuel to get there.
<P>
Most frustrating, health data are often arbitrarily classified
by one side or the other as military secrets and therefore kept
from release. These are some of the obstacles that WHO met in
its monitoring work.

<img src="ar20.gif" align=right>


<H2>Reporting valuable data</H2>

<P>
In 1995 WHO field staff reinforced their ties with public health
authorities in the nations in conflict. In Mostar, Tuzla and Zenica,
our field offices held frequent meetings with authorities in their
region. Every month the authorities reported valuable information
to our satellite offices.
<P>
From the very beginning of the humanitarian assistance operation,
WHO has stressed the need to bolster national health reporting
systems, particularly for communicable and chronic disease surveillance.
In 1995 we provided 44 computers to the public health institutes
of Bosnia and Herzegovina, following up with training and more
supplies. This project showed immediate rewards and will yield
long-term benefits. An investment in existing systems, no matter
how disrupted, is an investment in their long-term stability.
<P>
In Sarajevo, staff of the WHO field office have met weekly since
1993 with the Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities. Last year, separate
weekly meetings were held with Sarajevo city officials.
<P>
There were ad hoc meetings with local authorities in Serb-controlled
sections of Sarajevo. And WHO field personnel from Belgrade, Sarajevo
and Zagreb all had contacts last year with the Republic agencies
of the Serbian entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina based in Banja
Luka.


<img src="ar21.gif" align=right>

<H2>Surveys</H2>

<P>
When the health information system could not provide enough data,
WHO stepped in to conduct community health surveys for a clearer
picture of conditions.
<P>
In 1995 we made a follow-up nutritional status survey, a poll
of public health in collective refugee shelters, and a study of
smoking among health professionals in Tuzla.
<H2>Public health in collective shelters </H2>

<P>
Mass population dislodgment was typical of 1995. Half the population
of Bosnia and Herzegovina was uprooted. The added number and size
of collective shelters for displaced persons meant extra attention
to their sanitary facilities. The field offices in Tuzla and Zenica
made detailed surveys of refugee health status in the region.

<P>
The data derived were used to formulate management action plans
to:
<UL>
<LI>conduct regular water testing;
<LI>improve sanitation by ensuring at least 1 toilet per 20 people;
<LI>organize outreach teams to provide adequate nursing and psychological
support;
<LI>dispense rodent control supplies;
<LI>furnish all refugee centres with at least one working rubbish
container;
<LI>donate flu vaccine to the elderly; and
<LI>distribute basic hygiene kits.
</UL>
<img src="ar22.gif" align=right>

<H2>Nutrition monitoring</H2>

<P>
In December 1994, WHO made nutrition and food security surveys
in Sarajevo, Tuzla and Zenica. Follow-ups were done in February
1995 to find out what had happened during the severe winter of
1994/1995 and to identify special groups at risk.
<H2>Nutrition survey findings</H2>

<P>
Overall, the nutritional status of children, adults and the elderly
remained fairly satisfactory during the winter of 1994/1995. In
fact, compared to the winter before, younger and older adults
were better nourished:
<UL>
<LI>chronic disease was the most commonly reported cause of illness,
especially in the elderly;
<LI>household food stocks were 2 &ETH; 4 times greater in February
1995 than in February 1994;
<LI>food prices dropped dramatically over the same period;
<LI>food aid distribution improved;
<LI>obesity is an increasing problem;
<LI>in the brief interval between December 1994 and February 1995,
access to heating, electricity and water improved; and
<LI>the majority of households in Sarajevo and Zenica had received
water purification tablets by February 1995.
</UL>

<H2>Health on the road</H2>

<P>
On 7 August 1995, a group of some 25,000 followers of the businessman
Fikret Abdic fled from Velika Kladusa in the Bihac pocket of Bosnia
and Herzegovina and headed towards Croatia. Seeking asylum, they
crossed the border but were not permitted to proceed beyond a
valley about 17 km north of Velika Kladusa. Unable to go ahead
and afraid to turn back, they set up camp on the spot with what
little they had.
<P>
A few farmhouses in the valley were quickly occupied. Other, less
fortunate people turned to cars, trucks and shelters made of branches,
leaves and corn stalks. The entire 5-km stretch of valley was
packed with people, since most opted to stay close to the road
for security. Conditions quickly deteriorated as people defecated
on the nearby ground, and water sources were polluted.
<P>
As soon as humanitarian agencies were allowed into the camp, the
top priorities were food, water, shelter and sanitation. The aid
mission needed coordination both in the field and in Zagreb to
ensure an optimal response from all parties involved. WHO took
the lead through conferences with NGOs, local refugee workers
and the Croatian health authorities.
<P>
Progress in water purification and basic sanitation was slow and
difficult. Pit latrines dug in the valley flooded over as soon
as the rains came, leaving stretches of the valley like open sewers.
The only stream was heavily contaminated, as were the few wells.
One or two springs were safe for drinking.
<P>
Not surprisingly, the potential for diarrhoeal diseases to spread
like wildfire was great. But outbreaks of shigellosis, dysentery
and hepatitis A were quickly spotted and controlled by water treatment.
<P>
Many young refugees in the camp were wounded during the years
of fighting. In the camp clinic there were 11 paraplegics and
7 hemiplegics plus many amputees and others with external bone
fixators to stabilize fractures. WHO&Otilde;s rehabilitation team
took stock of the situation and started basic training for paramedics
who could do on-site primary physical rehabilitation.
<P>
Two paramedics already involved in the care of this group were
given rehabilitation training. Basic equipment for limb mobilization
and physiotherapy kits helped with exercise
<P>
training.
<P>
WHO also worked behind the scenes, lobbying for improvement in
access to hospital care. When this did not happen, efforts were
made to improve conditions in the Kupljensko camp.
<P>
Today the camp is still there, though the number of occupants
has dropped from the initial 25,000 to about 6,000. Women, children
and the elderly were the first to leave and return to Velika Kladusa
as winter came.The Pending health crisis bulletin (issued from
May to September) provided NGOs and the international community
with critical data on disease outbreaks and war wounded, as well
as issues related to health and human rights.

<H2>Beyond advice</H2>

<P>
Delivering the right supplies to the right people at the right
place at the right time is one of the cornerstones of humanitarian
aid. WHO's ability to coordinate, deliver directly, and
fill gaps in supply needs enhanced the effectiveness of all public
health programmes during the war.
<P>
When the health care system in Bosnia and Herzegovina collapsed,
one of the worst results was the cut-off of supplies to hospitals
and clinics. That is where outside humanitarian aid counted. What
happened, however, was that well meaning groups sent in many of
the wrong medical supplies, glutting storage depots and actually
doing more harm than good.
<P>
Too many donations were damaged by poor packing, or comprised
mixed or unlabelled medication, expired drugs, and the like. Handling
such donations consumed the resources of humanitarian agencies
and professionals who were working in the field under difficult
and dangerous conditions.
<P>
WHO therefore went all out to coordinate supply activities. It
wasn't easy. WHO still chairs regular coordination conferences
on drug distribution in each field office. Local health authorities
and the humanitarian organizations concerned take an active part.
Priorities are set and drug supply plans laid for each agency
involved.

<img src="ar24.gif" align=left>

<H2>Setting donor guidelines</H2>

<P>
The chaotic supply situation was corrected by donor guidelines
and an essential drug list drawn up by WHO. The guidelines ex-plain
supply procedures and offer simple suggestions for making donations
useful, easy and safe to handle.
<P>
Implementation of WHO's essential drugs policy has led
to a supply of high-quality medicines at affordable prices.
<H2>Mostar and Sarajevo: cases in point</H2>

<P>
In Sarajevo, WHO's donor guidelines have been rigorously
followed since the initiation of the airlift. UNHCR refused to
transport medical supplies that did not comply with our guidelines.
The result has been an efficient delivery of supplies with few
unusable leftovers.
<P>
In Mostar, the situation was reversed. Lack of any policy for
donations, plus multiple supply channels, led to random deliveries
to end-user hospitals, which were ill prepared to receive the
aid. Management of drug supply and storage, logistics and monitoring
was haphazard. The result: stockpiling of some 300 tons of unusable
drugs, many outdated, created critical shortages of space for
essential medicines.
<P>
Today, the Mostar situation is being corrected. Along with Pharmaciens
sans fronti&egrave;res (PSF), WHO has set up a programme to bring
order out of chaos. It is funded by the European Union Administration
of Mostar (EUAM).
<P>
Procurement, storage, distribution, use and disposal are the main
aims. Key storehouses have been renovated, the drug manual updated,
computerized stock monitoring installed, and personnel trained
with the help of local health authorities.

<img src="ar25.gif" align=right>

<H2>WHO kits: meeting the needs of many</H2>

<P>
During 1995, WHO supplies continued to take a "kit approach".
Kits are prepackaged boxes of basic instruments and drugs. They
contain all that's needed for a defined patient population
over a set period of time.
<P>
Some, such as the emergency health kit, the surgical kit and anaesthetic
kit, were designed to meet the needs of the civil population in
this war. The kits helped health workers cope with local supply
problems. 1995 saw several improvements in the kit programme.
Instruction manuals were developed. Training courses on the use
of the kits were expanded. The kit approach was successful. It
is becoming the standard way to deal with humanitarian emergencies
anywhere in the world.
<img src="ar26.gif" align=right>

<H3>WHO kits for public health include:</H3>

<UL>
<LI>chronic disease kit
<LI>clinical chemical laboratory kit
<LI>clinical microbiological laboratory kit
<LI>epidemic response kit
<LI>general practitioner kit
<LI>hygiene kit
<LI>insulin kit
<LI>mental health kit
<LI>new emergency kit
<LI>pneumonia kit
<LI>reproductive health kit
<LI>tuberculosis kit
<LI>vitamin kit.
</UL>

<H3>WHO kits for war injuries include:</H3>

<UL>
<LI>anaesthetic kit;
<LI>anaesthetic supplementary kit;
<LI>bandage supplementary kit;
<LI>clean intermittent catheterization kit;
<LI>major rehabilitation equipment kit;
<LI>parenteral fluids (IV fluids) kit;
<LI>physiotherapy kit;
<LI>splint kit;
<LI>splint tool kit;
<LI>surgical kit;
<LI>transfusion kit.
</UL>

<P>
Ironically, the most popular pack of all contains no medicine.
The hygiene kit holds basic supplies such as soap, toothpaste
and brushes, toilet paper and the like. WHO supplied this kit
in response to a largely unrecognized demand. Not many agencies
were willing to donate such simple items, since they were not
considered to be medical or emergency supplies. Yet WHO decided
to send in the hygiene kits because the items inside were indeed
essential to the basic public health needs of the population.
<H2>Filling the gaps</H2>

<P>
Blood supplies augmented the kits, and our field officers identified
the various needs of traumatized populations. In the days of the
heaviest siege of Sarajevo, when the army of Bosnia and Herzegovina
tried unsuccessfully to raise the siege, we delivered bulk quantities
of water purification tablets; clean drinking-water was a top
priority.
<P>
WHO was recognized as the major, if not the only, health supply
provider in some parts of the mission region. Our reputation as
a fair and neutral agency often helped us gain access to people.
Delivering kits designed by Denmark, we are the sole regular providers
of disposable laboratory materials and anti-TB drugs.
<H2>Spare parts for hospitals</H2>

<P>
Direct shelling, power failures and general aging added to the
degeneration of a great deal of hospital equipment, handicapping
local health workers. After a WHO consultant was assigned to survey
the situation, specific pieces of equipment were
<P>
ordered for delivery to specified hospitals and clinics.
<P>
Once again, the nonconsumable nature of these shipments caused
delivery problems. Once again, the trouble, as the warring factions
saw it, was that these were not medical supplies, so they fell
under different regulations.
<P>
Authorities were suspicious of the destination of this hardware.
The amount and cost of items such as computers and paper understandably
provoked suspicions.
<P>
The very specific health destination of every single item called
for extraordinary precision in the delivery process, placing far
more strain than usual on our Logistics Unit.
<P>
Finally, after lengthy negotiation and perseverance, WHO managed
to deliver all the goods to all the appropriate institutions.
And, again, we could not have done it alone. Our reputation and
cooperation with other agencies were crucial in getting the supplies
into the right hands.
<H2>Child immunization</H2>

<P>
WHO experts tagged measles- mumps-rubella vaccines as a top health
priority item in 1995. We provided these vaccines to the entire
mission region, immunizing children in a joint project with UNICEF,
the International Medical Group (an NGO) and local doctors.

<img src="ar28.gif" align=left>

<H2>Logistics</H2>

<P>
During the war, WHO built up a small but effective distribution
apparatus. A Bedford truck and several four-wheel-drive vans and
armored vehicles speeded the delivery of medical and related supplies.

<P>
Shifts in the war influenced WHO's logistical operations.
Constant access to besieged Sarajevo was ensured by the WHO presence
in Ancona: the hub of the UNHCR airlift operation, the longest
airlift in history.
<P>
We opened our logistics office in Ancona in January 1995. The
unit went right to work, doing a good job of supplying Sarajevo.
<P>
Unfortunately, the threats and attacks of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), the Serbian offensive in the east and the
unsuccessful counteroffensive in Sarajevo halted the airlift for
much of the time. That disrupted our ability to deliver the vital
goods. But working closely with UNHCR, UNPROFOR and other agencies
put us in a position to resume our mission the moment the airlift
resumed.
<P>
Besides curtailing the supplies allowed in, the war activities
and sanctions made it very difficult to obtain fuel and vehicle
spare parts. That led to a shortage of transport.
<H2>Changes in 1995</H2>

<P>
Important data had to be made more visible. So the WHO logistics
and medical supply units asked suppliers to list batch numbers
and expiry dates on the front of each of the packed boxes.
<P>
During the second quarter of 1995, UNHCR decided to move its major
supply point from Split to Metkovic, a small town in the Neretva
delta of Croatia. WHO followed and opened a supply centre in Metkovic.

<P>
<img src="ar29.gif" align=right>

Our facilities and workers were moved to a new location in the
Razvitak warehouse complex, providing crucial access to the UNHCR
supply chain.
<P>
The presence of our people in Metkovic enabled us to cope with
the ever-changing customs regulations of local authorities. WHO
has maintained good relations with health officials throughout
the mission area, allowing us to move our shipments quickly and
effectively.
<HR>
<img src="ar27.gif" align=left border=5>

<H2>Emergency bloodlift: responding to crisis</H2>

<P>
One shining example last year of WHO supply efforts was the delivery
of more than 800 units of blood, flown in from Scotland to Sarajevo
hospitals.
<P>
Intensive shelling of Sarajevo stopped routine WHO blood supply
airlifts in April. The need for externally supplied blood became
critical in June and July. The donor public was suffering increased
anaemia. Local Sarajevo blood centres could not fill the need.
<P>
The Sarajevo office organized an emergency airlift of blood, brought
by Royal Air Force (RAF) aircraft from the United Kingdom into
Split, Croatia. ODA financed the coordination of a special appeal
to Scottish and English transfusion centres. They responded generously
and quickly.
<P>
RAF planes brought in the blood. WHO field staff arranged for
refrigerated van transport to Metkovic, where the blood was held
overnight. Sarajevo field staff drove two vehicles across Mt Igman
to pick it up. They came under fire on the way out, but returned
without incident. In Sarajevo the blood was used to save lives
after the August market-place massacre.
<P>
Such speedy delivery allows no room for error. Three years of
experience in the region have proved the WHO supply chain to be
smooth and dependable.
<P>
WHO cannot do it alone. Particularly in transport, UNHCR and ODA
have been notable partners. Excellent cooperation with the ODA
convoy team continued throughout 1995. Large parts of the Metkovic
warehouse supply were moved in by the ODA team, which also handled
some field distribution. ODA has also most generously serviced
WHO vehicles without charge at its depots.

<H1>Capacity building</H1>
<br clear=left>
<hr>
</center>

<P>
How can war-related humanitarian aid bolster local capacities
to deal with the added health burdens of war?
<P>
<img src="ar29.gif" align=left border=5>

War demands different health interventions for which technical
skills are not readily available. No country in the world has
a health system adequately pre-pared for war. Even highly skilled
and educated workers are simply overwhelmed by the massive problems
of armed conflict.
<P>
Resources are strained to the breaking point. Working conditions
are abominable. The needs of entire populations exceed the capabilities
of even a fully func-tioning health care system. In addition to
the enormous burden on health services, health workers themselves
must survive the carnage. They suffer the same traumas as everyone
else, plus the daily tragedies of their patients.
<P>
Continuous education for health professionals is a prerequisite
for dealing with unforeseen emergencies and to provide moral and
psychological support.
<P>
Through field offices and external consultants, WHO has held seminars
and sponsored other programmes for the continuing education of
health professionals and auxiliaries in many areas.

<img src="ar31.gif" align=right>

<H2>Physical rehabilitation</H2>

<P>
WHO's project for the rehabilitation of war victims aims
to help people with physical disabilities regain their sense of
personal dignity. It works for the restoration of optimal health,
self-support, ability realization and social integration.
<P>
The strategy is to work through health ministries and draw upon
existing health care resources. This entails working hand in hand
with the local community and health professionals.
<P>
The project has focused on people with the most severe disabilities
- amputations, spinal cord injuries and traumatic brain injuries - who
account for more than 20% of all disabled war victims in need
of rehabilitation.
<P>
The magnitude of these rehabilitation needs is very large. As
a rule there would be beds enough at existing centres if standard
patient discharge procedures were followed. But many of these
places are overcrowded because they are unable to discharge disabled
persons into society. Normal social and family support networks
have broken down.
<P>
So new rehabilitation approaches are needed, as well as more modern
equipment and better trained personnel. The approaches should
support and motivate communities to accept and integrate these
people. They should teach professionals new ways to provide care
and de-emphasize care in institutions.
<H2>Regional rehabilitation model</H2>

<P>
WHO introduced community-based rehabilitation (CBR) as the primary
model. CBR is a strategy for physical reconditioning and social
reintegration of physically challenged people into their communities.
A combined biological, psychological and social approach encourages
effective and efficient rehabilitation.
<P>
In addition to providing muchneeded rehabilitation assistance,
this project fosters community participation in the structure
and functioning of the CBR centre, so the international support
may be phased out after the first year of operation.
<P>
In 1995, WHO's physical rehabilitation unit developed a
regional model (see box p. 33) around community-based principles
and the United Nations standard rules for people with disabilities.
The CBR regional model is being applied in Mostar and Bihac, and
is planned in Tuzla, Zenica, Sarajevo, Banja Luka, western Vojvodina,
Eastern Slavonia and Zagreb.
<P>
WHO devised rehabilitation teaching packets, distributing them
last year to all our field offices and to rehabilitation centres
and relevant NGOs. The packets include patient information and
self-care materials, assessment forms, home exercises and selected
scientific articles. All documents were translated into local
languages.

<img src="ar32.gif" align=right>

<H2>Prosthesis production and supply</H2>

<P>
Prostheses are needed everywhere in the region and will be needed
for many years to come. The current capacity for local production
is far below current needs.
<P>
Thousands of amputees are on the waiting lists and the backlog
will grow as temporary prostheses wear out and as land mines continue
to do their inevitable damage to this war-torn region.
<P>
In WHO's physical rehabilitation project, kits have been particularly
useful. WHO designed and distributed several kinds of these kits
throughout the region, including:
<UL>
<LI>a major rehabilitation kit containing essential items for
assessment and exercise therapy for field rehabilitation clinics;
<LI>a physiotherapy kit with minor equipment for assessment and
therapy;
<LI>a splint kit with thermoplastic materials for hand and foot
splinting for patients with brain and peripheral nerve injuries;
and
<LI>a splint tool kit for fabrication of splints.
</UL>
<img src="ar33.gif" align=right>

<P>
Even so, field kits will not meet future demands. Accordingly,
a major part of the rehabilitation project has been to prepare

<P>
communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia to meet local
demands with local resources.
<P>
WHO, in collaboration with the Finnish Red Cross, installed machines
for making permanent prostheses last year in Splitske Toplice
and Topusko. A local team, under the guidance of a WHO orthopaedic
engineer, has already started production. Two international consultants
surpervised the prosthesis fitting, manufacturing and procurement.
<P>
In Splitske Toplice, 87 amputees were fitted with a permanent
lower limb prosthese and 41 with temporary devices. A WHO mobile
team supplied patients in their home cities. We also delivered
material to manufacture 250 training and permanent lower limb
prostheses to the Bihac Regional Prosthesis Workshop.
<P>
In November 1995, WHO established an orthopaedic workshop at the
Velmos hospital in East Mostar. Devices will be produced for an
estimated 800 amputees on both sides of the city and the entire
surrounding region. Two local technicians were recruited; one
was a shoemaker and the other, a carpenter before joining WHO.
Today these men produce lower limb prostheses under supervision
of a WHO consultant from Splitske Toplice.

<img src="ar34.gif" align=right>

<H2>Psychosocial rehabilitation: Meeting today's needs, building
for tomorrow</H2>

<P>
War scars people. Entire populations face a massive threat to
their mental health. The shock to the population has many repercussions
for individuals, families and society as a whole. Disorders related
to traumatic stress emerge. Normal people begin to suffer from
anxiety, depression, nightmares, flashbacks and severe mood and
attention difficulties. These can occur immediately or be delayed
for months or even years. New traumas can provoke the return of
old symptoms.
<P>
An immediate clue to this in the mission region has been the tremendous
increase in people seeking help from mental health services for
trauma-related disorders.
<P>
Reports from local and international aid workers confirm a sharp
increases in substance abuse, suicide and homicide, and other
problems.
<P>
WHO has already published figures indicating that over 1 million
people in the mission area were in urgent need of psychological
help. The continued fighting right up to the peace agreement,
the severe human rights abuses, and the masses of homeless people
on the move may well have pushed up these estimates.
<P>
Current helping capacity is
<P>
estimated to cover only 1&ETH;2% of needs. The factors that aid
in recovery from traumatic experiences, especially caring support
from families and social institutions, are completely disrupted.
<P>
To help meet this urgent demand, WHO has continued applying a
system of regional models for mental health.
<P>
Mental health regional models have so far been applied in Mostar,
Sarajevo and Tuzla (Bosnia and Herzegovina), Kotor (Montenegro,
in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) and Split (Croatia).
<H2>Local professionals lead</H2>

<P>
Local professionals are carrying out the different elements of
the regional models. Their work is supported by international
teachers and up-to-date educational materials. A basic book, <I>Trauma
and healing under war conditions</I>, is being translated.
<P>
Training programmes for mental health and primary care health
workers have focused on war-related trauma and their sequelae.
Two hundred professionals are participating in unique post-trauma
therapy (PTT) training programmes.
<P>
These PTT programmes are one-year postgraduate courses for psychologists
and psychiarists. They combine training with space for self-care.
They provide support for professionals confronting both their
private traumas and the traumas of their patients. PTT is the
first systematic training programme of its kind in the world.
<P>
Training is also being provided in conjunction with UNICEF, and
MSF (Holland) for general practitioners, psychological aides and
social workers.
<H2>Meeting the needs</H2>

<P>
In 1995, WHO continued to provide crucial mental health supplies
of all kinds in kits. The kits for mental hospitals contain enough
key psychopharmacological drugs and medical essentials to treat
50 psychiatric inpatients a month.
<P>
In 1995 we distributed 373 kits in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia
and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).
<H2>Next steps</H2>

<P>
Model community-oriented mental health centres will be developed
within each regional model area. WHO plans to assist the efforts
of local NGOs, specializing in psychosocial programmes to introduce
more social and occupational activities into existing mental health
systems.
<HR>

<H2>Mostar Kayak Club</H2>

<P>
A model CBR centre was completed in Eastern Mostar at the end
of 1995 (official opening on 1 February 1996). This project has
been the result of a dynamic collaboration between the Regional
Medical Centre (RMC) of Mostar, EUAM, and WHO. The Mostar Kayak
Club was reconstructed by EUAM and now houses the Mostar CBR centre,
which will be used by the RMC free of charge for the next five
years. WHO provided rehabilitation equipment and extensive training
for local health professionals.
<HR>

<H2>Regional models</H2>

<P>
The regional model approach is a coordinated set of health activities
for a defined geographic area with a population of 300 000-400
000. These models are being applied in WHO projects for both mental
health and physical rehabilitation.
<P>
A model works as follows.
<OL>
<LI>WHO staff bring together all relevant IGOs, NGOs, national
authorities and professionals serving the targeted region. This
group develops a strategic action plan.
<LI>Needs and resources are assessed.
<LI>Training is provided for health professionals in community-oriented
approaches.
<LI>Model projects are initiated.
<LI>Projects are supplied with appropriate kits and other equipment
and supplies.
<LI>Linkages are established between local, regional and international
activities.
</OL>

<P>

<HR>
<img src="ar35.gif" align=left>

<H2>Advocacy and human rights</H2>

<P>
The human rights concept and recovery after traumatization are
linked in many ways. To put this message across, WHO produced
teaching material for public use. <I>Every day is a human rights
day</I> points up these connections.
<P>
The United Nations Declaration on Human Rights has been signed
by nations all over the world. Respect for human rights is also
part of everyday life for all human beings. In peace time, under
democratic conditions, most people take their human rights for
granted. Human rights are integrated in society as part of culture
and behaviour. Under war conditions human rights are often violated.
It may happen systematically, on purpose on the collective level.
It may also happen more occasionally on the individual level.
Violations may be carried out by the enemy or by one&Otilde;s
own compatriots. Violations may be carried out by one&Otilde;s
neighbours or by oneself. The human rights perspective condemns
all violations, no matter who the violators are. It is a universal
ethical and moral stand.
<P>
All WHO psychosocial seminars emphasize the relationship between
mental health and the need to respect human rights. <BR>

<P>
How can WHO activities shift from short-term humanitarian assistance
to a long-term focus on development?
<P>
With the signing of the Dayton peace agreement, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)
now face the challenges of making a stable peace. What the actors
do in this transition period will determine what the future holds
for their countries.
<P>
If humanitarian aid is not linked to rehabilitation and recovery
programmes, peace will be threatened.
<P>
WHO humanitarian assistance is at the root of health rehabilitation.
We have taken the lead in health reform and are applying the lessons
of nearly four years of emergency relief to the reconstruction
process.
<P>
Humanitarian assistance in the war has always been aimed at providing
emergency relief while preparing for peace through capacity building,
planning and working with national health authorities, and coordinating
with partner organizations.
<P>
Several projects were started last year aimed at smoothing the
transition to peace. The Mostar mental health seminars and the
restoration of essential services in Sarajevo are prime examples
of the cross-over from emergency aid to a sustainable health system.
<H2>Mostar: the neediest of cities</H2>

<P>
Mostar is a particularly sad testament to the war. At different
times all three factions in Bosnia and Herzegovina were fighting
in this area. Clashes between them from 1992 through 1994 simply
destroyed the city. Today it remains fragmented along ethnic lines.
<P>
In 1995, WHO arranged 33 gatherings and training sessions with
health professionals of both East and West Mostar; 9 dealt with
general public health, 14 with drugs and supply, and 10 with mental
health.
<P>
As part of the drug supply management project in Mostar, we arranged
for the exchange of substantial quantities of drugs, of which
there was a surplus on one side of town and a shortage on the
other.
<P>
The mental health seminars held in Mostar and in Sarajevo helped
bring war-separated doctors back together. After getting an exceptional
clearance from their respective sides in January, the delegates
arrived in white United Nations cars at the Hotel Ero in Mostar.

<P>
For the first time in more than two years, they sat down in the
same room and talked.
<P>
At the end of the first work session, one doctor turned to a colleague
across the table and summed up the feeling in the room. &quot;We
did not like what your people did to us during the war,&quot;
he said, &quot;but at least we understand now that it was not
you, our colleagues, who were shooting at us. You were trying
to take care of those in need, as we did.&quot;

<img src="ar38.gif" align=left>

<H2>Restoring essential services</H2>

<P>
The health structure in Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially in
Sarajevo, mostly collapsed. Many hospitals were leveled, while
building damage and equipment failure put others out of action.
Throughout the war, primary care centres have been the main source
of formal help for most people.
<P>
The Japanese government donated funds for the Sarajevo field office
to repair general practitioners' surgeries in all parts of the
city. These so-called ambulantas provide primary care services.
More than 50 of them had been destroyed beyond repair.
<P>
Working with the Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator
for Sarajevo, WHO used local building contractors to make urgent
repairs to 27 ambulantas. More will be restored in the coming
months.

<H2>Can WHO help stop war?</H2>

<P>
Health is a key element of the peace process. But can health help
stop war? WHO believes that health workers can contribute in important
ways.
<P>
The nearly four-year war has separated many health professionals
who were once colleagues. Disease leaps geopolitical borders.
Throughout 1995, WHO supported the political peace process through
bringing health workers together to discuss mutual problems and
develop joint actions.
<P>
Health workers tend to be open-minded, sharing a common sense
of humanity and responsibility for the sick and injured. With
a little bit of help, therefore, these people can be instrumental
leaders in the reconciliation process.
<P>
Without joint efforts, there are no effective interventions. Rodent
control is a good example. It makes no sense to lay rat control
plans in one part of a city and not in another.
<P>
Through several initiatives, WHO has been building a bridge for
humanitarian assistance in health and peace.
<H2>Airport meetings</H2>

<P>
In 1995, we organized and chaired four epidemiological meetings
at Sarajevo airport, attended by both Bosnia and Herzegovina government
and Bosnian Serb delegates. The meetings addressed communicable
disease epidemiology and rodent control for the greater Sarajevo
area.
<P>
Owing to the meetings' sensitive nature, minutes were not taken.
Instead, short points in management action plans were listed at
the end of each meeting. Unfortunately, even these elementary
planning sessions were halted during the intensive shelling of
Sarajevo in the spring and summer of 1995.
<P>
Starting in 1994, WHO and the Norwegion Medical Association have
brought together medical society representatives of the warring
parties several times.
<P>
The medical society representatives agreed to lobby their respective
governments for the free flow of humanitarian aid, freedom to
treat each other's patients in hospital, and the protection
of health facilities and workers. It is hard to judge the practical
effects of these initiatives. Since these meetings started, however,
there seem to have been fewer attacks on hospitals. Where WHO
was once criticized by the warring parties for working on all
sides, collaboration with WHO is now accepted by all.<BR>

<H1>After the crisis</H1>

<img src="ar41.gif">
</center>
<P>
The WHO presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) has led to more
knowledge about the health of war-torn populations and the needs
of health services in relation to resources. This knowledge has
been put to good use by all concerned. But what happens now?
<P>
In 1996 and beyond, we are stressing the importance of linking
relief to rehabilitation. The WHO field offices will continue
to provide emergency relief while advising on health care system
reform. Our aim is to ensure higher health standards while local
authorities resume responsibility for health and reduce the need
for relief aid.
<H2>Bosnia and Herzegovina </H2>

<P>
Responding to the overwhelming urgency in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
we are assisting the health ministries there in laying a long-term
reconstruction strategy while spotting and meeting short-term
needs. An effective management mechanism and coordination structure
are indispensable to that strategy.
<P>
This calls for intensive management training for key policy-makers
and managers, a health care development strategy, a physical infrastructure
plan, and physical and mental health rehabilitation programmes.
<H2>Moving towards health for all</H2>

<P>
WHO is engaged on several fronts in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
<P>
Policy planning. Consistent with a well established pattern of
assistance to Member States, WHO will continue to support health
authorities on all levels in developing action plans that foster
a long-term vision while addressing short-term needs. This work
extends to policies in high-priority areas transcending national
boundaries, such as rehabilitation, pharmaceuticals, immunization,
and the environment.
<P>
Needs assessment. Drawing on our network of field offices and
Coordinating and Reference Centres, and our contacts with experts
worldwide, we will work with the republic and regional institutes
of public health to evaluate current health
status and services.
<P>
Technical assistance. WHO staff and outside consultants will offer
continuing technical assistance in areas ranging from communicable
diseases, nutrition, woman and child health, mental health and
rehabilitation to basic infrastructure issues such as public health
engineering, hospital and other facility design and management,
and medical supplies and equipment.
<P>
Training. Given the acute need for training health professionals,
skill building in many specialties and managing reform and reconstruction
strategy,
<P>
WHO is drawing heavily on its experience in capacity building courses (for example,
within the regional models for mental health and physical rehabilitation).
<P>
Project development. Support for the reform and reconstruction
effort in Bosnia and Herzegovina calls for extraordinary efforts
in all areas and contributions by many donors. WHO will help develop
projects targeted to urgent needs. WHO will run selected projects
in areas of its special expertise, in consultation with the health
ministries, regional and local professionals, and other international
agencies.
<P>
Programme coordination. WHO will continue to encourage information
sharing among domestic and international bodies by organizing
seminars and workshops and circulating a regular update on health
reform and reconstruction to key people throughout Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
<P>
Field presence. A special strength of WHO&Otilde;s field presence
has been the ability of satellite staff to help national and outside
workers tackle problems as they arise. This on-site response capability
will be especially helpful in addressing health reconstruction
issues.
<H2>Croatia</H2>

<P>
As the transition to peace picked up momentum, WHO took part in
a technical fact-finding mission to Croatia organized by the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The team assessed the extent
of war damage in Croatia and its consequences down the line.
<P>
Needs were evaluated in order to assist the Croatian government
to draw up plans for rehabilitation and renewal. Sites were visited
in a number of areas designated by the government. Assistance
was needed for 60,000 refugees and displaced persons, especially
in Eastern Slavonia.
<P>
One third of hospitals and health centres in Croatia were destroyed
during the war and need rebuilding.
<H2>Eastern Slavonia</H2>

<P>
Eastern Slavonia will be supported by the opening of a WHO field
office in Erdut/Osijek. Since we will be working closely with
the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia
(UNTAES), our office will be located near UNTAES headquarters.

<P>
The WHO Special Representative for Croatia will be charged with
bringing both sides together to discuss issues of joint concern
and action planning. An international field officer has been appointed
to cover Eastern Slavonia. Her assignment is to oversee planning and gauge health
needs together with both Croat and Serb professonials.

<img src="ar42.gif" align=right>

<H2>Ten health commissions</H2>


Since 1994, WHO has assigned a senior public health advisor to
the Croatian health minister to assist in health system and reconstruction
planning. The master plan for Croatia is an extension of the WHO
strategy for health for all by the year 2000. The plan implementing
that scheme calls for the formation of 10 commissions on:
<UL>
<LI>primary care;
<LI>basic hospital services;
<LI>health promotion;
<LI>emergency medical services;
<LI>quality of health care assessment;
<LI>rehabilitation of war victims;
<LI>capital investment in health;
<LI>health information systems;
<LI>human resources development;
<LI>a national environment and health action plan.
</UL>


The first draft of the master plan was completed in December 1995.
Translated into English, it has been submitted to WHO and other
international bodies for comment. The WHO Liaison Office coordinates
the ten commissions and handles liaison with the WHO Regional
Office for Europe in Copenhagen and WHO headquarters in Geneva.
<H2>Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)</H2>

<P>
Although not directly damaged by the war, the health care system
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)
is also in transition and in need of substantial outside assistance.
Economic stability will not come overnight; neither will the passage
from political isolation to international interaction.
<P>
The shift is coupled with culturally challenging demographic change,
including the repatriation or integration of as many as 600 000-700
000 refugees and expelled people into society.
<P>
Before the war, the former Yugoslavia was an active Member State
of WHO. Many WHO European health programmes have continued to
operate within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro), despite limited interaction with WHO.
<P>
Whenever the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)
obtains membership in WHO this will help re-establish or strengthen
work for health promoting schools, Healthy Cities projects, accident
prevention and other programmes.
<P>
WHO will continue to provide humanitarian assistance within the
constraints imposed by Member States and donor interest. Efforts
will be made to reintegrate health professionals of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) into networks with
their European colleagues.
<P>
Joint conferences of the medical associations of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Croatia, Slovenia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) will
continue to be arranged by the Norwegian Medical Association and
WHO.
<P>
Other priorities include control of communicable diseases, polio
eradication, immunization programmes, national drug policy, mental
health and rehabilitation, as well as health policy and health
care reform.

<P>
This report is directed to the people who have supported and worked
with WHO in 1995: national governments, international agencies,
NGOs, businesses and private citizens. Your belief in what we
are doing to help the victims of this war is important to us.
Your support provides the means for WHO to do the job we were
set up to do.
<P>
Nearly four years of non-partisan work on and behind the lines
of these battlefields have helped us understand, once again, the
vital importance of linking international knowledge to local events.
<H2>Links save lives</H2>

<P>
This kind of linkage has saved lives and cut suffering in Bosnia
and Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(Serbia and Montenegro).
<P>
WHO-coordinated assistance helped local authorities maintain vital
services, improve care for those with war injuries, and continue
to care for all people, especially those at greatest risk.
<P>
WHO staff in our network of field offices helped ensure that hygiene
and medical supplies went where they should go. Supply gaps were
filled with less and less overlap. Health and nutritional status
was monitored and quick interventions were made whenever serious
threats to public health arose.
<P>
The best testimony to this approach has been not only what happened
but also what didn't happen. With death and suffering all
around, there was no disastrous epidemic. Communicable diseases
did not sweep through the population. Safe water and food supplies
reached the people. The wounded received care.
<H2>Capacity building from day one</H2>

<P>
The past years have also taught us how critical it is not just
to put out a fire, but to start fire prevention: to introduce
health capacity building from day one.
<P>
People and agencies have been strengthened and are better able
to deal with the sorts of problems they are now facing.
<P>
Capacity building is self-sustaining. It makes the system more
normal and human. It provides a pillar of support for care providers
who have to deal with their own traumas as well as with those
of their patients.
<H2>What matters most</H2>

<P>
What has guided WHO action since 1992 is our allegiance to public
health. When forced to take sides, WHO has - and will always -
come down on the side of suffering people. Condemning the actions
of one opponent or the other does not mean sacrificing neutrality.
Rather, it is acting in the spirit of the WHO policy of health
for all. This, to us, is what matters most.
<P>
WHO's Regional Office for Europe moves into 1996 with a sharper
focus on our mission in the world. We thank the people who believe
in WHO's work, our donors for their support, our home and field
staff for their dedication, and all our partners for sharing in
our vision of health.<BR>

<P>
This report has been produced by the Communication and Public
Affairs Unit (CPA) of the WHO Regional Office for Europe through
a "bottom-up process". Its theme and structure were
developed by field office heads and public information staff in
a communications workshop held in January 1996 in Sarajevo. Special
representatives and field office staff wrote draft sections. Margaret
Buter, Public Information Coordinator, Zagreb, reviewed and compiled
these contributions. Gregory Hess, of the WHO Coordination and
Humanitarian Assistance Unit in Copenhagen, along with CPA, edited
these. Fradley Garner, writer, spun the first edited version into
a cohesive whole. The draft was then reviewed by WHO's executive
management and special representatives. CPA integrated their comments.
Mary Stewart Burgher, of the WHO Publications Unit in the Regional
Office, did a final editing.
<P>
Frederik Hardvendel of Cross-Border Communications, Denmark, has
been the art director throughout as well as a contributor of some
photographs. S&oslash;ren Svensen, photographer, generously donated
photographs to illustrate the manuscript. Mich&egrave;le Whyte,
Peter Savage, Adam Norris, Rick Bayles, and Steve Turner of Worldwide
Television News have produced the video version of this report.
<P>
Thanks are due to both named and other contributors. We hope our
field staff can see themselves in this report, although for the
most part their pictures do not appear. We hope our donors will
get a better feel for the work WHO does, and that this report
will lead to greater support for the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Croatia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)
as they cross the bridge to peace.

<H2>WHO Conference on <br>European Health Care Reforms<BR>
Ljubljana, Slovenia 17-20 June
</H2>
</center>
The World Health Organization (WHO) Conference on European Health Care Reforms, to be held in Ljubljana, Slovenia on 17-20 June, will be the centrepiece of discussion and debate by European health politicians, administrators and researchers in 1996. This ministerial-level event, involving the 50 European Member States of WHO, has already aroused wide interest among politicians, experts and international and nongovernmental organizations.
<P>
A charter on health care reform (the Ljubljana Charter) will be presented for adoption by the Conference. Its purpose is to identify a set of principles and action strategies, in line with the European strategy for health for all, that can inspire everyone involved in health care to take part in improving current European health care systems. A draft of the Charter was sent to Member States for review in March 1996.
<P>
An analysis of health care reforms in Europe will be presented at the Conference. Participants will be provided with written documentation covering the following topics:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>values, norms and current health sector development
<LI>reforming public health services
<LI>optimal balance of centralized and decentralized management responsibilities
<LI>responsibilities of ministries of health in reformed health systems
<LI>priority-setting and rationing of health services
<LI>balancing competition and solidarity in health care financing
<LI>allocating capital in investing in health
<LI>ensuring value for money from pharmaceuticals
<LI>improving clinical outcomes and the appropriateness of care
<LI>contracting models and provider competition in Europe
<LI>appropriate role for co-payments
<LI>performance-tied payment systems for providers
<LI>citizen participation and patient choice in reformed health systems
<LI>impact of health care reform on health outcomes
<LI>development and implementation of reform policies: a conceptual  framework
<LI>review of the implementation of health care reforms in the European Region
<LI>health care reform trends in Canada and New Zealand
<LI>public health, health promotion and intersectoral action
<LI>primary health care and health care reforms
<LI>general practitioners and health care reforms
<LI>nursing in primary health care
<LI>hospitals and health care reforms
<LI>expenditure trends in health care reforms
<LI>substitution policies from the perspective of primary health care
<LI>restructuring hospitals and substitution policies
<LI>research and training for health care reforms
<LI>quality of care and health care reforms
<LI>provider management under health care reforms
<LI>health insurance
<LI>equity and health care reforms.
</ol>


All these topics will be discussed at the Conference under two broad themes:
<UL>
<LI>the role of government and the market
<LI>the management of change and support for health care reforms.
</UL>
This important debate will form the basis for the WHO Action Plan on Health Care Reforms in Europe.

<H2><font color=yellow>About World Health Day</H2></font>
The WHO World Health Assembly in its resolution WHA2.35 (1949) "resolves that beginning in 1950 and each year thereafter World Health Day should  appropriately be observed on 7 April by all Member States".  <p>

The day is being celebrated because it is the day that WHO officially came into being  i.e. 7 April 1948 (when Member States had ratified the Constitution). Ever since 1950 a theme related to international public health has been chosen for World Health Day with an appropriate slogan.
<p>
Although 7 April is the official day, the event is celebrated throughout the year.

<H1><font color=yellow>Healthy Cities for a better life in Europe	</H1></font>


Most people in Europe live in towns and cities. These can be wonderful and healthy places, with work, entertainment, education and services close to where people live. But the reality is often different. The health of urban areas is an increasing concern. Poverty, pollution, poor services and growing inequalities are widespread. Some places lack essential infrastructures; in other areas the existing infrastructures are decaying faster than they can be replaced. And, in every city, the relationship of people to each other and to their environment is a fundamental determinant of their wellbeing. Europe continues to become more urbanized, and some of the most intractable public health problems - accidents,  AIDS, drug abuse, respiratory disease and violence - are particularly associated with the interaction between social conditions and the urban environment.
<P>
Today, European cities not only face the challenge to improve the health and quality of life of their own populations but also are partly responsible for the health of people living elsewhere, who are affected by activities in the city and their effects on the local regional and global social and physical environments. As major consumers of non-renewable resources and contributors to global pollution by carbon dioxide and other pollutants, European cities are in the front line of the desire for sustainable development and concern about climate change.
<P>
In many places, decentralization trends are strengthening the remit of local governments to deal with these issues. Cities and urban communities can provide an ideal setting for healthy sustainable development. They also have structures that make joint action between sectors and the involvement of communities easier than at the national level. Municipal authorities can take the lead in bringing together efforts by workplaces, nongovernmental organizations, community groups, nationally and locally run services, education and cultural organizations, and communities to create the vision, strategies and action needed to improve their citys health.
<P>
Yet cities face huge difficulties in taking action.  Some are hindered by administrative systems that hamper rather than promote intersectoral cooperation. They are under increasing financial pressure, and they have difficulties in adapting to rapidly changing political, demographic and economic circumstances.

<H3>How can we make cities healthier?</H3>
Against this background, the WHO Regional Office for Europe created the Healthy Cities project to assist cities to take action for health for all. In January 1987, 11 cities became the founding members of the network. Today, 600 cities in Europe participate in more than 30 national and regional Healthy Cities networks in Europe, and these networks are growing throughout the world.
<P>
The European health for all strategy provides the strategic framework for the project, supplemented by more detailed guidance such as the European Environment and Health Action Plan and Agenda 21.  The implications are that change is needed both in how things are done, as well as in what is done. 
<p>
Of key importance is the need to recognize that health is everybodys business, that action must involve the people who live in the city as well as all relevant sectors, and that the principle of equity should underpin all decision making.
<P>
The agenda for cities includes:

<UL>
<LI>the development of a municipal health plan based on health for all / Agenda 21;
<LI>involving communities in planning and action to improve the health of the city;
<LI>creating new approaches for public health and urban environmental management;
<LI>developing mechanisms to collaborate with all relevant sectors and levels of government; <LI>networking with other cities for exchange of information and mutual support.
</UL>


WHO Healthy Cities networks consist of the following main elements:

<UL>
<LI>the WHO project cities network, which is a network of cities that are committed to a comprehensive approach to working towards and attaining the goals of the project (including a process of systematic monitoring and evaluation that allows experience to be <LI>analysed, and good practices disseminated (see map on back page);
national and subnational Healthy Cities networks, along with EURONET (a forum that facilitates cooperation between the national networks in Europe (see map inside of back <LI>page);
<LI>multicity action plans (MCAPs), implemented by networks of cities working together on specific issues of common concern;
<LI>special (model) projects in cities in central and eastern Europe, to help them carry through  health care and environmental reforms by means of international cooperation, technical twinning arrangements and mechanisms for resource mobilization.
 </UL>


The Healthy Cities project assists cities through a process of mutual learning, international networking and technical assistance. Cities differ widely in their conditions and methods of urban management, as the attached figures illustrate. This gives the European Healthy Cities
network an excellent basis for mutual learning. The project has developed a wide body of knowledge and experience which will soon be considerably augmented by a major review of the second phase of the project due to end in 1997. The following pages list some of the publications and documentation from the Project, a selection of graphs from the Healthy Cities indicators database and maps showing the WHO project cities network and national networks in Europe.

<H2><CENTER>What is the Healthy Cities project? </CENTER></H2>
<P>
The WHO Healthy Cities project (HCP) is a long-term international development project that seeks to put health on the agenda of decision-makers in the cities of Europe and to build a strong lobby for public health at the local level.<P>
Ultimately, the project seeks to enhance the physical, mental, social and environmental wellbeing of the people who live and work in the cities of Europe.<P>
The project is one of WHO's main vehicles for giving effect to the strategy for health for all (HFA). It has forged political, professional and technical alliances for health and uncovered a fertile ground for innovative action at local level, thus significantly strengthening WHO's potential and ability to facilitate and bring about change.<P>
Healthy cities are &quot;field laboratories&quot; for testing HFA initiatives at local level and give important feedback to WHO and Member States that can be used to update and refine the HFA strategy.<P>
The first phase of implementation of the HCP (1987-1992) has been completed and a new phase of action (1993-1998) is underway. Over the past six years, the project has developed into a major public health movement at local level involving networks of over 500 cities throughout Europe and another 300 cities in other parts of the world.<P>
HCP helps change the ways in which individuals, communities, private and voluntary organizations and local governments throughout Europe think about, understand and make decisions about health.<P>
The project applies, at local (city/municipal) level, WHO's strategy for health for all, the principles of health promotion as outlined in the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion and the principles of the European Charter on Environment and Health. A &quot;healthy city&quot; is defined in terms of process and outcome.<P>
A healthy city is not one that has achieved a particular level of health; it is one that is conscious of health and striving to improve it. Thus any city can be part of the healthy cities movement, regardless of its current health status; what is required is a commitment to health and a structure and process to achieve it.<P>
Offering access to numerous local governments, the Healthy Cities networks in Europe are also increasingly recognized by other international agencies as useful vehicles for promoting ideas and engaging cities in action partnerships geared for urban development.<P>
Cities and networks throughout the world look to the European experience with the project for inspiration and guidance.<P>

<OL>
<LI>You think that the implementation of health for all should
be the exclusive responsibility of national governments.
<LI>You think that health is mainly the responsibility of doctors
and nurses.
<LI>You feel that health for all and sustainable development is
too theoretical and irrelevant to your needs.
<LI>You believe in top-down hierarchical management.
<LI>You feel that experts know best what is good for your citizens.
<LI>You feel that Healthy Cities is a luxury and a project for
rich cities only.
<LI>You think that international cooperation is a waste of time.
<LI>You do not want to be different.
<LI>You believe that investing in long-term projects will not
get you re-elected.
<LI>You are too busy.

<P>
Evaluation is an essential component of the WHO Healthy Cities project. By the end of the second phase of the project, WHO and project cities should be able to demonstrate the added value and the impact of their efforts. Project cities represent the testing ground for new ideas and innovative approaches. The project is complex, it has multiple layers of activity both at local and international levels and it covers a wide spectrum of actions in the fields of health policy, health promotion, environmental health, sustainable development, strategic planning, networking, community development and institutional change. <P>
<CENTER><A NAME="Approach"><IMG src="byline.gif" height=13 width=13></A></CENTER>
<H2>The approach </H2>
<P>
<A HREF="#Top">Return to top</A>
<P>
The project evaluation involves two main levels:<UL>
<LI>the <B>macro-level</B> (i.e. the evaluation of the overall international WHO project) and
<LI>the <B>local level</B> (i.e. the in-depth evaluation of the total or aspects of city projects).
</UL>
<P>
Both levels are necessary to generate the evidence that the sponsors and stakeholders (local, national and international) of the project need to continue and sustain their support for Healthy Cities. Furthermore this process will provide the information and the know-how for the hundreds of cities involved in the healthy cities movement around the world who look to the European WHO network for inspiration and guidance.<P>
The macro-level evaluation is initiated and coordinated by WHO in close partnership with project cities. The local-level evaluations are initiated and undertaken by project cities. These are two parallel but clearly interlinked and complementary processes and they should feed into each other. The in-depth evaluation of certain key aspects of the project across project cities (macro-level) will allow a better understanding of the process of change in different socio-cultural environments and the development of alternative model approaches.<P>
The macro-evaluation of the first phase of the WHO project (1988-1992) was mainly focused on the creation of the pre-conditions for change by assessing the structures and mechanisms for the implementation of the project, based on the requirements for participation in the WHO network. <P>

<H2>Evaluation themes </H2>
<P>
<A HREF="#Top">Return to top</A>
<P>
The main themes of the macro-evaluation of the second phase (1993-1997) of the WHO project are: Health policy, Networking and Project management. The emphasis will be on:<OL>
<LI>assessing the products, outcomes and processes relating to health policy making (development and implementation of policies, preparation of health profiles and plans and development of process indicators to measure change)
<LI>identifying and assessing the formal and informal networking mechanisms at international and local levels that facilitate advocacy, innovation, solidarity, inter-sectoral action and use of information technology.
<LI>understanding and assessing project management in the context of its key functions: providing leadership and coordination, catalyzing alliance building and facilitating integration.
</OL>
<P>
Subject areas that cut across the above three theme lines are: Health Promotion, Environmental Health and Sustainable Urban Development, Community Development and the creation of Public Health Infrastructures.<P>

<H2>Psychosocial aspects of HIV and AIDS and the

<H3>Report on a WHO meeting</H3>

WHO Regional Publications,<BR>

1990, 45 pages [E]<BR>

Order No. 1310036<P>
The spread of HIV infection and AIDS depends very much on the way people behave. Those in
some population groups have been successfully persuaded to modify behaviour that put them at
increased risk. How this modification was achieved and how progress can be maintained are
crucial to controlling the spread of HIV. In this context, psychosocial factors have a vital role in
influencing behaviour. These not only determine who is vulnerable, but also help create
opportunities for prevention and determine the obstacles to risk reduction. They may also help
explain what shapes the responses of communities, professionals and policy-makers to the
growing epidemic.<P>
Participants in this fourth in a series of WHO meetings concentrated on four broad areas. They
felt that studies of knowledge, attitudes, behaviour and practices can be a valuable tool for
national AIDS programmes if used appropriately. They emphasized the importance of
maintaining the quality of programme monitoring and evaluation. They identified school and
college students as vital target audiences for AIDS education, and providers of health education
and social services for training in AIDS issues. Finally, they encouraged policy-makers and
programme managers to establish partnerships with journalists, as the mass media remain the
most efficient means of reaching the largest number of people.<P>
This is a useful and encouraging review for decision-makers, managers of national AIDS
programmes, professionals in the health, educational and related sectors, and the general
public.<P>

Reports the findings of a group of experts commissioned to evaluate the acute short-term
effects on health caused by exposure to air pollutants during episodes of smog. Winter-
and summer-type smog exposures are considered separately. The report responds to both
the public demand to be protected and the corresponding need of health authorities to
know when concentrations of specific indicator pollutants reach dangerous levels, what
will be the effects on health, and which measures should be taken to protect the general
population or groups at special risk. Of central concern was the question of whether
protective measures currently used by European countries are effective.<P>
The book opens with an overview of the many factors that complicate efforts to link
specific exposure levels to specific effects on health. Problems identified range from the
substantial variations in the composition of pollutants observed in different locations to
the fact that scavenging by other pollutants may reduce the reliability of ozone as an
indicator of summer smog.<P>
Data on the health effects of winter and summer smog are evaluated in separate chapters.
For winter smog, the report cites epidemiological evidence linking exposure to temporary
changes in pulmonary function, an increase in morbidity among people suffering from
chronic bronchitis, an increase in hospital admissions due to respiratory and
cardiovascular disorders and, during severe episodes, increased mortality. For summer
smog, human studies supported by epidemiological data link typical ozone concentrations
to disturbances in lung function, bronchial reactivity, impaired exercise performance, and
respiratory and other symptoms.<P>

Working and living inside buildings exposes people to all kinds of biological
contaminants, from Legionella pneumophila and tuberculosis to fungi and dust mites.
They cause allergies and illness that account for a large proportion of absenteeism in
schools and workplaces. This report looks at the sort of contaminants that can be found
indoors, in what concentrations, where they come from, and what effect they have on
people's health and wellbeing. It concludes that sampling and analysis methods need
standardizing, the construction and maintenance of buildings need improving, and only if
unavoidable should biocides be used.  In fact, what you spend on maintenance is more
than covered by higher productivity.<P>
The book should be read by government administrators in environmental health, all those
concerned with drawing up and implementing building codes, those responsible for
educational establishments and workplaces, as well as environmental health and
occupational health officers and trade union officials.<P>

Provides air quality guidelines for 28 organic and inorganic substances known to
contribute to the problem of air pollution in Europe. Guideline values, which were
established in consultation with more than 150 experts, are intended to serve as a basis
for the establishment of national standards and other control measures needed to
safeguard public health. For some of the substances, adverse effects on vegetation have
also been considered.<P>
The book has four main parts. The first outlines the methodological problems involved in
assessing the health risks posed by air constituents and contaminants, whether in indoor
or outdoor air. The second and third parts present guideline values for 12 organic and 16
inorganic substances, supported by a summary of available data on sources and routes of
exposure, kinetics and metabolism, effects on experimental animals and in vitro test
systems, and effects on humans. The final part considers the effects of selected inorganic
substances on vegetation, including an explanation of the complex type of air pollution
related to the dramatic deterioration of forests in many parts of Europe. The book
concludes with a summary of health risks associated with air pollution caused by tobacco
smoking.<P>

This report highlights some of the most interesting, innovative and effective activities of
the WHO regional Office for Europe in the past two years. The title summarizes WHOs
approach. Guided by the regional policy for health for all, with its primary goal of equity
in health, the Regional Office has developed new tactics and alliances to meet the needs
of the 50 diverse countries that comprise the WHO European Region.<P>
The report begins by sketching the health divide between the western and eastern halves
of the Region. Western countries continue to show improvements, while social, economic
and political transformation, sometimes accompanied by war, have revived old threats to
health and created new ones in the east. The remainder of the report describes WHOs
response to this situation, its development of methods and partnerships, and its notable
successes.<P>
Focusing on the countries in greatest need - the eastern half of the Region - the Regional
Office, with its partners, has tackled the resurgence of communicable diseases,
humanitarian assistance in the former Yugoslavia, high rates of maternal and infant death,
and the needs for integrated management of the environment and health, training in
nutrition, better training for nurses and health care system reform. Addressing issues
affecting the Region as a whole, the Regional Office has also done valuable work to
promote health through schools, to reduce smoking and drug abuse, to improve the
quality of health care and to help countries use the health for all approach to make health
policies of optimal effectiveness, efficiency and equity. Finally, the Regional Office has
fulfilled its role as an international centre of health information, providing the data
needed to guide its activities and those of governments and other organization interested
in health. Here its activities range from surveying health in the Region as a whole to work
on more specific topics, such as early warning of communicable diseases and making the
first-ever profiles of womens health.<P>
This report gives an insight into the work of the WHO Regional Office for Europe as it
faces the challenges of working for health in the new Europe.<P>

The First European Conference on Environment and Health in December 1989 brought
together ministers and other senior representatives from the environment and health
administrations of 29 European countries and from the Commission of the European
Communities. The Charter, which was adopted by the final session of the Conference,
represents a major step forward in the development of both public health and
environmental policies at a time when political change is greatly enhancing cooperation
among Member States throughout Europe. By adopting the Charter, the governments of
Europe have taken a united position on the basic principles, mechanisms and priorities for
further developing environmental health programmes.<P>
This book combines the Charter and the commentary, an explanatory text originally
provided as background for delegations to the Conference. Since this text was prepared, a
major development in the implementation of the Charter has taken place, in that an
agreement on the establishment of a European Centre for Environment and Health has
been signed with the governments of Italy and the Netherlands. It is already clear that
governments are making use of the Charter as a basis for practical action.<P>

People are increasingly concerned about the state of the environment and its effect on
their health and wellbeing. They know of examples, throughout the European Region, of
unacceptable levels of pollution, inadequate drinking-water and sewage facilities,
uncontrolled dumping of waste and occasionally major man-made disasters. But what is
the situation?<P>
Concern for Europes Tomorrow is a major Region-wide project, launched in 1991 to
find out. The report that resulted is the most comprehensive survey of environmental
health ever carried out in Europe. For the first time, information has been assembled from
almost all the 50 Member States of the Region. This summary sketches the picture that
has begun to emerge. First, it identifies the major diseases and conditions affecting the
European population that are linked in some way to environmental conditions. It goes on
to review the populations exposure to spec-ific environmental hazards. It then
summarizes the estimated exposure of the population and likely health effects, often
extrapolated from individual studies. Major gaps in data remain, but these show the
direction research must take. The main areas of concern are microbiological
contamination of food and drinking-water and urban air pollution. Over 100 million
people, largely in central and eastern parts of the Region, lack safe drinking-water, while
people everywhere suffer increasingly from illness caused by contaminated food. Hot
spots of urban air pollution persist in some industrial areas. The inexorable increase in
road traffic not only contributes to air pollution, but is a major cause of death and injury
among young people and through noise and congestion detracts considerably from the
quality of city life. Rapid urbanization in the south and inner city decay in the west, with
inadequate housing conditions and homelessness, exacerbate these urban problems.<P>
The implications of some transboundary issues, such as acid deposition and the pollution
of river basins, are of obvious concern. But if the people of the Region share a common
concern for Europes tomorrow they must also tackle the global problems of possible
climate change, resulting from the generation of green-house gases, and ozone depletion
by chlorofluorocarbons, now. The countries of the Region, from Greenland to the Pacific
coast of the Russian Federation, can and must work together to tackle these issues before
it is too late. This summary makes recommendations about how they can do so.<P>

The environment can have an important influence on health. The
European Environment Agency (EEA) and the WHO European Centre
for Environment and Health (ECEH) developed this publication as
a joint effort to draw attention to some environmental issues
that have a significant impact on the health of the people of
Europe. It represents the logical complement and continuation
of their cooperative work.

<P>
 Pooling the immense amounts of data that they have gathered,
EEA and ECEH have distilled the resulting knowledge into a brief
discussion of the contribution of environmental factors to the
main causes of death in Europe, and an examination of three particularly
significant issues. These issues meet important criteria. Each
is a widespread problem that causes significant damage to the
health of many people throughout Europe, and all are amenable
to coordinated action that would result in both improved environmental
quality and health benefits within a short time. Delaying this
action would increase the damage and make these problems harder
to solve in the future. This book not only identifies these issues
- air pollution with suspended particles, the microbiological
contamination of drinking-water and road traffic accidents - and
sketches the harm that they do, but lists goals and strategies
for action now.

<P>
 This book offers useful reading for everyone interested a healthy
environment, health protection and sustainable development. It
offers practical suggestions for action to make Europe a safer
and healthier place to live, for today's Europeans and tomorrow's.

<H2>Health interview surveys<br>

Towards international harmonization of methods and instruments</h2>

Monitoring health is an essential task of country systems for
health information and of measuring the European Region's progress
towards achieving health for all. The European policy for health
for all includes internationally agreed indicators for countries
to use. Health interview surveys provide the best -in some cases
the only - means to collect data on some of the indicators that
reflect more recent public health concerns, such as health-related
behaviour and quality of life. The surveys mirror the information
that only properly approached individuals may be able to provide
and ensure the coverage of all subgroups of the population. Yet
they enjoy a long tradition in only a few countries.<BR>

<P>
Moreover, information on indicators is sometimes not comparable.
The methods and instruments of data collection have often been
developed without international coordination, or adapted from
those in use in other countries, usually with substantial changes
to meet local requirements. In addition, countries lacking a tradition
of health interviewing are often uncertain about the best way
to conduct surveys. The WHO Regional Office for Europe and Statistics
Netherlands organized a series of meetings to tackle these problems.
The result was the internationally agreed methods and instruments
for health interview surveys that are set out in this book. These
are likely to become standards, and thus improve the comparability
of information.<BR>

<P>
The book provides practical guidance on health interview surveys.
It describes their role in health for all monitoring, the development
and use of methods and instruments, and the prospects for harmonizing
the surveys across the European Region. It is thus essential reading
for all concerned with planning and making such surveys, whether
in national statistics offices or in public or private interviewing
agencies. It will also be useful to the public health community,
including students and academics.<BR>

<P>
A collection of six state-of-the-art reviews summarizing current research on the
epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis and clinical pathology of the toxic oil syndrome.
Over 700 investigations, including numerous unpublished reports, were critically
assessed.<P>
The explosive outbreak of the toxic oil syndrome, which occurred in Spain a decade ago,
affected more than 20 000 people, claimed more than 800 lives, and left many thousands
more with permanent disability. Although contaminated rapeseed oil has been identified
as the vehicle of the causative agent, the agent itself has not yet been identified and the
mechanisms of pathogenicity remain unknown. Continuing research also responds to the
need to find effective treatment for surviving victims and to monitor carcinogenic and
other potential long-term effects on health.<P>
The first chapter reviews epidemiological findings from studies designed to determine the
causal agent, the factors that influenced individual susceptibility, and the long-term
evolution of disease manifestations. The second chapter presents the results of a
systematic 31-month follow-up of the clinical status of patients. Problems discussed
include the failure of all currently available treatments and the need to explain why
disability is progressive in some patients, while others gradually improve.<P>
Other chapters summarize what has been learned, from autopsy studies and surgical
specimens, about the pathology of the disease, present the results of various efforts to
replicate the disease in experimental models, and summarize available data on the
chemical composition of contaminated oils. The final chapter explores the involvement of
immunological mechanisms in the disease, drawing direction from the similarity of
symptoms to those seen in graft-versus-host disease and in hydantoin-induced
autoimmunity. In view of the many unresolved issues and gaps in understanding, the
book concludes with an outline of further research needed, supported by guidelines for
specific types of investigation.<P>

The second edition of a survey of laws and administrative procedures for the control of
food safety and the protection of consumers in each of 32 European countries. Organized
as a series of country reports, the book provides a picture of the ways in which the
countries of Europe try to protect their people from foodborne disease, to prevent the
adulteration of foods, and to ensure that food is safe and of the quality, purity and nature
expected by consumers.<P>
The main part of the book consists of surveys of food safety legislation and its
administrative enforcement for each of 32 countries. <P>
Each country report opens with brief information on the government, principal crops and
other food products, the importance of agriculture to the overall economy, and whether
the country is a net importer or exporter of food. The most extensive sections summarize
food control laws, explain measures of enforcement, and identify the responsible
governmental agencies. Details range from information on food inspection and analytical
practices to legislation covering the control of premises, hiring of food handlers,
labelling, advertising and marketing, and information to consumers as well as provisions
for the prosecution of offence.<P>

Volume 5 of the <I>Eighth report on the world health situation</I> is the European
Region's contribution to a seven-volume work that provides a detailed assessment, at
global, regional and country levels, of the extent to which strategies to develop health
systems based on primary health care are being successfully implemented. Emphasis is
placed on changes in the health situation in the European Region as measured through
data, covering the period 1985-1990, on several well defined indicators of health status
and progress on reaching the goal of health for all.<P>
The volume is in two parts. Part I is an overview in eight chapters of socioeconomic
developments, changes in the health system, and changes in health status as indicated by
statistics on morbidity and mortality. The main body of Part I follows the structure of the
regional targets for health for all, adopted by the Member States in 1984.<P>
Part II provides a detailed account of health conditions in selected individual Member
States, covering demography, health status (equity, health potential, mortality and
morbidity), lifestyles, health and the environment, and developments in the health service
system, and finishing with a summary of the country's progress towards health for all.
Those Member States that underwent rapid and extensive political and socioeconomic
change (with its consequent effect on the health services) between the collection of data
and the publication of the results are addressed in the opening section of Part II.<P>

In the late 1980s, Europe saw the beginnings of a process of change. Slowly at first and
then gathering pace, this process developed into the enormous political and social
changes now under way in central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. At
the same time, all European countries are faced with severe economic problems.<P>
It is against this backdrop that the results of the second large-scale evaluation of WHO's
health for all strategy in Europe must be seen. Undertaken in each country of the Region
in 1990-1991, the evaluation is possibly the last and most extensive overview of the
health of Europe on the brink of the new era.<P>
The evaluation shows that, on balance, health in the Region improved in the 1980s, with
increased life expectancy, progress on eliminating infectious diseases, and reduced
mortality from the leading causes of death. Development on other fronts, however, was
moderate to disappointing, with no real progress at all on the primary target for health for
all - equity. But there are real grounds for optimism in the fact that health policy
development has taken a big step forward. It is surely within the framework of national
policies based on health for all that the future health of all European peoples lies.<P>

In 1985 the Regional Office published <I>Targets for health for all</I>, setting out the
38 targets endorsed by the 33 European Member States of WHO in September 1984. This
was a breakthrough in European health development: for the first time, the Member
States had agreed to adopt a single health policy as a common basis for individual and
cooperative action. The new and revised targets incorporated in the present book reflect
changes that have taken place in the Region since 1984 and a more up-to-date
understanding of the problems involved in target setting and achievement. In addition, the
concern with ethics is a new theme reflected throughout the book.<P>
The book comprises eight chapters, five of which set out the targets themselves. In
chapter 3, targets 1-12 express in specific terms the improvements in health sought over
the 20 years between 1980 and the year 2000. Chapter 4 (targets 13-17) addresses the
health work that is essential to attain lifestyles conducive to health, while chapter 5
(targets 18-25) is concerned with the contribution that the environment makes to health,
and Chapter 6 (targets 26-31) with the provision of appropriate services for prevention,
treatment and care. In chapter 7, targets 32-38 provide the infrastructure for sustained
political, managerial and financial support to the strategies set out in chapters 4-6.<P>
Each target is presented together with the problems that need to be addressed and the
suggested means of solving those problems.<P>

The Europe of 1991, when this story finishes, is vastly different from the continent of 40
years ago when the WHO Regional Office for Europe began its work. The story began
with a Europe not only devastated by the Second World War but embarking on decades
of what was to be known as the "cold war" between east and west. Yet despite the
apparently irreconcilable ideological differences, and their expression in political and
military confrontation, the record of the Regional Office and its Member States of all
political persuasions is one of unqualified success.<P>
Professor Kaprio's book is intentionally far from exhaustive. It is a subjective account of
development in cooperation for health among the European Member States - both with
one another and with WHO. It will delight both those who have shared in the building of
that cooperation and those who are coming fresh to this historic episode.<P>

Everyone knows that the WHO European Region is undergoing profound, sometimes
violent, political, social and economic change, particularly in the central and eastern
countries and the former USSR. This book tracks the effects of these changes on health
and some of the ways in which countries are responding. <P>
Regular monitoring and evaluation are vital parts of the European strategy for health for
all. While the 1990/1991 evaluation took place just as the wave of change struck the
Region, the 1993/1994 monitoring exercise could measure its effects on health. This book
gives the results of the exercise, including a brief and easily understood summary.<P>
This book is essential reading for professionals, researchers and policy-makers in health
and related fields, and anyone interested in the tides of health in Europe.<P>

Social factors affect health. Social epidemiologists have shown not only the harmful
effects of stress and the helpful ones of social support but also the importance of the
wider physical and social environment. This raises two questions for health promotion
research. How can we better understand the social determinants of health and disease?
How can healthy public policy transform present knowledge into action? This book gives
some of the most recent, relevant and reliable answers to both.<P>

A wide-ranging analysis of the ways in which health promotion approaches can be used
to help the chronically ill and disabled exploit their potential to lead healthy and
productive lives. Citing a number of promising developments in recent years, the book
calls for a fundamental change in society's attitudes towards the chronically ill, whereby
emphasis is placed on their potential and due attention is given to their need for support
that goes beyond medical care. With this goal in mind, the book evaluates a wealth of
recent experiences and research findings in order to identify practical measures that can
be pursued by the health care sector, by public and private organizations, and by the
chronically ill and their families. Three main chronic conditions are considered: coronary
heart disease, cancer and chronic pain.<P>
The book features 54 papers authored by experts in cardiology, oncology, pain
management, rheumatology, psychology, physiology, rehabilitation medicine and
epidemiology, and by representatives of numerous self-help groups throughout Europe.
Papers are presented in twelve main parts. Papers in the first part set out a conceptual
framework for helping the chronically ill cope with the stress of illness and enhance their
health potential. The second part explores the importance of self-reliance, self-help and
self-determination in patients recovering from a heart attack. The needs of cancer patients
are covered in the third part, which considers the role that alternative therapies and
behavioural approaches can play in extending survival time and enhancing the quality of
life. The fourth part, on chronic pain, points to the need for a combined involvement of
social, psychological and medical knowledge in the management of chronic pain.<P>
Other chapters relate experiences in changing public health policies, in creating
supportive environments, in strengthening community action, and in developing the
personal coping skills of the chronically ill and disabled. Information ranges from advice
on how self-help groups can gain media support, through a discussion of the reasons why
the chronically ill seek alternative therapies, through descriptions of experiences with a
variety of new therapies for helping heart patients, cancer patients, families with a
handicapped child, and persons suffering from chronic pain, migraine and rheumatism.
The remaining chapters, concerned with the need to reorient health services, consider the
specific changes that need to be made in training, health research and health care. Over
500 references to the literature are included.<P>

Never before in peacetime has the convergence of political and economic change had
such a powerful impact on the health and wellbeing of the 850 million people of the
WHO European Region. Countries that have been insulated from such shifts now feel
their effects. People who have always had jobs are frustrated in unemployment and
bewildered about what action their governments should take. This multi-author
publication looks at how such a social change can affect people.<P>
First, it traces the development of theories on peoples response to unemployment. Then
it presents two recent studies on the effects of unemployment and income levels in
Finland and Sweden, describes the effects of economic changes in the United Kingdom
on people and their families, and compares the different cases of Finland and Hungary.
Ironically, men find the loss of their jobs doubly painful. While unemployed women often
have home responsibilities to keep them busy, men are left with nothing that supports
their self-esteem.<P>
Finally, two chapters look at the wider perspective of the interaction between the welfare
state and social change. Unemployment is but one of the several dimensions of social
change and is both cause and consequence. An extraordinarily complex range of
interacting variables emerges, in both countries and communities. Depending on which
end of the telescope one looks through, solutions vary. The negative effects of social and
economic pressure can be solved by long-term structural changes at the country level, or
by short-term relief adjustments at the individual level.<P>
The contributors to this book help us appreciate that these solutions must be
complementary rather than conflictual. They also help us understand the start political
reality that this is more easily said than done. But the book clearly describes the issues at
stake in the debate, and that is the crucial first step.<P>

The WHO Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) Study
is a collaborative cross-national research study, designed to
increase understanding of the health-related attitudes and behaviours
of young people. It has attracted a growing number of participating
countries. This particular report gives the results of the fourth
survey carried out since 1982, on schoolchildren in 24 countries
in the European Region and Canada. 

<P>
This publication will be essential reading for health policy-makers,
health educators and researchers in health promotion.
<p>

The survey looks at 11-, 13- and 15-year-old children's attitude
towards and experience of  a wide range of health-related behaviours
and lifestyle issues including: smoking, drinking, exercise, diet,
health and illness, injuries, and school and social life. While
children's use of tobacco and alcohol increases with age, they
exercise less as they grow older.  Many children's diets are unhealthy
and worsen with age.  Injuries from leisure activities are high,
particularly among those who play sports.  More positively, a
majority of students do not usually feel lonely, helpless and
out of things; they reported making friends easily, having at
least two close friends, and talking easily to their mother.
Girls find their teenage years more difficult than boys.  However,
girls like school more than boys do.  The school setting appears
to contribute to the perceptions students have about their health
and happiness: those who are satisfied with school tend to show
positive attitudes in several areas and reported less damaging
behaviours. 
<P>
The implications for health promotion policies and programmes
include: 
<UL>
<LI>legislation on the sale of tobacco and alcohol to young people
should be strengthened and more actively enforced;
<LI>health promotion programmes against tobacco and alcohol should
start early and be extended to all pupils;
<LI>school and leisure-related policy in areas such as sport and
exercise, nutrition and injuries should be further examined;
<LI>the working and living conditions offered by schools should
be improved;
<LI>health promotion initiatives should combine health-enhancing
behaviours and positive experiences for students and should simultaneously
address schools, families and leisure settings.
</UL>



These implications will be of great interest to health-policy
makers and health educators, while the continuing expansion of
the HBSC Study will give researchers valuable insight into how
to carry out a cross-national survey.  

<P>
The report includes appendices on the school system in each country,
the methodology used in the survey and the names of the principal
investigators.

A major problem in recent decades has been the rapid aging of the European population.
This trend seems likely to persist and may well become even more marked by the year
2000. Another cause for concern is the expected spectacular increase in those over 80
years of age. It is this group, the most vulnerable, that will require the greatest effort if the
health and quality of life of the population at large are to be improved. Health legislation
is not only one of the most effective means of improving the physical, mental and social
wellbeing of the elderly; it is probably the only way of translating policy into practice.
Yet there are serious disparities and shortcomings in the legislation of the European
countries, not to mention huge inequalities in the budgets allocated to services for the
elderly. This book offers a fresh view of the contribution legislation can make to solving
these problems, identifying the areas where, although currently absent or inadequate in
many European countries, legislation might be particularly useful. The book will
therefore be of interest to all concerned with these problems and in particular to lawyers,
politicians and legislators.<P>

The disabled have the same rights as everyone else, but are they always encouraged and
enabled to exercise them? This survey of 25 European countries explores the laws
affecting the disabled and how they are implemented. The countries take two main
approaches to equality for the disabled: while some feel it is less discriminatory to
incorporate disability issues in a number of different existing laws, others prefer to adopt
a single law specific to the disabled. The book shows that the emphasis is now on self-
help and independence, rather than on disability pensions and homes for the disabled.
This is due not only to changing social attitudes, but also to the increased emphasis on
incentives for employers to employ disabled people, grants for the disabled to adapt their
homes, and a switch of funds from institutional establishments to community support
services. Disabled people are increasingly able to earn their own living, travel about, live
independently and take part in social and sporting events.<P>
This is a heartening review of the conditions disabled people now live under in the
European Region, as we near the end of the International Decade of Disabled Persons. It
should be read with interest by the disabled themselves, by all those involved in their
affairs, and by anyone concerned about the way society treats its minority groups.<P>

<H2>Care of children in hospital</H2>
By E. Stenbak<br>
1986, 68 pages [E]<br>
ISBN 92 890 1033 9<br>
Sw.fr. 12.-<br>
Order No. 1340027<P>
A report on the care of children in European hospitals with emphasis on the provision of adequate nursing
services. The book opens with a review of research useful in defining the special needs of hospitalized
children. On the basis of what has been learned from over three decades of research, the book then outlines
hospital requirements in terms of the organizational features, facilities, staff qualifications and support
services necessary to minimize the adverse effects known to be associated with prolonged
hospitalization.<P>
The main part of the book presents and analyses the findings from a study of conditions in 24 inpatient
hospitals in nine European countries. Factors considered include characteristics of the hospital unit,
preparation of the child before admission, policies encouraging or discouraging parental involvement,
visiting hours, and the availability of play facilities and safety measures. Also considered are differences in
the professional training and experience of nurses, in the ratio of patients to nurses, and in the extent to
which children are prepared for medical procedures such as blood tests, X-rays, anaesthesia and injections.
Noting the alarming inadequacy of care in many hospitals, the report concludes with a set of 17
recommendations designed to bring hospital care more into line with what is known about the emotional
needs of children.<P>
<I>"... The variations within a country are as interesting as variations between countries ... even one child
suffering from the conditions described in some countries should be a cause of concern to us all..." -

A practical handbook covering both the principles and the specifics of drug therapy in children. Prepared by
a group of five specialists in paediatric pharmacology, the book offers clear advice on a range of drugs,
diseases and prescribing situations likely to be encountered outside the hospital setting. Both prescription
and over-the-counter medications are considered.<P>
The book has two main parts. The first provides a thorough introduction to the principles and therapeutic
approaches that define good prescribing practice in children.  The second and most extensive part provides
precise prescribing information for some 40 groups of drugs commonly used to treat childhood disorders
and diseases.  For each drug group, readers are given information on indications for use, guidelines for
prescribing, and the comparative advantages and disadvantages of specific preparations, including
recommended doses and routes of administration. Emphasis is placed on rational prescribing practice
supported by clear evidence of drug efficacy and safety. In view of the dangers of overprescribing in this
age group, the book also specifies cases where non-drug therapy is equally, if not more, effective.<P>

An unprecedented 33-country analysis of the medical and support services available to, and utilized by,
European women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period. Prepared by experts from several
disciplines, including psychology, the report describes and interprets the results of surveys, interviews,
meetings and consultations held over a five-year period.<P>
Chapters describe the official services, alternative services, and information and evaluation services that
surround pregnancy and birth care in Europe.  The study also serves to pinpoint areas where scientific
knowledge is inadequate, where costly procedures are being increasingly performed despite lack of a
scientific rationale, and where painful interventions of no proven value are nonetheless used on a routine
basis.  The final chapter draws a number of important conclusions about the quality of services for women
and their babies in European countries.<P>

embryology, microbiology and epidemiology, the book features 13 state-of-the-art reviews covering
morphology, etiology, epidemiology, conventional and newer techniques for laboratory diagnosis, the cost-
effectiveness of routine screening, and the extent to which these infections account for congenital
malformations, including mental retardation. Information on viral and bacterial infections is complemented
by sections devoted to chlamydiae, toxoplasmosis and urinary tract infections.  The book also alerts
clinicians, epidemiologists and laboratory workers to the pitfalls of recently developed diagnostic
techniques, particularly those associated with immunoassays available as commercial kits.<P>

<H2>Assessing hypertension control and

<H3>Hypertension Management Audit Project: a
WHO/WHL Study.</H3>

Hypertension affects up to 30% of people in certain European populations, and seriously
jeopardizes their health. If properly managed, hypertension can be reduced and its effects
minimized, but the question is how often this is achieved in practice. This publication
reports on the results of the WHO Hypertension Management Audit Project carried out to
assess the levels and quality of the management of hypertension in selected European
countries. <P>
Centres in Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Romania, Spain, Switzerland and the former
Yugoslavia took part in the Project, by carrying out one or more of five kinds of survey.
The community survey identified the proportion of undiagnosed and untreated, as well as
overdiagnosed and unnecessarily treated, hypertensives in a sample population. The
patient survey then reviewed the treatment history of patients confirmed as hypertensives.
The consumer inquiry treated patients as consumers and examined their views about the
treatment they had received. The physician inquiry assessed the knowledge and attitudes
of physicians involved in the treatment of hypertension. This contrasted interestingly with
the actual treatment identified in the patient survey. Finally, the drug utilization study
assessed the volume and type of drug prescriptions in relation to the hypertensive
population. <P>
The results show that the level of detection has improved over the last two decades, but
technological diagnostic tests are still preferred to simpler but more relevant behavioural
questions. Treatment is still not as effective as it could be. While most physicians
understand the correct techniques for the management of hypertension, far fewer carry
them out in practice. Thus the greatest potential for improvement in the care of
hypertensive patients lies in the psychological sphere. A better understanding is needed of
why patients, as consumers, are or are not happy and comply with treatment, and of why
physicians, as providers, do or do not give treatment in line with their stated beliefs.<P>
This is a most valuable survey of how the known techniques for managing hypertension
are being carried out. Although it spans countries from all corners of Europe, it shows
remarkable similarities despite cultural and health care differences.<P>

A policy statement intended to focus attention on the crucial need for palliative care in
cancer patients. Information is specific to cancer problems and methods of management
prevailing in Europe. Addressed to health authorities and the medical and nursing
professions, the report issues guidance on what needs to be done to ensure that patients
with advanced cancer benefit from available methods for the management of pain and
other symptoms. Emphasis is placed on the changes in thinking, services and resources
needed to help cancer patients achieve their maximum physical, emotional, spiritual,
vocational and social potential. Details range from a list of common symptoms and
sources of discomfort in patients, through 14 essential elements of good symptom control,
to advice on the organization of health services for care of the dying in a hospital, in the
community, and in hospices and palliative care units. <P>

<H3>The implications for health of nuclear power

With the rising cost of fossil fuels and a growing concern with pollution, public resistance
to nuclear power was beginning to weaken. The accident at Chernobyl in 1986 reversed
that trend. Nuclear power production is, in principle, a safe technology but management
failures have caused accidents. Objective assessments are urgently needed of the relative
risks of different energy options, particularly the nuclear option.<P>
This book updates and consolidates two decades of work by the WHO Regional Office
for Europe on the impact on health of nuclear energy production into one volume. It
details the nuclear fuel cycle, describes the effects of radiation on health in both normal
and accident conditions, compares alternative sources of electrical energy, discusses the
danger of malevolent use of nuclear materials, and gives guidance on how to keep the
public informed.<P>
This book is vital reading for anyone in a national or international position who is directly
or indirectly concerned with the public health aspects of nuclear power production,
including engineers, technicians and physicians.<P>

<H2>Nursing in action</H2>
<H3>Strengthening nursing and midwifery to support
health for all</H3>

Edited by Jane Salvage<BR>
WHO Regional Publications,<BR>
European Series, No. 48<BR>
1993, 123 pages [E, F*, R*]<BR>

The profound changes now taking place in Europe's health care raise key questions for
nurses and midwives. The issue is not whether they should change their practice, but how
they will change it - and what role they will play in meeting the health needs of the
future.<P>
Nurses are already debating these questions, and have chosen WHO's strategy for health
for all as their guiding star. In every Member State of the European Region, a movement
has started to create a new kind of nurse: an autonomous, skilled practitioner whose role
is not to serve other professionals but to inform, support and care for the patient and the
community.<P>
Creating this role, and ensuring it has the necessary support, are formidable tasks. How
can they be tackled? This book provides the starting point. It combines vision and action
in chapters on:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Defining the nurse's role and functions
<LI>Changing nursing practice
<LI>Developing regulatory systems
<LI>Reforming nursing education
<LI>Preparing leaders.
</UL>

Nursing in action is a book for all nurses, midwives and health personnel doing nursing
work. It also provides food for thought to policy-makers, health service managers, health
professionals and consumers working towards health for all. It provides an overview of
WHO nursing policies and guidelines which is relevant to nurses everywhere, and is an
excellent introductory text for those in the forefront of nursing development.<P>

Nutrition policies are a relatively new phenomenon in Europe. They require health
promotion to be made an important consideration in all food-policy decisions. Nutrition
policy-makers try to establish what sort of diet a population should be eating in order to
become and remain healthy. To do this, they need to know not only what the population
ought to be eating, but also what they are actually eating. Food balance sheets, household
budget surveys and individual-level studies all provide data on the dietary patterns of
populations. <P>
This book makes a critical assessment of these data sources, examining what each can
(and cannot) tell us and how they should be used. It will be a vital guide to all those who
could and should contribute to people's nutritional wellbeing: food producers and
manufacturers, officials in ministries of agriculture, industry, trade and health, and
individuals in positions that entail decision-making on food such as caterers, hospital
administrators, and food importers and retailers.

A stimulating discussion of ways in which European governments might adjust food
policies to incorporate health objectives in line with the overwhelming evidence linking
dietary factors to disease. Authored by experts in medical nutrition, the book serves as
both a rich source of data on European eating patterns and a persuasive call for actions
that can help Europeans select foods conducive to good health. Concrete policy
recommendations are presented with a full awareness of the difficulties involved in
altering traditional food choices, changing agricultural policies, and improving
manufacturing practices within the food industry.<P>
The most extensive chapter evaluates what is known about the relationship of dietary
patterns in different European countries to the prevalence of coronary heart disease,
cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer, cirrhosis of the liver, bone disease in
the elderly, oral disease, nutritional anaemia and goitre. Findings from this evaluation are
then used to examine ways in which nutrition-based food policies can facilitate

improve knowledge of the health hazards associated with different occupations or risks at
the workplace. The objective is to point out any special problems that must be considered
when applying established epidemiological methods to the field of occupational health.
Specific applications covered in the book include the identification of occupational health
risks, the evaluation of long-term effects, the selection of reliable sources of data, and the
use of screening in the assessment of risks. Other chapters discuss methods and
procedures in descriptive epidemiology, cross-sectional studies, cohort studies, case-

Occupational health services began in Europe over 100 years ago. They were a response
to needs created by industrialization, and have developed in accordance with the legal,
political and social conditions and traditions in each country. This book is the result of a
groundbreaking study of these services throughout the European Region. Based on
countries' own descriptions of their services and on information from international
agencies and experts, this publication puts occupational health services in an international
perspective. It summarizes the principles and functions of occupational health services,
and reviews the services available in the 32 Member States of the Region. This overview
is the first of its kind. It provides valuable and interesting reading for people in any of the
sectors or disciplines involved in choosing, planning and delivering occupational health
services - an important part of work for health for all.<P>

A multi-authored survey of instruments and methods developed to investigate patterns of
drug consumption and to answer fundamental questions about prescribing practices,
therapeutic value, and safety. By reviewing the state-of-the-art in research methodology,
the book also aims to show how drug utilization studies can contribute to national health
policies designed to promote the availability of safe and effective medicines, while also
reducing costly over-medication. Information ranges from a list of studies for assessing
the impact of regulatory policies, through a review of methods for monitoring adverse
drug reactions, to a discussion of the reasons why a large proportion of currently
marketed drugs have not been systematically evaluated for either efficacy or safety.
Throughout, emphasis is placed on the methods needed to perform reliable studies in a
standardized way.<P>
The book features 12 papers authored by experts in clinical pharmacology, drug policy,
drug control and consumer affairs. The opening papers discuss the relevance of
randomized clinical trials to prescribing practice, and explain how drug utilization studies
can support the concepts of therapeutic formularies and essential drugs. A paper devoted
to descriptive tools and analysis describes different classification systems and units for
the quantification of drug use and explains the defined daily dose (DDD) system. Other
papers explore the application of drug utilization studies to assess drug risks, identify
factors that influence drug use and patient compliance, and evaluate drug costs and
expenditure. Another group of papers considers drug utilization from the perspectives of
health authorities, health professionals and consumer organizations. The concluding
papers outline elements of a teaching strategy on the rational use of drugs and discuss the
extent to which research findings can be transferred from industrialized to developing
countries.

An expert, multi-author review of hazards to health in medical patients, occupational
groups and the general public, posed by the growing number of processes and devices that
utilize or emit nonionizing radiation in industry, engineering, telecommunications,
medicine, research, and the home. Now in its second edition, the book has been updated
and extensively expanded, particularly in light of new data on radio-frequency radiation
and electric and magnetic fields. Close to 1000 references to the literature are
included.<P>
The book has six main chapters covering ultraviolet radiation, optical radiation and lasers,
infrared radiation, radiofrequency radiation, electric and magnetic fields at extremely low
frequencies, and ultrasound. Each chapter provides a thorough critical analysis of all
available data on properties, uses, pathological effects, and hazards associated with
overexposure. Details range from the consequences of a decreased thickness of the ozone
layer to data on the use of extremely low frequency fields to heal bone fractures.<P>
Chapters, which were finalized after consultation with more than 300 experts, also
attempt to establish appropriate exposure limits, based on a biological risk-benefit
analysis, and issue advice concerning exposure levels, standards and measures needed for
protection, whether involving guidelines for therapeutic use in medicine or the types of
safety equipment required for workers. The concluding chapter, which notes the need for
regulation, offers advice on safety standards and procedures for regulation and
enforcement.<P>

<H2>Drug abusers in prisons: managing their

ISBN 92 890 1118 1<BR>
Sw.fr. 10.-<BR>
Order No. 1310027<P>

The proportion of drug abusers in prisons has grown enormously in recent decades. This
has put a great strain on the health services available to prisoners, which is exacerbated by
the recent steep rise in the rate of infection of drug abusers with HIV. This book looks at
the methods used to identify drug abusers on admission to prison and measures used to
treat drug dependence. It looks closely at the special nature of drug treatment in prison:
both the ethics of treating people who are incarcerated against their will and the likely
effect of their lack of motivation on the outcome. It also looks at health problems related
to drug abuse, such as AIDS and suicide.<P>
This in-depth review should be read by those in the public health and criminal justice
sectors who are responsible for the health and welfare of the prison population, as well as
by researchers concerned with methods of treating drug dependence.<P>

<a name="tobacco"><H2>It can be done</H2></A>

<H3>A smoke-free Europe</H3>

WHO Regional Publications,<BR>

1990, 67 pages [E]<BR>
ISBN 92 890 1121 1<BR>
Sw.fr. 18.-<BR>
Order No. 1310030<P>

"To all the thinking people concerned with the saving and not the destruction of human
life, the message from the First European Conference on Tobacco Policy is clear. Target
number one is a smoke-free Europe. It can be done." This book summarizes the tough
lines of action mapped out during Europe's first conference on tobacco policy, a
watershed in the history of action against tobacco. <P>
The conference, which united some of the most experienced scientists, social scientists,
and experts on health education and public health policy in Europe, drew unprecedented
force and determination from a number of developments in research and public opinion,
including data showing the increased risk of lung cancer and other severe diseases in non-
smokers exposed to tobacco smoke, the growing view that tobacco-polluted air is a matter
of grave environmental concern, and the increasing unwillingness to swallow the
industry's argument for corporate freedom at the expense of so many lives. <P>
The book opens with a six-point charter asserting the moral rights of Europe's citizens to
be protected not only from the diseases tobacco causes but also from the severe hazards
of breathing air polluted by tobacco smoke. To make it possible for every person in
Europe to enjoy the rights stipulated in the charter, the book sets out ten precise strategies
for a smoke-free Europe, further concluding that a tobacco control policy that
encompassed these ten strategies could bring about a significant reduction of tobacco
consumption in Europe and could eventually eliminate the diseases caused by
tobacco.<P>
The book is itself heavily and pointedly illustrated. The pictures of coffins and of model
ads showing an amputated leg or the cancer surgeon at work contrast sharply with a series
of cartoons depicting the cigarette, with its watering can of poison, under the increasingly
well-armed attack of a stormy climate of opinion, a surgeon's scalpel, the muscle of
fitness, stethoscopes, a gavel, and the ball-and-chain of a tax increase. These illustrations
work to enforce the report's conclusion that a popular movement to rid Europe of
tobacco-related disease will be irresistible. It can be done, and this book shows how.<P>

<H2>Management of drinking problems</H2>

By Peter Anderson<BR>

Order No. 1310032<P>

In many parts of Europe alcohol consumption has risen considerably over the past 25-30
years, and this has been matched by a huge increase in alcohol-related problems. Many
European countries see this as a major public health problem second only to cigarette
smoking. The approach of WHO to this question is to emphasize the importance of a
response embedded in the community and the need for early recognition, rather than
specialist treatment. WHO has also suggested ways of using reporting systems or other
strategies for small-scale monitoring, implying that early recognition is possible and that
nipping the problem in the bud will prevent further damage. The logic and economic
practicality of primary-level intervention are undisputed, but more work is urgently
needed to translate the rhetoric into workable, everyday activities. This book sets out to
examine the issues in detail. It is based on the reports of three working groups convened
by WHO. The first group considered treatment and rehabilitation programmes for alcohol
abuse, the second examined the respective roles of the primary care and specialized
services, and the third reported on the implementation and evaluation of programmes for
problem drinkers. The book concludes with a list of over 350 references.<P>
<HR>
<h2>Publication Series of the European Alcohol
Action Plan</h2>

In the WHO European Region, alcohol production and trade are big business, and
harmful drinking has high costs to health and society. Because many of the problems
related to alcohol use can be prevented, the WHO European Alcohol Action Plan
promotes comprehensive policies to reduce harmful consumption in all countries of the
Region. WHO is producing a series of nine publications to support the Action Plan and
the making and implementation of policies in countries.<P>
<P>
The nine booklets address many of the issues involved in policy-making and action to
reduce harmful drinking and its consequences for drinkers, their families and society.
They cover a range of topics, including:<P>
<UL>
<LI>approaches to policy and their economic aspects
<LI>taking and evaluating action on alcohol at different levels
<LI>treatment approaches
<LI>special groups and settings, such as young people, the mass media and the workplace.
</UL>
Each booklet discusses both problems and opportunities for action in the subject area.<P>
The series offers useful and interesting reading for anyone concerned with health
promotion, substance use and particularly responses to the harm caused by alcohol use. It
will make an important contribution to the success of the European Alcohol Action Plan
and thus to progress towards health for all.<P>

<H2>Site selection for new hazardous waste

1993, xiv + 118 pages [E]<BR>
ISBN 92 890 1309 5<BR>

Order No. 1310046<P>

A comprehensive guide to the selection of new sites where hazardous wastes can
be collected, treated, stored and disposed of in a safe manner acceptable to the general
public. Apart from outlining relevant engineering and scientific factors, the book gives
particular attention to the measures needed to protect health, preserve environmental
quality, and respect the social values and economic wellbeing of the host community.
Though intended for use in European countries, the policy and technical options
described are applicable to situations in most countries throughout the world.<p>
The guide has five chapters. The first outlines general principles that should guide
site selection and explains the main phases in the planning and siting process. The second
chapter discusses the many complex issues that determine the need for facilities,
including technologies that can reduce emissions at the source, and offers advice on the
acquisition of data for planning purposes. The third and most extensive chapter, focused
on procedural and technical considerations, presents and explains two general
frameworks for site selection: a voluntary model, which anticipates that one or more
communities will want or accept a new facility, and a technical model. Other topics
discussed include the distribution of responsibilities in facility development, the use of
screening and exclusionary criteria, and the procedures for site evaluation.
<p>The assessment of risks to health and the environment is addressed in the fourth
chapter, which lists important site-related parameters for predicting the distribution of
pollutants in groundwater, surface water, land and air. The final chapter reviews social
and economic considerations, offering practical advice on attitudes that help explain
public opposition, common errors in dealing with the public that can defeat technically
worthwhile projects, and negotiating strategies that can help resolve opposition to
technically valid proposals. Recommended lines of action draw upon experiences around
the world in the successful siting of new facilities.

<P>
Profound and rapid changes are under way in the countries of central and eastern Europe
(CCEE) and the newly independent states (NIS) of the former USSR. These changes have
led to social and economic hardship and, in some cases, to war. The result is a widening
gap in health between the eastern and western halves of the WHO European Region: a
serious inequity. A closer look at the CCEE and NIS reveals a particularly disadvantaged
group in these countries: women. While women bear more of the burdens imposed by
change, they also comprise an invaluable, largely untapped resource for the response to
change.<P>
Recognizing both the problem and the opportunity, the WHO Regional Office for Europe
created the Investing in Womens Health Initiative. Its goal is to provide governments in
the CCEE and NIS with information and policy options, through a European Womens
Health Forum. Governments can then use these tools to address womens needs
throughout life, and make use of womens strengths in this difficult period of
transition.<P>
This book is one of the first fruits of the initiative. Coordinators from 11 pilot countries
and 1 pilot city in the eastern half of the Region gathered data for the first-ever country
profiles on womens health and the factors that influence it. This book makes a
comparative analysis of the profiles. It describes not only health status and health care
services but also womens position in society and the influences of daily life and the
environment on their health. It concludes by indicating the directions for future action
which should include improving the amount and quality of the data on women.<P>
This book makes gripping and vital reading for anyone interested in womens health,
health in the CCEE and NIS, equity, healthy public policy, or the opportunities for
beneficial change in the eastern countries of the European Region.<P>

The latest in a succession of practical guides for action to control tobacco. The heart of
this book is its case studies - descriptions of actions that have been taken to achieve
different policy objectives. Section one outlines the key elements of a tobacco control
programme and describes how a group of British doctors responded to the tobacco
problem. Section two offers case studies drawn from experiences in Europe, North
America and Australia. Among the stories told are how a tobacco company tried to
suppress a booklet about tobacco promotion for Swedish children, a description of the
Australian MOP UP and BUGA up campaigns, and how the 1988 Calgary Winter
Olympics became the smoke-free Olympics. The last section lists key individuals,

The prevalence of allergic disorders appears to be rising in many countries, particularly
among children. These allergies include dermatitis, hay fever, asthma, reactions to insect
stings and to drugs and food additives. Many are caused by synthetic chemicals, to which
more and more people are exposed. <P>
This book, commissioned by WHO and written by a group of international experts, brings
together the latest knowledge in this field. It looks at how allergic sensitization of the skin
and the respiratory tract is triggered and by which chemicals, and what diagnostic and
predictive tests can be used to prevent or treat it. It makes recommendations about the
priority actions that scientists and public health officials can take to improve knowledge
of allergens and their mechanisms among both the public and the health professions.
Health professionals such as physicians, nurses, health managers, immunologists and
toxicologists will find it invaluable in their work with allergies, allergens and allergy
sufferers.  <P>

This publication is a unique resource identifying priorities for public health research in selected areas of environmental epidemiology. It is a compilation of the specialized knowledge and opinions of environmental epidemiology experts, brought together at a workshop
organized by the Rome division of the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health.  The chapters cover the topic from three different viewpoints: environmental exposures, major disease groups related to the environment and epidemiological methodology.  To prioritize, the authors used a set of criteria based on exposure conditions, health effects and the feasibility of human studies. This publication provides essential guidance for research emphasis and the allocation of financial and technical resources.

In Europe, nonfatal suicidal behaviour has been identified as a major public health
problem and a considerable drain on resources. Unfortunately, due to cross-cultural
differences both in medical treatment of nonfatal suicidal behaviour and in research
methodology, it is almost impossible to make valid comparisons between countries. The
collaborative multicentre study that forms the basis for this book helps to provide an
epidemiological picture of attempted suicide in Europe.<P>
This book presents the results of the first phase of the study, which were released at the
Conference on Attempted Suicide in Europe held in the Netherlands in 1993. It also
includes the invited lectures given at the conference.<P>
The monitoring of recent trends in the epidemiology of attempted suicide presented here
will enable the identification of sociodemographic risk factors. Hopefully, this book will
encourage the establishment of effective services for preventing and treating this
behaviour.<P>

The health impact of economic development projects and policy is often a secondary
consequence of other environmental effects. The worldwide development of
environmental impact assessment procedures has provided a way to include and assess
the health impacts of the same development projects. This book introduces the twin
concepts of environmental impact assessment and health impact assessment, and the
related concept of risk assessment and management, describes the development of
modern toxicology as a multidisciplinary science, explores the uses of data bases and
information sources, and identifies future research needs in the field. It then provides
various case studies as examples. It will be useful to all professionals involved in
planning or implementing development projects. It will be particularly relevant to those
who have had little experience in integrating human health considerations into such
projects. It will be of special value in addressing the needs of the countries of central and
eastern Europe.

Biological markers can improve the assessment of exposure to environmental factors.
This special issue reviews the available biomarker-based methods of exposure assessment
to carcinogens and non-carcinogens, in terms of their validity, their applicability to
exposure assessment and/or risk evaluation and the feasibility of their application in
population studies. Written by both toxicologists and epidemiologists, the articles take an
integrative approach to identify the needs for the further development of such methods, to
define criteria for the validation of biological markers for use in population studies, and
to draw up guiding principles for their application.

Health for all cannot be achieved if health personnel do not have the appropriate
education to carry it out. This publication reports on the highlights of an international
consultation held to define an educational policy for all European health professionals
who wish to become an active force in pursuing the targets of health for all. The basic
elements of this policy are identified as: training in teamwork, multiprofessional and
interdisciplinary cooperation, continuing education, a problem-solving approach and
community involvement in health problems. Health personnel will also have to shift from
its present, essentially disease-oriented attitude to a health-promotive, disease-preventive
attitude. While applying in particular to all categories of health worker, this report is
addressed to everyone involved, directly or indirectly, in health care systems and hence
the strategy of health for all.

Throughout the European Region, health care systems are becoming increasingly
concerned with cost containment and the efficient use of resources. This has led them all,
despite their manifest differences, to take a renewed interest in market principles as a
possible solution. A WHO working group met to review the situation in Germany,
Hungary, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, the former USSR and the
United Kingdom - all countries that are either undergoing system-wide reform or
exploring new arrangements for health care organization and management. The
participants, all centrally involved in the health service reforms in their countries, gave an
insight into and assessment of the likely effect of the reforms and the implications they
would have for health care. This book contains a summary of the meeting, the country
reports and a review of past trends in health care and the new directions their
management should take. It is vital reading for all involved in or concerned about the
evolution of health care systems in the Region.

The public is increasingly anxious about environmental pollution and its potential effects
on health. But traditional epidemiological techniques are ill-suited to detect purely local
effects, such as near certain industrial or nuclear power plants, of the kind that alarm the
public the most. An important new approach to this problem is the use of small-area
studies, in which health and environmental exposure data are analysed with much finer
geographical resolution than ever before. This book is the first to summarize the new
developments in data availability, methodology, and the execution of small-area health
studies. It introduces geographical and small-area studies, summarizes the data
requirements for such studies, reviews the statistical methodology and identifies areas for
future work in geographical correlation studies and other concerns, gives a historical
perspective of environmental epidemiology and guidelines for investigating and
interpreting disease clusters, and provides some examples of small-area and geographical
correlation studies. This book should be of interest to practising epidemiologists,
geographers, environmentalists, statisticians, toxicologists and public health physicians
concerned with the impact of environmental exposure on the health of the population. It
should also be read by students of various disciplines associated with environmental
epidemiology and environmental science, as well as by health-policy makers, health
economists, politicians in the fields of environment and health, and informed lay
people.

Sets education and individual action - still important components of health promotion

intervention. As this book points out, this approach has exciting implications for research,
which must now encompass all aspects of the structures and institutions of society. While
the volume rightly discusses definitions and terminology, it lays more emphasis on

<H2>Alcohol policy and the public good</H2>
<P>
By Griffith Edwards et al.<P>

1994, 226 pages<BR>
ISBN 0 19 262561 Pbk <BR>
ISBN 0 19 262562 Hbk<BR>

Alcohol contributes to multiple and costly problems, affecting individual and family
health, welfare, employment and crime. Too often this cost and suffering have been
viewed as intractable. <P>
The authors boldly argue that such pessimism is unjustified, and that there is ample
evidence on which to identify a rational basis for effective public health policies in this
arena. Critical analysis is directed at a wide rage of policy choices including pricing,
ecological measures, public education, primary care and action on drunk driving.
Drinking problems, the authors conclude, are not carried by an uncontrollable
tide.

What is the correct dosage of iodine for protecting people, especially pregnant women
and the fetus, following a nuclear accident? This volume authoritatively answers that
question. It presents the papers that formed the basis for the development of guidelines on
iodine prophylaxis issued by the WHO Regional Office for Europe. Papers cover the
normal function of the thyroid and the responses to iodine, the theoretical basis for stable
iodine prophylaxis, risks and benefits of stable iodine prophylaxis, and the indications for
the use of stable iodine. <P>

<H3>WHO Healthy Cities project</H3>
<H4>A project becomes a movement</H4>
Edited by Agis D. Tsouros<P>

1990, 80 pages<BR>
ISBN 88 85393 01 2<BR>
US $15.-<P>

Evaluates the progress made in just four years, from 1987 to 1990, by the Healthy Cities
project, an innovative approach to promoting health and improving the urban
environment. With its network of 30 cities, the project now touches more than 18 million
people in 18 European countries.<P>
After sketching out the characteristics of a healthy city, the book outlines the underlying
strategy of the Healthy Cities project and the major events that helped convert its ideas
into action. A review of progress made in the cities focuses on the factors that influence
development, such as city size and economic differences, and the keystones for success,
such as effective committees, strong community support, sound project administration
and managerial and political accountability. The book then describes the action taken
locally by cities in a wide range of areas, such as helping the disadvantaged, greening the
city, involving children in community life and raising consumer awareness of
nutrition.<P>

<H3>Healthy housing: a practical guide</H3>
By Ray Ranson<P>

1991, 292 pages<BR>
ISBN 0 419 15400 0<BR>
 18.99 sterling<P>

The objective of this guide is to encourage administrations to formulate a sound housing
policy to solve basic health-related housing problems and to meet WHO's objective of
healthy housing for all. Many technical, social, planning and policy factors relating to
housing may affect people's physical and mental health and social wellbeing. These
factors can be expressed in terms of basic human requirements which can, accordingly, be
incorporated into housing standards, policies and goals of attainment relevant to an
individual country's needs, resources and priorities. No universal interpretation of healthy
housing is possible, but this guide outlines the typical requirements that can form the
necessary basis.<P>

1991, 54 pages<BR>
ISBN 3 540 54646 4<P>

Twelve European countries, Canada and Israel participate in the CINDI programme. This
book describes the baseline situation in these countries before the start of the programme.
Trends in premature mortality from some major noncommunicable diseases are given, as
well as the prevalence of risk factors for these diseases in the population (such as high
blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, overweight and smoking). The results stress the
necessity of a countrywide integrated approach:  noncommunicable diseases account for
two thirds of premature deaths in the CINDI countries, and about 70% of the adult
population is at risk. This report follows on from the CINDI Protocol and guidelines and
should enable the CINDI countries to assess the value of the approaches and interventions
recommended in them.

<H5>The problem of cost containment</H5>

By F.M. Haaijer-Ruskamp and M.N.G. Dukes<P>

Sixth edition<BR>
1991, 70 pages<BR>
ISBN 90 72371 21 6<BR>
Dfl. 32.80<P>

With the rising cost of medical care coupled with a slowdown in the growth of the
western economy, the money spent on prescribed drugs has become a matter of violent
controversy. The need for economy in health care is clear; what is contested however is
the extent to which it is wise to attempt to save expenditure on drugs, rather than on other
services. If the flow of money is reduced, will this put patient care at risk? Will the
research effort or the return on investment in the pharmaceutical industry be endangered?
Other questions concern the way in which money can be saved:  how can wastage be
reduced, how can prescribers be encouraged to use medicines more critically, and how is
one to determine what constitutes a fair price for a research-based drug?<P>
Answers to such questions as these too often come only from those whose interests are at
stake; because those interests differ, so do the answers which are given ... and the
controversy continues.<P>
Since 1984, a team set up by the WHO Regional Office for Europe and its collaborating
centre at the University of Groningen has provided regular studies of these vexed matters,
designed to provide policy-makers, industry and all those involved in patient care with
concrete and documented evidence on where the truth lies. Much of the truth that emerges
is distilled from the many attempts that have been made in various countries to control
pharmaceutical expenditure - sometimes successfully, yet more often to no effect and
sometimes doing more harm than good. With the present sixth edition, Drugs and money
again provides a compact and updated guide to these vital issues.<P>

<H3>Use and regulation of vitamin and mineral

1993, 102 pages<BR>
ISBN 90 72371 59 3<P>

Vitamins and minerals are an important part of the diet of anyone keen to maintain their
health. Most countries recommend similar daily intake levels of these substances. Yet the
sales of such products to supplement the diet varies widely from country to country and
many people regularly ingest vastly more vitamins than they need. This book is an
attempt to identify the extent of overconsumption, and to help health personnel and the
public learn when and how vitamins and minerals should be used correctly. It reviews
existing policies towards minerals and vitamins, identifies the background data on such
micronutrients and their supply in the diet, examines the current patterns of their use as
supplements to the diet, discusses the possible indications for supplements in specific
population subgroups, describes the preparation and content of the various products on
the market, and makes recommendations for policy, use, regulation and surveillance. This
review should be read by policy-makers, regulatory bodies and the health professions.<P>

A major part of the programme of WHO's European Regional Office is directed towards
lifestyles conducive to health and the development of a healthy environment. Given the
broadness of the issue of health promotion and its potential for conflict, it is important to
continue discussing and analysing its philosophical base. This is one philosopher's

In the past, the Swedish model has often been seen or referred to as a paragon for health
care systems in welfare states. Lately, however, the Swedes have started to complain
about their health care system.<P>
Through its Ministry of Health and Social Affairs and the National Board of Health and
Welfare, the Swedish government, in collaboration with the Swedish Federation of
County Councils, has initiated a study of the structure, financing and organization of the
Swedish health care system - a study entitled Crossroads. This study is intended to
evaluate the present health care structure in the light of criticism and the problems
associated with the rising costs of caring for an aging population in times of contracting
economy. The study, which is directed towards the macrostructural level, will hopefully
uncover and delineate some of the critical issues in the Swedish health care system.<P>
This booklet constitutes the proceedings of a joint WHO/Swedish seminar in convened in
June 1990 to provide a forum for an international appraisal of Swedens health and
medical services, making special reference to international developments and the WHO
health for all strategy..

<H2>Resolution EUR/RC45/R10</H2>
<H2>Regional allocations under the Regular Budget</H2>

<UL>
<LI>The Regional Committee,
<LI>Having considered the report of the Regional Director in document EUR/RC45/5 which, <I>inter
alia</I>, outlined the discussion which took place during the ninety-sixth session of the Executive Board
on the subject of regional allocations, including the fact that the allocation under the Regular Budget to the
European Member States remains at 6% while European Member States collectively contribute over 45%
of the Organizations global budget;
<LI>Recalling Regional Committee resolution EUR/RC42/R6 which <I>inter alia</I> drew the attention
of the Director-General and the Executive Board to the urgent needs in the European Region, particularly
in central and eastern European countries, which call for a more adequate regional allocation from the
global budget of the Organization;
<LI>Recalling further Regional Committee resolution EUR/RC43/R10 which noted that the share of
resources allocated to the WHO regions as a whole was inadequate to take effective action on priority
health needs in the large number of countries requiring intensified cooperation in health, and therefore
recommended that members of the Executive Board, as well as representatives to the World Health
Assembly from the European Region, make an effort to improve the Regions share of global regular
budget resources commensurate with the needs of their Member States;
<LI>Noting also Regional Committee resolution EUR/RC44/R9 which requested the Director-General to
ask the Executive Board to review and analyse the methods of allocation and the actual distribution of
resources from the regular budget, and to report on options and make recommendations to the World
Health Assembly in 1995;
<LI>Continuing to be concerned that the present allocation of the regular budget to the European Region
has remained unchanged, with only minor variations due to exchange rate fluctuations, practically since the
inception of the Organization, notwithstanding;<BR>

(a)	the dramatic geopolitical changes that have taken place in Europe since the early 1990s
and which have led to an increase in the number of members from 31 to 50, several of whom are
facing serious deteriorations in the health situations of their populations due to the effects of war,
economic deterioration and social disruption;<BR>
(b)	the dramatic changes in epidemiology in a number of Member States with regard to
diphtheria, cholera, poliomyelitis and even noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular
diseases;<BR>
(c)	the fact that several Member States are now officially categorized by the World Bank as
least developed countries;
</UL>
<OL>
<LI>REGRETS that, in spite of all of the above-mentioned deteriorations, the financial resources
remain unchanged, and that pressing health needs remain unmet in many parts of the European Region due
to the current inadequate provision of regular budget resources to the Regional Office;<p>
<LI>RECALLS the concern at several previous sessions of the Executive Board and the World Health
Assembly, most notably the ninety-fifth session of the Board in January 1995, and the view that a reduction
in central administrative costs could help free the necessary funds for a more equitable distribution of
global resources to regional levels;<p>
<LI>REQUESTS the Regional Director to bring to the Director-Generals attention, as has already
been done at the current session, the Regional Committees firm conviction that the regular budget
allocation to the European Region needs to be increased, to reflect present realities in the Region;<p>
<LI>CALLS ON the members of the Executive Board from the European Region to raise this matter
during the ninety-seventh session of the Board in January 1996;<p>
<LI>REQUESTS the Regional Director to report back to the Regional Committee at its forty-sixth
session on developments in implementation of this resolution.

the World Health Assembly in 1998;<BR>
(b)	the global policy be updated at regular intervals; <BR>

<H2>Affectations budgtaires rgionales dans le cadre du
budget ordinaire</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Le Comit rgional,
<LI>Ayant examin le rapport du directeur rgional (document EUR/RC45/5) qui, notamment, rsumait
les discussions qui avaient eu lieu  la quatre-vingt seizime session du Conseil excutif sur la question des
affectations rgionales, et en particulier sur le fait que la part de la Rgion dans le budget ordinaire mondial
est demeure  6%, alors que les contributions des Etats membres europens reprsentent plus de 45% du
budget de l'Organisation;
<LI>Rappelant la rsolution du Comit rgional EUR/RC42/R6 qui attirait notamment l'attention du
directeur gnral et du Conseil excutif sur les besoins urgents de la Rgion europenne, en particulier dans
les pays d'Europe centrale et orientale, en demandant une affectation rgionale mieux adapte dans le cadre
du budget mondial de l'Organisation;
<LI>Rappelant en outre la rsolution du Comit rgional EUR/RC43/R10 constatant que les ressources
alloues  l'ensemble des rgions de l'OMS sont insuffisantes pour permettre de prendre des mesures
efficaces pour rpondre aux besoins de sant prioritaires dans le grand nombre de pays o une coopration
sanitaire intensifie est ncessaire et recommandant donc que les membres du Conseil excutif, ainsi que
les reprsentants  l'Assemble mondiale de la sant de la Rgion europenne, s'efforcent d'obtenir une
amlioration de la part de la Rgion dans les ressources du budget ordinaire mondial, afin qu'elle soit en
rapport avec les besoins des Etats membres;
<LI>Notant galement la rsolution du Comit rgional EUR/RC44/R9 qui demandait au directeur gnral
d'inviter le Conseil excutif  examiner et  analyser les mthodes d'affectation et la rpartition effective
des ressources du budget ordinaire, et de faire rapport sur les options et de prsenter des recommandations
 l'Assemble mondiale de la sant en 1995.
<LI>Demeurant proccup par le fait que la part reprsente par l'affectation actuelle de la Rgion
europenne dans le budget ordinaire est demeure inchange,  l'exception de quelques variations mineures
dues aux fluctuations des taux de change, pratiquement depuis la cration de l'Organisation, et ce en dpit
:<BR>
	a)	des changements gopolitiques profonds qui se sont produits en Europe depuis le dbut
des annes 1990 et qui se sont traduit par une augmentation de trente et un  cinquante du nombre des Etats
membres, dont plusieurs sont confronts  une dgradation grave de l'tat sanitaire de leur population due
aux consquences de la guerre, de la crise conomique et de la dsorganisation de la socit;<BR>
	b)	des bouleversements spectaculaires de la situation pidmiologique dans un certain
nombre d'Etats membres en ce qui concerne la diphtrie, le cholra, la poliomylite, et mme des maladies

mondiales au niveau des rgions; <p>

<LI>PRIE le directeur rgional d'appeler l'attention du directeur gnral, comme cela a dj t fait

<H2>Resolution EUR/RC45/R10</H2>
<H2>Regionale Mittelzuweisungen aus dem Ordentlichen
Haushalt</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Das Regionalkomitee 
<LI>nach Behandlung des in Dokument EUR/RC45/5 enthaltenen Berichts des Regionaldirektors, der
unter anderem eine Darstellung der Aussprache enthlt, die bei der 96. Tagung des Exekutivrats zum
Thema der regionalen Mittelzuweisung gefhrt wurde, bei der auch die Tatsache zur Sprache kam, da die
Mittelzuweisung aus dem Ordentlichen Haushalt fr die europischen Mitgliedstaaten weiterhin 6%
betrgt, whrend die europischen Mitgliedstaaten gemeinsam mit ber 45% zum globalen Haushalt der
Organisation beitragen,
<LI>unter Hinweis auf Resolution EUR/RC42/R6 des Regionalkomitees, in der unter anderem die
Aufmerksamkeit des Generaldirektors und des Exekutivrats auf die dringlichen Bedrfnisse der
Europischen Region vor allem in den mittel- und osteuropischen Lndern gelenkt wurde, die eine
angemessenere regionale Mittelzuweisung aus dem globalen Haushalt der Organisation erforderlich
machen,
<LI>ferner unter Hinweis auf Resolution EUR/RC43/R10 des Regionalkomitees, in der festgestellt wurde,
da der Anteil der den WHO-Regionen insgesamt zugewiesenen Ressourcen nicht ausreiche, um in den
zahlreichen Lndern, in denen eine intensivierte Zusammenarbeit in gesundheitlichen Fragen erforderlich
sei, wirksame Manahmen im Hinblick auf prioritre gesundheitliche Bedrfnisse zu ergreifen, und in der
deshalb empfohlen wurde, da sich die aus der Europischen Region kommenden Mitglieder des
Exekutivrats und die Delegierten bei der Weltgesundheitsversammlung darum bemhen sollten, den Anteil
der Region an den globalen Ordentlichen Haushaltsressourcen so zu verbessern, da er den Bedrfnissen
der Mitgliedstaaten entspricht und diese abdeckt,
<LI>ferner in Kenntnis der Resolution EUR/RC44/R9 des Regionalkomitees, durch die der
Generaldirektor ersucht wurde, den Exekutivrat zu bitten, die Methodik der Zuweisung und tatschlichen
Verteilung der Ressourcen aus dem Ordentlichen Haushalt zu berprfen und bei der
Weltgesundheitsversammlung 1995 ber Optionen zu berichten und Empfehlungen abzugeben,
<LI>fortgesetzt besorgt darber, da die derzeitige Mittelzuweisung aus dem Ordentlichen Haushalt seit
den Anfngen der Organisation mit geringfgigen, den Wechselkursschwankungen zuzuschreibenden
nderungen unverndert geblieben ist, und das trotz:<BR>
a)	der dramatischen geopolitischen Vernderungen, die sich seit Beginn der 90er Jahre in Europa
vollzogen und zu einem Anstieg der Mitgliederzahl von 31 auf 50 gefhrt haben, wobei mehrere Lnder
aufgrund der Auswirkungen von Kriegen, wirtschaftlichem Niedergang und gesellschaftlichen Spaltungen
mit einer einschneidenden Verschlechterung ihrer gesundheitlichen Lage konfrontiert sind,<BR>
b)	der dramatischen epidemiologischen Verschiebungen in einer Reihe von Mitgliedstaaten in bezug
auf Krankheiten wie Diphtherie, Cholera, Poliomyelitis und sogar nichtbertragbaren Krankheiten wie
Herz-Kreislauferkrankungen,<BR>
c)	der Tatsache, da mehrere Mitgliedstaaten mittlerweile von der Weltbank offiziell unter die am
wenigsten entwickelten Lnder eingestuft werden 
</UL>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>BEDAUERT, da trotz all dieser oben angefhrten Lageverschlechterungen die finanziellen
Ressourcen immer noch die gleichen sind und dringliche gesundheitliche Bedrfnisse in groen Teilen der
Europischen Region aufgrund der zur Zeit unzureichenden Bereitstellung von Ordentlichen
Haushaltsmitteln fr das Regionalbro weiterhin ungedeckt bleiben;<p>
<LI>VERWEIST auf die Besorgnis, die bei mehreren frheren Tagungen des Exekutivrats und der
Weltgesundheitsversammlung, vor allem auf der 95. Tagung des Exekutivrats im Januar 1995, zum
Ausdruck gebracht wurde, sowie auf die Ansicht, da eine Reduzierung der zentralen Verwaltungskosten
dazu beitragen knnte, die erforderlichen Mittel fr eine gerechtere Verteilung der globalen Ressourcen auf
die regionalen Ebenen freizumachen;<p>

<LI>ERSUCHT den Regionaldirektor, den Generaldirektor  wie bereits whrend dieser Tagung des
Regionalkomitees geschehen  auf die feste berzeugung des Regionalkomitees aufmerksam zu machen,
da die Zuweisung aus dem Ordentlichen Haushalt fr die Europische Region erhht werden mu, so da
sie die derzeitigen Realitten in der Region widerspiegelt;<p>

der 97. Tagung des Exekutivrats im Januar 1996 aufzubringen;<p>

<LI>	Having considered the document on evaluation of the EUROHEALTH programme
(document EUR/RC44/6), including the external evaluators' recommendations and the Regional

<LI>	Recalling its earlier discussions and decisions on this subject (resolutions EUR/RC40/R7,
EUR/RC41/R2, EUR/RC42/R6 and EUR/RC43/R10), and the fact that the programme was first
adopted in 1991, in consequence of which there is now a significant body of experience available
to the Regional Organization concerning the needs of EUROHEALTH countries and the range of
possible strategies to meet them;<P>

<LI>	Deeply concerned at the rapid deterioration in the economic conditions and in the level of
health of the population in many EUROHEALTH countries and its impact on social stability, as
well as at the increasing cleavage between health levels in EUROHEALTH countries and the rest
of the Region revealed by the HFA monitoring process, and mindful that the greater part of the
excess in mortality and disability is preventable;<P>

<LI>	Mindful also of the continuing shortfall in financial resources for implementation of the
EUROHEALTH programme;<P>

<LI>	Welcoming the positive initiatives taken by some Member States to harmonize their
bilateral cooperation activities with the EUROHEALTH programme, and also the clarification of
the complementary roles of WHO headquarters and the Regional Office in support of
EUROHEALTH countries, whereby the Regional Office is entrusted with the coordination of
support, the execution of operations, and negotiations with other bodies for assistance to
countries;<P>

<LI>	Aware of the improving conditions for multi- and bilateral cooperation, of the
possibilities for focusing efforts on the EUROHEALTH objectives of country health
development, and of the need to maximize the impact of the totality of assistance to
EUROHEALTH countries and to rationalize further the contributions of different partners;<P>

<LI>	Conscious of the fact that there is a lack of awareness among populations in the Region, 
as well as among various sectors and agencies in the Region, of the major contribution to 
improvement of health made by the EUROHEALTH programme (a programme that accounts for 
nearly two thirds of the regular budget of the Regional Office);<P>

<LI>	Agreeing with the external evaluators' endorsement of the strategy adopted by the
Regional Office in the implementation of the EUROHEALTH programme;<P>

<LI>	Recognizing that the greatest achievement of the EUROHEALTH programme so far has
been the gradual change in attitude towards health development in countries;<P>

programme and consequently to implement its strategy with continuous adaptation of the
programme and supporting management arrangements to the evolving health and
socioeconomic situations in the countries concerned;

<LI>to concentrate efforts on halting the further decline in health status in
EUROHEALTH countries through actions related to the most vulnerable groups of the
population and to priority health problems where effective action is possible, large
numbers of people are affected, and there is expectation of high impact and significant
improvement in the quality of care or the quality of life, notably perinatal care and safe
motherhood, immunization, communicable diseases and safe water supply, mental health,
and the prevention of death and injury due to external causes; 

<LI>to support long-term development, both to overcome the urgent problems and to
ensure a continuing and sustained improvement in health status to a level comparable
with the rest of the Region;

health for all and partnership and mutual trust, health development consortia of donor and
recipient countries which reflect donor interests and the needs of the countries, such consortia
being either of natural geopolitical areas or groupings of countries to focus on a common interest
and concern;<P>

<LI>URGES governments of EUROHEALTH countries, in discharging their responsibility
for the health of their population, to implement actions in priority areas (such as those identified
in operative subparagraph 3(b) above) which are specifically determined by them within the

dialogue with all donor interests, and where necessary to seek the support of the Regional
Organization in this endeavour;<P>

consideration of the EUROHEALTH programme and to provide support and advice to the
Regional Director in the determination of needs and the process of policy adjustment and in

(among them particularly the European Union and the Council of Europe) where strong, well
functioning working relationships need to be sustained in a spirit of coordination, cooperation
and complementarity;<P>

<LI>FURTHER REQUESTS the Standing Committee to advise the Regional Director on the
development of proposals for ensuring efficient use of donors' resources and for establishing

supported by donors; <P>

recommendations in the light of discussions within the Regional Committee and to take

(the biennial medium-term programme) which adapts the strategy of the EUROHEALTH
programme to the countries' specific needs;

<LI>to confer with the SCRC and prepare an updated EUROHEALTH programme,
with identified priorities to address the changing needs, which responds to the dynamics
of the present and expected future realities of the countries concerned, and to present the

<LI>to take such action as he sees fit, with the support and advice of the SCRC, to

integral parts of the management of education, information, prevention and emergency
preparedness programmes, including a capability for matching needs with the capacities

<LI>to strengthen the resources of the EUROHEALTH programme to permit it to
develop further, especially by continuing to mobilize all forms of external resources,
develop information systems and transfer knowledge, and to give support to national
donor coordination mechanisms and to such health development consortia as may be
established between countries and donor interests;

<LI> to facilitate meetings between the ministries of health of EUROHEALTH
countries and the governments of donor countries, including their national bilateral
development agencies, and to continue to contribute to UN-initiated country strategy
