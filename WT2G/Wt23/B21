JANE OAKHILL, ALAN GARNHAM (University of Sussex) Eds.<BR>
<BR>
The interrelated topics of discourse representation and text processing are amongst the most important in 
psycholinguistic research, and have generated a vast literature. This collection is not intended as an 
overview of this work, rather it focuses on some of the central issues that arise out of the mental models 
theory of text comprehension. According to this theory the content of discourse is represented in mental 
models of parts of the real or an imaginary world, and these models are constructed incrementally as texts 
are processed. Mental models theory emphasises the role of anaphoric expressions, such as definite 
pronouns, in linking the information in different parts of the text and, more generally, the role of inferences 
in constructing mental models. <BR>
<BR>
It also recognises the importance of formal linguistic processes such as semantic combination, in 
computing the information in the current cause that is to be added into the model. The papers in this 
volume reflect these aspects of mental models theory. They cover the understanding of noun- noun 
combinations, the interpretation of pronouns, and inference making.  Throughout, the emphasis is on the 
flexibility of the language processing system and its extensive, and often extremely rapid, use of mundane 
knowledge about the world. International interest in mental models theory is reflected in contributions from 
the United States, the United Kingdom and Continental Europe, where there is a rapidly growing interest in 
experimental psycholinguistics in general and mental models theory in particular.<BR>

<B>A Case Study of Visual Agnosia</B></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
Glyn W. Humphreys (Birkbeck College, University of London) M.<BR>
<BR>
Jane Riddoch (North East London Polytechnic)  Brain damage may sometimes cause remarkably specific 
impairments in human behaviour. One very rare  and specific impairment is the failure to recognize 
everyday objects by sight, a problem which is termed "visual agnosia". In this book, Drs. Humphreys and 
Riddoch discuss the fascinating case of a patient, John, who suffered visual agnosia after having a stroke. 
After the stroke, John's visual world seemed strange and unfamiliar; formerly well-known objects no 
longer made any sense, and he did not know what to use them for. This problem was not confined to 
objects - he also had difficulty recognizing faces or his immediate environment. He could no longer 
recognize his wife's face, his own face in the mirror was unfamiliar, and his surroundings appeared strange, 
so that he got lost when trying to find his way around. Yet, other aspects of John's behaviour were quite 
unaffected. He could recognize objects by touch or by the sounds they made, and his general knowledge 
and intellect were perfectly good. What makes the case even more intriguing is that many of the 
"components" that make up our ability to recognize objects visually seemed intact. John could draw objects 
from memory, indicating a good knowledge of what the objects should look like. He could also copy the 
objects he failed to recognize, indicating that, in some respects, he could see. Apparently, John was able to 
"see" but not to "recognize".  <BR>
<BR>
The book considers John's case from the point of view of current psychological theories of visual 
recognition, and from a review of other previously documented cases. It goes on to consider the 
implications of John's problems for understanding how we might normally recognize objects, drawing on 
investigations of his impairments. The book also includes chapters contributed by John and his wife, which 
graphically illustrate the nature of his problems and the characteristics of his changed visual world. The 
book demonstrates how our knowledge of a complex process, such as visual recognition, can be enriched 
by detailed case studies of recognition impairments. To See But Not to See is likely to become a key 
reference for those concerned with understanding how vision is implemented in the brain, and will be of 
interest to anyone concerned with the scientific understanding of the mind.  <BR>

<B>A special double issue of the journal Memory</B><BR>
<B>ROSALEEN A. McCARTHY (King's College, Cambridge) Ed. </B><BR>
<BR>
What is the basis of our ability to assign meanings to words or to objects? Such questions have, until 
recently, been regarded as lying within the province of philosophy and linguistics rather than psychology. 
However, recent advances in psychology and neuropsychology have led to the development of a scientific 
approach to analysing the cognitive bases of semantic knowledge and semantic representations. Indeed, 
theory and data on the organisation and structure of semantic knowledge have now become central and 
hotly debated topics in contemporary psychology. <BR>
<BR>
This special issue of Memory brings together a series of new papers from established laboratories that are 
at the forefront of semantic memory research. The collection includes papers presenting theoretical 
overviews of the field as well as papers containing new experimental findings. A variety of approaches to  
the problems of analysing semantic knowledge and semantic representations are included in this volume. 
For example, experimental studies of normal subjects are included together with neuropsychological 
investigations of patients with impaired semantic memory and computational models of the representation 
of knowledge in normality and disease. This collection will therefore be essential reading for researchers 
and others who are interested in memory function. It will also be of interest to cognitive scientists, 
linguists, philosophers and others who have puzzled over the many complex and central questions that 
probe the roots of our ability to understand meaning.<BR>

<CENTER><H3>WORK CENTRALITY AND RELATED WORK 
MEANINGS</H3>
<B>A Special Issue of The European Work and Organizational Psychologist</B></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
S. ANTONIO RUIZ QUINTANILLA (Cornell University, New York)<BR>
<BR>
The theme of this special issue is how cultural, societal, group, and individual factors shape what working 
has meant, means and is going to mean in the future societies. Concepts and empirical data from the 
Meaning of Work study, an eight country comparison of work related attitudes and values, and from 
complementary follow up studies serve as the "red thread" or empirical basis throughout the issue. <BR>
<BR>
Based on a heuristic model for the subjective meaning of work, the studies reported in this issue provide 
some empirical data bases and point toward new and crucial questions, that are raised by the results. In 
addition, this issue also wants to contribute a focused discussion about alternative conceptions of the 
meaning of work and its central role in understanding the concept of work, which plays such a crucial role 
in the daily lives of people. Since the way we conceptualize a particular problem issue crucially determines 
the kind of answers and explanations we derive, a thorough and lively discussion about how we are to 
understand work (and "non- work") and its meaning in a person's life as well as for society in general, 
becomes of utmost importance. Moreover, in light of European integration across cultures and global 
internationalization of organizations, the differences in cultural contexts for the meaning of work takes on a 
particularly urgent problem for better understanding.  <BR>

<BR>
This volume is the outcome of the first two editions of the European Workshops on Cognitive 
Neuropsychology held in Bressanone in 1983-84. The aim of the workshop was to promote a discussion in 
which opposite views or mutually integrating positions would be clearly spelled out and debated. Each of 
the contributions collected here was given its final form after the meeting had taken place profiting, 
therefore, from the lively discussion that followed the presentation. The first part of the book is devoted to 
attempts to define and clarify basic issues and to the confrontation of alternative views. The second part is 
intended to stimulate reflection on the relationship between cognitive neuropsychology and the related 
disciplines comprising cognitive science. The remaining sections of the book contain ten chapters 
presenting original studies on several particular topics of interest including language comprehension, 
reading and writing, face recognition and memory. <BR>

<CENTER><H3>INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY</H3></CENTER>
ILONA ROTH (Open University), Ed.<BR>
<BR>
This two volume text provides a comprehensive introduction to the issues, theories and methods of 
psychology, including both classic approaches and recent research. The areas covered range from the 
intellectual, social and emotional development of the child to the ways in which adults perceive, attend, 
remember and communicate; from Freud's psychoanalytic framework to the work of present day 
psychologists; from debates about the scientific status of psychology to the special probems which the 
study of people poses for psychologists.  Each chapter presents important issues in depth, highlighting 
controversies while showing that they rarely have neat solutions. Throughout, emphasis is given to the 
contrasting levels of analysis which contribute to the understanding of psychological functioning, from 
fundamental biological processes to complex social interactions. While prepared for the Open University 
course "Introduction to Psychology" these volumes will provide an excellent introduction to students of 
psychology at other universities and colleges. The text incorporates the best of the Open University's tried 
and tested teaching methods, and particular importance is placed on encouraging the reader's active 
participation, making the books enjoyable and stimualting as well as informative.<BR>
<BR>
The text is divided into eight sections comprising eighteen chapters. Each section will include a brief 
introduction and conclusion. The large format text is printed in two colours and includes approximately 
200 figures. <BR>

<B>The Nature, Sources and Consequences of Parents' Ideas</B></CENTER><BR>

JACQUELINE J. GOODNOW (Macquarie University), W. ANDREW COLLINS (University of 
Minnesota)<BR>
<BR>
"This is a superb text... Remembering that it is part of a series of essays on child development, I am of the 
opinion that the organisation of the chapters (the `story line') couldn't be better. The authors' style is 
readable and content is erudite without being offputting. I am really impressed by this book and believe it 
will make a contribution not only to developmental psychology, but also social psychology and my own 
field, clinical child psychology... The authors, Goodnow and Collins, are to be congratulated." Professor 
Martin Herbert (Director of Clinical Courses, University of Leicester). ~Goodnow and Collins have 
presented us with a timely and unique set of essays on the development and function of parents' ideas. 
They review a selective body of literature, reflect on knowledge gaps about parents' ideas about the 
parenting function, and present a detailed research agenda...The chapters flow coherently with discussions 
of parents ideas and those ideas' characterisations, sources and consequences for parents and 
children...Goodnow and Collins have performed an exemplary service to the field expressed in their 
interdisciplinary organization of the study of parents ideas...This book is a must for anyone in the field, 
irrespective of his or her point of view." Contemporary Psychology; Reviewed by Irving E. Sigel <BR>
<BR>
To their everyday life with children, parents bring a number of ideas about development and about 
parenting. Some of these ideas are about their own children and about themselves as parents. Others are 
more general: ideas, for instance, about what babies are like, how children change with age, what kinds of 
affection and control they need, the responsibilities of mothers and fathers, or the degree of influence each 
parent has over the way a child develops. Moreover, the ideas that parents hold, shape their actions with 
children and the way they assess both their children and their own performance as parents. With the 
recognition of parental thinking as a powerful factor in family life, research has turned to the study of this 
`everyday' or `informal' psychology. Some of the studies deal with the nature of parents' ideas: What ideas 
are held? Which are most widely shared? How do these ideas differ from one another? Some deal with the 
sources of parents' ideas: with the factors that give rise to differences among parents from different 
backgrounds (different cultures, different economic groups, different degrees of experience with children). 
Others concentrate on the consequences of parents' ideas for themselves and for children.  <BR>
<BR>
This monograph summarizes the research with an eye to several audiences (researchers, clinicians, 
educators) and with an emphasis on the questions that remain. A major goal is to point not only to 
significant gaps, but also to some specific ways in which they might be addressed by further research. <BR>

<LI>"In my opinion the book is a gem...It is more up to date, covers a wider range of material [than 
the competition] and is excellently written, in a clear and authoritative style...It will be seized on by 
undergraduates taking advanced courses in psycholinguistics for four reasons: (1) it covers virtually 
all the  central issues; (2) it is (so far as I can judge) invariably accurate; (3) it arbitrates in a fair and 
convincing manner between rival theories; and (4) it provides a superb bibliography...I think this is a 
really excellent text book. I teach a course on this topic and at this level and I shall certainly switch to 
this text." Professor Alan Kennedy, (University of Dundee)

Language occupies a central role in our lives. Psycholinguistics, the study of the psychology of language, 
studies how we speak, read, remember, learn and understand language. This textbook examines each of 
these aspects of language in detail. It emphasises how data from a number of sources are used to generate 
theories of language performance. In addition to conventional psychology experiments, it emphasises the 
cognitive neuropsychology of language in that it shows how studies of the effects of brain damage on 
linguistic performance can inform our understanding of intact language processing. The book also 
examines in depth the impact of recent influential connectionist modelling. It also provides an integrative 
overview of how the components of the language system combine together.<BR>
<BR>
The text begins with the input side of language: how we perceive and recognise speech, and how we read. 
It covers adult and developmental impairments of reading - the dyslexias - in depth. Moving on from how 
we understand single words, the book then examines how we process and remember phrases and sentences, 
how sentences are connected to form discourse, and explores how we represent the meaning of language. 
There is a detailed review of brain-damaged speech and language. Developmental issues are covered in 
depth: How do children acquire language? What happens if acquisition is impaired in some way? Finally, 
the book places language in a wider context: Is language unique to humans? Does language influence the 
way in which we think? The book is comprehensive and contemporary. It will be useful for undergraduate 
courses in cognitive psychology and the psychology of language and for postgraduates beginning research 
in this area, but will also be of interest to anyone who wants to find out about the latest research in this area 
of fundamental importance to psychology. <BR>

<UL>
<LI>"This is an excellent book. It is comprehensive and mostly very readable... The content of this 
text has been thoroughly reworked and the new edition is even better than the first. The difficult topic 
of connectionism has been put into context and made accessible, and the growth area of cognitive 
neuropsychology is well-represented and integrated into fundamental areas of cognition ... I will 
certainly use the book when it is published ... the authors are to be congratulated on such a thorough 
and scholarly job." <B>Ann Colley (University of Leicester)
</B><LI>"I think this is an excellent book which has a good chance of capturing the market as the 
definitive text book on cognitive psychology. It is a marked advance on the previous "Handbook"; 
interweaving the three approaches, experimental, neuropsychology and cognitive science, makes the 
book more interesting, more authoritative and distinguishes it from other texts." <B>Gillian Cohen 
(The Open University)</B> 
<LI>"I think it could become a standard textbook for cognitive psychology and related courses." 
<B>T.A. Harley</B>
<LI>"This is a good manuscript... it is a sensible update of the previous edition, building on its 
strengths, removing some weaker sections, and advancing into new directions - language production 
and neuropsychology... All in all a praiseworthy effort." <B>Dr. Goodwin (Sussex University)</B>
</UL>
<BR>
This is a fundamental revision of the highly successful A Handbook of Cognitive Psychology . In response 
to recent changes in cognitive psychology, it has been entirely rewritten and updated. Traditional 
experimental cognitive psychology is now supported by a cognitive science perspective that stresses 
important new developments in computational modelling and cognitive neuropsychology and shows their 
dynamic impact on perception, attention, memory, categorisation, language, problem solving and 
reasoning. <BR>
<BR>
The text is designed to be easily accessible to undergraduates through the use of section summaries, point-
by-point accounts of theories and a more attractive layout. It should become the standard text for 
undergraduate cognitive courses in the 90's, and will also be of interest to students taking related courses in 
computer science, neurophysiology and medicine.<BR>

NICHOLAS WADE<BR>
<BR>
In this book a leading researcher and artist explores how we see pictures and how they can communicate 
messages to us, both directly and indirectly by making allusions to objects in space or to stored images in 
our minds. Dr Wade provides fascinating examples of pictures that communicate hidden messages, either 
by implying something else, or by a shape or portrait which is carried covertly within another design. He 
analyses image processing stages in vision, demonstrating that the various stages may be related to styles in 
representational art. He shows how the way we have been taught to look at and recognise objects, affects 
the way we see them.<BR>
<BR>
The book lavishly illustrates with original examples of visual allusions and includes detailed practical 
advice on how photographers and designers can create them. Essential reading for photographers, 
designers, artists, people in film and television, and anyone involved in visual science , visual 
communication and advertising.<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>"This brings out the creative role in the observer. It raises questions of how perceptions are 
related to conceptions. There may not be specific answers here; but the questions are important, and 
they are quite powerfully evoked by pictures and words." Richard Gregory (Department of 
Psychology, University of Bristol) in Nature .
<LI>"Here, for the first time, is a whole series of pictures lying at the edge of one's ability to see 
things. Teachers of perception can now go beyond descriptions of recognition thresholds and show 
Wade's figures, which allow anyone to experience what is is like to be at the limit of his or her visual 
performance. It is still the quality and originality of the illustrations which make Wade's book such a 
rewarding read. There are things which linger in the mind long after one has closed the book." Ian 
Gordon (University of Exeter) in The British Journal of Psychology.

<TITLE>OBJECT AND FACE RECOGNITION</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>OBJECT AND FACE RECOGNITION</H3>
<B>A Special Issue of the journal Visual Cognition</B></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
VICKI BRUCE (University of Stirling) GLYN HUMPHREYS (University of Birmingham)<BR>
<BR>
This special issue on Object and Face Recognition presents a series of original papers which show how 
current experimental, neuropsychological and computational techniques are clarifying the mechanisms 
involved in processing and recognising objects and faces, and the relationship between face recognition 
and the recognition of other kinds of visual object. The volume starts with a selective overview of the 
literature on object and face recognition, focusing on the relationship between the two. While there are 
many similarities between the processes involved in recognising faces and other visual objects, 
neuropsychological evidence does appear to suggest that there may be networks dedicated to faces distinct 
from those used for other objects. <BR>
<BR>
The second paper reinforces this suggestion by describing a patient with object agnosia but without alexia 
or prosopagnosia. Separation of the systems for representing faces and other objects is also suggested by 
the masking effects reported in the third paper, where recognition of faces is disrupted by face or face-like 
masks more than by other visual objects of roughly similar size and shape. Holistic or configural 
processing of upright faces is often cited as the special ingredient of (upright) face recognition which 
enables so many similar patterns to be discriminated.<BR>
<BR>
Two papers on the development of face processing, and factors influencing the facial caricature effect, 
provide new evidence about the nature of such processing. Two further papers illustrate the insights that 
may be attained in the domain of visual recognition using current connectionist modelling and brain 
imaging techniques to explore the computational and neurological basis of face recognition. The assembled 
collection contains articles by leading researchers in Canada, the USA, New Zealand and Europe and 
illustrates very clearly the methodological diversity, and technical and conceptual ingenuity, of current 
work in this intriguing area of visual cognition. <BR>

<LI>"The neuropsychological study of psychosis is a relatively new field, and this book is an 
excellent addition to the literature...this is a 'state of the art book.' The chapters are clearly written and 
the book has been well edited...this book is essential reading in order to gain an insight into 
approaches and models which are currently influential." <B>Ronan O'Caroll in Psychological 
Medicine</B>. 
</UL>
<BR>
Schizophrenia is being increasingly viewed as a neurological disorder. The Neuropsychology of 
Schizophrenia addresses the key questions in modern schizophrenia research. How do abnormalities of the 
brain produce the characteristic signs and symptoms of this most severe and mysterious mental malady? 
Where are these abnormalities? How do they develop? How can we detect them? What clinical and 
cognitive effects do they have? <BR>
<BR>
This new book is the first of its kind to tackle these questions in a systematic way from a number of allied 
perspectives: from phenomenology to physiology, animal behaviour to metacognition and from PET scans 
to paper and pencil tests. A number of authors from the United Kingdom and the United States have made 
contributions; all are acknowledged experts in the field. The chapters each contain a concise review of the 
particular topic, empirical data and also a theoretical overview.  The Neuropsychology of Schizophrenia 
will be required reading for all serious students of schizophrenia from both medical and psychology 
backgrounds. <BR>

THE PRODUCTION OF ACTION</H3>
<B>From Infancy to Adulthood</B></CENTER><BR>
PETER ANTHONY WHITE (University of Wales College of Cardiff)<BR>
<BR>
This book is an attempt to trace out a line of development in the understanding of how things happen from 
origins in infancy to mature forms in adulthood. There are two distinct but related ways in which people 
understand things as happening, denoted by the terms ~causation~ and ~action~. The book is concerned 
with both. The central claim and organising principle of the book is that, by the end of the second year of 
life, children have differentiated two core theories of how things happen. These theories deal with 
causation and action. The two theories have a common point of origin in the infant's experience of 
producing actions, but thereafter diverge, both in content and realm of application. Once established, the 
core theories of causation and action never change, but form a permanent metaphysical underpinning on 
which subsequent developments in the understanding of how things happen are erected. The story of 
development is therefore largely the story of how further concepts become attached to and integrated with 
the core theories. Although the developmental and adult literatures on causal understanding appear at first 
glance to have little in common, in fact this appearance is illusory, and the idea of two theories helps to 
bring the two literatures in contact with each other. <BR>
<BR>
The book begins with a survey of the main philosophical ideas about causation and action. Following this 
the possible origins of understanding in infancy are reviewed, and separate chapters then deal with the 
development of understanding of action and causation through childhood. This is then linked to the adult 
understanding of action and causation, and the literature on adult causal attribution and causal judgement is 
reviewed from this perspective.<BR>

MICHAEL SIEGAL (University of Queensland)<BR>

<UL>
<LI>~...this is a clear and concise book which will prove useful to both the theorist of the human 
mind and the empirical researcher...a well-balanced discussion of evidence andarguments about the 
supposedly early-but-concealed capabilities of human mind to represent and process the world...a full 
description of methods and techniques that would avoid designing experiments that would 
underestimate the potentialities of very young subjects.~ <B>International Journal of Behavioural 
Development; Reviewed by Andreas Demetriou</B> 
</UL>
<BR>
It has been often maintained that young children's knowledge is limited to perceptual appearances; in this 
"preoperational" stage of development, there are profound conceptual limitations in that they have little 
understanding of numerical and causal relations and are incapable of insight into the minds of others. Their 
apparent inability to perform well on traditional developmental measures has led researchers to accept a 
model of the young child as plagued by conceptual deficits. These ideas have had a major impact on  
educational programs. Many have either accepted the view that the young are not ready for instruction, 
especially in subjects such as mathematics and science. However, this essay provides evidence that 
children's stage-like performance on the many tasks that have been used to demonstrate their limitations 
can be reinterpreted in terms of the language used in experiments. In many specialized experimental 
settings, children may inadvertently perceive adults' well-meaning questions as redundant, insincere, 
irrelevant, uninformative, or ambiguous. Under these conditions, there is a clash between the 
conversational worlds of children and adults. Children do not share an experimenter's purpose in 
questioning and how his or her words are intended. They do not disclose the depth of their understanding 
and may respond to an experimenter's questions incorrectly even when they are certain of the right answer. 
<BR>
<BR>
In this light, a different model of development emerges. It proposes that young children have abstract 
knowledge that can be examined through attention to their conversational experience. The implications for 
instruction in subjects such as mathematics and science are significant.<BR>

SCHIZOPHRENIA</H3></CENTER>
<B>CHRISTOPHER DONALD FRITH (University College London and the MRC Cyclotron Unit, 
Hammersmith Hospital)</B><BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>"I found this a stimulating and extremely well-written book...  The ultimate scientific challenge 
facing clinical psychology is to try and explain abnormal behaviour. Frith's book encourages us to try 
and explain schizophrenic experience and behaviour in psychological terms, and it deserves to be 
widely read." <B>Ronan O'Carroll in Clinical Psychology Forum</B>.
<LI>"It is seldom that one comes across a book on the subject of Schizophrenia with such fresh and 
focused ideas. Frith stimulatingly disentangles outworn concepts and cuts through the terminological 
overgrowth...This is a necessary book for scientists and clinicians; it will give them new insights and 
help them shake off vague concepts, and lexical and taxonomic bad habits." <B>W. Fraser in 
Neuropsychologia</B>.
<LI>"the doctors do not understand my illness'...Christopher Frith's monograph is a superb 
trampoline on which to bounce this question, for it provides both a succinct summary of what is 
known (or conjectured) and a highly original approach to the notion of explanation in psychiatric 
disorders." <B>John Marshall in Nature</B>.
<LI>"He succeeds in giving a clear account of the clinical and biological issues and proposes a 
sophisticated psychological explanation of the core information-processing deficits in 
schizophrenia...This book will be of interest to any psychologists, psychiatrists and allied 
professionals working with schizophrenic patients. For researchers both inexperienced and 
experienced in the field of information-processing deficits in schizophrenia, this book will be a source 
of information and inspiration." <B>Hilary Roxborough in British Journal of Clinical Psychology.
</B></UL>
<BR>
Schizophrenic patients have bizarre experiences which reflect a disorder in the Contents of consciousness. 
For example, patients hear voices talking about them or they are convinced that alien forces are controlling 
their actions. Their abnormal behaviour includes incoherence and lack of will. In this book an explanation 
of these baffling signs and symptoms is provided using the framework of cognitive neuropsychology. The 
cognitive abnormalities that underlie these signs and symptoms suggest impairment in a system which 
constructs and monitors representations of certain abstract (especially mental) events in consciousness. For 
example, schizophrenic patients can no longer construct representations of their intentions to act. Thus, if 
actions occur, these will be experienced as coming out of the blue and hence can seem alien. The patient 
who lacks awareness of his own intentions will stop acting spontaneously and hence will show a lack of 
will.<BR>
<BR>
The psychological processes that are abnormal in schizophrenia can be related to underlying brain systems 
using evidence from human and animal neuropsychology. Interactions between prefrontal cortex and other 
parts of the brain, especially temporal cortex appear critical for constructing the Contents of consciousness. 
It is these interactions that are likely to be impaired in schizophrenia. <BR>

<B>A Psychological Perspective</B></CENTER><BR>
LINDA M. MOXEY, ANTHONY J. SANFORD (University of Glasgow)<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>"I think this book will be of great interest to anyone concerned with the psychology of language 
and communication and will be very useful for final year students, postgraduates, teachers and 
researchers in the psychology of language, reasoning and related fields." <B>Dr Ken Gilhooly, 
University of Aberdeen, UK</B>
<LI>"Communicating Quantities would be an excellent contribution to third year courses in thinking 
or language. Academics in these areas will certainly want to read this book and I think that they 
would usually make it reading for their postgraduates. It is a detailed analysis of quantifier use that 
presents evidence and argument that extends understanding of usage well beyond what has previously 
been investigated. It extends the comparatively sterile logical and (what the authors refer to as) 
psychometric approaches to provide a more truly psychological understanding by focusing on the 
expectations and intentions of the speaker and listener. In summary, it is very readable and enjoyable 
and imparted very much useful information." <B>Dr Paul Pollard, University of Central 
Lancashire, UK</B>
</UL>
<BR>
Every day, in many situations, we use expressions which seem only vaguely to provide us with 
information. The weather forecaster tells us that "some showers are likely in Northern regions during the 
night", a statement which is vague with respect to number of showers, location, and time. Yet such 
messages are informative, and often it is not possible for the producer of the message to be more precise. A 
tutor tells his students that "only a few students fail their exams outright". This does not give a precise 
incidence. Yet it might be equally misleading to do so. For example, to say that 12% failed outright last 
year says nothing about other years, while to say an average of 8% over the last five years says nothing 
about variability. We argue that a precise, numerical statement can be sometimes more misleading in 
reality than a vague statement.<BR>
<BR>
Many researchers in psychology have attempted to capture the meaning of quantities by relating them to 
scales of quantity. The book explores this idea in detail and shows with original studies how these 
expressions also serve to control attention and to convey information about the expectations held by those 
involved in the communication. The book works towards a psychological theory of the meaning of 
quantifiers and similarly vagu e terms. New links are drawn between formal theories of quantification and 
psychological experimentation.<BR>

<UL>
<LI>~The book is not only a concise introduction for therapists, doctors and nurses interested in 
anorexia nervosa; it is also accessible~through the avoidance of medical and psychological jargon~to 
anorectics and their families. Without making the process seem easy, Crisp's writing is pervaded by 
optimism (backed by treatment outcome data) and a respect for the patient's struggle. The book is a 
most useful addition to the literature.~ - British Journal of Medical Psychology
</UL>
<BR>
The theme of this classic text is the enduring relationship of anorexia nervosa to the unfolding of puberty, 
which transcends and shapes the input of ~fashion~. Anorexia nervosa is closely related to the personal 
challenges of adolescence and further growth within the individual and family. The author sees the disorder 
as an avoidance of the mounting fear of normal adult weight, with puberty as its pivot. His approach to all 
those concerned involves their engagement and empowerment in the prospect of renewed, healthier growth 
and recovery. It is significantly effective both in the short and long term. <BR>

<CENTER><H3>PIAGET TODAY </H3></CENTER>
Barbel Inhelder, Denys de Caprona, Angela Cornu-Wells(all Fondation Archives Jean Piaget, Universite de 
Geneve), Eds. <BR>
<BR>
Piaget Today contains the proceedings of the 7th Advanced Course organised by Barbel Inhelder and the 
Fondation Archives Jean Piaget at Geneva University in September 1985. This book reflects the many 
facets of Piaget's works and scholars interested in a critical evaluation of these will be stimulated by the 
experimental data and theoretical developments presented here. Eminent contributors from North America 
and Europe bring their different orientations to the study of child development and genetic epistemology to  
show the continuing heuristic value of Piaget's theory and its fruitfulness in providing insights which 
permit the advancement of science. Topics discussed in this book include the appropriateness of the 
logical-mathematical models used by Piaget to structure psychological data; functionalism vs. 
structuralism; the notions of development and developmental stages; the sociogenesis of knowledge to 
account for developments in the history of science; norms and values; and recent research on space and 
memory.<BR>
<BR>
It emerges from the different chapters and from the final one (Closing Debate) in particular that one of the 
main dangers facing developmental psychology today is fragmentation. Piaget's theory was a unifying one 
with all the drawbacks (but also the advantages) of this type of theory. When one starts to criticise certain 
aspects of the theory, does one have to reject the theory as a whole? <BR>

<BR>
Unilateral neglect is a fairly common disorder, usually associated with a stroke, which results in a neglect 
or lack of attention to one side of space - usually, but not exclusively, the left. Theoretically, it is one of the 
most interesting and important areas in neuropsychology; practically, it is one of the greatest therapeutic 
problems facing therapists and rehabilitationists. This book covers all aspects of the disorder, from an 
historical survey of research to date, through the nature and anatomical bases of neglect, and on to review 
contemporary theories on the subject. The final section covers behavioural and physical remediation. A 
greater understanding of unilateral neglect will have important implications not just for this particular 
disorder but for the understanding of brain function as a whole. <BR>

<BR>
This book of readings has been prepared to accompany the Open University third-level course, Cognitive 
Development: Language and Thinking from Birth to Adolescence . It aims to bring to the student the 
fundamental questions arising in theory and research in the period from about  4-12 years, together with the 
major contemporary responses to those questions. These include the three major perspectives of Piaget, 
Bruner and Vygotsky, and recent reflections on these; the question of `stages'; metacognition; conceptual 
development; social cognition; information-processing approaches; and implications for education. It 
should be of interest to both undergraduate and post-graduate students, as well as to others with an interest 
in this subject. <BR>

<LI>"This book is outstanding for the wide ranging and deeply penetrating psychological research 
and theory..." <B>Dr John Price, Open University</B> 
<LI>"By any standards this is a major piece of work... as a clinical psychologist... I am impressed and 
excited by this book, and have rarely read a book that has left such an impression on me." <B>Dr 
Peter Trower, University of Leicester</B> 
<LI>"Dr Gilbert orients us to things both that we know and that we need yet to learn, improves our 
rationale for a variety of our procedures, and directs and gives purpose not only to our direct clinical 
work but to our reading and our collection of new information. Reading this book will acquaint one 
with an exciting "meaning-making" experience." <B>Professor Russell Gardner Jr, University of 
Texas</B> 
<LI>"Any book which attempts to bring together the ideas of Jung, ethology, sociobiology, 
psychobiology, and cogni-tive approaches, while still retaining considerable respect for 
psychoanalysis (and its recent offshoots), learning theory, and existentialism is bound to leave many 
readers gasping for breath..." 
<LI>"Gilbert's approach is highly compatible with the conception of evolution as a process whereby 
specific mechanisms evolve in order to solve specific problems ..." 
<LI>"Gilbert has written a wide-ranging and thoughtful book ... "... professionals from a variety of 
orientations will find it a provocative and informative book."

<BR>
This volume explores the implications of humans as evolved social animals. Gilbert suggests that evolution 
has given rise to a varied set of social competencies which form the basis of our personal knowledge and 
understanding. These competencies are classified as: a) Care eliciting b) Care giving c) Co-operating and 
d) Competing. Each of these are seen as core schemata, or archetypal potentials around which knowledge 
is built, and from which, our propensity for suffering flow. For example our predisposition to think of 
ourselves as superior or inferior to others comes from innate competencies which evolve from dominance 
and social ranking. Gilbert shows how primitive competencies become modified by experience and what 
happens when this modification is unsatisfactory, for example leading to preoccupations with fantasy and 
behaviour which is dominance and power focused.<BR>
<BR>
Throughout the text Gilbert shows how two psychological systems (derived from ethological and 
experimental work), labelled the defense and safety system dominate the unfolding and integration of 
human mental life. In the last chapter these varied themes are brought together to indicate how the social 
construction of self arises from the organization of knowledge encoded within the four competencies. 
Gilbert highlights how cultural factors may modify and activate many of our more primitive competencies 
leading not only to pathology proneness but also to behaviours that are collectively survival 
threatening.<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER><H3>CONNECTIONIST MODELLING IN COGNITIVE 
NEUROPSYCHOLOGY</H3>
<B>A Case Study</B></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
DAVID PLAUT (Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA), TIM SHALLICE (University College 
London)<BR>
<BR>
Computational models offer tools for exploring the nature of human cognitive processes. In connectionist, 
neural network, or parallel distributed processing models, information processing takes the form of 
cooperative and competitive interactions among many simple, neuron-like processing units. These models 
provide new ways of thinking about the neural basis of cognitive processes, and how disorders of brain 
function lead to disorders of cognition. This monograph is an expanded version of a recent issue of the 
journal Cognitive Neuropsychology. It presents the most comprehensive existing "case study" of how the 
effects of damage in connectionist models can replicate the detailed and diverse patterns of cognitive 
impairments that can arise in humans as a result of brain damage. It begins with a review of the basic 
methodology of cognitive neuropsychology and of other attempts at modeling neuropsychological 
phenomena. It then focuses on a particular form of acquired reading disorder, "deep dyslexia," in which 
previously literate adults with brain damage exhibit a wide range of symptoms in pronouncing written 
words, the most striking of which is the production of semantic errors (e.g. reading RIVER as 
"ocean").<BR>
<BR>
A series of simulations investigate the effects of damage in connectionist models that pronounce written 
words via their meaning. The work systematically explores each main aspect of the design of the models, 
identifying the basic computational properties that are responsible for the occurrence of deep dyslexia 
when the models are damaged. Although the investigation concerns a specific form of reading impairment, 
the computational principles that emerge as critical are very general ones: representation of concepts as 
distributed patterns of activity, encoding of knowledge in terms of weights on connections between units, 
interactivity between units to form stable attractors for familiar activity patterns, and greater richness of 
concrete vs. abstract semantics. The fact that damage to models embodying these principles and damage to 
the brain can produce strikingly similar behaviour supports the view that the human cognitive system 
operates according to similar principles.<BR>

<I>Cognitive Neuropsychology</I> promotes the study of cognitive processes from a neuropsychological 
perspective. It publishes papers in this rapidly growing area of research which involves the coalescence of 
interests of clinical neuropsychology and cognitive psychology.  Any work which increases our 
understanding of cognitive disorders (including developmental disorders and disorders associated with 
ageing) and interprets them in terms of theories of normal functioning, or which uses studies of such 
disorders to illuminate theories of normal functioning, is appropriate for the journal; so too are studies of 
rehabilitation based upon a cognitive-neuropsychological framework.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Cognitive Neuropsychology</I> is of interest to: clinical psychologists, cognitive psychologists, 
cognitive scientists,  linguists, neurologists, neuropsychologists, physiotherapists,  psychiatrists, 
psycholinguists, speech pathologists. <BR>
<BR>
<H4>REVIEW IN NATURE</H4>
"<I>Cognitive Neuropsychology</I> will be read by both experimental psychologists and by 
neuropsychologists. The work reported in the issues reviewed here is both interesting and first-rate... a 
journal which has accurately defined the emergence of a distinct field of study, and will rapidly become 
indispensable to those working in it." Nature<BR>

<I>Language and Cognitive Processes</I> provides an international forum for the publication of 
theoretical and experimental research into the mental processes and representations involved in language 
use. The psychological study of language has attracted increasing research interest over the past three 
decades, and Language and Cognitive Processes provides a common focus for this enterprise. It is a journal 
which emphasises the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to the study of language. Apart from 
research in experimental and developmental psychology, <I>Language and Cognitive Processes</I> 
publishes work derived from linguistics,  philosophy, cognitive neuropsychology and computational 
modelling.. Contributions are accepted in the form of experimental and observational studies, theoretical 
discussions, short notes and replies, and review articles.<BR>

<BR>
The <I>International Journal of Behavioral Development </I>is the official journal of the International 
Society for the Study of Behavioural Development which exists to promote the discovery, dissemination 
and application of knowledge about developmental processes at all stages of the lifespan - infancy, 
childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age. The journal is already the leading international outlet 
devoted to reporting interdisciplinary research on behavioural development, and is now, in response to the 
rapidly developing fields of behavioural genetics, neuroscience and developmental psychopathology, 
seeking to expand its scope to these and other related new domains of scholarship. In this way, it is looking 
to provide a truly world-wide platform for researchers which can facilitate a greater integrated lifespan 
perspective. In addition to original empirical research, the Journal also publishes theoretical and review 
papers, as well as other work of scientific interest that represents a significant advance in the understanding 
of any aspect of behavioural development. The Journal also publishes papers on behaviour development 
research within or across particular geographical regions. Papers are therefore considered from a wide 
range of disciplines, covering all aspects of the lifespan. Articles on topics of eminent current interest, such 
as research on the later life phases, biological processes in behaviour development, cross-national and 
cross-cultural issues, and interdisciplinary research in general, are particularly welcome. <BR>

<H4>REVIEW IN THES</H4>
"What distinguishes the journal most clearly from its competitors is the large number of articles which 
discuss theoretical issues compared with those that report the results of experimental investigations...his 
volume of the European Journal of Cognitive Psychology represents better value for money than the 
majority of  psychology books that their library is likely to have purchased over the past 12 months." <BR>
<B>Times Higher Education Supplement</B><BR><B>
</B><BR>
<I>The European Journal of Cognitive Psychology</I> is the official journal of the <I>European Society 
for Cognitive Psychology</I>. The society aims to encourage the exchange and integration of ideas,  
research and training in cognitive psychology throughout Europe.  The journal publishes reports of 
empirical work, theoretical contributions and reviews of the literature in all areas of cognitive psychology 
including applied cognitive psychology. Peer commentaries sometimes accompany theoretical papers in an 
attempt to stimulate lively debate about controversial issues within cognitive psychology.<BR>
<BR>
Cognitive psychology is becoming increasingly important in a European context. <I>The European 
Journal of Cognitive Psychology</I> reflects this trend by encouraging papers from all over Europe. In 
addition, the editor is happy to consider papers from outside Europe.<BR>
<BR>
<I>The European Journal of Cognitive Psychology</I> is of interest to experimental cognitive 
psychologists, applied psychologists,  psycholinguists, computer scientists, cognitive neuropsychologists 
and those working in allied disciplines.<BR>

Section A of <I>The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology</I> publishes original articles on any 
topic within the field of human experimental psychology. The majority of papers published are substantial 
experimental reports, but brief reports which allow some definite and important conclusion to be reached 
are included,  and review articles and theoretical treatments are welcome. <BR>
A distinctive feature of the journal is its book reviews. As well as normal book reviews, from time to time 
particularly important books are accorded a fuller Critical Notice which may be as long as a normal article. 
The journal is read internationally and its contributors are similarly international, with roughly equal 
proportions of articles from the UK, continental Europe and North America. <BR>
The Journal publishes occasional special issues devoted to single topics which merit particular attention. 
Special issues have included cognitive processes in reading, the planning and control of action, cognitive 
neuropsychology, human memory, feature extraction, feature integration, hearing and speech, the cognitive 
psychology of reasoning, and working memory. <BR>

<I>Cognitive Neuropsychiatry</I> is a new journal for 1996 published by <I>The Psychology Press</I>. 
The journal encourages the exploration of new frontiers and the integration and application of theories, 
methods and research findings from related fields of clinical psychiatry,  behavioural neurology and 
cognitive neuropsychology.  It seeks to promote the study of cognitive processes underlying psychological 
and behavioural abnormalities, including psychotic symptoms, with and without organic brain disease. The 
journal will publish original papers and case studies which address timely issues in clinical and cognitive 
neuropsychiatry, and which may have a bearing on the understanding of normal cognitive processes. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Cognitive Neuropsychiatry</I> has an international and multidisciplinary editorial board and will 
publish research papers of relevance to psychiatry, neurology, psychology, neuroimaging,  rehabilitation 
and connectionist modelling. <BR>
<BR>
The journal welcomes full length papers and brief communication in any of the areas indicated above. 
<I>Cognitive Neuropsychiatry</I> also welcomes review papers of significant empirical or theoretical 
impact and will include clinical and experimental studies on assessment and treatment. The first issue will 
be published in early 1996. The journal will be published quarterly, with approximately 80 pages and 5-6 
papers per issue. Book reviews and letters will be published at the Editors' discretion.<BR>

Section B of <I>The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology</I> is a leading international journal 
which publishes in all areas of comparative and physiological psychology. Papers of the highest standard 
are accepted over a wide variety of topics.  The general concerns of the Journal are: how animals acquire 
and use knowledge of their world; the nature of such knowledge; the relationship between knowledge and 
behaviour; the neural mechanisms underlying psychological processes; the relationship between learning, 
motivational and cognitive processes in non-human animals and comparable human processes; and the role 
of behaviour in ecology and evolution. The articles listed below give an indication of the areas currently 
covered by the Journal. Book reviews are a regular feature. Although concentrating on the above areas, 
they also discuss more general issues, including historical and philosophical aspects of the subject. <BR>
<BR>
<I>The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology</I> encourages and accepts papers from all over 
the world. In doing so it maintains an international perspective on key areas within comparative and 
physiological psychology.<BR>

<H2>What is Sea Exploring?</H2>


<P>Sea Exploring is the young-adult division of the Boy Scouts of America. Sea Explorers are young men and women who have completed the eighth grade and are 14 years of age, or 15 years of age but have not yet reached their 21st birthday.

<P>Young-adults join Sea Explorer ships to gain insight into a variety of programs that offer leadership, fitness, outdoor, service, social, and career hands-on activities.

<P>Sea Exploring is experiential learning with lots of fun-filled, hands-on activities. It promotes the conditions necessary for the growth and development of adolescent youth.

<P>Young people need experiences that allow them to: Interact with peers and acquire a sense of belonging. Gain experiences in decision making. Discuss conflict in values and formulate their own value systems. Reflect on self in relation to others and discover more about themselves by interaction. Experiment with their own identity. Participate as a responsible member of a group. Cultivate a capacity to enjoy life. Sea Exploring can provide these experiences in wholesome, well-planned programs run by youth members.

<H2>Steps to Organizing a Ship</H2>


<P>Each year the Boy Scouts of America requests the support of chartered organizations such as business, industrial, military, professional, religious, service, and other community organizations in operating Sea Explorer ships.

<P>Chartered organizations provide the program help for Sea Explorer ship meetings, activities, and trips through caring adult leaders.

<P>Organizing Sea Explorer ships (groups) in your organization is easy! 

<P>Just follow these five successful steps:

<OL>

<LI>Secure commitment from the chief executive officer.
<LI>CEO calls a briefing meeting of administrative or management staff.
<LI>BSA Exploring representative conducts program planning/training meetings for selected staff.
<LI>Mail student invitations and follow up by telephone.
<LI>Confirm arrangements and follow the suggested First-nighter (first meeting) agenda.

<H2>Local Program Support</H2>

<H3>BSA LOCAL COUNCIL SERVICE CENTER</H3>

Your Sea Explorer ship is supported by one of more than 360 BSA councils.

<P>The local council Exploring Division agrees to: Provide professional staff to help the ship succeed. Maintain service center activities to support Sea Exploring. Recruit, train, and guide a councilwide volunteer district/division organization. Provide councilwide activities such as canoe races, sports tournaments, road rallies, ski trips, and career-related conferences as planned by the officers and Advisors of ships at the annual planning conference. Conduct an annual career interest survey of all high schools in the council area. Provide the use of councilwide facilities such as camps and aquatic bases.

<H3>ACTIVITIES</H3>

Sea Explorers may attend the three national high adventure areas: Philmont Explorer Base, Cimarron, NM 87714 (505-376-2281); Northern Tier National High Adventure Base, P.O. Box 509, Ely, MN 55731 (218-365-4811); and Florida National High Adventure Sea Base, P.O. Box 858, Islamorada, FL 33036 (305-664-4173). Other programs that enhance Sea Explorer participation are the biennial National Explorer Leadership Conference, council, area, and regional regattas and rendezvous, and special long cruises aboard U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, and other vessels.

<H3><I>EXPLORING</I> magazine</H3>

A year's subscription to an exciting four-times-a-year publication is included in the Explorer membership fee. A monthly subscription to SCOUTING Magazine is included in the adult leader's membership fee. Sea Exploring adults leaders receive <I>EXPLORING</I> magazine as an insert in <I>SCOUTING</I> magazine.

<H3>LIABILITY INSURANCE FOR CHARTERED ORGANIZATIONS</H3>

BSA general liability insurance covers Chartered Organizations on a primary basis for any responsibility they may have because they hold a charter for Sea Exploring.

<P>Primary insurance means the Chartered Organization has exactly the same insurance as the BSA and its councils. It also means that BSA insurance will pay any and all expenses, claims or judgements against the Chartered Organization on Sea Exploring - related matters without asking the Chartered Organization and/or its own insurance to be involved. 

<H3>TRAINING</H3>

The BSA local council provides basic and advanced leader training sessions along with adult leader workshops, quarterly Advisor/Shipper meetings, and program conferences to improve and enrich ship programs.

<B>NEED KHAKIS?</B><P>

We recommend Dickies khaki trousers and shirts. They run the full gamete of
sizes, from very small to huge, they're color fast, come in both mens and women's
sizes, and are of uniform color. Be sure to cut the Dickies tab off the back of the trousers and you're set.  Ask around or check the Yellow Pages under "work clothes."<P>

<B>NEED WHITES?</B><P>

While we support white uniforms by carrying all the necessary patches for
Sea Scouting on white backgrounds, we don't deal in whites for two reasons. First of all, we don't have the room. Secondly, whites are available at reasonable prices (unlike blues) through the Reserve Clothing System in Virginia. Here's how it works:<P>

Call 1 (800) 368-4088 (the Navy Uniform Support Center.) The first time you call, you need to ask to speak to the Customer Services Supervisor so you can identify yourself as a Sea Scout leader and find out directly from the top what you need to do to place an order.<P>

The only thing you want the first time you call is a catalog and a price list. You need both of these so you'll know for sure what it is you are ordering - NEVER TRY TO ORDER WITHOUT THEM!  They will mail them to you and when you get them, THEN and then only call them back and place your order.
Yes, they take plastic. They will then ship you your goods.<P>

Sizes are, of course, no problem with them but like us, you have to remember that their uniforms are cut for people who can meet the physical requirements for
enlistment.<P>

We don't mind telling you all this because you'll find that we are a whole
lot less expensive than they are on anything that we both carry. If you need new
whites though, they are the way to go.

<P>
The National Sea Exploring Committee has a new petty officer (youth) leadership training course and award called <B>Sea Explorer Advanced Leadership Training (<I>SEAL</I>)</B>. This is a one week, hard core leadership course that is conducted at 
sea. If you successfully complete the course you will be awarded the <B>SEAL Training Award</B>, which is a silver pin with twin dolphins, to be worn on your uniform (<I>see above</I>).<BR>
<P>
This course is a leadership course, <I>not</I> a seamanship course. The course covers such topics as preparing, goal setting, organizing, supervising, commanding, communicating, training, motivating, and other topics that will help you in functioning as a
leader in your Ship and in life.<BR>
<P>
To attend a <I>SEAL</I> class you must be a registered Sea Explorer. You must have earned the Seaman Ordinary rank prior to attending <I>SEAL</I> training, and you much study and have a thorough, working knowledge of Chapter Five of the <I>Sea Explorer Manual</I>.<BR>
<P>
The following <I>SEAL</I> classes will be held during the summer of 1997:

To Europe This Summer</h2>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

The U.S. Coast Guard Academy is offering the possibility of an extraordinary opportunity to Sea scouts to be a part of their Cadet cruise this summer. <B>This year <I>Eagle</I> is again sailing to Europe.</B> <I>Eagle</I> is the 295 foot square rigger which is used to train US Coast Guard Academy cadets and officer candidates for careers in the world's most unique seagoing service. Those chosen to participate will serve as regular crew members, integrated into the underclass of cadets aboard ship.<P>
The cruise will be conducted in two phases. While both phases include Europ in their 30 day itinerary, there is still some doubt as to how many spaced will be available for Sea Scouts and which phases may be open to us. As last year, one leg will be by air to/from Europ and the U.S. Coast Guard will provide the trans-Atlantic air transportation if at all possible.<P>
This cruise is extremely hard work and is <B>not</B> to be considered in any way a pleasure cruise. You will be treated like a cadet and subject to the same discipline as a Cadet, including loss of liberty in port or even being sent home, if necessary, for severe infractions. But the training is unbeatable! And the great fun is there as you make it!<P>
If you meet the qualifications, fill out an application available from Captain James A. Umberger, USCG (Ret.), National Commodore, Sea Scouts, at (504) 486-5996, between 0800 and 1130 Central time Tuesdays or Saturdays, or from Commodore <A HREF="mailto:bjoh@loc.gov">Bruce Johnson</A> (if you are a Northeast Region Sea Scout). The application <B>must be received at Boy Scout Headquarters in a completed condition by 15 March.</B> Members of the National Sea Exploring Committee, BSA, will screen the applications and rank order the candidates for this opportunity. Spaces will be offered when they become available in that rank order.<P>
Participants must defray all round trip transportation expenses between their home and New London, Connecticut, as well as provide two complete sets of a traditional Sea Scout uniform, work clothing, and spending money. In the past, some participants have been assisted with transportation and uniforms, but that is entirely up to the council or area organization, and may not be available to all. The National organization is not able to provide any assistance.<P>
To ensure a degree of compatibility with the Cadets, only candidates who are considered likely to be competitive for entrance into the Coast Guard Academy will be selected. To that end, each applicant must submit a copy of their high school transcript or record to date, and a copy of their preliminary or senior year SAT or ACT scores with his/her application. Questions may be directed to Captain James A. Umberger, USCG (Ret.), National Commodore, Sea Scouts, at (504) 486-5996, between 0800 and 1130 Central time Tuesdays or Saturdays.<P>
<H4>QUALIFICATIONS</h4>: The applicant must:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Be at least 17, but not 20, as of 15 May 1997.
<LI>Be a registered member of the Sea Scouts/Sea Explorers, BSA, holding the rank of <B>Able</B> or <B>Quartermaster</B> as of 15 May 1997.
<LI>Be recommended by her/his Ship's Skipper, and have the approval of his/her parent(s) or guardian.
<LI>Be in excellent health and physical condition. A completed BSA Health and Medical Record is required to be submitted once you are conditionally selected. (The submission date for the medical certification will be 15 April.)
<LI>Submit your application using the enclosed form and attachments as indicated, to arrive not later than 15 March 1997, to this address:

<I>WHAT:</I>  The National Sea Exploring Committee is sponsoring an exhibit at the 1997 National Jamboree in Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia. This is the third time that the Sea Scouts have been invited to participate in this premier Scouting event since the First National Jamboree in 1937 in Washington, D.C., the first time being at the 1989 National Jamboree. The Jamboree involves over 34,000 Scouts from throughout the United States as well as 2 dozen foreign countries. Additionally, about 150,000 visitors will attend during the July 28 - August 5, 1997 period. The Jamboree receives extensive press coverage. At this time there are openings to staff a Sea Exploring promotional exhibit to the Scouting community. <P>
<I>WHO:</I>	There is a need for 28 Sea Explorers and 14 Sea Exploring adults. Full-time staffers will be on duty for only a part of each day, so they will have an opportunity to see the Jamboree when not on duty. Sea Exploring adults of any age may apply. Cost for Sea Exploring adults is $445.00 plus transportation. Sea Explorers who will be 16 by July 1, 1997 and not older than 21 as of September 1, 1997 will pay $222.50 plus transportation. <P>
<I>HOW:</I>	Request a National Jamboree Staff application from your local council service center. Fill it out, specifying National Headquarters staff, National Sea Exploring Exhibit. Do not specify any alternate jamboree assignments. Photocopy your application and send the photocopy to Bruce Johnson at the address below. Submit your application through your local council. When your application is received and processed by National BSA Headquarters in Texas, you will receive a letter of appointment from them with further instructions. You will also receive Sea Exploring Exhibit-specific instructions from Bruce Johnson as they become available. If you have any questions, please contact Exhibit Co-Chair Bruce Johnson at 6148 Llanfair Drive, Columbia, Maryland 21044, Telephone 202-707-1652 (days); 410-740-7204 (evenings); email: <a href=mailto:bjoh@loc.gov>bjoh@loc.gov</a>.<P>

<p align=left>&#160;</p>

<p align=left><font size=4>The Quartermaster Award is the highest award in Sea Scouting and is as prestigious as the Eagle Award. It represents fulfillment. It results from a Sea Scout's determination to reach a goal he or she has set and achieved in spite of difficulties along the way. </font></p>

<p align=left><font size=4>The Quartermaster Award is a badge of color, beauty, and symbolism, but most of all, of challenge, awaiting every Sea Scout who has the determination to achieve excellence.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=4>The National Sea Exploring Committee has redesigned the Quartermaster Award medal, adding a double carrick bend from which a high quality, admiralty blue ribbon is suspended. The medal, along with the lapel pin and a new pendant charm, have been re-struck from new, sharply detailed dies in sterling silver. All future Quartermaster recipients will receive these beautifully crafted emblems.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=4>If you hold the Quartermaster Award, a replacement may be ordered from the National Sea Exploring Director. Only past recipients of the Quartermaster Award may order a replacement. If you are ordering a replacement on behalf of a Quartermaster Award recipient, you must provide the recipient s name.</font></p>

<A name="The Training Plan"></A><H2 ALIGN = CENTER><B>THE TRAINING PLAN</B></H2></P>

This training is for adult Sea Explorer leaders only. Skippers, mates, ship committeemembers, and related district and council Scouters should be encouraged to participate.<P>
<B>First</B>: All Explorer leaders, including Sea Explorer leaders, are expected to take the standard Exploring training course. All Sea Explorer leaders are <I>required</I> to take the Adult Explorer Leader Basic Training before participating in this specialized training. <P>
Sea Explorer leaders should understand that standard Explorer training and national program supports apply to all kinds of Explorer posts. It is just as important that Sea Explorer leaders understand the high-school-age youth and the basic purposes of the 
program as any other leader in Exploring. <P>
<B>Second</B>: When the Sea Explorer leader has taken Adult Explorer Leader Basic Training, he becomes eligible to take part in this specialized course. It is composed of two 2 and one half hour sessions that introduce adults to the <I>Sea Exploring 
Manual</I> and other program reference material. Without a thorough understanding of these resources, the leader is seriously disadvantaged. Sea Explorers should not expect their leaders to know all the answers, but they can expect their 
leaders to know where to find them. This course serves that end.<P>

<H4>WHEN TO USE THIS TRAINING PLAN</H4><P>
1. In the organization of a new ship, this specialized training follows the Adult Explorer Leader Basic Training.<BR>
2. During the reorganization of a ship, these sessions should be given to both experienced and new leaders and committeemembers.<BR>
3. When needed, specialized Sea Explorer training can be on a district or council basis to train new leaders in existing Sea Explorer ships.<P>

<H4>HOW TO CONDUCT THIS TRAINING</H4><P>
There are several ways to conduct this specialized training. Use the one that seems to suit your situation best.<BR>
1. Run both sessions on an afternoon and evening.<BR>
2. Run the sessions on consecutive evenings.<BR>
3. Conduct one session a week during a 2-week period.<P>

<H4>THE TRAINING STAFF</H4><P>
The key instructor for specialized training should be a person with knowledge and background in the Sea Exploring program. This kind of person can be selected by the district or council Training Committee or council Sea Exploring Committee from its own membership 
or from qualified leaders in the existing Sea Explorer ships. For smooth operation, at least two adults are needed to conduct this training. A good instructor will exchange roles with an assistant frequently so that both will be involved in presentations during the two sessions.<P>

<H4>TRAINING STAFF PREPARATION</H4><P>
In order to give effective and enthusiastic leadership, the staff must prepare in advance. Experience has proved that this can best be done by reading each reference in the <I>Sea Exploring Manual</I> and then carefully preparing for each presentation, project, and discussion.<P>

NOTE: As you send out cards and bulletins promoting attendance, urge participants to secure a copy of the most current <I>Sea Exploring Manual</I> and read the first four chapters.<P>

It is suggested that copies of appendixes <A href="#Sea Explorer Leader Progress Record">A</A>, <A href="../ceremonies/index.html">B</A>, and <A href="../disabled.html">D</A>, be made available to the trainees at the beginning of class.<P>
It is also suggested but not required that coffee/refreshments be assessible for the trainees. <P>

<H4>SEA EXPLORING MANUALS ARE NECESSARY </H4><P>
Both sessions are designed to introduce the <I>Sea Exploring Manual.</I> Everyone taking the course must have one. Either they must buy one themselves or the instructor must have enough manuals available for loan. <P>

<H4>PERSONAL COACHING</H4><P>
When formal training is not feasible, personal coaching can be effective. However, it must be conducted under the following conditions: the coach should be an instructor who has conducted specialized training before, or, at least, has taken the course; and, the
coach conducts the course from this guide adapting the material to fit the circumstances. Most of this course's value is through the sharing of information. <P>

<H4>EXHIBIT MATERIAL</H4><P>
A well-planned exhibit of Exploring material will do much to help the instructor tell the whole story of Exploring in addition to selling Sea Exploring. The instructor should make an attractive display of the following literature:<P>

<I>Sea Exploring Manual</I>, No. 33239 <BR>
<I><A HREF = "../se_whatis.html">Sea Explorer Ship Program Guide</A>,</I> (written to be used with No. 23-866)<BR>
<I>Explorer Program Helps</I>, No. 34261 <BR>
<I>Advancement Report</I>, No. 34403<BR>
<I>Exploring</I> Magazine<BR>
<I>Sea Explorer Scorecard</I>, No. 33177<BR>
<I>Insignia Guide</I>, No. 33064<BR>
<I>Explorer Leaders' Handbook</I>, No. 34637<BR>
<I>Exploring Awards &amp; Recognition Program</I>, No. 23-884<BR>
<I>Exploring Operations Manual</I>, No. 33630<BR>
Boating Safety, any pertinent State/Federal material <BR>
All BSA merit badge pamphlets listed in rank requirement references, No. 33000 (series)<BR>
<I>Disability Awareness</I>, BSA merit badge pamphlet<P>

Add to this literature any logbooks, marine equipment, charts, maps, or models that relate to the course. Also seek out whatever out-of-print BSA Sea Exploring material, as well, i.e.:<P>
<I>Handbook For Skippers</I>, No. 3233 (1971)<BR>
<A HREF = "../howtoorg.html">How To Organize a Sea Explorer Ship</A>, No. 23-352 (<I>see also</I> 33630)<BR>
<I>Sea Exploring</I> promotional flyer, No. 23-140<BR>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.scouter.com/usscouts/SeaExplorers/secguide.wp6"><I>Sea Exploring Council Guide</I></A>, No. 6643 (<I>see also</I> 33630)<BR>
<P>
<H4>REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATION</H4><P>
Sea Explorer leaders are considered trained in Sea Explorer Specialized Training when they have participated and completed in both sessions. At the end of the second session, they are presented the Training Certificate, No. 33767.<P>
The instructor should make an accurate attendance check at each session using the Training Attendance Report, No. 34413, available at the council office. Ensure that the completed attendance sheet gets back to the council office.<P>
To qualify for either the Skipper's Key or the Sea Explorer Leader's Training Award, adult Sea Explorer leaders must complete the requirements as listed in <A href="#Sea Explorer Leader Progress Record">appendix A</A>.<BR>
<P>
<H4>BEWARE OF THE &quot;UNDERKNOW&quot; </H4><P>
&quot;Underknow&quot; like undertow is a dangerous undercurrent in training. It is a backwash of cutting short and half-knowledge that leaves the trainees without the information they need for understanding and using the <I>Sea Exploring Manual</I> and 
related literature. &quot;Underknow&quot; can be eliminated by carefully preparing each session. This means trainers are not to take shortcuts, but follow this guide to the best of their ability.<BR>
<P>
<H4>USING LANDSHIPS</H4><P>
The proper atmosphere is important when conducting this specialized training. Whenever possible, the instructor should hold the course aboard a landship. Dramatizing the opening and closing ceremonies adds color and interest. The instructors act 
as the ships' officers and the trainees serve as the crew. See <A href=../ceremonies/index.html">Appendix B</A> of this Instructor's Guide as well as Appendix K of the 1997 Revision of the <I>Sea Exploring Manual</I>.<BR>
<P>

<HR>

<A name="Session 1"></A><H2 ALIGN = CENTER>SESSION 1 <SMALL>(2.5 hours)</SMALL></H2><P>

<I>Important note to instructor</I>: The purpose of specialized training is to acquaint the trainee with the <I>Sea Exploring Manual</I> and related sources--not to give detailed information about any one phase of the program. Make this clear in your opening statement.<P>

<H4>BEFORE THE TRAINING BEGINS (15 MINUTES)</H4><P>
Set up the exhibit material and prepare to record those attending on the Training Attendance Report. Everyone should have a <I>Sea Exploring Manual</I> so have a supply available for sale or loan.<P>
Greet everyone as they arrive and direct them to the registration table. Give each person a name tag and see that they become acquainted with the others. Call attention to the exhibit and ask everyone to examine it. <P>
Organize the trainees into crews, briefing them in their immediate role for the Opening Ceremony. <BR>
<P>
<H4>OPENING (15 MINUTES)</H4><P>
<B>Welcome and Instruction</B>: Welcome the group and give brief instructions on how to line up and conduct the opening ceremony. In conducting the Opening Ceremony, dramatize the opening ceremony using the training staff as officers and the trainees as the crew. 
(Refer to <A href="../ceremonies/index.html"><I>Appendix B</I></A> for suggested script.)<P>
<B>Introduction of Staff</B>: After the ceremony, introduce your associates and set the tone of the course by reading the following statement:<P>
<I>It is important that all of you understand that this specialized training is designed to introduce the </I>Sea Exploring Manual <I>--not to give detailed instruction in any one phase of the program. Detailed information about Exploring can be obtained 
by participating in the standard Explorer training series. The sources of information about the Sea Exploring program and its related skills are covered in this course.</I><BR>
<P>
<H4>SEA EXPLORING IDEALS (15 MINUTES)</H4><P>
<B>Welcome Aboard</B>: Have everyone open their <I>Sea Exploring Manual</I> to page 1. Acquaint them with the ideals of Sea Exploring as found in <A href="../consolidated.html"><I>Appendix C</I></A> of this instructor's guide.<P>
The purpose of Sea Exploring is to instill in young men and women a code of ethics. The lure of the sea and the seagoing program itself are designed to attract and hold them, while the character building and citizenship training elements take effect. Use these key 
questions to initiate discussion of this vital objective:<P>
1. What is the purpose of Sea Exploring?<BR>
2. How can the codes, mottos, pledges, and promises on <A href="../ideals.html">pages iv</A>, and 4-10 thru 4-11 of the <I>Sea Exploring Manual</I>, help accomplish that purpose?<P>
<B>Uniform and Insignia</B>: Call attention to the uniforms and insignia for Sea Explorers and officers. Have everyone read <I>Introduction</I> and <I>The Ideals of Sea Exploring</I> from <A href="../consolidated.html"><I>Appendix C</I></A>of this guide. <BR>
<P>
<H4>SHIP ORGANIZATION AND LEADERSHIP (30 MINUTES)</H4><P>
<B>Ship Organization (10 minutes)</B>: Using the chart on page 2-2 explain the organizational structure of a Sea Explorer ship. The step-by-step outline in the <I>Sea Exploring Manual </I>will be more helpful if you start with the National office and end up 
with the Sea Explorers. Answer any questions and encourage discussion.<P>
<B>National and Local Terminology (5minutes)</B>: Have everyone read the information on page 2-5. Then discuss the subject to bring about a clear understanding of the need for standard terminology in Exploring. Point out that the difference in titles 
in no way detracts from the principles that are being advanced. <P>
<B>Leadership (15 minutes)</B>: Divide the trainees into three crews, preferably by Skippers, mates, and ship committeemembers. Give each crew one of the reading assignments:<P>

<UL>
    <LI>Skipper's duties, pages 2-7 thru 2-9</LI>
    <LI>Mate's duties, page 2-9</LI>
    <LI>Ship committee's duties, pages 2-10 thru 2-11</LI>
</UL>

Have each crew meet separately to read and then discuss the job responsibilities. After about 7 or 8 minutes, call the crews together for brief reports; then, as time allows, discuss their reports. <BR>
<P>
<H4>BREAK (5 MINUTES)</H4><P>
Give the group a chance to stand up and move around a bit. Insert some humor by reminding them that you run a taut ship and that she sails in exactly 5 minutes. If they don't want to get left at the dock, they'd better get back aboard before you haul up the gang plank.<BR>
<P>
<H4>QUARTERDECK MEETINGS (35 MINUTES)</H4><P>
<B>Democratic Leadership (8 minutes)</B>: Have everyone read page 4-22 of the <I>Sea Exploring Manual </I>and then discuss the following questions:<P>

1. Why should members of a ship elect their officers?<BR>
2. How do the Skipper and the mate advise and coach the elected officers?<BR>
3. How are the objectives of Sea Exploring--building character and citizenship in youth--better served through democratic rather than autocratic leadership?<P>

<B>Quarterdeck Meeting Agenda (5 minutes)</B>: Read and discuss the agenda on page 4-23, emphasizing the following important points:<P>

1. The boatswain presides; the Skipper meets with the boatswain in advance to assist in preparation for it.<BR>
2. All officers report at every meeting. This involvement of officers is absolutely necessary. <BR>
3. The ship program is planned and double-checked under the supervision of the Skipper or designated mate.<P>

<B>Program Planning Pattern (10 minutes)</B>: The effectiveness of this presentation is directly related to your knowledge of the program planning method. Although an informal approach is desirable for all presentations, it 
is essential that you thoroughly understand the planning pattern before making this presentation. The following procedure is suggested:<P>

Have the trainees turn to page 4-24, then explain the pattern of meetings and activities in the illustration. Once they understand this relationship of meetings and activities, take them through the planning pattern as follows:<P>

<UL>
    <LI>Collecting activities: Show the best sources of activities by describing and displaying the <I>Explorer Program Helps</I>, <I>Explorer Officer's Program Notebook, Exploring </I>magazine, and the suggested activities throughout chapter 4 (see page 4-24) 
        of the <I>Sea Exploring Manual</I>.</LI>
    <LI>Selecting activities: Keeping the activities sources mentioned above in mind, use the illustration on page 4-26 to show how the October activities are double-checked and the November activities are selected and scheduled.</LI>
    <LI>The activity committee: Select one activity from page 4-26 to use as an example. Explain how activity committees are appointed and how they meet to prepare and conduct activities.</LI> 
    <LI>Cruises and superactivity plans: Here again it is best to use an example. Take a highlight activity such as a summer cruise and show how the long-range preparation for it is woven into the simple month-to-month planning pattern. You will find 
        this illustrated on page 4-27 of the <I>Sea Exploring Manual</I>.</LI>
</UL>

As time permits, open the subject for discussion and reemphasize the importance of a well-balanced program. The best reference here is the six Sea Explorer experience areas found on page 4-24.<P>

<B>Consultants (8 minutes)</B>: Summarize the paragraph on pages 4-29 thru 4-30 entitled <I>What Is a Consultant?</I> Then on a paper easel or chalkboard, list the names of persons the trainees can think of who could be used as 
consultants by these ships represented. The general idea is to get them to see consultants as real people available in their own communities. Then discuss how to recruit and involve consultants and express appreciation for their services. Amplify fact that 
each person is a unique resource; everyone is of value.<BR>
<P>

<H4>SHIP MEETINGS AND ACTIVITIES (20 MINUTES)</H4><P>
<B>The Ship Meeting Pattern (10 minutes)</B>: <P>
1. Summarize the material on page 4-1 and then discuss this subject until you are sure everyone understands the meeting pattern in Sea Exploring.<BR>
2. Study the agenda of both the first and second ship meetings on page 4-2 of chapter 4. Emphasize the following points to help get this message across:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    · First meeting of the month has officers' reports -- the second does not. Many ships meet weekly -- additional meetings should follow the <I>Second Ship Meeting of the Month</I> pattern.<BR>
    · Every meeting except the officers' meeting has an activity.<BR>
    · The boatswain's mate is responsible for recruiting and reports on new members<I> </I>each month.<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
3. Call attention to the checklist of items for a ship meeting agenda, page 4-3. Be sure that they understand that this is to be used as a guide for preparing every ship meeting agenda.<P>

<B>Sample Activities and Policies (10 minutes)</B>: Divide the group into two crews. Ask one group to open the <I>Sea Exploring Manual</I> to pages 4-6 thru 4-7 and the other to pages 4-8 thru 4-10. This will divide up the sample 
activities section of the <I>Sea Exploring Manual</I> Ask each group to read as many activities as they can in the next 5 minutes. <P>
At the end of the 5-minute period, have one or two of the trainees describe the activity they liked best. Point out the policy statements on pages v, 1-18 - 1-19, 3-15, A-32 - A-34 and discuss them if time permits.<P>

<H4>CLOSING (10 MINUTES)</H4><P>
Conduct the closing ceremony with the training staff acting as officers and the trainees as the crew. (Refer to this guide's appendix for suggested script.) <P>
At the end of the ceremony, remind them of the next session and give the time and place. Announce that training certificates will be presented to those who attend both sessions.<P>
<P>

<HR>

<A name="Session 2"></A><H2 ALIGN = CENTER>SESSION 2 <SMALL>(2.5 Hours)</SMALL></H2><P>

<H4>BEFORE THE TRAINING BEGINS (15 minutes) / (if done on separate days)</H4><P>

Set up the exhibit material and prepare to record those attending on the Training Attendance Report. Everyone should have a <I>Sea Exploring Manual</I> so have a supply available for sale or loan.<P>
Greet everyone as they arrive and direct them to the registration table. Give each person a name tag and see that they become acquainted with the others. Call attention to the exhibit and ask everyone to examine it. <P>

<H4>OPENING (15 minutes) / (if done on separate days)</H4><P>
<B>Welcome and Instruction</B>: Welcome the group and give brief instructions on how to line up and conduct the opening ceremony. <P>

<B>Conducting the Opening Ceremony</B>: Dramatize the opening ceremony using the training staff as officers and the trainees as the crew. (Refer to this guide's appendix for suggested script.)<P>

<B>Introduction of Staff</B>: After the ceremony, introduce your associates and set the tone for the training experience by reading the following statement if this session is held on a different date than Session 1):<P>

<I>It is important that all of you understand that this specialized training is designed to introduce the </I>Sea Exploring Manual -- <I>and not to give detailed instruction in any other phase of Exploring. Detailed information about 
the program can be obtained by participating in the standard Explorer training series. Knowledge of program and technical skills as applied to Sea Exploring is covered in this course.</I><P>

<H4>ADVANCEMENT AND OTHER RECOGNITIONS (50 minutes)</H4><P>
<B>Why Recognition and Advancement? (15 minutes)</B>: Have trainees read page 3-1 as far as the subtitle &quot;The Quartermaster Award.&quot; When it has been read, discuss how they can make the objectives of Sea Exploring effective in the 
lives of youth. As a means of accomplishing this, use the following questions: <P>
1. How can advancement be stimulated?<BR>
2. Why are ceremonies important? <BR>
3. What about recognizing the individual talent of ship members?<BR>
4. Why is service to the ship and to others an important factor in recognition?<P>

<B>Reviewing Procedure and Bridge of Honor (5 minutes)</B>: Read the information on page 3-2 and then make sure everyone understands the following statements:<P>
1. It should be understood that those following the Boy Scout advancement plan as well as those working toward Sea Explorer advancement should be reviewed by the youth officers.<BR>
2. A review for approving the advancement application of a Sea Explorer should be primarily concerned with the ideals of Sea Exploring as practiced by the applicant. A brief review of requirements may be made to ensure the maintenance of standards for advancement.<BR>
3. It is important the Sea Explorer be given recognition at a bridge of honor as soon as possible after that Sea Explorer has qualified for it.<P>

<A HREF = "../advance.html"><B>Advancement</A> (20 minutes)</B>: Give a brief explanation of Sea Explorer advancement. Touch lightly on the Apprentice, Ordinary, Able, and Quartermaster ranks. Call attention to the information about the Eagle Award on page 3-1.<P>

PROJECT: To acquaint the trainees with the technical resources related to the requirements, select requirements from each of the ranks and ask everyone to look up the listed references. Encourage discussion and answer questions as time 
permits. (Prepare for this project in advance by selecting several requirements and becoming completely familiar with the references related to them.)<P>

NOTE: Be ready to respond to questions about whether both male and female sea explorers can earn merit badges, apart from the Boy Scout program.<P>

<B>Optional Recognition Plan (5 minutes)</B>: Have everyone turn to page 3-11 of the <I>Sea Exploring Manual</I>. Help them understand this material by explaining what the Optional Recognition Plan is. Call attention 
to the illustrations of the Small-Boat Handler and Qualified Seaman bars.<P>

<B>Other Recognitions (5 minutes)</B>: Take the group briefly through other recognitions starting with the Long Cruise badge on page 3-13. The idea here is to give them a brief look at each of the awards that are available to Sea 
Explorers. Also discuss the <A HREF = "http://www.emf.net/~troop24/reqs/expl-gold.html">Explorer Gold Award</A>.<P>

<H4>BREAK (5 minutes) (or longer, if needed)</H4><P>
Encourage the group to stand up and move around a bit. For some fun, remind them this is not shore leave, and that you are running a taut ship that will cast off in exactly 5 minutes.<P>

<H4>CRUISES AND SUPERACTIVITIES (25 minutes)</H4><P>
<B>Superactivity Opportunities (3 minutes)</B>: Explain briefly what a superactivity is. Then emphasize the importance of a highlight activity such as a long cruise to the overall program of the ship. Use an actual example from your own experience, if possible.<P>

<B>Superactivity Project (12 minutes)</B>: Divide the group into four crews and assign pages 4-32 thru 4-33 to them. Have each crew meet separately to review the opportunities listed on its assigned page and then make up a 
list of actual superactivities that are possible for their ships. Make it clear that the list must be composed of specific activities available to local ships and that whenever possible the names, places, and people to contact should be listed.<P>

Bring them back together to report on their lists. Arrange to consolidate the lists and send a copy to all ships represented as soon as possible after the course.<P>

<B>Planning a Long Cruise (10 minutes)</B>: Direct the trainees to pages 4-36 thru 4-39 of the <I>Sea Exploring Manual.</I> Point out the items necessary in preparing for a long cruise. You have only 10 minutes for this presentation, 
so keep in mind that you cannot discuss things in detail.<P>

<B>BSA Safe Boating/Sailing Standards (5 minutes):</B> Acquaint the trainees with <I>BSA's Safe Boating/Sailing Standards</I> as found in <A HREF = "../standards.html">appendix E</A>. (Make copies to distribute to the trainees.) 
The best way is to do a &quot;walkthrough&quot; involving them in looking up a subject and having them provide feedback on what they read and found. <P>

<B>Cruise Plan for Sea Explorer Ships and Explorer Posts (5 minutes):</B> Do the same with BSA's <I>Cruise Plan for Sea Explorer Ships and Explorer Posts </I>as found in <A HREF = "../cruiseplan.html">appendix F</A>.<P>

<H4>SAFETY AFLOAT (10 minutes)</H4><P>
Have everyone turn to chapter 5. Hand out papers and pencils for a true-or-false quiz. The test is to be related to the <I>Sea Exploring Manual</I> and should be handled in this manner:<P>

Following are five questions based on chapter 5. Ask a question and give everyone 2 minutes to find the answer and page reference. See how many can answer them all correctly.<P>

1. The law requires that at least one Coast Guard approved lifesaving device be on board for each person (page 5-83).<BR>
2. When abandoning ship, it's always a good idea to start right out swimming ashore (page 5-85). <BR>
3. Class C fires are electrical fires treated with dry chemicals or CO<SUB>2</SUB> (page 5-86). <BR>
4. Carbon tetrachloride extinguishers are not approved by the Coast Guard (page 5-86).<BR>
5. The mouth-to-mouth breathing method may someday be adopted by the Boy Scouts of America (page 5-87).<P>
NOTE: It is imperative the Skipper knows every ship member's swimming ability. Use of life jackets cannot be overemphasized.<P>

<H4>RESOURCES (5 minutes)</H4><P>
Acquaint the trainees with the resources listed in appendix B-1 of the <I>Sea Exploring Manual.</I> The best way is to do a &quot;walkthrough&quot; involving them in looking up a subject and having them provide feedback on what they read and found. <P>

<H4>YOUTH WITH DISABILITIES (3 minutes)</H4><P>
Introduce the trainees to the world of disabilities by illustrating that everyone has a &quot;disability&quot;, or at least inconvenienced in some way. Provide the trainees the pros and cons of taking on board youth with disabilities. Amplify the 
importance a leader's role is in making a positive difference in youth. Provide resources on disabilities the trainees can refer to (within <A HREF = "../disabled.html">appendix D</A>, and point of contacts with the Council).<BR>
<P>

<H4>SEABADGE (5 minutes)</H4><P>
Encourage the trainees to continue expanding their expertise in this program by participating in Sea Exploring's advanced leadership training, <A HREF = ../adult-seabadge.html">Seabadge</A>. Explain what can be gained in attending this training. List what specific 
training opportunities are available in the region.<P>

<H4>CLOSING (10 minutes)</H4><P>
Conduct the <A HREF = "../ceremonies/closing.html">closing ceremony</A> with the training staff acting as officers and the trainees as crew. (Refer to this guide's appendix for suggested script.)<P>

Following the ceremony as outlined in the <I>Sea Exploring Manual</I> but for the Skipper's minute substitute one of the following presentations:<P>

1. When possible, secure a VIP from the council or district to give a <I>brief</I> 3- or 4-minute talk. Ask the VIP to extend a <I>short</I> congratulations to the trainees on completing this training. Have the VIP urge 
them to continue to involve themselves in more training at every opportunity.<BR>
2. Following the VIP's message, thank your training staff and then present the Training Certificates to those completing the course. Have a word of individual congratulations for each person to make this ceremony more personal and meaningful. <P>

After the presentation of certificates, continue the closing ceremony. Many times refreshments are an added attraction that brings about fine fellowship following a training experience such as this.<P>

<P>

<P><B>Purpose</B>: The purpose of this course is to help leaders problem solve some of the difficulties encountered in having a sea explorer who is labeled <I>handicapped</I> in the unit - and hopefully change some common misconceptions about the disabled sea explorer and the limitations, as well as to give leaders the confidence to handle such situations so that all sea explorers, both disabled and non-disabled, can benefit from the situation.</P>

<P>Since each of us is disabled in one way or another by our own lack of ability to do something well - be it sing, draw, or hit a home run, this course will prove to be an eye-opener, as you learn new perspectives on the words &quot;handicapped sea explorer,&quot; and gain new ideas on how to expand and extend scouting to even more youth.</P> 

<P>An Introduction to Disability Awareness </P>

<P>1. Handicap is a matter of perspective. If you see a problem as a handicap, it can be a stumbling block or even an unclimbable mountain. On the other hand, if you see a problem as merely an inconvenience, then anything is possible. </P>

<P>2. All of us are disabled or inconvenienced in one way or another. We wear glasses, break an arm or leg, get sprains, cuts and black eyes. We can't sing, draw, cook, tie knots. We may be color blind, computer illiterate, have trouble with math, etc. Some of these are temporary conditions, some are permanent.</P>

<P>3. Virtually every scout we meet is disabled in some form, but we tend to ignore the minor disabilities and shy away from the major ones altogether: blindness, deafness, wheelchair bound, excessively shy, hyperactive, food allergies, respiratory problems, uncoordinated, can't sit still, won't be quiet, non-participatory, upset about something that happened at school. All these youth are disabled.</P>

<P>4. Disabled sea explorers can be a benefit to other youth in the unit. They can help other scouts learn about their problems and afflictions, learn how to help and to feel good about what they are doing. Once they get over their initial discomfort, boys are remarkably sensitive about the needs of others in their units.</P>

<P>5. How hard is it to change a meeting to accommodate a child with a major disability? Surprising, not very - if you <I>plan ahead</I>. Also, these youth may surprise you. For example, when instructing those who are severely visually impaired, be <I>very specific</I>, i.e., &quot;Take two steps to the right,&quot; not, &quot;Take two steps.&quot;</P>

<P>TAKING ON BOARD THOSE WITH DISABILITIES </P>

<P><I>What are some of the &quot;cons&quot; of &quot;mainstreaming&quot; youth with disabilities/handicaps in the Sea Exploring Program? </I></P>

<P><B>&quot;Cons&quot; of &quot;Mainstreaming&quot; </B></P>

<P>1. <I>If </I>the youth or their parents do not want him/her mainstreamed into a regular unit. <BR>
2. <I>If </I>the special needs Sea Explorer's parents do not/or will not participate and cooperate in the mainstream program set up for their child. <BR>
3. <I>If </I>the facility where the youth is to meet is not set up and accessible to the needs of the special needs Sea Explorer. <BR>
4. <I>If </I>the special needs Sea Explorer finds self not comfortable or accepted in the Mainstream unit. <BR>
5. <I>If </I>special needs Sea Explorers are not able to function in the regular community atmosphere they is being placed in. <BR>
6. <I>If </I>the youth's handicap or disability is so severe or profound they would not be able to function with their fellow &quot;normal&quot; Sea Explorers. <BR>
7. <I>If </I>the handicap or disability of the Mainstreamed youth will restrict the other Sea Explorers by denying them their rights to a good program in their ship. <BR>
8. <I>If </I>the group or unit is not willing to accept the special needs Sea Explorer. <BR>
9. <I>If </I>the adult leadership is not willing to accept the responsibilities that go along with mainstreaming a special needs Sea Explorer into their unit. <BR>
10. <I>If</I> the adult leadership is not willing to commit to the specialized training necessary to equip them to handle the special needs Sea Explorer and his or her needs.</P>

<P>If any of these 10 <I>If's</I> arise it may be better to consider other alternatives and direct the special needs Sea Explorer to:</P>

<P>A. A Special Needs Unit equipped and trained to give the Sea Explorer a proper program; or, <BR> 
B. Work the Sea Explorer into an <I>in-school</I> program if it is available.</P>

<P><EM><STRONG>NOTE</STRONG></EM>: A special needs Sea Explorer's ability to advance and achieve many times depends on you and the leaders' willingness to help!</P>

<P>MAKING THE DIFFERENCE</P>

<P><I>How does one &quot;turn on&quot; people to those with disabilities/handicaps? </I></P>

<P>The first step to having a disabled youth join a Ship is to excite <I>someone</I> about the possibilities that Sea Exploring might have for that youth. Someone must motivate the youth; teachers, parents or a volunteer leader who could in turn make the effort to enroll the youth as a member of a unit. The following are suggestions on how to &quot;turn on--&quot;:</P>

<P><B>a.--a </B><B><I>disabled youth</I></B><B> to want to be a Sea Scout.<BR>
</B>1. Have one of their disabled friends who is in Sea Exploring tell them how great it is. <BR>
2. Take the youth to visit a ship's meeting or campout. <BR>
3. Paint a verbal picture for the youth of the kinds of activities he or her will be involved in. <BR>
4. Have the youth meet the Skipper and one of the Sea Explorers from the ship to eliminate any possible fear of rejection. <BR>
5. If the Sea Explorer is in a special unit and does not want to leave their friends, have one of his or her buddies transfer to the ship at the same time. </P>

<P><B>b.--the </B><B><I>parents</I></B><B> to encourage their child to join.<BR>
</B>1. Ideally, the parents would be motivated by their child who wishes to join a ship; however, leaders, teachers or other parents may need to act as the primary motivator. <BR>
2. Parents should visit a successful ship which involves disabled youth. Here they would see disabled youth successfully getting along with other non-disabled youth, learning new useful skills, earning badges, showing progress and <I>having fun</I>! <BR>
3. Have another parent talk to this youth's parents about the benefits of a Sea Exploring program for disabled youth. <BR>
4. The Skipper could explain to parents of the disabled youth, the ship's activities and what is planned in the future to show how great the programs and benefits are.</P>

<P><B>c.--the </B><B><I>volunteer leader</I></B><B> to accept and recruit disabled youth.<BR>
</B>1. Include &quot;Scouting for the Disabled&quot; in the leader's training program so that he/she is aware and interested. <BR>
2. Have Sea Explorers who know a disabled youth tell the leader about the youth <I>as a person</I>, not as a disabled individual. <BR>
3. Ask a special education teacher to explain to the Skipper why and how Sea Exploring would benefit a particular disabled youth. <BR>
4. Explain to the skipper how the ship will benefit from having this person as a Sea Explorer in their unit. <BR>
5. If the youth has any Scouting background, ask the leader of his current or former unit to talk to the skipper about the accomplishments the youth has made. </P>

<P><B>d.--the </B><B><I>teacher </I></B><B>to promote scouting for his/her students.<BR>
</B>1. Show the teacher a list of benefits and educational aspects of Scouting for the disabled. <BR>
2. Explain that the disabled youth will be with Sea Exploring leaders who are trained about the nature and needs of the disabled. Resource people will also be available to provide any further help the Skipper may need. <BR>
3. Explain to the teacher the procedures that will be used to orient the Sea Explorer to the ship as well as the ship to the Sea Explorer. <BR>
4. If possible have the teacher visit a ship that involves special Sea Explorers. Let the teacher see the ship working; the mainstreaming that makes place, the friendships that develop naturally between youth despite their differences. <BR>
5. Have several Sea Explorers talk to the teacher about their program. <BR>
6. Ask the skipper to tell about future activities planned for the ship and how the disabled participate in these activities. <BR>
7. The experience of seeing Scouting for the disabled in operation will be more convincing than just talking about it.<BR>
</P>

<P>HOW DOES ONE &quot;PAVE THE WAY&quot; FOR MAINSTREAMING DISABLED YOUTH?<BR>
The following seven suggestions can help pave the way for mainstreaming youth with disabilities into a <I>regular</I> ship.</P>

<P>a. No matter how enthusiastic the parent, teacher, or Skipper may be, the success or failure of integrating a youth with a disability will depend to a great extent on the <I>attitudes of the youth</I> already in the group. Actively involve them in the planning and decision making. </P>

<P>Inform the crew leaders that you want them to find out what their unit thinks about having a youth with a disability in the ship. To help them conduct their meeting, give each a message along these lines: &quot;We have been asked to imagine that a youth who has a disability and can only get about in a wheelchair wants to become a member of our ship. Our skippers would like to know what we think of the idea, and, if we were asked to have such a youth in our crew, would we accept that youth and help him/her to make the most of being a Sea Explorer?&quot;</P>

<P>Some questions you might ask to stimulate discussion: &quot;How would having a youth with a disability in the unit affect the unit program? What extra things do you think we would have to do to help him/her? Do you think that youth with disabilities would enjoy Sea Exploring?&quot; </P>

<P>Let each crew have a meeting, lasting only 5-10 minutes without the skipper being present, and then each unit should give a brief report on what was said. What the youth say could lead to a short discussion later about Scouting with the disabled and an opportunity to correct any misconceptions that might have been expressed. This approach will give the unit membership a <I>sense of involvement</I> and help encourage them to think in real and personal terms.</P>

<P>b. <B>Another approach</B>: After talking about the new member's disability, ask the Sea Explorers if they have any idea of what it would be like not to be able to do something they take for granted. Suggest playing a game to find out. The leader should try to simulate as realistically as possible the new member's disability to help the unit youth membership to gain the understanding of the disability.</P>

<P><B>Blindness</B> - blindfold the Sea Explorers and have them perform such things as &quot;hoist the colors&quot;; &quot;identify other Sea Explorers by voice and locate where they are, produce an end splice.&quot; </P>

<P><B>Deafness </B>- no talking; let the Sea Explorers try to communicate and give instruction by mouthing words, using signs, finger spelling, etc. </P>

<P><B>Physically Disabled</B> - have a crew, each member having only one arm, stand in place, and hoist an anchor without releasing the rode.</P>

<P>c. Set up a blackboard and announce a &quot;rap&quot; session. Tell the Scouts that they may be getting a new member and that he is a bit different from them, but only in one area. Ask the Sea Explorers to tell and list on the board those things <I>that they all can do</I>, such as feel, smell, run, or ride bicycles. Deliberately leave out the area in which the youth is disabled. Then point out that youth can do all of these except the <I>one thing he cannot do</I> (see, hear, walk, etc.).</P>

<P>d. The skipper and crew leaders should visit the youth and their parents to get to know him/her before he/she attends his/her first meeting. Then, when the youth attends they will find familiar, friendly faces. Introduce the youth to the members briefly and in a matter-of-fact way. Allowing no time for embarrassment, plunge the whole group into a well planned activity which immediately includes and involves the new recruit. Remember, it may take much greater courage for the new member to face the group than for the group to face the new member. </P>

<P>e. An ideal way of introducing members and leaders to Scouting for youth with disabilities is through a joint meeting either with a special (disabled) group or with a regular group which has already successfully integrated youth with disabilities. A joint meeting gives ideal opportunities for youth and leaders to meet, talk, mix and participate in a program and atmosphere well known to all concerned. These joint meetings, particularly between regular units and special units, are often mutually valuable in themselves whether the regular group eventually includes youth with disabilities. Such a meeting gives the youth from the regular unit a wider appreciation of what Sea Exploring is all about, and also gives a real and positive meaning to the youth with the disabilities about the <I>Brotherhood of Scouting</I>. </P>

<P>f. In order to orient the current skippers/mates/committee members who will receive the disabled youth, he or she should secure from the local BSA council service center the booklet entitled <I>Exploring with Disabilities Program Helps</I>, No. 33674. Also refer to the list in <I>Resources for Working with the Disabled</I>.</P> 

<P>g. Leaders are also urged to seek further advice and ideas from their Council professional assigned to serving Scouting for the Disabled.</P>

<H2>THE HISTORY OF SEA EXPLORING</H2> 
  
<P>Sea Scouting had its beginning at a camp fire in England 
 when Lord Baden-Powell voiced the hope that older 
 Scouts would be interested in learning about boat 
 management and seamanship. He stressed the need for 
 young men to prepare themselves for service on their 
 country's ships. 
  
<P>Following the campfire, there was activity in England that 
 resulted in Lord Baden-Powell's older brother, Warington, 
 writing a book called Sea Scouting and Seamanship for 
 Boys. It was enthusiastically received by the young men 
 of Britain and soon found its way to the United States. 
  
<P>Sea Scouting in America was founded in 1912. That year, 
 Arthur A. Carey of Waltham, Massachusetts, had Sea 
 Scouts using the schooner Pioneer and was appointed 
 Chairman of the National Council Committee on Sea 
 Scouting. That summer, Charles T. Longstreth organized 
 a Sea Scout patrol on his yacht in Philadelphia. Both of 
 these men prepared pamphlets on Sea Scouting and 
 Carey's Cruising for Sea Scouts was the first literature 
 related to Sea Scouting. 
  
<P>A booklet that preceded the first Sea Scout manual 
 published in 1915 gave some direction to Sea Scouting. 
 It was entitled Nautical Scouting and was compiled by 
 Charles Longstreth. 
  
<P>Since its beginning, the Boy Scouts of America had been 
 aware of the need for an older-boy program. Mr. Carey 
 made the first real effort to satisfy that need when he 
 helped promote Sea Scouting with his pamphlet. 
  
<P>In a report to the National Executive Board, Mr. Carey 
 recommended that Sea Scouting be recognized as a 
 special department of the Boy Scouts of America. He 
 suggested that the pamphlet Cruising for Sea Scouts be 
 accepted as a supplement to the Handbook for Boys until 
 a more complete Sea Scout manual could be written. 
  
<P>From 1912 to 1917, Sea Scouting struggled through a 
 difficult period. And yet, with little or no national 
 guidance, it managed to grow. 
  
<P>In addition, G. V. L. Meyer, Secretary of the Navy, in 
 February 1913, encouraged the development of Sea 
 Scouting and extended the cooperation of the Navy 
 Department. This was the beginning of a fruitful period of 
 cooperation for Sea Scouting with the nation's armed 
 services. 
  
<P>Sea Scouting received a real boost in October 1917, 
 when James Austin Wilder (a veteran sailor, global 
 traveler, artist, and devoted Boy Scout volunteer) was 
 secured as Director of the Department of Sea Scouting of 
 the Boy Scouts of America. For several years, as a 
 volunteer, Mr. Wilder worked full time for Sea Scouting 
 with the title of Chief Sea Scout. 
  
<P>He organized the scattered Sea Scout units info a national 
 organization that generated the first wide-spread interest 
 in Sea Scouting. Gathering all of the experience and 
 scattered bits of literature used in the program, Mr. Wilder 
 supervised the preparation of the first Sea Scout Manual 
 in 1919. In those days, Sea Scouting followed a pattern 
 of action that was very similar to that of a Boy Scout 
 troop; for example: boys wore khaki uniforms. In order to 
 register, they had to subscribe to the Scout Oath and law 
 and pass the Tenderfoot requirements. Membership 
 required that a boy be 15 years of age and weigh at least 
 112 pounds. 
  
<P>For many years the Sea Scout program was aimed at 
 older boys who had graduated from Boy Scout troops. 
 Sea Scout units began to be called ships. The age-old 
 organization of skippers, mates, boatswains, coxswains 
 and crews began to be used. 
  
<P>On July 15, 1920, the well-illustrated fourth edition of the 
 Sea Scout Manual was printed and sold in large quantities. 
 Then came a period of 2 or 3 years in which Sea Exploring 
 struggled to be recognized and understood. Although 
 membership fell off, the program proved healthy enough 
 to withstand this period of adjustment. Finally it began to 
 grow as more councils gave it enthusiastic support. 
  
<P>Over the years, one of the persons most responsible for 
 the development of Sea Scouting was Commander 
 Thomas J. Keane. Between 1922 and 1925, he 
 completely revised the Sea Scout program. He wrote the 
 new requirements for advancement and changed the Boy 
 Scout nature of Sea Explorer uniforms into the seagoing 
 uniform that Sea Explorers still wear today. As a result of 
 his fine leadership, the Sea Scout Manual was almost 
 completely revised. Under his direction, it was published 
 in 1924. 
  
<P>Commander Keane served as acting director of the Sea 
 Scout department in the national office from 1923 until 
 January 15, 1927.  His annual report of 1925 indicates 
 that there were 85 registered Sea Scout ships. A similar 
 report in 1926 revealed an increase of 38 ships for a total 
 of 123 ships 
  
<P>In 1927, Commander Keane was appointed the national 
 director of Sea Scouting, its first full-time professional 
 director. In the years that followed, there was a marked 
 increase in the number of units and boys registered in Sea 
 Scouting. By 1930 the membership had reached 8,043 
 young men. In the 1930's, with the cooperation of other 
 departments in the national office of the Boy Scouts of 
 America, he developed training courses for leaders, new 
 registration procedures, and more acceptable Sea Scout 
 equipment and uniforms. 
  
<P>A major revision of the manual was made in 1939 by the 
 national committee. The new version was written by Carl 
 D. Lane, an outstanding skipper and author of many books 
 and articles about small ships and the sea. 
  
<P>With a membership of more than 27,000, Sea Scouting 
 served its country well in World War II. Commander Keane 
 was recalled to active service in the Navy and resigned 
 his position is national director of Sea Scouting. 
  
<P>Thousands upon thousands of former and active Sea 
 Scouts joined the Navy and made a tremendous 
 impression on Admiral Chester Nimitz who sincerely 
 believed that Sea Explorers were better trained and better 
 equipped to help the Navy win out over the enemy and 
 the elements. 
  
<P>Throughout the rest of the 1940's, Sea Scouting 
 continued to serve the boys of America who were 
 interested in the lore of the sea. Sea Scouts all over the 
 nation participated in flood relief and community service. 
 They were in evidence at national jamborees. Sea Scout 
 ships across the country held competitive and events 
 known is rendezvous and regattas. 
  
<P>Based on the written report of ship activities-the ship log 
 - a national committee selected the ship with the most 
 outstanding record to be the national flagship. Quite 
 surprisingly, one year this honor was achieved by a Sea 
 Scout ship located in the rather arid state of Kansas. Its 
 Skipper was Dr. William C. Menninger, one of the early 
 greats in Sea Scouting. 
  
<P>In May 1949, the National Executive Board made 
 sweeping changes in the older-boy program, as a result of 
 a study made by the Research Service of the Boy Scouts 
 of America. This revision of Senior Scouting recognized as 
 Explorers all young men who were 14 years of age or 
 older and registered with the Boy Scouts of America. 
  
<P>So, on September 1, 1949, the Sea Scouts officially 
 became Sea Explorers. This was primarily a change in 
 terminology since the old Sea Scout program continued 
 much the same is it had in the past. 
  
<P>In 1954, the National Executive Board of the Boy Scouts 
 of America authorized the Research Institute for Social 
 Service of the University of Michigan to make a national 
 study of adolescent boys. This survey revealed the needs, 
 desires, and concerns of 14- to 16-  year old boys 
 across the nation. As a result, a completely new Explorer 
 program was developed and put into effect on January 1, 
 1959. However, this did not bring about a change in Sea 
 Exploring. It was decided that changes should be 
 postponed until there had been sufficient time to observe 
 Sea Exploring in operation alongside the new Explorer 
 program. After 5 years, in which there was ample time to 
 make such observations, the decision was made to revise 
 the program. 
  
<P>The national committee on Exploring worked closely with 
 the Exploring Division in making recommendations for this 
 revision. Groups of experienced volunteers also assisted- 
 especially in the revision of advancement requirements. 
 The object was to make available to Sea Exploring some 
 of the elements of the new Explorer program that had 
 been found effective, while preserving the integrity of Sea 
 Exploring with its traditions. 
  
<P>After extensive field testing, the Exploring Division put the 
 revised Sea Exploring program into effect. This was done 
 in May 1966 with a new edition titled Sea Exploring 
 Manual, written by Arthur N. Lindgren. 
  
<P>In 1968, a new Exploring Division, BSA was organized 
 and established under the direction of John M. Claerhout, 
 who placed a new emphasis on Sea Exploring by naming 
 William J. Lidderdale as the first time director of Sea 
 Exploring since 1935. 
  
<P>After a new national Sea Exploring committee was formed 
 with Morgan F. Fitch, Jr., as chairman, to give new 
 national volunteer emphasis to the promotion and support 
 of Sea Exploring. In response to field reaction, the new 
 Handbook for Skippers was written by Arthur Lindgren 
 and published in 1971 for Skippers, mates, ship 
 committee members, and other related adult leaders. 
  
<P>In 1974, the U.S. Navy assigned a liaison officer to work 
 in the BSA national office. A series of officers served in 
 this capacity through 1983. Their work further enriched 
 and expanded Sea Exploring. 
  
<P>Sea Exploring leaders across America were saddened by 
 the death of Commander Thomas J. Keane in 1984. His 
 pioneering efforts on behalf of Sea Scouting extended 
 over sixty years. The rich tradition and long tenure of 
 many Sea Explorer ships are a tribute to his career. 
  
<P>Technological improvements in seamanship, extensive 
 changes in aids to navigation, and program improvements 
 created the need for a new Sea Exploring Manual in the 
 early 1980's. Long-time Sea Exploring leader, Bill Minto of 
 Houston, Texas, did most of the text revision with the 
 help of Don Callenius and Bob Maxfield, former national 
 directors of Exploring, and Mike Strain of San Francisco. 
 A number of BSA Skippers, U.S. Coast Guard personnel, 
 and maritime experts contributed to this revision.

<LI>A Sea Explorer must be at least Ordinary rank before he or she can start recording cruising time for the Long Cruise Badge.<P></LI>

<LI>In order to qualify for this badge, the Explorer must have cruised two weeks on any vessel or boat provided by the local council or ship, or their own vessel when authorized by an adult leader in that Explorer ship. Each additional long cruise badge is marked by a red arc above the badge, until five such cruises have been completed. Then a single white arc replaces them above the badge.<P></LI>

<LI>In the event that it is not possible to make a two week cruise, a series of weekend or overnight cruises on any boat or ship may be made, provided that the total number equals fourteen days. (<I>Note:</I> An overnight cruise lasts two days; a weekend cruise starting on Saturday and ending on Monday, will be counted as three days.)<P></LI>

<LI>There is no requirement regarding distance and number of miles.<P></LI>

<P>
Questions often asked are, "What about the Skipper and Mates?" and "Do they qualify for advancement the same way a Sea Scout does?"  This question calls for a brief explanation of the purpose of Explorer advancement and a reminder of recognitions recommended for adults in Sea Scouting.<P>

The Sea Explorer advancement program offers Ship members a series of progressive experiences in various skills with Standards for meeting them. Explorers qualifying receive special badges and awards.<P>

The sole purpose of advancement is to challenge members to engage in activities that will support the character and citizenship objectives of the Sea Scout program.<P>

One can clearly see from this that advancement is for young adults. However, there are recognitions available to adult leaders. The training and service required to qualify for these recognitions bring satisfying prestige. In every case they require either significant training or a worthwhile contribution to the effectiveness of the Sea Explorer program. The following are some of the recognitions available to adult leaders in Sea Scouting:<P>

<H3>Explorer Adult Basic Leaders Training</H3>

Two 2-hour sessions of <I>Explorer Adult Basic Leaders Training</I> are required as a prerequisite for participation in  Sea Explorer Leader's Specialized Training.   This course is intended to introduce the new Exploring leader to basic leadership and organizational concepts of BSA's Exploring program.  Though general Exploring terminology is used throughout this course, the concepts embodied in the training are essential for all Sea Exploring leaders.<P>

<A NAME="Seabadge"><H3>Seabadge Conference</H3></A>

Seabadge training is a national Sea Exploring training curriculum administered on a regional basis. Its purpose is to improve the leadership, management, and training skills of selected Sea Explorer officers; to train trainers who, upon graduation, will pass on the knowledge and insight gained during the experience to those in his or her area of Sea Scouting responsibilities; to improve the unit management skills of Sea Scout officers and committee members by stimulating tra ined Seabadge personnel to conduct local council Sea Explorer training courses; to improve the understanding of the Sea Scout program and its objectives and to use this improved understanding to increase the quality of local Sea Explorer Ships and to expand the outreach of the program; and to provide for an interchange of program and administrative ideas between Sea Scout personnel from a variety of background and locations. Upon completion of the Seabadge curriculum, the Sea Explorer leader develops a personal assignment, or  rutter , which allows the leader to employ the techniques learned in Seabadge training. Upon completion of this personal assignment, the leader is presented with the coveted Seabadge trident pin.<P>

<A HREF = "adult-seabadge.html">More information</A> on the Seabadge.<P>

<A NAME="Skipper"><H3>Skipper's Key</H3></A>

To earn the coveted Skipper's Key, the Skipper must be highly trained and demonstrate a high standard of performance. As the key adult leader of a Ship for a significant length of time, Skippers bring recognition not only to themselves but to the officers and members of their Ship by qualifying for the Skipper's Key.<P>

The Skipper's Key is known nationally as the Scouter's Key. Skippers awarded the Scouter's Key change it to the Skipper's Key by adding the Sea Exploring miniature device, No. S00931, to the center of the ribbon or  square knot.<P>

<H2 ALIGN = CENTER>Welcome to Sea Exploring</H2>

Sea Exploring is a division of the Boy Scouts of America for young men and women aged 14 through 20. Its purpose is to bring a character building, citizenship training, and fitness program to the youth of America. Sea Explorer Ships are organized by churches, civic clubs, schools, maritime organizations, businesses, unions, and other community organizations that provide adult volunteer leaders, program resources, and meeting facilities. These Ships plan programs related to maritime careers, seamanship, and service. <p>
Today's Sea Exploring started as Sea Scouting in 1912 and has a long and colorful tradition. Thousands of young men and women have had the opportunity to follow the traditions of the sea while learning what the future holds for a career related to the sea or a lifelong hobby of recreational boating. Many Sea Explorer Ships maintain sail or power vessels; follow a challenging rank advancement program; and have nautical uniforming, customs, and ceremonies.<P>
<HR>
<P>

<H2 ALIGN = CENTER>What Does a Sea Explorer Ship Do?</H2>

The program of a Sea Explorer Ship is based on matching the interests of the members with the skills, equipment, and resources of the chartered organization. Most Ships follow the traditional advancement program found in the <i>Sea Exploring</i> <i>Manual </i>The Ship's program follows the customs and traditions of the sea and encourages members to earn the ranks of Apprentice, Ordinary, Able, and Quartermaster (equivalent to the BSA Eagle rank).<P>
Sea Exploring advancement includes uniforms, safety, customs, swimming, boating, marlinspike seamanship, piloting, signaling, drill, cruising, galley, sailing, boats, tackle, first aid, navigation, boat maintenance, engines, sea history, lifesaving, equipment, weather, radio, customs, and ideals. <p>
Some Sea Explorer Ships prefer to plan their program around some specialty such as sailing, careers, scuba diving, or an aquatic sport. They may not utilize Sea Explorer uniforms and advancement but offer a flexible program to those young adults having a specific career or hobby interest.<P>

<H2 ALIGN = CENTER>Steps to Organize</H2>

(The BSA Publication <i>Exploring--Post Organization,</i> No. 6623 contains detailed information on the following steps.)<P>

<H3>Step One</H3>

When an appropriate organization is selected to charter a Sea Explorer Ship, the BSA council assigns an organizer to guide the following steps. This organization may be a church, civic club, school, labor union, maritime association or business, or other community group.<P>

<H3>Step Two</H3>

The organizer and a council staff member visit the top person in the organization (pastor, president, CEO, etc.). They review the purpose and program of Sea Exploring and the responsibilities of the organization in chartering a Ship. The top person agrees to:<P>

<ul>
<li>Commit the organization to support a Sea Explorer Ship.</li>
<li>Inform the key leaders of the organization about Sea Exploring.</li>
<li>Recruit the adult Ship leaders.</li>
<li>Provide program resources and a meeting location.</li>
</ul>
<P>

<H3>Step Three</H3>

The organizer meets with the organization's key leaders. This may be an executive committee, church board, department heads, etc. The purpose and program of Sea Exploring are reviewed. The top person asks the key leaders to:

<li>Support their Sea Explorer Ship.</li>
<li>Help secure program resources and equipment.</li>
<li>Identify prospective adult leaders. These are men and women over 21 years of age who are of good character and have the ability to lead a quality Sea Explorer program for youth.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<H3>Step Four</H3>

The top person and the key leaders invite these prospective adult leaders to an organizational meeting. The purpose, program, and leadership of a Sea Explorer Ship are reviewed using the <i>Sea Exploring Manual. </i>Explorer leader basic training sessions are scheduled following the outline in <i>ExplorerLeader Basic Training. </i>Sea Explorer leaders specialized training, found in <i>Sea Exploring--Council Guide, </i>is also conducted. After these training sessions are completed, the organizer guides these prospective leaders to select a Skipper, two or more mates, and the Ship Committee. The organization's top person is involved in this selection. The job descriptions for these positions are found in the <i>Sea Exploring Manual. </i><p>

<H3>Step Five</H3>

The Sea Explorer Ship program capability inventory is completed. This is a list of adults in the organization who can help with instruction, resources, and equipment for Ship meetings, activities, and cruises. The Ship Committee secures the use of watercraft, as needed, for the Ship program, keeping in mind that the cost of operating and maintaining a large vessel may be prohibitive for a new Ship.<p>

<IMG ALIGN=Middle SRC="graphics/howtoorg/org-03.jpg" WIDTH=276 HEIGHT=160><P>

<H3>Step Six</H3>

The first 3 months of meetings and activities are planned and scheduled. These would include weekly or bimonthly Ship meetings, Saturday or weekend activities or cruises, and monthly Ship Committee meetings. The program for the first few Ship meetings might include the following:<p>

<ul>
<li>Introduction to the Sea Explorer program</li>
<li>Instruction related to Sea Explorer advancement, particularly Apprentice</li>
<li>Discussion of Ship uniforms</li>
<li>Election of officers</li>
<li>Boating safety - Swim checks </li>
<li>Basic nautical skill instruction</li>
</ul>
<P>

<H3>Step Seven</H3>

Young adults are recruited to join the Ship.  Names from the council career interest survey may be used.  Announcements and publicity are developed. Prospective members could be recruited through schools, churches, and community organizations. Sons and daughters of members of the chartered organization can be invited.<p>

<IMG ALIGN=Middle SRC="graphics/howtoorg/org-04.jpg" WIDTH=276 HEIGHT=160><P>

The first Ship meeting (called a firstnighter) is carefully planned to provide an exciting program to attract prospects to join. &quot;Hands. on&quot; maritime activities could be featured. The Ship leaders review the schedule of meetings and activities along with the structure, activities, and advancement opportunities in Sea Exploring. Leaders and members from nearby Ships may be invited to help. All new Ship members should purchase a <i>Sea Exploring Manual.</i> Sea Explorers must be 14 years of age and have graduated from the eighth grade and be under 21 years of age. The organization determines if its membership is coed, all-female, or all-male.<P>

<IMG ALIGN=Middle SRC="graphics/howtoorg/org-05.jpg" WIDTH=304 HEIGHT=172><P>

<H3>Step Eight</H3>

The Ship is chartered by the BSA council. All members and leaders must be registered. Registration forms and information will be provided by the organizer. The charter and membership cards will be presented to the chartered organization at an appropriate occasion.<P>

<H3>Step Nine</H3>

The new Ship members elect officers as soon as possible. The Skipper may appoint temporary officers until the Ship members know each other well enough to elect.
<p>

<H3>Step Ten</H3>

The Skipper trains the new officers using the <i>SeaExploring Manual </i>and <i>Explorer Leader Handbook. A</i> year's schedule of meetings and activities should be developed avoiding any conflict with school, church, or community events.<p>

<H2 ALIGN = CENTER>Suggested Program for a New Sea Explorer Ship</H2>

<H3>Meetings</H3>

Ship meetings can be held as frequently as the time of the leaders and members will permit. Many Ships meet an average of once a week, not always on the same day and not always formally. For instance, one week the members may gather at the harbor to work on boats. Another week they may get together on a Friday night to go to a show, skating, bowling, etc. At least once every 3 months a business meeting is necessary to elect officers, plan the Ship's next 3-month program in detail, make assignments, and transact other business. (See chapters 2 and 4 in the <i>Sea Exploring</i> <i>Manual.)</i><p>

<H3>Program Planning</H3>

At a program planning meeting, it is essential to have school and council calendars available. When the Ship's members have agreed upon the program content they desire, the officers appoint chairs for the selected activities and help them name a committee. An adult officer or Committee member is selected to serve as an adviser to each committee. These committees have the responsibility for the complete planning, promotion, and conduct of the activity in their charge. (See chapter 2 in the Sea <i>Exploring Manual.)</i><p>

<H3>Program Content</H3>

The following program outline has been developed as a suggestion for a new Ship just getting underway. It is based on two meetings a month of the entire Ship, an
officer's meeting (Quarterdeck), plus an activity or field trip. It can be modified or adapted to fit the needs and interests of members and leaders. It is also assumed that May is the first month. Modify the program accordingly for beginning in other months.<p>

In some locations, council and/or area Sea Explorer events are conducted. These dates should be included in the Ship's calendar.<p>

          Seabadge training is a national Sea Exploring training
          curriculum administered on a regional basis. Its
          purpose is to improve the leadership, management, and
          training skills of selected Sea Explorer officers; to
          train trainers who, upon graduation, will pass on the
          knowledge and insight gained during the experience to
          those in his or her area of Sea Exploring responsibili-
          ties; to improve the unit management skills of Sea
          Explorer officers and committee members by stimulating
          trained Seabadge personnel to conduct local council Sea
          Explorer training courses; to improve the understanding
          of the Sea Explorer program and its objectives and to
          use this improved understanding to increase the quality
          of local Sea Explorer Ships and to expand the outreach
          of the program; and to provide for an interchange of
          program and administrative ideas between Sea Explorer
          personnel from a variety of background and locations.

Sea Exploring leadership training is designed to provide all youth and adult leaders a series of simple but effective training opportunities to meet their needs. The plan doesn't require a lot of equipment or material and all courses are scripted so that they can be taught by those with limited Exploring experience.This is very important for a lot of courses. For example, without the scripts, it would be very difficult for a new Ship Skipper to run the Quarterdeck Seminar.<P> 

The following training courses are available for Sea Explorers and Sea Exploring adult leaders:<P>

<P>SUBJECT: New <U>BSA Safe Boating/Sailing Standards</U> for vessels owned and operated by the Boy Scouts of America.</P>

<P> FROM: Don Winston, Director,
Exploring Division </P>

<P> THROUGH: Parvin L. Bishop,
National Program Director </P>

<P> TO: Scout Executives and All
Professional Staff Members<BR>
 </P>

<P> When the new <I>Passenger Vessel
Safety Act of 1993</I> was signed into law, it cleared up the
confusion for recreational boat owners over who is a
&quot;guest&quot; on board and who is a &quot;passenger for
hire.&quot; This being the determination for compliance to either
commercial vessel or recreational vessel standards of the U. S. Coast Guard. </P>

<P> Under the new law, a &quot;passenger for hire&quot; is defined for the first time as someone who has contributed &quot;consideration&quot; to the owner, operator, or agent of the vessel as a condition of being taken out on the boat. </P>

<P> The new definition of &quot;consideration&quot; does not include nominal gifts such as food, drink, or any other small item. The seven dollar annual registration fee has not been determined to be &quot;consideration&quot; under the new law. Voluntary sharing of expenses for food, fuel, bait or other supplies for the outing does not constitute &quot;consideration.&quot; Thus, BSA owned vessels <B>are not</B> considered &quot;small passenger vessels&quot; or &quot;passenger vessels&quot; regardless of the number of Scouts or Explorers on board, and therefore <B>not</B>
subject to U.S. Coast Guard operator's licensing and inspection. (USCG letter of 10/06/94 and the USCG publication titled <I>Federal Requirements and Safety Tips for Recreational Boats</I> are attached) </P>

<P> <B>Action:</B> The following new <I>Safe Boating/Sailing Standards</I> will become effective immediately, except for exempt boats, and applies to the operations of boating and sailing activities at the unit, district, and council level.  </P>

<P> NATIONAL COUNCIL BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA </P>

<P> <B>NEW SAFE BOATING/SAILING STANDARDS</B>  </P>

<P> <B>(For Vessels Owned and Operated by the Boy Scouts of America) </B> </P>

<P> <B>EXEMPT </B> </P>

<P> <B>BOATS Row Boats, Canoes, Open Cockpit Sailboats, Small Vessels Propelled Solely by Oars or Paddles.</B> </P>

<P> <B>Safety Standards:</B> </P>

<P> BSA Aquatic Safety Standards as published in &quot;Safety Afloat,&quot; Guide to Safe Scouting, No. 34410. </P>

<P> <B>BOATS 30'</B> <B>and UNDER</B> </P>

<P> <B>Three New Safety Standards:</B> </P>

<P> 1. These boats shall display a current USCG Auxiliary &quot;Seal of Safety&quot; decal obtained through a free &quot;Courtesy Marine Examination&quot; by a member of the USCG Auxiliary within the council territory.<BR> 

2. Adult leaders operating BSA boats shall complete the basic
boating safety course from one of the following local
organizations:  </P>

<P> U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary <BR>
U.S. Power Squadrons <BR>
U.S. Sailing <BR>
American Red Cross <BR>
Boating safety course qualified by your State Boating Law Administrator. <BR>
Equivalent training or experience gained from participating in sailing or small boat programs i.e., U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast guard, or Merchant Marine Academies <BR>
USCG Operator's License. <BR></P>

<P> To find a conveniently-located boating safety course, call the BOAT/U.S. Foundation for Boating Safety's toll-free Course Line, 1-800-336-BOAT.  </P>

<P> 3. An annual Boat Safety Check List completed and filed with local council thirty days after charter renewal by a member from the council Health and Safety Committee or other council committee as designated by the Scout Executive. (Boat Safety Check List and sample Council Authorization Certificate are attached and should be reproduced locally.)  </P>

<P> <B>BOATS OVER 30'</B> </P>

<P> <B>Four New Safety Standards:</B> </P>

<P> (1.), (2.), and (3.) as above. </P>

<P> 4. Operators of these boats shall obtain every four (4) years a &quot;Condition Survey&quot; (i.e., statement or letter indicating the condition of the vessel and suitability for the service intended) from a recognized or certified Marine Surveyor and filed with local council.<BR>
 </P>

<P> <B>BOATS CARRYING</B> <B>PASSENGERS</B> <B>FOR HIRE</B> </P>

<P> <B>New Safety Standards:</B> </P>

<P> 1. In all cases, the operator must have a U.S. Coast Guard operator's license. </P>

<P> Under the Passenger Vessel Safety
Act of 1993, a &quot;passenger for hire&quot; is defined for the
first time as someone who has contributed
&quot;consideration&quot; to the owner, operator, or agent of the
vessel as a condition of being taken out on the boat. In such cases,
the operator must have a U.S. Coast Guard operator's license and
retain or seek a U.S. Coast Guard Certificate of Inspection for
the vessel. </P>

<P> 2. The other major change in the
law that may affect some BSA owned boats is in the use of the
vessel as a charterboat. Under the new law, a bareboat charter
vessel <B>carrying more than 12</B> &quot;passengers for
hire&quot; must now be inspected by the U.S. Coast Guard. </P>

<P> A vessel measuring less than 100
gross tons can <B>carry up to 6</B> &quot;passengers for
hire&quot; and does not need to be inspected. It is now called an
&quot;uninspected small passenger vessel.&quot; </P>

<P> A vessel measuring more than 100
gross tons can <B>carry up to 12</B> &quot;passengers for
hire&quot; and does not need to be inspected. It is now called an
&quot;uninspected passenger vessel.&quot;  </P>

<B>SUBJECT</B>: Cruise Plan for Sea Explorer Ships and Explorer Posts <BR>
<B>FROM</B>: Don Winston, Director, Exploring Division<BR>
<B>TO</B>: Scout Executives, Skippers, and Advisors </P>

<P>The following policies are recommended in regards to Cruise Plans and Tour Permits by all Ship/Post personnel. </P>

<P> l. <B>LOCAL DAY SAILING--</B> within sight of the departure point <B>does not require a Cruise Plan</B> to be filed with a designated safety officer for boats under 26 feet or under 40 horsepower prior to leaving. A cruise plan should be filed for boats over 26 feet or over 40 horsepower (see Designated Safety Officer definition in paragraph 2)  </P>

<P> 2. <B>LOCAL WATERS CRUISING--</B> for boats traveling beyond visual observation from the departure point but less than 500 miles distance and less than five days duration <B>requires a Cruise Plan</B> to be filed with a designated safety officer prior to leaving.  </P>

<P> The <B>DESIGNATED SAFETY OFFICER</B> could be the council Sea Base watchstander, Sea Base OD (Officer of the Day), or a Ship/Post responsible person (parent/adult) who can be contacted by radio or telephone should problems develop.  </P>

<P> 3. <B>EXTENDED CRUISING--</B> for boats traveling beyond 500 miles or for more than five days <B>requires a Cruise Plan and National Tour Permit</B> to be filed thru the Local Council Service Center at least two weeks in advance. This Cruise Plan should also be posted on a vessel bulletin board at the departure base if such is available.  </P>

<P> <B>ACTION:</B> This recommended Cruise Plan is provided for council use.  </P>

<P> <B>NATIONAL EXPLORING DIVISION</B> <B>BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA</B> </P>

<P><A name="CRUISE PLAN"><FONT size="5" face="Arial"><B>CRUISE PLAN</B> </FONT> </A></P>

<P> <B>For Sea Explorer Ships and Explorer Posts</B> </P>

<P> Skippers/Advisors: If your boat is leaving the vicinity of your home base (dock, yacht club, etc.) so as to be out of sight of another Explorer leader, you should file this Cruise Plan before departure and cancel it when you return. If you are overdue, this is our only way of starting search procedures. If you are delayed or have a problem and have a radio, call via the marine operator so that we don't start searching needlessly.  </P>

<P> Approval of Parents or Guardians and Medical Release for each Explorer (See Approval Form in Appendix, <I>Explorer Leader Handbook</I>, No. 34637). </P>

<P> <B>INSURANCE INFORMATION and REQUIREMENTS </B> </P>

<P> All boats under 26 feet or under 40 horsepower are automatically covered through the BSA general liability program. Boats 26 feet and/or over 40 horsepower owned by the council must be scheduled with the national office as there is no insurance coverage until an additional premium is paid. Vessels owned by chartered organizations or others and used in Scouting activities should carry their own insurance. If the chartered organization does not carry primary liability insurance on the boat, then it should be scheduled the same as a council
owned vessel. Watercraft in the category of 50 feet or more are specifically excluded from BSA umbrella liability coverage and must be scheduled on a separate policy and an additional premium is charged. </P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>

<DT>In 1970, a group of experienced Sea Explorer leaders met at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. Their purpose was to explore the possibilities of an advanced management training experience for Sea Explorer ship and administrative leaders. The result of this meeting was the Sea Explorer Seabadge Conference. </DT>

<DT>&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>A curriculum was developed and the first Seabadge Conference was held a year later at the U.S. Coast Guard training facility on Governor's Island, Alameda, California. The program was repeated a few months later at the U.S. Coast Guard Station, Los Angeles, California, and then spread throughout the Northeast region and the Midwest.</DT>

<DT><BR>

Recognizing the value of the program, the national committee on Sea Exploring appointed a special committee to gather the best techniques from the courses that had been conducted and consolidate them into a standard <I>Seabadge Conference Guide</I><U>.</U> Further refinements led to this guidebook, which represents the official Seabadge Conference outline for the Boy Scouts of America. The current version was updated in 1988.<BR>

</DT>

</dl>

<P>
<H2>Seabadge Conference Purposes and Overview</H2>

<P>

<H3>Purpose</H3>

<P>
The purposes of the Seabadge experience are:
</P>

<UL>

<LI>To improve the understanding of leadership, management, and motivation among selected experienced Sea Explorer adult volunteer leaders. </LI>

<LI>To provide management, leadership, and presentation skills and tools to these leaders so that they may use them and share them with others in their day-to-day activities and through leading a Seabadge conference. </LI>

<LI>To use this understanding and these skills and tools to improve and expand both the quality and quantity of the Sea Explorer program as a way to reach the Aims of Scouting. </LI>

</UL>

<DL>

<H3>Overview, Principles, and Approach</H3>

1. It is assumed that the participants will be well versed in the Sea Exploring program. This conference will not present any program material. To the extent that program is dealt with, except for its use as common basis for group exercises, the conference will not succeed in reaching its purposes.</Dt>

<DT>&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>2. Extensive formal training and experience in management is the prerequisite for all Seabadge instructors. A good mix of both men and women with business management backgrounds at the executive level will help. Executive managers with no background in Scouting have been found to bring refreshing views and their use is strongly encouraged. At lease one outside consultant of this type should be mandatory to a good Seabadge experience.</DT>

<DT>&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>3. The Seabadge Conference program first presents the overall Aims and Methods of Sea Exploring and how they relate to the purposes of Scouting. It then deals briefly with instructional methods and techniques. We then get into the key issues where most of the conference time will be spent: motivational theory, management versus leadership, planning, problem solving, decision making, management principles, and finally, behavioral theory as another view before tying all this together as the basis of management and leadership. Various team exercises--each providing the opportunity to demonstrate what is gained from the previous sessions--follow, interspersed with sessions providing additional tools and techniques. <BR>

<DT>The Seabadge conference is an official part of the Explorer leader training program of the Boy Scouts of America. As such, this conference guide should be followed carefully in the presentation of the conference material. Minor adjustments may be necessary because of the portion of the country involved, but care should be taken that all learning objectives are met for each conference period.<BR>

</DT>

</DL>

<P>These types of recognitions are available for the Seabadge program: <BR>

</P>

<P>1. The Seabadge certificate is to be presented to each participant upon successful completion of the conference.<BR>

2. The Seabadge recognition emblem is presented to the participants upon the successful completion of his or her Seabadge assignment. This emblem consists of a silver trident within a circle of blue olive leaves, the ancient symbol of Neptune's leadership over his dominions of the sea combined within a circle of friendship. The three prongs of the trident are symbolic of the three purposes of the Boy Scouts of America and the fact that the Seabadge participant is a spearhead of Sea Exploring in attaining the program objectives of the Boy Scouts of America.

When others are called upon to speak, the BOS'N seats himself at
a post by the starboard gangway. When the announcements are
completed, the BOS'N stands and introduces the Skipper's Minute.
When the SKIPPER is finished, he moves to the quarterdeck. As the SKIPPER

salute, drop their salutes, and then return to their crews. The
BOS'N does not return the salutes. He then faces about, passed
the Ensign to the OOD, salutes, drops his salute and awaits instructions.
The OOD secures the Ensign on the bridge. The OOD does not return

<P><FONT size="2" face="Arial">It is suggested for expediency to
have the number side boys required for senior-most dignitary line
up all at once. As dignitaries come aboard together (junior

him throughout the inspection. As the SKIPPER approaches the

also be used (such as Appendix K of the 1997 printing of the <I>Sea
Exploring Manual</I>.) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT size="2" face="Arial">The BOATSWAIN'S MATE FOR
ADMINISTRATION is in charge of the ceremony, under the guidance
of the First Mate. The ceremony is carried out aboard a landship
or in a room with chairs set to outline a landship.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size="2" face="Arial">The BOATSWAIN'S MATE FOR
ADMINISTRATION instructs the CANDIDATE beforehand in his/her part
of the ceremony. If there is more than one CANDIDATE, they are
handled as a group and speak out in unison. Chairs should be set
up on the outside of the landship for parents and guests. They
should be sent invitations and be ushered to their seats by Sea
Explorers before the ceremony begins.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size="2" face="Arial">The following items are necessary
for the admissions ceremony:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size="2" face="Arial">The National ensign <BR>

Ship's Code <BR>
The <I>Sea Exploring Manual</I> <BR>
Recruit's membership certificate </FONT></P>

<P><FONT size="2" face="Arial">Sea Explorer ships can add a
special touch to their admission ceremony by using lighting
effects and recorded background sound effects (e.g., sound of
breaking waves). They can use their imagination so long as they
remember that the purpose of the admission ceremony is to give
both the CANDIDATE and HIS/her parents a serious look at the
ideals and responsibilities of Sea Exploring as well as the
program opportunities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT size="2" face="Arial">The admission ceremony generally
follows the regular opening ceremonies of a Sea Explorer ship. It
is a short and impressive ceremony with the entire membership
standing in formation (either at ease or at attention, as
directed by their officers). The YEOMAN and CREW LEADER of the
crew to which the CANDIDATE is assigned take part.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size="2" face="Arial">The BOATSWAIN'S MATE FOR
ADMINISTRATION begins the ceremony by inviting the parents of the RECRUIT
to come aboard. The Honor Guard then escorts them over the port
gangway to the quarterdeck where he/she introduces them to the
SKIPPER and then offers them seats for the ceremony.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size="2" face="Arial">The BOATSWAIN'S MATE FOR
ADMINISTRATION then calls for the RECRUIT and meets the new RECRUIT
at the port gangway and escorts him/her to the FIRST MATE, who is
stationed at the mainmast. Stationed also at the mainmast is the
BOATSWAIN'S MATE FOR PROGRAM, rolled up under his/her arm, the
Explorer Code Poster and the Explorer Emblem and Motto Poster. As the
RECRUIT approaches, the BOATSWAIN'S MATE FOR PROGRAM unrolls the
Explorer Code and holds it in full view.<BR>

<P><FONT size="2" face="Arial"><STRONG>FIRST MATE: </STRONG>&quot;You
now see before you the Explorer Emblem and Motto. This is the
dynamic emblem of Exploring that calls in turn for your dynamic
support of Sea Exploring. You can best give that support by ever seeking
to abide by the motto, 'Our best today - for a better tomorrow.'
BOS'N'S MATE, will you take the SEAMAN RECRUIT to the bow of the

<P><FONT size="2" face="Arial"><STRONG>SKIPPER: </STRONG>&quot;Loyalty
to our nation and respect to the flag are basic parts of Sea
Exploring. With that in mind, I would ask you to be ever mindful
of the heritage and freedoms we share in this great

and his/her parents first the privileges of membership and second,
the responsibilities of membership.) <BR>

<P>The following is a consolidation
and updating of the opening from the <I>Sea Exploring Manual</I>
1983 printing of the 8th edition (1966). Cross-references are
made to pages in the <I>Sea Exploring Manual</I> 1997 printing of the 9th
edition (1987).</P>

<P><INTRODUCTION</P>

<P><B>WELCOME ABOARD, SHIPMATE</B>.
Sea Exploring is an exciting program with smart uniforms and
awards. It's going places, and you can cruise along.</P>

<P>Sea Exploring is <I>citizenship</I>
experience gained from living according to your convictions. You
practice patriotism and civic responsibility with a gang your own
age. You follow a program of activities run by and for youth,
using democratic methods for reaching your goals...</P>

<P><Sea Exploring is <I>service</I> to
others. It develops the attitude of helpfulness. You'll enjoy
this useful feeling that comes from responsible action....</P>

<P>Sea Exploring gives you <I>outdoor </I>fun
and adventure, skill in lifelong recreation sports, and a
knowledge of seamanship...</P>

<P>Sea Exploring helps you achieve <I>social </I>acceptance.
It improves your ability to get along with people...</P>

<P>Sea Exploring is <I>personal
fitness</I> developed through physical, mental, and emotional
growth in a climate of participation....</P>

<P>Sea Exploring includes <I>career
exploration</I>. You explore the education and training needed
for the occupations related to your own interests and abilities.</P>

<P>THE IDEALS OF SEA EXPLORING</P>

<P>As part of its steering gear, Sea
Exploring splices into the lore of the sea the ideals of the Boy
Scouts of America--a code of conduct so good and strong that it
has more than stood the test of time. The Scout Oath or Promise
and the Scout Law are basic to the purposes of Sea Exploring.
they are expressed more maturely in the Explorer Code. Become
familiar with all of these and use them often--along with your
own ship code--in your ceremonies and activities. Make them a
part of your life.</P>

<P><STRONG>THE SEA PROMISE and THE
EXPLORER CODE , </STRONG><I>Sea Exploring Manual</I>, page iv.)</P>

<P><B>Your Ship Code</B> (refer to <I>Sea
Exploring Manual</I>, page 4-10). Supplementing the national
Explorer Code is your own ship code developed by the members. it
should be a statement that expresses such ideals as the purpose,
performance, progress, and tradition of your ship.)</P>

<P><B>The Explorer Motto</B>:<I> Our
Best Today ... For a Better Tomorrow.</I></P>

<P><B>Pledge of Allegiance</B><BR>
I pledge of allegiance to the Flag of the United States of
America and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under
God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</P>

<P><B>The Scout Oath or Promise </B><BR>
On my honor I will do my best: <BR>
To do my duty to God and my country, and obey the Scout Laws; <BR>
To help other people at all times; <BR>
To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally
straight.<BR>
</P>

<P><B>The Scout Law</B><BR>
A Scout is--<BR>
Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, Obedient,
Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean, Reverent.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>YOUR DUTIES AS A SEA EXPLORER
(refer to <I>Sea Exploring Manual</I>, page v.)</P>

<P>HOW TO JOIN (refer to <I>Sea
Exploring Manual</I>, page v.)</P>

<P>UNIFORMS FOR SEA EXPLORERS (refer
to <I>Sea Exploring Manual</I>, pages 3-11 thru 3-23)</P>

<P>In joining your Sea Explorer ship,
you automatically become a member of the Boy Scouts of America.
This is the largest uniformed body of volunteers and youth
members--anywhere. Sea Exploring has earned a splendid reputation
all over the world. So, you can wear your uniform with pride.</P>

<P>As soon as you're registered as a
Sea Explorer, you can buy one of the uniforms shown on these
pages. They're are a real bargain, and they wear well--especially
if you keep them properly cleaned and pressed. The <I>Sea
Exploring Manual</I> explains proper care of the uniform. ...
Skippers and other adult leaders should wear one of the uniforms
shown. A ship whose adult officers are clad in trim uniforms
almost automatically will have a uniformed crew who have
justifiable pride in their appearance--and in their ship.</P>

<P>BADGES AND INSIGNIA (refer to <I>Sea
Exploring Manual</I>, pages 3-11 thru 3-23)</P>

<P>You wear badges and insignia on
both the white and blue uniforms. Some of them help to identify
you with your council or ship. Others tell your office--if you
are an officer--or show what awards you have earned. These marks
are signs of authority or honor. Learn to tell what they mean.</P>

<P>Wear these emblems correctly and
proudly. They signify achievement and are visual proof that you
are making good use of your opportunities as a Sea Explorer.</P>

<P>This page links to various areas dealing with this topic. A feature
of the page is the current World Congress held in Stockholm to address
this international disease. Also recently (mid 1996), an African Congress
was held in Pretoria to determine the local dimensions of this form of
child abuse.<BR>
<BR>
Due to the fact that ACAPA was conceived of, and born from the womb of,
THE HOUSE, a group of projects specialising in dealing with Child Prostitution
- the initial bias of ACAPA will be in this field. This situation is brought
about not by a special affinity as such but rather the availability of
material to reproduce on these sites. Any venturer into this area will
find the insight and amount of information astounding. <BR>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>How the childfriend machinery works</H2>

<P>For those worried that they may have to 'toi-toi' in front of their
local courts, put your worry at rest. Childfriend needs you to put pen
to paper and write to everybody that wants to hear, but most important
to those that do not, or rather choose not to hear. Childfriend members
will not speak out as one voice, namely that of Childfriend - on the contrary,
members will speak out with their individual voices, voices that are 300
strong. Childriend will notify members about the exploitation of and the
injustices done to our children and at the same time supply members with
all the relevant addresses so that members can put pen to paper or fingers
to keyboard. Individual letters will be mailed to the ministers, courts,
police and the media questioning society's responsibility and ethics with
regards to our children. What Childfriend intends to do is to 'jam' the
systems ... suddenly there is not only one irate and irrational individual
complaining, whom they can choose to ignore ... now they have over 300
complaints in writing from citizens and school children from across the
country that demand an explanation ... naturally in writing. Can you imagine
the workload Childfriend can create, the questions that have to be answered,
the justification of actions? Bottom line - they will have to realise that
their disregard for our children will have to come to an end. Slowly but
surely Childfriend will force the issues and in the process the application
and enforcement of legislation will change, for the benefit of our children.
</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Hello Childfriend Members!</H3>

<P>How is this going to work? The power of Childfriend lies in the mobilisation
of all our members to speak out against ineffective systems of dealing
with child abuse. Your voice will be heard along with many others and as
a united front we will make a stand against the apathy and indifference
of our society. Your membership means a great deal to us at The House.
In our view, we are simply the instigators, you make up the body of Childfriend.
Your input, advice and desire to see change will be what drives and moves
Childfriend.<BR>
Our aim, as the Childfriend Committee, is to keep you informed, to educate
where we can, but mostly, our aim is to channel your dissatisfaction with
the system. There is nothing easier than to bury our heads in the sand
and to ignore the social depravation so prevalent around us. We know that
we have done just that for far too long. Learning the facts has shaken
us. Your membership tells us that you, too, are tired of sitting back and
allowing our children to be raped and then face gross injustice.<BR>
<BR>
Motivating you won't be difficult but our goal is that you would inspire
your family, your friends, your workmates, your community to take a stand.
Childfriend will go only as far as you take it. Childfriend is not a voice
representing many bodies but rather a body with many voices. We need any
contribution you make but, more significantly, every abused child who has
felt the pain of betrayal and injustice begs for your contribution, big
or small.<BR>
<BR>
Childfriend is the brain child of Jean du Plessis. He and his wife Adele
established The House five years ago. In their battle against child prostitution
it became clear that child abuse is a significant contributor to this growing
problem. With some research, the statistics have revealed that an urgent
need exists for society to take a stand against child abuse.<BR>
<BR>
The Childfriend Committee, consisting of a group of volunteers, came together
and decided to publish a bi-monthly newsletter. </P>

<CENTER><P><A NAME="edit"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Editorial</FONT></B>THE
CHILD PROTECTION UNIT<BR>
What do you do when you see a crime committed against a child?<BR>
Ag, don't we just call that special police unit that deals with children?<BR>
<BR>
I think we are all educated to this level and we all feel secure knowing
that someone out there will handle cases of child abuse. But how much do
you really know about the Child Protection Unit (CPU)? Do you realise exactly
how necessary they are and, in contrast, how little they have to work with?
<BR>
<BR>
In the old days before child protection services were important enough,
each police station saw to the keeping of the peace in the area Crimes
against children had to be reported to the local police station where they
would be investigated by the local personnel. <BR>
<BR>
Then, for very good reason, CPU was formed and has been nationally co-ordinated
as a specialised unit. In the last five years this national unit has had
to organise and structure itself. CPU use specially selected and trained
personnel who can work with children, who definitely have the child's best
interests at heart and who will not be swayed because of familiarity with
the accused. CPU officers only deal with child criminals and crimes against
children and can advise Public Prosecutors as to the laws pertaining to
the cases.<BR>
<BR>
There have been several newspaper articles recently that highlighted the
problems CPU are facing as a unit. Recently, Childfriend visited their
offices and were able to spend some time with Cpt PI Pretorius. We left
feeling that we can only respect what these people do. The odds they work
against (I'll get into details later) are great, the emotional strain can
only be guessed at and their work load is both huge and urgent. I asked
why they go through all this and the only reason given was &quot;We do
this for the children.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
CPU's devotion to these children extends beyond the call of duty. They
get called to crime scenes that the rest of us would rather avoid, they
do night surveillance in dangerous areas and work long, hard hours. They
go out of their way to win a child's trust and to meet the child's needs.
Their love for the children they work with can be seen in their faces.
Nothing is too hard, too far or too late if it means helping a child in
distress. <BR>
<BR>
CPU fills a large void in the policing of crimes against children. Although
some police units are corrupt whilst others are inefficient, The House
trusts the CPU with whom they have worked in many instances.<BR>
<BR>
Cpt Pretorius mentioned that their work is not taken very seriously by
outside policemen or the public and they have been given the nickname &quot;The
Nappy Squad&quot;. In addition they seem to receive more complaints from
the public than thanks. Cpt Pretorius explained that he can understand
the public's complaints because sometimes the CPU is unable to respond
to calls or they arrive late. Let us try to understand why.<BR>
<BR>
Ever since the founding of the CPU, the number of sexual abuse cases handled
by the unit drastically escalated. By 1993 CPU handled 16 809 cases. This
escalated in 1994 to almost 23 000 cases.<BR>
<I>According to The House most of the brothels that feature teenage and
child prostitutes have the highest of high tech security and surveillance
systems and a multitude of armed guards on the premises. TH knows the CPU
to be not only understaffed but grossly under equipped as well. In order
to make the successful retrieval of children possible - and make a charge
stick - the police need to at least match the crooks in human resource
numbers and technology. It is futile for TH to think that CPU can assist
them in opposing these rackets since the CPU simply does not have the facilities
to bust these operators. One club notorious for its ability to provide
child prostitutes, (and that was the training ground for many of the girls
TH works with, when they were between 12 and 14) was never busted or raided
by CPU for the past 4 years. Another club from which CPU often removed
teenage prostitutes over the past four years, was never charged for any
of these incidents. Currently there are numerous teenage girls working
in brothels in Hillbrow, not without CPU's knowledge, but for this unit
to act on these cases they need more human resources and facilities. TH
feels very alone out there. Yes, SANAB should be doing the work but they
simply do not care. In a recent incident TH thought it had a break with
a child of 18 who had been on the streets, with CPU's knowledge, for the
past three years. She was busted by SANAB for possession of 13 grams of
cocaine. SANAB, as all too often happens, once again lost the evidence
and the child never appeared in court. Instead she was sent back to the
streets. CPU should be doing these busts where children are involved. Most
of the drugs sold on the streets are sold to children and young people
- that constitutes crimes, both by, and against, children - and should
rightfully be dealt with by CPU and not SANAB - but CPU is not equipped.
<B>This is not good, in fact this is definitely not good.<BR>
<BR>
</B></I>South Africa cannot afford to have the CPU limited. With almost
a third of our population being children, and with sexual abuse of children
reaching epidemic proportions, the expansion and improvement of this unit
is of utmost urgency. We cannot allow the State to make the mistake of
limiting the CPU. This unit can be nothing less than a national specialist
unit with the highest of priorities.<BR>
</P></CENTER>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="feat"></A>Feature article</H3>

<P>The details are similar to many. A father with a step daughter and two
younger girls of his own. He has a history of drug abuse and moderate violence
towards his family. His wife is not a strong person and feels helpless
to do anything about his behaviour. When the children complain that he
is molesting them she tries to hide from the problem first by disbelief
and later by minimising and rationalising the problem.<BR>
<BR>
Details of the abuse are irrelevant. It suffices to say that eventually
a complaint to one of the mother's friends prompted action as a result
of which the father was prosecuted.<BR>
<BR>
As a result of the prosecution the children were subjected to our very
child unfriendly legal system. The system frightens the daylights out of
adults - one can only speculate on the damage it may do to a child. In
this case the father represented himself and therefore had opportunity
to cross examine the children in court.<BR>
<BR>
<B>This cross examination was done face to face in open court.<BR>
</B>There is no argument that this cross examination was extremely traumatic
to the children. It has been suggested by some experts in the field that
the damage done by the process of justice to a child is often more severe
than the initial molestation..<BR>
<BR>
We believe that cross examination of young children in open court is in
itself child abuse. We intend to raise our collective voice against this
practice - a practice which is quite unnecessary.<BR>
The legal objective of hearing a child's evidence is to establish the truth.
Terrifying the child is not conducive to attaining that objective.<BR>
<BR>
We have two courts at present in South Africa where children give evidence
in a separate play room with a social worker present to represent and assist
the child. The court observes the child on closed circuit TV. Until proved
otherwise we may assume that this procedure is less damaging to the child
and more likely to reveal the truth. Both these objectives are worth fighting
for. The accused's right to defence is in no way diminished by this procedure
and may well be improved by the likelihood that a child will admit to lying
more readily in a non threatening atmosphere..<BR>
<BR>
As tax paying citizens we have the right to insist that child abuse at
the hands of our judicial system ceases and ceases forthwith. As concerned
human beings we have a duty to do so.<BR>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Types of Paedophiles</FONT></B>According to Dr Louise
Olivier from the Human Science Research Council there are several types
of paedophiles: <B><I>DATA OF SOURCE LACKING</I></B><BR>
<BR>
</P>

<OL>
<LI><B>The Fixated Paedophile<BR>
</B>This paedophile never develops a sexual preference for his own age
group. He/she always has a sexual preference to children and will find
it very difficult to lead a normal married life.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>

<LI><B>The Regressed Paedophile<BR>
</B>This paedophile is able to have sexual relationships with children
and adults. The regressed paedophile will most likely have a tendency to
become drug and alcohol abusive.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>

<LI><B>The Sadist<BR>
</B>This is the most dangerous type of paedophile and both the fixated
and regressed can fall into this category. Sadists usually have very little
charm as well as an inadequate personality. However, the manipulative paedophile
is extremely charming.<BR>
</LI>
</OL>

<CENTER><P><BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=+0>CULTURAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO INCEST<BR>
</FONT><I>Academic statements need to be backed up by references and or
rides on the authority of the author - who is the author.<BR>
<BR>
</I></B>One of the main assumptions of students of violence is that violent
behaviour is a learned response.<BR>
<BR>
Social learning theory suggests that continuous reciprocal interaction
between the individual and the environment (i.e.. children and parents,
children and the media, children and schoolmates) provides the basis by
which the consequences of behaviour are learned and thus what behaviour
will be performed.<BR>
<BR>
One of the consequences of sex role socialisation is the social manufacture
of stereotypical sets of expectations concerning the behaviour of boys
and girls. Patriarchal culture and male dominance set the stage for incest
to occur. With a patriarchy, mothers as women, have been taught several
things:<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+0>They should define themselves by the needs, desires and accomplishments
by the men in their lives. Women by have accepted the unconscious ideology
that it is 'natural' to be the psychological, emotional and sexual service
stations for the men.</FONT> <FONT SIZE=+0>When women do not fulfil these
roles for whatever reason, they have been taught to accept blame by everyone.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=+0>The mother is expected to satisfy the needs of the father,
and the needs of her offspring as well. The mother's needs come last. When
the incestuous assault occurs, many mothers faced with the option of protecting
their daughters or safeguarding the basic underpinnings on which their
lives are based, opt for the latter.<BR>
</FONT>Inundated from the moment of birth with societies expectations of
their roles as women generally and mothers specifically, women find that
to function in their daughters best interest in the event of incest, is
to threaten the emotional, physical and financial basis of their existence.
The resultant capacity for mothers to grow hostile towards their daughters
and to lay the blame on the victims in increased, as is their capacity
to deny the assault occurred or will continue to occur. Confused, confined
and controlled, the mothers find their mental health greatly affected.<BR>
<BR>
Men are more likely to have sexual feelings for children because men are
not as well socialised to distinguish between sexual and non-sexual forms
of affection, socialised to become more easily aroused by sexual activities
and fantasies divorced from the context of the relationship in which they
occur; socialised to partners who are smaller, younger and less powerful
than themselves - more childlike - whereas the opposite is true for women.<BR>
</P></CENTER>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="art"></A>Resources for victims of child abuse</H3>

<P>This month's story is unfortunately not about the resources available
to victims and survivors - but rather about the lack of them.<BR>
We asked The House to give us some details of resources for victims of
child abuse for inclusion in this issue of the Childfriend newsletter.
But woe upon woe we were not prepared for what was about to follow.<BR>
<BR>
Marlene McCullogh, one of the full time staff members at The House hosted
us on a tour of the search for facilities. Since The House works with child
abuse cases on a daily basis we could sit in and watch her struggle for
a whole day. She was dealing with a case of a family in need of help. The
three girls, having been sexually abused by their father, needed help to
cope with the trauma of years of deviant sexuality imposed on them (refer
the feature article for the same case but in court) and the mother also
needed help with coping skills - and the father evidently also needed help
albeit of a different kind. The three children were respectively 3, 13,
and 16 years old. <BR>
<BR>
The House first phoned the Department of Child Welfare, who told us they
would have loved to be able to help but did not have facilities for therapy,
and referred us to TMI. Transvaal Memorial Institute could only do an assessment
of the two youngest children if we could wait three months since the waiting
list was so long. Beyond assessment - that is to determine the extent of
the damage done to the children - TMI could not help us with therapy or
counselling. Childline referred us to a vast list of private practitioners
they use as resource. These practitioners are professional psychologists
and social workers in private practice and their fees ranged from R80 to
R350 per session. It would cost the mother (who had lost her breadwinner
husband since exposure of the abuse) on average about R 1 500 per month
to get counselling for her three children and herself. The process of psychoanalysis
and other therapeutic techniques takes as long as two years in most cases
and can amount to R 10 000 per person in consultation fees alone.<BR>
<BR>
Children removed from their parent's because of abuse in the home usually
end up in Government run places of safety - juvenile jails (only two in
Gauteng) - where they await the ordeal of court. This system punishes the
child for exposing abuse in her family.<BR>
<BR>
Given the statistic of 1 in 3 girls and 1 in 6 boys that will be abused
before they reach the age of sixteen (this amounts to hundreds of thousands
of children in South Africa), one would think that the government would
make facilities available for these children. We know that when childhood
sexual abuse goes unchecked and unattended it breeds teenage delinquency
and sexual dysfunction that lasts a lifetime in most cases. If we do not
deal with this issue, for whatever reason, we are simply perpetuating the
problem by entrenching it in society where it breeds violence, abuse, theft
and a multitude of other crimes.<BR>
The House is currently busy working on a programme that hopes to address
this problem in an unconventional way. They are starting a Child Abuse
Counselling Centre that will endeavour to train lay counsellors to help
survivors and victims of child abuse to find healthy coping mechanisms.
The project is in need of YOUR help wharra wharra wharra. <BR>

<I>On Top Of My Voice</I> is a Cyberletter for teenage survivors of child sexual abuse.  This Cyberletter provides children and teenagers with a forum where they may voice and share their feelings in poems, short stories, prose and in letters.  For the abused child, to know that you are not alone; that you are not bad for what you feel; and that you are not crazy for thinking what you think - is one of the first and most necessary steps toward healing and seeking assistance.  This Cyberletter provides them with that therapeutic sharing of feelings.<BR>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="6" FACE="Mistral" COLOR="Navy">Is your child safe?</FONT></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial Narrow" >Any child can be molested, anywhere, at any time. How can children be protected?
</FONT>
<H3><CENTER>Did you know?</CENTER></H3><BR>
IN South Africa it is estimated that one in four girls and one in eight boys are sexually abused before the age of 16.<BR>
<BR>
Most perpetrators have no criminal record. They often nurture their victims over many years.<BR>
<BR>
In 80% of the cases the sexual molester is known to the child or the family. It could be an uncle, aunt, friend, neighbour, parent, etc. Any person, even in a position of authority, can be a potential molester. This includes strangers.<BR><BR>
Lack of knowledge makes innocent children more vulnerable. If we never teach them about and prepare them for situations like these, they think that adults are allowed to do this "because they are adults". Children who have never been taught that they have the right to say NO to anyone, even adults, and who don't know anything about sex and sexuality, are more vulnerable.<BR>
<BR>
<H3><CENTER>How can we protect our children?</CENTER></H3><BR>
It is impossible to give our children total protection. We can, however, prepare and educate them about sexual molesting. Children must be made aware of all the potential things that can happen, so that they know how to react to avoid them. Depending on the age of your child, you can teach him/her step by step about the different dangers to look out for, without taking away his innocence or frightening him. You should always try to be aware of where your child is and what he.she is doing. If your child has been molested, remember: It is not the child's fault.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>How do we teach children?</H3></CENTER><BR>
By using direct and simple language, as well as using the correct names for body parts (start with what the child already knows and build on that). Do not dramatize the situation. Stay calm and present the information in a positive way. We do not whant to frighten or confuse our children.<BR>
<BR>
Through games.<BR>
"What if......" game - where you act out different situations which could occur, e.g. "What if a stranger offers you a lift?"This game helps children anticipate what can happen and plan what action to take in these situations.<BR>
<BR>
Through this game you can talk about possible solutions to the problem and agree on a solution that seems to be the best for your child.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Remember:</B>Try and let your child find answers independently. This teaches her/him to be resourcefull.<BR>
<CENTER><H3>Safe and unsafe touches</H3></CENTER><BR>
Explain that touching which feels bad is unsafe. An unsafe touch is when some one touches them in away or place that makes them feel uncomfortable. This can confuse and frighten them. Safe touches make them feel warm inside.<BR>
<BR>
Teach children that their bodies belong to them and no one can touch or kiss them in any wy that makes them feel uncomfortable. They have the right to say NO, even if the person is someone they love. They have the right ot control what happens to their bodies. You as parents can help your child to recognize his/her own feelings of comfort and discomfort and to trust these feelings.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>Teach your children how to say <B>NO</B></H3></CENTER><BR>
Give your child permission to say NO to adults. It is difficult for a child to say NO to an adult, but he/she must practise saying NO in al loud voice. Every child has the right to say <B>NO!</B><BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>Secrets</H3></CENTER><BR>
Offenders rely on children being willing to keep secrets. Encourage children never to keep secrets. Encourage children never to keep something like this a secret, but to always tell an adult they trust.<BR>
<CENTER><H3>Bribes</H3></CENTER><BR>
Molesters often offer children bribes in exchange for sexual favours, e.g. sweets, gifts, money kittens. Gifts are given freely, but bribes are given to make children do things they do not want to do. This is unsafe.<BR>
<BR>
<H3><CENTER>Children should not define people as good or bad </CENTER></H3><BR>
Do not teach your child that there are bad people and good people. Children seem to think that strangers are "bad" people and people they know, or like, are "good" people;le and won't hurt them.<BR>This is wrong.<BR>
<BR><B>Teach children to think objectively:</B><BR>
Explain that people have good and bad in them and sometimes even good people could do things to them that they don't like.<BR>
Teach them to always say NO to anyone who tries to do something that frightens them.<BR>
<H3><CENTER>Answer children's questions</CENTER></H3>
Children are curios and often ask questions. They hear things on TV or from their friends. Parents should never ignore these questions. It is important to give honest answers to all their questions. Parent do not have to give all the information to the child, which could frighten or confuse him or her, but just enough to answer the question. If you give honest answers, children will trust you and ask questions again. Questions are good. It gives you as a parent the opportunity to convey the correct information to your children.<BR>
<H3><CENTER>Possible danger signals in children</CENTER></H3>
Although these signs so not necessarily indicate that your child has been sexually molested, they will help you as a parent to identify that something is wrong:<BR><ul>
<LI>Suddenly children gave more money and gifts than usual and the source thereof is unknown to you. 
<LI>Uncle or aunt or other person wants to take out only one child all the time.
<LI>Your child takes much longer than usual to get home from school.
<LI>The child's behaviour towards a certain person suddenly changes.
<LI>Child makes strange comments about a certain person.<LI>Personality of the child suddenly changes and he or she clings to you.
<LI>Lack of appetite or sudden increased appetite.
<LI>Child suddenly wants to be isolated and seems withdrawn.
<LI>Lack of concentration.
<LI>Bed wetting.
<LI>Nightmares, can't sleep at night.
<LI>Child has a lot of sexual knowledge for his age.
<LI>Depression, withdrawl, suicide attempts, etc.
<LI>Medical problems such as chronic itching, pain in the genitals, venereal diseases.
<LI>It is also possible that a child may show no outward signs, and hide what is happening from everyone.</UL><BR>
<H3><CENTER>If your child has been molested</CENTER></H3>
It is important to stay calm. You must believe your child. Children don't often lie about being abused.<BR>
<UL><LI>Question them gently.
<LI>Don't  make the child feel guilty. It is not the child's fault.
<LI>Tell the child that you are glad he/she told you, that you are sorry it happend to him/her and that you want to help.</UL><BR>

<CENTER><H3>Get professional help</H3></CENTER>
<UL><LI>SAP <LI>Your local hospital <LI>Local child and family welfare organizations.</UL><BR>
Encourage children to always tell an adult and to keep telling until someone helps them.<BR>
<B>Remember:</B>Teaching children and preparing them is the most important aspect. They will then be prepared to handle and react to situations in a correct and safe way. Children that know prevention techniques and how to look after themselves are the safest children and are less at risk.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Teach your child to: Refuse.........Run........... Report!</B><BR>

<BODY>


<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="Red">Q: What is child abuse?</FONT><BR>
A: Any child who receives non-accidental injury as a result of acts (or omissions) on the part of parents or guardians for which there is no "reasonable" explanation.<UL><LI>Non-accidental physical injury may include severe beatings, burns, strangulation or human bites. How to recognise it: unexplained swellings, bruises,burns,broken bones, cuts and grazes. Children regard adults either with suspicion or aggression, or with draw from them emotionally or become too compliant.<LI>Sexual abuse is the exploitation of a child for the sexual pleasure of an adult: fondling of the genitals, inappropriate remarks concerning a child's private parts, sexual allusions to stimulate or shock a child, exhibitionism, sodomy, rape and incest. Children are often threatened or bribed to participate with an adult in such practices.<BR> How to recognise it : <BR>the child walks or sits uncomfortably; may have itching, pain, bruising and/or blood stains in the genital and anal areas. Emotionally the child resists certain activities, shows a lack of interest in schoolwork, withdrawal, eccentric behavior, fear of men, suicidal tendencies and frequently runs away from home.<LI>Neglect is failure to provide a child with the basic necessities of life: food, clothing, shelter or medical care. <BR>How to recognise it:<BR>the child may steal or beg, or become listless and tired. The child may be dirty and often lacks adequate clothing.<LI>Emotional abuse is abusive behaviour that attacks a child's emotional development and sense of self-worth. Examples include constant criticising, belittling, insulting, rejecting and providing no love, support or guidance.
</UL><BR>

<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="Red">Q: Who are child abusers?</FONT><BR>
A: Child abusers are ordinary people caught in situations that are beyond their control. It is a myth that child abuse is confined to minorities, the poor or those in ghettos. Child abuse cuts across all boundaries of economic level, race, ethnic heritage and religious faith, There are some groups, however, that do seem to be more vulnerable because of the stressful conditions under which they live.<BR>
<BR>

<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="Red">Q: Who are sexual abusers?</FONT><BR>
A: Although parents often caution their children to beware of strangers, sexual abuse occurs mainly in the home. Approximately 97% of abusers are male. Molestation is usually perpetrated by a person familiar to the child - ie a family member or neighbour, friend or acquaintance. Incest is thus more prevalent than molestation by strangers and paedophiles.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="Red">Q: Do abusive parents hate their children?</FONT><BR>
A: No. Most parents love their children, but in times of crisis they strike out at those who are closest.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="Red">Q: Is child abuse a one-off occurrence?</FONT><BR>
A: It is a behaviour pattern that is difficult to break. The longer abuse continues, the more serious the consequences as abuse is also self-perpetuating, ie victims often become abusers when they are adults.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="Red">Q: How extensive is the poblem</FONT><BR>
A: It is impossible to say with any certainty.  It is estimated that in the last year approximately 12 000
children in South Africa were murdered, raped, assaulted or sodomised.  Statistics concerning sexual
molestation are unavailable, but it seems that one out of every three females, and one out of every six
males, suffer some form of sexual molestation occur far more frequently than anybody wishes to believe.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="Red">Q: Why does child abuse take place?</FONT><BR>
A: The 'why' is a complex issue.  Adults are more likely to abuse their children when:<BR>
*  they themselves have been acused as children, are isolated, don't like themselves, are unable to meet
their own needs, are unwilling to seek help, have unrealistic expectations of a child;  and<BR>
*  they experience stress or a crisis and do not know how to cope with it.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="Red">Q: Why does sexual abuse take place?</FONT><BR>
A:  In a paternalistic culture women are viewed as subordinate to men.  Within this social framework men regard women and chidren as their posessions, and see sexual intercourse with them as their right, even against the wishes of the parties involved.  Clearly then, sexual molestation is not only a physical aberration but also a social aberration.  Young boys are exemp from such an attitude and suffer molestation as well.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="Red">Q: What is the greatest obstacle in preventing and treating child abuse?</FONT><BR>
A:  Society.  People don't wish to see, talk about or believe that it happens to ordinary people, every day.  A top priority is creating public awareness and educating, so that more individuals can seek help for themselves.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="Red">Q: How can chidren protect themselves?</FONT><BR>
A:  Parents should build their child's self-confidence, independence and self-control.  Thus the emphasis is more on'feeling safe' than the horror of abuse.  Children need to be taught about:<BR>
YES and NO feelings - the difference between good and bad touches.<BR>
The right to say no to an adult.<BR>
The right to control who touches them an where.<BR>
How to identify dangerous situation.<BR>
Parents/adults should<BR>
LISTEN carefully.<BR>
BELIEVE and take seriously what they say.<BR>
ACT by reporting the incident for investigation.<BR>
Obtain medical attention for the child;  refer him or her to someone who can handle the case professionally.<BR>
SUPPORT the child and<BR>
INVOLVE him or her in ALL decisions.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="Red">Q: Does jailing the  abusive parent help solve the problem?</FONT><BR>
A:  No.  Jail does not help the parent deal with stress or to work through personal problems, although sometimes the threat of imprisonment may motivate parents to change, particularly in sexual abuse cases.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="Red">Q: Can abusive parents learn to cope with their problems?</FONT><BR>
A:  Yes.  In most cases, behaviour can be changed with the right support and treatment.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="Red">Q: How are cases of child abuse identified?</FONT><BR>
A:  Next-door neighbours, relatives, friends and professionals report it if they suspect a child is being abused, or is in danger of being abused.  Sometimes parents call for help.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="Red">Q: Who may report a suspected case of child abuse?</FONT><BR>
A:  Anybody (it is a legal requirement).<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="Red">Q: How sure must a person be before reporting a suspected case of child abuse?</FONT><BR>
A: There is no fixed rule.  If there is any question, resolve the doubt in favour of the child and report.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="Red">Q: Do people who are reporting a suspected case have to identify themselves?</FONT><BR>
A: No.  But it is better if they do.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="Red">Q: Does a person who report a suspected case have any legal protection?</FONT><BR>
A: Yes, persons who report a suspected case of childe abuse in good faith are granted immunity from civil or criminal liability.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="Red">Q: What is good gaith?</FONT><BR>
A: It is an honest belief that a child has been or is in danger of being abused.<BR>

<B>Parents of teenagers are often anxious to know how to detect whether their children are using drugs.  In the current climate of growing public awareness about drug abuse, many parents have recognized that &quot;forewarned is forearmed&quot;.  However, it is important to remember that the majority of teenagers (4 out of 5) who are exposed to drugs do not use them.  Most of those who do, experiment briefly and then give them up.<BR>
Some teenager, nevertheless, continue to experiment and  begin to use drugs regularly.  Initially they may bluff themselves and others that there is no problem, but as time goes on, more serious difficulties inevitably develop.  At this point they need help.<BR>
Parents play a vital role in detecting the drug problem, and in helping the teenager to accept the need for professional assistance.  It is therefore important for them to know the signs that could point to drug abuse.<BR>
At the same time parents must understand that most adolescents have stormy periods during their teens - this is normal.  There are many causes for periods of moodiness, withdrawal, irritability and the other signs mentioned below.  Physical ill-health, emotional upset and drug abuse are among them.  Your general practitioner is the best person to assess the teenager in these circumstances and to advise you.
</B>
<hr align="center" size="3" width="450">
<BR>

<P><B>Possible signs of abuse </B><BR>
If you are worried about your child
abusing drugs, the following signs
may assist you:<BR>
<UL><LI>  <B>Change in behaviour from a
previous well-know pattern</B> e.g<BR>
being away from home at odd hours
or unusual periods, without
explanation; long periods of
isolation of withdrawal; unexplained
moodiness, irritability,
nervousness or episodes of
giggling; persistent daydreaming.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Changes in functioning</B><BR> e.g. drop off in
 school performance; loss of interest in
 sports and hobbies; evasiveness about  friends (who they are, where they go,  what they do); over-spending or &quot;lost&quot; money that cannot be accounted for. <BR><BR><LI><B>Episodes of intoxication</B><BR> - with  slurred speech, restlessness, staggering gait, inability to<BR>
communicate clearly, dreaminess, poor concentration and sometimes abnormal things that are not really 
there.<BR><BR>
<LI><B>Discovery of pills or suspicious substances.</B> <BR><BR><LI><B>Disappearance of drugs from the family drug
cupboard</B><BR> especially tranquillizers, sleeping tablets, appetite suppressants <BR><BR><LI><B>Specific signs from specific drugs:</B><BR>
Dagga (Cannabis) - Bloodshot eyes
(sometimes), unusual finger of palm
stains; giggling episodes; unusual
hunger (especially for sweet foods)
or thirst; dreaminess; a smell similar
to burning weeds in your child's room
or on his clothes.<BR><BR>
<LI><B>Stimulants</B><BR> (e.g. slimming tablets)
&quot;Getting high&quot;, with alternating
periods of elation and depression;
insomnia; loss of appetite; weight loss.<BR><BR>
<LI><B>Sedatives</B> <BR>(sleeping tablets, tranquillizers,
some pain killers and cough medicines).
Drowsiness; excessive sleep; un co-
ordinated movements; poor concentration;
appearing drunk without having taken
alcohol' loss of inhibition. Empty bottles

<LI><B>Inhalants </B><BR>(e.g. glue, paint thinners, nail
varnish remover, aerosol sprays, petrol).
Slurred speech, confusion, unusual aggression
and irritability, hallucinations and staggering
gait.  This is an especially dangerous form of
drug abuse as brain damage may occur.
Unusual quantities of these substances may 
be found.<BR><BR>
<LI><B>Hallucinogenic drug</B><BR> (e.g. LSD).
Very abnormal behaviour e.g.
confusion, excitement, restlessness,
hallucinations, talking to himself/
herself, rambling speech. The person
may believe that he is suddenly being
persecuted by others; &quot;flashbacks&quot; 
(sudden unexplained periods of
abnormal emotion, perceptions or
behaviour, especially with a feeling 
of altered reality and panic).<BR><BR></UL>
<B>Remember:</B><BR><UL>
<LI>All the phenomena mentioned
above can have other, and
sometimes more serious  causes.
Consult your general practitioner
for advice; don't overreact.<BR>
<LI>Not all the signs may be present at 
one time.<BR>
<LI>Rapidly changing moods,
unexplained behaviour may occur
with any form of drug use.<BR>
<LI>One must expect the adolescent to
initially deny or be evasive about
drug abuse.<BR><BR></UL>
<P><B>If you suspect your child is
abusing drugs:<BR>
DO</B><BR><ul>
<LI>Obtain reliable information about
drugs and know the facts.<BR>
<LI>Involve yourself and your spouse in
your child's life; get to know their 
friends, interests and movements;
get talking.<BR>

<LI>Become aware of your child's 
problem areas. Be respectful of 
them and be a good listener.
<BR>
<li>Let alcohol and drugs be a topic of
discussion, like any other topic. Ask
for your child's feeling on the subject,
be open to differences of opinion
and suggest you might both need
to learn more.<BR>
<LI>Ask simple, direct questions e.g. &quot;Are you smoking dagga?&quot; &quot;Are you 
drinking alcohol?&quot; &quot;Are you using  
any other drugs which a doctor did 
not per scribe?&quot; If the answer is 
&quot;No&quot;, but you still suspect drug 
involvement, keep involved and 
remain in touch with your child's 
friend, activities and environment.
Keep the bridges open.<BR>
<LI><P>Consult professional assistance if
you need help to handle the situation.</P></UL>
<P><B>DON'T</B><BR><UL>
<LI>Make blunt or angry accusation.<BR>
<LI>Be moralistic of judgmental.<BR>
<LI>Let thins slide.<BR>
<LI>Back down if your child resists your<BR>
attempts to get more involved in his <BR>
or her life.<BR></UL>
<BR>
<B>If you discover that your child is
definitely taking drugs:</B><BR><UL><LI>
<LI>Have all the evidence at your fingertips.<BR>
<LI>Take a balanced, calm view. Avoid 
over reaction of tearful recriminations.<BR>
<LI>Obtain as much information as is possible
from your child about the extent, duration
and circumstances of the drug abuse.<BR>
<LI>If your child readily accepts help to handle 
the drug problem, offer all the support
you can arrange for the appropriate
professional assistance.<BR>
<LI>Parents must stand together at this time. 
Avoid unearthing longstanding disagreements
between spouses; mutual support is what
is most needed.<BR>
<LI>Take a clear, strong position that drug abuse
is unacceptable and know the reasons why.
Point out to your child the effect of drugs
on his or her behaviour and mood.<BR>
<LI>Insist on a discussion with an expert, to
clarify knowledge and attitudes. You and 
your spouse should be willing to be 
involved in any treatment recommended.<BR>
This does not mean that you are to blame.<BR>
<LI>Re-negotiate &quot;house-rule&quot; e.g. time home
at night, homework, friends, etc. Be firm,
consistent and willing to set limits. Mean
business.<BR>
<LI>Equally important, give praise when it is
due.  Recognize achievements, helpfulness,
improve behaviour and evidence of a greater
sense of responsibility.<BR>
<LI>Your goal should be to put a permanent
stop to your child's drug abuse.This will 
require frank discussion within the family,
and members.<BR>
<LI>Be aware that a confrontation may develop
and unpleasantness may ensue. Do not back
down, but see it through.  Many young people 
only get into treatment after a confrontation.
(In extreme cases, legal means may be required).</UL><BR>
<BR>
As parents, you have a vital role to play.  Two American drug experts have said: &quot;When you come up against drugs, most important is the knowledge that you can indeed do something. You can almost always turn your children away from drugs. And if you do not - who else will?&quot;<BR>

<P><B>It has become a cliche to say that we are a drug-using and frequently a drug-abusing society. Often, when discussing drug abuse among young people, we think in terms of cure rather than prevention.  So we have parents asking how they will know if their children are abusing drugs rather than learning how to prevent the problem in the first place.</B></P>
<P><B>Know your child</B><BR>
Studies have shown that young drug abusers have certain common characteristics. Some of these are:<BR>
Difficulties in expressing their feelings;<BR>
Inability to recognise problems or to deal with them;<BR>
Values that are vague;<BR>
Low self-esteem often masked by rebellious, &quot;big deal&quot; behaviour;<BR>
Parents who use &quot;socially acceptable&quot; drugs such as tranquillisers and alcohol;<BR>
A history of delinquent or anti-social behaviour.</P>
<P>If we look closely at these characteristics, we can formulate certain guidelines which enable us to help children to avoid drugs and to understand themselves.<BR>
Such guidelines, when followed by parents, can help the child to communicate, to deal with problems in terms of a clear set of values and to have high self-esteem. Such a person is less likely to need or to use drugs. As parents, you have an important part to play in creating stable and secure young people who can survive in our drug-using world.</P>
<P><B>What parents can do</B><BR>
Although prevention is the most desirable goal, it is not always easy to achieve. Here are some guidelines which you may find helpful:<BR>
As with other potentially sensitive  issues, try to let drug and alcohol use  and abuse be a topic of family discussion. Encourage your child to tell you if he or 
she is being influenced to experiment with any drug. Examine your family relationships. If you 
recognise stresses and strains which do not go away, or problems of poor  communication, seek to rectify them early, making use of professional help if necessary Keep interested and in touch with your child,
especially throughout the years of his or her
adolescence. Be respectful about their 
problems and learn to listen. 
Examine your own behaviour; are you 
unwittingly setting a bad example? Check your
(and your spouse's) drinking habits, smoking,
pill-taking and even coffee drinking! Remember
that children start learning from you at an early 
age. Adolescents are especially sensitive to the 
&quot;double standard&quot;.<BR>
Research has shown that teachers have a potent
influence on the developing child. Encourage your
PTA to approach the school to provide appropriate
drug education.</P>
<P><B>Ten Aids to teenage Maturity</B><BR>
<B>1. Promote and set an example in the healthy use of leisure:</B><BR>

has been said</UL><BR>
<B>6. Show appreciation:</B><BR>
say &quot;thank-you&quot; when a job is done
acknowledge the efforts that fail
take nothing for granted
give praise when it is due<BR>
<B>7. Help them to say &quot;no&quot;:</B><BR>
say it yourself when you need to 
show that it works
let them practice how to say it
show your confidence in them<BR>
<B>8. Help them to formulate values:</B><BR>
state clearly the things that you value
back up your statements with action
be prepared to discuss their values
consider what these values imply<BR>
<B>9. Show that you care:</B><BR>
set limits<BR>
be consistent<BR>
give a smile, a hug or a comment<BR>
listen<BR>
<B>10. Show respect:</B><BR>
<li>don't blame them and shame them
<li>don't pray: respect privacy
<li>expect self-reliance
<li>hold them responsible</ul><BR>
<BR>
If you feel inadequate, share this with other parents, or of necessary seek counselling in this area. It is time an energy well invested.</P>
<P><B>A fairy tale</B><BR>
Once upon a time, a price was born. As befits a future king, he was the centre of attraction. There were many people waiting on him, eager to attend to his every whim - even in the middle of the night. If he seemed out of sorts, they would try to make him smile, and when he rewarded them with a chuckle, the would almost burst with pride.<BR>
As he grew older, he developed into a real Prince Charming. Apart form a few mishaps, which were only to be expected, he remained everyone's pride and joy - helpful (especially with tasks which were really beyond his youthful capability), cheerful and friendly.<BR>
Then, when he was about thirteen years of age, a disconcerting change occurred. Judging by his behaviour, it appeared for all the world as if he had turned into a toad. His voice, which had been sweet and clear, began to croak, and his behaviour seemed to deteriorate alarmingly. No longer easy-going and sociable, he was often moody and showed a distinct inclination towards disowning those closest to him - except, of course, when he needed a favour. Painfully aware of his toad-like characteristics - his croaky voice and the wart-like acne on his face - he began to mix exclusively with other froggy creatures.<BR>
During this trying time, the toads discovered a magic potion that helped them to feel, albeit only temporarily, like princes - suave, witty and totally irresistible to the opposite sex.<BR>
Tragically, some of these toads began using more and more of this potion and other like it in an effort to deal with the afflictions of toadism. Others, who were better prepared for this awkward period, realised that magic potions don't exist, and learned to cope with their feelings and problems in natural, non-chemical ways.<BR>
Because the members of the former group had not learned this lesson, they tended to remain in their toad-like state, The other gradually began to shed their froggy characteristics and slowly regained their noble traits. It is important to understand that they did not achieve this all alone - they were helped towards maturity. Who helped them? The same people who loved and tended them in the days before the onset of toadism and who consistently believed in their ability to emerge with dignity from this uncomfortable phase of their lives.<BR>
So take heart if your princes or princesses begin to turn to toads. With the strategy we have suggested and your guidance and support, there is every chance that your teenagers will grow into young adults who will make you truly proud.</P><BR>

In cities all over South Africa, children as young as I 0 and 12 are being forced into a life of sexual slavery. In some cases, they are being used by as many as I 0 men a week. While police and social services remain overburdened and understaffed, the men who abuse these children simply walk away. <BR><CENTER>MARIANNE THAMM investigates.</CENTER><BR>

<CENTER><H2>NOBODY'S CHILDREN</H2></CENTER>
'Rooms for boarders, come and be spoilt' read  the business  card
that a nervous girl thrust into Inspector Glen  Smith's hand  one
Tuesday  evening in  February while  he was  strolling through  a
shopping mall near Durban's beach front.  In his  five-and-a-half
years with the Durban Child Protection Unit (CPU), Glen developed
a  keen  instinct  for  the nuances  and language  of the  grubby
underworld  of  drugs and  prostitution that  flourishes in  that
city's central business district. He thumbed the card and put  it
in his pocket. Something about it bothered him. 'The words  "come
and be spoilt" nagged me. I was certain that it  was a  euphemism
for something to do with children,' he recalls.<BR>
<br>

After  two restless  nights, Glen  set up  a dawn  raid with  his
partner,  Tanya  Smal,  on the  address listed  on the  card -  a
third-floor  flat on  Point Road,  Durban's unofficial  red-light
district. The  entrance was  barred by  an intercom  and a  steel
door. A woman buzzed them in and by the time  anyone realised  it
was a police raid, there was nowhere  to hide.  Inside the  flat,
three  12-year-old  girls  were  found sleeping  on double  beds.
Clearly exhausted, they'd flopped down and  fallen asleep,  still
wearing the clothes and garish make-up of the night before. <BR>
<BR>
There were other people in the  brothel -  two Japanese  sailors,
three  suspected adult  prostitutes and  the 49-year-old  alleged
'madam', who wore the keys to  the flat  and security  door on  a
thick length of string around her neck. She was arrested and  the
children were handed over to social workers.  The girls told Glen
that they were runaways and all three said they'd  been lured  to
the  flat  by older  girls who  approached them  while they  were
wandering around the Wheel Shopping Centre. After  opening a  few
years ago, the Wheel soon succumbed to the encroachment the gaudy
casinos,  escort  agencies  and  fast-food   outlets  that   have
mushroomed in Durban's CBD.  It provides a safe  space for  pimps
to comb the crowds and look for  the telltale  signs of  recently
arrived  runaway.  On  a  Thursday afternoon  I saw  a number  of
children, many of them dressed in school uniforms, roaming around
the multi-tiered mall.  The minute a child hits  the street,  the
pimps are out there. They chat up the kids and ask  them if  they
want to go home with them to watch videos, Glen explains.
<BR><BR>
Once in the Point Road flat, the girls told Glen, they were  held
captive and forced to have sex with a variety of men - 'liquorice
allsorts', as they described them.  Rebecca (not  her real  name)
said she'd had sex with about 30 clients in three weeks and  that
the 'madam' had charged R120 to R200 per girl. 'The first night I
was crying a lot and the man lust left. But the next night,  when
another man told me to take off my clothes, I  did, because  they
told me the police would come after me. If we didn't  do what  we
were told, they (the madam and others in the  brothel) would  hit
us.'<BR>

<BR>
A few months after  the Point  Road raid,  two young  journalists
with Durban's Daily News,  Clinton Nagoor  and Marvin  Meintjies,
decided  to follow  up reports  that another  child-sex ring  was
operating in the city.  <BR>
<BR>


It didn't take them long to locate the six-storey Art Deco  block
on Gillespie Street. It was even easier  to find  out which  door
they needed to knock on to have sex  with young  girls. A  brawny
security guard obliged with the flat number,  signed their  names
in  the  register  in the  foyer and  sent them  up. Their  first
attempt unravelled when they started haggling with the madam  and
one child stormed out. A week later they returned, this time with
R800 in company  cash and  a photographer  positioned across  the
street.<BR>
<BR>
  
Inside, they were welcomed  by the  same woman  (known as  Rhada)
who'd been arrested in the February raid  on Point  Road. In  the
next room, 'finishing off' a burly client, was Rebecca, the  same
12-year-old girl from the  previous brothel.  The madam  promised
the journalists that the child 'would have a  good shower  before
she comes to you' and offered them a  second 12-year-old,  Cathy,
who turned out to be from the Point Road brothel as well. When he
saw Rebecca for the first time, says  Marvin, 'I  was shocked  at
how small she was, how frail she looked compared to  the man  who
sat next to her on the couch. She looked about eight  and he  was
huge.'  <BR>
<BR>


It cost Clinton and Marvin R400  for each  of the  two girls  and
after paying Rhada, they left with them and went to a  time-share
flat  elsewhere  in  the  city.  Interviewing   the  girls,   the
journalists were shocked at how matter-of-fact  they appeared  to
he  about  their  fate,  although  their  vulnerability  surfaced
through the veneer  every now  and again.  'It's crazy,'  Rebecca
said when asked about her clients, 'Old men come for young  women
like us. Sometimes I just want  to walk  out of  this, but  Rhada
stops me. I squeal and sometimes she has to take them, she added,
indicating Cathy. 'Me, I'm a very fussed-up things'<BR>
<BR>


The  reporters  asked  whether  they  enjoyed   the  work.   'Not
actually,' Rebecca replied. 'I cry half the time.'<BR>
<BR>
 

During the course of the evening,  said Clinton  and Marvin,  the
girls admitted to spending their earnings, up to R500  a day,  on
sweets, clothes and videos. Both said they were runaways and that
their parents knew where they were but not what they
were doing. Cathy said she'd been introduced to 'the business' by
her sister who  was now  20 and  living with  her boyfriend.  Her
sister had worked in the same 'joint' but she had a baby now  and
had given up prostitution. <BR>
<BR>


Rebecca told the journalists that she'd left home because of  her
father's  drinking and  because it  was boring  there. But,  says
Inspector Tanya Smal, who previously took a  statement from  her,
Rebecca had been sexually abused  by her  grandfather, which  was
the real reason she fled.<BR>
<BR>


A day after the story' appeared in the Daily News, the Durban CPU
raided the Gillespie Street flat.  Again Rhada  was arrested  and
again the girls where removed to places of safety.  <BR>
<BR>


It was obvious that  the swoop  was precipitated  by Clinton  and
Marvin's front-page  story. But  everyone knew  that the  vicious
cycle would start again within days. The madam would probably get
bail. If she  didn't, one  of her  cohorts would  set up  another
brothel elsewhere. The  girls would  probably run  away from  the
places of safety and end up in a brothel again. And still the men
who regularly abuse these children will  continue to  do so  with
impunity.<BR>
<BR>


Inspector Glen Smith is no longer with the Child Protection Unit.
In April he requested a transfer, saying that he was fed up  with
working with limited resources and that the  wretchedness of  the
growing  number  of  cases of  child abuse  and prostitution  was
'desensitising' him.  'I'm tired of seeing children being hurt so
much,'  he laments.  'It's getting  worse and  we're fighting  an
endless  battle.  Our  social  system  can't  cope:  there is  no
follow-up and no hope.'<BR>

Glen has  a reputation  as a  hard-working cop.  As we  sit in  a
coffee  shop  in one  of the  beach-front hotels,  he points  out
several  known  prostitutes  as they  stroll past.  Glen has  the
weariness and the savvy of a man who has immersed himself in  the
criminal underworld and  has witnessed  the worst  side of  human
nature.  'It's  so sad.  Mostly, these  kids are  on the  streets
because of bad patents,' he explains 'We know they're not  street
kids.  They  need  someone  to  look after  them. But  what am  I
supposed to do with them  before the  pimps come  out? Take  them
home?! I can tell you, after three in the afternoon  I can't  get
hold of a social worker in this town.  And  if I  do, there's  no
follow-up. It's pointless,' he says.<BR>

Besides, he adds, the children are not the problem, their parents
are, and so are the men who  seek out  child prostitutes.  'Don't
punish the kids. There should be a place where the perpetrator or
the abusive parent can go for help - not a jail,  but some  other
place where they can get counselling.'<BR>
<BR>

Glen  Smith's  disillusionment  is  echoed by  other CPU  members
throughout the country'. In Hillbrow, Cape Town and Pretoria more
and more boys and girls  are being  drawn into  these sex  rings.
Some  work  openly  from  street  corners while  others are  held
captive in heavily secured brothels, and  business, according  to
the police, is brisk. In each city it's the same  old story  over
and over again. Without adequate resources and an effective legal
and social back-up system police aren't even able  to affect  the
most elementary damage control.<BR>
<BR>

Superintendent Craig Boucher, head of the Point Road police
station, which is located in the heart of Durban's red light
district and one of the busiest stations in the province, agrees.
He believes the only solution is legal reform, backed up by an
efficient social system that caters specifically for these
children. 'We must have some form of quick justice in these
cases. It sometimes takes months for a case to get to court and
in the meantime the accused gets out on bail and the children run
away from places of safety. As it is we don't have enough of
those - and they're full of juvenile offenders,' he adds.
Returning these children to their parents is not an option and
according to Joan van Niekerk, director of Childline in Durban,
they're also unwelcome at places of safety, where they're
perceived to have a 'destabilising effect' on others. <BR>
<BR>


Sometimes places of safety present a threat of their own, instead
of the succour these children so desperately need. There is
evidence, both here and overseas, that some child molesters
gravitate towards the kind of work where they will have easy
access to children and can continue their abuse undetected. A
recent example is the arrest of a staff member at the Rosendal
Place of Safety in Cape Town for the alleged indecent assault of
two 15-year-old girls. The man is also  alleged to have
encouraged six boys to sexually molest four girls at the
institution. According to Cape MEC for Health and Social Services
Ebrahim Rasool, the Investigation was hampered by a high level of
intimidation at the facility.<BR>
<BR>


It's no wonder that these girls, rejected by their families and
the social system, keep returning to brothels where they are
forced to sacrifice their childhood in return for what should be
their basic right to shelter and food.<BR>
<BR>
 

Says Craig Boucher, 'Ironically. the madams offer them the
security they never got from their parents. In sonic cases the
parents even sell their children into this type of slavery.
Besides, people don't seem to care anymore; we've become
hardened.' He adds, 'Go out at night in any city and see how many
children are roaming the streets. alone or clustered in game
arcades. We can't fight this if society doesn't care.'<BR>
<BR>


And he's right. The number of dead-faced girls who walk the
pavement of a well-known Cape Town pick-up area has doubled in
the past few months. It's hard to miss them hovering near the
busy stretch of road late at night. Police say they only arrest
the girls if they receive a complaint from the public.<BR>
<BR>
 

'We pick them up and the next night they're back. There's nowhere
we can take them and we can't just lock them up,' one police
officer said.<BR>
<BR>


Shane Petzer, of the Cape-based Sex Workers' Education and
Advocacy Taskforce (Sweat), says the girls are completely
unreceptive to the Sweat field workers who regularly pound the
pavements, talking to sex workers about health and legal
issues.<BR>
<BR>


'They appear to be controlled by gangs,' says Shane. 'They are
probably in debt and "owned" by the gangs.'<BR>
<BR>


In the Western Cape, there is evidence that poverty drives
schoolgirls to prostitution: in one sample area, 113 babies were
born in 12 months to teenage mothers who had sold their bodies
for food, clothing, toiletries and money. 'There seems to be no
understanding of the concept of statutory rape,' says one source
who works in the field and asks not to be identified.<BR>
<BR>


Another disturbing trend that has been identified in that
province are the 'taxi queens', as they've become known. These
are kids as young as 13 who got the nickname from the practice of
riding along in the front seats of taxis with a driver who acts
as their pimp.<BR>
<BR>


The situation in Johannesburg mirrors that of Durban, where some
of the children arc held captive in brothels rather than
operating on the streets. Many of the children on Johannesburg's
streets are from townships or rural areas and have been sent to
the city to look for relatives. And the pimps know an easy target
when they see one.<BR>
<BR>


<I><B>A VICIOUS CYCLE</B><BR>
It was only after the death of her father a few years ago that
Gauteng-born  Elinor van Jaarsveld* was able to talk about how he
had abused and prostituted her for years. Now 34 and pregnant
with her second child, Elinor has finally managed to escape the
vicious cycle of abuse and prostitution that dominated her.<BR>


The abuse stated when Elinor, the youngest of five children, was
six years old. 'My father had sex with me three times a week,'
she says. 'No-one else in my family knew about this and I didn't
speak to anyone.' When she was 12, he started prostituting her to
his friends. Her schoolwork suffered and she dropped out at the
age of 16. A short while later she married one of her father's
clients, who continued to prostitute her. 'He was a violent man
who battered me. Once he pushed me down a flight of stairs when I
was seven months pregnant. The baby was born, but they took It
away from me.'<BR>


When her father died, Elinor finally felt free to tell her
family. But refusing to believe her, they had her committed to a
mental Institution for two years.<BR>


After her release into a minimal-care community home, she met her
current husband. He too turned out to be violent and abusive but
Elinor, with the help of counsellors at Nicro and the Incest
Survivors Support Centre, has managed to extricate herself from
the situation. 'At last I know that my body Is my own,' she says.
<CENTER>*Elinor chase not to use her real name far this
story.</CENTER></I><BR>
<BR>


Inspector Edward Hutchings of the Johannesburg CPU highlights
another problem  - the myth that sex with a child or young girl
will prevent or even cure Aids. 'We know that more and more men
want to use children because they think that they won't get Aids
that way,' he says. The latest available statistics in
KwaZulu-Natal are particularly alarming: over 200 children
between the ages of 4 and 14 were diagnosed as being HIV-positive
in December 1995. And, adds Childline's Joan van Niekerk, the
numbers are steadily rising.<BR>
<BR>


One of the biggest headaches for police is the difficulty of
obtaining enough evidence to bring a case to court. Also, getting
a successful conviction demands sophisticated detective work and
many hours of surveillance. Craig Boucher no longer wastes time
sending his men out in pursuit of adult sex workers. And on the
rare occasions when a client gets caught with his pants down, he
coughs up the admission-of-guilt fine and walks away.<BR>
<BR>



Shockingly, South African law offers an excuse to men who have
sex with underaged girls. According to Section 14 (2a and C) of
the Sexual Offences Act of 1957, they can offer the defence 'that
the girl at the time of the commission of the offence, was a
prostitute' or 'that the girl or person in whose charge she was,
deceived the person so charged into believing that she was over
the age of 16'. Craig explains, 'Men can get away with it if they
use that defence in court.'<BR>
<BR>


Catching and charging men who abuse prostituted children is
exceptionally difficult, says Anneke Pienaar, National Director
of the CPU. 'How do we prove it?' she asks. 'We can't risk
placing decoys on the streets. If an adult does pick up a child
we have to follow him and catch him in the act.'<BR>
<BR>


Glen Smith adds that local child-sex rings are difficult to crack
because, unlike in Thailand, where children are openly sold on
the street, the operations here are run very discreetly.<BR>
<BR>


'You have to know the right people in this game and that can take
months. And we can't spend that much time on one case when we
also have to deal with all the other crimes that are being
committed against children.' He hints that some of his colleagues
may be benefiting from the industry but says that he can't prove
anything. How else, he asks, has Rhada been able to operate for
more than 10 years? Police complicity in criminal activity is a
common problem in countries where they are poorly paid and work
in unfavourable conditions. Exposing a rotten cop ensnared in a
rotten industry is precarious and can be life-threatening. The
whole system, says Glen, needs a serious overhaul.<BR>
<BR>


From this bleak perspective it's easy to  understand the  despair
and inertia that surrounds the sexual exploitation of children in
this country and elsewhere in  the world.  But the  good news  is
that the tide is slowly turning.<BR>
<BR>


Growing  global  awareness  of  the  extent  of  the problem  has
galvanised  NGOs,  governments and  lobby groups,  and the  first
World  Congress  Against  the Commercial  Sexual Exploitation  of
Children will take place in Sweden this month.  The congress  was
initiated  by  the international  NGO End  Child Prostitution  in
Asian  Tourism (ECPAT)  and is  co-hosted by  the United  Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF), among others.  Several South  Africans,
representing NGOs, the police and government departments, will be
attending.<BR>
<BR>


One of the main focal points for delegates at  the congress  will
be the urgent need for a worldwide  shift in  public, police  and
judicial attitudes towards prostitution, so that prostitute users
(exploiters) and not the prostituted children become the focus of
policing.<BR>
<BR>


'For them to feel squeezed by the  law it's  imperative that  the
focus of law enforcement shifts dramatically. In virtually  every
part  of the  world today,  prostitutes, not  their clients,  arc
actively policed. Young girls are  routinely harassed,  arrested,
tried and imprisoned  or otherwise  punished by  criminal-justice
systems, while their adult male abusers walk free,' reads one  of
the theme papers.<BR>
<BR>


This argument is supported by Joan van Niekerk  of Childline  and
many others who feel that penalties for sex with minors should be
severe: 'If it were made so risky for men to have sex with minors
that  they  wouldn't  be prepared  to take  the chance.  Children
wouldn't he sucked into this behaviour.'<BR>
<BR>


Another  possible   solution  that   will  he   debated  is   the
legalisation of the sex industry. This is a position supported by
the  Minister of  Welfare. Geraldine  Fraser-Moleketi, who  feels
that 
opening up the adult sex industry  would subject  it to  scrutiny
and  control,  and  help  eradicate  the  violent  and  dangerous
underworld that flourishes in its criminalised state.<BR>
<BR>


The minister says that the Department of  Welfare has  identified
the prostitution of children as a growing problem  that needs  to
he addressed urgently and adds that it is currently developing  a
national plan of action.<BR>
<BR>


Punishing  the  perpetrators  would  be  an effective,  immediate
solution  but,  experts  at the  conference will  point out,  the
problem  is more  complex than  that. Poverty,  the expansion  of
global market forces, a growing materialism and deeply entrenched
cultural attitudes that  women and  girls have  a 'lower'  social
value than men all contribute to  this gross  violation of  these
children's rights.<BR>

Each year, more than a million children worldwide are forced into
prostitution and the problem here, as elsewhere, will not  simply
go away. What we need are new ideas and methods of combating  the
problem  and commitment  by the  government to  eradicate it.  We
cannot call ourselves a truly democratic nation until we have the
means  to  protect the  rights of  children such  as Rebecca  and
Cathy, who are the most vulnerable members of our society.<BR>

<I><B>PROFILE OF AN ABUSER</B><BR>
Who are the men who use child prostitutes and why do they do it? 
At present there is no profile of the South African abuser, but a
study conducted by Dr Julia O'Connell Davidson of the  University
of Leicester offers some insights.   Hebephiles are  men who  are
interested in young-looking teenagers but will settle for a child
if  she  is  all  they  can  gain  access  to.   Preferential  or
situational sexual abusers of children  are men  who are  regular
prostitute users and become child abusers  through their  contact
with adult prostitutes. The men  who exploit  children (the  vast
majority are girls) believe that women  and children  voluntarily
prostitute themselves and that men cannot help  or control  their
sexual impulses. They also believe male sexual desire is a 'need'
rather  than  a  'want'  and  that  men  are  entitled to  sexual
release.</I><BR>
<BR>
  

The  study  sample  displayed  a  distorted  perception that  the
children were in some way responsible for their own abuse and not
harmed by sexual contact with adults. They  also justified  their
actions by believing that the children invited their own abuse or
actively chose prostitution as a way of life.<BR>

<P><B>Street</B> -<I> refers to the sub-culture, and in particular to the
ideologies, of the drug and vice antisociety presented in the area.<BR>
</I><B>On the street</B> - <I>Refers to life and general day-to-day survival
on the Street. For male children this life is typically (and generally)
marked by glue sniffing, living in small self-contained communes literally
on street pavements and making a living by begging and petty theft. For
the female child this life is generally and typically depicted by residing
in brothels and residential hotels, prostitution and expensive drug abuse,
and sometimes involvement of a pimp.<BR>
</I><B>Child </B>- <I>A person younger than 19 years. The House however
makes a distinction between what is referred to as, &quot;new child prostitutes&quot;,
indicating children under the age of 19 who are living on the streets and
prostituting and, &quot;old child prostitutes&quot;, indicating persons
older than 19 years but under the age of 25 years who started living on
the streets and prostituting when they were still children. These 'old
child prostitutes' are generally emotionally very young and are inadequately
equipped with regard to life skills and academic training. The House endeavours
to provide these 'old child prostitutes' with resources, aiming at their
eventual reintegration with society, however in a different programme than
the children.</I> </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR>
Some children run away from their homes for various reasons, from all areas
of the country and end up in the inner city where they attempt to make
'a better life' for themselves. We know from extensive South African research,
what it is that happens to male children who lead a life on the streets.
We also learn from these sources that nationally more than 10 000 such
boys are in need of intervention. (Schurink W, et al; Street Children,
HSRC, 1993 and Schurink E; Street Children Quo Vadis?, HSRC, 1994). Until
THE HOUSE was started in Johannesburg (1990), and started publishing details
of the nature of its work, many specialists in the field only wondered
at the reason why it was that only male street children are visible on
the streets. </P>

<P>The House understands that female 'street children' are not as visible
since they get drawn into the systems of prostitution and illicit drug
addiction very soon after arriving in the city. These children live in
hotel rooms. They apply their trade on the street (<I>beat</I>) and in
brothels, in strip-tease bars as topless waitresses, and in escort agencies.
These children do not sniff glue as their male counterparts do, but are
rather crack cocaine and intravenous opiate addicts and spend an average
of R8 000 ($US 1 600) per month feeding their dependancy. Many of these
girls are 'managed' by pimps who effectively ensnare them and make a helper's
access to them almost impossible. </P>

<P>It is known that about 70% of children reported to the South African
Police's Child Protection Unit, as missing or as absconders, are female
children. Research observation however shows only the 10 000 male children
to be visible and to be accounted for in surveys, but to date there is
no empirical estimate of the amount of girl children living this street
life. We can only guess that the figure must be much higher than that for
male children. </P>

<P>In view of the now well accepted fact that the South African Police
Services, Dept. Welfare and the powers that be have proved themselves totally
impotent in arresting the escalating incidence of girls falling into the
snares of child prostitution, THE HOUSE continues to pursue the task of
retrieving these children. We furthermore estimate that the pending legalisation/decriminalisation
of prostitution will add to the measures of this already unmanageable problem.
</P>

<P>Retrieval of these 'invisible' children is much more complicated than
in the case of boys, and involves intricate retrieval mechanisms and specialised
therapeutic needs. </P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>DISCUSSION OF THE PERCEIVED NEEDS</H3>

<P>When one enquires from these children as to the needs they perceive,
one naturally solicits answers that reflect their need for day-to-day survival
on the streets and little is said about reintegration with normative society.
Answers such as: '<I>stop police harassment</I>', '<I>provide methadone
centres</I>', '<I>catch the killers and the rapists</I>', prevail. Those
who express needs such as, '<I>...please send me to school</I>', or '<I>please
help me find a flat (apartment) and a job</I>', are usually older than
16-years and fall outside of the scope for help from the Social Welfare
system. </P>

<P>We have learned from those children whom we have referred to rehabilitation
centres or who were reintegrated back to their families that they are frequently
unsuccessful because they were not provided with coping mechanisms, personal
and life skills, to make a transition to a further phase possible. Furthermore
we know it to be imperative that these girls be provided with the mechanisms
to cope with a background of sexual abuse both as a child (80% of our clients
were molested as children) and by their life on the streets.<BR>
<BR>
Our estimate of the needs of these children is: </P>

<OL>
<LI>A viable alternative to their current lifestyle - a choice </LI>

<LI>Guidance and emotional care </LI>

<LI>Skills </LI>

<LI>Education </LI>

<LI>Drug rehabilitation </LI>

<LI>Long term therapy </LI>

<LI>Reintegration with society and family </LI>
</OL>

<P><BR>
Programmes dealing with these children are few and far between. Whilst
<A HREF="../R/r0002.htm">THE HOUSE</A> started some projects in Johannesburg,
at time of writing these were still the only specialised resources in South
Africa. A project in Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), run by The Salvation Army,
<A HREF="../R/r0033.htm">KWETO COUNSELLING CENTRE</A>, does some excellent
work in this regard. This introduction will not venture into incidence,
statistics, and other resources since all of that (and more) is available
from other material on this site. Let us hope that the World Congress will
provide Governments with the vision to focus on solving this growing problem
growing - the social disease of commodification of our girl-children, for
deviant lust. </P>

<P>In the current psychological and medical literature, discussion of the

harm <I>intrinsic</I> to the act of selling one's body for sex is rarely

mentioned. We view the experience of prostitution as the experience of

traumatic stress.<BR>

Many of the seemingly pathological behaviors of prostitutes, like hostages,

and like other battered women, are survival strategies which make life

possible in the next moment.<BR>

The experience of prostitution is the experience of being repeatedly sexually

assaulted, being dominated, battered and terrorized. The Council for Prostitution

Alternatives has reported that prostituted women were raped approximately

once a week (Hunter, 1994). A Canadian Report on Prostitution and Pornography

found that women and girls in prostitution had a mortality rate 40 times

higher than the national average, (Baldwin, 1993). </P>



<P>The experience of prostitution is a series of events which may be categorized

as stressors according to the DSM-IV diagnosis of posttraumatic stress

disorder(PTSD). DSM-IV authors comment that PTSD may be especially severe

or long lasting when the stressor is of human design (e.g. torture, rape).<BR>

Numerous populations who have experienced trauma have been assessed for

incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder. Some types of trauma are more

likely than others to lead to PTSD. These include homelessness, with its

danger of assault and rape; rape; domestic battering; and being a hostage

and tortured. Individuals who have experienced multiple stressors (such

as prostitutes) are at higher risk for PTSD. We considered the similarities

between prostitutes, on the one hand, and hostages and torture victims.

Allodi (1994) describes trauma specific to hostages as follows: isolation

from contacts with the outside world, including their own families; poor

material conditions; inadequate healthcare; beatings and physical abuse,

particularly if one tries to escape or disobey absurd or dishonorable requests;

uncertainty about the future; feelings of powerlessness and of being used

as a pawn in a game over which one has no control; feelings of worthlessness

and dehumanization; conflicts and ambivalence toward other hostages, one's

captors, and one's own government; and displaced feelings of rage and reproach

since it is not safe to express these feelings directly to one's captors.<BR>

The Stockholm syndrome may explain paradoxical aspects of the traumatic

bonding seen between prostitutes and their pimp-captors. This syndrome

is a psychological strategy which permits emotional and physical survival

in conditions of captivity. Graham et al (1994) have clarified the complex

relationship between captives and their captors by proposing that the following

psychological 2 characteristics of the Stockholm syndrome also apply to

battered women1 including prostitutes: bonding with one's captor; intense

gratefulness for small kindnesses; denial of violence and harm; hypervigilance

with respect to the captor' 5 needs and his perspective on the world; seeing

the captor as protective; extreme difficulty leaving one's captor, even

after physical release has occurred; and longterm fear of retaliation.</P>



<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Method</H3>



<P>The researchers recruited subjects from four different areas in San

Francisco where prostitutes are bought and sold. Some areas were known

to be places where predominantly homeless, drug-using prostitutes worked;

other areas were known for youth or transgendered prostitutes; still other

areas of San Francisco were known to be locations where women who had been

trafficked from other cities worked as prostitutes. we included male and

transgender prostitutes as well as women prostitutes in our sample. In

order to assess PTSD, we used a 17-item self-rating scale which corresponds

to the DSM III-R symptoms of PTSD. Subjects also responded to a 23-item

questionnaire designed by the researchers.</P>



<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><BR>

Results<A NAME="Results"></A></H3>



<P>Many of these subjects expected a &quot;health survey&quot; or a &quot;safe

sex survey.&quot; They had been previously interviewed many times regarding

their sexual practices. Some expressed surprise that the questions referred

to violence in their lives, and that we asked what they needed in order

to leave prostitution.</P>



<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Gender, race and age</H3>



<P>Of the 130 subjects recruited for this study, 75% (97) were women; 13%

(18) were men; and 12% (15) were transgender. 39% (51) were white; 33%

(43) were African-American; 18% (24) were Latina; 6% (8) were Asian or

Pacific Islander. 5% (4) described themselves as of &quot;mixed&quot; race

or left the question blank.<BR>

Mean age was 30.9 years. Ages ranged from 14 to 61 years. </P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Post traumatic stress disorder checklist results <A NAME="checklist"></A></H3>



<P>On the average, our subjects scored at PTSD symptom level for 2 of the

4 DSM III-R criteria for persistent, intrusive reexperiencing of trauma.

On the average, subjects scored at PTSD symptom level ratings for 6 of

the 7 DSM III-R criteria for numbing of general responsiveness and persistent

avoidance of stimuli associated with trauma. Finally, on the average, they

scored at PTSD symptom level for 6 of the 6 criteria for persistent symptons

of hyperarousal.</P>



<P>41% of the 130 prostitutes in this sample met critieria for a diagnosis

of PTSD . We looked at the effects of gender and race on level of violence

experienced in prostitution, and on PTSD checklist scores. Women and transgender

prostitutes experienced significantly more physical assaults and rapes

in prostitution than men prostitutes. We did not discover significant differences

in physical assaults and rapes on the basis of race. Neither race nor gender

affected PTSD checklist overall scores</P>



<P><B>Discussion</B></P>



<P>Extreme violence was evident in the lives of these 130 people working

as prostitutes inSan Francisco. The literature to date has not described

this aspect of prostitutes? lives. It is important to address not only

the violence suffered by this group of people, but the seguelae of the

violence. 82% reported physical assaults in prostitution; 88% reported

physical threats in prostitution; 83% had been threatened with a weapon

in prostitution; and 68% had been raped in prostitution. A corresponding

78% expressed the need for a safe place to go to</P>



<P>Almost half (49%) of this group of prostitutes had pornography made

of them while they worked in prostitution. Often, pornography was used

in ways that disturbed and frightened them: a third (32%) reported to us

that they had been upset by customers' use of pornography in attempting

to coerce them into violent sex or torture. 84% of our sample of prostitutes

reported current or past homelessness. 88% expressed a desire to get out

of prostitution; 73% expressed a desire for job training; and 67% stated

a need for drug or alcohol treatment. This group of people obviously do

not see prostitution as a freely-made job choice. \They wanted get out.

Many reported difficulties in accessing might help them escape prostitution.

For example, they did not feel comfortable in drug and alcohol treatment

facilities where they were sexually harassed. One woman Said: &quot;We

need a place to sit down and talk, like the men have at AA meetings. Just

to talk.&quot; Some battered women's or homeless shelters only offer services

to those who are not intoxicated, which prevented addicted prostitutes

from entering. </P>



<P>Prostitution is almost always a continuation of abuse which began much

earlier, usually at home. Almost all prostitutes have history of incest

or other childhood sexual assault or both. The 57% incidence of sexual

abuse as children reported by these subjects is probably low. Studies have

shown that from 55% to 90% of prostitutes report such a history </P>



<P>Several subjecst co mnented that they didn't want to think about their

pasts when responding to the Questions about childhood. In the middle of

ongoing trauma, it was probably too painful to review childhood abuse.

</P>



<P>Many subjects seemed profoundly uncertain as to just what &quot;abuse&quot;

is. When asked why she answered &quot;no&quot; to the Question regarding

childhood sexual abuse, one womnan whose history was known to one of the

interviewers, said: &quot;Because there was no force, and besides I didn't

even know what it was then - I didn't know it was sex.</P>



<P>Denial may be affecting these subjects' ability or willingness to report

their trauma history. The presence of pimps while our data was being collected

probably contributed to a minimizing of distress. </P>



<P>As Herman (1992) writes of the sexually abused child:<I> &quot;She must

find a way to form primary attachments to caretakers who are either dangerous

or, from her perspective1 negligent. She muSt find a way to develop a sense

of hasic trust and safety with caretakers who are untrustworthy and unsafe.

She must develop a sense of self in relation to others who are helpless,

uncaring, orcruel . She must develop a capacity for bodily self-regulation

in an environment in which her body is at the disposal of others' needs,

as well as a capacity for self-soothing in an environment without solace.

She must develop the capacity for initiative in an environment which demands

that she brings her will into c~lete conformity with that of her abuser.

And ultimately, she must develop a.capacity for intimacy out of an environment

which defines her as a whore and a slave</I>.&quot; </P>



<P>And that environment continues to define her as a whore and slave: many

women never escape it.</P>



<P>Some authors have noted the positive correlation between substance abuse

and prostitution. It is not clear whether drug abuse tends to precede prostitution,

or whether drugs were used after entering prostitution in order to nuu~

out the pain of working as a prostitute. In many, it is likely that drug

and alcohol abuse begins after incest or childhood sexual assault, as a

form of selfmedication for childhood PTSD.</P>



<P>Male (13%) and transgender (12%) prostitutes may be included in our

san~le in greater percentage than they are actually represented in San

Francisco. however, we wanted their input, since reports of their experiences

in prostitution, especially transgender prostitutes', are rarely available.

Women and transgender prostitutes experienced significantly more violence

(rapes and physical assaults) than did male prostitutes. ~ be female -

or to be perceived as female - is to be more intensely targeted for violence.

</P>



<P>We believe that o r sample was racially representative of prostitutes

in San Francisco. Many of our subjects described their race and ethnicity

in great detail: for exaxple, Cuban/Italian; 7 Hawaiian/German; Indian/French/Black;

Indian/Italian. Racism is sexualized in systems of prostitution: customers

purchase race and ethnicity as well as gender. </P>



<P>	41% of the 130 prostitutes in this sample met criteria for a PTSD diagnosis.

The incidence of reported PTSD among battered women in shelters or battered

women seeking help varies from 45% to as high as 84% . The incidence of

current PTSD in male Vietnam veterans is 15%, although the incidence is

higher (35%) in men with high war-zone exposure.</P>



<P>	Studies of PTSD do not usually measure symptoms in populations in the

process of being traumatized, as we did. Because of this active trauma,

dissociative amnesia was probably intensified. we predict that if our subjects

were offered safety1 overall PTSD symptoms would initially increase because

it would be safe to allow oneself to experience them.</P>



<P>	The PTSD symptoms from which these prostitutes suffered could be categorized

as complex post traumatic stress disorder (Herman, 1992) which includes

a history of subjection to totalitarian control over a prolonged period,

with alterations in: affect regulation, consciousness, self-perception,

perception of perpetrator, relations with others, and systems of meaning.

</P>



<P>We recommend further study of the physical harm of prostitution, its

effects on PTSD, and its effects on dissociation and multiplicity. Without

an understanding of the psychological harm resulting from prostitution,

treating prostitution survivors is impossible. There is an urgent need

to more fully articulate the psychological harm of prostitution. 	A recent

medical debate compared prostitution with selling one' 5 kidneys: &quot;The

point about buying a pint of blood, or a kidney; renting someone's body

for an hour or two; or living off other people' 5 ill-health is that all

these are. forms of exploitation based on making a commodity of human beings.&quot;

(Brecher, 1990) Feminists have understood prostitution as exploitation,

objectification and targeting of women as a class in order to maintain

men's power over women in general (Dworkin, 1979, 1993) and have also understood

prostitution to be a violation of basic human rights (Barry, 1979, 1995).

</P>



<P>	Recently, Pederson (1994) suggested that an interest in controlling

the spread of HIV has motivated a trend toward legitimizing prostitution

as just another job. Legalizing prostitution - a process of registering

and tracking those who work as prostitutes - results in states or municipalities

acting as pimps. Three of the women in our sample had worked in a locale

where prostitution is legal. Preferring to work on the streets of San Francisco,

they all stated that their lives in legal brothels were unbearable. </P>



<P>	Although a discussion of decrimlnalization or legalization of prostitution

is beyond the scope of this paper, two comments should be made. First,

legalization of prostitution would further normalize the harm, exploitatidn,

and human rights violations which we have described. We oppose legalization

of prostitution. 	We do not support legal prosecution of prostitu s themselves.

However, we do advocate prosecution, or &quot;criminalization&quot; of

traffickers, pimps, and customers of prostitutes. 	Normalizing prostitution

denies the harm caused by prostitution, and facilitates continued harm.

Except for discussing STD's, those who wish to legitimize or legalize prostitution

a void discussing the harm caused to prostitutes by their work. </P>



<P>Although HIV has certainly created a public health crisis, we would

propose that being sexually assaulted throughout childhood, and being physically

and sexually assaulted on one's job, &quot;and having a &quot;job&quot;

in which the incidence of attempted suicide may be as high as 75% (Hunter,

1993, study of escort prostitution) - this too is a public health crisis.

</P>



<P>	Truamna research has been criticized for pathologizing the victim instead

of attending to social attitudes and behaviors which cause trauma. We must

focus our attention on changing.a social system which makes it possible

for girls to become prostitutes. We must not only stop the abuse of children,

but also the mechanisms of dissociation and denial which collude with that

abuse. Dissociation and denial normalize prostitution. The trend toward

normalizing prostitution normalizes hatred of women and racism, and trivializes

poverty and violence, such as that described here.</P>

R.J. Labuschagne<BR>

<BR>

<B>ABSTRACT on Thesis</B></P></CENTER>



<P><BR>

Juvenile male prostitution is practised world-wide. The fact that it occurs

in urban areas of South Africa. has been attested to by media reports since

approximately 1985. Nevertheless ft is a relatively unknown phenomenon

as it has never before been researched in South Africa. This study is the

first research project which has been undertaken in South Africa.<BR>

<BR>

The aim of the study was to describe an educational psychological approach

which was designed to assist those involved in juvenile male prostitution.<BR>

<BR>

In this research a qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual

study was implemented. The research was divided into two phases. In the

first phase the life experiences of the juvenile male prostitutes were

explored and described using exploratory multiple case studies based on

numerous sources in order to collect the data. The written data was subsequently

analysed adding to Giorgi's phenomenological analysis and Kerlinger's content

analysis. Categories which came to light, were used in describing the subjects'

life experiences.<BR>

<BR>

The validity and reliability of the research were ensured using Guba's

model for determining trustworthiness. On completion of the investigation,

the research findings were compared with the relevant available literature,

to determine the existence of similarities and differences. At the end

of the first phase, a number of themes were identified and were employed

as a guide to the formulation of an educational psychological remedial

approach.<BR>

<BR>

The three areas which were identified 03 being significant in describing

an educational psychological approach were: boys who had run away from

home and who were living outside conventional social structures, boys who

were living with their families, and boys who were still at school.<BR>

<BR>

In describing an educational psychological approach the main focus was

directed at those juvenile male prostitutes who were living outside conventional

social structures. As three of the tour subjects used In the research project

filled this requirement, it was decided to implement the programme with

one of the subjects in order to evaluate and adapt it, if necessary.<BR>

<BR>

Prior to implementation of the programme the proposed educational psychological

approach<BR>

for therapeutics assistance was submitted to two educational psychologists

and a social worker for their appraisal during a panel discussion. Following

consultation with this panel of experts, it was decided that too many factors

existed which could negatively affect the therapy. These factors were identified

as: the absence of social structures, the lack of conditions which would

satisfy basic needs, and the absence of social support structures.<BR>

<BR>

Taking these conditions into account, it was decided not to proceed with

the implementation of the educational psychological therapeutic programme

but instead, to establish a framework of principles is regarded as an essential

prerequisite to the identification and amelioration of negative factors

which would prevent any programme of assistance form achieving success.<BR>

<BR>

This framework of principles was described according to the information

obtained during the first phase, as well as insights from discussions with

individuals and representatives from other authorities. </P>

<CENTER><P><B>LABOR DEPARTMENT RELEASES REPORT ON CHILD PROSTITUTION AS

A FORM OF FORCED LABOR</B> </P></CENTER>



<P>The U.S. Labor Department's Bureau of International Labor Affairs today

released its first-ever publication about the use of children in the commercial

sex industry around the world. &quot;Forced child prostitution is forced

labor and child labor in their most exploitative forms,&quot;said Joaquin

F. Otero, deputy under secretary for international affairs.</P>



<P><BR>

The publication, entitled <B>Forced Labor</B>: The Prostitution of Children

contains the proceedings from a symposium held at the Department of Labor

in September 1995. The symposium focused on the forced trafficking and

prostitution of young children, mostly girls,in the profitable commercial

sex industry. Forced Labor includes a keynote address by Representative

Joseph P. Kennedy, sponsor of the 1994 Child Sex Abuse Prevention act,

and reports by internationally recognized experts on children's rights

and child prostitution. </P>



<P>The report and symposium are part of the department's international

child labor project, in existence for over two years, to research and report

on the exploitation of child labor in all its forms. Two major reports

were issued in 1994 and 1995, entitled <B>By the Sweat and Toil of Children</B>:

The Use of Child Labor in U.S. Manufacturing and mining imports and, By

the Sweat and Toil of Children: The Use of Child Labor in U.S. Agricultural

imports and <B>Forced and Bonded Child Labor</B>.</P>



<P>&quot;The goal of the symposium and this publication is to focus public

attention on the issue of child prostitution a problem of international

dimensions. As we look forward to the Stockholm <A HREF="../P/stock.htm">World

Congress on the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children</A> this August,

we hope that the proceedings from this important symposium will make a

contribution to the ongoing international discussions and action towards

the elimination,of child sexual exploitation,&quot; said Otero. </P>



<P>The congress is the first international meeting held for the specific

purpose of developing strategies to fight commercial sexual exploitation

of children. It is being organized by the Government of Sweden in cooperation

with UNICEF, End Child Prostitution Asian Tourism (ECPAT), and the (NGO)

Group for the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In August 1995, the

Department of Labor signed an agreement with the International Labor Organization

(ILO) to contribute funds to the ILO's International Program on the Elimination

of Child Labor. One of the major programs supported by the department helps

children at risk of exploitation Thailand's sex industry. </P>

<H2>World Congress against the Commercial Exploitation of

Children</H2>



<H4>This congress, hosted by the Swedish government, will be held in Stockholm

during the end of August 1996. More than a thousand delegates from all

over the world will convene here to learn from one another, and to device

action plans for reform in their respective countries.</H4>



<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Pre-Congress Papers toward the World Congress against

Commercial Exploitation of Children</H3>



<P><BR>

</P>



<P>The World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children

aims to draw international attention to the problems of child prostitution,

child pornography and the sale and trafficking of children for sexual purposes

and to initiate decisive action - nationally and internationally - to put

an end to these heinous violations of children's' rights.<BR>

</P>



<P>Commercial sexual exploitation of children occurs in many different

ways and in a wide variety of settings. The underlying causes are numerous,

complex and closely interrelated and must be analysed, understood and confronted

accordingly.<BR>

</P>



<P>In order to facilitate greater understanding, the Planning Committee

(The Government of Sweden, <A HREF="http://www.unep.no:80/unicef/">UNICEF</A>,

<A HREF="../R/r0034.htm">ECPAT</A> and the NGO Group on the Convention

on the Rights of the Child) has commissioned theme papers on nine major

topics.<BR>

These will be discussed in panel sessions and workshops at the Congress.

The papers complement each other and taken together represent an attempt

to provide a broad overview, touching on all facets of this problem.<BR>

</P>



<H4>This page will deal with the issues of the conference, and contains

a variety of material. You will find Reports, Case Studies, Decisions,

the Draft Declaration, and Articles about the conference and especially

about the African perspective of the Sexual Commercial Exploitation of

Children.</H4>



<P>

<h1> BACKGROUND DOCUMENT</h1>
<h2> UNICEF</h2>
<h2> ECPAT</h2>
<h2> NGO Group for the Convention on the Rights of the Child</h2>
<h1><i><b> World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children 
Stockholm Sweden 2731 August 1996</b></i></h1>

<P>
 <center>
<h3><b></b></h3>
<h3><b> 1. THE CONGRESS: An international response to an inhuman growth 
industry</b></h3>
</center></P><P>
<h4> Each year, more than I million children worldwide are reportedly forced 
into child prostitution, trafficked and sold for sexual purposes or used in 
child pornography. Coerced or lured into the world's sex market - a 
multi-billion dollar industry -children are denied their rights, their dignity 
and their childhood. Commercial sexual exploitation subjects children to one 
of the most hazardous forms of child labour, endangers their mental and 
physical health and undermines all aspects of their development.</h4>
 </P><P>
<h4> To develop strategies that will combat this fundamental violation of 
children's rights. the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation 
of Children will convene in Stockholm, Sweden, from 27-31 August 1996. The 
first global meeting of its kind, the Congress was initiated by the 
international non-governmental organization, (NGO), End Child Prostitution in 
Asian Tourism (ECPAT) and will be hosted by the Government of Sweden 
co-operating with the United Nations Children's Fund, (<A HREF="http:///www.unep.no:80/unicef/" NAME="unicef">UNICEF</A>), ECPAT and the 
NGO Group for the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</h4>
 </P><P>
<h4> The Congress will bring together a wide range of national and 
international leaders. professionals and activists, representatives of 
governments, inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations, law 
enforcement agencies, academic institutions, health professionals and members 
of the media from all regions of the world. The participation</h4>
<h4> of several UN and other international bodies and agencies, including the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights Office, the Centre for Human Rights, ILO, 
WHO, UNESCO, UNAIDS, UNHCR and INTERPOL, attests to the broad scope of 
commercial sexual exploitation as a human rights', labour, health, education 
and law enforcement problem.</h4>
 <center>
<h3><b> 2. THE TASKS OF THE CONGRESS</b></h3>
</center></P><P>
<h4> The Congress will focus on three elements of the commercial sexual 
exploitation of children: child prostitution. the trafficking and sale of 
children for sexual purposes, and child pornography. Its primary purpose is to 
create awareness and to draw international attention to the 2 problems of 
commercial sexual exploitation of children and to promote the development of 
national plans to combat all forms of such abuse in the specific contexts in 
which they occur. To this end the Congress will consider a Declaration and 
develop an Agenda for Action. The Congress will provide an open forum for 
discussion through workshops and presentation of case studies, in which all 
segments of society can exchange experiences. It will define the scope of the 
problem, explore the underlying causes and the specific forms of commercial 
sexual exploitation of children in different countries and regions. The 
Congress will also consider nine themes which cover major forms of child 
prostitution, trafficking and child pornography. They deal with the various 
categories of Sex Exploiters, Children in Pornography, Tourism and Sexual 
Exploitation, Health Matters, Legal Reform and Law Enforcement, and the issues 
of Prevention and Psycho-social Rehabilitation, the role of Education, the 
Media and Human Values.</h4></P><P>
 <center>
<h3><b> 3. THE CONGRESS AND THE CONVENTION ON THE</b><b> RIGHTS</b></h3>
<h3><b> OF THE CHILD</b></h3>
</center>
 <h4> The Congress will be guided by the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
and other international instruments. One hundred and eighty seven governments 
have ratified the Convention to date.</h4>
 <h4> Many articles of the Convention apply to sexual exploitation and its 
consequences. These require that countries that have ratified the Convention 
take appropriate action to protect children from 'all forms of physical or 
mental violence, injury or abuse, including sexual abuse&quot; by parent(s), 
guardian(s) or caretaker (19); from &quot;economic exploitation and from 
performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the 
child's education, or to be harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, 
spiritual, moral or social development&quot; (32): from the &quot;inducement 
or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful sexual activity&quot;; from 
&quot;the exploitative use of children in prostitution or other unlawful 
sexual practices&quot;; from the &quot;exploitative use 3 of children in 
pornographic performances and materials&quot; (34) and from &quot;the 
abduction of' sale of, or traffic in children for any purpose&quot; (35).</h4>
<h4></h4></P><P>
<h4> The Convention protects the rights of children in conflict with the law, 
ensuring that &quot;no child shall be deprived of his or her liberty 
unlawfully or arbitrarily&quot; (37); it provides for the &quot;physical and 
psychological recovery and social reintegration of a child victim of any form 
of neglect, exploitation, or abuse&quot; (39). It recognizes the right of 
every accused child &quot;to be treated in a manner consistent with the 
promotion of the child's sense of dignity and worth ... and which takes into 
account the child's age and the desirability of promoting the child's 
reintegration and the child's assuming a constructive role in society&quot; 
(40).</h4></P><P>
 <h4> Other rights abrogated by commercial sexual exploitation of children 
include: the right to hea]th, to education, to a family, name, culture, the 
right to play, and to a &quot;standard of living adequate for the child's 
physical, mental, spiritual, social and moral development&quot; A fundamental 
premise of the Convention is that no single article or group of articles can 
be interpreted independently and that the entire Convention must be seen as 
indivisible. The Convention also suggests an integrated and comprehensive 
approach to action which can guide and unify priorities, policies and 
programmes.</h4></P> 
 <center>
<h3><b> 4. WHAT IS  'COMMERCIAL SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN' ?</b>
</h3>
</center>
<h4> The Convention on the Rights of the Child defines a &quot;child&quot; as 
anyone below the age of 18 years unless, under the law applicable to the 
child, majority is attained earlier. Commercial sexual exploitation of 
children is the use of a child for sexual purposes in exchange for cash or 
in-kind favours between the child her or himself, the customer, intermediary 
or agent and others who profit from the trade in children for these purposes. 
The three forms of commercial sexual exploitation, that the Congress will 
address, have been defined by the United Nations, as follows:</h4>
 
<h4><b> 1. Child Prostitution:</b></h4>
<blockquote>
<h4> &quot;Child prostitution is the act of engaging or offering the services 
of a child to perform sexual acts for money or other consideration with that 
person or any other person&quot;.*</h4>
</blockquote>
 <P>
<h4><b> 2. Trafficking and sale of children across borders and within 
countries for sexual purposes:</b></h4></P>
<blockquote>
<h4> The 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave 
Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery defines the sale of 
children as &quot;the transfer of a child from one party to another for 
whatever purpose in exchange for financial or other reward compensation.&quot; 
Sexual trafficking is the profitable business of transporting children for 
commercial sexual purposes. It can be across borders or within countries, 
across State lines, from city to city, or from rural to urban centre.</h4>
</blockquote>


<h4><b> 3. Child Pornography:</b></h4>
<blockquote>
<h4> Child pornography is any visual or audio material which uses children in 
a sexual context. It consists of &quot;the visual depiction of a child engaged 
in explicit sexual conduct, real or simulated. or the lewd exhibition of the 
genitals intended for the sexual gratification of the user, and involves the 
production, distribution and/or use of such material&quot;.2 The purpose of 
audio pornography is similar. Because of easy and inexpensive access through 
computer based information networks, child pornography has increased in recent 
years and appropriate legislative remedies have become increasingly difficult.
</h4>
</blockquote>
 <P>
<h4> Child prostitution, sale and trafficking, and child pornography are 
closely linked. Trafficking for sexual purposes implies prostitution as a 
consequence and prostitution is frequently combined with the production of 
pictures, videos and other forms of sexually explicit visual materials 
involving children.</h4></P>

<h3><b> THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEMS:</b></h3>
<h3><b> A mirror of society</b></h3>
</center><P>
<h4> Commercial sexual exploitation today is an industry built on the abuse of 
power, that buys and sells, and in other ways treats children as sexual and 
economic commodities rather than human beings. Its scope is transnational, its 
impact transgenerational. Commercial sexual exploitation of children exists in 
virtually every country in the world. It connects small villages with large 
urban centres, developing countries to each other and to the industrialized 
countries. Presently, the majority of published studies are from Asia. In 
other regions, the availability of information is scattered or 
non-existent,especially in Africa and the Middle East. The need for more 
accurate data is acute. Although the vast majority are exploited children are 
girls, victims include a growing number of boys. They are mostly children from 
poor families; they come from both urban and rural areas. The majority are 
between the ages of 14 and 18, although there is evidence that the fear of 
AIDS in some countries has caused a greater demand for ever younger girls. 
These children are deceived, kidnaped and sold; they are also runaways or 
children who turn to prostitution on their own to survive, to improve their 
standard of living, or to increase their access to consumer goods.</h4></P>
 <P>
<h4> Those responsible for sexually exploiting children represent a wide 
variety of behaviours, origins, and motives, and constitute a wide range of 
persons, customers, intermediaries, recruiters and other perpetrators who 
profit from the commercial exploitation of children for sex. The vast majority 
of customer s are local inhabitants for whom sex with a child may often be a 
question of availability rather than preference. During the last decade, it 
seems that international tourism for sexual purposes has grown and 
consequently in a number of countries an increasing proportion of the 
exploiters are foreigners.</h4></P>
 <h4> The complex web of illegal transactions that constitute sale and 
trafficking frequently include bribery and abduction, false identification and 
documentation, sham marriages and adoptions, illegal immigrations, violence 
and bonded labour. Many trafficked children are from impoverished rural and 
remote areas where they and their families are least likely to understand the 
true nature of the risks and consequences involved and to be more easily 
deceived. Trafficked to an unfamiliar area, such children are completely 
dependent on the trafficker and, thus, are easier to control. Isolated by 
language and without identity papers, they are vulnerable to exposure and 
arrest as illegal immigrants if they try to escape.</h4>
 </P><p>
<h4> The negative impact of commercial sexual exploitation on children is 
profound and often permanent. For those who survive, and some don't, it may 
cause irreparable damage to their physical and mental health. Child victims, 
inadequately protected by loopholes in legislation or inadequate 
implementation of laws, are often treated as criminals and left with little 
recourse other than to re-enter the vicious cycle of abuse and exploitation at 
a constantly increasing level of risk to their very existence.</h4>
 </p>
<p>
<h4>Commercial sexual exploitation of children must be analyzed, understood and 
confronted in the societal context in which it occurs. Although it may be 
tempting to place the blame mainly on criminal syndicates. to reduce 
exploiters to pimps and individual perpetrators, to disparage the children 
themselves as promiscuous or sexually irresponsible. no sector of society can 
escape responsibility for the sexual exploitation of children.</h4>
</p>
 <p>
<h4>The variations in types of backgrounds and situations in which children are 
victimized are manifold and intricately linked. The underlying causes are 
numerous and complex. They range from the expansion of global market forces 
and a growing materialism perpetuated by the media, to rapid social 
transformation and the erosion of values, nationally and locally. They 
encompass economic and political injustice and the resulting disparities 
between rich and poor, discrimination against minorities and indigenous 
people, resulting in large scale migration. urbanization, and family 
disintegration. They also include histone and continuing cultural attitudes 
which place a low value on girls and women, and the skewed interpretation of 
traditional norms such as duty and obligation to parents. Together with the 
behaviour of unscrupulous exploiters, these forces combine to trap children 
into suffering one of humankind's cruelest abuses.</h4>
</p>
 
<h3><b><center> 6. THE CONGRESS AS A STEP TOWARD THE FUTURE:</b></h3>
</center>
<p>
<h4>The Congress is part of the broader process to implement children's rights. 
Its planning has assured preparations for future work at the country and 
regional level. The Declaration and Agenda for Action to be considered by the 
Congress will be translated into concrete recommendations through 
action-oriented workshops at the Congress itself. This will facilitate the 
formulation of National Plans of Action at the country level. The involvement 
of governments, non-governmental organizations and international agencies as 
equally responsible partners promotes strong alliances for decisive follow-up. 
The Congress will be a milestone in the continuing effort to combat commercial 
sexual exploitation and realize the rights of all children.</h4>

 <P><CENTER>Declaration</CENTER>
 <ol>
<li>	We, gathered in Stockholm for the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, representing the Governments of  countries, together with non governmental organisations, the End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism (ECPAT) campaign, UNICEF and other agencies within the family of the United Nations, and other concerned organisations and individuals world-wide, hereby commit ourselves to a global partnership against the commercial sexual exploitation of children. 
The Challenge.
<li>	Every day, more and more children around the world are subjected to sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. Concerted action is needed at the local, national, regional and international levels to bring an end to the phenomena. 
<li>  Every child is entitled to full protection from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse.
This is reaffirmed by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, an international legal instrument of universal significance (of which there are.... States Parties). 
States are required to protect the child from sexual exploitation and sexual abuse and promote 
physical and psychological recovery and social re integration of the child victim.
<li>	According to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration in all actions concerning children, and their rights are to be enjoyed without discrimination of any kind. In all matters affecting the child, the views of the child should 
be given due weight, in accordance with the age and maturity of the child.
<li> The commercial sexual exploitation of children is a fundamental violation of children's rights.
It comprises sexual abuse by the adult and remuneration in cash or kind to the child or a third person or persons. The child is treated as a sexual object and as a commercial object. The commercial sexual exploitation of children constitutes a form of coercion and violence against children, and amounts to forced labour and a contemporary form of slavery. 
<li>	Poverty cannot be used as a justification for the commercial sexual exploitation of children,
even though it contributes to an environment which may lead to such exploitation. A range of other complex contributing factors include economic disparities, inequitable socio-economic structures, dysfunctioning families, lack of education, growing consumerism, urban-rural migration, gender discrimination, irresponsible male sexual behaviour, harmful traditional practices, armed conflicts and trafficking of children. 
All these factors exacerbate the vulnerability of girls and boys to those who would seek to procure them for commercial sexual exploitation. Criminals and criminal networks take part in procuring and channelling vulnerable children toward commercial sexual exploitation and in perpetuating such exploitation. 
<li>These criminal elements service the demand in the sex market created by customers, mainly men, who seek unlawful sexual gratification with children. 
Corruption and collusion, absence of and/or inadequate laws, lax law enforcement, and limited sensitization of law enforcement personnel to the  impact on children, are all further factors which lead, directly or indirectly, to the commercial sexual exploitation of children. 
It may involve the acts of a single individual, or be organized on a small scale (e.g. family and acquaintances) or a large scale (e.g. criminal network).
<li>	A wide range of individuals and groups at all levels of society contribute to the exploitative practice. This includes intermediaries, family members, the business sector, service providers, customers, community leaders and government officials, all of whom may contribute to the exploitation through indifference, ignorance of the harmful consequences suffered by children, or 
the perpetuation of attitudes and values that view children as economic commodities. 
<li>	The commercial sexual exploitation of children can result in serious, life-long, even life threatening consequences for the physical, psychological, spiritual, moral and social development of children, including the threat of early pregnancy, maternal mortality, injury, retarded development, physical disabilities and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV-AIDS. 
Their right to enjoy childhood and to lead a productive, rewarding and dignified life is seriously compromised.
<li>While laws, policies and pro grammes exist to counter the commercial sexual exploitation of 
children, greater political will, more effective implementation measures, and adequate allocation of resources are needed to give effect to the spirit and letter of these laws, policies and pro grammes. 
<li> The primary task of combating the commercial sexual exploitation of children rests with the State and families. The civil society also has an essential role to play in preventing and protecting children from commercial sexual exploitation. It is imperative to build a strong partnership between Governments, international organisations and all sectors of society to counter such exploitation. The 
Commitment 
<li> The World Congress reiterates its commitment to the rights of the child, bearing in mind the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and calls upon all States in co-operation with national and international organisations and civil society to:<ul>
<LI> Accord high priority to action against the commercial sexual exploitation of children and allocate adequate resources for this purpose; 
<li> Promote stronger co-operation between States and all sectors of society to prevent children from entering the sex trade and to strengthen the role of families in protecting children against commercial sexual exploitation; 
<LI> Criminalise the commercial sexual exploitation of children, as well as other forms of sexual exploitation of children, and condemn and penalize all those offenders involved, whether local or foreign, while ensuring that the child victims of this practice are not penalized; 
<LI>Review and Revise, where appropriate, laws, policies, pro grammes and practices to eliminate the commercial sexual exploitation of children; 
<LI> Enforce laws, policies and pro grammes to protect children from commercial sexual exploitation and strengthen communication and co-operation between law enforcement authorities; 
<LI>Promote adoption, implementation and dissemination of laws, policies, and pro grammes supported by relevant regional, national and local mechanisms against the commercial sexual exploitation of children; 
<LI> Develop and Implement comprehensive gender-sensitive plans and pro grammes to prevent the commercial sexual exploitation of children, to protect and assist the child victims and to facilitate their recovery and re integration into society;
<LI> Create a climate through education, social mobilization, and development activities to ensure that parents and others legally responsible for children are able to fulfil their rights, duties and responsibilities to protect children from commercial sexual exploitation; 
<LI> Mobilize political and other partners, national and international communities, including inter governmental organisations and non-governmental organisations, to assist countries in eliminating the commercial sexual exploitation of children; and 
<LI> Enhance the role of popular participation, including that of children, in preventing and eliminating the commercial sexual exploitation of children. </ul></P>

<P>EXECUTIVE SUMARY
<P>
<P>In adoptine a succession of treaties through out the XXth Centuiy the international community has demonstrated long-standing concern about sexual exploitation and cotinected issues such as trafficking and certain aspects of slavery in general or with specific reference to children. These instruments have been drafted (LII) in various contexts - human rghts humanitarian, refugees labour standards etc. - and have also instigated the development of a number of regional treaties tackling the issues involved.
<P>
<P> Functionality of this body of interniational law shows that it has concentrated more especially on protection than on exploitation in prostitution as opposed to exploitative use In pornography a field in which clear definitions - and hence a clear basis for consensus and cooperation - are lacking.
<P>
<P>ilic degree of a(1heience to these international treaties ranges widelv. Ho~ever, the most si~nificant instuiment for efforts in this sphere - the Convention on the Rights of the Child -has lcllievt (1 ~lnio4 unl\~ersal ratification.

<P>illcse texts ha\~ \ anously generated and been inspired bv measures taken at national le~eI. ~viiether of a IeoI~atI\ C. administrative or other nature. Ill botil ilIdustlialised and developing coLilItries. 1)1 ~o~~tIpation over the growin 0 incidence of sexual exploitation of children and thc lllcreasulgl\ inteniational character of several of its manifestations has triggered a spate ofne~~ le~islatioII during tile Nineties in particular. This paper discusses national measures taken in tile areas of child prostitution. trafficking, pornography. sex tourisni. extratenitorial legislation and problems relating to child witnesses and the rights oftile accused.
<P>
<P>w'iilst gaps in legislation still exist, 1a~ enforcement no~v poses the major challen~e. Tilis and the prevention aspect. including forms of punishment and detelTence. are addressed in the paper. as are the goals of international cooperation in this regard.
<P>
<P>It is recommended, inter alia, that governments and non-governmental organizations (NCiOs) 115C the Convention on the Rights of the Child as the basis for reviewing and mollitoring legislative provisions and la~v enforcement. The paper also suggests the establishment of an intersectoral task-force and a monitoring system (e.g. Ombudsperson) in e\~ery cow~try as necessary elements of a coherent effort to combat the commercial sexual cxii loitation of children.

<P>Ilitroduction
<P>
<P>~ternational <FONT SIZE=3>concern over phenomena more </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>or </B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>less closely associated with sexual exploitation - slavery, forced labour, trafficking, financial gains from tiie prostitution of others, obscene publications, etc. - has been reflected in a relatively large number of treaties drawn up since the beginning of this century, within the framework of the global development of international human ri~ts law.</FONT>
<P>
<P>The following were the main treaties adopted prior to the founding of the United Nations (excluding ~ternational Labour Organisation (WO) Conventions - see 2 below):
<P>
<P>1 904 lntefl)ational Agreement for the Suppression of <FONT SIZE=3>the White </FONT><FONT SIZE=1>Slave Traffic (aine~~ded by Protocol of 3 December 1948)</FONT>
<P>
<P>1 910 International Convention for the Suppression of the White Slave Traffic (amended by Protocol of 3 December 1948)
<P>
<P>1919 Convention ofSaint-Gennain-en-Laye (to secure the complete suppression of slavery in all its forms and of the slave trade by land and sea)
<P>
<P>1921 International Convention for the Suppression ofthe Traffic in Women and Children (amended by Protocol of 20 October 1947)
<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>Those amended by protocols were taken on board by the United Nations the 1919 convention has lapsed.
<P>
<P>The following sections focus more especially on binding texts, but also cover selected components of &quot;soft law&quot; dealing explicitly or implicitly with the subject. These sections are:
<P>(I) United Nations texts that are currently in force or valid, (2) ILO instruments, (3) refugee law (4) humanitarian law. (5) international texts in preparation (6) regional treaties ~~1iicli contain provisions relevant to the protection of children from commercial sexual exploitation, and (7) extracts from comments by the Committee on the Rights of the Child. Section 8 is a short commentary.

<P>
<P>1.1.	1923 Convention for the Suppression of ~he Circulation of, and Traffic in, Obscene Publications (amended by Protocol of 12 November 1947)
<P>
<P>~is Convention as <FONT SIZE=3>amended had beeii ratified by 53 countries as at 3 1 December 1994. ~e ratification rate ill recent years has, however, been extremely lo~: the most recent ratification apart from the succession ofthe Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1 993 dates back to 1983 (Cuba). Glily one other country (Solomon Islands, 1981) ratified during the Figl)ties and only three cowitries ratified during the Seventies (Fiji in 197] Zambia in I 974 and Lesotho in 1975).</FONT>
<P>
<P>Interestingly, two countries that had been States Parties since i 949 subsequently notified denunciation: Denmark in 1967 (no motive recorded) and the Netherlands in 1985 ',4iich motn'ated the decision by sa~ing that the provisions oftlie Dutch Criminal Code had been amended to concen~ only 1)roduction, possession or trade relating to &quot;the portrayal <FONT SIZE=2><I>of- </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>or</FONT>

<P>
<P>Hie treat, indeed covers all fo~s of poniography. notably making it a punishable offbnce in States Parties &quot;[flor pu~~,oses ofor by way oftrade or for distribution or public exhibitioii to make or produce or have ii) posseSSion obscene ~~1itings, dra~~ings, prints, paintings,

<P>
<P>()fi~nders are in principle to be brought to trial in the State Party &quot;in whose tenitories the olfeuce. or ai~v ofthe constituti\e elements oftlie offence. was committed&quot; but, when the
<P>s oftuc counti',' so pe~it. they may alteniatively (not additionally) be prosecuted in the State Party of whi cli they are iiationals &quot;if they are foutid in its tenitofles. even if the con stit utive elements of the off~nce were committed outside such tenitories&quot;.
<P>
<P>1.2.	<B>1949 Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and the </B><FONT SIZE=3>[xploitation <B>of the Prostitution of Others</B></FONT>
<P>
<P>~is Cunvention had been ratified by 70 countries as at 3 1 December 1994. It was desio~ed to consolidate the above-mentioned treaties of 1904, 1910. 192 1 and 1933 ~iich were in force at the time it was adopted and which thereby became obsolete. Essentially. it obliges States Parties to punish any person who. &quot;to grati~' the passions of another, [pirocures. entices or leads away another person for pu~oses of prostitution&quot; or &quot;exploits the
<P>prostitution of an other person&quot;, eveii ~vith the latter's consent. Also punishable is the '.unnin~ ofa brothel and rentin~ accommodation for the p~wpose oftlie prostitution of others. Under the treaty. such offences are to be regarded as extraditable or. in States where extradition is not pe~itted, nationals who have retunied to their OWil State after the commission

The Convention then sets out procedures for combating international traffic in persons <B>(especially women and children) for the purpose of prostitution.</B></FONT>
<P>
<P>1.3.	1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and Institutions and Practices SimiJar to Slavery
<P>
<P>This Convention had been ratified by 114 countries as <B>of 31 December </B><FONT SIZE=3>1994. It was designed to cornplement, <B>not to replace, the </B>1926 Slavery Convention. For the purposes of this paper, the most pertinent provision of this treaty is Article 1, which obliges States Parties to &quot;take aU practicable and necessary legislative and other measures to bring about progressively and as soon as possible the complete abolition or abandonment of', </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>ijifer aha, </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;[ajny institution or practice whereby a child or young person under the age of 1 8 years, is delivered by either or both of his natural parents or by his guardian to another person. whether for reward or not, with a view to the exploitation of the child or young person or of his labour&quot;.</FONT>
<P>
<P>1.4.	<FONT SIZE=3>1979 <B>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of I)iscrimination against Women</B></FONT>
<P>
<P>~is <B>Conveiflion, in force since 1981, had been </B><FONT SIZE=3>ratified by 13 I countries as of 30 June 1994. Article 6 directs States Parties to &quot;take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of prostitution of women.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<P>1.5.	1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child
<P>
<P>TIlis Convention (CRC) had been ratified by 187 countries as of 15 April 1996. It defines a child as &quot;every human being below the age of eighteen years unless, under the law applicable to tile child, majority is attained earlier&quot;. It contains several provisions relevant to the issues under consideration.
<P>
<P>Article 19 stipulates that &quot;States Parties shall take aU appropriate legislative, administrative. social and educational measures to protect the child from [...ji maltreatment or exl)loitation, including sexual abuse, while in tile care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child&quot;.
<P>
<P>Under Article 32 &quot;States Parties recogilise the riglit of the child to be protected fiom [...J performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or [...~ to be harmtul to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development&quot;. A minimum age or ages for employment are to be set (cf ILO Convention 138 , under 2.2. below) and States are bound to &quot;~]rovide for appropriate penalties or other sanctions to ensure the effective enforcement ofthe present article.&quot;
<P>
<P>Article 34 provides that &quot;States Parties undertake to protect the child from all fo~s of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse&quot; and to &quot;take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent: (a) the inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful sexual activity; (b) the exploitative use of children in prostitution or any other
<P>
<P>
<P><CENTER>4</CENTER>
<P>unla~l sexual practices; (c) the exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials.&quot; It is worth noting that this, the key provision in the Convention relating to commercial sexual exploitation, has not been the subject of a reservation by any of the States Parties.
<P>
<P>Similarly, Article 35 obliges States Parties to take &quot;all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent the abduction of the sale of or traffic in children for any purpose or in any fo~i.&quot;
<P>
<P>Finally, Article 39 requires States Parties to &quot;take all appropriate measures to promote physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of a child victim of.. ally forni of... exploitation... in an environment which fosters the health, self-respect and dignity of the child&quot;.
<P>
<P>2.	<B>ILO INSTRUMENTS</B>
<P>
<P>The conclusions of the <FONT SIZE=2><I>~!,iited AYitioiis Iiiieri~a1ioi~a/ Seniij,ar 0,1 die yv~s aud n~ea~s of achi~'iiig die ehtiiiiiahoii of die e.vp/oitatioil of child labour iii all parts of die '4'orld </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>(28 October- 8 November 1985) include the following reference: &quot;the exploitation of child labour takes many forms, and certain types of exploitation. for example child prostitution [...J, are particularly abhorrent&quot;. Thus, the interpretation is clearly that child prostitution at least is considered. at the international level. to be a form of exploitative child labour. whilst ILO treaties were not drawn Ul) with the phenomenon of sextial exploitation in mind - 110 more than they were drafted as a means of combating the participation of children in armed conflict - certain ILO standards can nonetheless be deemed of relevance in these regards.</FONT>
<P>
<P>2.1.	<B>ILO Conventions 29 (Forced labour, 1930) and 105 (Abolition of Forced Labour, 1957)</B>
<P>
<P>11~O Conventions 29 and 105 were explicitly referred to in an amendment proposed by Ni2eria to the chapter on &quot;implementation of existing instruments&quot; ofthe revised French
<P>proposal for an optional protocol on the subject at hand (see [.2. below). whilst they do not seem to be of significant direct value as a legal tool for combating commercial sexual exploitation of children on the threshold of the third millennium. Convention 29 (ratified by 136 countries as at I June 1995) at least lends weight to the thesis that any form offorced or compulsory labour undertaken by children has long been the target ofproliibition. TIus Con~~ention sets out a n~ber of conditions tinder wiuch forced or compulsory labour may be exacted - such as conipulsory mihtary sex\ice. normal civic obligations. as a con sequence of conviction in a court of law. emergency situations, etc. - but in so doing it anvway restricts such labour to &quot;able-bodied males who are of an apparent age of not less than 18 and not more than 45 years...&quot; (Art. 11).
<P>
<P>2.2.	<B>ILO Convention 138 (Minimum Age, 1973) and Recommendation 146 (Minimum Age, 1973)</B>
<P>
<P>ILO Convention 138. currently the flagship treaty on child labour, is reflected. and implicitly referred to, in CRC Article 32 (see 1.5. above). However, it suffers from a relatively poor
<P>
<P>
<P><CENTER>5</CENTER>
<P>ratification record: just 46 countries as at 1 June <FONT SIZE=2><I>1995. </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>The thrust of the Convention is the regulation of admission to employment in &quot;branches of econornic activity or... undertakings&quot; listed in its Art. 5, para. 3. Not unnaturally, these are all sectors of formal and recognised enterprise, and the treaty deals with neither seli~ernployment or &quot;non-lucrative&quot; work. As a result, it has no direct application in the field of commercial sexual exploitation. It does serve, however, as a lurther indication of the international community&quot;s attitude towards activities that jeopardise the health and development of children. Mso, presuming that applicants for admission to employment take that step of their own free will, the fact that the treaty requires that a 16-year-old be denied access to employment reserved for those over 18 is a flirther demonstration of the irrelevance of consent as a factor in detenmiung exploitation.</FONT>
<P>
<P>The Minimum Age Recommendation of 1973 supplements Convention 138 by giving more precise policy guidelines for optimal implementation of the treaty at national level.
<P>
<P>3.	REFUGEELAW
<P>
<P>3.1.	1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees
<P>
<P>The number of States Parties to one or both instruments was 130 as at 20 October 1995. whilst the instruments contain no special provision on protection from sexual exploitation. Article 24 of the 1951 Convention is potentially relevant to the present paper in that it reaffirms obligations regarding child labour, stating that &quot;[tjhe Contracting States shall accord to refligees lawfiilly staying in their territory the same treatment as is accorded to nationals in respect of (.~.) minimum age of employment (.~.) and the work of young persons..
<P>
<P>The United Nations High Commissioner for Refligees (IJNHCR) has a general supervisory fiinction under Art. 35 of the 1951 Convention in addition to its mandate to provide international protection to refligees contained in the Statute of the Office.
<P>
<P>3.2.	Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme: Conclusion No.
<P>47 (XXXVIII) of 1987 on Refugee Children
<P>
<P>Although not, of course, binding law, this Conclusion is of interest in that it specifies UNHCR's concern about sexual exploitation of children, conderrining &quot;the exposure of retugee children to physical violence and other violations of their basic rights, iii cluding through sexual abuse, trade in children [...]&quot; and calling for &quot;national and international action to prevent such violations and assist the victims&quot;.
<P>
<P>4.	<FONT SIZE=3><B>INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW</B></FONT>
<P>
<P>Humanitarian law determines what acts are lawtuI in the course of an armed conflict. The applicable rules depend on whether the conflict is considered international (e.g. an inter-State conflict) or non-international (e.g. a civil war).

<P>All prisoners of war, including children, &quot;must be humanely treated&quot; (article 2). Rape or sexual abuse of the inhabitants of a territory under occupatiol) is prohibited under Article 46: &quot;Familv honor and riglits [...] must be respected.&quot; As affirmed in the judgement of the Iliternational Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, the Hague Regulations represent customary inteniational law and as such are binding on all States whether or not they have adhered to tile Convention itself

<P>The 1949 POW Convention developed protection afforded by the 1929 Geneva Conventioii <FONT SIZE=2>011 </FONT><FONT SIZE=3>POWs based on the experiences ofthe Second World War. A POW includes all members of the armed forces, the civilians accompanying those forces, and civilians spontaneously taking up arms to resist an invader. Article 14 ofthe Convention provides that &quot;Prisoners of war are entitled in all circ~stances to respect for their persons and their honour. Women shall be treated with all the regard due to their sex...&quot;. Under Article 52, except for volunteers, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>110 </FONT><FONT SIZE=3>prisoner of war may be employed in labour which is of an unhealthy or dan o~erous nature. The Convention had been ratified by 1 86 countries as at 24 April 1996.</FONT>
<P>
<P>4.3.	1949 Geneva Convention IV <B>Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War</B>
<P>
<P>The 1949 Geneva Convention IV w~s the first international agreement addressing exclusively the treatment of ck4lians in armed conflict. although there had been certain <FONT SIZE=2>provisions </FONT><FONT SIZE=3>to protect civilians included in the Hague Regulations of 1907. It is mainly confined to the protection of civilians in occupied tenitory or </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>in internment </FONT><FONT SIZE=3>and </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>its provisions </FONT><FONT SIZE=3>have been extensively supplemented by Additional Protocol I of 1977. Article 27 of Geneva Convention IV states: &quot;Protected persons are entitled, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>in </FONT><FONT SIZE=3>all circumstances, to respect for their persons. their honour, their family rights... Women shall be especially protected against any attack on their honour, in particular against rape. enforced prostitution. or anv form ofindecent assault.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<P>Furthermore. under Article 5 1, an Occup~g Power may not compel protected persons to work unless they are over 18 years of age. Children are considered protected persons if thev are civilians in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they are not nationals. Nationals of a State not bound by the Convention are not protected persons nor are nationals of a neutral state or co-belligerent State as long as normal diplomatic representation exists in the State in whose hands they are.
<P>
<P>The Convention had been ratified by 186 countries as at 24 April 1996, and many ofits <FONT SIZE=2>provisions represent customary mternational law.</FONT>

<P>
<P>Under article <FONT SIZE=3>75, <B>all children who are in the power of a Party to </B>the conflict and who do not benefit from more favourable treatment under the Conventions of the Protocol shall be treated humanely in all circumstances. Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment, enforced prostitution and any form of indecent assault are prohibited. Article 77 provides that &quot;[c]hildren shall be the object of special respect and shall be protected against any form of indecent assault.&quot;</FONT>

Outrages upon their personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment are prohibited as are violence to life and person. Tlie tnternational Court of Justice affirmed in the Nicaragua case that Common Article 3 <FONT SIZE=2>represents customary international law.</FONT>
<P>
<P>4.6.	Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II)
<P>
<P>Under the fluidamental guarantees in Article 4, all persons not taking a direct part in hostilities or who have ceased to take part in hostilities are entitled to respect for their person and honour and must be protected from &quot;outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment, rape, enforced prostitution and any form of indecent assault&quot; and &quot;slavery and the slave trade in all their forms&quot;. The threshold for applicability of Protocol II is often deemed to be higher than for Common Article 3. <FONT SIZE=2>TIus </FONT><FONT SIZE=3>Protocol had been ratified by 135 countries as at 24 April 1996.</FONT>

<P>5.	INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS IN PREPARATION
<P>
<P>5.1.	Revised 1961 (Hague) Convention on the Protection of Children
<P>
<P>The second reading of the draft revised text of this private international law treaty was effected in September 1995. The final revision should be ready for approval at the Diplomatic Conference scheduled for October 1996. This instrument will deal with the attribution ofjurisdiction, the detennination of applicable law, and the establishment of a system of international cooperation to provide protection for children who are not in their country of habitual resid~ce&quot;. In particular, and in somewhat simplified form, it will mean that a child in need of protective measures while outside that country - such as in the case of a child taken abroad for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation - may benefit from appropriate measures at the initiative of the authorities of the country where he or she is present whether or not the authorities of the country of habitual residence request this and whether or not he or she is a national of either country concerned.
<P>
<P>5.2.	Proposed Optional <B>Protocol </B><FONT SIZE=3>to the Convention on the Rights of the <B>Child</B></FONT>
<P>
<P>By its resolution of 8 March 1995, the Commission on Human Rights decided that &quot;the open-ended inter-sessional working group of the Commission ~...] for the elaboration of guidelines on a possible optional protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child po~ography, shall elaborate [...J a draft optional protocol&quot; on these issues. Proposed drafts already exist, but it is currently difficult to estimate the likely timescale for the formulation and approval of a final text. The protocol will almost certainly deal only with national obligations ~ithin the framework of inteniational cooperation to implement relevant rights in the Convention it will not comprise substantive standard-setting.
<P>
<P>6.	REGIONAL TREATIES
<P>
<P>6.1.	1981 African Charter on iluman and Peoples' Rights
<P>
<P>The treaty entered into force in 1986, and as of <B>1 January </B><FONT SIZE=3>1996, had been ratified by 50 States. Aiiicle <B>5 </B>prohibitS &quot;all forms of exploitation and degradation&quot;, including in particular slavery and the slave trade.</FONT>
<P>
<P>In addition, Article 18.2 obliges States Parties to  ensure the elimination of every discrimination against women and... the protection of the rights of the woman and the child as stipulated in international declarations and conventions.&quot; The implication here is that States that are also parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child would be obliged to implement the provisions of CRC Article 34 as part of their obligations under the Charter.
<P>
<P>6.2.	1990 African Charter on <B>the Rights and Welfare of the Child</B>
<P>
<P>The Charter, having been ratified to date by only six Member States of the OAU, has not yet entered into force (15 ratifications are required for this). It contains provisions on exploitation of child labour, sex'ual exploitation and sale and traflicking. They are essentially similar in effect to their counteiparts in the CRC, but contain a number of additional facets.
<P>
<P><CENTER>9</CENTER>
<P>The Charter's Article XV (Child labour) specifies that the provision 11<FONT SIZE=3>covers both the formal and informal sectors of employment&quot; and makes explicit rather than implicit reference to &quot;the International Labour orga:nisation's instruments relating to children&quot; as a consideration in establisliing &quot;rninimum ages for admission to <I>every </I>employment&quot; (our italics).</FONT>
<P>
<P>Article XXVII of the Charter, in addition to requiring States Parties to &quot;protect the child from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse&quot;, obliges them to &quot;take measures to prevent: (a) the inducement, coercion or encouragement of a child to engage in any sexual activity; (b) the use of children in prostitution or other sexual practices; (c) the use of children in pornographic activities, performances and materials&quot;. In comparison with the counterpart provision in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, therefore, the Charter adds &quot;encouragement&quot; under sub-paragraph (a), removes the qualification of &quot;unlawfiil&quot; sexual activv:y or practices in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), adds pornographic &quot;activities&quot; in sub-paragraph (c), and removes the word &quot;exploitative&quot; before &quot;use&quot; in sub-paragraphs (b) and (c), presurning that any &quot;use&quot; of the child wiU iii itself be exploitative. In principle, therefore, and subject to interpretation, the Charter provides for protection from a somewhat wider range of acts than does the Convention.
<P>
<P>Finally, Article XXIX specifies that States are to combat sale and trafficking &quot;by any person including parents or legal guardians of the child&quot;.
<P>
<P>6.3.	1969 <B>American Convention on Human Rights</B>
<P>
<P>~iis Convention entered into force in 1978, and as at ] January 1996 had been ratified by 25 States. Article 5 stipulates that &quot;[e]very person has the right to have his physical, mental arid moral integrity respected.&quot; Article 6 specifies that &quot;[n]o one shall be subject to slavery or to involuntary servitude, which are prohibited in all their forms, as are the slave trade arid traffic in women.&quot; The Convention flirther provides (Article 19) that &quot;every minor child has the right to the measures of protection required by his condition as a minor, on the part of his family, society and the state.&quot;
<P>
<P>In the 1988 Protocol to this Convention (not in force by January 1996), all work which &quot;jeopardizes health, safety or morals&quot; is prohibited for persons under 18 years of age.
<P>
<P>6.4.	1994 inter-American Convention on International Traffic in Minors
<P>
<P>This treaty was adopted at the <B>Fifth </B><FONT SIZE=3>Inter-American Specialised Conference on Private <B>International Law convened </B>by the Organization of American States (OAS). <B>It </B>is desi~ed to regulate civil and penal aspects ofthe international traffic in minors tlirough international cooperation. It covers &quot;any human being below the age of eighteen&quot; who is the victim of &quot;abduction, removal or retention, or attempted abduction, removal or retention [...J for unlawftil purposes or by unlawfiil means&quot;. The term &quot;unlawfiil purposes&quot; is then defined to include &quot;prostitution, sexual exploitation, servitude...&quot;. It is as yet too early to foresee the impact of this treaty whose ratification will necessarily be limited to OAS members.</FONT>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<P><CENTER>10</CENTER>
<P>6.5.	1950 European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Eundamental Freedoms
<P>
<P>This Convention was the first regional agreement on human rights to be adopted after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and has been in force since 1953. It had been ratified by 3 1 countries as at 1 January 1996. Its main relevant provision is Article 4 which declares that &quot;[nb-one shall be held in slave~' or servitude&quot; and &quot;no-one shall be required to perform forced or compulsory labour&quot;.
<P>
<P>6.6.	1961 European Social Charter
<P>
<P>The Charter, covering the development and protection of social and economic rights is <B>a</B>
<P>complementary instrument to the European Convention on Human Rights. It came into
<P>force in 1965, and had been ratified by 20 countries as at 24 April 1996.
<P>
<P>States Parties to the Charter accept as the aim oftheir policies the attainment of conditions in which certain rights and principles may be effectively realised. These include (Part I, 7):
<P>&quot;Children and young persons have the right to special protection against the physical and moral hazards to which they are exposed.&quot; States flirther undertake to be bound by certain obligations, including (Part II. Art. 7[l0J): &quot;To ensure special protection against physical and moral dan~ers to which children and young persons are exposed, and particularly against those resulting... from their work.&quot;
<P>
<P>6.7.	1991 Recommendation No. <B>R(91)11 of the Committee of Ministers to Member </B><FONT SIZE=3>States of the Council of Europe</FONT>
<P>
<P>This Recommendation. made under Article 15(b) ofthe Statute of the Council of Europe. is ~vo'ih highlighting because it emanates from an organ oftl]e Council which specifically addresses &quot;Sexual Exploitation. Pornography and Prostitution O{ and Trafficking in. Children and Young Adults&quot;. It urges Member States to review legislation and practice with a view to implementing a comprehensive programme of measures to combat the sexual exploitation of children.
<P>
<P>7.	COMMENTS BN' <B>THE COMMITTEE ON THE RIGHTS </B><FONT SIZE=3>OF <B>THE CHILD</B></FONT>
<P>
<P>As its contribution to the Open-ended Working Group of the 52nd Session of the
<P>Commission on Htiinaii Rights concerning the question of the drafting of an Optional
<P>Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (cf 5.2. above), the Committee on
<P>the Rights ofthe Child submitted a paper from which the following elements are extracted:
<P>
<P>&quot;[Tihe importance of [the issues of child prostitution and child pornography and the sale of children for these purposesj as well as the need to draw urgent attention and encourage concerted action to prevent and combat them, are illustrated by the attention paid to them in the course of the dialogue held with States parties on the implementation of the Convention, as well as the decision ofthe Commirtee to devote, in 1993, its second thematic debate to the topic 'economic exploitation of children'.
<P>
<P>
<P><CENTER>11</CENTER>
<P>&quot;But it is important to stress that the Convention has not only identified such situations in an autonomous manner, it has flirther set up a holistic approach for the consideration of the human rights of children. In the <B>light of such an </B><FONT SIZE=3>approach, all rights are recognised as inherent to the human dignity of the child, and the implementation of one right will only be effective when taking into consideration the implementation of; and respect for, all the other rights ofthe child. In a word, the Convention reaftmms tile indivisibility and interdependence of human rights.</FONT>
<P>
<P>&quot;The protection of the child from all forms of exploitation, including from sale, prostitution or pornography should therefore not be seen simply in isolation but in the broader context of the realisation of children's rights and taking in due consideration the international obligations arising from the Convention.
<P>
<P>&quot;These [obligations] show the decisive importance attached by the Convention, as a human rights instrument, to the national process of implementation of children's rights. It turther stresses the special responsibility of States in this regard. These realities were in fact also emphasised by the final document ofthe World Conference on Human Rights, which called on States to integrate the Convention on the Rights of the Child into their national action plans.
<P>
<P>&quot;[T]he reporting system established by the Convention is an essential tool for States parties to ensure a periodic assessment and evaluation of progress achieved in its implementation. It further allows for the improvement of the situation of children and the prevention of violation of their flindamental rights. At the same time, tile dialogue held between States and the Committee on the Rights of the Child plays an important catalytic role in this regard, allowing for the formulation of specific suggestions and recommendations to States parties, identif~ing priority areas for action and encouraging programmes of technical assistance or advice in cooperation ~vith United Nations and other competent bodies.
<P>
<P>&quot;[T]hrough the activities of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities and of its Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery important and comprehensive strategies have been envisaged to ensure the implementation of the different existing legal instruments and to give guidance in relation to specific areas where action should be undertaken, such as legal reform, information, education, social assistance, reintegration and international cooperation. Special reference should be made in this regard to the two progran~es of action adopted by the Commission on Human Rights for the Prevention of tile Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography and for the Elimination of Child Labour. Presently under preparation is a new Prograinme of Action on the Prevention of Traflic in Persons and the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others.
<P>
<P>'~e progress achieved in the implementation of these programmes of action is periodically evaluated both by the Sub-C ommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities and the Commission on Human Rights. The Commission flirther considers the important actMties oftilematic Rapporteurs, as the Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women or the Special Rapporteur on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography who has adopted important recoinmendations on ways to address the areas covered by her mandate.
<P>&quot;It is also interesting to note that the issues of saJe and traflicking in children, child prostitution and child pornography deserve a special attention within the United Nations system-wide action. Mention could be made in this regard to ILO [...] or to the activities developed by UNlCEF i'i the framework of the implementation of the Declaration and Plan of Action adopted by the World Summit for Children.
<P>
<P>&quot;At tile same time, in the area of crime prevention and criminal justice, important steps Ii ave also been taken. Iii fact, the Ninth Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, held last year [1995] in Cairo, called on States to adopt necessary measures aiming at the prevention, protection and rehabilitation of children victims of any form of violence, including sexual violence and sexual exploitation. It further invited the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to consider drafting an international convention on the illicit traffic in children which may embody the necessary elements to effectively combat this form oftransnational organised crime.
<P>
<P>&quot;The Commission soon ensured a follow-up to this invitation and at its fourth session requested the Secretary-General to initiate the process of requesting views of Member States on the elaboration of such an inteniational convention <FONT SIZE=4>[...]. </FONT><FONT SIZE=3>An important standardsetting activity is therefore already wider way within the United Nations system in this area.</FONT>
<P>
<P>&quot;It is lilteresting to note that the Commission further decided to request the Secretar'~'General to organise a meeting of an expert group on the prevention of the sexual exploitation of children for commercial purposes within the context of international travel (sex touflsm).&quot;
<P>
<P>8.	CO.~IMENTAR~
<P>
<P>review oftlie main international instruments covering commercial sexual exploitation of children reveals that, whilst State obligations to combat the phenomenon are relativelv clear. it may be useftil to make a certain nuinber of comments and clarifications.
<P>
<P>a)	Article 34 ofthe Convention on the Rights ofthe Child, the provision central to the present discussion, firstly provides for protection from '1<FONT SIZE=3>unla~l&quot; sexual activity; in so doing, it deliberately leaves each State to enact legislation determining what kinds of activity are to be outlawed and, where appropriate. until what age. The absence of the word &quot;exploitation&quot; in sub-paragraph (a) ofthis article reflects the fact that the focus in this case is more especially &quot;abuse&quot;, and in this context the age of con sent is clearly of major sigiuficance. It would mean that, in a country where age of consent is 1 6 years. a girl of 1 7 wiio is induced (though presumably not &quot;coerced&quot;, to the extent that this invokes obtaining consent by force or manipulation) into sexual intercourse ~~ll not be the subject of protection under this article, wbereas a girl of 1 5 will be. In other words, this provision derogates, by implication, from the overall definition of a &quot;child&quot; for the purposes of this Convention. Sub-paragraphs (b) and (c), on the other hand, are dealing explicitly with &quot;exploitative use&quot;. If we recall the 1949 Convention which provides for protection against <I>expIoiiatio~z </I>through prostitution <I>regardless of whether or P~ot coiiseiit has heei~ give1~, </I>and the 1956 Supplementai~' Convention which sets a flat age of 18 years, it seems clear that in the cases of these</FONT>
<P>
<P><CENTER>13</CENTER>
<P>two sub-paragraphs, the general definition of the child hoJds and the question of consent is ofno relevance in determining whether or not exploitation has taken place and whether or not the child concerned is covered by these provisions.
<P>
<P>b)	International law provides no definition of the term &quot;pornography&quot; (the same applies to &quot;prostitution&quot; but the meaning of this term is more generally accepted and is more amenable to the application of objective and factuaJ criteria and verification).
<P>	c)	Pornography has not received the level of attention that international legislators have
<P>		accorded to protection from prostitution. The amended 1923 Convention covers all
<P>		obscene or pornographic materials but has been virtually dormant for the past two
<P>		decades at least. Current national legislation, practice and attitudes towards adult
<P>		pornography in rnany countries mean that it is unlikely to receive significant additional
<P>		support in the foreseeable future. It is in fact surprising that more countries have not
<P>		followed the example of the Netherlands and denounced it. The explanation perhaps
<P>		lies in the defacto lack of reference that is made to obligations under the treaty and/or
<P>		the development of a more restrictive view of what constitutes &quot;obscenity&quot; and could
<P>		therefore be deemed to be covered by the treaty. Thus, the international legal
<P>		framework provides only a crude basis for taking initiatives to combat the distribution
<P>		of child pornography, whether in the form ofpublications or via new technology.

<P><CENTER>PART II: NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE AND ENFORCEMENT</CENTER>
<P><CENTER>RESPONSES</CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<P>Introduction
<P>
<P>The i'ite~ational norms which emerge from the Conventions and other intemational instmments described in Part I of this paper establish the obligations under international law on States parties in relation to the protection of children from commercial sexual ex~loitation. These obligations then have to be translated into national legislation and into the enforcement mechanisms in each country. Article 34 of the Convention on the Ri~ts of the Child (~the CRC~) for example as has been pointed out in Part I provides for protection from &quot;unlawial&quot; sexual activity leaving it to each State to enact legislation determining what kinds of activity are to be outlawed.
<P>
<P>Part II of this paper examines specific national legislative and procedural provisions bv wiuch some countries have sought to protect children. Such provisions do not exist in a vacuum, but depend for their efficacy on the capacity and will of the executive and of the law euforcement persounel in each jurisdiction to implement them. This Part will therefore ~lso point to problems of enforcement and some solutions. Finally, commercial sexual e\1)loitation of children is part of a complex web of factors. A major part takes place on the national scene. Increasingly it is flourishing in the context of tourism and trans-border activities. It calls for multidisciplinary solutions and cooperation between agencies at the national and international levels. The nature and effectiveness of such cooperation is. therefore, an important issue of concern and discussion in this paper and for follow-up on the national level ofthe work at the World Congress.
<P>
<P>1.	NATIONAL L[GISLATIV[ ANI) PROC~I)U}RAL PROVISIONS
<P>
<P>Domestic legislation protective of children may be found ii) a wide vali&amp;ty of instniments, such as provisions for health care, social welfare. housing. obscenity laws, guardianship and ctistodv. The CRC now provides, for the first time, a comprehensive set of international legal norms for the protection and well-being of children. Ratif,4ng States may have to initiate new legislation or revise existing legislation to achieve these norms and comply with their oblio~ations. It would appear that the Convention has encouraged States to examine their protective provisions in a more compr.hensnie manner than before, but their responses towards enforcemeiit of its provisions will inevitably depend on the maturity of their existing domestic provisions vis-a-vis child care, their own stage of economic development, and the cultural and econoinic criteria wiuch inform their approach to the care of the nation's children.
<P>
<P>1.1.	Offences Involving Children
<P>
<P>In the Philippines, Republic Act 7610, which came into force in 1992, specifically addresses the &quot;Special Protection of Children against Claild Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination&quot; including Child Prostitution a'id other Sexual Abuse (Art.III), Child Trafficking (Art.IV) and Obscene Publications and Indecent Shows (Art.V) The Act also requires the fo~ulation,
<P>
<P><CENTER>15</CENTER>
<P>by the Departments of Justice and of Social Welfare and Development, of a comprehensive programme to protect children against commercial sexual exploitation. Regulations under the Act provide for the reporting and investigation of child abuse cases, and for measures to prevent the trafficking of children. What is highly significant about this legislation is that it was originaHy prepared by a non-gover'nmental group consisting of child protection experts and activists. Through their grass-roots experience, they were able to address the specific problems of Filipino children in the overall context of the governinelit's obligations under the CRC. The Philippine goveflirnent, having requested non-governmental assistance, and having enacted the legislation, achieved as a result concrete legislative provisions and a national policy for the protection of children against commercial sexual exploitation.
<P>
<P>~ die other hand, Brazil's Law No.8069 of 13 July 1990 entitled &quot;Statute oftl)e Child and Adolescent&quot;, which is intended to provide for the &quot;flill protection of the child and adolescent&quot;, has no specific provisions for addressing the commercial sexual exploitation of children. Rather the Act is like a Charter for children, outlinrng fluidamental rights and duties, with policies for enforcement and guidelines for their implementation. It is a matter for the individual State gover'nnents to translate the charter into regulations at local State level.
<P>
<P>In Sri Lanka, ratification of the CRC engendered the formulation of a policy document hi 1992 on the rights of children, intended to lead to comprehensive legislation protective of children. A Technical Committee, appointed to consider legislation directed at child abuse, identified certain areas for reform. However, rather than suggesting a separate Act dealing with sexual offences against children, the Committee recommended amendments to the existing Penal Code and to the Code of Criminal Procedure. Thus, the age of consent was raised from 12 to 16 years, new' offences of sexual exploitation of children and oftrafiickiil2 as well as new offences relating to tile use of children in pornography were created. Significantly, here again, the Technical Committee had iii cluded non-goveill mental representatives who had been actively engaged hi combatting the sexual exploitation of children in Sri Lainka. Through the amendments to the Penal Code, their concerns Ii ave been legislatively addressed in a pragmatic and comprehensive manner.
<P>
<P>In Thailand, the approach to protective legislation has also involved amendments to the Penal Code. There has been a firm governmental commitment since 1993 to elilninate child sexual exploitation. Amendments to the Code at that time provided serious penalties for those who engaged ill the sexual abuse of children and updated the laws on pornography. New amendments this year (1996) ~vil1 mean that while pro stitution <I>per se </I><FONT SIZE=3>will 110 longer be a crime in Thailand, soliciting and publicising for the pu~~oses of prostitution will be punishable. Engaging in prostitution with a person under the age of I 8 will be punishable if the act takes place &quot;in a place of prostitution&quot;. However, if the act takes place elsewhere. the age of consent is <I>15. </I>Boy children continue to lack adequate protection in that rape and unlawful sexual intercourse camiot be committed against male children, by virtue of a judicial interpretation of the provisions of the Code.</FONT>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><CENTER>16</CENTER>
<P>1.2.	Pornography
<P>
<P>The relevance of pornography to the protection of children against commercial sexual exploitaton is not always recognised in legislation despite the specific injunction of Act.34(c)
<P>of the CRC that States must take measures to prevent the exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials. New technologies being used for the production and transmission of pornography have been so rapid in development, and sometimes so difficult to penetrate, that the law has not been able to keep up with them. The experience of police officers in this area has led the Standing Working Party on Offences Against Minors of INTERPOL (~the SWP') to recommend (1995/96) that member countries enact legislation which would make it an offence to produce distribute or possess child pornography in its present and potential future forms. lii January 1995 the Netherlands government passed legislation, amending the Penal Code (Ai~.240b), and making it an offence to distribute, make, import or possess pornographic material depicting children manifestly under the age of 16; transfer or possession of such material on a data canier is included in the offence. In July 1994 the Austrian parliament passed an amendment (section 207a) to the Penal Code to outlaw the trade in child pornography and sanction even the possession of such material. Possession of child pornography is also an offence in Canada, in Germany and Ill the United States. In 1 994 the US Penal Code was amended to allow federal authorities to prosecute persons involved in the production overseas of child pornogi~aphy, ifthat pornography is intended for importation into the United States. In many countries, however, the penalties for offences relating to child pornography are not severe and do not reflect the fact that such pornography is a manifestation of the sexual exploitation of a minor.
<P>
<P>1.3.	Reporting
<P>
<P>An issue for national legislatures concerned with ~ild sexual abuse, ~~ether commercial or othei~se. is that of reporting. The Philippine Regulations wider Republic Act 76 10 encourage the reporting of cases of sexual abuse and impose mandatory reporting
<P>provisions on hospitals, doctors nurses, teachers and law enforcement officials. In some countries there is a reluctance to impose mandatory reportmg duties; experience in the United States showed that a high percentage of cases reported on foot of an imposed duty were unfounded. The SWP, however, has urged the implementation of legislation which would require individuals and specifically professionals and others having the care, custody or control of children to report suspected abuse to the relevant investigative authorities
<P>
<P>1.4.	Extraterritorial Legislation
<P>
<P>While domestic legislation on child commercial sexual exploitation is normally directed to the protection ofthe State's own cl'iidren against abuse by nationals, this type of abuse has international aspects. Sexual exploitation resulting from tourism and forei~ visitors, trafficking of young people across borders to supply brothels in other countries, abductions from one country to another, abuses of intercountry adoption, and even the transfer of pornography via computer networks or simply across borders are all issues which involve other jurisdictions. Responses within national legislatures are varied, depending on how the specific problems affect each jurisdiction. Several countries from which large numbers of
<P>
<P><CENTER>17</CENTER>
<P>tourists are believed to travel to exploit children abroad have responded by introducing legislation to give their domestic courts extraterritorial jurisdiction in respect of offences committed against children abroad. In New Zealand, the Crimes Amendment Act which came into force in Aprll 1995 makes it an offence for a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident to engage in conduct outside of New Zealand with a child under the age of 16 if such conduct would be an offence in New Zealand. Australia's Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Act of 1994 specifies (in section SOBA) that &quot;a person must not, while outside Australia, engage in sexual intercourse with a person who is under 16&quot;. In March 1996 an Australian was convicted under the new legislation of offences committed against children in the Philippines. Extraterritorialjurisdiction for offences committed against children abroad became law in Belgium (April 1995), in France (Febmary 1994) and in Germany (September 1993), all by amendments to each country's Penal Code. The Australian Act and the French and German amendments enable prosecutions to be taken against nationals of those countries even if the crime alleged is not a crime in the jurisdiction in which it was committed; thus, there is no double criminality requirement - the national legislative provisions will protect foreign children.
<P>
<P>The Penal Codes in the Scandinavian countries akeady enabled citizens of those countries to be prosecuted at home for crimes committed abroad without speci~ng the crimes ii] detail. Under such provisions, three men were convicted in August 1990 in Norway for sexual abuse of boys in the Philippines and in Thailand, and a Swedish national was convicted hi Stockholm in June 1995 for offences committed in Thailand.
<P>
<P>The Penal Code in Japan has extraterritorial effect in relation to certain crimes including sexual crimes with violence against children under the age of 13 or persons unable to resist such an attack.
<P>
<P>I 5. Sex lourisni Legislation
<P>
<P>Tourism for the purposes of sex with minors has been dealt with by legislative changes in several countries. In the United States, the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act crirninalises domestic or foreign travel with intent to engage in sexual acts with a juvenile. The 1994 Australian legislation creates the offence of benefitting from or encouraging such travel; the 1995 New Zealand legislation makes similar provisions.
<P>
<P>A different approach is offered in the United Kingdom where a Sexual Offences (Conspiracy and Incitement) Bill was refen~ed in February 1996 by Parliament to a St an ding Committee for consideration. The proposed legislation would make it an offence to conspire with or to incite a person to commit certain sexual offences abroad.
<P>
<P>1.6.	Trafficking or Sale of Children
<P>
<P>The issue of child trafficking has been addressed in the Philippines in Republic Act 76 10 (Art. IV) by provisions which control foreign travel by children and the adoption of children in return for a consideration, as well as any acts of trading and dealing with children for money. In Thailand, proposed amendments to the Penal Code will penalise guardians who sell children in their care. Selling, buying, transporting ofpersons under the age of 18 years
<P>
<P><CENTER>18</CENTER>
<P>for the purposes of unlawfiil sexual gratification will be criminalised by an update to an Act of 1928 (the Trafficking of Women and Girls Act), even if the young person has consented. A feature of the new provisions is that the trafficked person is recognised as a victim and not as an offender. In Sri Lanka, recent amendments to the Penal Code create the offence of &quot;trafficking&quot; in section 360c in terms very similar to those of the Philippine legislation.
<P>
<P>In the industrialised countries, the issue of trafficking is addressed ofien in the context of Immigration. Intercountry adoptions, intercountry marriages, entry of foreign workers, all may involve trafficking. The Council of Europe has suggested' that the activities of artistic, marriage and adoption agencies be supervised, that travel abroad by children be the subject ofsurveillance by iminigration authorities and that young victims of trafficking be assisted and protected. In recent changes to Belgium's Penal Code (April 1995), the traffic in human beings was criminalised. The European Union has responded to the problem of trafficking by expanding the mandate of its Drug Unit (March 1995) to enable that unit to monitor traffic in human beings. The SWP has made several relevant recommendations designed to protect children from being trafficked. These include a recommendation that member countries impose greater supervision and control on intercountry adoptions, and that a data base be established with records of persons and organisations who have been found to be involved in the traffic of children. Reflecting the Council of Europe Recommendation, the SWP also recommends increased surveillance by immigration authorities and assistance to the victims ofiraflicking.

<P>1.7.	Procedures and the Child Witness
<P>
<P>It is generally accepted that there is considerable difficulty in prosecuting cases with an lilt ern ati on al dimension. Differences in language, legal systems, procedural requirements, and the expense ofbringing witilesses from abroad are some ofthe problems. In the context of legislating to protect children against sexual exploitation by nationals abroad. these difficulties have been relied upon by the British government in refusing to accept a Bill which would give UK courts extraterritorial jurisdiction for offences committed against children abroad. ~ the other hand, certain governments have adopted creative responses to the difficulties. such as the Australian government. The Australian courts are empowered under the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Act 1994 to take evidence by video link. and can even administer oaths and affirmations by video link.
<P>
<P>l~ocedural difficulties are endemic in any case involving sexual exploitation of a child, and not only those with an international dimension. The Children in Trouble; Expert Group Meeting2 <FONT SIZE=3>in November 1994 in Vienna addressed some of the issues, and particular]', in Paii V of its report, dealing with the Exploitation of Children, urged that sanctions for sexual exploitation of children be applied against the adults rather than the child victims, and thai ~exually exploited children be given access to the mechanisms ofjustice, such as legal aid. safe housing and support services. In Canada, reforms in the criminal law have recognised that children can be just as credible and reliable witnesses as adults; the special needs of child victim~wi~esses have also been accommodated in the criminal justice system.

<P>
<P><CENTER>19</CENTER>
<P>in getting a case to trial, the lack of family or institutional support, the age of the child and his or her lack of education rnay all conspire to undermine the quality of a child's evidence. The provision of a guardian <I>ad litem </I><FONT SIZE=3>for a child witness could ease the burden on the child and protect his or her interests. In the Philippines, under the Rules and Regulations on the Reporting and Investigation of Child Abuse cases, a guardian <I>ad i/tern </I>must be appointed by the court as soon as a complaint of child abuse has been filed.</FONT>
<P>
<P>Some interesting changes are envisaged in the Thai Criminal Procedure Code which would ease the burden on the child of giving evidence. The proposed changes include the videotaping of a child's statement to police officers and the use of that video as evidence in court. Cross-examination of the child on the contents of the video will oniy be allowed through a psychiatrist. Provision is also proposed for pre-trial depositions by victims who may be vulnerable to de~ys in the proceedings, such as street children. Oiice the deposition has been taken, and the alleged offender has had an opportunity to confront the witness. the deposition can be used in court. The problems of undue influence on the child and of detaining the child until the trial may thus be avoided.
<P>
<P>The Evidence Act in New Zealand was amended in 1989 to provide some flexibility to judges in the taking of evidence in child sex abuse cases. The judge can take the advice of relevant qualified persons as to the effect on the child of giving evidence, and can direct the admission of video-tape evidence, or the giving of evidence by closed-circuit television. Other jurisdictions have similar provisions; it appears to be generally accepted that child witnesses need to be protected from the trauma of court proceedings and of confronting their abuser. Where the abused child is a street child or a trafficked child, the proof of his or her age can be a problem. The Australian Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Act 1994 makes provision for alternative methods of proving the age of a person under the age of 16, such as by appearance or from medical opinion.
<P>
<P>1.8.	Rights of the Accused
<P>
<P>There are difficulties in reconciling the rights of the accused witi] the rights of the child to protection. 'Ii relation to bail, for example, it has been seen that child exploiters arrested in a foreign jurisdiction are very likely tojump bail; yet to refuse them bail would be to inflinge their basic right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty. Either the offence has to be categorised as serious enough to automatically deprive the accused of bail, or the prosecution has to oppose bail on the grounds that the accused is foreign and therefore very likely to leave thejurisdiction. In relation to proof of an offence, and given the difficulty of actually finding a criminal in the very act of abusing a child, there appears to be merit in shifting the burden ofproof when the protection of a child is at issue, and in so framing the laws that the onus is on the accused tojustif~ his being in the company of a child who is not a relative. Thus in the Philippines, under the provisions of Republic Act 7610, merely to be found alone with a child who is not a relative inside a hotel or vehicle or other place constitutes an attempt to commit prostitution, and an offence under Article III, section 6. Under section <I>5(a), </I><FONT SIZE=3>the mere verbal offer of a child for the purposes of prostitution constitutes the offence of sexual abuse.</FONT>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><CENTER>20</CENTER>
<P>2.	ENFORCEMENT AND PREVENTION ON TilE NATIONAL LEVEL
<P>
<P>Legislation and procedural measures are not enough in themselves to protect children from commercial sexual exploitation. The laws must be enforced. The principal agencies for their enforcement will be the police and immigration officials, and the prosecution and judicial authorities. How effectively these authorities flinction will depend not ouly on the resources made available to them, but also on the extent to which the society in which they carry out their duties regards the protection of ch~dren as important. ~y is it, for example, that many child exploiters will travel to another co~try and feel themselves immune from
<P>prosecution for acts which they would be afraid to commit in their o~vri jurisdictions? ~y is it that in some societies there is a high level of tolerance of adults securing sexual gratification from children? Why is it that in some countries the police seem not even to luiow. that there are laws against sexual exploitation of cluIdren. or do not know ~~at those laws say? In some countries, children are available to be exploited by forei~ers because they are already abused on a massive scale by their o~ nationals. If society does not place a high value on the iiation's children and demand that the law is enforced in their interests then public officials will not be effective.
<P>
<P>There f~)llow a number of suggestions arising from the experiences in various countries of enforcing the law to protect childreii from sexual exploitation wiuch point to ways in ~ich enforcement could be improved.
<P>
<P>2.1.	Central Authoritv
<P>
<P>In the Pl)ilil)l)ines there is an inter-agency Task Force against Child Abuse <FONT SIZE=1><B>under </B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>the i)ep ailment of Justice with re51)onsibility for the prosecution of child abuse cases. As a result. there have been a number of successfiil prosecutions. and this has in tuTu increased</FONT>
<P>public confidence in the office and has increased tile level of reporting. In Thailand, a Child Rigl~ts Piotection [)i~ision has been established within the office of the Attorney General to monitor child sexual abuse cases.
<P>
<P>2.2.	~pecial Child Care <B>~nits in the </B><FONT SIZE=3>Police Force</FONT>
<P>
<P>In the United Kingdom, a special Paedophile Unit at New Scotland Yard tracks do~~ii offbnders agailist children. It has a mandate to be proactive for the protection of children. and therefore has a considerable amount of flexibility in finding ways to prevent abuse. rather than only reacting to actual con)plaints. UnfoliLmately it is the only unit for the entire coLlntI~.
<P>
<P>In this context it can be noted that the Beijing Rules3 <FONT SIZE=3>recommeud specialisation within national police forces of police officers who frequently or exclusively deal with juveniles, and that the Economic and Social Comicil requested the Secretai~ General of the United Nations (Res. 1989/66) in May 1989 to &quot;ensure effective programme interhnkages within the United Nations system between juvenile justice, within the framework of the Beijing Rules,</FONT>

<P>
<P><CENTER>21</CENTER>
<P>and situations of 'social risk', especially  child abuse, child sale and trafficking, child prostitution and street children.&quot;
<P>
<P>2.3.	Status, Training and Resources of <B>Police Authorities</B>
<P>
<P>In many co~tries the laws ca~ot be effectively enforced because the police forces are corrupt. The reasons for this may be partly to do with a society which places a low value on respect for the law, but they are also to do witb poor pay, poor working conditions and
<P>promotional structures which are not based on merit or ability. In Sri Lanka, the emphasis by the government on economic development through tourism is said to have made the
<P>police reluctant to implement the laws against child abusers in case this would have a negative iflipact on the country's economy and thus weaken their chances of promotion. In the Philippines, child abusers have &quot;escaped&quot; from police custody in circumstances which indicate that bribery of police officials had occurred. There are many such reports about many countries. Sexual offences against children must be treated as serious crimes, and police officers must be recogtiised and rewarded for detection of such crimes in the same manner as they would be for the detection of any other serious crimes.
<P>
<P>Adequate training of police and prosecuting officers is essential for the handlin~ of child sexual abuse cases. Some industrialised countries such as the United Kingdom, Sweden, Australia and New Zealand have given overseas aid to developing countries in the forni of training for police officers.
<P>
<P>~inally. the police must be adequately resourced in ternis of manpower. equipment and back-up sei~ices to enable them to do their job properly. They will not be encouraged to rescue children from brothels ifthey have nowhere to bring them or <FONT SIZE=1><B>110 </B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>means to return them to their families; they cannot track down exploiters unless they have adequate means of tran sport and communication.</FONT>
<P>
<P>2.4.	~Iissing Children Registries
<P>
<P>Missing children may not always be identified as the possible victims of sexual exploitation. The role of the police forces has been to find such children and restore them to their families. However, it is now being recogiused that such children may have been running away from abuse or exploitation, and that they should not be returned without some investigation of the reasons for their disappearance. The SWP has recommended the establishmetit of speciahsed c~tres in every country where such children may be de-briefed and cared for before the question of return to their families is settled. The SWP has also recommended that children missing for more than 6 months should be made the subject of international Missing Persons Notices at INTERPOL headquarters.
<P>
<P>2.5.	Customs Surveillance
<P>
<P>The valuable role wlijch the Customs Se~ces can provide in detecting and preventing child exploitation is gaining reco~ition. In cases <FONT SIZE=1><B>in </B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>which the customs services have worked ~ith the police in follovving Ul) on a seizure of illegally imported pornographic material, important tinds have been made, even leading to the cracking of whole paedophile networks. In New</FONT>
<P>
<P>
<P><CENTER>22</CENTER>
<P><CENTER></CENTER>
<P>Zealand, a Customs Child Pornography Project was established in 1992. The work of the Project involves the interception of child pornography or other child exploiter-related intelligence in the process of nornial customs' surveillance, and then foliowng up on those interceptions in cooperation with the police. The US Customs Service has a Child Pornography and Protection Unit which has been operating effectively for many years. The Paedophile Unit in the UK police force works in close coperation with the customs authorities.
<P>
<P>2.6.	Telephone Help Lines
<P>
<P>Telephone Help Lines for children are increasingly recognised as a valuable way in which children can seek help against sexual abuse and exploitation. The SWP has recommended that all member countries institute such Help Lines.
<P>
<P>2.7.	Interdisciplinary Approach to <B>Law Enforcement</B>
<P>
<P>It is not wiusual for several government agencies to become involved with an exploited or abused child. Police. social welfare, education and health authorities may all have a re9)onsibility, and liaison between diem would occur. k Britain, liaison between such bodies is mandator,'. w'iat is not the no~, however, is cooperation between official bodies and NGOs. Thailand is experimenting with such cooperation through its Child Rights Division in the Atto~ey General's office, which has developed a network that includes nongovernmental representat~es. In Canada, provincial/territorial governments, police and nongovernmental organisatiolis have been working on improving the sharing of info~ation between the authorities and NGOs in relation to child sexual abuse. (This was particularly aimed at enabling NGOs. and other employers who hire people to care for children, to screen out kii own sex offenders.)
<P>
<P>Experience has sho~ii that state authorities have neither the resources nor the time to monitor situations in ~ich there may be sex'ual exploitation of children. ~ile they should in no way replace the national law enforcement authorities. child-care NGOs are uniquely capable not only of caring for abused children, but also of detecting abuse and of gathering evidence on ~ich an offence may be successfiilly prosecuted. Several successflil
<P>prosecutions iii the Philippines and in Thailand have been based on evidence gathered or detected by NGOs. Unfoitwiately. in most cases, the financial resources of NGOs caring for sexually abused and exploited children are woeflilly inadequate.
<P>
<P>The UN Expert Group Meeting developed a series of recommendations to combat the use of children for criminal activities and the exploitation of children which went beyond law enforcement. Among these recommendations are suggestions for engaging the mass media in awareness-raising activities, the development of educational programnies and multidisciplinary training programmes, the development of &quot;community watch&quot; programmes, and the engagement of the tourist industry and the business sector in protecting the rights of children. In Australia and New Zealand, the tourist industry has participated in the distribution of information leaflets which warn travellers that sexual exploitation of children abroad is a serious offence.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><CENTER>23</CENTER>
<P>3.	PUNISHMENT AND DETERRENCE
<P>
<P>The penalties for child sexual abuse and exploitation are quite severe in most countries. Iii cases invo~ing extraterritorial jurisdiction there is a question of whether the crimes should be classified as minor, thereby making them more susceptible to being successflill~ prosecuted, or as serious, thereby making them more susceptible to the imposition of a hea\~ penalty. In France, in February 1994, extraterritorial jurisdiction was extended to tile offence of enga~g in sexual conduct with a person under the age of 15 by an amendment to the French Penal Code;, it is die only offence which can be tried as a misdeineanour ~der France's extraterritorial jurisdiction. As a misdemeanour, successlul prosecution is likely to be easier than for an act classified as a serious offence.
<P>
<P>rn the other hand, there is a risk that offences against foreign children will be seen as less serious than the same offences committed against nationals if the penalties are less severe for a crime committed abroad. In Norway, three men convicted in 1990 of offences committed against foreign children received custodial sentences; the Supreme Court of Norway rejected a defence argument that the punishment should be less severe than it would be for crimes against Norwegian children. In Sweden in 1995, a man received a custodial sentence of3 months and had to pay compensation to the foreign child lie had abused; it has been suggested in relation to that case that the penalty would have been greater if the abused child had been Swedish. In the same year, in Thailand, a British Guyana citizen was sentenced to a total of 50 years in prison for offences committed against 5 Thai boys.
<P>
<P>The degree of injury to the child would normally be a consideration for any court which prepares to sentence a convicted offender. But does a court have to be actually presented with evidence of physical or psycliological injury - a requirement with which it would be difficult to comply ifthe child is a foreigner? Should there iii stead be a judicial presuniption that all sexual exploitation of a child is damaging to the child? If the abuse has resulted in a child being infected with the HIV or AIDS virus, should this be an additional aggravating circumstance justif~ng increased penalties? The payment of financial compensation to a child victim has the l)osit~e advantage of permitting the child a fresh start in life, particularly if the child has been driven by poverty into prostitution.
<P>
<P>~ere is a serious problem of recidivism particularly in relation to offenders wiio could be classified as paedophiles (i.e. persons for whom children are the prefened sexual partner). When discussing penalties for such offenders, the question arises as to w~ether penalties on them should continue after the seiyice of their sentence and/or the payment of their fines. The SWP has recommended that countries consider whether persons who have been convicted of sexual offences against minors should be subjected to registration and restriction oftheir activities ifthe latter place them in contact with children. It is a iliatter of concern that paedophile abusers will often insert themselves in employment or social situations which allow them to have access to children. Iii Canada, amendments to the Criminal Code (section 161) iii August 1993 enable a court to il'npose a prohibition order on a convicted sex offender which will prohibit him from attending places where children congregate, or from seeking employment which involves being in a position of trust or authority towards children.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><CENTER>24</CENTER>
<P>Indeed, paedophiles have even been known to establish their own '~child care&quot; organisations as a front for their unlawfiil activities It is therefore important that institutions which care for children should themselves require to be registered and supervised by a competent authority. Furthermore, it has been suggested that persons applying for positions of eniployment in institutions which are responsible for the care of children should be required to produce a clean police record as part of their job application. Volunteers for work with child-care agencies in developing countries should be required to produce references which can be checked with domestic agencies in their countries of origin.
<P>
<P>4.	ENF'ORCEMENT AND PREVENTION THROUGH INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
<P>
<P>Given the international dimensions of sexual exploitation of children in today's world, cooperation between governmental law enforcement agencies and cooperation through the inter-governmental police agency INTERPOL, is vitally important. Such cooperation should develop simplified procedures so that the problems of language and differing legal systems can be minimised.
<P>
<P>4.1.	Information Sharing via <B>INTERPOL and Bilateral Contacts</B>
<P>
<P>INTERPOL already maintains a database of criminals, and die SWP has recornmended nicreased and improved sharing of i'iformation for the database in respect of individuals and organisations involved in the traffic of children, child pornography and die sexual exploitation of children.
<P>
<P>The extent to which extraterritorial legislation is being extended to cover sexual offences against children committed in anotlier country has been detailed above. Its effective application requires cooperation between prosecuting authorities in relation to the gatliering and presentation ofevidence.
<P>
<P>Bilateral contacts between police forces and customs authorities have already proved eilbctive in identi~in g paedophile networks witli worldwide comiections.
<P>
<P>4.2.	<B>Ni utual </B><FONT SIZE=3>Assistance Treaties</FONT>
<P>
<P>Mutual assistance treaties are a vehicle for more formal methods of cominunlcation. Bv reducing into the form of a ~vritten agreement the rules whicli will be observed for sud) things as die taking of statements from witnesses, the provision of records and other evidence, die se~ice of documents etc.. the evidential quality of the material is assured. and the delays inherent in diplomatic channels of communication are avoided. ~e UN Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch has drafted a Model Treaty on Mutual Assistance which w~s adopted by the General Asembly in December 1 990~ and is available as a resource to all states. National laws can also provide unilaterally for the conditions under which mutual assistance will be extended to other states iii criminal matters. Thai Law
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>GA 45/1 17
<P>
<P><CENTER>25</CENTER>
<P>BF2535 entitled 'The Act on Mutual Assistance in Crirninal Matters' sets out the conditions under which assistance may be extended to requesting states, even without a treaty.
<P>
<P>4.3.	Extradition
<P>
<P>Extradition is anotlier vehicle for international cooperation in criminal matters. Some countries would prefer to extradite a child exploiter back to the country in which the offence was committed. It is generally believed that a treaty is necessary betwen two countries before a national of one can be extradited to the other. However, this is not the case for many European states which have national laws determimng the conditions under which nationals will be extradited to face charges in another State. A Model Treaty on Extradition, again drafted by die UN Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch and also adopted by the General Assembly in December I 990~, is available as a resource to all States. In Germany, extradition to States with which there is no bilateral extradition treaty is streamlined by the use of &quot; agreements&quot; which require only a fraction of the ml) Lit necessal',' in the negotiation of a treaty. For each individual case it is then only necessary to refer to the terms of the agreed arrangements.
<P>
<P>4.4.	Police Liaison Officers
<P>
<P>A cooperative method of preventing or assisting in the detection of crimes of sexual exploitation of children is the placement by States of Police Liaison Officers 'ii countries to which their nationals travel in large numbers. Liaison officers have been used in the fight against drug trafficking for some time, and there is a strong demand from the nongovernmental sector that such officers be placed for the purposes of coinbatting child sexual exploitation. There is a view that officers placed to combat child sexual exploitation must be specialised for that field of enquiry, and should not be also combatting the drugs trade or other serious crime. The UK National Crime Intelligence Service (NCIS) has suggested that &quot;Crime&quot; Liaison Officers be placed in certain countries, available for all criminal investigations. The SWP has, however, recommended the posting of specialised officers.
<P>
<P>4.5.	Developnient Aid
<P>
<P>International cooperation via development aid to promote child protection has also already been mentioned. Such assistance, if used for training, can have long-term effects on the capacity and understanding of law enforcement officials in combatting sexual crimes against children.
<P>
<P>5.	<B>CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
<P>It must be realised that the legal environment reflects the political environment, and that unless a State and its society give priority to the protection of children, the laws will not protect them. The will to protect children must first be there.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>GA 45/116
<P>
<P><CENTER>26</CENTER>
<P>This Paper has attempted to identity the legal norms which have set the standards to be observed, and to look in a general way at the responses from national legislatures, also taking into account the enforcement and implementation mechanisms which are available.
<P>
<P>It is hoped that States, in formulating their own national plans, will be able to draw on the experiences outlined in this paper and find solutions in the interests of their own and die world's children.
<P>
<P>In order to foster the most effective implementation of the CRC in this sphere, the following proposals are made:
<P>
<P>It is suggested that the reporting obligations in Article 44 of the CRC be used by States, not just to fulfill their legal obligations under the Convention, but as an opportunity for a thorough analysis and review of their national legislative provisions for the protection of children. This work should be done with the active participation of non-governmental organisations who are involved in the care of children, as well as with those departments of state which have responsibilities affecting children, and those that ensure compliance with inteniational treaty obligations. Through such an interdisciplinary review, legislative gaps in child protection could be identified. A national plan could then be prepared to address in a comprehensive way, through legislation, the needs of children Ill each State.
<P>
<P>Secondly it is suggested that a Task Group, again including NGOs as well as law enforcement personliel and child care authorities, be established in each State to identify or
<P>propose effectk~e mechanisms within the jurisdiction to monitor and combat sexual exi,loitation of children. Monitoring of children at risk, care of abused children, evidence~athering against child abusers. protection of child witnesses all these are tasks for w~ich mechanisms must be devised to respond to local problems and local needs.
<P>Flually. it
<P>5 suggested that in each State. an Ombudsman for children, or an institution or body flilfilling similar ti~nctions, be appointed with responsibility not only to receive and deal with complaints from children. but also to advise the goveniment on problems affecting children in general with in the jurisdiction and to recommend solutions.
<P>
<P>These are some ways by which a practical start could be made in securing better iniplementation ofthe provisions ofthe Convention on the Rights ofthe Child.

<P>
<P>~~hey should also study the possibility of establishing bilateral agre~ents between countries in order to facilitatc legal proc~edings and the gathering of evidence. Thereby making it easier to detect tourism centred on the sexual exploitation ~d prostitution of eh~ldren so that measures to put an end to such practices can be taken.

The network of existing Interpol Specialist Liaison orneers should not be overlooked.
<P>

<P>It is recommended that Interpol member countncs increase and improve tl~e sharin&amp; of info~nation via ~e (~enera1 Secretaria~ by a better use of the Interpol dat~ base. Thi~ will enable a record to be created wich will assist to identify ~d proscc'~e individuals or orgai~isations involved in tra~c of cA~i1dren, child pornography and ~exual <I>exploitation </I>of children.

<P>
<P>It is r~c~mmended that member countries which have not yet done so, institute a loll free telephone number for the reporting of criminal o~e~ees comrnitL~d against minors allowing callers to remain anonymous if they wish.
<P>
<P>F - Lez';slation and cnforc~rnent

<P>All Irterpol rn~ber countries are urged to review, and where necessary, improve or irnpl~:~ent guidelines that assist all individuals~ sp~~i]cal!y all professioni~als, arid otlier pc~sons who have care~ eus~ody or control of children, to forward inforn,ation about any suspec'~ed abuse of~ aiid/or erimiiial offene~~ against, children to an oppropriate identuted agency.
<P>Within the fundamental principics of Human Rights and national and intcrnational law, u~d wit]i a view to protecting childre,&#163; from scxual cxploitation and the prcv~ntion of recurring offences1 it is r~commended that member countries should cxaminc the fcasibiliiy of introducing legislation requirin~ the registration of, and the restriction in the activities1 of persons convicted of sex o~Tences against or m'volving children. The requirement for regist~~tion involves notitication to the local police of the home address of the convicted person and movements thereaf~cr. ~ restriction in activities is aimed at preventing a convicted person from involveme,~t with children in cmploycment or in social or voluntary capacities. To ensure the e~ectiveness of such legislation and in the wider context of protection of children generally, sysi~ms should be developed which enable ai~ reasonnabl~ person or authority (in considering the suitability of a person who it is proposed will have unsupervised access to <I>children), </I>to obtain details of any relevant previous convictions, or indeed any other relevant information concerning that individual.

<P>
<P>G Missing children
<P>
<P>It is recommended to all member countries that all international cases of missing children and all cases of children reported missing for more than six month, which have not been previously reported under other criteria, should be reportetl to the General Secretariat ~nd that they could then be the subject of international missing person notices.
<P>
<P>The General Secretariat is asked to co-operate with the United Nations and other competent bodies in determining measures for dealing with eases involving missing children.
<P>
<P>T]icy should consider the settin~ up of specialised IJnits to deal with cases of missin~ children and re~uest assis~nce from centres which already exist in order to use them as examples. Multi-disc;plinary c~operation has to be ~couraged for the be~erit of such new units.

<P>
<P>Within the concept of the United ~ations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that the best interest of the child should prevail above all other considerations, Inte~pol member countries ar: urged to increase survci~Iancc by immigration autliorities and law enforcement in order to ensure that travel abroad by children, cspecially those not accompanied by their parent or guardian. is riot related to tra~cking in ]~um~ 13cings aiid 10 pr~~ent the possibility that they will be led into prostitution or other forms of sexual abuse.
<P>
<P>When it is determined that ille~ai child tr~cking is takin~ plaec, meAlber countries should establish fae~lities or support those that exist, in order to protect and assist the victims of tr~ eking.

<P>
<P>INTRODUCTION
<P>
<P>Children aren 't considered &quot;hot topics&quot; for the media, not unless children figure in a scandalous or heart-rending story or in some shocking data or statistics.
<P>
<P>This conclusion by media and child experts in the United States holds as true today as ever. If child abuse and exploitation have figured prominently in the mainstream media in recent years, it has invariably been in the context of horrifying evidence from court proceedings, or better still, the involvement of some well-known (adult) public figure. American researchers have found that although children under 10 made up almost 20% of the US population, they represented only one in every 60 characters on primetime TV. Children's voices are not heard - especially not by the rest of the community. But then <FONT SIZE=3><I>the world of television is not like the real world. Its demography reflects its purposes: to produce audiences for advertisers. L)oking at it through tile prism of age reveals a population curve that, unlike the real world, but much like the curve of consumer spending, bulges in the middle years of life. That makes children and the elderly relatively neglected.2</I></FONT>
<P>
<P>This analysis of the impact of the free-market is one aspect of prevailing currents of control of media and information sources. Another is the tendency of some governments and state authorities to manipulate information, usually through tight state controls of broadcasting media, to meet political imperatives which ofien do not reflect the considered needs and rights of abused sections of the population.
<P>It is in this context that media coverage of the commercial sexual exploitation of children, like the other aspects of children's lives, takes place. The media industry is either a commercial undertaking which exists to produce profit, never more so than today with the growth in media outlets, achieved through new technology, bringing ruthless competition for limited markets, or it may be subject to political and state controls. In either case, journalists and media workers struggle to maintain a professional centre of gravity. In reality, it is futile for them to ignore the economic and political conditions in which they work.
<P>
<P>Yet media are, unarguably, a major influence on cultural development throughout the world; with a responsibility, many believe, particularly in sectors like public broadcasting, to inform and to educate. The challenge facing media professionals, whether they own newspapers or broadcast media or whether they are employed to gather, edit and disseminate information, is to define rules and regulations by which they work and to articulate principles of performance which are transparent and can be tested in a public manner.
<P>
<P>But how? The question, as this paper tries to consider, requires serious examination of the way media work, of how existing principles of accountability apply, and how media must be freed from reins of political and economic control which limit professionalism and undermine ethical standards.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>The media's role in the evolution of  commercial sexual exploitation is complex. On the one hand, they tell the stories of abused and abuser, through news reports, photographs, documentaries, and drama. But on the other, they can themselves become the exploiter, for instance by creating sexually provocative images of children in news or advertising, or, at worst, as the vehicle for child pornography, or sources of information for paedophile networks and sexual tourism.
<P>
<P>Furthermore, the way the media portray children has a profound impact on society's attitude to children and childhood, which also affects the way adults behave. Even the images children themselves see, especially of sex and violence, influence their expectation of their role in life.
<P>
<P>This paper does not seek to provide easy answers to complex and difficult issues nor to ethical dilemmas. But there are standards to be set and guidelines which media cdn adopt themselves in addressing the need for a public information policy which provides people with extensive, reliable and ethical reportage about the way children are treated in society. Some suggestions are made in this direction throughout this report and in its conclusions.
<P>
<P>Finally, although there is much that can be improved in media performance, the conclusions are not onlv intended to make media more accountable and journalists more responsive to svstems of complaint and public scrutiny. It is also a question of cncoura~inL~ debate within media about the portrayal of children and their exploitation. This is an issue which defines the good health of a just and decent society and is, ~herefore, a matter of profound professional concern for all who work in media.
<P>
<P>
<P>1.	MEDIA, CHILDREN <FONT SIZE=2><B>AND INTERNATIONAL LAW</B></FONT>
<P>
<P>The international legislative and regulatory framework relevant to the role of media and the commercial sexual exploitation of children is ample, but not specific. These clauses do not constitute an exhaustive list, but offer some important pointers on the role and responsibility of journalists, and the media in general. For example:
<P>
<P>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child <FONT SIZE=3>(1989) enshrines children's right to freedom of expression (Article 13); to protection of privacy and a~ainst attacks on his/her <I>honour and reputation </I>(Article 16); and also calls on the mass media <I>to disseminate information and material of social and cultural benefit to the child </I>(Article 17). Articles 34 and 36 commit governments to protecting children from all forms of exploitation, including pornography.</FONT>
<P>
<P>The European Convention on the Exercise of Children's Rights <FONT SIZE=3>(1996) also emphasises children's right to express their own views in decisions affecting them, and calls on national bodies to provide information on children's rights to the media.</FONT>
<P>
<P>The Council of Europe Recommendation 1286 on a European Strategy for Children <FONT SIZE=3>(1996) introduces the call for </FONT>a <FONT SIZE=3>change in the way children are viewed in society. The media should <I>promote children '5 right to a healihy and balanced development , </I>and all professionals who come into contact with children should have special training on children's rights (Article 8).</FONT>
<P>4
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>The publicising of children '5 rights is a first step to increase public awareness and promote change in the traditional view of the child, <FONT SIZE=3>declared the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly3. It highlighted the negative effects of the media on children, and  wanted to see more controls over new information and communications technologies.</FONT>
<P>
<P>The Council of Europe's Recommendation No.R (91)11, concerning Sexual Exploitation, Pornography and Prostitution <FONT SIZE=3><I>of, </I></FONT>and trafficking in, Children and Young Adults, <FONT SIZE=3>is an important one. It highlights the media's role in reporting this issue by inviting them <I>to contribute to a general awareness of the subject and to adopt appropriate rules of conduct. </I>It also warns against the abuse of children's images and voices in an erotic context. On the matter of law, it judges that while the public should be informed about the conviction of child pornographers, the identity of victims and alleged offenders should be protected. And it demands an end to publicity for sex tourism.</FONT>
<P>
<P>The Council of Europe Recommendation No.R (85)11 on the Position of the Victim in the Framework of Criminal Law and Procedure <FONT SIZE=3>draws attention to the</FONT>
<P>interests of the victim, and the need <FONT SIZE=2><B>10 </B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>protect him/her <I>from any publicity which will unduly affect his </I>(sic) <I>private life or dignity'. </I>And </FONT>Recommendations No.R (92)19 <FONT SIZE=3>and No.R (89) 7 focus, inter alia, on the use of new information technologies for the distribution of pornography.</FONT>
<P>
<P>European Union legislation also refers to the issue in its 1989 Television without Frontiers <FONT SIZE=3>Directive, (Article 22) which bans programmes which might <I>seriously impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors, in particular those that invok'e pornography or gratuitous viok~ce. </I>Yet it provides a get-out for broadcasters who select broadcast times or use technical measures to ensure that minors would not <I>normally </I>have access to the programmes.</FONT>
<P>
<P>
<P>2.	RISING AWARENESS OR SENSATIONALISING: A Two-EDGED MEDIA KNIFE
<P>
<P>The important role which media can play in raising public awareness of the abuse of children and in combatting all forms of criminal and sexual exploitation is well understood. But the issue is not as clear cut as many would like; media coverage can shine the spotlight on those directly responsible, but the victims all too often are also caught in the glare of publicity.
<P>
<P>In the report of the Council of Europe's Committee on Crime Problems4<FONT SIZE=3>, the experts emphasised <I>the responsibility of the media and their potential contribution to any policy aimed at preventing the sexual exploitation of children and young adults. The term media denotes here any means of expression transmitting a message for individuals or groups. In its broad sense therefore, the term covers means used for</I></FONT>

<P>conveying information, such as the prin ted press, books, radio, television, videograms and advertisements; it also includes the &quot;producers&quot; who use such media ~ublishing firms, radio and television companies and advertising agencies etc).
<P>
<P>The Committee of experts warned:
<P>
<P>Ofien the mass media function as a two-edged knife in this area of concern. The unravelling of sensational sex and crime cases involving children and young adults tends to overemphasise the issue and to blur the picture. Sometimes, though, it is the media which help to uncover cases of sexual exploitation and to raise awareness of the problem.
<P>
<P>But it is also the media that generally infiltrate the public with liberal and tolerant attitudes towards child pornography and prostitution or provide the ways and means ~or example advertisements) by which this sex gratification may be achieved. Therefore, their co-operation and their orientation towards safeguarding the rights and the dignity of children and young adults is extremely important.
<P>
<P>In February 1996, the <FONT SIZE=3><I>G~aTdian </I>newspaper printed a two-page article by the award-winning reporter Maggie O'Kane. It described the life, and death, of girl prostitutes on the streets of Bradford, in England. It was a sensitive, perhaps overlyemotive, yet gripping piece of writing; accompanied by a useful set of proposals for supporting the street kids'. Next to it, was a sizeabie photograph of an anonvmous 13-year-old prostitute, with her shirt open to her waist.</FONT>
<P>
<P>This was the angle which alarmed Eva Aurland, Youth Coordinator of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, which has launched a major campaign against child labour. She condemns the picture as sensationalist and unnecessary. Her view is shared by Rachel O~Brien of the Children's Society in the UK, which helped with O'Kane's investigation. Child abuse victims in homes would not be photographed, their identity would be protected, she argues. Yet once on the streets, although they are -- in the law's eyes -- suffering assault every day, they are fair game'.
<P>
<P>It cannot be denied that the media play a crucial role in bringing the horrors of child exploitation into the public arena, and can be extremely influential. American research reveals that 72% of the public obtained knowledge of child abuse from newspapers, <FONT SIZE=3><I>56% </I>from radio and TV.5 In 1992, a Swiss journalist arranged a child sex-tour through a travel agent. He wrote such a devastating account of the agent 5 operation, that the subsequent public outcry forced the agent out of business.6 At the same time, media coverage of prosecutions under laws against sex tourism, now in operation in at least 12 countries, also helps to warn off men who might be tempted by the idea.</FONT>

<P>6
<P>
<P>There can be dangers in saturating the public with too much exposure of the issue, thereby creating acceptance and indifference. Many observers have warned of the public's &quot;famine fatiguet1 <FONT SIZE=3>when exposed to persistent, harrowing images in television coverage of recent disasters in Africa. The same problem may arise if coverage of children remains singular in its focus on the plight of the victim or the salacious nature of the offences involved.</FONT>
<P>
<P>Media researcher Nancy Signorielli sees two sides to sensationalism:
<P>
<P>Although child advocates may argue that sensational coverage distorts and exploits a serious problem - perhaps doing more harm than good -sensationalism solves several editorial problems; that is, it can be the response of reporters and editors trying to fulfil the responsibility to cover serious social issues, while continuing to turn a profit. Sensationalism permits an important but unpleasant topic to be covered in such a way that it still captures the readers' attention - and sells magazines. 7
<P>
<P>Eva Aurland would like to see the media place more emphasis on the role of the police, politicians, and other authorities in protecting the children, rather than the children themselves. Her colleague at the ICETU EIsa Ramos agrees, urging more analysis of the social causes: the pimps, the drug culture, the parents in poverly who are proud to have sold their daughters for a sum which will enable them to support the rest of the family. <FONT SIZE=3><I>&quot;Media should not be so shy about putting the blame on the individuals responsible for the exploitation, and the governments who condone it&quot;, </I>she says. For example, newspapers which uncovered the activities of a Bolivian lawyer who, they alleged, paid kidnappers US$40 for a boy whom he sold to a Belgian couple for US$10,000.</FONT>
<P>
<P>But media organisations must invest more time and effort into investigating such stories, if they want to avoid falling foul of defamation laws. It is easier to interview the children, who are hardly likely to sue. In a time of down-sizing and falling editorial expenditure on training and investigative journalism generally, the outlook for more in-depth media coverage is bleak.
<P>
<P>Nevertheless, media need to broaden the scope of reportage. The story of child sexual exploitation in general and its commercial aspects in particular is not being told in full. To examine how this can change requires a look at the professional freedoms which journalists require to work effectively, a sumniary of the principles or guidelines journalists and programme-makers should follow, and the pressures -- legal, financial, or cultural -- which are standing in the way.

<P>3.	SETTING STANDARDS FOR MEDIA
<P>
<P>The work of journalists, broadcasters, and media organisations is regulated at four different levels:
<P>
<P>1.	Codes of Conduct; <FONT SIZE=3>Most journalists usually have their own professional code of ethics, formulated by trade unions or professional associations. Usually a form of self-regulation;</FONT>
<P>
<P>2.	Guidelines: <FONT SIZE=3>Media organisations themselves, especially in the public service broadcasting sector, may draw up guidelines for professional conduct. Usually a form of self-regulation;</FONT>
<P>
<P>3.	Structures for Regulation: <FONT SIZE=3>certain regulatory bodies, such as press councils, rnay be established each with different powers and responsibilities and which may, or may not, have the force of law to support them;</FONT>
<P>
<P>4.	Legislation: the law may be used to underpin notions of professional journalism and the Systems set out above. The law may also support structures for licensing journalists and regulations providing penalties for breach of ethical conduct.
<P>
<P>Legillisation circumscribing the media and commercial sexual exploitation of children includes laws for the protection of children, such as the withholdin~ of information identifying children in court cases, in care, or as victims; laws to protect children from moral corruption; laws restricting pornography; and general laws on freedom of expression.
<P>
<P>The Canadian Criminal Code, for instance, makes it an oft'ence to publish anything that depicts a child perft)rming a sexual act or assuming a sexually suggestive ~()5C while in a state of undress. In Norwegian law, on the other hand, there is no general protection of public morals, except for a ban on pornographic material.8<FONT SIZE=3>'</FONT>
<P>
<P>With regard to codes of professional conduct, we have found no journalists' ()r~anisation which offers a specific code of good practice for covering the commercial sexual exploitation of children.
<P>
<P>It must be said that although journalists are conscious of a values-related system in which news and information is reported, many of them are ignorant of the form and exact content of the codes of conduct to which they work. There are no clearly established international standards, although the IFJ's International Code of Principles on ~he Conduc~ of Journalism, <FONT SIZE=3>agreed in 1954 and now under review</FONT>
<P>contains the key elements of a journalist's eihical responsibility. Any code will <FONT SIZE=3>reflect standards ofjournalism according to understood values within society. It will also deal with questions of enforcement and disclosure, often accepting that openness enhances accountabilitv, credibilitv and. ultimately, freedom.</FONT>
<P>
<P>

<P>8
<P>
<P>Inevitably, the role of codes of ethics in journalism, which begin with sweeping generalities, becomes important when resolving the ethical dilemmas which will arise in particular cases of reporting. In the area of reporting on children and commercial sexual exploitation, there are four closely-allied ethical dilemmas surrounding professional conduct and investigation of the subject:
<P>
<P>	Confidentiality of sources;
<P>
<P>	Undercover journalism and use of subterfuge to obtain information;
<P>
<P>	Co-operating with, and making information available to law enforcement  agencies;  and  intervening  in  events  under observation;
<P>
<P>	Identification of individuals.
<P>
<P>a)	Confidentiallty of Sources
<P>
<P>The right to safeguard the anonymity of sources of information is crucial to the journalist's ability to investigate. In Sweden and other Nordic countries, this n.~ht is enshrined in law. An Act passed in 1993 in France laid down that:
<P>
<P>Any journalist who appears as a witness concerning information gathered by him in the course of his journalistic activity is free not to disclose its source.
<P>
<P>The law also controls searches of media premises, which must not obstruct journalists in their work. However, in most countries journalists have to fight to defend this right, often risking fines or imprisonment in the process. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in its Journalistic Standards and Practices, for instance, upholds the principle of freedom of information and considers the protection of a journalist's sources to be an important element of this principle, but it reminds journalists that 'protection of sources is not a legal right'. CBC says it will not advise employees to defy a court order, but will provide legal counsel.
<P>
<P>Lars Bruun, in his review of ethical codes, found that 42 journalists' organisations around the world made mention of professional secrecy.9 <FONT SIZE=3>For instance the Nigerian Union of Journalists' Code of Conduct reads: <I>It is against the ethics of the profession to divulge information received in confidence, no matter what the consequences.</I></FONT>
<P>
<P>This principle was given backing in law in 1981, when the High Court of Lagos State ruled that the Senate of the National Assembly had exceeded its authority in summoning a journalist to disclose the confidential sources of an article. Often, the court's decision as to whether a journalist may legally withhold the identity of sources depends on the circumstances surrounding the case. In Japan, for instance, the Sapporo District Court interpreted the Code of Civil Procedure as allowing journalists to treat sources as 'an occupational secret', unless the information was required to ensure a fair trial:
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>9 <FONT SIZE=2>BRUUN, Lars, Contemporary Codes - A Review, <I>Professional Codes in Journallsm, </I>IOJ, 1979.</FONT>
<P>9
<P>A journalist alleged that parents were complaining about child abuse in a local nursery schooL The owner of the school sued the journalist for erroneous and defamatory reporting. Under questioning, the journalist re~sed to identif' his sources. The courts upheld his privilege on the ground that, when a fair trial is not at issue, compelling disclosure of confidential sources would improperly impair the reporter's pursuit of his profession.
<P>
<P>Journalists recognise that betraying sources not only inhibits their own ability to investigate; it also makes it more difficult for every journalist to work, and may <FONT SIZE=3>even put their lives at risk, as well as </FONT>the <FONT SIZE=3><I>safety of </I>the informants. The exploitation of children is such a sensitive issue that many abuses would never be revealed unless the people who provide the information: children, prostitutes, carers, and many others, could be confident that their anonymity would be preserved. Strengthening the journalist's rights in this area should be an element in any strategy aimed at creating the best professional conditions in which to examine the process of commercial sexual exploitation of children.</FONT>
<P>
<P>b)	Undercover Journalism
<P>
<P>Ethics codes are useful and they work most of the time. But sometimes genuine conflicts arise between values, and ethical decision-making is required. This difficult skill is like other skills of journalism: it takes training, time and effort to become good at them.
<P>
<P>The classic conflict of values comes when a journalist believes it is necessary to abandon the rule of tnith-telling, by telling lies or using subterfuge in order to obtain or confirm information, especially about illegal activities. In her review of 28 codes of ethics in 26 European Countries, Tuna Laitila found that 86% made reference to the use of fair means in information collection.11 <FONT SIZE=3>However, the definition of 'fair' is open to debate. Clause 5 of the Code of Conduct of the National Union of Journalists (UK and Ireland) states</FONT>
<P>
<P>A journalist shall obtain information, photographs and illustrations only by straight-forward means. The use of other means can be justified only by over-riding considerations of the public interest.
<P>
<P>Deciding when the public interest becomes 'over-riding', and what 'other means' are permissible, is left up to the conscience of the journalist, or often to the
<P>employer. This clause affirms that journalists are <FONT SIZE=3><I>entitled to exercise a personal conscientious objection to the use of such means.</I></FONT>
<P>
<P>But the conditions in which &quot;other means&quot; apply need to be carefully monitored. It must be borne in mind that the pressure of commercial competition, and the consequent imperative to be first with sensational news, often contributes to a climate in which subterfuge and 'cheque-book' journalism become standard practice,

<P>The challenge facing journalists and those who support high standards of journalism is to create the conditions for sound professional judgement. Sometimes decisions may coincide with commercial advantage, often they will not.
<P>
<P>Most ethical guides would acknowledge that it may be ethical to lie, but any journalist who faces such a dilemma must be convinced of the relevance and weight of the public interest, conscious of the harm it might do to credibility, and willing as soon as possible to face a &quot;publicity test&quot; -- public scrutiny of the circumstances. Journalists investigating the commercial sexual exploitation of children, should consider carefully whether it is justifiable to lie to, or deceive, either the exploiters, or the victims, in order to uncover the facts.
<P>
<P>In her analysis of honesty in Investigative journalism'2<FONT SIZE=3>, Jennifer Jackson calls for an 'emotional' <I>allegiance to truthfi'lness: </I>a hatred of lies.</FONT>
<P>
<P>Yet our allegiance to truthfitlness needs also to be in part rational; it needs to be reflective, judicious. ~ile it will not normally even occur to people of honest disposition that the end they seek might justif' ielhng a lie, such people can recognise that in quite exceptional circumstances, the end they have in view does justif' their lying They will, of course, reach such a decision reluctantly and with caution...
<P>
<P>Journalists can apply the 'publicity test' in advance of an investigation by assessing whether the public would regard the deception as justified. But they should also ask themselves whether there is no alternative route to the story, which does not involve lying.
<P>
<P>It is unlikely that the public would object to the subterfuge employed by Dutch programme-maker Aart Zeeman who used a hidden camera in order to track down the makers and vendors of child pornography in Amsterdam. Jackson herself concludes:
<P>
<P>it may be suggested that investigative journalists who are prepared to lie to get their stories (and the editors who print their stories) are hypocrites, lying in the name of trutit. Yet... lying in order to detect and expose lies is not necessarily hypocritical; sometimes it may be morally necessary or permissible for a journalist to lie, and then the journalist '5 lie will (when revealed) appear justified even to those who are really honest, who genuinely care about truthjulness.
<P>
<P>Nevertheless, an assumption that media are <FONT SIZE=3><I>always </I>licensed to deceive in order to get a story, undermines the moral authority of journalistic ethics. In the context of the commercial sexual exploitation of children there are important distinctions to be drawn, particularly because it is not just the pimps and pornographers who are involved, but the children themselves.</FONT>

<P>A researcher who interviewed children working the streets in British cities, for <B><I>a </B></I><FONT SIZE=3>Channel 4 documentary </FONT><B><I>The Care Connection, </B></I>remembers: <FONT SIZE=3><I>&quot;For the first 10 or 20</I></FONT>
<P>seconds they were very suspicious. But as soon as they realised we were not the police they immediately relaxed. They just opened up completely. They saw that we were not going to take anything from them - or give anything to them. And once they started talking they wouldn ~ stop. They came to trust us.
<P>
<P>But there <FONT SIZE=3><I>are </I>times when the media do take something from the children. Their exploitation by media professionals in pursuit of a 'good story' or an award-winning documentary can damage, even unintentionally, the dignity and self-esteem of children.</FONT>
<P>
<P>There is an ethical line to be drawn between subterfuge required to uncover the largely illegal activities of exploiters, and investigation of the children themselves. This may not be easy, given that working 'undercover' generally means total secrecy. But the fact that so many of the children are eager to find someone they can trust and who will listen to them, underlines their vulnerability. Experience of deception will further damage their self-esteem, and their relationship with others.
<P>
<P>Journalists and media organisations need to apply the highest possible standards of honesty and openness when dealing with exploited children.
<P>
<P>In practical terms, this means a greater emphasis on ethical questions in journalists' training, to encourage a more finely tuned moral sense'  <FONT SIZE=1>13 </FONT><FONT SIZE=3>This should focus on concrete examples of specific dilemmas, including the coverage of children's exploitation. It also requires a constructive and supportive debate within newsrooms about these issues, as well as a greater awareness and sensitivity within the media about public attitudes on child pornography and exploitation.</FONT>
<P>
<P>c)	Co-operation With The Authorities
<P>
<P>Just as journalists are committed to &quot;truth-telling&quot; they are, as citizens, called upon to respect notions of community. Should journalists work hand-in-hand with the authorities and law enforcement officers in reporting on child exploitation? It is a complicated question, on which little guidance is given by formal ethical codes.
<P>
<P>Aart Zeeman's team followed the Amsterdam police for a year while making their documentary. However, this can also be a dangerous strategy. In Taiwan, one of the major television stations recently broadcast film of reporters accompanying police on raids of bars and brothels. It included scenes of young men and women being questioned, apparently without any special regard for minors, and with only token efforts to avoid filming their faces. (It is important to recall that there is a newspaper tradition behind most ethics codes and sometimes this does not address the problems of broadcasters. Occasionally journalists involved in &quot;live&quot; coverage may.. unthinkingly transmit material which causes harm. In such cases, the technology may rob a television producer of the time for reflection which is vital to sound ethical decision-making.)

<P>12
<P>
<P>II is vital that journalists do not become identified in the public mind with <FONT SIZE=3>security forces, for exactly the same reasons which apply to the protection of sources. But does this mean that journalists who discover evidence of illegal trafficking or exploitation of children, for example, should not pass it on to the authorities?</FONT>
<P>
<P>Again, this is not an unusual dilemma, but it is one of the most difficult to resolve. Convincing arguments can usually be marshalled for and against almost every case. It is a dilemma which depends upon the circumstances, and the conscience of the individual journalist. Aart Zeeman believes the media should not behave as 'the third or fourth arm of the police', and would not want to pass on data outside that broadcast in the programme. His view is that anything which serves to link the media more closely with law enforcers, in the minds of those supplying information will make them more reluctant to talk to journalists in general.
<P>
<P>However, other professionals we spoke to did not find the issue so clear cut. The BBC's Chief Advisor on Editorial Policy James Boyle said the Corporation would allow supplementary material to be taken away only if it were clearly in the public interest, and that no danger to any member of staff would result. Brazilian journalist Roberto Mader judged that he would pass on information only to help the girl prostitutes he interviewed in Latin America. In general, media professionals agree that criminal investigation itself is the job of the police and should be clearly separated from the exercise of journalism.
<P>
<P>But in countries suffering first-hand from the effects of sex tourism and growing exploitation, it is perhaps natural that journalists' associations and media themselves shouJd fee] justified in taking a more proactive ro]e. The Vietnamese Journalists' Association, for instance, states that the media do cooperate with authorities such as police, drug agencies, and families, to prevent the commercial sexual exploitation of children; and that some offenders have been brought to trial as a result.
<P>
<P>In Taiwan, in 1990, a child prostitute in the Huahsi Street red light area left a note for passers-by appealing: 'please save me'. The <B><I>China 'limes Weekly </B></I><FONT SIZE=3>took up her case, and pressured the Wanhua District police into searching for 'Little Chen', as she signed herself. At that time, says Cheryl Lai of the Association of Taiwan Journalists, the authorities paid little attention to child prostitution. But because of the media publicity, the police finally tracked down 14-year-old 'Little Chen', and she was returned to school. This is one case where the police were forced to act by media intervention.</FONT>
<P>
<P>This example raises the question of the role of media in taking up child exploitation cases. Journalists see tbemselves as neutral observers, but there may be times when the offences they see being committed are so appalling that they must intervene. Again this is a question for individual conscience, bearing in mind all the factors referred to above, but it may be a legitimate role for media to play in certain circumstances. For instance, many journalists reporting the war in Bosnia have witnessed atrocities, but only two of them have agreed to take part as witnesses in the war crimes trials in the Hague: British journalists Martin Bell, and Ed Vulliamy. Bell recognises that he would be a Serbian target if he returned to Bosnia as a reporter.
<P>13
<P>
<P>Both journalists accept that &quot;Many colleagues think that to have given evidence is bad <FONT SIZE=3>professional ethics.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<P>However, Vulliamy draws a distinction between 'objectivity' -- a journalist's duty to report the facts -- and 'neutrality <FONT SIZE=1><B>:14</B></FONT>
<P>
<P>At a certain point, the perpetration of atrocity crosses a line, and breaches not only international law but the bases of civi lisa tion.
<P>
<P>Beyond this point, he argues, 'neutrality' becomes complicity. The same criteria can very well be applied to child exploitation. The International Federation of Journalists -
<P>
<P>- although respecting the rights of conscience of individuals -- notes that by taking sides, journalists not only endanger their own safety, they can put their co]]eagues al risk.
<P>
<P>d) Identifying The Victims
<P>
<P>If. journalists have a duty to the truth in their reporting and to independence in their work they also have a responsibility to minimise harm from their actions, particularly to people who are themselves the victims of injustice and abuse.
<P>
<P>The <B><I>Guardian, </B></I><FONT SIZE=3>which generally adheres to a high standard in its news coverage, ]s not alone by any means in publishing photographs of child prostitutes even under arrest. This is particularly true of western media images of children in developing countries, although the technique of obscuring part of the face is now sometimes used. However, more often it is the adult -- the suspected abuser -- whose identity is hidden. In Taiwan, however, there is now a law whereby the names and photographs of convicted pimps and c]ients of underage prostitutes, and the hotel where the violation occurred &quot;should be published&quot; after conviction.</FONT>
<P>
<P>Interpol confirms that many countries have legislation protecting the identity of children involved in court proceedings, children in care, or children who are subject to abuse, but laws vary according to who they protect, and under what circumstances. They generally apply to young people under the national age of majority. There is also some controversy about how energetically they are enforced. The Council of Europe's Committee of Experts emphasises this aspect:
<P>
<P>The disclosure, during administrative and judicial proceedings, of information which may serve to identijy the victim, is a particularly important aspect of secondary victim isa ti on. The psychological consequences ofsuch disclosure may be particularly serious for the children and young adults concerned and are liable to deter the parents or those responsible for the young person from lodging a complaint.
<P>
<P>... The dissemination of such information by prosecuting authorities, courts or administrative authorities may cause harm to the young victims of sexual exploitation. The Committee strongly emphasises that cases must be handled with due respect to the victim 'S privacy.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>14 <FONT SIZE=2>VULLIAMY, Ed; Testimony for the Terrorised; <I>The Guardian, </I>15.6.96.</FONT>
<P>14
<P>
<P>Despite widespread international understanding of this question, in South East Asia, a newspaper printed the names of two children who had given evidence in the prosecution of a foreign paedophile. Child protection agencies believe legislation should allow offenders to be prosecuted without children being required to testify against them, to avoid any risk of identification or publicity. In Norway, a similar law means women do not have to give evidence in cases of domestic violence. Otherwise, there is a danger of what the BBC calls 'Jigsaw identification':
<P>
<P>This happens when different news organisations give different facts associated with the victim which can be pieced together.
<P>
<P>It advises staff:
<P>
<P>Take care not to give an address, any link with another person in the story, or any link between the victim and the scene of the assault... One way or another, we must not complete the      jigsaw.15
<P>
<P>Victims in general cannot be sure that their identity will not be made public. For instance, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation guidelines recognise that:
<P>
<P>Broadcasting the identity of a crime victim most often only adds to the person '5 grief anguish and trauma.
<P>
<P>The CBC tells staff not to broadcast the names of victims, especially of crimes against the person, such as sexual assault. Yet alleged victims of assaults that have not been proved in court are not offered the 'privilege of anonymity'.
<P>
<P>Child prostitutes are often afforded even less protection than other young abuse victims, creating an understandable reluctance to report their exploitation. This perception that once children are working on the streets, in bars, taking drugs, or otherwise participating in the world of adult vice, they forfeit the rights of 'innocent' children, is shared in some quarters of the media as well as the law enforcemeni agencies.
<P>
<P>In a survey of five Taiwanese daily newspapers,16 <FONT SIZE=3>Chi Hui-jung discovered a general hostility to young prostitutes. Out of 133 news items about arrests for offences involving underage prostitutes, 34. % used unsympathetic headlines, and 35% were unsympathetic in content, using language such as <I>childish; selling herself deflowered; doesn 't study but sells her body; </I>and <I>slut. </I>She concluded that crime reporters do not see the juveniles involved as minors, but use adult standards to judge and blame child prostitutes, and rarely see them as victims. On the other hand, the same reporters are very tolerant towards the clients. Only 4% of the headlines were negative about them, and 91% did not mention them at all, in common with 71% of the reports.</FONT>
<P>
<P>Rachel O'Brien believes such figures reflect a lack of recognition around the world that a crime is being perpetrated by an adult. It should never be the children who are cautioned or condemned.

<P>is
<P>One interesting conclusion to emerge from the Taiwan study, highlighted by Cheryl Lai, is that ethical standards vary widely between reporters covering different beats;
<P>
<P>Most media reports on this issue originate in arrests and thus from the police, and are filed by reporters on crime beats, who are generally less likely to consider the interests of the children involved, or make serious efforts to protect their identities. Journalists covering disadvantaged groups in society who are generally sympathetic to the movement to abolish child prostitu tion, take greater care in their reporting not to add to the harm already suffered by the children.
<P>
<P>Where children are not specifically protected by law, it is the journalist or editor who must take the decision on whether to identify them. There are some who are even prepared to flout the law for the sake of a 'sexy' or sensation~ story. This is particularly damaging in countries with strict contempt of court rules, where the media revelation of unauthorised details in advance of a court hearing can lead to the case collapsing. Even when children themselves are not named, details may be given which endanger them. One newspaper, for instance, which interviewed an 11-year-old boy, boxed out his face in the photograph, but went on to name his 'sugar-daddy' and the streets he worked. He remained at the mercy of a dangerous, violent street culture which has, in the end, as much to do with power and money as sex.
<P>
<P>The issue of identity is at the heart of journalistic endeavour. JI is in the nature of journalism, from the first lesson in journalism school onwards, to provide facts, including personal details about whoever is involved in a story. The decision to suppress information has to be carefully considered, but the nature of commercial sexual exploitation of children should always encourage a journalist to respect, above all, the rights of the victim. Sometimes, this may not be easy. June Kane, UMCEF's Media Coordinator for the World Congress17 <FONT SIZE=3>calls on documentary makers to think twice before using footage of bar girls in Asia, for example, but will a producer working on a programme about bar girls, be able to alert viewers to the real tragedy of sex tourism, without picturing the girls at work, or telling individual children's stories?</FONT>

<P>In the material provided for the World Congress there is a call to the media to avoid exploiting and victimising the children in their coverage, and to depict them in a way which maintains their dignity. It is a brave, but challenging call. To achieve this. media professionals need to re-examine their old habits.
<P>
<P>Peter Almond18 <FONT SIZE=3>points out that a collection of myths 'contaminate  the public's. and the media's, perception of children.</FONT>

<P>
<P>The media cling to these myths; they are familiar, convenient, easily adapted 10 conventional formats of news and entertainment. In short, myth is easier to report than the more subtle and complicated reality.
<P>
<P>Such myths can lead journalists to mould exploited children into typecast roles as sinners or victims. Families in developing countries, people living in poverty, or victims of war and disaster lose their individuality and their humanity. Victims are portrayed as helpless sufferers, unable to act, think, or speak for themselves. Whole countries and communities become categorised under generalised headlines.
<P>
<P>In Thailand, the portrayal of girls from the north of the country drifling into prostitution has become so pervasive that a special project has been launched to protect some of those at risk. Quoted in <FONT SIZE=3><I>The Nation,19 </I>one 13-year-old protests: <I>&quot;I get angr~' every time I hear people say that man)' northern girls are engaged in prostitution I have not the slightest intention to become a prostitute&quot;.</I></FONT>
<P>
<P>In <FONT SIZE=3><I>1995, </I>Dr Magda Michielsens of the University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands analysed the portrayal of victims, in the news output of seven TV channels across Europe2~~. She concluded that victims generally are given low status. Victims of violence, disaster, and human rights abuses in developing countries, (she collected examples from Africa), are much less likely to be identified as individuals and offered the chance to speak, than those from Europe. This form of racism reinforces the sense of distance, of 'otherness , experienced by the European or northern viewer.</FONT>
<P>
<P>In a survey of magazine coverage of child abuse in the United States, Nancy Signorielli21 <FONT SIZE=3>found that victims were rarely reported to react to their abuse. Women's magazines covered the issue more frequently than news and business magazines, but in a more sensational way. As a result, men were less exposed to the problem. Gerbner also discovered Ibat a high proportion of children on TV appeared as victims.</FONT>
<P>
<P>
<P>Disproportionate preoccupation with even sympathetically presented or &quot;accidental&quot; victims in an underrepresented population, relative to exhibiting their own share of numbers and exercise of power, diminishes and degrades that group. 22
<P>
<P>Fierce commercial competition is one factor leading the media to exploit victims, suggests Dr Michielsens. The exposure of emotions and sensationalisation of events attract audiences and sell news. Cash-conscious media organisations apply

<P>
<P>greater pressure on news teams for productivity. Journalists, therefore, sometimes take the ill-considered, easy route to news-gathering, perpetuating -- whether consciously or unconsciously -- the sorts of myth and stereotype identified by Peter Almond. In this process individuals and groups are not treated with respect and their needs and views are not properly appreciated.    Some media organisations are becoming aware of the danger of dehumanising victims in far-away places. James Boyle says the BBC now has clear rules, which apply even to dead bodies. <FONT SIZE=3><I>&quot;Human beings have the same dignity all over the world&quot;. </I>There are a range of approaches being developed, to avoid stereotyping and victimising exploited children, while at the same time telling their story accurately and vividly.</FONT>
<P>
<P>Roberto Mader felt that all the programmes he saw about cbildren's exploitation in Latin America and other southern countries, while strongly denouncing important human rights abuses, left the impression that nothing could be done. <FONT SIZE=3><I>'All you feel at the end of the programme is depressed. Now all my work is about trying to show, not that hje in Brazil is wonderfrl -- we have our problems -- but I work in areas where I know there are people doing very positive things to change the reality in which they live That is the most important thing: to show how people are getting empowered.&quot;</I></FONT>
<P>
<P>In search of a 'strong movement' in the Brazilian cities. Mader settled on the <FONT SIZE=3><I>Casa de Passegem, </I>a half~wav house for girls escaping prostitution. <I>&quot;It was the only' project Ifr)und where the girls were having a say about the running of the programme. That was very important. There '5 one inten'iew where one of the girls says: 'These people used to make me feel so ugly, H~t now nobody' needs to say I am beautifi~A because I know I am'. The girls were shown in a very positive light. Everybody is tired of seeing the negative side&quot;.</I></FONT>
<P>
<P>Tony Dowmunt, the producer of <FONT SIZE=3><I>Casa de Passegem, </I>says all the girls interviewed were over the a(,,e of consent, and spoke about their past lives. <I>&quot;We wanted to show that it was possible to get off the streets&quot;. </I>He believes the media Should investigate more of the racist and imperialist dynamics behind sex tourism which is <I>'not just a few dirty' old men going abroad'.</I></FONT>
<P>
<P>&quot;In the 198()s, these issues were just starting to be aired. We are still in a backlash, where some of them are considered too dtfficult to deal with. It is very difficult to find thou ghtjul discussion about them.
<P>
<P>Roberto Mader believes language is another obstacle to the doc'umentary format. Subtitles are expensive, and often unpopular with audiences. Broadcasting organisations tend to avoid them. <FONT SIZE=3><I>&quot;It's an excuse not to listen to people at all - you just have a voice-over soundbite. Yet people are amazed when they' see ordinary people speaking&quot;.</I></FONT>
<P>
<P>Aart Zeeman traced children back to Hungary, the Czech Republic and the Philippines, but avoided identifying the former victims he interviewed. <FONT SIZE=3><I>&quot;I don 't think it adds anything to show their faces, unless they are grown up now and choose to tell their story. Children don 't understand the impact being on TV can have. I think you have to be very' careful to protect the children -- the film might be shown in the countries where they are living and could easily get them into trouble&quot;.</I></FONT>
<P>18
<P>
<P>Altering the names of people and places is one obvious answer for newspaper journalists. But for the documentary maker, the dilemma between using images which will keep the audience's attention, and not endangering or victimising the children, cannot be easily resolved. For <B><I>The Care Connection, </B></I><FONT SIZE=3>programme makers 'invented' different ways of getting round the problem. Cameras were positioned at unusual angles -- above interviewees' heads or by their ears -- or shots were cut away to focus on the movements of their hands, which also registered the emotional impact of their words. The technique of &quot;pixilating&quot; -- blurring a small portion of the screen -- was rejected.</FONT>
<P>
<P>&quot;It '5 always associated with criminals, or somebody who deserves what they get&quot;, <FONT SIZE=3>explained researcher Simon Cooper.</FONT>
<P>
<P>Other broadcasters have sought different, less controversial approaches to the topic, such as a dramatisation, followed by a studio debate. Belgian director Gil Verhaert proposed the fictional formula for a six-part series <B><I>on </B></I><FONT SIZE=3>La </FONT><B><I>femme, 1'enfant, </B><FONT SIZE=3>et </I>La </FONT><B><I>prostitution, </B></I><FONT SIZE=3>in Africa, Asia and Europe. <I>We have a lot of information, but we cannot feature the real people because they are all either afraid of the Mafia, or are invoh'ed in court cases&quot;, </I>he explained. <I>&quot;Audiences are interested in dramatic events. But it does not have to be sensational. If you keep to the truth, it '5 more than dramatic enough.&quot;</I></FONT>
<P>
<P>Many of the journalists reporting on commercial sexual exploitation of children are committed to uncovering what they regard as a profound social evil: <FONT SIZE=3><I>&quot;We have a ~~ole to play in increasing awareness&quot;, </I>says Aart Zeeman. <I>'It '5 such a disgusting ihing&quot;.</I></FONT>
<P>
<P>The work of such media professionals not only acts as a counter-weight to media indifference and lack of awareness, it adds to the resources available to campaigners. The material produced may be linked in with campaigns on the issue by local NGOs, or destined for educational use-- as in the case of Gil Verhaert's project. He hoped his work might be used in the Philippines among families who sell their own children into prostitution. In Bangkok, a campaign has been launched to show parents the horrors their daughters would face in the sex trade.~

<P>
<P>5.	FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND IIIE CHALLENGE OF SELF-REGULATION
<P>
<P>Journalists tend to be wary of regulators. They have much evidence to support the view that intervention in the affairs of journalism inevitably leads to forms of censorship. However, it is a legitimate question whether media self-regulation is a sufficient answer to public concern over standards of journalism in an age when the changing media landscape, and particularly the growth of global media enterprises appears, in theory at least, to put media beyond the range of national public accountability.
<P>
<P>Effective self-regulation, by which the errors of media professionals are dealt with by their peers, may not be so convincing when media organisations appear to use
<P>
<P>
<P>23 <FONT SIZE=2>Patpong's child prostitution is parents' shock treatment; <I>The Nation; </I>6.4.95.</FONT>
<P>19
<P>
<P>professional codes to support their particular interests, which in a commercial system of mass communication by no means necessarily coincide with those of journalism or the public interest. There has been in the past criticism that self-regulation has been used to provide what might be called a &quot;social alibi&quot; for the mass media industry, that is to prevent society from taking more definite (legal) measures. 24
<P>
<P>This argument goes to the heart of the uncomfortable balance of interests which prevails in today's media -- that ethical standards are being sacrificed in defence of commercial interests. One of the principle problems lies in the implementation and enforcement of rules. Very ofien even regulatory bodies lack the power to enforce sanctions which bite. In Canada in 1990, the CBC's Equity Task Force found that, with regard to equitable employment and portrayal, <FONT SIZE=3><I>self-regulation and incentive measures have failed to accomplish desired and anticipated results.</I></FONT>
<P>
<P>Some professional codes aspire to the very highest moral standards, as in Chile,
<P>
<P>
<P>Journalism and journa lists must be in the service of truth, social justice, human rights and the idea/s of the improvement of society and ofpeace among peoples.
<P>
<P>And there is no doubt that many individuals, like those quoted above, are committed to exposing and condemning sexual exploitation. Sadly, many more choose to reflect the commercial or political interests of advertisers, proprietors, or political parties.
<P>
<P>This control seldom takes tl~e form of direct intervention or censorship, but far more often of self-censorship by the media professionals themselves - who may not even be aware that they are exercising it. <FONT SIZE=1>2.i</FONT>
<P>
<P>In an Indiana University School of Journalism study in the 1980s, 88% of the journalists questioned said they acquired their ethical values from the newsroom itself. Aidan White identifies several extra factors which encourage &quot;the tendency towards self-censorship and self-denial of social responsibility&quot; among media professionals, including:
<P>
<P>the growth of new technologies, which threaten to overwhelm existing regulatory structures, or the unaccountable nature of transnational media corporations which evade terrestrial control of media standards, or the increasingly insecure working environment in which journalists work.26
<P>
<P>Journalists' unions who have tried to enforce their own ethical standards through disciplinary proceedings, have found themselves in the tricky if not impossible position of attacking individual workers they exist to support.

<P>Education Ministries in agreeing <B><I>Self-regulation Principles for Television Channels concerning the specific content of their programmes with regard to protecting children and young people. </B></I><FONT SIZE=3>The document recognises <I>'the significant role which television plays in Spanish society and its influence on society, particularly children and young people'. </I>Specific guidelines on reporting child abuse could be drawn up by professional associations to accompany their general ethical codes, along the lines of guidelines for reporting MDS published by the NUJ (UK and Ireland).</FONT>
<P>
<P>In the final analysis, the support of media employers and regulators is crucial to improving newsroom values as highlighted by Cheryl Lai: <FONT SIZE=3><I>Much of the biased or sensationalist coverage, especially headlines, is created by editors, and it will be difficult to gain improvements given Taiwan '5 patriarchal society unless high-level media editors and managers implement such a policy from the top down.</I></FONT>
<P>
<P>Attitudes to censorship and freedom of expression vary widely from country to country and culture to culture. In all countries, broadcasting tends to be more highly regulated than newspapers and magazines. The importance of the right to freedom of expression cannot be under-estimated, yet it is not without boundaries. Both the <FONT SIZE=3>UN </FONT>Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms draw attention to the
<P>responsibilities accompanying this right, including 'respect for the rights or reputations of others'.
<P>
<P>The question of freedom of expression is relevant in particular to child pornography. Can there be a distinction between pornography, and the justifiable portrayal of 'childhood sexuality' in works of art? Amy Adler27 <FONT SIZE=3>argues that the US Supreme Court, in its anxiety to protect children, has thrown out <I>'important speech-protective features of the law', including 'the traditional protection afforded to artistic expression'.</I></FONT>
<P>
<P>But American lawyer Andrew Vachss, a specialist in child abuse cases, believes that the controversy over art is a red herring thrown up by the paedophile community.
<P>
<P>The issue is not &quot;what is art?&quot; but &quot;what is victim isation?&quot; I can no more accept a child pornographer saying he is a victim of censorship than I could a mugger claiming his field of activity was performance art.28<I></I>
<P>
<P>The issue of rights to freedom of expression cannot be ignored, but should be turned around to focus first on the rights of the child to freedom from fear and exploitation. As June Kane points out, <FONT SIZE=3><I>'Journalists should, as always, look at the facts, and have at their fingertips the medical and other evidence to prove that the commercial sexual exploitation of children cannot be justified.</I></FONT>

<P>6.	BUILDING IMAGES OF CHILDREN, SEX AND VIOLENCE IN THE MEDIA
<P>
<P>There is increasing alarm in a number of countries that the way children are <FONT SIZE=3><I>portrayed </I></FONT>by the media today may increase the risks they face. Controversy continues internationally about how far children's behaviour is influenced by what they see on <FONT SIZE=3>television - particularly with regard to violence.</FONT>
<P>
<P>The loudest recent public controversy about the portrayal of children has focused recently on the American film <B><I>Kids, </B></I><FONT SIZE=3>directed by Larry Clark. Some critics condemned the film as voyeuristic, and expressed disbelief that the young actors, mostly amateur, who enacted the film's brutal sexual encounters, were themselves above tbe age of consent. The film raised worrying questions both about the exploitation of increasingly youthful actors, and about the impact on young audiences who might regard the characters as role-models. In some countries, the film was barred to under-1~s. The crucial question is whether adults themselves are encouraging children to become prematurely sexua]ly active, or to seem to be so.</FONT>
<P>
<P>This question is particularly relevant to pop music and modelling which are two of the most influential industries among young people today. In fashion, it is the woman-child&quot; who now rules the catwalk.
<P>
<P>Gianne Alberioni Vicente is 5ft JOin, with long blond hair, wide-apart eyes and
<P>wonderful bones. Oh, and she's only J3~29
<P>
<P>The recent revelation that a 12-year-old schoolgirl had been signed up by an adult modelling agency in the UK, with the approval of her parents, caused widespread soul-searching in the media. Was it a harmless bit of fun, or the symptom of a dangerous trend? The commentators disagreed, but most expressed alarm. Even the girl's mother admitted that there was a 'sexual angle'; expanded upon by p.~ychologist Dorothy Rowe:
<P>
<P>There is something intriguing about the young girl who is just discovering ILfe and is beginning to wonder what it '5 all about. It is the kind of titillation in which a virginal girl intrigues a man. In areas of sexuality intended to intrigue, it is especially dangerous because the child is being presented with issues that they are not really ready to deal with, no matter how precocious they look. 30
<P>
<P>British Member of Parliament Ann Winterton judged it to be a <FONT SIZE=3><I>&quot;trend almost verging on the paedophilic&quot;. </I>The fear must be that, the more grown-up women are persuaded to aspire to having a childlike body, the more the distinction between adults and children, also with respect to sexuality, will become blurred.</FONT>
<P>
<P>Then, in May, the watch-manufacturer Omega announced that it planned to withdraw advertising from a major fashion magazine, <FONT SIZE=3><I>Vogue, </I>in protest at the use of waif-like mod~s. Within a couple of weeks, Omega had obtained more publicitv - all of it free and much of it highly complimentary - than a year's worth of advertising in magazines. Ironically, the threat was withdrawn on the instructions of the chairman</FONT>

<P>
<P>Nicolas Hayek, ostensibly in the interest of press freedom. Omega's brand director Giles Rees wrote to <FONT SIZE=3><I>Vogue:</I></FONT>
<P>
<P>I would hope that the tremendous support and encouragement that we have received from the media and particularly from the public would urge you to consider addressing these issues with your editorial staff
<P>
<P>If it can be demonstrated to companies that they have something to gain in <FONT SIZE=3>terms of public approval and financial return from rejecting sexually exploitative images, this might have a major impact.</FONT>
<P>
<P>The impact of public pressure on the media, on this issue as any other, should not be underestimated. Parents and educators in France, for instance, have been urged to react when TV stations show material lacking in respect for children, whether or not it is intended for young viewers. In Australia, a national campaign to improve the portrayal of women in the media included the distribution of information packs telling audiences how to complain about what they heard or saw.31
<P>
<P>Jennifer Rowe, former editor of the Australian Women's Weekly, commented:
<P>
<P>In the end, all media are driven by their ratings or their readership, and if they can see that they are losing that, by persisting in an attitude that is outmoded, they will change.
<P>
<P>The most fascinating aspect of the model controversy is how it was handled by the newspapers themselves. The girl's first appearance, according to Alexander Chancellor, was on the front page of the <FONT SIZE=3><I>Daily Telegraph.</I></FONT>
<P>
<P>The next day she was taken up by the tabloids <FONT SIZE=1>32 </FONT><FONT SIZE=3>She was pouting and smouldering in the photographs in an alarmingly grown-up way. The tabloids were thrilled of course, but also censorious.</FONT>
<P>
<P>Indeed, its professed outrage did not stop the <FONT SIZE=3><I>Daily Mail </I></FONT>from reprinting a full-<FONT SIZE=3>length picture of the girl in her 'smouldering' modelling pose, under the heading &quot;Who on earth would allow a child of 12 to pose like this?&quot; It might have queried, more relevantly, who on earth would publish a picture of her doing it. And as if to reinforce the sexual message, the feature was placed next to a small beauty item giving advice on how to achieve 'a perfect pout'. The morally self-righteous stance adopted by some sections of the media is directly contradicted when it come to stories and images that make money.</FONT>
<P>
<P>For the popular music industry, international TV channels like MTV, where pop videos make up a large proportion of output, are a very significant means of reaching young people and children - even those too young to attend concerts or buy CDs. Professor Monique Remy analysed the images of young people in these videos. She found:
<P>
<P>
<P>31 <FONT SIZE=2><I>Women and Media; </I>National Working Party on the Portrayal of Women in the Media,</FONT>
<P>1993.
<P>
<P>32 <FONT SIZE=2>The name given to the more down-market, sensational end of the British press, so-called because of their small page format. The quality newspapers have larger, broadsheet pages.</FONT>
<P>23
<P>
<P>... stereotyped masculine and feminine images, sado-masochistic scenes, Asian exoticism, fetishist female garments, women as bloodsuckers and troublemakers, both men and women grotesquely made-up, with an element of androgeny. ~
<P>
<P>Women appeared as child-like, asexual yet provocative, dangerous, yet also <FONT SIZE=3>victimised. In their analysis of 166 videos broadcast by MTV, WTBS and NBC in 1984, Barry Sherman and Joseph Dominick drew attention to the provocative style of dress, and the portrayal of young women as either aggressors or victims-~.</FONT>
<P>
<P>The Council of Europe's experts also warned of the 'insidious' exploitation of children's and young people's bodies in show business and the media, and the use of children's pictures or voices to create an erotic atmosphere.
<P>
<P>'Lolitas' ~oth male and female) seem to have come back into fashion in the
<P>cinema and show business, appealing to the unwholesome taste of a certain
<P>section of the public.
<P>
<P>Certainly some media commentators have perceived this as evidence of a 'widespread phenomenon.. . of confusion over the boundary between adults and children&quot; in which parents have colluded in the sexual exploitation of their cbildren.
<P>
<P>We inhabit a culture which makes a great deal of money out of the mass premature sexualisation of children. Their music, their clothes, the JVand films they watch and the teen magazines they read envelop them in a miasma of sexuality' .... Children who are glued to the set have been turned into voycurs at the peepshow of adult behaviour.... Popular culture presents to them as normal a brutally crude, mechanistic world in which sexual gratification is another commodity, available not just to adults but to them, along with the clothes, ODs and cosmetics.
<P>
<P>Little wonder then, the argument goes, that if the media consistently present young and old audiences alike with images of children in a sexual context, some adults will believe that children are ready and able to participate in sexual activity.
<P>
<P>Our society panics about an apparent epidemic of child sexual abuse. Doesn 't it ever occur to anyone that maybe there is some connection with the multinational business of precocious child sexuality?
<P>
<P>Rachel O'Brien believes it is dangerous to view these developments as 'armageddon' - a catastrophic loss of innocence about which nothing can be done. But she does perceive a widespread confusion about what childhood means, and points out that the definition of childhood itself differs from community to community, and age to age. Children <FONT SIZE=3><I>are </I>aware of their bodies, and <I>do </I>need to explore and learn about</FONT>

<P>sex. But this should be done gradually, in a tolerant, safe environment; through natural contact with other children, and with the support of parents.
<P>
<P>The problems, she says, arise from adults looking at young people in a certain way: appropriating them for their own use. They create exploitative and, in extreme cases, paedophile images. The image of pre-pubescent children offering themselves for sex allows adults to claim that they are responsible for the provocation. <FONT SIZE=3><I>&quot;How do young people themselves consume these images? On the one hand, many children are denied sex education, while on the other there is a glorification of children in provocative poses. ft seems that either we want our children to be totally innocent, or to be prostitutes. And the whole question of their rights as individuals gets lefi out.&quot;</I></FONT>
<P>
<P>All this makes the notion of a 'youth oriented society' into a slogan of little substance, concludes George Gerbner. The media are oriented towards 'markets and power' rather than youth. Advertisers focus on consumers and potential consumers -and we will look at advertising specifically later in this paper. But in television output children have no power. They <FONT SIZE=3><I>&quot;take on the characteristics of a social minority with less than their share of attention, values, and resources, and consequently diminished itfe chances. ~</I></FONT>
<P>
<P>The solution may be simple to see, but not so easy to achieve. That is. to give a voice in the media to children themselves, to <FONT SIZE=3><I>listen </I>to their views and aspirations. And to educate them to be knowledgeable and critical about how the media work. International conventions and recommendations already emphasise the right of children to have a say in decisions affecting them, and call for a change in the way children are regarded ~ The Drafi Declaration from this Congress also emphasises that children have a right to express their views on matters affecting their lives, and calls for children's participation in action (Article 6). Why should children not also have more say in the media? Dr Ulla Bjo~rnberg proposes documentary programmes on young people's lives in different countries, with the aim of giving children aged from 7 to 18 - including poor and migrant children - an opportunity to air their opinions.~~</FONT>
<P>
<P>Washington Post journalist Tom Wilkinson points out39 the importance to all <FONT SIZE=3>newspapers of 'sources'. Children are not regarded as sources because they are not trusted to distinguish accurately between fact and fiction -- a belief that also applied to children giving evidence in court until recently. New means of giving children access to the media as sources should be investigated, perhaps through the mediation of child heiplines, with reassurance that information offered would be strictly confidential. Wilkinson also makes the crucial point that:</FONT>

<P>
<P>25
<P>
<P>child abuse does not fall squarely into a specific area of reporting. Is it part of the police beat, medicine, sociology, or government? The Post doesn 't have a child abuse reporter per Se, and I doubt that any major newspaper does.
<P>
<P>We have already seen, in Taiwan, the difference in approach when the topic is reported by journalists with a broader awareness of social issues. Maybe Wilkinson has hit on tbe answer. Given the size of the constituency and its importance for the future, should not news media have specialist 'children's correspondents', with a brief covering all aspects of children's lives, and specific training to enable journalists to express the child's point of view? Maybe this would do most to 'promote change in the traditional view of the child'4~~<FONT SIZE=3>. In its report on implementation of the Council of Europe Recommendation No.R (91)11, the British government suggests the sort of training that would be appropriate for 'all professionals who come into contact with children', including:</FONT>
<P>
<P>self-awareness, children 'S sexual terminology, child growth and development, child abuse, risk factors, the law, inten'iewing techniques, communication with children, and video recording.
<P>
<P>The British Home Office also decided to produce a 'good practice' video for judges and ]awvers. Governments or NGOs might consider making good practice videos for editors and journalists. Another measure to assist journalists in covering children 5 issues seriously and accurately would be for NGOs in each country to compile a directory of reliable experts on different topics, which could be available on every news desk.
<P>
<P>International bodies41 <FONT SIZE=3>have called for more information to be given to children</FONT>
<P>-	both through the media and at school - about the dan~ers and risks of sexual exploitation, and how to defend themselves. But children, from primary school upwards, also need media literacy training, to help them understand and decode the messages they receive from both programmes and advertising, so as to become critical and well-informed media consumers. In Canada, for instance, the organisation Mediawatch and the Federation of Women's Teachers' Associations have developed a curriculum for schools on stereotypes and gender issues.
<P>
<P>Media education can play a cfl4cial role in counteracting the impact of these messages. Helping children to understand that media construct - as opposed to reflect - reality; that they communicate implicit and explicit values; and that they can influence the way we feel and think about ourselves and the world, are vitally important lessons. 42

<P>&quot;the  only  medium  generally  accessible  to  children  of all  socio-cultural backgrounds &quot;.'43
<P>
<P>The ultimate objective is best summarised by George Gerbner again, who calls for media professionals to 'break the constraints that now bind them to markets that use but have little use for children':
<P>
<P>The need is for. action towards creating a culture, and television system, that can afford to address itself to the nation 's future, its children.... Citizens, writers, actors and producers must work towards a system of popular storytelling whose culture-power cannot devalue and hurt children any more.
<P>
<P>
<P>7,   ADVERTISING AND THE IMPACT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES
<P>
<P>As this paper has already stressed, strongly commercial motives, primarily the need to win audiences and advertisers, influence the content of mass media communication. Advertising is also subject to a combination of legislation and self-regulation in the way it appeals to children.The Council of Europe experts noted that
<P>
<P>Advertisers, in particular, have recently begun to rely' on the impact ofiuvenile seduction, using it in the same way as ~'conventional&quot; erotic advertising. In so doing, they may have the effect of encouraging those who wish to widen the choice of sexual partners by means of overtly paedophile propaganda~44
<P>
<P>Some notorious cases have sent shock waves through the advertising world, such as the Calvin Klein jeans advertisement, which President Clinton is said to have personally intervened to have withdrawn.
<P>
<P>In Europe, legislation focuses largely on banning pornography or protecting children. In Denmark, radio and TV advertising must respect 'decency' - ~ Far more detailed are the self-regulatory codes, which tend to guarantee freedom of expression while at the same time affirming the responsibilities of advertisers.
<P>
<P>Henry Danthan, Executive Manager of the World Federation of Advertisers, which represents national associations and multinational advertising companies, says the concept of self-regulation is largely European and North American, with mechanisms now existing in other countries such as Japan, Australia and South Mrica.
<P>He believes that an 'anti-advertising climate' is being fostered in some parts of Europe because of a misguided moral panic about its influence on children. In other countries, says Danthan, children's role in society is so different that it is not perceived as a problem. &quot;li <I>'S a question which is less at the forefront of regulators' concerns than, for instance, tobacco or alcohol&quot;. </I><FONT SIZE=3>Nevertheless, these days the advertising industry is, without doubt, sensitive about allegations over its use of</FONT>

<P>
<P>children. A report on <B><I>Children and Television Commerciais~ </B></I><FONT SIZE=3>commissioned by the European Advertising Tripartite last year, condemned much research on children and advertising as 'politically motivated'. It concluded that advertising actually had positive effects on children, partly because it contained <I>'virtually no aggression and many examples of prosocial behaviour, breaking down stereotypes</I></FONT>
<P>
<P>The European Advertising Standards Alliance, which brings together the self-regulatory bodies across Europe, carried out its own survey47 <FONT SIZE=3>on the self-regulation of advertising and children, and in particular the use of naked children in adverts. It found that in nine of the 15 European Union countries, the screening of naked children (including sexual organs) was permitted. In Austria, Germany, Ireland and the UK. children had to be partially clothed. And in several of the other countries restrictions relating to taste and decency, and the age of the child, applied.</FONT>
<P>
<P>The survey asked whether self-regulatory bodies had received any reaction from viewers to the use of naked children. Only four: Ireland, France, Portugal and the UK, reported any specific response, with viewers in the UK in particular complaining that such images would be regarded by paedophiles as erotic titillation.
<P>
<P>Henry Danthan believes advertisers now understand the need to adopt high standards in advertising for and by children. Yet the fact remains that shock adverts, like the Calvin Klein example, attract massive extra publicilv.
<P>
<P>In the end, there are two other problems with the concept of self-regulation, highlighted by Simon-Pierre De Coster, a legal advisor with the Belgian broadcaster RTBF. The first is that mechanisms are only equipped to deal with grave breaches of re~ulations. But it is not the grave cases that are the main problem, he points out. It is the accumulative effeci of banal stereotypes that are used everyday without sanction.    Secondly, advertising codes rely on notions such as 'good taste'. 'bad taste' and 'decency'. But how are these terms to be interpreted and implemented? 'What is the broadcaster to make of these texts? They should be defined somewhere'. Both media workers and the public have a crucial role to play in indicating where the bounds of acceptability are drawn, and consumer boycotts of products can have a powerful effect; <I>The mere threat of such action is already effective insofar as a television station is very reluctant to risk seeing a source of advertising revenue diminish or disappear. 48</I>
<P>
<P>But while efforts continue to try to set standards in the existing world of media technology, the development of new forms of communication such as the Internet has opened up new opportunities for paedophiles and pornographers which have brought international concern. Men exchange pornographic accounts of their exploits as sex tourists, for example, supplying details of bars, brothels, and prices.49

Cassirer was declared <I>persona non grata </I>by Thailand, and a warrant issued for his arrest.</FONT>
<P>
<P>Governments have now discovered that the major problem in controlling material on the Internet, is that nobody controls it. In France, net providers went on strike to obtain an assurance from the Ministry of Telecommunications that they were not to blame for child pornography. The Association of French Internet Professionals demanded a legal debate to establish who <I>was </I><FONT SIZE=3>responsible for the material. In the United States free-speech campaigners have won in recent days an injunction against officials attempts control content on the Internet.</FONT>
<P>
<P>Whatever media strategies may emerge in the campaign for children's rights, they will have to be linked to this rapidly-changing media environment, and one that offers much less scope for control and regulation than before.
<P>
<P>
<P>8.	CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
<P>
<P>The International Federation of Journalists, in its proposed amendment to the Drafi Declaration of this Congress, called for action to <B><I>encourage media professionals to develop strategies which strengthen the role of media in providing information of the highest quality, reliability and ethical standards concerning all aspects of (he commercial sexual exploitation of children. </B></I><FONT SIZE=3>The following recommendations are designed to strengthen the key role of journalists in revealing instances of abuse, and also in monitoring the performance of national and international bodies, both in honouring their commitments and working to end the commercial sexual exploitation of children.</FONT>
<P>
<P>There are some simple but practical points to bear in mind here. The media can, without doubt, influence the decision-makers. But to do this effectively, media professionals must choose how and when. For broadcasters, for example:
<P>
<P>Tzme is critical... First, the reporter needs enough air time to present the subject properly. Second, the story must be broadcast at a time when the people who ought to see it will see it. Finally, a sense of social timing is essential. Just as some entertainment shows will sell one year and not the next, so too with news stories; audiences are not static in their responsiveness to social issues.50
<P>
<P>Matters relating to children have traditionally featured more ofien in women 5 magazines and programmes. If children's exploitation is to be given the priority it demands, it must be highlighted in all media, particularly those which reach opinion formers and people taking decisions. This is an issue which touches on the economy, society, education, development, and the environment and it is one occasion when editors must, as American journalist John Mack Carter admits, <I>'strive to present material that not only captures the imagination but also prompts action'.</I>

<P><CENTER>RECOMMEND~ONS FOR FURThER A~ON</CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<P>1.	Training for journalists
<P>a)	Ethical questions should have a higher profile in journalists' training, particularly with regard to standards of conduct in reporting issues like children's exploitation.
<P>
<P>2.	Codes of Conduct and Self Regulation
<P>
<P>a)	While codes of conduct and guidelines appear not to be effective, they can be useful in demonstrating that something needs to be done. Such codes are weapons in the hands of journalists and campaigners who can use them to take up issues with Ldit()rs, publishers; and broadcasters.
<P>
<P>b)	Specific guidelines on reporting child abuse could be drawn up by professional associations to accompany their OLneral ethical codes.
<P>
<P>c)	In preparing this report, the Con1~deration of Asean Journajists suggested that further study ('n this issue b\ mLdia professionals in the regions. Such further activitv is hi(~hlv rLc~)mniLndLd
<P>
<P>3.	Media organisations and ~ dia Professiorial~
<P>
<P>a)	Journalists  <FONT SIZE=2>HidkLrs </FONT><FONT SIZE=3>have a duty to increase public awareness of the dangers of the commercial sexual exploitation of children. However, report needs to he carried out with enormous love.</FONT>
<P>
<P>b)	Journalists and program-makers should add   to the highest standards of professionallisim ans  when confronted <FONT SIZE=2>with   </FONT><FONT SIZE=3>delemmas such as professional secrecy.  </FONT>
<P>
<P>c)	Thev should avoid. or chall;nge. the myths d d stereotypes which surround children, and particularly children from develo~ ng countries. For instance, the myth that parents in developing countries do no value their children; that girls are inferior to t)oys; that children are drawn into vice through their own fault; or that sex touris~i alleviates po&quot;erty for the victim, or the host nation.
<P>
<P>d)	Media professionals should reco~nise that freedom of expression must go hand in hand with other fundamental human rights, including freedom from exploitation and intimidation. They should give careful consideration to the facts when weighing up the relative merits of the different claims, and not allow themselves to be swayed by commercial or political considerations.
<P>
<P>e)	Journalists should never publish details which help exploiters to find their victims, or which undermine the safety of child \~ictims. Journalists should take particular care not to reveal information which could lead to the collapse of criminal proceedings against exploiters.
<P>
<P>f)	Journalists and programme-makers should look for innovative ways to respect the dignity of child victims, and avoid identifying them, while at the same time telling their stories in a compelling and newsworthy way. For instance, by
<P>30
<P>
<P>consulting them on the content or showing ways in which they can escape from their situation.They should try to focus attention not only on the victims of commercial sexual exploitation, but on the perpetrators and clients.
<P>
<P>4.	The Need for Newsroom <B>Debate</B>
<P>
<P>a)	A constructive and supportive debate should be encouraged between media professionals, about how this issue should be investigated and reported.
<P>
<P>b)	Media  organisations  should consider appointing specialist  'children's correspondents', with responsibility for covering all aspects of children's lives. Specific training to help journalists to express children's points of view. This might include: child growth and development, child abuse, risk factors, children's sexual terminology, the law, interviewing techniques, communication with children, etc.
<P>
<P>c)	New means of giving children access to the media, as  sources'  or commentators, should be investigated. Children should know that information or opinions offered in confidence will be protected as such.
<P>
<P>5.	<B>The Role of Management</B>
<P>a)	Media editors and managers should implement -- from the top down -- a policy which makes clear their opposition to biased and sensationalist coverage of the commercial sexual exploitation of children, and their support for high ethical standards among journalists and programme-makers. This could be done through the elaboration, in consultation with media professionals, of ethical guidelines on this and other issues, which should be seriously implemented and monitored.
<P>
<P>6.	Governments and NGOs
<P>a)	Governments or NGOs should support efforts by media organisations and journalists' associations to raise awareness. In this regard, good practice videos for editors and journalists would be useful.
<P>
<P>b)	In particular, support should be given to national women's media associations, sucb as those existing in many Mrican countries, which are taking up the issue of media coverage of violence and violations of the rights of children.
<P>
<P>c)	National NGOs should consider compiling a directory of reliable experts on commercial sexual exploitation of children, and related topics, to be distributed to media. Such information could also be accessible on computer data banks.
<P>
<P>7.	Children and the Community
<P>
<P>a)	Children, from primary school upwards, should undergo media literacy training, to help them understand and decode the messages they receive from both programmes and advertising, so as to become critical and well-informed media consumers.
<P>
<P>b)	The public should recognise and use their power, as audiences and consumers, to affect media policy, for instance through lobbying and consumer boycotts.

<CENTER> <H1>VALUES </h1>AND<h2> THE COMMERCIAL   SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN</h2></CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>by Dr William F. Vendley</CENTER><BR>
<BR>
<BR><P>
 Lin Lin  <B><I>was 13 years old when she was recruited by an agent for work in Thailand.<BR>  Her father took $480.00 from the agent with the understanding that his daughter would pay the loan back out of her earnings. The agent took Lin Lin to Bangkok, and three days later she was taken to the Ran Dee Prom brothel. <BR>Lin Lin did not know what was going on until a man came into her room and ... forced her to have sex. Lin Lin's  clients paid the owner $4.00 each time. If she refused a client's demands, she was slapped and threatened by the owner.<BR> On 18 January 1993 the Thai police raided the brothel, and Lin Lin was taken to a shelter. </I><BR>She <I>was 15 years old, had spent over two years of her life in compulsory prostitution, and tested positive for HIV. (Asia Watch)</B></I><BR></P>
<BR><P>
Lin Lin's story calls us to act. Together we must try to understand and evaluate the social, legal, economic, and cultural forces that are involved in the commercial sexual exploitation of children. And then we must act.<BR></P>
<BR>
But on what basis can we decide <FONT SIZE=3><I>together<B> </I>how we must act?</B></FONT><BR>
<BR><P>
An understanding of values can provide a key. If we can determine how our values overlap, these shared values can serve as a common basis for collaborative action. Shared values could allow us to assess together the numerous, interwoven, and often contradictory value orientations underlying the myriad social factors that are, directly or indirectly, involved in the commercial sexual exploitation of children.<BR></P>
<BR><P>
Values are intensely personal, expressed in each person's decisions and choices. Values are also social in so far as they are held in common  by a group of people. Further, particular values are embodied  in the concrete orientations of our social, economic, legal and cultural institutions.  Thus, even seemingly value-neutral acts, when examined closely, can be recognized to be nested  within systems that are value-laden in relationship to the child.<BR></P>
<BR><P>
We are from different places, represent diverse cultures and societies, and are rooted in different patterns of belief Our value orientations are shaped by our differences. How, then, can we clarify where our values converge and diverge in relationship to children like Lin Lin?<BR></P>
<BR><P>
More specifically, are there<B> <FONT SIZE=3>deeply held values regarding the child that are also widely shared among us? Is there an understanding of the value of the child that appears to be emerging from the convergence of diverse arenas of human experience? <BR>Can such a common understanding of the value of the child provide a norm or standard from which we can work together to assess, understand, and act in relationship to the myriad forces that are implicated in the commercial sexual exploitation of Lin Lin and the children she represents?</B></FONT><BR></P>

 <H3><CENTRE><P>I.INTRODUCTION </P></CENTRE></H3><BR><P>
In the brothels of Manila and Nairobi on the streets of Rio and New York, in the bars of Amsterdam and Bangkok, in buses, railway stations, hotel rooms in all parts of the world, 
millions of children' are at risk of commercial sexual exploitation or already caught in the megadollar sex industry. Children sacrificed to the abuse of power by unthinking and unscrupulous adults; children subjected to violence and serious health hazards;</p><p>
their right to education and all other rights denied; </P><p>
their childhood itself and all aspects of their development undermined;</p> <p>their life prospects severely curtailed. These are the tragic and ugly manifestations of neglect and failure of societies, communities and governments to deal with the widespread problem of children trapped in the sex trade. The educational system is society's instrument to equip children with adequate and appropriate skills and knowledge to fulfill their potential and meet life's responsibilities. Education is a vehicle for transmitting to the next generation, the values, attitudes, beliefs, behaviours and norms considered important by a society; </p><p>
It is also a tool for social transformation. Failure in educational systems feature prominently in perpetuating the practice of commercial sexual exploitation of children;</p><p> 
effective education, therefore, must be an important element in its elimination. What are the possibilities and limits of education in combating the sexual exploitation of children? What can be done to enhance its positive role? </P><p>
These are the questions addressed in this paper.</p>
<center><H3><B>II EDUCATION AND SOCIAL CHANGE</B></H3></center><p>
The commercial sexual exploitation of children is a complex and multi-faceted problem that includes economic, social, cultural and political determinants. Poverty caused by economic disparities and the absence of opportunities for families and young people are major villains in the drama. </P><P>
Social and cultural values and norms of behaviour sometimes foster the indifference toward, even acquiescence of grievous assaults on children. Many legal systems and their enforcement mechanisms fail to deter injustice or protect children from criminal acts committed against them. </P><P>Systems of 
governance often deny a voice to the very sectors of society who need most to be heard -
those affected by exploitation and inequality. Education, itself affected by the interplay of social forces, must therefore, become an instrument of change with a major role in preventing, reducing, and eventually eliminating this practice.</P><P> Acknowledging the distinction between child and adolescent and the varying age definitions according to national and customary law, the term children is used throughout to refer to anyone under the age of 18, as defined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</P><P>
It has been convincingly argued that organized schooling in formal or non-formal programmes 
constitute a tiny fraction of human learning. The major bulk of education and certainly the most enduring part happens through interaction with one's social and physical environment. This learning through life has been described as informal learning in contrast to organized learning through formal and nonformal educational programmes .</P><P>
<center><H3>2 Education in its widest sense happens by circumstance or by design.</H3></center><BR> Children learn more from how they are treated than from what they are taught, and that learning can foster or impede a child's 
healthy development. Education is the creation and building of values and attitudes, skills, beliefs, and behaviours. Children's understanding of themselves and their world is shaped by relationships with important adults and peers in their lives, through role models, observation and instruction. 
Children internalize the lessons they are taught at home, in school, on television and radio, in churches and mosques-as well as on the street, in railway and bus stations, bars and brothels. And what are the lessons that children caught in commercial sex are learning? That adults are not 
trustworthy; that children, especially girls are viewed primarily as property, valued for their short-term economic gain; that decision-making is the privilege of those who have power; and that money, status and possessions are often worth more than dignity, self-respect and even sometimes life, itself .</P><P>
Who are the teachers of those victimized by commercial sexual exploitation? <BR>
These children learn most directly from the abuse of sex exploiters themselves, the customers, the traffickers, pimps, brothel owners and all those who buy and sell, earn money from or pay to have sex with children.</P><P>
But these perpetrators could not exist without the explicit or implicit complicity of society at large-and of those adults responsible for the nurturing, protection, and development of children-families, teachers, health professionals and other service providers, law enforcement officials, religious and community leaders, the media, policy makers and the public at large.<BR>
The challenge for education is two-fold.<BR> First, how can the educational system, working in synergy with other social institutions, become a proactive force for social change? <BR>
The aim of this collaboration is to ensure a change in attitude and practice by all social institutions and systems that will engender protection, respect and promotion of the humanity, dignity and rights 
of children.</P><P>
Second, how can the educational system counteract the negative impact and reinforce the empowering and enabling lessons of informal learning? <BR>
Formal or nonformal educational programmes are not sufficient as they stand, even for those children who are already attending school.<BR>
Education is not a panacea., nor will educational measures alone suffice to combat the 
depredation of children in the sex trade. At the same time, no effort to address the problem will be workable or sustainable without them. 
This paper will show that the educational system can and should contribute far more to the solution than it has done to date.</P><P>
2 Coombs, P.H., and Ahmed, M., Attacking Rural Poverty: How Non-formal Education Can Help, World Bank and Johns Hopkins University Press, 1974.</P><P> 
2 There is something grossly wrong when children and adolescents, instead of attending school and other educational institutions, instead of being nurtured in an environment of care and affection, are deprived of their right to education and forced to live under the shadow of threat, violence and humiliation. Education, in partnership with other instruments or with society, must be used to redress this wrong.</P><P>
<center><H3>HI. A FRAMEWORK OF EDUCATIONAL ACTION TO COMBAT THE COMMERCIAL SEXUAL EXPLOITATION 
OF CHILDREN </H3></center><P>Education, at its best, is an empowering tool for children, 
enabling them to develop the necessary confidence, self-esteem, capacity for 
reasoning and social skills to protect their rights and dignity and to become 
productive, fully participating adult members of society. <BR>Successful education 
can also enable adults whose role is to nurture, care for and educate children 
to understand and act upon their continuing and changing responsibility in 
shaping the development of children. And when designed and carried out 
purposefully, education can create and build the commitment of society as a 
whole to respect the rights and dignity of its children.</P><P> 
<center><H3>1. The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)</H3></center> <BR>Any educational approach to commercial sexual 
exploitation should be based firmly on the letter and the spirit of the 
Convention. An expression of international consensus on the norms and 
standards of behaviour of societies towards their children, the Convention 
spells out obligations of society and the state regarding all children. Its 
ratification by 187 states to-date signals a global commitment to recognize 
and protect all rights for all children.<BR> This near universal acceptance 
represents a unique opportunity for aggressive advocacy and awareness-raising 
on behalf of children.<BR> As the first step to change, awareness raising needs to 
be accompanied by the design and development of mechanisms that create the 
possibilities for families and children to find and choose better 
opportunities. </P><P>The Convention is a relevant framework for educational action:<BR> 
It underscores the links between commercial sexual exploitation and various 
violations of rights;<BR> it establishes fundamental principles and guidelines for 
thinking about and acting on the fulfilment of rights;<BR> and the rights of 
participation by children in decisions affecting their lives has particular 
relevance to education.<BR> The Convention also presents a framework for action, 
guiding us to strategies that combine the rights of children to be protected 
from quote with their rights to be provided with quote. For the Convention 
recognizes that all children are not equally vulnerable to violation of rights 
and that special measures are required for the protection and fulfillment of 
the rights of those children in especially difficult circumstances. Most 
rights of children in commercial sexual exploitation are being breached, the 
right to education among them.<BR> Could enabling these children to exercise their 
right to education facilitate their access to other rights?<BR> Yes-if 
educational strategies recognize the principle of indivisibility-that no 
single article or group of articles can be viewed in isolation from the 
others; they must all be viewed together. Education needs to be accompanied by 
complementary measures, i.e. legislation, new policies, health programmes, 
alternative economic opportunities and the commitment to a change in values in 
attitudes. </P><P>
3 Yes-if the best interests of the child is the central principle for devising strategies in accordance with the rights and obligations of parents, teachers, legal guardians and all relevant legislative 
and administrative measures. <BR>Yes-if children, depending on their developmental stage, are active participants in the decision making process about measures that affect their well-being.<BR> The principle of participation, expressed in Article 12 of the Convention, adds a new dimension to the adult 
world's interaction with children. Only if the adults in a child's life pay 
full respect to her/his judgements and views considering age and degree of 
maturity, can the child become a real participating member of society. In the 
educational process, then, young people must be seen as resources rather than 
victims; their resilience, strength and opinions respected and relied on.</P> 
<center><H3><B>2. An International Commitment </B></H3></center><P>The World Conference on Education for All held in 
Jomtien, Thailand in 1990, the world community pledged to take the necessary 
steps to achieve primary education for all children by the end of the decade. <BR>
Jomtien also articulated an " expanded vision"; of universal basic 
education that went beyond access and enrolment to the quality and relevance 
of learning as a tool for empowerment.<BR> The Jomtien goals have become a 
benchmark for subsequent international expressions of social development 
goals;<BR> notably those of the World Summit for Children (1990),<BR> the 
International Conference on Population and Development (1994),<BR> the World 
Summit for Social Development (1995) and the Fourth World Conference on Women 
(1995). <BR>Commercial sexual exploitation of children is only now being placed on 
the global agenda, and forging a link with education, for prevention and 
recovery, is a new endeavour.<BR> The World Congress in Stockholm represents an 
awakening and a commitment to raise awareness and take action against the 
commercial sexual exploitation of children. At the heart of this commitment 
lies education aimed at changing attitudes and behaviours that will move 
society irrevocably in the direction of eliminating this disabling practice. </P><P>
<center><H3>3. Educational Objectives</H3></center> Given the role of education in promoting social 
change, what should be its priorities and purposes in relation to combating 
the commercial sexual exploitation of children?<BR> They can be seen from two 
inter-linked perspectives </P><P>
1) developing the main objectives for designing and implementing educational programmes; and<BR>
2) identifying the major categories of learners who must be reached. ; <BR>To prevent or at least reduce the risk 
of children falling prey to commercial sex by ensuring their access to and 
participation in education; <BR>; To promote and respect the rights of 
children though relevant content and methods in educational programmes; <BR> 
To enable children through specially designed educational measures and the 
process of recovery to become reintegrated into their families and communities 
when appropriate;<BR>  To enhance the skills, understanding and knowledge of 
relevant and responsible adults regarding the circumstances of children 
involved in commercial sex and of those who are vulnerable;<BR> and 
4  To support awareness-raising, advocacy and social mobilization among the public 
at large about the scope, nature and impact of commercial sexual exploitation 
of children and the need for action.<BR>
<center><H3>4. Categories of Learners </H3></center> Children of school age, whether out-of-school, in-school, or currently in the sex trade 
(and more likely to be out-of-school).<BR> The design of programmes should take 
into account the many relevant differences in needs and behaviours, ages and 
stages of development; differences between boys and girls; children in rural, 
urban and varying cultural environments; <BR>children who have been coerced and 
those who have entered the sex industry without physical coercion; <BR> 
Specific groups of adults and institutions whose role is the nurturing and 
protection and education of children. This includes families and service 
providers (teachers, health professionals, law enforcement officials, 
legislators, NGOs, etc.); <BR> The public at large-citizens, policy 
makers and "opinion leaders", with a focus on the tourist and travel 
industry, and including those who influence the public such as the media, 
religious, community, and mass organizations such as trade unions and 
organizations of youth and women.<BR> The challenge in defining categories of 
learners is to remain focused on those who most need and can most benefit from 
educational programmes, without losing sight of the inter-linking of 
populations and objectives in developing coherent, comprehensive and holistic 
strategies.<BR> For example, the re-integration of children into families and 
communities may necessitate the education of many groups-children, families, 
teachers, health professionals, religious and community leaders, policy makers 
and whole communities.</P> 
<center><H3>IV. EDUCATION STRATEGIES AND MEASURES</H3></center> 
Commercial sexual exploitation of children affects primarily adolescents, a population that 
usually falls between the cracks of public policies. It is intimately related 
to the most sensitive and taboo subjects of sexuality, domestic violence, and 
adolescent pregnancy, which have, until recently, remained private, or family 
matters and not the business of governments, the international community, or 
educational programmes. In its detrimental impact on a child's development, 
commercial sexual exploitation also has much in common with other especially 
difficult circumstances and forms of exploitation, such as child labour, 
organized violence, incest and sexual abuse within the home. <BR>Most children 
exposed to such circumstances require special measures which protect them from 
the damaging consequences, remedy the harm inflicted, offer better 
opportunities, and provide children and families with the skills to take 
advantage of those opportunities.<BR> Developing successful educational strategies 
to combat the practice requires a process of systematic learning, which 
includes identifying what is known and where the gaps are, and looking at what 
has worked, and not worked and why. <BR><P>
5 The conceptual framework of educational objectives, learner populations, and guiding principles for action provide the 
foundation Article 29 of the CRC... the education  for developing 
strategies and programmes of the child shall be directed to the development   to 
help combat the sexual exploitation of children. To reach all children-
those in her/his personality, talents, and mental   danger  or are already 
subjected to the physical abilities to their fullest potential;<BR> gross violation 
of rights, to overall respect  human rights confirm fundemental freedoms; 
respect for the child's parents, his approaches are necessary: or her own 
culture identity, language and  mainstreaming of measures within 
values;<BR> and the preparation of the child for educational programmes for 
responsible life in a free society, in the general spirit of understanding, 
peace, tolerance, equality off all children; <BR>of sexes and friendship among all 
peoples. <BR> Specially-targeted programmes for those who are poorly-served 
or unreachable by mainstream efforts. Expansion of educational access and 
participation of all children including those potentially or actually victims 
of sexual exploitation and steps to enhance the quality and relevance of 
educational content are clearly mainstream measures. <BR>Programmes specifically 
designed for children entrapped in a situation of exploitation are obviously 
special measures outside the mainstream. There is also a need for 
cross-sectoral collaboration, using many educational methods and measures from 
awareness raising to training, that will involve families, teachers, providers 
of social services, and other relevant adults in the educational process.<BR> 
Educational strategies for advocacy and social mobilization are needed to 
support measures to combat sexual exploitation of children. These different 
strategies are described below. 
<center><H3>1. Expanding Access and Participation</H3> </center>Children in school are less likely to be exploited than children not in school, 
although sometimes school children are involved in the sex trade to earn the 
cash needed for school fees, books and uniforms and transportation.<BR> On the 
whole, participation in primary and secondary education is a means of reducing 
the vulnerability of children to exploitation and thus a critical part of 
prevention. At least 130 million children today do not  have access to 
primary education. <BR>Another Article 28 of CRC.. .States Parties recognise 100 
million do not complete a full cycle. the right of the child to education.<BR> 
a) Education beyond the primary level is not make primary education 
compulsory and generally a part of the universal basic available free to all; <BR>
b) encourage the education plan in developing countries, development of 
different forms of secondary although a majority of the children involved 
education, including general and vocational in commercial sex are of secondary 
school education, make them available and age. <BR>According to a UNESCO estimate, 
close to 300 million adolescents beyond the primary school stage are out of 
school. Two-thirds of those are girls and a large majority belong to the poor 
and dis-empowered sectors of society including ethnic and cultural minorities <BR>
* those most vulnerable to exploitation of all form Closing the Gender Gap The persistent gender gap in education both in quantitative and qualitative 
terms, undoubtedly is linked to the fact that girls comprise the majority of 
children at risk of and involved in commercial sex.<BR> Despite the growing 
world-wide effort to improve access to education for girls, drop-out rates 
remain high in many countries and the inequality in attitudes and treatment in 
the classroom continues.<BR> The safety and security of girls and their protection 
from sexual molestation in school and on their way to school itself is an 
issue in many countries.<BR> The development of a conducive learning environment 
that ensures retention and completion of girl learners in an educational 
system, that will enhance their life aspirations, and raise their performance 
expectations and actual achievement, remains a major problem and a necessary 
objective.<BR> A collaborative effort between teachers and administrators in the 
educational system and the community at large including parents, governments 
administrators, and leaders of the civil society is needed to remove the 
cultural, economic and social barriers both within and outside the classroom 
to girls' fill participation in education. <BR>To this end, UNICEF has embarked on 
a major initiative with governments, other agencies and international NGOs. 
Ensuring participation of adolescents, especially girls, in education remains 
an unfinished job. Experience has shown that diversified and flexible 
approaches within an overall unified system are needed to reach the population 
groups deprived of education. Especially innovative programmes are needed for 
girls and other disenfranchised groups.<BR> One approach which addresses 
holistically girls of secondary school age and mostly ethnic minorities is the 
grassroots programme, run by Daughters' Education Programme (DEP) in Northern Thailand<P>. 
<center><H3>2. Enhancing Relevance and Quality of Learning Content and Methods </H3></center>
The Jomtien Declaration on Education for All and Articles 28 and 29 of the CRC 
have defined universal education in terms of enrolment in educational 
programmes, the acquisition of basic competencies and learning achievements, 
and preparation for responsible life in a free society.<BR> Particularly important 
in the context of preventing and combating sexual exploitation of children is 
the emphasis on life skills and learning about rights in the content and 
methodology of educational programmes. <BR>It is widely recognized that a broad 
range of life skills-problem solving, judgement, negotiation, concentration 
and persistence, self-confidence, trust in oneself and in others, and 
identification with one's own culture accompanied by respect for the culture 
of others-is critical to furthering a child's development and to fostering 
her/his well-being. However, many educational systems struggling to ensure 
mere access for all children consider it a luxury to aim for anything beyond a 
basic curriculum. <BR>The basic usually turns out in practice to be the 
acquisition of a body of factual information based on rote memorization. The 
information itself is often irrelevant to the life of the child. Yet, it has 
been demonstrated that :<BR></P><P>
<B>3 SCO, World Education Report, Paris, 1995</B><BR> 7 development of life skills and learning for realizing one's potential are through educational opportunities for rural girls of secondary-school age <BR>
Based on a study which revealed that 60% to 70% of village girls in Chiang Rai 
Province ended up in prostitution after leaving school, DEP was created to 
prevent girls from being forced into the sex industry.<BR> Working in more than 50 
hill tribe and lowland villages of northern Thailand, Daughters' Education 
Programme (DEP) meets weekly with key community leaders such as monks and 
school teachers to determine the families in danger of succumbing to a sale. <BR>
Together, the NGO and the family explore viable alternatives. Among DEP's 
projects, is an educational sponsorship scheme that allows girls to complete 
at least 3 years of secondary school and to leave the programme with the 
education and self-esteem necessary to gain employment, cope with adult life 
and contribute to the community. <BR>When necessary, the programme covers the cost 
of all school fees, uniforms, equipment, activities and transport. In 
addition, DEP organizes study tour programmes to urban slums and red 
light districts, enabling the girls to see for themselves what has happened to 
so many who have gone before. DEP also networks with over 59 other NGOs to 
offer specific help, from agricultural assistance, to loans, skill training or 
relief of some kind. <BR></P><P>The Convention on the Rights of the Child is generally 
seen as an advocacy tool for expansion of educational opportunities for 
children, but its full meaning for the content and methods of education has 
not received sufficient attention. <BR>Knowing about the rights, understanding the 
Convention's principles and spirit, and practicing and exercising the rights

who are being sexually exploited and unlikely to participate in regular school 
programmes. These children have either dropped out of school or have never 
been enrolled. Their age and circumstances make it unlikely that they would 
fit in with other school children or that the school programme would respond 
to their particular social, cultural, emotional and learning needs.</P><P> Children

of social support such as psychological counseling and rebuilding of 
self-esteem, shelter, health and maternity service, child care and legal 
advice and protection. Such programmes also need to be complemented or 
followed by training in occupational skills and advice. With increased concern 
about the vulnerability and exploitation of children, programmes have been

organizations. <BR>The common features of these programmes provide valuable guides

conclusions of a 1994 Latin American Seminar was the need to work with the

in commercial sex.'<BR> An indirect approach often works best Sponsored by the 
international NGO, Child hope, and Rio State University, an adolescent health 
clinic works with out-of-school street youth from Brazilian favelas. Educators 
have discovered that direct HIVIMDS prevention is the least successful aspect 
of the training.<BR> More effective is the segment that focuses on facilitating

Passgem, an NGO based in Recife, Brazil, faced the girls' feelings of 
powerlessness and fatalism regarding their ability to prevent disease by 
relying on known survival skills and strengths. Showing the girls slides of 
contaminated water to prove that viruses, though invisible, do exist, the 
staff persuaded them that if they had the resourcefullness to protect 
themselves by eluding police, they could protect themselves from a tiny 
virus.<BR> Learning to revalue their bodies Casa de Passagem also uses dance and 
drama to help young women gain positive connection to their bodies. Despite 
extensive sexual experience, many exploited adolescent girls lack the basic 
knowledge about their own bodies and make little effort to protect themselves. 
Other programmes encourage girls to draw their own bodies or use mirrors to 
promote self-reflection and respect. <BR>
5. Education for Relevant Adults Adults with a role in the nurturing, protecting and participation in the healthy development of children have a special responsibility. For they are the direct 
teachers and role models of t1Lessons Learned in Assisting Sexually-Exploited

children, in the home, in the classroom and in the larger world, including the 
police station and courtroom where so many children in commercial sex wind up. 
For adults to accept their ongoing responsibility towards the developing 
child, to become proactive partners and social change agents they need first 
to understand the harmful impact of commercial sexual exploitation on 
children and society and to become aware of their own contributing attitudes 
and behaviours.<BR> 
5.1 Families Educational efforts need to be directed toward helping families understand the link between economic burdens and values, to 
understand the Helping families, helping children impact of their behaviour In

Teachers as an Interactive Dialectic Process: Examples from South Asia, 
Convergence, Vol., XXVIII, No 3, 1995. 14 reform programmes demonstrated that 
such training was one of the three most critical interventions.<BR> 
5.3 Service Providers Health services are often inaccessible, inadequate and inappropriate 
for adolescents. They are available usually only during school hours, and 
young people often perceive critical and judgmental attitudes by health 
professionals and support staff as well as an unwillingness to respect their 
confidences.' In addition, many social workers, NGOs and others who provide 
services to children in difficult circumstances, find their effectiveness 
impeded by their own frustrations, judgements and powerlessness in the face of 
difficult and resistant behaviours and attitudes of street girls, in 
particular those who are or have been in prostitution. They may engage in 
attempts to 'reform&quot; young men and women involved in commercial sex, or 
get them to &quot;change their ways&quot; without listening, understanding, 
helping them to develop life and vocational skills that enable them to make 
their own decisions about whether or not to change their behaviour. As a 
result, many youth services are underutilized because some providers have 
judgmental attitudes, especially with regard to reproductive services.&quot; 
Because the appropriate place of these professionals is at the forefront of 
enlightened, supportive and non-judgmental behaviour and of social 
mobilization and advocacy, it is particularly important that they become 
social actors in support of children's rights beginning with their own 
behaviour. Training workshops that raise awareness of service providers about 
their own attitudes can lead to the development of user-friendly and 
accessible educational services with outreach to the hard-to-reach, reluctant 
populations of the young. Agencies whose programmes include income generation 
and vocational skills development need themselves to be trained about the 
relevancy and appropriateness of their training. <BR>
5.4 Law Enforcement Officials Of special concern is the direct and indirect complicity of police and other officials of the legal system with a special responsibility for creating and 
enforcing laws that protect children and respect their rights Police and 
courtroom personnel from judges to prosecutors need to learn that treating 
children as offenders and/or adults is not only contrary to the CRC and many 
national laws, but counterproductive. They need the skills and tools of 
specially-trained personnel to create a supportive, child-friendly environment 
in police stations, courtrooms or at borders where trafficked children may 
find themselves isolated and in danger. Police could (and should) play a 
pivotal educational and supportive role in prevention, protection and 
rehabilitation. As role models, they can also help children learn their rights 
and find ways to leave prostitution. In some countries, for example, Peru, 
NGOs and others are developing programmes for police training in child rights; 
in Nepal, police units are working in tandem with the NGO Maiti, UNESCO and

from selling their children to traffickers. <BR>
6. Education of the Public and Social Mobilization A measure of accountability lies with all sectors of 
society for the existence and continuation of commercial sexual exploitation 
of children. In addition to those mentioned in the previous section, this 
includes religious and community leaders who may view adolescents as immoral 
or uncontrollable, travel and tourist personnel who do not think about the 
ramifications of having sex with children, policy makers and legislators who 
believe that making pronouncements and passing laws are the limit of their 
responsibility; the public who sees the problem as somebody else's. Education 
of the public, primarily through the media has been used successfully in many 
areas of social action, world-wide-in family planning, anti-smoking 
campaigns, use of condoms, hotlines for battered women, breast-feeding 
campaigns. It can also be used to prevent and help the process of recovery and 
reintegration for children endangered by commercial sexual exploitation.

mobilization begins with an assessment-who do we want to reach? Row do we 
want to reach them? What is the appropriate and desired message? And what is 
the best medium for the audience? It must take into account the relationship 
between the communication capacity and the responsiveness of the social 
environment. <BR><P>

<CENTER><H3>V.  FROM STRATEGIES TO ACTION: THE NEXT STEPS</H3></CENTER> 
VI.  1. Action at the Country Level The strategies described in this paper need to be adapted 
into a coherent package in a country setting. The specific mix of priorities, 
objectives and activities will vary depending on the particular dimensions of 
the national problem. Assessment of the needs and magnitude of the problem has 
to be based on a diagnostic analysis of the situation, preferably as a 
collaborative 17 effort 11among all principal actors in the country on issues 
of children's well-being. Other critical measures include the following: ~ 
Building Partnerships Neither the NGOs which are often the activists in 
respect to commercial sexual exploitation of children, nor the government 
alone can solve the problems. A partnership must be developed to tackle the 
range of preventive and remedial efforts among government authorities at 
different levels, national and international NGOs, research and training 
institutions, community groups, communications media, business and external 
donors. <P>
<BR>.2 Creating a Network of Non-governmental Organizations Frontline 
work with children in the sex trade or those at risk is being carried out by 
NGOs and community-based organizations, many of which are very small. Such 
organizations are often created by caring individuals who receive initial 
support from charitable, religious or welfare bodies. Combined efforts will 
have a larger impact and greater sustainability than any individual effort; 
coalitions need to be supported and recognised as a permanent and important 
feature of a national programme for combating the problem. To achieve these 
ends, it is necessary for the NGOs to work together to pool skills, enhance 
capacities, and, in particular, to interact with government and municipal 
authorities.</P><BR><P>
.3 Giving Children a Voice Apart from the general right of 
children to participate in decisions that affect them, programmes are more 
likely to succeed, when children and youth are allowed to articulate their own 
views and concerns regarding their difficult circumstances. This may mean 
encouraging cultural activities such as theatre, singing festivals, and 
exhibitions by youth groups and institutions. Opportunities for advocating 
their own cause by children and youth have to be built into all programmes and 
in such initiatives as Mayors as Defenders of Children&quot;.</P> <BR><p> 
.4 Research Research, and the development of research tools should be an essential part of 
action aimed at protecting exploited and vulnerable children. Not enough is 
known about the extent and nature of the problem in different social, 
cultural, economic and political settings. Children's downward progression 
from circumstances that place them at risk into involvement in an exploitative 
situation is not often understood. Research institutes, statistical bureau and 
NGOs are important partners in action-oriented and participatory research, 
which can fill the gap in knowledge -essential for designing effective 
programmes and evaluating them.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i> *A recent paper by UNICEF on policies and strategies related to the 
protection of children has endorsed the two-prong mutually-supportive 
approaches of mainstreaming and targeted activities. This strategy calls for 
partnerships to extend relevant and quality education to the most vulnerable 
and disadvantaged children, as well as combining education with other 
essential social services.</i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
2. Global Advocacy It is undeniable that in the context of chauvinistic 
defensiveness and denial on the sensitive subject of children in commercial 
sex, international expose', debate and advocacy have helped to influence 
public policy and change attitudes. These international and regional efforts 
have to continue, especially in re-orienting mainstream educational systems 
and developing creative programmes with a targeted approach. However, all 
advocacy must be conducted in such a way that children are not harmed by 
sensationalism or insensitive exposure. Thoughtless messages that imply 
connections between abusive and exploitative circumstances and particular 
ethnic or cultural groups may reinforce negative stereotypes about members of 
those minority groups, adding to their stigmatization and exclusion.<BR><P></P> 
2.1 Promoting National and Local Capacity-building and Empowerment. External 
organizations cannot by themselves make a significant difference for exploited 
or vulnerable children in a country; nor it is their role to solve national 
problems. The appropriate and important contribution of external organizations 
including external donors, intergovernmental bodies and external NGOs is to 
support catalytic and strategic actions to promote and strengthen national 
policies, priorities and programmes through collaboration with appropriate 
national partners and counterparts. The main thrust of collaboration would be 
to enhance the skills and capacities of the indigenous organizations so that 
the policies and programmes in a country become increasingly self-reliant and 
sustainable.<BR><P></P>
 2.2 A Coordinated Approach at the National Level. It is especially important that external organizations follow a co-ordinated approach 
in developing and carrying out their assistance activities. It is neither 
expected nor desirable, that all international co-operation fit into the 
straitjacket of a particular national policy or plan, especially when workable 
solutions are yet to be found. Diversity and creativity are strengths in 
tackling such intractable and complex issues as the sexual exploitation of 
children. At the same time, international assistance needs to recognize the 
primacy of indigenous responsibility and aim at developing national capacities 
to prevent the dissipation of scarce national resources in too-divergent or 
conflicting programmes. External organizations need to engage in dialogue with 
national authorities, recognizing, understanding and supporting their 
priorities and objectives both in mainstream and targeted educational efforts 
for children at special risk. <BR><p><CENTER><H3>VI. CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER> If the world-wide alert sounded by 
the Congress is to be heeded, the educational strategies and measures outlined 
above have to be transformed into action. The value of independent efforts by 
governments, local and international NGOs, UN and multi-lateral agencies, 
donors and the media cannot be underestimated; they have raised consciousness, 
aroused the conscience and begun to chart the direction for concerted action. 
But so far, together, they have only nibbled at different parts of the 
problem. If the commercial sexual exploitation of children is ever to be 
eliminated, or even reduced, education must be a true force for change. To do 
this, it must reach across school and community and include children and 
adults; it must be based firmly on the CRC, which obliges States Parties and 
civil society to respect and safeguard the rights of all children. And it must 
embrace the fundamental principles of self worth, participation, respect for 
others and self sufficiency. But education does not work in isolation. Only a 
global commitment of partnership, purpose, and a sense of urgency by all 
sectors and all levels of society will make a dent in this forbidding obstacle 
to children's dignity and development.

<CENTER>CHILD PORNOGRAPHY: </CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>AN INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE</CENTER>
<BR>

<H2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H2>
<BR>
Child pornography is a problem of international proportion. The global community has recognised that children are at risk from those who engage in the production, exhibition, distribution, and consumption of child pornography and that children can suffer serious negative effects as a result of pornographic exploitation. The United Nations Convention on the Rights off the Child (''CRC&quot;), which has been ratified by an overwhelming majority off the nations of the world, identifies child pornography as a violation against children and requires that nations who are parties to the convention take measures to prevent the exploitative use of children in pornographic materials. Despite the notable efforts of many nations, child pornography remains a serious issue.<BR>
<BR>
Challenges to any study of international child pornography include:  I) the lack of any uniform definition of what child pornography entails;  2) lack of data regarding the production and distribution of child pornography in many parts of the world, particularly Africa and Latin America; and 3) shifting global patterns of production and consumption of child pornography.<BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, the development of home video equipment and computer technology has revolutionised the international production and distribution of child pornography. Rapidly expanding international access to increasingly inexpensive technology has transformed child<BR>
pornography into a sophisticated cottage industry. Computer alteration of images and the potential for creating computer generated pornography pose formidable challenges for courts and law enforcement officials throughout the world.<BR>
<BR>
This paper begins by providing a definition of child pornography, examining tile scope of tile problem, and describing the characteristics of both victims and exploiters. It presents a discussion off the uses of child pornography and off the effects that child pornography may have on both child victims and on potential and actual offenders.<BR>
<BR>
The paper also identifies some of the major centres of global production and consumption of child pornography and spends considerable time discussing the impact of computer technology on the production and distribution of material that sexually exploits children. The remainder of the paper is dedicated to a discussion of individual national strategies desired to counter both traditional and computer child pornography through regulatory measures.  While only a small number of countries can be surveyed due to space considerations, this paper assumes that child pornography is a pressing problem on local, national and international levels and that all nations have an important part to play in the solution.<BR>

<H2>I.	DEFINITION OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY</H2>
<BR>
The question of what constitutes child pornography is extraordinarily complex. Standards that are applied in each society or country are highly subjective and are contingent upon differing moral, cultural, sexual, social, and religious beliefs that do not readily translate into law. Even if we confine ourselves to a legal definition of child pornography, the concept is elusive. Legal definitions of both &quot;child&quot; and &quot;child pornography&quot; differ globally and may differ even among legal jurisdictions within the same country.<BR>
The legal definition of a &quot;child&quot; varies among nations. The UNCRC defines a child as a person under 18 years of age. This definition, however, is far from being universally adopted. For example, in all Australian States and Territories, child pornography legislation defines &quot;child&quot; as a person under 16 years of age. In Canada (Penal Code Sec. 163), a minor, for purposes of child pornography, is a person under 18 years of age. Iii various jurisdictions of the United States (U.S.), minors as young as 1 5 may legally consent to sexual activity with an adult. However, that same adult could not create, distribute, or possess a visual record of that activity because federal child pornography statutes (18 U. S.C. 2252, 2256) define a minor as any person under that age of 18 years.<BR>
<BR>
Despite national differences, some international bodies have been able to arrive at common definitions of child pornography, most of which focus on usual, rather than written material. The Council of Europe defines child pornography as &quot;any audio-visual material which uses children in a sexual context.&quot;' International Criminal Police Organisation (&quot;INTERPOL&quot;) delegates define child pornography as &quot;the visual depiction of the sexual exploitation of a child, focusing on the child's sexual behaviour or genitals. <BR>
<BR>
For the purposes of this paper, recognising that each county's legal definition of &quot;child d&quot; may' be different, the term &quot;child pornography&quot; will refer to a &quot;sexually explicit reproduction of a child's image. &quot;3 Child pornography is to be distinguished from &quot;child erotica&quot; which is &quot;any material relating to children that serves a sexual purpose for a given iii individual. Child erotica includes such items such as toys, games, children's clothing, sexual aids, manuals, drawings, catalogues, and non-pornographic photographs of children. Child erotica is not<BR>

Id. at 26.illegal but is frequently used by prosecutors as corroborating evidence in cases against child molesters or child pornographers.<BR>
<BR>
The definition of child pornography, in some countries, is harm-based. For example, U.S. law which is characterised by an elaborate commitment to the protection of free speech has addressed the issue of child pornography from the perspective of preventing harm to child victims iatlier than censoring expression. Child pornography is criminalised in the United State~ because it represents &quot;the permanent record off the sexual abuse or exploitation of an actual child 6 The Films, Videos. and Publications Classification Act (1993) promulgated in New /Zealand makes similar reference to child pornography as a &quot;permanent recording of the exploitation of children or young persons for sexual purposes.&quot;  The approaching   capacity to produce lifelike computer generated pornography will challenge  harm based definitions of child pornography.<BR>
<BR>
II.	SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM<BR>
<BR>
Child pornography is an international phenomenon. Most of the data that exists regarding     of the problem has focused on North America and Northern Europe-regions   have played a key role ii) the production. distribution and consumption of child pornography.  In developing countries, the reality of child pornography is dwarfed by the magnitude of other problems such as poverty. infant mortality, illiteracy, hunger, and disease and often there is little reliable data oil the subject. Nonetheless, the pornographic exploitation off minors is a phenomenon that exists throughout the world.some experts distinguish &quot;sexual molester&quot; or abusers from sexual exploiters' employing the term &quot;sexual exploitation&quot; to describe only commercial interactions or to distinguish extra familiar abuse  that which occurs within the family. The terms child molester&quot; and &quot;child abuser&quot; will be used interchangeably in this paper to denote a significantly older person to engages in sexual activity with someone who is legally a child. The term &quot;child exploiter&quot; will include those who sexually molest children as well as those who sexually exploit children through the production. distribution, and/or collection of child pornography.<BR>
<BR>
Lanning, supra note 3, at 24. As stated previously. it may be legally permissible to engage in sexual activity with a 16 or 17 year old in some jurisdictions. The filming of that child counter would be illegal tinder federal law but the depiction could not be considered a record of' the abuse of a child.<BR>
&quot;The U. S. market for child pornography is widely thought ought to be the most lucrative in the world.&quot; Child Pornography and Pedophillia: Report Made by the Permanent Subcommittee oil Investigations. U.S. Senate, 99th Congress. 2d Sec. 34(1986)  U.S. Senate Report.<BR>
<BR>
1.	Identifying the Victims<BR>
<BR>
Girls and boys of all ages, including infants, are used to produce pornography around the world. Estimates off the number of children world wide involved in child pornography range from thousands to hundreds of thousands. While impossible to obtain accurate data, a perusal off the child pornography readily available on the international market indicates that a significant number of children are being sexually exploited through this medium.<BR>
<BR>
As to the gender of the victims, Federal Bureau of Investigation (&quot;FBI&quot;) personnel estimate that over 50% of all child pornography seized in the United States depicts boys rather than girls. Canadian Customs puts that figure at 750/0' for Canada. In contrast, in Japan, it is female minors that are predominantly exploited in pornographic material. The gender of the child victims displayed via computer networks is constantly in flux and difficult to determine with any precision.<BR>
<BR>
In most countries, street children, poor children, juveniles from broken homes, and disabled minors are especially vulnerable to sexual exploitation and to being seduced or coerced into the production of pornographic material. These children, however, are not the only victims. Sex exploiters frequently target neighbourhood children or those with whom they have contact through their vocation or avocations. Additionally, pornographic activity is a common part of life for teen prostitutes. En initially, in many countries, including developed nations, child victims may come from homes where their own parents use them to create child pornography or where their parents offer them to others for the same purpose.<BR>
<BR>
Sex rings, which involve the simultaneous sexual exploitation of more that one child but are not necessarily commercial, exist in many countries and frequently involve the use of children in the creation of pornographic material. In the United States, they consist largely of loosely organised child abusers. According to one 1989 study, 3 1 sex rings were identified by police in the United Kingdom over a two year period in a geographically defined population of 7lO,000.<BR>
<BR>
2.	Identifying the Exploiters<BR>
<BR>
Child exploiters and pornographers represent a cross-section of the larger community including highly esteemed members of the population. Furthermore, they frequently seek occupations that bring them into habitual contact with children. Producers (including photographers, publishers and creators of home videos), middlemen (including procurers and parents), distributors, (including advertisers and those who trade) as well as child<BR>
pornography collectors, are included in the category of exploiters.<BR>
<BR>
*The data regarding childhood sexual abuse in most countries, including the U.S. and Canada, does not reflect the same predominance of boy victims. Virtually all studies have found higher sexual abuse rates for girls. Aim Wolbert Burgess &amp; Christine A. Grant, Children Traumatised in Sex Rings, 4 (1988).<BR>
<BR>
Paedophiles constitute a significant sector of the offenders.  The American Psychiatric Association defines paedophilia as a disorder in which an adult's primary sexual attraction Is to prepubescent children, generally age 13 and under 9. Because this is a psychiatric diagnosis, and because it is impossible to fix pubescence at any exact age, law enforcement agents often employ a broader definition of paedophilia to include adults with a sexual preference for individuals legally considered children. <BR>
<BR>
Some paedophiles are attracted to children of the same sex, but the majority of paedoph lIes are heterosexual. Additionally, it is important to note that not all paedophiles are child molesters and that many child molesters are not paedophiles--even under a broad definition. The term &quot;preferential child molester&quot; can be used to distinguish those paedophiles who act on their impulses and sexually abuse children from those who simply fantasize about sexual activity with children.<BR>
<BR>
Child pornography serves significant purposes for both paedophiles and child molesters. Preferential child molesters often possess large collections of child pornography that are meticulously catalogned and carefully guarded. They, however, are not the only ones who produce or consume child pornography. A much broader segment of the population is interested in pornography featuring pubescent children in their teens. Additionally, with the emergence of the use of computers to traffic in child pornography, a new and growing segment of producers and consumers is being identified. They are individuals who may not have a sexual preference for children, but who have seen the gamut of adult pornography and who are searching for more bizarre material.<BR>
<BR>
Ill.	GLOBAL  PRODUCTION   AND  <B>CONSUMPTION  OF  CHILD PORNOGRAPHY</B><BR>
<BR>
The world-wide flow of pornography is difficult to describe with any precision but a brief examination of some of the major international production centres offers a sense of the global supply and demand. in Asia, Japan is the most important centre for the commercial production of child pornography, producing a significant and increasing amount of &quot;teen<BR>
pornography&quot; that depicts young Japanese girls in sexually explicit poses in teen magazines.11 Japan also produces millions of erotic comics that are targeted at young students and readily available in vending machines in most Japanese cities. Japanese child pornography reflects a special appeal for sex with Japanese girls who are often depicted in school uniforms.  Pornography invoking pre-pubescent children is also available commercially in Tokyo.<BR>
<BR>
American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental<BR>
Disorders:	DSM-IV 527-28 (1994).<BR>
<BR>
Lanning, supra note 3, at 2. This paper employs the broader law enforcement definition with the understand~g that the definition may include a large number of individuals with an attraction to pubescent teenagers--a condition which is not considered a psychiatric disorder in most countries. Additionally, the broader definition does not concentrate attention on a sector which societies consider &quot;abnormal&quot; while ignoring a much larger segment of society that may participate in the production and consumption of pornography.<BR>
<BR>
Japanese child pornography is distributed in Asia and world-wide. U.S. law enforcement<BR>
officials in California report seizing material depicting the exposed genitals of pre-pubescent Japanese children.  Canadian Customs reports that pornographic materials involving Japanese children are found in the possession of crew members of Japanese cruise ships. Japanese child pornography is also circulating oh the Internet. The Yakuza, Japanese organised crime, previously controlled tile sex industry in Japan. Some commentators report that tough Japanese anti-mob laws, however, have loosened the Yakuza's grip in recent years.'2<BR>
<BR>
The early 1970's marked the heyday of commercial production of child pornography iii the Western world. Denmark, Holland, and, to a lesser extent, Sweden, were the main centres of production in Europe. Most of the children depicted were caucasian. Many who were featured in European child pornography magazines were photographed in the United States and the photos were published in magazines assembled abroad. Some of the material produced ill Europe during the 70's, however, included children from India and Mexico and one series included black children from Africa. '3 By the mid-70's, commercially distributed child pornography became widely available ill the United States and Europe.<BR>
<BR>
the late 1970's and early 80's brought increased governmental regulation, first in the United States and later in Europe. As a result, commercial distribution is <B>110 </B>longer a major means of circulating such material. The majority of child pornography disseminated internationally is in fact, exchanged between paedophiles and child molesters without any commercial motive. Furthermore, while there is evidence that organised crime is involved in adult pornography, the same is not generally true in regard to child pornography.'4<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The overwhelming majority of child pornography seized in the United States has not been produced or distributed for profit ... Instead, the cost must be measured in terms off the sexual exploitation of children represented by child pornography, and the sexual abuse of children to which child pornography is a central contributing factor. It is not necessary to view child pornography as a hugely lucrative, organised crime-controlled underground in order to appreciate the scope of the damage to society caused by this reprehensible practice. &quot;'~<BR>

<BR>
'4	Pornography produced using underage models resembling adults (sometimes referred to a &quot;technical&quot; child pornography), however, accounts for a small portion of pornography controlled by organised crime.<BR>
<BR>
While it is true that the availability of commercial child pornography has declined, there are those who continue to profit from its production and distribution. Commercial production and consumption still exists in both Europe and the United States, as we as in Japan. Additionally. &quot;amateur&quot; pornographic material is being produced ill many countries iii including Mexico, the Philippines, and Brazil (often utilising street children) for importation into North America. 16<BR>
<BR>
A further source of child pornography distributed world-wide is that created by sex tourists who travel to other countries to have sex with minors. Most of the child victims of sex tourism reside in the developing nations of the world. In March 1996, a court in Thailand convicted a German national of child molestation and production of pornography for commercial purposes; he was involved in a child pornography <B>ring </B>which exploited Thai children.' Until approximately two years ago, a sizeable portion of the pornography seized in Sweden and in the Netherlands was produced by sex tourists visiting Asia. Some of that material has now been replaced by child pornography produced in Eastern Europe. Members of the military assigned to other countries have also played a role. According to the U.S. Justice Department, military personnel stationed in Guam and the Philippines have been prosecuted for possession of child pornography.  Often the same personnel have participated in the production off the material.<BR>

The distinction between &quot;amateur&quot; and &quot;commercial&quot; child pornography is far from clear. Olice child pornography enters the public sphere, even if by trade or gift. it becomes available to anyone who chooses to use it for monetary gain. Liz Kelly, et al., Splintered Lives:<BR>

<BR>
The development of new technology has made a tremendous impact on the international production and distribution of child pornography. The first important leap in technology was the video camera. Video cameras and camcorders are now less expensive and are relatively common in many homes in industrialised countries. Because the recording media does not have to be commercially processed, and can be easily duplicated, individuals enjoy complete privacy. As a result, amateur pornographic videos have become increasingly common.<BR>
<BR>
In the United Kingdom, detecting the possession and distribution of pornographic home videos featuring children continues to be an important priority of law enforcement officials. Likewise, most of the new child pornography currently seized by the U.S. Postal Service is still contained in home-made videos. U.S. officials believe, however, that with the advent of advanced technology, it will be just a matter of time before this amateur materials will be available on the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
IV.	THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY<BR>
Computer technology has transformed the production of child pornography into a sophisticated global cottage19 industry. Anyone who has access to a computer and a modem potentially has access to commercial on-line services and to the Internet, a remarkable global network of nearly 30 million persons joined by computers. Among many other things, such access means that it is possible both to send and receive pornography. The Internet is becoming an increasingly significant factor in child sexual exploitation and the development of increasingly inexpensive personal computers and modems has given ascent to what is rapidly becoming the most important exchange medium for child pornography.<BR>
<BR>
A brief review of the new computer technology and its possibilities will offer an idea of the revolution that has occurred.<BR>
<BR>
Pictures can be scanned and video clips can be captured into a computer without any loss of quality either over time or when copies are made. It is now possible to attach these images and video clips to e-mail text. Non-colour digital cameras are available in the United States for US$99 and colour scanners (devices that can convert photographs, slides, negatives, and text into computer characters) for US$200. A video capture device is available for US$129. This device makes it possible to record images from a video camera or a VCR directly into the computer. A new generation of &quot;Internet dedicated&quot; computers are being developed with a targeted price of US$500.<BR>
<BR>
<I>19 The term is used here to denote that technology has facilitated the production and distribution of child pornography in the home.</I><BR>
<BR>
Anonymity is available on the Internet. A user can manufacture virtually any identity and route a message from Pennsylvania, through Australia, to Germany and then to Kansas where it would be impossible to determine the origination. It is also possible to re-route e-mail  images through what are referred to as &quot;an anonymous remailers.&quot; these take incoming messages and remove the source address, assign an anonymous identification code number with the remailer's address, and forward it to the final destination. Responses to the anonymous messages are then similarly encoded and the responder likewise remains anonymous. The most popular of these remailers, among on-line paedophiles is located in Finland.<BR>
<BR>
	The industry is experiencing a rapid development in cheap, user-friendly encryption software which is employed by child pornographers. Decoding the files is often extremely difficult for law enforcement agencies.<BR>
<BR>
	The Internet can be used to make contacts with other paedophiles and child molesters and is used to distribute home made and commercial child pornography around the world. An individual may now trade and/or sell images of almost any kind from one end off the world to the other.<BR>
<BR>
	Even if law enforcement officials discover the image, the ability to distribute it may not be impaired. once an image is introduced on the Internet, it can be downloaded by any number of users and can be reproduced repeatedly without any loss of quality.<BR>
<BR>
	Advanced technology is making transmission increasingly faster. High speed modems of 28,800 bits per second (&quot;BPS&quot;) are currently available but soon it will be possible to boost that capacity to 550,000 BPS via high speed modems using cable television wire. This is significant because transmission and downloading of images can be time consuming and therefore costly.<BR>
<BR>
	Computer bulletin boards can be set up exclusively to exchange information about sexual interest in minors or specifically to allow for running conversations by computer on such subjects. Monitoring of such sex oriented bulletin boards has indicated that these boards receive thousands of calls. In most countries, neither licences nor registration for bulletin boards is required.<BR>
<BR>
	Letter writing by paedophiles, experiments in the past, is now being replaced by much more rapidly transmitted computer conversations.21<BR>
<BR>
	Despite increasing use of computers by paedophiles, according to the U.S. Postal<BR>
Service, pornographers still rely heavily on the mails to exchange video tapes and computer diskettes.<BR>
	Computers now come with built in microphones and speakers and will soon be routinely equipped with cameras.  Monitors also frequently come with built-in speakers and microphones. This equipment will enhance the capacity for production and distribution of home videos.<BR>
<BR>
	Images can now be altered by computer. For example, it is not difficult to add objects to an image. one can also delete objects or parts of a photo. An individual may superimpose a child's face on an adult's body, erase pubic hair or facial hair, and reduce and minimise breasts so as to make adult images look like children.<BR>
<BR>
	While it is still impossible to create entirely computer generated images that appear lifelike, it is, however, possible to insert digital images of a person into a video in which they have not appeared. Technology will soon be able to facilitate the creation of lifelike child pornography without using any real children at all.<BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, on-line capability greatly increases the possibility of extended contact--up to hundreds of hours--with children, by child molesters or paedophiles. Sex exploiters have easy access to children via computer--especially lonely or troubled teens--by tuning into chat sessions, such as Internet Relay Chat, and making contact with children.  The most commonly used technique for seducing the child into sexual activity is by capitalising on the child's natural need for attention, affection and approval. According to the FBI and other law enforcement agents, a small but rising number of these computer relationships end up with actual contact and sexual activity with the teen.<BR>
<BR>
The problem of computer child pornography involves persons who have the time, the resources, the intelligence and perhaps a compulsion to acquire expertise in the technology. They are from every walk of life. Children in many developed countries are some of the most sophisticated computer operators. They have grown up with computers and have often far surpassed their parents in expertise. These children already have fairly easy access to computer child pornography and are potentially accessible through the Internet and some commercial on-line services to those who wish to sexually exploit minors. In addition, software programs which are designed to block children's access to questionable material are capable of being defeated by children who have acquired advanced computer skills.<BR>
<BR>
Computerised child pornography is off the highest concern in industrialised countries where computers have become commonplace in schools, in the workplace and in the home. Access to computers, however, is increasing globally. In Australia, according to a 1995 survey, only about 10% of Australian residences had the necessary computer and modem for obtaining child pornography on line. Nonetheless, Australian law enforcement officials agree that as computers become more available and user-friendly and as the computer literate population steadily rises, the use of home computers to produce and distribute child pornography will increase.<BR>
<BR>
<B>V.	REASONS FOR CHILD PORNOGRAPHY<BR>
</B>
<BR>
Experts cite several reasons why individuals collect child pornography.21<BR>
<BR>
1.	Arousal and gratification: Individuals use pornography to stimulate their sexual drive and to aid in sexual stimulation. Some may only fantasise and others may use it as a prelude to actual sexual activity with minors.<BR>
<BR>
2.	Validation and justification of paedophile behaviour; The paedophile uses pornography to convince him/her self that their behaviour or obsession is not abnormal but is shared by thousand of other sensitive, intelligent and caring people.<BR>
<BR>
3.	To lower a child's inhibitions: Child abusers use pictures of other  children having sex to assist in the seduction of a child and encourage reluctant children to freely participate. Images are often used as a way to show a child what the offender wants the child victim to do. Pornography may be used under the guise of &quot;sex education&quot; to create sexual arousal in the child.<BR>
<BR>
4.	Presentation of the child's youth: Child pornography ensures that there will always be an image of the child at the age of sexual preference.<BR>
<BR>
5.	Blackmail: Sexually explicit images are used to ensure the lifelong silence of the victimised child by threatening to show the pictures to parents, peers or others. Child victims will not always report pictorial records--even if they report sexual abuse--because they may be ashamed of what happened to them as well as of their participation in the pornography.<BR>
<BR>
6.	A medium of exchange: Child pornography is used as a means of establishing trust and camaraderie with other paedophiles and molesters and as proof of their good intentions when establishing contact with other exploiters.  It is a medium of communication with fellow exploiters in public and private sex markets.<BR>
<BR>
7.	Access: Some exploiters exchange pornography to gain access to other markets and to other children.<BR>
<BR>
8.	Profit: Although most do not sell child pornography, there are some paedophiles and child molesters who sell home-made videos and photos on a one-to-one basis. Some child exploiters sell their self-produced materials to finance trips overseas to popular sex tourist destinations.<BR>
	         21	Senate Report, supra note 7, at 10-12.<BR>
<BR>
Arguably then, child pornography does not merely involve the abuse of the individual child victim depicted, but rather can be used to perpetuate the sexual exploitation of other children who have not been pornographically exploited. Furthermore, child pornography serves to desensitise society and to send a message that children are legitimate sex partners.<BR>
<BR>
VI.	<B>THE CONNECTION BETWEEN CHILD PORNOGRAPHY </B><B>AND</B> <B>CHILD SEX ABUSE CRIMES</B><BR>
<BR>
Considerable controversy' exists within the social and behavioural science community about the negative effects, If any, of child pornography upon the behaviour of potential or actual offenders. The main reason for the debate is that it is virtually impossible to conduct research in the laboratory using standard scientific methods which yield statistically reliable results. The constraints of ethical research, false reporting, interviewer distortion and a whole host of other problems contribute to the difficulty of acquiring scientific results. Many researchers have come to the conclusion that there is no sound scientific basis for concluding that exposure to child pornography increases the likelihood of sexual abuse of children. others have suggested that there is a consistent correlation between the use of pornography and sexual aggression. Some social scientists interpret the research to indicate that the use of child pornography is a precursor to other sex enemies and that child pornography is fuel to feed the obsession of paedophilia;22 others conclude that it is a safety valve that prevents such crimes. 23<BR>
<BR>
Law enforcement agencies also have differing opinions. In 1995, several Australian law enforcement agencies testified in hearings on organised paedophile activity that 'there was a significant likelihood that a person in possession of child pornography was also involved in sexually abusing children.&quot;24 This view is not universally accepted, even in Australia.25 It is well documented that paedophiles may possess extensive collections of child pornography. However, not all paedophiles who collect or view pornography sexually molest children and not all of those who collect child pornography can be characterised as paedophiles.	<BR>

<BR>
What is clear, however, is that law enforcement agents have found that a significant number of arrested child molesters are in possession of child pornography. One detective in the Los Angeles Police Department estimated that of 700 child molesters arrested over 10 years for extra fundimental child sex crimes, more than half had child pornography in their possession and about 80% owned either child or adult pornography. From 1986 to 1988, an organisation called Childwatch in England found that of the 27 child molesters convicted, <I>23% </I>were using their child victims to make pornography and nearly all of the child molesters had child pornography in their possession.<BR>
<BR>
When discussing the relevance of child pornography to the sexual abuse of children, most experts note that it is important not to confuse the question of statistical line (i.e., whether some or many child sex offenders possess child pornography) with the separate issue of causality (i.e., whether possession of child pornography causes people to commit child-sex offences). While taking pains to acknowledge that there was no evidence of causality, however, a U.S. Senate Subcommittee investigating child pornography came to the conclusion that &quot;[child pornography plays a central role in child molestation's by paedophiles, serving to justice their conduct, assist them in seducing their victims and provide a means to blackmail the children they have molested in order to prevent exposure. <BR>
<BR>
<B>VII. EFFECTS OF PORNOGRAPHY ON CHILDREN</B><B></B><BR>
<BR>
Many have argued that the distribution of obscene adult material is a victimless crime, that <B>110 </B>one gets hurt and that what one does privately is his or her own business. In the case of child pornography. however, where a real child is videotaped or photographed, there is always a victim. The distribution of that depiction repeats the victimisation over and over again, long after the original deed took place. Likewise, when the face of a child is superimposed on a sexually explicit photo. even though that child never participated in any sexual act, the distribution of the altered image arguably produces a similar effect.<BR>
<BR>
There are two ways in which children can potentially be haved by child pornography--by being exposed to child pornography or by being filmed themselves. Children who are exposed to pornography are in danger of being desensitised and seduced into believing that pornographic activity is &quot;normal&quot; for children.27 It can provide a kind of modelling that may adversely affect children's behaviour and result in learning experiences which connect sex to exploitation, force, or violence.2~<BR>

<BR>
The impact on the child victim who is exploited to produce pornography is often senous. Children can experience a myriad of symptoms including physical symptoms and illness, emotional withdrawal, anti-social behaviour, mood-swings, depression, fear and anxiety. In a study of children involved in sex rings,  of whom were sexually abused, 54.8% of the children were used in the creation of pornography. In these children, there was a significant relationship between involvement in pornography and a pattern of identification with the exploiter, along with deviant and symptomatic behaviour. 29<BR>
<BR>
Children who are sexually abused or exploited may be at high risk of becoming perpetrators or abusers themselves.30 Those who have been photographed may take drastic measures, for example, burning the house where the pictures are located or stealing back the record of their exploitation. The media in some countries often confuses victims with perpetrators by publishing pictures of children who have been sexually exploited and blanking out the faces of offenders. Those exploited children who enjoyed the attention or who were sexually stimulated carry special shame about their participation in pornography. It must be emphasised that whether minors acquiesced to sexual exploitation, profited from it, or enjoyed it, they are always the victims of an unlawful and often destructive act.<BR>

<B>viii.	THE REGULATION OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY</B><B></B><BR>
<BR>
The easy availability of child pornography in the 70's led governments to respond by promulgating legislation that prohibited the production, sale and distribution of child<BR>
	pornography.Most notably,the United States, 1977, passed strict laws against child <BR>
pornography with heavy penalties.  In 1980, both Denmark and Sweden put child pornography legislation into effect and the Netherlands followed in  1986.<BR>
<BR>
In 1984, the U.S. Department of State made diplomatic visits to the governments of Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark to enlist the assistance of these governments in eliminating child pornography. In the same year, an NBC documentary, The Silent Shame exposed international trade in pornography and was instrumental in pressuring governments to become stricter in their enforcement. U.S. offficials specifically credits this documentary with causing an immediate drop in foreign shipments during 1984.<BR>

<BR>
Note that there are those who reject the &quot;cycle of abuse&quot; theory because it is<BR>
females who are more frequently sexually abused and yet males are responsible for the majority of child sexual abuse in most societies. See Kelly, ., supra note 16, at 25-26.<BR>
<BR>
Since the mid-80's, according to law enforcement officials in the U.S. and Canada, there has been a noticeable decline in the number of new children depicted in commercially distributed pornography.31  However, commercial material recently seized in the United States contained images of new prepubescent children from Mexico and Brazil.  Some new commercial pornography material also involves underage teens.  A U.S. television programme, Hard Copy, televised a report in February 1996 rnn underage girls from the U.S. and Europe who are being photographed in Holland by a company that produces the erotic Seventeen magazine. The girls, according to a pediatric specialist applying the Tanner scale32 ranged in age from 13 to 18.<BR>
<BR>
Commercial production, while diminished, does however continue to exist and, as stated previously, is on the rise in Japan.  Furthermore, the production of amateur child pornographic home videos is becoming increasingly popular--even in the commercial market. A review of child pornography legislation promulgated by different countries around the globe reveals something of a trend towards an increasing commitment to the protection of children from pornographic exploitation.<BR>
<BR>
<B>I.	Laws Regulating the Production, Distribution and Possession of Child Pornography</B><B></B><BR>
<BR>
The UNCRC provides a baseline international legal standard for the protection of children from sexual exploitation. Article 34, among other articles which prohibit the degrading treatment of children, explicitly requires countries to take &quot;all appropriate national, bilateral. and multilateral measures to prevent ... the inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful sexual activity ... [and the exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials.&quot;  The United Nations Commission on Human Rights' Plan of Action for the Prevention of the Sale of Children. Child Prostitution and Child Pornography reinforces the UCRC and international efforts to sanction those who exploit children for pornographic purposes.<BR>
<BR>
31	Much of the currently circulating material contains images reproduced from<BR>
publications published in the 70's and early 80's. U.K. law enforcement officials point out, however, that the mid-80's also marked the advent of the camcorder and a proportionate increase in the production of non-commercial amateur pornographic home videos involving new children.<BR>

<BR>
Article <I>175 </I><B>of </B>the Japanese Penal Code forbids the printed <B>portrayal of adult genitals, </B>intercourse and pubic hair. However, such representation of children's genitalia is not stringently regulated. Furthermore, Japanese commercial producers have created ingenious ways to avoid prosecution or law enforcement intervention by creating sexually explicit materials which just barely avoid depiction of forbidden body parts.33<BR>
<BR>
Several other Asian nations have recently adopted child pornography laws. In 1995, Taiwan passed a law criminalising the production of paintings, video tapes, photographs, CDROMs, &quot;electronic signals&quot; and other products depicting indecent conduct or sexual interaction involving persons under 18 years of age. The 1993 child protection law passed in the Philippines (Republic Act No. 7610) includes a provision which prohibits the employment or coercion of children under 18 years of age to perform in obscene exhibitions or indecent shows, whether live or video, or to model in obscene publication or pornographic materials.  It also imposes sanctions on the sale or distribution of such materials.<BR>
<BR>
Sri Lanka (Penal Code Sec. 286A) passed similar legislation in 1995 which protects children up to 18 years of age. In Cambodia, a draft proposal (Law on the Abolition of Child Trafficking and Prostitution, Art. 9 A i, ii, iii) for a law against child exploitation includes a provision which prohibits the production, possession, importation, exportation or advertisement of drags, paintings, writings, photographs, or films which depict persons under 1 8 years of age in an indecent, obscene, or derogatory manner. The draft law also contain a confiscatory provision (Art. 9B).<BR>
<BR>
In Australia, all States and Territories except New South Wales, have promulgated legislation which makes the mere possession of child pornography illegal. Legislation already existed which makes possession for the purposes of distribution, sale, or exhibition against the law. In 1995, the Australian Customs Service initiated a national intelligence project named Amigo enlisting the public in efforts to establish the nature and content of child pornography being trafficked in and out of Australia.34<BR>
<BR>
1.2.	Europe<BR>
Legal measures designed to deal with pornography vary considerably among European countries with no common approach to production, distribution, or possession of pornographic material. In England and Wales, the law makes it a criminal offence to take,<BR>
distribute, exhibit or possess even one &quot;indecent&quot; photograph of a child (Protection of Children Act 1978). The law defines a child as a person under 16. The determination of &quot;indecency&quot; is a matter for the court. In the Netherlands, the manufacture, dissemination, transport and export of pornography involving children under 16 is illegal (Criminal Code, Art. 240b, Sec. 1). In April 1995, the Code was amended to include stiffer sentences and to include sanctions for the mere possession of child pornography. Norway's penal code was amended in 1992. The section on child pornography applies directly to the introduction and possession of child pornography but not to the production of such. 35<BR>

<BR>
Section 207a of the Austrian Penal Code, passed in July 1994, imposes criminal sanctions for both commercial and amateur production and distribution of child pornography as well as for possession and/or acquisition of the same. Germany also recently made possession of child pornography an offence under the German Penal Code. France's Penal Code (Penal Code Art. 227-23) forbids fixing, recording, or transmitting the pornographic image of a minor and the distribution of that image. None of the Eastern European countries, with the exception of Estonia (Penal Code Art. 200/3), however, have laws specifically directed at child pornography.<BR>
<BR>
Many European countries have very rigid mail secrecy laws and mail can be interfered with only milder extraordinary circumstances. Additionally, European postal authorities do not possess the police powers of U.S. postal inspectors.  Some countries have very strict penalties against sexual intercourse with a child, but very light sentences or fines for child pornography. Further more, &quot;sting&quot; operations which are routine in the United States are not practised in Europe.<BR>
<BR>
<B>1.3.	North America</B><BR>
<BR>
The U.S. is widely considered to be a major consumer of child pornography but it has also been among the most aggressive in dealing with perpetrators through the passage and enforcement off strict child pornography laws. these laws (18 U.S.C. 2251, 225 IA. 2252. 2256) currently prohibit the production. receipt distribution, possession, transportation, mailing and advertising ofany &quot;visual depiction&quot; involving the use of a child under 18 years of age in sexually explicit conduct. Sexually explicit conduct includes sexual acts as well as the &quot;lascivious exhibition off the genital or pubic area of any person.&quot; A more recent law (18 U.S.C. 2~58) makes it a felony for any person outside U.S. territory to produce or traffic in child pornography with the intent that the materials be imported into the United states--all extraterritorial application of U.S. law to non-U. S. citizens.<BR>

pornography, Norwegian prosecutors resort to other sections of the penal code relating to inducing minors to sexual behaviour and contributing to acts of indecency. Id.<BR>
<BR>
Canada has a very comprehensive child pornography law. Section 163 of the Penal Code makes it a crime to import, produce, paint, or publish any child pornography which includes representations of children under 18 who are engaged in or who are depicted as engaged in explicit sexual activity. Furthermore, mere possession of child pornography is also now prohibited in Canada.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2.	Regulation of Computer Pornography</B><B></B><BR>
<BR>
Since the advent of computer manipulated child pornography, several countries have passed legislation supporting an expanded definition of child pornography which includes &quot;simulated&quot; child pornography (where the person depicted is considered an adult by law but is obviously portraying a child) or &quot;pseudo&quot; child pornography which can be computer manipulated or computer generated pornography. In the United Kingdom the law' explicitly prohibits &quot;pseudo-photographs&quot; which definition includes &quot;data stored on a computer disc or by other electronic means which is capable of conversion into a photograph&quot;. (Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 Sec. 7(8)(9)). In Austria, the law prohibits not only real child pornography, but also material that suggests to an objective spectator that its production involved the sexual abuse of a child/minor. Similar statutes in the Netherlands (Penal Code Sec. 240b) and in Canada (Penal Code Sec. 163) could be applied to computer generated pornography.  In the United States, however, the current federal child pornography statutes and most state statutes apply only to depiction's of actual children and not &quot;pseudo&quot; or computer generated pornography.36  However, such &quot;pseudo&quot; child pornography may be prosecuted pursuant to federal obscenity statutes. INTERPOL. in their October 1996 General Assembly, plans to adopt a resolution that will recommend all countries enact legislation that criminalises child pornography and that such legislation should include &quot;future forms of support such as computers and other virtual representations.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Other countries have taken steps to regulate the transmission of sexually explicit material on the Internet. Recently, a Munich prosecutor in Germany demanded that CompuServe block access to sexually explicit news groups on the Internet from its on-line service. The government of Singapore has taken dramatic steps to regulate the Internet by demanding that all Internet servers be licensed by the government Singapore Broadcasting Authority. 37 This allows them to regulate not only pornography but all politically sensitive material. Chinese officials have warned against Internet pornography and have recently visited<BR>
Singapore to study their system of regulation.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>36	</B>The state of Virginia, however, has passed a statute which criminalises<BR>
 simulated child pornography in which &quot;a person who is depicted as or presents the appearance of being less than eighteen years of age in sexually explicit visual material is prima facie presumed to be less than eighteen years of age.&quot; (Code of Virginia 18.2-374.1). The same statute includes computer generated reproductions.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
In the United States, the Telecommunications Act of 1996, signed into law in February 1 996, makes it a felony to knowingly transmit &quot;obscene or indecent material&quot; over the Internet or on-line computer services if the material may be seen by children under 1 8. Immediately after the signing, civil liberty and free speech groups successfully sought a temporary restraining order to block its enforcement.  In Australia, three States have introduced bills to censor material on the Internet.  Because of the proliferation of inconsistent State and Territory laws, the Standing Committee of Attorneys General has agreed on the preparation of a draft bill suitable for a national scheme. The passage of such legislation in many countries is controversial because it directly challenges the right to freedom of expression which is highly valued, particularly by the computer on-line community.<BR>
<BR>
<B>3.	Legal Issues Raised by the Regulation of Computer Child Pornography</B><BR>
<BR>
Awith with all the truly remarkable--even lifesaving--tasks which computers perform the development of computers and the advent of on-line communication has introduced senous challenges into every area of the law. Many questions have yet to be answered. For example. in each nation across the globe who is legally liable for material placed on a bulletin board system an on-line service or on the Internet? The individual who introduces the material <B>into </B>the system the systems operator, the producer of the material, and/or the<BR>
person who downloads it? There are further questions.  In the case of pornography transmitted by computer, the origination of the image may be in a jurisdiction in one part of tile world where the image is legal but it may travel to another where the image is patently illegal.  Should the global network be dominated by the strictest standard or the most tolerant? Furthermore. should not con senting adults be able to engage 'ii e-mail interactive chat sessions which describe &quot;objectionable&quot; materials since these same communications must not be criminalised it they were face to face, by regular post, or by telephone?<BR>
<BR>
The possibility of creating computer generated pornography has produced a myriad of additional legal issues that are difficult to resolve Civil libertarians argue that if computer gene crated pornography involves no real child victim. laws based on protecting children would 110 longer apply and regulation would be an unwarranted restriction of free speech they argue that because there is no absolute scientific data that demonstrates a causal connection between the use of child pornography and the commission of crimes against children, there is <B>110 </B>reason to restrict its trail emission on the Internet. They might also point <B>Out </B>the difficulty of determining the &quot;age&quot; of a &quot;child&quot; depicted in a computer generated image.<BR>
<BR>
Child advocates voice the position that the harm of child pornography extends far beyond the individual victim. They assert that children as a whole are the victims of computer gene crated pornography which displays child victims as sexual objects.  Many law <BR>
enforcement officers argue that the harm reaches beyond the individual child when pornography is used to seduce other children.  They add that neglecting to prohibit computer generated child pornography could well re-establish the commercial trade--filling bookstores with computer generated images, de-sensitising society and fuelling demand for such material. Additionally, if it becomes impossible to distinguish computer generated pornography from that which depicts an actual child, prosecution of &quot; genuine&quot; child pornography would become virtually impossible and child pornographers would be furnished with another avenue of defense.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ix.	CONCLUSION</B><BR>
<BR>
Child pornography is a real and pressing problem that exists on local, national and international levels. Directing educational campaigns and training towards parents, teaches, students, legislators, civil servants child welfare agencies, the private sector and law enforcement personnel on a national level is an important step towards the solution. These local efforts must be supported by global co-operation of an enormous magnitude.<BR>
<BR>
International exchange of information and training is vital. The INTERPOL Standing Working Party on Offences Against Minors, initiated in I 992, is a good example of the kind of collaboration which is necessary. Currently, the Standing Working Party iii includes law enforcement officials from 29 different countries who are actively collaborating ill their efforts to prevent the sexual exploitation of children. &quot;Operation Starburst,&quot; the first major international operation against individuals using the Internet to trade child pornography is a further illustration of international cooperation. In 1905, this worldwide police operation resulted in the arrest of 15 offenders in Britain and a number of others in Hong Kong, Germany, South Africa, Singapore, Canada and the United States.3~<BR>
<BR>
Many members of the international community have not yet adopted legislation which is directed specifically at child pornography despite a global trend towards regulation. All nations and international bodies, including funding agencies, must use their influence to encourage the promulgation of legislation that prohibits the production. exhibition. distribution and possession of child pornography. in the 1980's, tough enforcement of child pornography laws in the United States and Northern Europe led to a conspicuous drop in the international distribution of child pornography.  Further progress can be made worldwide.<BR>
<BR>
When crafting national or local legislation, a delicate balance needs to be reached between a legitimate concern for the protection of freedom of expression and the equally legitimate and pressing concern for the protection of society's children   Regulation of child pornography should not be used as an excuse to regulate free speech or information flow but rather regulation must be targeted at preventing the sexual exploit ation of children who are among the most vulnerable members of society. Lawmakers should be careful to draft and adopt laws which attract the broadest possible popular backing so that law enforcement agents will be supported in their efforts to enforce the law.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Internet Is Spreading Child Porn, Glasgow Herald Nov. 21, 1995 at 7.</B><BR>
<BR>
Regulation of child pornography in the computer age presents special challenges that require considerable technical expertise.  Law enforcement officials around the world require technical training. Governments must be willing to allocate fluids for such training and the necessary equipment. The establishment of an international resource organisation which would employ a team of specialists in the areas of investigation, law enforcement behavioural science, prosecution, law and computer technology could be an invaluable resource for the global community.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, tile protection of children must become a global priority and national must commit their resources accordingly. This protection includes a fine commitment to the detection and prevention of sex crimes against children and to the treatment of children who have been sexually exploited. The World Congress has been called in order to promote such a goal and should provide a forum where countries affix the nr's for protection of children set forth in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.<BR>

<H2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<BR>
</H2>
<FONT SIZE="4">This paper is the product of a consultative process that is ongoing. It is based directly on the information contained in 20 case studies, prepared by non-government organisations, who are currently implementing programmes aimed at preventing the abuse of children through sexual exploitation, or assisting those who have suffered such abuse.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">They have identified national and local macro-level factors that render children vulnerable to exploitation. In addition, they have provided details of individual and family circumstances, which in combination, appear to heighten vulnerability. Poverty, relative and absolute, is a key factor in many situations, but it appears that it is its coincidence with other risk elements that creates a situation in which the sexual exploitation of children is most likely. These additional components include changing value systems, the commodification of individuals within societies, the existence of an underclass, because of ethnic differences or wide disparities in economic status, family breakdown, and a societal ambivalence and contradiction in relation to the phenomenon of sexual exploitation.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">This creates an environment. despite the widespread commitment, in principle, to child welfare and protection epitomised, for example, by countries signing the Convention on the Rights of the Child, whereby sexually exploited children frequently fall outside the welfare net. They may be punished, rejected and reviled, denied their rights as children, and denied an environment that offers an opportunity to develop and mature. For some, the consequences are life threatening--as a result of sexually transmitted disease. violence. used to secure compliance, or precocious pregnancies. For others, the experience of exploitation leaves physical, emotional and psychological scars that demand d'ttention.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">The case studies give practical insights into the strategies that have been adopted by the non-government organisations, aimed at protecting the child from all forms of sexual abuse and exploitation (Article 34, CRC), and/or the<B> TMappropriate measures to promote physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration' (Article 39, CRC). Many have stressed the paramount importance of creating a climate that is child-centred, that recognises and supports the rights and special position of all children, that understands the extent and nature of the abuse and its impact on the children. This appears crucial in terms of developing a political/legislative framework in which there is support for the </B>projects, that promotes protection, that recognises commercial sexual exploitation of children as an abuse and encourages partnerships so that the child's needs are addressed holistically. This strategy would promote the reintegration of the children into their families and communities and enable the children themselves to start the process of regaining their dignity and sense of worth. This is the key element in affecting psycho-social recovery.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">The specific approaches will vary as they take into account the particular social and cultural context, but all stress that services and activities must have regard for the child's innate worth, their right to be treated with dignity, and to have their voice heard. It is apparent from the case studies that all concerned, politicians, decision makers, planners, and those working with young people, need to learn from the experience and reality of the children themselves. That is essentially the rationale for this paper. Knowing what has happened to them, understanding their responses to the abuse, and the services and programmes which they experience as effective, can inform us all whether we are advocates, legislators, teachers, community activists or therapists.</FONT><BR>
<BR>

<H2>I.	BACKGROUND</H2>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">This report has been prepared at the request of the NGO Group on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to be one part of their overall contribution to the World Congress against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children. It was envisaged as a paper that would bring together, and amplify the field experiences of a number of different organisations that were responding to the issue of the abuse of children through commercial exploitation, by establishing community based initiatives for prevention and/or rehabilitation. These case studies were to be based on a core of central information, the format for which was devised in consultation with practitioners. This was supplemented with any additional experiences, perceptions and analyses offered by the report writers, validated by their colleagues and the programme beneficiaries, that would clarify and help bring each unique situation to life. Through reviewing these experiences, it was hoped that a broader analysis of the problem and intervention strategies would be developed. As this would be informed by the reality of the children's experiences and needs and remain firmly grounded in practice, it was anticipated that such an empirical approach would be of direct relevance to those establishing policies and procedures. as well as of immediate interest to other practitioners. seeking to establish or revise programmes aimed at changing for the better the lives of the children, their families and communities, that are touched by this issue.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">The starting point for all those working with children involved in, or at risk of becoming involved in commercial sex. has been that this is a fundamental violation of the rights of children. This basic premise is enshrined within the Convention on the Rights of the Child. which defines a child as '~every human being below the age of 1 8 years unless. under the law applicable to the child. majority is attained earlier&quot; - Article I. Article 34 requires signatories to protect the child from all forms of sexual abuse and exploitation. and under Article 39,  to take all appropriate measures to promote physical. and psychological recovery and social re-integration of a child victim .. in an environment which fosters the health, self-respect and sanity of the child.&quot; This makes explicit that concerns for children extend beyond their physical and practical needs. It recognises that there will almost always be psychological, social and emotional consequences for children subjected to abuse, neglect. and trauma. Appropriate rehabilitative and/or compensatory measures to restore these children will vary. but will need to take cognisance, explicitly or implicitly. of the reality of the children's current situation. their external environment and their inner state. and the content and sequence of programmes or inputs that will assist them to regain a sense of psychological wellbeing and an ability to interact and function within their social milieu.</FONT><BR>
<BR>

<H2>II.	SELECTION OF PROJECTS</H2>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">From the outset, the aim was to gather field information from many of the nongovernment organisations developing services and programmes to prevent and protect children from sexual exploitation, and/or to offer services to those who have already experienced abuse. This process involved the selection of twenty projects to write detailed case studies, providing specific information about the children and the communities in which they operated, their experiences, and the programmatic responses. Approximately 60 organisations, accessed through the network of contacts of interested organisations that were already known to the international organisations which formed part of the NGO Group, provided information about their situations, from which the twenty chosen. This account is, thus, based on the combined experiences that have been presented to us, representing programmes in all continents, across a wide range of social conditions and cultural norms, and responding to this dire concern with a range of intervention strategies.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">The selection of the 20 organisations requested to prepare case studies was based on the need for geographic spread, the desire to include a range of different approaches and foci, the wish to provide smaller or lesser known organisations with the opportunity to present their work to an international audience and ultimately, on the organisation's ability and willingness to devote sufficient resources to the preparation of a lengthy and detailed report within the necessary time frame. The resulting case studies provide an rnsight into what can be done in certain circumstances, the mistakes made, and lessons learnt along the way, by practitioners willing to share their experiences. They have provided a base from which some trends and directions can be identified, but in the full knowledge that these are not a complete picture of what is, or what ought to be happening in this field. They are based on work with children, aged from 8 years, (though the majority of programmes work with 12-17t year olds), with both sexes. though the vast majority concentrate on working with females. over periods ranging from one year (APAP-Ethiopia), to 23 years (UNDUGU-Kenya). Some organisations have operated a pilot model, working with only a small fraction of the exploited children, (30 girls are currently engaged with the Slum Aid project, Uganda), while others offer programmes that have provided services to several hundreds or thousands of young people (Casa de Passagem, Brasi], UNDUGU, Kenya).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">With the assistance of the practitioners themselves, a forinat for the case study that would provide a minimum of comparable data and experiences was developed. The aim of the instrument was to assist the agencies in identifying broad areas for inclusion while allowing sufficient flexibility to ensure that the unique or key features of a situation, or comm~ity, or programme response could be included. Details of the philosophy and orientation underpi~ing the work as well as information on the development of the programmes and practical steps taken to achieve objectives were included, alongside some assessment of impact and effectiveness. All were requested to consult and validate the contents of the reports with the children and young people themselves. The case studies themselves will be incorporated into the final report.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">This paper includes information from all of the projects that have written, or are preparing a case study, but the process of information gathering in many instances is<B> still incomplete. Clanfication of ambiguity, additional detail, and more analysis of impact are still being discussed. There are still gaps that hinder a fuller understanding of all aspects of the projects. The final report is intended to be very much based on practice, and the</B> temptation to make assumptions, pre-empt the field responses, or reach conclusions and develop generalisations from insufficient data has been avoided. This process will have been completed prior to the preparation of that report, by August 1996.</FONT><BR>
<BR>

<H2>III.	TERMINOLOGY</H2>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">The aim of this study is to add to the information available, building on real situations and experiences. to provide greater understanding of the issue, and some insights into possible intervention strategies, that can be used and refined in other contexts. One of the problems that has hampered efforts to establish a broader knowledge base, which could inform and direct local, national and international policies and efforts, is the inconsistent use of phrases and terms. The discrepancies in the language used to describe and define the concerns create a lack of clarity about what individual programmes. policies, and objectives are actually addressing in reality. There are differences in the use of the terms child', ~young person', ~prostitute', ~prostituted', or ~sexually abused', victim', 'survivor', ~perpetrator', 'abuser', etc. While in some instances the differences are accurate and  relevant, in other cases, the language used may be considered inappropriate by others working in the field. It may be seen as conveying certain negative values and perceptions. and demeaning. The linking of the abuse of children through commercial exploitation, with incest, and other forms of sexual abuse, may be confusing when seeking to identify commonalities of approach and gather evidence about the scale of each concern.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">&quot;The term prostitution is still widely used (but) there is growing concern that this obscures the nature of sexually abusive behaviour, unhelpfully focuses on a concept of 'informed consent' and frames children as offenders rather than as victims.&quot; (Barnardos.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2>lV. INCIDENCE</H2>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">The<B> universal comment from all respondents has been that there are no accurate statistics of the incidence of children who are currently being abused through sexual exploitation. Part of this problem clearly relates to the preceding paragraph. How can there be consensus in te~s of the scale of the issue while there is a lack of clarity in defining exactly what it is that the various groups involved are referring to when they speak of the sexual abuse of children?</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Projects have been established in response to a perceived problem, but all of those working in the field have indicated that they are aware of just some of the victims. At times the problem has been clearly identified by community concerns, by individual referrals, or through associated issues, as in Uganda, where the problem became apparent in response to work being conducted on AIDS/HIV awareness.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">There is a clear view that the numbers of children involved in the sex trade is increasing. Estimates, or guestimates often include huge variations, but, even with the most conservative figures, the numbers represent hundreds of thousands of children whose lives and future prospects are being devastated by this dreadful phenomenon. NGOs, various writers and commentators have suggested the following:</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Thailand, (1996) 200,000 children involved </FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Taiwan, (1987-95) 1978 children sold</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Nepal, 100,000 - 200,00 girls trafficked</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Philippines, (1995) 60,000 children involved in prostitution</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Brasil, (1992) 500,00 children in prostitution</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Chille, 50,000 working in commercial sex</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">U.K., (1989-93)1,800 cautions and 1500 convictions for offences related to prostitution amongst under 1 8 year olds.</FONT>
<H2><BR>
V.	INITIAL FINDINGS FROM THE CASE STUDIES</H2>
<FONT SIZE="4">The respondents have given broad outlines of the factors which create a climate, locally and nationally, which allows or condones the sexual exploitation of children, alongside more specific information about the particular characteristics of the abused children and their families. There are both differences and similarities illustrated in the case studies received to date, which will be assessed in greater detail in the later report. The following information gives the range of situations identified, the prevalent issues in different locations and some of the challenges faced.</FONT><BR>

<H3>1.	Visibility Factor</H3>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Who are the children that are victimised and abused through commercial sexual exploitation? What are the factors that indicate a high level of vulnerability and how is this related to the individual and family dynamics that combine to deny the children involved their rights? What societal factors, political characteristics and cultural ethos, combine to produce a situation m which the sexual abuse of children through exploitation occurs, is condoned and accepted?</FONT><BR>

<H3>1.1.	Macro-Level</H3>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">In providing details of the demographic, social, economic. ethnic and cultural mix of the national and local contexts of the projects, certain macro scale features have been identified as risk or vuherability factors, that contribute to a likelihood of commercial sexual exploitation of children. These are critical factors in any subsequent or existing programmes that try to work to change opportunities and attitudes, whether of the broader community, families, or the child concerned. They include:</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Poverty, both absolute and relative. The large numbers of a population that are chronically disadvantaged economically, and for whom there is little access to opportunities for an alternative source of income, create a group for whom mere survival can precipitate their involvement in the sex trade. This may be self propelled. In many cases though it involves children being sold into brothels, by family, neighbours etc. This may be to repay debts or provide absolute essentials (India, Nepal), but it has also been seen as a means of providing relatively luxury items (Thailand).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Poverty creates a situation where many children will not be in education, and/or where many will be involved in the labour market. Both factors would appear to independently indicate an increased vulnerability.  Many of the situations of children in the labour market, including domestic service, or living and working on the streets, deny them the protection of a family or of concerned and responsible adults. Some may be vulnerable to exploitation by other street dwellers, where sexual favours or services are demanded in return for a degree of protection from  other gangs.</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Consumerism/Materialism.. The commodification of individuals, alongside the perceived attractions of the material rewards of life (Thailand), has contributed to a change in what might be considered appropriate levels of respect and concern within families, neighbourhoods. etc.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">As for our culture, we are a community which is losing its roots, today consumerism, individualism, and competition predominate...&quot; (G.A.N.. Chile)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">'This change in values and attitudes allows a situation to develop, in which a parent might consider selling a daughter to a brothel, or intermediary. to provide them with certain consumer goods.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">&quot;..The greatest disaster and betrayal fell, my grandmother sold me. She sold me into the brothel for life for NTS8OO,000. At that time I was eleven years old, there were many things I did not know, and when they asked me to sign my name, I did so This was my signature to a contract that sold me for life to the brothel owner. (Taiwan ).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Poorly educated, marginalised sectors of society, which provide a steady source of children who can be coerced, forced and / or tricked, into the sex trade (Brasil, India, Thailand):</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">&quot;Extremely poor sectors of the population carry on searching outside the system for ways to survive and constitute a subculture of poverty which reproduces and sustains itself.&quot; (G.A.N.. Chile)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">This may combine with the existence of other ethnic groups or different nationalities, whose access to resources is limited, and whose esteem, or standing within the country makes them particularly vulnerable. (Nepal, Taiwan, India, Brasil, Venezuela) For this group, the protection measures or general respect that might be given to women and children based on a broad national consciousness or principles, is deemed irrelevant or unnecessary.</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">A low regard for females, and the view that they are and can be treated as a form of property: They are denied a voice and equality in terms of protest or protection. (Nepal, Thailand, Brasil, Chile) In Nepal, the combination of their status and the demand from the commercial sex trade in neighbouring countries, has resulted in widespread trafficking of women and girls who are sold into brothels. Seventy percent of girls interviewed in brothels in a Thai study had been sold once, with 25 percent sold for a second time and five percent for a third time. They subsequently suffer all of the consequences of this abuse and reap none, or few, of the financial benefits for the services they are compelled to render.</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Weak, confusing. contradictory legislative frameworks that may contain provision for the protection of children, but where the sexually exploited child may be viewed as a criminal rather than a victim, or somehow treated as outside the category of children for whom protection is warranted (U.K., Ethiopia). An instance is the difficulties of prosecuting pimps and organisers in Chile where the offence would be one of corruption of morals. to which the fact that a child has been labelled a prostitute already would be considered a defence.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">&quot;You cannot corrupt that which is already corrupted&quot;.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Government corruption: This may aggravate a confusing legislative framework. where those charged with enforcing certain protection measures, in fact benefit from the continued exploitation, economically or through demanding sexual services.	Weak political will which effectively colludes with the exploiters: Here the incidence of prostituted children may be regarded as an economic benefit which directly profits the exploiters. who are supporters of and in turn supported by the political decision makers. It may be viewed as a phenomenon that attracts foreign revenue through sex tourism and thus as an asset rather than a fundamental violation of children's rights.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Cultural beliefs:</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"> In societies which combine some of the above factors with a belief in the</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"> restorative/healing powers of sex with a virgin. there will be a demand for</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"> younger children. Certain religious practices, e.g.the Devadasi system although</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"> illegal in India. continues in certain places and involves or condones sexual</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"> exploitation.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">The demand for sexual services:</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"> This may be created by large populations of unattached men, e.g.  in military</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">installations or construction operations (Philippines, Brasil) which attracts both</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">vulnerable individuals for whom such opportunity may mean survival and those</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">seeking to act as intermediaries for profit. The lack of regard for these women</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">and young people is perhaps exacerbated by the lack of taboos regarding the</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">treatment of women, boys and girls of a different nationality, etiinic origin, etc.</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">While some know something of the reality of these situations, many others are</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">coerced or tricked into involvement. The methods employed to induce children</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">into the sex trade range from rape to threats of violence, to imprisonment and</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">maintaining children in conditions of slavery (Philippines, Thailand). For others it</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">is compliance with parental demands.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">The AIDS pandemic has created a demand for youriger children for sexual</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">services, in the belief that they are less likely to carry the HIV virus.</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"> (Uganda. Thailand)</FONT><BR>

<H3>1.2.	<B>Individual </B><I>I </I><B>FamiIy Risk Factor</B></H3>
<FONT SIZE="4">Within these broad categories there are children who are exploited and others that somehow avoid it. Which factors protect and which heighten the risks of children becoming victims of this form of abuse?	Family breakdown: This category would include remarriage and poor relationships between children and step-families (Chile, Ethiopia). children going missing from home (U.K.), children being alienated from carers (U.K) or being cared for by someone other than a parent (Uganda), and at an early age abandoning their home and family and trying to survive on the streets through whatever means are possible and available.	Parenting patterns may be inconsistent. In some families parents have been described as suffering from physical or mental illness, drug abuse and alcoholism. They may be living in desperately difficult and stressful circumstances, homeless. unemployed, mobile. unstable, the combination of which may severely limit their ability to care for and protect their children.	Abuse at home: Children may have to leave the family home as a result of physical or sexual abuse from a family member.</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">The girl belonging to households in financial and social crisis, through poverty and social and cultural marginalisation. is exposed to high doses of intrafamiliar violence.&quot; (G.A.N., Chile)</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">The lack of protection, sometimes coupled with a loss of self respect. a feeling of being damaged goods'. makes the child an easy victim for others to exploit.</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">These youths must cope in isolation having to deal with the emotional trauma of abuse, rejection and neglect which may have led them to leave home.&quot; (Youth Link, Canada)	Out of school: Children that are not in education, for whatever reason, are vulnerable. Whether this means that they are working, or simply operating outside of the school system, they are more exposed to risks of abuse. In many situations female children are especially disadvantaged often from a very young age in terms of access to education. For many, employment as domestic servants is one of the very few opportunities for work.</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">As soon as a girl is 6 years old she starts to accompany her mother .... and at the age of 8 she is old enough to work independently&quot; (India, Domestic Workers Movement).</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">In India, seventeen percent of all domestic workers are below fourteen years of age. This group of children are living with and totally dependent on their employers, for whom their employees'rights as children may never be consciously considered. In these circumstances, they are extremely vulnerable to being sexually abused and exploited. They frequently cannot complain or seek protection and frequently accept their fate, until perhaps they become pregnant or are thrown out of the house as corrupters of their employers. or their sons. At this point, a combination of a lack of alternatives and low self image can render them highly susceptible to further abuse within the brothels and prostitution networks.	Right age group and sex: Although there are instances of very young children being abused through commercial sex, with one case study referring to children aged 8 on average, when they were first sexually abused (Chile), the majority of children involved with the case study projects are aged 12-1 7. The majority of the programmes work with girls but there are other situations in which boys are targeted or at risk of becoming involved in commercial sex.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Another family member involved: Whether through active  recruitment,through </FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">increased awareness of the possibility or decreased resistance to it, where an</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">older sibling is already involved in the sex trade, other children are more at risk</FONT> <FONT SIZE="4">of becoming involved (Thailand). This is not always the case. There are reports</FONT> <FONT SIZE="4">of sisters and mothers continuing to be involved in or returning to prostitution,</FONT><FONT SIZE="4">with the explicit aim of protecting other family members by providing materially,</FONT><FONT SIZE="4">and thus reducing the economic pressures on the family.</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Drug use: Some young people are induced into the sex trade as a means of</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">financing their drug habit. Others use drugs subsequently, to deaden their</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">awareness of the abuse to which they are subjected, and thus are hooked into the</FONT> <FONT SIZE="4">vicious cycle of dependence.</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Many of the children that are abused through sexual exploitation are multiply</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">disadvantaged or imperilled. The complexity of factors that impinge on an</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">individual and their family, which combine to push, pull, force or maintain a child</FONT> <FONT SIZE="4">in a situation of being abused through sexual exploitation, or which somehow,</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">conversely, protect them from the risks, need to be drawn out of the reports and</FONT> <FONT SIZE="4">assessed in more detail, to look at orders of significance, most dangerous</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">combinations, etc. The abused child may be a child of war, a street child, or a</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">disabled child in addition to being sexuaUy exploited.</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"> Most of these girls were from broken homes,... ran away from the wrath of step</FONT> <FONT SIZE="4">mothers, from wars ... and had suffered ... rape, child abuse, etc&quot; (Slum Aid,</FONT><FONT SIZE="4">Uganda).</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">The data needs to be compared with other research which has identified factors</FONT> <FONT SIZE="4">which engender resilience in a child, which might help protect the child either</FONT> <FONT SIZE="4">from involvement initially, or from some of the most personally damaging</FONT> <FONT SIZE="4">impacts of involvement, or which maximise prospects for ending the involvement</FONT> <FONT SIZE="4">and successfully re-establishing within their families or community.</FONT><BR>

<H3>2.	Consequences of Abuse</H3>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">The basic premise that children have a fundamental right to their personal integritv and to freedom from exploitation and abuse, follows from an absolute acceptance that such violations of these rights damage and hurt the children concerned.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">All the agencies involved in the case studies referred to the distressing consequences for children of being abused in this way. These included physical problems, developmental problems, social problems, and profound psychological and emotional problems. The children concerned have been described in some of the case studies, as suffering from a range of illnesses, including T.B.. respiratory problems, headaches, exhaustion, from sexually transmitted diseases, from injuries resulting from violence, inflicted either by those involved in controlling and organising the sexual transactions, or from the immediate abusers. or resulting from self-harm. They may be malnourished, or debilitated because of the inevitable hazards of a poor living environment, of poverty, or from self-neglect. They may use drugs and alcohol. They have frequently been denied an opportunity for entering or continuing in mainstream education and have low (icademic attainment, coupled with its consequences in terms of future prospects and access to alternate opportunities for income generation.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">The psychological and emotional consequences identified include low self esteem, lack of confidence, self hate, feeling an outcast, unworthy, unloved, unlovable and feeling degraded.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE="4"><B>&quot;Prostitution is written on my face.&quot; (Taiwan)</B></FONT></CENTER><B><BR>
</B><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="4">&quot;Prostitution is nothing because I am nothing.&quot;(Taiwan)</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="4"></FONT></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">They may lose trust in others and yet through an immense need for nurture, affection and support, enter into a series of other relationships that are abusive and exploitative. They may feel helpless and hopeless, accepting their fate as inevitable, with resignation and apathy, and have little regard to a future in which they see simply more of the same. Some may use drugs to lessen the pain and blur the perception of reality.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">'Our prostitutes need a hard hitting drug that can either block IT all out or that can remove IT totally. Only intravenous opiate abuse and crack cocame seem to fill the order ...&quot; (South Africa).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Others have poor concentration, and loss of ability to structure and use time. They feel powerless and unable to affect change. Many have retained or adopted societal views of themselves as immoral and corrupting and, somehow, to blame for their situation. They survive in an atmosphere of violence and intimidation where their very existence can depend on compliance with their continued exploitation and abuse.</FONT><BR>

<H2>VI.	RESPONSES<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">The non-government organisations that have completed their case studies define their programmes as preventative, therapeutic, rehabilitative, catalytic, enabling and facilitating. None operate entirely and exclusively with just one of these outcomes in mind. All recognise the interlinkages and spill-over effects of their work but some see their area of expertise or arena of influence as predominantly in one field or the other.</FONT><BR>

</H2>
<H3>1.	<B>Prevention</B></H3>
<FONT SIZE="4">To most of those involved, prevention refers to a number of approaches. It includes raising awareness of the extent and scale of the problem of this abuse of children, of taking the issue into the public arena, rather than allowing the widespread taboos and restrictions on debate of sexual matters to act as a smokescreen which allows children to remain hidden victims. Ways of impacting on public attitudes have been explored that try to create an attitude that is supportive and nurturing of all children and intolerant of those that sexually abuse and exploit them. It also deals with reducing the numbers of potential victims by disseminating information about the reality of sexual exploitation. sharing techniques and skills for self protection and looking at the provision of alternative opportunities for those most at risk. To be effective it needs to take place within a legislative framework aimed at protecting the children, prosecuting offenders and with the expertise to sensitively and safely handle the disclosure of abuse, and within a context where these measures, both protective and criminal, are widely publicised and acknowledged.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Strategies</FONT><BR>

<H3>1.1.	Awareness Rising</H3>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">As a starting point, information about human rights in general and children's rights in particular, may be a necessary backdrop to more specific programmes aimed at preventing the abuse of children through sexual exploitation.</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Our whole organization is a permanent project whose purpose is to eliminate the violation of the rights of people under the age of 18 in Costa l&quot;ica.&quot; (Fundacion Pani amor)</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Information about the nature of the abuse, its magnitude and its impact on its victims, is disseminated in a number of ways to impact on people at all levels of society. This would include targeting those populations from which children are recruited (Thailand), informing and thus pre-arming the children themselves and their parents (Brasil), influencing the politicians and decision makers generally, changing attitudes within the international audiences involved and concerned as potential tourists, donors, economic partners. etc...</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">&quot;The aims of the project are... .to raise awareness of agencies and decision makers of the issues, and to influence them to provide resources.&quot;(Barnardos.U.K.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">The way that information is presented, the terminology used, the medium chosen, all have an impact on the effectiveness of the message ( Casa De Passagem,Brasi I). These include using publications, television, radio, drama and music. Teaching drama to the</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">exi~loited children. to equip them with the skills to write and present dramatic representations of the dangers and consequences of sexual abuse is one strategy used to maximise both relevance and impact.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">&quot;The drama on child prostitution is prepared in the form  of a forum  theatre with 8 actors. four of whom are themselves children involved in prostitution. It centres around the problem, causes and effects of child prostitution ... It has thus been a focal point for awareness creation workshops.&quot; (A PAP. Ethiopia)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Efforts are made to influence professionals working in the child welfare field, so that thev can act as resources for the children and communities at risk, work sensitively and positively with those already involved, and identify early indications that children are ri danger. or already being abused. Rights campaigns may exist independently from projects aimed specifically at the problem of sexual exploitation. Where they operate. they aim at heightening the recognition of children as a group with particular rights. needs and aspirations, and the broad duty of care and responsibility placed on the adult population, towards them. They may be concerned generally with trying to ensure that the Convention on the Rights of the Child is included explicitly or implicitly in the welfare legislation.They may precede more specific campaigns aimed at children's rights in respect of protection from sexual abuse.</FONT><BR>

<H3>1.2.	Information Gathering</H3>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Understanding the nature and extent of the problem is often a pre-requi site for effective action. Until there is some clarity about the scale of the problem, its particular manifestation and its consequences, presented in a way that has meaning for the proposed consumers of the message, there may be little motivation or political will to address the issue (Philippines). Despite broad statistics being used, while these remain inaccurate guesses, they can be more easily dismissed and ignored.</FONT><BR>

<H3>1.3.	Advocacy</H3>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Lobbying to ensure that those groups that are voiceless or powerless have their rights and concerns raised is important. Taboos and cultural gags that inhibit recognition of the reality of the abuse, create a climate in which there will always be a lack of support, funds and efforts to address the problem. If it can be viewed as an individual aberration, as a reflection of personal difficulties for a few children and their family rather than a problem reflecting a destructive and dysfunctional aspect of many societies. then the responses can be minimised, small in scale and impact and almost hidden. Efforts to change and improve legislation and to ensure that the full authority of existing measures is employed to adequately protect those at risk, etc., are all valid and effective prevention methods (Philippines, Costa Rica). In the Philippines such efforts have succeeded finally in criminalising sexual abuse.</FONT><BR>

<H3>1.4.	<B>Network Building</B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">In several locations, organisations have sought alliances and a network to develop broad-based programmes, operating from a multi-disciplinary perspective. These may have a campaigning arm that makes full use of their joint influence and potential for publicity and media links for getting across the appropriate information about victims and exploiters. In addition, through recognising the complexity of the problem, the range of concerns and difficulties that result from this abuse for the children, their families and perhaps their communities, it combines expertise and skills to address them more effectively. It is also of enormous benefit in dealing with contentious issues, where the strengths of the alliance can respond more effectively to hostility and conflict (U.K., Brasil). For instance, working with the media to present the subtleties of an approach in which policing and welfare agencies co-operate,  can sometimes reduce public hostility which targets the children.</FONT><BR>

</H3>
<H3>1.5.	<B>Rescue Opemdons</B></H3>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">These operations, using lawyers. social workers, health professionals etc. and aimed at helping children escape from abusive situations, have both a preventative and rehabilitative component. As programmes accompanied by a high degree of publicity and popular support, these activities raise the profile of the victims and engender popular sympathy and support for those rescued&quot; and those who continue to suffer abuse.</FONT><BR>

<H3>1.6.	Community Based Initiatives</H3>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">To enhance the resources of the local leaders: These may be aimed at populations from which many of the children involved originate, where using role play, story telling, drama and art community leaders are equipped to take responsibility for informing and training their own communities and enhancing self-protection (Taiwan summer/winter camps. Coletivo Mulher Vida, Brasil).</FONT><BR>

<H3>1.7.	Use<B> of legal Systems to Prosecute and Protec</B>t<BR>
</H3>
<FONT SIZE="4">Understanding the law, in both its roles, the protection of the vulnerable and the imposition of penalties for transgressors, has a dual impact. It increases awareness of the legal sanctions and protective framework, empowering the victims to take action. Such action has a potential deterrent effect, when the sanctions available to punish offenders are severe (Philippines) and restate social disapproval and intolerance of such acts. The project in Ethiopia has adopted a programme of increasing legal literacy through a team of para-lawyers, which includes children who have been sexually exploited.</FONT><BR>

<H3>1.8.	Alternative Income Generation and Informal Education</H3>
<FONT SIZE="4">Both strategies are designed to provide choices for children and their families, where entry into the sex trade may be seen as the only available survival strategy. For children who are excluded from mainstream education, their future prospects and choices are severely limited and this downward spiral of opportunity diminution creates greater risk of being sexually exploited. Alternate education, perhaps with no fees, offered to children who are also working. with a capacity to recognise the needs for those who have missed a great deal of school or who are less academically inclined can maintain a child's hopes and chances for a more positive future.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">'Some girls are not academically inclined but when (they) return to school, the schools emphasize the need to pass examinations so strongly that it serves to make these girls feel more and more inferior&quot; (The Good Shepherd Sisters, Taiwan).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">These primary prevention programmes seek to minimise the risks of children becoming abused through sexual exploitation. in a number of different ways. Some are pilot prjects using experimental techniques for effectively and appropriately spreading the message and for providing children and adults with protection strategies and an awareness of the risks and consequences. In addition to the preventative component. almost all strategies aim at increasing the dignity and respect felt for children by others, and their own feelings of self-worth. This is a key element in programmes seeking to deal with the psycho-social consequences of abuse through sexual exploitation.</FONT><BR>

<H3>2.	<B>Rehabilitation</B></H3>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Rehabilitation refers to the concept of restoration to a former state, in this instance to enabling the child to be free from  the negative physical, psychological and social repercussions of the abuse to which they have been subjected. In fact in many cases it actually refers to an improvement on the pre-existing situation, by trying to increase physical well-being, elevating self-esteem and respect and providing self protection to a level not previously experienced.</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Rehabilitation strategies may be implemented through a range of approaches and in a number of different settings, including residential care, street outreach, psychotherapy, family linking and community work. These are ifi addition to the positive impact for the individuals that occur as a concomitant of the preventative work described above.</FONT><BR>

<H3>2.1.	Settings Residential Care</H3>
<FONT SIZE="4">Many projects recognise that children need shelter and a place of respite from the dangers and pressures to survive that are their daily experience working on the street. Many of the projects provide a space within which the children can feel safe and enjoy food, warmth, nurture and opportunities for self care (Kenya, Brasil). This can incorporate a prevention dimension, a sanctuary for children whose only alternative might be survival through selling sex. The access to health care, and perhaps education. and skills training, that are incorporated into some of these facilities offers both practical help, but importantly, also help to restore to a child the sense of dignity and respect that has been denied. This has more to do with the way in which services are offered and delivered than simply a function of their availability. The residential facility is seen by most as an inadequate response at best, removing children from the community to which they will have to return. Half-way houses, an intenm stage between a residential facility and independence, where the children are equipped with skills and strengths to cope with the pressures of surviving intact, in a harsh environment, are one way of responding (Brasil).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Children may resist the offer of a residential place. associating them with repressive means of dealing with the issue through placing children in institutions, using control and discipline. Children do not want to be coerced into care, their ability to make choices and to use the services m a manner and at a pace with which they can cope, may be critical in making the service truly available.</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">The project is designed to increase acceptability of the service for the girls who are alienated from formal agencies&quot; (Barnardos, U.K.).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><B>Outreach Work</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">This includes both making contact and working with children within their own milieu, including the bars and beer halls, in the slums and red-light areas. In this setting, children are not pressured, but can access information, seek medical and legal advice, discuss alternative support systems and receive some attention and nurture for themselves as children first and foremost (Slum Aid, Uganda). In addition it may also involve contact with the families. At times, this is to confront parents with their responsibilities for their children and to maintain the links so that the children can eventually return (UNDUGU, Kenya).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">This service may be complemented by drop-in centres, located within easy reach of the children, where they can rest, eat, wash themselves and their clothes and enjoy a degree of space, safety and privacy (U.K.). Many of these facilities operate from a multidisciplinary base, with health, education, legal and counselling services available. They may be a centre for distribution of condoms and other contraceptive advice, helping children to avoid sexually transmitted disease or precocious pregnancy. Advocacy and networking with other services in the community are also key elements in enhancing access to appropriate services. For many there is a slow evolution in the type and quality of services requested by the children, which builds on the initial trust and respect established through the provision of practical support, to being able to deal with the pain of their experiences and their revised sense of self (Brasil).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">It has been suggested though, that services which sustain children, might also prolong the time they spend in exploitative situations. Achieving a balance between this misplaced compassion' and providing life-saving emergency shelter, is a critical dilemma for some organisations.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">&quot;It is easy for a centre to lengthen the time the child will spend on the Street by cushioning its terrible realities from her  On the negative side we have buried almost 200 girls over the past 6 years<B>&quot;<A HREF="R/rooo2"> (The House, South Africa).</A></B></FONT><BR>

<H3><B>Community Work</B></H3>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Work within communities takes a variety of forms. Mobilising communities to develop and sustain a network of supportive relationships for children that have been sexually exploited appears to be a critical but challenging  step in the child's successful reintegration. Their acceptance and valuing within the community are powerful forces enabling the child to re-evaluate their own self image. This may be a crucial element in changing family attitudes. to allow re-entry into families, while strengthening their protection capacity. Establishing alternate income generation activities, trade training. building fundin~ 01~ credit facilities into the system, are also ways of trying to promote improved long term prospects for these exploited children and their families.</FONT><BR>

<H3>2.2.	<B>Psycho-Social Rehabilitation Approaches and Techniques</B></H3>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">The organisations in the case studies all recognised that children's needs extended beyond the practical, they saw at first hand the pain experienced by the children and the emotional and psychological trauma that has resulted, but many have experienced difficulties in terms of resources and/or expertise. in fully meeting these needs. However, they are attempting to offer children a service that addresses at least some of their psycho-social needs. To do this they need to assess:	The nature of who the children are, looking at each child's experiences and his/her responses to them, others within their social context; individuals, groups, systems, that have been crucial in defining the child's experiences, both positive and negative, and how these interact.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">The traumatic experiences cannot be isolated from their societal context and thus whatever treatment/therapy is offered, it must take the social phenomena that are the child's reality, fully into account. Programmes that fail to do so will be in danger of treating the child simply as a dysfunctional individual. This wider approach applies both m assessing the children's past experiences and future options. It is essential to understand how the past has contributed to any current pathology and to assess coping mechanisms and resources. In looking towards the future these elements can be harnessed and integrated with the appropriate intervention programmes, to combine to help each child achieve an enhanced and healthy maturity.</FONT><BR>

<H3>2.3.	<B>Techniques</B></H3>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Within all of these settings, the models of work that are seen as most effective look at the best ways of fostering the child's own sense of his/her worth. They incorporate three basic elements - teaching, healing and caring (Philippines). Through these they hope that the child can be helped to deal with the dysfunctional elements in their life. They frequently refer to the critical importance of listening to the children, responding to what they are saying about their own experiences, and what services and facilities they need.  An approach that is honest enough to respect and value the experiences and opinions of the young women who use the project will be one that engages their participation in the service&quot; (Bamardos, U.K.).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">This may be within therapeutic, clinical situations, offering intensive, individual, long term psychotherapy, but generally such projects are not widely available. Their high cost and ability to impact on very few children, relative to the scale of the problem, probably limits their immediate replaceability in many parts of the developing world.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Providing group therapy allows for more effective treatment, especially at the adolescent stage, for more children within the same time frame&quot; (Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Sexually Abused and Prostituted Children, Philippines).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">There has been some work on the application of such models, or at least of the utilisation of the insights learnt within these systems, to other settings, but the implementation, appropriateness, cross-cultural adaptability and applicability of some of this work is still being tested (Radda Barn en, Sweden and Philippines). Counselling. as it exists within many of the programmes, helps the child to see their experience as an abuse in which they are the victims or survivors, rather than as culpable and corrupting outcasts, removing the shame'.</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">... I can only rejoice and keep on thanking and being grateful that I have escaped from my unhappy black underground experience, and moving ahead with courage to face a bright and clean future   (Taiwan).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Again, such positive, affirming messages may be inherent in the everyday interactions of carers and children, rather than explicit, though it is extremely important for children to be clearly reassured about this and they may need to hear it directly.</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">These children have frequently been Jabe Jed by much of society and officialdom as common prostitutes', as immoral, as degenerates. They have an enormous need to be seen and referred to as children or young people with rights, deserving of support and nurture. Sensitivity to what terms are used and to what jargon or slang become incorporated into the programme culture are essential. Terms used must be understood by the children, but the use of street terminology can perpetuate this poor self-image, or self-hate.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Counselling is also used to explore options and choices with the young people, allowing them to make informed choices for themselves (U.K.). For this to be successful. it has to proceed at the pace dictated by the child. Information may be perceived as value laden. it may be presented in a way that makes the child feel obligated to the counsellor. and ti,'ing to double guess right answers , rather than making the correct choices for themselves. Decisions made in these circumstances are less likely to be acted upon.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Some projects. working with children from ethnic minorities. have made use of positive role models. drama, etc.. to change some of the negative stereotypes that have been taken on board by the children (Brasil). The mobilisation and equipping of the children themselves as agents for change, as actors. as advocates. as community organisers and as part of support networks for others. can all play a positive part in redressing the negative images to which many have been subjected for years. These skills may be transferable to many other situations. equipping the child with extra resources. But in itself, this experience of being helpful. of being powerful. of being recognised. is of tremendous importance in redirecting the children. in starting that process of reassessment of themselves. their position in society and their strengths (Brasil). The use of art. drama and music, as mediums for the expression of experiences and the feelings associated with them are also recognised as valuable techniques. allowing the child to address their suffering in less direct ways (Chile). They can operate on different levels, moving from a relatively superficial, but enjoyable and safe experience. to a profound. life changing catharsis, in which the use of these expressive in edi a, can allow expression. healing and self-discovery.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Working with abused children is a demanding and difficult task, fraught with risks of rejection on both sides. Some of these can be minimised through allowing the child to be ambivilent about leaving the attachments, dangers and excitement that may have been part of their experience. They are old in experience and yet have been denied the opportunity to mature and leam through the successive stages of development. Young people that have dimmed their pain through drug use may find it both physically and emotionally difficult to stop and be confronted with their past without this cushion. It has to be recognised that these forces exert a huge impact on the child, opposing the efforts to help the young person change and adopt new activities and attitudes. It means taking sufficient time, or working at a pace that is appropriate for the child.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">These children grow in phases and each time she tries she learns. With your help she can learn in progressive phases if she is guided not to see the end of a particular learning cycle as a failure&quot; (South Africa).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">The factors that motivate people to enter this area of work vary enormously, but selection and training are vitally important in allowing flexible, dynamic programmes to develop and respond to changing expressions and levels of need (Brasil). A commitment to, and inherent belief in, the innate worth and rights of the children is crucial. Values range from the humanist, to the spiritual, to the political.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Our strategies and approaches might be the same as others, but one thing that sticks us together in providing help and care to these children, is prayer. This work can be, you arid me against the world&quot; (Kalungan, Philippines).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Some projects refer to the positive impact that finding a commitment can have for the children, though the commitment may be to serving god, to helping other victims. or to changing society and may or may not reflect the values of the programme staff, fun ders or supporters.</FONT><BR>

<H2>VI;L IMPACT</H2>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Though there were specific sections of the case studies that referred to impact and evaluation of programmes, many groups have found it difficult to be precise about what, for them, constitutes a successful outcome, and many have struggled in clearly articulating or evaluating the consequences of their activities. This may be related to problems in identifying the specific impact of perhaps one element in a broad prevention programme of which they are only one part. Sometimes the difficulty appears to be based on limited follow-up with the children, and thus the organisations are unable to determine long term consequences for the individuals with whom they work. Many projects are fairly new and thus have only relatively recent experiences from which to measure and determine outcomes. Some projects establish clear criteria based on the child or young person staying out of the sex trade and classify any continued mvolvement as failure, regardless of any other changes for the young person. They are concerned that some of their efforts provide a child with the skifls to make him/herself more attractive and useful to potential exploiters.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Others perceive broad benefits, which have an impact on whole communities, where the abused child becomes a survivor and activist and may go on to play a pivotal role in changing attitudes and the climate in which other children can be adequately protected.</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Others talk of decreased numbers leaving the villages for the city, as indicators of a positive outcome. Numbers in school, or alternate education, or vocational skills programme are all cited. Some speak more generally of changed awareness of the reality of sexual exploitation, and enhanced protection.</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Another qualitative indicator is the effect CPCR's work has in terms of building the capacity of the family and organising the community in Akha village(s)   and on the national level, (it) is the acceptance by different disciplines of the usefulness of employing multi~disciplinary approaches to child abuse and the reform of the legal structure to provide for the protection of children's rights&quot; (Center for the Protection of Children's Rights, Thailand).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">These are less easily quantifiable. but are clearly significant.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Discussions with the projects are continuing, to try to ensure that the children's overviews about outcome and impact are incorporated into any evaluation. These will be included within the final report.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">The importance of defining criteria and indicators, as a way of improving and developing programmes, often seems to be accepted more in the abstract than in reality. Establishing certain agreed elements as useful indications of achieving initial objectives, would be a valuable process that would facilitate an evolutionary/developmental approach, based on actual consequences. This in no way minimises the difficulties in producing measurable indicators which have a relevance to the real problems, activities and desired outcomes.</FONT><BR>

<H3>VIII.<BR>
CONCLUDING REMARKS</H3>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">It will be necessany in the final report, to re-evaluate the material. both factual and unpressionistic. included in the case studies to try to establish. from the realitv of this current work with children. some generalised formulations for successful prevention and rehabilitative interventions and establish some measurable indicators ofoutcome. At this time only some broad conclusions can be offered.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">The problem can only be effectively tackled if children, their rights and potential. are perceived as crucial and central to future development and national wellbeing. To achieve a truly child-centred system, in which all policies are evaluated in terms that include their impact on children's welfare. is identified as being perhaps the only way of radically tackling this abuse.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Child welfare is not a charity. nor development of children ... merely a technical matter. Rather they sho~d be the basis of national development. Children are the true representatives of the future. The way children are treated today is the vard stick to measure the situation of the country tomorrow...&quot; Child Workers In Nepal, Nepal).</FONT><BR>
<CENTER></CENTER><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Raising awareness of the problem, about the number of children damaged and traumatised by their experiences, is an essential first step, if other therapeutic work is going to be accepted, supported and effective. This has to change public opinion, by accurately presenting the victims as abused children,</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Need to advocate strongly that this issue be seen not as prostitution&quot; but as the abuse of children and young people through sexual exploitation ... The task of education and awareness raising is a critical and urgent one&quot; (Bamardos, U.K.).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Information about the extent, the nature of the abuse and characteristics of the perpetrators, may all be crucial in forcing the issue into national and/or local consciousness, rather than allowing taboos, or the marginalising of victims or perpetrators to minimise or hide the problem.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">There are many different ways of achieving this end, but co-ordination and consistency are pre-requisites for an effective campaign.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">The legal framework can both protect and victimise. Laws designed to promote children's welfare and protect them from abuse should be activated to respond to the needs of the children, while criminal sanctions against those who abuse them need to be enforced. This would also do much to restate support for the child and intolerance of the abuse to which he/she has been subjected.  A system that introduces the concept of consent as a defence to charges of sexual offences involving children, denies children due protection, colludes with the perpetrators. and flies in the face of logic.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Participatory models, involving the children, their families and communities as key players in deciding strategies and content of programmes will probably be more effective and efficient. To be effective, intervention strategies must be responsive and reflect what the children and young people are saying. Their participation as more than passive consumers of services is critical. The ability to really listen to and respect the children, families and community leaders, to believe that they have insights, wisdom, ideas and skills that can inform, direct and evaluate programmes, is important. Using and developing the strengths and resources within communities will help to sustain any positive impact.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Partnerships between local. national and international groups, between professional disciplines, with the media and with economic interests, are the means for achieving sustainable change within the macro-environment and for developing integrated local plans for effective action. Organisations working in isolation find their sphere of influence and scope for achieving change, severely restricted, though with persistence and determination, even small organisations can impact a society's conscience and the way it thinks&quot; <B><A HREF="R/r0002">(The House, South Africa).</A></B></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Some of the most effective programmes work from a multi-disciplinary perspective. Agencies and professions can combine to provide the necessary range of services in a co-ordinated way, and through sharing their distinctive ethos or approach, can have a positive impact across traditional boundaries, to enhance services, to alter the understanding and value judgements that might have impeded access.</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Shared learning ... is a critical   component of successful intervention.&quot; (Barnardos, U.K.)</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">This approach also encourages those working with children to see them as whole people and to try to meet their needs holistically.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">..... In order to protect children's rights holistically. we need to employ very broad and multi-disciplinary approaches which link all aspects of society ...&quot;.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Addressing the psycho-social needs of abused children takes time and resources. but children have a right to expect services which are aimed at all of the consequences of the abuse they have experienced. Some agencies are focusing on developing quality care for fewer children, but in so doing, learning ways to enhance capability and promote successful replication.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">CPCR ... would rather assist fewer children each year. but provide holistic care in their best interests   At the same time we aim to build the capacity of other organisations, both governmental and non-governmental, to work on this issue&quot; (Center for the Protection of Children's Rights. Thailand).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">Efforts to develop therapeutic approaches to different cultural and social settings. to find effective combinations of approaches and seek additional funds and support, are all necessary for the enhancement of the quality of programmes.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">	It would be unrealistic to assume that any absolute or standard blueprint. with successful response strategies identified in a social and cultural vacuum. is possible. All projects will always need to adapt and evolve from within their own communities. using the strengths and resources of both adults and children.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">	Given that not all children subjected to similar environmental or familial pressures will become victims. the identification and application of concepts of resilience. to build protection strategies for individuals and to enhance rehabilitation prospects will increase the effectiveness of programmes.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">It is hoped that a feeling of solidarity, of not struggling alone, can emerge from the accounts of others who are facing similar problems, identifying small indications of progress, some working in very different areas, but whose commitment to improving the lives of children, working with and for the children themselves, remams resolute.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">These insights can be used by other practitioners, to help them avoid some of the mistakes, strengthen their negotiating position, and to plan, implement and develop programmes that can successfully help children who are being abused and subjected to the most fundamental denial of their rights. It represents the shared wisdom and experiences of some of those working day by day with children wbo are victimised, exploited and blamed. Their voices can inform, teach and help articulate and justify the urgent cal] for local, national and international strate~ies for child welfare programmes and social mobilisation policies that will address the needs of these children</FONT><BR>

<CENTER><h2>Eastern and Southern African Regional Consultation</h2>on the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children<BR>
<h1>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h1><BR>
Held in South Africa, Pretoria.</CENTER>

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Introduction: Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children<BR>
A problem on the rise in Africa</B><BR>
<BR>
The commercial sexual exploitation of children is on the rise in Africa and must become a major priority for every country in the region. Immediate actions must include awareness raising in every sector of society, the strengthening of legal protection and law enforcement, and allocation of adequate resources from governments to combat this problem.. These were among the recommendations of the 40 participants attending the Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Consultation for the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children held in Pretoria from 17-19 April, the first regional forum on the subject. &quot;Sexual exploitation of children is sometimes seen as a difficult issue for governments to address,&quot; said the Hon. Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi, South African Deputy Minister for Welfare and Population. Yet if Africa is to develop socially and economically, it must address these issues and not leave them hidden away, she said.<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, participants expressed concern that an over-emphasis by the Congress organizers on the commercial aspect of sexual exploitation restricted the scope. of the problem and would divert governments from addressing the broader and more urgent issue of sexual abuse and incest within the family. Participants also expressed concern about the small number of African governments who at this point have committed themselves to attending the<BR>
	World Congress and urged immediate mobilisation of the international community in the region to stimulate support.<BR>
<BR>
Participants at the Consultation included government and NGO representatives from ten African countries representatives from the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Swedish Ambassador to South Africa, Mr. Bo Heienback, World Congress Co-ordinator, Pauline 0'Dea, UNICEF Deputy Regional Director of ESAR, Z.K. Bendow, Regional Child Rights Policy Adviser, Kimberly Gamble Payne, and Representative of UNICEF South Africa, Scholastica Kimaryo. Organized by the UNICEF Regional and South Africa offices and supported by UNICEF-CEDC, New York, the consultation was generously hosted by the<BR>
National Programme of Action Steering Committee of the South African Government and the Human Sciences Resource Council of South Africa.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Scope and Nature of the Problem in the Region</B><BR>
Despite scarce data and the fact that the situation has not reached the alarming state that it has in some other regions, participants agreed that the commercial sexual exploitation of children, compounded by HIVIMDS and continuing conflict situations in 1/3 of the region's countries is a spreading social virus that must be eliminated before it becomes a social pandemic, said Z.K. Bendow, UNICEF Deputy Director of the Region.<BR>
<BR>
Despite local variations, country reports indicated certain common trends and patterns in Africa. Commercial sexual exploitation of children is primarily a street children phenomenon in Africa's major cities, an issue of &quot;survival sex&quot; where children's bodies are bought for money, food, clothing, or school fees. It also includes large numbers of children in refugee camps and military bases where fear and the lack of basic necessities are driving motivation, and along truck routes in Tanzania, coastal tourist areas in Kenya and fishing regions of Sierra Leone. The problem of sex tourism and trafficking were seen as emerging problems -- especially with regard to girls sent abroad as domestic servants with the full knowledge of the families that sexual abuse would be a part of the duties.<BR>
<BR>
Although pimps were cited in many cases of urban exploitation, the problem does not appear to be organised or run by &quot;criminal&quot; syndicates or networks. Direct exploitation of children stems mainly from the gratification of unscrupulous or unthinking individuals -- which include teachers, families, religious and community leaders, solders and UN peacekeepers, police, members of truck drivers, fishermen, tourists and others at all levels of society. But participants also felt that all sectors of society, including those whose role is to protect children and their rights -- through ignorance or indifference - for permitting, even perpetuating the problem. It was therefore. the responsibility of families, the government, all of civil society as well as the international community to change the situation.<BR>
<BR>
Participants emphasised the &quot;in kind&quot; rather than cash aspect of commercial sexual exploitation in the region. That is exchange of sex for &quot;payment&quot; other than money&quot;. This would include: lobola, or bride price; child marriage; exchange of children by families for sex for shelter or goods such as a cow or roof. It also refers to an exchange through abuse of power -- as in a student who exchanges sex for better grades.<BR>
<BR>
Although the problem is serious and growing, participants agreed that there is a disabling lack of awareness and commitment by government and civil society regarding the extent, in some cases even the existence of the problem. &quot;They walk on same street and breathe same air as I do,&quot; said one participant from Kenya. &quot;Why do they not see what I see?&quot; The invisibility of children is a major problem, said the representative from Swaziland. There is no forum for children to be heard and officials do not want to see children included in public policies.. Several country reports addressed the absence of separate government departments or sections for children and that child protection issues are buried several departments such as labour, welfare and culture.<BR>
The issue of age was raised in different contexts throughout the Consultation. Several country<BR>
reports laws which crirninalize prostitution make no distinction between child and adult; this means that children are often punished rather than protected or supported. Moreover, many national and customary laws exercise the right under the CRC to a younger age of majority in regard to sexual consent than the CRC. Child marriage itself in the view of many, reflects the attitude that child defilement is acceptable. Others emphasized that a child's legal sexual consent at an age below 18 should not be interpreted as waiving her/his right to protection against sexual exploitation according to Article 34.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Causes and Consequences</B><BR>
Participants agreed unanimously that there was a close and complex relationship among the consequences and immediate and underlying causes of commercial sexual exploitation of children and that they must all be addressed together. For example, several participants mentioned drug abuse as a direct cause of &quot;survival<B> </B>sex&quot;. At the same time, drug abuse was also cited as a consequence of child prostitution also closely related to family abuse which in turn cannot be separated from poverty, structural adjustment programmes, rural-urban migration family dislocation and breakdown of traditional structures and safety nets.<BR>
<BR>
HIV/AIDS was seen as major cause and consequence of the sexual exploitation of children. On the one hand, the spread of the disease and its deadly consequences has led to the dangerous myth that sex with a virgin or young girl will either cure or prevent AIDS, which in turn has stimulated an increase in child prostitution. At the same time, the growing number of sexually exploited children has contributed to the spread of HIV/AIDS among this most vulnerable population. It has also resulted in a huge rise in the number of orphans and of child-headed households where children must be wage earners, often resorting to &quot;survival sex&quot; as the only recourse.<BR>
<BR>
Structured adjustment programmes have contributed heavily to the continuing spiral of poverty, child prostitution and more poverty. In Zambia, for example, cutbacks in social services, have resulted in an annual educational allocation of 25 cents per child per year. This, of course, increases the out of school population, a lack of skill development and opportunity, and the subsequent compulsion to meet basic needs by any means possible. High unemployment resulting from structural adjustment has increased rural-urban mi-on which has led to breakdown of extended family structures as well as physical separation of families. One consequence of this is large populations of single males and immigration laws such as those in South Africa which prohibit ports of entry to the families of workers, exacerbate the situation by increasing the demand for and supply of available girls and young women for sex. Meanwhile, the wives and families they have left behind are often forced to seek out livings in demeaning and degrading ways<BR>
<BR>
The low status of girls and women was cited a number of times as a continuing cause and consequence of the problem. Lack of access to education, affecting mostly girls, prevents them from acquiring the adequate knowledge or skills for productive employment as women. In Zambia, the incidence of HIV/AIDS among young women aged 15-19 is 17 times higher than in the same age group of boys. Moreover, many girls are already mothers and heads of households by 15 with heavy responsibility but no authority within the family. Such a combination of circumstances make them easy targets for sexual exploitation with no option to reflise abuse by family members or others.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The question of values  </B>in relation to commercial sexual exploitation of children ran through many of the workshop and plenary discussions. Participants engaged in a lengthy discussion about the complex relationship between sexual exploitation of children and the loss of traditional values, family structures and safety nets, coupled with the continuation of hamifiLl practices and the growing consumerism described as &quot;prosperity gospel&quot; by one participant. Raising questions such as how we distinguish between poverty-driven behaviour and cultural values that contradict the CRC, the meeting recognized that developing effective strategies requires that we flirther explore and better understand these issues.<BR>
<BR>
Continuing conflict in more then one-third of the region's countries produces large populations 6frefbgee and inteanally displaced families who are subject to sub5tandard living conditions and severe psycho-social stresses. These children as well as those who have been separated from their families become especially vulnerable to the exigencies of their situation and easy prey to sexual exploitation by local and international armed forces, UN peacekeepers, and other adults. The ethic of violence thus becomes commonplace and directed in a uxual form against girls and women.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Themes of the World Congress</B><BR>
In three working groups, Consultation participants discussed and made recommendations in relation to the nine themes of the Congress, each group addressing three related theme. Below are the main recommendations and discussion highlights.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Group I: Law reform and law enforcement, pornography and sex tourism.</B><BR>
<BR><UL>
<LI>Interpret broadly the 'in kind' dement of &quot;commercial&quot; sexual exploitation to include a variety of cultural contexts. The monetary element in relation to sexual exploitation of children is not as strong in Africa as in other regions.<BR>
<BR>
	<LI>Take into account both statutory and customary law in legal revision for harmonization with CRC, especially Article 34. In some countries customary law is recognized in the national constitution; in many cases it is the only law known and accepted by the local communities. Failing to take it into account might result in the failure of the CRC to reach the local level.<BR>
<BR>
	<LI>Educate and raise awareness on all levels in society, foremost among officials:<BR>
police, hospitals, courts about the CRC and national laws that protect children. Translate laws into local languages.<BR>
<BR>
	<LI>Encourage mandatory obligations for various categories of officials (hospitals etc) to report cases of suspected sexual abuse to police and other concerned authorities.<BR>
	Implement measures against trafficking (in girls) at national level.<BR>
</UL><BR>
<UL><B>Group II: Education, Health, Prevention and Rehabilitation</B><BR>
<BR>
	<LI>Improve access to education and retention in school for all children, especially girls.<BR>
Participants expressed the view that children not in school are far more prone to sexual or<BR>
other forms of exploitation.<BR>
<BR>
	<LI>Review curricula to incorporate relevant health and sexuality education, development of life<BR>
skills<BR>
<BR>
	<LI>Review by World Bank of social impact of structural adjustment<BR>
<BR>
	<LI>Demonstrate real commitment by governments of high priority of child protection through<BR>
increased budget allocations to child-friendly education, health and rehabilitation services and<BR>
information.<BR>
<BR>
	<LI>Raise awareness and train relevant social sectors about the existence, scope and harmful<BR>
physical and psycho-social impact of sexual exploitation of children and of harmful<BR>
traditional practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation. Parents sometimes<BR>
believe that accurate health or other information should not be given to children. And<BR>
insensitivity by health and other social service professionals to the needs of girls and women<BR>
was seen as one of the factors leading to inadequate or inappropriate interventions.<BR>
<BR>
	<LI>Harmonize labour and education laws in terms of age<BR>
<BR>
	<LI>Improve school environment to be more child friendly<BR>
<BR>
	<LI>Build and strengthen supportive family structures<BR>
</UL><BR>
<B>Group III. Human Values, Role of the Media, the Sex Exploiter</B><BR>
<BR>
<UL><LI>Through research and discussion, disentangle poverty and culture as the causes of sexual<BR>
exploitation of children. This is not to justify behaviour but to better understand it in the<BR>
search for effective strategies. Understanding the relationship of motivations that impel a<BR>
family to sell their daughter for money, a cow or other material goods may help to design<BR>
strategies that influence behaviour and facilitate respect for a daughter and her rights.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>CRC must be seen as the ethical and moral minimum. There is a need to have a common<BR>
reference point for concerted action. No other value system can provide communality as the<BR>
CRC which is the strongest and most unifying framework for this Congress.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Review traditional law and practices to identity elements that value and protect children.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Establish national and international media watch networks to monitor publications that<BR>
promote escort services, massage parlours and other sexually exploitative ''services<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Educate media at national level to understand and act on the rights of the child. Media is<BR>
often violating children's privacy rights by publishing photos of child victims of commercial<BR>
sexual exploitation, whereas this would not have occurred if an adult had been a Similar<BR>
kind of victim.</UL><BR>
<BR>
<B>Highlights of Discussion on the Draft Declaration and Agenda for Action</B><BR>
A drafting group reviewed the Declaration and Agenda for Action, and proposed amendments that better reflected the African context. Participants felt that &quot;commercial&quot; sexual exploitation of children presented too narrow a scope which excluded the African reality. Although the &quot;in kind&quot; reference in Article 4 of the Declaration left some room for addressing transactions not strictly monetary or even material but frequently power or fear related, the term &quot;commercial&quot; still created a mind-set that was too money oriented. The meeting decided to write a preambular statement advocating a lessening on the commercial aspect while increasing focus on the sexual exploitation aspects.<BR>
Participants also felt there was too strong an emphasis on criminality in the Declaration; in the<BR>
African experience, they believe the criminal organization in sexual exploitation of children is<BR>
minimal and a number of other key factors (poverty, family disintegration, etc.) were overshadowed by being placed collectively in a later article. (Article 7). As a result the group suggested merging Articles 5 and 7 as a new article 5.<BR>
<BR>
Because of the prevalence of armed conflict in the region, participants felt that armed forces and peacekeepers should be included in Article 6.<BR>
<BR>
Suggested amendments attached.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Recommendations for Follow up</B><BR>
The following is a proposed set of actions that could be taken both before and after the Congress, and at national and regional levels, by government, NGO's and international community partners.<BR>
<BR>
<B>National level</B><BR>
<BR><OL>
<LI>	Governments should be urged to include representatives of civil society in the official Congress delegation.<BR>
Action:	NGOs<BR>
<BR>
<LI>	National workshops to be organized prior to and after the congress within existing networks of government and NGOs. One of the objectives would be to integrate this issue into on-going advocacy for child rights. Support for the meetings should be mobilized at country level.<BR>
Action:	NGOs, UNICEF, <FONT SIZE=4>ILO </FONT>and International <FONT SIZE=4>Community Partners</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<LI>	Proposals for funding activities aimed at broad-based advocacy, capacity-building and service delivery should be prepared for submission to national donors prior to the Congress. The Congress participants should be aware of the financial implications of plans of action to combat sexual exploitation of children and to reintegrate child victims into society as a matter of urgency.<BR>
Action:	NGOs<BR>
<BR>
Regional Level<BR>
<BR>
<LI>	There is a need to establish a regional and an inter-regional mechanism for experience and information exchange in order to maximiae the use of limited resources and to build solidarity in Africa on this complex and sensitive issue. The Consultation recommended that UNICEF Pretoria, UNICEF Regional Office and the Human Sciences Research Council develop a mechanism in co-operation with national and regional NGOs to meet the information needs of the countries in the region Information exchange is needed both before and immediately following the Congress.<BR>
Action: UNICEF, HSRC and interested NGOs<BR>
<BR>
<LI>	Finally, there was consensus on the need for systematic and on-going participatory research in the area of sexual abuse and exploitation of children in Africa Every country represented expressed concern about the lack of reliable information as a major constraint to mobilization of public, opinion and political will to take action on this issue. It was suggested that the HSRC should consider acting as a co-ordinating body for the development of an African research agenda. Co-operation with the international community and other research institutions in Africa is expected. Action: HSRC, UNICEF, Government of Sweden, NGOs<BR>
<BR>
<LI>	The finding and expressions of concern from the Regional Consultation in Africa should be reported to the Heads of State Meeting of the OAU in June. Government leaders should be urged to participate in the Congress and commit themselves to supporting national and community efforts to combat sexual exploitation of children.<BR>
	Action: UNICEF, ILO, Government of Sweden<BR>
<BR>
<LI>	Commercial Sexual Exploitation of African Children should be a focus of attention by organizers of events commemorating the Day of the African Child, June 16, 1996. <BR>
	Action: UNICEF, governments and NGOs.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>	The global agenda for action emanating from the Congress should be considered for support and active participation by the continental congress of the All Africa Council of Churches meeting, scheduled to take place in October 1997 in Addis Ababa.<BR>
	Action: NGOs and AACC Secretariat.<PRE>

<p>Should prostitution be legalized? Does drugs become legal too, (85% of prostitutes are drug addicts). How would it affect our children?<br> <b>What do You think?</b></p><br>

<p><b>Jay:</b><br>It's a good idea, legalize it.<br>Maybe our police can concentrate on more important things. <br>It can't affect our children if we keep them away from these areas.</p>

<hr align="center" size="6" width="350">

<p><b>Swanky:</b><br>I am a prostitute, or as others prefer, a sex therapist. Why should the oldest trade ever be discriminated against?<br>
Prostitutes were supported by the church for thousands of years, it's only been a so called sin for the last 150 odd years. It is true that a lot of the girls and guys use drugs. Maybe if there would be less stigma and pressure on us, it would be easier to do our work.<br> If you talk about legal, does it mean certain control will also be implemented? Do You think there should be control? <br>Personally I think there should be. We are constantly being abused by the Agency owners. We do have the right to complain u know.</p>

<H4>Is a site where we hope to carry a multitude of Operation Manuals, Constitutions, Project Plans, Budgets and other programme outlines.  - Why?
<P>Because many organisations need ideas or help with the planning of their own projects, and will find it very helpful to also see how other organisations run their projects.  That's Why.
<P>NGOs are invited to submit their programme ideas and plans for publication here.  This will really help many individuals and existing organisations out there to realise their ideas into workable solutions to help children.</H4><BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><B>WELFARE PROGRAMME FOR THE </B></H3>



<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><B><I>HILLBROW DROP-IN CENTRE<BR>

FOR GIRLS</I></B></H1>



<P><BR>

<BR>

<B>The Drop-in Centre does not aim to provide solutions or resources to

serve the therapeutic needs of these children, it simply provides a retrieval

mechanism, to get the children out of their traps. Hillbrow Drop-In aims

at making the first step of retrieval and referral to a further programme

possible. <BR>

<BR>

Field work is an integral aspect of a Drop-in Centre and makes the initial

contact with the child. The programmes at the centre provide certain resources,

hoping to instil in the child the desire to get out of the street, and

then provides skills and opportunities to make such a step possible.</B><BR>

<BR>

</P>



<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><B>MISSION STATEMENT</B></H3>



<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><B>To retrieve female children from the <I>Streets,</I>

they learned from the programmes. </B></LI>



<LI><B>To provide, by means of these programmes, a first base the children

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><B>CONTINUOUS PROGRAMMES</B></H3>



<P><B>Life skills training<BR>

A series of courses, units, are presented under this umbrella. Some courses

are selected from the Sexuality and Life Skills Education Workbook (Department

of Health) are: communication, sexuality, sex education, human reproduction,

contraception and abortion, reproductive health care, sexually transmitted

diseases, HIV/Aids, self-image, relationship building, personal hygiene,

cooking, banking, what is sexual abuse?, literacy, basic maths, budgeting,

social skills, drug education, investigating roots, taking charge of your

life. Each unit carries a specified amount of merits and may be presented

as an afternoon course or may even be as long as over three consecutive

days. These programmes are presented and managed by volunteers.<BR>

<BR>

Group participatory programmes<BR>

These programmes vary in nature between social activities (such as birthday

parties, theatre, zoo visits, religious practice) sports, academic and

cultural programmes. These programmes are presented and managed by volunteers.

</B><BR>

</P>



<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><B>PERSONNEL</B></H3>



<P><B>These two programmes are geographically located in the heart of the

murder capital of the world, and the children it serves have been so conditioned

to survive the most treacherous of sub-cultures in this country. Our staff

work amidst the dynamics of the illicit drug and sex trade and we lose

about thirty children per year to murders and drug related deaths. Our

premises are regularly burgled; our cars are being stolen and burgled,

and we deal with occasional threats from pimps and prostitution networks.

Other aspects that add tremendous stress to workers is the mindset of the

crack cocaine abuser and the manic environment these people create, as

well as the sexually deviant work our clients are involved in, cry about,

and die about. <BR>

<BR>

It is for these reasons that all our staff must not live-in and must be:

of the highest possible calibre; exceptionally well trained; well monitored;

in counselling; paid well enough not to have undue financial worries. Even

volunteer workers involved in these programmes attend an eight-month counselling

course and must receive regular counselling and therapeutic attention in

order to survive. </B></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><B>ABBREVIATED OPERATION MANUAL</B></H3>



<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><B><I>Philosophy<BR>

Although the centre operates on the harm reduction principle, following

that it is better for the children to be in the centre than on the streets,

it should never</I> <I>be seen as a 'lounge for prostitutes' or to be making

life on the streets easier so as to condone <BR>

- but rather to be a temporary therapeutic intervention in the lives of

these children, assisting them to come to decisions and to put into practice

a feasible Future Plan.</I></B></H4>



<P><BR>

<B>Newcomers<BR>

Newcomers are understood to be girls that are on the street but have not

made use of the facility in the past, or girls that have made use of the

facility in the past but have been absent for a considerable time. Newcomers

will be introduced to the programme by a staff member. During the newcomer's

first visit a staff member will explain the nature, purpose and expectancies

of the centre. During the first, or at latest during the second visit,

the Drop-in Initial Assessment form (attached) will be completed with the

child, whereafter a temporary identity document will be issued. The Rules

will be explained and a copy of the Rules are handed to the child. The

newcomer's case will be presented at the next assessment meeting (held

once per week and attended by at least all the permanent staff members)

where the possibilities of a Future Plan will be discussed.<BR>

<BR>

Identity Document<BR>

A copy of an identity document is attached. The identity document serves

as an important group affiliation, 'belonging' and 'decision to change'

device but also serves a very practical purpose in that deceased children

can be identified by the SAPS and City Morgue personnel and proper burials

and family notification can be facilitated.<BR>

<BR>

The Future Plan<BR>

The Future Plan (see attached example) is a plan of future action and wish

lists compiled by the child, with the guidance of a counsellor, but specifically

aimed at re-integration into mainstream society (whether this process involves

drug rehabilitation, reintegration with families, foster or care placement,

etc.) The counsellor helps the child set the Aims of the Plan and then

further assist the child to set achievable objectives on the way. Development

of the Future Plan can be a lengthy process and need not be done in one

session and it is never regarded to be 'set in stone' but rather as a dynamic

flexible guide on the Way.<BR>

From time to time, at least once per month, the counsellor will assist

the child to evaluate her performance against her Future Plan - guidance,

support and encouragement will be given and adaptations to the Plan can

be made at these sessions. <BR>

Counsellors will present Future Plans and discuss the progress of the child

at monthly assessment meetings.<BR>

<BR>

Monitoring mechanisms<BR>

Alongside to, and integrated with the Future Plan, a merit and demerit

system operates both as initiative and monitoring systems. Children are

awarded merits and demerits for their level of performance with regard

to participation in the programme. Merit points are awarded for behaviour,

programme participation, timeous arrival for appointments, hygiene, sensible

employment of moneys, discipline, group interaction, etc.<BR>

Earning the right to be trusted and to be awarded further assistance and

care is the fundamental principle behind these systems. Based on the Future

Plan a decision is made on the amount of merit points a child needs to

obtain before further privileges are bestowed and, ultimately, before referral

to a further programme will be facilitated. <BR>

For example, the child and counsellor may decide, when drawing up the future

plan, that 150 merits are to be obtained within three months before The

House will refer the child for Drug Rehabilitation whereafter reintegration

with the family will be attempted. According to the Future Plan the child

understands that these merits can be gained by attending the group sessions

for those in preparation for rehabilitation (20 merits); taking the form

down to the District Surgeon and having her medical check-up (20 merits);

attending the dentistry clinic to have two bad teeth extracted (30 merits)

and a visit to the Esselen street clinic for STD and gynaecological check-up

(30 merits); attending the cooking classes (20 merits); completing at least

three units of the Life Skills course (60 merits); contacting her parents

and writing them a letter (20 merits). The child may lose some merit points

because of her lack of participation in group and in cooking class, she

also does not attend the dental clinic at all but decides to have an HIV

test and to do two domestic science units instead. She still gains her

merits and has not only earned the 'right' to rehabilitation but has also

made the necessary paradigm shift to make a success of the opportunities.

Assisting the child to be successful in future determining attempts such

as described here is of utmost importance since few children make comebacks

after failing themselves in serious attempts.<BR>

<BR>

Day-to-day Running<BR>

<BR>

No males, excepting staff, are allowed beyond the lobby area.<BR>

<BR>

The centre opens at 11:00 and ideally does not close before 22:00, Mondays

to Saturdays.<BR>

<BR>

A church service is provided on Sunday afternoons.<BR>

<BR>

Free condoms are made available to girls.<BR>

<BR>

A gate is opened by a staff member to allow persons access to the centre

beyond the reception area.<BR>

<BR>

Sandwiches are served between 12:00 and 13:00, 16:00 and 17:00 and 19:00

and 20:00.<BR>

<BR>

Tea and Coffee is made available at any time, to a maximum of four cups

per person per day.<BR>

<BR>

Television viewing will be allowed at times, regulated so as not to interfere

with therapeutic programmes.<BR>

The office should always be locked if the area is unsecured. Staff should

expect to be held responsible for the loss of items from the office since

the possibility of theft comes with the area and can never be discounted.<BR>

<BR>

The log recording the amount of persons visiting the centre and the purpose

of the visits as well as the activities in the centre should be kept with

precision.<BR>

<BR>

A weekly staff meeting is held where information pertaining to newcomers

are discussed.<BR>

<BR>

A monthly staff meeting is held where progress reports on each child is

discussed.<BR>

<BR>

Staff<BR>

A schematic representation of the staff structure appears earlier in this

document. The permanent staff employed by this organisation represents

only the maximum amount of persons that can be afforded and the minimum

amount of persons needed to do but superficial management of the centre.

This project relies heavily on the employment of volunteer staff - in fact

it is the quality of the volunteer staff that determines the efficiency

of the project. A minimum of eighteen trained and available volunteers

are to be employed. All staff members report to the Manager.<BR>

<BR>

Standard Drop-in's<BR>

A difference is made between what are termed 'standard Drop-in's' and 'runaways'.

The latter is dealt with later. The former is a child known to the staff

and is not a first time visitor to the centre.<BR>

These children all have Future Plans and hopefully attend the various programmes

presented by the centre. Identity documents are issued for these children

and should be presented to allow access to the centre.<BR>

Staff members are tasked to maintain discipline in the centre. Although

the usual motivator is to be both the merit system and good child-staff

relations. more severe methods of ascertaining discipline can be utilised.

Temporary expulsion from the centre may be effected as a serious means

of discipline. A list is displayed informing all persons concerned of the

date upon which those children who have been expelled from the centre,

may return.<BR>

<BR>

Runaways<BR>

Runaways are generally regarded as innocent to the Street and as at risk

of being corrupted by the experience of it. Everything in our power must

be done to prevent this contamination from occurring and all care must

be taken to deal with this child as efficiently and quickly as possible.

The bureaucratic systems prove to be the most insistent stumbling block

in this process but if the prescriptions in the operation manual is followed

carefully this sometimes malignant system can work for the child. All unknown

children living on the street, and those coming into the centre, should

be treated as runaways until such time as more is learnt about them. <BR>

In the initial interview with the child it must be determined whether the

child is at risk of contamination to the Street. If this proves to be true

the child must immediately be moved, with the child's permission and co-operation,

to the Place of Safety. Refer to Runaways in the operation manual of Intombi

Shelter for further instructions.<BR>

<BR>

Referrals<BR>

Informal referrals can be made simply by writing the details of the resource(s)

down on paper, explaining to the child what the resource's procedures are,

and handing the information over.<BR>

In order to make a formal referral the child will have to meet with certain

conditions and the referral is processed through The House's system. <BR>

<BR>

Field Work<BR>

Field Work is done by specifically trained volunteers and a specially trained

staff member. These workers complete the Certificate Informal Counselling,

the Drug and Sub-culture courses, and are screened and monitored. Field

workers complete control documentation on each visit to the Street. A dynamic

database of activities in the Street where children are involved is maintained.

For further information refer the operation manual for Field Workers, a

restricted access document.</B><BR>

</P>



<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><B>Procedure Manual</B></H2>



<CENTER><P><B>(only a portion, I hope the rest will follow soon)</B><BR>

</P></CENTER>



<H3><B>1.1 Intake of Runaways/Destitute Children</B></H3>



<P><B>Intake procedures for runaways are the most sensitive of procedures.

The purpose of these intakes into 'Place of Safety' is to provide temporary

shelter to a destitute child whilst we provide her with the intervention

and assistance to realise her ideals for her own life. We do make the child's

wishes our primary objective and we provide her with guidance to make the

right decisions as to what she would like to facilitate for herself. A

primary objective should always be reconciliation with parents, family

or guardians when appropriate. It is usually the task of a multi-disciplinary

team to decide how such a reconciliation is appropriate. 'Place of Safety'

intakes or referrals should always be on an urgent basis and the case should

be adequately processed within a period of between two days and an extreme

maximum of six weeks<BR>

<BR>

Only experienced youth therapists or senior staff members may facilitate

this procedure. Reasons for this precaution only start with the fact that

almost everything that is done for the child contravenes the Child Care

Act, but the Act is insufficient and that is why we are here to help children

who fall through its cracks. The philosophy behind these procedures is,

</B></P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B><I>'Be swift in your actions, Think everything over twice, Consider

all the parties involved, Provide the child and all concerned with enough

information to act on, record everything on her file - Be there for the

child and listen to her needs and her perceived ideas of the truth.'</I>

</B></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<H3><B>The Steps</B></H3>



<OL>

<LI><B>Assure the child that we will only act in her best interests; that

our task is to assist her in working out a plan of action to facilitate

a healthy alternative for her future; that we are here to hold her hand

as we walk through the System; that we will negotiate on her behalf with

parents, guardians, welfare, police, etc.; that we can only do this if

she is absolutely honest with us, and trusts us to represent her; THAT

WE WILL DO NOTHING, AND SAY NOTHING TO ANYONE, WITHOUT HER EXPLICIT CONSENT.

</B></LI>



<LI><B>Explain to her that we need to remain, insofar possible, within

the parameters of the Law - and we thus need to consider notifying the

guardians (even if via the CPU), the CPU and Welfare, of the fact that

she is seeking our assistance and safekeeping. If this step is done prior

to gaining the trust of the child she will either lie more than usual or

she will run away from the shelter. </B></LI>



<LI><B>Obtain the information as per the Initial Interview and Intake for

Destitute Children document. Stress confidentiality as per 1 above. </B></LI>



<LI><B>Explain the shelter rules and stress the fact that she is not incarcerated

and may leave at her own will at any time. Explain that whilst she awaits

a final placement or reconciliation with her guardians she will be a guest

in the shelter, that she must do her utmost not to upset the status quo

and that if she should leave the shelter with another child that it would

constitute a criminal offence that will have serious consequences. Only

allow placement in the shelter if the child is amiable to joining in and

working towards a better alternative for her life. Only facilitate the

placement if a time frame is agreed upon by the child. </B></LI>



<LI><B>If appropriate, register your notification or request for assistance

to CPU and Welfare by fax, and follow up to see if it was received. Facilitate

notification to the guardians if appropriate. </B></LI>



<LI><B>Follow-up actions must be swift, urgent and conducted without allowing

any delays. Keep the child informed of progress. Do not allow the child

to feel that she is helpless in this situation; always give her options

to decide on. She must never feel that we are doing things 'to' or 'for'

her but rather that we are assisting her to make her decisions possible.

Every day that the child is out of school, that she is in the shelter without

engaging in a Future Plan, that she is exposed to the Street culture -

is a risk to that child - so act in extreme urgency. </B></LI>

<BR>
The Drop-in Centre does not aim to provide solutions or resources to serve the therapeutic needs of these children, it simply provides a retrieval mechanism, to get the children out of their traps.  Hillbrow Drop-In aims at making the first step of retrieval and referral to a further programme possible.  <BR>
<BR>
Field work is an integral aspect of a Drop-in Centre and makes the initial contact with the child.  The programmes at the centre provide certain resources, hoping to instil in the child the desire to get out of the street, and then provides skills and opportunities to make such a step possible.<BR>
<BR>

<CENTER>MISSION STATEMENT</CENTER>

<CENTER>To retrieve female children from the <I>Streets,</I> particularly from the sub-cultures of vice in the Johannesburg area, by means of providing Life Skills training, counselling and the capacity to choose alternative options - for those who visit the centre.</CENTER>
<CENTER>
<H3>AIMS</H3>
</CENTER>
To provide a non-residential care centre for female children on the street in the Johannesburg area.


To provide for the basic physical, emotional and social needs of these children, enhancing their quality of life, in line with the harm reduction principle, without making life on the street so bearable that motivation to rehabilitate is lost.


To act as an assessment and referral centre for these children making reintegration with family and/or mainstream society an option within their reach.

The Future Plan (see attached example) is a plan of future action and wish lists compiled by the child, with the guidance of a counsellor, but specifically aimed at re-integration into mainstream society (whether this process involves drug rehabilitation, reintegration with families, foster or care placement, etc.)  The counsellor helps the child set the Aims of the Plan and then further assist the child to set achievable objectives on the way.  Development of the Future Plan can be a lengthy process and need not be done in one session and it is never regarded to be 'set in stone' but rather as a dynamic flexible guide on the Way.<BR>
	From time to time, at least once per month, the counsellor will assist the child to evaluate her performance against her Future Plan - guidance, support and encouragement will be given and adaptations to the Plan can be made at these sessions.  <BR>
	Counsellors will present Future Plans and discuss the progress of the child at monthly assessment meetings.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Monitoring mechanisms</B><BR>
Alongside to, and integrated with the Future Plan, a merit and demerit system operates both as initiative and monitoring systems.  Children are awarded merits and demerits for their level of performance with regard to participation in the programme.  Merit points are awarded for behaviour, programme participation, timeous arrival for appointments, hygiene, sensible employment of moneys, discipline, group interaction, etc.<BR>
	Earning the right to be trusted and to be awarded further assistance and care is the fundamental principle behind these systems.  Based on the Future Plan a decision is made on the amount of merit points a child needs to obtain before further privileges are bestowed and, ultimately, before referral to a further programme will be facilitated.  <BR>
	For example, the child and counsellor may decide, when drawing up the future plan, that 150 merits are to be obtained within three months before The House will refer the child for Drug Rehabilitation whereafter reintegration with the family will be attempted.  According to the Future Plan the child understands that these merits can be gained by attending the group sessions for those in preparation for rehabilitation (20 merits);  taking the form down to the District Surgeon and having her medical check-up (20 merits);  attending the dentistry clinic to have two bad teeth extracted (30 merits) and a visit to the Esselen street clinic for STD and gynaecological check-up (30 merits);  attending the cooking classes (20 merits);  completing at least three units of the Life Skills course (60 merits);  contacting her parents and writing them a letter (20 merits).  The child may lose some merit points because of her lack of participation in group and in cooking class, she also does not attend the dental clinic at all but decides to have an HIV test and to do two domestic science units instead.  She still gains her merits and has not only earned the 'right' to rehabilitation but has also made the necessary paradigm shift to make a success of the opportunities.  Assisting the child to be successful in future determining attempts such as described here is of utmost importance since few children make comebacks after failing themselves in serious attempts.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Day-to-day Running</B><BR>
<BR>
No males, excepting staff,  are allowed beyond the lobby area.<BR>
<BR>
The centre opens at 11:00 and ideally does not close before 22:00, Mondays to Saturdays.<BR>
<BR>
A church service is provided on Sunday afternoons.<BR>
<BR>
Free condoms are made available to girls.<BR>
<BR>
A gate is opened by a staff member to allow persons access to the centre beyond the reception area.<BR>
<BR>
Sandwiches are served between 12:00 and 13:00, 16:00 and 17:00 and 19:00 and 20:00.<BR>
<BR>
Tea and Coffee is made available at any time, to a maximum of four cups per person per day.<BR>
<BR>
Television viewing will be allowed at times, regulated so as not to interfere with therapeutic programmes.<BR>
The office should always be locked if the area is unsecured.  Staff should expect to be held responsible for the loss of items from the office since the possibility of theft comes with the area and can never be discounted.<BR>
<BR>
The log recording the amount of persons visiting the centre and the purpose of the visits as well as the activities in the centre should be kept with precision.<BR>
<BR>
A weekly staff meeting is held where information pertaining to newcomers are discussed.<BR>
<BR>
A monthly staff meeting is held where progress reports on each child is discussed.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Staff</B><BR>
A schematic representation of the staff structure appears earlier in this document.  The permanent staff employed by this organisation represents only the maximum amount of persons that can be afforded and the minimum amount of persons needed to do but superficial management of the centre.  This project relies heavily on the employment of volunteer staff - in fact it is the quality of the volunteer staff that determines the efficiency of the project.  A minimum of eighteen trained and available volunteers are to be employed.  All staff members report to the Manager.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Standard Drop-in's</B><BR>
A difference is made between what are termed 'standard Drop-in's' and 'runaways'.  The latter is dealt with later.  The former is a child known to the staff and is not a first time visitor to the centre.<BR>
<B>	</B>These children all have Future Plans and hopefully attend the various programmes presented by the centre.  Identity documents are issued for these children and should be presented to allow access to the centre.<BR>
	Staff members are tasked to maintain discipline in the centre.  Although the usual motivator is to be both the merit system and good child-staff relations. more severe methods of ascertaining discipline can be utilised.  Temporary expulsion from the centre may be effected as a serious means of discipline.  A list is displayed informing all persons concerned of the date upon which those children who have been expelled from the centre, may return.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Runaways</B><BR>
Runaways are generally regarded as innocent to the Street and as at risk of being corrupted by the experience of it.  Everything in our power must be done to prevent this contamination from occurring and all care must be taken to deal with this child as efficiently and quickly as possible.  The bureaucratic systems prove to be the most insistent stumbling block in this process but if the prescriptions in the operation manual is followed carefully this sometimes malignant system can work for the child.  All unknown children living on the street, and those coming into the centre, should be treated as runaways until such time as more is learnt about them.  <BR>
	In the initial interview with the child it must be determined whether the child is at risk of contamination to the Street.  If this proves to be true the child must immediately be moved, with the child's permission and co-operation, to the Place of Safety.  Refer to Runaways in the operation manual of Intombi Shelter for further instructions.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Referrals</B><BR>
Informal referrals can be made simply by writing the details of the resource(s) down on paper, explaining to the child what the resource's procedures are, and handing the information over.<BR>
	In order to make a formal referral the child will have to meet with certain conditions and the referral is processed through The House's system. <BR>
<B>	</B><BR>
<B>Field Work</B><BR>
Field Work is done by specifically trained volunteers and a specially trained staff member.  These workers complete the Certificate Informal Counselling, the Drug and Sub-culture courses, and are screened and monitored.  Field workers complete control documentation on each visit to the Street.  A dynamic database of activities in the Street where children are involved is maintained.  For further information refer the operation manual for Field Workers, a restricted access document.<BR>

<H3>Procedure Manual</H3>
</CENTER>
<CENTER><B>(only a portion, I hope the rest will follow soon)</B></CENTER>
<BR>

<H3>1.1  Intake of Runaways/Destitute Children</H3>
Intake procedures for runaways are the most sensitive of procedures.  The purpose of these intakes into 'Place of Safety' is to provide temporary shelter to a destitute child whilst we provide her with the intervention and assistance to realise her ideals for her own life.  We do make the child's wishes our primary objective and we provide her with guidance to make the right decisions as to what she would like to facilitate for herself.  A primary objective should always be reconciliation with parents, family or guardians when appropriate.  It is usually the task of a multi-disciplinary team to decide how such a reconciliation is appropriate.  'Place of Safety' intakes or referrals should always be on an urgent basis and the case should be adequately processed within a period of between two days and an extreme maximum of six weeks<BR>
<BR>
Only experienced youth therapists or senior staff members may facilitate this procedure.  Reasons for this precaution only start with the fact that almost everything that is done for the child contravenes the Child Care Act, but the Act is insufficient and that is why we are here to help children who fall through its cracks.  The philosophy behind these procedures is, 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>'Be swift in your actions, Think everything over twice, Consider all the parties involved, Provide the child and all concerned with enough information to act on, record everything on her file - Be there for the child and listen to her needs and her perceived ideas of the truth.'</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><B>The Steps</B></H3>

<OL>
<LI>Assure the child that we will only act in her best interests;  that our task is to assist her in working out a plan of action to facilitate a healthy alternative for her future;  that we are here to hold her hand as we walk through the System;  that we will negotiate on her behalf with parents, guardians, welfare, police, etc.;  that we can only do this if she is absolutely honest with us, and trusts us to represent her;  THAT WE WILL DO NOTHING, AND SAY NOTHING TO ANYONE, WITHOUT HER EXPLICIT CONSENT.

</LI>
<LI>Explain to her that we need to remain, insofar possible, within the parameters of the Law - and we thus need to consider notifying the guardians (even if via the CPU), the CPU and Welfare, of the fact that she is seeking our assistance and safekeeping.  If this step is done prior to gaining the trust of the child she will either lie more than usual or she will run away from the shelter.

</LI>
<LI>Obtain the information as per the Initial Interview and Intake for Destitute Children document.  Stress confidentiality as per 1 above.

</LI>
<LI>Explain the shelter rules and stress the fact that she is not incarcerated and may leave at her own will at any time.  Explain that whilst she awaits a final placement or reconciliation with her guardians she will be a guest in the shelter, that she must do her utmost not to upset the status quo and that if she should leave the shelter with another child that it would constitute a criminal offence that will have serious consequences.  Only allow placement in the shelter if the child is amiable to joining in and working towards a better alternative for her life.  Only facilitate the placement if a time frame is agreed upon by the child.

</LI>
<LI>If appropriate, register your notification or request for assistance to CPU and Welfare by fax, and follow up to see if it was received.  Facilitate notification to the guardians if appropriate.

</LI>
<LI>Follow-up actions must be swift, urgent and conducted without allowing any delays.  Keep the child informed of progress.  Do not allow the child to feel that she is helpless in this situation; always give her options to decide on.  She must never feel that we are doing things 'to' or 'for' her but rather that we are assisting her to make her decisions possible.  Every day that the child is out of school, that she is in the shelter without engaging in a Future Plan, that she is exposed to the Street culture - is a risk to that child - so act in extreme urgency.

<P><BR>

A youth page? Why a youth page? Well, I am a teenager and spent a lot of

time on the net trying to find a place where I can surf on a regular basis

and not get bored stiff. I have found a few nice sites, like MTV-online,

but they take forever to load, even with a 28.8 modem. So I don't get a

kick out of that anymore. Then we decided to create this Youth Page that

will entertain most teenagers like myself. You will find on this youth

page, that there is a number of things you might like, and in the future

as we get ideas from the WWW, the page might even become more and more

exciting.<BR>

<LI>Since this page has to do with youth, ACAPA offered to host this youth

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>On Top Of My Voice</H1>



<CENTER><P><I>Welcome to our tiny cyberspace</I> <BR>

So many times we hear of the sexual and physical abuse of little children

and even teenagers, but why does no-one seem to do anything about it? It

appears to be a growing problem that of child abuse, and child abuse offenders

get off lightly in South Africa and other Third-World Countries. That is

if they ever make it to court. The justice system just doesn't measure

up. When they began in the sixties with people's rights, women's lib and

anti-abortion, the one thing they looked over was children's rights. Sure,

it's written into the Laws and it's on the lips of politicians when a campaign's

to be won, but they don't venture action against this disease. Now they

are semi-aware of children's suffering, but there are things more important

to do than listen to a little snot-nosed kid complaining about her uncle

touching her! Serial killers and thieves have to be arrested. Of course

they do. But the children that are being abused today, might very well

be the next Nelson Mandela, Iman or Ghandi in 15 year's time. So how do

we go about combating the ignorance? How do we arouse people's awareness

without throwing it in their face? <BR>

<BR>

We attempt to find out and we need your thoughts, co-operation and insight

on this one. For now it looks like a long struggle ahead, trying to rid

the world of the sexual-abuse phenomenon. OTOMV aims to devote a whole

stack of energy to this war, but we need you and all your friends to help

us in this. This is one battle that OTOMV won't win alone. The more people,

the more power. Give a fellow teen some help here, hey? Enjoy the rest

of the site, and don't forget to send your stuff in for publication, we

need you here.<BR>

I could feel him and no one else-<BR>

then he touched me.<BR>

His hands are cold; I'm seven years old.<BR>

Night time will never feel the same.............Without his touch.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Morning burst through the darkness;<BR>

and I french kissed her beauty With a tear<BR>

When I saw him, I adored him-<BR>

then he kissed me.<BR>

I couldn't breath - I fell so deep.<BR>

Morning will never shine the same.............Without his kiss.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He whispers softly in my ear;<BR>

sweet secrets little girls love to hear.<BR>

And I surrendered my body.....my soul. Control was his-<BR>

When he Loved me in tides of endless pain<BR>

I wished to stop it - but I Could'nt, so he did it again.<BR>

Making love will never be the same...............Without my daddy dear.</FONT></P>

<CENTER><B>The Rich man</B></CENTER>
<CENTER>by Charlie King</CENTER><BR>
<BR>
Everyone knew him as Oom Petrus.  He was the rich man in the Klein Karoo.  In a relatively large community, he was the mayor, judge and only member of the jury, should there ever be need for one.  He wasn't a very large man.  About 5 ft 6, with a greying moustache and a balding head, he looked quite stately.  Like Bill Clinton.  Yes, and a bachelor at that.  Never been married and probably never will be.  All the old woman love him.  Whether it's for his money or his looks no-one knows.  He was the rich man.  Not that he was really rich, he just had more than most other people, charisma and some charm.  Thus he was called the rich man.  The farm-boys called him Baas Juda, which means Jew.<BR>
<BR>
As I said, people considered him stately.  But I considered him a little less than pig skin since I really didn't like the man.  My father used to be friends with Oom Petrus and Oom Petrus had the most irritating habit of playing with my left ear while he talked to my father.  So I'm obliged to visit him every two weeks, even though my father has died, because the old man is lonely and partly because I'm hoping for a place in his will.  Not too long ago, I was driving up to the farm house.  A big house, sort of Victorian, with dust-stained white walls.  Oom Petrus was indulging in a rather heavy argument with his foreman's son, Piet.  Piet has been with Oom Petrus for as long as I can remember, about 15 years.  I didn't bother too much to hear what they were saying, but they were shouting so loud...<BR>
&quot;Piet, that was all my chickens.  You know I told you every night to close the gate of the cage!  Now that fox has got all my chickens, and all my other chickens are gone!&quot;<BR>
&quot;Baas Juda, please.  I did close the gate, ask Simon.  Simon saw me close that very gate, Baas Juda.  I'm not lying, Baas, please!&quot;  Oom Petrus picked up his kierie and swung it at Piet, who got away just in time.  <BR>
<BR>
That was when I stepped in.  &quot;Hallo, Oom Petrus.&quot;  He swung around, his face red, pupils dilated and breathing heavily.  I got quite a fright, but subdued when he said, &quot;Hallo, Ropie.&quot;  Yes, I was embarrassed by my name, but everyone knew me.  Ropinus Aldri van Heerden.  Oom Petrus walked right past me onto his large front porch.  He sat down with a grunt and lit his pipe.  The one Piet made him.  He always smoked when he was upset, and he smoked furiously now.  I sat down next to him and started carving the piece of biltong I got two weeks ago.  &quot;Piet let your chickens go, Oom Petrus?&quot; I said.  He grunted and turned red.<BR>
<BR>
He was calmed down now.  Seven at night was always he's relaxing time.  He used to watch the sunset and make pathetic sketches of it.  &quot;That's beautiful Oom,&quot; I said.  I walked off, lighting the new brand of cigarette I bought today.  It didn't taste too bad, like peppermint and Tant Malie's tequila mixed together. &quot;Kleinbaas,&quot; I jumped.  It was Piet.  <BR>
&quot;Ja, Piet.  What's wrong?&quot; I asked as he was crying.  I never thought I would see such a thing.  A seventeen year old Xhosa, crying!  &quot;Kleinbaas, Baas Juda don't want me anymore.  He says he's chickens cost him money.  I didn't do it Kleinbaas I promise.  You can ask Simon.  Seventeen years Kleinbaas, I've been here with Baas Juda, and now he says he don't want me anymore.&quot;  I believed him.  I knew how unreasonable Oom Petrus could be if he wanted to.  &quot;I'll speak to him Piet,&quot; was all I could say.<BR>
<BR>
Later that night when Oom Petrus is usually at his mildest, I asked him, &quot;What are you going to do about Piet, Oom?&quot;<BR>
&quot;I'm going to take him to court, Ropie.  He's let the chickens go.  Didn't close the gate and he blames it on someone else.  By tomorrow everybody will know about this, and I will have the support of the whole Klein Karoo.  I need everyone to see that I am a fair person,&quot; he said.  I thought it very unfair and conceited of him to even consider doing that.  What can you expect from a seventeen year old boesman, that can't read or write?  As I expected, the whole of the Klein Karoo knew about this unfortunate incident the next day.  The judge of the town set a court date for the day after tomorrow, and that's when Piet would probably be set off into the wilderness of life.  The clocks in my head started ticking then, and I made a rough and ugly plan against Oom Petrus.<BR>
&quot;Ja, I heard about it.  Oom Petrus shouldn't have done that last night.  He's really making his name bad now.  The mayor of Klein Karoo.&quot;  The last bit said in a whisper.  I went to the local shop, KK Rootnniet.  Tant Malie, the one with the tequila, was speaking to Tant Ragel.  Yes, the gossip centre of the world, my father used to say.  &quot;Good day Tant Malie,&quot; I said. <BR>
&quot;Morning Ropie,&quot; she said and went back to her conversation.  I was out of town last night, on business.  Tant Malie wasn't too young.  A tight bolla on the very top of her head, holding all the grey hair together.  Those spectacles balanced so peculiarly on the tip of her nose seemed to say everything.  She was a nosy woman, and a good one at that.  The shop was cosy.  One really got the feel of a plaas-shop when you were there.  The ostrich eggs on the display table, one cracked, were full of dust and feathers.  They were talking about Oom.<BR>
&quot;What about Oom Petrus, tannie?&quot; I asked.  She looked at me and said, &quot;Promise not to tell,&quot; I nodded, &quot;Oom Petrus got drunk last night and collapsed at home and Piet helped him to the hospital.  On the donkey cart. Apparently, his heart stopped, and he still wants to go ahead with the court case against Piet.&quot;  I was angry.  I went to our local bar, if you can call it that, and had a beer. Lighting another one of those disgusting cigarettes.  I was determined to go through with my plan.<BR>
<BR>
Monday morning arrived, it was a nice morning.  The same as any other morning on Klein Karoo.  Oupa Loekie, the bartender came to me and said, &quot;Ropie, what's bothering you?&quot; <BR>
 &quot;Nothing much,&quot; I muttered while I listened to Cat Stevens on the radio.  Longer Boats was playing, and I felt like I was about to be won.  &quot;Piet really ought not to have stolen those chickens,&quot; Oupa Loekie said.  &quot;Stole them?  Piet never stole them, the gate was left open, that's all.&quot;  He just looked at me and nodded.  &quot;Finish your beer,&quot; he said and walked away.  <BR>
<BR>
So, half the town was in the makeshift courtroom that morning.  Some who didn't like Oom Petrus, and some who had their doubts.  Nobody really liked him.  He wasn't too popular with anyone, except for his money.  Oom Petrus wasn't looking too good.  His hair was untidy, and he hadn't shaved for about three days.  His nicotine stained teeth smiled as he announced the case.  Piet was looking very depressed and a lonely tear drifted down his old face again.  This had become quite a sight.  One that I was accustomed to by now.  Just before the verdict was passed, I stood up and said, &quot;Oom Petrus, uh, Your Honour, don't you think it would be more appropriate to view the evidence.  I think the jury would make a better verdict if they saw the evidence.&quot;  He said, &quot;I think the jury is convinced.&quot; And he pointed at himself.  I couldn't let it lie, and thank God neither could Tant Malie.<BR>
So, the whole courtroom was off on a dusty convoy to Oom Petrus's farm.  I was leading the way, Oom Petrus behind me, his pipe in his mouth.  He was smiling and, you believe it, so was I.  By the time we got to the farm, the people were irritated already.  I took them over to the coop and opened the door.  There was a long silence.  That's when Oom Petrus burst out laughing.  The whole coop was full of chickens.  Hens, roosters and chicks.  They were all there, and ran to the back of the coop, afraid of the people.  Oom Petrus just laughed and laughed.  He choked on his own spit, but kept laughing.  It echoed off the coop's walls and rang out across the farm.<BR>

Desperate Youth  -  1-21-97<br>
<br>
gagging<br>
and choking<br>
and grasping for air<br>
while others<br>
are hitting<br>
and screaming<br>
and ripping her hair<br>
<br>
she screams <br>
and gasps<br>
but in gurgles it drowns<br>
because the others<br>
are pushing<br>
and laughing<br>
and holding her down<br>
<br>
she's bruised<br>
and tattered<br>
and wears her crown of hate<br>
her teary eyes close<br>
she wonders<br>
why she was born<br>
if this was her fate<br>
<br>
an outstreched hand<br>
puts hope<br>
in her broken little heart<br>
she grabs the hand<br>
and all hope leaves<br>
as in her hand<br>
the other crumbles apart<br>

<CENTER><P>To start off this page we feature some of the works of Zala

Tunzi, &quot;<I>Hillbrow's most infamous of poets</I>&quot;, as Zala proudly

boasts. Zala claims to be known for producing some of the most nauseating

poetry and short stories - but, says Zala, &quot;<I>this is real life (not

a Virtual cop-out) in Africa's sin-city, Hillbrow in Johanna</I>&quot;.<BR>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Brief description of The House</H1>

<P>The House is a community welfare project aimed at bringing hope to young
people that are entrapped by the trauma of sexual abuse teenage and child
prostitution and drug addiction.<BR>
<BR>
The House operates at grassroots level and is involved in retrieving runaways
from all over the country from the various sub-cultures of vice in the
inner-city. <BR>
The House operates a number of therapeutic, preventative and educational
programmes in an attempt to alleviate the current total inadequacy of resources
for the abused children of our society. <BR>
The House provides for the basic physical, emotional and social needs of
these children, enhancing their quality of life, in line with the harm
reduction principle, without making life on the street so bearable that
motivation to rehabilitate is lost. <BR>
Financially The House is wholly reliant on donations. This is not an ideal
we necessarily approve of but it is fostered by the State, because of the
catch -22 situation created by the Tax Laws. This year will be the first
time that The House qualifies for Government funding (20%) for two of our
projects, the Hillbrow Drop-in Centre and the Intombi Shelter, the reason
for receiving funding is that only now shelters are written into the Child-care
Act, giving The House 'legal' status. <BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Aims and Objectives of The House</H3>

<P>The Aims and Objectives of The House are stated in its Constitution
and on the Fund-raising Certificate. The Aims and Objectives are: <BR>
</P>

<OL>
<LI>To remove or to assist in the removal from undesirable places and to
rehabilitate or to assist in the rehabilitation of persons under the age
of 21 years who are involved in prostitution and/or, are subject to criminal
exploitation, particularly to sexual abuse </LI>

<LI>. To give advice, assistance, shelter, guidance and direction to persons
under the age of 21 years who are involved in or exposed to the use of
drugs, undesirable influences including cult influences and negative peer
pressure or who are destitute or runaways from homes and institutions.
</LI>

<LI>To work with and assist law enforcement agencies including the South
African Police, welfare, institutions in the correctional and educational
facilities, institutions in the private sector, churches and religious
organisations in removing, rehabilitating, placing, and generally assisting
the persons referred to above. </LI>

<LI>To work actively towards combating the criminal exploitation and abuse
of such persons. </LI>

<LI>To educate or assist in the education of the public in general in matters
relating to drug abuse, juvenile prostitution and HIV/Aids by means of
the dissemination of pamphlets and other literature, and the holding of
seminars and lectures and counselling.<BR></ol>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></LI>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>History and Activities of The House</H3>

<P>The House was founded by Jean and Adele du Plessis in January '91. The
project was given its name when Jean and Adele relocated it (due to shortage
of space) from an apartment in Hillbrow to one of the few houses in the
area. The 6 children that excitedly relocated to the new premises started
a tradition in Hillbrow by referring to the facility as 'the house'. The
sub-culture continued the tradition and one year later, at the time of
applying for a fund-raising number, we had no choice but to honour the
tradition and to formally name the project - The House.<BR>
Since its inception The House has been featured many times in the national
and international media. It was The House that first made the ongoing reality
of teenage prostitution and intravenous drug addiction public. It was unfortunately
necessary to use the media to expose these atrocities since the authorities
initially refused to grant The House the right to apply for a fund-raising
number, refusing to believe our reports of the prolific abuse of children
in the under-world of vice. <BR>
In our experience one of the main causes of teenage prostitution and drug
addiction seems to be childhood sexual abuse on the one hand, and the disappearance
of the family on the other hand. Many of the children raised by this society
are potential runaways and are prime targets for exploitation. <BR>
Depravity as a social condition seems to be on the increase in South Africa
- already in '93 the Child Protection Unit reportedly recovered up to 20
child prostitutes from upmarket clubs and brothels in Hillbrow each month.
In those days the children smoked Mandrax and abused Wellconal intravenously.
Both those drugs are central nervous system depressants and rendered their
victims calm, lethargic and emotional. We found counselling and therapy
to be difficult under those circumstances and were concerned that so many
of the children we worked with died of drug overdoses before we could help
them (an average of 30 per year). <BR>
More recently the drug scene on the streets changed with the onset of the
New South Africa. A flood of Nigerian and Iranian drug dealers came to
set up shop in Hillbrow - they brought with them cocaine and heroin. Within
a few months our children were taught how to cook their own crack (bicarbonate
of soda mixed with cocaine and melted over heat). Crack addiction took
our children by storm. In the past the phenomenon of teenage &quot;drug-whores&quot;,
used to be a White problem - crack changed this over night. A flood of
young Black girls joined the ranks of the (what came to be termed in the
vulgar language of the street) &quot;coke-whores&quot;. We are still reeling
under the massive effect of this new drug and are frantically trying to
learn from other countries who are more experienced in dealing with this
chemical. The effects of this drug is particularly dangerous for the South
African youth. We are of the opinion that our youth are more susceptible
and at greater risk than children of most other countries. The factors
that come into play in this issue are complex and numerous - and whilst
we theorise about the situation we are aware of rapid increases in the
numbers of children getting trapped and murdered because of this drug.
Our main concern is the fact that crack-cocaine was the one factor that
almost quadrupled America's population of child prostitutes (correspondence
with Dr. fee: Children of the Night, Hollywood). <BR>
In order to cope with the severe therapeutic and rehabilitation demands
of the syndrome we work The House had to seek and employ unconventional
methods. The TOTAL lack of resources for these children and the blatant
unwillingness of the policing authorities to individual and organised operators
makes The House's task even more difficult and after five years, we have
reached the stage where we are creating therapeutic resources for these
children. Although some organisations in Durban and Cape Town are starting
(with our guidance and assistance) to address the problem of child prostitution
in those cities, we are however concerned because we know that the numbers
are on the increase and are far too many to be accommodated by our efforts.
<BR>
Now, in the dawn of our expansion to tackle the problem, we face the fact
that funding from the private sector is being redirected to government
and bureaucratic central organisations that are supposed to distribute
these funds. The flood of stories about fraud and alleged fraud that hamper
these organisations causes much concern. <BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Management of The House</H3>

<P>According to law The House is to be managed by a Management Committee,
to be elected annually by the members. Membership is open to all members
of the public on the condition they abide by the constitution. Since the
inception of The House we have appealed to the public to get involved as
members and volunteers. Given the democratic nature of the organisation
it so happens that active volunteers who become prominent members are elected
to the Management Committee. The Annual General Meeting of The House is
held each year in September. <BR>
<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>List of achievements in the past 3 years.</H3>

<P>The House was founded in '91 and have grown into the managing body of
the group of projects listed below. See the above Brief Description, Aims
and Objectives and the History and Activities of The House as well as the
Statistics of some of the activities at The House.<BR>
<BR>

<H3>Hillbrow Drop-in Centre</H3>

<P><BR>
To retrieve female children from the streets, particularly from the sub-cultures
of vice in the Johannesburg area. For those children who visit the Drop-in
Centre the capacity to choose alternative options are offered by means
of providing life skills training, counselling, etc. The property, 60 Olivia
rd, has been bought during November of '94, and is bonded by United Bank
for R100 000.<BR>

<center><h3>Personnel Structure of The House</h3></center>
The  two  programmes of  The House,  the Drop-In  Centre and  the
Shelter, are geographically located in  the heart  of the  murder
capital of the  world and  the children  it serves  have been  so
conditioned to survive the  most treacherous  of sub-cultures  in
this country. Our staff work amidst the dynamics  of the  illicit
drug and sex trade and we lose about thirty children per year  to
murders  and  drug  related  deaths. Our  premises are  regularly
burgled; our cars are being stolen and burgled, and we deal  with
occasional threats from  pimps and  prostitution networks.  Other
aspects that add tremendous stress to workers is the mind-set  of
the crack cocaine abuser and the manic  environment these  people
create, as  well as  the sexually  deviant work  our clients  are
involved in, cry about, and die about.<br>
<br>
It is for these reasons that all our staff must  not live-in  and
must  be:  of the  highest possible  calibre; exceptionally  well
trained; well monitored; in counselling; paid well enough not  to
have undue financial worries.  Even volunteer workers involved in
these  programmes attend  an eight-month  counselling course  and
must  receive regular  counselling and  therapeutic attention  in
order to survive.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Acapa is being created in response to the problem of the
acute lack of information with regards to children's issues in Africa.
<BR>
<BR>
Africa is one of those areas where malaria, TB, starvation and malnutrition
kills thousands of people each year, due to a lack of information and unequal
distribution of resources.<BR>
<BR>
Insofar as social diseases have it, Africa is not spared that shame. Besides
allowing her young ones to die due to the ignorance of the elders, this
ancient continent also allows her young to be exploited and abused by the
Powerful in the community.<BR>
<BR>
The incidence of destitute children, sexual abuse of children and neglected
children is rising in an unprecedented manner in Africa.<BR>
<BR>
This service hopes to break the silence that used to veil Africa's shame.

A roof, walls and wooden floors<BR>
When seen, an ordinary house in the midst of Hillbrow<BR>

A place where pain has no defenition<BR>
Where sou confusion somehow eases<BR>
One person's atrocity becomes her salvation and therapy<BR>
<BR>
Where everybody makes a great effort to be buoyant<BR>
And control ther rage to be sure not to provoke someone elses hapiness<BR>
<BR>
Where would you find such a peacefull place in the midst of hell<BR>
To calm the waves of our sinful society<BR>
And although the pain sufaces like a sidewinder in a desert<BR>
we know we can look it straight in the face<BR>
<BR>
Cause here we have received valuable life tools and we<BR>
 use them with pride and great victory<BR>
<BR>
Thanks to the people who made it possible that we can <BR>
call an ordinarry house     our home.<BR>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Use is made of group interaction and the sessions are largely experimental with the lifestyle being seen as a facilitator rather than a teacher.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">HIGH RISK CHILD</H2>
</CENTER>Children who find themselves in dysfunctional family e.g. where any chemical substance is abused are prone to present certain behavior patterns and to fulfill different roles within the family e.g. the hero, the scapegoat, the mascot, the placater and the loner. They are not necessarily problem children, bur are children with    emotional problems. The high risk child has 3 basic survival rules, mainly don't talk, don't trust, don't feel and this results in inadequate coping skills regarding social functioning in life.
<P>Due to the above mentioned Western Transvaal Sanpark Psychosocial Health Centre identified the need to develop the insight of the High Risk Child to understand his\her behaviour within the family. West Rand Clinic provides a camp with the opportunity for these children to identify and share their feelings and different roles within group sessions, and to equip themselves with the necessary skills to understand themselves and to cope within the family.</P>
<P>The camp also creates the opportunity for the children to rediscover the fun and carefreeness of childhood.<BR>
The duration of the camp is 5 days.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Programme for a Healthy Alternative Lifestyle</H3>
</CENTER>PALS is a primary school based prevention programme consisting of eighteen sessions involving activities, worksheets and minimal didactic input. The prevention programme utilises the &quot;social influences&quot; approach to guide it's focus, contact and manner. The sessions include basic information concerning medicine, alcohol, cigarettes, mandrax and dagga; social pressure; coping with change and self awareness. At present SANCA staff members are implementing the sessions in schools as a means of evaluating its effectiveness. The long-term goal is to train teachers to utilize the material within their various school settings.
<P>The PALS programme was developed after a needs assessment was undertaken by which schools and teachers indicated interest and willingness to participate. Research indicates that the standard 4 and 5 age group is a prime target in terms of being more easily influenced and a high threat.</P>

<BODY>
<H1><CENTER>Credo Trust</CENTER></H1>
<P>Credo provides social support to orphans aged 0-18 years of age. Particularly those who are <A HREF="r0033.htm">AIDS related. (to NGO)</A>It also supports AIDS related aged people.<BR>
The support is that which is basically essential, available, universally accessible and affordable.</P><BR>

<P>Credo which is acronymous to "Charitable REaction for AgeD & Orphans" was founded in 1994 and subsequently registered in Nov 1995 as Trust fund NGO. It was started by five members who work as volunteers to carry out its objectives.</P><BR>

<H3><CENTER>Problems addressed</CENTER></H3>
Major problem being addressed to is lack oF affordable social services to Aids orphans and Aged people.<BR>
No financial aid is received from the Government, neither have secured one from donor agencies.<BR>
Areas needing attention are, food, clothing, shelter and education together with vocational training.<BR>
Assistance mostly needed currently is financial, so as to have a well established office and pay allowances to volunteers etc.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>Information needed</CENTER></H3>
Credo requires chances to train it's staff in various social fields e.g. counselling, social work, medical, surgical specialities with emphasis on ophthalmology and nutrition.<BR>
Credo would be glad to receive any assistance be it small or big, to us, it is valuable. NB. Credo still operates in an individual private house and on voluntary basis, hence something should be done by gathering efforts from friends all over the world to assist it to establish it's own office and permanent staff.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>How many</CENTER></H3>

<h2><center>Leonenet Street Children Project</center></h2><br>
We are a non-profit, non-stock U.S. Corporation  formed to raise funds
to help rehabilitate homeless and orphaned Sierra Leone children.
We will help as many children as there are available funds.<br>
We need help in locating donors who will help us acquire, build, and
use a foster-home for up to eight children. It will also serve as
our headquarters. We intend to become advocates for children.<br>
We are just beginning to fund total rehabilitative care for street
children who became orphaned and homeless on account of a five year
brutal war. We provide food, shelter,schooling etc for one full year<br><br>

The idea around Childfind is to set up a Web database that will carry information about missing children in Africa.  Although the idea has been in planning for about two years it is not ready to go live as yet.  The only hamper in this process is a lack of funds.

<H3>'Sick...'</H3>

<H3>...Inside the heart of a rapist</H3>
</CENTER>
<CENTER> by</CENTER>
<CENTER>Zala Tunzi</CENTER><BR>
<BR>
As I sit here I am supposed to be sick ... paedophilia society calls it.  Or ... No, I am supposed to be OK now.  I am not sick anymore.  Three years of therapy in various prisons.  They moved me from one to the other.  My fellow inmates ... they also condemned me for the label, in fact Statutory Rape was my offence.  So I was grouped with the rapists and paedophiles in therapy.  Jimmy, he raped and beat his grandmother.  Gert mutilated a baby girl;  Paulo raped a girl in a parking lot and left her to bleed to death;  I was with them and others of '<I>our</I>' kind.  Made life unbearable for me, it made me feel I was one of them;  as if I too am potentially murderous and I too am a danger to society and my grandmother is not safe from the demon in me.  And still today four years after prison I still pay for my sin.  My family, my church and each employer that eventually finds out about my sin, kick me out, ostracise me, make me pay all again.  Thirty-two years old;  three years in jail;  three years in therapy - painfully over and over again and again I had to sit in group and say, <I>'I am a paedophile, I am guilty of statutory rape, I violated young girls, far too young to have been exposed to the evil I imposed on them ... they were all about 14 years old.  I am sorry for what I did and I acknowledge that I am sick and need help.'</I>  So they gave me help, three years of agonising help.  I am supposed to be OK now.  But am I?  Or is there a monster loose somewhere?<BR>
<BR>
Saturday night.  I sit alone here watching television on a small black-and-white screen in my room in Hillbrow.  Since I always lose my jobs due to my past sin, things are not that easy you know.  It's about all I have to keep my thoughts from perpetuating the pain society inflicts on me for being sick, as they put it.  And tonight on TV they parade the new models of the year at a great gala event in glamorous <I>Oscar Award</I> style at Sun City.  And here my sick mind goes again.  You know, I must be very sick.  Those young girls, all of them about 14 years old, they actually look mature to me.  I actually find some of them sexy.  Not that I want to leap at them or anything, or that I sit here masturbating or drooling - but since three years of therapy made me mindful of the sin I carry like a cancerous soul I am very aware of these things.  By next month these young girls will honour the front pages of every magazine in the country.  How will it affect me and all those of my 'kind'?  So many times has it happened at work and in the streets that a colleague  will casually remark, <I>'check it out ... Now that is what I call hot'</I>, I check it out, and jerk my neck back to sanity - <I>'She's only a kid man, dammit;  How's your mind?'</I>  Then the stock phrase they all use <I>'Oh, I'm not superstitious'</I>, they smile.  Or pictures in fashion magazines, or a group of kids in front of teenybopper night-clubs, colleagues and friends do not fail to notice the sexual readiness and their own willingness to get into one of these kids.  Damn, and I am the one that is sick.  Or is it that I was one that got caught?  <BR>
<BR>
Suddenly now the dilemma hits me.  I wonder.  How can it be illegal and sinful to have mutually consenting sexual intercourse with one of those girls if society parades them as the epitome of womanhood.  Parades them on TV and magazines as the most desirable female bodies in South Africa.  Parades them as exemplary of femininity - a look and quality all woman should strive to achieve and uphold.  They now constitute the new examples of which physical look is 'in'.  The 'in' thing for a man to be seen with on his side.  These young teenagers are being sold as women, as examples of what the nation finds desirable and what we expect our women to be like.  And what about the women?  How do they compete with the look?  How do they transform themselves to look 14 years old?  Perhaps they diet;  perhaps they shave their pubic hair, have facelifts and boob jobs.  It must be so difficult for them to compete.<BR>
<BR>
Hell, can it be that society and the media are plotting to create a nation of paedophiles.  Can it be that the media and the fashion people are advocating the desirability of prepubescent sexuality.  You know ... hardly developed little breasts and underdeveloped pubic hair and that innocent look.  What the hell is going on here?  And now ... come to think of it.  What the bloody hell did I go to jail for.  For having mutually consenting sex with girls that society upholds as the ideal in female sexuality?  Who is sick?  I ask you.  Who the hell is the sick party here?  Or is it the parents of our society?  They are also guilty.  They want their 12 year olds' to parade in grown-up clothes for the nation to yearn after - for the guys in the army and in jail to stick on their lockers, to play lustful mind-games at night.<BR>
<BR>
I'll tell you who are sick.  I did wrong and I had to be punished, that is right.  But I am not sick.  Society is sick.  Bloody sick at that.  I know now that girls of 12 and 14 are not supposed to have sexual relations with guys older than themselves, preferably not have sex at all until they are grown up.  But sick society is selling her children off.  She is selling her children as they do at slave markets and prostitute beats.  She dresses them up - makeup and grownup clothing, then parade them in the media and on the catwalk.  She gets everybody fired up desiring the juvenile looks and bodies these children display - then everybody rushes out to buy the creams, lotions and adornments that can make them share in this youthful innocence they desire.  And the guys, what do they do?  They desire, that is what they do.  Is this one of the reasons why teenage prostitution is on the increase?  Is this the reason we too will one day drop the age of consent to what, 13 perhaps, the way Holland did last year?<BR>
What we need now is for Mevrou Kaptein Pienaar the social worker at Pretoria Central Prison to get society in for therapy. <I>'You must be able to find it within yourself to confess your disease, you see, it is essential to the healing process.  Confess...yes.  Come, repeat after me and you will see, how better you will feel.  Come now Mr and Mrs Public, repeat after me, - say, 'I am so sick.  I am so extremely ill.  I am out of control.  I put my little girls on parade at the harlot market...I need help from above.  God help me</I>...'<BR>
You know ... hardly developed little breasts and underdeveloped pubic hair and that innocent look ... something in my pants tell me I'm as sick as most of you out there.<BR>

<H1><I>Bobby</I></H1>
</CENTER>
<CENTER><B>The definitive article on mainline addiction in South Africa</B>.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER><B>From the related experience of South Africas foremost specialists in this field,  Jean and Adele du Plessis, founders of The House - who have been working with young people, addicts and pushers on the streets of Hillbrow since 1991; and have known more than a hundred junky youngsters die from drug-abuse related causes.</B></CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>by</CENTER> <CENTER>Zala Tunzi</CENTER><BR>
<P>
Bobby's pimp is typical, a weakling to the core and afflicted with soul septicaemia.  Humanly despicable, not loved by his mother or any other human for that matter.  A being that found Bobby as a runaway in a club when she was 14, showed her a good time and Wellconal, turned her into an addict within two weeks and has been pimping her for the last 3 years.  A being who would cut Bobby's vagina with his flick-knife when she brings home too little money.  He controls her hurting little mind by telling her that God counts every time she has sex with a man.  &quot;More than 2500 prostitution fucks you had in three years.  Do you know that?  Do you think you have any chance with God?  Not on your life!&quot;--that's his usual trick.  Fact is he's impotent.  Wellconal junkies cannot get it up.  They have no sexual electricity in their lower abdomens.  I think he feels inferior, and I can name many reasons why he should.  And I think that is one of the reasons he continues to remind Bobby that her grandfather was a deacon in the church when he sexually abused her.  Despite his shortcomings on the moral, ethical and hygiene levels of life, Shane is an excellent manipulator of young girls.  Bobby is his third.  He buried the first one and was too<I> gerook</I> to remember the paupers' cremation for the second one.  Shane was losing his touch though.  Much of his pluck was out and his con's became weaker and more pathetic.     <BR>
	Once he phoned us at about two in the morning. <I> 'Bobby is in trouble'</I>, he said and put her on the phone.  She was crying, <I>'Jean, please help me.  Shane is going to kill me.'</I>  A silence followed and I let it.  We've had similar calls before and I could usually learn a lot from the sounds in the background.  But there was nothing there that indicated anything useful.  <I>'Jean please he's hurting me, he says he's going to cut my throat.'</I><BR>
<I>'Where is he?'</I><BR>
<I>'He ... he's here.  He's holding that big knife on my throat.'</I><BR>
<I>'So why phone me about it Bobby?'</I>, I asked playing for more time and trying to sound nonchalant.  <I>'He wants you to bring him fifty bucks.' </I> She said.  Then she started crying and moaning louder, explaining how she hid two <I>Pinks</I> and had a shot and did not share with him.  He wanted his share, and he wanted me to take it to him.<BR>
<I>'Why me?  Why not one of your regular steamers?'</I><BR>
<I>'He says you guys pretend to care.  Please, he's hurting me.'</I><BR>
I had to do something drastic.  They had me in a fix.  I decided to call his bluff if he still had one<I>.  'Bobby, can that gutless snotball hear all this, is he sitting close to the phone?</I><BR>
<I>'Y.. Yes.'</I><BR>
I realised that if Shane succeeded in pressurising us into this situation, he would not stop but would use it again and one day things may get out of hand.  I had my doubts about his abilities to play Russian roulette.  I quickly shot up a prayer for wisdom, but did not wait for it to find me.<BR>
<I>'Bobby'</I><BR>
<I>'Yes.'</I>  she said through the tears.<BR>
<I>'Put the phone against Snotball's ear I'd like to talk to him.'</I><BR>
I heard a shuffling as the receiver was handled and a heavy breathing became audible.  I could almost smell his three day old breath.  Oh how I disliked the man at times like those.  I laid it on him proper.  <I>'Shane buddy.  This is getting really exiting.  I like your mind man.  Remember I was telling you about my working in the Satanic cult?  Well, they used to do things like this...but for real.  Now since then I found that I get off on this kind of pluck.  Do me a favour, hold the phone so I can hear when you cut.  The sound of the blood gargling and frothing pink foam is just way out man...'</I>  The phone went dead.<BR>
Ad&#233;le was standing next to me, her eyes as big as ping-pong balls.  She gaped at me in disbelief.  I couldn't look at her.  I was ashamed of myself for hating the man with such a passion, and major ambivalence set into my conscience.  There would be no way to know what the outcome was until she showed up again, if she did.  I firmly believed that Shane was too gutless to do such a thing, but nevertheless I lay awake the next couple of hours praying and waiting for the birds to cough the morning in.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Two days later Bobby spiritedly walked into the house looking good and healthy -- and whole throatedly.  She laughed herself to tears as she explained Shane's reaction that morning.  She said he went berserk, he cut the phone wire up into small pieces, he screamed like a &quot;wounded ape&quot; as loud as he could and then he proceeded cutting himself up.  Bobby ran to the caretaker, he summoned the cops, who summoned the paramedics who darted Shane with a tranquilliser.  He was still in hospital for observation then. <BR>
	He was such a pathetic creature that Shane.  In the beginning he used to come to The House frequently.  He would show everyone how thin he was and how his sores were going septic.  He always told how many days ago he last went to the toilet; how Bobby does not feed him; and how she stays out with steamers and shoots up the whole night and he has to wait for her to return with a measly two <I>Pinks</I> for him.  Shane truly succeeded well in nauseating people, especially when he jacks his pants down to show how his prick was rotting away from shooting into his last available vein -- the thick one down there.<BR>
<BR>
Then one afternoon he rushed into The House in a scare.  He was over the top and didn't make proper sense.  His voice was hoarse and his eyes big and wild, 'You're Christians, only you can help her, only you can help her', over and over he repeated himself.  It turned out that Bobby was going crazy in their hotel room a bloc away from us.  He was scared and he deliriumed all over me about demonic influences, about minds that have gone and evil spirits.  He didn't want to go with us and told me the address.  Ad&#233;le grabbed the key from him and we ran up there to see what Bobby was up to.  Not before leaving strict instructions for Shane to be watched over.  He would rip us off blind given half a chance.  <BR>
<BR>
We suspected they had shot a combination of chemicals that did not work out.  Those instances were the worst.  We witnessed one kid losing it totally from mixing Ativan and Seconal, she went crazy and we've never heard whether she had made it past the initial mental observation in Sterkfontein or not.  Another girl shot Acid dissolved in Roheponal water -- she never even removed the needle from her groin.  Her mind handed over to The Wonderful World of Disney -- permanently, for ever.<BR>
 <BR>
Shane had locked Bobby in the room.  We used the key and entered without knocking, not wanting to trigger any responses.  Bobby was lying on the floor in the bathroom -- naked but for a dirty G-string and smeared in blood, looking lifeless.  I immediately thought she had been beaten-up by Shane.  I feared the worst, not knowing that we were about to see Bobby enter hell -- here on earth.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When I touched Bobby she slowly turned her face toward me.  She looked wild, her eyes large, protruding and bloodshot.  There was blood on her face and breasts.    Ad&#233;le took a towel and started wiping her face.  Bobby smiled a sardonic kind of sick smile at me and said with a haughty voice <I>'You came for me..., where's my vein?'</I>  Only as she sat up did I see the needle marks --  all-over her body.  Ad&#233;le talked to her but she kept staring at me.  Then she demanded, sinews and muscle showing in her neck, <I>'So you came ... Now where's my fucking vein!'</I> and she flipped.  She jumped up to the mirror, grabbed a bloodied syringe I hadn't seen from the basin and made for her neck -- looking at me in the mirror.  Why me?   She demanded again, <I>'Now!  My vein, you came for me!  Give me my fuckinig vein!'</I>  <BR>
Ad&#233;le spoke to her saying our names over and over, <I>'It's us Bobby, Jean and Ad&#233;le from The House, it's Jean and Ad&#233;le, .....'</I>  Eventually the realisation hit her and she started crying.  <I>'I</I> <I>didn't want you!'</I>  She screamed like a spoiled brat, <I>'I want my vein.  I want my veins... he will give me my veins, I want him!'</I>  She cried in desperation and pounded the basin looking into the bathroom mirror.  We were confused.  <BR>
<BR>
<I>'Who do you want Bobby?  Who?'</I> Ad&#233;le persisted.  <BR>
By that time I knew something was very wrong with her mind.  It wasn't a drug and it wasn't a beating from her pimp, but something very strange was going on.<BR>
<I>'Him!  The devil.  I want him.  I made a deal...  He's cheating me Adele.  He took my soul now he doesn't want to give my veins back.  He rapes me.  You Fucking Cunt I Hate You...Hate you...hate you....!'</I>  <BR>
We gathered that she couldn't 'find herself'.  She had been complaining for months that she had problems finding a vein.  At last count even her jugular was eluding her onslaughts and she had started on the small veins under the armpit and under her toe nails.  She had ugly bruise marks in all those places where she tried to find a small vein from time to time.  Somehow she had come to the conclusion that the devil was the one who could return her veins to her.  I was intrigued by her thinking and wondered where it originated.  <BR>
	Bobby stood up again and took the dirty syringe.  It was way beyond usable.  The long thick needle clogged up with coagulated blood would not work even if she did find a vein.  She looked at herself in the blood streaked mirror, stroked her neck, and at the raw patch where she must have tried many times before, she inserted the needle into her neck.  The needle grinded in and two centimetres of it disappeared.  Both Ad&#233;le and I cringed and wanted to stop her.  But she was the expert and was not in a state to be reasoned with.  When the needle had gone in for about two centimetres she lifted her hand and forced the angle downwards and shoved the needle in all the way.  The plastic tip of the back of the four centimetre long needle indented her skin making a white circle around the bloodied patch.  She started pulling on the plunger, repeatedly.  No blood came into the syringe and it jumped back each time.  <I>'You see ...', she looked at Ad&#233;le, 'no fucking vein'.</I>  <BR>
	Bobby pulled the <I>spick</I> out and looked at it crying and shaking.  Suddenly she turned it on herself and started jabbing at her chest.  The needle sinking in to the hilt and coming out more and more bent each time, she roared and cried from deep inside herself.  Jabbing and sobbing.  Repeatedly, all-over her body and boobs the stab marks appeared.  I grabbed Ad&#233;le, took her out of the bathroom and closed the door.  I had enough, it was all just too much to handle and I thought that she could be a danger to us.  HIV was always to be considered.  One had to be calculated and careful when working in someone else's blood, and Bobby was drenched in it.  She sobbed in the bathroom 'My God, oh my God, give me my vein'.  My head spun, I was about to be sick.  Ad&#233;le was trembling and pale.  She looked like a little girl that had lost her dearest possession. <BR>
<BR>
I thought about knocking Bobby out with a punch;  the way they do it in the movies.  But I distrusted movie-reality.  We had come to learn that real life is far too weird to be screened or printed.  I figured Bobby's jaw would break if I had to hit her.  They only weigh about 40kg these girls and are not healthy at all.  But there again, they withstand the punishment of multiple steamers' onslaughts every day.  But those were mostly phallic attacks?  I discarded the idea and phoned The House.  I asked them to get the paramedics in -- knowingly risking the usual arrival of the cops before the medical people get there. <BR>
	Bobby's sobs sounded in my soul.  Ad&#233;le was sitting in a chair, tears streaming down her face, holding her hands to her mouth.  Hillbrow was hammering us and I knew it was too much, we were cracking up and becoming less and less effective.  Ruan was showing the strain even more severely.  He was far too young for it -- or can anyone ever be old enough for this!  I wanted to run away.  I wanted to remove my wife from the hurt and the wholesale ravishing of all the young lives.  We had lost 23 youngsters to terrible and lonely deaths at that stage already.  Everything was more than we were prepared for and it was becoming more than I was about to take.<BR>
	Bobby's cries subsided into whimpers after a while.  She was repeating <I>'My God, My God'</I> over and over.  We held one another a while.  Silently.  No words would have any meaning, nether to console or to describe how broken up we are inside.  It's hell to live in hell, and each one of us has a personal battle to survive.  We entered the bathroom again.  Ad&#233;le talked softly, holding and comforting Bobby.  We wiped her with a cold towel, cleaned her up a bit and walked her to the bed.  Ad&#233;le started dressing her in some of the cleaner dirty clothing lying around the room and getting things together for hospital.  I decided to have her admitted for psychiatric observation in some way or another.  We would need some statements of people suggesting that Bobby is out of control and is a danger to society.  Ad&#233;le found Bobby's moonbag under the bed and was about to ask whether she wanted to take it with her to hospital, when Bobby suddenly sat up and snatched it from her.  She opened the bag, stuck her fingers inside and found two Wellconal tablets.  She opened another zip and fumbled out a clean syringe.  I walked over and was about to take the stuff from her -- she saw my movement coming and clutched it to her chest, looked me in the eyes and screamed on top of her voice.  Her mind had gone.  I was terrified we would lose her totally.  I indicated to Ad&#233;le and she talked softly in Bobby's ear, holding her.  Bobby had the fear of hell written all over her face and it took much talking to calm her down.  She was still sobbing and heaving when she put the two tablets in the syringe and stumbled to the bathroom, heaving hoarsely like a wronged child.  She poured water into the plunger, held it between two fingers and shook the lot up, dissolving the tablets.<BR>
	Ad&#233;le pleaded with her not to try and shoot again, but she flew off at Ad&#233;le, a very nasty look on her face pulling her mouth ugly.  <I>'Don't you tell me what to do.  It's because of you fucking Christians that my veins are gone.  I know all about it.  Don't you try and con me and don't stand there with your little holy shit-face as if you don't know.'</I><BR>
	I intervened with shock tactic, it is needed when they get lulled into believing that religious people must be walked over -- usually their last resort.  <I>'What do you know you little bitch,'</I>  I said in a tone of voice ten decibels louder than my usual reserved calm.  <I>'You're too fucking stupid to find your own vein, and to know when you've had your innings and when to stop!  What's your buzz, trying to die in this shit-hole?'</I><BR>
	She swung around and spat her words at me <I>'Don't you think I know?  Shane told me all about how you pray for us addicts to lose our veins.  It's you Christians, I know.  God has taken my fucking veins away but I know the devil will give it back to me.  I gave him my soul and he will give my veins back to me.'</I><BR>
	She had the new needle on the syringe and was looking at it.  Ad&#233;le stepped closer, held her hand out and said <I>'Come, let me shoot you.  Tell me where and I'll help you.'</I><BR>
	I thought my woman had gone crazy too and was about to protest when I figured that she was playing for time, the paramedics were on their way and Ad&#233;le could perhaps get hold of the syringe as well.  To my surprise Bobby took her up on the offer.  She indicated that she wants to shoot in the neck again and suggested she should lie down on the carpet.  Ad&#233;le looked at me and shrugged, as if asking &quot;Now what must I do?&quot; <BR>
 	Bobby took a small mirror from her moonbag and gave it to Ad&#233;le.  She lay down flat on her back and told Ad&#233;le to hold the mirror so that she could see what she was doing.  She seemed much more adept in that position and I thought we should let her have a go and hope she succeeds.  She would be totally mellow after the shot and we would be able to work with her, talking her to hospital.<BR>
	Bobby sought out the collarbone, then the little bump it makes right next to her oesophagus, checked it in the mirror and inserted the needle halfway -- changed angle and went in all the way.  She pulled on the plunger seeking blood, removed the needle a little, and in again.  Pulled, and slowly the level of the fluid rose in the syringe, going from pink to red, to Bright Red!?  I shouted  <I>'Don't Bobby, that's pink blood.  Stop, can't you see?'</I>  She squinted her eyes to take a better look, it registered and she dropped her head back.  Her eyes closed, and she wanted to start crying again.  All addicts fear and respect pink blood. The blood from a vein has a darker colour than the bright red oxygenated blood in the arteries.  They call arterial blood &quot;pink blood&quot; and every one knows to avoid shooting in it.  Veins pipe the blood back from the organ or muscle, to the heart and the lungs to be re-oxygenated.  Arteries pipe the blood from the heart to the organs.  If one would inject the shot into the pink blood, a chemical reaction is caused and it burns the next organ.  The pain is excruciating and cannot be stopped until the chemical has worn itself off or is diluted enough after some time.  We have seen kids lose muscles in this manner.  A whole muscle will burn away inside the body -- amid severe trauma.  One hardly ever regain such a damaged muscle or organ.<BR>
	She was crying.  She looked extremely tired.  This battle she was having to find a vein must have lasted at least for the past three hours.  My hope was on the paramedics and their medications.  <I>'Skip it Bobby.'  </I>I said  <I>'Try again, come on.  Bobby, come on listen to me.  Take it out!'</I><BR>
She didn't.  Her body tensed and her knuckles whitened, pressing, and she injected about half of the dosage before I could react.  I really did not believe that she would do that.    This time the organ Bobby fed with the burning chemical was her brain. <BR>
	I grabbed her hand and pulled.  She squirted blood and <I>Pinks</I> onto Ad&#233;le.  Bobby went rigid and screamed, her eyes like saucers, mouth wide open.  She gripped her head on both sides and screamed in terror while a hell fire burned in her brains.   <BR>
	Bobby's screaming attracted continued hammering on the door.  A small crowd was gathering in the passage.  I was in tears.  Ad&#233;le cracked up, sitting flat on the floor shaking and crying in her hands.  The people hammered on the door.  I phoned the hotel reception to tell them to ring me when the paramedics arrive.  I knew we could not afford to have Hillbrow flow into the room and gawk at the mess.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The paramedics gave Bobby a massive shot of Valium and wanted to put a drip in her.  I explained through my tears and Bobby's screaming that she was an addict and that they would not find a vein.  I just wanted them to remove the girl from there and from Ad&#233;le and myself.  Her screams were ripping my very insides out.  Bobby was rolling her head from side to side, her eyes large and shock written in laser beam lines around her pupils.  <BR>
	She was strapped to a stretcher when they eventually took her away amidst the inquisitive crowding of the hotel lodgers.  As they picked Bobby onto the gurney, I was about to help them when I froze.  I grabbed Ad&#233;le's hand and directed her to look at Bobby's face.  She was crying with only half her face -- the left side was not moving.  Her mouth twisted downwards on the left side, the eye lifeless and droopy -- paralysed.<BR>
	When they had left, the manager of the hotel chased the people out of the room.  As he pulled the door closed behind him he looked back at  Ad&#233;le and myself sitting on the floor, broken and blood smeared -- and in absolute contempt for us he spat, 'Fucking drug addicts', and slammed the door.  <BR>
