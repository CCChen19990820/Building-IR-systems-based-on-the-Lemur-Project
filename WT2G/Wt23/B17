Mars weighs in some 5 times heavier than the Moon, giving it more gravity [3/8ths vs. 1/6th Earth-standard] and hence a bigger/wider/deeper gravity well. This means it will "catch" more asteroidal and cometary debris, and impose on it higher velocities of acceleration prior to impact.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mars' tenuous atmosphere will burn up the micrometeorite stuff, so that the Martian surface is not subject to the steady "rain" that the lunar surface undergoes. It would follow that the dust on Mars comes from weathering, rather than impact "gardening". But the larger stuff will not be stopped and much will get through that incinerates in Earth's much thicker atmosphere.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Mars is much closer to the main asteroid belt and probably is exposed to a thicker concentration of debris than is the Earth-Moon system.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not be misled by visual and photographic comparisons of the Martian and Lunar surfaces at various resolutions. Unlike the Moon,  Mars experiences real weather (wind, and scattered freeze-thaw cycles) and formerly underwent major episodes of volcanic activity. This gives its surface a deceptively younger, less impact-scarred look.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to scare anyone away. The heavy lunar bombardment we see happened mostly more than 3 eons [3 billion years] ago, and danger to pioneers will be less than us terrestrials face in volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, lightning, avalanches, landslides and other catastrophes from Earth's active geology and weather systems. The same should be true on Mars.</P><P> - Thomas Heidel, Milwaukee, Wisconsin</P><P>EDITOR: Thanks Tom. You have summed up the situation accurately.</P><H3 align=center>Why the boxes and bars filled with random dots?</H3><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, you have been closing articles [on the printed version of MMM] written by you with "MMM" in a box filled with random dots. This same kind of dot-filled box has appeared as bars in the masthead, and now bars in the footers at the bottom of each page, as well as in the "state" bars preceding the various chapters in the chapter news section. What is the symbolism here?<P> - Simon Cook, Phoenix, Arizona</P><P>EDITOR: The symbolism, I had hoped, would be clear. The random dots stand for "regolith", that is the lunar (and asteroidal, and Martian) soil composed of fine and coarser particles of rock and glass. This inorganic soil covers these worlds with a blanket inches to meters thick and consists mostly of bombardment debris and meteoritic material. In the case of Mars, regolith also includes wind-deposited products of weathering. For me, the regolith is the very quintessence of the frontier, its mineral makeup posing early limits to what pioneers can do by way of self-reliance and "living off the land", and setting the scope of the challenge for frontier settlements. I should have made this clear at the outset.</P><font size=2><a href="index.html" target="_top">Back to MMM #93</a></font>&nbsp;<a href="nss-fax-tree.html">&lt;-</a>&nbsp;<a href="rtg-told-you-so.html">-&gt;</a></BODY></HTML>

Pro-space groups, including the National Space Society and its Metro Orlando Space Society chapter, opposed these efforts, as they have in the case of more recent missions such as Ulysses and Cassini. NSS appeared as a friend of the court in litigation over Ulysses, and has successfully forced NASA to discuss the environmental benefits of the Cassini mission as part of the Environmental Impact Statement process for that mission. But the spotlight is on Galileo today.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"We were told that the launch of these probes would be dangerous and would produce little scientific value," notes NSS Executive Director Lori Garver.  "The results here speak for themselves."</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most absurd claim" of the Galileo opponents, notes Glenn Reynolds, member of the NSS Board of Directors, "was that the RTGs would 'make Jupiter radioactive,' -- when, as everyone knew all along, and as Galileo has reminded us, Jupiter already was radioactive."</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it unfair to bring this up now?  No, says Reynolds.  "If Galileo had produced a disaster, its opponents would be saying 'we told you so.'  But since their overblown fears turned out to be wrong -- just as we said at the time -- it's our turn."</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, both Reynolds and Garver note, the Galileo probe has produced a torrent of information about what the Giant Planet is really like. Such knowledge enriches our understanding of the Solar System and, quite possibly, of many processes on Earth.  "Most of our terrestrial climate models -- including those used to study the greenhouse effect and other environmental problems -- are descendants of models originally developed to study the climate of Mars," notes Garver.  "Who knows what benefits will come from learning more about Jupiter?" "Like its namesake," Reynolds notes, "Galileo was attacked by the ignorant.  And like its namesake, it has been vindicated."</P><font size=2><a href="index.html" target="_top">Back to MMM #93</a></font>&nbsp;<a href="mailbox.html">&lt;-</a>&nbsp;-&gt;</BODY></HTML>

<H2 align=center>Site Management</H2><P><HR WIDTH=80%><P>

<FONT SIZE=2>by <A HREF="MAILTO:kokhMMM@execpc.com">Peter Kokh</a></FONT>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;It's simple, really. We just plop down a basic habitat
module and throw some moondust over it for good luck, add some solar panels
or a small nuke, a radiator, an antenna, and a rover - and, <I>voila</I>,
we have a Moonbase! Whoa! Doesn't that leave a lot of unanswered questions?
How will our little baby develop? Are we going to be so quick to show
around the latest snapshots of our offspring a few years down the road?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will future growth and development of our little bundle show
that it had "good genes," or "bad" ones? A well-thought-out site management
philosophy with a full deck of guideline zoning protocols, in place from
day one, will help guarantee that we will be proud parents, not just
shortly after birth, but well down the road. That's adding "good genes." If
we fail to do this, or put it off as unimportant, the future of our
creation will be "amorphous," and since corrective and reactive measures
are never as effective as proactive ones (and always too late), an unhappy
McMurdo-style mess is sure to result if we don't care enough now - while we
are planning.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If a definite site, mapped from orbit down to 
near-meter-scale detail, has been predetermined, then our site management
plan can be quite specific in its initial design, with zoning of the 
immediate vicinity well thought out. One would hope this is the case.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If, however, we have only a general location in mind, we'll
leave picking the actual site up to the good judgment of the pilot of the
lunar descent vehicle bringing in the first load, then all we can have
prepared is a manual on the "General Principles of Lunar Base Site
Management." This is how the Apollo landing sites were picked: neighborhood
by NASA, block and lot by the LM pilot. It's unlikely that this will be the
case the next time around, when we go to the moon, not for a science
picnic, but to start (hopefully) a settlement.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll probably even have ready a name for the host site, our
new neighborhood, as distinct from the name of the outpost itself, e.g.
Pioneer Flats, Artemis Beach, New World Plain, Dawn Valley, etc. Perhaps
some of the names will reflect who donated how much cash to the
project.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing to remember is that no matter how much
individual pioneers and scouts may care, without a pre-agreed-upon and then
religiously pursued game of site management, chaos will inexorably insert
itself. Once allowed a chance to rule, chaos takes on a powerful life of
its own. Witness McMurdo Sound in Antarctica, before Greenpeace
photographers shamed us before ourselves and all the world. Compare cities
that have grown up with a reference master plan and those (Third World
villages-become-infrastructureless-megacities, and, to be fair, many a
European medieval city as well) that suddenly mushroomed like cancerous
weed patches. </P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Basic Principles</H4>

 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;An outpost is more than an architectural complex that we
are going to put there, snap its picture, and then leave as a monument. It
is presumably a nucleus from which long term "operations" will flow. These
operations will impact the site. We need to give as much thought to fitting
operations to site as we do to the design of the bent metal of the outpost
itself.</P>

 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it would be naive to assume we can
accurately pre-glimpse the full range of activities that will characterize
our lunar presence down the road, as base becomes outpost and outpost
becomes village and village becomes a settlement town. Our site management
philosophy and game plan must necessarily be amendable. What we need is
something to start from, a handbook of "how not to paint ourselves into a
corner." And that is not that tall an order.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps others will have something to add to this recipe for
a lunar beachhead site management masterplan, but at least a first stab at
it would seem to indicate we need to make room for the following: (a)
terrain to be left relatively undisturbed, for scenic and esthetic reasons;
(b) roadway approach corridors; (c) sites for auxiliary equipment (electric
power generation, heat rejection radiators, communications equipment,
spaceport, garaging of vehicles, etc.); (d) storage and warehousing of
surplus equipment, wastes and potentially recyclable trash, cannibalizable
packing & shipping materials; (e) areas where the regolith can be "mined"
for useful elements; (f) initial industrial park setaside; last but not
least, (g) vectors for expansion of the residential and other structural
parts of the outpost itself.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;As/if our presence expands by orders of magnitude, the site
plan for the perimeter of the base will have to give way to newer plans
that embrace ever larger and larger peripheral areas. No problem - if the
original plan has good genes.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Esthetic Zoning Protocols</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;While many a technician or scientist or engineer lucky
enough to be part of the original short-term crews may not care, the morale
both of those who will come for longer stays, and of the millions of
supporters at home who will peer over their shoulders electronically,
vistas out the windows of the outpost observation domes (or whatever) ought
to show both human (thoughtfully) transformed areas as well as broad
expanses of "magnificent desolation" that are minimally disturbed (or
restored). In planning the site, we need to be aware of what areas are in
sight from outpost "windows" and what areas will be within the horizons of
those coming and going between spaceport and outpost. We need to know which
areas of high ground will be broadly visible, as well as which areas will
be hidden from view of the window ports of either outpost or spaceport
coach. Some of this can hopefully be left in its undisturbed state,
visitable from sinter-paved walks or trails. Other parts of the perimeter,
necessarily disturbed in the base erection and deployment process, or in
base expansion, can be "restored," regraded and raked. Additional handsome
areas can be Japanese style sand and rock gardens, or sculpture gardens -
the start of uniquely lunan urban/rural "landscaping."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Scenic "easements" cannot be left for afterthought, even in
later expansion of the site. Making provision for them will not make
setting up our base or outpost any more expensive. It will simply require a
bit of timely patience.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;As mining operations begin, the availability of large
volumes of tailings for the creation of man-made hillocks or embankments to
shield storage and equipment areas from casual view will create new
options. That we are fairly certain such activities and opportunities will
develop, we can take the availability of tailings into consideration in
devising the scenic provisions and easements of our overall site plan and
its subsequent revision as the base-to-settlement unfolds itself.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus we will have both natural and human-landscaped areas.
For either, the availability of cleared boulders, shards and other debris
becomes so many opportunities for the lunar landscape architect. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunar "parklands" and scenic preserves need to be part of
every expansion of the radius of operations. With such a philosophy,
travelers, visitors, and vacationers will never need to be assaulted with
the ugly exposed entrails of our industrializing impact on our adoptive new
home world.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Storage and warehousing areas, mining and industrial can be
out of sight behind scarps, crater walls, ridges (natural or manmade),
hills, berms, in lava tubes, under ramada sheds, etc. The same goes for power
generation, heat rejection, and other necessary systems, <I>unless
architecturally complementary</I> to the moonscape. After all, we will needto be <I>visually reassured</I> of the presence of both the technical and
biospheric support eco-systems for maintenance of our presence on this, of
itself, alien world. We need to see both the undisturbed beauty, and
evidence that we are supported in our needs. The point is that the latter
need not be presented chaotically and in disordered fashion. A basic set of
esthetic zoning protocols will do the trick. The up-front cost will be
minimal. Down the road, such foresight may become a definite economic
plus.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of lunar "landscaping" should be taken seriously by
Earthside supporters with ready creative instincts and experience. We can't
go around planting "evergreens" or other trees, bushes, and flower beds.
But we can do something analogous, assist in the "blooming" of the lunar
soil, by bringing into being various human-midwived extrusions of surface
materials. This is not so unlike what Nature does as it brings out various
life-midwived extrusions of the geological elements on our own planet. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;With mining tailings and other material leftover from road
grading, cutting passes through ridges or crater walls, etc. it will not be
impossible to create what until now have only been fantasy mountainscapes
of craggy peaks, etc. In lieu of flower beds, we can boulevard or
"tree-line" our main settlement approaches with crystal glass snowflakes,
ceramic stalagmites, and other roadside sculptures meant to be panned in
passing. Roads can also be curbed with split and possibly polished breccias
and other lunar "rocks" displaced in the grading process. Nor are we stuck
with a palette of grays. We can whitewash with lime (Calcium Oxide) or with
Titanium Dioxide, even Aluminum Oxide. We can collect the iron-rich orange
soil found first at Shorty Crater, and more recently all over the place by
Clementine, and use it in concentrated form to give areas various tints
from rust to orange to cantaloupe. And a sprinkling of sulfur could
provide a yellow.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sculpture forests can be planned so that they take on whole
new aspects as the Sun slowly marches across the lunar dayspan skies.
Trees? Why we have already made trees of aluminum and aluminum foil for
Christmas time. Why not sculpture "trees" which are outgrowths not of life,
but of the inner potential of aluminum, iron, magnesium, and glass? They
could be made stiff and immutable, but why not also with fairy gossamer
"leafage" to flutter in the "breeze" of changing sunlight angles and mutual
shading interference. "Trees" and "bushes" can be modular in construction
using controlled "natural" randomization to vary size and branching
patterns and nature-like deviations from symmetry. They could be laden with
glass prism fruit to cast an everchanging pattern of rainbow colors. Let
your imagination soar. This won't happen all at once, but give it time!</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, UV and neon lighting will eventually be lunar
supportable options. Even passive electrofluorescent lighting, driven by
the sun angle and/or occasional solar flares - to give an ever changing
ambiance - is a possibility.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Road embankments can be dressed with cast basalt or ceramic
tiles with various textures and designs. "Pebbledash" panels are also a
simple option.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In short the resources of the future lunar "landscaper" know
few bounds. The point is leaving thoughtfully saved zones and sectors for
him or her to give creative expression.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Other Zoning Protocols</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, in our article on "Dust Control" [MMM #89 pp.
5-6] we discussed the wisdom of sintering (lightly fusing the surface
grains to a load-appropriate depth) aprons around airlocks, and of
sinter-paving areas of regular traffic (roads) and areas of regular,
routine activity such as areas where exterior systems are placed, or
exposed or sheltered "lee" space storage areas for items needed on a
frequent basis - the purpose being simply dust control. This can be
guaranteed by carefully drawn up zoning protocols and guidelines.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Storage and Warehousing Protocols</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We will discuss this topic at length in the article that
follows. The old adage, "a place for everything and everything in its
place" is the guiding philosophy we must devotedly pursue if we are to keep
chaos at bay. Do not provide each category with a storage place of its own
and voila, you have instant unrecoverable disaster, a good example of which
is the Manifesto office where this is being written.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Growth Vectors - the Site Plan</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;While surely we will add new modules to the original outpost
complex, it is unlikely that, as we move from outpost to pre-settlement
village, and then on to settlement town, that we will just keep adding on.
We may want to identify areas of the surrounding moonscape for starting
afresh, for example, once we are able to use made-on-site building
materials to take care of the bulk of our expansion needs. In time the
original imported outpost transplanted from factories on Earth may be
decommissioned and transferred to other uses: a spartan "hotel" for early
visitors, or preserved "as is" as an "historic park."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Any new "village" or "town" needs to have a plan for
expanding residential, agricultural, commercial, industrial, service,
educational, administrative and other zones, properly separated, properly
intertwined and interspersed, neighborhood after neighborhood, as we grow.
We certainly do not need to set out from Earth with such a City Plan
already brainstormed in detail. We simply need to be armed with a plenary
set of principles, if even in library form.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Exclave Concessions</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not think of the moonbase site as encompassing a
single contiguous area of set radius from our starter outpost. Depending on
the legal regime(s) that may apply, our "concession" or "charter" may
designate a fairly generous radius, more and more of which we will occupy
and transform as time goes on.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But if we are to move in the direction of providing for an
ever larger portion of our material needs as well as export potential
through the use of resources indigenous to the moon, then we may want/need
to range further afield to access special deposits of minerals not found
within the original site radius.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If we pick a "coastal" site, astride a boundary between
highland and mare terrain, this will give us immediate access to the two
major regolith soil groups. But we will still need to have access to KREEP
(potassium, rare earth elements, and phosphorus) deposits such as those<P>


represented in the splash-out from the formation of the Mare Imbrium (Sea
of Rains) basin over three billion years ago. Central peaks of larger
craters represent a fourth suite of minerals. And then we may find 
Sudbury-like astroblemes rich in asteroid-impact-donated lodes of iron, 
nickel, and more importantly, copper.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus we will need to set up "Exclave Concessions" as welland provide and maintain traffic corridors to such out-sources as well as
to other destinations like additional (rival or secondary supportive or
dependent) outposts and settlements. Each will need its own Site Management
Plan.</P>

Avoiding Chaos takes a Strategic Master Plan
</P><HR WIDTH=80%>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Inbound Storage</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;From the very outset, in the first days when the lunar
outpost is little more than a very elite group home, it will make rewarding
sense to have in place a system of keeping track of everything. Pressurized
storage space will be at a premium, woefully inadequate. It will be
necessary even from day one to begin using the seemingly endless outvac as
closet, attic, basement, shed, garage, and warehouse.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be stuff coming in from Earth, hopefully faster
than it can be used - reserves. Reserve hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon
(possibly in the easier to store form of methane, CH<FONT SIZE=1>4</FONT>,
and ammonia, NH<FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT>). Other volatiles and industrial
reagents where necessary in the various processing operations. Volatiles,
gasses and liquids, will be stored in tanks, and the beachhead site will
sport a growing "tank farm" from the first or second landing onwards.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be co-imports: packing / crating materials,
hopefully strategically made from cannibalizable materials that will become
essential as lunar industry gets started in earnest and begins
diversifying: copper and brass; stainless steel; polyethylene and
polyurethane and other easy-to-remold polymer materials. ("Stowaway
Imports," Back Issues reference <a href="#warehouse">above</a>).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be equipment, lots of it. Capital machinery to
carry on early mining, materials processing, manufacturing and fabrication
operations; equipment needed to set up electric <a href="/adb/04/03/03/">power generation</a> and
thermal equilibrium maintenance; equipment needed for <a href="/adb/04/03/05/consumable-reduction.html">recycling wastes</A>.</P>

 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many an item on ship manifests will need at least temporary
storage outside. Where? First, of course, there will be an off-loading area
at the humble spaceport. From there, it will be logical to move items to
staging areas near where they will be used in industry, agriculture,
construction, etc.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Byproduct Storage</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The next broad classification of items needing storage will
be that of byproducts of human activities on the moon. Mining and
processing operations will produce veritable mountains of "tailings." As
these may be enriched sources of yet other elements, not yet processed, it
make strategic sense not to lump all tailings together but keep separate
those from each separate type of processing and ore beneficiation
operation. Those tailings not especially enriched in anything, can, along
with regolith moving surplus loads be used in landscaping operations as
suggested above.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturing byproducts and quality control rejects should
be carefully sorted each kind from the rest, against the day when they will
become valuable feedstocks for industrial processes and entrepreneurial
endeavors not yet begun, even not yet imagined.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Canisters of human fecal wastes can be stored in permashade
where they will remain frozen and inert, against the day when they may be
an invaluable source of fertilizer in food production and agriculture in
general. Prior to storage, these wastes could spend some time in quartz
covered trays in full dayspan sunlight, allowing solar ultraviolet to
sterilize them thoroughly and effectively.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, "miscellaneous" garbage and trash need to be stored
in sorted form according to the nature of their primary and secondary
recyclable content. If there has to be some residual Miscellaneous Storage
Area, a catch-all for everything we cannot yet see a need for, then,
nonetheless, each item needs description, qualification, and recording. As
a master computer program senses a building accumulation of a particular
type of material or stuff not yet separately stored, a new distinct storage
area can be set aside, and we will know just where to get everything that
can be moved thereto.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;How? We use the Double Entry Barcoding Inventory system
devised for Mir by John Voigt of Lakeshore Computers in Cleveland, WI. Each
item is given a barcode, as is each storage location. As an item is stored,
its barcode and that of its location are read as a pair. Nothing ever gets
lost anymore.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Production inventory - Items awaiting export</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Early export products will include liquid lunar oxygen, LOX
or LUNOX for short, and possibly other fuels such as Silane, SiH<FONT
SIZE=1>4</FONT>, both mainly for rocket fuel. These can be stored in the
tank farms. If we practice "primage" (every time we move regolith, in road
building or construction we heat the soil to extract the precious
volatiles), we will begin accumulating gasses that may be useful someday:
hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen; garden variety helium and helium-3; neon,
argon, krypton, and xenon. Someday these gasses will be the feedstocks of
new industries, the springboard for a second wave of lunar
industrialization and diversification. If need be, the primage extract can
be stored as an undifferentiated brew, leaving separation of the various
gasses for a later effort.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Maintaining Quality of Stored Product</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be wise to protect some of these stored materials
under ramparts or shed-canopies, to protect them, not from the vacuum, but
from attack from the lunar skies: UV, cosmic rays and solar flares,
micrometeorites, and bi-monthly shock of alternating thermal extremes.
Periodic tests should show if any degradation is operating, and accordingly
if some items should be depreciated with storage age. Conversely, economic
conditions and new entrepreneurial, industrial, and export opportunities,
as well as import difficulties could work to appreciate the value of many
items.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some stores we may want out of sight. Yet an orderly storage
yard in full sight, as an eloquent testimony of thoughtful
self-providence, may be very reassuring, In contrast, the sight of a
storage area in helter skelter chaos would be rather disquieting, let alone
an eyesore. The yardmaster's job will be important. It is a job that must
be filled, filled with the best.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>A Lavatube - the ultimate warehouse</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lavatubes, of whose existence we are confident from indirect
evidence (rilles with natural bridges, strings of rimless collapse pits,
analogy from terrestrial shield volcanoes made of similarly non-viscous
lava), and whose likely scale and size dwarfs known Earthside analogs,
present themselves as ideal warehouses. They keep everything out of sight
and out of harm's way from the celestial elements.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;They may not be used for that capacity right away, however,
because it would seem that access could present some initially discouraging
obstacles. We may need to either erect industrial elevators or grade
negotiable access ramps down rough and rugged talus slopes from cave-in
entrances. Yet certainly, their great volume and its weather-free character
will guarantee their use for storage as soon as they can be found and
access provided.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"A place for everything, and everything in its place." It's
not just for closets and desks anymore! It's a philosophy that will bode
well for our future on the moon, if we abide by it, providing an eventual
industrial and entrepreneurial bonanza. Equally it is a philosophy which
will spell out our sentence, if we give it but lip service. We can look at
it as a sort of "Real Accounts" ledgers, in which we are dealing with real
items, not just financial values.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the operative condition is that we start such
housekeeping practices from day one, for, as we have warned, chaos, once it
has its foot in the door, takes on a life of its own, setting up conditions
from which it will be extremely difficult to recover.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;For sake of best long-shadow lighting conditions as well as
heat management, all the Apollo missions landed shortly after local
sunrise, and as if subconsciously frightened senseless of nightfall, left
well before local noon. We haven't come close to experiencing a whole lunar
dayspan/nightspan cycle! Here are the figures for each mission.</P>

<P align="center">Sunrise to Sunset is 354.367 hrs or 14.7653 days<BR>Full Sunth (local

<P ALIGN=center><IMG WIDTH=244 HEIGHT=181  ALT="Apollo Landing Time Comparison Chart"
SRC="090land.gif"></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a pattern similar to early sorties to Antarctica.
There, we came after the spring pack-ice breakup and left well before the
fall freezeup - for the first two decades. It wasn't until Byrd set up
Little America in 1929 [a site abandoned 30 years later in '59 as U.S.
Antarctic operations concentrated on McMurdo Sound] that we took the plunge
and "overwintered." That was quite some hurdle, mentally and emotionally,
as well as operationally and logistically. Now we face the same hurdle on
the moon. But until we do it, all our talk of "permanent presence" is just
so much empty macho bravado.</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Little America, the major hurdles to be
overcome were the need to build up during the summer months enough fuel
(heat, power, and vehicles) and food reserves to last the long cold winter
night months when resupply would be impossible. Rescue would also be
impossible, meaning medical supplies and kits had to be more adequate, and
medical personnel more fully trained. On the moon the challenge will be
similar although the nightspan is only a twelfth as long.</p>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Thermal management</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Surface temperatures drop drastically and quickly after
lunar sunset. But, these are surface effects only. The powdery soil is a
poor conductor, and a poor reservoir, of either heat or cold. A couple of
meters down, below the blanket of shielding soil, temperatures remain about
-4&#176; F or -20&#176; C all the time.</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Most expect a heat buildup within the buried habitat, heat
from living, heat from operations, that will not be drawn off by the
surrounding soil as fast as it is generated - even at night. If an equation
of heat inputs and losses shows a net heat rise even during nightspan, a
system of external heat-shedding radiators will be necessary.</p> <IMG
WIDTH=242 HEIGHT=97 ALT="Heat Sink Diagram"ALIGN=RIGHT
SRC="090heatsink.gif"> <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If, however, because available power
during nightspan means powered down operations, and if that in turn means a
thermal deficit during nightspan, then some sort of thermal heat sink
accessed by a heat pump might not be a bad idea. We'll have, or should
have, the former - in the form of water reserves. A large reserve tank can
be buried in the soil not far from the habitat. Heat from the water would
be pumped into the habitat by nightspan, the direction reversed for dayspan
cooling. A net heat excess over the whole dayspan/nightspan cycle would
then be shed by external radiators. </p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If we don't bring along, find, or generate (i.e. adding
hydrogen to locally produced oxygen, probably in fuel cells to produce
night power and water both), enough water to make such a heat-pump
accessible water reservoir work, then our plans to make our presence
"permanent" are in big trouble.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful thermal management will depend largely on how
much care is taken to isolate major heat-producing activities from the
habitat areas. This means automated unpressurized processing and
manufacturing plants, saving low temperature aspects of production
(finishing, assembly, etc.) for occupied areas.</p>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Nightspan Power</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many suggest solving the nightspan power problem by bringing
along a small nuclear power unit. Even if the legal and political hurdles
can be overcome (e.g. by having the Russians contribute this system), the
point is missed. No matter how big the nuke, there will still be less power
available during nightspan than during dayspan for the simple reason that
during the latter, the Sun also shines, its heat ready to do work - simply
and cheaply.</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sun can provide nightspan power in these ways:</p><OL Type=a>

<li><P>Solar heat can be used via several processes to produce oxygen from
moon rock by dayspan. During nightspan this oxygen is combined with
hydrogen brought from Earth, in fuel cells, to produce power - with pure
potable water as the byproduct.</P>

<li><P>If necessary, solar power can also be used during dayspan to
electrolyze a portion of the water reserves back into hydrogen and oxygen
for nightspan fuel cell fuel. (In addition, the Sun's raw ultra-violet rays
can help purify the remaining water reserves under cover of UV-transparent
quartz.)</P>

<LI><P>If there is an early cast basalt industry to provide paving blocks
and other low performance items useful to the expanding base, possibly as a
sideline to oxygen production through heating the moon rock, this would
open another road for Sun and water to work synergistically to provide
nightspan power. If during dayspan, when the solar concentrators power
these industries, there builds up an excess residual pool of molten rock
and this is kept shielded from the heat-sucking night sky in an underground
reservoir, the residual heat of this "magma pool" can be tapped to produce
steam to run the base's nightspan generators. This is the idea of LUNAX
director David Dunlop. A refractory lining of aluminum oxide would make
such a magma-pool reservoir more efficient, but might not be absolutely
necessary.</P></OL>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Reiff of General Space Corporation suggests another
form of lunar heat pump. If vibro-accoustic testing locates a relatively
small underground void (cavern) near the surface (less than 100 feet), this
can be accessed by drilling. The natural reservoir can then be filled with
a thermally conductive material (he suggests smelting regolith into molten
aluminum). The thermal properties of the available material should drive
the purity requirements. The material would be allowed to reach an
equilibrium (cool). Next you would set up a thermal dynamic generator
(Sterling cycle would work good) with your heat source on one end and the
newly created heat sink connected to the other. You could shade the
generator and the top of the heat sink to even provide power by dayspan
too. [Smelting aluminum, however, is not likely to be an early outpost
technology - Ed.]</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sun and water, then, seem to be the simple and elegantbasic ingredients for a nightspan power system (as well as maintaining
thermal equilibrium). Elaborate and expensive plans for providing nightspan
power (or maintaining thermal equilibrium) by other higher tech means seem
foolish.</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The division of labor into hot in-vacuum and cool in-habitat
chores (see above) in order to assist in thermal management will also work
neatly to separate man-hours into energy-intensive dayspan aspects and
labor-intensive nightspan aspects of the total production and operations
cycles.</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have suggested that this fortnightly change of pace will
become a well-liked feature of lunar life. Some have seen it as a burden to
be avoided. Do not forget that on the moon there are no seasons, no daily
changes of weather, both of which add spice and interest and renewal to
living on Earth. If this nightspan power "deficit" were ever to be
effectively eliminated, the biggest source of rhythm and change of pace
would be gone with it. Productivity gains would be temporary as morale
slowly plummeted from routine, boredom, ennui.</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Other nightspan power solutions frequently proposed are well
down the road, something for later generation advanced settlements to
consider. These include solar power satellites, lunar solar array networks
(one over the nearest pole makes the most sense as it would be in sunlight
whenever the outpost is experiencing nightspan), <a target="_top"
href="/adb/02/09/he3-intro.html">helium-3</a> fusion plants, and, oh yes,
lunar hydroelectric.</p>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Air/water/waste management</H4>

 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overnighting will also require much more capable recycling
systems than did missions only intended to spend a couple of days on the
morning Sun lit surface. Some water recycling chores can be solar-operated,
as suggested above. By nightspan, used water could simply accumulate; or,
freezing (by sky exposure) could work to separate out some impurities.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Human solid wastes could be stored out-vac, left to freeze
in shaded sanitary containers. Rather than be a problem for eventual
disposal, such compostable organics-rich material will become a banked
resource of great value for the eventual commencement of regolith-soil
based agriculture, once creation of significantly cheaper pressurized
expansion volume becomes possible using on-site produced building
materials.</p>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Other "Overnighting" Needs</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan as we will to stock up by dayspan for a dayspan-only
logistics operation of resupply and manpower relief from Earth, we will be
prudent to allow for the possibility of night landings and launches. Once
we can land on a dime using signal clues rather than visual ones, this
should be no big deal. It does mean, however, that the outpost's
"spaceport" be more than a simple designated circle in the sand. It will
need to be equipped with beacons and lights and radio.</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;For this and who knows how many other contingencies, a
service vehicle that can operate at night is also a must. This means more
than headlights. It means power supplies, motive systems, and lubricants
that can withstand temperatures of -200&#176; F or -130&#176; C with no
problem.</p>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Overnighting Measures, a Test of Outpost Design</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Any approach to lunar outpost design, NASA/International or
commercial, in which every aspect does not reflect the needs of
"overnighting" begs to fail. If you are honest, you will realize that some
of the above capacities are not self-obvious if you conveniently ignore the
fact that some time after your base setup landing, the Sun will set, and
stay set for almost fifteen days, over and over again every sunth,
forever.</p>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:boise@asi.org">Boise Pearson</a>, President,
Artemis Society International</Font>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning with the issue you hold in your hands, members of the
Artemis Society are in for a real treat. In order to provide our members with
news and information on a regular basis, and to increase the quality and quantity
of lunar colonization material that lands in your mailbox, we have decided to
offer Moon Miners' Manifesto as a membership benefit. Our newsletter, Pleiades,
has become the Artemis section of MMM.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me apologize for the intermittent nature of Pleiades in the
past. The excitement of a project to put men (and perhaps you, one day soon) on
the moon helped the Society membership to grow faster than we could keep up with.
One of the areas we had the most trouble with was regular publication of a
newsletter to keep our members updated and supplied with information on the
Project. This arrangement with the publishers of MMM will ensure that we can
handle our current membership, and provide for our future growth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantages of this new arrangement to everyone involved are
numerous. Members of <a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html" target="_top">Artemis Society International</a> will receive this publication regularly,
something we have had trouble with in the past. The Lunar Reclamation Society,
publishers of MMM, will begin their tenth year of continuous publication this
December. This issue represents nine years of insightful articles and editorials
on a multitude of subjects related to successful colonization of our nearest
neighbor. ASI members will now become a part of this ongoing effort. I think you
will be pleased at the quality and insightfulness that has been the hallmark of
MMM over the past nine years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We are excited to be combining forces with organizations whose
goals are similar to ours. This exposure to ideas from many corners of the Lunar
community can only help to stimulate the creativity and action that is needed to
put us back on the moon, this time to stay.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We welcome your comments and suggestions and submissions as we
start off with this new publication. <a Href="mailto:boise@asi.org">Let us
know</a> what you would like to see in future issues. We will be handling the
editing for the ASI section of each issue here at ASI. Send your comments to MMM,
c/o ASI, PO Box 4878, Huntsville, AL 35815.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Enjoy the rest of the issue!!</P>

About the Artemis Society
</H2><P><font size=2><P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>NOTE: This has been modified from its origional form to reflect changes in membership structure.</font></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Artemis Society is a non-profit organization dedicated to
conducting educational, technical, legal, and financial activities to encourage
the establishment of a self-supporting permanent human presence on the moon. The
primary focus of the Artemis Society is the <a href="/index.html" target="_top">Artemis Project</a>, a lunar base project described in the following
article.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're serious about wanting to live on the moon, you want to
<a href="/asi_member.html" target="_top">join the Artemis Society</a>. The
Society was formed in August 1994 to provide a way for everyone to participate
directly in building the lunar base project. Less than 5% of the work needs to be
done by rocket scientists, so you can make a significant contribution to your
future in space even if you don't have a PhD in astronautics. There are thousands
of things you can do to help, so whatever your interests are, the project has a
fun way you can contribute your time and talent to making it happen.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently in the process of forming various Technical
Committees to start organizing and coordinating all of the fun people have been
having with the project for the last year. These Committees will be groups of
Artemis Society members and members of similarly focused organizations actively
working to put this project together. We encourage all of our members to contact

About the Artemis Project
</H2><P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>


<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>The Project</H4>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Artemis Project is a privately financed commercial
venture to establish a permanent, manned lunar base and to exploit the
resources of the moon for future development of space travel. The first
Artemis flight places a habitat on the moon for permanent occupation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The goals of the project are to build a permanent manned
base on the moon, to exploit lunar resources for profit, to demonstrate
that manned space flight is within the reach of private enterprise, and to
bootstrap private industry into manned space flight. Artemis is unique
among proposals for developing a moon base because it is a 100% privately
financed commercial venture which will place the first element of the lunar
base on the moon within the next decade, and because it will show a profit
from the first flight to the moon.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Costs, Revenues, and Financing</H4>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous moon base studies have based their cost models on
the performance of government projects and assumed revenues would come only
after decades of development. The resulting high capital costs and long
term before realizing any profit made it impossible for private enterprise
to finance a manned space venture; but by using standard commercial
business practices, costs can be reduced to less than 10% of a similar
government-sponsored program. Additionally, Artemis reduces its costs by
using technology and resources already developed in previous manned space
flight programs.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current estimate for the cost of the first flight is
about $1.3 billion. This level of investment is quite common in the
business world. For example, one new deep-water oil rig typically costs
about one billion dollars.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Artemis will pay for its initial development by exploiting
the <a target="_top" href="/adb/03/04/">entertainment value</a> of the first flights. We
estimate the market value of the first flight from all sources to be
significantly higher than its cost.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the first mission must be manned; the
entertainment value of a robotic flight is not sufficient to pay the bills.
The estimated revenues are based on comparisons to similar mass-marketing
ventures which tie movies or television shows in with associated products.
The Apollo program was run with engineering precision, its drama hidden by
the need for a government agency to present an unflagging image of
confidence to the world. In contrast, The Artemis Project is designed to
be entertaining from the start. With half a dozen science fiction writers
already working on the project, we should be able to attain that goal and
still retain the appeal which sets the project apart from science fiction
productions - the Artemis Project is real.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, we plan to pay for the initial stages of the
project through shameless commercialism.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Reference Mission</H4>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The reference mission is being used in the current
feasibility study to determine costs, revenues, and technical and political
issues. Two <a target="_top" href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/shuttle.html">Space Shuttle</a>
launches put the Artemis hardware into low Earth orbit, where the moon
vehicle is assembled. Our crew goes up on the second Shuttle flight. The
space station is used as a staging base in the reference mission. If it is
not available, we launch the first element on one flight and then
rendezvous with it on the next flight. In that case our crew uses the
Shuttle as a staging base for assembling the Artemis spacecraft.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a target="_top" href="/adb/04/02/01/ltv-notes.html">lunar transfer
vehicle</a> is a small spaceborne habitat with propulsion systems and
support for the crew during flight between Earth and Lunar orbits. Its
rockets are used to fly to lunar orbit. The reference mission uses a
trajectory almost identical to the Apollo flights.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Lunar Transfer Vehicle</H4>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon arrival in lunar orbit, the lunar base core module with
its descent rockets separates from the lunar transfer vehicle and lands on
the surface of the moon using a propulsion package attached to the core
module's pressurized habitat. The lunar transfer vehicle remains in lunar
orbit, unmanned, while the crew descends to the surface.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target="_top" href="/adb/04/01/01/04/day-01.html">On the moon</a>, the
crew levels the lunar base habitat and reconfigures the lunar base for
permanent operation. The crew conducts extravehicular activity to assay the
site and gather samples of the lunar regolith (moon dirt). They film
activities throughout the flight, both stock footage and scripted scenes
for later use in movies and documentaries.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Ascent Stage</H4>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;When surface activities are complete, the crew boards the
ascent stage and makes the two-hour flight to rendezvous with the orbiting
lunar transfer vehicle. The ascent stage is a simple, open vehicle, so crew
members depend on their space suits for life support. Except for not being
able to quickly return to base in an emergency, the hazards to the crew
during ascent are no greater than two hours outside on the moon's
surface.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;After docking the ascent stage to the LTV, the crew returns
to Earth, where they use their rockets to enter Earth orbit for a
rendezvous with the space station. They leave the transportation system in
orbit for use on later flights to lower the cost of future development. The
lunar transfer vehicle may be used at the space station for additional
laboratory space between flights, or it may be leased for other operations
in Earth orbit. After the Artemis vehicles have been secured at the space
station, the crew returns to Earth on the next available Shuttle
flight.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the crew goes home, a <a
target="_top" href="/adb/04/02/05/">telerobot</a> is used to bury the core module in moon
dirt for thermal insulation as well as protection from radiation and
meteoroids. The robot may also be able to get camera footage of the Artemis
stack's initial descent to the lunar surface. This will be first time any
vehicle has been recorded landing on the moon.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>"Artemis"</H4>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in the project, we decided to go back to the tradition
of using names from ancient mythology for manned space flight programs.
Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo carried human beings to the moon in less than
ten years, but manned space programs lost sight of their exploratory nature
and fell into lethargic bureaucracy when they adopted more pedestrian names
like Skylab, the Space Shuttle, and the Space Station.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target="_top" href="/Bio/artemis-bio.html">Artemis</a> is the twin
sister of Apollo in Greek mythology. She is the moon, and Apollo is the
Sun. Artemis is also the goddess of the hunt, a constant reminder that our
project is a voyage of exploration, a venture which will live off the land
in its travels and return products of great value to our home on Earth.</P>

<H2 align=center>Revisiting the Moon Buggy</H2><p align="center">Would lunar rovers left on the moon still be in working
condition when we return?</p><P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:bwaldin@aol.com">Bryce Walden</a><BR>
[response to a screenwriter's question on America OnLine, reprinted in MMM with
permission]<BR></FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;General contractor for the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) was Boeing;
GM Delco made the electronics. The LRV was first used on Apollo 15 at Hadley
Rille, and in all subsequent missions. The chassis was aluminum. The essential
"buggy" massed 400-600 lbsm (pounds-mass) (180-270 kilograms) depending on
equipment. It could carry equipment, astronauts, and payload up to 1100 lbsm (499
kilograms), more than twice its own weight. Yet it was not strong enough to hold
the astronauts on Earth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Top speed mentioned by my source was 14 kph (8.7 mph); the
speedometer was calibrated 0-20 kph (0-12.4 mph). Average speed on all three
missions using the LRV was 5.17 mph (9.1 kph). Average for Apollo 17 was 5.0 mph
(8.0 kph), total distance travelled was 22.3 miles (35.9 kilometers), and total
time driving was 4:26 hours.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Power was supplied by 2 silver-zinc batteries, each 36v, 121
amp-hours per battery, encased in magnesium, then enclosed by thermal blankets
and dust covers. Each battery had a relief valve for protection against excessive
internal pressure. Thermal control was critical: the batteries had to be
maintained between 40&#176; F (4&#176; Celsius) and 125&#176; F (52&#176;
Celsius). The only practical method of heat rejection in the vacuum was by
thermal radiation. Unfortunatly, the slightest amount of lunar dust on the
radiators (essentially mirrors) would "effectively destroy" their ability to
perform. For this reason the radiators were kept closed during activities, to be
opened manually by astronauts after "parking" for the "night." "During operation,
heat generated was stored in heat sinks consisting of two LRV batteries and tanks
containing wax-like phase change material." According to Gene Cernan and Jack
Schmitt, "If you take a couple more batteries up there, that thing would just
keep going...."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these guys aren't Moon Buggy Mechanics. Other astronauts
have been known to say the buggy had used up all warrantees by the end of the
mission (5 days or 250,000 miles....). Besides the batteries, the flexible spline
inside each wheel hub, part of the kinetic power transmission system, may have
degraded. Countless thermal cycles of the vehicle between lunar day (+250&#176;
F, 121&#176; Celsius) and lunar night (-250&#176; F, -157&#176; Celsius) will
take their toll on structural elements, electronics, and other system parts.
There is also the possibility of radiation damage to the control electronics. Of
course, it might work, for a little while -- perhaps a heroic last gasp. With
fresh batteries, of course. That overpressure release probably let vital elements
escape as the batteries heated to lunar daytime temperatures.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;One other interesting note is that the LRV had an inertial
navigation device that always pointed toward the LEM (bearing and distance), so
the astronauts would not have to guess, in the austere and misleading lunar
environment (ever taken a walk in the desert?), the quickest way back to the
base. They also did not have to stay in sight of the LEM.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunar rover data and quotes are from "The Lunar Roving Vehicle: A
Historical Perspective" by Saverio F. Morea, Director, Research and Technology
Office, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Alabama, where the LRV was tested. The
paper was presented at the second Lunar Bases and Space Activities of the 21st
Century conference, April 5-7 1988, Houston TX. Contribution No. LBS-88-203.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, I don't think we should depend on or plan to use
any of the one-shot equipment sent up with Apollo. I prefer the idea of fencing
it off and preserving these first explorations as well as possible. We should be
sensitive to other sites of interest, as well.</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;November '95 Edition: The C.I.S. manned space station Mir with
Mir-20 (call sign 'Uran') Cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko, Sergei Avdeyev and Thomas
(DF4TR / DP0MIR) Reiter will be appearing in the midwest evening skies Oct. 15th
to Nov. 6th, '95, returning to morning skies Nov. 19th to Dec. 6th.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Amateur radio operators can log into the Mir 'Packet' (R0MIR-1)
BBS on 145.550MHz simplex or 435.775MHz uplink / 437.775 downlink MHz. The
cosmonauts also use the freq. 145.200MHz up, 145.800MHz down or 435.725MHz up,
437.925MHz down or 145.550Mhz simplex to talk with amateur radio operators on the
ground during their off-hours.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;For exact times and locations to see the space station over your
backyard call MN MIRWATCH Coordinator Ben Huset at (612) 639-9109. Look for more

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>"Greetings from 400 km above the Earth."</H4> 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's hard to find words for this incredible view. I mean - it's
like ... it's indescribable. We are in the moment over the ocean. The view is
magnificent. The station is oriented now perpendicular to the Earth's
surface.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first EVA of an ESA Astronaut falls together nicely with the
Ministerial Conference. It is an excellent sign for the future and I really hope,
in the middle of Earth and Sky, that there lots of European Astronauts will
follow to lead to our participation in the international Space Station
Program.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many greetings from here."<BR> [Thomas Reiter after leaving the
MIR Station for his first space walk on Friday October 20th, '95 (flight day
48)]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Though not a first for Europe, this was the first space sortie by
an ESA astronaut (Jean-Loup Chretien of the French national space agency, CNES,
had already taken a spacewalk outside Mir, back in 1988).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The two space walkers, Avdeyev and Reiter exited the station
through the airlock hatch in the KVANT-2 module at 12:55 CET. Thomas was almost
overwhelmed by the impression of the free space. He said a few sentences in
English to document this remarkable event. The two crew members then moved over
to SPEKTR module of the station, where the ESEF facility is located. Four
experiment cassettes were installed on the facility and tested before the two
workers left the site to "walk" to a site with Russian experiments, where they
had to exchange some experiment cassettes. Sergei had a small video camcorder
mounted to his belly which took breathtaking pictures, played back to us after
they had returned to the interior of the station at 18:06 CET. The crew was
always ahead of their schedule and while rest periods had been planned for them
during the shadow phases (which occur once on every orbit) they worked and acted
almost all the time - the full moon gave them enough light to see.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Asked how they feel, by ground personnel after they had returned,
they replied they feel just fine - the only one that's tired would be Yuri
(Gidzhenko, the crew commander who remained inside, chasing around the station to
support them. The crew is in a very good mood and in excellent condition and
looking forward to "meet" their families on Saturday and of course will need
their "free" weekend.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas was a "guest" in the ministerial conference at Toulouse,
France, deciding about the future of Europe's Manned Space Flight - Involvement
in Space Station Alpha. He addressed the Ministers and spoke with them and a
press team. The conference has decided to participate in the Space Stationprogram - as you most likely have already got from the media. Needless to say,
that we are all very happy about that.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Spin Control: Recent production delays at the booster plant that
builds the Soyuz rockets have forced the launch delay of the Mir-21 crew and
nobody wants to pay the over time work required to meet the original launch date
of January 16, '96, yet nobody wants to say that. The European space agency (ESA)
released this statement: ESA Astronaut Thomas Reiter, on board the space station
MIR since 5 September 1995 for ESA's EUROMIR 95 mission, might have his record
breaking stay of 135 days extended by another 44 days. ESA and Russia are
currently negotiating this extension which would serve the interest of both
partners. For Russia, it would optimize the use of onboard resources, while it
would enable ESA at the same time to intensify and enlarge the scientific program
of EUROMIR 95. A final decision about the extension is expected for the end of
this month. (October)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;To clarify some points related to the extension: 
<OL>
<LI><P>The mission extension has been a possibility for some time, and was
discussed with Thomas Reiter before launch.</P>
<LI><P>The current crew will return to Earth in the SOYUZ capsule in which they

immediate evacuation of the MIR station is possible.</P>

<h2><font size=2>

Director, Space Access Society</font></h2>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Space Access Update is Space Access Society's
when-there's-news publication. Space Access Society's goal is to promote
affordable access to space for all, period. We believe in concentrating our
limited resources at whatever point looks like yielding maximum progress
toward this goal.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, we think this means working our tails off trying
to get the government to build and fly a high-speed reusable rocket
demonstrator, one  or more "X-rockets", in the next three years, in order
to quickly build up  both experience with and confidence in reusable
Single-Stage To Orbit (SSTO)  technology.  The idea is to reduce SSTO
technical uncertainty (and thus  development risk and cost) while at the
same time increasing investor  confidence, to the point where SSTO will
make sense as a private commercial  investment.  We have reason to believe
we're not far from that point now.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our major current focus is on supporting the govern-ment's
fully reusable single-stage rocket technology programs, the low-speed DC-X,
and its high-speed followon the X-33 NASA/DOD/industry cooperative
project.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;With luck and hard work, we should see fully-reusable rocket
testbeds flying  into space repeatedly later this decade, and practical
orbital transport projects getting underway.  Join us, and help us make
this happen.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;To join Space Access Society or buy the SSTO/DC-X V 3.0
video we have for sale (Two hours, includes all eight DC-X flights, X-33,
DC-X and SSTO backgrounders, aerospike engine test-stand footage, plus
White Sands Missile Range DC-X pre and post flight footage) mail a check
to:</P>

<H2 align="center"><font size=5>Alternative Engines for X-33</font><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>[Space Access Update #55, cont'd]
</FONT></h2>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;[The severe drawbacks old SSMEs (Space Shuttle Main Engines)
and the powerful vested interests that work to favor their use nonetheless]
would [not] matter if alternatives to SSME weren't available, alternatives
possibly more suitable to the overall purposes of the X-33. We're
reasonably well-aquainted with two such liquid-oxygen/liquid-hydrogen (LOX/
LH2) engines.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Russian D-57</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;	The D-57 was designed as a high-energy upper stage engine.
Sea-level thrust is ~70,000 lbs, vacuum thrust ~90,000 lbs, reports onthrottleability vary. Engine weight is ~2100 lbs, giving a relatively poor
takeoff thrust-to-weight of 33:1 (SSME sea-level T:W is ~50:1) but
reportedly engine weight could be relatively easily shaved to yield takeoff
T:W of ~45:1.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Over thirty D-57s were built; reports on the number
currently available vary widely, but the Russians never throw anything
away...  Between six and eight D-57's could power an X-33 in the size range
currently contemplated.  Over 150 test-stand firings took place, with total
run time near ten hours. We've seen claims that D-57 is too prone to
explosive failure for X-33 use; we haven't seen the data on which those
claims are based.  We note that just about all rocket engines blow up a few
tests stands early in their test programs; such teething problems aren't
necessarily relevant to flight safety.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We don't assume D-57 is certain to be suitable for X-33; we
do recommend strongly that its suitability be thor-oughly explored as soon
as possible.  </P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Pratt & Whitney RL-10 Upgrade</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous sources indicate that the P&W RL-10 (a version of
which powers DC-X) can be relatively easily upgraded to 26,000 lbs thrust
sea-level, 35,000 lbs thrust vacuum, with total engine weight staying ~400
lbs, possibly less.  This would yield a sea-level T:W of 65:1, actually
better than SSME, though we should note both that this would be at
lower-than-SSME specific impulse ("Isp", effectively a measure of
fuel-efficiency) and that the more complex plumbing required for a
multi-RL-10 installation would offset some part of the weight saved.
Between 16 and 20 such upgraded RL-10's could power an X- 33 of the size
currently being contemplated.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The various modifications required for SSTO suitabi-lity
(increased chamber pressure, deep throttling, extendable nozzle) have
already been tested separately.  One option for an RL-10 powered X-33 in
the event of delays in upgraded RL-10 delivery could be initial flight test
using existing RL-10 versions and a reduced propellant load.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We recommend strongly that work on such an enhanced RL-10
begin ASAP. Even absent SSTO applications, numerous upper-stage
applications exist for a very similar (no deep throt-tling needed) engine.
We further recommend that DC-X style lean management, lean budget, and
tight schedule be applied to this effort.  There is neither time nor money
for business as usual.</P>

<H2 align="center"><font size=5>Not-Quite-Final DOD Appropriation<BR>
Has $25M For Reusable Rocket Work</font><BR><FONT SIZE=2>
[Space Access Update #59]</FONT></P></h2>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The House-Senate conference on the FY'96 Department of
Defense (DOD) Appropriation bill finished last week with $25 million for
reusable rocket work in support of X-33 at USAF Phillips Labs.  This is
less than we'd hoped for, given the late surge of support we've been seeing
in the Senate, but still $25 million more than the Administration
originally asked for.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The House had voted to authorize $100 M and appropriate $50
M, while the Senate version DOD funding bills had no reusable rocket
funding coming into the conference.  The new Senate support we've seen came
too late to add anything to the Senate versions, so we likely ended up with
$25 million by a straight splitting of the difference between the House's
$50 million and the Senate's zero. Chances are we'll do better here next
year. We've built some foundations.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;	Meanwhile, the House, in a surprising but not
unpre-cedented move, voted to reject this conference committee's overall
results at the end of last week. The rejection was over a variety of issues
-- Bosnia provisions, abortions in DOD hospitals, funding of additional
production for both the B-2 bomber and Seawolf attack subs -- none of these
issues SSTO related.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Likely what will happen is that a new conference will take
place, limited strictly to the controversies that sank this version.
Chances of our either gaining or losing anything from the current $25
million funding for DOD reusable rocket work are small.  We'll be keeping
an eye on things, of course.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Congress and the White House thrashed out a
six-week "Continuing Resolution", legal authority for the government to go
on spending more or less at the current rate until mid-November, despite
the start of Federal Fiscal Year 1996 on October 1st without a new budget
signed into law yet.  This is nothing unusual in recent years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The HUD, VA, and Independent Agencies (NASA) Appropriation
bill will be the second to last of over a dozen major appropriations bills
dealt with.  (The only appropriation after it on the list is for running
the District of Columbia.)  The critical-to-X-33 HUD, VA and IA conference,
last we heard, was scheduled for October 16th.  We'd guess this will slip a
bit more before everything's taken care of.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The main issue in this conference, as far as we're
concerned, is still getting the Senate's $63 million for X-33 accepted over
the House's $43 million.  The previous alerts on this matter still stand;
if you have a Senator or Representative on the HUD, VA, IA Appropriations
subcommittees and you haven't yet contacted them per recent Alerts, please
do so.  Just because the formal conference is delayed doesn't mean the
staffs aren't quietly working on the issues.		HV/SAS</P>

<H3>Unmentioned advantage of shelter hangars</H3> <P align=center>10/2/95</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;One advantage of sheds or hangars as described in your recent
article, "Shelter on the Moon" [MMM #88, page 4] is that they would seem ideal
for inflatables. Think of it.</P>

<UL type=circle>
<LI>no thermal stress;
<LI>no exposure to UV or cosmic rays
<LI>no exposure to solar flares
<LI>no exposure to micrometeorites
<LI>no shielding emplacement pressure surges or trauma dangers 
<LI>lee environment for deployment
<LI>easy maintenance and access to exterior surfaces of inflatables 
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem I see for not-directly-shielded inflatables is a
slow buildup of corrosive atomic oxygen; but this seems unlikely in a "lee"
environment.</P>

<H2 align=center>Expanding the Outpost</H2><P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:kokhmmm@execpc.com">Peter
Kokh</a></P></font>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The provident architect, in designing a building - be it a
residence, a factory, a school, an office, or a corporate headquarters -
will take into consideration the possible downrange need to expand. For if
the tenant of the premises prospers, the structured interior space of the
original construction may soon be outgrown. If no provision has been made
for easy and orderly expansion, the original site may have to be abandoned,
and a new facility built on adjoining or distant property.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much like the would-be architect using Lincoln Logs or Lego
blocks, and even more like the think-ahead Scrabble player, the architect
of the original lunar outpost will want to leave a number of opportunities
for expansion. His grounded options must provide for changing needs in a
flexible way. "Expand EZ" features will mean minimum disruption and
disturbance of, and other inconvenience to, ongoing operations.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the philosophy behind using multi-port nodes as
air-lock modules, for example. We don't have to give up a point of access
to expand. Spacing of such expansion/access nodes must also be considered.
The module or other pressurized space to be added may or may not be of
comparable size to the starter module or modules. If connecting ports are
arranged at angles to one another, as for example in a cross-T, hex,
octagonal or other radial pattern, this provides more sizing flexibility
than does an initial configuration with expansion ports arrayed side by
side.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Expansion ports should be indifferent to the nature of the
added space: hard-hulled payload bay sized modules brought up from Earth;
"telescoping" or otherwise unfolding hard-hull modules which allow more
usable volume; or inflatable structures. Of these, the cylinder can offer
the same or greater volume than the sphere for the same or lower height.
And the torus offers a more stable footprint as well as room for built-in
features in its "donut-hole" [cf. MMM #50, NOV '91, pp.6-8, "HOSTELS:
Lowering the Threshold to Lunar Occupancy: Part IV, Hostel-Appropriate
Architectures"]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We have recently touched on another topic which will greatly
affect the ease or difficulty of outpost expansion: the manner in which we
apply shielding mass made of regolith. If we apply it directly, a certain
amount of tedious, gingerly delicate, and messy excavation may be necessary
to expose the expansion point decided upon. If we apply our shielding
indirectly, as in a hangar shed arch roof over the outpost site, then this
shielding will not be in our way when we need to expand, and, as a bonus,
the workers effecting the expansion can work in a safer, radiation- and
micrometeorite-free "lee" vacuum under the hangar shed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The layout of the site must also be considered, and we won't
want to pick a site that unduly constricts opportunities for expansion with
too close scenic but in-the-way features like crater walls, rille
shoulders, scarps, etc.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Expansion for what?</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We will want to expand our outpost in a timely fashion to
provide together both more living space and more operations space. In
expanded living space will be additional private quarters for more crew,
more and better furnished common space, more recreational and leisure
space, more space for added life support and food production, even garden
space.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Expanded operations will include: exploration and
in-the-field prospecting, mining, material production, manufacturing,
expanded sample and product testing laboratory, product fabrication
facilities, inside storage, etc. Obviously, reason exists for considerable
expansion, stage by stage.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning for expansion must be flexible. Some of the things
we think we can do and do well enough on the moon may not work out or
present engineering and prerequisite difficulties may mandate putting them
off until later. Other unsuspected opportunities for useful and profitable
activity that can be supported early on will emerge. The exact sequence of
diversification into iron and steel, glass and glass composites, ceramics
and cast basalt, and lunar concrete, should be kept provisional and open to
unfolding realities of need and ability. Expansion must then be both
flexibly preplanned and opportunistic. This is in fact how things unfold on
Earth. It will be no different on the moon.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Addition of "Out-Facilities"</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially, the outpost will be quite compact and integral
with the only peripheral installations being solar arrays and radiators,
antennae, tank storage farms, the space pad, power generation and storage,
etc. But the time will soon come when we will want to move industrial
operations that have passed their field trials out of the 'incubator' space
within the original outpost complex into new, more spacious, and more
rationally designed industrial quarters more or less nearby. Such
industrial space may be connected to the outpost by a pressurized corridor
tube or "cunnicula" of some sort, or it may be accessed, also in shirt
sleeves, by a docking personnel transport coach. However, if the facility
uses a lot of raw materials "mined" at some distance, the whole industrial
operation might better be placed at a suitable site handier to the
source.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Another unconnected complex likely to arise early on is a
"Port Operations" facility at the moon base spacepad site, as the pace of
expansion increases and with it the amount and frequency of traffic between
base and Earth and/or Earth orbit. Additional "exclaves" may be at an
astronomical observatory installation within logistical support range of
the outpost, and even a sort of getaway recreational retreat, say on the
scenic rim of a large not-too-hard-to-reach crater or rille. 'Androgynous'
dock-locks will make such actually separate installations functionally
contiguous allowing easy, safe, and comfortable passage from one to the
other. Keeping pace with all this will be an expanding road network,
reworked as need be to handle more frequent and heavier traffic loads.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Room for Visitors</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, there will be no room or provision for
"non-working" visitors. As the outpost expands, spare quarters for guests
may be set aside (possibly the original, now outmoded crew quarters). Only
as the outpost expands to the point where potential income from visitors
outweighs the "bother" that looking out for them will cause, will a real
ticket-purchasing visitor influx begin. The outpost will then have a
dedicated hotel, a tourist excursion coach, and an itinerary of visitable
sites. And outpost population will have grown quite a bit.</P>

<H2 align=center>Personnel</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>From Scout Crews to Pioneer Settlers</P><P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:kokhmmm@execpc.com">Peter
Kokh</a></P></font>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Expectations from our long-running experiences on Mir should
give us confidence for similar manning and crew rotation patterns on the
moon. In its one-sixth Earth-normal gravity ("sixthweight"), any
physiological deterioration should both proceed more slowly and be
accumulatively less severe than in ambient zero-G. In following this
pattern, we might expect some lunar base personnel to have longer tours of
duty, while other visiting "mission specialists" who have come to oversee
relatively short tests of pilot demonstration processing equipment, for
example, may return to Earth in short order.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several reasons why personnel may rotate at a
slower rate than the rhythm of Earth-moon support and resupply flights
might seem to allow:
<OL>
<LI><P>not bringing replacement personnel frees up allowable net payload
mass for extra badly needed equipment.</P>
<LI><P>not returning personnel makes room for extra "export" cargo from the
moon:</P>
<OL type="a">
<LI><P>lunar liquid oxygen for delivery to LEO to refuel the Earth-moon
ferry</P>
<LI><P>loads of regolith samples for delivery to Earth's surface where
ongoing processing experiments can be done more cheaply and more
thoroughly, i.e. with lower gross man-hour support costs and in better
equipped laboratories.</P>
</OL>

<LI><P>if the lunar descent vehicle is built as we've suggested, with the
crew cabin underslung and equipped with a surface locomotion chassis that
can be winched to the surface and taxi to the outpost, every descent module
that returns crewless means an extra surface vehicle at the disposal of the
outpost.</P>

<LI><P>In general, average on-the-moon labor support costs will come down
as the amount of productive man-hours per ticket of passage goes up.</P>
</OL>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;With all these forces operating to encourage extension of
lunar surface duty times, outpost managers, both on site and on Earth, will
be motivated to provide perks and incentives for voluntary extension of
planned tours of duty. Moon duty will be exciting and prestigious at first,
with no shortage of volunteers. But as duty time wears on, the view out
the window less dominated by Earth, more by sterile, barren, unforgiving,
and lonely moonscapes of colorless grays, lunar base personnel will be glad
to get out of their sardine can quarters, be relieved of their cabin fever,
and return "home."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;From this humble beginning to an era when men and women will
come intent upon staying the rest of their lives is one tremendous jump.
But the long road from limited mission scouts to pioneer settlers starts
right here, with the need on the several counts mentioned above to
encourage voluntary, but still not indefinite, extensions of contracted
duty time.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;People put up with what they have to. If the next
opportunity to "get out of here" is some time off, one grins and bears the
restrictions, the confinement, and the sacrifices with or without a smile.
But if ships are returning to Earth on a regular basis and one's "moon
duty" has already "worn thin," then the desire to be aboard the next ship
home will begin to interfere with one's effectiveness. Perks, extra
amenities, and other incentives to make continued surface duty more
bearable will be absolutely necessary.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay: we start with the obvious: money, the
worthwhile-maker. As duty extensions are cheaper than crew replacement,
some of the "savings" realized are properly shared with those agreeing to
stay on, in terms of higher wage rates. Wages can be sent to one's
Earthside family, or accumulate in a terrestrial bank account. But there
are other forms of compensation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The "re-upper" can be rewarded with "import credits" e.g.
the right to request added momentos, pasttime materials, or favorite food
delicacies to be on the next ship up. One can acquire seniority for bidding
on desireable assignments. One can be admitted to the decision making
councils. One can be granted more "flextime," leeway in personally
scheduling worktime and freetime.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Time off</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical week "vacations" would be a very special perk,
one that the "re-upper" can use to explore in greater depth any hobbies or
interests - experimenting with lunar art/craft materials, dance forms that
go with the grain of sixthweight, exploring and developing confined space
sixthweight sports ideas; music, poetry, literature, and writing articles
for hire reporting on life on the moon. It is important to realize that all
such activity can be indirectly productive for the basehold as a whole if
and in so far as it opens up more possibilities for other personnel to
enjoy their stays.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Attention to ambience</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all the perks should be reserved for those who agree to
duty extensions. By then the psychological damage from unnecessarily
spartan conditions may be irreversible. The outpost can be made both
ergonomic and functionally pleasant at little or no extra weight penalty or
cost simply by thoughtful design. Crew quarters can be individually
decorated, and easily redecorable to suit the tastes of new occupants.
There should be varied and redoable decor in the common areas. There should
be cubbyholes other than one's own cramped berthspace in which to retreat.
Attention should be paid to acoustics so that one has the choice of
background music or silence or his/her own favorite blends.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Rotation of assignments</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what one's specialty, there should be the
opportunity for shot-in-the-arm routine-busting assignments. Those
regularly in the field can be given inside duty for relief. Vice versa,
those stuck in labs and workstations can be given periodic field duty.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Leisure time opportunities</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The outpost should have a good audiovisual and literature
library, in the lightest weight storage form, of course. There should also
be some traditional art and craft media and the opportunity to explore
working with on-site materials. Requests should be honored when feasible
for "time off together" for those wanting to explore dance or sport or
other "exercise" options. There should be "real" opportunities as well for
continuing self-education, personal or occupational, for credit when
desirable.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>A bit of Earth</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Relief duty in the outpost farm, even if nothing but a
compact hydroponics closet operation, will be welcome to most. In addition,
an abundance of well-chosen "house plants" will not only help keep the air
"fresh and sweet," but provide a psychological filter against the barren
and sterile surroundings outvac - especially if arranged in the foreground
of any window or viewing port. Available nooks and crannies can be the
opportunity for "pocket parks," even "forests" of bonsai evergreens.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Water reserves can be put to work as well. Fountains and
wallside waterfalls add both soothing white noise to help drown out the
non-symphonic hums of assorted equipment, and to keep the air comfortable
and rain-fresh. Aquaria can add the further comfort of "wildlife," color,
and visual relief. Another opportunity for "wildlife" will arise once the
outpost "farm" reaches the stage where natural pollination would be
helpful. Bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds are candidates.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarcely anything, however, is more important for morale,
day in and day out, than menu diversity and good tasting food. Bland
nutritional balance is hardly enough - not out of the ivory tower. The
outpost pantry should be kept well-stocked with herbs, spices, and
peppers.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Toward "Social Normalcy"</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The desire of outpost mission planners to control and
otherwise restrict the range of "permissible" social activities will be
strong. On the one hand there is the legitimate desire to have things run
smoothly and discourage behavior that can be disruptive. On the other hand
there is the illegitimate pressure that comes from having the rest of the
world looking over your shoulder with their assorted hangups. The solution
to both has to be a very real degree of privacy with limited and scheduled
public "telepresence" along with a degree of discretion given to on-site
authority. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;While the variety of social interactions will become
measurably more satisfying as basehold population increases from shy of a
dozen towards a hundred or more, nothing should be done to control or
restrict spontaneous sexual liaisons, romances, and relationships so long
as they do not begin to interfere with work or with the morale of the rest
of the personnel. That said, it remains a pretty good truism that
fraternization "at work" is a bad game plan, full of pitfalls and well
documented by horror stories. Nevertheless it happens.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pregnancies will be strongly discouraged at first (cf. the
ABC movie "Plymouth"), and perhaps be reason for early termination of tour.
Yet sooner or later this is a plunge that must be taken. We cannot know for
sure that the moon is a potential long term new home for man until the
second generation of native-born turns out healthy and fertile.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;A more serious potential problem is the development of a
medical condition that would make survival of a trip back to Earth
problematic. It may never happen. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;What to do with someone who has done something unforgiveably
antisocial or outright criminal is an eventuality more likely to occur.
"Out the airlock without a spacesuit" is not an option. Confinement to
quarters (makeshift brig) means a loss of productivity. The alternative may
be to assign the person to undesirable but necessary duties, inside or
outvac. Menu and free time restrictions might be effective penalties. No
amount of prior screening can prevent trouble altogether.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sooner or later someone will die on the moon either by
accident, by sudden illness, or by foul play. Shipment of the remains to
Earth should not be authomatic. The person in question will have signed a
living will which states his or her preferences. Interment on the moon
should be an option. Nor need this mean "burial." If the outpost has a
furnace that can serve as a crematorium, one can specify his/her ashes to
spread inside in the outpost "flower garden" or "pocket park" or outvac in
some chosen or favorite spot. If not, another option is simple surface
interment, under UV-proof glass, otherwise exposed to the vacuum, and the
stars. More than any flag, a burial site makes a place, however desolate,
forever human.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Longer term</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for beginnings. Our humble lunar outpost will have
to number more than a hundred before there is enough diversity of talent,
occupation, opportunity, and social interaction to make indefinite stays
tolerable even for the hearty few.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The mini offspring biosphere with which the frontier
community reencradles itself will have had to become much more massive,
self-regulating, and forgiving before all but the most determined will be
willing to give up ever returning to the lush green hills of Earth. We will
have had to have progressed from outpost-with-houseplants to
biosphere-with-farm-and-farm-village, and a tad of compatible or insulated
industry on the side.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Economically, we will have to be manufacturing on location a
visibly large portion of our needs, particularly expansion shelter and
furnishings. Thriving indigenous arts and crafts will begin to endear
pioneers to their new would-be home and start to add to the list of things
they would have to "give up" were they to return to Earth. When this list
becomes personally more cogent than the list of still missed things they
gave up to come to the moon, the balance will be tipped.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have had to make the commitment to the less direct
productivity of child rearing and retirement. And perhaps these two needs
can take care of each other. Parents can work while retiree "grandparent"
volunteers (with enough energy) can teach and raise the young. In general,
there must be programs to keep all citizens as productive as possible. In
this light, retirement becomes more of a shifting of gears, of switching to
less stressful, more relaxed, less demanding "half-time" assignments.
Besides teaching, administrative paper-pushing duties come to mind. There
will be other things. Everyone must, and must be given a full range of
opportunities to, pull his or her weight in the forever upward struggling
pioneer frontier community.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Population will have to grow too before their will be enough
of a gene pool upon which to base a stable permanent population, if, for
some reason, the traffic from Earth should be cut off, forcing the infant
community to go it alone, hopefully in economic interdependence with other
similarly stranded off-Earth pockets of humanity. While this seems far off,
it is a scenario which has long motivated space supporters. The
journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step. We've tried here to
outline some of these first steps, as well as some other forks in the road
a bit farther along. If it is going to all happen, we will have to
consciously take these steps in a timely fashion.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>R&D Report: #4 - 11/05/95</P>
<P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:kokhmmm@execpc.com">Peter Kokh</a>,
amateur artist</P></font>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;RECAP: This is a "Lunar Arts/Craft" R&D Project aimed at
determining if "paints" suitable for use by artists in a pioneer settlement
can be made entirely from elements recoverable from lunar regolith soil.
The idea is based on the fact that sodium silicate, commonly known as
"waterglass" and a liquid at room temperatures, is the only known inorganic
adhesive. It can be produced from lunar soil, and the basic experiment is
to see if adhesive-based (rather than solvent-based) "paints" can be made
by mixing in colored metal oxide pigments.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The first painting, Moon Garden #1, was produced 9/29/'94
using sodium silicate, titanium dioxide (white), manganese dioxide (black),
ferric iron oxide (rust), chromium oxide (green), and sulfur (yellow) and
combinations of these to produce gray, orange, and pink. The "canvas,"
again picked because it could be produced locally in a lunar settlement,
was glass, painting, foreground first, on the backside.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;An article about the project appeared in the Jan/Feb '95
issue of Ad Astra, pp. 46-7. Since then other pigments have been tried, not
all successfully. The most notable (and costly) addition to the palette
being cobalt aluminate blue.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>The Aging Problem - Worst fears allayed </H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few months, the first two paintings had begun to show
patchy delamination from the back surface of the glass. The prime suspected
culprits were low winter indoor humidity, a film of windex on the glass,
or, worse, a temporary aspect to the adhesive quality of the medium. The
third painting, done in mid-May addressed both the first two concerns. The
pane was baked after cleaning to remove residual windex film. And the air
was now more humid. Six months later, this painting looks much as it did
the day it was produced.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;While this allays the worst fears, that waterglass painting
may turn out to be suitable only for "temporary art," we are not ready to
claim that the problem is solved. This is an experiment, and it is the
nature of experiments that sometimes the desired result is not, even cannot
be, produced. Time alone will tell whether or not this "aging" will
continue, whether or not it can only be postponed, etc. We will not resort
to organic additive "fixatives" because this would invalidate the
experiment.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>New Pigments, methods tried </H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past several months, some new pigments have been
purchased. Iron Sulfide, FeS2 (fool's gold), yielded disappointing results.
Vanadium Pentoxide, which promised a bright golden orange joined the ranks
of three previous "failing" pigments in immediately reacting with the
waterglass and gumming up. Chemicals that had not worked now represented an
investment of well over $200. However, a somewhat crude "work around"
application method promises to recoup some of this investment and expand
the palette. We have succeeded in "flocking" one of these four powders on
glass wet with plain waterglass. Potassium chromate gives us a brighter,
more vivid yellow than the pastel sulfur we've been using so far.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>New paintings, sales, gifts, donations </H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This fall saw three more paintings. "Out the Window"
depicted an oval window in a lunar habitat, looking out on the moonscape
(painted on the reverse side of an 8"x10" pane) with the peripheral
foreground inside the habitat painted on the front side of the glass. It
was donated to Greg Bennett, CEO of the Lunar Resources Company and chief
architect of the Artemis Project - after hanging "NFS" [not for sale] in
the First Contact II art show.  Also in the show, up for bid, was "Earth in
Space" painted on the reverse side of the 8"x10" glass, with however, the
clouds on the front side of the glass to create depth and show that they
were not Earth surface features. This went for $60. A small 5"x7"
demonstration piece, "Moonscape" was donated to the charity auction and
went for $12. The following week, the second painting produced (mid-October
'94) called "Greening the Gray" was donated to the MSDC seed money raffle.
Meanwhile, membership in L.A.A.M.P./subscriptions to semi-annual Moonbow,
crept up to just ten.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Commissions Accepted </H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;To generate more income with which to pay for continued
experimentation, commissions will be accepted for "Earth in Space"
originals painted on backside of 8"x10" glass (clouds front side): black,
white, blues, greens, tans - no two alike, metal frame. $50 includes
explanation of art form, "paints" used, shipping/handling, two issues of
Moonbow. Make payable to the artist and send to the L.A.A.M.P. address
listed at the bottom of the opposite page. Allow 3-4 weeks.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Waterglass-aided Stained Glass Experiment </H4>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope to soon begin diversifying work with waterglass.
Stained glass (art glass) is certainly a viable lunar art-form, materials
wise, with one exception: the "leading" that separtes/joins the individual
colored glass cartoon pieces. What we want to try is cementing these
colored glass pieces, using waterglass as an adhesive, to a host
transparent pane, filling the gaps with a thick paste made of waterglass
and common regolith simulant. The look should be similar enough, and the
heavier pieces will be lighter in lunar gravity. PK

<H2 align=center>Commercial Moonbase Brainstorming Workshop</H2>

<P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:kokhmmm@execpc.com">Peter Kokh</a>, First
Contact II Co-chair</font></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 7th, 1995, at a Science/Science Fiction Convention in
Milwaukee called First Contact II, LRS hosted a three-hour brainstorming workshop
on the "Design Requirements for a Commercial Moon Base." The Lunar Reclamation
Society (NSS-Milwaukee) and Milwaukee Science Fiction Services are joint partners
in this new hybrid convention. Leading the workshop was the special LRS "Doer"
Guest of Honor, Greg Bennett, CEO of The Lunar Resources Company in Houston, and
chief architect of "The Artemis Project." Co-directing the session were Mark
Kaehny and Peter Kokh of LRS. David Burkhead of Spacecub fame also participated.
There were eleven of us altogether.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few general remarks about what we were going to attempt to
do, identify things a first lunar outpost could do to make money, we broke up
into two brainstorming groups (larger groups are unwieldy).</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Group A</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Greg Bennett, Mark Kaehny (group secretary), David Burkhead, Edwin
Reck, and Mark Roth-Whitworth - came up with the suggestions below.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The numbering reflects only the order in which the suggestion was
made - given the limited time, there was no attempt to put these ideas in a
logical order, much less to come up with them in a logical order - brainstorming,
by its very nature, has to be free-ranging and unfettered. The inevitable chaff
can be separated out from the wheat later. The dynamics of group brainstorming is
such that an idea presented "half-baked" by one person, can then be "fully baked"
by others in the group. It is an exciting process.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The contents in square brackets, [ ], are added by the MMM editor,
a non-participant in Group A, and may or may not accurately qualify or reflect
the intent of the suggester.</P>

<LI><P>Space-wear and moon-wear clothing for Ken, Barbie dolls.</P>

</OL>


<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Group B</H3>
<P>Peter Kokh (group secretary), Fred Oesau, David Crawford, Doug Seitz, Jim
Plaxco, and Kevin Crowley.</P>

<P>Whereas Group A concentrated (not exclusively) on money-generating ideas to
get the Artemis Project "on the way," Group B chose to concentrate (again not
exclusively) on money-generating ideas that would apply "once a permanent
occupiable outpost was set up."</P>

<OL>
<LI><P>Testing/tending of prototype feasibility demonstration equipment for
mining operations, beneficiation processes, other processing: e.g. lunar oxygen
production, silane [silicon-based analog of methane] fuel production; iron fine
extraction and sintered iron product manufacturing; i.e. Artemis crew-members
serve as time-share mission specialists for companies hoping to do industrial
business on the Moon.</P> <P>Money would be earned not only from providing
time-share trained labor. Income would also be generated by carrying along
equipment to the Moon, shipping back various processed and manufactured samples,
etc. i.e. renting payload space and mass aboard the Lunar Transfer Vehicle, and
descent/ ascent vehicles.</P>

<LI><P>On-site advertising. More elaborate possibilities than in # 21 above
because of the availability of crew for non-electronic changeouts, as well as
part-time models, actors, etc. The availability of crew also permits greater
latitude in changing the all-important background setting, i.e. in total picture
composition. It allows moving "commercials" as well.</P>

<LI><P>Setting up and tending telescopes and other astronomical installations
(changeout of instrumentation) for university-consortia, etc. This would involve
trained time-share crew as mission specialists, and fees for payload bay space
and weight as in # 1, above.</P>

<LI><P>Teleoperated "working" robot-rovers - Artemis sells minutes/hours for the
right to teleoperate mobile equipment that (a) emplaces regolith shielding over
the habitat complex; (b) grades approaches and aprons, improves landing pad,
etc.; (c) collects dust and rock samples.</P>

<P>Time could be purchased directly, or, seeing that it would be expensive and
eliminate all but the best-heeled of individuals, corporate sponsors (or Artemis
itself) could raffle off the right to teleoperate such equipment, after a minimum
number of hours of simulation training, of course, this included in the package,
so that the actual time would be well spent, both to reward the lucky individual
teleoperator, and to maximize for Artemis the efficiency and safety with which
the needed work gets done. </P>

<P>This concept would not be unlike going on a paid "teleoperated" archeological
or paleontological dig.</P>

<LI><P>We noted that many income opportunities will presuppose that Artemis
planners had picked a visually exciting site with its surroundings, not just a
scientifically exciting one.</P>

<LI><P>Photographic panoramas deserving of being rendered as wall murals
(wallpaper, see Group A, above). This will include one of the Artemis Moonbase
itself, either/both as under construction or/and as completed (phase 1), as well
as various untransformed scenic vistas in the area.</P> <P>Some of these murals
could be available for open reproduction, others sold in limited sets of 100 to
generate high individual auction/bid prices.</P>

<LI><P>Telerobotic lessons sold separately to qualify winners of teleoperation
time. See # 4, above.</P>

<LI><P>$100 million lottery - winner to be trained as time-share mission
specialist along on the first, or second mission.</P>

<LI><P>Teleoperable manufacturing equipment to be engineered by rival competing
engineering teams pro bono - the carrot reward being the right to get a
percentage return or royalty on income generated by the teleoperated device for
the its operational lifetime.</P>

<LI><P>Entertainment pay-per-view TV produced on site, capitalizing on eerie
effects of 1/6th gravity: one or two person ballet performances (doable on a
small set); midget sumo wrestling (our apologies to the Little People or those of
Japanese descent to whom our fun suggestion is offensive); once a bigger "gym" is
available, Lunar Jai Alai.</P>

<LI><P>Made, or hand-selected on Moon artifacts, coins, jewelry. Cut and polished
breccia broaches or ring stones. Sintered iron coins to be polymer coated against
rust on arrival on Earth. Items made of glass spherules. Necklace glass capsules
half-filed with common regolith moon dust.</P>

<P>Weightier and thus much more expensive: sinter-cast block which bears your own
footprints, made on the Moon with a casting or your very own foot/feet or
shoe(s)/boot(s). Sinter-cast blocks with custom Valentine-type message.</P>

<LI><P>Selling Names: of modules and parts of modules of the outpost and lunar
descent vehicle. e.g. the John Doe porthole, the Jane Doe Hall (meetings, TV
studio, dance hall, gym, Jai Alai court, etc. multi-use larger volume hard hull
module or inflatable.</P>

<P>Also getting corporations to pay for additional mods or upgraded interiors of
planned modules - all for the ad value = e.g. "furnished by Apollo interiors, of
city, state."</P>

<LI><P>Repository for cremation ashes. This can be under the open star-spangled
sky, UV-protected by a glass pane.</P>

<LI><P>Biological Quarantine Facility for sample all-but-extinct pathogens and
toxins too dangerous to be kept indefinitely at the Contagious Disease Control
Center in Atlanta. An associated lab could be a follow-on.</P>

<LI><P>3D computer-controlled variable mold stamping device which will render
your footprints/handprints and a photo of same on the Moon, in an area to be set
aside not ever to be re-disturbed. Different from # 11 (second paragraph)
above.</P>

<LI><P>Lunar Spaceport Beacon which can flash messages (commercial ad or personal
[monitored] for a high fee) in Morse code when visible from Earth during local
Moonbase nightspan.</P>

<LI><P>Along the same line, experiments in local nigthtspan fireworks and light
shows to be paid for by sponsors on Earth for very large terrestrial audiences on
special occasions.</P>

<LI><P>Afterthought on # 11 jewelry ideas above. For necklaces, glass spheres
with actual lunar vacuum (glass is stronger under compression)</P>

<LI><P>Actual Signatures on the Moon: Artemis would sell the right (and small
space) to write/engrave your signature on various pieces of structural or
operating hardware</P>

<OL type="a"> 

<LI>to land temporarily on the Moon = cheaper

<LI>be part of the permanent outpost installation. This idea is attractive
because it does not add to the weight or cost of the hardware to be landed on the
Moon.

<LI>A much less expensive option would be to take along your signature in
microfiche or electronic form.

</OL></OL>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Reflections on the Workshop</H4> 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;As I had guaranteed Greg Bennett as we were about to start, this
process was sure to come up with many ideas that have already been thought of in
previous Artemis Project brainstorming sessions, but also certain to come up with
some new ideas previous groups had not thought of, or at least new variations.
Afterwards, Greg assured me that the Workshop had delivered as promised. All
participants found the exercise very stimulating and the high point of their
convention.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In Houston and in Huntsville, the ideas outlined above will be
merged with the results of previous marketing and income generating brainstorm
sessions.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional ideas? Please send them to "Marketing & Income Ideas",
ASI, PO Box 4878, Huntsville, AL 35815.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the fourth in a series of Mission Control Workshops
hosted by the Lunar Reclamation Society. The first, at the ISDC '93 in
Huntsville, dealt with three diverse Asteroid Base scenarios. The following ISDC
'94 in Toronto, we hosted a four-group workshop on Tourism in Space. At the
maiden First Contact Science/Science Fiction Convention in Milwaukee in 1994, our
workshop dealt with Seafloor analogs of Lunar and Space Outposts (with special
"Doer" Guest of Honor Dennis Chamberland of the League of New Worlds).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workshop topic for next year's First Contact has been narrowed

final selection dependent on the availability of potential "Doer" GoHs.</P>

Letter From the President
</h2><P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:boise@asi.org">Boise Pearson</a>,
President, Artemis Society International</Font></P>


<font size=2><P>NOTE: Candace Dicks <A href="mailto:cddicks@aol.com">&lt;CDDicks@aol.com&gt;</a> is now organizing Technical Committees</P></font><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target="_top" href="../090/how-you-can-help.html">Last month</a> we
heard from Pat Bennett about her efforts to organize the membership of <a
target="_top"  href="/asi_index.html">Artemis Society International</a> into Technical
Committees. She has received quite a response to her request for
volunteers, and the Technical Committees are starting to take shape. This
month we feature an article about the first Committee to be organized, the
Simulation Technical Committee. Look for future articles about the fun
projects these Committees are taking on to make the <a
target="_top" href="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a> happen.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Participating Online</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We are finding that one of the toughest challenges we face
is efficiently communicating about the Artemis Project. The <a target="_top" href="/adb/09/03/artemis-list.html">artemis-list</a> email discussion group
has grown so large that we're working on a breakup of the discussion group
by topic, possibly in Usenet News format. For the time being, we've added
a daily digest service, concatenating all of the day's messages into a
single email message. This should help alleviate mailbox clutter,
reducing the number of mail messages to one per day.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;To join the email discussion group, send an email message to
<a href="mailto:server@LunaCity.com">&lt;server@LunaCity.com&gt;</a>, with
the body of your message being, "join artemis-list".</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;To receive the email discussion in digest form, send an
email message to <a
href="mailto:server@LunaCity.com">&lt;server@LunaCity.com&gt;</a>, with the
body of your message being, "join artemis-digest".</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the communications challenges is presenting the
Artemis Project to people who are interested, without overwhelming them.
The Project encompasses so many ideas and disciplines, it is hard for a
newcomer to grasp it all at once. To help address this concern, we are
redesigning the WWW site to provide a more orderly introduction to the
Project for newcomers, and easy access to information for those already
involved. The new web site will include information on the technical
committees and how to join in on the fun, local and international chapters,
and current projects. Keep an eye out for the changes, and let us know
what you think.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Dual Entitlements to MMM and ASI dues</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there has been some question about subscription
and membership rates from people who are members of ASI, but already
receive MMM from another source. For those who already receive MMM, ASI
team <a target="_top" href="/asi_member.html">membership</a> dues are reduced from
$25/year to $15/year.</P>

Simulation for the Artemis Project
</h2><P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:m.bennett30@genie.com">by Michael H.
Bennett</a>, Simulation Technical Committee Chairman</P></font>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Simulations are computer programs which model or mimic the
behavior of physical systems. They are used to predict or explore capabilities
and limitations. With simulations, we can train pilots without leaving the
ground, or test parts or components which haven't even been developed yet.
Throughout the Artemis Project, simulations will be developed and used to verify
designs, analyze mission parameters, provide training for astronauts, educate the
public, and generate revenue.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Mission Statement</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of the Simulation Technical Team of the Artemis
Society International is to support all phases of the Artemis Project with
accurate, timely, and cost-effective simulations. The types of simulations fall
into four basic categories:

<UL type=square> 
<LI><P><B>Unit engineering simulations</B> -- accurate
simulations of a single part of an Artemis vehicle. These simulations are most
useful during the design process, and allow the development team to analyze
numerous options before committing to a final design.</P>

<LI><P><B>Multi-unit engineering simulations</B> -- simulations which analyze the
interaction of two or more systems. These simulations are also used during the
design process, to find possible problems due to interaction of systems which,
taken separately, function adequately. An example would be discovering that a
fuel pump could not provide sufficient fuel to the engine to permit operation at
maximum thrust.</P>

<LI><P><B>Training Simulators </B>-- used to familiarize personnel with the
operation of complex equipment. Training systems are highly dependent upon the
final design of the equipment. For the Artemis Project, the training simulators
will utilize inputs from engineering simulations to minimize system development
costs.</P>

<LI><P><B>Entertainment simulations</B> -- simulations which provide
entertainment value, whether passive or interactive. These include virtual
reality, ridefilms, video games, and flight simulators. 
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a target="_top" href="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a> provides a unique opportunity for simulation
development. As a systems engineer, I relish the chance to work on a project like
this from the very beginning. By applying the best techniques of software
engineering now, at the beginning, we will be able to minimize development costs
in the future without sacrificing accuracy.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;By maintaining a consistent approach over the development of all
simulations during the project, we will reduce the amount of redevelopment which
commonly occurs on similar projects. We will find it easy to reuse "parts" of
previously written programs for the training devices which we develop.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Inputs to simulations from technical groups will provide the tools
to model the complex systems of the Artemis Project, from mission trajectories to
LTV [<a href="/adb/04/02/01/" target="_top">Lunar Transfer Vehicle</a>] design parameters. In return, the Simulation
Technical Committee will provide the analyses which enable the engineers to
improve their designs. We will teach the astronauts to fly, to ensure that they
are safe and confident. Our simulations will help create the entertainment
necessary to fund the Artemis Project, through virtual reality "tours,"
ridefilms, video games and flight simulators, all based on the real spacecraft
under development. Through all this, we will help to inspire the public, and open
their eyes to the endless possibilities.</P>

 Artemis Society of Houston meeting, October 24, 1995.</p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;David Brummel demonstrated the <a target="_top"
href="http://www.io.com/~dbrummel/ash/ash.html">web site</a> he coded for the
Artemis Society of Houston. It will be installed in the ASI domain with links
from the introductory Artemis Society material. The main entry point to the
Artemis Project on the World Wide Web is <a
href="http://www.asi.org/">http://www.asi.org/</a>.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We reviewed copies of the new fact sheets and membership cards
from Duncan Graphics. The fact sheets are hard to reproduce -- high-quality
printing is needed to reproduce the backgrounds properly -- but the result is
very readable and impressive. The text of the <a href="/adb/j/index.html" target="_top">Frequently Asked Questions</a> and
<a target="_top" href="/adb/j/fro_index.html">Frequently Raised Objections</a> fact sheets needs to be better organized before
doing massive print runs</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The membership ID was not well-received; it's too large and looks
like an ID badge instead of a membership card. The concensus at ASH was that the
membership card should be the size of a credit card. Separate photo ID badges
would have lots of uses, but should be a bit smaller and the person's name should
be printed much larger.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave a briefing on where Angus Bay is, and how it got its name.
This was essentially a presentation of the story I posted to artemis-list a few
days ago. Larry Friesen objected to changing the name of Mare Anguis ("Sea of
Snakes"), but no one could present an argument for preserving silly names of
places just to appease a bureaucracy.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The main question before the Artemis Society of Houston now,
besides working with ASI HQ to establish the paperwork for chartering local
groups, is to select a project or two on which we can concentrate our
efforts.</P>

<h3 align=center>Thanks, Artemis!</h3>
<P align=center>9/29/95</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember, as a kid, watching "Space: 1999" and dreaming of someday living and working on the moon. I could conveniently forget that they were blasted out of orbit by a nuclear explosion on the lunar surface. I would someday be an engineer or a scientist and help to develop the moon into a habitable place for humans to live. The planets call out to us, and in my childhood innocence, I believed that the moon was the perfect connecting node en route to our solar neighbors.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, like a lot of my friends, I grew up and found out that colonizing the moon was just a pipe dream to encourage kids to learn science and math. So, I settled for just becoming a plain, vanilla, moon-walking-wanna-be, engineer/scientist.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But lo, just when I thought all hope was lost for access to the moon, what should I come across, but a home page for the Artemis Project. I want to thank you guys for making a dent in my attitude about living on the moon. I have actually changed the direction of my life because of your project.</P>

<H2 align=center>Rethinking the Moon Buggy</H2><P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Reflections from <a
href="mailto:amon@walt.music.qub.ac.uk">Dale Amon</a></FONT>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would want to [build new lunar rovers from the old
Apollo era plans]??? By today's standards the electronics on that thing are
a science fair project....</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Replace the frame with composites from Scaled Composites.
The electric motors will be a fraction of the size and weight because
magnet materials have improved vastly since then. Storage technology has
not improved by as great a degree but still, it has advanced. We'll have
commercial micro-machine accelerometers on the market soon, so the
navigation hardware will be built right onto the chip with the electronic
interface. The comm gear has shrunk to nearly nothing. Compare a walkie
talkie in a '60s' era Edmund Scientific catalog with what you can pick up
down at your local Tandy Radio Shack. R/C toys have better radio equipment
than some of those '60s' comm units....</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, most importantly of all - we know the environment
it is to work in and have those old rovers, their problems and performance
as an initial data point. And that data point is basically that it is no
big deal building one. They are a piece of kit that a hobbyist could
successfully build. It doesn't take an aerospace company to build an
electric dune buggy.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a bit of caution on vacuum, a bit of thought on rad
hardening, a bit of care on temperature range...  And you needn't bother
about outgassing of your materials. They'll never be inside your breathing
space so who cares? That makes it a lot easier.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and some care in packaging may be required to ensure it
isn't damaged by the vibration. I remember ruining a tire on my DT400 by
not tying the tire down when hauling it in a trailer behind my car. Tire
spun from the vibration and wore the nobbies bald...</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>From Rovers to Cycles - Human Power</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;While walking home recently one night I remembered some
thoughts I had on lunar rovers a number of years back. There will be a need
for different sorts of vehicles, and undoubtedly large hauling vehicles,
whenever they are required, will need a good power source. Whether that be
fuel cell, battery, solar power, beamed power or some mix I won't go into
here. But the type of vehicle needed for a small, relatively self-sufficient
group should have a number of characteristics that few of the designs in
the literature ever consider.</P>

<UL type=square>
<LI><P>The motive source should be 100% field repairable preferably with
only a few tools and simple spare parts.</P>

<LI><P>Spare parts should be such that they can be manufactured locally
from small amounts of raw materials.</P>

<LI><P>The vehicle should have a fail safe criteria that it can bring the
driver home under almost any circumstances in which the driver is still
capable of driving.</P>

<LI><P>It must use indigenous energy supplies.</P>
</UL>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now if you look at these requirements through the 
old-fashioned NASA eyes, you will come up with a billion dollar project. If you
look at it with the eyes of an engineer, you immediately come to the
conclusion that a human powered vehicle is just the ticket.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Research backs this up. In a Scientific American issue on
Human Powered Vehicles a number of years ago, an article on bicycles had an
extra data point for the performance of a vehicle on the moon. A racing
biker, with no air resistance and 1/6 g could break 1000km/h in sprints. A
normal, healthy person could cruise at over 100km/h all day, and could
easily pull a trailer load at the equivalent of typical Earth-bound auto
driving speeds.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The form of the vehicle is the recumbent bicycle like that
used by Stephen K. Roberts (Computing Across America). And in fact, he would
probably be the best person to speak to on the design of a lunar rover. He
crossed the USA from end to end several times on his recumbent, traveling
up and down through the Rockies, keeping up reasonable highway speeds -
and all the while with a trailer that included solar power gathering and a
satellite uplink so he could type on the keyboard in front of him (while
peddling) and submit articles to magazines that funded his journeys. He
also had navigation and maps built into his console processor. I don't
think there is anything that a lunar rover built for days of unsupported
prospecting would need that he didn't do 5-6 years ago.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, that is not to say there aren't issues unique to the
moon. There is the issue of traction and off-road travel, which will drive
the gearing ratios, axle loading, weight and balance, and wheel design.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Braking will have to be dynamic, feeding the energy back
into a dynamo. Normal friction brakes are a bad idea for two reasons - 1)
The abrasiveness of the regolith. 2) Brake cooling is purely by radiation
to the background and conduction through the frame. Radiators are a problem
as has been suggested before; and since I expect the frame to be
composites, conduction is not very good either.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Gears and chains and deraileurs will have to be very robust
and spares will be required. A design that can be field welded would be a
good idea. Better to trade off a bit of elegance and performance for field
maintainability. These parts can be built very ruggedly (I'm not talking
about racing bikes here!!) and would need to be able to withstand the
rigours of large temperature swings and abrasive particles. One could seal
them, but then it is more difficult to field strip. And not to mention
which, without herculean efforts the lunar grit will get in anyway. If
anyone out there was in Desert Storm... </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area of concern is space suit cooling. The loads
will not be excessive under normal cruising since the peddling is only
enough to replace frictional losses.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of a small motor like that in a minibike could solve a
number of problems (if they don't add too much complexity on their own).
The motor could be the means by which braking returns energy to storage.
Energy can be recovered on downhill stretches and used to ease uphill
travel. It also can reduce the heat loading on the space suit during
acceleration from a standing start, or indeed any acceleration under load.
The motor would, of course, need to be built such that it can be
disconnected from the system entirely if it fails. The overall system
would have to be able to get the lunan back home regardless. So think of it
only as a luxury item on the bike.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The suit would be a live-in suit, so that puts some extra
design load on it. You might have to do better than a diaper if you're
going to be out for a week.... But this is a problem that needs to be solved
anyway. The Stars Wars rovers that some NASA scenarios show us are not
going to be feasible on any realistic budget, and in any case you'd only be
able to afford one of them for the same price as giving every lunan their
own personal lunabike.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems wholly superior to any rover concept I've yet to
see. Just about anyone out there could have run circles around the Lunar
Rover and been out 20 km and back before it was barely out of sight of the
LEM...</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, you say, bikes are good on highways, but off-road you're
going to want a trike! The lunar surface has huge areas that are much like
beaches and dunes. Covered with hardpacked fine regolith that follows the
contours of the land in a very smooth and gentlly rolling fashion. This is
not to say that crater rims and such are quite the same - but large tracts
of the moon should be easily negotiable.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;As to bike vs. trike, there is no inference above, of a two
wheel design - in fact I believe the recumbents are usually trikes. At
least the Robertson one that I saw in 1989 was... DA</P>

<FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:kohkmmm@expc.com">Peter Kokh</a></FONT>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds delightfully low-tech, doesn't it? Tired and stressed
out after a long day's work in your lunar office, mine, or factory? Just
don your out-vac trike suit and head for the airlock and get some heal-all
unwinding exercise! Reminds me of an Arthur C. Clarke story where the
hero does a kangaroo-lope to safety 600 km across Mare Imbrium in just a
spacesuit.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The question arises: without an open air heat sink, where
does all the body heat generated by such exertion go? An out-vac triking
suit needs not only to be self-contained (in RV-camper-trailer talk that
means "with toilet"), but able to handle/shed internally-generated heat,
and perspiration as well. That also means being able to keep the wearer
from getting a chill soaked in his/her own sweat once the exertion is over.
Perhaps the suit's insulation material could be an eutectic salt in a quilt
of pocket cells, melting to absorb internally-generated heat, solidifying
to release it - automatically, on demand. PK</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Or Perhaps a "Buppet" Bike</H3>
<FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:pchapman@bix.com">Phil Chapman</a><BR>
[* Buppet: etym. from Body Puppet, on the analogy of Muppet from Mitten
Puppet.<BR>
Note: "buppet" is the editor's word, not the writer's]</font>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Having tried both [an EVA suit and a diver's dry suit], let
me tell you that a pressurized conventional spacesuit is much more
restricting than a drysuit.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Spacesuit design has been hampered by thinking of it only as
a garment. It is also a small space vehicle. A conventional suit is no
place to be for more than a few hours. For longer durations, you need to be
able to pull your arms in so that you can scratch, or eat, or sleep, or
void. This suggests that the lunabike should be integrated with the suit --
in other words, the suit would be a light-weight pressurized canister with
wheels (4, for stability), with a shirt-sleeve internal environment for
pedaling and living. The canister would be equipped with pressurized
gloves, waldoes or other attached tools for manipulating the external
environment.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be necessary to carry a conventional suit, donnable
inside the canister, so that you could get out and get under if something
broke, or go climb that cliff over there (where, as Arthur Clarke has told
us, The Sentinel is waiting), or, in extremis, walk home. For routine use,
(such as getting from one pressurized dome to another) the mobile canister
alone might be sufficient. The real safety reason for carrying a
conventional suit is to avoid potentially fatal single-point failure modes,
an objective that might be met by careful design of the canister/bike
alone. PC

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>No, what we need is a Volkscycle!</H3>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Response from <a
href="mailto:amon@walt.music.qub.ac.uk">Dale Amon</a> to <a
href="mailto:pchapman@bix.com">Chapman</a>'s suggestion</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;[What I have in mind is an outvac cycle that fits every
lunan's budget. So] the bike must be mostly buildable from local materials
with simple tools and basic stock materials; all systems required for it to
function as transport must be field repairable. Simplicity. Something a
back yard mechanic can build and repair - exclusive of the electronics, of
course - but there should be no electronics that are absolutely required
for the bike to operate. Electronics must be something that is bolted on
and if necessary unbolted and tossed into a crater to lighten the
load.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The minute part of the design requires a special tool or
material, my design criteria demands that that element be discarded from
consideration. Simple. Indigenous. Independent.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Human-Powered Moon Trike<BR>
Call for a Technology Demo
for ISDC '98 - Milwaukee</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the more ambitious goals outlined in the plan for
ISDC '98 - Milwaukee is to present a number of low budget ($100-$5,000)
technology demonstrations of tidbits of technology that will be needed, or
useful on the space frontier, and which should not take that much money to
demonstrate.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;A human-powered Moon Trike is such a possibility. Because
gravity is only 1/6th Earth-normal, but momentum remains full Earth-normal,
to prevent tipping, the vehicle should have a very wide track, wheels that
lean into turns, and a low center of gravity (hence a recumbent rider
position seems ideal). Any interested group should attempt to find its own
industrial and corporate sponsors, advisors, project managers, etc. and
register their effort with

<BLOCKQUOTE>ISDC '98 - Milwaukee,<BR>
P.O. Box 2102,<BR>
Milwaukee WI 53201</BLOCKQUOTE>
 which will attempt to provide advice and assistance.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Introduction to Space:<BR> the Science of Spaceflight</H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>By Thomas D. Damon, 2nd Edition 1995<BR> 278 pp., Paper, $29.50,
Krieger Publishing Co.<BR> PO Box 9542, Melbourne, FL 32902<BR> ISBN
0-89464-053-5</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most frustrating problems for space advocates not
technically oriented is understanding some of the more sophisticated scientific
and mathematical principles underlying the efforts we are promoting. Many space
advocates, like myself, are liberal arts majors who took some basic math and
science courses but are not familiar with many topics whose understanding is
needed to fully comprehend the technical aspects of our space program.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas D. Damon was associated with Pike's Peak Community College
in Colorado Springs when it was decided that it would be appropriate to offer a
general space education course for liberal arts students. A search was made for
an appropriate text book and, having found none, a decision was made to produce
such a volume. According to the author, materials for the text book were
assembled from a collection of NASA pamphlets, contractor reports, government
publications, and sections from other basic science books.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The resulting work is now in its second edition and has become a
book of real substance. The most difficult subject for most, mathematics, is
dealt with in a novel and helpful way. Throughout the book, a series of twenty
separate sections (Math Boxes) are included at appropriate points. The Math Boxes
are written at a basic algebra level and are used to introduce mathematical
concepts to the nonmathematical text. This arrangement is for those who wish to
pursue a more technical understanding of the scientific concepts contained in the
book. These Math Boxes present the most fundamental space mechanics and space
science concepts at a level that is quite easily understood by a liberal arts
college graduate.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The book begins with a chapter briefly summarizing the history of
the space program from the first Chinese rockets through the flights of the space
shuttle. Following are three chapters devoted to the science of propulsion,
orbital mechanics, and the problems of functioning in the space environment. The
space environment chapter discusses those issues which must be dealt with if man
is to survive in an environment beyond the protection of the Earth's
atmosphere.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth through seventh chapters discuss the satellites commonly
used in Earth orbit. Covered are communication, remote sensing, weather, space
power, and military reconnaissance satellites. One of the major organizational
changes in the second edition is the incorporation of the space ballistic missile
defense chapter into the application satellites section. This obviously reflects
a decreased emphasis on the ballistic threat from the [former] Soviet Union.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Also included in the application satellite section is a thorough
discussion of astronomy from space. The Apollo program is described as are the
unmanned planetary probes that have provided us with so much new information on
the planets and moons of our solar system. The space telescope and the other
Earth orbiting observatories are also briefly discussed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapters eight to ten are devoted to discussions of the manned
space program. An entire chapter covers the design and operations of the space
shuttle. Following that are two chapters discussing the subjects of living and
working in Earth orbit. A substantial amount of detail is provided concerning the
questions arising from man's long-term exposure to micro-gravity. Also covered in
detail are the possible practical applications of the micro-gravity near vacuum
conditions available in lower orbit.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapters eleven and twelve include the issues relating to the
operations of Earth-orbiting space stations and the potential for colonies on
other worlds. There is a final chapter on the possibilities of extraterrestrial
life and the efforts to determine whether such life exists.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The book is a valuable contribution to the literature of space
flight. It succeeds, in that it brings together in one volume, at a level that is
easily comprehended by the intelligent layman, all the scientific topics that are
of significance to space advocates. It certainly is not a book that one is likely
to sit down and read, cover to cover. However, as issues arise with which there
is a need to become more familiar, the book will always be available to provide
the required information. It is the only volume of which I am aware that fulfills
such a role. It certainly deserves a place on every space advocate's book shelf.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>December 1995 - Mir Watching, and Listening</H4>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The C.I.S. manned space station Mir with Mir-20 (call sign
'Uran') Cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko, Sergei Avdeyev and Thomas (DF4TR /
DP0MIR) Reiter and will be appearing in the mid west morning skies November
19th to December 6th and return to the evening skies December 15th to Jan.
6th.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Amateur radio operators can log into the Mir 'Packet'
(R0MIR-1) BBS on 145.550MHz simplex or 435.775MHz uplink / 437.775 downlink
MHz. The cosmonauts also use the freq. 145.200MHz up and 145.800MHz down
or 435.725MHz up / 437.925MHz down or 145.550Mhz simplex to talk with
amateur radio operators on the ground during their off-hours.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;For exact times and locations to see the space station over
your backyard call MN MIRWATCH Coordinator Ben Huset at (612) 639-9109.
Look for MIRWATCH and other great space stuff on my web page at <a
href="http://www.skypoint.com/~benhuset/">http://www.skypoint.com/~benhuset/

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Onboard Mir - EUROMIR '95 Mission</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is an automatic recording from the Crew of the Mir
Space Station and the STS-74. The U.S. shuttle Atlantis, the STS-74 has
docked on time, around 09:30 onboard time. It was an excellent docking. We
almost didn't feel anything on the station, Ken Cameron was piloting the
Aircraft excellent and we are now waiting for the hatch opening and to
welcome the crew. Bye Bye." --- DP0MIR Thomas Reiter.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to Dave, N1PPP for this report.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas Reiter has spent some of his time looking for amateur
radio parts, connectors, adaptors, manuals and cables aboard Mir. He has
soldered some makeshift cables after concluding that the cables were not
to be found. STS-74 brought up the rest of the 'missing' parts. He hopes
to have the 'new' 440 MHz radios working soon.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Extra days and Extra walk</B>: An agreement has been
reached between ESA and the Russian RSC-Energia, that the EUROMIR 95
mission will now last until February 29, 1996. To make use of this extra
time up to 70 kg of payload will be uploaded in the next Progress flight,
now scheduled for December 15th, 1995 and Thomas Reiter will conduct a
second "Space Walk" around mid February 1996.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Problem</B>: Sometime on November 1st, the Mir
experienced a leak in an internal cooling loop. This loop is part of the
Kvant/Core module core system cooling loop. Approximately 1.8 liters of
37% solution Ethylene glycol leaked internal to the Mir volume. Loss of
the use of this loop disabled the regenerative CO<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>
removal system and one of the oxygen replenishing systems. The Mir then
used a backup scrubber similar to the shuttle LiOH system for CO<FONT
SIZE=1>2</FONT> removal. The leak was found and repaired a few days later
with 'a putty like substance'. STS-74 brought up 30 shuttle LiOH canisters
and a rapidly developed adaptor (just like Apollo 13) to convert shuttle
canisters to the Mir system. I haven't heard WHY we didn't just bring up
more RUSSIAN-made LiOH canisters.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;STS-74 was launched at 6:30:43 CST on '95 Nov 12. Atlantis
left pad 39A on the second attempt; the Nov 11 attempt was scrubbed at
T-5 min due to bad weather at the transAtlantic abort sites. Atlantis
docked with Mir at 00:27:39 CST on Nov 15. By 00:36 the latches on the APDS
docking system were closed and the Docking Module was firmly attached to
Kristall. The hatches to Mir were opened at about 3 am CST.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>They all look alike in those blue jumpsuits</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The STS-74 welcoming ceremony on Mir was high-lighted by
NASA HQ representative Wil Trafton (head of the ISS program) congratulating
the wrong Russian cosmonaut! As he greeted them, he gave best wishes to
"Ken Cameron, as commander of the Atlantis, and cosmonaut Solovyev, as
com-ander of the Mir". Solovyev, of course, had returned to Earth two
months earlier and the current commander is Gidzenko.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many gifts were exchanged by the Mir-20 and STS-74 crews.
The one I liked the most was the folding electronic guitar from the STS-74
crew to all future Mir and Alpha residents.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Story Updates</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop! Thief!! A report of a burglary at the home of
astronaut Bonnie Dunbar was filed in October. Here is a short list of the
items taken: All four of her Space Flight medals with her name engraved 
on the back. A Seiko watch flown on all four of her flights with her name 
and the first three flight numbers engraved on the back. A watch 
presented to her aboard the Mir Space Station by the crew of Mir-18. It 
is from the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. Very, very rare. Ron 
Sega's Space Flight medal. She also mentioned that the thieves took 
anything and everything that looked like jewelry along with. She fears 
that most of it may have been melted down by now.</P>

<P>&nbsp;From: Dunbar, Bonnie<BR>
&nbsp;RE: Lost Mementos<BR>
&nbsp;Thursday, October 26, 1995 3:36PM</P>
<P><I>&nbsp;Thank you very much for your help. Please feel free to contact
me or Detective Barton at 713-474-4471 if you need information or find
anything. There is a $1000 reward from crime fighters (?) and a $500 reward
from myself for information leading to an arrest and conviction. Again,
thank you.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie Dunbar </I></P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Missed it by that much?</H4>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;NASA astronaut Scott Parazynski had been forced to quit 
his training for a MIR mission because he does not fit the
'standard' Soyuz seat. Now an 'Izvestiya' article Oct 18, '95, pp 1-2 by
Sergey Leskov, reported Russian space officials 'unofficially' saying,
'the Americans, who are paying for the joint project, have recently started
talking to us in a bass voice, in a commandeering tone. We took umbrage,
decided to show our character, and punished our partner, who forgot
himself, for his disrespectful attitude. If there had been friendship,
there would not have been anthropometry'.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I've heard rumors of this type of behavior by previous
astronauts in Moscow but didn't mention it here and had hoped that the
'problems' had been worked out. Hey guys, Straighten up and fly right!!!</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Congratulations to Jennifer L. Green and Friends and
Partners in Space Organization on their Memorandum of Understanding with
the Aerospace College of Moscow State Aviation Institute on joint Internet
web pages and workshop projects. BH</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>"Space Activist"</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anyone who uses his or her talents to the best of his or her
ability to promote and hasten the realization of an open space frontier."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This means anything! - as a writer of general or textbook
non-fiction, or of hard science fiction, screen plays, poetry, even "filk" songs;
as an editor, publisher, book-seller; as a speaker or event organizer or
exhibitor; as a teacher or curriculum planner; as an artist or model maker; as an
actor, director, or producer; as a merchant; as an engineer, chemist, researcher
in biospherics or experimental agriculture or as a space architect; as an
entrepreneur or venture capitalist; as a lawyer. All these roles, and many more
faceless support tasks, are the essence of either of public outreach in depth, or
of laying concrete foundations, or both.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are far more menu options than those amongst us concerned
only with political action would have us believe. We are more than letter and
check writers, more than phone dialers. We are the people who would move off
planet out onto the space frontier. We do it best by each doing our own thing as
well as we can, not by doing solely what someone else would have us do to pursue
some smaller vision.</P>


<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>"Open" Space Frontier</H3> 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"A future in which people of all walks of life have access to, and
live, work, and play in various settings off Earth."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The NSS Mission Statement reads: "to promote change in social,
technical, economic, and political conditions to advance the day when people will
live and work in space, through public education, political and local chapter
activism, and the publication of the bi-monthly Ad Astra Magazine."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The NSS "Mission-centered goal: by 2010: human settlement in space
with 25 people, launch costs under $50/lb to orbit, and space-generated revenues
of $60 billion."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This reflects crucial influence of former L5 Society members who
chose to stay on board at the time of the L5 - National Space Institute merger in
1987 which created NSS.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;As NSS seems overtly preoccupied with reacting to one crisis after
another in which political pressures would erode the current socialized space
program (in the direction of no program at all) it might seem to the unfamiliar
outside observer that NSS' sole purpose is to promote the continuance of the
government's "closed" frontier policy ("astronauts only, government outposts
only, scientific activities only") in effect since the dawn of the Space Age with
Sputnik in 1957. The NSS Board, however, is firmly on record in support of an
"open" frontier. Given its preoccupation, however, it is clear that the rest of
us must work that much harder at strategies that Open the Frontier - outside NSS,
if need be.</P>


<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>"Commercial Space"</H3> 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"any for-profit endeavor or enterprise which increases the amount,
scope, feasibility, and/or sustainable economic viability of robotic and/or human
presence in Earth orbit and beyond."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;One might get the idea from many space activists that commercial
space means private launch companies and small satellite manufacturers - only!
Even if this is qualified with an "at this stage of the game" this short list
betrays a troubling lack of imagination, coming as it does, from people who say
they want to live somewhere other than on Earth!</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;While it may be easier, and safer, to restrict one's ambitions to
the "toy space" of microsats and small launchers, our goal is to create a
self-sustaining human economy beyond Earth's atmosphere. This clearly requires
commercial entry into man-rated rockets and habitat hardware. This has already
begun. The for-profit SpaceHab shuttle payload bay module is already a reality,
but has faced a rocky road.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Early plans for commercial tourist modules were ill-fated because
they depended either on paper study spacecraft, or upon the government owned
shuttle. Any effort to piggyback commercial for-profit activity on
profit-be-damned agency programs is at the mercy of political pressures and
bureaucratic procedures - hardly a place to put dearly acquired capital.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many put all their hopes on the X-33 program. But the dream of
Cheap Access from NASA seems troublingly self-deceptive. Meanwhile, would-be
commercial players stall.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We clearly need commercial manned access to space. Yet the very
presence of the shuttle system works in a highly preemptive manner to prevent
such access from materializing. What is needed is to tie in with a commercial
manned destination: a commercial space station. With the adoption for the
International Space Station Alpha of the high inclination orbit favored by the
Russians, there has never been more reason than now for an alternative, a
commercial station-depot in a low inclination orbit vastly superior as a staging
and refueling place for deep space missions. Alpha would serve moon and Mars
missions at a severe handicap in comparison. There will also be need in orbit for
more lab space at commercial disposal than ISSA can or will provide.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to dust off the "Space Cartage Act" proposed many
years ago whereby anything once in orbit and without its own motive power, could
be moved to another space location or orbit only by a commercial vehicle.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet there is another kind of entrepreneurial activity which has
the potential to accelerate the realization of an open space frontier. It is not
at the mercy of bureaucratic, administrative, or congressional whim. Why not?
Simply because it is a path that does not threaten powerful vested interests. We
are talking about "spin up" research & development.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Spin up" works like this. The entrepreneur considers the many and
varied technologies that will someday be needed on the space frontier. Next
he/she considers what profitable terrestrial applications there may be for each
of these. There follows a business plan, and ultimately a for-profit terrestrial
enterprise which has the happy effect of pre-developing and de-bugging and
putting "on the shelf" a technology which will one day help open the frontier -
sooner and at less cost.</P>

<H3 align=center>Space Oases</H3>
<P align=center>8/24/'95</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was glad to read your article in the July MMM about Space
Oases and see your emphasis on modularity. This is a concept I've long
advocated for both space development and the development of a powerful
space advocate community. I think the space enthusiast community is going
to come around on the issue of modular space infrastructure development, to
some degree and eventually. But I wonder how much good it will do most
people without a similar approach toward building a politico-economic power
base.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, with regard to modular oases -- whether in space or
on a planetary surface:</P>

<OL>
<LI><P>It is feasible to build a large sphere modularly. One must merely
divide the sphere into appropriately sized and shaped sector volumes. There
are a number of ways to do that. Latitudinal slicing and geodesic
segmenting are the easiest two for me to think of off the top of my head.
Regardless of the particular geometry used one must merely begin with a
balanced rotational system (since we are talking artificial G systems). In
the design cycle the "sectors" (habitable volumes) would be sized as
dictated by economics, required crew size, and various other factors. The
two initial masses (whether both were living spaces or one were merely a
counter weight) would be either hard or soft tethered with further tethers
added
(if necessary) as more modules are added. As an example, for the
longitudinal slicing method, the first modules would be equatorial, as
would all further modules until a torus was completed. Then additional
modules could be added at "higher" latitudes (requiring careful balancing)
or nearer the center of rotation (only requiring equal masses on evenly
spaced sides).</P>

<LI><P>As regards workers shifts: I would propose (if three shifts is the
case) that the factories be located in modules between the living modules
(one to three modules in addition to the living modules). My thoughts are
that factories tend to be noisy, they would pose an unnecessary risk of
pollution to the general population's environment, they pose an unnecessary
risk of catastrophic damage to the living area's life support functions,
and they could be in a constant state of "day time" without affecting any
living volume's schedule.</P>
</OL>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with you regarding modern America's risk aversion
and the nonsensicalness of 1 G bias. But where it is inexpensive enough
economically and logistically I wouldn't rule out lowering risk or raising
gravity levels.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Torus [Helix?] is an elegant solution. I like it! The
most exiting future would see many different options developed and
used.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Modularity both in architecture and in
development/construction schedule would be useful on planetary surfaces as
well. For instance, if a small robotic/remote control digger/hauler were at
work now, how ready could it have an area on the moon for an oasis in ten
or fifteen years? And if every year or two another robot some with similar
some with other capabilities were also sent then how far along could an
oasis be when it finally became feasible to send humans? And as
construction progressed there would be greater and greater incentive to
send humans and less and less of an infrastructure hurdle to overcome.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Triple Helix Space Colony seems ungainly</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature doesn't use the triple helix very much. Myoglobin
molecules, which somewhat resemble triple helices, are crosss-braced. Even
Watson amd Crick's abortive initial attempt at modeling DNA as a triple
helix had an internal backbone holding everything together. It's a rather
ungainly structure.</P>
<P> - Jeff Sanburg,     Skokie, Illinois</P>

<P>EDITOR'S REPLY: Just as the torus space colony has a hub, the helix,
double or single has a hub-shaft. And just as the torus has supporting
spokes connecting it concentrically to the hub, so will the helix, double
or triple, have rhythmically spaced spokes to the central shaft. I was
incapable of illustrating this structural feature in my crude MacPaint
graphics program and hoped that the reader would assume it.</P>

<P>Whether nature uses the triple helix or not is immaterial. The design is
structurally stable from an engineering point of view, and if growth from
all three end points is kept apace, dynamic equilibrium will be maintained.
Nature does use the radial plan (starfish, octopus, flowers, etc.) and the
triple helix can be seen as a radial derivative.  PK</p>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER> Dust Control, Space Suits, Terrestrial Uses</H3>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>11/02/'95</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dust Control" [MMM #89, pp. 5-7] was an execllent article.
There is a way that we could get some of this hardware developed prior to
returning to the moon. The universal door-lock and the turtle-back suit
would appear to have real application in the area of radioactive waste
management and other hazardous environments. The concepts of keeping the
nasties out, shielding, and working at a positive pressure with respect to
your environment are common to both the radioactive waste problem and the
moon.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is becoming increasingly clear that there is an enormous
clean-up effort that must be done in the wake of weapons production and
nuclear power generation both in this country and elsewere. If we could
steer some of the design concepts in this area, the result would be
technologies highly adaptable to the moon.</P>

<P> - <a href="mailto:wollym@aol.com">David Graham</a></P>

<P>EDITOR'S REPLY: Your suggestion is a perfect example of what I've dubbed
"spin-up," pre-developing a technology that will be needed eventually on
the space frontier, now, here on Earth for for-profit terrestrial
applications. The ulterior result is relatively free technology, ready to
go or apply, when we need it in space.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Shielding with Bricks?</H3>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>[posting to artemis-list]<BR>
11/19/'95</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;With walls made of bricks or sandbags of lunar soil, and a
roof made of &lt;mumble&gt; supporting more lunar soil, we can provide the
same protection and still have access to the exterior surface of the
habitat.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some questions: How quickly does the habitat need to be
shielded? Does it have to be accomplished during the initial manned mission
or can it be done telerobotically after the first team leaves?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as brickmaking is concerned, do we know how to make
bricks at the Moonbase using equipment that will fit into the first
mission's mass budget? I thought brickmaking would involve producing a
glass base product, melting it and using it as a bonding agent in the
bricks. Is there another way? Maybe using the regolith's natural clinging
properties and a gas operated pressurized ram mold?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar concerns for "sandbagging" lunar soil. Several
hundred lightweight plastic and fiber reinforced plastic bags wouldn't
weigh that much. But it would probably take a little time to fill them up
by hand. The process could be automated but that means the machinery
would have to be there to do it. Maybe a simple frame holding an electric
vibrating hopper with a bag changer/end-closure device at the outfeed.
Still have to have some sort of lunar earth mover to keep adding material
to the hopper as well as a mechanism to remove and stack the bags as they
are completed. Sounds like a system that would work best if there were
people around to clear any malfunctions. Supervising it might be a full
time job.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply piling dirt on top of the compound with a
teleoperated scooper may be the best way to go at first. Although taking
a brickmaking outfit and setting up business might do a lot to make people
understand that we are serious about building a full fledged moonbase and
that we are there to stay. You don't start a brick factory if you aren't
serious about construction!</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If it's essential to have external access to the first
habitat then I suppose an aluminum frame could be set up like a spindly
greenhouse (without the glazing) covering the habitat. The center "roof"
supports could be attached to the habitat itself. A reinforced tarp or
blanket draped over the frame and the whole thing buried using the scooper.
Won't be beautiful.</P>
 - <a href="mailto:jnobles@sneezy.midtenn.net">Jim Nobles</a>

<P>EDITOR'S REPLY: Given the angularity of lunar regolith particles,
tamping soil into a mold and lightly sintering it with solar heat or
microwaves should produce serviceable bricks or blocks. Fiberglass
reinforcement should not be necessary for most low performance
applications.</P>

<P>If the first setup crew stays only a week or so, the amount of radiation
they receive will be tolerable. So the shielding could be put in place
telerobotically after the first crew departs and before the next
arrives.</P>

<P>Your automated bagging process suggestion has merit. It will have to
compete, in terms of equipment mass to be imported from Earth, with
sinter-block making.</P>

<P>While simply bulldozing regolith is far the simplest method, it backs
the moonbase operation into a corner so far as future expansion options are
concerned. It may be wiser, as you suggest, to build a shed hanger and
place modules underneath where they can be hooked up to one another in a
growing complex with much less complication. See MMM #89 OCT '95

<P ALIGN=CENTER>9/23/95</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I finally got to see "Apollo 13" and it was a strange
emotional experience. I was probably the only person in the theatre who
has actually ever met any of the people involved. So it was a lonely,
personal event. I understood virtually every line of dialogue and knew so
much about other events that were going on that weren't mentioned - the
pogo, the problems convincing the computers that they really should do a
sep with the LEM still attached - that I was <I>there</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron Howard brought it alive and my own knowledge and my
private memories from my days as a CMU Sophomore made it 1970 again.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;And afterwards - blind rage. I left the theatre and stopped
for a pint on the way back. With every sip I cursed the political wanks who
killed Apollo. May their souls be damned to eternal torment in the deepest
foulest pits that hell has to offer. May dogs piss on their graves.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no smiley to this. I have no pity on those who
stole my future.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>SSF's "Alpha Town" proposal hits all the right notes</P>
<P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>by <A HREF="mailto:kohkmmm@execpc.com">Peter Kokh</A></P></font>

<P>After having for years opposed both the Space Station Freedom program
and the successor International Space Station Alpha project, the Space
Frontier Foundation has found a better alternative than "if you can't 
beat them, join them."; "If you can't beat them, get them to join you!"; 
better sums up SFF's recent (11/10/95) "Alpha Town"; proposal.</P>

<P>By this plan, Alpha would become the kernel of the first economically
self-sustaining town in orbit. "Alpha Town encompasses the concept of the
station as the financial and institutional hub of a business park." As
described by SFF Senior Advisor Tom Rogers, the important actions called
for are:</P>

<ol>
<LI>Handing over the operation of the US portion of the station to an
innovative commercial contractor as soon as possible, with the
understanding that the facility be operated in an entrepreneurial, 
profit-oriented and cost-reducing manner.
<LI>Competitively bidding all payloads and passenger flights to and from 
the US portion of the station amongst US launch firms.
<LI>Requiring that all expansion of the US portion of the station beyond
the current design be leased from US commercial firms.
<LI>Assuring that all domestic and international laws, treaties and
agreements involving Alpha Town create a level playing field for US firms
and act to encourage private investment in space.
</ol>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Converting the civil Space Station program into an
economically viable outpost in orbit -- the heart of "Alpha Town," achieves
the Chairman's vision -- it makes the project relevant, gives it an easily
understandable rationale for the taxpayers and will eventually make human
space flight as important to the American public as airline travel is
today."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Proponents of the concept see "Alpha Town" as the
"federal heart of a bustling free-enterprise based community, carrying
on all types of activities from science to new product development and <a
target="_top" href="/adb/02/07/ssto-business-plan.html">tourism</a>".</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This concept is a great start in the right direction. The
MMM editor and the Lunar Reclamation Society are happy to endorse it. There
will be considerable resistance to letting commercial and for-profit
interests play in this multi-governmental sandbox. Still, we need to aim
yet higher to hit even that mark. We think the above provisions offer a
basic core and can benefit from further embellishment and offer the
following additional suggested improvements: </P>
<OL>
<li value=5>We need to dust off the late 1970s' "Space Cartage Act" 
proposal, by which only commercial operators could carry equipment or 
personnel between space locations (between orbits). This would put an 
effective limit on NASA's operational "career." We'll need a commercial 
tug marina.
<li value=6>Commercial refueling depot, cryogenic scavenging, etc. as 
proposed in the SSI '88/89 Systems Study
<li value=7>Bid for a Commercially operated "hotel" module.
<li value=8>Derelict satellite salvage and refurbishment and sales -- i.e., a
commercially operated hangar with pressurized bays.
<li value=9>Draft legislation requiring that additional stations with U.S.
involvement in other orbits be wholly commercial</OL>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;SFF has shown considerable and vocal annoyance at the often
poor signal-to-noise ratio within NSS, but that often and unfortunately
paralyzing chatter is what one must expect of any organization which
attempts to run itself democratically. Yet we hope the NSS Policy
Committee and Spacecause will adopt and agree to cosoponsor the Alpha Town
proposal. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;All this may be for naught, however. The Russians, beset by
continuing political and economic upheaval, may yet pull out of the Space
Station Alpha deal, preferring to continue to grow and update the present
Mir I, an option most U.S. observers find unworkable, or "not worth our 
bother."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We won't be in suspense for long. Construction on S.S. 
Alpha is due to begin late next year. Meanwhile, any legislative efforts
along the lines sketched above won't be wasted. It will be in place for
successor efforts, if needed. Regardless of the flux of this international
drama, NSS policy makers ought to give serious, favorable attention to this
SFF proposal.</P>

<p align=center>The Ars ad Astra Winner is:</P>
<h3 align=center>Elisabeth Carroll Smith</h3>
<br><br>
<H4 align=center>The Cosmonaut Art Jury</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 3, 1995, twenty works of art on the theme 
"Space & Humanity" that were selected through an international competition
accompanied European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Thomas Reiter to the Mir
space station on his 180 day EUROMIR 95 mission. Picture of Mir Space
Station Ars ad Astra represents the first time in histroy that artists have
been invited to have their art works included in the world's space program
-- in space.</P>


<H4 align=center>The Announcement: Live From Space</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas Reiter and his two Russians colleagues -- Sergei Avdeev
and Yuri Ghidzenko -- had the task of deciding which of the twenty art works
best fulfilled the theme of the project. After more than one week of
deliberations the cosmonauts made their difficult decision. They first
narrowed down their choice to ten works, then to just three. The painting
they liked the best was "When Dreams Are Born" by American artist Elisabeth
Carroll Smith.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision was announced during a live 20-minute video
link-up with the Mir station on November 30 at 17.00 in the afternoon as a
part of ESA's "Art & Space" event which was hosted by the Euro Space Center
in Transinne, Belgium.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas Reiter said that the crew took this task very
seriously and that having art in their environmant was a welcome and
important addition to the strenuous scientific activities that must be
carried out by all astronauts.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The astro-jury showed how they displayed the art exhibition
in the Mir by attaching the pictures to the station walls. 81 pictures
including digitized versions of the 20 originals were stored in an
electronic archive in the ESA on-board portable computer.</P>

<H4 align=center>The Awards</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The winner, a professional pilot, had to make special
arrangements with her employer to be present for this once-in-a-lifetime
event. She received a special Omega Speedmaster Professional Chronograph
that was on the Mir for one year and which is valued at more than $10,000.
The prize was sponsored by the Swiss watch company OMEGA SA. ESA astronaut
Ulf Merbold presented the artist with an art print that had flown with him
on his EUROMIR 94 mission. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Her work will stay on the Mir space station to entertain
future crews and as a symbolic statement about adding a cultural dimension
to humanity's space activities. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirteen of the twenty space artists were present to hear
the live announcement from space. Although most artists came from Europe,
some travelled from as far away as Mexico and the United States to be there
to hear the result.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;They were: Alessandro Bartolozzi from Italy; Marcy Burt
Butz, Peter Binz and Andrea Thueler from Switzerland; Chris Couvee from The
Netherlands; Peter Eickmeyer, Karl Draeger, and Rudolf Hanke from Germany;
Claudine Varesi from Mexico; Marilynn Flynn from the United Arab Emirates;
and Ruth Trapane, Elisabeth Carroll Smith and Amy Zofko from the United
States. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of these artists received a prize of LASCAUX artists'
paints donated by the Swiss producer of fine art materials LASCAUX - Alois
Diethelm AG. The paints sets were valued at $250 each.</P>


<H4 align=center>Art & Education: Space & Humanity </H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately one hundred art students from different
European schools were also present at the Euro Space Center to participate
in the event. They were introduced to European space activities by ESA
representatives, had a chance to use the center's facilities, and got to
meet European astronaut Ulf Merbold. Five students were picked to ask the
Mir crew questions about their experiences in space. Some students brought
with them a piece of art that they have made on the same theme -- Space &
Humanity. Reproductions of the 20 paintings in space and the student
artworks were put on display at the center. A "Cosmic" fashion show and a
"vernissage" of the art exhibition taking place on both Earth and in space
capped the events of this exciting day.</P>


<H4 align=center>The International Exhibition Tour</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the original art works except for the one chosen to
stay on the Mir station will be returned to Earth at the end of the EUROMIR
95 mission. The Ars ad Astra art works will become a part of the "Art to
the Stars" exhibition of space art which is currently on an international
exhibition tour including stops in Oslo, Berlin, Turin, New York and
Beijing.</P>

<H2 align=center>Pioneer Holidays and other festivities</H2>

<P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>by <A HREF="mailto:kohkmmm@execpc.com">Peter Kokh</A></P></font>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;While "new traditions" (as oxymoronic as it sounds) are 
being made all the time, there is little doubt that those that command
our observance most deeply are those which are oldest, rooted in our
collective gitgo times. So it is with Holidays: Christmas, Easter, New
Years go back millennia (two at least). Thanksgiving goes back nearly four
centuries. The 4th of July will be 220 years old next time around.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We can expect that as the lunar frontier becomes fully
established with the coming of age of the first native born generation of
Lunans, the holidays and festivals they will most cherish will include
those observed by those establishing the first beachhead.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Apollo 11 landing (July 20th) is sure to be observed, as
is the "infamous" day of retreat, the liftoff of the Apollo 17 crew 
(December 10th). But neither of these "trivia" dates will rival the 
enthused celebration of the "Day of the Return" when humans come back to 
the moon intent on setting up an open-ended "permanent" presence leading 
to genuine settlement.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The first crew may only set up camp and then return to
Earth, to be followed by the first crew intent on staying a full day-night
cycle (the lunar "sunth") or more. So closely connected with the 
observance of the Day of the Return will be the celebration of that first
successful "overnighting" and the greeting of that first "sunrise" -- 
"First Night's End."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, "Ever Since Day" will mark commencement of 
uninterrupted human presence on the moon. If I were to put a friendly
wager on which of these will be the most honored in Lunan settlement
tradition, it would be on "First Night's End." There will be a special 
flavor to this holiday, the shared mutual congratulations at having 
survived this "initiation" imposed by the moon itself. And for all 
non-native born Lunans, there will be a special personal resonance
with memories of their very own "First Night" and "First Night's End."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Other history-rooted anniversaries may mark the birth of the
first native born Lunan. And later, the first native born grandchild (i.e.,
second generation, whose health will be the final test of whether or not
humans can stay on the moon indefinitely) [See MMM #47 JUL '91, p.5 
"Native Born"]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all Lunan Holidays and festivities will take root in
such historic occurrences. Some are sure to be bound up with the moon's 
natural rhythms, much as a growing minority of us terrestrials observe 
the equinoxes and solstices. Local sunset and local sunrise will be big 
deals, something to mark with a special meal or wine or friends --
simply because they occur on a 28+ day cycle, not a 24 hour one.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If a particularly appropriate Lunan Calendar is adopted [see
MMM #7 JUL '87, "Moon Calendar"], with "sunths" of 28.5 (24 hr.) days 
instead of 30.5 day calendar months, with the discrepancy with Earth 
reckoning made up with occasional "leap" ("intercalary") "sunths" or 
weeks, Lunar New Years may only approximate the fall of New Years on 
Earth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a case, the observance of religious feasts and holy
days may also vary with that on Earth, without spiritual harm to those who
honor them. This will be much to the chagrin and resistance of religious
fundamentalists (those who give major importance to the minor, and minor
importance to what really matters, and call every one else heretic and
infidel.)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Solar Eclipses on the moon are the flip side of Lunar
Eclipses on Earth. They will be much more of an experience for Lunan
pioneers and settlers than any eclipse on Earth (even total Solar). They
will last several hours locally, and possibly may occasion the morning or
afternoon "off" (work or school) as the case may be. And it will be the 
most favorable time for looking for city lights on Earth's nighttime 
face.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In time, other "political" milestones will come to be 
honored in settlement tradition -- the day when home rule is won, or
independence declared, for example.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Historic and festive holidays will not be the only
early-rooted traditions. Pioneering songs and ballads, even candidate
settlement anthems, are sure to be written, sung, performed, and loved.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There may arise too special festive foods with historic
significance. We have pretzels and crossover buns associated with Lent,
unleavened bread associated with Passover. Eggnog, Christmas cookies,
Easter Eggs, and Pumpkin Pie are among many foods especially popular at
specific festive times. On the moon, many long-loved foods and recipe
delights will not be available early on. Special early frontier substitute
food and menu items, beverages too, even if in time the need to make such
substitutions eases, may be prepared and consumed with relish on
commemorative occasions. Associated with such holiday tradition meals may
be time-revered toasts, blessings, and mutual greetings.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain plants are associated with various observances on
Earth; poinsettias and mistletoe with Christmas, for example. And plants
grown successfully in the early outpost days may come to be associated with
various Lunan observances in like fashion.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The first humans to return to the moon may think that all
they are doing is erecting, deploying, setting up, demonstrating, testing,
etc. But even the little incidental things they do may in time take on
special meaning and color not at all obvious at first, to become ritually
repeated. This will all occur sometimes spontaneously, other times with
alertness, if not deliberateness, as a part of fulfilling the very human
need to impose on nature's own rhythms, a festive and commemorative
cultural rhythm of our own. Such cultural rhythms are a major element of
the social glue that binds generations together. In this way they will bind
future Lunan generations, much as similar traditions have always served in
terrestrial communities throughout the globe, and throughout historic and
pre-historic times.</P>

Moon Guns & Other Mysteries

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;About Moon guns... As it happens, I even have some 
thoughts about the subject at hand.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of building a chemical gun to launch propellants
from the moon is intriguing, but I'd shy away from comparing it to an 
electric gun. We're faced with its own interesting technology challenges. 
As best I can tell, to make a chemical gun work we'd need all the industries
required to support an electromagnetic launcher, plus a lot more. Here's
what I'm thinking. Correct my concept of this thing if I got it wrong.</P>

<H4>Propellants...</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue is making the propellants from lunar
material. You mentioned the lack of nitrogen on the moon. Some nitrogen 
is mixed in with the regolith, but exporting scarce, life-critical elements
from the moon would be a self-defeating business.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ditto for the idea of exporting hydrogen. You mention using
hot hydrogen as a working fluid in one of your posts, but I'd advise
against it. If you start a business that wastes hydrogen on the moon, it
will last just as long as it takes other loonies to wreck it. The stuff is
too precious.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The good news is that there are lots of ways to make
propellants from lunar material. You need a fuel, <a
href="/adb/04/03/10/04/oxygen-extraction.html" target="_top">oxydizer</a>,
and perhaps some other elements to control the burning rate. Any mixture
that gives you gasses which will support a supersonic burning wave front (a
Chapman-Jouget wave) will work.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The hard part is getting that mixture. We'll have to
disassemble moon rock to do this. To get the oxygen we're exporting, we'll
need essentially the same processes. Chemically the function of the gun 
is to reassemble the compounds we took apart. But making propellants for a
chemical gun means additional chemical processes, all new technology that
will have to be developed at some non-zero cost.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we make the propellants, we'll need containers, for 
storage, logistics, and getting the propellants into the gun. That means 
more manufacturing processes, more machining, more technology to develop.</P>

<h4>Gun Structure...</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Here it gets really complicated. We need a precisely 
machined barrel, able to contain some pretty high chamber pressures. It'll
be miles long unless you're willing to build your payload to withstand
thousands of g's.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;A fuel tank robust enough to take that kind of acceleration
is a whole new engineering challenge. It wouldn't be useful as a container
for rocket propellants and in this scenario won't be recoverable, so I
assume you don't want to do this.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;That leaves us with the metallurgical challenge of making
the material for the barrell, and then machining it. Now we're into really
heavy industry on the moon. I don't have time to estimate the initial
capital required to get that much heavy machinery to the moon, but just the
thought of it boggles my mind. The alternative is building up heavy
industry on the moon one step at a time, which adds a few decades to the
program schedule.</P>

<h4>Conclusions...</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the technology challenges and capital required to
develop that big chemical gun on the moon, my best guess is that
electromagnetic propulsion would be considerably betterfastercheaper to
implement. Linear induction motors are fairly straightforward so the
technology isn't scary. The important structural components -- supports for
the magnets and payloads -- are massive but don't need to be as precise as
a chemical gun's barrel; we're not building a giant pressure-containing
cylinder.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic industries supporting either operation involve
mining moondirt, separating the chemicals, and making metal; and both need
a good <a target="_top"
href="/adb/04/03/03/power-source-comparison.html">power supply</a>. For
electromagnetic propulsion we're ready to go when we can make aluminum wire
and machine the fiddly bits that keep the parts together. We'll even need
wire to support control of the chemical gun, too. The chemical gun needs
much lower power levels for its operation, but the fundamental industry is
the same; we're still smelting aluminum and extruding it through a die to
make wire.</P>

<h4>Nevertheless...</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;All that said, I can still think of an economic argument for
the gun: it looks neat. The muzzle flash against a dark sky would be
awesome; you'd know something is happening when that behemoth fires! It
might even sound neat if the ground shock gets transmitted to a nearby
habitat. So even if it takes more industry development to do it, a big
chemical gun might be economically Worth Doing because its entertainment
value might add enough to make up for the cost of developing the additional
machining capability. In comparison, an electromagnetic launcher would be
boring. Think of it as an attraction at the Great Theme Park In The Sky.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;One more argument in favor of doing this: These days we
flinch at the word "spinoff", but the additional industrial capability we'd
get from being able to do all that heavy machining should spark your
imagination. If we can make a cannon barrel on the moon, we'll be able to
make just about anything.</P>

<H2 align=center>Arthur C. Clarke Nominated for Nobel Peace Prize</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>Communications Satellite Inventor Honored for Promoting
World Understanding as<BR>"The Philosopher of the Global Village"</P>
<P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>info: <A HREF="mailto:prospace@aol.com">David
Brandt</A></P></font>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Science fiction and science writer Arthur C. Clarke is
receiving an unusual birthday present. Clarke, who has just turned 78, is
being nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Clarke is probably best known as the author of
<CITE>2001: A Space Odyssey</CITE>, the nomination, authored by National Space Society
Director Glenn H. Reynolds, a law professor at the University of Tennessee,
cites Clarke's invention of the geosynchronous communications satellite.
Clarke proposed the technology in an October 1945 article in the magazine
<CITE>Wireless World</CITE>. The first such satellite was launched less than twenty
years later, and they are now commonplace, mainstays of everything from
international telephony to CNN.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Reynolds, this invention has gone a long way
toward promoting world peace. In his nominating letter he writes: </P>
<blockquote>
<P>"I do not believe it to be an exaggeration when I say that the global 
communications revolution made possible by satellite communications has 
been the most powerful single force for world peace in the post-World War 
Two era. Worldwide television reportage, made possible by satellites, has 
been instrumental in preventing bloodshed on many occasions. It has
prompted the dispatch of U.N. Peacekeeping forces (themselves Nobel Peace
Prize awardees) on many occasions; it has caused combatants to draw back
from the brink of hostilities on others; it has produced strong pressures
to avoid civilian casualties; and it has discouraged governments from using
force against dissident elements in their own civilian populations. It may
well have been responsible for the change in consciousness that resulted in
the end of the Cold War and the first steps toward freedom in the former
Soviet Union."</P></blockquote>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Clarke has also served as (in the <CITE>Washington Post's</CITE> own
words) "the philosopher of the Global Village," offering important
observations and cautions on topics ranging from the threat to the world's
oceans posed by pollution, to the danger to astronauts posed by "space
junk." He has also supported numerous humanitarian efforts in his adopted
home of Sri Lanka.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will science fiction fans around the globe rally in support
of Clarke? "He deserves it," says Reynolds.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Why most planets and asteroids have Clarke orbits, and most
moons do not</P>
<P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<P>The location of, even the very existence of, surface-synchronous 
orbits depends on three factors:</P>
<ul type=circle>
<li>The mass of the planet, moon, or asteroid in question
<LI>Its rotation period
<LI>Its proximity to deeper gravity wells
</ul>


<P>The more massive the body in question, the farther out will be any
surface-synchronous orbit, all else being equal and the periods of the
compared bodies being closely similar.</P>

<P>Earth and Mars have similar periods or days of 24 hours and 24 hrs. 37
minutes respectively. Earth's geosynchronous orbit lies some 23,000 miles 
above the surface. The synchronous orbit for Mars, with only a tenth of 
Earth's mass, lies 10,500 miles above the surface. In contrast, a 24 hr. 
orbit above Saturn (95 times more massive than Earth) would lie about 
160,000 miles above its cloudtops.</P>

<P>The slower a body rotates, the farther out will be any
surface-synchronous orbit.</P>

<P>If Earth rotated in 48 hrs rather than 24, its synchronous orbit would 
lie nearly 39,000 miles above the surface [period^2= distance^3 (from 
planet center)]. Conversely, if Earth rotated in just 12 hours, its 
geosynchronous orbit would lie just 13,000 miles above the equator.</P>

<P>If the theoretical surface-synchronous orbit lies beyond the closest
Lagrange point of a more massive body, a synchronous orbit will not exist
as any object following such an orbit would fall into the dominant gravity
well of the larger object.</P>

<P>The moon's rotation period, locked to the period of its orbit about
Earth, is a lazy 28.53 days. If the moon were an isolated body off by
itself, i.e., not a satellite of Earth or some other close and more massive
dominant body, its surface synchronous orbit, i.e., one with a period of
28.53 days, would lie about 55,000 miles out. In actuality, such an orbit
would run over the shoulder of the moon's gravity well into Earth's 
gravity well on the side facing Earth.</P>

<P>Most natural planetary satellites or moons have had their original
rotations slowed, or speeded up, by overwhelming tidal forces until their
rotation is locked to their orbital period, so that they always keep the
same face turned toward their planet. Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto
always keep the same face turned toward Jupiter, Titan and its siblings,
the same face towards Saturn, etc. Likewise, their would-be
surface-synchronous orbits run over the lip of the gravity well interfaces
with their host planet.</P>

<P>For communications on tidally locked planetary moons, there are three
solutions:</P>

<ul type=square>
<li>a constellation of satellites in swift close-in orbits;
<LI>fewer satellites in very eccentric "Molniya" type orbits with their 
apogee (at which they move slowest and near which they spend by far the 
most time each orbit) above the place needing communications;
<LI>relay satellites at planet-moon L4 and L5 co-orbital Lagrange points,
respectively centered some 60&#176; ahead of and behind the moon in its
orbit about its planet at the same distance from the moon as the planet.
</ul>

<P>For the moon, L4 and L5 lie 238,000 miles out, fully ten times farther
out than Earth's geosynchronous orbit, meaning longer lag times and
requiring more broadcast power. </P>

<P>On the other hand, as small as asteroids are, their shallow gravity
wells are far enough removed from those of more massive planets, that they
can enjoy surface-synchronous orbits. Ceres, with a period of 9.08 hrs. has
a Clarke orbit just 486 miles above its equator.</P>

<P><B>February, 1996</B> -- The C.I.S. manned space station Mir with Mir-20
(call sign 'Uran') Cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko, Sergei Avdeyev and Thomas
(DF4TR / DP0MIR) Reiter and will be appearing in the mid west US morning
skies Jan 11th to Feb 7th, and return to evening skies Feb 11th to March
3rd.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Amateur radio operators can log into the Mir 'Packet'
(R0MIR-1) BBS on 145.550MHz simplex -- and soon on 435.775MHz uplink /
437.975 downlink MHz. The cosmonauts also use the freq. 145.200MHz, up and
145.800MHz down or 435.725MHz up / 437.925MHz down or 145.550Mhz simplex 
to talk or send SSTV video with amateur radio operators on the ground 
during their off-hours.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Messages from Mir:</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello you people on Earth. This is not Santa Claus here, 
this is the Russian Space Station Mir calling, crew 20. As you are on
Earth, we are celebrating Christmas Eve today, here in Earth Orbit, and 
we wish you all a Merry Christmas, a Peaceful and Happy New Year and I will
hand over now to Yuri who will also direct some words to you."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello folks. This is your space station calling with a
recorded TGIF Message. I guess this will be the last TGIF message for this
year, so we all wish you an especially nice Friday Evening, and hope you
have some especially nice drinks, please don't forget to have some drinks
for us, for Yuri, Serge and myself. Many Greetings, 73 and Bye Bye."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roma-zero-MIR Roma-zero-MIR Russian Mir Space Station
wishing you a Happy New Year! This is Crew Number 20 of Space Station Mir
here working. Yuri Gidzenko Board commander, Board Engineer Thomas Reiter,
and myself Sergei Avdeyev Board Engineer #1. We wish you hello and A Very
Happy Next Year!!! This is Mir Space Station."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"MIR-station, 1/1/1996. Hello Ladies and Gentlemen, First 
of all we want to wish you a happy, healthy, peaceful and successful new 
year! In case some of you tried to contact us yesterday afternoon or
during the night might have recognized, that there was some interruption
from our side. We are very sorry for that, but the power-supply for our two
radios had failed. So we installed the old power supply and reset
everything. Unfortunately, we will not be able to run the TM733 with this
old power-supply, as it doesn't provide enough current. So let's see, what
we can do about this. In the meantime the 'old' ICOM-station and the 'old'
TNC are running. Once again, all the best for the new year, 73's from 
Yuri, Sergei, Thomas."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Russian cosmonauts and a German saw the New Year on
the Mir space station with brandy because it is hard to sip champagne in
zero gravity, Itar-Tass news agency said. One of the three men dressed up
as Santa Claus, or Father Frost as he is known in Russia. A cargo craft
recently brought small artificial fir trees, food and gifts for the
cosmonauts.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Next Russian Launch:</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;February 21, 1996 Soyuz TM-23 / EO-21. Primary crew: Yuri
Onufrienko, Yuri Usachev. The crew of Mir EO-20 is scheduled to return on
Feb. 29th.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shuttle Amateur Radio EXperiment, or SAREX will fly
again on Shuttle Mission STS-76 which will dock again with Mir. Launch is
set for March 21, 1996 at 08:34 UTC (2:34 AM CST) from the Kennedy Space
Center, Cape Canaveral, Florida. Landing is scheduled for March 30, 1996 at
17:07 UTC (11:07 AM CST) at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. It will be a
9-day mission.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Among those in the crew who hold amateur licenses are,
Astronaut Richard A. Searfoss KC5CKM who will serve as the Shuttle's Pilot,
Mission Specialist Linda M. Godwin, N5RAX and Ronald M. Sega, KC5ETH. The
remaining crew members include Commander Kevin P. Chilton, and Mission
Specialists Shannon W. Lucid (who is expected to have her amateur license

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Astronaut Thagard leaves NASA, returns to Alma Mater:</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Space Shuttle Astronaut Dr. Norman E. Thagard has retired
from NASA and returned to his alma mater, Florida State University. He
leaves the space agency following five space missions, STS-7, 51-B, 30, 42,
Mir-18/STS-71, including a U.S. record four-month stay aboard Russia's
space station Mir. Thagard has spent over 140 days in space -- more than
any other American.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thagard accepted the position of Visiting Professor and
Director of External Relations for the Florida A&M University -- Florida
State University College of Engineering, Tallahassee. His initial
assignment, effective Jan. 5, is teaching electronics, an area that has
been a long-time hobby. Thagard has published several articles on digital
and analog electronics design.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;To join Space Access Society or buy the SSTO/DC-X V 3.0
video we have for sale (Two hours, includes all eight DC-X flights, X-33,
DC-X and SSTO backgrounders, aero-spike engine test-stand footage, plus
White Sands Missile Range DC-X pre and post flight footage) mail a check
to:</P>

<p align=center>SAS, 4855 E Warner Rd #24-150, Phoenix AZ 85044</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;SAS membership with direct email of Space Access Updates is
$30 US per year; the SSTO V 3.0 video is $25, $5 off for SAS members, $8
extra for shipping outside the US and Canada, VHS NTSC only.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We've been hearing questions lately, wondering if we'd left
the planet ahead of everyone else. We've been very busy with some
long-term payoff work, and there's been no one earthshaking development in
the affordable access field, so we let the next Update slide "for a week 
or two..." And now it's over ten weeks, and the little things happening a 
bit at a time have begun to add up to some interesting trends. It's 
Update time again -- but for now, the condensed holiday version.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of you waiting for video tapes, all the back-ordered
version 2.0 DC-X/SSTO tapes went into the mail December 22nd. Our 
apologies for the massive delay. You will find in them a discount
certificate for the 3.0 video by way of amends. The long-overdue version
3.0 X-33/DC-X/SSTO video now looks like it will be ready to go to the
duplicators the first week of January; backorders will be in the mail
immediately thereafter. Yes, we most likely got your order; we've been
holding off cashing the checks out of the remnants of a sense of decency
and fair play. We hope you'll think the footage we've found is worth the
wait. We hope you won't march on SAS HQ with tar and feathers in the
meantime...</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;And it's getting toward that time of year again. Our next
annual conference, Space Access '96, will be happening April 26-28 1996,
Friday evening through Sunday afternoon, once again in Phoenix, Arizona.
We're going to go bigtime aerospace one of these years, do it during the
working week at a posh resort at a thousand bucks a head, but not yet --
SA'96 registration is still only $80 if postmarked before January 15th,
when it goes up to $90, higher at the door. SA'96 will again be at a hotel
within easy shuttle-bus distance of the Phoenix airport; we're currently
negotiating with several and should have one nailed down shortly. Previous
attendees, tell 'em -- this really is worth the trouble to attend. Phoenix
is a hub for Southwest and America West, and also served by Western
Pacific, Continental, United, Delta, American, etc. There's no lack of
cheap airfares if you plan ahead -- so be here!</P>

<center><font size=5>Reusable Launch News Summary</font></P></center>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The capsule version of the news: DC-XA is coming along OK,
albeit the minor delays are piling up to the point where we'd guess it'll
be a few weeks late flying, late spring rather than early.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;NASA tried to cancel X-34 at the start of November, but
there was no wooden stake handy (actually the White House intervened), so
it lives still, more or less -- development cost is climbing, performance
dropping, schedule slipping, and we hear that projected ops costs are
rising to more or less the same as Pegasus. Which makes sense, since X-34
now has as many stages as a Pegasus -- carrier aircraft, winged booster, two
upper stages -- and will likely be at least as complex to integrate and
operate.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;X-33 is doing OK; the picture is beginning to firm up as to
what might actually fly and how much it'll cost. Much more on this next
Update.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The X-33 draft Phase 2 CAN (phase 2 is the actual
construction and flight test of one or more X-33's, starting this summer)
can be found at
<a  target="_top" href="http://www.space-access.org">
http://www.space-access.org</a>, our new under-construction web page.
(Please, no critiques until we've actually had time to do something with
the site!)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Comments on the draft CAN are due January 22nd; email any
comments you have to us at <a href="mailto:space.access@space-access.org">
space.access@space-access.org</a> at least one week before that, and we'll
run the interesting ones past our advisory board before finalizing SAS's
formal comments. After a once-over, we think it looks pretty good; the
only "gotcha" we've spotted so far is the clause linking an X-33 go-ahead
next summer to continued existance of X-34. Tsk, tsk, naughty naughty, we
say -- that's a pretty raw attempt to hold X-33 hostage to the highly
dubious X-34 project on someone's part.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;X-33 funding for FY'96 looks fairly assured over on the NASA
side, if the HUD/VA/Independent Agencies appropriation ever gets clear of
the [government shut-down] "train wreck." In theory, there's $25M for
reusable rocket work actually appropriated now over in DOD, but the DOD
bill was signed only because the White House has to pay for the Bosnia
expedition somehow. Look for a major, multi-billion DOD rescissions list
in the coming months, and look for an attempt to put our $25M on it. And
once we beat that, look for months of delay in releasing the money. This
is getting to be a familiar fight, but it's one we've won every time so
far.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;And both McDonnell-Douglas and Lockheed-Martin are investing
around $300 million each of private money in upgraded expendable commercial
launch vehicles (<a  target="_top"
href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/delta-3.html">Delta 3</a> and Atlas 2AR
respectively), and both Kistler Aerospace and Kelly Space & Technology have
money and are going ahead with their private reusable space launch 
ventures. We just might get to the point where government funding is
irrelevant to a thriving cheap launch industry sooner than anyone expects.

<H3 align=center>Frontier Musings</H3>
<P align=center>[cf. MMM #91 DEC '95, p.6 "Personnel"]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, when I'm musing about the mechanics of lunar
settlement, I wonder if we can avoid the "lawless" element that was so much
a part of Earthly frontiers. On Earth, while life on the frontier was not
easy, one generally could live off the land in isolation from others. On
the moon, the frontier physically is much more deadly. I would hope that
this very real danger would cause a much more highly developed sence of
teamwork, partnering, brotherhood, or, in a word, family amoung those that
would dare to venture out from mother Earth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The physical constraints of early lunar settlements will
require a constant monitoring and vigilance by each team member of the
others supporting technology to ensure survival. Most all endeavors,
especially those related to "outside" will have to be two or more person
team efforts for safety reasons. Hopefully a culture will develop from
this where each member's behaviour is guided by a sensitivity and concern
for the welfare of each member of the community at large. Crime, at least
the personal, violent types of crime should be realitively rare. Not
because of some rigid, police-state mentality, but because we recognize
that we are individually weak against a powerful and hostile nature. Our
only hope of survival is in viewing each other as part of ourselves and
caring for each other as we care for our own flesh.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>[cf. MMM #87 JUL '95 p.10, "The Brass Spittoon"]<br>
[from a post ll/19/95 to artemis-list@lunacity.com]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the Artemis Ireland reunions we can sit around the
turf fire screen saver and sing old songs like The Rising of the Earth? And
declare it a bohdran free zone?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a serious side to this. In the earliest days it
will be more like a wartime military post. But as it grows into a frontier
outpost, a good pub will be important to sanity. And thought will have to
go into the design of it so that a good tension-releasing bar brawl will
not leave anything damaged that is either irreplaceable nor will it risk
the integrity of life support.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;A frontier settlement has a psychology to it. And although I
don't want a bunch of social engineers trying to apply academic theories to
"designing" the people and society there, I do think it is necessary to
apply common sense that any expedition head, military leader or old time US
sheriff would have. People who go to frontiers have cut a lot of ties and
will have a burden of memories of things left behind; they will be in an
unforgiving environment in which a slip on their part or that of another,
or a random failure in equipment or procedure can maim or kill; there will
be little to do but work and it will seem like there is so much to be done
that it is a hopeless task; people you have grown to despise can not be
avoided; relationships that failed can never be completely left behind...
in general it will be a high stress environment. This is not to say that
people will be going around frowning. Frontiers are also exciting and fun.
But the invisible stress still builds and there must be socially acceptable
outlets for it. Otherwise we'll end up with a town full of coronaries,
neurotics and axe murderers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;So when I said "a good tension-relieving bar brawl," I meant
just that. Anyone who has ever lived in a seriously tense situation will
understand all. People in Northern Ireland are particularly familiar with
the both coping strategies and the results of failure to do so.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Moon Miners' Manifesto Issue #93</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><!-- /093/hardier-pioneer.html --><H2 align=center>Mars will Require a Hardier Breed of Pioneer</H2><P><HR WIDTH=80%></P><FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:kokhmmm@execpc.com">Peter Kokh</a></FONT><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people envision with enthusiasm an eventual wholesale settlement and colonization of Mars, and I number myself among them. In doing so, we carry forward what has become a radical dream of our species throughout this century. And we have done so, stubbornly, through revolution after revolution in our perceptions about the Red Planet. Banished to the realm of myth are the Mars of Edgar Rice Burroughs, populated by green men and princesses and thoats, and the Mars of Percival Lowell, crisscrossed with canals feeding green strips of irrigated vegetation, defying the creeping desication of the Planet. But gone, too, is the glimpse of a moon-like Mars that we read into the first photos from early Mariner orbiters.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We know now that Mars was once warmer, wet with ocean, rains, and rivers, and lakes, and possibly in early stages of greening. We are all but certain that much of that watery endowment yet remains, locked up in permafrost layers of soil in lower lying basinlands. There may even be liquid subterranean lakes if there are near-surface geothermal pockets still simmering here and there, but we do not know. As to the polar caps, we now know that under a few inches of carbon dioxide frost seasonally chilled out of the atmosphere, there are vast polar ice sheets hundreds of meters thick, at least in the north.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;How much water is there? That is, how extensive and patchy are the permafrost deposits? How thick are they? How fresh or brinish? All these questions must be answered to a first approximation accurate to an order of magnitude before any brainstorming schemes of "terraforming" (or, as we would prefer, of "rejuvenaissance" i.e. not making Mars like Earth, but bringing it back to the more encradling Mars-state it once enjoyed) can be much more than an exercise in "garbage in, garbage out." Which is why MMM has never gotten into such schemes. It is far too premature an exercise.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;What does remain is the promise of a world that is more thoroughly endowed with prerequisites to support human and Earth life than is our own bondsworld, the Moon. Mars would seem to have far more appeal as a homesteading destination for those with enough of the right stuff to be willing to forever forsake the Green Hills of Earth.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But we can indulge in these fantasies, these declarations of willingness to go, only because the need to take a second look has not been thrust upon us by any imminent opportunity to open this frontier. That point of truth is still over the time horizon by an unknown number of years.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;When that time does come and those who've thought themselves ready to go are faced with the decision to "put up or shut up", we think that many, even most, will get cold feet.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;For despite Mars' life-supportive endowments, the challenges and obstacles to the establishment of a long-term human population capable of first enduring, then of thrivingly coming into its own, are daunting. And they are daunting from many points of view: engineering, logistical, biospheric, but above all and most critically, personal.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this last but ultimately most make-or-break class of challenges that we want to discuss here.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;POINT: Mars is farther from Earth than the Moon, much farther. And the implications are compounded.</P><img align=right alt="Comparison Table of the Moon and Mars" src="/images/asi199600051.gif" width=250 height=124><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Resupply, reinforcement, relief, and rescue are always from 6 months to 25 months away. This will mean a reliance on a strategic "egg yolk" policy, as opposed to maintenance of "umbilical" style logistics. On site repair and fabrication shops as well as hospitals, both as to equipment and personnel expertise will need to be very much more complete.  Triage in medical emergencies will have to be accepted by all as a potential personal consequence before leaving Earth.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;It will mean that the personal commitment to the Mars frontier of each pioneer recruit must be individually that much deeper, more "final", that much less open to reconsideration down the line. It will be much more expensive to return to Earth, and the delay time before such a repatriation can be affected will be much, much longer. Only the hardiest, most self-reliant, and resilient personalities should tempt such odds.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense of isolation from the mainstream of human civilization will be much deeper. Electronic communication with Earth will involve response delays of 6 to 44 minutes, not the 2 and a half seconds Lunans will experience. While, in all but live radio communications, those delays can be edited out, the edited conversations will flow jerkily and clumsily. The new "Martians" will tend to turn inward culturally and socially, and go their own way.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;POINT: The Sun not only is further, dimmer, and much less warming, it is noticeably so to the naked eye. Not all of that is bad, of course. On Earth, full sunlight is uncomfortably intense. On Mars the softer light will be still plenty bright enough, and welcome, much as the softly sunny November skies in the northern United States and Canada.</P><table><tr><td>LEFT: On Earth, the Sun shines bright and warm. Our generous oceans act as a thermal sink for that heat, providing an additional mean boost of some 50&#176; F (28&#176;C) over where we'd be without them. Solar collectors do not have to be overly large to tap this energy further.</td><td>RIGHT: On Mars, the Sun is noticeably smaller, less brilliant. The radiant heat it sheds is not enough to warm living things, or people. With no ocean heat sink, it is far colder than its greater distance from the Sun would indicate. Solar collectors have to be much larger in size.</td></tr></table><table><tr><td><img align=right alt="Solar Energy to Earth and Mars" src="/images/asi199600057.gif" height=113 width=220></td></tr></table><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But the smaller Sun will be a constant reminder of the reliefless cycle of very cool and bitterly cold seasons. Martian summers are but caricatures of our own temperate zone warm seasons, not even quite on a thermal par with the patchy thaws of our Antarctic summers.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Martians will learn to cope, to be sure, and grow to find much pleasure and satisfaction in the accommodations they will have to make to acculturate themselves to this new world. But only those with the inner strength and drive to do get over the enormous adjustment hurdles had better set out on such a venture.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;It can best be summed up so. Only a tiny fraction of the numbers who say they would go to Mars had they but the chance to do so, would also be as willing to commit to pioneering the relatively far friendlier fringes of our own Antarctica, with its vast fresh water supplies, breathable sweet air, and surrounding oceans teeming with life and food. That has to tell us something. We are all too romantic about Mars!</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet as long as the moment of truth, the time for a reality check is yet far off, we can afford to indulge our Martian illusions. And perhaps that is good in the long run. For it carries forth the dream, and with it the ongoing brainstorming exercises that will one day overcome the daunting odds.</P><font size=2><a href="index.html" target="_top">Back to MMM #93</a></font>&nbsp;&lt;-&nbsp;<a href="mmm-mars-platform.html">-&gt;</a></BODY></HTML>

Kokh), we broke the topic down into two separate questions:</P><ul type=square><lI>Question 1: What kinds of life forms may have had time to evolve on Mars before irreversible climactic decay, and could any fossil traces still endure?<li>Question 2: Could some anemic relic of a once far richer Martian Biosphere still subsist in "oases" here and there?</ul><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We concluded with a discussion of the implications for Martian settlement dreams, pointing out that the Romanti-cists who hope against hope that we will find some primitive (at least!) life forms still extant life on Mars, had better hope that they are wrong. It is incomprehensibly naive to think that should we find life on Mars of any sort, that the political / rabbleocracy powers-that-be would allow humans (us!) to settle there. The Fourth Planet would forthwith be declared a quaran-tined biological preserve for the rest of time. "Humans and all Earth Life keep out!" We could hardly disagree more with the sentiments expressed by editor Jeff Liss in the recent issue of Inside NSS. He had called "disappointing" the recent finding that the Viking "No-Life-On-Mars" experiment results were not flawed after all.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If all we find are fossil relics and perhaps a few incomplete strands of DNA (we should rejoice at finding that much!) Jurassic Park type reconstructions of native life form populations are most unlikely.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If an eco-system does survive, we could not hope to see any significant further evolution (beyond anecdotal differen-tational radiation of surviving species into new niches in a restored or rejuvenated more benign climate) within the lifetime of humanity, even if it be a million years - and not even if we succeeded in restoring, permanently, the former more life-accommodating climate with a stabilized all-Martian biosphere and biota. Romantic ideas to the contrary should not be entertained. We would be left with only pre-metazoan life, one-celled plants and animals - nothing we could see with the naked eye!   So rather rejoice that Mars is empty of life!</P><font size=+1 color="#AA1515"><CENTER>It is not precise to say that Mars is "barren", only that it is "virginal"</center></font><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not the end of the story. That Mars has no life, and quite possibly never spawned life even in earlier wetter and warmer times does not make the planet "barren". It only makes the planet "virginal". That conditions may have never been special to allow life to rise on its own, does not mean that life, originated elsewhere, and then bioengineered to fit Martian conditions, could not be successfully transplanted to Martian soil, with intelligent guidance, corrections, and compensations. That is a tall challenge, however, but we hope to sketch how it might be accomplished. Or at least, the first steps one intending to green the planet might take.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The biological side of Greening Mars would have to be brought about "pari passu" i.e. step by step together with the geological rejuvenescence of the planet. Rather than "terraforming" Mars by making it a copy of Earth, rejuvenais-sance looks not at Earth, but the early Mars itself, for its standard of achievement. The planet does need to be warmed, first to the point where a third of the atmosphere no longer freezes out over the poles each winter (twice a Martian year, during northern and southern winters, i.e. paradoxically during southern and northern summers, i.e. atmospheric pressure is at its height only during spring alias fall). Warming it still further will free up additional carbon dioxide bound up at the poles or in permafrost year around. Both temperature and pressure have to be increased to the point that liquid water can exist in the open, even if only as seasonal dews.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But in this article, we want to look at the biological part of the equation. Obviously we want to, have to, use genetic material from sundry terrestrial plants (possibly animals too) and arrive at species hardy enough to survive and breed on a rejuvenated Mars.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have to start with is, species after species, a long ways from being remotely Mars-hardy. The harshest most demanding habitats on Earth are all much friendlier than the friendliest place on Mars, even possibly on the wetter, warmer Mars of yestereon. Where do we start? How do we proceed?</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The most severe habitats on Earth are the deserts, the Andean altiplano of Peru and Bolivia, the tundra of northern Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Scandinavia, and Russia-Siberia, and the Antarctic islands, shores, and "dry valleys." No trees grow in these areas, not even the stunted, wind-grotesqued caricatures we find at the tree line on mountain slopes and at the tundra limits. Animals fare better, thriving on seafood, other animals and very lowly plants.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Animals, however, need an oxygen-rich atmosphere, which we don't have, have never had, on Mars. Plants, in contrast, thrive on carbon dioxide - it has been shown that most plants can be grown successfully in an artificial atmosphere of reduced pressure (e.g. 1/10th normal) of just carbon dioxide, the major component of Mars air. That is to say, that plants and crops can be grown on Mars in greenhouses pressurized with warmed Martian atmosphere, simply compressed tenfold - nothing else added, besides water, of course. That we could gradually lower temperature and pressure to meet the improving Mars climate halfway with bioengineered species that could be planted outdoors either to be tended and cultivated or left to grow wild is the general idea.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We call this redhousing, rather than greenhousing. We are using the air of the red planet Mars and an improved but still Martian climate - not the air of Earth and an idealized terrestrial climate. This is not to say we shouldn't have traditional greenhouses on Mars. We do have to eat and clothe ourselves and provide for pharmaceuticals and other needs, day in and day out - while we are busy in the redhouses preparing to mate a rejuvenated red planet with a blanket of life bred and engineered to go native there.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will there someday be forests on Mars, with real trees even if they look unearthly. That's a possibility beyond our vision. Our starting point will likely be the lichen, a moss-like plant that is basically a fungus able to survive thanks to a symbiotic relationship with green algae. That this feat is cooperative is discouraging, that we have to start with a very specialized complex - compound creature. The best place to start in any plan to evolve a radiant family of diverse species is with something very generalized, able to survive in a wide range of habitats. But thankfully, we have many species of lichens in the northern hemisphere and a few in the southern.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But are lichens the only starting point? Not necessarily. Many plants handle annual freezing in stride, but the much longer, much deeper freezes of Mars would likely be to much for them. Witness the tree line!</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some antarctic organisms in the animal kingdom, come equipped with an intra-cellular antifreeze - glycol. But plant cells have protoplasm as well. If the gene responsible for the ability to produce glycol can be transferred successfully to some plants, that might give us additional breeding stock for Mars. The more starting points, the more diverse the ultimate possibilities, the more niches on Mars that can be greened.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But hard long freezes are not the only challenges Mars poses. Severe desication is another. Desert plants, like cacti and other "succulents" withstand prolonged very arid stretches well. On Mars the dessicating capacity of the cold parched winds is extremely intense. What the cacti and other desert plants have to offer, will not be enough. But it is a start. Nor is there any reason why the glycol gene cannot be added to the genetic consist of desication-hardy plants, and vice versa. Chile's Atacama, California's Death Valley, NW China's Takla Maklan are among the most challenging niches for desert life. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;And then there is the untempered ultraviolet of the more distant, cooler, Martian "Sun". Mars tenuous atmosphere without free oxygen (O<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>) or ozone (O<FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT>) is transparent to this tissue-killing radiation. Here on Earth, the most UV-resistant species are those that live at very high altitudes. The nearer to the equator, the higher up the maintain slopes does life thrive. Plants growing wild in various niches of the Peruvian-Bolivian altiplano (high altitude 13,000-15,000 ft. intermountain basin-plateau between the Western and Eastern Cordillera) may yield genetic contributors to this resistance. - a third ingredient.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We must add one more characteristic. On Earth many plants are pollinated by insects and birds. Bioengineering animals to breath a carbon dioxide atmosphere seems science-fantastic, not merely science-fictional. So we may want to end up with plants that are wind-pollinated or use some other assist than the help of sweet air breathing animal species. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The list of favorable attributes doesn't end here. We could select also for abrasion resistance to wind-borne dust, low reproductive rates, interruptable life cycles, etc.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;What plant forms will be most receptive to such diverse genetic additions? Your guess is as good as mine. It is not impossible that the best Mars-hardy hybrids will have as ancestors plants that boast none of the assets mentioned, but  will have proven  receptive to all of them.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor do we have to wait until we are on Mars to begin the experimenting. There are so many candidate plants to start with, so many recombinant genetic combinations to be tried. The sooner we begin, and the more the facilities we set up, the sooner are we likely to have our optimism and enthusiasm rewarded - or discouraged.</P><table cellpadding=3><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mars, as we pointed out, all we will need is a shelter that holds compressed, warmed Martian air.</td><td><img src="/images/asi199600052.gif" alt="Diagram of Mars Greenhouse" height=83 width=243></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;On Earth it will be a little trickier. Unbuffered, the facility would be subject to inexorable leaks from the higher pressure, vastly more oxygen-sweet air of the host planet:</td><td><img src="/images/asi199600047.gif" alt="Diagram of Earth Redhouse 1" height=83 width=243></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;One way we can buffer the facility and prevent hasty degradation of the special atmosphere within, is to use a surround chamber with either Earth air or Mars air at relatively low pressure. Air would tend to leak out of the red house chamber, preserving quality, with makeup quantities from special tanks. If pressure in the surround got to high (too close in value to that of the inner chamber) the excess could be pump- exhausted to the outside terrestrial atmosphere.</td><td><img src="/images/asi199600048.gif" alt="Diagram of Earth Redhouse 2" height=83 width=243></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the redhouse could be covered and buffered by water in a host lake or pool or tank. This would also tend to prevent atmospheric contamination. A wet porch could not be used for entry, however, as oxygen dissolved in the water would outgas into the carbon dioxide atmosphere within, polluting it.</td><td><img src="/images/asi199600048.gif" alt="Diagram of Earth Redhouse 3" height=83 width=243></td></tr></table><H4 align=center>An Art of the Possible</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The strategy is one of convergence, breeding ever more cold, drought, and UV hardy species for ever more Mars-like conditions in Mars redhouses Meanwhile, outside the actual Mars climate is improved by human activity and inter-vention. In fact, the degree to which these experiments are successful, will co-determine the goals set for rejuvenescence of the planet. Like politics, the greening of Mars will unfold as the art of the possible. As politics should be (but isn't) it will also be the art of co-promise, not compromise - what can be achieved in improving the climate, temperature, pressure, and wetness of the planet - and what can be achieved by recom-binant DNA biological engineering and breeding for Mars-hardiness. We can only speculate at the results.</P><H4 align=center>The Role of Intervention</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;On Earth, and most likely on all life-bearing planets, evolution has not been smoothed. Each outburst of new species origination slows into a self-stabilizing rut, impeding further progress. It is the periodic decimation of existing species by comet and asteroid impacts that has cleared the way for new evolutionary growth. The future of redhousing will include man-made catastrophes to severely purge prematurely stabilizing indoor ecosystems and clear the way for new rounds of the game of survival of the most (man-determined) fittest.</P><H4 align=center>Redhousing and the Plan for Mars</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;As progress allows us to preview the eventual results, we will know better what areas of Mars to set aside as future areozoic parks and preserves. Low-elevation basins and canyons will have the highest atmospheric pressure, the warmest temperatures (latitude for latitude) and be the first to experience dews and eventually free standing and/or flowing  open water. The Mars Orbital Laser Altimeter aboard the Mars Global Surveyor (November '96 launch, September '97 arrival) will give us a good idea of where these oases-to-be are located. We will then even be able to speculate about setting aside right-of-ways for future parkways.</P><H4 align=center>Redhousing in the Grand Design of Things</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;To return to the point we made at the outset, if Mars is devoid of life, that makes is a virgin world, not a barren one. The cosmic vocation of humanity, unsuspected by all the world's pretentious scriptural traditions, may indeed be to bring life to places where it can survive, but never originate on its own. Only an intelligent species can serve this function. Humanity then becomes "the" reproductive organ of Gaia (meant as the name of Earth-Life in aggregate, not as some mythic meta-individual).</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, through interstellar flight, even if it only be of ships bearing nothing more than seeds, spores, and fertilized eggs, this particular human vocation takes on a more general Cosmic significance, in the Solar neighborhood (probe-reachable limits to be determined!) beyond this nursery womb-world nano-turf we call Earth.</P><font size=2><a href="index.html" target="_top">Back to MMM #93</a></font>&nbsp;<a href="mmm-mars-platform.html">&lt;-</a>&nbsp;<a href="shifting-climate.html">-&gt;</a></BODY></HTML>

("back of envelope") calculations of the material and energy inputs and relocations needed to bring about such changes.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the goal is "terraforming" (making the planet another "Earth") or "Lowellification" (making the planet at least as friendly as we thought it was fifty years ago), or "rejuvenescence" ("restoring" Mars to its wettest and warmest former state of about three billion years ago), the equations are hard to work without good data about the present.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In point of fact, despite all the revelations of the Mariner and Viking missions, we know much less about the Mars of today, than most writers will admit.</P><ol><li><P>We don't know within two or even three orders of magnitude how much water remains on Mars, locked up in the polar caps, in subterranean aquifers and lakes, or chemically bound up in hydrates, or frozen in the interstices of soil particles as permafrost.

Mineralogical assets will also count, of course. And happily, the Tharsis region impinges on the head of the great Valles Marineris canyonland complex where many strata of rock will lay revealed for prospecting ease. Pavonis Mons, a great shield volcano already cited as possibly the most strategic mountain massif in the entire Solar System, its western flank the ideal site for a launch track complex, neighbors this canyonland head region on its eastern flank.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But all this is little more than reasoned speculation. We do know what kind of terrain sports lavatubes on Earth and we do see analogous terrain on Mars. But that's it. On the Moon we have the added advantage of seeing actual examples of partially and wholly collapsed lavatubes (e.g. Hyginus and Hadley Rilles, respectively). Surveying such features on the ground will take generations. If we can search for them with orbiting instruments, our pre-settlement "treasure" maps of Mars will be enormously more helpful and propitious.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;While many, if not most tubes may lie within lava sheet layers that have been subsequently buried by later flows and thus be well below the surface, those in the uppermost flows should lie near enough to the surface to be detectable by appropriately tuned radar.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Given our experience with the quixotic results of some of the Viking lander experiments, it only makes sense to fly such instruments first in low Earth orbit. We can then compare the findings with known "ground truth" and check the verisimilitude of the readings and better correct the calibration. Finding unsuspected tubes in various regions on Earth may be reward enough to merit such a precursor mission.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This being done, a second such orbiter mission could do its tricks in orbit above the Moon, adding enormously to the practical knowledge necessary for intelligent planning of lunar development scenarios. The third tubefinder mission would head for Mars polar orbit. Lessons learned at Earth and at the Moon would allow mission planners to fly the leanest and lightest and least expensive probe to Mars capable of doing the job usefully well.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Would permafrost deposits interfere with the readings and conclusions. Not likely, as the radar wavelengths for the former are LONGER - SHORTER by a factor of X. However the radar instrumentation needed for the two global searches would seem to make made-in-heaven bus mates - a "tundra and tube" mapper. If we did find permafrost and tubes in the same region, and we may not, that would mark the location as especially attractive for settlement development.</P><img align=right src="/images/asi199600050.gif" width=247 height=141 alt="Diagram of Lavatube with Habitat Benefits Noted"><H4>Lavatubes and their Uses:</H4><P>On Earth, these features are typically a few tens of meters wide and high and hundreds to a few thousands of meters long. On the much less gravid Moon, and with the scale of Hadley Rille as evidence, we expect to find lavatubes hundreds of meters wide, and many tens of kilometers long. On Mars, with its in between 3/8ths normal gravity, we might expect such features to be in between in size, say 50- 100 meters wide and a few kilometers long. On both the Moon and Mars, "tubing" will be a major outdoor hobby, akin to limestone cave spelunking on Earth.</P><font size=2><a href="index.html" target="_top">Back to MMM #93</a></font>&nbsp;<a href="mars-lavatubes.html">&lt;-</a>&nbsp;<a href="permafrost.html">-&gt;</a></BODY></HTML>

Also called pergelisol.</P><H4>Where do we find permafrost (on Earth)?</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We find permafrost mostly in circum arctic lands of Alaska, Canada (Northwest Territories, northern Quebec, northern Labrador), Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia (Norway, especially), and Russia-Siberia. Permafrost is the soil condition that manifests itself in "tundra" type no-root or shallow-root vegetation.</P><H4>How does permafrost form?</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Permafrost forms in ground water areas through gradual transition to ever more severe winters and ever shorter and cooler summers. The deeper the ground water penetrates, and the greater the water content per volume of soil, the thicker and richer the permafrost layer.</P><H4>Why do we think there may be extensive permafrost deposits on Mars?</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is abundant evidence from high resolution Viking photos of landforms for which the  only plausible explanation is that they were formed by water: tear drop shaped islands in the middle of large valleys, relic beaches and ancient shorelines, wave-sculpted dry lake and sea shore bottoms, deltas and estuaries, flood-carved channels. From such evidence, it has become clear that Mars even sported a respectable northern hemisphere ocean that once covered more than a third of the planet to respectable depths. Not all of this water could have evaporated or sublimated into space. Archaic water-saturated lake and sea bottoms should have retained their water content as the climate got colder and the ground froze to deeper and deeper levels.</P><H4>Where on Mars is permafrost most likely to be found?</H4><P><img src="/images/asi199600053.gif" align=right width=191 height=177 alt="Globe of Mars Showing Permafrost Deposits">&nbsp;&nbsp;The likeliest areas of significant permafrost deposits are the ancient northern ocean bottomlands, deep major impact basin bottoms like Hellas and Argyre, and canyon bottoms (especially the outflow areas like the Ares Valley landing site for the Mars Pathfinder lander. Unfortunately, this lander is not providentially equipped to test for permafrost underfoot. It is typical that the kind of knowledge most needed to assess settlement feasibilities is low on the priority list of planetary scientists interested primarily in scratching the itches of their own narrow scientific curiosities. Both Vikings likewise landed in areas in which we might expect to find substantial permafrost deposits, a condition that went untested.)</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Permafrost could have formed in adjacent areas not covered by standing water through the lateral spread of ground water, and in still other areas if subject to seasonal rainfall.</P><H4>What, if any, would be the significance of permafrost on Mars for future settlement / development?</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>On Earth</B>, (a) permafrost renders the land agriculturally unproductive, although tundra lichens and other vegetation is sufficient to maintain a large wildlife population of caribou, rabbits, and other hardy arctic fauna. (b) Buildings must be set on bedrock or thermally isolated from the ground, commonly by use of stilts made of materials with low heat conductivity, along with effective use of insulation to prevent heat radiating from the bottom of the building to the frozen soil below. The stilts should raise the underside of the building high enough above the ground to allow free air and wind circulation. (c) Road building creates special problems, witness the special measures that had to be taken during the construction of the Alaska Pipeline.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>On Mars</B>, seasonal thaws may not be a problem at first, but may become less and less rare as human activities, planned and unplanned, lead to a significant warming of the Martian climate. (a) For this reason, outposts in permafrost areas will be especially challenging to build and maintain. Settlement may be limited to areas of patchy permafrost, with construction held to frigid but not ice-saturated soil and rock areas. (b) Only those areas where the 'topsoil' is 'active', i.e. thawing seasonally, will be colonizaible by bioengineered Mars-hardy plant varieties developed through an aggressive redhousing program.</P><table><tr><td>Mars outpost on stilts- insulated</td><td><img src="/images/asi199600054.gif" width=250 height=144 alt="Image of Raised Outpost"></td></tr><tr><td>Mars subsurface outpost - insulated</td><td><img src="/images/asi199600055.gif" width=245 height=189 alt="Image of Buried Outpost"></td></tr><tr><td>Mars subsurface outpost in "patchy" area</td><td><img src="/images/asi199600056.gif" width=247 height=114 alt="Image of Underground Outpost"></td></tr></table><H4>How can we tap permafrost water assets?</H4><OL><P><LI>We could strip mine the permafrost layers and then run them through melting ovens on conveyors, redepositing the dried soil back in place, all in one operation. This could be more mechanically difficult than it sounds, with lots of equipment breakdowns, given the hardness of the soil/ice aggregate.</P><P><LI>We could heat the deposits in situ (in place) and then pumping out the freed and liquefied water if excess waste heat at a high enough temperature is available. This requires drilling holes for heat conducting rods or super-heated steam pipes. Such waste heat would be available if the outpost had a small nuclear plant both for heat, power and for extraction of various atmospheric gasses.<P><li>We can cover the frozen ground with an "infrared-black" plastic tarp and apply concentrated solar heating.</P></ol><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whichever method we use to extract the ice-melt, it may be necessary, if the water proves to be saline, to distill the melt to purify it of salts (and possibly heavy metals). A few "ground truth" cores taken by rover drilling probes would soon establish just how fresh or how brackish the permafrost ice is, and whether it varies in quality from place to place.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Excess water produced by an outpost's local permafrost tap may then be trucked, or air-lifted, or eventually pipelined to other less advantaged settlements and outposts. Thus, water could well be the first real intra-Mars trade commodity. (A futures market, anyone?)</P><H4>What alternative sources of water are there?</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Other most options for providing water needed for drinking and hygiene, agriculture and life support, processing and manufacturing do exist:</P><OL><P><LI>Nuclear powered atmospheric hydro-extraction plants are certainly feasible. In 10,000 tons of Mars air, there are 3 tons of water vapor, i.e. 0.03%, along with 7 tons of oxygen and 270 tons of nitrogen, both of which would also be extracted as byproducts. Each outpost or settlement is likely to have such a plant anyway, to produce carbon monoxide and methane fuels as well as fresh oxygen and nitrogen. The question is, will such a plant produce enough water in the process to meet demands, or will this "air-water" need to be supplemented?</P><P><LI>A much bolder and higher cost option would be to mine ice from the edge of the north polar cap (the southern cap may be mostly carbon dioxide frost). Melted, this glacial melt could then be trucked (requiring roads or ground effect vehicles) or (especially later as population on Mars and demand grows) a network of aqueducts would follow the paths imagined by Schiaparelli and Lowell from the north polar cap southwards.</P></oL><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;One or both of these options can serve "ice-dry" areas of Mars.</P><H4>Putting together a Mars Permafrost Map - Now</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because extensive permafrost zones are found here on Earth (some continuous, some discontinuous, some patchy), we have an ideal opportunity to fly the needed radar instrument package in polar Earth orbit to both test how well it can detect permafrost and to properly calibrate the instruments by checking their readings with actual data on the ground, so we will have greater confidence in interpreting the readings we get in flying an identical instrument package around Mars. We need to determine how well depth of the layer below the surface, ice content percentage, and thickness of the deposits are indicated in the readings, and whether differences in salinity or other factors affect the data points we get.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If flown alone (not with lavatube radar) as co-op U.S.-Russian mission, Bering (Russian-born explorer of Alaska, Vitus Bering) might be a good name for the probe. Mars Permafrost Mapper would be an alternate choice.</P><font size=2><a href="index.html" target="_top">Back to MMM #93</a></font>&nbsp;<a href="mars-lavatubes.html">&lt;-</a>&nbsp;<a href="pres-letter.html">-&gt;</a></BODY></HTML>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We're finally getting the Technical Committees organized!
This month we collected all the information on who has volunteered for
which committee, and set up a structure for managing the work.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Space Flight Technical Council is the core of this
organization, responsible for both the technical committees and the project
teams. NOTE: Where we haven't formally established agreements with the
supporting organizations, we're still listing Greg Bennett as acting in
those roles.[*]</P>

<H4>Technical Council Administrator</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:cddicks@aol.com">Candace Dicks</a>, the
Technical Council Administrator, maintains the records of each committee's
membership, charter, and any other adminsitrative information the OSF
needs.  She also maintains this information on Artemis Society
International's world wide web site.  Soon you'll be able to look up each
technical committee and project team on the web.  The main index is at <a
target="_top" href="/adb/06/07/">http://www.asi.org/adb/06/07/</a>.</P>

<H4>Configuration Management Data Base Administrator: </H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Doug Cross is Administrator for the Configuration Management
Data Base, and leader of the configuration management team.  We're still
working out the best tools to define and maintain the reference
configuration. When you come up with a configuration option that changes
the weight, cost, or whatever for a part of the spacecraft, Doug will
update the data base.</P>

<P>&nbsp;We're (literally) a <a href="/adb/07/local-chapters.html"
target="_top">world-wide</a> organization, so we can generate a lot of
chaos.  To keep the chaos under control, we'll establish a system where the
reference configuration gets updated when the update is approved by the
project team leader who is reponsible for that part of the spacecraft.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each member of the Technical Council is reponsible for
managing the work of the organizations within each discipline.  The
following tables list which committees and project teams report to each
member of the Technical Council.</P>

It's not unusual for actors to get into the movie production side of the business, but what is unusual is the name of Hanks' company:  Clavius Base.  Asked to explain, Hanks was quoted in Daily Variety:  "It's from 2001: A Space Odyssey.  When that came out in 1968, I couldn't sleep the night before.  It was the first time I was moved in a different way by a movie. The character in the movie was going to Clavus Base in a moon bus.  It's also the name of the biggest crater on the Moon.

By 1990 von Braun had hoped to have 24 people in lunar orbit and 48 people living on the surface of the Moon engaged in mining, astronomy, biology, selenology (lunar geology), seismology, regional exploration, and planetary quarantine.

Here's our "generic" answer:</P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>What Oregon Moonbase isn't -- and is</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether there's anything to see at our experimental site depends on what you're looking for. There are no improvements at the site (other than fences), no facilities or experiments currently in place. (No restrooms, no water ...)</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;What we do have is a set of lava tube caves, basalt terrain, and sand mixed with volcanic dust, a useful analog to dusty lunar regolith. Our site can be made available for experimenters wishing to bring their own equipment into a primitive site and test it.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past we have brought in Young Astronauts and adults and equipment, built a small operational base, and conducted Moon Base exercises. After each trip we dismantled the equipment and returned it to its sponsoring institution, the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI). A Rockwell engineer also tested a prototype "lunar cart" at the site, and we performed under NASA contract to characterize the site and plan a full-service experimental facility there.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We prefer some other season than midwinter to visit our site, because it is east of the Cascade mountains in Oregon's high desert (3700' elevation) country. Although the site is usually (not always) clear, the roads to the site from our homes in the Willamette Valley cross high mountain passes that are frequently and often unpredictably covered with snow and ice. Visits are more conveniently scheduled between mid-April to mid-October, although we will be happy to try anytime anyone is interested and available.</P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>IF you are interested in visiting lava tube caves</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are caves on public lands open year-round if you can get there. Ape Cave on the southern slopes of Mt. St. Helens is open even if its little visitor's office is closed, and other caves exist west of Trout Lake (town) in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in southern Washington. In Oregon, Lava River Cave is open right next to highway U.S. 97 south of Bend, for a small fee, and lanterns are available there for rent. This is a large cave easily accessible just a few hundred yards off a main thoroughfare.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Other large caves are scattered on the north and south slopes of Newberry Mountain south of Bend, marked on USGS and Forest Service maps (Deschutes National Forest; Newberry Volcanic Monument). Note that Newberry is a large shield volcano similar to those seen on Mars (but not as big as they are!). All of  the Bend-area caves are in lavas associated with Newberry (the City of Bend is built on Newberry lavas).</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Another shield volcano is Medicine Lake volcano east of Mt. Shasta in northern California. A world-class collection of dramatic lava tube caves exists on the far northern flank of Medicine Lake, set aside as Lava Beds National Monument. It is probably the best place to study lava tube caves in the continental U.S. The nearest significant town is Klamath Falls in southern Oregon. We highly recommend Lava Beds for lava tube studies. Winter is not the best time to visit this area.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a volcanic field with some lava tubes in New Mexico's El Malpais / Bandera Volcano wilderness, west of Albuquerque. These are not quite as large as the northwest caves, and tend to be more eroded, rockfall choked, and are possibly older.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We also recommend Hawaii for lava tube caves. They are still being made there today. Best place is the Big Island (Hawaii), but caves also exist on Oahu, Kauai, and probably the other islands as well. We've heard about large lava tube caves in Korea, Australia, and the Canary Islands.</P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Getting in touch</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're interested in meeting and talking to our Lunar Base Research Team, we have an office space available in Portland and are always glad to get together to talk about our research and other space issues. Since we have other, paying jobs, it would be easiest to meet on a weekend.</P><P>Let us know if you want to get together sometime.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>Bryce Walden, Chair, Oregon L5 Research Team<br>Oregon L5 Society<br>P.O.

Schultz</FONT><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently read a very interesting book, which I believe is very helpful in explaining the decline of zeal for space exploration and colonization.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><tt><B>The Sixties Spiritual Awakening: </B>American Religion Moving From Modern to Postmodern, by Robert S. Ellwood, 1994 Rutgers University Press</tt></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellwood is a sociology of religion scholar, and his book contains one of the best discussions I have ever seen of the multifarious impact which the Sixties have had on our society. The result of this impact is the now predominating post-modernist spirit - a spirit which differs radically from the modernism which preceded it.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Ellwood's discussion of what this post-modernism means for America's space activities is quite brief, it gets to the heart of the matter. Here is what he says concerning the first manned lunar landing:</P><BLOCKQUOTE>"In the 1990s as one watches videos of the epochal event, one vicariously participates in an adventure inherently gripping yet oddly dated in mentality and means, like a tale from Homer. Despite the 1969 talk of the heroic venture of Michael Collins, Neil Armstrong, and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin as only the first step in a great human exploration of the universe, one feels intuitively [that] it was rather the last great moment in an era now closed. ... The Apollo-Saturn missions were isolated adventures, like Odysseus's, not new Columbian voyages. ... the Moon landing was a supreme and last expression of the American modernist spirit, ... invincibly confident in its technological skill and its righteous use thereof, believing in progress forever." (pp. 305, 306)</BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the spirit which generated the American space program and carried it into its glory days, culminating in the Apollo lunar missions, is no longer the ruling and guiding spirit in America, according to Ellwood. That spirit - the "modernist" spirit - has now been supplanted by the "post-modernist" spirit, which is antipathetical to the optimism, heroism, dynamism, and objectivism of the modernist era.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If Ellwood's analysis is correct, and I believe it is, then it explains why space activists are having to fight an "uphill" battle. The real obstacle we face is not a lack of funds or technology, but the postmodernist spirit, which does not share our vision. The reason we have to fight to "take back the dream" and "recover the vision" of Apollo is that the postmodernist spirit has repudiated the vision and dream of space. This cynical postmodernism scoffs at the conquest of space as a grandiose notion. The postmodernist hegemony began in the early 1970s. This is why, instead of becoming the springboard to the colonization of space, the lunar landing became instead "the last great moment in an era now closed". That in a nutshell is Ellwood's diagnosis of the contemporary malaise.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that Ellwood's interpretation is correct, as far as it goes. But I think that it needs to be supplemented with an accurate understanding of the modernist spirit, without which, one may be misled into the common misconception of supposing that the nature of modernism was totally at odds with the preceding medieval era. This is far from true. The modernist era incorporated (via secularization) many ideas from the medieval mind. One of the most important of these earlier ideas is what David A. Dunlop calls "The Value of the Grand Vision and the Long Trajectory" in his essay "An Appropriate Environment for Man" on pages 9-11 of the October '95 issue of Moon Miners' Manifesto (issue # 89).</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example of this Grand Vision/Long Trajectory idea, Dunlop refers to the construction of the great European cathedrals, and then contrasts this with "The Tyranny of the Short Term Standard", which is the currently accepted outlook:</P><BLOCKQUOTE>"We seem to have lost culturally the capacity that existed during the middle ages which concerned itself with 'meeting the requirements of God' even if it took generations to fulfill such requirements. The constructions of the great cathedrals of Europe were the work of centuries spanning many generations. <I>No such clear sense of over arching necessity of purpose exists today for any national or international project </I>...We don't aspire to visions of new worlds. The output of enormous effort in the here and now that will not see completion in one's lifetime is a very alien and even humorous idea in an era which is increasingly conditioned to short term expectations of accomplishment and maximized individual consumption." (p. 10, emphasis his)</BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dunlop then cites two examples of the "Grand Vision / Long Trajectory" from the modernist era in America, namely the purchases of the Louisiana Territory and of Alaska.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>"When the opportunity arose for the purchase of the Louisiana Territory from the French, the amount represented a substantial portion of the entire budget of the United States in 1805. Yet Jefferson, looking ahead over the course of a century or two, realized that the purchase price was an infinitesimal portion of the true value of what was being offered. Against opposition, he persuaded Congress to take the plunge. On a smaller scale, 'Seward's folly' of purchasing Alaska for 67 million dollars in the mid 1860s was another such uncommon example of the long term view prevailing. The economic wisdom of Jefferson and Seward is now clearly apparent after well over a century has passed, but the territorial gain and economic gain of other planets, the Moon, and Mars has eluded every President and Congress since Nixon!" (p. 10, emphasis his).</BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I firmly believe, as I have stated in previous articles, and as most other space activists believe, that we must strive to radically reduce the <a href="/adb/02/07/01/02/">costs of getting to</a> and living in space. But this is not enough. It is even more important that we fight against the prevailing cynical myopic post-modernist spirit, and seek to restore the greatness which Western Culture had during its  medieval and modernist eras, when the then predominant Grand Vision & Long Trajectory idea inspired men to dream great dreams and accomplish great works. Let's face it: even with Cheap Access to Space (CATS) and Cheap Utilization of the Resources of Space (CURS) [Ed. an unfortunate acronym!], it is still going to take an enormous amount of money, materials, and manpower to create a spacefaring civilization. People will not be inclined to make this kind of investment in the future until they have been liberated from the postmodernist slough of despondency and set free to once again dream the great dream of fulfilling the next great step in the Dominion Mandate - building the "cathedrals" of the next millennium: human settlements in space.</P><P><FONT SIZE=2>Forrest W.

With the encouragement of NSS VP Glenn Wilson and the Executive Committee and financial pledges from numerous Governors, the Governors proceeded to arrange for a re-study of the data [Inside NSS, Dec. 94/Jan 95] Downs' report to the Governors follows:</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have further information on the matter of the Viking tests for Martian life. You may recall that the negative findings obtained with the instrument known as the GCMS were brought into question by seemingly contradictory results obtained some years ago by John Lavoie as a part of his PhD dissertation at MIT. As you recall, the GCMS [Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer] was deposited  on the Martian surface and tested the Martian soil for molecules of biological origin. It found none within its threshold of detection, implying no Martian life.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lavoie, however, tested a sample of Antarctic soil with a laboratory replica of the GCMS and reported that while the Viking instrument gave a negative result - i.e., no biological molecules in the sample - another lab test [Labeled Release experiment], for organic carbon, showed a relatively large amount of organic carbon. Organic carbon usually means carbon of biological origin.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, taken at face value, the implication in Lavoie's results was that the GCMS was relatively insensitive to biological molecules. Therefore, there could be such molecules, and life, on Mars after all.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Before proceeding further to resolve this apparent contradiction, it seemed prudent to test the reproducibility of Lavoie's results. On recommendation of Dr. Sam Epstein, eminent Cal Tech biochemist, Dr. Jastrow consulted Professor John Cronin of Arizona State University, who specialized in testing for organic matter in meteorites. Dr. Jastrow asked for his help in re-doing Lavoie's experiments on the same sample of Antarctic soil Lavoie had used (kept in a freezer at NASA's Ames Center all these years), to see if he would get the same results as Lavoie.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Cronin has now reported to us that he has found that this Antarctic soil sample does contain carbon, as Lavoie reported, but it appears to be carbon in the form of coal dust rather than carbon in the form of biological molecules (there are large coal deposits in the Antarctic).</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This result would appear to eliminate the contradiction between Lavoie's finding of carbon in that Antarctic soil sample and the GCMS result that there were no detec-table biological molecules in this sample.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Cronin is tidying up his experiments with a view to publishing a research note. However, in view of his findings, it appears at this time that thee is no reason to pursue that line or revisionist inquiry further. In the view of Dr. Jastrow and others - which I share - the question of Martian life is still open and will only be settled when we can take subsurface samples in a variety of Martian environments. But we will have to wait for a Mars landing before we obtain a definitive answer by that route.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to bringing you up to date, in the meantime, I want to thank those who contributed to the new research that has brought these results. While they don't, of course, offer proof that no life exists on Mars, they do indicate closure for the investigation we helped fund.</P><P>With best wishes,<BR>Hugh Downs<BR>Chairman, NSS Board of Governors</P><P><HR><P><P>[Letter]</P><H3>Mars: Labeled Release Experiment; raising the temperature of Mars; a billion years of aridity; life's responses to stress.</H3><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The romantic spirit lives! For only a romantic fool looks at the Viking Labeled Release data set and discerns in that mess a "clear and positive indication" of some earthly phenomenon. One lander pushed aside a stone to get a sample from underneath it.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The residual polar cap radiates thermal infrared at 160&#176;K [-113&#176;C, -171&#176;F]. To sublime it, [the frozen carbon dioxide component, anyway] we must raise its temperature to 213&#176;k [-60&#176;C, -76&#176;F]. Adding 1012 metric tons of CFCs to Mars' atmos-phere raises the global mean temperature almost exactly 53&#176; [K or C, 95&#176; F]. Now, where do we get a trillion tons of CFCs? And how do we transport them to Mars?</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Life copes well with  extremes of temperature, pressure, pH [acidity - alkalinity], and radiation, but not with extreme dryness. A billion arid years without rain or running water will kill anything.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;On Earth, recognizable paleomicrofossils appear in shales, cherts, and limestones, tough rocks that resist weathering yet preserve the evidence. Outcrops of these rock types on Mars would be of great interest to explorers. We need a geochemical map of the planet.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Lynn Margulis, microbial sex fiend and co-creator of the Gaia religion, has presented evidence that cells created viruses, viroids, prions, and the like, as packets to salvage genetic information under environmental stress: i.e. when the water wasn't boiling, where deadly free oxygen was present, or where unfiltered UV poured down from the skies.</P><P>-- Jeff Sanburg, Skokie, Illinois</P><font size=2><a href="index.html" target="_top">Back to MMM #93</a></font>&nbsp;<a href="book-review.html">&lt;-</a>&nbsp;<a href="isdc-ideas.html">-&gt;</a></BODY></HTML>

Two fuel combinations are possible:  "Carmonox" engines will burn carbon monoxide (2 CO +O<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>); "Methanox" or "Oochie" engines will burn methane (O<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT> + CH<FONT SIZE=1>4</FONT>). Methane is the more powerful fuel and will be the fuel of choice if reasonably salt-free water can easily be produced from permafrost taps.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The GOAL of this tech demo is not a vehicle chassis suitable for Martian terrain, but an engine that can be used in any such vehicle: car, truck, coach, caterpillar, etc.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;START: There are now any number of experimental methane burning vehicles already on the road. REPLACE the carburetor with bottled oxygen and combine with the methane in an INTERNAL COMBUSTION cycle, not a rocket motor.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;AND DEBUG. DEMO at ISDC '98 Milwaukee.</P><H4>A Mars Airplane</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The density of Martian air at average surface levels is equivalent to the atmospheric pressure on Earth at 125,000 ft., an altitude that can be reached by a balloon-mounted platform. DESIGN, BUILD, and FLY an unpiloted airplane to and from such a platform - at or during ISDC '98 Milwaukee.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul Swift of the Ontario Space Society (ISDC '94 Toronto) has expressed an interest in taking up this challenge.</P><H4>Mars Meteorburst Experiment</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Meteorburst communications which bounce messages off the electronic debris trails of incoming meteors high in the atmosphere have been used successfully for over-the-horizon communications by long distance trucking companies. The devices never have to wait more than a second or two before finding a suitable placed meteorburst.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because these events occur high up, this system also should work well on Mars, as a reliable backup to a more expensive to deploy and maintain satellite communications system. DESIGN, BUILD, and FLY such a system, again aboard a balloon-hung platform at an altitude of 125,000 feet.</P><H4>Igloo shielding sebatier reactor</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can shielding be manufactured by a sebatier reactor from atmospheric components on Mars? If so, a small nuclear thermal power plant could enshield a telerobotically landed Mars habitat module or complex without disturbing the boulder-strewn and possibly permafrost-hardened soil all around the campsite.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;One possibility, in theory, is DiNitrogen Pentoxide, N<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>0<FONT SIZE=1>5</FONT>, which is a white powder throughout the whole range of Martian ambient temperatures. It is dangerously chemically unstable, however. A much safer product would be simple carbon (graphite) dust, powder, or crystals.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;DESIGN, BUILD, and DEBUG a sebatier reactor device to start with a Mars-like atmospheric mix and end up with such an inert thermal shielding powder. Make note of any potentially useful atmospheric byproducts produced in the process. DEMO at ISDC '98 Milwaukee.</P><H4>Mars Hovercraft or Skimmer</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Traversing Mars boulder-cluttered strewn-fields will be slow going and impede easy, frequent, and timely travel between outpost sites on Mars by wheeled vehicles or legged walkers. A hovercraft which could skim over such routine obstacles at speed would open up the planet like nothing else could. Mars' low atmospheric density, however, makes a traditionally designed hovercraft infeasible. If the weight of such a vehicle, with cargo and fuel, could be partially (say 90%?) compensated by hydrogen aerodynamically-styled buoyancy bags, perhaps such vehicles could work. Hydrogen is safe to handle on Mars where there is no free oxygen to speak of.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;DESIGN, BUILD, TEST, and DEBUG a scale model Mars Skimmer. DEMO at ISDC '98 Milwaukee.</P><H4>A Mars "Redhouse"</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike a "greenhouse" which maintains terrestrial plants under Earth-normal ideal growing conditions in less than ideal climates, a "redhouse" would be pressurized with relatively pure Carbon Dioxide, CO<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>. BEGIN with the hardiest plants known on Earth, lichens and other tundra plants; plants that thrive in the high altiplano of the Andes, and at the tree line of other high altitude areas; plants that thrive in desert conditions; plants which survive intense cold.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The eventual goal of "redhousing" will be to breed ever hardier and hardier hybrids which someday may take hold and survive outdoors on a Mars where human intervention has succeeded in meeting them halfway by raising the carbon dioxide atmospheric pressure and ambient temperatures.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;For ISDC '98 Milwaukee, the goal is simply to DEMO a redhouse chamber with controls capable of varying the pressure and temperature.</P><H4>HOW TO PROCEED:</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Game Plan:</B> Gather a group with the right mix of expertise, brainstorm a design, proice the materials and tools you will need, and make a presentation to potential corporate sponsors.</P><font size=2><a href="index.html" target="_top">Back to MMM #93</a></font>&nbsp;<a href="viking-restudy.html">&lt;-</a>&nbsp;<a href="nss-platform.html">-&gt;</a></BODY></HTML>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Moon Miners' Manifesto Issue #93</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><!-- /093/nss-fax-tree.html --><H2 align=center>NSS Media FAX Tree FAQ</H2><P><HR WIDTH=80%></P><FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:cew@acm.org">Craig E. Ward</a>, NSS VP for Chapter Affairs</FONT><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>What is a Media FAX Tree?</H4><P>The FAX Tree is a distributed publicity and media outreach tool. The Chapters of NSS, in cooperation with and independently of, the national leadership, operate FAX Tree hubs.  Each hub is comprised of one or more chapters, depending on the density of chapters, and available volunteer resources.</p><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Cooperative operation of the FAX Tree entails:</H4><P>Retransmission of NSS generated press release material. Independent operation by the chapter for publicity for local chapter events. Other material the chapter finds useful to the promotion of space development. The costs associated with operating a hub of the FAX Tree will be born by the chapter.</P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Why a Media FAX Tree?</H4><P>A media FAX Tree can raise the level of visibility of those organizing it.  The San Diego L5 chapter has been, more-or-less consistently, sending the local San Diego media announcements of their events and policy views for the last two years.  At first, their efforts seemed to fall into some gigantic Black Hole, but, by keeping it up, they have started getting significant attention.  Last September, a local San Diego news program sent a reporter and crew to cover a normal, regular SDL5 lecture at the Ruben H. Fleet Space Museum and Theater.  The SDL5 chapter made the 11 p.m. news!</P><P>Although local media singly do not have the same audience numbers as national networks or big city newspapers, together they approach or exceed those numbers. The Los Angeles Times may be the only newspaper you can find in every part of Southern California, but the circulations of the Daily Breeze, Long Beach Press-Telegram, Orange County Register and Los Angeles Daily News are definitely non-trivial.  A local chapter Media FAX Tree can enhance the ability of NSS to get its message out to literally millions of people.</P><P>With additional effort, the success of SDL5 could be translated to other NSS chapters in the U.S. giving chapters greater local media presence and enhancing the visibility of NSS beyond the national networks. A cooperative effort of local chapters and national leaders could enhance the effects and reduce the time needed to attract the attention of local media.</P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>What does the NSS do for the FAX Tree?</H4><P>The National organization provides the following:</P><ul><li>Press Releases and Background Material for distribution to the administrators of each hub.<li>The electronic mail list for distributing Press Release text.<li>Review of copies of NSS releases sent by chapters for quality control and audit.</ul><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>What does the Chapter need to do?</H4><P>A chapter will need to provide the volunteers to:</P><ul><li>Administer the fax device (usually a PC or Macintosh). <li>Receive fax materials from both NSS and the local chapter.<li>Perform quality control.<li>Find one or more volunteers to respond to any inquiries from the media.</ul><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>What are the likely costs to the Chapter?</H4><P>That will depend on the equipment you use and your telephone company rates. In Southern California, the first activations for OASIS and OCSS cost a bit more than $10 for approximately 60 FAX calls.  Costs can be kept to a minimum by letting the computer make the FAX calls during late night or early morning hours when phone rates are lowest.</P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Where can we get the FAX numbers?</H4><P>The best place is the local public library.  Look for:</P><BLOCKQUOTE>Karen Troshynski-Thomas, Ed., Gale Directory of Publica-tions and Broadcast Media, Gale Research, Inc., 1995. ISBN 0-8103-5655-4.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>You can also try the telephone book. One resource that did not prove useful was the ProCD FAX Book CD-ROM.  None of the major outlets in Los Angeles were included in its listings.  It probably would not include many in your area either.</P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>How should the local FAX Tree list be organized?</H4><P>Organize the list around the kinds of press releases you will be doing.  Roughly, there are three kinds of releases and your list should be able to access the proper targets for each kind.</P><ul><li>A Community Calendar release gives details of an upcoming event.  You are asking the publication or station to list your event in their calendars.<li>Press releases informing the media of your opinions on an issue or providing some background material to help someone understand an issue better. Media Advisories for newsworthy events that a reporter may wish to cover.</UL><P>Sometimes an event can use more than one of the above.  For example, a meeting notice would be sent to the Community Calendar portion of the list 2- to 3-weeks in advance and a Media Advisory sent to the news editor portion 2- or 3-days before the same event describing why the event should be covered.</P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Who should receive a FAX?</H4><P>Unless you have established a relationship with a particular person in a media organization, address event notices to the Community Calendar Editor and the other two to the News Editor. The people internal to the media organization should route the FAX to the correct person.

Mars weighs in some 5 times heavier than the Moon, giving it more gravity [3/8ths vs. 1/6th Earth-standard] and hence a bigger/wider/deeper gravity well. This means it will "catch" more asteroidal and cometary debris, and impose on it higher velocities of acceleration prior to impact.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mars' tenuous atmosphere will burn up the micrometeorite stuff, so that the Martian surface is not subject to the steady "rain" that the lunar surface undergoes. It would follow that the dust on Mars comes from weathering, rather than impact "gardening". But the larger stuff will not be stopped and much will get through that incinerates in Earth's much thicker atmosphere.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Mars is much closer to the main asteroid belt and probably is exposed to a thicker concentration of debris than is the Earth-Moon system.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not be misled by visual and photographic comparisons of the Martian and Lunar surfaces at various resolutions. Unlike the Moon,  Mars experiences real weather (wind, and scattered freeze-thaw cycles) and formerly underwent major episodes of volcanic activity. This gives its surface a deceptively younger, less impact-scarred look.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to scare anyone away. The heavy lunar bombardment we see happened mostly more than 3 eons [3 billion years] ago, and danger to pioneers will be less than us terrestrials face in volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, lightning, avalanches, landslides and other catastrophes from Earth's active geology and weather systems. The same should be true on Mars.</P><P> - Thomas Heidel, Milwaukee, Wisconsin</P><P>EDITOR: Thanks Tom. You have summed up the situation accurately.</P><H3 align=center>Why the boxes and bars filled with random dots?</H3><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, you have been closing articles [on the printed version of MMM] written by you with "MMM" in a box filled with random dots. This same kind of dot-filled box has appeared as bars in the masthead, and now bars in the footers at the bottom of each page, as well as in the "state" bars preceding the various chapters in the chapter news section. What is the symbolism here?<P> - Simon Cook, Phoenix, Arizona</P><P>EDITOR: The symbolism, I had hoped, would be clear. The random dots stand for "regolith", that is the lunar (and asteroidal, and Martian) soil composed of fine and coarser particles of rock and glass. This inorganic soil covers these worlds with a blanket inches to meters thick and consists mostly of bombardment debris and meteoritic material. In the case of Mars, regolith also includes wind-deposited products of weathering. For me, the regolith is the very quintessence of the frontier, its mineral makeup posing early limits to what pioneers can do by way of self-reliance and "living off the land", and setting the scope of the challenge for frontier settlements. I should have made this clear at the outset.</P><font size=2><a href="index.html" target="_top">Back to MMM #93</a></font>&nbsp;<a href="nss-fax-tree.html">&lt;-</a>&nbsp;<a href="rtg-told-you-so.html">-&gt;</a></BODY></HTML>

Pro-space groups, including the National Space Society and its Metro Orlando Space Society chapter, opposed these efforts, as they have in the case of more recent missions such as Ulysses and Cassini. NSS appeared as a friend of the court in litigation over Ulysses, and has successfully forced NASA to discuss the environmental benefits of the Cassini mission as part of the Environmental Impact Statement process for that mission. But the spotlight is on Galileo today.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"We were told that the launch of these probes would be dangerous and would produce little scientific value," notes NSS Executive Director Lori Garver.  "The results here speak for themselves."</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most absurd claim" of the Galileo opponents, notes Glenn Reynolds, member of the NSS Board of Directors, "was that the RTGs would 'make Jupiter radioactive,' -- when, as everyone knew all along, and as Galileo has reminded us, Jupiter already was radioactive."</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it unfair to bring this up now?  No, says Reynolds.  "If Galileo had produced a disaster, its opponents would be saying 'we told you so.'  But since their overblown fears turned out to be wrong -- just as we said at the time -- it's our turn."</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, both Reynolds and Garver note, the Galileo probe has produced a torrent of information about what the Giant Planet is really like. Such knowledge enriches our understanding of the Solar System and, quite possibly, of many processes on Earth.  "Most of our terrestrial climate models -- including those used to study the greenhouse effect and other environmental problems -- are descendants of models originally developed to study the climate of Mars," notes Garver.  "Who knows what benefits will come from learning more about Jupiter?" "Like its namesake," Reynolds notes, "Galileo was attacked by the ignorant.  And like its namesake, it has been vindicated."</P><font size=2><a href="index.html" target="_top">Back to MMM #93</a></font>&nbsp;<a href="mailbox.html">&lt;-</a>&nbsp;-&gt;</BODY></HTML>

<H1>R. Alonzo Fyfe</H1>
<B>departmental manager, ethicist, writer</B><HR>

<H3>Role in the Artemis Project:</H3>

<P><a href="mailto:pegasus@indra.com">R. Alonzo Fyfe</a> joined the <a
href="/asi_index.html">Artemis Society International</a> in February 1996
and was immediately put to work reviewing the membership structure. Since
then, he has worked on various near-term projects for the Artemis Project,
brochures and other documents for distribution, and so on.</P>

<P>Alonzo makes an excellent contribution to the Artemis Team, and adds his
excellent thought and judgment to the various projects
under development. He makes good use of his understanding of marketing,
economics, business and administration in general, and philosophical issues
related to the Artemis Project.</P>

<h3>Personal History</h3>

<P>Alonzo was born on July 15, 1960, and lived his first nine years in a house
whose back yard touched the U.S./Canadian border. Legally, he was required
to clear customs to retrieve the balls that escaped the yard, but found it
easier just to go get them. To this day he finds very little significance in
national borders.</P>

<P>Apollo 11, the first lunar landing, launched the day after his 9th birthday.
He was already very interested in space travel and liked to think of the
Apollo launch as a slightly late birthday present.</P>

<P>Later that year, his family moved to Great Falls, Montana. [Note: This is
the home of Malmstrom AFB, where the VentureStar will be landing for the
last 13 of its 15 test flights - so he plans to be visiting his home town
often starting in mid 1999.]</P>

<P>At the age of 15, when other high school students were buying stereos, he
bought a used 6" Newtonian reflector telescope and spent the next three
years looking
at the
stars in the clear Montana skies. A couple of years later, when classmates
were buying cars, he took out his first loan in order to buy one of the
first personal computers on the market. All the late nights he spent with
his telescope caused his grades to suffer, but not his education. For
example, he flunked his computer class in high school because, instead of
doing his homework, he created a program that would determine launch
parameters given satellite weight and desired orbit. And, in his senior
year, while he was nearly flunking his math class (again, because he never
turned in homework), he was spending his afternoons working through the
problems in a book he purchased himself called SPACE MATHEMATICS and
received honors in a national mathematics competition.</P>

<P>During his high-school years and through the summer months of his early
college years he was employed building, and later running, the Great Falls
KOA Kampground (near the Malmstrom AFB runway) - a job quite similar to what
Artemis is intending to do with respect to its planned LunaCity Hotel.</P>

<P>Alonzo also acquired a strong interest in making the world a better place.
However, he felt he first needed to determine what "a better place"
consisted of. Over the next several years he earned an undergraduate degree
in history (with a minor in economics) and another undergraduate degree in
philosophy.</P>

<P>During the year he took off before going to graduate school, he was hired at
minimum wage for a company that built kits for "camping cabins" (small
cabins where tourists can stay - you'll mostly see them in KOA Kampgrounds).
He was soon made shop foreman and was placed in charged of
the construction and the shipment of the kits. When he announced he was
leaving to go to graduate school, Alonzo's boss offered him a deal that
most folks wouldn't have been able to refuse.   More interested in an
education than money, however, refuse he did.  Alonzo opted to go to
graduate school.</P>

<P>Just before leaving for graduate school, Alonzo married Lesley Beltz, the
kindest and most attractive person ever to grace the college campus where he
received his undergraduate degrees. </P>

<P>In graduate school, Alonzo continued to study social and political
philosophy while he taught classes in contemporary moral problems (e.g.,
abortion, euthanasia, animal rights) and philosophy of law (e.g., What is a
law? What distinguishes good laws from bad laws? Is there an obligation to
obey unjust laws?). He quit graduate school when, in the course of a few
months, his advisor died, he ran out of money, and he saw how dismal the
employment prospects were for somebody with a PhD in philosophy.</P>

<P>Still, he counts the education as valuable, counting as the most important
thing learned the fact that what "a better place" is turns out to be a lot
more difficult to figure out than most people realize. Another benefit he
took from this
education is the ability to analyze situations and issues logically, and the
ability to recognize and avoid fallacious thinking.</P>

<P>After leaving graduate school, Alonzo applied for work through a temporary
employment agency. His second assignment resulted in a permanent job. There,
Alonzo's demonstrated ability to handle multiple tasks, coordinate the
efforts of several  people (often in different offices around the world),
and produce accurate work products under very tight time constraints,
resulted in his rapid promotion to department manager.</P>

<P>His personal life secure, Alonzo resurrected his interest in space and
quickly discovered the Artemis Project.  Now, whenever he can take a break
from his management duties, and can withstand the distraction of his loving
wife,
he contributes what he can to getting people off this insignificant
little rock called Earth and out among the stars.</P>

<H1>Candace (Dicks) Bartleson's Bio</H1>
<b>computer analyst, web programmer</b>
<P><hr><P>


<h3>Role in the Artemis Project</h3>

<p>Candace is the Technical Council Administrator of the Artemis Project's
Office of Space Flight. She is also on the <a
href="http://www.asi.org/adb/09/overview.html">Electronic Communications
Technical Committee</a> as a HTML and CGI programmer.</p>


<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Candace has had seven years of experience in operations research with
responsibilities ranging from senior program analyst to detailed technical
analysis. She was the co-founder of two regional chapters of the National
Space Society and graphics editor of an NSS regional newsletter.


<h3>Work experience</h3>

<p>She helped her parents put her through college by working at the
University of West Florida's main library circulation desk. She also
assisted in entering book information into the UWF's recently purchased
library computer system. She had the "most accurate entries" record during
her employment. </p>

<p> After graduating with a B.S. in Systems Science (Scientific option), 
Candace worked at the Eglin Air Force Base as a civil service employee in 
the Armament Lab's Engineering Division and Munitions Division from 
1982 to 1989. She went to night classes from 1982 to 1987 to receive her
M.S. in Systems Analysis (Scientific option), a blend of engineering,
computer programming, and computer systems analysis.</p>

<P>In 1987 she married Richard J. Bartleson Jr. Two years later, in 
1989, Candace had to retire on disability.</p>

<p> In 1990 she moved to Central Florida to take the part-time job of
Engineering Technician at the University of Central Florida's Center for
Electro-Optics Research.</p>

<p>In 1991 she was hired as a contractor to continue her work. In 1992 she
again had to stop working. She was now on total disability. She left the
Central Florida area to return to Northwest Florida.</p>

<p>She moved to the Tampa Bay, Florida, Metropolitan Area area in mid-1995
to live in a warmer/more humid climate and became involved with the 
Artemis Project in February 1996.</p>

<h3>Personal stuff</h3>

<p>Candace was born in Alma, Michigan, on April 26, 1958, the daughter of 
a college Professor and an elementary school teacher. She was the youngest
of five children. While Candace was still an infant, she was discovered to
have heart defects and the family moved to Florida for a warmer climate.</p>

<p>She was in the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, being evaluated 
when NASA was formed in late 1958. All during her childhood she was 
encouraged to use her mental capabilities to learn about the world around
her and space became the focus of most of her attention.</p>

<p>Her personal interests and hobbies include: space development; computer
programming;  Florida wildlife photography; artificial intelligence; 
writing for fun (rarely done); most kinds of music; and of course, webbing
and surfing the 'net.</p>

<p>Candace now lives in the Tampa Bay, Florida, Metropolitan area.</p>

<PRE>MITSUBISHI CORPORATION SETS SIGHTS ON THE MOON WITH CONTRACT TO LUNACORP

Source: PR Newswire

ARLINGTON, Va., March 26 /PRNewswire/ via Individual Inc. -- Mitsubishi
Corp. has become the first company to issue a contract to LunaCorp for
its ambitious plan to mount a commercial mission to the moon in 1999,
the two companies announced today.

A key part of the contract is a week-long tour of potential Japanese
customers starting April 22, arranged by Mitsubishi Corp.'s Tokyo
office. Mitsubishi said the contract was "substantial" but did not
disclose the amount.

LunaCorp's Lunar Rover Expedition will send intelligent <a
href="/adb/04/02/05/04/01/">robotic vehicles</a>
to the moon on behalf of a theme park, corporate sponsors, television
networks and science researchers. The rovers are being designed by the
Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University and will be delivered
to the moon by a commercial launch service.

"Sponsoring companies will be able to give their customers the ability
to drive on the moon, by remote control, and experience lunar
exploration first-hand," said LunaCorp President David Gump. "Citizen
explorers will see high-definition live video displayed on motion
platforms that reproduce the rovers' motion as they dip into craters
on the Sea of Tranquillity."

By sharing the $200 million cost of the Expedition with commercial
customers, science researchers will get access to the moon at a
fraction of the price of a government mission. Researchers may develop
ways to exploit the moon's energy resources (such as solar energy farms
and the mining of <a href="/adb/02/09/he3-intro.html">helium-3</a> isotopes
for clean nuclear fusion) and its
potential for revolutionary lunar observatories. Astronomers estimate
that a set of lunar telescopes linked electronically would have 10,000
times the resolving power of the Earth-orbiting Hubble Space Telescope,
and would be able to see continents on planets around other stars.

"Mitsubishi Corp. is excited about the commercial and scientific
potential of privately organized lunar development," said Ron S. Horii,
manager of space and electronic development for Mitsubishi International's
Los Angeles office. "Mitsubishi was an early investor in another small
U.S. space company, SpaceHab Inc., and we hope our success with SpaceHab
will be repeated with LunaCorp."

SpaceHab created a privately owned extension to NASA's <a
href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/">Space Shuttle</a>
main cabin, allowing more experiments to be orbited on flights carrying
the <a href="/adb/04/03/06/01/">SpaceHab module</a>.

<a href="/adb/10/17/">Carnegie Mellon</a>'s Robotics Institute receives
$1.5 million annually
from NASA to develop lunar rover technologies such as autonomous
navigation -- the ability of mobile robots to select their own path to
a goal and avoid obstacles along the way. Dr. William "Red" Whittaker,
chief scientist for the institute, developed the Dante II volcano-walking
robot that used autonomous navigation to descend into Alaska's Mt. Spurr
in 1994.

LunaCorp, which also publishes CD-ROM titles on space exploration, has
an Internet Web site at www.lunacorp.com.

Mitsubishi Corp. had a trading profit of approximately $6.3 billion on
transactions of $200 billion in FY 1995.

They estimate betweenUS $600,000 and $800,000 per station, which can receive up to 1.2 millionbits per second through a 10-foot antenna dish.  The key to cost control isusing a commercially available weather satellite-tracking terminal as thebasis for the ground station.</P><P>     This is yet another example of how our government's on-going researchbenefits private space ventures.  Every time NASA or RSA or NASDA or ESA orCSA solves one of these problems, they solve it for everybody.  Even if thedetails are kept a state secret, we eliminate most of the development costjust by knowing it can be done and having a concept for the approach thatworks.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>What this means to the Artemis Project</H3><P>     The Artemis Project will need at least four such facilities spaced outaround the Earth.  More is better, for redundancy.</P><P>     We can be somewhat optimistic about cost estimates, assuming thetechnology will continue to develop, and we'll enjoy some more cost savedfrom avoiding the government overhead.  Using the $600,000 figure, we'dbudget $2.4 million for the ground communication stations and about$800,000 for the central facility; or $3.2 million total.</P><P>     The concept for ground support facilities is much more elaborate thana simple control room and communications center.  It's more of aself-supporting theme park and museum.  (The whole idea is that "You canplay, too!")  However, since these facilities are designed to be arevenue-producing attraction, only the cost of their basic functions arecharged against the reference mission budget.</P><P>     The 95/08/20 revision to the Reference Mission Balance Sheet (that's thelatest; totals to US $1.421 billion) allocates US $3,250,000 for the groundsupport facilities function.  So (thanks to a little bit of knowledge and alot of pure dumb luck) our early estimate aligns well with the hard costdata from <a href="jpl-ground-comm-stations.html">NASA's newdevelopment</a>.</P><P>     FYI, the total budget for Operations Planning & Integration, where theground support function fits, is just under US $25 million.  That includesflight planning, crew activities planning, crew training, mission support,and flight operations facilities.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sat, March 9, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.Bennett</a> <a href="mailto:grb@asi.org">&lt;grb@asi.org&gt;</a>, maintained by <a href="mailto:simon@eagle.ca">Simon Rowland</a>.<br><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">The Artemis Project</a>is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar Resources Company</a>.</font></body></html>

<H1>E.C. "Stan" Field</H1>
<B>computer guru, technical writer, teacher</B><HR>

<H3>Role in the Artemis Project:</H3>

<P><a href="mailto:stnfield@gate.net">Stan Field</a> is currently a member
of the <a href="/adb/06/08/07/">SSTO Concept Design Project Team</a>. In
that function, he does research over the internet and provides technical
insights into SSTO design.</P>


<h3>Background</h3>

<P>Stan Field was born in Martin County, Florida. Stan has lived in
Florida, New Jersey, Indiana and Mexico City, to name a few of his prior
residences. As a teen he participated with the US Navy Team during the
Southeast Asia War Games, 1969-71, second-place winner.</P>

<P>Science fiction has been a lifelong passion for Stan. He and his wife
are active members of the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA). Stan's
extensive knowledge of science and technology is almost entirely
self-taught. Stan has always worked and socializied with engineers, artists
and writers.</P>


<h3>Profesional Experience</h3>

<P>From the late '70s to fairly recently, Stan worked with micro-computers
as programmer, instructor, technical writer and retail sales & support.
His position for the last two years includes technical support, beta
testing, technical writing, lecturing and training for Command Software
Systems, Inc. Command Software Systems produces F-PROT Professional
anti-virus software as well as various security products.</P>

<P>Although he has never been patient enough to acquire a degree, he has
attended and taught many college-level classes on computers, electronics
and writing. For Stan, the "Portrait of J. Random Hacker" in the jargon file
(also known as the New Hacker's Dictionary) hits quite close to home.</P>

<h2 align="center">Artemis Data Book</H2>
<h2 align="center">6.7.5.3.1 Software Architecture and Standards</H2>
<h2 align="center">Near-Term Functions of the Software Architecture and
Standards TC</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Gregory R. Bennett</I></P>
<P><HR><P>


<P>In regards to the charter for the Software Standards and
Architecture Committee, we're talking mostly about flight software and the
software we'll use in real-time support from the ground.</P>

<P>Right now, architecture is more urgent than standards. The big question
we need to answer is: How much will it cost us to get this spaceship to
the moon? To do that, we need to estimate some numbers:</P>

<ul type=circle>
<lI>How much software we need to fly and operate this thing
<Li>How the software is organized
<lI>What we can get off the shelf
<lI>What we'll have create and verify ourselves</ul>

<P>At NASA, the software engineers use Source Lines of Code as their
measure for estimating the software load, called "slocs". A sloc is an
executable statement or a declaration, etc. It doesn't include comments or
other non-functional lines.</P>

<P>A good way to start is by making a catalog of all the software 
functions and breaking it down into software modules. That will probably
involve some brainstorming, a lot of asking questions of folks in the
other technical committees, and touring around the stuff that NASA has
produced to figure out how they control their spacecraft.</P>

<P>It'll turn out something like...</P>

<ul>
<lI>Flight Software
<ul>
<lI>Spacecraft Command and Control
<ul>
<lI>Command Filtering and Security
<lI>Crew Displays
<lI>Control Executive and Event Scheduling
</ul>
<li>Communications
<li>Navigation
<ul>
<li>Sensor Data Handling
<li>Nav State Determination
<lI>Ephemeris Model
<LI>Earth Model
<lI>Moon Model
<lI>Space Traffic Model
</ul>
<lI>Systems Monitoring and Control
<ul>
<lI>Electrical Power System
<lI>Environmental Control System
<ul>
<lI>Atmosphere System
<lI>Crew Potable Water System
<lI>Waste Control System
</ul>
<lI>Lighting System
<lI>Propulsion System
<lI>Thermal Control System
<lI>Video System
<lI>Audio System
<lI>etc. etc. etc.
</ul></ul>
<lI>Ground Control
<ul>
<lI>Systems Monitoring<br>
(systems, system, systems)
<lI>Ground Support Displays
<lI>Ground Control Communication
<lI>Public Displays
<lI>Ground Crew Life Support (that is, the coffee pot)
<lI>Public Affairs Office Console Functions
<lI>Inter-site Communcation (for a distributed ground support function)
</ul></ul>

<P>The section numbers should be made to mirror the <a
href="/adb/outline.html">Artemis Data Book outline</a> as much as
possible.</P>

<P>Once the Software Architecture and Standards Tech Committee has a handle
on what software will be required, it can start guessing how much custom
software will have to be written, and what can be acquired off the shelf.
For the off-the-shelf software, an estimate of what it will cost to acquire
the software needed would be prepared.</P>

<P>With that in hand, we'll have a good estimate of just how big this job
will be. Then the software engineers who've done real flight software can
prepare an estimate of how many man-hours it takes to create a sloc, and
turn man-hours into money. We spread out the hours, and voila! We have a
cashflow estimate.</P>

<H1>Adam London</H1>
<B>SSTO engineer, rocket designer, team manager</B><HR>


<h3>Role in the Artemis Project:</h3>

<P><a href="mailto:aplondon@mit.edu">Adam London</a> is involved in various
technical aspects of the <a href="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a>. He is
the Team Leader for the SSTO Concept Design Project Team, where he manages
a group of engineers.</P>

<P>In technical work for the Artemis Project, he mostly works on the
propulsion and structure aspects of the project.</P>

<h3>Education:</h3>

<P>Adam has a Masters in Aerospace Engineering from MIT. He previously
received a SB at MIT, and plans on working toward a PhD as he waits for a
position of
SSTO engineer to develop in the aerospace industry.</P>

<h3>Professional Experience</h3>

<P>Adam's current research is on propulsion for micro-spacecraft (under 150
kg), and his PhD will probably be done building literally the
world's smallest rocket motor. The idea is to use MEMS (micro-electrical
and mechanical systems) technology to build turbo-pumped rockets that are
about the size of credit cards, and produce about 1 lbf of thrust.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Gregory R. Bennett</I></P>
<P><HR><P>

<P>If an image is worthy of being on the <a href="/adb/09/04/01/">Artemis
Project web site</a>, it belongs in the <a 
href="/images/index.html">imagery library</a> and nowhere else. If it 
doesn't belong in the imagery library, it doesn't belong on the web site 
at all.</P>

<P>We have an imagery library so that we can:</P>

<ul type=square>
<LI>Keep track of the images we're using
<LI>Provide a stable location so that many documents can reference the same
image without worrying that the URL will change
<LI>Update an image in all documents which reference it at the same time
<LI>Find an image without wading through the whole web site</UL>

<P>Eventually we'll also have a library of standard blocks of html code,
such as the Nav Bar, which serves the same function for text as the imagery
library does for images. We don't have that set up now because we do not
have an efficient way of including blocks of html into the finished
documents. That's what the &lt;!asiinclude ...&gt; tag is all about (one
of the many <a href="/adb/09/04/02/automated-processing.html">tags unique
to the asi site</a>).

Art credits will appear inthe on-line <a href="/images/">Imagery Library data base</a>, and may alsoappear with the imagesin documents unless it interferes with the graphical appearance of the document.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Regarding the Web</H3><P>     You can see what's coming next.  We can convert the data base outputto html and keep a nice, updated list available on line.  We can alsoprogram some automatic forms in the ASI domain to handle the data, but themanual mode will do for now.</P><P>     Images will be stored on-line in files with names like"asi9500043r00.gif" where:</P><PRE>        asi = designation for Artemis Society International         96 = year the image was created (or the year the number was              requested from the library)      00043 = 5-digit serial number        r00 = revision serial number; the original is "00"       .gif = not really part of the image number, but part of the              file name.  It's the image format stored in this file.</PRE><P>     If files contain exact same image stored in different formats (.gifand .jpg, for example), they have the same image number.  However,variations on an image, adding details or splitting up a drawing, haveseparate drawing numbers.  The rev number is changed only when a newversion of an image is intended to replace the previous version.  If twoimages are supposed to be active at the same time, such as two views of theAscent Vehicle or the many different versions of Duncan's <ahref="/Gifs/artlogona.gif">half-moon logo</a>,give them different image numbers.</P><P>     When writing html code for the web site, refer to the image numberwithout the rev number, such as asi9500043.gif.  If a new revision comesup, we can replace the old one with a file link to the latest rev, andwon't have to update the html in all the different documents that use agiven image.  Use all lowercase for filenames so others can easily link toyour images; they're case-sensitive.</p><P>     We'll put all the images in a <a href="/images">/imagesdirectory</a> on the ASI domain. That wayeverybody can reference those images and know exactly what the URL for eachimage file will be.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Chartsmanship</H3><P>     When creating images for delivery through the World Wide Web, try tokeep them no larger than 485 pixels wide by 320 pixels high.  That fits theway Netscape behaves on a 640x480 computer screen.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><P><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Fri, Mar 8, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

<IMG SRC="/Gifs/artlogona.gif" align="top"><font size=-2>TM</font><BR>
<H1>James Garry</H1>
<B>space scientist, sensor engineer, programmer</B><HR>


<h3>Role in the Artemis Project:</h3>

<P><a href="mailto:jrcg1@ukc.ac.uk">James Garry</a> is involved in various
technical aspects of the <a href="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a>. He is
working on various aspects of the Reference Mission's sensor and <a
href="/adb/04/03/01/radar-requirements">radar system</a> needs. James is
also researching the surface-based sensors for the landing site.</P>

<P>James is a member of the <a href="/adb/06/07/04/02/">Simulations Technical
Committee</a>, as well as the Trajectory Planning and Mission Analysis
teams.</P>


<h3>Education:</h3>

<P>James Robert Creighton Garry was born on  March 2, 1969.
Having graduated from Manchester University (Great Britain) in 1990 with
a first in Physics, he worked for four years in the future projects department
of British Aerospace Space Systems. James was mainly involved in the mission
analysis and aerodynamics of advanced launch vehicles, including SSTO and
TSTO launch systems. In the last few years at that company, his mission
analysis and coding skills were turned towards designing and coding part of
a meteorological satellite simulator for the EUMTETSAT ground segment
in Darmstadt.</P>

<P>In 1994 James switched track to start an MSc course in space sciences at
Canterbury University in the South of England. His thesis work
concentrated on some of the scientific sensors that will be carried by the
Huygens
probe to the surface of Titan in 2004. With the completion of his degree,
James is
now employed as a calibration engineer to ensure that the sensors
built at the Unit for Space Sciences at Canterbury are fit to be
flown and are accurately characterized.


<h3>Computers and Other Skills:</h3>

<P>James programs mostly with FORTRAN 77, 90, and the VMS dialect. James has
also used OCCAM, X, Motif, and relational databases (such as DEC SQL).
He is most comfortable with VMS, Unix, IBM-PC, and the Apple Macintosh.</P>

<P>James also has a basic grasp of French and an even more
basic grasp of German. When not building things (his largest successful
project was a convertible kit-car), James relaxes by painting.  Over the last
six years he has produced and sold many pieces, including brochure
cover-work and promotional aerospace items.</P>


<h3>Courses and conferences attended:</h3>

<ul tpye=circle>
<LI>Spacecraft Engineering course; Southampton University (1991)
<LI>OCCAM parallel processing language course; Stevenage (1992)

<H1>Vik Olliver</H1>
<B>computer guru, team leader, writer</B><HR>


<h3>Role in the Artemis Project</h3>

<P><a href="mailto:vik@econz.co.nz">Vik Olliver</a> is a member of several
Technical Committees. He does very detailed 3-D <a
href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/vik/artart.html">computer
renderings</a> of Artemis Project hardware, and is a member of the 3-D
Modeling Technical Committee. Vik is also part of the Guidence, Navigation,
Control and Comm Technical Committee, and the <a
href="/adb/06/07/04/02/">Simulations Technical Committee</a>.</P>

<P>In addition, Vik is a member of the <a
href="/adb/09/overview.html">Electronic Communications Technical Committee</a>,
and shares his computer insights on the <a
href="/adb/09/03/mailing-lists.html">asi-ecomm mailing list</a>. Vik is
also an active member of the main <a
href="/adb/09/03/artemis-list.html">artemis-list</a> and the <a
href="/adb/06/08/07/">SSTO Concept Design PT</a> <a
href="/adb/09/03/mailing-lists.html">mail-list</a>.

<P>Vik is organizing a New Zealand Artemis Society chapter and is the
Aukland local contact.</P>

<h3>Professional experience</h3>

<P>Vik currently is employed by ECONZ in New Zealand, working with computerized
despatch systems. He programs anything from Newtons to 100-user QNX
systems.</P>

<P>For the last 7 years, Vik has worked at Alfa Systems Ltd., purveyors of
the Diskfax. Vik also publishes articles in various computer magazines.
Some other previous jobs include being a journalist and locksmith.</P>


<h3>Personal</h3>

<P>Viktor Austin Olliver was born on March 8, 1964, to Peter Austin Olliver
and Helga Margarite Olliver. Born in Winchester, he left the UK and went to
the other side of the world to set up a family in New Zealand. He lives
with his wife Suz, his daughters Kate (8) and Tammy (6), two cats, and a
dog.</P>

<P>Vik considers himself "half English, half Austrian, and half mad." He
has been shot at, blown up, nearly drowned, set on fire, run over, lost
count of broken bones, crashed on a bike, been in a  car crash, train
crash, in a plane that was hit by lightning; has been poisoned, stabbed,
dropped off a cliff, survived internal hemorrhaging, and been joined to CIX,
but not simultaneously. He is also the teensiest bit paranoid.</P>

<P>He can change a nappy, plan an invasion, butcher animals, steer a ship,
design a building, write poetry, solve equations, lay bricks, set bones,
comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, analyze
problems, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight
efficiently, blow stuff up, die gallantly, and believes that specialization
is for insects.</P>

<P>In his little remaining free time, he plays with the family, works on
the Artemis Project,
writes for PC Magazine, and shoots inanimate fun targets. If he had more
time he would go back into serious .22 target shooting.</P>

<P>This is not weird compared with his Mum, who has a reconstructed left
arm (original crushed in an Australian dockyard), fell in love with an
Australian bank robber, lived in a remote part of Laos, and goes boar
hunting with knives for kicks.</P>

He makesa significant contribution to the <a href="/artemis.html">ArtemisProject</a> in pricing equipment and analysing the logistical element ofvarious aspects of the Artemis Project. He occasionally uses the example ofordering port-o-potties for the launch site as a mundane but importanttypical task for the Logistics Tech Committee.</P><P>Bob is organizing a <a href="/adb/07/local-chapters.html#UnitedStates">Mid-Atlantic Artemis Society</a> chapter, and is the Baltimorelocal contact.</P><h3>Professional experience</h3><P>Bob Reuter owns Access Systems, a transportation/rehabilitationconsulting engineering firm. Some typical major projects include purchasingbuses for transit systems and designing accessible transit systems. Otherprojects include the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project and engineeringdrive systems for light rail vehicles.</P><P>Bob also works on the Americans with Disabilities Act - Rail technicalregulations. He was the director of a regional transportation planningcouncil, and director of a transit system.</p><P>He sits on the local MPO transportation long range planning committeeand is Vice President of Delaware/Maryland Paralyzed Veterans ofAmerica.</P><h3>Personal</h3><P>Born in 1948, Bob has a BA in Transportation Engineering from theUniversity of Maryland (UMBC), with a minor in Economics. He speaksEnglish, German, Japanese, and Sign Language.</P><P>To relax, Bob enjoys reading science fiction, but finds the story can beruined if the math isn't right or the physics doesn't hold up. He alsobuilds model railroads, and has a 14x56 ft layout that has seen little worksince he started working on the Artemis Project. Other pursuits includecanoeing and working as a ski instructor. A recent highlight was carryingthe Olympic Torch as it passed through Baltimore on the way to Atlanta.</P><P>Bob is a widower and a Vietnam era veteran with 4 children and 6grandchildren.

Simon has written many articlesfor the ADB, as well as edited and HTML-translated myriad others.</P><P>Simon also chairs the Support for Planatery Missions technicalcommittee, which is currently working on a section of the economic modelfor lunar development. In addition to that, he is the <ahref="/asi_index.html">Artemis Society</a> local contact for the Torontoarea, and is working to set up a ASI-Toronto <ahref="/adb/07/local-chapters.html">local chapter</a>.</P><P>Finally, he does miscellaneous work for a variety of other <ahref="/adb/06/07/tc-listing.html">technical committees</a> which usuallyentails writing technical papers, doing routine calculations (usuallyrocket science-related), doing administrative stuff, extorting otherArtemis Society members to get cracking doing papers, and doing HTMLauthoring, as a representive sample of the diverse tasks he finds himselfdoing at all hours of the night.</P><h3>Personal Stuff</h3><P>Simon has a set of interests too broad to fit under a singlegeneralization: pure and applied science, civilizations in history,political and economic science and theory, space development, computers,the Moon, theology and philosophy, and evolutionary biology.</P><P>When he's done with school-related things, he spends much of his freetime working on the Artemis Project. However, Simon still manages to findtime to read (lots), mostly non-fiction and science-fiction, cycling aroundthe (unfortunately hilly) area in which he lives, and doing stuff with hisbuddies.</P><P>Before he started spending all his time on the <ahref="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a>, Simon was known as quite aproficient DOOM player, although his talents have now fallen intodisrepair. He plays the baritone (a brass instrument), is a great dancer, andwhen he does listen to music (not often), it's usually classical orheavy metal, depending on mood. </P><P>His primary pet social causes include Athiesm, Socialism, Macintoshadvocacy, supporting the Empiricist Worldview (with realisticextrapolations based firmly on empirical data, that is), and spacedevelopment as the way to save the species from extinction. He alsobelieves that SSTO-RLV really is the only way to go for real CATS, and thatprivate enterprise really is the only way to go for real spacedevelopment.</P><!-- Nav bar --><hr size = 5><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center><b><ahref="http://www.asi.org/"</a>Artemis Project</b><td align=center><b><ahref="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html"</a>ArtemisSociety</b><td align=center><b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/"</a>ArtemisData Book</b><td align=center><b><ahref="http://www.tlrc.com/Artemis_FAQ_toc.html"</a> FAQ</b><tdalign=center><b><ahref="http://www.tlrc.com/Reference_mission.html"</a>ReferenceMission</b><td align=center><b><ahref="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html"</a>Catalog</b></tr></table><hrsize=5><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society Interational.Updated Sun, July 28, 1996<br> "<A HREF="/Artemis.html">The ArtemisProject</A>" is a trademark of <A HREF="http://www.tlrc.com">The LunarResources Company</A>. </font></BODY></HTML>

In this time he has gained a broad exposure to software productionand team organization methods.</P><H3>Work Experience:</H3><P>Phil left school early, in a fit of rebellion, and took a job as aLaboratory Technician in the Acoustics and Electronics Department at whatwas then the National Institute of Oceanography. He later attendedUniversity which broadened his outlook on life considerably. At this pointhe decided that no job paid well enough to sacrifice his time and freedomto do what he was interested in, mainly playing Go, a Japanese board game.His exposure to computers at this time had been as number crunchers foranalyzing data but a friend showed him the theoretical background and fullpotential of computers. In Software Engineering he found a career that paidwell enough and provided sufficient interest to work at full time.</P><p>Phil has worked for over ten companies, mainly on a freelance basis.These include Smiths Industries, British Aerospace, RCA, Racal, STC, ICIand GEC; covering Aerospace, Marine, Military, Petrochemical and HeavyIndustrial businesses. He has worked on many types of applications, such asCommunications, Navigation, Radar, Mathematical Simulation and ProcessControl. His software experise includes Ada, C++, Fortran and variousassemblers, Jackson, Yourdon and Object Oriented Design on Sun, DEC, PC andother more antique hardware. He also has experience in team leading andconducting feasibility studies.</P><H3>Education:</H3><P>After leaving school, he soon realised his mistake - life in the realworld was too tough! He studied Applied Physics part time for four yearsbefore reading Pure Maths and Theoretical Physics at St. AndrewsUniversity, Scotland. He received his Honours Degree in 1977.</p><H3>Personal Stuff:</H3><P>Phil was born in Guildford, Surrey, England on March 12, 1953. He is nowmarried with three children.</p><P>His interests include: Go, Japanese culture, swimming, walking,cosmology & science in general, computing, ecology, politics, music of allkinds.</p><P>Most of his free time is currently directed towards family life, helpinghis local swimming club, sorting out a recent property purchase in thePyrenees and helping the Artemis Project. When he had spare time he used toread books such as 'Godel, Escher Bach' by Douglas Hoffstadter or booksabout Go.</p><P>Whilst at St. Andrews he read articles by Dr. O'Neil about thefeasibility of <a href="/adb/02/06/">building habitats in space</a>. Thehabitats could be built using the technology of the day and support manythousands of people, building solar power satellites and possibly having aprofound impact on the Earth's quality of life.

<h2 align="center">Artemis Data Book</H2>
<h2 align="center">2.1.1.1 Multiple-Vehicles Scenario</H2>
<h2 align="center">SSTO Staging Options</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Adam London</I></P>
<P><HR><P>


<P>In the orginal scenario, the mass to moon was the entire dry mass of the
vehicle plus passengers and other payload and external tanks. This may turn
out to be infeasible. I submit that it will be infeasible as long as we
attempt to bring the tanks and engines required for the Earth-to-LEO trip
along for the ride. Thus I think some kind of staging in LEO is
necessary.</P>

<P>The mission scenario I envision is as follows:</P>

<H3>Option 1: One SSTO</H3>

<P>A very large SSTO launches to LEO and rendezvouses with tank farm. Once
there, its payload (a fueled LEO-LS vehicle) separates and mates with
required O2 tanks. It TLIs and lands on Moon. Passengers disembark (or stay
on board, if it's nice enough and a <a
href="/adb/02/07/lunacity-hotel.html">Lunar Hotel</a> doesn't exist yet).
Eventually it refuels and lifts off, TEIs and then EOIs where it drops off
O2 for next mission at tank farm, and re-mates with its massive SSTO tanks
and engines and reenters and lands.</P>

<H3>Option 2: Two (or n) SSTOs:</H3>

<P>The SSTO is basically a Earth LEO workhorse. It can either launch the
LEO-LS vehicle with some fuel, or just fuel. H2 is stockpiled with the O2
at the LEO tank farm, and whenever a LEO-LS vehicle comes up, it grabs fuel
it needs and heads for the moon. When it returns to the tank farm, it drops 
of O2 tanks, and gets back into its (or a waiting) big SSTO shell and 
reenters and lands.</P>
<br>

<P>The SSTO in option one would be about 2 (or n) times as big as that in
option two. However, in option 1, you could put most to all brains,
power, etc., in the LEO-LS vehicle, so what was left in LEO was really a big
shell. It could perhaps get whatever residual power to keep itself warm,
etc., while it waited from solar arrays on the tank farm, or from within
itself. Eventually, with once-per-day operations, the big beast that
went up in the morning could bring back the LEO-LS vehicle that was
coming back that afternoon, and you could actually reduce the number of
really big SSTOs you have to build, as the turn-around time wouldn't be
the 4-5 days or round trip to the moon, but one day of round trip to LEO.
Conceivablly you would only need a fleet of a few big SSTOs, albeit with
more, smaller LEO-LS vehicles.</P>

<P>Are you designing two vehicles? Yes, which is certainly a problem
(<NOBR>= expense</NOBR>), but at least the space one comes back to Earth
each time for maintenance. I think the integration issues are easier than 
a two stage to orbit, since separation while in orbit is simpler than 
while in the atmosphere. In addition, I think this is feasible, while I 
think the one vehicle solution is not.</P>

<P>Also, you get a big LEO booster for free. You can put pretty large
things into LEO with such a beast.</P>

<P>Imagine the passenger experience:</P>

<P>You get into this cylinder thing in Australia. Lots of shaking, a bit of
extra gravity, then none. A few hours later you rendezvous with the tank
farm. You watch out the window (perhaps from a lounge on the farm) [yeah, 
I know I just threw another space station into the picture... but maybe 
it's the LEO staging base that we were talking about on art-list expanded 
somewhat, and you can look at pictures of the contruction of the original 
Artemis vehicle while your personal moon vehicle is being mated to its 
tanks.] You reboard (or maybe you never left) and move slowly away from 
the tank farm, dwarfed by the huge hulk of a ship you just came up from 
Earth on. A bit of acceleration and you're on your way to the moon. A 
couple weeks later, you're back, and again watch your little LEO-LS 
cruiser being docked to a waiting big ol' thing to transport you back to 
Earth.</P>

<P>I think that would work on the "looks neat" criteria...</P>

Bennett</I></P><P><HR><P><P>"Control" as an engineering discipline (or system in a spacecraft) isa broad term that means "make it do what you want it to do."  That includesthe actuators and electronics.  When you get into the math, you'll findthat the same equations apply whether you're calculating the internalpressures in a hydraulic actuator for an engine valve, or calculating theamount of thruster input required to return a spacecraft to its desiredtrajectory.</P><P>In the early Apollo stuff, they talked about a GNCC system, withcommunications included.  But somewhere along the way Comm got separatedout as a stand-alone system.  Sort of.  I think it's because theengineering disciplines for communication are wave theory, electromagneticpropogation, antenna design, and these days things like internal databusses and packet routing.  So you hire Electrical Engineering graduatesfor Comm, while for GN&C you want Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineeringguys.  The GN&C guys treat the communication system like a black box: theysend a message somewhere, and it magically arrives.  They request data, andthe data magically appear where they're supposed to be.  All the GN&C guysworry about is the transport lag (the time it takes the data packets to getaround), and even that number comes from the Comm guys.</P><P>You can see how that adds up.  If we hire a GN&C guy, we expect him tobe able to do guidance, navigation, and control.  If we hire a Comm guy, weexpect him to know antennas, networks, and electronics.  If one engineertried to do both, he spend all his time trying to keep up with the state ofthe art in both fields, so he'd have no time left over to do useful work.It'll really teach you to trust your co-workers.</P><P>Folks do switch among the disciplines, but they do it serially.  Dosome GN&C until that's solved, and then go over to Communication or DataProcessing, and then get up to speed in the new discipline before gettingdown to serious work.</P><P>Still, you'll usually find Comm and GN&C in the same "Avionics"department, so they are not truly inseparable disciplines.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Wed, Dec 10, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

<P><B>INTRODUCTION</B></P></CENTER>
<P>The American Thoracic Society,  founded in 1905, is an international
professional and scientific society which focuses on respiratory and critical
care medicine.  Today, the Society has approximately 12,500 members, 75% of them
from the US and 25% from around the world. The Society's members help prevent
and fight respiratory disease through research, education, patient care and
advocacy, with approximately 39% of the membership involved in either private or
institutional practice.  The Society's long range goal is to decrease morbidity
and mortality from respiratory disorders and life threatening acute illnesses. 
In keeping with these goals, the American Thoracic Society also serves as the
medical section of the American Lung Association and interacts with both
national and international organizations that have similar goals.</P>
<P>The relationship between the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the
American Lung Association (ALA) has a rich history which began in the early
1900's.   Then known as the American Sanitorium Association (ASA), the American
Thoracic Society was formed by  a group of physicians interested in the therapy
of tuberculosis.   Both the American Thoracic Society and the American Lung
Asociation were devoted to the prevention, control and treatment of
tuberculosis, with the American Thoracic Society's focus on the medical aspects
of tuberculosis, while the American Lung Association concentrated on public
health issues.</P>
<P>As the nature of biological and physical science evolved, so did the mission
of the American Thoracic Society, to include new areas in the prevention,
control and treatment of respiratory diseases.  This gradual evolution was also
accompanied by two organizational names changes: in 1938, the American
Sanitorium Association changed its name to the American Trudeau Society,
followed by its final name change in 1960 to the American Thoracic Society. 
Over the past decade, the Society has further expanded its scope of activities,
with critical care medicine as a major interest.  Furthermore, with the changing
epidemiology of infectious diseases, the American Thoracic Society once again
has as a major focus the prevention, control and treatment of such diseases as
pneumonia, tuberculosis, and HIV infection.  The American Thoracic Society  has
also expanded its programs  in the areas of research, education, patient care
and advocacy.  In the area of education, for example, the American Thoracic
Society has sponsored 2 courses in respiratory epidemiology in South America to
educate young physicians on the use of respiratory epidemiology in their work.</P>
<P>The most notable activity that the American Thoracic Society is engaged in
is the planning and production of an International Scientific Conference.  This
yearly Conference has become the premier, international forum for physicians and
scientists who work in pulmonary and critical care medicine.   Sessions in this
year's conference  were held on a broad range of topics to include pneumonia,
asthma, critical care, tuberculosis, pediatric pulmonology, sleep apnea,
environmental and occupational lung disease, nursing studies, cell biology, lung
structure and function and AIDS.</P>
<P>Today, the ALA and ATS continue to play a significant role in the fight
against lung disease and the promotion of lung health.  As medical science is
challenged by the resergence of certain infectious diseases as pneumonia,
multidrug resistant tuberculosis, hanta virus, the American Thoracic Society
continues to set the standards for prevention, treatment, and control of these
serious, potentially life threatening diseases.</P>

<H2>ATS UPDATE ON PA CATHETERS</H2></CENTER>
<P>The ATS has reviewed the recent report by Conners et al (September 18, 1996
JAMA) that attempts to address the effectiveness of right heart catheterization
(RHC) in the initial care of critically ill patients. In their report, the
authors show that patients who had RHC's inserted had an increased mortality ant
increased patient costs. These findings persisted even when adjustments for
severity of illness were made. The authors acknowledged the limitations of their
study; specifically, that this was an observational study, rather than a
randomized controlled trial (RCT) and argued that this issue merits just such a
trial. The authors suggested a number of hypothesis that could explain their
results including diametrically opposite conclusions: (I) that RHC may directly
cause worse patient outcome versus (II) RHC is actually beneficial, but that
this relationship was missed by not adequately identifying important confounding
variables. Although it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions regarding
the use of RHC based on this study design alone, the results need to be
considered seriously.</P>
<P>The accompanying editorial recommends two possible courses of action
including an immediate undertaking of an appropriately designed, multi center,
randomized controlled clinical trial for the use of PA catheterization in
critically ill patients by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute or, in
lieu of that, a moratorium on the use of flow-directed PA catheters.</P>
<P>Clearly, this matter has tremendous implications for the care of critically
ill patients. As such, the Society, through the Critical Care Assembly, has
formulated an initial response to the issues raised by the JAMA report:</P>
<OL>
<LI> We believe that because of the observational nature of the study design it
would be imprudent at present to advocate a moratorium on the use of the RHC.<BR><BR>
</LI>
<LI> Independent of the issues of study design, the study does raise important
and serious questions regarding the utility of the right heart catheter (RHC),
which must be addressed. The results certainly indicate that a randomized
controlled trial in which the control arm does not receive invasive monitoring
with a right heart catheter is necessary and ethical. Until this study can be
completed, as with all procedures and therapies, clinicians must carefully weigh
the risk/benefits of the use of RHC.<BR><BR>
</LI>
<LI> An ATS Working Group will be formed to address these issues in a
systematic fashion. The mandate of the group will be to hold discussions with
other professional societies and interested parties, to develop a coherent
action plan, and to facilitate a formal randomized prospective clinical trial to
address the important issues raised by this and other provocative papers on this
subject.

<P><B>COUNCIL OF CHAPTER REPRESENTATIVES</B><BR><BR>  The Council of Chapter
Representatives of the American Thoracic Society  provides a national forum for
Representatives from each of the ATS Chapters.   It has a leading role in
addressing issues of education, practice, research  and public policy that are
of relevance to the ATS Chapters and are not  otherwise being addressed by the
ATS through its Assemblies, Sections and  Committees.  The Council also
identifies local issues that may have national  implications and brings them to
the ATS through this forum.  The Council  also represents the interests of the
ATS Chapter members (physicians,  scientists and other health care
professionals).<BR><BR>  The Council advises the ATS Board of Directors of
concerns and ideas  originating from the various ATS Chapters.  The Council has
official  representation on all ATS Committees and the ATS Board of Directors. 
The  Council actively transmits the actions and policies of the ATS Board of 
Directors and other components of the ATS to the Chapters for local 
implementation.<BR><BR>  Areas of concern and deliberation for the Council
include, but are not  limited to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>	Facilitating the role of ATS Chapters in being the scientific advisors to
their respective Lung Associations;<BR><BR>
</LI>
<LI>	Vigorously fostering cooperation between ATS Chapters and local Lung
Associations;<BR><BR>
</LI>
<LI>	Reviewing/resolving issues dealing with the quality of practice and health
care delivery within the Chapters;<BR><BR>
</LI>
<LI>	Encouraging and promoting research at the local level;<BR><BR>
</LI>

<B>STATEMENTS BY THE AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY</B> <BR>
A Statement is a scientific document developed by a standing committee
of the ATS or by an ad hoc committee appointed by the Chairman of an Assembly.
A Statement is expected to be based on a body of reliable scientific evidence.
It must also be documented by references or data that supports the main
points of the Statement. In general, the scientific recommendations of
a Statement should not become obsolete within three to five years of publication.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>POSITION PAPERS BY THE AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY</B> <BR>
The Position Paper is an expert statement developed by a standing committee
of the ATS or an ad hoc committee appointed by the Chairman of an Assembly.
It is expected to have a scientific basis, to be authoritative and balanced,
but may deal with a wider range of questions than would be appropriate
for an ATS Statement. <BR>

<P>The American Thoracic Society has 12 Assemblies, which are essentially
Subgroups of the Society formed to address a spectrum of scientific and clinical
issues within the broad field of pulmonary medicine. The purpose of an Assembly
is to enhance communication and collaborative efforts for the Society's members
that share common interests and to enhance the collection, interpretation and
dissemination of scientific and clinical information pertaining to focused areas
in respiratory disease. Assemblies range in size from 200 to over 4,000 members.
Assemblies are considered to be the primary working groups of the society, a
name given to them because of the productive work they accomplish through their
Long Range planning Committees, Program Committees and Ad-hoc subcommittees. Not
only are they highly productive groups within the Society, Assembly members are
looked upon as experts and leaders in their respective fields. As such, all
Assemblies are represented on the ATS Board of Directors and Assembly
representatives are frequently appointed by the ATS President to serve on
Standing Committees, Ad-Hoc Committees, and Special Task Forces of the Society.

<H2><B>ADVOCACY ACTIVITIES</B></H2>
<P>ATS staff, as part of the Patient Access to Speciality Care Coalition, has
been conducting meetings with staff of House Commerce Committee members to
discuss H.R. 66, the Medicare Patient Choice and Access Act introduced by Reps.
Coburn (R-OK) and Brown (D-OH).  As you may recall, the bill would: prohibit
financial incentives that reduce care or delay referrals (HCFA has prohibited
financial incentives to reduce care for physicians.  This provision would expand
the ban to non-physician providers.), provide patients with access to in-network
specialists, provide all Medicare beneficiaries who are in managed care option
to seek out-of-network services, create a performance based &quot;report card&quot;
on plans for consumers, provide a timely appeals process and prohibits &quot;gag&quot;
rules for all health care providers.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT></B>n behalf of the American Lung Association

annual  ALA/ATS International Conference, the  largest lung related conference
in the world.  The program will be held Friday, May 16  through Wednesday, May

<P>The International Conference will offer information on the  Ilatest and most

<P>Session topics will include: managed care, tobacco control, asthma, lung
reduction  surgery, clinical and basic science of  lung development, gene
expression, tuberculosis,  environmental health, lung transplantation, critical
care medicine, sleep apnea, lung health  in diverse communities, volunteerism,
and Lung Association operations and management.   Programs in health education
and intervention as well as presentations of original  research in all
respiratory fields will also be offered.
</P>
<P>San Francisco is the site of the 1997 Conference.  The quot;City by the
Bayquot; offers  visitors culture, entertainment, excitement and fun whether you
are exploring Fisherman's  Wharf, Golden Gate Park or going outside the city to
visit Napa Valley and Sausalito.   Special tours of San Francisco and the
surrounding areas have been planned for you and  your family and there will be
many opportunities to meet with your colleagues and friends.</P>
<P>We recommend registering early to assure your admission to sessions and to
receive  your choice of hotel.  We look forward to seeing you in San Francisco.</P>

<H3>Give your children the most exciting, entertaining experience they've ever
had!</H3>

their own 
<B><A HREF="#ats1">Convention Camp, organized by ACCENT on Children's
Arrangements,  Inc.</A></B> a national company specializing in children's 
activities. Convention Camp is a complete morning to early evening entertainment
program packed with activities for  children ages six months to 12 years. 
</P>
<P>Scheduled activities are themed so that children experience the diversity of
San Francisco. Children will enjoy arts &amp; crafts projects, learn about the
history of San Francisco and much, much more. With a high ratio of caregiver  to
child (1:2 for children 6 mos - 30 mos.; 1:4 for children 30 mos - 4 years; 1:6
for children 4-6 years; 1:8 for children 6-12 years), campers receive lots of
personal  attention.</P>
<P>Space for this terrific children's entertainment package is limited, so
you'll want to register early at the special advance registration rate of $25.00
per child per day (1-10 hours). There is also a one-time registration fee  of
$30.00 per child. The program cost includes morning and afternoon snacks and
juice, entertainment and  craft materials. Arrangements for lunch will be made
at the time of registration.</P>

<BR>
<BR> <B>INTRODUCTION</B><BR>The American Journal of Respiratory and Critical
Care Medicine is one of  the official journals of the American Thoracic Society.
Articles published  in this journal consist predominantly of original research
either clinically  based or of a basic science nature. Papers that are solely or
predominantly  based in cell and molecular biology are published in the
companion journal  of the American Thoracic Society, the American Journal of
Respiratory Cell  and Molecular Biology. The Journal also seeks to publish
outstanding review  articles on areas of interest in several forms. The
State-of-the-Art review  is a treatise usually covering a broad field that
brings bench research to  the bedside. Shorter reviews are published as Clinical
Commentaries or  Pulmonary Perspectives. These are generally focused in a more
limited area  and advance a concerted opinion about care for a specific process.
Case  Reports of exceptional merit also are published in the journal.
<BR><BR> A recent trend and future direction of the journal has been to
include  debates of a topical nature on issues of importance in pulmonary and 
critical care medicine and to the membership of the society. Other recent 
changes have included encompassing works from the field of critical care 
medicine and the extension of the editorial governing of journal policy to 
colleagues outside of the United States of America. The focus and direction  of
the Journal is to establish an international forum for state-of-the-art 
respiratory and critical care medicine.
<BR> 
</P>
<P><B>HISTORY</B><BR> The first issue of the American Journal of Respiratory
and Critical Care  Medicine was published in March 1917 as the American Review
of Tuberculosis. Since then there have been several title changes.  In  1953 a
subtitle was added, &quot;A Journal of Pulmonary Diseases.&quot; In 1955 the
title became the American Review of Respiratory Diseases, and in  1965 the
American Review of Respiratory Disease. Finally in 1994 the  Journal became the
American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care  Medicine. Recent editors
included John F. Murray, MD (1973-1980), Gareth  Green, MD (1980-1985), Reuben
Cherniack, MD (1985-1989), and Robert A.  Klocke, MD (1989-1994). The current
Editor, Alan R. Leff, M.D., is  Professor of Medicine, Pediatrics,
Anaesthesiology &amp; Critical Care,  Clinical Pharmacology, and Cell Physiology
and Head of the Section of  Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at the
University of Chicago in  Illinois.
</P>
<P><B>AIMS AND SCOPE</B><BR> The AJRCCM focuses on human biology and disease
as well as animal and in  vitro studies that contribute to the understanding of
pathophysiology and  treatment of pulmonary disease.</P>

<P><B>HISTORY<BR>
</B>The first issue of the American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular
Biology was launched in July 1989. Also known as the Red Journal, AJRCMB
was developed to address the shift in modern pulmonary science to lung
cell and molecular biology. The founding editors were Jerome S. Brody,
M.D., Robert M. Senior, M.D., and Mary C. Williams, Ph.D. The current Editor,
John A. McDonald, Ph.D., M.D., is Director of Research at Mayo Clinic,
Scottsdale, Arizona.</P>

</B>The AJRCMB publishes papers that report significant and original observations
in the area of pulmonary biology. The focus of the Journal includes, but
is not confined to, cellular, biochemical, molecular, developmental, genetic,
and immunologic studies of lung cells and molecules.</P>

<P><B>SCIENCE CITATION INDEX RATING<BR>
</B>AJRCMB ranks 2nd in terms of frequency of citation among 20 journals
listed under Respiratory System in Science Citation Index. It also ranks
in the top third of 151 journals listed under Biochemistry / Molecular
Biology.</P>

<H2><B>Operating Rules:</B></H2>
<P><B>Adopted on May 12, 1996</B></P>
<P>I.  The goal of the Behavioral Science Assembly of the American Thoracic
Society (ATS) is to facilitate and promote the role of the behavioral and social
sciences in lung health. The following specific objectives address this goal.</P>
<OL>
<LI>  To facilitate interest and knowledge among ATS members concerning
behavioral and social factors in lung health and disease.
</LI>
<LI> To communicate information on behavioral and social factors in lung health
and disease to ATS members and the ALA community, and the lung health, policy
making, and research communities.
</LI>
<LI> To facilitate and advocate support for research on behavioral and social
factors in lung health and disease.
</LI>
<LI> To promote state-of-the-art behavioral techniques for lung disease.
</LI>
<LI>  To address, through research and advocacy, social inequalities in the
care of those with lung disease.
</LI>
<LI>  To advocate for behavioral and social approaches to lung health.
</LI></OL>
<P>II.  The Assembly is concerned with the broad scope of lung diseases and
associated behavioral and social determinants, outcomes and co-variate.</P>
<P>III. The Assembly seeks to encourage rigorous approaches to research among
behavioral and social scientists and among researchers from other disciplines
who study behavioral aspects of lung disease.</P>
<P>IV. The objectives, scope, and methodologies identified with the Assembly
lend themselves to many specific research topics. The following topics are of
particular interest to members of the Assembly.</P>
<OL>
<LI> Trends in behavioral epidemiology associated with lung disease (e.g.,
smoking,   treatment adherence).
</LI>
<LI> Behavioral outcomes associated with lung disease (e.g., quality of life).
</LI>
<LI>  The impact of lung health and behavioral and social science findings on
health policy formation (e.g., smoking , provision of health care).
</LI>

<P>The ATS Board of Directors met November 7 and 8, 1996 in Parsippany, NJ, and
approved a new set of procedural guidelines to standardize the process by which
the Society enters collaborative efforts with other professional societies. 
Over the past five years, the ATS has a growing number of requests to sponsor or
endorse scientific or educational endeavors (meetings, workshops, guidelines) of
other professional societies. Traditionally, these requests were handled on a
case-by-case basis. However, as the numbers of such requests has grown, it
became necessary for the Society to standardize the process in order to handle
these requests in a fair manner. The guidelines, as approved by the ATS Board of
Directors (11/96), are as follows:
</P>
<P><B>Suggested Levels of Participation in Collaborative Efforts with the 
American Thoracic Society
</B></P>
<P>For Projects Initiated by Organizations Other than the ATS
</P>
<P>The American Thoracic Society will review requests for participation in
collaborative efforts with outside organizations according to the following
guidelines:
</P>
<P><B>1. Co-Sponsorship</B>
</P>
<P><B>A. Definition: </B>Co-sponsorship requires full participation by the
American Thoracic Society (ATS) in the planning, organization, and
implementation of  the project. As a co-sponsor, the ATS should have the
opportunity to:
</P>
<P><B>1)</B>	Organize and participate on a joint planning committee (if
applicable) and participate in selecting the committee chairperson.
</P>
<P><B>2)</B>	The Planning Committee is responsible for planning the project,
naming the participants, and determining the goals, objectives, timetable, and
resource allocation.
</P>
<P><B>3)</B>	Participate in all meetings, workshops, and seminars that are
related to the project.
</P>
<P><B>4)</B>	Review and comment on any draft documents that are produced as a
result of the project.
</P>
<P><B>5)</B>	Jointly publish official educational/scientific proceedings of
the project (Official Statements, Position Papers, Clinical Guidelines, Workshop
Reports, etc.) in their scientific journals.
</P>
<P><B>6)</B> Be identified as a sponsoring organization of the project in all
documents.
</P>
<P><B>7)</B>	In special circumstances, standing co-sponsorship agreements may
be established between the ATS and other professional /scientific societies.
</P>
<P><B>B. Process:</B>
</P>
<P><B>1)</B>	Decisions about co-sponsorship must take place when the project
is in its early stages and before it has been fully planned.
</P>
<P><B>2)</B>	Informal inquiries and recommendations regarding an
organization's interest in collaborating with ATS on a particular project should
be made by the individual project chairpersons or the appropriate officer of the
organization. If collaboration is both desirable and feasible, then an official
agreement outlining the nature of the joint relationship will be made by the
leadership of the organizations.
</P>
<P><B>3)</B>	All requests for co-sponsorship will be referred to the
appropriate Assembly or Committee.
</P>
<P><B>4)</B>	The Assembly or Committee will appoint an ATS representative who
will work with the organization to develop an official proposal to be presented
to the Assembly or Committee for review.
</P>
<P><B>5)</B>	The ATS representative will be responsible for completing a
formal proposal (including budgets) for review by the Assembly or Committee.
</P>
<P><B>6)</B>	The Assembly or Committee will forward the proposal to the ATS
Program and Budget Committee for final approval. (The Program and Budget
Committee will set up a process to handle requests throughout the year).
</P>
<P><B>7)</B>	Decisions concerning project financing, organization of meetings,
and publication of results must be made by the co-sponsoring organizations.
</P>
<P><B>8)</B>	ATS members involved in projects of other organizations do not
represent the ATS unless a formal agreement between that organization and the
ATS has been established. Therefore, ATS members involved in projects of other
organizations (or members with an awareness of projects that could be
co-sponsored by the ATS) should present a proposal to the appropriate Assembly
or Committee for review.
</P>
<P><B>9)</B>	If a project is one that involves CME credit, it must follow the
guidelines of the ACCME.
</P>
<P><B>10)</B>	Projects may require approval by the ATS Board of Directors in
special circumstances.
</P>
<P><B>2. Endorsement</B>
</P>
<P><B>A. Background/Definition:</B> The ATS receives many requests to endorse
conferences, recommendations, or guidelines that have been developed by
professional medical/scientific societies with no official prior input from the
ATS. Endorsement implies that the ATS name and logo will be used to promote the
activities of these organizations and to enhance the scientific credibility of
the sponsoring organization. Therefore, the ATS has developed criteria to guide
decisions about ATS endorsement of activities of other organizations:
</P>
<P><B>B. Criteria for Obtaining  ATS Endorsement:</B>
</P>
<P><B>1)</B>	The requesting organization must have a proven reputation in the
scientific/medical community.
</P>
<P><B>2)</B>	The activities (conferences, recommendations, guidelines) to be
endorsed must conform to the standards established for similar ATS activities.
</P>
<P><B>3)</B>	There must be a recognized benefit to the ATS.
</P>
<P><B>4)</B>	Activities must not be in conflict or duplicate ATS activities.
</P>
<P><B>5)</B>	Involvement of ATS members in the planning, development, and
implementation of the activity is desirable.
</P>
<P><B>C. Process for Organizations Requesting ATS Endorsement</B>
</P>
<P><B>1)</B>	Requests should be sent to the ATS Office (Executive Director or
ATS President) in New York for consideration.
</P>
<P><B>2)</B>	Requests will be forwarded to the appropriate body within the ATS
for review, comment, and recommendation.
</P>
<P><B>D. Other Considerations Regarding ATS Endorsement</B></P>
<P><B>1)</B>	Prior approval by the ATS must be obtained for the use of its
name and logo on any activities.
</P>
<P><B>2)</B>	The ATS should have access to all activities that it has
endorsed.

<P><B>Statement on Pretreatment Evaluation of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</B>
</P>
<P>Lung cancer is the most common cause of death from malignancy in the US, UK,
and a number of other countries.  In 1997, over 170,000 individuals in the US
alone will be diagnosed with lung cancer.  The five year survival rate is
currently 13%.  This statement reviews screening studies, symptoms and signs,
pathologic diagnosis, search for metastases, assessment of lung function,
preoperative evaluation, and management options. It also includes guidelines for
staging patients with NSCLC.   Although state-of-the-art knowledge about
treatment has been derived predominantly from clinical trials, knowledge is
limited, and therapies are sometimes marginally effective, only 1-2% of all lung
cancer patients are enrolled on clinical trials.  The ATS encourages primary
care and subspecialty physicians to participate/support the enrollment of their
lung cancer patients onto prospective clinical trials.
</P>
<P><B>Statement on the Role of the  Pulmonary Specialist in Pediatrics</B>
</P>
<P>The pediatric pulmonary physician (PPP) represents a unique regional
subspecialty resource for health care providers and for children with breathing
disorders and their families.  There are currently fewer than 600
board-certified PPPs in the US distributed predominantly in large urban
population centers.  Pediatric pulmonary physicians serve in multiple
capacities, providing clinical services, teaching health care  professionals and
trainees, conducting research, and providing medical direction for pediatric
pulmonary function, exercise, and sleep laboratories, and pediatric departments
of respiratory care.  This statement describes the training of PPPs and their
roles in the American health care system.  It emphasizes the relationships with
health care professionals, community agencies, hospitals, and with children and
their families.
</P>
<P><B>Workshop Report on Rapid Diagnostic Tests for Tuberculosis: <BR>What Is
the Appropriate Use?</B>
</P>
<P>In February 1996, a workshop was held as a program of the ATS Assembly on
Microbiology, Tuberculosis, and Pulmonary Infection.  The purpose was to review
the status of nucleic acid amplification tests for the rapid diagnosis of
tuberculosis , the clinical trials carried out to evaluate them, the role of the
FDA in the process, economic considerations of the tests, and the development of
guidelines for health practitioners and public health officials to use in
considering the application of these tests for diagnosis and management of
patients suspected of having TB.  Direct amplification tests (DATs) were
discussed in detail and the consensus was that a better understanding of how to
use these tests in conjunction with available clinical information is essential.
 Their judicious use can expedite TB control activities in certain
circumstances.  They can be expected to evolve and become more useful in the
future.
</P>
<P><B>Position Statement on Health Care Policy in the US</B>
</P>
<P>It is the position of the ALA  and ATS that the health care system in the US
must meet the multiple needs of people with respiratory system disorders and
critical illness and assure access, quality, and cost effectiveness.  They
further believe that health care consumers and providers must have an effective
voice in development of health care systems to fully meet the needs of patients,
including those of the underinsured and uninsured.  The development of clinical
practice guidelines by knowledgeable health care professional experts,
appropriate use of high-cost technology, and innovative health care practice
design may be used to reduce the escalating cost of health care.  The ALA and
ATS support carefully designed outcomes studies to validate the
cost-effectiveness of these tools.

<P><B>NIH &amp; CDC Receive Increase In  HHS FY98 Budget Request</B>
</P>
<P>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which is home to NIH and
CDC, recently submitted its FY98 budget request to the Administration.  The HHS
budget request included a 2.3% NIH and 8.8% CDC increase over the
Administration's FY97 budget request (rather than  final FY97 funding levels
which were higher than the Administration's recommendation).  Although the
proposed funding increases for FY98 do not keep pace with actual increases in
FY97, they do signal that HHS views NIH and CDC as priority programs that should
receive increases.  Funding levels for specific divisions/institutes were not
provided.  A need for increased funding for the CDC Infectious Disease program
was highlighted in the budget request.   Please remember that the budget request
reflects what HHS would like to spend for FY98.  The Administration is free to
accept, reject or modify the HHS budget recommendations.
</P>
<P><B>HHS Contemplates Block Grants For TB/STD Programs</B>
</P>
<P>Also contained in the HHS budget request was combined funding for a &quot;Performance
Partnership&quot; program that would combine TB and STD funds in a block grant
to states.  Although this does not officially mean that the Administration will
revisit the block grant proposal, it is a strong signal that HHS will push the
TB/STD block grant approach in the 105th Congress.  ATS Washington Office staff
will continue to monitor this issue.
</P>
<P><B>Administration/Congress Expected to Reach Medicare Agreement</B>
</P>
<P>Based on public statements made by the Administration and Congressional
leaders, it appears that  an agreement to fix the short-term Medicare Trust Fund
solvency issue will be resolved early in the 105th Congress.  Unlike last year's
Medicare debate, the anticipated agreement will be narrowly tailored to
resolving the solvency crisis facing the trust and will not tackle long-term
structural changes in the Medicare program.  It is also anticipated that the
agreement will include convening of a bi-partisan panel that will be charged
with making recommendations to address the long-term needs of the Medicare
program.  What is unclear at this point is how broad the panel's mission will be
and if  its recommendations will merely be reported or whether they will be
policy recommendations that Congress will be required to act on.

<P>A 116-page report addressing nearly every aspect of existing practices that
protect coal miners from black lung and silicosis was issued by the US
Department of Labor in November. Black lung is a common term for coal worker's
pneumoconiosis caused by excessive exposure to coal mine dust. Silicosis is
related to the excessive quartz dust exposure. According to a 1994 report by the
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, black lung was noted as
cause of death on more than 55,000 death certificates between 1968 and 1990. The
Advisory Committee on the Elimination of Pneumoconiosis Among Coal Mine Workers
recommended that the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) be responsible
for all coal mine dust sampling conducted to determine compliance with exposure
standards. Currently, MSHA collects only 25% of dust samples, with the remaining
percentage gathered by mine operators. As an interim measure, it was recommended
that MSHA's presence be increased at mines with a history of noncompliance with
dust standards. The report of the Advisory Committee on the Elimination of
Pneumoconiosis Among Coal Mine Workers is available on the World Wide Web at
MSHA's home page: http://www.msha.gov.  Single copies may be requested from
MSHA, Coal Mine Safety and Health, Division of Health, 4015 Wilson Blvd.,
Arlington, VA 22203; telephone: 703/235-1358.

<B><A NAME="ats1">More</A> Critically Ill Patients Accept Withholding Life
Support</B>
<BR><BR></P>
<P>As a result of this study, these investigators believe that the decision to
limit life-sustaining treatment for terminally ill patients is the de facto
standard of practice at intensive care units (ICUs).  Writing in the January
issue of the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Thomas
J. Prendergast, M.D., formerly associated with the Department of Medicine,
University of California, San Francisco, and San Francisco General Hospital,
together with a co-author, presented data showing that 90% of the patients who
died over a one year period in two hospital ICUs did so following a decision to
limit therapy, and that this represented a major change in practice at these
institutions, based on research done five years previously.  During the one-year
study period (October 1, 1992, to September 30, 1993), 1,711 individuals were
admitted to the ICUs at Moffitt-Long Hospital (MLH) and San Francisco General
Hospital (SFGH). In approximately 10% of these cases (179), a recommendation was
made to limit life-sustaining treatment.  These recommendations led to
withholding or withdrawing support for 177 of the patients.  Over the one-year
period, 200 patients died, including the 179 who had been recommended for
withholding life support.  The most common interventions to be withheld or
withdrawn included vasopressor agents, which cause vasoconstriction and an
increase in blood pressure, and mechanical ventilation.  In 49 cases (27%), the
patient or a relative initiated the discussion about limiting therapy.  Eight
patients presented legally executed advance directives.  Three patients were
admitted to the ICU with a current order &quot;not to resuscitate.&quot;  The
investigators wrote: &quot;The results of this study challenge the belief that
patients or their surrogates frequently refuse physician recommendations to
limit life- sustaining treatment.  Ninety percent of families in the study
accepted such recommendations within 5 days, and only 5% of families rejected a
physician recommendation to limit life support.&quot;</P>

<B><A NAME="ats2">Sleep-disordered</A> Breathing Higher in African-Americans
Than Caucasians</B>
<BR><BR></P>
<P>Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a recurring problem associated with
complete or partial obstruction of the upper airway during sleep.  For those who
suffer from the syndrome, it can cause frequent sleep arousal, sleep
fragmentation, deficient oxygenation in the blood, and an increase in carbon
dioxide.  Writing in the January issue of the American Journal of Respiratory
and Critical Care Medicine, Susan S. Redline, M.D., Cleveland Veterans Affairs
Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, along with 5 associates, presents a report on
SDB and its risk factors after studying 225 African Americans and 622
Caucasians, ages 2 to 86.  The group was recruited either from families with at
least one person with known sleep apnea, or from neighborhood control families
without a history of SDB.  The subjects were involved in overnight home
sleep-study, in answering questionnaires, and in receiving physical
measurements.  The investigators observed substantial increases in SDB
prevalence with increasing age, reaching 39% in Caucasians and 44% in
African-American participants over age 55.  Under age 25, SDB was also seen more
frequently.  According to the investigators:  &quot;SDB was observed to be
approximately twice as prevalent in African Americans than in Caucasians,
regardless of recruitment source.&quot;</P>

<B><A NAME="ats3">Cytomegalovirus</A> Activates the Tumor Necrosis Factor Gene</B>
<BR><BR></P>
<P>Cytomegalovirus (CMV), one of the herpes viruses, normally produces disease
only in persons with impaired or immature immune systems.  In lung disease,
pneumonia is associated with CMV infection, and the virus has been implicated in
graft rejection after lung transplantation.  In all cases, CMV is associated
with an inflammatory process in the lung.  Also, many chronic lung diseases are
connected with increased local secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF). 
Previous research has demonstrated that CMV infection increases TNF production. 
Writing in the January issue of the American Journal of Respiratory Cell and
Molecular Biology, Lois J. Geist, M.D., and associates from the Department of
Medicine, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, produce the first
report of an interaction between the viral protein and a local region in the
human TNF-alpha promoter.  According to the authors, after CMV infection, TNF
production appears to be a function of the differentiation state of the cell. 
This process occurs, in part, via effects on cellular transcription factors. 
They state:  &quot;These studies lend important insights into the mechanisms
whereby viral gene products can modulate cytokine gene activation without
directly binding to DNA.&quot;</P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ats1"></A>INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>To assist members of the Assemblies in achieving their goals, the ATS has
developed a mechanism to provide financial and administrative support for a
limited number of <A HREF="assmb_pr.html">Assembly Projects</A>. Any member of
an Assembly can apply for Assembly Project Funding, using one of the hyperlinked
forms, <B>however they must be approved by the appropriate Assembly Long Range
Planning Committee prior to submission to the ATS Office.</B></P>
<P>The following description summarizes the key points of Assembly Project
Funding:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The application process for Assembly Project Funding is a two-staged
process whereby individuals submit <I>preliminary </I>requests for funding
during Review Cycle #1 (Fall) and <I>final</I> requests for funding during
Review Cycle #2 (Winter). </LI>
<LI>All applications for Assembly Project Funding that are received in the ATS
Office by the deadline dates are reviewed and evaluated by the ATS Program and
Budget Committee. Final approval of Assembly Project Funding rests with the ATS
Board of Directors. </LI>
<LI>Generally, Assembly Projects approved for funding for fiscal year 1997-98
will begin July 1, 1997 and will terminate June 30, 1998. Applicants who request
for two years of funding at the time of application will have funding available
from July 1, 1997 through June 30, 1999. </LI>
<LI>The funds that are allocated for Assembly Projects are not grants, they are
funds within the ATS budget that are reserved for specific projects of the
Assemblies. Assembly Project funds cannot be carried over from one year to the
next. Requests for multiple year projects must be made either at the time of the
first application (for 2-year projects) or through the use of a renewal
application. </LI>
<LI>Below you will find four (4) different applications for Assembly Projects
for the 1997-98 year. Please review the descriptions of each form prior to
completion. </LI></UL>

<P>ATS Board of Directors Approves Guidelines for Joint Projects </P>
<P>The ATS Board of Directors met on November 7-8, 1996 in Parsippany, NJ, and
approved a new set of procedural guidelines to standardize the process by which
the Society enters collaborative efforts with other professional societies. Over
the past five years, the ATS has a growing number of requests to sponsor or
endorse scientific or educational endeavors (meetings, workshops, guidelines) of
other professional societies. Traditionally, these requests were handled on a
case by case basis. However, as the numbers of such requests has grown, it
became necessary for the Society to standardize the process in ordle to handle
these requests in a fair manner. The guidelines, as approved by the ATS Board of
Directors (11/96), are as follows:</P>
<H2>SUGGESTED LEVELS OF PARTICIPATION IN COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS WITH THE
AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY For Projects Initiated by Organizations Other Than The
ATS</H2>
<P>The American Thoracic Society will review requests for participation in
collaborative efforts with outside organizations according to the following
guidelines:</P>
<H2>1. Co-Sponsorship</H2>
<P><B>A. Definition:</B> Co-sponsorship requires full participation by the
American Thoracic Society (ATS) in the planning, organization and implementation
of the project. As a co-sponsor, the ATS should have the opportunity to:</P>
<P>1) Organize and participate on a joint planning committee (if applicable)
and participate in selecting the committee chairperson.</P>
<P>2) The Planning Committee is responsible for planning the project, naming
the participants, determining the goals, objectives, timetable, resource
allocation.</P>
<P>3) Participate in all meetings, workshops, seminars that are related to the
project.</P>
<P>4) Review and comment on any draft documents that are produced as a result
of the project.</P>
<P>5) Jointly publish official educational/scientific proceedings of the
project (Official Statements, Position Papers, Clinical Guidelines, Workshop
Reports, etc.) in their scientific journal.</P>
<P>6) Be identified as a sponsoring organization of the project in all
documents.</P>
<P>7) In special circumstances, standing co-sponsorship agreements may be
established between the ATS and other professional /scientific societies.
</P>
<H1>B. Process:</H1>
<P>1) Decisions about co-sponsorship must take place when the project is in its
early stages and before it has been fully planned.</P>
<P>2) Informal inquiries and recommendations regarding an organization's
interest in collaborating with ATS on a particular project should be made by the
individual project chairpersons or the appropriate officer of the organization.
If collaboration is both desireable and feasible, then an official agreement
outlining the nature of the joint relationship will be made by the leadership of
the organizations.</P>
<P>3) All requests for co-sponsorship will be referred to the appropriate
Assembly or Committee. </P>
<P>4) The Assembly or Committee will appoint an ATS representative who will
work with the organization to develop an official proposal to be presented to
the Assembly or Committee for review. </P>
<P>5) The ATS representative will be responsible for completing a formal
proposal (including budgets) for review by the Assembly or Committee.</P>
<P>6) The Assembly or Committee will forward the proposal to the ATS Program
and Budget Committee for final approval. (The Program and Budget Committee will
set up a process to handle requests throughout the year).</P>
<P>7) Decisions concerning project financing, organization of meetings,
publication of results, must be made by the co-sponsoring organizations</P>
<P>8) ATS members involved in projects of other organizations do not represent
the ATS unless a formal agreement between that organization and the ATS has been
established. Therefore, ATS members involved in projects of other organizations
(or members with an awareness of projects that could be co- sponsored by the
ATS) should present a proposal to the appropriate Assembly or Committee for
review. </P>
<P>9) If a project is one that involves CME credit, it must follow the
guidelines of the ACCME. </P>
<P>10) Projects may require approval by the ATS Board of Directors in special
</P>
<P>circumstances.</P>
<H2>2. Endorsement</H2>
<P><B>A. Background/Definition:</B> The ATS receives many requests to endorse
conferences, recommendations or guidelines that have been developed by
professional medical/scientific societies with no official prior input from the
ATS. Endorsement implies that the ATS name and logo will be used to promote the
activities of these organizations and to enhance the scientific credibility of
the sponsoring organization. Therefore, the ATS has developed criteria to guide
decisions about ATS endorsement of activities of other organizations:</P>
<P><B>B. Criteria for Obtaining ATS Endorsement:</B></P>
<P>1) The requesting organization must have proven reputation in the
scientific/medical community.</P>
<P>2) The activities (conferences, recommendations, guidelines) to be endorsed
must conform to the standards established for similar ATS activities. </P>
<P>3) There must be a recognized benefit to the ATS.</P>
<P>4) Activities must not be in conflict or duplicate ATS activities.</P>
<P>5) Involvement of ATS members in the planning, development and
implementation of the activity is desireable.</P>
<P><B>C. Process for Organizations Requesting ATS Endorsement</B></P>
<P>1) Requests should be sent to the ATS Office (Executive Director or ATS
President) in New York for consideration.</P>
<P>2) Requests will be forwarded to the appropriate body within the ATS for
review, comment, and recommendation.</P>
<P><B>D. Other Considerations Regarding ATS Endorsement</B></P>
<P>1) Prior approval by the ATS must be obtained for the use of its name and
logo on any activities.</P>
<P>2) The ATS should have access to all activities that it has endorsed.</P>

<P>In May, 1996, the ATS Council of Chapter Representatives sponsored a
symposium on chest radiology at the ATS International Conference in New Orleans.
 Eleven unknown patient cases were presented to an expert panel for their
discussion and differential diagnosis.  Panel members were Dr. Scott Davies,
Associate Professor of Medicine, Hennepin County Medical Center, Minneapolis,
MN.,  Dr. George Sarosi, Professor of Medicine, Indiana University, and Chief of
Medicine, Roudabush VA Medical Center, Indianapolis, IN, and Dr. Joseph Lynch,
III, Professor of Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.  
</P>
<P>Dr. Michael Peterson, Associate Professor of Medicine, University of Iowa,
Iowa City, IA., chaired the symposium.  Dr. Jeffrey Galvin, Professor of
Radiology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA., presented radiology and Dr. Earl
Rose, Professor (emeritus) of Pathology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA., 
presented the pathology.  
</P>
<P>We are pleased that the total symposium content is now available at the
Virtual Hospital site.  By virtue of the UI College of Medicine&#146;s joint
sponsorship, it is possible to earn 3.0 hours of AMA Category 1 CME credit.  The
eleven cases are divided into three groups, each group worth one hour of
Category 1 credit. Please click onto the Virtual Hospital's logo above to begin.

<H1><A NAME="ats1">President's Report to the Board of Directors</A></H1></CENTER>
<P>As someone said after my inaugural speech, depending on how the ALA/ATS
relationship discussions go, I could come to be viewed as the Mikhail Gorbachev
of the ATS. However, thus far, a kind of &quot;pax thoracicus&quot; (analogous
to &quot;pas Sovieticus&quot; or &quot;pax Britanicus&quot;) remains intact, and
I don't think that I'm in danger of being toppled by a coup just yet.
</P>
<P>The analogy with the former Soviet Union, Ronald Reagan's &quot;evil empire,&quot;
is not entirely inappropriate, however. As I pointed out in my talk at the
annual meeting, we are quite a disparate group, and this is the source of
considerable strength. However, maintenance of the framework to ensure cohesion
requires considerable attention and energy and must be accorded a very high
priority in any restructuring. Any changes that are being contemplated must be
carefully examined to be certain that they do not contain the potential to lead
to the disintegration of the Society.
</P>
<P>I'll speak more and more specifically about the ALA/ATS relationship
discussions later.
</P>
<P>A major factor in maintaining the appeal of the Society is a structure that
enables all voices to be heard clearly. A lot of thought and attention have gone
into ensuring the constituencies are heard and have input into the policies and
programs of the Society, but we need to reexamine our workings continually to be
sure we are functioning as smoothly as possible. This brings me to the first
item in my report-mechanisms for developing Society-wide agendas this year.</P>
<P>There are several areas in which we need coordinated approaches to
developing our positions. The first of these is the public policy agenda. This
has as its major objective to provide guidance to the ALA/ATS Washington staff.
The agenda is to be developed by the Health Care Policy Committee with input
from the Clinical Practice Committee and the Research Advocacy Committee. In
addition, each assembly will be asked to identify important topics for inclusion
in the public policy agenda. The resulting document will be integrated with the
agenda developed by the ALA and will be reviewed and approved at the fall
meeting of the ALA/ATS Government Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>Second is the research agenda. The first document of this sort was developed
two to three years ago and currently is in need of revision. The Scientific
Advisory Committee is in charge of coordinating this process and all Assemblies
have been asked to identify a limited number of research areas and provide a
brief write-up describing the area. The Research Advocacy Committee will have
input and will be guided by the agenda as will the ALA/ATS Research Coordinating
Committee.
</P>
<P>This brings up an important point concerning the Research Coordinating
Committee-it isn't working as well as it should in part because of the way the
Medical Affairs Section of ALA is currently being operated. For example, the
Research Coordinating Committee has decided to fund only fellows in their 4th
and 5th years of training at a time when many institutions are doing away with
fellowship training beyond the 3rd year in an effort to decrease subspecialty
training positions. The basic problem is lack of any formal mechanism for ATS
review. Had the decision to fund only 4th and 5th year fellows been made within
the ATS, at the very least it would have been passed by the Training and
Workforce Committee.
</P>
<P>The next area of my report deals with three new committees I have appointed.
At our meeting in May, I indicated that I would appoint groups to address issues
related to women and minorities in the ATS. The letters to the proposed
committee members have just gone out. My charge to both groups is similar-to
recommend a way for health concerns of women and minorities to be addressed by
the Society and also to recommend ways in which the Society can be more &quot;user-friendly&quot;
for women and minorities. Although the charges are similar, the specific
approaches are sufficiently different. I am appointing two groups rather than
one. The idea is that these two groups will lay out a blueprint to follow and
implementation will be the responsibility of existing Committees or Assemblies
with oversight by the Board.
</P>
<P>The third new group I am appointing is a Communications Committee. This
group is charged with undertaking a comprehensive review of the Society's
communications and making recommendations for developing more effective means of
interacting with our members. This, I see as a high-priority undertaking. Given
the complexity of the Society, communication is the glue that binds us together.
</P>
<P>With regard to the ALA/ATS relationship discussions, little has happened
since our meeting in May. The ALA Task Force that developed the recommendations
presented to the ALA Board in March has been reappointed by Tom Gibson, ALA
President. The Steering Committee (ALA and ATS officers) met August 2nd and
3rd.These discussions are both extremely important and sensitive. It is our hope
to have recommendations to present to the Board next March.
</P>
<P>Before concluding, I would like to touch on two additional items: the first
of these is an as yet not fully formed idea to attempt to develop a more
coordinated approach to asthma research. The idea is to put together a meeting
of the major funders of asthma research, at least in the US, NHLBI, NIAID,
NIEHS, and ALA to attempt to identify overlaps, gaps, and areas of potential
collaboration, and by doing so, to provide guidance to the Asthma Research
Initiative. As I said, this isn't a fully-formed idea yet and needs input from
several sources including the Board before proceeding.
</P>
<P>Finally, I'd like to briefly describe a meeting concerning the clinical
trial of lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). As many of you know, the Health
Care Financing Administration (HCFA) in January decided that LVRS was
experimental, and that it would not reimburse for the procedure. However, HCFA
took the nearly unprecedented step of agreeing to fund the clinical costs of
LVRS for patients enrolled in a prospective, randomized trial of the procedure
if NHLBI would organize the trial. Claude Lenfant agreed, and the plans for such
a trial were announced in mid-May. Immediately, concerns were raised by the
Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and the American Association of Thoracic
Surgeons (AATS). Most of these concerns related to the number of participating
centers, the duration of the trial and details of the protocol. To address these
concerns, a meeting was arranged among Bruce Vladeck, HCFA administrator; Claude
Lenfant, Director NHLBI; Bob Reploge, President STS; Bob Wallace, Past-President
AATS; Deborah Shure, President ACCP; and myself, as President of ATS. Barry Make
and Alan Fein also attended, representing ATS, because I don't know anything
about LVRS. I won't go into the details of the meeting, but most of the concerns
were adequately addressed by Drs. Vladeck and Lenfant. A few additional problems
have arisen since the formal issuance of the RFP on June 3, but these do not
appear to be major.
</P>
<P>This exercise was, I think, important for several reasons. First, we were
able to reinforce the idea of studies such as this being a very useful approach
to provide scientific grounding for some aspects of health care policy. At the
same time, this increases the pool of resources available for research. Second,
having the four societies working together is a good model for potential future
collaborations. Third, we made ourselves more visible to HCFA. Finally, we were
able to &quot;operationalize&quot; our statement on LVRS. The approach being
taken is exactly what was recommended in our position paper.
</P>
<P>  I'll keep you informed of developments in the ongoing activities as well
as any new undertaking . If you wish to have me address specific issues, please
contact the Managing Editor.

<H1><A NAME="ats2">Report from the American Medical Association</A></H1></CENTER>
<H2>1996 Annual Meetings, House of Delegates</H2>
<H5>Joseph Sokolowski, Jr.</H5>
<P>The annual meeting of the American Medical Association (AMA) House of
Delegates (HOD) was held in Chicago, June 23-27, 1996. The HOD approved the
applications for membership of 12 additional specialty societies, granted an
additional delegate to two specialty societies that have unified membership with
the AMA, and provided seats for three National Medical Societies: the American
Medical Womens' Association, the American Osteopathic Association, and the
National Medical Association. One of the additional specialty societies approved
for membership was the American Sleep Disorders Association (ASDA). These
changes in membership will bring the total number of voting delegates to 447.</P>
<P>A major issue of discussion was the report on the Study of the Federation,
which represents the development of a collaborative process of all specialty and
subspecialty societies with the AMA. Recommendations approved by the House of
Delegates included the development of a &quot;Statement of Collaborative Intent&quot;
that respects the autonomy of constituent organizations such as the American
Thoracic Society (ATS), but also characterizes the nature of the working
relationships that must exist between the members of the new Federation if it is
to achieve its objectives.</P>
<P>There is a recognition of a special need for coordinated action with regard
to public policy activities for organizations represented in the AMA/Federation.
Active out-reach efforts will be developed to identify mechanisms for increasing
the participation of certain segments of AMA membership, women physicians, solo
practitioners, international medical graduates, minority physicians, research
physicians, and employed physicians. A Federation Coordination Team will be
established to clarify the roles and coordinate efforts in the Federation. There
will be a new delegate allocation formula to provide more representation from
the specialty societies in the AMA/HOD. Once a year, the AMA will send a
specialty representation ballot to each AMA physician member as well as fourth
year medical student members asking them to identify on the ballot one specialty
society to represent the AMA physician member in the AMA/Federation HOD for the
ensuing year. Voters will be members of the specialty society that they select
on the ballot to represent them. For the first 3 years, the number of delegates
and alternate delegates allocated to a specialty society will be on the basis of
one delegate and one alternate delegate for each 2,000 AMA members or portion of
2,000 AMA members who select that particular specialty society on the annual
ballot. In the 4th year, specialty society delegate allocation will be based on
one for each 1,000 members or fraction thereof. Each specialty society seated in
the HOD will be allocated at least one delegate. The balloting process will
begin in fall 1996 and will serve as a basis for the 1997 delegate allocation.
At the present time, it would appear that the ATS will have one delegate and one
alternate for the next 3 years but will be eligible to have two to three
delegates with their alternates beginning in 2000.</P>
<P> It is the perception that research funded by the tobacco industry
contributes more to the image of the industry than to science. The AMA/HOD has
adopted a resolution jointly sponsored by the ATS and the Medical Society of New
Jersey to decline acceptance of such funded research for publications. It was
pointed out to the HOD the journals of the ATS, the American Journal of
Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine and the American Journal of Respiratory
Cell and Molecular Biology have pursued this policy since December of 1995. This
resolution was opposed by the Section on Medical Schools, which warned against &quot;getting
on to the slippery slope when you are talking about what is tainted money.&quot;
Post-meeting comments included those of the Journal of the American Medical
Association editor, George D. Lundberg, who stressed that disclosure
requirements and the peer review process itself are the primary safeguards
against slanted research. He identified that the editorial policies of JAMA are
in complete agreement with the philosophical belief that tobacco-funded research
should not be performed by leading academic institutions. The current policy for
JAMA and the specialty journals is to consider the source of funding of all
studies as well as any financial conflicts of interest on an individual basis.
</P>
<P>Support for this resolution was provided by Joel Dunnington, President, Docs
Ought to Care, a Houston-based anti-tobacco organization for physicians and
other health professionals. He noted that it was not a question of editorial
freedom of the journals or academic freedom of medical schools to do research,
but a question of conspiracy on the part of the tobacco industry. The Council
for Tobacco Research, the industry's research arm, spent more than 220 million
dollars on 1,400 original studies between 1954 and 1994.
</P>
<P>The HOD called on the AMA to urge physicians to mark the covers of magazines
with tobacco advertising in their waiting room areas with the disclaimer that
the physician does not support the use of any tobacco products. It recommended
to its members that they not subscribe to magazines that advertise tobacco
products and the AMA will disseminate a list of magazines that do not publish
advertising for the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>The HOD asked the Department of Health and Human Services to continue
adequate funding for state anti-tobacco control programs, endorsed an AMA
statement calling for all physicians, health professionals, medical schools,
hospitals, and other health care interests to divest their investment portfolios
of any tobacco holdings, including mutual funds that trade in tobacco stocks and
urged that managed care organizations and life health insurance firms divest
their tobacco holdings as well.
</P>
<P>It has been pointed out that the effect of all resolutions relating to the
tobacco industry is that it encourages the States to pursue litigation against
tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>The HOD considered a Board report and four resolutions on physician-assisted
suicide, which attracted the attention of both the visual and written media.
They voted to reaffirm policies in opposition to physician-assisted suicide and
to identify additional activities for the AMA to include an educational campaign
to make palliative care, based on a values-based advanced care planning, the
standard for meeting the needs of patients at the end of their lives. The AMA
will work with local, state, and specialty medical societies to develop programs
to facilitate referrals to physicians qualified to provide necessary palliative
care for terminal patients seeking help with their physiological and
psychological needs. It will establish a faculty of physicians with expertise in
the end-of-life care who can provide ongoing consultation for their peers.
</P>
<P>There was continued debate on mandatory point-of-service provisions.
Specialty societies including the ATS have supported the policy the
point-of-service provisions should be included in all heath benefit plans that
restrict access to physicians through either closed panels or similar managed
care techniques. Those in opposition to mandatory point-of-service point out
that this would require modification of current AMA policy on pluralism in the
provision of medical care and possibly decrease patient choice by prohibiting a
patient from freely choosing health care coverage. There was a reaffirmation of
current AMA policy that states that all health plans or sponsors of such health
plans, which restrict a patient's choice of physician or hospital, offer at the
time of enrollment and at least for a continuous 1 month period annually, an
optional point-of-service feature so that patients who choose such plans may
elect to self refer to physicians outside the plan at an additional cost to
themselves.
</P>
<P>The increasing significance of latex allergy, particularly among health care
workers, was identified, and a resolution was adopted that the AMA would support
appropriate labeling of latex-containing medical devices and warnings about
possible allergic reactions. The AMA would also, along with interested medical
specialty societies, review and comment on Food and Drug Administration proposed
rules concerning user labeling for latex-containing medical devices.
</P>
<P>The final resolution sponsored by the ATS and approved by the HOD is that
the AMA will continue to oppose any federal initiative that would impose
restrictions on advocacy activities of federal grantees that preclude them from
both utilizing private funds for advocacy activities as well as delivering
government-funded services. This was in response to the legislation identified
as the Istook Proposal, introduced by Representative Ernest Istook of Oklahoma,
that would have established major grant restrictions on advocacy activities of
federal grantees that would have precluded these grantees from utilizing their
private funds for such activities. This legislation had been incorporated within
the Republican Health Care Plan at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>A year from now, the AMA will be celebrating in Chicago its sesquicentennial
anniversary of its founding. Activities commemorating the establishment of this
organization will begin in the fall of its interim meeting in Atlanta in
December.<BR>  <IMG SRC="images/slug1.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></P>

<H1><A NAME="ats3">Who's Who in ATS</A></H1></CENTER>
<H2>Kian Fan Chung, M.D.</H2>
<P><IMG SRC="images/chung.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">Dr. Chung is reader in thoracic
medicine at the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College School of
Medicine, London and is also a Consultant Physician at the Royal Bromptom
Hospital, London. Dr. Chung did his undergraduate medical studies at the
Middlesex Hospital Medical School, University of London, and received his MD
degree in 1983. He did his internship at the Middlesex Hospital, John Radcliffe
Infirmary and Hammersmith Hospital and was Chef de Clinique at the Hospital
Cantonal of Geneva, Switzerland, before undertaking specialized training in
Respiratory Medicine at the Charing Cross Hospital Medical School, London. He
later spent 2 years as a British Medical Research Council Travelling Fellow at
the Cardiovascular Research Institute, San Francisco, California. On his return
to London, he joined the National Heart and Lung Institute, where he pursued his
research interests in airway disease, particularly focusing on the mechanisms of
chronic airway inflammation.</P>
<P>Dr. Chung's major interest is on inflammatory mechanisms of the airways and
their relationship to the pathogenesis of symptoms and bronchial
hyperresponsiveness and on pharmacological control of inflammatory mechanisms.
Recent work has focused on the contribution and on the potential role of certain
cytokines including chemotactic cytokines and of their transcriptional
activation pathways in airway inflammatory cells. These transcriptional
mechanisms are also relevant to the induction of inflammatory cell recruitment
and damage by environmental pollutants with the recent demonstration that
activation of transcriptional factors such as nuclear factor kappa-B underlies
the gene activation of several inflammatory genes and enzymes following ozone
exposure. Dr. Chung is also interested in determining mechanisms that suppress
airway inflammation, particularly the expression of cytokines by other
cytokines, the effect of corticosteroids and potential anti-asthma drugs.
</P>
<P>Dr. Chung has co-authored over 180 peer-reviewed articles and books related
to the pharmacology of the airways. He is currently a member of the Editorial
Boards of the European Respiratory Journal and the American Journal of
Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. He is a Fellow of the Royal College of
Physicians, London and is a member of the ATS, European Respiratory Society, and
British Pharmacological Society. <BR>

<H2>Position Paper on LVRS Approved</H2>
<P>&quot;Lung Volume Reduction Surgery&quot; encompasses a variety of
procedures for relieving the symptoms of advanced chronic obstructive lung
disease due to emphysema. The expertise and preference of the surgeon determine
which procedure is used. The number of these procedures performed in the US has
rapidly increased, thus generating a lot of attention in the lay press. Yet
there has been limited information published in the peer-reviewed medical
literature. The ATS has concluded that: 1) LVRS appears to be helpful to some,
but not all patients; 2) further study is required before definitive
recommendations can be made; 3) surgery is recommended only on those patients
who are part of carefully planned clinical trials with well-defined protocols
with outcome measures that will determine the role of the LVRS in the future; 4)
funding be provided for multicenter clinical trials.</P>
<P></P>
<H2>Statement on Adverse Effects of Crystalline Silica Exposure Approved</H2>
<P>This statement was initiated at the request of the ALA Occupational Health
Expert Advisory Group to highlight the seriousness of silicosis as a major
disabling lung disease worldwide and to emphasize the need for increasing
efforts in prevention. It covers the various forms of exposure, including
occupational, domestic, environmental, and disease outcome. Recommendations are
made for education, prevention, respiratory protection, and further research.  
</P>
<P></P>
<H2>Consensus Report on Tissue Hypoxia Approved</H2>
<P>This report was developed as a result of the 3rd European Consensus
Conference in Intensive Care Medicine, which was organized by the Societe de
Reanimation de Langue Francoise and cosponsored by the ATS in conjunction with
the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. The objectives were to evaluate
the existing literature and to review the experts' presentations with regard to
the following questions: 1) how should tissue hypoxia be defined and detected by
clinical and biochemical methods in the critically ill; 2) to what extent is
tissue hypoxia implicated in organ dysfunction in the critically ill; 3) how
should tissue hypoxia be corrected; 4) what evidence is there that increasing
oxygen transport in the critically ill improves survival.<BR>

<H2>HCFA Delays Implementation of Physician Incentive Plan Regulation
</H2>
<P>Citing the need to resolve &quot;logically inconsistent deadlines&quot;
within the regulation published on 3/27/96, HCFA has announced it will delay
implementation of the regulation.  These regulations are in response to
legislation enacted in 1990 that called for prepaid health plans serving
Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients to: 1) not operate a physician
incentive plan that directly or indirectly makes specific payments to a
physician as an inducement to limit or reduce medically necessary services, 2)
disclose to HCFA physician incentive plans and 3) provide stop loss protection
for  incentive plans that place participating physicians at substantial
financial risk.
</P>
<P>Several trade journals for the managed care industry had suggested that the
delay in implementation was an indication that HCFA was considering large
changes in the regulation and would accommodate many of the concerns of the
managed care industry.
</P>
<P>At a meeting with staff from ATS and other provider groups, HCFA officials
assured concerned parties that the regulation will not change in substance. A
new regulation with consistent deadlines are expected. Based on assurances
provided by HCFA officials at the AMA meeting, the claims of the managed care
trade journals appear unfounded.
</P>
<P></P>
<H2>Kassebaum-Kennedy Health Reform Bill
</H2>
<P>In July, ATS staff met with Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) Chair of the
Senate Labor Committee, to express support for the Kassebaum-Kennedy Health
Insurance Reform bill. This bill would place limits on pre-existing conditions
exclusions, ensure portability of health insurance coverage and address a number
of other barriers in the private health market for people with chronic lung
disease. For several weeks, progress on the bill had been stalled by discussions
on Medical Savings Accounts (MSA). At the meeting, Senator Kassebaum expressed
her confidence that a deal on MSAs could be reached.
</P>
<P>Also in July, ATS staff met with Chris Jennings, White House staff from the
Office of Domestic Policy, to discuss the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. Mr. Jennings,
though stating that an agreement on MSAs was near, outlined additional
differences in the bill that had not yet been resolved. 
</P>
<P>ATS staff strongly encouraged all parties to resolve any outstanding issues
and pass a bill that will end the dilemma people with chronic health conditions
face in the private health insurance market. As of press time, it is unclear if
an agreement can be reached before the 104th Congress adjourns. <BR>

<H1><A NAME="ats6">ATS, ERS, and Latin American Meeting</A></H1></CENTER>
<P>The leadership of the ATS and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) held a
meeting with representatives of the Latin American pulmonary community in May
during the International Conference. Attendees came from such countries as
Argentina, Chile, Columbia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and
Venezuela. The purpose of the meeting was to explore the possibility of the
formation of an international organization of specialists in pulmonary and
critical care medicine in Central and South America. The meeting was convened by
the ATS Committee on International Relations. Although there are national
societies in pulmonary/critical care medicine, it was the feeling of the group
that one international society would facilitate interaction between national
groups working on the same issues. The development of this international
organization would be done in such a way that it would not decrease the
importance of the national societies. The group discussed the purpose of such a
society to include the holding of a major scientific conference, developing
continuing medical education groups primarily for clinicians, developing
standards and guidelines in pulmonary/critical care medicine that would be
consistent throughout the region and interacting with governmental agencies to
ensure that these standards are upheld.
</P>
<P>Following this meeting, in July, three representatives of the Latin American
group met in Brazil to develop a &quot;constitution&quot; for a society to be
reviewed by those who have expressed interest in such a society. The ATS and the
ERS will assist as requested in this endeavor. Another meeting will be held at
the ERS Annual Congress in Stockholm this September. <BR>

<H1><A NAME="ats7">Asthma Research Initiative</A></H1>
<P></P>
<P>Although the Asthma Research Initiative (ARI) has not yet been officially
and publicly announced, enthusiasm is mounting. Many early donors have come
forward with generous gifts in support of the ARI. These include the
contributions of two major donors- Schering Laboratories and Key
Pharmaceuticals, divisions of Schering Plough Corporation and the ALA of
Wisconsin-that each made gifts of $250,000 to the Asthma Research Initiative.
</P>
<P>In New Orleans in May, ALA/ATS had the privilege to honor Schering/Key and
the ALA of Wisconsin, for their exceptional commitment to our research endeavor.
To demonstrate our gratitude for their generosity, the new ALA Benefactor's
Award was presented to the Schering Plough Corporation and to the ALA of
Wisconsin. Each emphasized that by coming forward early, they intended to set an
example for others, understanding that the stronger the  support for this
Initiative in its formative stages, the greater the likelihood of enthusiastic
and widespread support - and ultimate success - for ARI in the long run.
</P>
<P>We are pleased that this gift of Key Pharmaceuticals and Schering
Laboratories represents their long-term commitment to working with ALA. As we
have seen, this gift of ALA of Wisconsin &quot;broke the ice&quot; for other
Lung Associations, many of which have subsequently made significant commitments
to the ARI. (See listing in the box.) We have also had a number of gifts and
pledges to the Campaign from ATS members and individual ALA volunteers and
staff, and many more of our members have indicated their interest in supporting
this exceptional effort. At present, twenty-five state committees have been
formed in cities with high ATS membership to conduct direct member solicitation.
This activity is intensifying and should be completed this fall.
</P>
<P>A newsletter, <I>Notes from the ARI</I>, is distributed every other month
to provide information about the progress of the Asthma Research Initiative. If
you are not currently receiving it, but would like to be on the mailing list, or
would like to discuss the Initiative, please contact Janice Raiford, Associate

Attendees During 1996 International Conference</A></H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/dennery.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For the third consecutive year, women members/attendees and underrepresented
minority members/attendees were invited to meet, network, and participate in
discussions focusing on relevant issues during separate luncheons held at the
International Conference in New Orleans, Louisiana, this May. The luncheons,
both supported by educational grants from Rh&ocirc;ne Poulenc-Rorer
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., were well attended with nearly 400 participants at the
Women's Luncheon and 200 at the Underrepresented Minorities Luncheon. Phyllis A.
Dennery, MD, Membership Committee Chair, led the Underrepresented Minorities
Luncheon discussions, focusing on past activities and future plans. The Women's
Luncheon, chaired by A. Sonia Buist, MD, former ATS President, included
discussions on networking and communicating in the ATS, as well as an update on
NIH activities. Philip Hopewell, MD, then President-Elect, spoke briefly to both
groups and announced the formation of an ATS Task Force on Women and an ATS Task
Force on Minorities, charged with recommending ways in which ATS programs could
become more relevant to women's and minorities' health issues, respectively, and
membership in ATS more attractive to these communities. <BR><IMG

<H2><B>PRESIDENT'S FY98 BUDGET PROPOSES 2.6% INCREASE FOR NIH</B></H2>
<P>The President's budget, to be released in February, is expected to propose
$13.1 billion (+2.6%) for NIH funding.  This number is still tentative and could
change before the budget is released.  Both Congressman Porter (R-IL) and
Senator Specter (R-IL), chairmen of the House and Senate L-HHS Appropriations
Subcommittee, have stated their intention to provide a greater increase for NIH.</P>
<P>Proposed funding by institute is unavailable at this time. </P>
<HR SIZE="4" WIDTH="50%">
<H2>HCFA &quot;GAG RULE&quot; LETTER</H2>
<P>In November 1996, HCFA Office of Managed Care sent a letter to Medicare
managed care providers informing them that beneficiaries under managed care were
entitled to the same benefits as those enrolled in the fee-for-service (FFS)
program.  The letter stated, </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Among the benefits which FFS beneficiaries are entitled is advice and
counsel from their physician on medically necessary treatment options that may
be appropriate for their condition or disease.  Beneficiaries enrolled in a
Medicare managed care plan are, likewise, entitled to such advice and counsel
from their physicians....Contractual provisions that limit a physician's ability
to counsel or advise a Medicare beneficiary are a violation of the law.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR SIZE="4" WIDTH="50%">
<H2>FRIENDS OF NIEHS COALITION MEETS</H2>
<P>A group of professional, voluntary health and environmental societies met
this week to organize a coalition to support NIEHS funding.  The coalition,
called Friends of NIEHS, has agreed to conduct grassroots activities to support
NIEHS funding.</P>
<HR SIZE="4" WIDTH="50%">
<H2>SENATOR KENNEDY INTRODUCES HEALTH INSURANCE BILL FOR KIDS</H2>
<P>Senator Kennedy introduced legislation to provide health insurance for
uninsured minors.  The bill would establish a federal-state partnership program
to help low-income families provide health insurance for their children. 
Assistance would also be extended to poor pregnant women.  The legislation,
anticipated to cost $9 billion annually, would be financed by an increase in the
federal excise tax on tobacco products.</P>
<HR SIZE="4" WIDTH="50%">
<H2>TWO BILLS INTRODUCED IN THE SENATE TO INCREASE RESEARCH FUNDING</H2>
<P>Senators Gramm (R-TX), Mack (R-FL), and Hutchinson (R-TX) introduced
legislation to double the amount of funds authorized for basic science and
medical research.  The bill was referred to the Senate Labor Committee. 
Increasing the &quot;authorization&quot; level merely adjusts how much Congress
is <B>allowed</B> to spend on research and has no impact on how much is
actually <B>available</B> to spend on research.</P>
<P>A similar bill was introduced by Senators Gramm (R-TX), Mack (R-FL), Frist
(R-TN), D'Amato (R- NY) and Specter (R-PA) expressing the sense of the Senate
that the federal commitment to biomedical research should be substantially
increased over the next five years.</P>
<P>Although neither bill is expected to have real impact on funding, they do
represent strong support for biomedical research on the part of the sponsors.</P>

<H2><B>ATS LEADERSHIP MEETS WITH NIEHS DIRECTOR</B></H2>
<P>ATS President Dr. Hopewell and Dr. Weiss met with NIEHS Director Dr. Olden
to discuss collaborative efforts between ATS and the Institute.  Topics
discussed included: FY98 funding, coordination of research activities, and NIEHS
activities at the International Conference. </P>

<H2>ATS RESPONDS TO GAO REQUEST FOR HOME 02 INFORMATION</H2>
<P>The ALA/ATS responded to the U.S. General Accounting Office's request of
information regarding home oxygen treatment for Medicare beneficiaries.  The
ALA/ATS response summarized studies on the efficacy of  home oxygen treatment
and commented that server cuts in payments for home oxygen services could
jeopardize the health of Medicare beneficiaries who require home oxygen therapy.</P>
<P>As you may recall, last year Congress proposed deep cuts in payments for
home oxygen services. The Senate Finance Committee, the Senate Committee which
oversees Medicare, asked GAO to research options for home oxygen therapy under
Medicare.  It is unclear when GAO's report will be completed.</P>
<HR SIZE="4" WIDTH="50%">
<H2>HOUSE PASSES &quot;TRUTH IN TESTIMONY&quot; RULE</H2>
<P>Earlier this month, the House Rules Committee passed the &quot;truth in
testimony&quot; rule.  This rule requires all public witnesses that testify
before Congress to disclose the amount of federal grants and/or contracts they
or the organization they represent receive during the past two fiscal years. 
Such a disclosure must be part of both the written and oral testimony. </P>
<P>The &quot;truth in testimony&quot; rule could be problematic for ALA/ATS
volunteers who are federal research  grant recipients or chair academic or
hospital departments that receive federal research grants.  At this point it is
unclear how broad or narrowly this rule will be interpreted.  </P>
<HR SIZE="4" WIDTH="50%">
<H2>SENATE DEMOCRATS SET TO INTRODUCE HEALTH INSURANCE BILL FOR KIDS</H2>
<P>Senate Democrats are expected to introduce two health bills to expand
insurance coverage to uninsured minors.  It is anticipate that one bill will
provide vouchers for parents of uninsured minors to purchase health insurance
policies for their children.  The second bill is expected to provide a
means-tested refundable tax credit for purchasing health insurance policies for
children.  Financing for these bill is as yet unclear but may include a tobacco
tax and/or eliminating &quot;corporate tax subsides.&quot;</P>
<HR SIZE="4" WIDTH="50%">
<H2>BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO EXPAND MEDICARE BENEFITS</H2>
<P>Congressional leaders are considering expanding Medicare benefits to include
preventative services.  Currently the only preventative services covered under
Medicare are flu shots and biannual mammograms.  The benefits being considered
include diabetes management, annual mammogram, PAP smears and pelvic exams every
three years, and annual prostate screening.  </P>
<P>Congressional leaders expect that introduction of these preventative care
benefits will provide long- term cost savings to the Medicare program.</P>
<HR SIZE="4" WIDTH="50%">
<H2>REP COBURN INTRODUCES MEDICARE MANAGED CARE BILL</H2>
<P>Rep. Coburn (R-OK) introduced legislation, the Medicare Patient Choice and
Access Act H.R. 66, that would provide protection to Medicare beneficiaries in
managed care plans.  The bill includes provisions on; timely access, access to
specialized care, continuity of care, out of network access, grievance
procedures, provider incentives, and notice of beneficiary rights.</P>

<H3><B>NIH &amp; CDC RECEIVE INCREASE IN HHS FY98 BUDGET REQUEST</B></H3>
<P>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which is home to NIH and
CDC, recently submitted its FY98 budget request to the Administration.  The HHS
budget request included a 2.3% NIH and 8.8% CDC increase over the
Administration's FY97 budget request (rather than  final FY97 funding levels
which were higher than the Administration's recommendation).  Although the
proposed funding increases for FY98 do not keep pace with actual increases in
FY97, they do signal that HHS views NIH and CDC as priority programs that should
receive increases. </P>
<P>Funding levels for specific divisions/institutes were not provided.  A need
for increased funding for the CDC Infectious Disease program was highlighted in
the budget request.  </P>
<P>Please remember that the budget request reflects what HHS would <B>like</B>
to spend for FY98.  The Administration is free to accept, reject or modify the
HHS budget recommendations.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><B>HHS CONTEMPLATES BLOCK GRANTS FOR TB/STD PROGRAMS</B></H3>
<P>Also contained the HHS budget request was combined funding for a &quot;Performance
Partnership&quot; program that would combine TB and STD funds in a block grant
to states.  Although this does not officially mean that the Administration will
revisit the block grant proposal, it is a strong signal that it will revisit the
TB/STD block grant approach in the 105th Congress.  ATS Washington Office staff
will continue to monitor this issue.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>ADMINISTRATION/CONGRESS EXPECTED TO REACH MEDICARE AGREEMENT</H2>
<P>Based on public statements made by the Administration and Congressional
leaders, it appears that  an agreement to fix the short-term Medicare Trust Fund
solvency issue will be resolved early in the 105th Congress.  Unlike last year's
Medicare debate, the anticipated agreement will be narrowly tailored to
resolving the solvency crisis facing the trust and will not tackle long-term
structural changes in the Medicare program.  It is also anticipated that the
agreement will include convening of a bi-partisan panel that will be charged
with making recommendations to address the long-term needs of the Medicare
program.  What is unclear at this point is how broad the panels mission will be
and if  its recommendations will merely be reported or whether they will be
policy recommendations that Congress will be required to act on.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><B>104th CONGRESS ADJOURNS</B></H3>
<P>After passing several &quot;must pass&quot; pieces of legislation, including
the year-long spending bill for FY97, the 104th has adjourned.  Members of
Congress will now return to their home states to prepare for the November
elections.  Due to the recess of Congress, the Washington Letter will also
suspend weekly publication.  Issues of the Washington Letter will be sent out as
issues arise over the Congressional recess.</P>
<P>As reported in last week's edition of the Washington Letter, Congress and
the Administration reached an agreement on a year-long spending measure for five
appropriations bills.  Included in year-long omnibus appropriations bill was a
6.9%increase in funding for NIH (see attached chart for Institute specifics). 
Also included in the bill were increases for the following Public Health Service
programs: CDC, Black Lung Clinics, Agency for Health Care Policy and Research
(see attached chart for program specifics)</P>
<H2>ATS STAFF MEETS WITH SENATOR PRESSLER</H2>
<P>This week, ATS staff met with Senator Pressler (R-SD), member of the Senate
Finance Committee, to discuss emerging health care issues.  Much of the
discussion focused on the need to protect the physician-patient relationship
from contractual and financial encumbrances, Medicare conversion factor and
research funding.</P>
<H2><B>PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ISSUES DRAFT RULES ON XENOTRANSPLANTATION</B></H2>
<P>In September, the Public Health Service (PHS) release draft guidelines on
xenotransplantation.  The objective of the guideline is to provide
recommendations for reducing the risk of transmission of infectious diseases to
the recipient, health care worker, and general public during
xenotransplantation.  The draft guidelines include comments on; protocol issues,
animal sources, archives of source animal medical records and specimens,
clinical issues, and public health needs.</P>
<P>For those interesting in more information about the xenotransplantation
guidelines, please contact:</P>

<H2>AMA EMBARKS UPON NEW NATIONAL PHYSICIAN ACCREDITATION PROGRAM</H2>
<P>In an attempt to provide a single, nationwide standard for physician
accreditation, the AMA has embarked upon a new accreditation program call the
American Medical Accreditation Program (AMAP).  The goal of the program is to
replace the duplicative credentialing programs used by different managed care
organizations and other insurance providers by providing a standardized
clinical, economic, and patient satisfaction profile used by health plans.  </P>
<P>AMAP would include five components; credentials (including education,
licensure and disciplinary actions), personal qualification (including
participation in peer review organizations, continuing medical education,
completion of a self-assessment program), environment of care (on site review of
clinical, operational and management systems in the physicians office) and
clinical performance (information comparing a physicians performance to norms
and national benchmarks).</P>
<P>This program is expected to have a multi-year phase in and will actively
solicit input from various speciality societies.</P>
<H2>ATS STAFF MEETS WITH ADMINISTRATION BUDGET OFFICIALS</H2>
<P>This week, ATS staff and the Coalition for Health Funding, met with
Nancy-Ann Min, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director for Public Health
Programs regarding the President's FY98 budget.  The purpose of the meeting was
to thank the Administration for providing funding for vital public health
programs and to urge the Administration to protect public health programs as
Congress moves towards a balance budget.  A key point stressed in the meeting is
the welfare reform at the state level has put greater strains and will continue
to demand more from the public health infrastructure.  Adequate funding will be
needed to meet this increase demands.  </P>

<H3><B>SOME DETAILS ON OMNIBUS SPENDING LEGISLATION AVAILABLE</B></H3>
<P>As you may recall, Congress, in an attempt to pass the remaining
appropriations bills before the start of the new fiscal year on October 1, is
working on an omnibus appropriations bill that will encompass the following five
appropriations bills: L-HHS, Defense, Treasury-Postal, Interior, and the
Commerce-Justice.  </P>
<P>Over the weekend, the House passed the omnibus appropriations bill.  The
Senate will consider the bill later today.  Although complete specifics on the
omnibus bill are not yet available, some unconfirmed details are available. 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>-the NIH will received the 6.9% increase recommended in the House measure. 
This increase of 6.9% is higher than both the President's request and the Senate
recommendation.  It is expected that Institute allocations will follow the House
recommendations.  
</LI>
<LI>-AHCPR will receive $143.6 million for FY97 (+$18.4 mil)
</LI>
<LI>- NIOSH will receive $141.5 million for FY97 (+$12.9)
</LI>
<LI>-CDC Center for Injury Control will receive 43.1 million for FY97 (+0)
</LI>
<LI>- CDC Infectious Diseases will receive $87.8 million (+$25.6)
</LI></UL>
<P><B> </B>--CDC TB Control will be flat funded at $119.3 million</P>
<P>Congress is expected to adjourn Monday, September 30.  More complete
information will be included in next week's edition of the Washington Letter.</P>
<H3><B>NIH REAUTHORIZATION PASSES THE SENATE</B></H3>
<P>In the typical end of session rush of legislative activity, the Senate
passed the NIH Reauthorization bill by unanimous consent.  As you may recall,
included in the Senate NIH Reauthorization bill are provisions to raise the
National Center for Human Genome Research to Institute status, create the Office
of Rare Disease Research, and increase support for clinical research through
General Clinical Research Centers (GCRCs).</P>
<P>Although the Senate completed action on NIH Reauthorization this Congress,
the House currently has no plans to consider the bill before the end of the
session.  Most probably, completion of  NIH Reauthorization will wait until the
105th Congress.</P>
<H2>GAO CONTACT ATS/ALA REGARDING HOME OXYGEN  PAYMENTS</H2>
<P>As you may recall, during discussion of Medicare cuts, Congress was
considering deep cuts in payment for home oxygen  services.  Some Medicare
reform plans called for a 20% cut initially, phased into a 30% cut with a freeze
for inflation.  Several patient and provider groups expressed concern that the
severity of the cuts could severely compromise the quality and treatment options
for home oxygen beneficiaries.</P>
<P>The Senate Finance has asked the Government Accounting Office to prepare a
report on home oxygen  payments including appropriate pricing and potential
impact on beneficiaries.  The GAO has asked the ATS/ALA to comment on the impact
that cuts may have on services to beneficiaries.  Final comments are due by
December 15, 1996.</P>
<H2><B>ATS STAFF MEETS WITH DR. SATCHER OF CDC</B></H2>
<P>At a meeting hosted by the Coalition for Health Funding, Dr. Satcher
discussed CDC prospects for FY98 and beyond.  Dr. Satcher mentioned that CDC is
increasingly called on to respond to epidemics overseas and that CDC does not
currently have authority or funding for such international missions.  CDC, in
cooperation with US Agency for International Development, has been able to
receive funding on an ad hoc basis for international requests, but Dr. Satcher
pointed out the need for a more sustainable solution.</P>
<H2><B>ATS/ALA SENDS LETTERS TO CONGRESS  &quot;Gag&quot; Rule Letter</B></H2>
<P>This week, the ATS and ALA signed on to a letter sponsored by the AMA
encouraging Congress to enact legislation eliminating &quot;gag&quot; rules from
insurers contracts with health care providers.  Despite Congressional interest,
it is unlikely that Congress will consider the &quot;Gag&quot; rule legislation
before the end of the 104th Congress.  </P>
<H2><B>Coburn/Sanders Financial Incentives Amendment</B></H2>
<P>On a related issue, the ATS/ALA sent a letter to members of the House and
Senate Treasury-Postal Appropriations Committee urging the members to retain the
House language in omnibus appropriations bill to prevent health plans that offer
benefits to federal employees, retirees and their families from utilizing
financial incentives arrangements which may result in withholding of care or
denial of a referral for health care. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, the amendment was dropped during negotiations on the Omnibus
Appropriations bill.</P>

<H3><B>CONGRESS MOVES PASSING OMNIBUS SPENDING LEGISLATION</B></H3>
<P>Congress, in an attempt to pass the remaining appropriations bills before
the start of the new fiscal year on October 1, reportedly will roll five
spending bills into a single omnibus legislative measure. The five
appropriations bills include L-HHS, Defense, Treasury-Postal, Interior, and the
Commerce- Justice spending bills. </P>
<P>NIH and CDC are expected to receive increases in the omnibus spending bill.
</P>
<H3><B>VA-HUD FY97 APPROPRIATIONS</B></H3>
<P>Last week, House and Senate conferees finished work on the FY97 VA-HUD
appropriations bill.  The conferees recommended $262 million for VA research. 
This amount is $5 million more that FY96 but $15 million less than the House
recommendation for VA research funding.  The bill also includes $6.7 billion for
EPA programs.</P>

<P>The conferees also accepted modified versions of health care provisions
passed in the Senate bill.  The conference report contains language requiring
health plans to: pay for at least 48-hours of hospitalization for new mothers
and their infants after delivery, require health plans to have equal life- time
limits on mental and physicals illnesses for the health plans that offer mental
health coverage, and require the VA to provide veteran's benefits to children
with spina bifida whose parents were exposed to Agent Orange during the Vietnam
War.</P>
<P>The House and Senate are expected to consider the conference report early
this week.  Congressional sources express confidence that the President will
sign the conference bill.</P>
<H2>GAO CONTACT ATS/ALA REGARDING HOME OXYGEN  PAYMENTS</H2>
<P>As you may recall, during discussion of Medicare cuts, Congress was
considering deep cuts in payment for home oxygen  services.  Some Medicare
reform plans called for a 20% cut initially, phased into a 30% cut with a freeze
for inflation.  Several patient and provider groups expressed concern that the

impact on beneficiaries.  The GAO has asked the ATS/ALA to comment on the impact
that cuts may have on services to beneficiaries.  Final comments are due by
December 15, 1996.</P>
<H2><B>ATS/ALA SENDS LETTER TO WAYS &amp; MEANS REGARDING &quot;GAG&quot;
RULES</B></H2>
<P>This week, the ATS and ALA sent a letter to House Ways and Means Committee
members urging them to consider H.R. 2976, the Patient Right to Know Act,
without amendment.  As you may recall, this legislation would prevent health
insurance plans from utilizing &quot;gag&quot; clauses that interfere with
communication between providers and patients regarding medical conditions and
treatment options.  Earlier this summer, the legislation  was passed by the
House Commerce Committee.</P>

<H3><B>VA-HUD FY97 APPROPRIATIONS</B></H3>
<P>Last week, the Senate passed the VA-HUD FY97 Appropriations bill. Included
in this legislation is $262 million for VA research, an increase of $5 million
over FY96.  As you may recall, the House bill provided $277 million for VA
research (+$20 million).  </P>
<P>During consideration of the bill, the Senate accepted an amendment to grant
parity for mental health benefits.  The House bill does not contain the mental
health provision.  </P>
<P>A conference committee with members from each chamber will be convened to
resolve the different  proposals.  ALA/ATS will contact members to encourage VA
research funding at the House recommended level.  It is unclear how the
conferees will approach the mental health issue.</P>
<H3><B>L-HHS FY97 APPROPRIATIONS</B></H3>
<P>This week, the Senate L-HHS Subcommittee and Appropriations full committee
completed consideration of the FY97 L-HHS bill.  This bill provides$12.4 billion
for NIH funding and $2.2 billion for CDC for fiscal year 1997 operations.  While
the Senate numbers are not as generous as the House numbers for NIH, the Senate
Appropriations Committee did provide an increase above the President's budget
request.  A complete list of funding by Institute is attached.</P>
<P>Regarding programs of interest at CDC, the Senate provided $119.3 million
for TB control, the same as last year's funding, and $136.5 million for NIOSH. 
</P>
<P>Due to time constraints, it is unclear if the FY97 L-HHS bill will be
conferenced.  It has been suggested that the bill may be included in a six month
continuing resolution which will fund government activities until after the
election.  Most observers expect the continuing resolution to use the House
and/or Senate recommendations for NIH and CDC funding.</P>
<H3><B>FY97 TREASURY-POSTAL BILL</B></H3>
<P>Earlier this year, the House passed the FY97 Treasury-Postal bill.  Included
in this bill was language to prevent health plans for federal employees from
using &quot;financial incentive arrangements which may result in the withholding
of care or the denial of a referral for health care.&quot;  This week, the
Senate considered the FY97 Treasury-Postal bill.  During floor consideration,
Senator Helms offered an amendment to add similar language to the Senate version
of the Treasury-Post bill.  </P>
<P>Due to procedural difficulties with the amendment and problems with the
underlying bill, the Treasury-Postal bill was pulled from the Senate floor.  It
is likely that the bill will now be included in a 6 month continuing resolution.
</P>
<H3><B>ATS/ALA COMMENT ON VARRAC DRAFT REPORT</B></H3>
<P>Last month, ATS/ALA sent comments to Dr. Kizer's office regarding the VA
Research Realignment Advisory Committee Draft report.  Dr. Kizer's office
received over 200 comments from concerned VA researchers and institutions.  The
Committee will be reviewing the written comments and is expected to release its
final report in October, 1996.</P>
<H3><B>PATIENT RIGHT-TO-KNOW ACT CONSIDERED BY WAYS &amp; MEANS COMMITTEE</B></H3>
<P>In the coming weeks, the House Ways &amp; Means Health Subcommittee is
expected to consider the Patient Right-to-Know Act, H.R. 2976, sponsored by Rep.
Ganske (R-IA-4th).  This legislation would prevent health insurance plans from
utilizing &quot;gag&quot; clauses that interfere with communication between
providers and patients regarding medical conditions and treatment options. 
Earlier this summer, the legislation  was passed by the House Commerce
Committee.  The bill must next be considered by two additional committees before
it can be considered by the full House.  It is unclear if this legislation will
be considered by the full House this Congress. </P>
<H3><B>DR. MARTIN GORDON TESTIFIES AT TOBACCO HEARING</B></H3>
<P>Dr. Martin Gordon, physician to lung cancer patient Morton Downey Jr.,
testified with Mr. Downey at a Senate hearing regarding tobacco and the recent
FDA proposal to regulate tobacco to protect children.  Several major T.V.
stations and newspapers carried stories on the event. </P>

<H3>HEALTH SPENDING FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998</H3>
<P>Wednesday, August 14, ATS staff met with John Callahan, Assistant Secretary
for Management and Budget for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
to discuss funding for health programs for FY98.  Mr. Callahan painted an
encouraging picture for funding for health programs in FY98.</P>
<P>Mr. Callahan's optomistic protrayal of  FY98 health spending is in contrast
to warnings Mr. Callahan made at a February meeting where he warned that FY98
would see increasing cuts in domestic discretionary spending. </P>
<H3>ATS/ALA COMMENTS ON VARRAC DRAFT REPORT</H3>
<P>The ATS/ALA submitted a letter to Dr. Kizer, VA Under Secretary for Health,
regarding the VA Research Realignment Advisory Committee (VARRAC) draft report. 
Letter expressed the following concerns; designated research areas (DRAs)
proposed in the report could make the VA research program too targeted,
insufficient attention given to pulmonary disease in recommended DRAs, the
report does not forcefully call for increase Congressional support for VA
research, and the career development programs should not be funded from
investigator initiated research budgets.</P>
<H3>PATIENT RIGHT TO KNOW ACT APPROVED BY HOUSE COMMERCE COMMITTEE</H3>
<P>The Patient Right to Know Act, introduced by Rep. Greg Ganske (R-IA-4th),
was approved by the House Commerce Committee before the August recess.  This
legislation would prevent health plans from placing &quot;gag&quot; clauses in
health care providers contracts that would restrict or interfere with medical
judgement.</P>
<P>Although this legislation was passed by the House Commerce Committee, it
needs approval by three other House Committees - Ways and Means, Economic &amp;
Educational Opportunities, and Government Reform and Oversight -  before it can
be considered for floor action.  Ways &amp; Means Health Subcommittee Chair Bill
Thomas (R-CA-21st) has stated his intention to mark up the bill in September. 
The fate of the in these other committees is uncertain.  It is unclear if the
bill will see House floor action during this Congress.</P>
<H3>MEDICAL LICENSING BAN PASSES HOUSE</H3>
<P>During consideration of the FY97 Commerce, Justice and State Appropriations
bill, language offered by Rep. Greg Ganske (R-IA-4th) was included to prohibit
the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) from issuing licensing for medical
procedures.  The amendment would provide exemptions for patentable new drugs,
treatment on diagnosis devices, biologic products, and new uses for non-
patentable drugs.  </P>
<P>Senator Bill Frist (R-TN) has offered similar legislation in the Senate.  It
is unclear if this language will remain in the final version of the bill.</P>
<H3>WASHINGTON LETTER GOES ON RECESS</H3>
<P>The Washington Letter will temporarily suspend publication during the
remainder of the Congressional August recess.  Publication will resume when
Congress returns to session early in September.</P>

<H3>KASSEBAUM-KENNEDY HEALTH REFORM CLEARS MSA HURDLE </H3>
<P>After several weeks of debate over medical savings accounts (MSAs), it
appears that differences have been resolved.  Yesterday Senator Kennedy (D-MA),
an MSA opponent, and Rep. Archer (R-TX), an MSA advocate, struck a compromise to
limit the size and scope of MSAs.  Although differences still remain between the
House and Senate bill, the expectation is that the issues will be successfully
resolved.  </P>
<P>In a meeting held with ATS/ALA staff yesterday, Senator Kassebaum (R-KS)
expressed her confidence that the legislation would pass Congress before the
August recess.</P>
<H3>HCFA DELAYS IMPLEMENTATION OF PHYSICIAN INCENTIVE PLAN REGULATION</H3>
<P>Citing the need to resolve &quot;logically inconsistent deadlines&quot;
within the regulation published on 3/27/96, HCFA has announced it will delay
implementation of the regulation.  These regulations are in response to
legislation enacted in 1990 that called for prepaid health plans serving
Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients to: 1) not operate a physician
incentive plan that directly or indirectly makes specific payments to a
physician as an inducement to limit or reduce medically necessary services, 2)
disclose to HCFA physician incentive plans and 3) provide stop loss protection
for  incentive plans that place participating physicians at substantial
financial risk.</P>
<P>Several trade journals for the managed care industry had suggested that the
delay in implementation was an indication that HCFA was considering large
changes in the regulation and would accommodate many of the concerns of the
managed care industry</P>
<P>HCFA officials, attending a meeting hosted by the AMA, assured physician
groups that the regulation will not change in substance.   A new regulation with
consistent deadlines is expected shortly.   Based on assurances provided by HCFA
officials at the AMA meeting, the claims of the managed care trade journals
appear unfounded.</P>
<H3>SENATE L-HHS APPROPRIATION SUBCOMMITTE MARK UP DELAYED</H3>
<P>The Senate L-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee has postponed mark up of the
Senate FY97 L- HHS bill until after the August recess.  The mark up was
originally scheduled for this week.</P>
<H3>HOUSE HOLDS HEARING ON &quot;PATIENT RIGHT TO KNOW ACT&quot;</H3>
<P>The House Ways and Means Committee has scheduled hearings next week on Rep.
Ganske's (R- IA) Patient Right to Know Act.  This act would prohibit health
plans from preventing providers from discussing the full range of treatment
options that may not be covered by the insurer.  These so called &quot;provider
gag rules&quot; have become common parts of some managed care contracts. </P>

<H3><B>NIH REAUTHORIZATION</B></H3>
<P>On Wednesday, July 17, the Senate Labor Committee completed mark up of the
NIH Reauthorization bill.  Included in the bill are provisions to raise the
National Center for Human Genome Research to Institute status, create the Office
of Rare Disease Research, and increase support for clinical research through
General Clinical Research Centers (GCRCs).</P>
<P>As reported earlier in the Washington Letter, legislative language was
included in the bill to direct GCRCs to, &quot;support clinical studies and
career development in all settings of the hospital or academic medical center
involved.&quot;  This language was included to address the concern that GCRCs
had not  traditionally supported inpatient, outpatient and critical care
medicine clinical research.</P>
<P>During consideration of NIH Reauthorization, four amendments concerning
pediatric research, Parkinsons Disease, diabetes and bioengineering were
adopted.  A fifth amendment regarding chronic pain management was put aside.</P>
<P>Although it is not expected that the NIH Reauthorization bill will be passed
this Congress, it is likely that the Senate will consider the bill in the fall. 
No action is expected in the House this Congress.</P>
<H3><B>HOUSE AND SENATE INCREASE EPA FUNDING</B></H3>
<P>Earlier this month, the House passed the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies
Appropriation bill (VA-HUD).  This bill provides funding for the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA).  The House bill provides $6.547 billion for the FY97
EPA operations, an increase of $19 million over FY96.</P>
<P>Last week, the Senate Appropriation Committee completed action on the VA-HUD
bill and recommended approximately $6.6 billion for EPA, nearly $30 million more
than the House recommendation and about $75 million more than FY96.  The full
Senate is expected to consider the bill sometime this week.</P>

<H3><B>HOUSE AND SENATE APPROVE INCREASES IN VA MEDICAL RESEARCH</B></H3>
<P>The U.S. House of Representatives recently completed action on its FY97
VA-HUD Appropriations bill.  This bill includes funding for VA health programs
and the VA Medical Research Program budget.  During consideration of the bill,
the House accepted an amendment offered by Rep. Tiahrt (R-KS-4) to add $20
million to the VA medical research programs, raising total funding for FY97 to
$277 million.  The amendment offset the $20 million increase by cuts to the
AmeriCorps program.</P>
<P>In Senate action, the Senate VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee recommended
$257 million (+ $5 million) for FY97.  Senator Leahy (D-VT) was instrumental in
securing the $5 million for VA research increase in the Senate bill. </P>
<P>The full Senate is expected to consider the VA-HUD bill sometime this week.</P>
<H3><B>ADDITIONAL $2 MILLION PROVIDED FOR BLACK LUNG CLINICS</B></H3>
<P>During consideration of the L-HHS Appropriations bill, the House accepted an
amendment sponsored by Congressman Ney (R-OH-18) to add $2 million for black
lung clinics, raising funding for FY97 to $3.9 million.  The $2 million addition
 was offset by cuts to the Department of Health and Human Services budget for
the Office of Public Affairs and the Office of Legislation and Intergovernmental
Affairs.  The L-HHS Subcommittee had recommended cutting the program by $1.9
million. </P>
<H3><B>SANDERS/COBURN AMENDMENT ADOPTED IN TREASURY-POSTAL BILL</B></H3>
<P>Last week, during consideration of the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill,
the House adopted an amendment offered by Rep. Sanders (I-VT-At Large) and Rep.
Coburn (R-OK-2nd) to place limits on the types of &quot;provider incentive plans&quot;
that can be used in health plans the serve federal employees.  The amendment can
be viewed as a small victory for patient access to specialist health care
providers.  </P>
<P>It is unclear whether the Senate will consider a similar provision. </P>
<H3><B>KASSEBAUM-KENNEDY HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM BILL STALLED IN SENATE</B></H3>
<P>Despite strong bipartisan support for the bill, progress on the legislation
has been stalled over Medical Savings Accounts.  Although both Republicans and
Democrats have agreed to adopt a compromise in the form of a demonstration
project on  MSA provisions, neither side can agree on the details.  </P>
<P>The dispute over MSA provisions is currently at an impasse U.S. Senate. 
Both parties are using the difficulties over the bill for political posturing
for the November election.  Leaders from both parties are publicly speculating
that the bill may be dead for this Congress.</P>

<H3>FULL HOUSE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER L-HHS BILL </H3>
<P>The House Appropriations Committee last week began consideration of the
L-HHS bill.  The full Committee will resume consideration on Tuesday, June 25. 
As you may recall, earlier this month the House L-HHS Appropriations
Subcommittee recommended a 6.9% increase for NIH over FY96. The increase
recommended for FY97 operations, includes 6.5% for research programs, while the
remaining .4% increase is for renovation of the NIH Campus Clinical Center.  For
a list of funding increases by Institute, please see last page of this fax.</P>
<P>Also included in the L-HHS bill was language to limit the NIH funding of the
Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) grants to only those whose median
priority scores are equal to or better than the median score of R01s.  This
provision, if maintained in the bill, should limit the funds used to support
SBIR grants. </P>
<H3>CHAIRMAN PORTER CHAMPIONS NIH</H3>
<P>For the past two years, Representative John Porter (R-IL-10th), Chairman of
the L-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, has made NIH funding his highest
priority.  His leadership in the House of Representatives is the central reason
NIH has received a generous increase in funding during austere budget
circumstances.</P>
<H3>NIH REAUTHORIZATION</H3>
<P>Staff of the Senate Labor Committee, which has jurisdiction over
reauthorization of NIH,</P>
<P>is continuing to draft the NIH reauthorization bill.  It is expected that
the bill will include provisions to promote the Human Genome Research Center to
Institute status.  Also believed to be in the draft are provisions directing
General Centers of Clinical Research to support clinical research in all
hospital/academic medical center settings. </P>
<P>It is unclear if enough time remains in the 104th Congress for NIH
reauthorization to receive consideration.</P>
<P><B>LOBBYING ACTIVITIES</B></P>
<H3>CDC Visits</H3>
<P>ATS staff this week will participate in CDC Coalition visits to advocate for
CDC funding.  The CDC Coalition will meet with staff from the following offices:
 Senators Mikulski (D-MD), Harkin (D-IA), Byrd (D-WV), Cochran (R-MS) and Bond
(R-MO).</P>
<H3>VA Health Programs</H3>
<P>In conjunction with the Friends of VA Coalition (FOVA), last week ATS met
with staff of the Senate VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee.  Although it is by
no means certain, based on feedback from these visits, FOVA is cautiously
optimistic that the Senate will recommend an increase in VA Biomedical Research
funding for FY97.  </P>

<H3>HOUSE TO MARK UP L-HHS BILL NEXT WEEK</H3>
<P>On Wednesday, June 12, the House L-HHS Appropriations Committee is
tentatively  scheduled to begin mark up of the FY97 L-HHS bill.  Contained in
the L-HHS bill is  funding for the NIH and CDC programs.</P>
<P>Congressman John Porter (R-IL-10th), chair of the House L-HHS Appropriations
 Subcommittee, has stated his goal is to increase NIH funding by 6.5% in the
FY97 L- HHS Appropriations bill.  While it is likely that the House L-HHS
Subcommittee NIH  allocation will come near the 6.5% mark, the full House
Appropriations Committee may  try to reduce any NIH increase.</P>
<P>It is expected that Chairman Porter will provide CDC with flat funding or a
small  increase for FY97.</P>
<H3>HOUSE WAYS &amp; MEANS COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES HEARING ON GME</H3>
<P>The House Ways &amp; Means Health Subcommittee will hold hearings on GME
funding on  Tuesday, June 11.  The focus of the hearing will be to give the
Administration the  opportunity to respond to the recommendations of the IOM and
Pew Foundation on GME  presented to the Health Subcommittee earlier this year. 
ATS staff will attend the hearing.   The ATS/ALA will submit written comments
for the committee record.  </P>
<H3>HEALTH CARE REFORM</H3>
<P>The Kassebaum/Kennedy health care reform bill continues to held up in
discussions  between the House and Senate.  Although a number of technical
problems appear to be  resolved, issues surrounding medical savings accounts
(MSAs), multiple employer  welfare arrangements (MEWAs), malpractice and mental
health parity remain  unresolved.</P>
<H3>HOUSE VA-HUD MARK UP</H3>
<P>Last week, the House VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee marked up the FY97
VA- HUD Appropriations bill.  Included in the VA-HUD legislation is funding for
VA  medical and research programs and the EPA.  The Subcommittee provided $6.547
billion  for EPA programs.  This is a slight increase over FY96 enacted funding
and a $1.6 billion  increase over the House Subcommittee's recommendation in
FY96.  Although compared  to last year's proposal, the bill is relatively free
of legislative riders, it does contain  provisions in the report language of
concern to the ATS/ALA including: a $1 million cut  to EPA research and
development programs and a $8.5 cut from EPA enforcement  programs.</P>
<P>The Subcommittee recommended $16.438 billion for VA medical care for FY97. 
This  compares to  the Subcommittee recommendation of  $15.775 billion for FY96.
 The  Subcommittee also recommended $257 million for VA medical research for
FY97.  This  is the same amount of funding for VA medical research that was
enacted in FY96.</P>
<H3>SENATORS SNOWE &amp;  MIKULSKI INTRODUCES WOMEN'S HEALTH LEGISLATION</H3>
<P>Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) introduced 
legislation to address women's health needs.  The Women's Health Equity Act,
S.1799,  would address such issues as employment of women scientists, funding
for breast,  cervical and cardiovascular research, impact on women's health of
environmental hazards  and other issues.  The bill also touches on abortion and
reproductive rights issues.</P>
<P>On separate legislation, earlier this year Senator Snowe introduced
legislation to prevent  health plans from preventing, denying or limiting
coverage for services provided as part  of an  &quot;approved&quot; clinical
trial.  &quot;Approved&quot; clinical trials would include trials sponsored  by
NIH, FDA, VA or other qualified non-governmental agency as defined by NIH.  This
 legislation closely mirrors language included in the Clinical Research
Enhancement Act  introduced by Senator Mark Hatfield (R-OR).</P>
<H3>FY97 BUDGET</H3>
<P>House and Senate negotiators have begun work a Budget Resolution.  Each
chamber has  passed a budget resolution.  The House plan would spend $1.62
trillion while the Senate  plan is at $1.63 trillion.  Both chambers propose to
balance the budget by the year 2002  and both would entail spending and tax
cuts.  While similar in scope and direction, there  are a few significant
differences between the bills.  The House bill provides more money  for defense
spending, both in FY97 and the out years.  The Senate bill proposes to spend  $5
billion more on domestic discretionary spending in FY97.  To start the
appropriations  process in the House, tentative allocations to the
Appropriations Subcommittee have been  made.  Allocations to the Senate
Appropriation Subcommittees will be released after the  House/Senate conference
on the budget resolution is completed.</P>

<HR>
<H3>CONGRESS PASSES 12th CONTINUING RESOLUTION</H3>
<P>Last week, before leaving for the Easter/Passover recess, Congress passed
the 12th Continuing Resolution (CR)providing funds for FY96 operations for the
federal departments and agencies whose appropriations bills have not yet been
enacted.  The current CR expires on April 24.  <BR><BR>
</P>
<H3>THE BUDGET RESOLUTION</H3>
<P>Last week, the Senate completed work on the budget resolution for fiscal
year 1997.   During floor consideration of the resolution, the Senate accepted
an amendment to raise  discretionary spending by $5 billion above the House
level.   As you may recall, the resolution is a document prepared by Congress
that outlines  spending and deficit targets for the next fiscal year.  Although
the budget resolution does  not require the President's signature and does not
have the force of law, it does impact  federal fiscal policy. 
<BR><BR> Last week that House determined Appropriations Subcommittee
allocations for FY97  spending.  As shown in the table below, the House L-HHS
Committee allocation  increased $1.6 billion (+2.6%) and the VA-HUD allocation
also increased by $1.8 bil  (+2.9%).  The Senate numbers are expected to be
announced this week.
<BR><BR> Discretionary Spending Budget Authority Allocations by Committee (in
billions)
</P>
<PRE><B>Committee	FY96 Enacted	FY97 President	FY97 House
---------	------------	--------------	----------</B>
L-HHS		$63.24		$73.80		$64.89
VA-HUD		$62.34		$67.57		$64.15

</PRE>
<H3>FY97 APPROPRIATIONS</H3>
<P>On Thursday, May 30, the House VA-HUD Subcommittee is scheduled to begin
mark up  of  its FY97 measure.  Included in this legislation are spending levels
for VA biomedical  research and the EPA.
<BR><BR> The House L-HHS Subcommittee is expected to begin mark up starting
June 6.  Programs  with the L-HHS jurisdiction include NIH and CDC funding.  
</P>
<H3>HEALTH CARE REFORM BILL</H3>
<P>Inside sources say that a compromise between the House and Senate on a
health care  reform bill may be near.  As you may recall, earlier this year the
Senate passed the  Kassebaum/Kennedy bill that sought to reduce pre-existing
conditions limitations, ensure  portability and guarantee renewability of health
insurance policies.  Also included in the  Senate bill was a provision to
provide parity for mental health benefits.
<BR><BR> The House passed parallel legislation that included a number of
provisions not found in  the Senate bill including: medical savings accounts
(MSAs), malpractice reforms, and  group purchasing/multi-employer welfare
arrangements (MEWAs).  President Clinton  earlier announced that he would veto
any bill with MSA provisions, but it appears a  &quot;MSA demonstration&quot;
compromise may be worked out. Although it is too early to tell, it appears that
malpractice provisions will be dropped from  the bill.   
</P>
<H3>HOUSE HEARINGS ON MANAGED CARE ISSUES</H3>
<P>On Thursday, May 30, the House Commerce Health and the Environment
Subcommittee  is scheduled to hold hearings on issues in managed care.  The
hearings will focus on &quot;gag  clauses&quot; contained in some managed care
contracts that prevent providers from  discussing the full range of treatment
options that may not be covered by the insurer.   Legislation to prohibit these
&quot;gag clauses&quot; has been introduced in the House.  
</P>
<H3>LOBBYING ACTIVITIES</H3>
<P><B>Lung Volume Reduction Surgery (LVRS)Meeting with HCFA/NHLBI</B>
<BR><BR><BR> Representatives of the ATS, the Society for Thoracic Surgeons,
and the American  College of Chest Physicians met with Mr. Vladek of the HCFA
and Dr. Lenfant of the  NHLBI to discuss the Medicare sponsored LVRS clinical
trial.  Topics discussed  included the process of developing the protocol, the
scope of questions to be answered by  the trial, the number of patients/centers,
the role of the registry and payment issues.  The  RFP for the trial is expected
early next week.  Representing the ATS was Dr. Phil  Hopewell, Dr. Barry Make
and Dr. Allen Fein.    NHLBI Constituency Group Meets with Representative
Hoyer's Office  On behalf of the NHLBI Constituency Group, ALA/ATS of Maryland
volunteers met  with staff of Representative Hoyer to advocate for funding for
the NHLBI.  Attending the  meeting was Gerald Loughlin, president of the
Maryland Thoracic Society, and Anne  Eder and Sharon Gibbs of the ALA of
Maryland.

<H3>PRESIDENT'S VA/EPA BUDGET</H3>
<P>Last week, the Administration released the President's request for FY97
funding for the  EPA and VA.  The President requested the following for air
related programs at EPA: <BR>
</P>
<PRE>	Clean Air EPM Programs				$304.4
       	Air Research and Regulatory Programs		 152.2
       	Radiation EPM Programs				  20.4

       	EPA/NIEHS Superfund Research			  42.5
       	Environmental Justice				   3.4
</PRE>
<P>The President recommended $7.061 billion for total EPA operations.<BR><BR>The
President also submitted his request for the VA program.  Included in that
request  was $257 million for VA medical and prosthetic research programs.  This
represents  level funding from the recommendation in the House/Senate FY96
VA-HUD Appropriation  Conference Report. 
</P>
<H3>ERRATA RE: NIH INCREASE</H3>
<P>Last week's Washington Letter incorrectly reported the level of increase
presented  in President Clinton's budget for NIH.  The reported increase was
$496 million.   The <B>CORRECT</B> figure is <B>$467 million</B>.  The
Washington Letter also  reported that $274 million was targeted for the clinical
center.  The <B>CORRECT</B>  figure is <B>$287 million</B>.  The source of
these errors was a difference in  baseline assumptions in the President's budget
document.   </P>
<H3>ATS LEADERSHIP MEETS WITH DR. OLDEN OF NIEHS </H3>
<P>Dr. Hudson and ATS staff met with Dr. Olden, Director of NIEHS to discuss 
developing stronger relations between the ATS and NIEHS.  Topics discussed 
included; having NIEHS hold sessions/presentations at future ALA/ATS
International  Conferences, developing a constituency lobby group for NIEHS,
funding prospects for  NIEHS, the role of the NIH clinical center, and Superfund
 research funding. 
</P>
<H3>HOUSE APPROPRIATIONS HEARINGS </H3>
<P>Due to last minute negotiations on the FY96 Omnibus Continuing Resolution,
NIH  hearings before the House L-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee were canceled
last  week.  Hearings will be rescheduled after the Easter/Passover ecess. 
</P>
<H3>HOUSE PASSES HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM WITH MALPRACTICE AND MSAs</H3>
<P>House GOP leaders agreed to add medical malpractice reform, tax-free medical
 savings accounts (MSA) and state regulatory exemptions to health insurance
reform  legislation.  Republican members saw this bill as the best opportunity
to enact  these provisions.  <BR><BR> The malpractice provisions would limit
non-economic damages to $250,000 and ould  limit punitive awards to $250,000 or
three times non-economic damages, whichever  is greater.<BR><BR> Not included
in the bill were AMA supported items such as CLIA reform and  anti-trust
exemptions for physician-sponsored managed care organizations.   The House
passed H.R. 3103 before recessing for the Easter/Passover break.   The Senate is
scheduled to considered a narrower health care reform proposal  after the
Easter/Passover recess.  MEDICAID NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUENational Governors 
Association and GOP Hill staffers continue to meet on a Medicaid reform plan, 
although they are having trouble getting budget scoring for the proposal.  
Staff are also working on a welfare proposal which will eventually be attached 
to the Medicaid proposal.  The GOP has linked the two issues believing that 
separating them would play into the hands of the Clinton administration, which 
would embrace the less controversial welfare plan and reject the Medicaid 
initiative.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) said the ultimate aim was to 
send a bill to the White House by late April or early May.<BR><BR>

<H3>NIH &amp; CDC RECEIVE SMALL INCREASES IN PRESIDENT'S FY97 BUDGET</H3>
<P>The President's budget requests $12.435 billion (+$496 million) for the FY97
NIH  budget.  Although this represents nearly a +4% increase, the majority of
the  increase ($274 million) would be used to fund construction/renovation of
the NIH  clinical center.  Institutes of interest to the ATS/ALA received the
following  non-AIDS funding recommendations: NHLBI $1.321 billion (+22.614
million), NIAID  $583.933 million (+10.323 million) and NIEHS $289.114 (+6.267).
 By contrast,  the Office of AIDS Research budget request was $1.432 billion, an
increase of  approximately $24 million.<BR><BR>  The President requested
$2.343 billion for the CDC.  This is an increase of $229  million.  Due to
differing baseline assumptions in the President's budget request,  information
on specific CDC programs is not yet available. 
</P>
<H3>TB BLOCK GRANT PROPOSAL PART OF PRESIDENT'S BUDGET DOCUMENT</H3>
<P>The President's budget proposes to block grant 32 categorical programs into
four  grant programs, HIV grant, STD/TB grant, Chronic Disease and Disability
Prevention  grant and an Immunization grant.  Last year's Administration
proposal had combined  HIV with the STD/TB block grant.<BR><BR>  Although the
President's proposal is cause for concern and continued monitoring,  as of yet,
the Administration's block grant proposal has not received support from  key
Congressional leaders. 
</P>
<H3>ATS LEADERSHIP MEETS WITH DR. LENFANT OF NHLBI</H3>
<P>This week, Dr. Hudson, Dr. Crapo and ATS/ALA staff met with NHLBI Director, 
Dr. Lenfant, to discuss ATS/ALA support for the Institute.  Topics discussed 
included, FY97 Appropriations, FY98 Appropriations, NIH reauthorization, SCORs, 
NHLBI health education programs and the 1% budget transfer authority.  A similar
 meeting with NIEHS Director, Dr.  Olden, is scheduled for next week. 
</P>
<H3>HOUSE APPROPRIATIONS SUBCOMMITTEES HOLD HEARINGS ON FY97 BILLS</H3>
<P>Health and Human Services Department Secretary, Donna Shalala, is scheduled
to  testify before the House L-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee on Wednesday,
March 27.   Secretary Shalala will present details and highlights of the 
President's budget.   NIH Director, Dr. Varmus, will also testify on Wednesday
regarding the NIH budget.   On Thursday, March 28 Institute Directors of NCI,
NHLBI, NIDDK and NIDR will  testify before the committee.  Other Institute
Directors are scheduled to appear  before the subcommittee in April.<BR><BR> 
Department of Veteran's Affairs Secretary, Jessie Brown, will be testifying
before  the House VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee on Thursday, March 28. 
Additional  VA-HUD hearings are scheduled for April 23. 
</P>
<H3>LOBBYING ACTIVITIES</H3>
<MENU></MENU>
<P><B>Budget Committee Visits</B>ATS/ALA staff met with staff of Senator Frist
 (R-TN), Senator Hollings (D-SC), and the Senate Budget Majority Committee to
advocate  for increased funding for budget function 550. As you may recall, the
House and  Senate Budget Committees divide all federal spending into
approximately 20 budget  functions.  The amount of money allocated to these
functions determines the amount  of funds appropriations committees have to
spend on programs within their  jurisdiction.  The health budget function 550
encompasses nearly all the federal  government's spending on health programs
(AHCPR, NIH, CDC, Medicaid...) with the  exception of Medicare and
federal/military employees health benefits.  Unless  increased funds are
allocated to budget function  550, increases in health programs  are in
jeopardy.<BR><BR> 
<B>NHLBI Constituency Group Lobby Days</B>The NHLBI Constituency Group, a
coalitions  of voluntary health groups who support research at the NHLBI, are
planning visits  with members of the House and Senate L-HHS Appropriations
Committee to advocate for  increase NHLBI funding.  These meetings are expected
to occur in the first two weeks  of April.  Local ALA volunteers and ATS members
are encouraged to participate. <BR><BR>  The NHLBI Constituency Group has
scheduled a  Washington, D. C. lobby day for  April 25.  ALA volunteers and ATS
members from districts/states of L-HHS Appropriations  Subcommittee members are
invited to come to D. C. to participate in the event. 
</P>
<H3>HOUSE COMMITTEES CONTINUE WORK ON HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM</H3>
<P>This week the last of the four House committees working on health insurance
reform  completed their work by passing legislation similar to the Senate's
Kassebaum/Kennedy  bill.  The four House committees which share jurisdiction
over health insurance  reform include Ways and Means, Commerce, Economic and
Educational Opportunities,  and Judiciary.  The four bills will be rolled into
one bill and voted on by the  full House in the next few weeks.  The House and
Senate bills are similar in many  respects, but differ on such points as group
to individual coverage portability,  health insurance deductibility for the
self-employed and medical savings accounts. 
<BR><BR>As for the Senate bill (S 1028), Sen. Kassebaum mentioned this week
that  she will allow amendments to be considered to her bill, but will vote
against any  and all amendments including the much publicized Jefford's
amendment which raises  lifetime insurance caps from $1 million to $10 million. 
Sen. Kassebaum believes  any amendments added to the bill will endanger its
final passage.  For many of the  same reasons, Sen. Kassebaum stated that
provisions currently in the House version  of the bill, which were not included
in the Senate bill, should be considered at  another time.<BR><BR>

<H2>Welcome to New Orleans<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1">'Let the good times roll' as the International Conference kicks
off</FONT></H2> 
<P>The world's largest lung-related conference begins today with an 
educational and scientific program covering some of the latest and most 
significant developments in clinical and basic research and public health 
education.</P> 
<P>More than 300 scientific and clinical symposia have been planned for the 
five-day meeting. And more than 10,000 pulmonary, critical care and 
occupational medicine clinicians, scientists, nurses, therapists and health 
educators from around the world are expected to gather here this week.</P> 
<P>Session topics include managed care, tobacco control, asthma, lung 
reduction surgery, clinical and basic science of lung development, gene 
expression, tuberculosis, environmental health, lung transplantation,  critical
care medicine, sleep apnea and lung health in diverse communities.</P> 
<P>As always, the conference offers the opportunity to meet and network  with
colleagues and friends from around the world.</P> 
<P>And, of course, there is the unique setting for this conference. No  other
city has such a distinct local culture as New Orleans. The food and  music are
unequaled anywhere, and the native architecture, with its lacy  iron grillwork
and pastel colors combine with lush banana and palm trees to  create a vision of
languid, subtropical splendor.</P>

<H2>ALA/ATS launch Asthma Research Initiative</H2> 
<P>The American Lung Association and its medical section, the American 
Thoracic Society, have created the Asthma Research Initiative, launching an 
intensive nationwide research campaign to study the causes and search for  the
ultimate cure for asthma.</P> 
<P>To achieve this goal, the initiative will fund the establishment of 
National Asthma Centers to focus on basic biological research into the  causes
of asthma. These will be &quot;centers without walls,&quot; which will include 
research conducted within various hospitals, universities and medical 
facilities, as well as collaborative efforts among them.</P> 
<P>Also, the initiative will establish Regional Asthma Centers to focus on  the
translation of the results of basic research into clinical applications.   These
will also be without walls, involving institutions where many asthma  patients
are seen.</P> 
<P>Early initiative gifts, totaling nearly $4 million, from local Lung 
Associations, the ALA Board, Council and Senior Management, as well as the  ATS
Board, have been received thus far.</P> 
<P>ATS members and ALA donors alike favor increased research funding. The 
Asthma Research Initiative will ensure that research is given the priority 
status it deserves, and this will be reflected in more successful  fundraising.
The results will be plentiful with increased revenue to meet  our mission, a
stronger ALA and ATS, and, of course, with more lives saved  -- our ultimate
goal.</P>

<H2>Cigarette smoking, gender and race<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Women suffer greater lung damage and African-Americans recover
slower after smoking cessation</FONT></H2> 
<P>Compared to men, women generally have smaller lung capacity. Because of 
this, women who smoke cigarettes lose proportionately more lung function  than
men. In addition, African-Americans appear to recover lost lung  function more
slowly after they give up smoking. 
</P>
<P>Those are among the findings of research to be presented in a poster session
 (A43) on Sunday, 8:15-11:30 a.m. in Area H in the Exhibit Hall. The title of 
the poster is &quot;Further Investigation of Effects of Cigarette Smoking and 
Smoking Cessation on Lung Function.&quot; The study was conducted by Henry 
Glindmeyer, DEngr, John Lefante, PhD, and their colleagues at the Section  of
Environmental Medicine, Tulane University School of Medicine.</P> 
<P>&quot;The bottom line is that while we seem to be targeting current
anti-smoking  efforts at young men, the real problem in the future is going to
be with  young women -- specifically minorities -- who become cigarette smokers,&quot;
Dr.  Glindmeyer said.</P> 
<P>The research study follows up an earlier one involving more than 2,900 
current and ex-smoking black and white men and women. That study found 
comparable reductions in lung function between races (comparing white men  and
black men), and that white women were more adversely affected by  smoking than
white men. Also, the study found that smoking cessation can  result in recovery
of lost lung function.</P> 
<P>To increase statistical significance, the follow-up study involved a  larger
population -- 18,744 white men, 3,967 white women, 3,693 black men  and 1,564
black women. Multiple linear regressions of observed lung  function were
conducted on age (year), age 2, height, packs of cigarettes  times number of
years smoked (PY), number of years stopped smoking (YS),  and occupational
exposure.</P> 
<P>&quot;Looking at pack-years, we found that the lung function for white men 
declined about .0069 liters per PY,&quot; Dr. Glindmeyer said. &quot;The lung 
function for white women declined basically the same -- .0061 liters per  PY.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Even though both are losing the same amount of lung function for the 
same pack-years smoked, women have significantly smaller lungs to begin  with,&quot;
he added. &quot;So their lungs are actually being compromised at a  quicker
rate.&quot;</P> 
<P>He noted the study also found that compared to whites, African-American  men
and women suffered similar rates of decline per PY, but that  African-Americans
appear to recover less from smoking cessation, though  these later results were
not significant.</P> 
<P>In an associated study, the researchers also looked at gender differences 
in reactions to other chemical irritant exposure. Exposure to irritants was 
self-reported.</P> 
<P>They found that men and women who were not exposed to irritants during  the
study period developed adult-onset asthma at approximately the same  rate.</P> 
<P>However, among men and women who had been exposed to irritants, women 
developed adult-onset asthma at a rate four times that of men.</P> 
<P>And this is in light of the fact that the women in the study were  exposed
for shorter periods of time than the men, Dr. Glindmeyer said.</P> 
<P>These results suggest that women and African-Americans are at greater  risk
from cigarette smoking, and we need to focus anti-smoking campaigns 
specifically at girls, young women and minorities, he concluded.</P>

<H2>Study shows antioxidants may lessen effects of ozone</H2> 
<P>Supplementation of the diet with a regimen of vitamins E and C may help 
asthmatics cope with ambient air pollution changes. &quot;These findings are 
especially relevant considering the rising rates of asthma in the world,&quot; 
said Carol Trenga, MS.</P> 
<P>That research will be presented in a thematic poster session (B37) 
8:15-11:30 a.m. Monday in Area D of the Exhibit Hall in the convention  center.
Trenga, a doctoral candidate, and her colleagues at the Department  of
Environmental Health, University of Washington, Seattle, conducted a  study
examining nutritional status and susceptibility to toxicant damage  caused by
two common air pollutants, ozone (O3) and sulfur dioxide (SO2).</P> 
<P>The double-blind crossover protocol evaluated whether daily intake of a 
combined vitamin E (400 IU) and vitamin C (500 mg) regimen can mitigate or 
prevent O3-induced bronchial hyperresponsive-ness in adults with asthma.</P> 
<P>The session will report on year one of a two-year study. Subjects were 
tested with exposures to one concentration of O3 (0.12) ppm) or air for 45 
minutes during intermittent moderate exercise on a treadmill. Pulmonary 
function changes were assessed before and after, followed by two  consecutive
10-minute SO2 (0.1 and 0.25 ppm) inhalation challenges.</P> 
<P>&quot;O3 subjects had a smaller mean drop in FEV1 (0.068 L) when taking the 
vitamin regimen than after the placebo regimen (0.280 L),&quot; Trenga said.  &quot;These
results, while not statistically significant,  show that supplementation  of the
diet with vitamins E and C may help asthmatic adults cope with  ambient air
pollution challenges.&quot;</P> 
<P>Another interesting finding, she noted, was the highly varied response 
among the participants to sulfur dioxide. The study involved asthmatics  with
varying degrees of disease severity.</P> 
<P>&quot;Based on our eligibility screening, we&#146;re finding that not
everyone  with moderate to severe asthma is sensitive to SO2. Whereas many with
mild  asthma are sensitive to SO2,&quot; Trenga said.</P> 
<P>While the primary hypothesis was that the vitamin regimen would lessen  the
effects of ozone in asthmatics, a secondary  hypothesis concerned the  levels of
antioxidants in an individual&#146;s diet, according to Trenga.  Vitamin intake
was verified by serum assays, and dietary habits were  monitored by food
frequency questionnaires.</P> 
<P>&quot;We&#146;re investigating whether or not these levels correlate with a 
person&#146;s susceptibility to ozone-induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness, or 
to their response to sulfur dioxide at the screening visit,&quot; she said.</P> 
<P>In addition to vitamins E and C, she noted, they are studying retinol  and
beta-carotenes.</P> 
<P>&quot;We&#146;re also looking at other carotenoid compounds that are strong 
antioxidants, like lycopene, but do not have any pro-vitamin A activity,  Trenga
said.</P> 
<P>Trenga and her colleagues are currently in the middle of the second year  of
the research, which will involve a larger study population. Data  collection
will be concluded this summer, at which time the randomization  code for the
second year will be revealed and the data analysis completed.</P>

<H2>Scientific, educational program offers something for everyone</H2> 
<P>A &quot;smorgasbord&quot; of scientific and educational offerings await
attendees  at this week&#146;s ALA/ATS 1996 International Conference.</P> 
<P>William J. Martin, II, MD, chairman of the International Conference 
Committee, said the program offers something for every health professional  in
pulmonary, critical care and occupational medicine.</P> 
<P>The committee reviewed more than 5,000 abstracts for the 1996 conference.</P>
<P>&quot;Each year the number of abstracts continues to increase,&quot; Dr.
Martin  said.</P> 
<P>This year&#146;s program is unique in that it was completed for the most
part  via telephone. The committee had been scheduled to meet in New York in 
January to finalize the program, when the &quot;Blizzard of &#146;96&quot;
struck the east  coast.</P> 
<P>&quot;Only a handful of the committee chairs and co-chairs were able to make
 it, so overnight we devised a plan to do everything by conference call,&quot; 
Dr. Martin said. &quot;It is a great credit to the committee that we were able 
to review and organize all of those abstracts over the phone.&quot;</P> 
<P>Dr. Martin cited some highlights of the 1996 scientific and educational 
program:</P> 
<UL>
<LI>Sunday afternoon&#146;s Amberson Lecture, presented by Peter J. Barnes, DM,
Dsc, FRCP, on &quot;Molecular Mechanisms of Asthma: Order Now Emerging from
Chaos.&quot;
</LI>
<LI>Tuesday&#146;s ATS President&#146;s Lecture, presented by Bernard Lo, MD,
on &quot;Responding to Ethical Dilemmas in Managed Care.&quot;
</LI>
<LI>A comprehensive and diverse clinical track focusing on the needs
of	clinicians, featuring the Master Clinician series on Sunday and Monday, a
workshop on CPT coding for pulmonary medicine on Sunday afternoon, and much
more.
</LI>
<LI>Evening Forums, new this year, beginning Sunday.
</LI>
<LI>The Exhibit Hall, featuring hundreds of exhibits offering attendees the
opportunity to review new products, technology, publications and more. 
</LI>
<LI>Monday&#146;s Luncheon for Underrepresented Minority ATS Members and
Conference Attendees (from the United States).
</LI>
<LI>Tuesday&#146;s Luncheon for Women Attending the ALA/ATS International
Conference.
</LI>
<LI>The ALA Sunrise Sessions beginning Sunday morning
</LI>
<LI>A variety of special sessions, such as Sunday evening&#146;s forum on &quot;Results
of the NHLBI National Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Registry&quot; and Monday afternoon&#146;s
&quot;NIAID Inner City Asthma Update 1996.,&quot; 
</LI> 
</UL>
<P>Dr. Martin&#146;s message to those newcomers to the ALA/ATS International 
Conference: Relax. No one can possibly do or see it all, he said.</P> 
<P>The program can be overwhelming, he cautioned. Its diverse and wonderful, 
but huge.</P> 
<P>Just relax and enjoy the process, and don&#146;t worry if you cant attend 
every session or symposia you desire.</P>

<H2>Aerobic fitness may be key to survival for adolescents with cystic fibrosis</H2>
<P>One reason why male adolescents with cystic fibrosis survive longer than 
female adolescents with the disease may be the difference in aerobic fitness 
between the two sexes, according to research to be presented Sunday.</P> 
<P>&quot;Aerobic Fitness May Contribute to Survival Differences in Children
with  Cystic Fibrosis&quot; is the title of a poster session (A38) to be
presented  from 8:15-11:30 a.m. Sunday in Area A of the Exhibit Hall.</P> 
<P>To determine what factors may contribute to this survival differential, 
Jose P. Gutierrez, MD, and his colleagues at the Department of Thoracic 
Medicine, Royal Children&#146;s Hospital, Victoria, Australia, examined the 
relationship between gender and peak VO2. Eighty-one adolescents with  cystic
fibrosis were studied, with measurements taken of their lung  function,
nutritional status and peak VO2 during exercise.</P> 
<P>&quot;In boys, there was a clear relationship between FEV1 and peak VO2,&quot;
Dr.  Gutierrez said. &quot;This was not evident in girls.&quot;</P> 
<P>They concluded that peak VO2 is independent of FEV1, and that the 
difference in aerobic fitness may contribute to the survival differential.</P>

<H2>More women dying from obstructive lung disease</H2> 
<P>While mortality rates from obstructive lung disease have declined  slightly
among men, mortality rates have risen sharply among women. These  mortality
trends will be presented Monday in a thematic poster session titled  &quot;Obstructive
Lung Disease Deaths in the United States from 1979 Through 1992:  An Analysis
Using Multiple-Cause Mortality Data.&quot; The data will be presented  from 8:15
-11:30 a.m. in Area G of the Exhibit Hall.</P> 
<P>In the study, David M. Mannino, MD, and his colleagues at the Centers for 
Disease Control reviewed death certificate reports in the multiple-cause 
mortality files compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics. Of  the
more than 29 million decedents in the study period, 2.3 million, or 
approximately 8 percent, had a diagnosis of obstructive lung disease listed  on
their death certificates. And about 1 million of those 2.3 million  decedents
had obstructive lung disease listed as the underlying cause of  death.</P> 
<P>Some findings of the study:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The age-adjusted mortality rate increased 39 percent from 1979 to 1992.
</LI>
<LI>The age-adjusted mortality rate increased 16.1 percent among men from 1979
to 1988, then decreased 3.3 percent  from 1988 to 1992.
</LI>
<LI>The age-adjusted mortality rate increased 107.8 percent among women from
1979 to 1992.
</LI>
<LI>White males had the highest mortality rates, followed by black males, males
of other races, white females, black females and females of other races.
</LI>
<LI>Obstructive lung disease was present in more than 8 percent of all deaths.
</LI> 
</UL>
<P>&quot;The decline in mortality rates among men and the increase among women 
reflect historical smoking trends in these populations,&quot; Dr. Mannino said.</P>

<FONT SIZE="+1">They&#146;re the strategy to meet the goals of the new ALA/ATS
Asthma Research Initiative</FONT></H2> 
<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" SRC="images/5krun2.jpg">
<P>This is an exciting time for the American Lung Association and the  American
Thoracic Society.</P> 
<P>ALA/ATS has adopted and is implementing an ambitious nationwide strategic 
plan that includes a commitment to a new programmatic emphasis on asthma, to 
building a larger corps of volunteers, to increasing funding for research  and
to diversifying and expanding fund-raising efforts. The Asthma Research 
Initiative embodies all the elements of the strategic plan.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<HR>
<P><I><B>Running for lung health</B> - Early risers turned out Sunday morning
for  the ALA/ATS 5K Lung Run and Walk.  Among the participants was Mary Pierce, 
(right) from St. Joseph, Mich., a double lung transplant patient who  completed
the 5K walk.</I>
</P>
<HR>
<P>To achieve the first goal, the Initiative will fund the establishment of 
National Asthma Centers. These will not be physical centers built of bricks  and
mortar. Each center will be a collaborative research unit focusing on  basic
biological research. The association&#146;s initial request for applications  to
the scientific community to participate in this &quot;Scientific clearing  house&quot;
yielded 21 proposals that Norman Edelman, MD, ALA Scientific  Consultant and
dean of SUNY-Stony Broom Medical School, called &quot;a dazzling  array of
brilliant science.&quot;</P> 
<P>Over the next few years and into the next century, the centers will become 
equipped to undertake even greater, systematic and larger-scale studies.   Each
center is expected to receive initial funding of $250,000 to $500,000 a  year
for five years, a total of from $1.25 million to $3.75 million per  center.</P> 
<P>The second goal will be pursued by establishing Regional Asthma Centers. 
These multi-site collaborative programs will focus on clinical application  with
broad therapeutic trials in populations drawn from national bases to  meet
selected criteria. Each regional center will be linked to a national  center to
facilitate the rapid transfer of promising treatments from bench  to bedside.
Regional centers will also be encouraged to work with the Lung  Associations in
their area to coordinate asthma education programs for the  community,
physicians and asthma patients and their families.</P> 
<P>The financial goal of the Asthma Research Initiative is $25 million -- a 
modest figure compared to the $9.5 billion that represents asthma&#146;s annual 
cost to our country. Money raised will serve as seed money to stimulate  further
investment in the initiative from the private, nongovernmental  sector, as well
as from public sources such as the National Heart, Lung and  Blood Institute,
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,  and the
Environmental Protection Agency.</P> 
<P>There will also be a provision for unstructured, speculative exploration  of
new, untried approaches that do not fit neatly into more directed areas  of the
initiative. While investigators in the national centers will be  expected to
demonstrate suitable backgrounds in the fields of pulmonary,  immunologic and
asthma research, scientists outside the field who can offer  fresh and valuable
insights will also be welcome to apply for grants.</P> 
<P>All research projects will be rigorously peer reviewed. The granting 
process for the National Asthma Centers is highly leveraged. Principal 
investigators and their collaborators must bring a substantial amount of 
additional peer-reviewed funding to the project. The provision for this 
nontraditional inquiry will ensure that no avenue in the quest for the cause 
and cure of asthma will remain unexplored.</P>

<H2>Putting the pieces together<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Amberson lecturer points to NF-kB as key to asthma</FONT></H2> 
<P>The transcription factor NF-KB appears to play a pivotal role in asthma,  a
fact that ties together much of what we already know about the disease,  said
Peter J. Barnes, DM, DSc, FRCP, who presented the 1996 Amberson Lecture  on
Sunday.</P> 
<P>Dr. Barnes is chair of the Department of Thoracic Medicine at the  National
Heart and Lung Institute, London, England. His research focuses on  the
inflammatory mechanisms involved in asthma and the molecular mechanisms  of
action of anti-asthma drugs. He spoke on &quot;Molecular Mechanisms of Asthma: 
Order Now Emerging From Chaos.&quot;</P> 
<P>&quot;We believe that NF-KB might be very important in asthma because it 
controls many of the inflammatory genes that are abnormally expressed in  this
condition,&quot; Dr. Barnes said.</P> 
<P>NF-KB is a transcription factor, a DNA-binding protein, that binds to 
certain responsive genes and increases their expression.</P> 
<P>&quot;The paradigm of NF-KB is that inflammatory signals activate 
transcription factors, and then this will lead to switching on of  inflammatory
genes, which will lead to the increased expression of  inflammatory proteins,&quot;
he said.</P> 
<P>This ties together many previously unrelated observations about asthma,  he
noted, because many of the things that we now know will make asthma worse  will
activate NF-KB, including the production of inflammatory cytokines that  may
occur after allergen challenge.</P> 
<P>&quot;All of these triggers activate NF-KB, which switches on the production
 of a number of inflammatory genes,&quot; he noted.</P> 
<P>Yet asthma is not chronic bronchitis, he said, so there have to be some 
differences that could explain why some inflammatory diseases only involve 
expression of some inflammatory proteins.</P> 
<P>&quot;We think the differences can be explained by the fact that under
certain  circumstances, activation of NF-KB doesn't give complete expression of
the  gene, while a second transcription factor may have almost no effect on the 
gene expression,&quot; he said. &quot;But when you combine these two
transcription  factors, you have an enormous synergy giving a full expression of
the gene.&quot;</P> 
<P>Yet while NF-KB appears to play a pivotal role in asthma, Dr. Barnes  said,
it is important to remain humble.</P> 
<P>&quot;Any hypothesis that accounts for all known facts is almost certainly 
incorrect, since most known facts are wrong,&quot; he said.</P> 
<P>&quot;One of the things that convinces me that this theory is right, is that
 glucocorticoids are extremely potent inhibitors of NF-KB, and we believe  that
their main anti-inflammatory action in asthma may be the direct  inhibition of
this transcription factor.</P>

<H2>Study finds peak flow meters useful for detecting COPD</H2> 
<P>A study by researchers at Emory University School of Medicine found peak 
flow meters to be useful for early detection of chronic obstructive  pulmonary
disease (COPD). Samuel M. Aguayo, MD, and colleagues presented  their findings
during a poster discussion session on Sunday.</P> 
<P>Early detection of COPD could theoretically improve patient outcomes, 
because patients who are susceptible to developing COPD are also more likely  to
die from other smoking-related diseases such as lung cancer,  cardiovascular
disease and stroke.</P> 
<P>&quot;If this study can be validated in different clinical settings, it may 
change the algorithm that is currently used to manage smoking-related  disease,&quot;
said Dr. Aguayo. &quot;We don&#146;t have the resources to treat every  smoker
as though they will suffer all of the known smoking-related diseases,  so we
need to be selective in who needs aggressive screening and expensive  cessation
programs.&quot;</P> 
<P>Dr. Aguayo and colleagues examined whether portable peak expiratory flow 
(PEF) meters could be used for screening in early detection of COPD.  Currently,
COPD is only measured with spirometry, which is expensive and  requires a highly
trained technician. These factors limit its usefulness as  a screening test.  By
retrospect-ively examining the correlations between PEF and FEV1/FVC in  200
random patients tested, Dr. Aguayo and colleagues selected PEF &lt;80  percent
of predicted as the cutoff value. The expected sensitivity and  specificity for
detecting COPD was then 93 percent and 79 percent,  respectively. Testing 51
adult patients, a sensitivity of 91 percent and  specificity of 77 percent was
obtained.</P> 
<P>While Dr. Aguayo cautioned that the tested population was made up of  adult
patients with a high prevalence of COPD and further studies need to be  done.</P>
<P>He also noted that the test could become a sensitive, cost-effective tool 
for identifying smokers who should be tested with spirometry for early 
detection of COPD, thus allowing the physician to more effectively utilize 
available resources for disease prevention and intervention.</P>

<H2>Asthma on the rise in urban areas</H2> 
<P>The prevalence of asthma is increasing, especially among minority  children
in poor inner city communities. For example, African American  children are
almost twice as likely to have asthma as white children, and  the death rate for
asthma among African Americans is three times higher than  the rate among
persons of European descent, according to Linda B. Ford, MD,  Papillon, NE,
chair of Sunday&#146;s symposium, &quot;Meeting the Challenge of  Reducing
Asthma Morbidity in the Inner Cities.&quot;</P> 
<P>Studies have identified a number of factors associated with increased  risk
factors for asthma in urban environments. &quot;Historically, increasing 
morbidity and mortality has been associated with both overtreatment and 
undertreatment,&quot; Dr. Ford said. &quot;Certainly, poor people living in the
inner  cities are not being overtreated.&quot; Limited access to preventive care
and a  tendency to rely on home remedies or over-the-counter medications
contribute  to undertreatment, and often, no treatment at all. Black and
Hispanic  children, for example, are less likely to be taking anti-inflammatory 
medication, according to a number of studies.</P> 
<P>The physical environment of the inner city plays a significant role in  the
prevalence of asthma among inner city residents. &quot;We talk a lot about 
environmental controls,&quot; Dr. Ford said. &quot;But the allergens often found
in  inner city homes are out of control.&quot; Studies have found that only 61 
percent of these households even own a vacuum and more than half are  infested
with cockroaches, mice, or rats -- all major contributors to the  allergen
problems in these homes.</P> 
<P>The urban environments, especially in the nation&#146;s largest cities, &quot;has
 changed dramatically in recent decades,&quot; said David Lang, MD,
Philadelphia,  one of the symposium participants. &quot;These changes are
directly associated  with increasing asthma.&quot; A study conducted by Dr. Lang
and his colleagues  looked at asthma-related mortality and morbidity rates from
1969-94. They  found that mortality rates steadily declined into the 1970s,
began to rise  in 1978, and have continued to rise through the 1980s and into
the 1990s.</P> 
<P>Many people assume that ambient pollutants affecting air quality have 
significantly contributed to these increases but, Dr. Lang found, the air 
quality actually improved over the course of the study, implying that  certain
social and cultural factors may be contributing to the increasing  prevalence of
asthma in urban areas. Poverty may be the number one risk  factor for asthma.</P>
<P>&quot;The indoor environment has changed as well,&quot; Dr. Lang said.
Unsanitary  conditions combined with the fact that urban residents may spend up
to 20  hours a day indoors, create an environment where risk factors for asthma
run  high.</P> 
<P>As with many of the health problems facing society today, education and 
prevention are the keys to controlling asthma in the inner city.</P> 
<P>The barriers to optimal asthma care need to be identified and addressed, 
Dr. Lang said. The underprivileged in this country must be educated and they 
must have easy and equal access to health care.</P>

<H2>Molecular technology leads to advances in lung cancer diagnosis</H2> 
<P>Modern molecular techniques are dramatically changing the medical and 
scientific understanding of the biology of lung cancer. Knowledge gained  from
the molecular studies of lung cancer have led to the development of new 
diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. &quot;There have been many revolutionary 
advances developed through a variety of techniques -- some immunochemical,  some
molecular,&quot; said William D Travis, MD, Washington, DC, co-chair of 
Monday's symposium &quot;Recent Issues in Lung Cancer Diagnosis and Molecular 
Techniques.&quot;</P> 
<P>Dr. Travis, along with co-chair Thomas V. Colby, MD, Scottsdale, Ariz.,  and
several symposium participants representing clinical as well as research 
perspectives, reviewed recent issues in lung cancer diagnosis including 
problems in pathologic classification, utility of immunohistochemistry for 
diagnosis and molecular investigations, oncogenes and tumor suppressor  genes,
invasion and metastases, molecular applications to early detection,  and
therapeutic applications of molecular techniques.</P> 
<P>&quot;When we diagnose lung cancer, are we always sure that we're dealing
with  a lung carcinoma?&quot; asked Dr. Colby. &quot;There are often problems in
the  histologic classification of lung cancer. Histologic and cytologic
diagnoses  can often differ in distinguishing a carcinoma of the lung from other
 malignancies, benign tumors, and reactive processes.&quot; Dr. Colby feels
that,  in general, physicians do a good job in diagnosing lung cancer.  &quot;Subclassification
can be tricky, however,&quot; he added.</P> 
<P>Whether classified by routine light microscopy, ultrastructurally, 
immunohis-tochemically, or  by genetic abnormalities, several factors can 
contribute to classification confusion, including the size of the specimen,  the
application of inconsistent criteria, and the inherent problem of  heterogeneity
of lung cancer. &quot;We're talking about histologic variations in  lung cancer
from field to field and block to block,&quot; he said.</P> 
<P>Some of the more problematic lung tumors, with respect to classification, 
include neuroendocrine tumors, pleomorphic carcinoma, 
carcinosarcoma/sarcomatoid carcinoma, and basaloid carcinoma.</P> 
<P>&quot;In general, pathologic diagnosis of lung cancer is accurate,&quot; Dr.
Colby  said. &quot;Histologic subclassification of nonsmall cell carcinomas of
the lung,  on the other hand, is less accurate and can certainly be improved.&quot;</P>

<H2>Grassroots efforts can make a difference in the battle against the tobacco
industry</H2> 
<P>The tobacco industry is not invulnerable, and local efforts can make a 
difference. This was the message of Sunday&#146;s symposium on &quot;Public
Policy in  Tobacco Control in the Anti-Government Era.&quot;</P> 
<P>John Slade, MD, discussed public policy initiatives designed to stop 
teenage addiction to tobacco. While the anti-smoking forces are winning the 
public relations battles, the tobacco industry has, at least until recently, 
won most of the legal battles, Dr. Slade said. Organizers at the local level 
can help raise public consciousness by working to ban tobacco advertising on 
billboards, make pharmacies tobacco free, prohibit sales to minors, and 
encourage companies and organizations to break all ties with the tobacco 
industry.</P> 
<P>Stan Glantz, San Francisco, urged volunteers to use the good name of the 
American Lung Association to fight back at the tobacco industry. &quot;The 
tobacco industry knows that no one likes them, and everyone knows and  respects
the ALA,&quot; he said. &quot;The tobacco industry is very smart, very rich, 
very aggressive and they have a lot to lose. But you have the power to fight 
them.&quot;</P>

<H2>Research is a step-by-step process toward conquering lung disease</H2> 
<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" SRC="images/hartrate.jpg">
<P>Research is key to the mission of the American Lung Association -- to 
conquer lung disease. Thus, ALA volunteers need a better understanding of  and
appreciation for lung-related research.</P> 
<P>That was the message of the Saturday afternoon symposium &quot;Research 
Advances in Lung Disease: The Potential of the Discovery.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR><BR>
</P>
<HR>
<P><I><B>Cutting-edge research</B> - Poster sessions offer the opportunity to
 view the latest research conducted by young investigators from all over  the
world
</I>
</P>
<HR>
<P>&quot;We need to understand research and we need to bridge some of the gaps 
between the volunteers and the scientists,&quot; said Julie Fillenwarth,
co-chair  of the ALA Volunteer and Staff Development Committee and moderator for
the  session.</P> 
<P>John R. Garrison, ALA managing director, said the mission of the 
association has included support for research. &quot;The ALA research program
has  enabled talented investigators to develop experience, build skills and 
leverage outside support for lung research,&quot; he said. &quot;Historically,
the ALA  has wisely invested in the development of scientific careers which are 
focused on lung health and biology.&quot;</P> 
<P>Research is also one of the main thrusts of the ALA strategic plan, 
Garrison said.</P> 
<P>&quot;We want to increase the emphasis on research, including making more 
dollars available for it,&quot; he noted.</P> 
<P>Next year, ALA will be broadening it&#146;s research focus to include
tobacco  control as well as asthma. Also, for the first time,  ALA will offer a 
clinical research grant to address issues directly related to patient care, 
health services and ethical issues.</P> 
<P>Another major effort is the Asthma Research Initiative (see related  article
on page 1). &quot;The ARI focuses on the best research to uncover the  basic
mechanisms that are responsible for asthma,&quot; Garrison said. &quot;The 
initiative shows our ongoing commitment to research.&quot;</P> 
<P>Providing an overview of current research in lung disease was Leonard D. 
Hudson, MD, current ATS president. He pointed out that research is a process, 
with one study building upon knowledge and data from previous studies.</P> 
<P>&quot;Real breakthroughs are rare,&quot; he said. &quot;Usually research is
small steps  that requires repetition and confirmation.&quot;</P> 
<P>Achieving the goal of medical research -- to help patients -- requires a 
variety of types of research, Dr. Hudson said. Basic scientific research at  the
molecular and cellular level is crucial in achieving breakthroughs in  the
understanding of lung disease, he noted. Each new discovery about the  basic
biology of the lung is a building block that will ultimately lead to a  cure or
preventive measure for lung disease, Dr. Hudson said.</P>

<H2>ALA/ATS leaders discuss Conference highlights</H2> 
<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" SRC="images/ala-ats.jpg">
<P>ALA and ATS leaders held a press conference on Monday to discuss some of 
the highlights of this year's International Conference. &quot;More than 5,000 
abstracts were submitted this year, covering a wide range of cutting-edge 
research and important issues related to pulmonary and critical care,&quot; said
 Jackie McLeod, MPH, MEd, ALA president.</P> 
<P>Mrs. McLeod emphasized a number of sessions devoted to the ALA's  continuing
efforts to extend the exemption on the international ban on CFCs.  &quot;The ALA
is particularly concerned about the effect on people with lung  disease,&quot;
she said. &quot;We are also focusing on asthma and tobacco control, 
particularly the use of tobacco products by minors.&quot;</P> 
<P>The ALA/ATS International Conference is &quot;by far, the largest scientific
 meeting  devoted to pulmonary critical care issues in the world,&quot; said 
William Martin, MD, chairman of the Conference Committee. &quot;This is an 
opportunity for clinicians and researchers to see and discuss the latest in 
research and technology and get a good look at what's on the horizon.&quot;</P>
<P>Leonard Hudson, MD, ATS President, noted &quot;the overwhelming number of 
topics presented and the overall depth of this year's program. Some of the 
important issues we're looking at this year include the appropriate  withdrawal
of care, the diagnosis of pneumonia in critically ill patients,  and
alternatives to traditional ventilation, including some exciting new  research
into liquid ventilation.&quot;</P> 
<P>New developments in the treatment of infectious lung diseases is yet 
another important focus of this year's conference, according to ATS 
President-elect Philip Hopewell, MD. &quot;There are some really exciting 
sessions which look at the application of new molecular and cellular  technology
to tuberculosis -- a very old problem,&quot; he said. &quot;There is also a 
broad range of posters and sessions which focus on the affects of HIV  infection
on the lung.&quot;</P> 
<P>Overall, this year's Conference features a record number of sessions and  a
record number of attendees, underscoring the increasing importance of 
lung-related problems world.</P>

<H2>Lung reduction is last resort for emphysema</H2> 
<P>Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) -- a general term encompassing a 
variety of procedures -- was first performed in the 1950s, but was largely 
discontinued because the surgery resulted in significant morbidity and 
mortality rates. Recently, however, with advances in surgical tools and 
techniques, there has been a resurgence of interest in LVRS. Several  prominent
experts in the field gathered for a press conference Monday to  discuss the
current research and other issues surrounding LVRS, including  the new ATS
position paper on LVRS.</P> 
<P>One of the reports highlighted was a study conducted by researchers at 
Columbia University which looked at 69 patients who underwent LVRS over a 
13-month period. After an average follow-up time of 5.6 months, the  researchers
found that patients showed improvements in objective  lung-function measurements
of spirometry and exercise tolerance as well as  subjective measurements of
dyspnea, reported Byron Thomashow, MD, one of the  Columbia researchers.</P> 
<P>In another report, Mark Clark, MD, discussed the results of a University  of
Missouri study involving 49 LVRS patients. Dr. Clark and his colleagues  found
statistically significant improvement in lung function after six months.</P> 
<P>Richard Casaburi, MD, discussed the new ATS position paper on LVRS, which 
recognizes the increasing number of lung volume reduction surgeries with 
demonstrated benefit. But it also addresses a number of questions and issues 
related to the surgery's effectiveness. &quot;LVRS is not a cure, but it does 
show promise at reducing symptoms and improving the quality of life for  people
with severe emphysema,&quot; Dr. Casaburi noted. &quot;It should only be 
considered as a last resort for patients who have not been helped by other 
therapies.&quot;</P> 
<P>Dr. Casaburi said the ATS has urged that clinical trials be supported in 
order to address such questions as appropriate patient selection and  surgical
procedures of choice. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute  and Health
Care Financing Administration plan to issue a request for  proposals for a
multicenter clinical trial in the very near future.</P>

<H2>Physicians urged to play an active role in advocacy</H2> 
<P>We are at a point in time where increased commitment to advocacy is more 
important than ever,&quot; said Leonard D. Hudson, MD, Seattle, ATS president. 
Dr. Hudson and other ATS/ALA leaders were on hand Sunday evening to discuss 
federal health policies and how members can become more involved in  influencing
the formation of these policies. &quot;The ATS is fueling commitment  to our
members, encouraging them to take an active role in areas of health  policy.&quot;</P>
<P>Changes in the public insurance market, especially the growth of HMOs,  and
proposed changes in Medicare and Medicaid, are important areas that need  to be
addressed. The battles over these and other manifestations of the  evolving
health care environment are increasingly being fought at the state  level,
rather than the federal level, Dr. Hudson said. &quot;We must be  increasingly
active at state levels to ensure access to critical care and  pulmonary
specialty care providers.&quot;</P> 
<P>The ATS and the ALA are implementing programs to educate members on how  to
become active advocates for their professions.</P> 
<P>&quot;We will soon have our membership sorted by congressional districts and
 by areas of expertise,&quot; Dr. Hudson said. &quot;This will allow us, as
issues  arise, to target our efforts more effectively.&quot;</P> 
<P>Claude Lenfant, MD, Bethesda, Md., echoed Dr. Hudson's remarks, adding  that
the &quot;medical and scientific communities must join forces with the  general
public to guarantee budgets for important research.&quot; Dr. Lenfant  said the
future holds tremendous promise for the treatment of lung disease.  &quot;All we
have to do is seize them.&quot;</P> 
<P>James D. Crapo, MD, Durham, N.C., said medical professionals need to be 
educated on the political process.</P> 
<P>&quot;We know how to do science, but we don't know how to do politics. We
have  to learn that process,&quot; he said. &quot;The reason people don't get
involved is  not because they don't care. It's because they don't know what to
do -- they  feel powerless.&quot;</P> 
<P>Dr. Crapo pointed out that the rate of increase in funding from the NIH  for
the NHLBI is below the average.</P> 
<P>&quot;We are, however, still talking about increases rather than decreases, 
and that's positive,&quot; he said. &quot;Still, the bottom line is that we are
not  getting our message out effectively. More than half of the deaths under age
 one in this country are the result of lung disease, for example. But the  money
provided for research doesn't reflect the devastating effect that lung  disease
has on our nation's health as well as our economy.&quot;</P> 
<P>There will be no better time for medical professionals to become  proactive
in lobbying for continued and increased financial support for  research into
prevention and treatment of lung disease, Dr. Crapo said. &quot;We  are
currently receiving strong bipartisan support for NIH funding. We have  friends
on both sides of the aisle who support research and want to see  funding go up.
We need to take advantage of that. Even writing one letter to  one congressman
can make a difference.</P>

<H2>New ALA, ATS presidents see opportunities, challenges in the coming year</H2>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">'We need to be certain that we are responding<BR> to the
needs of our membership.' 	</FONT></P>
<DL><DD>Philip C. Hopewell, MD 	</DD>
<DD>ATS President 1996-1997 
<P>With the changing face of health care, and a number of other important 
issues facing the medical community, the incoming ATS president called his 
upcoming term  &quot;an intimidating responsibility.&quot;</P> 
<P>&quot;The organization and financial support of health care are changing in 
major ways, influencing the practice of all medical disciplines,&quot; said 
Philip C. Hopewell, MD, San Francisco, who will assume the presidency at 
today's ATS Membership Meeting. &quot;Our response to these changes, and the 
positions we take are extremely important -- perhaps as they have never been 
before.&quot;</P> 
<P>It is also important that ATS continue its strong advocacy for research, 
Dr. Hopewell said.</P> 
<P>&quot;It seems likely that there will be continued effort to decrease
federal  funding for research,&quot; he noted. &quot;It is important that we
develop a  coordinated strategy toward all funding resources.</P> 
<P>Member services is also important, Dr. Hopewell said.</P> 
<P>&quot;We need to be absolutely certain we are meeting the needs of our 
members, and that we have mechanisms in place for our members to communicate 
with our officers, and for our officers to communicate with our members in  an
effective and expeditious way,&quot; he said.</P> 
<P>&quot;The needs of our members are clearly what should be guiding us in the 
coming year.&quot;</P> 
<P>ATS must recognize that the needs of its members are changing, Dr.  Hopewell
said.</P> 
<P>&quot;We must be ready and able to respond to the changing health care 
environment, because that is what our members want and demand,&quot; he said.  &quot;Ensuring
that we have the mechanisms and framework in place to do this will  be one of
the important goals during the coming year.&quot;</P> 
<P>He also said it will be important to continue to examine and improve the 
relationship between ATS and ALA.</P> 
<P>&quot;We must make sure that this relationship is structured in a way to
best  meet our needs,&quot; he said.</P> 
<FONT SIZE="+1">'We need to put our emphasis on tobacco control where it is
needed most -- our young people.' 	</FONT></DD>
<DD>Thomas Gibson 	</DD>
<DD>ALA President 1996-1997 
<P>Thomas Gibson, Dunwoody, Ga., begins his term as ALA president after  having
recently undergone cardiac surgery.</P> 
<P>&quot;I'm recovering well, but because I have been 'out of the loop' for a
few  months, I am assuming this responsibility with a little more trepidation 
than I would have otherwise,&quot; he said in an interview prior to the 
International Conference.</P> 
<P>Even so, Gibson has been in the ALA &quot;loop&quot; for some time now. As a
 graduate student at the University of North Carolina, he received a 
scholarship from the North Carolina Tuberculosis Association and the  National
Tuberculosis Association, as the ALA was then known.</P> 
<P>&quot;That thousand dollars meant an awful lot to me, and I have had a soft 
spot in my heart for the American Lung Association ever since,&quot; Gibson
said.  His involvement in the Lung Association proceeded from the local to the 
state to the national level.</P> 
<P>As ALA president, Gibson said he wants to focus on resolving the issue 
surrounding the relationship between ALA and ATS.</P> 
<P>&quot;There has been such an inordinate amount of time and resources of both
 organizations taken up with this issue for some time now,&quot; he noted. &quot;It
is  time to resolve the issue, put it behind us and move ahead.&quot;</P> 
<P>It is his goal, he said, to facilitate resolution of this issue during  his
term as ALA president.</P> 
<P>Gibson also plans to focus his efforts on the two areas of emphasis 
identified by the ALA three-year strategic plan -- tobacco control and  asthma.</P>

<P>&quot;I feel very strongly about tobacco control, especially among young 
people,&quot; he said. &quot;There are all kinds of opportunities for us to make
an  impact.&quot;</P> 
<P>He stressed the importance of identifying young people who can be peer 
leaders in this effort.</P> 
<P>&quot;Young people respond best to young people, so we need to need to find 
peer leaders who can be involved with us now, in the planning stages of our 
tobacco control efforts,&quot; he said.</P> 
<P>ALA must also continue to be visible in promoting the recognition of  asthma
as a major public health problem. The Asthma Research Initiative is  an
important element in achieving the elements of the ALA strategic plan  calling
for a programmatic emphasis on asthma, he noted.</P> 
<P>As president, Gibson said he will call on all Lung Association volunteers 
to unite behind the mission and vision of the association.</P> 
<P>While we can have differing views, lets keep in mind that we are here to 
promote lung health and the control of lung disease, he said.</P>

<H2>Study examines the relationship between CPR duration and patient outcome</H2>
<P>Should cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) be conducted for more than 20 
minutes?</P> 
<P>That was the question behind a study conducted at Memorial Sloan-Kettering 
Cancer Center. Results of the study will be reported today in poster session 
B21, 1:30-4:15 p.m. in Area B in the Exhibit Hall. In the study, Rafael 
Barrera, MD, and his colleagues evaluated 240 patients at Syosset (N.Y.) 
Community Hospital who had received CPR. Sixty-six percent of the patients  were
males, with a mean age of 62 years.</P> 
<P>A total of 104 patients initially survived CPR but only 15 patients (6 
percent) were subsequently discharged from the hospital. Thirteen of those  15
patients received CPR for 10 minutes or less. Two survivors received CPR  for
11-20 minutes, and there were no survivors among those who received CPR  of more
than 20 minutes. The study concluded that there is a significant  relationship
between CPR duration and patient outcome.</P> 
<P>&quot;The majority of patients discharged alive from the hospital had a CPR 
lasting less than 10 minutes,&quot; Dr. Barrera said. &quot;CPR lasting more
than 20  minutes is associated with a negative outcome.&quot;</P>

<H2>ALA/ATS working to assure safe, easy transition to CFC-free MDIs</H2> 
<P>Currently in the United States, metered does inhalers rely upon 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as a propellant. Unfortunately, the production  and
use of CFCs have been banned by international treaty since Jan. 1,  1996.</P> 
<P>An essential-use exemption was granted for MDIs in 1996 and 1997,  however.
With that exemption running out, ALA and ATS are working with drug  companies
and manufacturers of chemicals for MDIs to ensure that sufficient  CFCs are
available until suitable CFC-free inhalers are ready for patient  use.</P> 
<P>Al Munzer, MD, reported on Monday that ALA/ATS, the International 
Pharmaceutical Aerosol Consortium and other groups are currently working to 
secure another exemption through 1999.</P> 
<P>&quot;CFC-free MDIs are currently available in 20 countries, but are not yet
 on the U.S. market,&quot; Dr. Munzer noted. &quot;Before the FDA will approve 
reformulated CFC-free products for patient use, they must undergo extensive 
testing and regulatory review to establish their safety, efficacy and  quality.&quot;</P>
<P>Maria Westfall, PhD, of 3M Pharmaceuticals, said the transition to  CFC-free
inhalers has been a challenge.</P> 
<P>&quot;It involves a lot more than substituting one propellant for another,&quot;
 she said. &quot;It has necessitated a major redesign and reinvention of the MDI
--  a task greater than we had expected.&quot;</P> 
<P>Fran DuMelle, ALA Deputy Managing Director, said ALA/ATS will strive to 
assure that the transition from current MDIs to the CFC-free versions will  be
as smooth and safe as possible for patients.</P>

<P>The Assemblies are the primary working groups of the American Thoracic
Society. Each Assembly holds an annual membership meeting at the International
Conference.</P>
<P>All members of the Assemblies and other interested individuals are invited
to attend.</P>
<P>These meetings are designed to provide the members with several
opportunities: 1) an update on the Assembly's projects; 2) input into the
Assembly's future directions; 3) hear the presiding chairman's message and
agenda for the coming year; and 4) to network with those colleagues you may have
missed at the sessions.</P>
<P>The meeting agenda also includes the elections by the members of the
Assembly Officers for the 1997-98 term.</P>

<P>A government's decisions directly affect the lung health of its citizens. In
the United States, those decisions range from  setting air quality standards to
protecting children with asthma to reforming the health care delivery system so
that patients have  access to specialty care. Vice President Albert Gore has
been invited to speak at the Opening Session of this International  Conference
to address the role of government in protecting the health of its people.  Mr.
Gore has been a champion of the environment,  a key player in the
Administration's decision to shield children from the hazards of smoking and has
seen the impact of  lung disease on members of his own family. He will challenge
International Conference participants to work with their own  governments to
carry the public policy battle against lung disease well into the new century.
</P>
<P>This stimulating keynote address, along with special entertainment, will be
an exciting beginning to the 1997  International Conference.  Join us!</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>OBJECTIVES</B><BR>At the conclusion of this course, the participant
will be able to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>describe various manifestations and clinical problems associated with
pulmonary and systemic sarcoidosis in the overall patients;</LI>
<LI>relate race and population differences to clinical manifestations of
sarcoidosis;</LI>
<LI>understand current concepts in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis and assess

<LI>choose the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for the
affected patient;
</LI>
<LI>understand the clinical course and outcome of patients based on the extent
of the affected organ(s).
</LI></UL>
<P>Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease of unknown etiology with various clinical
manifestations and variable prognosis. The clinician confronted with a patient
suspected with sarcoidosis is faced with several clinical challenges. These
include selection of appropriate diagnostic tests, assessing disease activity
and monitoring the clinical course and treatment regimen, evaluation of disease
activity and specific manifestations, sites of lesions and population
differences.</P>
<P>This course stresses a weighted decision of management or treatment of
patients with sarcoidosis based on a current understanding of the clinical
problems. The course focuses on the practical aspects of how to manage
sarcoidosis both as an internist and pulmonary subspecialist based on the
involved organs.</P>

<P><I><B>Target Audience</B></I><B>: </B>Pulmonary and occupational medicine
clinicians and trainees in individual, group, corporate, or government practice
who are confronted with situations where indoor air quality is a clinical issue,
allergists, pediatric pulmonologists and behavioral medicine specialists.</P>
<P><B>OBJECTIVES</B><BR>At the conclusion of this course, the participant
will be able to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>use the distinction between Building Related Illness and Sick Building
Syndrome to guide evaluation and management of related problems;</LI>
<LI>outline the medical and be familiar with the engineering/industrial hygiene
evaluation of a building and its inhabitants;</LI>
<LI>be familiar with the presentation, evaluation, and management of illness
arising from indoor air exposures;</LI>
<LI>be familiar with the presentation, evaluation, and management of some of
the more common functional syndromes associated with indoor air quality and
characterized by pulmonary symptoms.</LI></UL>
<P>This course will present clinically relevant information so that physicians
may develop an understanding of medical and exposure issues related to indoor
air quality. The course will begin with a careful consideration of the
distinction between Building Related Illnesses (BRI's) and Sick Building
Syndrome (SBS), including discussion of areas of uncertainty. Issues of exposure
including engineering, ventilation, and microbial contamination will be
developed. Specific BRI's will then be considered and include talks on
hypersensitivity pneumonitis, malignancies, airway irritation, and vocal cord
problems (not always BRI's). Finally, host factors and conditions which are
difficult to evaluate will be considered in talks on psychologic factors in
respiratory symptoms and disease, and on Multiple Chemical Sensitivities (MCS).</P>

<P><I><B>Target Audience:</B></I><B> </B>Active lung biology investigators
who sense a need to study cultured primary lung epithelium. Fellows,
post-doctoral, and graduate students with an interest in lung cell biology.</P>
<P><B>OBJECTIVES</B><BR>At the conclusion of this course, the participant
will be able to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>describe the current epithelial cell biological techniques used in lung
research;</LI>
<LI>explain the utility and limitations of each approach;</LI>
<LI>describe practical aspects of the experimental procedures used.</LI></UL>
<P>The purpose of this course is to familiarize the students with the variety
of approaches taken to understand lung epithelial cell biology through the
culture of primary cells and tissues. The enormous complexity of the lungs makes
it difficult to study biochemical or molecular mechanisms in the whole lungs of
animals, and it is necessary to use simpler systems such as organ culture,
tissue explants, number and isolated cells. Investigators are not always aware
of all the options available, orwhich approaches are most relevant.</P>
<P>Experts who are active in the field will deliver lectures, show examples of
data that are obtained using the techniques, and provide supplementary written
material so that the methods can be experimentally reproduced in the labs of
each participant.</P>

<P>This course is intended to provide an overview of interventional
pulmonology. In this course various therapeutic options available using a
bronchoscope, thoracoscope and new imaging techniques would be discussed for
physicians interested in the management of tracheobronchial disorders and
pleural diseases. This includes use of the endobronchial Brachytherapy,
electrocautery and cryotherapy. Endobronchial stents are highly effective in
treating airway obstruction. The diagnostic and therapeutic uses of thoracoscopy
from the view point of pulmonary physicians will be discussed. Focus on
management of malignant pleural effusions, mesothelioma, benign pleural and lung
diseases will be presented by internationally recognized authorities. Newer
techniques in the staging of lung cancer and options of needle biopsies will be
discussed. The role of newer imaging techniques such as virtual bronchoscopy in
the diagnosis and management of bronchial disorders will be discussed. An update
on percutaneous tracheostomy which is currently being used increasingly by
critical care physicians will be given. Emphasis will be given to indications,
contraindications, safe management and practical use of these therapies by the
practicing physician.</P>

<P><B>OBJECTIVES</B><BR>At the conclusion of this course, the participant
will be able to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>develop a strategy for identifying or amplifying genes;</LI>
<LI>develop a strategy for identifying the function of a specific gene or
protein;</LI>
<LI>develop a strategy for identifying protein-protein interactions.</LI></UL>
<P>In recent years, powerful techniques have been developed allowing scientists
to answer basic clinical questions at a molecular level. The aim of this course
is to provide a very practical review of a vareity of these techniques. The two
small group sessions, participants will have an opportunity to discuss strategic
approaches to solving particular research questions posed by the group leader.
Participants who pre-register will be provided with these questions in advance
of the course. Also, pre-registrants will have the opportunity to submit
questions or specific points of interest for the speakers to address in their
discussion of the scheduled topics. Upon completion of this course, the
participant should have a clear understandingof the strengths and limitations of
these techniques as well as a general understanding of their practical
application.</P>

<P>This course is designed primarily to help respiratory physicians in their
interpretation of the results of clinical exercise testing. The first three
talks will provide essential background information on the normal response to
exercise, practical organization of a clinical exercise laboratory and graphical
presentation and interpretation for results. The fourth talk will give an
overview of exercise testing in children. The next two talks will provide an
overview of exercise dysfunction andtesting in patients with cardiopulmonary
disease. The rest of the course will be dedicated to case presentations of
clinical exercise testing in individual patients. All speakers will focus on
practical points in their talks.</P>

<P><B>OBJECTIVES</B><BR>At the conclusion of this course, the participant
will be able to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>recognize the newer approaches to respiratory failure in the infant and
child and how newer therapies compare to standard therapies;</LI>
<LI>understand the role or therapies delivered via the tracheobronchial tree
(i.e., Helium-O2, nitric oxide, perflurocarbon) in various clinical settings;</LI>
<LI>determine the different manifestations of pulmonary hypertension in infants
and children and the indications for and limitations of vasodilator therapy
including prostacyclin.</LI></UL>
<P>Advancing technology has allowed new and innovative approaches to the
diagnosis and management of respiratory diseases in neonates, older infants, and
children. This course will review these advances, explain their rationale, and
compare them to standard approaches. The following topics will be discussed: new
therapies for neonatal and pediatric respiratory failure, non-invasive
ventilation, novel modes of ventilation, the potential uses of nitric oxide and
perfluorocarbon in respiratory failure in infants and older children and
vasodilator therapies for pulmonary hypertension.</P>

incense waft from upper windows carrying prayers heavenward.</P>
<P>You will enjoy lunch today at an authentic Chinese restaurant, in the heart
of Chinatown.  Here you will be served the traditional Chinese mid-day meal, dim
sum.  Dim sum the generic name for a whole range of small, bite-sized
delicacies, ranging from the crunchy egg rolls to light and delicious steamed
pork buns, to fish shaped shrimp rolls.</P>

<BR><FONT SIZE="-1">1:00pm - 5:00pm</FONT></H4>
<P>Exchange the harsh sounds of the city for softly clanging sea bells, barking
seals, and wind whispering in the chaparral and thistleweed.  Today's stroll,
designed not for the ardent hiker, but for everyone who enjoys nature, takes you
into the magnificent Marin Headlands, across the Golden Gate Straits from San
Francisco.  Close to the City in distance and time, but many moods apart, the
Headlands provide a quick departure from urban activity. Windswept ridges,
protected valleys, and beaches offer nature's best on the city's doorstep. From
the hillsides near the Golden Gate, you can enjoy magnificant views of the San
francisco harbor.</P>
<P>A naturalist guide will lead you on a leisurely walk through the headlands,
explaining the natural history and geology of the landscape. Your day will
include a visit to the Marine Mammal Center. This private, non-profit
organization is licensed by the federal government to rescue and rehabilitate
stranded marine animals along the California coast. Since its incorporation in
1975, staff and volunteers have returned hundreds of wild animals to their
natural environment. You may also see a quaint New England style lighthouse,
located through a tunnel and across a suspension bridge. Whatever you see, you
will be sure to return to the City both invigorated and relaxed.</P>

<P>San Francisco is a living museum of Victorian  architecture, with hundreds
of picturesque houses built in the  1870's-1890's, when the City was known as
the &quot;Paris of the West.&quot;;   These ornate redwood houses, embellished
with turrets, bay  windows and elaborate trimmings, have survived earthquakes
and fires,  as well as changes in personal tastes.</P>
<P>Recently, many of these beautiful houses have been  restored and painted in
bright rainbows of colors, recapturing  the splendor of old San Francisco. 
Today you will visit two of  these lovely &quot;Painted Ladies&quot;;  each
carefully and  lovingly restored to their original glory by their owners.</P>
<P>You will enjoy lunch today at the California  Culinary Academy.  There you
will enjoy a special lunch prepared  by Master European Chefs and their
apprentices.  The Academy is  a Swiss-style professional cooking school,
dedicated to  teaching the art of classical cooking.</P>

Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid after Inhaled Antigen Challenge in Asthmatics
155:421&#150;425</A></B></P>
<P>Phospholipases A2 (PLA2) hydrolyze phospholipids resulting in the release of
fatty acids including arachidonic acid (AA) and lysophospholipids. AA, in turn,
serves as a substrate for the synthesis of leukotrienes which can cause
bronchoconstriction and airways edema and appear to be important mediators of
clinical asthma. Further, lysophospholipids may be cytotoxic and/or impair the
function of surfactant. We examined the release of secretory PLA2 (sPLA2) and AA
into the airways after antigen challenge in 16 subjects with allergic asthma.
Asthmatic subjects underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
before and after inhaled antigen challenge; in addition, a single BAL, without
inhaled antigen, was performed in 10 control subjects. BAL was obtained at 4 h
(n = 7), the time of the late asthmatic response (LAR) (n = 5), or 24 h (n = 4)
after challenge. There was no difference between normal and asthmatic subjects
in either BAL fluid (BALF) sPLA2 activity or AA concentration at baseline. Both
sPLA2 and AA increased after antigen challenge (p &lt; 0.01 and 0.05,
respectively). These changes were most marked 4 h after challenge (p &lt; 0.03
for both). sPLA2 may play an important role in the generation of AA in patients
with asthma. <B>Bowton DL, Seeds MC, Fasano MB, Goldsmith B, Bass DA. AM J

Allergen Challenge 155:426&#150;431</A></B></P>
<P>Studying the inflammatory response that follows the early response to nasal
challenge with antigen provides a better understanding of allergic rhinitis than
just studying the immediate (early) response. Nine allergic volunteers were
challenged unilaterally with antigen-containing discs, and bilateral changes in
physiologic responses as well as in the concentration of histamine in nasal
secretions were measured for 11 h. We found significant immediate increases in
symptoms, sneezes, ipsilateral nasal airway resistance, and ipsilateral
histamine in the early phase response. Two-thirds of the allergen-challenged
volunteers showed increases in physiologic parameters or histamine in the hours
after allergen challenge. The pooled data of all subjects exhibited significant
increases in bilateral nasal airway resistance and in ipsilateral and
contralateral histamine, hours after unilateral provocation. These responses
differed significantly from control subjects. In another group of 11 volunteers
challenged ipsilaterally with antigen, the number of basophils increased both on
the side of challenge and on the contralateral side. The magnitude of the
increase on the ipsilateral side correlated with the increase on the
contralateral side (rs = 0.72). The basophils are the most likely source of the
contralateral increase in histamine as they are on the ipsilateral side.
Although the mechanisms underlying this contralateral increase in basophils and
histamine are not known, we speculate that delayed, neurogenic responses play a
contributory role. <B>Wagenmann M, Baroody FM, Cheng C-C, Kagey-Sobotka A,

Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluids of Asthmatic Patients 155:432&#150;435</A></B></P>
<P>The constituents of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid have been shown to
reflect the presence and possible etiology of several pulmonary diseases.
Presently, although research studies have reported the concentrations of
cytokines and compounds such as major basic protein in BAL fluids, only the
cellular elements, total protein, albumin, and immunoglobulins have been well
defined. We hypothesize that amino acids and related amino compounds, well known
participants in physiologic and biochemical processes, are present in BAL fluid
and may have involvement in asthma. Our objective was to extend knowledge of the
total chemical profile and clinical value of BAL fluids in humans by measuring
these amino compounds in normal control subjects and asthmatic patients.
Analysis by high-pressure liquid chromatography revealed the presence of 25
compounds. A few compounds in control subjects and patients were found to have
values &gt; 1.0 nmol/ml, while the majority were present in comparatively low
concentrations &lt; 1.0 nmol/ml. Asparagine, phosphoethanolamine, and taurine
were significantly increased in the asthmatic patients. We conclude that the
present profile of amino acids and related amino compounds in BAL fluid serves
as a potential diagnostic tool in the study of various pulmonary disorders. The
significance of increased asparagine, phosphoethanolamine, and taurine in the
asthmatic patients is discussed and deserves further study. <B>Hofford JM,

Plasma Exudation In Vivo 155:436&#150;441</A></B></P>
<P>8-Epi-prostaglandin F2a (8-epi-PGF2a) is an F2-isoprostane formed mainly via
noncyclooxygenase pathways in vivo. We investigated whether 8-epi-PGF2a has any
effect on airflow obstruction and plasma exudation <I>in vivo.</I> Airflow
obstruction was quantified by measuring lung resistance (RL) in anesthetized and
ventilated guinea pigs, and plasma exudation was quantified by the Evans Blue
dye method (20 mg/kg intravenously). Intratracheal instillation of 8-epi-PGF2a
(1 nmol or 10 nmol) caused dose-related increases in RL. Furthermore, the higher
dose of 8-epi-PGF2a produced Evans Blue dye extravasation in main bronchi and
intrapulmonary airways. A prostanoid TP-receptor antagonist, BAY u3405 (1 mg/kg
intravenously), abolished the airway effects of 8-epi-PGF2a (10 nmol). A
thromboxane A2 (TxA2) synthase inhibitor, OKY-406 (30 mg/kg intravenously),
significantly attenuated these effects of 8-epi-PGF2a (10 nmol). The level of
TxB2, a stable TxA2 metabolite, increased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)
after 8-epi-PGF2a instillation. We conclude that 8-epi-PGF2a causes airflow
obstruction and plasma exudation <I>in vivo.</I> This effect may be mediated
primarily via prostanoid TP-receptors, and a secondary generation of TxA2 may be
involved in part of the airway responses in 8-epi-PGF2a in the guinea pig. <B>Okazawa

<P>Events occurring up to 16 d after antigen challenge were characterized using
a novel protocol employing four bronchoscopies, two segmental antigen challenge
(SAC) procedures (on Days 1 and 2), and six bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) (on
Days 1, 2, 9, and 16) in three groups: ragweed allergic asthmatics with dual
phase airway reactions (AA-D), allergic asthmatics with a single early airway
reaction (AA-S), and nonallergic nonasthmatic control subjects. In AA-D
subjects, SAC produced a marked eosinophilic inflammatory response at 24 h
associated with eosinophil degranulation (eosinophil cationic protein [ECP] in
BAL fluid) and lung injury, which largely resolved by Day 16. When the second
antigen-challenged segment (SAC performed on Day 2) was lavaged 7 d after
challenge (Day 9), a persistent pulmonary eosinophilia was noted accompanied by
minimal elevations in ECP and albumin. Eosinophil-active cytokines showed unique
patterns: interleukin-5 (IL-5) increased in the antigen segment on Day 2 then
returned to baseline after 7 d; granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF) peaked at Day 2 but was persistently elevated throughout Day 16 in
antigen segments, and increased in control segments at late time points; IL-3
levels were constant and similar in antigen and control segments. Changes were
specific to AA-D subjects in comparison with control subjects. Elements of the
IgE-mediated pulmonary inflammatory response differ markedly in their
development and resolution. <B>Shaver JR, Zangrilli JG, Cho S-K, Cirelli RA,

Comparison between Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Asthma, and Normal
Subjects 155:449&#150;453</A></B></P>
<P>Airway inflammation is present in asthma and is thought to play a
significant part in the development of airflow obstruction. In chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), neutrophilic inflammation is present in
the airway lumen, whereas the submucosa displays a lymphocytic infiltrate. Less
is known about the nature and mechanisms of inflammation in COPD than in asthma.
Induced sputum allows noninvasive sampling of respiratory tract secretions from
patients and control subjects, allowing characterization of cells and
measurement of soluble markers. We exploited this technique in order to compare
the presence and quantify specific markers of eosinophil and neutrophil
activation in subjects with asthma and COPD, and control subjects. Differential
cell counts showed significantly higher neutrophil percentages in the patients
with COPD compared with other groups, while patients with asthma had higher
numbers of eosinophils. The neutrophil markers myeloperoxidase (MPO), from
primary granules in neutrophils, and human neutrophil lipocalin (HNL), released
from secondary granules, were elevated in patients with asthma and COPD compared
with control subjects but markedly more so in COPD. The difference between COPD
and asthma was more marked for HNL than for MPO suggesting that HNL may be a
better marker for discriminating between these conditions. Concentrations of the
eosinophil granule protein, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and the
eosinophil granule&#150;derived enzyme, eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) were raised
in the patients with asthma and those with COPD. <B>Keatings VM, Barnes PJ. AM

Acute Asthma 155:454&#150;458</A></B></P>
<P>To determine the dose of albuterol required to terminate acute episodes of
asthma, 92 acutely ill subjects received three doses of 2.5 mg each by
nebulization every 20 min. Peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) and signs and
symptoms were serially monitored. A dose&#150;response increase in pulmonary
function was found, but only 66% of the subjects improved sufficiently to be
sent home. Of these, 56% required &#163; 5.0 mg of drug to reach the discharge
threshold, whereas the remainder needed 7.5 mg. In 34% of participants,
albuterol was ineffectual. These individuals were characterized by more severe
obstruction at presentation, and after three doses of medication their PEFR
still did not exceed 40% of the expected value. Further treatment in the
emergency department (ED) or hospital was not immediately helpful, and these
patients ultimately required 3.8 &#177; 0.4 d of inpatient care to become
asymptomatic. There were no discernible differences between responders and
nonresponders in the type or quantity of medications used. However, the
nonresponders had more severe disease as measured by recurrent hospitalizations
and ED visits. This study demonstrates that, in emergency situations, albuterol
does not relieve acute airway obstruction in all asthmatic individuals with
equal efficacy. Two-thirds of patients are sensitive, and in these patients 5 to
7.5 mg of albuterol provides optimal treatment. In the remainder, albuterol,
even in high doses, has little effect for days. <B>Strauss L, Hejal R, Galan G,

<P><B><A NAME="ats8">Airway Anesthesia and Respiratory Adaptations to Dead
Space Loading and Exercise 155:459&#150;465</A></B></P>
<P>In exercising humans, added external dead space (VD) increases minute
ventilation (.VI) and causes a slower and deeper breathing pattern (<I>J. Appl.
Physiol.</I> 1991; 70:55&#150;62). Recent studies suggest that airway receptors
sensitive to topical anesthesia influence .VI and breathing pattern responses to
exercise and to added VD. We tested these hypotheses with a technique of airway
anesthesia (Anesthesia) that has been shown to reliably attenuate airway
reflexes. Anesthesia was administered by local laryngopharyngeal application and
aerosolized lidocaine inhalation, and was confirmed by citric acid aerosol
inhalation challenges. Twelve normal males performed maximal incremental cycle
ergometer exercise on 4 d (randomized) after Anesthesia with (Anesthesia VD) and
without added VD (Anesthesia Control) and after normal saline inhalation
(Saline) with (Saline VD) and without added VD (Saline Control). There were no
differences in the .VI and breathing pattern responses during exercise between
the Saline Control and the Anesthesia Control tests. After both Saline and
Anesthesia inhalation, added VD resulted in an increase in .VI both at rest and
during exercise. At matched .VI (98 L/min), the differences in tidal volume (VT)
between the Saline Control and Saline VD tests (DELTA = 0.23 &#177; 0.24 L, mean
&#177; SD) and the Anesthesia Control and Anesthesia VD tests (DELTA = 0.20 &#177;
0.28 L) were not significantly different. Our study had a power of greater than
95% to detect significant differences in VI or breathing pattern due to
Anesthesia. We conclude that in normal humans, airway receptors do not play a
major role in ventilation and breathing pattern control during exercise, and

Chemotactic Activity in Asthmatic Sputum 155:466&#150;472</A></B></P>
<P>We have applied the technique of sputum induction by hypertonic saline in
asthmatics and nonatopic control subjects to study an array of indices of airway
inflammation believed to be relevant to asthma pathogenesis. Compatible with a
central role for eosinophils and mast cells in asthma, sputum of asthmatic
subjects contained increased numbers of eosinophils and levels of eosinophil
cationic protein (ECP) and mast cell tryptase. Eosinophil numbers, and ECP and
histamine levels correlated with the degree of methacholine airways
responsiveness, and ECP, tryptase, and histamine correlated with raised
concentrations of albumin. Using the micro-Boyden chamber technique eosinophil
chemotactic activity was identified only in the sputum from asthmatics. The
correlation between the raised levels of total IgA, IL-8/IgA complexes, and
tryptase and the degree of sputum eosinophilia and ECP levels, suggests possible
mechanisms for eosinophil chemotaxis and activation in asthma. Flow cytometric
analysis of sputum lymphocytes showed an increase in CD4+ T cells and T cells
expressing intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in asthma which, together
with the finding of raised levels of soluble ICAM-1 in the sputum, indicates
upregulation of this adhesion molecule. Finally, the proportion of CD16+ natural
killer (NK) cells was reduced in the sputum of asthmatics. These observations
highlight the importance of the airway inflammation in causing asthma and
further confirm the usefulness of sputum induction as a tool in asthma research.

Severe Acute Respiratory Failure 155:473&#150;478</A></B></P>
<P>The purpose of this study was to characterize changes in oxygenation,
expressed as PaO2/FIO2, when patients with severe acute respiratory failure
(PaO2/FIO2 &lt; 150), unrelated to left ventricular failure to atelectasis, were
turned to and from a supine to prone position at 1- and 4-h intervals.
Ventilator settings were unchanged. Thirty-two consecutive patients were studied
1 h before, 1 and 4 h during and 1 h after placing in a prone position with
PaO2/FIO2 of 103 &#177; 28, 158 &#177; 62, 159 &#177; 59, and 128 &#177; 52,
respectively (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.001). After 1 h in a prone position, improvement
of PaO2/FIO2 by 20 mm Hg or more was considered a positive response. Seven
patients studied had no response (22%), hereafter referred to as nonresponders,
and 25 had a positive response (78%), hereafter referred to as responders. Among
the seven nonresponders, two did not tolerate the prone position and were
returned supine before the end of the 4-h trial. With the remaining five,
PaO2/FIO2 evolution was 83 &#177; 29, 77 &#177; 19, 83 &#177; 33, and 81 &#177;
47, respectively. For two of the 25 responders, measurements are missing after
returning to the supine position. In 10 of the 23 responders (43%) who completed
the 4 h prone trial, the PaO2/FIO2 returned to its starting value when patients
were repositioned supine: 117 &#177; 24, 164 &#177; 44, 156 &#177; 55, and 110 &#177;
34, respectively (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.01). In 13 of the 23 (57%) improvement
persisted: 105 &#177; 27, 187 &#177; 58, 189 &#177; 49, and 157 &#177; 49,
respectively (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.001). Repeated improvements after turning to a
prone position were frequently observed. Side effects in the 32 patients after a
total of 294 periods in a prone position included minor skin injury and edema,
two instances of apical atelectasis, one catheter removal, one catheter
compression, one extubation, and one transient supraventricular tachycardia.

Oxidative Stress, Morbidity, and Mortality 155:479&#150;484</A></B></P>
<P>Acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults (ARDS) carries a high
mortality. Patients with ARDS experience severe oxidative stress from neutrophil
activation, and from treatment with high inspired oxygen concentrations (FIO2).
Oxidative stress arises from an increased generation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) which overwhelm existing antioxidant defenses. Patients who do not survive
ARDS sustain much greater levels of oxidative molecular damage, suggesting that
they are less able to protect themselves against increased oxidative stress. We
measured plasma levels of pro-oxidant substrates for xanthine oxidase, namely
hypoxanthine and xanthine, and correlated them with the loss of plasma protein
thiol groups. All patients with ARDS had higher levels of hypoxanthine (37.48 &#177;
3.1 mM in nonsurvivors, 15.24 &#177; 2.09 mM in survivors) compared with
patients undergoing pulmonary resection (9.22 &#177; 1.89 mM), patients in
intensive care with sepsis but no lung injury (1.12 &#177; 0.69 mM) and normal
healthy control subjects (1.43 &#177; 0.38 mM). The difference in plasma
hypoxanthine levels between survivors and nonsurvivors of ARDS was highly
significant (p &lt; 0.001) and showed a negative correlation with loss of
protein thiol groups. Xanthine levels were also higher in patients with ARDS but
were not significantly different between ARDS survivors and nonsurvivors.
Nonsurvivors of ARDS appear to experience higher levels of oxidative stress and
damage than do survivors. <B>Quinlan GJ, Lamb NJ, Tilley R, Evans TW,

<P>The independent and interactive effect of feedback related to volume, CO2,
inspiratory flow, and arousal state on the regulation of respiratory rate in
mechanically ventilated humans is not well characterized. We examined the rate
response of eight normal volunteers during both quiet wakefulness and
non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, while mechanically ventilated through a
nasal mask in an assist/control mode with a machine back-up rate of 2
breaths/min. Tidal volume (VT) was set slightly above spontaneous VT and then
increased by 0.2 L every 3 min up to 1.8 L or 25 ml/kg. Either an inspiratory
flow of 40 L/min or an inspiratory time of 2 s (iso-TI) was set, with CO2 added
(FICO2 &gt; 0) or FICO2 = 0. Measurements were made during both quiet
wakefulness and NREM sleep. We found that as VT increased, the respiratory rate
decreased; the rate decline was observed during wakefulness and sleep, and under
isocapnic as well as hypocapnic conditions. Increasing inspiratory flow raised
the respiratory rate during wakefulness and NREM sleep. During NREM sleep,
hypocapnia resulted in wasted ventilator trigger efforts. In summary, both VT
and inspiratory flow settings affect the respiratory rate, and depending on
state, can affect CO2 homeostasis. Ventilator settings appropriate for
wakefulness may cause ventilatory instability during sleep. <B>Tobert DG, Simon

<P>This study evaluated the effects of varying tidal volumes (VT) and positive
end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels on surfactant aggregate conversion and
lung function in an animal model of lung injury induced by
N-nitroso-N-methylurethane. Lung-injured adult rabbits were initially ventilated
using a VT of 10 ml/kg (VT10), a respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min (RR30), and
a PEEP of 3.5 cm H2O. A trace dose of radiolabeled rabbit large surfactant
aggregates was instilled after the onset of ventilation, and animals were then
ventilated at different ventilator settings for 1 h. Ventilation strategies
involving a lower VT (VT5, RR60) resulted in significantly superior oxygenation
and lower surfactant aggregate conversion rates than strategies involving a
higher VT ([VT10, RR30], [VT15, RR20], p &lt; 0.05). Increasing the PEEP level
to 8.0 cm H2O improved oxgenation, but it was sustained only with a low VT (VT5,
RR60), and deteriorated with a high VT (VT10, RR30). Varying VT but not PEEP
levels resulted in significant changes in surfactant aggregate conversion. We
conclude that increased surfactant aggregate conversion resulting from
suboptimal ventilation of injured lungs may play an important role in the
pathophysiology of ventilation-induced lung dysfunction in acute lung injury.

<P>The ventilatory and hemodynamic effects of continuous positive airway
pressure (CPAP) delivered via a face mask (at 0, 5, and 10 cm H2O, and after a

(pulmonary artery occlusion pressure [PAOP] &#179; 18 mm Hg, and cardiac index
[CI] &#163; 2.8 L/min/m2). CPAP at 10 cm H2O induced an improvement in lung
compliance (60 &#177; 10 ml/cm H2O to 87 &#177; 20 ml/cm H2O, p &lt; 0.05) and
in lung and airway resistance (5.7 &#177; 1.0 cm H2O/L/s to 3.4 &#177; 1.0 cm
H2O/L/s, p &lt; 0.05), a reduction in work of breathing (18 &#177; 3 J/min to 12

respiratory muscles (279 &#177; 22 cm H2O/s/min to 174 &#177; 25 cm H2O/s/min, p

significant reduction in the negative swings in intrathoracic pressure (15.2 &#177;
1.9 cm H2O to 10.8 &#177; 1.8 cm H2O, p &lt; 0.001), no significant change was
observed in CI or stroke volume during CPAP. However, mean transmural filling
pressures decreased significantly with CPAP, suggesting a better cardiac
performance. Neither the level of stroke volume nor of PAOP, was predictive of
changes in CI or in stroke volume. In patients with respiratory insufficiency
caused by congestive heart failure (CHF), CPAP reduces respiratory muscle effort
without altering cardiac output. The slight decrease in mean transmural left and
right atrial pressures suggests an improvement in cardiac performance. <B>Lenique

Clearance in ITEx Vivo Human and Rat Lungs 155:506&#150;512</A></B></P>
<P>Because &szlig;-adrenergic agonist therapy may be useful clinically as a
treatment to hasten the resolution of alveolar edema, this study was designed to
examine the dose-dependent effects of &szlig;-adrenergic agonist therapy on
alveolar epithelial fluid clearance. The studies were done by instilling an
isosmolar 5% albumin solution into the distal air spaces of both <I>ex vivo</I>
rat and <I>ex vivo</I> human lungs that were inflated with 8 to 10 cm H2O with
100% oxygen and placed in a 37&#183;C humid incubator. Alveolar fluid clearance
was measured by the progressive increase in concentration of protein over 1 or 4
h. Salmeterol, a new long-acting lipophilic agent, was more potent than
terbutaline in stimulating alveolar fluid clearance from the <I>ex vivo</I>
human lung. Therefore, salmeterol was used for these studies. The results
indicated that: (<I>1</I>) basal, unstimulated alveolar fluid clearance in rat
lungs was significantly faster than in human lungs (24 &#177; 4% over 4 h in rat
lungs compared with 11 &#177; 2% over 4 h in human lungs, p &lt; 0.05); (<I>2</I>)
comparison of equivalent doses of &szlig;-adrenergic stimulation indicated that
stimulated clearance rates were also faster in rat lungs than in human lungs; (<I>3</I>)
very low doses of salmeterol were effective in <I>ex vivo</I> rat lungs (10&#190;8
M); and (<I>4</I>) relatively low doses were effective in the <I>ex vivo</I>
human lungs (10&#190;6 M) as a treatment for increasing alveolar fluid
clearance. In summary, there are significant differences in the basal and
stimulated rates of alveolar epithelial fluid clearance in rat and human lungs,
although the <I>ex vivo</I> human studies may have underestimated maximal
alveolar fluid clearance in the intact human lung. The human lung responds well
to relatively low doses of &szlig;-adrenergic agonist therapy, a finding with
potentially important clinical implications for hastening the resolution of
alveolar edema. <B>Sakuma T, Folkesson HG, Suzuki S, Okaniwa G, Fujimura S,

Exotonin-induced Lung Vascular Leakage 155:513&#150;519</A></B></P>
<P><I>Escherichia coli</I> hemolysin (HlyA) is a proteinaceous pore-forming
exotoxin that is implicated as a significant pathogenicity factor in
extraintestinal <I>E. coli</I> infections including sepsis. In perfused rabbit
lungs, subcytolytic concentrations of the toxin evoke thromboxane-mediated
vasoconstriction and prostanoid-independent protracted vascular permeability
increase (11). In the present study, the influence of submicromolar
concentrations of free arachidonic acid (AA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on
the HlyA-induced leakage response was investigated. HlyA at concentration from
0.02 to 0.06 hemolytic units/ ml provoked a dose-dependent, severalfold increase
in the capillary filtration coefficient (Kfc), accompanied by the release of
leukotriene(LT)B4, LTC4, and LTE4 into the recirculating buffer fluid.
Simultaneous application of 100 nmol/L AA markedly augmented the HlyA-elicited
leakage response, concomitant with an amplification of LTB4 release and a change
in the kinetics of cysteinyl-LT generation. In contrast, 50 to 200 nmol/L EPA
suppressed in a dose-dependent manner the HlyA-induced increase in Kfc values.
This was accompanied by a blockage of 4-series LT generation and a
dose-dependent appearance of LTB5, LTC5, and LTE5. In addition, EPA fully
antagonized the AA-induced amplification of the HlyA-provoked Kfc increase,
again accompanied by a shift from 4-series to 5-series LT generation. We
conclude that the vascular leakage provoked by HlyA in rabbit lungs is
differentially influenced by free AA versus free EPA, related to the generation
of 4- versus 5-series leukotrienes. The composition of lipid emulsions used for
parenteral nutrition may thus influence inflammatory capillary leakage. <B>Grimminger

Pneumoplasty in Emphysema 155:520&#150;525</A></B></P>
<P>Reduction pneumoplasty may improve flow rates, comfort, and exercise
tolerance in severe emphysema. The basis for improvement has not been
systematically addressed. The major disability of emphysema stems from
impairment of maximal expiratory flow--volume performance of the lung (MEFV).
This requires the chest wall to operate at high volumes, which in turn severely
compromises inspiratory muscle function. Clinical benefit, then, requires that
MEFV performance improve so that the operating lung volume is reduced. This
study presents theory and illustrative calculations. Removing nonventilating
lung (e.g., bullae) simply displaces the MEFV curve down the volume axis.
Removing ventilating parenchyma reduces both volume and maximal expiratory flow
at iso-lung recoil pressure, and shortens the curve on the volume axis. The
critical beneficial effect in both cases is reduction of the volume for a given
limiting flow, VL (.Vmax). Removing a given fraction of lung from the
ventilating compartment is nearly as effective as removing it from the
nonventilating compartment. Lowering of operating volumes benefits the strength,
efficiency, endurance, and reserve of the inspiratory muscles and thus extends
the metabolic scope of the emphysematous patient. <B>Hoppin FG, Jr. AM J RESPIR

room air; (<I>2</I>) NO added to room air; (<I>3</I>) O2 ( 1 L/min); or (<I>4</I>)
NO and O2. During inhalation of 2 ppm NO added to room air, the mPAP (23.1 &#177;

(434 &#177; 70 versus 378 &#177; 50 dyne s/cm5) were significantly (p &lt; 0.05)

<P>The mechanisms of exertional dyspnea relief in response to supplemental
oxygen (O2) in chronic airflow limitation (CAL) are not precisely known and are
likely multifactorial. To explore factors contributing to the relief of dyspnea
after oxygen administration, 11 patients with severe CAL (FEV1.0 = 39 &#177; 3%
predicted, mean &#177; SEM) and mild hypoxemia (resting Pao2 = 74 &#177; 2 mm
Hg) breathed room air (RA) and 60% O2 during exercise at approximately 50% of
their maximal incremental exercise capacity. Breathlessness ratings (Borg
scale), endurance time, respiratory drive (change in mouth occlusion pressure
over the first 0.1 s of inspiration, P0.1), ventilation (.VE), breathing
pattern, operational lung volumes, gas exchange, and metabolic parameters were
compared during RA and 60% O2. Pao2 at exercise cessation during RA and 60% O2
was 65 &#177; 3 mm Hg and 226 &#177; 12 mm Hg, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). With
60% O2, the mean of individual Borg/time slopes fell significantly (p &lt; 0.05)

in endurance time (r = &#190;0.64, p &lt; 0.05). During 60% O2, slopes of P0.1
and lactate over time also fell significantly (p &lt; 0.05), whereas
DELTAPaCO2/time did not change significantly. At a standardized time near
end-exercise, Borg, .VE, and P0.1 changed during 60% O2 by &#190;0.8 &#177; 0.3
(p &lt; 0.05), &#190;4.1 &#177; 2.0 L/min (p = 0.07), and &#190;1.3 &#177; 0.5

<P>Aerosol delivery of a1-protease-inhibitor (a1-PI) has the potential for
reducing the amount of a1-PI needed to treat persons who are severely

available to treat many a1-PI-deficient persons who do not now have access to
that product. Aerosolized a1-PI may also be useful in cystic fibrosis. The goal
of our study was to evaluate the duration of action of aerosolized a1-PI and
possible side effects in normal volunteers. Twenty-nine volunteers underwent
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and 3 to 7 d later inhaled 200 mg of a1-PI.
Subjects were subsequently assigned to one of five groups; a second BAL was
performed 0.5, 6, 12, 24, or 36 h after the aerosol, respectively. The BAL fluid
samples were analyzed for a1-PI concentrations, anti&#150;neutrophil elastase
(NE) activity, cell count and differential, a1-PI&#150;NE complex level, and
uptake of a1-PI by alveolar macrophages. Overall we observed no substantial side
effects. The one-time a1-PI aerosol induced a significant increase of a1-PI
concentrations as well as anti-NE activity. Even in the BAL fluid samples
obtained 36 h after aerosol administration a1-PI concentrations and anti-NE
activity were about double baseline values. The half-time in the lungs for a1-PI
concentrations and anti-NE activity were about double baseline values. The
half-time in the lungs for a1-PI was 69.2 h and for anti-NE activity was 53.2 h,
respectively. We conclude from our data in normal volunteers that inhalation of
aerosolized a1-PI may be a safe, effective, and conveniently administered
therapy for persons with severe a1-PI deficiency; this mode of administration
warrants further study. <B>Vogelmeier C, Kirlath I, Warrington S, Banik N,

Inflammatory Indices in Asthma and COPD 155:542&#150;548</A></B></P>
<P>The role of glucocorticoids in the treatment of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) is controversial. We have previously described high
numbers of neutrophils and high concentrations of the inflammatory cytokines
interkeukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), and of the cell
activation markers eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophil peroxidase
(EPO), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and human neutrophil lipocalin (HNL) in COPD
patients as compared with controls, and have postulated that the cytokines TNF-a
and IL-8 play a role in propagating the inflammatory response in COPD. We have
now studied the effects of inhaled and oral glucocorticoids on these
inflammatory indices in induced sputum. Initially, we studied the effect of a
2-wk course of inhaled budesonide (800 mg twice daily for 2 wk) in 13 patients
with severe COPD (mean FDV1: 35% predicted). There was no clinical benefit in
either lung function or symptom scores, and no significant change in the
inflammatory indices as measured by total and differential cell counts and
concentrations of TNF-a eosinophil activation markers ECP and EPO, and
neutrophil activation markers MPO and HNL. Because the lack of anti-inflammatory
effect might have been due to poor drug delivery as a result of severe airflow
limitation, we undertook a study examining the antiinflammatory effect of oral
prednisolone (30 mg daily for 2 wk) in patients with COPD and undertook the same
measurements in 10 patients with atopic asthma. Sputum eosinophil numbers, ECP,
and EPO were significantly reduced in the asthmatic patients but were not

have little antiinflammatory effect, at least in the short term in this group of
patients, and suggests that the inflammatory process in COPD is resistant to the
antiinflammatory effect of glucocorticoids. <B>Keatings VM, Jatakanon A,

<P>Resting energy expenditure (REE) is often elevated in patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but no data are available regarding total
energy expenditure in free living conditions. We compared total daily energy
expenditure (TDE) in eight COPD patients (FEV1 36 &#177; 13%) admitted to a
pulmonary rehabilitation center and eight independently living healthy subjects,
matched for sex, age, and body mass index (BMI). TDE was measured over a 2-wk
interval using doubly labeled water in combination with measurement of REE and
body composition. The COPD patients had a significantly higher TDE than the
healthy subjects (2,499 &#177; 320 kcal/d and 2,107 &#177; 88 kcal/d,
respectively, p &lt; 0.01). The nonresting component of TDE (TDE&#190;REE:
physical activity and diet-induced thermogenesis [DIT]) was significantly higher
in the COPD patients than in the healthy subjects, resulting in a ratio between
TDE and REE of 1.7 &#177; 0.2 and 1.4 &#177; 0.1, respectively (p &lt; 0.01).
The results indicate that COPD patients exhibit an increased TDE in comparison
with healthy subjects. The difference could by attributed to an increase in the
nonresting component of TDE, since REE was comparable between the groups. <B>Baarends

Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 155:555&#150;561</A></B></P>
<P>The applicability of high-intensity training and the possibility of inducing
physiologic adaptation to training are still uncertain in patients with severe
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The purposes of this study were to
evaluate the proportion of patients with moderate to severe COPD in whom
high-intensity exercise training (30-min exercise session at 80% of baseline
maximal power output [Wmax]) is feasible, and the response to training in these
patients. We also sought to evaluate the possible influence of disease severity
on the training intensity achieved and on the development of physiologic
adaptation following endurance training. Forty-two patients with COPD (age = 66
&#177; 7 yr, FEV1 = 38 &#177; 13% predicted, [mean &#177; SD]) were evaluated at
baseline and after a 12-wk endurance training program. Each evaluation included
a stepwise exercise test on an ergocycle up to the individual maximal capacity
during which minute ventilation (.VE), oxygen consumption (.VO2), carbon dioxide
production (.VCO2), and arterial lactic acid concentrations were measured. The
training consisted of 25 to 30-min exercise sessions on a calibrated ergocycle
three times a week, with a target training intensity at 80% of Wmax. The
training intensity was adjusted with the objective of reaching the target
intensity, but also to ensure that the cycling exercise could be maintained for
the specified duration. The training intensity sustained for the duration of
each exercise session averaged 24.5 &#177; 12.6, 51.7 &#177; 17.4, 63.8 &#177;
22.4, and 60.4 &#177; 22.7% of Wmax at Weeks 2, 4, 10, and 12, respectively.
High-intensity training was achieved in zero, three, five, and five patients at
Weeks 2, 4, 10, and 12, respectively. A significant increase in VO2max and Wmas
occurred with training (p &lt; 0.0002). This improvement in exercise capacity
was accompanied by a 6% and 17% reduction in .VE and in arterial lactic acid
concentration for a given work rate, respectively (p &lt; 0.0001), suggesting
that physiologic adaptation to training occurred. The intensity of training
achieved, in % Wmax, was not influenced by the initial VO2max, age, or FEV1. The
effects of training were compared in patients with an FEV1 &#179; 40% or &lt;
40% predicted. Percent changes in VO2max, Wmax, and .VE, were significant and of
similar magnitude for both groups, whereas the decrease in arterial lactic acid
for a given work rate reached statistical significance only in those patients
with an FEV1 40% predicted. We conclude that although most patients were unable
to achieve high-intensity training as defined in this study, significant
improvement in their exercise capacity was obtained and physiologic adaptation
to endurance training occurred. The training intensity expressed as a percent of
the individual maximum exercise capacity, and the relative effectiveness of
training, were not influenced by the severity of airflow obstruction. <B>Maltais

<P>Laboratory animal workers are at high risk of developing occupational
allergy. Little is known about the relationship between levels of exposure and
the risk of developing laboratory animal allergy. A cross-sectional study was
performed in 540 workers at eight facilities to quantify the exposure&#150;response
relationship for allergy to rats, while controlling for determinants like atopy,
gender, and smoking. All participants completed a questionnaire, underwent skin
prick testing with common and occupational allergens, and total IgE as well as
occupational allergen-specific IgE antibodies were serologically measured.
Personal air dust samples were taken during full-shift periods to estimate the
rat urinary aeroallergen exposure levels. In the whole study population no clear
exposure&#150;response relationship was observed. However, in the group of
workers with less than 4 yr of working experience with laboratory animals the
prevalence rate of sensitization to rat allergens was clearly associated with
exposure levels. The exposure&#150;response relationship was steepest for
workers with atopy-associated risk factors, i.e., self-reported allergy or
sensitization to cats or dogs, or elevated total serum IgE. The prevalence rates
of sensitization to rat allergens for these workers were about 15, 9.5, and 7.3

<P>As an approach to evaluating the public health burden from current air
pollution levels, we examined the relationship of daily emergency room (ER)
visits for respiratory illnesses (25 hospitals, average 98 visits/d) to air
pollution in Montreal, Canada, from June through September, 1992 and 1993. Air
pollutants measured included ozone (O3), particulate matter diameter &lt; 10 mm
(PM10) and &lt; 2.5 mm (PM2.5), the sulfate fraction of PM2.5 (SO4), and aerosol
strong acidity (H+). Temporal trends, autocorrelation, and weather were
controlled for in time-series regressions. For 1992, no significant associations
with ER visits were found. However, 33% of the particulate data were missing.
For 1993, 1-h maximum O3, PM10, PM2.5, and SO4 were all positively associated
with respiratory visits for patients over 64 yr of age (p &lt; 0.02). An
increase to the mean level of 1-h maximum O3 (36 ppb) was associated with a 21%
increase over the mean number of daily ER visits (95% confidence interval [CI]:
8 to 34%). Effects of particulates were smaller, with mean increases of 16% (4
to 28%), 12% (2 to 21%) and 6% (1 to 12%) for PM10, PM2.5, and SO4,
respectively. Relative mass effects were PM2.5 &gt; PM10 &gt; SO4. Ozone and
PM10 levels never exceeded 67 ppb and 51 mg/m3, respectively (well below the
U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standards of 120 ppb and 150 mg/m3,
respectively). The present findings have public health implications with regard

<P>Psychological factors can play a role in asthma symptoms and may play a role
in how individuals manage asthma. Because poor self-management of asthma has
been linked to poor outcomes, it is important to understand perceived control of
asthma--the individual's perceived ability to deal with asthma and its
exacerbations effectively. This study used data from an ongoing panel study of
adults with asthma (n = 601). The 11-item Perceived Control of Asthma
Questionnaire (PCAQ) demonstrated internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.74)
and excellent construct validity, correlating strongly with asthma severity,
quality of life, and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36) measures of
health status (p &lt; 0.05). After controlling for demographics and asthma
severity, each 6-point decrement in PCAQ score was significantly associated with
increased risk of hospitalization (OR = 1.4 [95% CI: 1.1 to 1.8]), frequent
activity restriction (OR = 1.5 [1.2 to 1.8]), and, among those with labor force
participation (n = 551), asthma-related cessation of employment (OR = 1.7 [1.1
to 2.4]). The PCAQ is a short, easy to administer, reliable, and valid measure
of perceived control of asthma. It is strongly associated with adverse asthma
outcomes even taking into account demographic characteristics and asthma
severity, suggesting that patient-centered interventions focusing on perceived
control might improve asthma outcomes. <B>Katz PP, Yelin EH, Smith S, Blanc PD.

<P>This study was designed to determine whether an integrated screening program
could be implemented that identified persons with latent tuberculosis infection
among jail inmates and produced a high rate of completion of isoniazid
preventive therapy (IPT) in those persons after their discharge from short-term
detention, by means of community-based directly observed preventive therapy
(DOPT). From June 1, 1992 through December 31, 1994 inmates in the King County
Jail who were from populations at high risk of tuberculosis were screened by
means of the tuberculin skin test and those with latent tuberculosis infection
were offered IPT. Among 262 inmates receiving IPT upon release from jail, 105
(40%) could not be located after release. Among another 105 enrolled on DOPT, 63
(60%) completed therapy. Among 52 who chose self-supervised isoniazid therapy
after release, 15 (29%) completed therapy (chi-square = 13.50, p = 0.0002).
Among persons with latent tuberculosis infection detected during screening at a
county jail, a postrelease DOPT program resulted in a high rate of immediate
loss to follow-up and a low rate of completion of therapy. Based on these
results, we suggest that funds for TB control, if limited, should not be
diverted to jail-based screening and postrelease DOPT. <B>Nolan CM, Roll L,

Regions in the Lung of Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis and Sarcoidosis 155:587&#150;596</A></B></P>
<P>Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) and sarcoidosis are interstitial lung
disorders (ILD) characterized by a lymphocytic alveolitis that, in the active
phase of the disease, is sustained by different T-cell subsets, i.e., CD8+ cells
in HP and CD4+ lymphocytes in sarcoid patients. To address the question of
whether a bias in T-cell selection occurs in the lung of patients with HP and
sarcoidosis, we analyzed the T-cell receptor &szlig; chain variable region
(TCR-V&szlig;) repertoire by flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
analyses in blood and lung lymphocytes of 14 HP and 25 sarcoid patients. To
verify whether these cells can be activated <I>in vitro</I> through the TCR,
blood and lung lymphocytes were also assessed for their responsiveness to
different superantigenic stimuli represented by staphylococcal enterotoxins,
including SEA, SEB, SEC1, SEC2, SED, and SEE. Flow cytometry and PCR analyses
demonstrated an overexpression of cells bearing V&szlig;2, V&szlig;3, V&szlig;5,
V&szlig;6, and V&szlig;8 gene segments in the lung of HP patients as compared
with the peripheral blood. In sarcoid patients cells bearing V&szlig;2, V&szlig;5,
and V&szlig;6 gene segments in the lung of HP patients as compared with the
peripheral blood. In sarcoid patients cells bearing V&szlig;2, V&szlig;5, and V&szlig;6
gene segments were overrepresented in the lung rather than in the blood. Both in
HP and sarcoid patients almost all T cells bearing the dominant V&szlig; segment
belonged to the T-cell subset that sustains the alveolitis, i.e., CD8 in HP
patients and CD4 in sarcoid subjects. Follow-up studies demonstrated that the
recovery of the alveolitis was characterized by the disappearance of cells
bearing a limited T-cell repertoire. Interestingly, T-lymphocyte response to
different superantigens demonstrated that the proliferation elicited by
different staphylococcal toxins was more pronounced in the lung than in the
blood. Taken together, our findings indicate a compartmentalization of cells
bearing discrete V&szlig; gene products in the pulmonary microenvironment and
suggest that the expansion of specific V&szlig; region subsets occurring in the
lung might result from triggering by a specific antigen. In fact, the removal
from exposure in HP patients or specific treatment in sarcoidosis resulted in
the decrease of the overrepresented cell population accounting for the
lymphocytic alveolitis. <B>Trentin L, Zambello R, Facco M, Tassinari C,

intracellular pH (pHi) of which has never been investigated. In the present
study, the intrinsic buffering power of H+ ions (&szlig;i) and the pHi
regulatory systems were investigated in primary cultures of human pleural
mesothelial cells (PMCs) with microspectrofluorimetry. We found: (<I>1</I>)
that at the resting pHi, the &szlig;i was low and increased as the pHi
decreased; (<I>2</I>) that the pHi recovery was largely inhibited either with
Na+-free medium or nominally HCO3&#190; free medium containing ethyl-isopropyl

the EIPA-sensitive Na+&#150;H+ exchanger; a novel electroneutral, DIDS-sensitive

patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), by comparing the
observed change in ventilation (DELTA.VEobs) with the DELTA.VE predicted
(DELTA.VEpred) from the patients' ventilatory drive and the O2-induced

FEV1 = 1.00 &#177; 0.25 L, FVC = 2.33 &#177; 0.38 L; room air PaCO2 = 52.7 &#177;
7.9 mm Hg, SaO2 87.7 &#177; 5.1%) were studied. Using standard rebreathing
methods, we measured the ventilatory responses to hypercapnia (DELTA.VE/PCO2 =
0.76 &#177; 0.55 L/min/mm Hg) and to hypoxia (DELTA.VE/DELTASaO2 = &#190;0.74 &#177;
0.31 L/min/%). After breathing 100% O2 for 15 min, the mean DELTA.VEobs was &#190;0.08
&#177; 0.62 (SEM) L/min (p = NS), the DELTASaO2 was 7.6 &#177; 3.6% (p &lt;

DELTA.VEpred was expressed as the sum of a decrease in ventilation due to
suppression of hypoxic drive [calculated as the product (DELTA.VE/SaO2) .
DELTASaO2] and an increase in ventilation due to the O2-induced hypercarbia
[calculated as the production (DELTA.VE/DELTAPCO2) . DELTAPaCO2]. The mean
DELTA.VEped [&#190;0.96 &#177; 0.68 (SEM)] did not differ significantly from

expected from the ventilatory drives and the changes in PaCO2 and SaO2; and that
O2-induced hypercarbia does not indicate a failure of respiratory control

<P>Although lung transplantation improves exercise capacity by removal of a
ventilatory limitation, recipients' postoperative maximum oxygen uptake
(.VO2max) remains markedly abnormal. To determine if abnormal skeletal muscle
oxidative capacity contributes to this impaired aerobic capacity, nine lung
transplant recipients and eight healthy volunteers performed incremental
quadriceps exercise to exhaustion with simultaneous measurements of pulmonary
gas exchange, minute ventilation, blood lactate, and quadriceps muscle pH and
phosphorylation potential by 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS). Five
to 38 mo after lung transplantation, peak .VO2 was decreased compared with that
of normal control subjects (6.7 &#177; 0.4 versus 12.3 &#177; 1.0 ml/min/kg, p &lt;
0.001), even after accounting for differences in age and lean body weight.
Neither ventilation, arterial O2 saturation nor mild anemia could account for
the decrease in aerobic capacity. Quadriceps muscle intracellular pH (pHi) was
more acidic at rest (7.07 &#177; 0.01 versus 7.12 &#177; 0.01 units, p &lt;
0.05) and fell during exercise from baseline values at a lower metabolic rate
(282 &#177; 21 versus 577 &#177; 52 ml/min, p &lt; 0.001). Regressions for pHi
versus .VO2, phosphocreatine/inorganic phosphate ratio (PCr/Pi) versus .VO2, and
blood lactate versus pHi were not different. Among transplant recipients, the
metabolic rate at which pHi fell correlated closely with peak exercise capacity
(r = 0.87, p &lt; 0.01). The persistent decrease in .VO2max after lung
transplantation may be related to abnormalities of skeletal muscle oxidative

of dogs: (<I>1</I>) animals given intravenous polyethylene glycol adsorbed
superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD, 2,000 units/kg) 1 h before a fatigue trial; (<I>2</I>)

a group treated with denatured PEG-SOD (2,000 units/kg) before fatigue. We
measured diaphragmatic concentrations of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances
(TBAR), a marker of free radical&#150;mediated lipid peroxidation, on muscle
samples taken at the conclusion of fatigue trials. As a control, we also
measured TBAR concentrations for muscle samples taken from nonfatigued
diaphragm. We found that the rate of development of diaphragm fatigue was much
greater in saline and denatured PEG-SOD-treated groups than for animals
pretreated with either PEG-SOD or DMSO, with force falling to 23 &#177; 4, 21 &#177;
4, 50 &#177; 7, and 47 &#177; 6% of its initial value, respectively, over a 2-h

nonfatigued fresh diaphragm or fatigued diaphragm taken from PEG-SOD- or

resulting from repetitive low-frequency stimulation is associated with lipid
peroxidation within this muscle and that pretreatment with free radical

(kcat), and peak mechanical efficiency (Effmax) were calculated from A.F.
Huxley's equations; m was lower in PL than in C, in both twitch (3.4 &#177; 0.2

twitch 4.3 &#177; 0.5 versus 3.4 &#177; 0.2 109/mm2; NS) and tetanus (6.2 &#177;
0.4 versus 4.0 &#177; 0.3 109/mm2; p &lt; 0.01), with no change in p. In the
three groups, Effmax correlated linearly with kcat (r = 0.93; p = 0.001) and
showed a negative linear correlation with p (r = 0.996; p = 0.001). In
conclusion, our results show that in experimental cardiomyopathy, ACE inhibitor
mainly helps to prevent a decrease in the number of diaphragm muscle
crossbridges, resulting in preserved peak isometric tension. <B>Lecarpentier Y,

155:637&#150;641</A></B></P>
<P>We studied the pattern of discharge of the posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA),
cricothyroid (CT), thyroarytenoid (TA), and arytenoideus transversus (AR)
muscles during cough in 12 anesthetized dogs. Diaphragm electromyographic (EMG)
activity was also recorded, together with subglottic and esophageal pressures.
Trains of repetitive coughs were induced by mechanically stimulating the
tracheobronchial airway. Trials with the upper airway isolated from and
connected to the lower airway were performed before and following bilateral
sectioning of the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN). The
immediate effect of tracheal stimulation was an &quot;apneic&quot; period at
FRC, during which the PCA, a laryngeal abductor, showed a progressive increase
in activity accompanied by small, variable increases in the activity of the CT
and the laryngeal adductors, the TA and AR. The subsequent cough efforts were
divided into three phases: inspiration, glottic narrowing, and forced
expiration. PCA activity was greatest during the inspiratory phase and CT
activity was greatest during the expiratory phase. Peak subglottic pressure
occurred during glottic narrowing and coincided with the greatest activation of
the TA and AR during the cough effort, and suppression of the PCA and CT. The
patterns of EMG activation were not affected by the route of breathing or SLN
section. The results suggest the presence of a uniquely central process
controlling laryngeal muscles during cough, independent of laryngeal sensory
feedback. <B>Sant'Ambrogio G, Kuna ST, Vanoye CR, Sant'Ambrogio FB. AM J RESPIR

<P>In normal subjects 2 min of maximal voluntary hyperventilation results in
failure of tension generation and low-frequency fatigue of the diaphragm.
Patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) do not develop
diaphragm fatigue during exhaustive treadmill exercise despite excessive
inspiratory muscle loading and we hypothesized that they might be relatively
resistant to the development of diaphragm fatigue during maximal ventilation. In
six patients with severe COPD (mean FEV1 0.671) we therefore loaded the
diaphragm using 2 min of maximal isocapnic ventilation (MIV). Initial mean
ventilation was 28.6 L/min and diaphragm pressure&#150;time product (PTPdi) 602
cm H2O . s/min; these values were sustained throughout MIV without significant
decline. Mean twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure (Tw Pdi) was 19.7 cm H2O 25 min
after a control run and 20.5 cm H2O at the same time after MIV. Compared with
normal subjects previously studied in our laboratory (1) the reduction in PTPdi
was disproportionately greater than the reduction in Tw Pdi. We conclude that,
unlike normal subjects, 2 min of MIV causes neither failure of diaphragm
performance nor low-frequency diaphragm fatigue in patients with severe COPD. It
is likely that the diaphragm makes a relatively limited contribution to the
generation of maximal levels of ventilation in severe COPD. <B>Polkey MI,

<P>To study the effects of apneic pauses, sighs, and breathing patterns on
functional residual capacity (FRC), we measured FRC repeatedly in 48 healthy
preterm infants (weight at study 2,042 &#177; 316 g [mean &#177; SD],
postconceptional age 36.6 &#177; 2.0 wk), during unsedated sleep using a
modified heliox/nitrogen washout technique. Breathing movements and pulse
oximeter saturation (SpO2) were recorded throughout and recordings analyzed for
the presence of regular and nonregular breathing pattern, apneic pauses, sighs,
and desaturations (SpO2 &#163; 90%) during the last 2 min prior to each FRC
measurement. FRC was lower during nonregular than during regular breathing
pattern (23.3 &#177; 7.2 ml/kg versus 26.9 &#177; 7.8 ml/kg, p &lt; 0.02);
however, this apparent effect of breathing pattern disappeared after controlling
the data for apneic pauses. Apneic pauses resulted in a significant decrease in
FRC: mean FRC was 20.0 &#177; 6.8 ml/kg if measured within 2 min of an apneic
pause, 26.0 &#177; 6.9 ml/kg if measured after a sigh (p &lt; 0.001), and 24.0 &#177;
7.7 ml/kg if there had been neither a sigh nor an apneic pause (p &lt; 0.05).
The interval between the apneic pause and the FRC measurement had no effect on
FRC. There was an inverse correlation between FRC and the speed with which SpO2
fell during desaturation (r = &#190;0.5, p &lt; 0.03). Apneic pauses resulted in
a persistent reduction in FRC in these preterm infants. Sighs appeared to
restore FRC. The significant relationship between FRC and the speed of
desaturation found in this study underscores the importance of endogenous or
exogenous strategies that help to increase FRC, such as sighs or the application
of continuous positive airway pressure, for the stability of oxygenation in
preterm infants who have difficulty maintaining their oxygenation. <B>Poets CF,

<P>In order to investigate associations between summertime haze air pollution
and asthma at an individual level, 52, 58, and 56 children (ages 7 to 13)
attending a summer &quot;asthma camp&quot; were followed during the last week of
June in 1991, 1992, and 1993, respectively. Most of the subjects had moderate to
severe asthma. Daily records were kept of the environmental conditions, as well
as of subject medication use, lung function, and medical symptoms. Air pollution
was found to be significantly and consistently correlated with acute asthma
exacerbations, chest symptoms, and lung function decrements. The pollutant most
consistently associated with adverse health consequences was ozone (O3),
although associations with sulfates and hydrogen ion suggest a possible role by
fine particles as well. Effects were found to be roughly monotonic as a function
of O3 concentration. Regression of morning (8:00 a.m.) to afternoon (5:00 p.m.)
peak flow change on O3 indicated pulmonary function reductions similar to those
previously reported for more active children without asthma. Moreover, analyses
also indicated an increased risk of an asthma exacerbation and of experiencing
chest symptoms of approximately 40% on the highest pollution day, relative to
the mean. Based on these relative risk estimates, a rise in the 1-h daily
maximal O3 from 84 ppb to 160 ppb was associated in this group with an increase
from 20 to 28 (&#177; 2) in the expected number of unscheduled medications
administered/day, and from 29 to 41 (&#177; 3) in the expected total number of
chest symptoms/day. Thus, air pollution can be a major contributor to the
respiratory problems experienced by children with asthma during the summer

<P>We used various ovalbumin sensitization and challenge protocols to determine
the importance of the rout of allergen administration and the genetic background
in modulating the physiologic, inflammatory, and immunologic features
characteristic of allergen-induced asthma. In BALB/c mice, induction of maximal
airway hyperresponsiveness and airspace eosinophilia required administration of
ovalbumin by both the intraperitoneal and the intranasal routes (combination
protocol), whereas intraperitoneal immunization alone resulted in maximal
ovalbumin-specific IgE plasma levels. Thus, a systemic immune response to
allergen, in addition to, or independent of IgE production, as well as local
allergen challenge were necessary for maximal induction of pulmonary disease.
BALB/c mice treated with ovalbumin by the combination protocol had increased
Th2-type cytokine mRNA levels in bronchial lymph node tissue compared with
control mice. In contrast, C57BL/6 mice treated with ovalbumin by the
combination protocol had significantly decreased responses compared with BALB/c
mice for all parameters of allergic pulmonary disease examined, with the
exception of airspace eosinophilia. Genetic background has a striking and
selective effect on the phenotype of murine allergic pulmonary disease. Further
analysis of this murine model should be useful in helping define the critical
pathogenetic events in allergen-induced asthma. <B>Zhang Y, Lamm WJE, Albert

PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 immunoreactivity in bronchial biopsies obtained from 22

between the patient populations. There were no correlations between any of the

characterized by intraluminal proliferation of connective tissue in distal air
spaces. As part of a general investigation of the role of growth factors in this
process, the present study examined the expression of the mitogen,
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and one of its receptors, PDGFR-&szlig;,
in this disease. Serial sections of lung biopsy specimens from 20 patients with
BOOP and 10 control subjects were stained with antibodies against PDGF, PDGFR-&szlig;,
and the monocyte/macrophage marker CD68. Stereologic point counting showed that
PDGF+ cells represented 4.6 &#177; 1.6% (mean &#177; SD) of the volume occupied
by lung tissue in BOOP and 2.1 &#177; 0.7% in the control subjects (p &lt;

macrophages accounted for 10.7 &#177; 4.7% of the lung tissue in BOOP as

<P>The extent to which the bronchial vasculature contributes to airway wall
thickening in large and small airways in patients with asthma is unknown. The
aim of this study was to quantify the number and the area occupied by blood
vessels in the airway submucosa of patients with and without asthma. We used the
monoclonal antibody Factor VIII to measure the blood vessels between the airway
basement membrane and the outer border of the smooth muscle. In large
cartilaginous airways in patients with fatal asthma, the number and area of
large blood vessels were increased and the number and area of small blood
vessels were decreased, compared with that in patients with nonfatal asthma and
control subjects. However, the total number of blood vessels and the total area
occupied by blood vessels per square millimeter in the airway submucosa were
similar in patients with fatal asthma or nonfatal asthma and in control subjects
in all airway size groups. Blood vessels were distended to a mean value of 80%
of their estimated maximal area. The increased number of larger vessels in
patients with fatal asthma raises the possibility that vascular congestion
associated with an acute severe asthma attack may distend blood vessels. The
finding of similar numbers of blood vessels per square millimeter of submucosa
in control subjects and in patients with asthma suggests that blood vessels
increase in number in patients with asthma only in proportion to increased
airway wall area. It is unlikely that submucosal vessels could act as
capacitance vessels and significantly alter inner airway wall thickness. <B>Carroll

that is a potent chemoattractant for both memory T cells and eosinophils.We
therefore investigated RANTES in the nasal mucosa after local allergen

turbinate were taken from 14 atopic, seasonal rhinitic patients and seven normal

after a control (allergen diluent) challenge. In five of seven rhinitics tested,
radioimmunoassay of nasal fluid demonstrated increases in RANTES at 2 to 4 h (p

mRNA (p = 0.0015) and protein (p = 0.01) containing cells in the nasal submucosa
at 6 h. No changes were observed in normal subjects. Increases in RANTES mRNA+
cells correlated with the associated increases in eosinophils (r = 0.78, p =

were macrophages (51%) followed by eosinophils (15%), T lymphocytes (11%), and
mast cells (3%). Our results demonstrate that allergen-induced rhinitis is

To determine whether NM may also be useful in treating adult respiratory

lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pulmonary vascular injury in rats. The
intraperitoneal administration of NM prevented the pulmonary vascular injury and
coagulation abnormalities induced by LPS. DEGR-factor VIIa, a selective
inhibitor of factor VIIa, prevented the coagulation abnormalities, but not the
pulmonary vascular injury, induced by LPS. NM did not reduce LPS-induced
increase in pulmonary accumulation of leukocytes. NM did not inhibit the
increase in the plasma concentration of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) observed
after administration of LPS. NM did not inhibit the function of activated
neutrophils <I>in vitro.</I> Plasma values of total serum hemolytic complement
(CH50) were markedly decreased after the administration of LPS. NM inhibited the
LPS-induced decrease in plasma CH50 values. Findings suggest that NM may reduce

dependent on the inhibitory effect of the activation of the complement system in

subjects with chronic bronchial sepsis in terms of interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-1&szlig;,
and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa) production. In sputum, the numbers of
neutrophils correlated with the concentrations of these cytokines. Sputum
neutrophils constitutively secreted large amounts of IL-8, IL-1&szlig;, and
TNFa. The patterns of secretion, however, differed from those of blood
neutrophils stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cytokine
secretion was time-dependent and was inhibited by cycloheximide and
dexamethasone. IL-10 inhibition of IL-8 production by sputum neutrophils was
significantly less than that noted with activated neutrophils. Antibody to IL-1&szlig;
but not to TNFa, inhibited IL-8 secretion by sputum neutrophils, contrasting
with results found using blood neutrophils. Incubation of blood neutrophils in
sputum sol induced a similar cytokine secretion profile to that following
exposure to LPS. The inhibitory effects on IL-8 protein production correlated

Breathing: Side Effects and Efficacy 155:732&#150;738</A></B></P>
<P>We examined the efficacy and the acceptance of an oral device (SnorExR)
causing a forward displacement of the tongue for the treatment of
sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Twenty-three consecutive subjects with SDB
were investigated. Noncompliance (NC) of use of the oral appliance was observed
in 74% (17 of 23) of the subjects. NC patients were characterized by
unacceptable local side effects of the prosthesis, lacking improvement of
indicators of daytime well-being, and a missing reduction of the respiratory
disturbance index (RDI). The device was tolerated without side effects in 26% (6
of 23) of the subjects. In these compliant (C) subjects the RDI, EDS, and
snoring improved significantly (p &lt; 0.05) compared with baseline values.
After 6 mo using the device, five of the six C patients were still using it. We
conclude that the high rate of noncompliance and the low efficacy of the SnorExR
prosthesis preclude large-scale use of this treatment modality in patients with
SDB and snoring since the local side effects are the principal cause of NC. No
useful predictive parameter of treatment compliance or treatment success was
found. Thus, this dental appliance should be prescribed only for selected
patients failing other treatment modalities seen by an experienced
sleep-disorders specialist. <B>Sch&ouml;nhofer B, Stoohs RA, Rager H, Wenzel M,

Intestinal Peptide on Bronchoprotection against Histamine in Anesthetized Guinea
Pigs 155:747&#150;750</A></B></P>
<P>Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and nitric oxide (NO) are considered to
be nonadrenergic, noncholinergic (NANC) inhibitory neurostransmitters in the
airways. It seems likely that these neurotransmitters may be coreleased and act
as functional antagonists against bronchoconstrictor stimuli. In the present
study, we examined the synergistic effect of NO and VIP on bronchoprotection
against histamine in anesthetized guinea pigs. The NO donor, <I>S</I>-nitroso-<I>N</I>-acetylpenicillamine
(SNAP) significantly inhibited histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in a
dose-dependent manner. VIP also inhibited histamine-induced bronchoconstriction
in a dose-dependent manner, but this bronchoprotective effect was short-lived.
Additionally, VIP (10&#190;9M) had no significant bronchoprotective effect, but
a subthreshold dose of SNAP (10 &#190;7M) significantly potentiated VIP (10&#190;9M)-induced
bronchoprotection against histamine. Moreover, SNAP (10&#190;7M) significantly
enhanced VIP (10&#190;7M)-induced bronchoprotection for a longer period of time.
On the other hand, VIP (10&#190;9M) also significantly potentiated SNAP-induced
bronchoprotection against histamine. In conclusion, combination therapy with NO
donor and VIP receptor agonist may have important advantages in the treatment of
bronchial asthma, and both NO and VIP may contribute in complementary fashion to
the NANC-induced relaxant response in guinea pig airways. <B>Kanazawa H,

Muscle in Human Isolated Bronchi 155:751&#150;755</A></B></P>
<P>Contractile and relaxant responses to capsaicin and resiniferatoxin were
examined in human isolated bronchus (5&#150;12 mm o.d.). Bronchi isolated from
10 of 16 lungs contracted in response to capsaicin. The contractions averaged
20% of maximal contraction at 1 mM and averaged &gt; 40% maximal contraction at
300 mM (the highest concentration studied). The capsaicin-induced contractions
were mimicked by resiniferatoxin (0.1&#150;10 mM) and inhibited by the putative
capsaicin receptor antagonist, capsazepine (10 mM). The contractile response to
capsaicin was not affected by the potent NK-2 selective antagonist SR 48968 (0.3
mM), whereas responses to concentrations of neurokinin A (10 nM), neurokinin B
(0.1 mM), substance P (1 mM), neuropeptide &amp;g (10 nM), and neuropeptide K
(10 nM) which produced similar-size contractions were almost abolished by 0.1 mM
SR 48968. The bronchi isolated from 8 of 16 lungs also exhibited relaxations in
response to capsaicin. Capsaicin-induced relaxations were not inhibited by the
nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-nitro-n-arginine (10 mM). In whole-cell
patch-clamp experiments on human cultured airway smooth muscle cells, capsaicin
was found to enhance outward currents due to the activation of
charybdotoxin-sensitive large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Neither
the capsaicin-induced contractions nor the relaxations were mimicked by
angiotensin II, bombesin, or calcitonin gene-related peptide at concentrations
up to 1 mM. These results suggest that capsaicin and resiniferatoxin can alter
smooth muscle tone, but this response does not appear to involve substance P or
related neurokinins. Relaxations to capsaicin may, however, involve the
activation of large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels. <B>Ellis JK, Sham

<P>Recent studies show that peroxynitrite is a potent trigger of DNA strand
breakage, which in turn activates the nuclear repair enzyme poly (ADP-ribose)
synthetase (PARS), resulting in a cellular energy deficit. Here we present
evidence that treatment of A549 human pulmonary epithelial cells with
peroxynitrite (1 mM) results in ADP-ribosylation, NAD+ depletion, inhibition of
mitochondrial respiration, and increased epithelial paracellular permeability.
The PARS inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide (1 mM) provided a significant, partial
protection against the energetic and functional changes. Similarly, inhibition
of PARS activity by 3-aminobenzamide reduced the peroxynitrite-induced
suppression of mitochondrial respiration in BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial
cells. Thus, PARS activation and energy depletion represents one of the pathways
of peroxynitrite-mediated epithelial toxicity. Inhibition of PARS may improve
cellular energy homeostasis in pathophysiologic conditions associated with
peroxynitrite generation. <B>Szab&oacute;, C., C. Saunders, M. O'Connor, and A.

<P>The role of mononuclear phagocytes and their cytokine products in host
defense against <I>Pneumocystis carinii</I> (PC) remains unclear. The cytokine
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been proposed as critical for host defense
against this pathogen. To investigate the role of this cytokine in PC infection,
we treated immunocompetent mice (CD4+) or mice depleted of CD4 lymphocytes (CD4&#190;)
with a recombinant adenovirus encoding a TNF inhibitor gene (AdTNF-R). AdTNF-R
treated CD4+ animals displayed delayed clearance of PC after intratracheal
inoculation, whereas AdTNF-R treated CD4&#190; animals developed more severe
chronic infection. Moreover, AdTNF-R treated CD4&#190; animals, in contrast to
control CD4&#190; mice, failed to show any interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene induction
in the lung after PC challenge. The results firmly implicate TNF in host defense
against PC, and support a role for TNF in orchestrating the intrapulmonary
cytokine cascade in PC infection. <B>Kolls, J. K., D. Lei, C. Vazquez, G. Odom,

<P>Microtubules are in a dynamic equilibrium of polymerization and
depolymerization. In monocytes and macrophages, microtubules bind endotoxin and
partly regulate inflammatory events such as cytokine production. To characterize
the morphologic differences between alveolar macrophage and blood monocyte
microtubules after LPS stimulation, cells were examined by immunofluorescent
microscopy and laser confocal microscopy. Fresh monocytes contained an average
of 26 microtubules per cell which significantly increased to 31 microtubules per
cell following a 30-min exposure to LPS (<I>P</I> &lt; 0.001). Using a
nocodazole-based assay of microtubule dynamic instability, the half-life of
fresh unstimulated human monocyte microtubules was approximately 18 s and
extended to 26 s following a 30-min exposure to LPS. <I>In vitro</I> maturation
of monocytes for 18 h increased microtubule stability but not number. Compared
to monocytes, alveolar macrophage microtubules were longer, more numerous, and
much more stable. These results suggest that alveolar macrophage microtubules
are more numerous and stable than blood monocyte microtubules and that LPS
causes an increase in monocyte microtubule number and stability. <B>Allen, J.

<P>Microtubules are integral components of the cytoskeleton of human cells and
are composed of a- and &szlig;-tubulin as well as a variable number of
microtubule-associated proteins. In monocytes and macrophages, microtubules bind
endotoxin and partly regulate endotoxin-induced inflammatory events such as
cytokine production. Endotoxin causes a rapid alteration in monocyte microtubule
stability. To characterize the effect of endotoxin on mononuclear phagocyte
microtubule composition, Western blots and flow cytometry were performed on
human monocytes and the monocyte/macrophage-like cell line THP-1. Compared to
unstimulated monocytes, monocytes stimulated with endotoxin for 18 h had
increased quantities of a-, &szlig;-, and tyrosinated a-tubulin as well as
microtubule-associated protein-2. PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells had increased
levels of a-tubulin, &szlig;-tubulin, microtubule-associated protein-5,
microtubule-associated protein-2, and tau after endotoxin stimulation. These
results indicate that endotoxin can alter mononuclear phagocyte microtubules by
causing an increase in certain microtubule component proteins. <B>Allen, J. N.,

<P>The lung is richly supplied with peptidergic nerves that store and secrete
substance P (SP), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and other neuropeptides
known to potently modulate leukocyte function <I>in vitro</I> and airway
inflammation <I>in vivo</I>. To investigate and characterize neuromodulation of
immune responses compartmentalized in lung parenchyma, neuropeptide release and
expression of neuropeptide receptors were studied in lungs of antigen-primed
C57BL/6 mice after intratracheal challenge with sheep erythrocytes. The
concentrations of cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid rose early and
peaked on day 1 for interleukin (IL)-2, interferon &amp;g, and IL-10; days 1 to
2 for IL-6; and day 3 for IL-4, whereas the total number and different types of
leukocytes in BAL fluid peaked subsequently on days 4 to 6 after i.t. antigen
challenge. Immunoreactive SP and VIP in BAL fluid increased maximally to
nanomolar concentrations on days 1 to 3 and 2 to 7, respectively in lungs
undergoing immune responses. The high-affinity SP receptor (NK-1 R), and VIP
types I (VIPR1) and II (VIPR2) receptors were localized by immunohistochemistry
to surface membranes of mononuclear leukocytes and granulocytes in perivascular,
peribronchiolar, and alveolar inflammatory infiltrates during immune responses.
As quantified by reverse transcription&#150;polymerase chain reaction,
significant increases were observed in levels of BAL lymphocyte mRNA encoding
NK-1 R (days 2 to 4), VIPR1 (days 2 to 4), and VIPR2 (days 4 to 6), and in
alveolar macrophage mRNA encoding NK-1 R (days 2 to 6) and VIPR1 (days 2 to 4),
but not VIPR2. Systemic treatment of mice with a selective, nonpeptide NK-1 R
antagonist reduced significantly the total numbers of leukocytes, lymphocytes,
and granulocytes retrieved by BAL on day 5 of the pulmonary immune response. The
results indicate that SP and VIP are secreted locally during pulmonary immune
responses, and are recognized by leukocytes infiltrating lung tissue, and thus
their interaction may regulate the recruitment and functions of immune cells in
lung parenchyma. <B>Kaltreider, H. B., S. Ichikawa, P. K. Byrd, D. A. Ingram,

<P>Increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines appears to be an important
factor contributing to the development of acute lung injury. In murine models,
mRNA levels of proinflammatory and im&#183;mu&#183;noregulatory cytokines,
including IL-1a, IL-1&szlig;, TGF-&szlig;1, and TNF-a, are increased in
intraparenchymal lung mononuclear cells 1 h after hemorrhage. Binding elements
for the nuclear transcriptional regulatory factors, nuclear factor &amp;kB (NF-&amp;kB),
CCAAT/enhancer binding protein &szlig; (C/EBP&szlig;), serum protein 1 (Sp1),
activator protein 1 (AP-1), and the cyclic AMP response-element binding protein
(CREB) are present in the promoter regions of numerous cytokine genes, including
those whose expression is increased after blood loss. To investigate early
transcriptional mechanisms which may be involved in regulating pulmonary
cytokine expression after hemorrhage, we examined <I>in vivo</I> activation of
these five nuclear transcriptional factors among intraparenchymal lung
mononuclear cells obtained in the immediate post-hemorrhage period. Activation
of NF-&amp;kB and CREB, but not C/EBP&szlig;, Sp1, or AP-1, was present in lung
mono&#183;nuclear cells isolated from mice 15 min after hemorrhage. Inhibition
of xanthine oxidase by prior feeding with either an allo&#183;purinol-supplemented
or a tungsten-enriched diet prevented hemorrhage-induced activation of CREB, but
not NF-&amp;kB. These results demonstrate that hemorrhage leads to rapid <I>in
vivo</I> activation in the lung of CREB through a xanthine oxidase-dependent
mechanism and of NF-&amp;kB through other pathways, and suggest that the
activation of these transcriptional factors may have an important role in reg&#183;u&#183;lat&#183;ing
pulmonary cyto&#183;kine expression and the development of acute lung injury
after blood loss. <B>Shenkar, R., and E. Abraham. 1997. Hemorrhage induces

many features of human AIDS-associated interstitial pneumonitis. To further
characterize the cellular and molecular features of this lung disease, the
temporal development of cellular infiltration, cytokine expression, and virus
replication were evaluated in lung tissue of virus-infected mice. Persistent
expression of viral RNA was detectable in lungs as early as 1 wk after
infection. Infiltration of the lungs by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, by IgG+ and IgA+
B cells, and by macrophages was observed by 4 wk after infection and continued
through 8 wk of infection. Histologically, cellular infiltration was most
pronounced in peribronchial and perivascular regions, whereas inflammation of
alveolar septae and alveolar spaces was minimal. In contrast to normals, T cells
from infected lungs were immunodeficient in that they failed to proliferate in
response to the mitogen concanavalin A (ConA). However, evaluation of cytokine
mRNA expression by interstitial lung lymphoid cells indicated that cells from
infected lungs were chronically activated, in that elevated expression of
interferon-&amp;g (IFN-&amp;g) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) was observed
throughout the course of infection. Similarly, expression by interstitial lung
lymphoid cells of mRNA for the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 and the fibrogenic
cytokine transforming growth factor-&szlig; (TGF-&szlig;) was also increased
following infection. These results indicate that retrovirus-induced
immunodeficiency in mice is associated with infiltration and chronic activation
of lymphoid cells in the lungs. Furthermore, simultaneous expression of IL-10,
IFN-&amp;g, and TGF-&szlig; suggests that cytokine-expressing cells in infected
lungs may be unresponsive to inhibitory and antiinflammatory effects of IL-10
and/or TGF-&szlig;, thus contributing to chronicity of inflammation in this
disorder. <B>Cohen, D. A., E. A. Fitzpatrick, C. Hartsfield, M. N. Gillespie,

<P>The extracellular form of superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD), SOD3, is contained
in the human lung in relatively high amounts when compared to other organs. It
has not been previously shown whether or not EC-SOD is synthesized and secreted
by specific lung cells. We examined the expression of EC-SOD mRNA in human lung
cells by <I>in situ</I> hybridization using a digoxigenin-labeled EC-SOD cRNA
probe. Strong signals of EC-SOD synthesis were found in the epithelium of all
airways. Secretory and basal cells, but not ciliated cells, were labeled for
EC-SOD mRNA. Expression of EC-SOD mRNA was found in endothelial cells lining
both arteries and veins. Many cells in the alveolar septum exhibited strong
expression of EC-SOD mRNA. In addition, epithelial cells lining the outer wall
of intrapulmonary airways and vessels were heavily labeled for EC-SOD mRNA. The
lung parenchymal epithelial cells containing EC-SOD mRNA were identified as
alveolar type II cells by colocalization with surfactant protein-A. Human
alveolar macrophages were found to contain a substantial amount of EC-SOD mRNA
expression. Alveolar type I epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells did
not display detectable signals of EC-SOD mRNA. Smooth muscle cells in muscular
arteries were not labeled by the EC-SOD mRNA probe. These results show that
airway epithelial cells and alveolar type II cells are the major cell types that
synthesize fibroblasts EC-SOD in the human lung. EC-SOD has been shown by
immunocytochemistry to be associated with the extracellular matrix around airway
epithelium and in the walls of intrapulmonary arterioles. The site of EC-SOD
localization, therefore, is closely related to the site of its synthesis. <B>Su,

<P>Cytokines released by T lymphocytes activated in the course of sarcoidosis,
e.g., interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-&amp;g (IFN-&amp;g), indicate the
presence of Th1 cells leading to the question of Th1/Th0/Th2 balance in
sarcoidosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate Th-like cytokine patterns in
different compartments of the body, i.e., peripheral blood, pulmonary
parenchyma, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), of patients with pulmonary
sarcoidosis by comparing cytokine gene expression of 167 T-cell clones derived
from the above-mentioned compartments. Seventy-nine blood, 49 transbronchial
biopsy, and 39 BAL clones were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction to
identify the respective gene transcripts. The majority of CD4+ and CD8+ blood
cells exhibited intermediate cytokine profiles (63.3%) without shifts to either
side of the spectrum (6.3% Th1, 5.1% Th2). Lung parenchyma cells shifted to the
Th1 side of the spectrum: 26.5% of the cells were of Th1 or of intermediate type
(between Th1 and Th0), whereas only 8.1% of the cells were of Th2 or of
intermediate type (between Th0 and Th2). CD8+ parenchyma cells were evenly
distributed. From BAL only CD4+ clones could be generated with shifts to both
ends of the spectrum. Thus, our data provide evidence that in sarcoidosis, at
the site of granuloma formation, an accumulation of Th1 cells as well as of
intermediate (between Th1 and Th0) cell types occurs, whereas in the alveolar
lumen, high numbers of Th1 and Th2 cells with a simultaneous decrease of Th0
cells can be observed. <B>B&auml;umer, I., G. Zissel, M. Schlaak, and J. M&uuml;ller-Quernheim.

mesothelioma cell lines to recombinant interferon-&amp;g.</A></B></P>
<P>Recombinant human interferon-gamma (r-hu-IFN-&amp;g) has been found to exert
an antitumor action <I>in vivo</I> in early stages of human malignant
mesothelioma, and an antiproliferative effect <I>in vitro</I>. In order to
study the mechanisms of cytostasis in mesothelioma cells, we examined two IFN-&amp;g-controlled
metabolic pathways known to mediate growth arrest in various cell types,
measuring production of the antiproliferative compound nitric oxide (NO) and
degradation of tryptophan in nine human mesothelioma cell lines (HMCLs)
displaying different sensitivities to the antiproliferative effect of r-hu-IFN-&amp;g.
Two rat mesothelioma cell lines were also studied. IFN-&amp;g receptor was
present and functional in HMCLs, regardless of their sensitivity to the
growth-inhibitory effect of r-hu-IFN-&amp;g. However, no NO synthase activity or
the resulting antiproliferative molecule NO were induced in HMCLs treated either
with r-hu-IFN-&amp;g alone or with a combination of r-hu-IFN-&amp;g and other
cytokines, and/or with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In responsive HMCLs, r-hu-IFN-&amp;g
induced strong indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity, which causes rapid
degradation of tryptophan; however, the correlation between r-hu-IFN-&amp;g-mediated
growth arrest and IDO induction was not absolute. In rat mesothelioma cells, NO
synthase was induced ?in response to murine IFN-&amp;g + interleukin-1&szlig;
(IL-1&szlig;) treatment, and played a role in the cytokine-mediated
antiproliferative activity. However, NO production did not seem to be the unique
antiproliferative mechanism induced by cytokines in these cells. Our results
indicate that two classical pathways accounting for some of the cytostatic
effects of IFN-&amp;g in rodent cells are not efficient in human mesothelioma
cells, and suggest that cytokine-induced growth inhibition is mediated by a
different pathway in HMCLs. <B>Phan-Bich, L., A. Buard, J.-F. Petit, L. Zeng,

<P>Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a vasoconstrictor, bronchoconstrictor, and mitogenic
peptide which is enzymatically converted from a biologically inactive big ET to
mature ET (21 amino acid) by the ET-converting enzyme (ECE). Here, we
investigate the expression of ECE-1, big ET-1, and ET-1 in the lungs of patients
with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and compare it to those of normal
subjects using immunohistochemistry and <I>in situ</I> hybridization. In normal
lungs, focal moderate expression of all three molecules is localized to airway
epithelium, pulmonary endothelium, and airway and vascular smooth muscle cells.
Serous bronchial glands also expressed ET-1 and ECE-1. In IPF, strong diffuse
expression of ECE-1 was seen in airway epithelium, proliferating type II
pneumocytes, and in endothelial and inflammatory cells. ECE-1 immunostaining was
colocalized to big ET-1 and ET-1 immunostaining, and correlated with disease
activity (<I>P</I> &lt; 0.05). To study regulatory mechanisms of ET-1 and ECE-1
expression, human normal bronchial epithelial (NBE) cells were treated with
cytokines and analyzed by radioimmunoassay and Northern blot. Incubation of
human NBE cells with IL-1a and -&szlig; or tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa)
resulted in a significant increase in ET-1 release and mRNA expression. TNFa
resulted in a significant increase in ECE-1 mRNA expression. These findings
demonstrated the colocalization of the precursor and active &#183;ET-1, and
ECE-1 in the same cell, and that ECE-1 expression is elevated in IPF. In
addition, increased expression of ET-1 and ECE-1 in IPF may be mediated by
proinflammatory cytokines. <B>Saleh, D., K. Furukawa, M.-S. Tsao, A.

1993). In the present study, we intended to investigate pathways downstream to
the phospholipase C activation which is responsible for adenosine triphosphate
(ATP)-induced mucin release in hamster tracheal epithelial cells in primary
culture. We have found that: (<I>1</I>) Ca2+ ionophores (A23187 and ionomycin)
did not affect mucin release even at 1 mM; (<I>2</I>) thapsigargin (10 mM),
either alone or in combination with ATP (20 mM), did not enhance mucin release
over its respective control group; (<I>3</I>) pretreatment of hamster tracheal
surface epithelial (HTSE) cells with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenox)ethane-N,N,N&#162;,N&#162;-tetraacetic
acid-acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM) (50 mM) did not inhibit ATP-induced mucin
release; (<I>4</I>) 4&szlig;-phorbol 12a-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 1 mM)
stimulated mucin release and its effect was completely blocked by protein kinase
C inhibitors such as sphingosine (10 mM) and calphostin C (0.1 mM), whereas
ATP-induced mucin release was blocked, only in part, by these inhibitors; (<I>5</I>)
desensitization of protein kinase C by pretreatment with PMA inhibited the
PMA-induced mucin release completely, however, ATP-induced mucin release was
inhibited only partially. We conclude that mucin release by ATP does not require
an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ level but involves the activation of
protein kinase C. The results also suggest the presence of another mechanism
separate from the phospholipase C-protein kinase C pathway for the ATP-induced
mucin release. <B>Ko, K. H., M. Jo, K. McCracken, and K. C. Kim. 1997.

<P>Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has a range of effects on a wide
variety of cells through the activation of specific purinoceptors. The aim of
this study was to establish whether P2 purinoceptors are present on airway
smooth muscle cells. Experiments were conducted on cultured rat tracheal
smooth-muscle cells (first through third passage). Intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]<I>i</I>)
was measured using Fura-2 and dual-excitation wavelength microfluorometry. The
effects of ATP, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), uridine triphosphate (UTP), and
adenosine (ADO) were measured in concentrations from 10&#190;6 to 10&#190;3 M.
At a concentration of 10&#190;4 M, the peak [Ca2+]<I>i</I> was 502 &#177; 92 nM
for ATP and 543 &#177; 76 nM for UTP (mean &#177; standard error of the mean).
ADO had no significant effect on Ca2+ release. Peak [Ca2+]<I>i</I> induced by
ATP was not dependent on extracellular Ca2 but was blocked by U-73122, an
inhibitor of phospholipase C. Pretreatment with adenosine deaminase and
desensitization with a&szlig;-MeATP had no effect on ATP-induced Ca2+ release.
The effects of ATP (10&#190;4 M) on peak [Ca2+]<I>i</I> were potentiated by the
presence of ADO 10&#190;5 M (969 &#177; 257 nM; <I>P</I> &lt; 0.05). The
presence of XAC, a blocker of A1 and A2 ADO receptors did not prevent this
effect. In the presence of XAC, ADO 10&#190;6 M potentiated the effects of ATP
(peak [Ca2+]<I>i</I>: 1,300 &#177; 229 nM). The addition of 1433U83, a blocker
of A3 ADO receptors, blocked the synergistic effect of ADO 10&#190;6 M on ATP.
These data show that P2 purinoceptors, most likely of the P2U subtype, are
present on airway smooth muscle cells and that the newly discovered A3 ADO
receptor appears to be also present. <B>Michoud, M. C., B. Tolloczko, and J. G.

</P>
<P>The American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine publishes
original papers on laboratory and clinical research and clinical observations
that are pertinent to respiratory biology and medicine and critical care. Only
papers written in English can be considered.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ats1">SUBMISSION OF MANUSCRIPTS</A></B></P>
<P>Send four copies of the manuscript, four photocopies of line drawings and
graphs, and four photographic prints of each halftone to:</P>
<P>American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine<BR>Editorial
Office<BR>5605 South Drexel Avenue<BR>Chicago, IL 60637</P>
<P>Authors are advised to keep one copy of the complete manuscript on file, as
no manuscripts or photographs will be returned. The Journal is not responsible
for manuscripts lost or damaged. Four photographic prints of all illustrations
will be required upon submission of revised manuscripts. One copy of the
manuscript and one copy of the photographic prints will remain on file in the
editorial office. Reviewers are instructed to destroy the manuscript after
review. Manuscripts that do not conform to guidelines may be returned to the
author.</P>
<P>Manuscripts are acknowledged upon receipt. When inquiring about a
manuscript, refer to the number assigned the manuscript.</P>
<P>Manuscripts judged by the Editors to be more appropriate for consideration
by the American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology will be
transferred to that editorial office for review and potential publication.
Authors will be notified of the transfer.</P>
<P>Be certain to list the FAX number of the corresponding author on the title
page. All correspondence will be by FAX only.</P>
<H2>CHECKLIST FOR SUBMISSION</H2>
<P>For your convenience, a Checklist for Submission follows these instructions.
Please complete this form and submit it with your manuscript.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ats2">HANDLING OF MANUSCRIPTS</A></B></P>
<P>Manuscripts are accepted for publication on the basis of scientific merit,
significance, and suitability for publication in a journal devoted to clinical
and laboratory studies of respiratory and critical care medicine.</P>
<P>One set of galley proofs is provided before publication of each paper and
must be returned within 48 hours of receipt. Alterations are to be kept to a
minimum and may be made only on the galley proof. Changes of content and
insertions of missing information are chargeable to the author. An offprint
order form is enclosed with galleys.</P>
<P>On publication, each report indicates the dates that the original
?manuscript and the revised manuscript (if necessary) were received at the
editorial office.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ats3">COVER LETTER</A></B></P>
<P>A cover letter listing the name, address, FAX, and telephone number (also
E-mail address if available) of the corresponding author must accompany the
manuscript. The cover letter must also state that no part of the research
presented has been funded by tobacco industry sources. If any data are derived
from subjects or animals of a previous report, this must be stated explicitly in
the cover letter. This requirement applies even if the data derived from these
experiments do not overlap.</P>
<P>The author(s) must state in this letter that the submitted material has not
been published and is not being considered for publication elsewhere. Submission
of a manuscript indicates tacit acknowledgment that all authors have made
significant contributions to the study and have read and approved the
manuscript. Any change in authorship following the original submission must be
justified and agreed to in writing by the affected author(s).</P>
<P>In addition, an Assignment of Copyright form, signed by all authors, should
accompany the manuscript. This form is included in the Journal and may be
photocopied.</P>
<P>The American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine requires that
any direct commercial association that might lead to a conflict of interest must
be disclosed by the author(s) in the covering letter of submission. This
information will be withheld from the reviewers and will not affect acceptance
for publication. At the time of publication, the information will be disclosed
in a footnote to the published manuscript. Less direct associations, such as
consultancies, stock ownerships in an author's or relative's name, patents,
etc., should be disclosed in the letter to the Editor. The extent and means of
possible disclosure will be determined by discussion with the Editor following
acceptance of the manuscript for publication.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ats4">PRIOR PUBLICATION</A></B></P>
<P>The journal does not publish original contributions that contain a
significant portion of material that has been published or submitted for
publication elsewhere, except for abstracts of not more than 400 words. A
computer search will be conducted to ensure that submissions have not been
previously published. The Editors of the Journal reserve the right to determine
what constitutes significant duplicate publication. If any material contained in
the submitted manuscript has been published or submitted for publication
elsewhere, the author(s) must include four copies of a reprint or preprint
containing this material at the time of submission.</P>
<P>Editorials and special features clearly designated as reviews may contain
previously published material as long as it is appropriately referenced. It is
the responsibility of the author(s) to submit appropriate written permission to
utilize previously published material that would otherwise violate copyright
regulations.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ats5">HUMAN AND ANIMAL STUDIES</A></B></P>
<P>The American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine endorses the
recommendations concerning human research that are contained in the Declaration
of Helsinki. The Editors reserve the right to reject any manuscript containing
studies that do not conform to these recommendations. All manuscripts reporting
human research must contain a statement in the text that the protocols were
approved by the institutional review board for human studies and that informed
written consent was obtained from the subjects or their surrogates if required
by the institutional review board.</P>
<P>Animal studies must conform to NIH guidelines (Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals, NIH Publication No. 86-23, Revised 1985, U.S. Government
Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402-9325). Descriptions of surgical
procedures on animals should include the name, dose, and route of administration
of the anesthetic agent. Paralyzing agents are not an acceptable alternative to
anesthesia and should be used only in conjunction with suitable anesthetic
agents.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ats6">MANUSCRIPTS</A></B></P>
<P>Manuscripts should be typed in 12-point type on white bond paper 21.6 by
27.9 cm (8? x 11 in) with margins of at least 2.5 cm (1 in). Double spacing
should be used throughout. All papers should be organized to include: title
page, abstract and key words, text, acknowledgments, references, figure legends,
footnotes, tables, and figures. Each of these elements should begin on a
separate page. Pages should be numbered consecutively, beginning with the
abstract.</P>
<P><B>Title Page</B></P>
<P>Titles should be limited to 85 characters. List (1) the title; (2) the first
name, middle initial, and last name of each author; (3) the name of
department(s) and institution(s) to which the work should be attributed; (4) the
name and address of the author to whom requests for reprints should be addressed
if other than the senior author or the department of origin; (5) corresponding
author's FAX and phone numbers; (6) all source(s) of support in the form of
grants, gifts, equipment, and/or drugs; and (7) a short running head of no more
than 35 characters (count letters and spaces).</P>
<P><B>Abstract</B></P>
<P>The second page should carry an abstract of not more than 200 words, written
as a single paragraph. It should be written for the readership of both
clinicians and basic investigators and should state the hypothesis or central
question of the study or investigation, the study subjects or experimental
animals, observational and analytical methods, the main findings, and a final
statement of the principal conclusions. Use only approved abbreviations.</P>
<P><B>Key Words</B></P>
<P>Below the abstract, provide and identify three to five key words or short
phrases. Use terms from the Medical Subject Headings list of the Index Medicus
whenever possible.</P>
<P><B>Text</B></P>
<P>The text of articles should usually, but not necessarily, be divided into
the following sections: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. Long
articles may require subheadings within some sections to clarify the contents,
especially the Results and Discussion sections.</P>
<P>Manuscripts should be concise. Excessive length will reduce the likelihood
of acceptance of the manuscript for publication.</P>
<P>The introduction should have a clear statement of the hypothesis or central
question, any background material and supporting evidence, with an explanation
of the experimental approach.</P>
<P>Statements referring to work in progress or in prospect that imply future
publication, in the Journal or elsewhere, should not be used. Unpublished work
should not be cited in References, but may be cited fully parenthetically within
the text. Written permission from the author for citation of unpublished work
should accompany the manuscript.</P>
<P>All cases of tuberculosis and all designators of mycobacteria should be
classified according to the 1990 edition of Diagnostic Standards and
Classification of Tuberculosis, published by the American Lung Association.</P>
<P>Generic names of drugs should be used instead of trade names. The location
(city, state, country) of a manufacturer listed in the text should be provided
after the first reference to the manufacturer.</P>
<P>Terms and symbols pertaining to pulmonary physiology should conform to the
definitions and style set forth in the &quot;ATS Committee Report on Pulmonary
Physiology Symbols.&quot;</P>
<P>A laboratory or chemical term or a disease process may be abbreviated only
after it has been written in full at least once with the abbreviation in
parentheses immediately after it, as in interstitial lung disease (ILD). Some
common terms may always be abbreviated such as Po{, Cco{, N, CO, Paco{, Pvco{,
Sao{, aaPo{, Dlco, FVC, FEV1, etc. Other terms should be defined the first time
the term is used. Abbreviations should not begin a sentence. Specialized jargon
should be avoided.</P>
<P>Units of measurement should conform to current scientific usage and can be
abbreviated when they follow a number (e.g., cm, nm, ml, g, mg, nmol, ?C) but
not otherwise. Unusual units should be defined.</P>
<P>Statistical methods must be described. The standard error of the mean (?
SEM) must be distinguished from the standard deviation (? SD).</P>
<P><B>Acknowledgments</B></P>
<P>All acknowledgments should be grouped into one paragraph and placed after
the Discussion.</P>
<P><B>References</B></P>
<P>References should be limited to 35 entries, typed double spaced, should
begin on a separate sheet, and be numbered in the order that they appear in the
text. All authors' names (do not use &quot;et al.&quot;), complete article
titles, and articles in press should be included. Supply inclusive page numbers.
Submitted manuscripts which have not been accepted for publication are
considered as unpublished work and should not be included in the references. If
an article cited in References is in press, ITfour copies of that article should
be included with the submitted manuscript.</P>
<P>Use abbreviations for the names of all journals in the provided list or in
Index Medicus. Spell out the names of journals that are not listed.</P>
<P>A reference for the statistical methods used should be cited.</P>

<P><B><A NAME="ats9">Tables</A></B></P>
<P>Tables should be configured to fit vertically on the printed page. They will
be typeset to fit a width of 3? inches (9 centimeters) for single column or up
to 7? inches (18? centimeters) for double column. Tables that do not fit into
this format will be returned for reworking.</P>
<P>Each table should be typed double spaced on a separate sheet. Do not submit
tables as photographs. Tables should be numbered consecutively, have a brief
title, and be cited in text.</P>
<P>Avoid arbitrary labels or classifications, such as groups A and B, when
specific descriptors, such as &quot;control&quot; and &quot;hypoxia&quot; can be
used.</P>
<P>All non-standard abbreviations used in each table should be explained in
footnotes. For footnotes, use the following symbols in this sequence: *, dagger,
double dagger, section sign, XXX, XXX, **, DAG, etc.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ats10">Illustrations</A></B></P>
<P>Four photocopies of line drawings and graphs, and four photographic prints
of each halftone should be submitted with the manuscript. Four photographic
prints of all illustrations, will be required upon submission of revised
manuscripts. Illustrations must be good quality, unmounted glossy prints, sized
so they can be reduced to a width of 3? inches (9 centimeters) for single
column, and not exceeding 7? inches (18? centimeters) for double column. The
size of the symbols and lettering should be in scale with the figure. All
figures within an article should be the same point size. Multipart figures
should be submitted as single composites, with each panel labeled (e.g., A, B).
In general, computer graphics are discouraged, as they may not provide adequate
reproducibility; we reserve the right to request glossy prints and to return
unacceptable configurations for additional cropping and/or vertical orientation
at the author's expense.</P>
<P>Color prints are preferred to transparencies. The cost of publishing color
prints will be borne by the author. After being informed of the cost, the author
will be required to confirm in writing acceptance of the charges. If the color
quote is not accepted, the author must indicate whether the figure should be
printed in black and white or deleted.</P>
<P>The abscissa and ordinate of each graph should be labeled clearly.</P>
<P>The back of each illustration should be marked with its number, the first
author's name, and the top indicated. Mark lightly or use a label; do not use
paperclips on figures. The title should appear in the figure legend, not on the
figure.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ats11">Legends for Illustrations</A></B></P>
<P>Legends for illustrations should convey the findings and be typed double
spaced, start on a separate page with arabic numerals corresponding to the
illustrations. When symbols, arrows, numbers, or letters are used to identify
parts of the illustrations, each one should be identified and explained clearly
in the legend.</P>
<P>In photomicrographs, explain internal scale and identify the method of
staining.</P>
<P>Each figure should be cited in text.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ats12">CASE REPORTS</A></B></P>
<P>The presentation of Case Reports should be similar to that of major
articles, but in most circumstances should not exceed 10 typewritten pages
including references.</P>
<P>Case Reports should provide new information concerning etiology, mechanism,
or management of a disease process. Collections of several cases are more
desirable than reports of single cases. The new information must be
substantiated by scientific, rather than circumstantial, evidence. Reports of
coexistence of two diseases or conditions without proof of causal relation are
discouraged.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ats13">BRIEF COMMUNICATIONS</A></B></P>
<P>In general, Brief Communications are concise articles with significant new
observations, whether experimental or clinical. These manuscripts should not be
longer than 10 double-spaced typewritten pages including references. The format
described for major articles, including illustrations and tables, should be
followed.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ats14">RAPID COMMUNICATIONS</A></B></P>
<P>Rapid Communications should communicate new information that justifies
priority review. These papers will be reviewed externally one time only, and the
decision to publish with revision or to reject will be made at that time. These
papers also will be given priority for publication date. Rapid publications
should focus upon data of a narrow scope; papers should be formatted exactly as
Brief Communications (see above). Length may not exceed 10 double-spaced
typewritten pages including references.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ats15">SPECIAL FEATURES</A></B></P>
<P>Special features, such as Editorials, Clinical Commentaries, Pulmonary
Perspectives, and States of the Art, are published after review by the Editor
and, when appropriate, by one or more referees. Individuals who wish to
contribute any of these features should send a written proposal to the Editor
before completion and submission of the manuscript. Please note that feature
articles must conform to the general guidelines for all manuscripts.</P>
<P><B>Editorials</B></P>
<P>Editorials are invited by the Editor. If you wish to write one, please send
a written proposal to the Editor.</P>
<P><B>Clinical Commentaries and Pulmonary Perspectives</B></P>
<P>These review articles should not exceed 12 double-spaced, type-written pages
and may contain no more than 35 references. They may not include any previously
unpublished data. Clinical Commentaries focus on the clinical aspects of a
particular subject, while Pulmonary Perspectives focus on the more scientific
aspects of the subject.</P>
<P><B>States of the Art</B></P>
<P>These are broad, comprehensive, scholarly works, which are considerably
longer than the other types of review articles. Generally, these articles are
25-40 double-spaced, type-written pages, including references.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ats16">LETTERS TO THE EDITOR</A></B></P>
<P>Letters to the Editor provide a format to discuss previously published
material or controversies. Presentations of unpublished investigations are not
appropriate as Letters but rather should be submitted as Brief Communications
which will be subject to peer review. Letters that confirm previously published
material without adding significant new information are less likely to be
published. Because of space limitations, priorities will be assigned to
submitted Letters, and publication will depend on this priority rating.</P>
<P>Letters to the Editor should be no longer than 500 words (two double-spaced,
typewritten pages) and should be accompanied by a signature. Titles are used
with Letters to the Editor. Illustrations and tables are discouraged. References
are included parenthetically in the body of the letter unless several are cited,
in which case they may be presented as footnotes. Otherwise, there are no
footnotes.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ats17">PAGE CHARGES</A></B></P>
<P>There is a basic charge for original manuscripts, Brief Communications, and
Case Reports of $40 per printed page. All manuscripts for original articles,
brief communications, and case reports submitted after February 1, 1996 will be
subject to increased page charges at the rate of $75 per printed page. Authors
will be billed for the charges.</P>

Office.)</P>

</P>
<P>The American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine publishes
supplement issues containing the proceedings of sponsored symposia providing
that the topic of a conference is not limited to a single product with
commercial potential. Written requests regarding potential publication of the
symposium should originate from the scientific coordinator(s) of the meeting,
not an employee of the sponsoring organization. Meeting content must be at the
sole discretion of the scientific coordinator(s). After review of the topic and
content of the meeting, the Editor may agree to provisional publication, but the
final decision concerning publication will not be made until manuscripts from
the entire symposium have undergone review. The American Journal of Respiratory
and Critical Care Medicine reserves the right to determine whether material is
acceptable for publication.</P>
<P>Symposia usually present previously published data which is appropriately
acknowledged. Discussion of the importance of findings in the literature and
directions for future research are encouraged. Data which has not been published
previously may be included in the symposium, but must undergo peer review and
meet criteria for publication similar to original manuscripts submitted for
publication in the Journal. Because of space limitations, it may not be possible
to include sufficient background material, e.g., methods, etc., that would
permit acceptance for publication of previously unpublished material.
Furthermore, publication of such material, even in abbreviated form, will
preclude future reproduction of this material, in part or in toto, in an
original manuscript in the Journal or any other journal. The Journal does not
allow publication of material which will be published in an original article at
a later date. The requirement for formal peer review of single examples
demonstrating new techniques or pilot experiments may be waived by the Editor
providing that these provisional data are not utilized to reach a definite
scientific conclusion. However, the exclusion regarding future publication of
this material will remain in effect. These restrictions pertain only to material
contained in the published proceedings of the symposium and not to oral
presentations at the meeting itself. If authors have uncertainty concerning
these policies, they are encouraged to contact the Editor prior to submission of
manuscripts.</P>
<P><B>Submission of Manuscripts</B></P>
<P>All supplement manuscripts should be submitted by the scientific
coordinator(s) of the meeting who is responsible for assuring that the contents
accurately reflect the proceedings of the symposium. Send three copies of each
manuscript and three photographic prints of each illustration to:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>American Journal of Respiratory and<BR>Critical Care Medicine<BR>Managing
Editor<BR>American Thoracic Society<BR>1740 Broadway<BR>New York, NY
10019-4374</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Indicate in the covering letter that the manuscripts are being submitted for
a supplement issue. Only papers written in English can be considered. The
scientific coordinator(s) and authors are advised to keep one copy of the
complete manuscripts on file. The journal is not responsible for manuscripts
lost or damaged.</P>
<P><B>Handling of Manuscripts</B></P>
<P>The Editor of the Journal generally reviews supplement issues personally and
corresponds directly with the scientific coordinator(s) and authors regarding
the review process and acceptability. As noted above, previously unpublished
material is likely to require additional peer review with outside referees. Upon
receipt of the manuscripts, a price quotation will be prepared. Pending
acceptability of the manuscripts by the Editor, written acceptance of the quote
will be required.</P>
<H4><B>INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTRIBUTORS OF SUPPLEMENT ISSUES</B></H4>
<P><B>Manuscripts</B></P>
<P>Manuscripts should be typed in 12-point type on white bond paper 21.6 by
27.9 cm (8? x 11 in) with margins of at least 2.5 cm (1 in). Double spacing
should be used throughout. All papers should be organized to include: title
page, text, acknowledgments, references, figure legends, footnotes, tables, and
figures. Each of these elements should begin on a separate page. Pages should be
numbered consecutively, beginning with the title page.</P>
<P><B>Title Page</B></P>
<P>Titles should be limited to 85 characters. List (1) the title; (2) the first
name, middle initial, and last name of each author; (3) the name of
department(s) and institution(s) to which the work should be attributed; (4) the
name and address of the author to whom requests for reprints should be addressed
if other than the senior author or the department of origin; (5) corresponding
author's FAX and phone numbers; (6) all source(s) of support in the form of
grants, gifts, equipment, and/or drugs; and(7) a short running head of no more
than 35 characters (count letters and spaces) for continuation headings.</P>
<P><B>Text</B></P>
<P>The text of articles should usually, but not necessarily, be divided into
the following sections: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. Long
articles may require subheadings within some sections to clarify the contents,
especially the Results and Discussion sections.</P>
<P>Manuscripts should be concise. Excessive length will reduce the likelihood
of acceptance of the manuscript for publication.</P>
<P>The introduction should have a clear statement of the hypothesis or central
question, any background material and supporting evidence, with an explanation
of the experimental approach.</P>
<P>Statements referring to work in progress or in prospect that imply future
publication, in the Journal or elsewhere, should not be used. Unpublished work
should not be cited in References, but may be cited fully parenthetically within
the text. Written permission from the author for citation of unpublished work
should accompany the manuscript.</P>
<P>All cases of tuberculosis and all designators of mycobacteria should be
classified according to the 1990 edition of Diagnostic Standards and
Classification of Tuberculosis, published by the American Lung Association.</P>
<P>Generic names of drugs should be used instead of trade names. The location
(city, state, country) of a manufacturer listed in the text should be provided
after the first reference to the manufacturer.</P>
<P>Terms and symbols pertaining to pulmonary physiology should conform to the
definitions and style set forth in the &quot;ATS Committee Report on Pulmonary
Physiology Symbols.&quot;</P>
<P>A laboratory or chemical term or a disease process may be abbreviated only
after it has been written in full at least once with</P>
<P>the abbreviation in parentheses immediately after it, as in interstitial
lung disease (ILD). Some common terms may always be abbreviated such as Po$2,
Pco$2, N$2, CO, Paco$2, Pvco$2, Sao$2, aaPo$2, Dlco, FVC, FEV$1, etc. Other
terms should be defined the first time the term is used. Abbreviations should
not begin a sentence. Specialized jargon should be avoided.</P>
<P>Units of measurement should conform to current scientific usage and can be
abbreviated when they follow a number (e.g., cm, nm, ml, g, mg, nmol, ?C) but
not otherwise. Unusual units should be defined.</P>
<P>Statistical methods must be described. The standard error of the mean (?
SEM) must be distinguished from the standard deviation (? SD).</P>
<P><B>Acknowledgments</B></P>
<P>All acknowledgments should be grouped into one paragraph and placed after
the Discussion.</P>
<P><B>References</B></P>
<P>References should be limited to 35 entries, typed double spaced, should
begin on a separate sheet, and be numbered in the order that they appear in the
text. All authors' names (do not use &quot;et al.&quot;), complete article
titles, and articles in press should be included. Supply inclusive page numbers.
Submitted manuscripts which have not been accepted for publication are
considered as unpublished work and should not be included in the references. If
an article cited in References is in press, ITfour copies of that article should
be included with the submitted manuscript.</P>
<P>Use abbreviations for the names of all journals in the provided list or in
Index Medicus. Spell out the names of journals that are not listed.</P>
<P>A reference for the statistical methods used should be cited.</P>

<P><B>Tables</B></P>
<P>Each table should be typed double spaced on a separate sheet. Do not submit
tables as photographs. Tables should be numbered consecutively, have a brief
title, and be cited in text.</P>
<P>Avoid arbitrary labels or classifications, such as groups A and B, when
specific descriptors, such as &quot;control&quot; and &quot;hypoxia&quot; can be
used.</P>
<P>All non-standard abbreviations used in each table should be explained in
footnotes. For footnotes, use the following symbols in this sequence: *, dagger,
subsection, doubledagger, bold dagger, **, DAG, etc.</P>
<P><B>Illustrations</B></P>
<P>Three photographic prints and one xerographic copy of each illustration
should be submitted with the manuscript. Illustrations must be good quality,
unmounted glossy prints, sized so they can be reduced to a width of 3? inches (9
cm) for single column, and not exceeding 7? inches (18? cm) for double column.
The size of the symbols and lettering should be in scale with the figure. In
legends for photomicrographs and electron micrographs, the stain used, method of
preparation, and magnification should be included. In general, computer graphics
are discouraged, as they may not provide adequate reproducibility; we reserve
the right to request glossy prints.</P>
<P>The abscissa and ordinate of each graph should be labeled clearly.</P>
<P>The back of each illustration should be marked with its number, the first
author's name, and the top indicated. Mark lightly or use a label; do not use
paperclips on figures. Clearly label parts (e.g., A, B) on the figure itself.
The title should appear in the figure legend, not on the figure.</P>
<P><B>Legends for Illustrations</B></P>
<P>Legends for illustrations should convey the findings and be typed double
spaced, start on a separate page with arabic numerals corresponding to the
illustrations. When symbols, arrows, numbers, or letters are used to identify
parts of the illustrations, each one should be identified and explained clearly
in the legend.</P>
<P>In photomicrographs, explain internal scale and identify the method of
staining.</P>
<P>Each figure should be cited in text.</P>
<P><B>Proofreading</B></P>
<P>One set of the galley proofs and an offprint order form will be sent to the
corresponding author of each manuscript and must be returned within 48 hours of
receipt. Alterations are to be kept to a minimum and may be made only on the
galley proof.</P>

<P><B><A NAME="ATS1">Introduction</A></B></P>
<P>The AJRCMB publishes papers that report significant and original
observations in the area of pulmonary biology. The focus of the journal
includes, but is not confined to, cellular, biochemical, molecular,
developmental, genetic, and immunologic studies of lung cells and molecules.
Acceptance of manuscripts will be based on scientific excellence, importance,
and clarity of presentation. Manuscripts judged more appropriate for
consideration by the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine
will be transferred to that editorial office and authors will be notified. Any
individual who wishes to submit a &quot;Mini-review&quot; or &quot;Perspective&quot;
is requested to contact the Editor before submitting the manuscript.</P>
<P>Manuscripts will be processed as rapidly as possible. Efforts will be made
to complete the review process in three to four weeks. If an author believes
that a manuscript merits an accelerated review, this should be noted in the
cover letter to the Editor. If the request is approved by the Editor, the
manuscript will be preferentially handled so that rapid review is ensured (see
RAPID PUBLICATIONS below).</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ATS2">Receipt of Manuscript</A></B></P>
<P>Receipt of each manuscript will be acknowledged and each manuscript will
receive a number for identification purposes. Dates of submission of original
and revised manuscripts will be published. Receipt of a manuscript by the AJRCMB
is interpreted as indicating that the data are original and have not been
published elsewhere except as an abstract and have not been submitted for
publication elsewhere.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ATS3">Manuscript Submittal</A></B></P>
<P>Manuscripts should be sent in quadruplicate to:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>@American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology<BR>Editorial
Office<BR>8260 East Raintree<BR>Scottsdale, AZ 85260</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Manuscripts should be concisely written and should contain complete
documentation of results. References should be selected to document key ideas
and observations. Manuscripts must be written in English. Manuscripts should be
typed double-spaced throughout on 8.5 x 11-inch white paper on one side only
with margins of 1 inch. Pages must be numbered. All papers should include: (a)
title page, (b) abstract, (c) text, (d) acknowledgments, (e) references, (f)
figure legends, (g) footnotes, (h) tables, and (i) figures. Each section (a-i)
should begin on a separate page.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ATS4">Cover Letter</A></B></P>
<P>A cover letter must accompany each manuscript. It should identify the
corresponding author, state that the material is original and has not been
submitted for publication elsewhere, and indicate if the manuscript is one of a
series for which simultaneous publication is requested. It must also state that
no part of the research presented has been funded by tobacco industry sources.
The letter must include a statement indicating that all authors have read the
manuscript and approve its submission. To facilitate the review process, the
cover letter should include the names of four or five potential reviewers
together with their addresses and telephone numbers. Requests for rapid
publication should be made in the cover letter together with a brief explanation
of the rationale (see RAPID PUBLICATIONS below).</P>
<P>The AJRCMB Assignment of Copyright form, signed by all authors, must
accompany the manuscript submission. A blank form is provided in the Journal and
may be photocopied.</P>
<P>The Journal requires that any direct commercial association that might lead
to a conflict of interest must be disclosed by the author(s) in the cover
letter. This information will be withheld from reviewers and will not affect
acceptance for publication. At the time of publication, the information will be
disclosed in a footnote to the published manuscript. Less direct associations,
such as consultancies, stock ownerships in an author's or relative's name,
patents, etc., should be disclosed in a letter to the Editor. The extent and
means of possible disclosure will then be determined by discussion with the
Editor.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ATS5">Manuscripts</A></H2>
<P><B>Title Page</B></P>
<P>The title should be concise and descriptive. The complete name, degree level
(e.g., M.D., Ph.D.), and departmental and institutional affiliation of each
author should appear on the title page. In addition, the name and address of the
author to whom correspondence should be addressed must be indicated and must
include telephone and fax numbers (also e-mail address if available). The Editor
endorses the principle that authorship should be limited to those who have had a
substantive role in the work described in the manuscript. A running title of no
more than 60 characters (count letters and spaces), with no abbreviations,
should be included.</P>
<P><B>Abstract</B></P>
<P>The abstract should present in 250 words or less a summary of the
hypothesis, methodology, observations, and conclusions of the study. It should
be appropriate as written for use by abstracting services. References should be
avoided but, if used, should be presented in full rather than by number.</P>
<P><B>Abbreviations</B></P>
<P>Use abbreviations listed in the Instructions for Contributors, included in
each issue of the AJRCMB. For other terms frequently used, the terms should be
written out completely at first use, abbreviated in parentheses, and abbreviated
thereafter. All terms accompanied by corresponding abbreviations should be
listed in a single footnote on a separate page.</P>
<P><B>Source of Materials</B></P>
<P>Generic names of drugs should be used instead of trade names. The location
(city, state, country) of a manufacturer listed in the text should be provided
after the first reference to the manufacturer.</P>
<P>Publication in the AJRCMB implies that DNA clones, cells, antibodies, or
similar materials will be made available to all qualified investigators. Nucleic
acid or protein sequences should be deposited in EMBL or Genbank data bases and
accession numbers submitted prior to publication of manuscripts.</P>
<P><B>Text</B></P>
<P>The text should include the following sections: Introduction, Materials and
Methods, Results, and Discussion. If a manuscript varies from this format, the
rationale for the change should be explained in the cover letter. Subheadings
may be used if desired.</P>
<P><B>Acknowledgments</B></P>
<P>Acknowledgments should be placed after the Discussion.</P>
<P><B>References</B></P>
<P>References should be typed double-spaced beginning on a separate sheet. They
should be numbered in the order that they appear in the text. All authors' names
(do not use &quot;et al.&quot;), complete article titles, and inclusive page
numbers should be included. The titles of journals should be abbreviated
according to the style used in Index Medicus. If an article cited in References
is in press, three copies of that article should be included with the submitted
manuscript.</P>
<UL>
<LI> A reference for the statistical methods used should be cited.
</LI>
<LI> Unpublished observations and personal communications should be referred to
as such in the text. Submit written permission when citing a personal
communication.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>Manuscripts &quot;submitted for publication&quot; are considered unpublished
work and should not be included in the reference list. They should be cited in
parentheses in the text as &quot;unpublished data&quot; or &quot;unpublished
observations.&quot;</P>

<P><B><A NAME="ATS7">Footnotes</A></B></P>
<P>Footnotes should be numbered consecutively. Designate footnotes to
author/affiliation and tables by these superscript symbols and in this order: *,
dagger, double dagger, subsection, bold dagger, etc.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ATS8">Tables</A></B></P>
<P>Tables should be typed double-spaced on separate sheets. Tables should be
numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals and should have a short title. Use
superscript symbols for footnotes (see Footnotes). Each table should be
self-explanatory.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ATS9">Illustrations</A></B></P>
<P>Four photographic prints of each illustration should be submitted with the
manuscript. Figures should be numbered with Arabic numerals, and composite
figures should be labeled with lowercase letters (e.g., Figure 3b).
Illustrations should not exceed the page dimensions (17.4 x 21.3 cm);
single-column illustrations should not exceed 8.4 x 21.3 cm, and double-column
figures should not exceed 17.4 x 21.3 cm. Light and electron micrographs should
be submitted so that they can be published without reduction and should be
composed to fill the width of either a single or double column. Photographs of
gels may be submitted at reproduction size or may be reduced upon publication;
the author should state amount of reduction required. If needed, figures may be
reduced for better layout.</P>
<P>Micrographs should be carefully cropped and should be of sufficient
magnification to illustrate important observations. Micrographs should include
internal scales; legends should not contain the magnification. Three sets of
micrographs for reviewers may be mounted on lightweight cardboard; a
reproduction set should be submitted unmounted. Unmounted illustrations must be
lightly labeled on the back with the author's name, figure number, and an arrow
to indicate the top. Labels should be 3 to 4 mm in height. Paper clips should
not be used on illustrations.</P>
<P>Color photomicrographs will entail cost to the author. Color prints are
preferred to transparencies. The cost of color publishing will be borne by the
author. After being informed of the cost, the author will be required to confirm
in writing acceptance of the charges.</P>
<P>Legends should present a short title and sufficient explanation to be
intelligible without reference to the text.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ATS10">Proofs</A></B></P>
<P>Galley proofs will be provided before publication. The author must correct
and return the proofs within 48 hours. Changes other than editorial or
typsetting errors will be charged to the author.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ATS11">Offprints</A></B></P>
<P>An offprint order form will be included with the galley proofs.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ATS12">Disk Submission</A></B></P>
<P>After a manuscript has been reviewed and the final revisions are accepted,
authors are strongly encouraged to submit the final version on disk within seven
days, accompanied by a hard-copy printout including the tables. On the disk's
label, specify the file name, MS-DOS or Macintosh, and the word-processing
software used. WordPerfect or Microsoft Word files are preferred, but all files
are acceptable. Any material submitted on disk must be accompanied by hard-copy
printout.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ATS13">Rapid Publications</A></B></P>
<P>Concise reports of original observations of sufficient importance that their
rapid publication would substantially enhance research in the field will be
considered for rapid editorial review and decision. These should be definitive
studies, fully documented and referenced. Editors will provide decisions within
three weeks of receipt and accepted manuscripts that require limited revision
will be published three to four months after receipt. Editorial decisions may
not be accompanied by the usual detailed reviewers' comments.</P>
<P>Request for, and justification of, rapid publication should be made in the
author's cover letter. The entire publication, including figures, tables,
acknowledgments, footnotes, and references, must fit within four journal pages.
This is equivalent to 16 to 18 typed pages using lines no more than 72 elite or
60 pica characters including spaces, and with double-spaced pages containing no
more than 25 typed lines. Micrographs are counted as one page and each graph is
counted as one-half page. Manuscripts not accepted for rapid publication may be
resubmitted for consideration as a regular manuscript.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ATS14">Cover</A></B></P>
<P>Cover illustrations will be chosen each month from an article appearing in
the journal. The choice of cover illustration will be made by the Editor, but
authors are encouraged to submit suitable figures and accompanying legends at
the time of submission of an article. Color figures will be published on the
cover without charge; normal plate charges will continue to apply for color
figures used within an article. If desired, a figure may be published in black
and white within an article and in color on the cover. If a black-and-white
illustration is to be used within an article, only one color print should be
submitted for consideration as a cover illustration. The dimensions of cover
illustrations should be 6.5 x 5.6 inches (width x height). Upon request, unused
color plates submitted as possible cover illustrations will be returned to the
authors. Reprints of the cover will not be available.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ATS15">Page Charges</A></B></P>
<P>There is a basic charge of $40 per printed page. Authors will be billed for
the charges.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>The California Thoracic Society (CTS) is the
professional society dedicated to preventing lung disease and promoting lung
health in California.  It is the largest Chapter of the American Thoracic
Society and the medical section of the 18 American Lung Associations throughout
the state.</B></FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1">In addition, CTS is a specialty society officially
recognized by the California Medical Association (CMA).This provides direct CTS
representation on the CMA Chest Disease Panel, its Council on Legislation, its
Young Physicians' Section, and its governing body, the House of Delegates.</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1">CTS activities focus on clinical pulmonary and critical
care practice issues, education, government and payer policies. Major CTS
professional activities include an annual  two-day CME-BRN conference,
development and dissemination of professional guidelines and patient education
items, advocacy for quality lung care coverage.</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1">The Society is 750 members strong, including pulmonary
physicians, critical care specialists, internists, pediatric pulmonologists,
allergists, thoracic surgeons, PhDs, RCPs,  RN specialists, and CPTs.</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1">Members receive communication from CTS at least
bi-monthly via the CTS News and CTS President's Memo.  Belonging to this
prestigious Society provides advance invitation to CTS courses at reduced
registration fees, advisory memos and announcements of key emerging trends in
lung health care, listing in the CTS Membership Directory, access to full time
lobbyists in Sacramento, and opportunities to participate in the CTS committee
structure. CTS has unique pulmonary service programs for ABG-Coox Proficiency
Testing (CLIA approved) and Site Visit Consultations for Pulmonary Function
Laboratories.</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1">Membership in CTS advances recognition as a health
provider committed to quality lung care in California.  Belonging also offers
relevant information, opportunities to network and to shape CTS policy by
recommending projects, offering feedback to polls,  and serving on committees
and task forces.</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1">Every California health care professional who is
committed to quality lung and critical care will find that CTS fits the needs,
and provides information that cannot be found elsewhere.  CTS enhances the image
of the pulmonary professional. CTS also promotes key values such as patient
access to specialty care and advocacy for pulmonary public health, research, the
practice of pulmonary medicine, and bioethics.</FONT></B></P>
