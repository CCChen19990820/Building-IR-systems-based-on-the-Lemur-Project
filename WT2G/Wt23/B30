When she moved to the east coast her studies expanded to include painting and sculpture.  Throughout the 70s, she gave concerts, workshops, and multi-media presentations all over the eastern seaboard.  By the end of the decade, her own label was established and her first albums of meditative and sacred spacemusic, SKIES ABOVE SKIES and SUNBORNE, were released.<p>"Constance Demby is one of the brightest stars on the Hearts of Spacelabel....she's truly the queen of spacemusic.

Yet, somewhere in some dim memory, there is a faint memory-echo - rich and compelling - calling up  archetypal experiences which access and activate the deeper, more profound levels of the mind-body-spirit.  Over the years she has mastered matching an emotion to its complimentary tonal resonation, producing albums that consistantly deliver powerful cathartic experiences.<BR><BR>		During the 70's she reached for the penultimate in sound when she conceived and constructed the first Sonic Steel Instruments, the Space Bass and the <a href="sail.gif">Whale Sail,</a> (huge sheets of stainless steel played with bows) which generate deep, resonante primordial sounds.  The Space Bass is a horizontal 10 ft sheet of mirror finish stainless steel with 5 octaves of rods attached to a bar.  The rods are either struck percussively or bowed with bass bows.   The sounds waves on the lower notes are purported to be 30 ft long.  The Whale Sail, the cetacean sister of the Space Bass, is a vertical 8 ft sheet strung with wires that are also bowed. <BR><BR>	The petals of her musical flower began to open further upon her return to her native area (Northern California) in 1980.  Here her experimentation with electronic instrumentation began. Two years later, SACRED SPACE MUSIC was released, an enduring album featuring hammered dulcimer, acoustic piano, and synthesizer.<BR><BR>	Demby's studio turned fully electronic with the arrival of digital sampling keyboards, and NOVUS MAGNIFICAT was born in 1986, considered "the Mozart Requiem of the New Age."  SET FREE (1989) was hailed as a "...first-rate release by an artist in her prime."  Several international tours followed:  Europe, Egypt, South America, Canary Islands, Japan, Indonesia and beyond.   Her most recent release, AETERNA (1995)  has been termed, "...the music of the 21st century....sure to become a classic." <BR><BR>	To date, Demby continues to focus on composing contemporary orchestral albums in her home studio, using an impressive array of the latest electronic instruments, digital sampling synthesizers and recording technology. She is especially interested in the transformational power of music and its ability to elevate human consciousness.  <BR><BR><hr>Return to:|   <a href="demby.html">Constance Demby</a>  |  <a href="portalmk.html">Portal Market</a>  |  <a href="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>    |<p><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

Healing with the aid of sound and music was a highly developed science in the ancient mystery schools. This healing was based on concepts of life that recognized vibration as the fundamental creative force.<p> Matter can be said to be frozen music,or vibrations that have been slowed down to the realm of the physical where they coalesce into matter.<p>Music - in its higher forms - has the power to lower blood pressure, alter the breathing rate, reorganize and harmonize molecular structure, relax the body, elevate mood, take us beyond the mental world to the spiritual world, transform consciouness and liberate our spirit.<p>Sound waves enter into our physical body and move the atoms around,rearranging our cellular structure,and putting it back in order.<p>Some music will actually diss-arrange or de-range it, and there have been studies done by Dorothy Retallack on plants to prove this. Plants played Bach and similar music did very well, plants played acid rock music were disheveled and had stunted growth, and plants played spiritual devotional music had luxurious growth and more organized harmonious patterns.<p>Music affects the physical body in profound ways. There are doctors in the south of France who prescribe specific pieces of musicto be listened to 3 times a day in place of medicine.<p> Music holds the key to remembering our origin and recontacing source.Our spirit, regardless of nationality, creed, time or space recognizes sound as the doorway to the infinite. Hence, music is the universal language.<p>Sound and Light are the building blocks of the universe, the very framework upon which all of creation is hung.<p> Every molecule of matter is intoning its tone. Every leaf, atom, particle, planet, galaxy, every cell in our body is humming it own tune. Even as we were being born, as our bodies were being formed a chord was being intoned, our own individual chord.<p> "A tone is a living cell... It has the power of reproduction, of making exchanges, of growing. It is a microcosom reflecting faithfully the macrocosom, its laws, its center. A tone is a solar system."	- DaneRudyar<p><blockquote>If music be the food of love,it can be nourishment for our souls,harmony for our cells.<br>If dis-ease is dis-harmony within the cells, dis-harmony within the being,then dis-ease is most likely spiritual in nature. <br>Separateness from Source  --  Separateness from Self<p>The right kind of musiccan help one remember thatconnection with Source.<p>For healing, in the body, mind or spirit, comes when we rememberwho we are,where we come from,and why we are here.</blockquote><p>"The Hindu tradition teaches us that Sound is God - "Nada Brahma". That is, musical sound and the musical experience are steps to the realization of the self. Music is viewed as a spiritual discipline that raises one's inner being to divine peacefulness and bliss. The highest aim of music is to reveal the essence of the universe it reflects, and music is the means by which this essence can be comprehended. Through music, one can reach God."Ravi Shankar<p><blockquote><b>I AM MUSIC</b><p>"I am music,most ancient of the arts.I am more than ancient:I am eternal.<p>Even before life commenced upon this earth, I was here - in the winds and the waves.<p> When the first trees and flowers and grasses appeared, I was among them.<p>And when Man came,I at once became the most delicate,most subtle, and most powerful mediumfor the expression of Man's emotions.<p>When men were little better than beasts, I influenced them for their good.<p>In all ages I have inspired men with hope, kindled their love, given a voice to their joys, cheered them on to valorous deeds,and soothed them in times of despair.<p>I have played a great part in the drama of Life, whose end and purpose isthe complete perfection of man's nature.<p> Through my influencehuman nature has been uplifted,sweetened and refined.With the aid of men,I have become a Fine Art.<p>From Tubalcain to Thomas Edisona long line of the brightest mindshave devoted themselvesto the perfection of instrumentsthrough which men may utilize my powersand enjoy my charms.<p>I have myriads of voices and instruments. I am in the hearts of all peoples and on their tongues, in all lands and among all cultures:the ignorant and unlettered know me,not less than the rich and learned.<p>For I speak to all peoples, in a language that all understand. Even the deaf hear me,if they but listen to the voices of their own souls.<p> I am the food of love.I have taught men gentleness and peace:and I have led them onward to heroic deeds. I comfort the lonely,and I harmonize the discord of crowds.I am a necessary luxury to all men.<p>I am MUSIC."<p></blockquote>Allen Inman<p><b>Related site</b><p><li><a href="http://www.bison.com/healing.html">Healing by Sound</a><p><hr><center><h3>Testimonials on the Healing Power of Constance Demby's Music</h3></center><p>Letters from Listeners - Healings with the music<p> <blockquote>"...<B>.I am writing to you from the intensive care unit of Kaiser Hospital </B>and this is a letter of gratitude. I have just had my first and I hope, last heartattack. In addition to pain, I have had to cope with fear, and your music has helped me do that. Last night, my heart attacked me again in spite of isordyl, tagamet, heparin, nitroglycerin, attenuol and expert nursing care. The chemicals did not make the pain go away. What made it go away was your music. I needed to be reminded that it was my body, not my being, that was in jeopardy. Yourmusic is obviously not created for your personal fame and fortune.... " D. Mechling</blockquote><p><blockquote>"...<B>I use the music of Constance Demby in order to lower my bodies blood pressure,</B>keep panic down, reduce fear reaction , and can usually get contol over most episodes,if not at all times. I thank you for your consideration of music as an alternative therapy. "S. B. Slightom</blockquote><p><blockquote>"...<B>.I suffer from chronic pain </B>as a result of spinal fusions. You would not believe what calm relief can be attained through this type of music, in particular NOVUS MAGNIFICAT . I no longer require narcotic pain relievers or tranquilizers or muscle relaxants. If it were possible on earth to hear the Angels of Heaven sing, this must be the song and voice of Glory ! " T. Hollingsworth</blockquote><p><blockquote>".....<B>As my AIDS patient lay dying,</B> NOVUS MAGNIFICAT filled the halls of the hospital. He was hooked up to machines that showed us his life signs., andwith the last note of the music, he flatlined and passed over. The halls were filledwith doctors, nurses and patients either weeping or wondering what was happening."	P.Debarone, D.D.</blockquote><p><blockquote><p>".<B>..I am HIV positive,</B> and SET FREE literally got me through all of my anxieties....I was able to laugh and cry with it, (mostly cry), meditate, sleep andeven regain my appetite. While listening, I aligned my soul and mind back to sanity because I really thought I was losing it for a while. Many friends and family tried their best to comfort me, but when it came right down to it, your "Set Free" album is what carried me through. "	No. 1 fan, Thad</blockquote><p><blockquote><p>"....I teach Intuitive Development and Healing Classes, and after using the music in the class, an older woman who has been married to a jazz musician, came up to me and told me that all these years she had listened to music, but thiswas the first time that she had experienced it, and what a difference it made to her. She then gave your tape to her friend , who had crippling arthritis. As a result,<B> for the first time in years, she was able to sit still, out of pain."</B> A.

With the increasing intensity and moody depth in the symphonic sections, my core was fully exposed and my ribs ached with long-buried sobs. Demby has fulfilled her mission and has forged a sturdy path with this album.

AETERNA will remind some people of Vangelis at his best, -- at the same time, <B>expect a lot more than Vangelis</B> offers in a single album. This is dreaming music, space music and music that celebrates life, all at once". <br>- Microsoft Network-"Speaking Tree"<br><p><hr><b>Listener Response:</b><p>"As for AEterna's gift , so low in physical price, worth at least ten million more, I canonly say that 15 years ago I lost an entire position of my Assemblage Point, and yesterday, I got it back. Where everything I loved and cherished had been scorched, boiled and fried to a crisp, and was in fact lost and unavailable, AEterna gave it back, squared and doubled. I feel I will never brag again, nor will I ever have The Sadness again. "	Danny<p>"...I personally had such a profound emotional and spiritual experience that I wasn't able to even talk about it for over a week. This music literally penetratesthe body and processes the emotions and the emotional barriers that keep people from remembering who they are and why they're here. This is the thing about your music that is so powerful -- it tends to penetrate below the conscious mind and activates a remembrance or a recall of something very familiar, very deep, that is actually what I think is the core of a human beings awareness or consciousness. I just can't listen to it enough. "   Valnn Dayne Spears, Regenesis Institute<p>"..this is music from Home...I can taste the love in every phrase...it reminds me whyI am here, (obviously you have never forgotten.) I am reawakened, I am re-quickened, I am again in absolute harmony with the all of the Infinite." GC Porter<p> "..profound, uplifting, exquisite music.... AEterna, is an integral part of my cellularbreath training, and without it I would not be seeing the amazing and transformative and healing results I do. The ways in which your music touches the soul, the empowerment of emotions, is truly powerful. So many are being blessed through your music. " B.Rudulf<p>"....Constance Demby's music has spoiled me for just about all other new age music. Her music pierces straight to my soul and at the same time lifts me tothe highest, deepest heavens. No other music I've heard can so consistently awaken in me the memories and knowledge of the experience of being in eternity. AETERNAis for me the most beautiful and exquisite music I have ever heard.

I admire Constance for her willingess to depart from the emotional safety of the paradisical into the almost threateninglyawesome. Her genius is to hold to the compassion and inspiration through those places so that the portrayal of divine power is always imbued with a quality of redemption and purification. That is a feat which requires direct experience of the truth of the matter. A truth which very few compoasers have known or have the skill to portray. "D. Hallock<p> "......I tried consciously to connect with my Higher Self during the first listeningof NOVUS, and it worked!

I have never experienced anything quite like it." M. Larits<p> "....."Beautiful music, Beau-oootiful music" my friend murmured listening to yourwork, as he lay in a hospital bed, blinded by the AIDS that soon thereafter claimed his body. He listened to it again and again that afternoon, and I know itwas a profoundly comforting experience for him. I've never before owned any recorded music that so entered the fabric of my life. "	J.

Today I am 13 years old, and since then, above all the music I hear, nothing compares to the sound that Constance Demby has created. I've played it for my friends, but nobody understands what is so special about it. The music to me makes me realize life. Truly and honestly I cryat times when I am alone and listen to the tape. The music is so powerful that itsends messages to me about the world and then I cry and think about how we are polluting the earth. The music has made me realize that when I grow up I will devote my time to making this world a better place. "	Katrina Popp<p>"...To this day, neither of us can explain it, but when that song , "Mother of the World" came on, it was like something in our heads clicked, like we recognized each other after being apart for a longtime. He kissed me and then I asked him what just happened, and he wasn't sure. Then we said our first "I love you." We are now expecting our first child, and I'm not sure she would be here if it wasn't for that song. My mother uses your music in her writing, my husband uses it to study his astrophysics. and I use your music to lull my classof preschoolers to sleep at nap time. "	S.and T.

Rockford, MI.<p>I have suffered with tendonitis for the past 5 years. Within two short weeks of drinking 64 oz of Microwater per day, this condition has been eliminated.

In this book, and as a result of his extensive clinical and scientific research, Dr. Batmanghelidj exposes for the layman a new discovery that the body possesses many different thirst signals. It is now apparent that many different symptoms and signs for showing the body's comparative dehydration have until now been viewed as classical diseases of the body<p>In this book, the reasons are given why as a result of an age-dependent loss of the thirst sensation in humans, dyspeptic pain, rheumatoid joint pain, anginal pain, hypertension, asthma, allergy, raised cholesterol, chronic fatigue syndrome, and diabetes, in the elderly are either the primary indicators or the consequences of a settled-in dehydration. The fourth dimension of time is now being introduced into the practice of medicine, making it possible in the future to prevent and even cure some of the "classical diseases" of the body.<p>Dr. Batmanghelidj thinks once the public becomes aware of the paradigm shift in medicine, and begin to realize there are no commercial aims at encouraging them to treat their body's dehydration with water, a science-based transformation of the health-care system will become a welcome reality.<p>This is probably the most important book you will ever read on health matters in your hopefully long life.

<html><a name=top></a><head><title>What is Water?</title><center><h1>WHAT IS WATER?</h1></center><br><center><IMG SRC="lines.gif"></center><p>The nature of water, and understanding its function, is far more difficult than you might imagine.<p><B>Water is a solvent</B><br>It is composed of the basic H20, two parts of hydrogen to one oxygen. That is its solvent quality. It also carries solutes, invisible ingredients like minerals and nutrients and waste products. For example, blood is a solute form of water, with 90% of its make-up being water.<p>If water is treated by a magnetic or electric field, its surface tension, (measured in dynes) and some of its other structural activities will tend to remain as is. Thus water has memory, and is measured with nuclear magnetic resonance technology.<p><B>Water has different structures</B>.<br> Its two hydrogen atoms do not circle its oxygen at a 180 degree angle, but at a 105.5 degree angle, when it is in liquid form, and at a 109.5 degree angle, when it takes the form of ice. Thus solid water, possessing a more open structure than when liquid, has a lower density, and will float.<p><B>Water can kill</B>.<br> At 10 degrees centigrade, pure distilled water, is 96% to 97% pentagonally structured water. In this type of structured water, namely the distilled, fish and algae and plankton will die.<p>Water is alive. Hexagonal structured water is healthier to drink. A snow flake is. Snow-melted water has always been popular to drink. Water from mountain lakes and creeks and ponds that comes from snowpacks, has long been known to be the healthiest water in the world; it is what we call "living water".<p><B>WATER CAN BE IONIZED</B><br>When an atom or molecule gains or loses an electron, ionization occurs. When water is ionized, the molecule splits into two parts, the hydrogen ion (H+) and the hydroxyl ion (OH-). These ions combine with other solutes in water, often minerals like calcium or potassium, to create an active chemical reaction.<p><B>ACID AND ALKALINE WATER</B><br>When water carries more hydrogen than hydroxyl ions, it is said to be acid; when hydroxyl ions predominate, then science calls water alkaline. Our blood system is always working to keep itself at that narrow range of pH 7.3 to 7.45. This process is called homeostasis.<p>When we drink a popular soft drink like colas, which have an acidic pH of 2.5, the bloodstream does not lower itself to that level. Rather, sucrose and other elements in the drink are processed by the blood into acid wastes; some are eliminated, and others are stored at various locations in the body.<p><B>HOW WE AGE</B><br>What is it that causes us to grow old? Many theories exist today, and they all seem to have one quality in common: they cannot stop, hinder, or slow down the aging process.  For example, the Wear and Tear Theory argues that aging is genetic; and that theory is closely related to the Limited Number of Cell Division Theory, which proposes that the cell has only a limited number of divisions, and when used up, the body dies. Another theory says that aging is related to the breakdown of glucose, blood sugar. All these theories, and numerous others, lead to dead ends. They certainly have not produced better health.<p><B>A NEW THEORY OF AGING</B><br>Modern medicine has not been able to answer the Why-We-Age question. Yet there is another theory of aging and illness that has been around for many decades. It is voiced by natural healing practitioners in America and Europe, by doctors and scientists in Asia, in Japan and Korea and other Pacific Rim nations.Briefly, this new theory says that aging (and many diseases) result from the accumulation of acid waste products in the body.<p><B>WHAT CAUSES ACID WASTE BUILD-UP?</B><br>Bad diet, either a present one or one in the past, can cause acid wastes to be stored in the body. A meat and potato diet, for example, can cause the body to become more acidic. When acid wastes enter our bloodstream, the blood, in order to maintain that narrow pH range, will store them somewhere else. Acid salts stored in the body, over the decades, will overburden the system. A way has to be found to rid the body of wastes.adult diseases can be treated by alkalizing the bloodstream.<p>Medicine in America does not attempt to remove acid wastes from the physiological system; so today's modern medicine is rather deficient in treating adult diseases. Even if the medicine cures the disease, if acids are not removed from the body, the treatment's effectiveness will at best only be temporary.<p><B>WHAT CAUSES ACID WASTES?</B><br>Bad diets--including meat and potatoes, fried foods, soft drink colas, sucrose and other sugars--build up acid salts in the body. Often these deposits, by having to be stored away from blood flow, can remain in the body for decades.Stress-both mental and physical-can create acid deposits in the body. Mental stress can make you feel depressed. While the physiological, scientific connection to stress in the body has not been completely established, there exists a school of thought in psychology, called psychosomatics, which maintains that one's mental state will influence health.<p>Doctors in Japan, following more than forty years of research and testing, believe that daily drinking of alkaline water can lift depression. Let us look at some of the healing benefits of drinking ionized alkaline water.<p><B>OBESITY</B><br>Overweight is a major health problem in America. It arises from the overeating of carbohydrates and fats. When the metabolic process is not able to burn them away, the blood must place these fatty acids somewhere. It first stores them under the skin, around the waist in men, and around the hips, thighs and breasts in women. Then it deposits wastes around organs and tissues, which then receive a smaller supply of nutrients and are thereby damaged. This second stage is more deadly.<p>An easy gentle way to lose weight is to wash fatty acids out of the body by drinking six to eight glasses of alkaline water a day. This practice has been employed in Japan for the last thirty years, and doctors there record numerous instances of weight loss.<p><B>CANCER</B><br>Dr. Keiichi Morishita in his book, The Hidden Truth of Cancer, states that if the blood develops a more acidic condition, then these excess acidic wastes have to be deposited somewhere in the body. If this unhealthy process continues year after year,  these areas steadily increase in acidity, and their cells begin to die.<p> Other cells in the affected area may survive by becoming abnormal; these are called malignant.  Malignant cells do not respond to brain commands. They undergo a cellular division that is out of control. This is called cancer.Modern medicine in America treats these malignant cells as if they were bacteria or viruses. It uses chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery to treat cancer. Yet none of these treatments will help very much, if after all of that, the acidic environment remains.<p>Drinking water that has a high alkaline pH, because of its de-acidifying effect, will help in preventing cancer. In Asia, alkaline water is regularly served to patients, and is by excess protein buildup also impair pancreatic function. Alkaline water, by supplying calcium in an ionized form, and by preventing excess protein buildup, can help this condition. The Japanese have been successfully clinically treating diabetes with alkaline water.<p><B>ARTHRITIS</B><br>Many different forms arthritis and gout are the result of the accumulation of acid wastes in the joints. Ointments simply cover-up symptoms. Aspirin, being acidic, can offer short-term relief, but over a longer period, it can add to the pain. Alkaline water is employed by Asian doctors to alter the acidic condition in the body so that the body can fix the problem by itself.<p><B>KIDNEY DISEASE</B><br>As the body consumes toxins, the kidneys become over-burdened with acid wastes. Nephritis, uremia poisoning, and bladder diseases are all acid related conditions which can be treated by the consumption of alkaline water. Kidney stones begin as tiny specks; they gradually build into solid stones, composed of phosphates, urates, etc. They are another form of acidic salts. Drinking plenty of alkaline water will prevent kidney stones from forming, and even after their formation, it can dissolve them. Japanese doctors have used alkaline water for years to treat the kidneys.<p><B>THE ALKALINE WATER MAKER</B><br>Alkaline water is produced using electrolysis to electrically split filtered tap water into alkaline and acid water. The machine was first developed in Japan in the early 1950's, and approved for use as a medical device by The Health & Rehabilitation Ministry in Jan. of 1966. The ionized minerals found in city tap water are important. Common alkaline minerals are sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium; the common acid minerals are chlorine, lead, sulfur and phosphorous.<p> The water ionizer has two chambers, with a positive and a negative electrode. When the process is complete, one chamber provides alkaline water with its ionized alkaline minerals. This is what we drink, the water that is so healthy for us.<p> <B>ALKALINE WATER EXPERIENCES</B><br> A woman in her forties under high stress was diagnosed with high blood pressure and was told she had abnormally high cholesterol levels. She began consuming one and a half quarts a day of alkaline water. After a few weeks, both her cholesterol and blood pressure were lowered; and as an added benefit, her stomach began to feel much better. A teenager with severe acne began drinking the water, and after three months, the condition was cleared up. He consumed two quarts a day of alkaline water. A man worried about the effect of the prescription drugs that he was taking for overweight began consuming two quarts of the water per day. After six months, he had thrown away his drugs, and had lost over thirty pounds. In California, a man had been suffering from hyper-acidity for many years, and after eating a meal would unpredictably vomit. He began consuming six glasses of the alkaline water per day. Within a week his acidity ended; he also lost fifteen pounds in three months, and discovered a dramatic rate of increase in his ability to heal small ailments, like cuts and bruises. A woman had suffered constipation for thirty years, and began drinking the water on a regular basis, and completely rid herself of this condition. She had also lacked an appetite for years, but has now developed a healthy one. One man who likes to consume alcohol moderately, noticed when he began consuming the water on a regular basis, that he quit suffering hangovers, and that the drowsiness he regularly experienced had left him. A female athlete in her twenties began consuming the alkaline water for a stomach condition; she felt an increase in her general energy level, and after a day of strenuous training, found that the alkaline water minimized the aches and pains she had always previously experienced.  For years, a woman had suffered ulcers, and was feeling nauseous from her medication ; a regular consumption of the water allowed her to cease her medication and the ulcer began to go away.<p>One could go on and on with these stories, and there are many more, but what we suggest you do is simply try the water yourself.<p><hr>Return to:|   <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <a href="ionlight.html">Ion and Light</a>  |  <a href="portalmk.html">Portal Market</a>  |  <a href="/earthportals/index2.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>    |<P><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

In thisharmonious relationship we freely exchanged energy within eachkingdom.  The proper exchange of energy between natural systems alwayscreates a surplus of energy not a depletion. This was a time whenman's spiritual nature and scientific pursuits were inseparable andaligned as a cohesive force for understanding truth. These were timeswhen rhythms and cycles within man and within nature were ritualizedthat they might be fully comprehended. The dynamic rituals and symbolsbecame an outward expression of inward connection to the all.Centered around this harmony and sacredness of early man, water wasalways the symbol of the life processes. Water exists within almostevery religious system as the pinnacle of expression of thisinterconnection with all of life.<p>Water is the great mediator. We are gathered to understand water'srole as mediator between the energetic and material world, betweenthat of pure light and that of matter. By having no inherent form ofits own, water embraces the form of everything it comes in contactwith. While laying aside any life of its own- it becomes the carrierof life and the chief communication channel between life energies. Itfunctions as accumulator, transmitter and transducer of energies. Thismediator of energetic systems is continually transferring lifeprocesses from one system to another in its helical evolutionarymanner.<p>We lost this understanding of water when our relationship with theCreator was broken. Our relationship with the creation becamedysfunctional and disharmonious. With the coming of "civilization" (social ordering outside the family model) men refused to rely on theinternal insight that comes through connecting with the rhythms andenergies of the life cycles around us. Men begin to rely solely ontheir ego-based analytical thinking patterns. This reliance onindividualized thinking and judgment has culminated in the currentdestructive technological systems.  This techno / scientific communityhas produced staunch individuals who refuse to believe anything thatdoesn't fit their premeditated paradigms or belief systems. Thosethings that conflict with their theories and models are rejected asanomalies and shuffled under the table as it were. As a result of thisself-reliance we have continued to build technologies and systems thatare energy inefficient. Nature can no longer keep up with these life-exhausting energy systems and the depletion of our naturalresources. For example, the explosive hydrocarbon based technologiesalone are raping the earth of its oxygen resources at an alarmingrate.  To calculate the O2 consumption rate against the replenishmentby the vastly depleted rain forest is terrifying.  The wonder ofoxygen with its ability to capture and transport non-vectored energiesor feminine quality life force energies, (a subject outside the scopeof this paper) is our single greatest resource. The depletion ofoxygen overshadows all other pollution concerns.<p>Return to:|   <a href="#top">Top</a>  |<p>Man's first disconnection with creation can be traced to the time whenthe sacredness of water as a life process was no longer honored northe understanding of the mystery of water pursued. The relegation ofwater to being merely a chemical compound consisting of two hydrogenatoms and one oxygen atom (H2O) displays an arrogance and ignorancewithin the educated community. As society' moral standardsdeteriorated, water was seen as a means of dumping our waste- ourtoxins. This departure, this disconnection that can violate naturethrough its total disregard for water and see it as the dumpinggrounds for its refuse is our current state of affairs.<p>We come here today as a group of researchers, scientists, and healthpractitioners eager to explore the sacredness of water. We've come torecognize water as more than a simple chemical compound. We come to gobeyond the fact that purification simply needs to remove the physicalpollutants that exist in the water.  We have set a course to exploreand understand this sacred substance given to man as the universaltranslator of energetic systems; whose memory is vast, stretching backto creation and holding in its structure knowledge past findingout. Many of us have explored the aspects of the electro-magneticphenomena from DC ULF pulses to microwave frequencies in the 100gigahertz range or seen the dance of photons from visible to hardgamma rays.  Others have experimented with EM vector-strippedenergies. We have all learned that these produce effects in water andthat water has the ability to hold memories through its geometricstructuring.  Those of us who have listened keenly to the wisdom ofwater have learn the importance of the density factor as the key tothe proper energetic transmission. We have worked at developing properflow forms that allow water to invite life-affirming energies.<p>My desire is for us to undertake together so that our role in watersciences research be not simply understanding these processes withwhatever unique tools and mental abilities we have at our disposal. Wecan help each other step forward in opening our souls to the vastdepth and mystery that lies within the structure of water. We mustbecome scientist/priests. Men who hold the sacredness of water intheir hearts- who are in constant awe at the intricate mysteries thatwater has to impart. Indeed if any man here amongst us could fullyunderstand the interplay of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon, we wouldbecome masters of life instead of relegating ourselves and our worldas slaves to decay and death. We can no longer see ourselves asscientist alone, but truly as priests who stand in awe before theMaker- wanting to understand this mystery of connection andcommunication. The priest's role in society was to bring God (spirit)to the people and the people to God.  Our role then through ourresearch, through our publications, through our products is to returnpeople to a profound awareness that through the vehicle of water thereis the capability of touching all life-affirming energies andexperiencing true homeostasis without the need for complex externalmachines.<p>Return to:|   <a href="#top">Top</a>  |<p>The enemy of our work is that same enemy in the heart of man thatfirst lost or broke the connection of the sacredness of water and itsname is Pride/Greed. The symposium was birthed out of a desire tosteward a new paradigm of thinking- to find those of likeunderstanding about the importance of water who would work together asscientist/priests and communicators for the people. In the lastseveral years I have mingled with many a researcher in the watersciences. My heart has been to share my discoveries and research in aneffort to further the knowledge base of the sacredness of water.  Ihave found many who were equally ready to open up and share and totrust in one another's integrity.<p>Our intent is not to be robbers of propriety information but in amutual give and take to assist one another in research. Some of ushave the luxury of self-funding. Some of us are funded by grants orprivate investors who have a monetary interest in our work. We can notallow ourselves or these people to consign us and our research to anisolated closet.  Those who seek to make proprietary, to lock up- tomake secret their research so that no one else can benefit, will findstagnation.  Like water which refuses to stop flowing and if made tocease will stagnate, so this contained research becomes a putrefyingdisplay of selfishness and/or greed.<p>Water itself must be our teacher. It must keep its cyclic rhythm if itis to continue to be vitalized with life-affirming energy. We mustfind and share with those of integrity and carry the stewardship ofwater. We do not "cast our pearls before swine." And indeed it is anart to discern the thoughts and intentions of people; to learn when toopen up, when the sacredness of our work can be shared in anenvironment of trust, beauty and furtherance of understanding.<p>The purpose of The Institute for Advanced Water Sciences Research issimply to create connecting points for water researchers to meet withone another- to share with those involved in like projects andencourage one another. There is too much work for any one of us tofigure it all out alone. Through team effort we can create a change, aglobal change. Energies that we currently recognize and those that lieat the threshold of our awareness are waiting for our spiritual man towake up enough to comprehend. If we will say yes together- and committo stewarding those energies-then that time of awakening has come.<p>I have no desire to be read by a dying race of men who 50 years fromnow have not learned the lessons we should have learned 50 yearsbefore- to be another largely forgotten researcher like Schauberger.Instead I would want our children's children to remember that arevolution in the thinking of the masses began with a team of men whopioneered a paradigm shift in their own thinking.<p>Look through history and you will find many pioneers who understoodthe life-giving properties of water, but because of the greed andpride that separated man, like sand castles on the beach, the tidescleansed and washed them away. It is only when we learn to unstop thedam- to flow out and mingle (if I may be permitted some water imagery)with those that are on the same path, that we create lasting changeand redeem this planet from insanity to the place where it again seesthe sacredness of water and indeed of life. This Institute has but onepurpose- to provide a place where information can flow to those whoneed it. We wish to create an environment that will assist you. We areset up as a non-profit organization.  It is my desire that many of youout there that steward the sacredness of water- that carry thisscientist/priest vision for water-be participants in the ongoingdevelopment of this symposium.<p>Return to:|   <a href="#top">Top</a>  |<p>The original title for my speech was Water: The Bigger Picture. Iasked that it be changed to The Stewardship of Water which was moreencompassing of the basic thought I wished to convey. Although I amnot able this morning in an opening address to share in as detailed amanner as I would like on the specifics of my particular area of watersciences research, I did want to lay down some of the guidelines inwhich I carry forward my stewardship of water. If you will allow menow to step out of the prophet's robe and the necessity I felt ofprovoking us in the same direction, I would like to model our newawareness by being the first to share the basic understandings ofwater which guide my research. The model I use is the 5 elements. (seeillustration). The work is always twofold. The first step is creatinga baseline solution. I am defining baseline as a starting pointneutral water- water that has been brought from a negative position toa zero position if you will. To create this water necessitates theclearing of physical ions through clearing signatures and noise withinthe water matrix.  Secondly, I seek to understand how to revitalizewater and prepare it to invite life-affirming energies.<p>For the model of water I work with I like to use the kabalisticunderstanding of the five elements.  Most older disciplines thatassociate their scientific learning with spiritual understanding; i.e.true alchemy or oriental medical philosophy used the designations ofearth- air- water- fire and spirit as a basis to explain changes ofstate within matter.  An "element" in my understanding is not a fixedsubstance as in conventional chemistry, but a momentary resting statein the transition of crystallized energies as these energies manifestthemselves down into gross forms of matter, or as matter releasing itsenergy back into the space vacuum. They are simply notes within therange of harmonies of the music of life.<p>Return to:|   <a href="#top">Top</a>  |<p><hr><p><b>The 5 elements- creating a  baseline water</b><p><ul><li><b>Earth</b></ul><p>We will begin with the discussion of the earth elements of water.This deals with the physical constitutes of water- the chemicalcomposition, the total dissolved solids, the suspended solids.<p>In creating a baseline water, filtration for suspended solids down toless than 1 micron absolute is preferable for the pretreatmentprocess. Most subsequent purification processes also eliminatesuspended solids, but minute traces have been found on glassware andwithin spiral wound membranes. The use of carbon as an absorptionmedia is highly recommended and common to most any pretreatmentprocess regardless of what you plan on doing with the water. I cannotoverstate the importance of the interplay between carbon, oxygen andhydrogen. The three dance together through all of this planet's lifeprocesses. Without these three we have no life- they constitute thebase- the core that life revolves around.  To experience the fullimpact of carbon on your final process you need to exceed by a factorof 2 the cubic feet of carbon necessary for total organic removal.Any preoxidation before the carbon also bioenhances the media andextends the service life. Having dealt with pretreatment throughproper suspended solid removal and preliminary exposure to carbon, letus examine other methods for purification on a worst to best basis aswe attempt to create a baseline water.<p>1. DI (ionic extraction) has proven to this point to be the worst single method of removing the chemical ions from the water from the standpoint of working tow.<p>2. Coming up the scale of quality several steps is distillation -rapid heat distillation. We are assuming the unit provides for properdegassing.<p>3. The next step up with water purification is using a reverse osmosisprocess. This is also a very economical process as it relies on waterpressure to do the work.  Membrane fouling is a constant problem andcan rapidly destroy a quality water. If using reverse osmosis,adequate pretreatment and maintenance of your membranes is vital toassure a quality product.<p>4. The next step up from that point is vapor compression distillation,which uses low heat and a pressure differential to evolve off yourvapor and re-condense it.<p>5. The next step up from vapor compression is triple distillation inglassware. This is the method in use for most homeopathic preparation.Be sure to use flame heat over electrical heating elements- due to the60 hertz electro-magnetic signature. Whenever a vacuum can be pulledto compensate for high heat, it is always desirable to evaporate waterat the lowest possible heat.<p>6. Fractional distillation which allows for separating out thedifferent components within the water and remixing them in alchemaicfashion is one of the preferred methods for achieving a specific typeof baseline water.<p>7. Exciting new research working with the separation and recombiningof monoatomic forms of hydrogen and oxygen is too premature to share.<p>For removal of the earth memories within water we have found thatmagnetic force is very effective.  Through its momentary polarizationof the water molecule, magnetization allows the gross signatures ofthe pollutants to be greatly nullified. If you use fixed fieldmagnetics you are also instilling a memory pattern or its ownstructuring. Unless that is going to be a part of your final equation,you need to remove that signature downstream using a cancellationfrequency.<p>Return to:|   <a href="#top">Top</a>  |<p><ul><li><b>Water</b></ul><p>Next let us discuss "water" within the element of water. Waterenergetically responds to every rhythm and/or motion it encounters.The translation of energies takes place within the movements of thewater. Even Brownian movement through dipole excitation allows sometransfer of energies.  If you have not yet intentionally inviteddirected movement into your water equation, I highly recommend thatyou begin to study the flow dynamics of water. Clearing water ofmemory is assisted by a centrifugal action as this creates separationwithin the water molecule and a devitalization of energies within thestructuring of that water. Propelling water molecules towards eachother at 90 degree angles loosens negative energy patterns through theshearing that takes place in the collision. Whenever water travelsdown a pipe and takes a 90 degree turn, the energy within the watercontinues to follow the forward momentum and there is an energyloss. This can be used to advantage in removing negative energies andcreating our baseline water.  The element of flow dynamics isessential and key for the work to follow in reimpregnating the waterwith life-affirming energies.<p><ul><li><b>Fire</b></ul><p>To speak of the element of fire within the element of water seemsalmost contradictory. Consider though that without fire in theimplosion of hydrogen and oxygen, we would not have water. If you seethe fire aspect as potential hydrogen, hydrogen is the firstmanifestation of matter. When energy make that translation into matterwe find the presence of hydrogen. Thus hydrogen truly is the father ofall manifest life and from hydrogen in its monoatomic state allelements can be transmuted and transferred. Controlling the pH of thewater is very important. It is essential to have a pH meter that readsup to 0.0001 resolution. There are many studies in Japan working withoxygen reduction potential looking at a minus voltage signature withinthe ion configuration of water. Unfortunately, much of this researchis being done without removing the chemical and mineral ions from thewater.<p>Our research indicates there is much work to be done in understandingthe proper relationships within pure water- water void of dissolvedsolids down to the ppb range. It is here that the hydroxyls, OH,oxygen hydroxyls, and hydrogen peroxides all need to be considered forproper combining to achieve maximum bio-enhancing effects. Most ofthis manipulation is easily achieved through photochemicalorchestration and selective ion removal. It is at this point that thefire energy responds to the emission portion of the EM spectrum. Thereis some preliminary research that began a few weeks before thisseminar that is very exciting. We are now looking at a way to createan ultra-pure, memory free water, void of any background noise. Atthis point we have been able to produce a few grams of water with anincredibly low surface tension and a hunger like I have never seenwithin water. As soon as we acquire enough data we will make apresentation to the Institute. There are exciting possibilities forapplication, especially in the field of superconcentrated homeopathicenergy signatures and really in relationship to all signaturing inwater.<p>Return to:|   <a href="#top">Top</a>  |<p><ul><li><b>AIR</b></ul><p>Air deals with the memory constructs carried within the water. Indesignaturing memory one must realize that a trace signal is almostalways left, leaving water with what we call background noise. Forexample, the hiss and noise left on a magnetic tape after continuedsignaturing, erasing, and resignaturing the magnetic domains isequivalent to the background noise found in water.  Barring the newmemory free water that we are currently researching, what we have donein the past is to revitalize the positive signatures in a highermagnitude, being careful to orchestrate the flow dynamics so that thebackground noise is less intrusive. Phase cancellation of your primaryfrequencies is another method for designaturing the water although farmore difficult to control due to the myriad of possible harmonics.<p>All work must be prefaced by a consideration for unwantedelectro-magnetic pollution in the lab or processing environment. Sooften I see high voltage transformers within a few feet of a criticalprocess - impregnating their 60 hertz fields upon the product.Conductive surfaces need to be properly grounded. Avoid usingstainless steel. Earth's magnetic laylines can destroy subtle energyprocesses. Simply moving processes away from layline junctionseliminates unwanted variables.  Shielding the work by constructing adouble Faraday cage may be necessary to prevent contamination fromelectromagnetic fields and physical elements in the lab. Theimportance of systematic diligent consideration of every influence onthe work cannot be overstressed when we are dealing with subtleenergies. I have seen many brilliant processes implemented only to becanceled out by inferior material that re-impregnates the water withMEK and all sorts of solvents used in glued PVC and other types offittings. Each aspect of the process beginning to end must becarefully examined and questioned if we are going to produce watersthat bring life.<p><ul><li><b>SPIRIT</b></ul><p>The final element or aspect of water is that of spirit. Spirit dealswith the domains of energy that are outside of the time-spacecontinuum - those that do not have a linear wave propagation. We oftenrefer to these as scalar energy, 0 point energy, non-hertzian energy,orgone energy or chi. There are numerous names given to this energythat comes from the space vacuum. ( see illustration.) The play ofthese Spirit energies has profound impact in structuring water withinthe cytoplasm. The aim of research here is to find means to collectthe already harmonious life-affirming space vacuum energies or eternalenergies that are within the domain of spirit. This work must be donein the absence of photons- the visible spectrum of light which hasconflicting harmonies that cancel the translation of the eternalenergies. The birthing of the geometric structuring of water takesplace in a dark womb devoid of visible light where the sensitive chaosgives form to the eternal energies. The structuring forms are criticalto success. Here is where geometric configurations and phi ratios bothplay an important role in the birthing or bringing in oflife-affirming energies from the space vacuum into the substance ofwater. Some photon emissions are beneficial to this process. They mustbe shorter wavelengths than 120 nanometers. Although establishingresonant points within these wavelengths is difficult to control thepersevering researcher will be amply rewarded.<p>Return to:|   <a href="#top">Top</a>  |<p><hr><p> <b>Photon Energy In Electron Volts At The Center Of Each Region</b>  Infrared Radiation -     0.4<br>  Near -Infrared -        1.0<br>  Visible -               0.8<br>  Ultraviolet -            360<br>  X-ray -               4x10-5<br>  Gamma -                4x10-8<p><hr><p><b>Imprinting water with life-affirming energies</b><p>Having purified the water through the understanding of the 5 elements,we are now ready to energize and imprint our water using the sameelements. Choreographing the 5 elements for maximum imprinting isindeed a complex dance. To explain in detail within the confines ofthis paper is not possible as the material is worthy of lengthierexposition. (I am lucky to have finished this small paper!)  Insteadsome brief observations can be made on the basics of impartingpositive signatures to the water.<p><ul><li><b>Fire</b></ul><p>Using the proper light- based technologies and oxidation methods wecan balance the pH to best benefit the invitation of information. Iwant to mention here another factor that is not often considered. Thefamous 39.2 degrees Fahrenheit mentioned in Schauberger's work is themaximum density water holds before its anomalous expansion throughfreezing. Often we fail to realize that the scissoring andenergization state within the dipole movement of the water moleculescreates infrared emissions. Many of these frequencies within the IRband have a canceling effect. This is why controlling the temperaturein tenths of degrees is a critical function in the energizing ofwater. It is my belief that the absence of any influencing IR energiesduring the energizing process is the ideal. Use specific temperaturegradients to target IR frequencies that are harmonious with theinformation you wish to imprint on the water. In temperatures belowfreezing use pressure to keep water in a fluid state and allow thetransfer of information. In many of our experiments the process ofcrystallization while in the transfer stage does seem to lock in manychords of energy properly.  The matter of water density is also animportant element in the temperature equation. One must look atdensity and IR signatures as two separate issues. The seeding ofmonatomic and diatomic hydrogen and its so called isotopes- deuteriumand tritium is another important factor to consider if we are toachieve the true water of life. In any natural water body we finddeuterium and tritium ratios much higher than in processed bulkwaters.<p>Return to:|   <a href="#top">Top</a>  |<p><ul><li><b>Water</b></ul><p>Flow forms are critical for not only inviting energies, but inmaintaining them. Water always flows in a sinusoidal pattern. This iswhy a centripetal vortex allows the wave form to maintain andstrengthen its integrity. To understand cyclic patterns we must learnfrom nature. The first flow form we must understand is that of ourbreath. Until we connect the rhythm, flow, and changes that our breathbrings we will not perceive the greater inhaling and exhaling oflife's cycles.  All things with conscious breath fluctuate and move inpatterns and rhythms in accordance to their desired performance. Wehave forgotten how to maximize our states through the simple tool ofbreath. A study of a natural waterfall will also give insight into theuse of complex wave forms. It is interesting to note that many naturalwaters with longevity properties do not meet Schauberger's deep springcriteria, but are glacier melt flowing streams with proper density andflow gradients and added colloidal factors.<p><ul><li><b>Earth</b></ul><p>I have always been a proponent of keeping water as pure as possibleand if you can take baseline purity down to ppt purity you can bringit back up to less than 1 ppm and still give the proper colloidal andion content necessary to have a balanced water. I believe that theoverloading of waters with high ion content causes the body tointerpret water as a food substance and send it through the normaldigestive process. Thus the full impact of the energetic signature islost through the poor assimilation that takes place in the digestivesystem. Pure waters that have the proper energetic imprint areabsorbed through the stomach lining and immediately their frequenciesare available for the intercellular communication that takes place inthe cytoplasm of the cell. The faster we send the signatures to thecytoplasm, the quicker and more efficient the energy transfer, and thefaster the message is communicated on a cellular level. Highly chargedcolloids- specifically those that can remain in suspension withoutdissolving back into the water- are definitely one way to do this. Theuse of energetic gases- especially the noble gases in minute form-also have an incredible impact in signaturing the water and givingback its earth aspect for human consumption.<p>Return to:|   <a href="#top">Top</a>  |<p><ul><li><b>Air</b></ul><p>As we use frequency to structure water, it is important to realizethat the particular frequencies which work well, are simply aresonance that can be found in octaves up or down the electromagneticspectrum. Our work has shown that using several frequencies to form achord is far more beneficial than a single frequency. Resonancefrequencies can be used singly as carrier frequencies for radionicallyencoded information.  Dimensional saturation is a term we use todescribe the process of playing a resonance frequency with its correctsubharmonics and harmonics till you have a complete saturation of thatresonance. This creates a gate for the eternal energies and an abilityto create significant state changes within the material you areworking with.  Always shield work from induction from any and allcanceling fields.  Watch out for time distortions!<p><ul><li><b>Spirit</b></ul><p>There are at least 15 ways we have learned to create phase-cancelingcoils. Each of these coils seem to work with particular energy zones.Stripping frequency of its electromagnetic vectors through a 180degree out of phase coil will strip the time-space vectors and createeternal energies.  By far this is the most important work to be done.Learning to tap the infinite sea of feminine energy that longs to betranslated into life-forming energies is our most serious stewardship.Because others will speak on this subject I will only briefly comment.Whether translating or creating these scalar fields one must givetotal attention to the materials used. For example, 2 copper wireswith different ratios of impurities and different plastic insulatorswould change the outcome.  Gold, silver, platinum, titanium, iron, andcopper all translate different bands of energy.  The noble gasesfunction on this planet is to assist in translating these energies.<p><hr><p><b>Conclusion</b><p>I have tried to outline the aspects of stewardship that I considervital in my workings with water. I hope that this will assist you infurthering your work. I desire that my openness and candor will setthe stage for the presenters who follow to share more openly duringthe Symposium their particular area of research. I, like you, willreceive some flack for sharing too much of my "secrets", but in fact Imust and I will continue to speak the true in love so that together wecan start a revolution of change from this present madness. Rememberthe hundred 100th monkey principal. If we get enough people thinkingand drinking this sacred water impregnated with life-affirmingenergies, man will realize the destructive habits and mechanisms inplace now are no longer helpful to their existence.  I would like tothank my research team; Norman Wootan, Tony Wood, Joel McClain, andJoseph Tyl. I commend them for their unique contributions to theadvancement of the water sciences and their personal friendship andencouraging support.<p><b>Bibliography</b><p><ul><li>DRAGANIC, IVAN G., ZORICA D., "The Radiation Chemistry of Water"Academic Press, 1971<li>D.

<html><a name=top></a><head><title>Ions and Consciousness</title><center><h1>Ions and Consciousness</h1></center><center><h3>by</h3></center><center><h2>Jim Karnstedt</h2></center><p><IMG SRC="lines.gif"><p><font size=5>Y</font>our awareness is in the air...For centuries, yoga masters of the East have taught that breath is life, and by altering the intake of air, one could alter one's consciousness. The quality of the air we describe as prana or life energy. Now,Western science has coined a name for at least one aspect of that energy and called it "ions". More and more individuals are finding that these tiny electric charges have a lot to do with their awareness.<p>Fot the uninitiated, ions are charged particles in the air that are formed when enough energy acts upon a molecule, such as carbon dioxide, oxygen, water, or nitrogen to eject an electron. The displaced electron attaches itself to a nearby molecule, which then becomes a negative ion. It is the negative ion of oxygen that effects us most. Remember that feeling  you have experienced near a waterfall, or high in the mountains? Those are two such places where thousands of negative ions occur. They create an effect on human biochemistry. Some of nature's other best known negative ion resources are air friction, lightning, falling water, earth's radioactivity. and even evergreens and ferns.<p>The normal ion count in fresh country air is 2,000-4,000 negative ions per cubic centimeter (cm<sup>3</sup> is about the size of a sugar cube). At Yosemite falls, you will experience over 100,000 negative ions per cubic centimeter. On the other hand, the level is far below 100 per cubic centimeter on Los Angeles freeways during rush hour.<p>Research on ions began in 1950's with Dr. Albert Kreuger, professor emeritus of the University  of California at Berkeley, and Dr. Felix Sulman, professor of pharmacology at the Hebrew University in Israel.<p>Dr Kreuger excited the scientific world when he discovered ions to be biologically active, stimulating the production of the powerful chemical serotonin of 5-HT. Serotonin is a very active neuro-hormone which causes profound neural, glandular, and digestive effects throughout the body. Tests show that positive ions increase production of 5-HT; negative ions decrease the hormone level.<p>Dr. Sulman corroborated Kreugers's findings while studying positive ion victims of the hot, dry Sharav winds in Jerusalem. he demonstrated three effects of positive ion excess: irritation and tension, exhaustion, and hyperthyroid response. Most of these conditions, along with symptoms of depression, anxiety, headaches, and low energy physical and mental functions, were shown to be alleviated or totally eliminated by increasing the negative ion count in the air.<p>Negative ions break down serotonin and thereby give one a clear, alert outlook with a higher awareness function. The primary reason for this is the increased speed with which the nerve impulses can travel along the synapses in the brain and the rest of the body.<p><blockquote>"Negative Ions promote alpha brain waves and increase brain wave amplitude, which translates to a higher awareness level."</blockquote><p>The metabolism is enhanced to create better utiliztion of nutrients from our foods and vitamins, while our brain's intuitive, nonlinear activities flow more smoothly.<p>Negative ions promote alpha brainwaves and increase brainwave amplitude, which translates to a higher awareness level. Those ion-induced alpha waves spread from the occipital areas to the parietal and temporal and even reach the frontal lobes, spreading evenly across the right and left brain hemispheres. All  of this creates an overall clear and calming effect, benefiting meditation and concentration.<p>While ionization of the air is mandatory in many European and Russian hospitals and workplaces, it has only recently come to light in our country with the growing problems to toxic air in our urban environments.<p><blockquote>"The negative ion count per cubic centimeter at Yosemite Falls is over 100,000. On the other hand the count is far below 100 on the Los Angeles Freeways..."</blockquote><p>Jan Stolwijk, of the World Health Organization, stated that, "there is probably more damage done to human health by indoor air pollution than by outdoor pollution." Most people spend 70% to 80% of their time indoors!<p>The late William Radley, a Bay Area environmental health expert, coined the term "orthomolecular architecture" opening up a whole new area for designers and architects to consider, namely, the choice of building materials that will not release toxic fumes such as formaldehyde and hydrocarbons.<p>It may of been dificult to be an urban mystic in the past, but now, we can look forward to environmental solutions that will aid us in maintaining a more conscious and healthful life. Ionization is one of our first major steps.<p><hr>Return to:|   <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <a href="ionlight.html">Ion and Light</a>  |  <a href="portalmk.html">Portal Market</a>  |  <a href="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>    |<P><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

One country-Switzerland- even accepts the blowing of the "Foehn" during the commission of a crime as mitigating evidence in court.<p> These "notorious" desert and sea winds are also linked to minor illnesses and malaise epidemics. Victims' claims range from sleeplessness, irritability, tension, migraines, nausea, palpitations and hot flashes with sweating o shills to tremor, vertigo, swelling, breathing difficulty, and frequent intestinal movement. In addition, elderly persons are affected with depression. apathy, and fatigue..<p> What causes these "witches' winds." as they are often called, to differ from others? What do they posses or lack that make them a dread to the lands or oceans they blow across?.<p> Nothing more than an imbalance of invisible, minute particles with an imperceptive electrical charge-positive and negative ions..<p> According to the experts, positive ions rob us of our good senses and dispositions, while their counterpart, negative ions, enhance them, stimulating everything from plant growth to the human sex drive..<p> For the uninitiated, ions are charged particles in the air, formed when enough energy acts on a molecule such as carbon dioxide, oxygen, water or nitrogen-to eject an electron. The displaced electron attaches itself to a nearby molecule, which then becomes a negative ion (neg-ion). The original molecule (minus an electron) is now a positive ion (pos-ion). These ions, in turn, react with dust and pollutants to form larger particles. Small neg-ions (usually no more than 12 gaseous molecules clustered around a charged atom or molecule) are short-lived and highly mobile..<p> As long ago as 1789, the Abbe Bertholon, European monk speculated that ions exist and affect people. He recorded the responses of medical patients and normal people to changes in the electrical state of the ambient air. More than a century later, in 1899, two scientists named Elster and Geitel proved the existence of ions. Only since the 1930s have researchers been probing their secrets..<p> In nature, ions are formed in a variety of ways. About half are created by radioactive gases. Radioactive substances in the soil, cosmic rays, ultraviolet rays, air flow friction, falling water and plants all produce the other half. For example, they stream off the leaves of plants, most notably pines and asparagus ferns..<p> Ions are apparently also created by the phenomenon of "subterranean suspiration". As Fred Soyka, author of The Ion Effect , told the first Ions and Light Conference held this summer in Atherton, California. "Solar and lunar influences cause the water table to rise, forcing air out of the earth." This prompted Federal Aviation Administration research psychologist, Bruce Rosenberg, to charge the earth with having "bad breath." Being negatively charged, he said, "it breathes positive ions.".<p> Normally only about one atom in 100,000,000,000,000,000 is ionized making a total of maybe 1000-2000 ions per cubic centimeter (that's like a handful of planets floating in a circle 4 billion miles in diameter). These are usually balanced pretty evenly between positive and negative, with a slight edge toward positive. "However, the normal may not be the optimal," Fred Soyka told New Realities. "On the seashore, where water is always falling, you have about 2000 negative to 1000 positive. That seems to be the ratio that human beings respond to most favorably."<p> We have all experienced this positive effect, regardless of our proximity to waterfalls or the ocean. Every home has a built in, natural ionizer-the shower. Our daily bath rituals are, in effect, the practice of preventive medicine. Research has shown that falling water creates thousands of negative ions by splitting other wise neutral particles of air, freeing electrons to manifest their vitalizing function. These electrons join up with smaller air particles, thus giving them a predominantly negative charge.<p> Waterfalls have always been the favorite habitat of mystics and artists. The inspiration and romance generated at places like Niagara Falls and Yosemite have a direct relationship to the lowering of serotonin levels in the blood, caused by the waves of negative ions from the spray of these falls.<p> Those notorious desert and sea winds mentioned previously raise the ion count, but over-balance the positive-up to a ratio of 33 to 1 positive. As the winds blow through arid areas, they stir up dust and the neg-ions are leeched out. In Israel such winds are called the Sharav; in the Alps the Foehn; along the Mediterranean the Sharkiye (called the Sirocco in Italy and the Xlokk in Malta); in Africa the Simoon, Hamsin and Harmatan; in southern France, the Mistral. There is the Boras of the Adriatic, the Karaburan of the Gobi, the Zondi of Argentina, the Tramontana of Spain. In the U.S., the Chinook plagues the Rockies and the Santa Ana the southern California desert. Still other winds pos-ionize India and Australia. But whatever their name, throughout the world, they are known to blow no good.<p> One might postulate that the culprit is really humidity, wind or temperature changes, not positive ionization. That has been considered, but doesn't account for the fact that weather-sensitive people react to the approaching Sharav 12 to 24 hours before meteorological instruments do. Positive ionization remains the culprit. So much for natural pos-ions.<p> The really lethal doses of pos-ions lie within our polluted cities, which William Radley, president of the Bio-Environmental Systems, refers to as "ion prisons." Car exhausts, factory fumes, tire dust, cigarette smoke, cooking and heating fumes, dust and soot gobble up neg-ions, either neutralizing or positively charging them. Inside, steel and concrete buildings act as electro-magnetic Faraday cages, absorbing the charges of negative ions. Synthetic building materials, clothing and furniture coverings eat up more; so do the metal ducts covering heating and air conditioning outlets. The positive static charge of plastics takes care of the rest, so that in a typical interior, the neg-ion count may be below 100 per cubic centimeter. (The minimal amount for optimum human functioning is about 1000/ccm.) In the words of Dr. William Rea, Chief of Surgery at Brookhaven Medical Center in Texas, "Houses don't breathe like they used to."<p> Several people have investigated the mechanisms of pos-ions' debilitating effects. According to the Russian ion pioneer, Vasil'yev, ions act on the endings of pulmonary afferent nerve fibers, altering the functional state of the central nervous system and, through it, the peripheral organs. Sulman et al (1970) found that weather-sensitive people excrete more of the neuro-hormone serotonin than non-sensitive people. Serotonin is secreted by the pineal gland and the intestines. It affects sleep, mood, nerve impulses, blood-clotting and contraction of smooth muscles. LSD effects are caused by a serotonin inhibitor, and chronic serotonin depletion is characteristic of some types of mental anomalies.<p> Sulman's work supports the findings of American ion dean Dr. Albert P. Krueger, who discovered that the specific negative ion or oxygen speeds up the rate at which serotonin is oxidized in the bloodstream.<p> Krueger also found that pos-ions slow the sweeping action of the tiny hairs in our throats from 900 to 600 beats per minute and cut mucus flow, thus lowering our resistance to airborne allergens. For example, the pos-ion carbon dioxide causes contracture of the back tracheal wall. Pos-ions also cause vasoconstriction and increased respiration rate.<p> Oddly enough, notes ion author Soyka, "About five percent of the population seems to react well to a positive charge. They feel euphoric."<p> If pos-ions are the bad guys, neg-ions wear white hats and shoot silver bullets. Their beneficial effect was first discovered in 1932 by Dr. C.W. Hansell at RCA Laboratories. Dr. Hansell was startled by the violent mood shifts of a co-worker who sat beside an electrostatic generator. He observed carefully and discovered that his colleague was ebullient when the machine produced neg-ions and morose when it made pos-ions.<p> Subsequently researchers (mostly abroad) have found that neg-ions reduce neurosis and anxiety, heighten appetite and thirst and stimulate sexual behavior. They improved performance of voluntary movements: 81.2 percent of drivers with neg-ion generators scored in the top half on driving tests: 86 percent in the top half on reaction time. In school they sharpen mental functioning and reduce error rates. After a year with neg-ion generators in their classrooms, a group of kindergarten teachers reported that their students concentrated better and showed almost no 'weather effect." Hyperactive kids were calmer. absenteeism was down (except on Mondays} and the teachers themselves felt less fatigued.<p> Neg-ions promote alpha brain waves and increase brain wave amplitude, which translates to a higher awareness level. Neg-ion Induced alpha waves spread from the occipital area to the parietal and temporal and even reach the frontal lobes, spreading evenly across the right and left brain hemispheres. All of this creates an overall calming effect.<p> On the physical side, they have given relief from hay fever. sinusitis. bronchial asthma. allergies. migraine and burn and post-operative pains. Along with the burn pain relief. they lesson infections dry the burns faster, heal them more quickly and leave less scarring. After operations. not only did 57 percent of Dr. Igho Hart Kornblueh's patients treated with large doses of neg-ions (10,000/ccm) feel less pain (as opposed to 22.5 percent of controls), but restlessness and infection were also reduced and healing quickened.<p> But why are ions therapeutic? Partly because they kill germs. Back in the 1930s. a Russian team headed by A L. Tchijevski found that large ion doses of either polarity retarded bacteria colony formation on plates. Ionization also sterilized enclosed air. Latter experiments duplicating Tchijevski's work noted an exponential bacteria decay rate of 23 percent per minute for untreated air 34 percent per minute for air with pos-ions. and 78 percent per minute for negatively charged air. They concluded that the pos-ion decay rate was due to simple bonding or the ions with the bacteria, whereas the neg-ions actually killed them.<p> Interestingly, animals larger than microbes find neg-ions beneficial. Rats learn better and are less anxious. Mice live longer. (Mice with flu die more quickly If deprived of neg-ions.) Silkworm eggs hatch earlier, larvae grow faster, spinning begins sooner, cocoons are heavier. chickens lay more eggs and grow more plump. Sheep grow faster and supply more wool.<p> And in the vegetable kingdom. plant seedlings grow up to 50 percent more when charged. Fruit stays fresh longer: after 10 days, ionized tomatoes were still fresh while untreated controls rotted.<p> Researches offer a variety of reasons for ion effect. Dr Krueger explains that plants benefit from both positive and negative ions because "ions expedite both the uptake of ion and its utilization in the production of iron containing enzymes (and) stimulate the metabolism of ATP in the chloroplasts and augment both nucleic acid metabolism and oxygen uptake."<p> In humans, most researchers think that neg-ions act on our capacity to absorb and utilize oxygen, accelerating the blood's delivery of oxygen to our cells and tissues. Dr. R. Gualterotti of the University of Milan says they make wider cell nuclei with more volume. The weight of evidence supports Krueger's theory that ions break down serotonin in the bloodstream. Lest negative ions sound too much like a cure-all, testers report that neg-ions work only so long as they're being inhaled. As the charge is most readily absorbed through the olfactory nerves, you need to breathe them in through your nose, not your mouth. Dr. Krueger cautions that ''the biological (non clinical) effects produced by atmospheric ions are not dramatic; on the contrary, they tend to be limited in degree.''<p> But that's atmospheric ions. Artificially generated ions arc another story. Just as positive ions can be generated artificially by pollution. so can negative ions be man made&Ntilde;with negative ion generators. It's true, you can't plug in an ionizer at night and expect new muscles in the morning. But their effects are not always subtle. '' People are allergic to the Twentieth Century,'' says Bio-Environmental Systems President William Radley. "Our architects and interior designers are poisoning us. Some people are so sick or so intolerant of chemicals that sometimes the results of ionization are quite dramatic.''<p> Since the 1950s, manufacturers have produced dozens of ion generators for laboratory and home use. Early machines ionized atoms and molecules via high-voltage electrical fields, incandescent materials, ultraviolet light, x-rays and alpha or beta radiation from isotopes. The output of the electrostatic, incandescent, and ultraviolet generators tended to deteriorate rapidly. In addition, electrostatic and ultraviolet machines produced ozone, a toxic oxygen allotrope, as a by-product.<p> Dr. Krueger used tritium-based generators during the 50's. Tritium is a beta radiating hydrogen isotope with a half-life of 12.5 years. A minute amount of the gas is sealed in zirconium and deposited on a stainless steel foil. An electrical potential difference varying from 300 to 2000 volts DC is used to separate pos-ions from neg-ions before they recombine in the plasma. Tritium machines allow precise dosages, but unfortunately tritium is so dangerous that it's illegal (except in fusion power plants). This, the tritium generators manufactured during this period were seized by the FDA.<p> During the 1960s, ion collectors drew air through an electrostatic field between parallel plates or concentric cylinders: the ions were collected on the plates. Present ion units apply a high voltage electrical signal directly to the air to create an intense electric field around the emitters.<p> Why not set up a monster ionizer over Manhattan? Well, safety dictates a size limit. Dr Robert Massy of the University of the Trees reported at the Ions and Light Conference that, whereas a 5 ,000-volt machine produces less than .05 parts per million of ozone (the limit allowed by the FDA), extremely high-voltage units invariably fail to meet standards.<p> Although most people in the U.S. are not ion-wise, generators have been popular elsewhere in the world for decades. In World War 11, Luftwaffe planes were negatively ionized by electric field generators, in order to reduce pilot fatigue. And it worked! (Electric field generators are like female ion generators: instead of ejecting ions, they attract them. Germany and the USSR use them in government buildings, hospitals, schools, factories, restaurants, health spas, beauty salons, homes, offices, cars and trucks. In Canada, Fred Soyka notes. "Ionization has become a household word. My book became a best-seller, and innumerable articles have come out.''<p> The U.S. has equipped nuclear submarines with ion machines. Ionizers are being used industrially in auto spray paint booths, food processing plants, grain storage bins and chemical spray factories.<p> Architects and designers are beginning to see the health benefits from fountains and rooftop solariums placed in urban environments, echoing the wisdom of their forefathers in the Roman culture. The growing recognition of our biological needs amidst our artificial interiors is opening up whole new industries armed at replicating nature indoors. In addition, we could all take Rosenberg's advice and wear underwear of polyvinyl chloride to attract neg-ions. From BVD's to PVC's then, it's the negative ion generation.<p> Several machines are now on the market for home and office use ranging in cost from about $70 to several thousand dollars You just plug them in and they ionize away. But, here are some considerations to keep In mind. If something or someone is between you and the generator, the ion count around you will drop. If you and the machine are in contact with the same dielectric material (as for instance, If it and your arms are on the same desk), a charge will build up between you and it, and this charge will repel ions. (Supposedly this doesn't happen with the latest machines.) Also, your own static charge will often repel ions, especially in dry indoor wintertime air. Synthetic clothing absorbs ions: wear cotton or wool, which have neutral charges.<p> At the Ions and Light Conference, Fred Soyka told New Realities of some in-progress Swiss research on ion machine frequencies. Frequencies of 60-100 Hz (cycles/sec) are stimulating to a person. while less than 25 Hz are relaxing. "If you have 60-100 Hz frequency machine," Soyka says "you may have trouble sleeping well with it on. Manufacturers ought to look into machines with adjustable frequency ranges. Some European machines already modulate frequency so people can dial their needs electrically.<p> A problem with ionizers has been determining their effectiveness. A typical generator may supposedly churn out 100 billion ions per second. But how many of them survive a yard past the machine? Ion counted do exist but up unto now no store or salesperson selling generators has had one around. Inexpensive units are now on the assembly line. Ion counters must be used carefully: within a room the ion concentration vanes a lot depending on how far you are from the generator. from conducting walls from charge buildup on insulating walls from curtains or draperies . Poor measurability panty explains why shoddy machines have been marketed (and confiscated by the FDA in the past. Today regrettably the field is still not without its quacks. According to Brute Sullivan. president of Environmental Sciences Corp. ''Some people Are selling generators for thousands One company calls its machine The Air Doctor.''<p> Advanced technology has eliminated main problems associated with previous ion devices. and as such there are more on the market today. Moreover, it is now possible to create higher voltages with lower current, thereby reducing or eliminating the production of ozone (Federal law prohibits the production of more than .05 parts per million or 50ppb of ozone). So to ensure that device meets the buyer's needs, one should carefully examine the manufacturer's literature.<p> In addition buyers should look for a warranty on parts and labor including a description of the room size affected by the machine. and even a money-back trial period offer. A list of authorized service centers should also be provided to the consumer. So caution is still the watchword since industry standardization has yet to be instituted, although industry standards for ion measurement and output are currently being drawn up by several manufacturers.<p> The first call for some kind of industry standards was issued by ion pioneer Igho Hart Kornblueh back in 1961: "Standardization of the generating and metering equipment by an independent authority would terminate the hasty and regrettable trend to market ion generator of questionable safety, quality and output."<p> Today Fred Soyka echoes his words: ''Measuring the sending capacity of these machines is very important. You should be able to say, like when you buy a 60 watt light bulb, "I'm getting an ionizer of this capacity, and to correlate that to room sizes." A giant step was taken at the Ions and Light Conference where the International BioEnvironmental Society was formed to set up standards and regulations within the industry. "We've already gone though our Inquisition on ionization," said president Bruce Sullivan. "We don't need another one.'' The Association is building a box within which the ion output of different machines can be counted at a standard distance and humidity.<p> Ions have been around for eons. Science has had its eye on the ion for 80 years. But public ignorance, generally non-ionized interiors and lack of generator standards, is the hallmark of a science and industry still in its infancy. Dr. E.R. Holiday thinks we know as much about air today as we did about 70 years ago when biochemists thought proteins, fat and carbohydrates were all we needed. Then a substance was discovered that prevented rickets: the first vitamin. Ions might well be, as Holiday suggests, "the vitamins of the air."<p> James Karnstedt is a writer, lecturer and researcher whose interests lie in the field of light, color, sound and ions as they affect human consciousness and health. He uses and considers the Electrocorp ionizers the best made on the market today.<p>  <hr>Return to:|   <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <a href="ionlight.html">Ion and Light</a>  |  <a href="portalmk.html">Portal Market</a>  |  <a href="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>    |<P><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

My interest is in results, so let us get right to the point.<p>Two systems of health care are available in this country today: conventional Western medicine and alternative medicine. The first is the world of the American Medical Association; medical doctors who practice by the book, and who inadvertently align themselves with the multibillion dollar pharmaceutical industry. Conventional medicine is superb when it comes to surgery, emergency, and trauma.<p>But there is no question that alternative medicine works better for just about everything else, especially for chronic degenerative diseases like cancer, heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and for more common ailments such as asthma, gastrointestinal disorders, headaches, and sinusitis.<p>Alternative medicine has a lot to offer you. But our government is ignoring its well established methods, and federal funds are not being sufficiently allocated to study them. We should all be asking, "Why"?<p>And that is te reason for this book. It represents the collective wisdom of thousands of alternative physicians and practitioners worldwide who are practicing the medicine of the future today.<p>The alternatives in this book are sound, as opposed to drug based therapies. I have seen dramatic healing in a wide range of serious cases, without the disturbing side effects mainstream medicine so often creates. The damage of strokes can be reversed, if caught early enough. Even the symptoms of AIDS can be reversed. The procedures are available and being used now, but you will not hear about them from your doctor.<p>You probably know someone who has had the experience of getting rid of one illness, only to come down with another from the procedure used by the doctor. Maybe that someone is you. People I love, including my own son and both of my parents, have suffered through medical procedures that were unnecessarily traumatic because their physicians neglected the basics. And yes, that makes me angry. But rather than hold onto that anger, I am going to work with you to change the system, by channeling our consumer medical dollars toward a more humane and effective medicine. Too many mainstream doctors today become so specialized they treat the body parts and forget they are treating a whole human being. Disease usually appears as a local symptom, but it is always related to the entire system. So you have to treat the whole person to cure the disease, and not just the symptom.<p>Return to  |<a href="#top">Top</a>  |<p>Naturally, you are thinking, if these methods were really any good, doctors would be using them. But it takes time for new ideas to be accepted. Back in Vienna in the 1800's, one doctor had the audacity to suggest to his colleagues that they wash their hands after they finish working on cadavers, rather than using their unwashed hands to deliver babies. He knew this would keep the women and their babies alive, by sparing them infections. But his colleagues ridiculed him. It took them thirty years to catch on and wash their hands. Imagine how many babies died because of such doctors who thought they knew it all?<p>I never expected the study of alternative medicine to become the passion of my life. But when the nineteen-year-old daughter of the woman I loved tried to commit suicide by slitting her wrists, I had to find a way to help. Most people would send her to a psychologist and figure that's the answer. But it wasn't the answer. Her therapist finally threw his hands up and suggested vitamin therapy, so we pursued it. We found out that the daughter's mental distress was caused by hypoglycemia, an imbalance caused by food allergies, problems in her pancreas, and an overgrowth of bad bacteria in her gastrointestinal tract. When she was treated for hypoglycemia, her mental illness disappeared. That troubled nineteen-year-old is now a healthy mother of eight children-seven girls and a boy.<p>That is how it started for me-seeing people who had serious mental illness being cured just by changing their lifestyle and diet and taking nutritional supplements. The amazing success I saw got me hooked. One Connecticut doctor, Marshall mandell, M.D.., dramatically showed me how a persons's state of mind could be affected when a substance to which they were allergic was placed under the tounge. He brought a very bright woman in and out of depression simply by placing different substances under her tounge. A single dose of one substance to which she was allergic caused her to put her head between her knees and cry. When she was given a reliving dose, she experienced instantaneous release.<p>This episode sparked my interest in environmental medicine, the study of how substances affect the body. FRom there I went on to study such alternatives as homeopathy, electromagnetic diagnosing and treatment, mind/body medicine, and the newest protocols for cancer and AIDS. After attending alternative medical conventions with a doctor who could explain doctor talk to me, my interest in new concepts in health care led me to Western Europe, Russia, and Israel. There I discovered people being cured of diseases, even the most serious, by methods never even heard of in our country. It is possible to reverse chronic disease. Many of the health problems you face can be solved simply, directly, and inexpensively without toxic side effects.<p>I keep checking out what is out there, what's new and what works. Your well-being--and that of every member of your family-depends upon knowing about these alternatives. Thats why a team of over 350 medical doctors, naturopaths, osteopaths, homeopaths, chiropractors, acupuncturists, scientists, researchers, and reporters have been assembled under the auspices of Future Medicine, Inc. to produce this work. This story has never been told before.<p>Return to  |<a href="#top">Top</a>  |<p><b>In Part One</b> we will lay out the new principles in medicine. You will learn what causes disease, what you can do to counter it, why so much of this important information is being supressed, and what steps you can take to help bring about change. You will also learn how to find the best health care practitioners, for you and your family.<p><b>In Part Two</b> we will introduce you to a wide range of alternative methods of treatment. Each chapter will tell you how each particular method of treatment works, what conditions it is best suited for treating, and how to use it yourself or locate a qualified practitioner.<p><b>In Part Three</b> we describe how alternative medicine treats epidemic twentieth century disease like AIDS, cancer, heart disease, and chronic pain. Over 30 conditions are covered in depth, with over 175 more cross-referenced alphabetically to provide you with information on the best self-care and professional treatments that deal with them. A more extensive cross-referencing of health conditions is provided in the index.<p>We have researched this in-depth, and now are ready to give you the straight story. Busy people do not like to waste their time. I have tried to give you the information as concisely as possible and in a way that is simple to understand. Our work is ongoing and we are committed to continuing our investigation and reporting the most current discoveries in alternative medicine.<p>Let me conclude by saying that I am not against mainstream, conventional medicine. The Chinese have a saying about the wisdom of "walking on both feet", which means using the best of Eastern and Western procedures. That's what I want to see us do. There is no single approach that works for all people, or with all conditions. This goes for alternative medicine as well.<p>Experience shows that you are likely to get the best results with a practitoner who has trained in a number of different modalities. There may be many underlying factors influencing your health-nutritional deficiency, poor digestion, toxicity from environmental pollutants, or mental and emotional stress. You want a practitioner who is capable of determining exactly what needs to be done to help you regain health and vitality. You also want an open-minded practitioner who treats you as an individual. What's good for Willard is not necessarily good for Colleen. You are biochemically unique.<p>Here is a most important, optimistic, and totally realistic thought to carry with you. Most everything is reversible. You need only to find the right therapies,<p>Be well!<p>Burton Goldberg<br>September, 1993<p> <hr>Return to:|  <a href="altmed.html">Alternative Medicine</a>  |  <a href="portalmk.html">Portal Market</a>  |  <a href="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>    |<P><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

How can they manage to survive undersuch harsh conditions, where pressure is consistently high and oxygen supply is very poor?.The secret lies in their livers, which account for 25% to 30% oftheir total body weight.<BR>In 1906 <B>Dr. Tsujimoto</B> of Japan discovered the shark liver extract,which was later identified as <B>Squalene</B>, with a chemical formulaC<SUB>30</SUB>H<SUB>50</SUB>.Chemically Squalene is an unsaturated hydrocarbon, which can easily produceoxygen by combining with water.Squalene has been extensively researched and, as an oxygen carrier, found to play a key role in maintaining health.<BR><B>Dr Noguchi</B> once said that "the cause of all illnesses is lack of oxygen". <BR>A curious trait of the shark is its apparent immunity to cancer and disease. Once regarded as an enemy, a primitive and powerful hunter of the deep, the shark in now being heralded as a lifesaver.This unique fish which has remained structurally unchanged for 400 million years, may provide us with the natural resistance we need to fight many of our most common modern diseases from colds to cancer.<BR>Another source of Squalene is <B>olive oil</B>, which has been traditionally known for its health effects.<BR>A related compound is Squalane used in skin care products. Squalane isderived from Squalene, but is more stable against oxidation.<BR>Other very useful properties of Squalane is its very low coagulation point (-55 degrees Celcius) and very high melting point (203 degrees Celcius), making it very suitable for lubrication.<BR><HR><P><A Name="article"></A>Detail description of the properties and uses of Squalene and Squalane can be found in:  <BR><EM> "Biological Role and Practical Uses of Squalene and Squalane"</EM><BR>by <B>Maurice L. Rosenthal</B><BR>in <EM>"COSMETICS AND THE SKIN"</EM><BR>by <B> I. Lubowe and F.V. Wells, editors</B><BR>Reinhold Publishing Corp., 1964.<BR>The following are excerpts from the above article:<UL><LI><A HREF="shark.html#squalene">Squalene</A> (C<SUB>30</SUB>H<SUB>50</SUB>)<LI><A HREF="shark.html#sebum">Sebum</A><LI><A HREF="shark.html#penetration">Penetration through human skin</A><LI><A HREF="shark.html#squalane">Squalane</A> (C<SUB>30</SUB>H<SUB>62</SUB>)</UL><H3><A NAME="squalene">Squalene (C<SUB>30</SUB>H<SUB>50</SUB>)</A></H3>"The triterpene Squalene is a highly unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon (C<SUB>30</SUB>H<SUB>50</SUB>) which is widely distributed in nature. It is found in small quantities in many vegetable oils, and in larger amounts in certain fish oils. Interest in its medical and cosmeto-dermatological significance was intensified when squalene was found in human sebaceous secretions, as a precursor of cholesterol, and when its possible anti-carcinogenic effect was described. It is the principal hydrocarbon of human surface lipids amounting up to 11 per cent of total surface fat. Its occurrence has been reported in dermoid cysts, cerumen, hair fat, and sebum. <BR>In attempting to assign a specific role to squalene in biochemical processes, many interesting developments took place. Squalene, a by-product of natural Vitamin A commercial production, also is converted on its biochemical path to cholesterol sysnthesis, into 7-dehydrocholesterol, which on irradiationbecomes Vitamin D. The very limited percutaneous absorption of Vitamin A in enhanced when the vitamin is dissolved in squalene. <BR>Studies in relation to its presence in ovarian dermoid cysts and depot fat of women led to its identification in vernix caseosa. It was then postulated that squalene plays an important part in embryological development.<BR>Investigation of the fungistatic effect of sebum on skin surfaces led to the observation that certain carcinogenic chemicals are inactivated when exposed to squalene over a period of time. Further studies on patients with epidermoid carcinoma suggested that squalene served as a protective agent in human sebum, as this is the usual type of carcinoma which arises after exposure to carcinogenic hydrocarbons, excessive exposure to sunlight, and ultraviolet rays."<BR><H3><A NAME="sebum">Sebum</A></H3>"Sebum provides the normal lubricant of hairy and no-hairy skin. It keeps the skin supple and forms a protective bacterial and fungicidal coating on the skin and in the pilosebaceous apparatus. This fatty cover helps to keep moisture on the skin surface."<BR>Squalene occurs naturally in the human sebum, as can be seen from the following:<BR>"When human sebum was separated from epithelial lipids, its average composition was calculated as follows:"<BR><TABLE BORDER><TR><TD>Free fatty acids<TD>5%</TR><TR><TD>Glycerides<TD>50%</TR><TR><TD>Waxes<TD>20%</TR><TR><TD><B>Squalene</B><TD>10%</TR><TR><TD>Other hydrocarbons<TD>5%</TR><TR><TD>Cholesteryl esters<TD>4%</TR><TR><TD>Cholesterol (free)<TD>1%</TR><TR><TD>Other sterols<TD>1%</TR><TR><TD>Other substances<TD>4%</TR></TABLE><H3><A NAME="penetration">Penetration through human skin</A></H3>"The topical application of medicaments to the skin forms the basis of most dermatological therapy. Such application has many advantages, such as absence of pain and of bad taste, simplcity and ease of administration, and high concentration at the desired site. It is the only method by which a high local concentration of drugs in the skin can be achieved without undesirable systemic side-effects.In many instances, it would be advantageous if the rate of penetration of medicaments through the epidermis could be increased. This would help in bringing about a more rapid and profound action of the locally applied compounds. If penetration (transfollicular, transepidermal, and into the horny layer) could be increased, many new compounds could be introduced into therapy.<BR>Hence, the importance of sebum and its main hydrocarbon squalene in cosmeto-dermatological field.

On the other hand, squalane does not aid transepidermal penetration, nor dissolve the cementing substance of the horny layer."<BR>"The cosmetologist has found in squalane a natural emolient. It imparts to the skin a suppleness without an unpleasant greasy feel. It readily forms emulsions with fixed oils and lipophilic substances and does not oxidize nor turn rancid. Squalane has also been found to accelerate dye-dispersion in lipsticks, producing a high gloss and acting as a long lasting fixative for perfumes. When applied to wshed or sun exposed skin and hair, squalane helps to restore the lost oils.

Both ingredients are used at concentrations ranging from =< 0.1 to>= 50 percent in a variety of cosmetics. Because cosmetics containingSqualane and Squalene are applied to all body surfaces, these compounds maypotentially enter the body through the skin, eyes, lungs, mouth, or otherroutes.Squalene can form peroxides on exposure to air, while Squalane is stable toair and oxygen. Animal studies indicate Squalane is slowly absorbed throughthe skin, while both compounds are poorly absorbed from thegastrointestinal tract. Squalene is a metabolic precursor of cholesteroland other steroids.<BR>The acute toxicity of these ingredients by all routes in animals is low. At100 percent concentrations, both compounds are nonirritants to rabbit skinand eyes. According to clinical evidence of formulations containingSqualane, the compound is not a significant skin irritant orsensitizer.<BR>Limited contact sensitization tests indicate that Squalene is not asignificant contact allergen or irritant.Reversible depilation is reported from topical application of Squalene toanimals, but limited human studies did not show any such effect.

<html><a name=top></a><head><title>Abraham International (Inversion Theraphy)</title><P><body bgcolor="#BOE2FF"lskyblu1="#BOE2FF"><center><IMG SRC="abe.gif"></center></a><hr><h2>INVERSION THERAPY: A NATURAL APPROACH TO CORRECTING BACK PROBLEMS</h2><p>So you think hanging upside down to relieve back pain is some wacky, new-age idea?  Think again.  It&iacute;s believed that inversion was used as early as 400 B.C., when Hippocrates, the father of medicine, first watched a patient have his knees and ankles tied to a ladder to be hoisted upside down for a dose of what&iacute;s come to be known as spinal traction.<p>The Greek theories on inversion are still valid, but today there is a much easier way to relieve the back pains most people experience from time to time.  The process is called inversion therapy, and it can be the natural way to a better back and a better body.<p>Back pain is one of the most common physical complaints in the world.  Every day, it&iacute;s estimated that some eleven million Americans struggle to get through a day complicated by an aching back. In the United States alone, some 93 million workdays are lost each year due to back problems.  There is overwhelming evidence that spending a few minutes each day hanging upside down can be beneficial to your back, and to your general health, by simply counteracting the continuous downward pull of gravity.  Hang Ups inversion equipment offers a safe and comfortable way for anyone to benefit from the soothing sensation of inversion.<p>The concept of turning the body upside down for better health has been around for centuries.  In yoga, the &igrave;Shirsonana&icirc; headstand position has been used by yoga practitioners as a rather painful form of &igrave;postural exchange&icirc; (reversing the direction of gravity).  However, not everyone wants to do headstands, and that created the market for Hang Ups inversion tables, gravity boots, and racks.<p>Over time, the compressive force of gravity is particularly harsh on the spine because of the  flattening effect on the spinal discs.  The intervertebral discs act as shock absorbers between the vertebra, and consist of a cartilage covering which surrounds a gelatin-like center. Combine the compressive effect of gravity with stress, weak back and stomach muscles, or an exercise program, and you have all of the ingredients for back pain.<p>There are a minimum of 32 pounds per square inch (psi) of pressure on each spinal disc, even when a person is lying down.  When we stand up, the pressure triples to about 100 psi.  And when you sit down, spinal disc pressure rises to a whopping 225 pounds per square inch!  Inverting the body is the only way to completely reverse the negative effects of gravity.<p>Of course, it&iacute;s impossible to offset the &igrave;postural debt&icirc; of a lifetime just by jumping on an inversion table.  But by spending a few minutes inverted each day, two or three times a day, people begin to feel results by the end of the first week.  After a month of inversion, most people don&iacute;t know how they ever got along without it.<p>Both physicians and chiropractors report positive results from using natural gravity-inversion traction with patients.  A neurosurgeon in San Francisco says, &igrave;It [inversion] seems to get people over the acute phase quicker than other forms of therapy.  We believe that inversion can benefit the discs, strengthen ligaments and soft tissues, and relieve muscle spasms.  We&iacute;ve also had success with patients suffering from herniated discs.<p>Besides providing relief from back pain, a daily dose of inversion can help to promote good health by correcting common spinal alignment problems, eliminating tension headaches, reducing hemorrhoids, alleviating the discomfort of varicose veins, and stimulating mental alertness.<p>Inversion was popularized by Dr. Robert Martin, a Pasadena orthopedic specialist.  Dr. Martin encouraged his patients to pursue an inversion-therapy program as a first-round alternative to back surgery.  He provided relief to hundreds of patients through inversion, and patented his own brand of inversion equipment in 1963.<p>In 1982, Dr. Martin told The Wall Street Journal, &igrave;It&iacute;s very simple why inversion works.  All day long we&iacute;re either standing or sitting, with gravity pressing down on us.  Hanging by the feet allows our bodies to decompress, our spines to be realigned, and our joints to separate.  A little inversion goes a long way, and the relief it brings is often almost instantaneous.<p>Quite simply, inversion allows gravity to help the body to naturally correct and align itself.  You stretch out and elongate your spine, get blood to the brain, invert and reposition internal organs, and take stress off of the heart, which usually has to pump blood &igrave;uphill&icirc; to the brain.<p>As with any new exercise program, if someone is in doubt about their level of fitness, or if they are over the age of 40, consult a physician before starting an inversion program.  Inversion is not recommended for people with extreme weight problems, those with a history of stroke, acute back injuries, or high blood pressure, and it is very important that people with these conditions consult with their doctor before trying inversion.  Also, individuals who have bone disease, retinal detachment, or any other serious eye disorders would be advised to avoid inversion without their doctors permission.<p>For someone with a back problem about to begin a program of inversion therapy, Hang Ups has a few helpful suggestions.<p>Begin slowly: Invert only 15 to 20 degrees at first, and stay inverted only as long as it feels comfortable, which may only be a few seconds at first.  Remarkably, you can gain all of the benefits of inversion without ever fully inverting yourself.  Most people find 20 to 60 degrees of decline adequate and very comfortable.<p>Make changes gradually: Increase the angle of decline only if it is comfortable, and only increase the angle a few degrees at a time.  The Hang Ups F5000III inversion table has a tether strap to help people stay within their inversion range.  People can add rocking back and forth (rhythmic traction) to their inversion program once they feel comfortable.<p>Pay attention to your body: You&iacute;re unique, and your body will tell you what&iacute;s good for it.  You determine the pace when adapting to the inverted world.<p>Keep moving while inverted: Use intermittent traction (pull and release) or rhythmic traction to encourage blood, lymph, and spinal fluid circulation.  Moving, twisting, stretching, and light exercise while inverted aids in the alignment of bones and organs while minimizing any increase in blood pressure, but strenuous exercise is not recommended while inverted.  Just relax and enjoy!<p>Do it regularly: There are a variety of inversion programs and exercises.  Trust yourself to find the approach that&iacute;s best for you, and then do it every day.  Two or three short sessions a day seem to work best for most people.<p> Based on years of research and the testimonials of hundreds of people who have found relief from back pain, inversion is a powerful, natural option for people who want to relieve lower back pain.  Sometimes there&iacute;s an explanation for why inversion works, and sometimes there isn&iacute;t - it works for some and not for others.  We only know that, for many people, literally &igrave;turning their world upside down&icirc; through inversion therapy can provide an alternative to drugs and surgery in a life filled with daily pain.<p>	<hr>Return to:|     <a href="abeintl.html">Abraham International</a>  |  <a href="portalmk.html">Portal Market</a>  |  <a href="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>    |<P><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995-1996 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

As athletes increase the duration or the intensity of an activity the body is forced to adapt to the increased stress and grow stronger.  In its simplest form that&iacute;s the process of &igrave;exercise,&icirc; and it&iacute;s how we condition our bodies and more become fit.<p>What may not be so easily recognized are the potentially negative effects exercise can have on the body as athletes pursue fitness and recreation activities. The most powerful force athletes must overcome, both during and after training, is one of  the immutable laws of nature: gravity.<p>Unless someone spends time as an astronaut, gravity is with the athlete every day.  In the search for ultimate fitness, physical activity only increases the compressive effect of gravity on the spine and organs.  Inverting the body is a naturally restorative process that cuts across every form of physical activity to help reduce spinal compression, the build up of lactic acid in the muscles, and the slight skeletal &igrave;misalignments&icirc; athletes create during exercise.  Inversion can indeed benefit every athlete.<p>The daily use of what&iacute;s come to be known as inversion therapy, hanging by the lower limbs and allowing body weight to decompress the spine, is a simple, yet highly therapeutic way of naturally creating a mild form of spinal traction.  It&iacute;s a way to counteract the forces that compress the spine when sitting, standing, or exercising.  Additionally, by hanging upside down, a mild stretch is placed on the calves, shins, quadriceps, buttocks, and the lower and upper back which can also relieve the tension created by various activities.<p>Inverting the body for only a few minutes twice a day in simulated weightlessness will decompress spinal discs, relax muscles, realign the spine, and reduce stress and tension. Inversion provides an optimal method of relaxation for the upper body and back.  Inversion will stretch and decompress the back muscles while promoting better circulation of blood, fluids, and waste products.<p> Hang Ups has categorized four groups of athletic activities which can receive substantial benefit from inversion therapy.<p><b>COMPRESSION	FATIGUE</b><p>	Nearly every physical activity involves some form of compression of the spine. The compressive effect of gravity is compounded by activities such as running, weightlifting, aerobics, skiing and biking which can exact an incredible toll on the spine, discs, and muscles.<p><b>ONE-SIDED SPORTS</b><p>		One-sided activities may be the most damaging and troublesome for the athlete for two reasons; one, because the body will tend to compensate for the strong-side muscle groups, pulling the spine out of alignment, and two because these activities involve rotation of the spine, often under incredible loads.  Examples of these activities are golf, water skiing, tennis, bowling,  racquetball, and baseball.<p><b>STRETCHING SPORTS</b><p>		Stretching activities tend to create tension in the muscles due to contraction of the major muscle groups and the body positions maintained while performing the activity.  In-line skating, swimming, windsurfing, and rowing are examples of activities which, while stretching the muscles and ligaments, tend to create a great deal of lower back strain.  Athletes in these sports can receive a tremendous recuperative boost from daily inversion therapy.<p><b>INVERTED ACTIVITIES</b><p>	Man operates in an upright position, with our orientation in the gravitational field being established through several sensory cues.  When we find ourselves upside down it&iacute;s disorienting, and sometimes uncomfortable.  But the performance of inverted activities can be enhanced significantly through inversion training.  For skydivers, gymnast&iacute;s, springboard divers, and scuba divers, inversion therapy fine tunes the body and the inner ear to the inverted world.<p>Two methods of inversion are currently available from Hang Ups for the athlete.<p><b>EZ -UP INVERSION SYSTEM </b><p> This is the classic form of inversion made famous by Richard Gere&iacute;s role in the movie &igrave;American Gigolo.&icirc;  By using the EZ-UP inversion rack (a modified, dual-handle chin bar with lower handholds) hung between a doorway, and a pair of flexible, padded SL Spyder Gravity Boots, athletes can hook their ankles over the inversion bar to experience the benefits of inversion.<p>However, using the boot and bar allows the athlete to only hang in one position - completely upside down.  Hanging free from a bar enables the user to stretch, twist, rock back and forth, and perform sit-ups, plus it helps to orient athletes to their body position while inverted.  And while complete inversion does provide an optimal level of spinal traction, it&iacute;s not for everyone.  The EZ-UP Inversion System is best suited for the active, fit person.<p><b>F5000III INVERSION TABLE </b><p>On the other hand, an inversion table allows someone to put themselves into an inverted position very easily, and with greater control.  An athlete can choose varying degrees of inversion to gradually become comfortable with the process.  The Hang Ups F5000III table has a tether strap to hold the inversion table at any level of decline, and SL Spyder Gravity Boots can be used with the table for added comfort during extended hang times or while doing light exercises.<p>Using an inversion table works on the same principle as the teeter-totter; by adjusting the table to your height, and then making an adjustment for your upper body weight, you can &igrave;balance&icirc; the inversion table.  Raising the arms above the head will make the table go into a more inverted position.  By lowering the arms to the waist the table will return to the more upright position.<p>With a little practice, it&iacute;s easy to quickly move the body back and forth from the head-up to the head-down position.  This rhythmic oscillation improves circulation throughout the body, draws fluid to the spinal discs, and creates a natural pumping action for the lymph system, one of the prime movers of waste products in the body.<p>No matter which method an athlete chooses, the reason inversion can be so stimulating for the body, and so relaxing for the mind, is because inversion decompresses the spine and increases the circulation and flow of fluids throughout the body and to the brain.  At the same time, being inverted allows the muscles to temporarily stop contracting in their constant attempt to maintain an upright body position against the force of gravity.<p>All athletes should acquaint themselves with inversion therapy.  From the broad spectrum of recreational athletes needing a decompressive stretch after a workout, to the professional athlete who has to be at full strength for the next days event, inversion has a place in their training program.  The benefits of allowing the body to naturally realign and relax every day are simply too substantial to overlook in the quest for athletic improvement.<p>	 	<hr>Return to:|     <a href="abeintl.html">Abraham International</a>  |  <a href="portalmk.html">Portal Market</a>  |  <a href="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>    |<P><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995-1996 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

Metallic minerals are taken up from the soil by the plants roots & transformed by the plant's roots & tissues into a form that is 98-100% absorbable by the body. These colloidal molecules  are 7000 times smaller than a red blood cell with a negative charge which is attracted to the positively charged lining of the intestine. Supplemental fiber can interfere with the body's absorption of minerals. Therefore, it is recommended that fiber and minerals be taken at different times.<p>Vitamins are indeed marvelous, but they still are not as marvelous as minerals, a fact that surprises most people. We can survive a relatively long time without vitamins, not so without minerals. Charles Northern, MD., a government consultant and one of the earliest nutritional physicians, explained the reason many years ago. He said: "It is not commonly realized that the vitamins control the body's appropriation of minerals...in the absence of minerals vitamins have no function. Lacking vitamins, the system can make use of minerals, but lacking minerals, the vitamins are useless." (US Senate document #264)<p>This means we can get along without vitamins, perhaps, but we cannot get along without minerals. The reason for this is that the human body can manufacture some of the vitamins (the B vitamins in the intestinal tract, vitamin D from sunshine, as examples), but the body cannot manufacture its own minerals. They must be supplied by food, water or supplementation.<p>According to Bernard Spur, Ph.D., all life, whether vegetable, animal or human, depends upon minerals. When they are adequately supplied they make a strong, healthy body. When they are lacking, individually or collectively disease sets in.<p>Dr. Melchior Dikkers, a retired professor of biochemistry at Loyola University  Los Angeles believes that mineral-starved foods threaten millions of Americans despite the country's reputation of being "the best fed nation on earth." Dr. Dikkers says: Malnutrition exists in the US but it is not caused by lack of food, but lack of nutrients in the food due to mineral-poor soil, chemical fertilizers, preservatives and refining processes used in food preparation."<p>Fewer vitamins as well as proteins may be required if the mineral supply is abundant. Ragner Berg, a researcher, discovered in his experiments that if minerals were sufficiently supplied to the body in proper balance, a lesser amount of daily protein would be necessary. There are many amazing cases of regeneration from adding minerals alone to the diet. There is also significant evidence that the healthiest and longest lived cultures in the world have at least one thing in common, a rich supply of minerals in their diet.<p><center><h2>MAJOR MINERALS AND TRACE MINERALS</h2></center><p><blockquote><b>"The unquenchable basic mineral needs of our human flesh cry out from the waiting rooms of physicians offices, hospital wards and mortuaries."</b></blockquote><br>								<b>Dr. Joel Wallach</b><p>The major minerals occur in the body, and are needed in large amounts. Calcium, phosphorous and magnesium are some examples.<p>Trace minerals are not called minor minerals because they are to important to be considered lesser elements. But since they only exist in very tiny amounts, or in traces, they are known as the trace minerals.<p> <center><h2>THE GENERAL FUNCTION OF MINERALS IN THE BODY</h2></center><p><ol><li>They act as electrolytes, which carry electromagnetic              currents through the body.<li>They act as specific building blocks.<li> They carry nutrients to the cells and help keep the    osmotic pressure around the cells normal, so fluids &    nutrients can pass in and out of cells properly.<li> They are the materials that help keep the blood and other     body fluids at the proper pH (acid-alkaline balance).     Approx. 7.34-7.44, much beyond this range & life cannot        be sustained.</ol><p><center>ACID-ALKALINE BALANCE AND MINERAL DEPLETION</center><p>An acid bloodstream is often caused by a diet too high in protein. Protein foods are very high in sulfur and phosphorous. As protein is metabolized in the body these elements remain as sulfuric or phosphoric acids. Too much protein can cause a deficiency in important alkaline minerals such as calcium, sodium, magnesium and potassium because they are constantly being used to neutralize the excess acids in the high protein diet, instead of carrying on their normal chemical activities in the blood. If these acids are not normally neutralized, the kidneys must eliminate them, and too much acid on a regular basis may cause kidney damage.<p>Another way that the body reserves its alkaline minerals is to deposit these excess acid substances in the tissue and joints. It is believed that this may lead to degenerative diseases such as arthritis and cancer.<p>As part of cellular metabolism acids are naturally produced in the body. On a high acid diet (meat, dairy, wheat, eggs, refined, chemicalized pr preserved food) we can become mineral deficient even if we are taking supplements. This is because our minerals are being used to neutralize the excess acids in the blood instead of carrying on their normal functions. We are mainly concerned with deficiencies in calcium, potassium, magnesium and sodium. These are the major acid buffers in the body.<p>New Vision Essential Colloidal minerals have been formulated to help supply the body with an excellent  balance of major, trace and rare earth minerals.<p><blockquote><b>"Our Earth is anemic! In short this means we can no longer get the 60 nutritional minerals we need from our food and if we are to sustain ourselves and our children physically and mentally we must very consciously supplement our daily intake of food with the 60 nutritional minerals just as we consciously make sure our Mercedes has the finest motor oil in it!"</blockquote></b><br>				<b>Dr. Joel Wallach and Dr. Ma Lan</b><p><hr>Return to:|     <a href="abeintl.html">Abraham International</a>  |  <a href="portalmk.html">Portal Market</a>  |  <a href="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>    |<P><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995-1996 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

Keep in mind that there are 20 tribes of time comprising the planetary holons. These holons are in constant circulation around the planet. Each  of the 20 tribes has a place to energize the Earth, even though the holons are in constant motion. The Earth Holons are divided into 5 Earth Families. You must learn which tribe you are, so you can determine what family you are in. If you do not know what tribe you are email <a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com">Rinri Bridge Game</a> and your tribe will be given to you.( Refer to Planet Holon Chart below showing tribes in their Earth Families)<p>In order to synchronize the human mind with the biosphere it is necessary to look at how the color coded 73 Chromatics maintain the biomass constant. The image above shows the biomass constant which is the biospheric law by which the invariance of the quantity and the continuity of the biodiversity is maintained. The perfected human means of maintaining the biomass constant is through the 73 perfect five-day sequences known as the " Chromatics of the Biomass Constant." These are also referred to as 'overtone chromatics." Without the music software in place we will not concern ourselves with the sound at this time but only the color sequences.<p>Each sequence of five days is color coded red, white, blue, or yellow. The sequence begins this year with Blue Storm Tribe, and there are 365 days in the year divided by 5 giving 73 chromatics. Each sequence runs from South Pole to the Noth Pole, and stopping at the family before the South Pole. Put another way. Each sequence runs from a Gateway to a Signal Family seal. On the  planet holon (below) this means that each chromatic run begins at the South Pole, Gateway Family, then jumps the next day to the North Pole, Polar family. The sequence always ends in the southern temperate zone, Signal Family.<P><center><IMG SRC="ertholon2.gif"></center><center>Stationary  Chromatics of the Biomass Constant on Earth</center><p>In the Human Holon the Gateway corresponds to the Root Center, the Polar to the Crown. Each time you coordinate an overtone chromatic, from the first to the second days the movement jumps from your root to crown centers. The fifth day is the solar plexus and when you leave the solar plexus you move into the Kuxan Suum, the etheric thread that connects you to the galaxy. This then is the 2nd move, and it is a key move for biotelepathic attunement of human mind and biosphere-73 times a year. Follow the chromatics of the biomass constant and participate in the biogeomagnetic stabilization of the planet.

<html><a name=top></a><head><title> Jose Arguelles</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFE4B5"moccasin="#FFE4B5"><P><IMG align="left" SRC="speakout.gif"><br><ul><center><H2>Jos&eacute Speaks Out</H2></center><P></ul><p><br clear=left><hr><p><b>Jos&eacute; Arg&uuml;elles Speaks Out</b><p>	I, Jos&eacute; Arg&uuml;elles, called the Harmonic Convergence, August 16-17, 1987. I had been told of these prophetic dates by Tony Shearer in 1970, many years before I met Hunbatz Men (early 1985). In 1987, I wrote The Mayan Factor  based on 33 years of research and study. Prior to <i>The Mayan Factor </i>, in 1975, I wrote <i>The Transformative Vision </i> whose historical scheme was based on the prophecy of the Thirteen Heavens and Nine Hells which ended with the Harmonic Convergence in 1987. In 1984, my book <i>Earth Ascending </i>was published utilizing my studies of the Tzolkin as a self-existing mathematical code unlocking the patterns underlying the evolution of the collective human consciousness.<p>		If I had not called the Harmonic Convergence and written The Mayan Factor  which focused unprecedented popular attention on the <i>Tzolkin,</i> <i>Haab, </i>and all other aspects of the Mayan Calendar, including many original mathematical analyses, outside of the Day Keepers in Mayab, there would be no Mayan Calendar movement anywhere in the world today.<p>	I did not arrive at my understanding of these matters lightly, nor without profound research, contemplation, and consideration. In 1989, at the first opening of the Mayan Initiatic Centers at Palenque, Chiapas, Hunbatz Men honored me by inviting me to make the opening public presentation. At this time I also personally met Alberto Ruz Buenfils, son of Alberto Ruz who discovered the tomb of Pacal Votan in 1952. I might add that it was I who introduced Hunbatz Men to Barbara Hand Clow of Bear & Co. who then published translations of Hunbatz Men's two books, <i>Mayan Science/Religion </i> and <i>Hunab Ku.</i><p>	Pursuing my research late in 1989, I went on to make the discovery of the 13:20, the correct timing frequency known and codified by the ancient Maya in their calendars, and the false 12:60 artificial timing frequency codified in the Vatican's Gregorian Calendar and the mechanical clock. From this fundamental scientific discovery, with the aid of my wife, Lloydine, I discovered and brought forth the tools known as the <i>Dreamspell: Journey of Timeship Earth 2013,</i> the final proofs of the mathematical codes underlying what is known as the Mayan calendar. The <p>Dreamspell </i>itself is predicated on the use and acceptance of the Thirteen Moon 28 Day Calendar.  Without the <i>Dreamspell ,</i> there would certainly be no Mayan calendar movement at all on as vast a scale as it exists today.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>	The Harmonic Convergence, <i>The Mayan Factor, </i>and the <i>Dreamspell </i>are all based on the July 26 synchronization date. It was by following the calendar based on this synchronization date that I was able to verify the Harmonic Convergence as a test of Mayan time science. This synchronization date (July 16 before 1582) was used long before Bishop de Landa had pangs of conscience concerning his book burning. This date of July 26 belongs to the prophetic tradition of the <i>Chilam Balam,</i> which is the only tradition maintaining a continuity with the era of the Long Count, which ended with the completion of Baktun 10, AD 830. The tradition of the prophetic texts and the July 26 date of the <i>Chilam Balam  </i>precedes the time of the conquest and extends, with the <i>Codex Perez ,</i> well into the Nineteenth Century.<p>	To use March 21 as the synchronization date may be good for the Northern Hemisphere, but for the Southern Hemisphere that date marks the Fall Equinox. This does not make good sense for all Peoples of the planet. It is important to avoid ethnocentric positions of all kinds including the Mayan. The point of the Mayan Calendar and its mathematical codes is that they are universal and transcend ethnic and local geographical interests.<p>	The Harmonic Convergence, the discovery of the 12:60-13:20 timing frequencies and the Dreamspell, are for the entire planet and not necessarily to promote a provincial Mayan revival. To repeat: there would be no Mayan revival nor Mayan calendar movement of any kind today had there not been a Harmonic Convergence, a <i>Mayan Factor, </i>and a <i>Dreamspell.</i>	The point of all of my work has been to arrive at a planetary, whole systems perspective. We have a planetary problem. The entire planet is operating with the wrong calendar and living in the wrong, artificial timing frequency, the 12:60. This planetary problem can only be corrected by planetary use of the correct calendar operating according to the correct 13:20 timing frequency. The correct and biologically accurate calendar for the whole planet is the Thirteen Moon 28-Day Calendar correlated to the July 26 synchronization date. The entire Neo-Mayanist Calendar movement that has arisen following all of my initial work misses this planetary point completely.<p>	Precisely because the point was being missed by virtually everyone, the <p>Telektonon Prophecy of Pacal Votan </i>  was triggered into manifestation on the prophetic date Kin 144, July 26, 1993, thus initiating the first of the Seven Years of Prophecy. There are such matters as divine revelation and new dispensations. There are Messengers who do bring good tidings and warnings to all humanity. The Prophecy of Pacal Votan sealed in his tomb, Long Count date, 9.13.0.0.0, AD 692, was meant to be revealed precisely at this time, precisely for the purpose of announcing to all humanity the need to reject the false colonialist Gregorian Calendar and to accept the correct Thirteen Moon 28-Day Calendar. Through my knowledge and life-time work, I am the heir of the legacy of Pacal Votan and the instrument of his prophecy, <i>Telektonon..</i><p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>	For three years with my wife and assistant, Lloydine, I have traveled around the planet, without asking for recompense, communicating Pacal Votan's prophetic message of thirteen moons to all peoples regardless of their religion, culture, or creed. In these three years, the Neo- Mayanists have spread, but with little knowledge of the 13:20-12:60 timing frequencies and their implications for a planetary game plan.<p>	The Thirteen Moon Calendar and the Haab are perfectly correlated on the Dreamspell Galactic Compass. It is superstition to believe that this mathematical perfection should not be so. The Thirteen Moon Calendar is the salvation for humanity living in biospheric sovereignty. The Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement is not a Neo-Mayanist revival, but is based on the scientific discovery of the 12:60-13:20 timing frequencies. The 12:60-13:20 timing frequencies are prophetically confirmed by the dates of the dedication of the tomb of Pacal Votan, AD 692, to the time of its opening, AD 1952--1260 years--and to the conclusion of the Thirteen Baktuns, AD 2012--1320 years.<p>	In the three years of its activation, the Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement has spread to all parts of the world. Eighteen countries were represented at the First Planetary Congress of Biospheric Rights, Brazilia, Solar Moon 11-15, Third Year of Prophecy (26 years to the dates precisely of the First Whole Earth Festival, March 17-21, 1970). The Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement is a new human community transcending all 12:60 fictions of national interest and money. The power of the Thirteen Moon Calendar, which includes the Tzolkin and Haab, vindicates the truth of the original Mayan Calendar. The <i>Telektonon, Game of Prophecy  </i>restores the power of telepathy through the use of the Thirteen Moon Calendar. The mathematical proofs underlying the 12:60-13:20 timing frequency are now available in my book, <i>The Call of Pacal Votan, Time Is the Fourth Dimension.</i><p>	The<i> Dreamspell,</i> like the <i>Telektonon</i>, and the Thirteen Moon Calendar itself are intended as a gift for all of humanity. People may take from the <i>Dreamspell </i>or dismiss it all together in favor of a Neo-Mayanist approach as they so choose. But that is like having a horse pull a car, when the car runs perfectly well by itself. Incidentally, the dates of the Thirteen Moon Calendar are only one day off from the traditional dates of the thirteen houses or constellations of the Mayan zodiac (see Hugh Harleston, <i>The Mayan Zodiac)</i>.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>	The point of the Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement is to return all of humanity to the natural 13:20 timing frequency before it is too late. The Thirteen Moon Calendar is the perfect instrument for this task, and is prophetically ordained to synchronize on the July 26 date. There are powerful agents who do not wish to see the Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement succeed. The continuing controversy over starting dates perpetrated by the Neo-Mayanists only plays into the hands of these agents.<p>	Whether we are Neo-Mayanists or followers of the Thirteen Moon Calendar, we have much more in common than not. Let us come together on this one common point of July 26 and peacefully take the rest of the world with us. We are too few in number to bog down in divisiveness at this critical time. Once we have succeeded in placing humanity in the correct timing frequency with the correct calendar, we can work out our minor differences.

It is the purpose of the Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement to prepare humanity for this momentous transition. The instruments of the Thirteen Moon Calendar, Telektonon, and Dreamspell are the tools to assist humanity in this impending process.<p>The sacred promise of Earth Ascending is the revelation of the psi bank-the Qur'anic "Book of Clear Records." The psi bank is the registration of all knowledge made consciously available through the elevation of mind to its fourth-dimensional functioning. The condition of mind in its fourth-dimensional functioning is the telepathic unification known as the noosphere-the mental sphere of the planet which is the invisible flowering and consequent transformation of the biosphere.<p>The achievment of the biosphere-noosphere transition is the realization of Earth Sovereignty, the borderless emergence of bio-regionalism and the cessation of nation states with their attendant culture of war. The rule of Earth Sovereignty is telepathy itself, God's natural fourth-dimensional government.<p>In a sovereign Earth, there is only one law, just as there is only one creator. In Earth Ascending this law is called holonomy, the law that governs the whole, and which allows each part to participate in and reflect the whole. Man's 12:60 government, the Tower of Babel, is a cover-up of this law by the creation of innumerable laws, each more tenuous and unenforceable than the last. According to Telektonon, this primal all-governing law of creation is called the Law of the Cube. The 13:20 timing frequency is the realization of this law as the unifying field of fourth-dimensional time.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>The clouded mental field of humanity operating at the artificial, accelerating machine frequency of 12:60 is actually at conflict with the innate 13:20 timing frequency of the planet and the galactic whole. The Earth's resonance is registered at 7.8 Hz. This number is a fractal of 78, which is a multiple of 13 (x6), and hence, a function of the 13:20 timing frequency. Unless humanity shifts its mental frequency it will bring about a greater and greater dissonance, resulting in the type of disaster that destroyed the planet Maldek, producing the asteroid belt. This point underscores the critical importance of the  Thirteen Moon Calendar Change as the first stage of Earth ascending to its sacred dimension.<p>Holonomics, the study of the one law, distinguishes three levels of wholeness. Each whole is termed a holon. There is the time holon, the tetrahedral geometry of the union of the 1st, 5th, 9th, and 13th positions of the wavespell. Encompassing the geometry of time, this is the master holon which governs all third-dimensional manifestations.<p>The next level is the planet holon which is the icosahedral (20-part) structure of the planet telepathically governed by the five Earth families. The activation of the noosphere and the creation of the telepathic field of governance is dependent on the success of the galactic lottery in assigning all human beings their galactic signatures.<p>The third and microcosmic level is the human holon. The thirteen joints of the body, the five bio-psychic centers, and the digital coding of the 20 solar frequencies in the 20 finger and toes equip the human as the biological species to consciously bring about the telepathic field of the noosphere. In fact, this is the evolutionary purpose and fulfillment of the human genetic program: to bring about an Earth ascending and return to God's natural sacred order of fourth-dimensional time.<p>The realization of the human holon as the microconductor of the planet holon operating within the holon of time lays the groundwork for the creation of galactic culture: the realiztion of humanity as a planetary art spore in communion with the great cosmic forces and intelligences functioning throughout the galaxy.<p><hr>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<hr><p><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

The human violation of time     is rooted in the irregular twelve-month Gregorian Calendar. In     order to keep the human violation in time from a course of     complete self-destruction, and on behalf of the preservation of     the planet's biosphere, an immediate end is called to the use of     the Gregorian Calendar and its attendant institutions, to be     replaced by the biologically accurate Thirteen Moon Calendar and     the new +human Covenant of Biospheric Rights.<p>     The use of the Gregorian Calendar is henceforth desanctioned and     declared null and void. Since all currently constituted     institutions and governments are functions of this calendar, they,     too, are now desanctioned and considered null and void. Therefore,     the First Planetary Congress of Biospheric Rights is called for     the restoration of the human species within natural time through     the instrument of the biologically accurate Thirteen Moon     Calendar, and for the creation of a new human covenant of     Biospheric Rights and its accompanying resolutions as the basis     for the declaration of Universal Peace, inclusive of the     comprehensive design plans for the conversion of human     civilization into a Planetary Culture of Peace.<p><IMG align="left" SRC="smpacal.gif"><a name=covnant><b>New Covenant: Preamble</b></a><p>     The time has come for a simpler voice and a new time. The voice is     here. It is the voice of the people world-wide following the     Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Plan. The new time is here. It     is the time of the Thirteen Moon Calendar. In replacing the     twelve-month Gregorian Calendar of the old time, the new time of     the thirteen moons has come. The new calendar is the basis and the     opportunity for a new human covenant.<p>     The new covenant is the Covenant of Biospheric Rights. Why?     Because the biosphere is the all-inclusive planetary life-support     system of which we humans constitute an integral living member.     The biosphere is the larger unifying field of life on Earth which     transcends all nation states, and alliances of nation states,     inclusive of the United Nations. Therefore, the new Covenant of     Biospheric Rights replaces the legitimacy formerly held by the     nation states.<p>     Because it is not in accord with any of the actual cycles of     nature or our own biology, following the old Gregorian Calendar     has severed humanity from its biospheric membership. Without full     membership in the biosphere, humanity will continue to encase     itself in an artificial world of exploding technology,     over-population, environmental degradation, social chaos, and war.<p>     Without taking immediate action by calling a halt to the old time     and all of the social institutions enmeshed in the calendar of the     old time, humanity would never otherwise call a halt to its     current course. The twofold purpose of the Biospheric Covenant of     the thirteen moons is to call an immediate halt to the the course     of civilization as it is now constituted, and to provide immediate     relief and guidelines for restructuring the human social order     according to the new time.<p>     The rights of humans in the biosphere are essentially no different     than the rights held by all other species of life within the     biosphere: free air, free water, free land, free time, free life,     free will autonomy. The present institutions of civilization     abrogate virtually all of these rights by an insistence on the     supremacy of various secondary fictions: nation states, taxes, the     monetary system, and the materialist way of life. Every     credibility given to any of these secondary fictions diminishes     our own capacity for self-empowerment.<p>     Once it is understood that virtually every human institution in     existence is embedded in the irregular Gregorian Calendar, by     adopting the regular Thirteen Moon Calendar, it will be easy to     divest ourselves of our outworn ways. Like it or not, humans have     grown habituated to customs which are contrary to the natural     order of things, yet because they are embedded in the Gregorian     Calendar, are considered indispensable. Taxes, government, and war     are the most pernicious of these 'bad' habits. It is always easier     to root out a bad habit when there is a clear goal and a new path     to follow.<p><hr>Return to:|   <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <a href="arguelles.html">Jose Arguelles</a>  |  <a href="messenger.html">The Portal Messenger</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index2.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>   |<p><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995-1996 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

By four o'clock in the morning of Crystal Moon 28 (June 26, 1996) several hundred people had already gathered at the entrance to the Four Corners National Monument, just off US highway 160. A few others had been inside the Monument holding an all night vigil.<p>The Monument itself is just a large square platform showing the four lines made by four different surveyors between 1868 and 1912 commemorating the state boundary lines of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona. These surveyors were carrying out mandates to conquer and divide the "non-Christian" Earth that had been set in motion by the Papal Doctrine of Discovery, 40 years before Columbus in 1452. <p><center><h2>Rainbow Nation Flags</h2></center><p><center><IMG SRC="peacflag.gif" align="middle"> | <IMG SRC="galxflag.gif" align="middle"> | <IMG SRC="bioflag.gif" align="middle"></center><p>At 5 AM, when Navajo Nation Monument Superintendent James Gorman finally opened the gates, he opened the gates on an unprecedented conscious human act to change and repeal the course of history. Instead of the four state flags, as well as those of the United States and Navajo Nations, flying on the flag poles were two Banners of Peace, the flag of the Congress of Biospheric Rights, the flag of the Galactic Shield, and the flag of the Rainbow Nation. It was a new morning. As the sun rose on the spectacular and vast desert region of the Four Corners, more than five hundred people had surrounded the Monument platform.<p>By five-thirty, four drummers held the four cardinal points of the Monument platform beneath the flags of the galactic liberation front. Native Americans and elders sat on benches immediately around the Monument. Around them an inner circle of humans was joined by four human spokes radiating outward to an outer circle. Receiving the people still arriving. this outer circle extended to the scattering of artisan booths near the monument. Within an hour the outer human circle was totally in place. The solemn heartbeat drumming continued. The Navajo police had withdrawn most of their cars from the immediate Monument area. A spectacular sixties-style tie dye peace banner was being held high on one of the artisan shack's rooftops. A handful of media people used this backdrop for their television cameras. What did their cameras see?<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p> A vision of humanity gathering and holding the sacred form of the Earth seal of the ancient spirit elders, for the purpose of initiating a return to the sacred ways of the Earth. At precisely seven o'clock, the four drummers were replaced by four conch blowers. As the conch sounds penetrated the desert dawn, the energy of the gathering was released into spirit. "We are peace, we are love, we are one", these were the only words publicly spoken that closed the Ceremony. As the form dissolved, several rainbow nation people were atop the monument singing a spontaneous song of peace. The crowd dissolved in a spirit of quiet joy. <p>Born of the prophetic vision of the ancient Maya, the Four Corners Ceremony brought together two messengers of that vision, Tony Shearer and Jos&eacute; Arg&uuml;elles. The spontaneously brief, but heartfelt reunion of these two messengers was virtually the only event that occurred during the Ceremony. It was Tony Shearer in 1970, who affirmed for Arg&uuml;elles the prophecy of the Thirteen Heavens and Nine Hells and the prophetic dates of the Harmonic Convergence, August 16-17, 1987. These prophecies, according to Shearer, had originated in the mysterious Mayan city of Palenque. Arg&uuml;elles, whose vision of Harmonic Convergence fulfilled the prophecy of the Thirteen Heavens and Nine Hells, had just completed the final decoding of the prophecy cycle of Palenque, the Telektonon of Pacal Votan. It is this prophecy that contains the message of the return to the natural time of Thirteen Moons, the return as well to the natural boundarylessness of the biosphere.<p>Officials of the Navajo Nation, which now holds most of the land at Four Corners, were impressed by the nature and order of the Ceremony, and at the fact that the Monument was cleaner after the Ceremony than before. Preparation for the Ceremony had already shaken the bureaucratic lethargy of the Navajo. Once word was received of the intention to hold a Boundary Dissolving Ceremony, strange events had already started to occur. Early in May, 96 year-old Irene Yazzie had been visited by two spirit messengers, "The Monster Slayer Twins," warning the Navajo people about the need to return to traditional ceremony which they have largely forsaken. Then an arson occurred at the Monument artisan shacks. <p>Meanwhile on Hopi land, surrounded by the much larger Navajo Nation, the elders had called a spiritual emergency kiva ceremony that went on for several weeks just prior to the Boundary Dissolving. During their ceremonial gathering, two Hopi children were mysteriously drowned. Rumors abounded. Had the mysterious Blue Star Kachina returned, a prophecy of the time of the Great Change? Divisions between themselves had brought the Hopi to a desperate place. The Hopi elders acknowledged and sent their blessings to the Boundary Dissolving Ceremony, even though they could not leave their land because of the tensions there. "We are already feeling the effects of your Ceremony," a Hopi spokesman told Arg&uuml;elles the night before the Ceremony.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>A word-of-mouth informal gathering of several hundred of the Ceremony participants occurred in the small Navajo town of Shiprock, some 30 miles away. Present at this spontaneous post-Ceremony gathering were Fantuzzi, "ceremonial king" of the Rainbow Nation, and representatives from at least seven other countries: Brazil, Mexico, New Zealand, Canada, Switzerland, Norway, and Japan. Into this festive mid-morning gathering, came the Mayor of Shiprock, who was honored to know about the nature and purpose of the Ceremony and the cause of the gathering in his community. At the height of the gathering, World Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement Coordinators, Lloydine and Jos&eacute; Arg&uuml;elles, spoke words of inspiration. "This is the Proclamation of the Victory of Universal Peace", they declared. This is the first of the 52 Days of Victory. If anyone asks you where is this peace you are talking about, tell them, "we are peace, and we are bringing peace to your planet".<p>By noon, heavy thunderclouds had moved into the entire region. Hail was falling near Four Corners. The thunder beings had answered many prayers. By afternoon thunder storms were breaking out everywhere. At Cortez, Colorado, up US Highway 666 from Four Corners, an intense storm was washing away all of history, a least back to 1519. And that's before the Gregorian Calendar. Welcome to Post-history.<p><blockquote>"Look around<br>See the Earth<br>Look at the Sky<br>Count the Stars<br>Feel the Sun<br>Taste the Rain<br>Touch your Brother<br>Know your Sister<br>Love each other.<br>Breathe the air<br>Taste the Water<br>And eat your food<br>But remember...<br>It is a gift<br>All of this. is a gift<br>Know it well..."</blockquote><p><blockquote>"You are here to learn...<br>You will be tested..."</blockquote><p><blockquote>"Learn the science of the Creation<br>Teach the science "Love of the Creator..."</blockquote><p> Song of the Tree, from Tony Shearer, Lord of the Dawn, 1971<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p> Kin 181 Red Crystal Dragon<br>Cosmic Turtle Moon Day 12<br>Third Year of Prophecy<br>Boundary Dissolving: Thirteen Colonies to Thirteen Moons<p> The Four Corners Boundary Dissolving Ceremony was the central focus of 13:13 Boundary Dissolving Ceremonies commemorated by hundreds of different synchronized gatherings everywhere on the planet. Seven years ago, in 1989, events in Eastern Europe occurred which led to the dissolution of the Iron Curtain, the taking down of the Berlin Wall, and the end of Communism. Boundary dissolving is the next wave. The boundary dissolving which was initiated with the Four Corners Ceremony is intended to dissolve national and mental boundaries that divide rather than unify. Just as 1989 saw the end of communism, so 1996 will mark the end of the era of the nation-state in its place will rise the great era of bioregional Earth sovereignty.<p> The Four Corners is a point of political illusion in what is now referred to as the United States of America. Within the United States exist numerous indigenous groups, including the Navajo and Mountain Ute, for instance, who claim the land held by the United States at Four Corners. These indigenous groups can only survive if they imitate the larger force. The Navajo Nation in its official form tends to be a carbon copy of the United States of America. The surveyors who created the illusory boundaries that run heedless of the desert's defiant desolation were players acting out a little drama within the larger movement known as "Manifest Destiny," or "westward the course of empire"!<p> The roots of this vision which ruthlessly guided the white European across the North American continent are to be found in the 1452 Doctrine of Discovery. Supported and affirmed by the Gregorian Calendar reform of 1582, the calendar which inaugurated the time of colonialism, by 1776 the force generated by the Doctrine of Discovery had congealed into the phenomenon known as the American Revolution. Embedded in the Gregorian Calendar, the principles of the American Revolution catapulted the Thirteen Colonies into the role model for the rest of the peoples of the planet. Within two centuries The United States of America had made the concept of its form of industrial democracy the sole tenable ideal for all peoples of Earth. If you are not a member of an industrial democracy, you belong to either a fascist state or primitive 'developing economy'. The goal of all present policies is to bring the rest of the planet into the nationalist fold of industrial democracy and neo-liberal free market economics.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p> Like the boundaries created on paper to create separate states, industrial democracy and neo-liberal free market economics are just catch phrases to mask a great illusion. Eight new McDonald's restaurants open everyday on planet Earth. 3000 new MasterCard access outlets open daily around the world. The new imperialism of corporate monoculture reigns supreme in airline magazines and on Wall Street. It is the bankers who run industrial democracy. I t is the bankers who manipulate the political processes masquerading as industrial democracy. The voting booth is the lure held out by the bankers to keep the people in the illusion that they too have some power. The destructive empty fiction of democracy held together by police enforced borders is at an end.<p>The Thirteen Colonies began the industrial democratic revolution. The coming of the Thirteen Moons will complete that revolution, initiating a worldwide revolution in time that will transform the world so rapidly, people will wonder why we had to wait so long for it to happen.<p> The American Revolution of the Thirteen Colonies was a revolution in space locked into the artificial mental 12:60 timing frequency. Like all revolutions in space, the American Revolution represents a devolution of power to the lowest common denominator. This is why democracy is mediocrity. The ultimate reducer of values is the 12:60 timing frequency. This mechanistically accelerating 12:60 timing frequency, now deployed through a GPS satellite system, creates the entropic non-biological space for the exponentially exploding propagation of colonies of machines and their human attendants spread in decentralized units across the terrestrial landscape. All of this mind-numbing technological evolution is foisted on a now dazed and captive humanity expects nothing else but eight new choices on a computerized gadget that will help it keep track of all of its other computer-operated accessories.<p>Thirteen Moons is the first revolution of time. Its purpose is to free space from false time, thus ending the immoral devolution of power that has abstracted humanity away from its symbiotic cradle, the biosphere. The coming of the Thirteen Moons will release humanity into post-historic, non-governmental, money free bioregionalism. How? Impeach Bill Clinton.<p> Why? By his executive power Bill Clinton has violated the Constitution of the United States; he has broken the covenant of the original Thirteen Colonies by entering into secret agreement with other heads of state for the formation of a secret world government run by an oligarchy of bankers. This secret world government is known as the G-7. As the de facto head of this ClA-spawned conspiracy to control the planet. Bill Clinton is both violating the US Constitution and fulfilling the final karmic act spawned by the Doctrine of Discovery and maintained by the Gregorian Calendar. The G-7 bankers takeover of world policy is the final illegitimate seizure made possible through the illegitimate usurpation of power assumed by Christian Europeans over the rest of the non-Christian world.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p> The Thirteen Colonies were the brilliant offspring of the Doctrine of Discovery. Its every legislative preamble is encoded and enshrined in the Gregorian Calendar. Like it or not, the Thirteen Colonies spawned the American industrial world takeover of planet Earth known as the G-7. The Thirteen Colonies realized the last revolution of space. Devoid of the knowledge of real time and based on the irregular and mechanical knowledge of artificial 12:60 time, the American "time is money" vision of the G-7 is really the last testament of the Tower of Babel.<p> According to Telektonon, the prophecy of Pacal Votan, the G-7 is the position at the very top of the Tower of Babel at the end of the cycle of false time. The boundary dissolving initiated at Four Corners is the beginning of the dissolution of the foundations of the Tower of Babel. By arousing a popular referendum to impeach Bill Clinton on the basis of his secret agreement with other heads of state in violation of his own Constitution, the nemesis of history will finally be laid to rest. Bill Clinton is not alone. Co-conspirators with Clinton in the G-7 plot are every President since 1974, when Nixon appointed George Bush head of the CIA, which then hatched the G-7 conspiracy for planet economic and political takeover.<p>Impeach Clinton, impeach the whole system. End the revolution of space devoid of time with the revolution of time which governs space. Don't worry about what this will do to the elections. Forgot the elections. The exposure and fall of Clinton will be the exposure and fall of the G-7. By the time Clinton is impeached (it will be a relief to him to be able to stop living the lie). Al Gore will have the Galactic Culture Master Plan of the Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement in his hands. He will know what to do. Thirteen Colonies to Thirteen Moons. The first World Peace is a planetary emergency program. No more nation states impeding the process of truth. Only humans bioregionally organized by the laws of time to accomplish natures work to restore the biosphere.<p> <b>Third Force Home Market Economics: Wall Street Heart Attack, Victory for the Biosphere</b><p>New time. New Covenant. Thirteen Moons humanly organized as the World Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement or its operational form of PAN (Planet Art Network) is the materially transcendent third force predicated by the materialist dialectic of history. The Thirteen Moon third force is the transcendent stream that succeeds the final capitalist-communist materialist dialectic of history. Communism died as a dialectical force in 1989. The G-7 became an overt operation in 1990. Boundary dissolving now renders capitalism dead as a dialectical historic force. In 1997 the PAN will replace the G-7 and assume leadership for humanity as a responsible organism within its biosphere host system. Its emergency peace program, the Galactic Culture Master Program of the First World Peace is already preparing pathways into the New Time.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>The time revolution is a mind shift. War and money are replaced by peace and art; devolution of power is transformed into evolution of spirit, human machine alienation into human Earth domestication. Driving to work in a machine in exchange for money to help pay for the machine will be replaced by home-life: home birth, home school, home learning, home garden, home death. Telepathy will replace the Internet. And it is all realizable within a four-year span known as the First World Peace, the mobilization of humanity on behalf of the telepathic transformation of the biosphere. <p>The driving force of third-dimensional false time is the belief that time is money. The illusion of money is so great that a preponderant number of humans believe no work can be accomplished without it. How can this belief be returned to the empty source of its illusory status?<p> As the third force transcending history, the genuinely post-historic motion of humanity into Its ever-evolving future, the covenant of the Thirteen Moons has its own economic policy: Home Market Economics. Home Market Economics is the third force money-free economic policy intended to replace the now prevailing one-sided globalization of neo-liberal free market capitalist monetary politics.<p>As the expression of the will of the Thirteen Moon Covenant, the First World Peace is based on a creative resolution to the end of money, and a speedy and peaceful entry into the era of time is art. Through the coming Blue Self-Existing Storm Year, PAN diplomatic and strategic communications will prepare the program, compile data-banks and initiate the dialogue necessary to commence the final close-out of money. <p>By Overtone Seed, July 26, 1997, the present economic apparatus could be subsumed into a comprehensive data base and disbursement system known as the Earth Conversion Trust and Planetary Store. Allocated equally on a zero budget basis over the next Thirteen Moons, the last of the money will finally be disbursed and allocated. Every human would now have what every other human would have: an equal material comfort base with which to explore the newly recovered telepathic faculties due to living in the growing results of the new time. The Tower of Babel will finally be gone. History will end not with a hang but with a shout of joy because we are finally post-historic!<p>In place of the free spending era of G-7 globalization of consumer goods, will be Home Market Economics. The result of the release of money as an emblem of power in anyway is the Home Market phenomenon. Home Market means that all goods and services are equal in exchange; that barter and equal exchange of different types of goods are the basis of an economic system where the lowest common economic denominator is the home. Economy will naturally revert to the Earth, the support system for our home. Learning, Earth service and art will replace jobs and status; Gardening and telepathic cultivation will replace leisure and mentally distracting activities. An ethical norm expected only of saints will be the common expectation. And it is all home-centered for the restoration of the human family.<p><b>Third Force Home Market Economics: Wall Street heart attack, victory for the biosphere!</b><p><b>PAN HCV</b><p>Pan Art Network Higher Collective Voice White Cosmic Wind, Cosmic Moon 13, White Electric Wizard Year <p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p><hr><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995-1996 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

Other scientists affirm that it may be the most spectacular discovery since humans started gazing skyward at other worlds. While Carl Sagan remained skeptical and Daniel Goldin, NASA administrator declared " I want everyone to understand that we are not talking about 'little green men,'" the news that scientists had determined that a "primitive form of life" had existed on Mars was the front page news of USA Today and virtually every other newspaper in the United States, August 7, 1996.<p> Why all the excitement? The "discovery" was made from some Martian rocks found in Antarctica in 1984. The rocks were from a meteorite, since called Alan Hills 84001, bearing material from Mars anywhere from several million years to 4.5 billion years old. The meteor itself hit Earth only 13,000 years ago. The announcement was so staggering to the prevailing 12:60 scientific paradigm that special briefings were being prepared for President Clinton and Vice President Gore. The findings will be officially released August 16, 1996. That is the ninth anniversary of the Harmonic Convergence. That is as good a date as any to dissolve one paradigm and affirm another.<p>Ever since it began, hard core 12:60 materialist science has held as one of its tenets that life is a random accident that happened to occur on this planet, and that the possibility of life elsewhere was virtually unthinkable. But if the definition of life is something that can be recognized and verified as a unitary phenomenon, i.e. DNA, then the real thriller to consider is not life out there, but our life on previous worlds.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index2.html">Home</A>   |<p>The announcement of August 7, 1996 (that's Friday the 13th day of the Magnetic Moon of the new Thirteen Moon Calendar) is just the tiniest tip of the Antarctic iceberg of NASA's information bank, and the human race's fascination with life on Mars. Is NASA merely building up to something more major by letting this little cat out of the bag? Remember the Arnold Schwarzenegger film, "Total Recall?" Hauntingly familiar memories of the last destructive days of the "Red Planet" are the terrifying theme of that film. Why would that movie strike such a chord if there were not some truth to it?<p><IMG align="right" SRC="marsface.gif">On July 25,1976, that's Green Day, the Day-Out-of-Time on the Thirteen Moon Calendar, the NASA Viking Probe sent back photos of a phenomenon since known as the "Face of Mars." Of course, NASA won't admit that the "Face" is anything more than random shadows on rocks. If DNA is unitary, and a form of DNA has been verified on other rocks from Mars, then the Face of Mars is the keystone to the total recall of our life not only on this world, but on other worlds as well. It is the implications of this assumption by which the entire 12:60 paradigm can be irrevocably unraveled, and that is why "Life on Mars" is front page news.<p> <b>RED PLANET BLUE PLANET: RED ALERT</b><br><b>A RADIOZOIC EVOLUTIONARY DIRECTIVE</b><p>The crux of the scientific discovery at this point in NASA's waiting game, is not a face looking outward for some recognition from the surface of Mars, but meteoric rock that hit this planet 13,000 years ago, only to be discovered in 1984 in Antarctica. 13,000 years ago was the end of the last ice age and the beginning of the warming 'trough" that allowed homo sapiens to start its course toward agriculture, and civilization as we now know it. According to the cosmology of the Dreamspell, that was the end of the 13,000-year Dragon Genesis and the beginning of the 7,800 year "lost" Monkey Genesis.<p>On April 21, 1984, the same year that the meteoric material from Mars was discovered in Antarctica, Jos&eacute; Arg&uuml;elles, initiator of the Harmonic Convergence completed a "time map" entitled "Red Planet, Blue Planet: Red Alert." Though he did not then know of the 1984 discovery, Arg&uuml;elles did know of the July 25, 1976, photo recall of the Face of Mars. It was the Face of Mars that triggered Arg&uuml;elles' "time map" showing the cosmic connection between the Red Planet Mars and the Blue Planet Earth. The script for this "time map" begins with the following text: <p><blockquote>"At point of vital reversal, nuclear war devastates Red Planet, disturbing geomagnetic field, thus attracting coincidentally approaching comet/meteor shower to disastrously side-swipe planet, thus assuring end of all life on the Red Planet. Time: .5 to 3.3 million years ago."</blockquote> Arg&uuml;elles' 1984 script describes the comet that side-swiped Mars continuing its erratic course, finally to be "deposited on Blue Planet as meteor shower impacting on Pacific Ocean." And we might now add, Antarctica.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index2.html">Home</A>   |<p>In the "Red Planet, Blue Planet" script, the Red Alert is a deja vu, an evolutionary directive... <blockquote>"revealing binary planet memory hook-up thus illustrating Law of Radiozoic Progression: Tendency of life forms to proceed toward radial program structure following maximum schizophrenic complexification of bilateral specialization. This turning point, known as the vital reversal, triggered through nuclear experimentation which introduces steady background radiation as new component of planet atmosphere."</blockquote><IMG align="left" SRC="marsface.gif">In other words, since DNA is a unitary 64-unit cosmic code, what had occurred to and through the DNA process on one planet would continue on an adjacent planet, also seeded by the same DNA code. As the DNA evolving within the planetary whole arrives at a stage of self-reflective intelligence, it also evolves a psi field or self-reflective memory bank. It is the self-reflective activation of the psi field following the point of vital reversal that advances life to its radial program. This possibility was short-circuited in the self-destruction of Martian life. However, the "Red Planet, Blue Planet" script continues:<p> <blockquote>"As psi field of Red Planet disintegrates, highly concentrated thought forms, perhaps encoded as laser beams are transmitted to the next closest planet body, the Blue Planet, where they impregnate Blue Planet's still embryonic psi bank as galactic memory nodes and crystal body directives."<p>"Galactic memory nodes" of the Red Planet imprinted into the psi bank of the Blue Planet were activated when the Italian astronomer, Schiaparelli, looked at Mars through his telescope and, besides finding the famous "canals" of Mars, distinguished the Red Planet's more prominent features with archetypal names: Atlantis, Lemuria, Utopia, Elysium, Cydonia and Mt. Olympus. As for the "crystal body directives," the crystal body refers to the fifth-dimensional pure mind form of any constituent of phenomenal reality. Pyramids, mandalas, time tunnels of spiritual emergence, the structure of bilateral intelligence--all of these would qualify as communicative forms of the "crystal body directives."</blockquote><p> In Arg&uuml;elles' "time map," the Blue Planet crossed the Martian "line of vital reversal" in 1945. For this reason in the radiozoic dating, Hiroshima = 0 point, and Arg&uuml;elles' "time map" bears the actual date "4.21 38 AH, 'The Harrowing of Hell.'" While 38 AH refers to 38 years After Hiroshima, the "Harrowing of Hell" refers to the prophecy of the Thirteen Heavens and Nine Hells, of which the ninth and last 52-year Hell Cycle began in 1935, and was due to end with the Harmonic Convergence of 1987. According to the "time map," Hiroshima initiated a point of "resonant recapitulation," which is climaxed with the "point of no return," 1986-87. <p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index2.html">Home</A>   |<p>As evidence of resonant recapitulation, the "time map" offers an obvious example of "binary memory hook-up :" "The Face of Mars" and Isamu Noguchi's "Sculpture to be Seen from Mars." Noguchi's proposed sculpture, which had it been completed, would have been of the same dimensions as the Face of Mars, was conceived in the year 1947, (2 AH). 29 years prior to the Viking probe, Noguchi's sculptural reminiscence of the Face of Mars early in the 42-year zone of the "radiozoic grace period," is sufficient evidence of resonant recapitulation. Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Total Recall" is another.<p>It is following the point of no return in 1987, that the radiozoic era triggers the Red Alert through a type of "jump start." This "jump start" into the radiozoic era was the Harmonic Convergence, August 16-17, 1987. On the 260-kin Galactic Spin , the radiozoic zero-point date of Hiroshima, August 6, 1945 is Blue Electric Eagle. The fact that August 16, 1987 is also Blue Electric Eagle is the reason for the "jump start" into the radiozoic era at this precise point in time. <p><IMG align="right" SRC="marsface.gif">The Harmonic Convergence was the "jump start" to overcome total amnesia and avoid the Mars effect occurring again on the Blue Planet. The mythic remnant of the 144,000 did heed the call. But following the Harrowing of the Nine Hells between 1519 and 1987, came the summons to Judgment Day.<p><b>JUDGMENT DAY, MARS CALLING, WILL SOMEONE PLEASE ANSWER!</b><p> <blockquote>"Certainly, the creation of the Heavens and the Earth is greater than the creation of mankind: but most men know not." </blockquote>Holy Qur'an, Sura 40:57<p>The date of Arg&uuml;elles' "Red Planet, Blue Planet: Red Alert," 4.21, 38 AH, on the Galactic Spin, was Blue Cosmic Night. July 25, 1993, the Day-Out-of Time of the Blue Cosmic Storm year, the beginning of the "time shift," was also Blue Cosmic Night. Seventeen years to the day of the Viking probe photo of the Face of Mars, Arg&uuml;elles was tagged again. A type of resonant recapitulation text, "De Tulan el Lejano," ("From Distant Tollan") was placed in his hands. By opening this text the next morning, Kin 144, Yellow Magnetic Seed, head technician Arg&uuml;elles was placed directly on line to decode, and have revealed to him, a prophecy called "Telektonon, Earth Spirit Speaking Tube."<p> Five weeks later, on August 25, 1993, after intensive decoding and "time mapping," Arg&uuml;elles asked his wife, Lloydine, to take him out for a ride. It was the first time in five weeks that he had left his remote Hawaiian work station. Looking up from the Oracle for the First Year of Prophecy Arg&uuml;elles remarked to his wife, "this Martian thing is up this year." Sure enough, stepping out of the car at a small shopping mall was the front page head-line, "Mars Observer Lost Forever."<p> According to the report, on August 24, 1993, after its lengthy journey from the Blue Planet to the Red Planet, the NASA Mars Observer experienced an "unexplained" technical failure at the precise moment it was to begin taking photos of undisclosed surface features of Mars. The odds are that the Mars Observer was sent to verify, among other things, the Face and Pyramids of Mars. "Lost forever," was NASA's lame response. So obvious was NASA's "bungled" effort a potential cover-up, that the incident became an immediate storm of controversy.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index2.html">Home</A>   |<p> On the Dreamspell Calendar, August 24, 1993, was the day Red Self-Existing Skywalker. That is President Bill Clinton's galactic signature. Skywalker represents the solar-prophetic power of the planet Mars, the power of prophecy. Where was Bill Clinton that day? On Jackie Kennedy Onassis' yacht. The galactic signature of Jackie Onassis is White Self-Existing World-Bridger, the perfect analog partner of Red Self-Existing Skywalker. The World-Bridger represents the galactic-karmic power of the planet Mars, the power of death. Within a year of that meeting, Jackie died of cancer. And some two years later all of the Kennedy memorabilia were being sold in an auction that was touted as the "Selling of Camelot." Was Camelot sold because Mars was covered up? And Bill Clinton, what is to become of him?<p>According to the prophecy Telektonon, it is Judgment Day on planet Earth. It is not a Christian apocalypse, but a Mayan apocalypse, a Harmonic Convergence of all prophecy. In the Mayan apocalypse, Judgment Day is the test of total recall. Humanity causes Judgment Day because it has chosen a path of separation from the rest of the biosphere. By living its own time, the artificial time of the 12:60, humanity has intensified its amnesia and accelerated its growth at machine rates, while systematically depleting and destroying its biospheric support web, all for a paltry profit.<p>The revelation of humanity's self-judgment and salvation is knowledge of its error as well as the means of its correction. Knowledge of the error constitutes the revelation of the 12:60 artificial timing frequency. Originated in Babylon and institutionalized through the Gregorian calendar and mechanical clock, the 12:60 is the accepted basis of all of human endeavor in what is called the modern world. Time is money, but at what price?<p><IMG align="left" SRC="marsface.gif">The sum result of the 12:60 is the unconscious Martian replay: the creation of a "maximum schizophrenic complexification of bilateral specialization." The unstable mental condition of specialized labor places humanity at odds with itself and nature through a paralyzingly regimented society whose horizons are limited to the wage-slave concept of jobs. Reinforced by machine values, the condition of schizophrenic complexification induces the turning point or vital reversal of nuclear experimentation. Historically this was coincident with World War II, AD 1939-1945.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index2.html">Home</A>   |<p>So morally self-alienated had humanity become that instead of learning from the immediate horror of its actions, tens of thousands of more bombs more powerful than those dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were, and still are being manufactured. Five governments officially hold the nuclear sword, while unofficial terrorism maintains the other side of the balance by keeping humanity hostage to its own fear. This is the real politics of humanity on Judgment Day.<p>Riding the dark edge of a wave of Martian amnesia, the only salvation possible for humanity is to wake up and return to the true laws of time which govern the rest of the biosphere. The Telektonon prophecy of Pacal Votan makes clear that only by rejecting the false twelve-month Gregorian calendar and adopting the biologically accurate Thirteen Moon calendar will humanity be able to attain Martian recall, and just in time. This is a radical step. To reject the current calendar is to reject the entire institutionalized price-tag reality of civilization as it is today. Every human law ruling the world today is embedded in the Gregorian Calendar. The very concepts of legislative law, government, taxation, wages, and war are inseparable from the false calendar since its genesis in Babylon. The elimination of the Gregorian calendar is the Mayan apocalypse of history.<p><blockquote>"But especially would I have you look at Mars and consider again the disposition of the thirteen sacred signs placed around the edge of my stone..."</blockquote> Telektonon of Pacal Votan, verse 113<p>August 7, 1996, the day when life on Mars was headline news, was the day Blue Electric Monkey, a Galactic Activation Portal and one of the "thirteen sacred signs" on the tomb-lid of Pacal Votan. Within the Telektonon Warrior's Journey, this day was cube position seven, Baktun Thirteen, 1618-2012, "Babylon Planet." Chafing under the yoke of the secret imperial councils of the G-7, a last-minute reprieve and the potential of total recall are now offered to President Clinton, the Martian Skywalker, the last to inherit the false legacy of Babylonian time. <p><blockquote>"And We created not the Heavens and the Earth, and all that is between them, in sport,"<p>"We created them not but with the requirements of truth and justice, but most of them understand not." <p>"Verily the Day of Decision is the appointed time for all of them" </blockquote>Holy Qur'an, Sura 44:38-40<p><IMG align="right" SRC="marsface.gif">So morally self-alienated had humanity become that instead of learning from the immediate horror of its actions, tens of thousands of more bombs more powerful than those dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were, and still are being manufactured.

That is August 19, the day Blue Lunar Night. In the Telektonon, Night, the Galactic Karmic power of Saturn, represents the G-7, the final form of Babylonian apocalyptic power. The G-7, "group of seven most industrialized nations," is the Beast of Seven Heads in chapter thirteen of the "Book of Revelations." The lunar tone represents both the power to polarize and the lunar power of the thirteen moons. As long as Saturn is controlled by the G-7 it is the planet that holds Mars in check and is responsible for its destruction. Saturn G-7's next object of destruction is the Blue Planet.<p> Given all that he knows, from Jackie Onassis' secret tips to the carefully managed Martian evidence, Bill Clinton's 50th year, Blue Lunar Night is his Day of Decision. The stakes are as high as they have been since the destruction of Mars. Once President Clinton has this final Martian evidence in his hands then it will be his to decide: to save his soul and split the G-7, or... "to Allah is the final return of all."<p> Yes, the release of the Martian evidence is carefully timed, not by the secret councils of generals, bankers and munitions manufacturers, but by Allah, the supreme Knower of all that is hidden and all that is revealed. Why is the Martian evidence so terrifying to those in power? Because evidence of our life on other worlds raises too many questions? What happened to our life on that world? Are we doing something wrong? Have we persisted in doing wrong despite all the signs? How will we be punished?<p> The Hale-Bopp Comet is scheduled to fly by the Blue Planet by the end of this or early next Gregorian year-all in the middle of the Fourth Year of Prophecy, Blue Self- Existing Storm. Sound familiar? Was this the comet or meteor that originally brought Martian material to the Blue Planet? What might it sweep up in its tail this time to leave deposited on some other world, as yet another reminder that Judgment Day cannot be postponed forever? Yes, it is Judgment Day, and Mars is calling: won't somebody please answer the call?<p><b>HARMONIC CONVERGENCE: NINTH ANNIVERSARY PROCLAMATION</b> July 25, AD 1996, White Electric Mirror. It is the Day-Out-of-Time again, 20 years to the day when the Mars Viking probe took the fateful photo of the Face of Mars. All over Mexico City, the Blue Planet's largest metropolis, cryptic signs and billboards announce "July 25, Independence Day," beneath which the image of a vast UFO mother ship ominously protrudes from outer space.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index2.html">Home</A>   |<p>Elsewhere that day, beneath the smoggy skies and brooding volcanoes of the great city, a group of 300 people, in honor of the Day-Out-of-Time, gather for a concert of planetary music that completes a Congress entitled "The Harmonic Convergence of Humanity." Including the Islamic call to prayer, and a range of musical expressions from Persian flute and vocals, to Spanish flamenco, Japanese koto and shakuhachi, and Brazilian Capoeira, as well as piano and symphonic performances, the concert is the creation of Tynetta Muhammad, widow of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad and "Mother of the Faithful" of the Nation of Islam. The brilliance of the performances woven together as a whole demonstrate the principle of peace through culture. <p><IMG align="left" SRC="marsface.gif">The next day, the Harmonic Convergence of Humanity becomes an historically unprecedented ceremony that walks the length of the nearby ancient metropolis of Teotihuacan, Place where the Gods Touch the Earth. At its conclusion in the spectacular Citadel of Quetzalcoatl, amid banners of peace, and rainbow and Earth flags, Messengers of the New Time, Lloydine and Jos&eacute; Arg&uuml;elles proclaim the First World Peace. "There is a new community on planet Earth, the Community of Biospheric Rights" Jos&eacute; Arg&uuml;elles affirms. "This is the community that is peace and that will carry out the four years of the First World Peace, 1996 to 2000."<p> The Harmonic Convergence of Humanity is the first follow-up gathering of the New Human Community, which established itself at the First Planetary Congress of Biospheric Rights, earlier this same Gregorian year, during the Solar Moon of the Third Year of Prophecy in Brasilia, Brazil (March 17-21, 1996). The purpose of the Congress is simple and logical. To create the New Covenant and Resolutions in accord with the Thirteen Moon Calendar to replace the old covenant and all of the institutions embedded in the Gregorian Calendar. Interestingly enough, on March 7, ten days prior to the Congress, there is intense "UFO activity" over the hacienda of Jose Fraga, also in Brasilia. The UFO activity leaves a crop-circle style imprint on Fraga's lawn, and a telepathic message to pay attention to the upcoming Congress of Biospheric Rights.<p>The crop circle on Fraga's lawn looks exactly like a circle drawn around a map of the "Four Corners," United States, where the artificial state lines of Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico form the cross within the circle. The Four Corners is precisely where Messengers Jos&eacute; and Lloydine Arg&uuml;elles gather with a group of 600 others in the predawn of Crystal Moon 28, 13:13, June 26, 1996, for the Four Corners Boundary Dissolving Ceremony. The same flags and banners of peace that flew in Brasilia, and that were to later fly at Teotihuacan, replace the state and national flags usually flown over Four Corners. The Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement is on the march. In Arg&uuml;elles' words, this Movement is the "new human community of the next millennium."<p> Yes, the World Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement and the New Covenant and Resolutions of the First Planetary Congress of Biospheric Rights are the direct fulfillment of the Harmonic Convergence of August 16-17, 1987. Now, nine years later, there is no other Movement or Peace Plan as comprehensive and harmonically convergent as that offered by the Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement. This Movement is the only way back to total recall from the total amnesia of the "Tower of Babble."<p> August 16, 1996, Yellow Crystal Sun, the 22nd day of the Magnetic Moon, the completion of the first Warrior Cube Journey of the Fourth Year of Prophecy, "Victory Establishes," will witness the official announcement of the "scientific discovery of life on Mars" and the following Ninth Anniversary Proclamation of Harmonic Convergence, "Point of No Return: the Scientific Recovery of Life on Earth."<p><b>Point of No Return: The Scientific Recovery of Life on Earth</b><br> <b>Harmonic Convergence Ninth Anniversary Proclamation</b><p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index2.html">Home</A>   |<p> Nine Years, Nine Lords of Time, one year for each Lord of Time to prepare the great announcement and proclamation. "Yes: there is a scientific recovery of life on Earth. The scientific recovery of life on Earth is due to the scientific discovery of the false, artificial 12:60 timing frequency, and the resurrection of the true, naturally galactic 13:20 timing frequency. This scientific recovery is aroused by the World Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement and takes the form of a Planet Art Network, the web of telepathy to replace the tomb of life called terrestrial civilization!"<p>Nine years ago, the Harmonic Convergence was called. 144,000 crossed the point of no return. This is the point where the curse of false time runs out of credit. No return to false time means: no return to government; no return to taxes; no return to money; no return to war; no return to drugs; no return to virtual reality; and no return to the false paradises of Hollywood Babylon. Nine years, nine lords of destiny who rule the power of time in the collective cosmic unconscious. Seven years to stir the brew of time. Two more years to prepare the return of true time to the collective cosmic consciousness.<p>Nine years at last to proclaim the triumph of true time, the power of thirteen! Nine years, Nine Lords of Destiny to return Earth to the Thirteen Moon 28-Day Calendar, humanity's natural biospheric timing regulator. Nine years to prepare the medicine to heal Earth of the dis-ease of human civilization. The medicine is ready for all: thirteen moons the path to walk; thirteen moons the path to talk; thirteen moons the path of the return of universal telepathy. No more twelve-month Martian amnesia, but thirteen moons for total recall on the telepathic human hot-line of awakened collective cosmic consciousness.<p> Four years more to establish the First World Peace: creative peace, real peace, genuine lasting universal peace, Harmonic Convergence as a way of life, total recall at last! The new human community of the next millennium restored to the garden! Life no longer lived as the degraded debt owed to the "company store." At last, everyone living their life as everyday art! Time is art.! Life as we live it is the ritual we are looking for. The biosphere is the divine plan. Reunion with the biosphere is the second creation.<p><IMG align="right" SRC="marsface.gif"><b>The Nine Lords of Destiny are announcing among the angelic orders:</b><p> "Yes, there is life on Earth, after all. Earth is no longer a machine breeding humans driven daily through the labyrinthian halls of self-created hell. Released from the curse of not remembering its life on the Red Planet, the Blue Planet humans are redeemed. Satan is cast out! Recovery of life, recovery of truth, recovery of love. One family, one blood, one mind, one breath, one ocean, one Earth, one cosmic universal life. Biospheric freedom, galactic liberation, a planetary network of art secreted by a single organism, unified in its collective cosmic consciousness, harmonically converging with itself in truth, justice, and love, for seven generations to come!<p>"Congratulations to the members of the human race who can heed this proclamation! The new time is here. Telektonon has been pronounced and delivered. Your covenant and rights have been prepared. Assume your galactic identity now! The time of galactic culture, Heaven on Earth has arrived. The 52 Days of Victory are complete. Establish now the order of time is art. The Planet Art Network is the phoenix arising from the ashes of the wrong time. The blaze of victory is a light that arcs the planet from pole to pole. Yes! Yes! Yes!

In December a film crew from the TV show Sightings came to San Francisco for an interview, and I was also in L.A. taping a pilot for Psychic Chronicles (UPN network) with several others who consider themselves extraterrestrials on Earth. Many more media contacts are still brewing, and today I even learned of a rock group named Supernova signed by Atlantic records, who also consider themselves ETs! My appearances on the TV shows will air in May. As you can see, some doors are now opening...<p>      I remember a comment made by one of the more sympathetic radio hosts (not all of them were so kind, I might add). She wondered if six years from now the idea of ET souls on Earth might not be as common as UFO contacts and sightings are today. She asked me if in the near future this might become an accepted fact, that beings from elsewhere take birth in human form and have been doing so for quite a long time. Before the end of the millennium, will society come to realize the spiritual intentions of our galactic family, the reality of their continuous presence among us? While I can not make predictions, I do think we are fast approaching a new era.<p>              Of course, what is scorned today is often well accepted tomorrow, and humanity does have a tendency to shoot first and ask questions later.  I have often been asked: what kind of drugs I am on. Nevertheless, I really think within a few years the scornful skeptics will find themselves in a minority, having to play catch-up and come to terms with official announcements forcing them to deal with cosmic community. Regarding public acceptance of Walk-ins and Wanderers, much of it really depends on how fully these ET souls shake off their centuries of denial.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>      In putting together a group of participants for my Psychic Chronicles TV pilot, a colleague in L.A. told me something quite interesting. He said he had asked several high-profile folks - people in the military, mental health and education professions: if they would like to air their views, but they all refused for fear of damage to their reputations. My friend and I fully understood their reluctance: people would say they are crazy! Without a doubt, they did risk losing their jobs. Although we can joke about the need for ET civil rights, this is actually a serious matter.<p>      Wider acceptance of the reality of ET Walk-ins and Wanderers depends entirely on how many people resonate with this material, and how comfortable we are sharing identity. I do not know if this issue will capture public opinion, but I do know we are in a special time of shattering old beliefs, and 1996 brings us ever closer to revelation and global transformation.<p><hr><a name=laugh><H3>Why are they Laughing?</H3></a><p>After about the 20th radio interview in which I was attacked, ridiculed, and considered something of a freak, a puzzling question arose in my mind. I was truly confounded:<P><center><b>Why are they laughing?</b></center><p>       I certainly never expected a red carpet treatment, and was fully prepared for skeptics questioning the basis of my conclusions. But I really did not expect to be taken as the butt of adolescent humor ("Do they have prozac on your planet"), direct attack ("Do you also consider yourself a moron"), or beer-belly indifference (Come on Jack, let's get back to the music!"). For many interviewers, my own sense of origins was the central fascination, and they couldn&iacute;t stop calling me an &igrave;alien&icirc;. Perhaps but 1 in 10 ever questioned me at length about the experience of "being ET in America". In the face of such ignorance and mishandling, I have far deeper appreciation for the root of Wanderers alienation.<p>       With all of this experience, the question still remained: Why are they laughing? Of course I am familiar with psychological interpretations which consider mockery and scorn as fear-driven defenses against concepts which people deem threatening. But somehow this did not go deep enough, and my questioning had not come to rest. It struck me that humanity has always rejected and even tried to obliterate those presenting ideas contrary to prevailing dogmas. Did not they burn the early astronomers who said Earth orbits the Sun? Einstein once said something to the effect that "great minds have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds". Is it a given that mediocre minds control the media?<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>      Most people would be content with such psychological and sociological answers, since they make sense and do explain a lot. But somehow I had to carry my question further, having an inkling there was something a bit more going on here. I also knew that this was a kind of practice: using a question to penetrate ever deeper levels of meaning. Subtle significance often shrouds itself in what seems to be merely obvious. It&iacute;s important for all of us to understand human nature.<p>      So what can we make of a planetary race that crucifies a man who, to all intents and purposes, gave his entire life counseling love, brotherhood, and justice? What do we make of a civilization that arms itself to the teeth and then laments global warfare and strife? What do we make of a society eager to spend billions of dollars on fantasy sci-fi entertainment and then heaves blame on those who say they have made contact with cosmic life? Without a doubt we could say those people are quite confused; and humanity not yet learned the meaning of true self-reflection.<p>              Is it any surprise benevolent ETs do not make public landings to announce themselves and offer unqualified support? Is it any surprise the New Age community is riddled with ego-driven, unqualified leaders and gullible disempowered followers? Is it any surprise so few people truly understand the function of discernment? Without a clear vision of what&iacute;s real, we cannot develop genuine values and the direction of our lives. When people then become addicted to fantasy and escape, the task of uncovering &euml;the real&iacute; draws even farther away.<p>      So why are they laughing? Perhaps the whole idea of non-human life terrifies most people, since what most people know is only what they&iacute;ve been taught in school and church, by science and the media. If these were my only teachers, I&iacute;d be laughing at Walk-ins and Wanderers too. It seems a sorry state indeed to have those without cosmic vision as sole authorities for truth. But sorry or not, most people sincerely look to institutions for leadership. While they do offer some things of value, their vision of the universal life is blurry to the point of blind. In matters of spirit and eternity, we have to look elsewhere for guidance.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>      In my attempt to share transcendental concepts I also encountered the corrosive influence of certain Judeo-Christian dogmas, which control many people subconsciously. Firstly, the Divine is placed far outside the little shell of sinful man, and He can only be met by being a good member of the congregation. This is like saying that eternal salvation comes only by following the rules laid down by your local social club, the select group holding keys to heaven and hell. Contact with Higher Self is seriously impaired by such ideas.<p>       And what if you doubt the sanctity of such dogmas? Well, the usual prescription is that you need more Bible study. The antidote for doubt is deemed more indoctrination. How often is given the counsel: turn within and find the truth? There is no glimmering here that Self is your greatest teacher; no sense that liberation is inner work needing no mediator. Indeed, there is no idea of Higher Self at all &oacute; and therein lies the great neglect of Judeo-Christian theology.<p>       Some would say that fundamentalists are few, and that most people are atheists or non-dogmatic. This may be so, but all of us are conditioned at subconsciously by traditional religious ideas. Even those who claim to follow ;objective authorities; (i.e. modern science), usually believe that death is ;the big drop-off; with physical reality the whole ball of wax. With such a worldview, I too would laugh at those silly people who say they are ETs! Indeed, our leaders have not confirmed it.<p>      The need for proof is fine, but why are they laughing, instead of sincerely asking questions? I think the final answer is that most people are not really seeking truth and couldn&iacute;t care less about a wider vision of the universe. Which is precisely the difference that separates ordinary folk from those who say they are extraterrestrials. Just I am basically a seeker, so too are those we have met who care about self-development. Yet most people are content to live their lives in the status quo, finding pleasure where they can, and do not feel the spark of aspiration that directs them to learn and find meaning. This aspiration is a yearning for spiritual growth, and it winnows out those who know that Life is the Path from those simply ;doing the rounds; without clear direction. People who do not realize that human experience has cosmic purpose are those most likely to laugh at such unconventional ideas. Forgive them Father..<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>      Today, I have become accustomed to radio hosts who mock, argue, and laugh. I always knew that trying to debate was useless; now I know many people consider these ideas on par with the comedy club. So be it. We all awaken to lifes mysteries: some quickly, most slowly. It has always been that only those with eyes to see know where they are going. Although modern media confuses fact-finding with entertainment, I do think this is changing. It is getting more difficult for people to scoff at the paranormal, and curiosity is ever growing. Yet despite social scorn, the real point is you: if you truly seek to know, then your clarity of enlightenment depends on your efforts.<p><hr><p><b>Definitions</b><p>      In my writings I use special terms to describe two groups of ET Souls: Walk-ins and Wanderers (also called Star People).  What distinguishes them is not their beliefs, but rather how they took birth on Earth.  Here are two brief descriptions:<p>    <b>Walk-in</b><br>  This term describes a process of inter-dimensional, inter-planetary soul exchange, as well as the individuals who experience it.  Here, a soul from a more developed ET or Angelic civilization (or an evolved Earth soul) enters the voluntarily surrendered body and personality of a human being, to better serve humanity and Earth.  Note that some Walk-ins don&iacute;t consider themselves ET souls.<b> Wanderer</b><br>  This poetic term describes inter-dimensional, inter-planetary soul transfer in which a being from an older ET civilization incarnates at birth, voluntarily surrendering his memory of identity/purpose, to better serve humanity and Earth.  I believe this process has occurred over millennia, with over 100 million Wanderers now on Earth, mostly all asleep.<p>                    Please send inquiries, correspondence, letters and subscription orders to the following: The ET Journal<br> c/o Scott Mandelker, Ph.D.<br> 2130 Fillmore Street, #201<br> San Francisco, CA  94115  USA<br>(415) 567-2190<p>  <hr>Return to:|   <a href="#top">Return to Top</a>  |  <a href="messenger.html">The Portal Messenger</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>   |<P><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

From Homo Habilis to Cosmic Man:</b></a><p><font size=5>O</font>ver the last several decades the philosophy of Cosmic Humanism has sought to find the solutions to a number of problems, all interrelated-even if not obviously so at first sight. Here are the central questions:<ol><li>Why must man now develop a planetary society in which to survive and evolve?<li>Why must this planetary society-the coming world civilization-create and disseminate the philosophy of Cosmic Humanism?<li>Why must the world federation of nations have a universal involvement in cosmecology?<li>Why must humankind soon participate in the awesome and reverential task of generating man's new image of man?<li>Why must the World Brain (H.G. Wells and others), the Noosphere (Teilhard de Chardin), or the World Sensorium of a cosmic humanism, provide the seminal concept and field of embryogenesis that will shape the world of the future?</ol><p>Return to:   |<a href="#top">Top</a>    |<p>How is it possible to twist Julius Stulman's Fields Within Fields...Within Fields into the global spiral of a time-binding synthesis?<p>Before our work is complete, we should have made considerable headway toward the solution of the above and related problems. In achieving this, we should also have furthered the drive towards man's self-evolution to a new level of existence-the "New Humanity." We have always pointed out that the development of this coming philosophical sysnthesis is not a one-man enterprise. In a general way, and for many years, a number of pioneers in human thought in various parts of the world have urged the necessity for a globally oriented philosophy. These "avatars of synthesis" agree that are schizoid society needs desperately to cretae or discover its inner selfhood-to formulate the patterns for a constructive integration of Eastern and Western religions, philosophies and science, a synthesis that trancends regional, racial, religious provincialisms and political ideologies.<p>This is the motivation of Cosmic Humanism. The practical and dramatic focus of our immediate positions, as here conceived, is to present the opportunity to thoughtful individuals to participate in the development of an organic brain-mind, in which each individual functions as a voluntary and conscious neuroblast, a germinal or embryonic cell that can become a part of the emerging planetary nervous system. In Cosmic Humanism we envision Eastern mysticism and Western science as two complementary lobes of the world brain, two halfs of the earth-armature which in rotation will in time generate the current that supplies the light, warmth and power for our evolving planetary society.<p>The major thesis of this "search for sysnthsis" is that the world requires a vast "integration of knowledge" program to unify the globe spiritually and socially and give meaning and purpose to human existence. There are great difficulties facing this program of social systhesis to be proliferated by way of a world philosophy-a "universal belief-system," as Sir Julian Huxley has termed it. I have dealt with most of these problems in various contexts in the past, the most systematic treatments being in two previous volumes, "The Integration of Human Knowledge" (1958) and "Cosmic Humanism" (1966).<p>One of the most challenging undertakings facing our vast enterprise is the over-riding need to create a synthesis of the religions and arts of the ancient East and the sciences and technologies of the modern West. Let us glance at this project.<p>Return to:   |<a href="#top">Top</a>    |<p><a name=ancient><IMG Align="top" SRC="nebula.gif"><b>  II. The Ancient East and the Modern West:</b></a><p>Another way to put the issue is to say that the time has come to resynthesize the subjective and the objective, introvert abd the extrovert civilizations, and achieve a higher harmony of viewpoints. We need to remember that even Japan was not aggressive until it learned the trick from the West. The art of Japan, before the forcing of the doors, was in tune with the oriental tradition. And what happened in Japan and China is becoming Westernized is a warning to us of what may happen if the Orient takes over the principles of Occidental culture without sysnthesis with its own native intuitions. When Japn took on Western technology, she thre overboard much of her own culture. And heaven help the West if China and India, and other Oriental nations decide to do the same thing.<p>If this new sysnthesis which is to restore cultural and spiritual unity is to be achieved, it will have to be the Occidentals who in some degree turn in humility to the East. This we are now doing. We Westerners went to the East in search of markets-outlets for the products of our mechanical power-but we now must return from that excursion magnetized with the essence of the religions of the East. Our main hope of survival in this highly polarized world lies in a prodigious effort at systhesis of the two cultures while there is still time. If the Orient decides that the only way to meet the West is on its own ground, this may write finis to the story for all of us, East and West.<p>Evidence of the West's turn toward the subjective world of inner riches is sen in the increasing importance atached to psychosomatic medice, parapsychology, Chinese acupuncture, Carl Jung's analytical psychology, Zen meditations, and other inwardly oriented researches. To these must be added the growing interest in Eastern thought as illustrated by the expositions of Aldous Huxley, E.A. Burtt, F.S.C. Northrop, Alan Watts and others. This re-entry of the spiritual factor in life and education is something more than the recrudescence of some earlier form of Westernized religion, whether this be the non-orthodoxy of "crisis" theologians like Karl Barth and Reinhold Niebuhr or the "non-Thomism" of Jacques Maritain and Mortimer Adler.<p>In the education for the new age, the East-West philosophy will find its proper vehicle. Here we will have the components of a complete theory:<p>(a) Subjective planning: a theory of the creative self-development of the human individual-Emergent Man.<br>(b) Objective planning: a theory of the good society for the human person to inhabit-the World Sensorium.<p>What needs to be done, of course, is that the psychological and social implications of the education for the new age be stated as explicitly  as possible, following which it will then be possible to test the validity of the principles in their applications. Clearly the testing must be done in terms of the operational techniques relevant to e.g., Hindu psychology, rather than by Western positivistic procedures. Until this program has been given a fair trail, it is a waste of time to prejudge the issue. It must always be remembered, however, that the ancient East and the modern West approaches an understanding of man are not mutually exclusive alternatives. In some instances, these two viewpoints give us two different "languages" for stating the truths about human nature, and we are not faced by an either-or antithesis.<p>Return to:   |<a href="#top">Top</a>    |<p>That the research project we have here so briefly sketched-the quest for planetary transposable principles-is not some vague philosophical fantasy but an urgent need, is indicated by the document drawn up by the Department of Cultural Activities of UNESCO, which formulated the theme for discussion in these terms: <br><blockquote>"The Conception of man and the Philosophy of Education in East and West.<br>UNESCO could not remain indifferent to this problem (of East and West); it was bound to face squarely in the present circumstances of the world, brought about by the rapid process of unification, the reduction of distances, the growing importance of technology, the gradual attainment by all peoples of political independence, and above all, the disquiet and perplexity prevailing among the two great civilizations of yesterday, ready to give birth to the one civilization of tomorrow, but cowering under the threat of a world crisis far beyond their capacity to control."</blockquote><p>Lack of space prohibits further quotation from this excellent document, which formed the basis of the discussion of the American Philosophical Association (meeting in St. Louis, May, 1935). One must see from this that, slowly but surely, both civilizations, East and West, are converging toward a higher synthesis of views about man and the ideal society for man's further development.<p><a name=educate><IMG Align="top" SRC="nebula.gif"><b> III: The Challenge to Education</b></a> <p>If the peoples of the world are to meet the challenges and the opportunities, they will need to enter the stream of world history and participate in time's movement toward the embyrogensis of the new humanity. And that brings us to the paramount role of education, at all levels, in the creation  of the world of the future. Unfortunately, our contemporary educational systems are likely to fall short of the opportunity; they are in danger of becoming sterile because they are depriving youth of curiosity and the sense of wonder. Our advances in the sciences have frequently been made by thinkers who have won their freedom at the cost of precious time. In our world we humans are too often numbed by a varnish of factual information which keep out the vibrations of wonder. Would a renaissance of wonder, using the tools and methods of science in the freshness of a new enthusiasm, be possible today? Cosmic Humanism believes that this is feasible, and holds that if we can keep open the channels of creativity, it will be possible for human intelligence to provide a new focus of aspiration to replace the outmoded systems of thought and education which are rapidly loosing their cohesive force. This social lens may well find its focus in the worship of the Unknown God-the Cosmic Imagination-whose nature man progressively discovers as he increasinly penetrates the dimensions of the universe. Perhaps we should make a "religion"  of this search for systhesis. The religion of science (knowledge) would embody a sense of awe, Pentacostal in its effect, for creative vision is never of that which is traditional and obsolete, but always of something in process and awaiting manifestation.<p>Man's inherent spiritual elan must come into the picture if he is to be galvanized into enthusian and action. This is partly a problem of the interpretation of the latest discoveries from specialized fields of science and partly a matter of educating the new generations into the appropriate mental attitudes for citizenship in the world of tomorrow. To these tasks Cosmic Humanism will devote some of its time and energy. It invites all who are interested in synthesis to join in the undertaking. Given the fundamental truths about man and his relation to nature and the Cosmic Imagination-though truths are not so much "given" as "found" by searching-one can us ethe techniques of communication to spread them abroad. The great human adventure can be rescued from disaster provided we can learn to achieve objectivity in truth judgements. That is the goal of a world philosophy.<p>Return to:   |<a href="#top">Top</a>    |<p>Everything that man has created, which is not the result of accident, came into being first in his mind. Mental vision must come before action, if action is to be anything more than mere impulse or habit. But no idea can remain entirely on the plane of mental vision and have any effect on the world of steel and stone. There must be coordination of idea, faith and action.<p>One must experience, live out, what one believes in theory. One must create in embryo what one wishes to grow to maturity. Therefore, in a planetary democracy, we need thinkers all over the world and on all levels, thinkers who can strike below the surface and create new forms where all creation begins-in the subtle world of formative energies. Progress in the physical sciences in recent centuries arose out of the efforts to create a coherent theory of physical reality. When the same effort is made to match it with a unified theory of social science, we shall achieve the same progress. If the creation of this new philosophy and its ethos depends upon the availability of a scientific humanism to energize our social reforms, we must even now seek out this new synthesis and put it to work. The heart of Cosmic Humanism is the determination to regard truth as useful and put it to work. To apply knowledge for the purpose of guiding social change and individual self development-that is the goal of a scientific humanism.<p><a name=divine><IMG Align="top" SRC="nebula.gif"><b>  IV. Creative Imagination: The Divinity in Man</b></a><p>In the present world-view the reader is offered the idea of imagination as the key-concept for interptreting man and nature. Imagination we have defined as the ""organizational factor which puts parts together in their right times and places to make products". It is the external world of evolving things we find this imagination manifested as guiding fields of influence, and in man's subjewctive world this organizing field is known as creative intelligence. According to this hypothesis, when the undifferentiated energy of the Cosmic Field is focused by the cosmic lens into "particles" in the manifest world, the story of creation is started on its way. It must be remembered, however,  that this is "creation" in some region of a cosmos infinite in space and eternal in time, as a contemporary Giordano Bruno might picture it. Moreover, creation is never exnihilo, not making "something out of nothing"; but is a manisfestation of the transformation of field energy into matter. From the level of "ultimate particles" to the highest reaches of reality, the spiral course of emergent evolution carries forward the story of what Professor A.N. Whitehead termed the "creative advance of nature", exploring its way through fields of unfolding possibilities until at long last, as we measure time, it culminates in man, the highest product of evolution-too date-here on the earth. Thus for the Cosmic Humanist, God is not the creator of cosmic energy-It is the form-producing field of influence which operates with the matter energy cycle to guide evolutionary integrations.<p>Return to:   |<a href="#top">Top</a>    |<p>From this point of view, man is the exploratory tip of the creative advance; the god-in-man is the highest manisfestation of the Cosmic Imagination that we are familiar with in this world. But to repeat, creation, whether cosmic or human,  is never making something out of nothing; it is giving form to that which was without form. Human creativity is making incarnate man's visions of new possibilities.<p>To some individuals the term "imagination" has a derogatory connotation, suggesting fantasy and unreality. But as John Dewey pointed out in "A Common Faith". an ideal is not an illusion just because imagination is the organ through which it is envisaged. Creativity on the basis of past achievements, and constructiveness on the foundation of emerging possibilities- that is the surge of cosmic energy as it thunders up through biological evolution to emerge as integrated human consciousness and behavior. This cosmic energy is a non-moral force in the World, until it reaches up into human personality where it takes on moral qualities.<p><a name=mystery><IMG Align="top" SRC="nebula.gif"><b>  V. The World Mystery</b></a><p>We have already observed the fact that nature appears to us under the guise of a relative dualism of energy and matter, waves and particles, fields and corpuscles. This complementarity appears on all levels of emergent evolution. Man likewise is a duality, and his two-fold nature of "soul" and "body" expresses the relative dualism of the invisible man of field-forces and the visible man of particles. Just as there is in man a super-particle field which guides the course of evolution. Sometimes this invisible reality is designated as the "real" world; yet this reality is not some other world, any more than the soul of man is some other man. Both worlds are one; both men are one. The visible and tangible world is fused in every atom of its substance with its guiding field of the formative world; every cell of man's body is fused with the wave-system which is a part of one's total being. The laws of the one are complementary to the laws of the other.<p>The world mystery is not something elsewhere in the universe of which "ones goes in search." Without the mystery, there would be no man, no world. We are in and of the mystery, the as-yet-unknown, and man's finite intelligence has the embryonic means and the urge to unravel the mystery and convert insights into working knowledge, thus transmuting faith into action.<p>The crisis that man faces today is deeply challenging-even rather frightening. But there is still time and inspiration for mankind to create the World Civilization, especially if we are able to generate the "supermind" of a transformed humanity. Guided by Sri Aurobindo's "The Ideal of Human Unity", the avatars of synthesis all over the globe are helping to elevate human consciousness to the realm of "supramental light" that will illuminate the pathway to the emergence of World Union, Planetary Democracy and Cosmic Man.<p>   <hr>Return to:|   <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <a href="reiser.html">Reiser</a>  |  <a href="messenger.html">The Portal Messenger</a>   |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index2.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>               |<p><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995-1996 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

<html><a name=top></a><head><title>Sitchin</title></head><body bgcolor="#CD853F"peru="#CD853F"><IMG SRC="divine.gif" align="left"><p><br><center><H2>The Arrival of the Others</H2></center><center>A review by:</center><center> Willard Van De Bogart</center><P><hr><p><font size=5>T</font>here is one small request I have before I make any comments about this book: go buy this book immediately. You may ask yourself why. I believe it will educate you to the possibility that who we call God may actually be a visitor from another planet. You may wonder if I actually believe that. Well, I do, and I came to that realization by accepting the scholarship of Zecharia Sitchin.<p>What kind of scholarship would allow Sitchin to deduce that God came from another planet? Does he offer a good argument to convince others? The journey one takes with Sitchin is a very long one in terms of time spent reading the material. To first complete the Earth Chronicle series and then read Divine Encounters will require several months of steady reading. <p>When the reader finally arrives at Divine Encounters, there are many names that will sound familiar. Enki and Enlil will have top billing along with Innana. In Divine Encounters, Sitchin refreshes our memories of the Gods from olden days, and brings us up to around the year 400 B.C.Ancient history has never been so exciting as when narrated by Sitchin. The Old Testament takes on a whole different feel, as well as all the books in the Bible. Reading Sitchin, we gain a new sense of reality about the mysterious personages of times past, and we begin to understand what it was like when ancient kings had ecstatic dreams and visions of angelic emissaries from distant worlds.<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p>We in the late 20th century, who have only within the last 50 years attained refinement in our use of technology, may find it hard to believe how cultures could last for 2000 years or more. The time line Sitchin reveals to the reader is 4,000 B.C. to 400 B.C., with stories about 6,000 years old. It is a privelege to experience how Sitchin reveals all the family lines during this era.  Especially fascinating is the manner in which Kings and Priests received their divine instructions and visions. These visions appeared to come from other worldly origins. There have been few if any authors who have carefully taken excerpts from the books of the Old Testament. Fewer still have taken Sitchin's care to bring to our understanding what it is these ancient people attempted to express.<p>On page 204, Sitchin mentions what Ezekiel had experienced:<blockquote>"And it came to pass in the thirtieth year,<br>in the fourth month, on the fifth day therof,<p>as I was among the captives by the river Chebar,<br>that the heavens were open<br>and I saw divine visions.</blockquote><p>Sitchin states, "Thus begins the bibical Book of Ezekiel. Its forty-eight chapters are replete with visions and Divine Encounter. The opening vision, that of a Divine Chariot, is one of the most remarkable records of a UFO witnessed in antiquity."<p><a name="ezekiel"><center><h3>Background on Ezekiel</h3></center><center><IMG SRC="sumersm.gif"></center><center>Look for this logo to return to review after visiting the Ezekiel papers</center><p><ul><li><a href="../Portal_Ship/ezekiel.html">The Space Ships of Ezekiel</a><li><a href="../Portal_Ship/prophet.html">The Prophet Ezekiel</a><li><a href="../Portal_Ship/zeta.html">Whom did Ezekiel Meet?</a></ul><p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p>As a child I heard many voices and communicated with the stars, and was completely convinced of their divine origins. When I read that Peter Marshall, Chaplin US Senate 1946-48, was beaconed by the Lord through voices, I sensed that I too was being communicated with by entities of other worldly origins.<p>We modern humans have told these tales, created science fiction movies, and constructed countless scenarios depicting the unknown. Sitchin, however, creates a history far beyond anything we have seen or read in our modern history books. Words that come to mind to describe Sitchin's writings are spectacular and fantastic.<p>If the reader of this review can stand the suspense of waiting until the last chapter in Sitchin's book then good luck. I did wait, because the material you will read prepares you for the most outstanding chapter of all: The ENDPAPER: God, The Extraterrestrial.<p>Sitchin comes right out of the gate with this chaper, and asks the leading question, "So, who was Yahweh?' What a great question. "Was He one of them?" Was He an extraterrestrial?" Sitchin writes the greatest mystery play ever as he tries to discover who Yahweh was. Sitchin is like Sherlock Holmes, and analyzes Enki and Enlil as possible candidates for the role of Yahweh. Sitchin leaves no stone unturned on this hunt for the truth. He writes, "This aspect of the similarities between Enki and Yahweh becomes more emphatic--and in one respect perhaps even embarassingly so for the monotheistic Bible--when we reach a passage in the Book of Proverbs in which the unsurpassed greatness of Yahweh is brought out by rhetorical questions:"<p><blockquote>"Who hath ascended up to heaven,<br>and descended too?<br>Who hath cupped the wind in his hands,<br>and bound the waters as in a cloak?<br>Who hath established the Apsei-eretz-<br>What is his name,<br>and what is his son's name-<br>if thou can tell"?</blockquote><p>The most astounding consideration Sitchin offers us is that the human race was genetically put together by our Gods, the Nibiruans, also referred to as the Nefilim and the Elohim. Sitchin provides this piece of information for us to ponder: "After Anu, the ruler on Nibiru, returned to Nibiru after visiting Earth, it was Enlil who was summoned topreside over the council of the Great Anunnaki whenever major decisions had to be made".<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p>So one can only wonder if the Lord of Nibiru will return, and when? Keep in mind that 3,600 years for Anu equals only one of our years here on Earth. One revolution around the sun for Nibiru is called a Shar. The return is near at hand, and all the cultures on Earth are beginning to feel their own cosmologies being triggered by a deep psychological need to express this event of the coming. The Christians feel the Rapture coming, the Hopi feel their Lost Brother returning, the Mayans feel the return of Quetzalcoatl, and the myth is repeated a thousand times over throughout all the indigenous tribes on Earth. Will Yahweh return once again, and will we see it as a chariot or as another indescribable event? Will people 2000 years from now be as mystified as the Egyptians were when the Golden Disc appeared in the sky?<p>After the sons Enki and Enlil have proven not to be Yahweh, who then is left to be given the title of Yahweh, the great shining God from on high?<p>Sitchin describes eloquently, and with simple conviction, who the one true God is. The God of the heavens who made man in his image and the God who Sitchin says..."is the Image of a Cosmic Voyager. It is an image of a  universal Lord that is best summed up in the hymnal prayer:<i><h3>Adon Olam</h3></i> that is recited as a majestic song in Jewish synagogue services on festivals, on the Sabbath, and on each and every day of the year:.."<p><blockquote><i><h3>Lord of the universe, who has reigned<br>Ere all that exists had yet been created.<br>When by His will all things were wrought,<br>"Sovereign" was His name was then pronounced.<p>And when, in time, all things shall cease,<br>He shall still reign in majesty.<br>He was, He is, He shall remain,<br>He shall continue gloriously.<p>Incomparable, unique He is,<br>No other can His oneness share.<br>Without beginning, without end.<br>Dominion's might is His to bear.</h3></i></blockquote><p>All I can say is enjoy this divine cosmic journey. Open your mind, and ponder this for a while: "In our dreams we too are visited by the angels of the Lord."<p><hr><p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p><center><h3>The Earth Chronicles: By: Zecharia Sitchin</h3></center><p><ul><li>The Twelfth Planet (1976)<li>The Stairway to Heaven (1980)<li>The Wars of Gods and Men (1985)<li>The Lost Realms (1990)<li>(RECAP) Genesis Revisited (1990) <li>When Time Began (1993)</ul><p><h3>Latest Release</h3><p><ul><li>Divine Encounters (1995) A Guide to Visions, Angels, and other Emissaries</ul><p>Zecharia Sitchin's Earth Chronicles and Divine Encounters are available in paperback from Avon Books, 1350 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10019; 1-800-238-0658.<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p><hr>Return to:|   <a href="sitchin.html">Zecharia Sitchin</a>  |  <a href="messenger.html">The Portal Messenger</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>   |<P><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995-1996 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

The premise is supported by views taken from the fields of Phenomenology and Information Science. The impact on global society and the changes that may be expected are expressed as a direct outgrowth of the juxtaposition of humans sharing their accumulated experiences in 3D image databases. Thoughts about how perception is being altered is expressed and material for the instruction and understanding of working with computer imagery is provided.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p><b>Introduction</b><p>                               This article is about phenomenology, information science, sociology, perception and 3D computer images. It is also about evolution, understanding and expression. The article is motivated by observing a wide range of interpretations on the meaning of computer generated imagery. These issues range from putting computer imagery into a historical art context (1) for understanding, to views that the computer is code dependent (2), and, therefore, the images which one can make on the computer have basic constraints ,and have limited modes of expression to offer the user.<p>The larger issue, from a sociological perspective, stems from the bridging of the artistic process with technological methodologies. My first major encounter with this schism came in 1970 as one of the many who first entered the doors of Walt Disney's legacy to the art world...ie The California Institute of the Arts. I entered the design department to explore new relationships with media tools which for me, at that time, included lasers, electronic music synthesizers and video studios. The dance department, as well as the art department, and even the traditional music department found it increasingly difficult to understand why anyone in art school would embrace technology as a creative medium.(3) Afterall, technology was too mechanical, insensitive, highly sterile and , therefore, non-artistic.<p>However, as Bach and Chopin melodies would drift into the evening air over the olive groves of the then Villa Cabrini Nunnery, the first site for CAL ARTS, so did unusual electronic sounds, and every once in a while a thin pencil like beam of light from a helium neon laser could be seen laced through the evening fog around the rose gardens.<p>So, what does all this have to do with cognition, perception and the computer? Well, by the sounds of discontent and confusion that exists in trying to place computer images in their proper historical context I would say quite a lot. Some things never change, and it seems the language to be developed for defining creative visual work done on the computer is still in a quandary as it was when trying to understand electronic music and laser imagery. The confusion between real art, real design and how these forms are executed on a computer has not been sufficiently understood by those critics who are constantly trying to associate creativity done with technology and especially with work executed on a computer.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>The most recent confusion with computers centers around the words visualization and imagery. But the confusion here concerns itself on a descriptive level with the meaning of these words and does not enter the  levels of understanding which refers to the inner manipulation of verbal symbols that coincide with the visual symbols created on a computer. The difficulty I am going to have in writing this paper, and the difficulty for you the reader is to define a common ground of meaning with terminology so some sense of continuity will result in what I have to say.<p>Basically the problem for the both of us is going to be in using words and linguistics to conjure up visual metaphors(4) which describe what it is we are seeing on the computer screen. The temporal organization of the "personal psychosm" a term developed by Dr,s Von Eckartsberg, can aid in the understanding of new visual metaphors in describing 3D computer imagery. Every new computer image creates a new matrix of meaning structures in the human mind which will require a deeper understanding of complex information data structures which are inherent in computer imagery.<p>At the beginning of this paper I stated this article would be about phenomenology, information science, sociology, perception and 3D graphics. The reason this article concerns itself with these topical areas is because it is my firm belief that the way one perceives reality is influenced by what is seen on the computer workstations, and the way in which these images are analyzed in terms of their meaning is falling short of understanding man's unique place in a world filled with digital imagery. These topical areas have been chosen because they represent those  areas which will support my position that the way some perceive the world today is a result of images seen on the computer.<p>In a way, man's dependency on his technological environment is a classic case of a global cybernetic system, and it is my contention that it is not possible to entertain thought about the global cybernetic system which would be separate from the system itself. Man has evolved to an inseparable and inextricable woven state of being between technology and existence. For all of us who recently saw a simulated model of Neptune rotating on its axis being transmitted from the Voyager 2 space craft 12 billion miles away I suggest that our perception of the solar system has changed and that our perceived place in the universe has been altered. Why? Because in the twelve years it took the Voyager 2 spacecraft to reach Neptune, computer modeling in real time was only a thought back in the late  70's and our mental perception of this distant planet now has been made visible in our mind's eye by new visualization technologies. What was once invisible is now visible. Keeping this thought in mind I would now like to pursue some thoughts on reality as we perceive it today as a result of being exposed to, and as a result of working with 3 dimensional images on the computer screen. <p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p><b>The topics to be discussed will be:</b><p><ul><li>The phenomenology of the image.<li>The Information Science of Image Processing.<li>The sociological Impact of image making by the computer.<li>How to perceive new visual symbols.<li>The interface of two realities...ie 3D computer space and the real world.</ul><p><b>The Phenomenology of the Image</b><p>Before I take an excursion into how we perceive the outside world its important to establish the premise for this paper. That premise is that the way we as humans perceive the world, our actions in it, and eventually the way we create in it is directly being influenced by computer generated images. In order to construct an argument for this point of view it will be necessary to explore the way we as humans process signals from the outside world which enter our bodies.<p>Phenomenologically speaking the areas I am interested in are memories, anticipation, imagination, cognition and perception. Lets start with memories. If I ask you to remember something; what happens? Simply put you remember. However, remembering has a time vector going into the past associated with it. The major portion of human history was recalled mentally and then transmitted verbally, then in stone, then with the written word, then photographically, cinematically, and now with video and electronic photography. Today I can remember with the assistance of an optical storage database. Whats that? Its a device that allows a human to view on a computer screen images which have been stored from images taken from any time period of that person's past or present life. The time vector is no longer linear. The time vector now can be changed by telling the optical storage device to recall images in specific intervals, for specific durations, and it can even select only specific images from different time periods. What was once the provenance of mood, or feelings, when it came to remembering, has now been redefined by an array of images that can be preset to follow any topological path programmed by the computer. The very act of memory, within a global environment fed by programmed images alters the way memory initially began and provides a human with a processed sense of human time.<p>For example: before Voyager 2 reached Neptune my ability to remember anything about Neptune was reduced to some vague planet in the distant solar system. Today when I remember Neptune it revolves in my mind as well as all of Neptune's moons, and I feel confident that these mental images are real.  However, these images of Neptune were made through transformed digital and numerical representations of what Voyager 2 was looking at. The new technology took the digital information and created a visualized model of Neptune. Although I think I know what Neptune looks like I needed the visual dimensioning capabilities of the computer to provide me with a realistic mental picture of Neptune. It is safe to say I now have a digital Neptune "in my brain". The question: as a result of a digital Neptune spinning in my brain will I perceive the solar system any differently? If I do perceive the solar system any differently how will it appear differently?<p>The answer: I can now look into the night sky and see Neptune 12 billion miles away because its in my mind's eye. The planet is not static to me anymore, it was not an artificial model I saw in the planetarium, or an animated film based on previous facts about Neptune; this is Neptune 12 billion miles away. My personal universe has expanded.Another example: If I take a childhood photograph and I convert it digitally into the computer using a scanner I can then animate myself using the same background on the photograph. I can also digitize film footage or video footage of when I was a child. When I look at the same environment in the real world today, as an adult, I can now remember what it was like when I was a child moving in the same place. The difference of course is that I can also look at my childhood and my adulthood simultaneously on the computer screen with the aid of windowing software..ie a user interface which allows the screen to contain a variety of images on the screen at the same time. Reality has been changed for me because I can associate images between the outside world and in my optically stored world and the possibilities to rearrange stored images allows me to think better of how I may rearrange my present world.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>The phenomenon of anticipation is similar to memory but anticipation has a time vector which goes into future time for an event which is about to happen. At this point another very profound change has occurred and that is the way we think with computer imagery. As I watch my animatedchildhood progress before my eyes on the computer screen I know that I can alter time sequences within the computer. As I create the direction my images will take I also know how to anticipate the next scene since I have seen them and even lived them. However, if I randomize my stored images I can see new associations of my own life's pattern. When I return to the real world I begin to realize that how I anticipate can have many options and that many variations of environments could be experienced. The time line in the real world has been loosened and the knowledge that I can vary my direction causes me to select an action which may not have any relationship to the action which just preceded it. What this means is my decisions now have the capability of being multi-directional, and I find myself in a true post-modern world of multiple associations and constructions.<p> This one facet of experiencing images on the computer has completely altered my world view and my frame of reference to it. Now lets place into this matrix of multi-dimensionality the phenomenology of the imagination. The imagination vector goes in any time direction and carries with it any remembered image. For me, I can now imagine a realistic Neptune juxtaposed with an imaginary civilization on Neptune. I can even place events on this computerized planet made possible by the imaging power of the computer. When I go to my workstation to create an image I know I have a database of images that were once invisible and now are made visible and I can begin to explore relationships within my 3D computerized world from a mental imaginary frame work of a realistic projection of 12 billion miles into space.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>The renaissance was dealing with only the seen vanishing point. The mental latitude and longitude of my imagination has expanded to such an extent that a simple vanishing point is only one small dot in a universe of dots. Therefore, the creative mind now sitting in front of a 3D computer workstation has a mind set of a new space of coordinates to create from, and it is these coordinates that have leaped far beyond any system of esthetics from which to be judged.Compounding this new realization derived from the visual capabilities of the computer is the phenomenology of thinking. When I stated that any remembered image could travel on the imagination vector thinking is an interlocking system of associations which also travels on these vectors. Another way to look at this is that the mind develops a template by which to observe the outside world. For humans the integrity of these templates is essential for maintaining a state of mental balancing. The logical and illogical structuring of ideas in association with any given template is what constitutes all the various ways of thinking on this planet. When a mental template which has been developed from the real world encounters the 3D world of the computer something very profound begins to occur. This becomes very intriguing especially when there are shared databases constructed from  different templates. The creation of visual imagery within a 3D computer reality which can make associations from any of these templates underscores and defines the postmodern world.<p>The last phenomenological framework to be discussed is perception. What then is perception?(5) Perception is the organization of our sensations. How is one to understand 3D space within a computer? The computer processes data, the representation of which can be placed in 3D mental perception.<p>The data that is represented that is also composed of multiple mental templates. Therefore,to describe 3D space in the computer from any one position in the real world  categorically will not work. The implications of this are equivalent to all the major paradigm shifts which have occurred in human history. If the computer becomes the main depository of all human mental templates and also has the ability to create 3 D realities or virtual realities humans will begin to see that their dependency on their own willfulness to maintain mental balance will be then allocated to the computer. It is at this point a whole new perception of the world will undergo drastic changes which can be seen in isolated cases today and which I will mention in the section on the sociological impact of image making by the computer.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p><b>The Information Science of Image Processing:</b><p>Reference was made in the previous section to images stored in databases. This area deals with considerations on how an image is interpreted, processed, and manipulated by a human being. Whereas phenomenology concerns itself with the psychological aspects to cognition, information science concerns itself with the way images are processed as a result of a psychological state. This is particularly important as electronic image management (EIM)(6) becomes the predominant retrieval activity for viewing human evolution. Another way to look at this is through picture management7. Reality as we know it has no fixed interpretation other than the interpretation of data exchanged and agreed upon by consenting humans. Virtual reality is a construct within the computer which can simulate the real world. By placing a specially designed helmet which contains small computer screens it is then possible to navigate in a computer generated world in such a way which would be impossible to do in the real world.<p>The virtual reality is a visual construction from many types of data that can then be formed into images. Lets for a moment enter the virtual world. In keeping with the Neptune analogy lets enter the virtual world where Neptune appears to be in space. In reality Neptune is in space, but in the virtual world this space can be navigated in, and for the viewer there is the sense that one is moving in this space. There is also a stereographic way in which to look at computer images simply by putting on a special set of glasses. The point is that not only can a designer or an artist create within a computer image but they can also create new images using stored images from a vast image database. The complexities arise when a created image is then sent through a network to another person who has to alter, add to, or participate in the image that has been created.A great deal of development has occurred to enable the designer and artist to have the tools by which to create with. What has not developed is the realization that these attempts to create either artistic images and even new design techniques on the computer are coming from an entirely new and paradigmatic visual relationship with the real world. Once the phenomenon of new 3D visual experiences from the computer affects the psychological association with the real world it then follows that the way in which new images are created and identified will also change.<p> However, since there is a dependency on the real world for physical existence the way in which the world is perceived will be reflective of the way images can be created on the computer. How this translates into image processing on the human level requires an equal understanding for new thought arrangements as it does to understand the way in which images are created on the computer. The taxonomy of computer imagery will require an equal esthetic philosophy to be developed. Since philosophy is dependent on language it follows that systems of thinking which were an outgrowth of a predominant 2D visual reconstruction of the real world will require another dimensional aspect for interpretation. In otherwords, we have to become Z buffered in our thinking. Marshall McCluhan, the Canadian media philosopher had provided some remarkable insights in his book the Gutenberg Galaxy. His contribution was seeing oral culture transform itself into a print culture and then into an electronic culture What is occurring today is this electronic culture is transforming itself into a computer culture. How computer images are processed depends on how they are classified in a Z buffered mental space.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p> Therefore, if the frame of reference by which to understand newly created 3D images is not matched by a system of thought that incorporates multiple dimensional associative metaphors then those images can never be understood in their proper sociological, philosophical or esthetic context.Compounding the issue of perceived reality changing as a result of 3D computer imagery is the state when a perfect virtual reality representation of the real world can be called up and placed in the virtual reality space composed of other images. Associations which are now made in the real world have to be considered from how they will be processed in the interactive 3D image database. Therefore, any image created today within 3D computer space reflects the emergence of a mental state that has been spatially expanded and is in fact representative of an entirely new way to communicate between our fellow humans. The "Event World" (8), the world humans interact with everyday, has been transformed and the incoming data is being processed by a new way of thinking.<p>Dr. Debons who has developed the "Debonian Information Model". Debons illustrates how the flow of data from the event world into our thinking processes effects the way we communicate. By showing how data is transformed into information Debons also shows how all perception is virtual since reality is always a function of the sensory mechanism. Whereas, phenomenology is the study of behavior as a result of our experiences, information science is the study of how data is transformed into information as a result of the predominant mental template that is processing the data. Both our behavior as humans and how we process incoming data is now undergoing new transformations when considering the new 3D image making capabilities proviedd by the computer.<p><b>The Sociological Impact of Image Making by the Computer</b><p>As was mentioned in the phenomenology of thinking the computer willbecome the depository of all mental templates currently on the planet. The ability to retrieve images from a visual database and alter those images is  allowing a new reconstruction of the world to take place. Although the computer can not duplicate reality it can process images of reality in ways we have never seen in reality before. Micro worlds are being juxtaposed with macro worlds and super computers are sending information around the world to be shared with other super computers and eventually viewed by the end user. However, it is at the user level that all the changes in society are emanating from. The issue here is extremely complex given that the mental referencing to computer images has been experienced, as well as the way new data is processed mentally with these new mental visual referencing experiences which have been generated from the 3D imagery on the computer screen. The social interaction of humans follows a predetermined set of rules, code of ethics, and behavior patterns especially for a specific social set.<p> The visual symbols which represent each social set have been fairly stable through out time. However, as a result of being able to alter any symbol within the computer the social patterns have likewise become loossened. When all the symbols of a culture can be rotated or be placed into cylinders and jettisoned into 3D space the real world becomes very fluid and there is a new sense of playing with symbols. If you are not allowed to burn a flag in the real world can you burn a flag in a virtual world? The loosening of the meaning of the flag as a symbol in the United States has reached the point where a special amendment to the constitution is being suggested to assure that people can not deface its image.<p> Behavior patterns are likewise being altered. Roger Rabbit, an animated cartoon character developed by Stephen Spielberg, became a new addition to human interaction. People no longer want to entertain a long pattern of meaning throughout a lifetime, but will almost instantly leave one relationship for another. Not only has the meaning of symbols undergone change, but also the configuration of how meaningful events are juxtaposed to one another. The ability to alter space on a computer screen has been carried over into the altering of physical space in the real world, and people are just supposed to adapt to those changes. The reflectivity of the computer society is quite different from the print society. Whereas print follows a predictable path of behavior the computer offers new and very surprising social behaviors. If the computer continually offers unique and very personal experiences for the user the ability for humans to interact in any meaningful way may become non existent. Therefore, it is at this time in the evolution of the development of 3D computer images that we can begin to see how the perception of reality is undergoing a significant alteration and the accompanying behaviors that are associated with that perception stem from how reality is manipulated on the computer screen.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p><b>How to Perceive New Visual Symbols</b><p>Given the assumption that there has been a new mental framework developed as a result of 3D computer imagery the next issue , and the most fascinating one of all, is not only how to detect new visual symbols within the computer, but also how to understand them from the traditionally based disciplines of esthetics, philosophy, psychology and communication theory.<p>In light of this there is a statement by Yuchiro Kawaguchi, a noted Japanese computer graphic artist , which has special significance. Kawaguchi states, "Theory on perception today is spoken of as a requisite of existence. Perception in an imaginative world is based, if anything, on personal experience, and is co-existent with conditions of being, Computer Graphics, as a tool measuring the revelation of non-existent things, may be rather synonymous with existence.It is no exaggeration to say that computer graphics will have to take up the challenge of experimenting in such visible territories as essential elements of its future mission. Computer graphics is not satisfied simply to surpass a simple spatial phase; it must go beyond even a time stage. Perhaps we ought to construct computer graphics so that it will push out in a wider sphere the viewpoints of artistic materials...the artists qualities to be born by computer graphics may very well exist in a certain manner in a new expression that mixes such time and space. They may rightfully hold a new sense in opposition to the inevitable time and space held by things like transformation and metamorphosis"9.<p>What is he saying? He is talking about the way we will come to perceive the 3D image and that these images will be regarded as having qualities that surpass the time and space existence we are so familiar with in our own world. Kawaguchi sees the inner world of the computer expanding as new memory chips are developed and he even feels there may be ways to surpass the ability of the computer to relay images beyond the capacity of our eyes and ears.Consequently, our phenomenological frame work will be receiving information on a new spatial level and the ability to create within this new 3D space will reveal new designs and modes of expression which mirror this new mental framework. Its difficult to understand these new developments especially when there are no methodologies by which to measure this world in terms of its functional design capabilities or artistic expression. However, there are techniques which can be identified. The tools which are provided by the software also provide the user with capabilities of expression which should be looked at very closely. There should be a flow of communication between the new user of a 3D workstation and the experienced operator especially in an instructive environment. Evolving into the future is going to require compassion as well as understanding and the birth of a newly constructed world is being created by scientists, artists, designers, musicians and of course the children.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p><b>The Interface of Two Realities</b><p>Finally we arrive at the point when the computer rendition of reality may be expanding faster than our own ability to comprehend it. Considering the above issue we arrive face to face with the beginnings of virtual realities being fortified by super computers for creating not only realistic images of the real world but at the same time of analyzing that world from any particular professional vantage point. With this interfacing of two realities...ie the real world and the world in the computer there are also the many perceptions of the real world from all the various cultures who will be experiencing the computer reality being sent by fiber optic systems around the planet. The rich texture of global civilization will be able to be called up in a visual database and it is from this database of imagery that the user will begin to interact with an entirely new world.<p>What was once impossible to visualize becomes visible. One example of trying to comprehend this technology is IRIS, the Institute for Research in Information and Scholarship, at Brown University. However, there are new institutes and research centers emerging all over the planet in preparation for learning how to not only use this technology, but also how to think with it.<p>There are words which come to mind that best prepare an individual for understanding this interface and the word elastic seems to provide the best metaphor. The ability to stretch ones thinking beyond the bounds of the mental templates that provides a certain amount of consistency in thinking and a willingness to entertain the limits of the way one has constructed their world. It is clear that the planet earth is reaching a point where it will no longer be able to contain life on its surface due to the inability for a global consensus of the need to stop existing systems  which are destroying social as well as ecological infrastructures. With the  emergence of 3D realities being created with the computer an ideal world can of course be created. However, when an artist who is being affected by   a planet that no longer can support life the virtual world of the computer provides a new palette from which to make a statement. Genetically speaking the global gene pool may have provided mankind with this technology to over ride the various systems of thought which were based more on a survivalist mode rather than a cooperative mode.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>Be that as it may the approach to understanding what is being created within this new 3D reality is unprecedented  in the history of mankind and to spend countless hours in trying to place the newly created images into historical referencing systems is futile. <p>Given the fact that humanity is under more stress than ever before it would be highly prudent to look at the developments in 3D computer imagery from a  solution oriented framework rather than from a historical framework. Humans simply are running out of time. These new technologies of visualization are providing new and revealing ways of how there is interconnections on micro levels and macro levels. Any attempt to place a simple cone on top of a sphere in a 3D landscape might probably be the most important artistic statement made in a long time. Why?Because the the creation was done inside of the computer and the computer represents the beginnings of a global sharing of information and if there is no recognition for the new flexibility to create within the computer then the same systems which have brought mankind to the brink of disaster will continue to follow the same path. The only invested interest mankind should now have is how to recombine all of its present resources so balance is restored. Inside a 3D world new order is being created and although these new combinations may not affect the ozone layer from being depleted they allow new images to be created that are motivated by the need for more integrated planetary structures. Technology is outstripping the ability for most humans to even understand it. Peoples capacity for integrating high technology into their everyday lives is reaching a saturation point where only a few techno-elite individuals are responsible for its direction. Clearly, these issues will also have to be resolved so that both virtual reality and the everyday world are understood as well as integrated.  &copy; 1989 WVDB<p><b>References</b><p><ol><p><li>Jones, Beverly, "Computer Imagery: Imitation and Representation of Reality", Leonardo, Supplemental Issue Computer Art In Context, 31-38 (1989).<li> Youngblood, Gene, "Cinema and the Code", Leonardo, Supplemental Issue Computer Art in Context, 27-30 (1989).<li>Hodgetts, Craig, "Biography of a Teaching Machine", Art Forum, Vol. XIII NO. 1, 61-65 (September 1973).<li>Valle, Ronald S. and von Eckartsberg, Rolf, The Metaphors of Consciousness, (New York: Plenum Press, 1981) pp. 21-93.<li>Huxley, Aldous, The Doors of Perception, (New York: Harper & Row Publishers, 1954).<li>Fisher, Richard D.

Yes!<p>Lets take a brief tour of calendars to see how various cultures mapped either the passage of the moon or the sun. After this brief tour we will then look at the calendar of the 13 moons, and how Jos&eacute; Arg&uuml;elles in his new work titled Dreamspell is bringing to light the Mayan calendrical system of 13 moons to be used as a self divinatory system of planetary transformation.<p>First and foremost a calendar is a system of measuring the passage of time.The easiest way to measure any time was to anticipate the seasons, watch the sun and the moon, or watch how the plants grew at particular times of the year. Albeit this is a simple way to begin this story that is essentially the way it began. Nature has periodic cycles associated with it and star gazing is probable the largest system of measurement that has ever been used. Celestial navigation has been used by all cultures throughout time as even indicated in some of the deciphered records of ancient Sumer which date well into 6000 BC.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>The moon has been the predominant unit of measure. The interval between successive full moons, sometimes referred to as the lunar month, was used by most native cultures. The Lunar month lasts about 29 and one half days. If the sun were used to measure time there is what is called a solar year. The solar year lasts about 365 days and has two crucial points the two equinoxes and the two solstices. The accuracy of such a calendar is established if the equinoxes always fall on or about the same days each year. The kind of a year that is used to do all this measuring is called a tropical year or the year of the seasons. This is dependent on the interval between two successive returns of the sun to the vernal equinox.<p>Most ancient calendars represented some compromise between the lunar and solar years. The Babylonians intercalated an extra month three times in a cycle of  eight years. The Egyptians used a solar calendar and used the Dog Star Sirius as a key marker in the eastern sky. The Romans borrowed from the Greeks, and by the time of Julius Caesar the accumulated errors in all calendars caused the introduction of the Julian Calendar. Caesar ruled that the year we know as 46 B.C. should have 445 days and was called the year of confusion. Interestingly enough the Julian calendar was used for over 1,500 years. After all the corrections the Julian calendar lasted about 365 days.<p>Finally the Gregorian calendar was established to correct any errors in the Julian calendar so in 1582 Pope Gregory XIII corrected the Julian calendar. The Roman Catholic nations adopted the Gregorian calendar, but German states kept the Julian until 1700. Great Britain and all the American Colonies changed to the Gregorian calendar in 1752.<p>That's not all either. There is also a Jewish calendar, a Muslim calendar, a Chinese calendar, and last but not least the one we are so interested in is the Mayan Calendar?<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>The accuracy of the Mayan calendar was amazing. The old calendar had 18 months and 20 days each. There was a name for each month and day, and at the end of the year there were 5 extra days belonging to no particular month. The calendar showed 28 weeks,  each of 13 numbered days or a total of 364 days with only one day left over. The Mayan calendar is one of the most accurate in all the world and considering that the Mayan long count or the beginning of their calendar took place in 3113 B.C. one has to re-consider  how these people were able to understand with such accuracy the movements of the planetary bodies around the earth.<p>This short review brings up the issue of what  it has been like for so many centuries to adjust all these variables to some consensus. The one major factor in all calendars is the movement of the moon , sun, and stars. Today most Westerners take for granted, or don,t even bother to consider the meaning of a calendar. But to the ancients this was a task reserved for only the priests.<p> Dreamspell is a new board game that has been introduced by Jose Arguelles. Dreamspell also has the Mayan calendar displayed as well as an understanding of the 13 moons. Here again the 13 moon calendar is re-appearing after so many centuries. Its not that 13 moons are not being used in the world today by some native tribes, but it is important that the meaning of the 13 moons is understood.Jose is offering Dreamspell players a chance to break out of a time measuring system which is based on productivity and money into a system that allows us to understand the natural cycles embedded in our solar system. However, in Dreamspell it is not only the loom of the 13 moons which are revealed but also the cosmology of the Mayan belief system which reclaims our galactic heritage. Each one of the 13 moons has a different meaning, each one lasts 28 days and each of those days has associated with it the deeper meaning of the Mayan cosmology.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>Ever since Arguelles published his trilogy, Earth Ascending, The Mayan Factor, and Surfers of the Zuvuya many people have come to  know of the Mayan's as a deeply spiritual people who believed in receiving instructions from Hunab Ku on how best to live their lives.Hunab Ku is centered at the hub of our local galaxy. The Mayans called this flow of information from Hunab Ku as the great G force, and used the G symbol on all their temples. To the Mayans this G force represented all the understandings of measurement and movement in the universe. When the Mayans developed their calendar they used a grid composed of 260 squares each with a number associated with it.<p> These numbers represented the movement of the planets in our solar system as well as other sequences which scholars are still discovering. The grid is known as the Tzolkin or the Mayan Sacred Calendar. For over 30 years Arguelles has been studying this grid, and his discovery of how the Mayan's used this calendar is the basis for Dreamspell. As I mentioned earlier the current standard for measuring time is the Gregorian calendar. Keeping in mind that a calendar is a system to measure time it also stands to reason that any calendar will also measure cycles. Arguelles proposes that the Gregorian calendar is an unnatural system to humans to measure time by, and also keeps us humans earth centered rather than galactic centered.<p> This unnaturalness is expressed by Arguelles as "timing frequencies", and the Gregorian frequency is considered a 12/60 frequency meaning 12 months and 60 minutes per hour. This 12/60 frequency or ratio, Arguelles feels, is a timing frequency which represents the "third-dimensional civilization". It is this 12/60 civilization which is responsible for the concept of materialism, and thus the main underpinning for the industrial society which is using up all of natures natural resources.<p>The Mayan calendar, on the other hand, according to Arguelles, functions on a 13/20 frequency which stands for 13 moons, and the 20 sacred glyphs which make up the 20 days in a Mayan month. Dreamspell is, therefore, a board game that allows participation in the correction of the 12/60 timing frequency, and replaces it with the perpetual calendar of the 13 moons.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>The 13 moon calendar provides a perpetually recurring, logically consistent annual time frame in accord with the naturally occuring 13 lunations of planet earth. The 13 moon calendar can do this because it is a galactic timing device.<p>According to Arguelles, being galactic, the adoption of the 13 moon calendar will automatically enter humanity into the 4th dimension. Therefore, the 13 moon calendar gives humanity back to a larger solar-galactic 52 year cycle. It takes exactly 52 cycles of the Mayan calendar to return to the same glyph on the same exact day in the calendar. According to Dreamspell the last possible moment for entering the 13/20 timing frequency is July 26, 1992, and is referred to as Time Shift. Some people also consider this date of July 26, 1992 as Harmonic Convergence II.<p>However, it is to be known as Time Shift. By accepting and adopting the Dreamspell calendar of the 13 moons, Arguelles provides a rite of passage into a new time, the 4th-dimensional order of the Galactic Federation, the great G force, called Hunab Ku by the Mayans.Each Dreamspell player learns the day they were born on in the Mayan calendar, and acquires one of the 20 sacred signs as a "galactic signature", and enters the Rainbow Nation as a kin member. Each kin member also has a number, and a color associated with their sign, and it is one of these 260 numbers comprising the Tzolkin or the Mayan sacred calendar that enables playing the Dreamspell. The Dreamspell board game allows the kin member to move their glyphs or sacred signs over vast periods of time represented on the game boards called the "Chromatic Time Tunnel". <p>By playing Dreamspell you enter this tunnel , and at the other end meet the "galactic fifth force", also known as the Galactic federation. Dreamspellers' learn how to communicate with the Galactic Federation, and reclaim their galactic heritage which was removed by using the 12/60 timing frequency.<p>For example: I am a White Crystal Dog in the Dreamspell, and I use the planet Mercury to assist me in navigating in the Chromatic Time Tunnel. I am guided by the wind and the spirit, and also aided by the moon and challenged by the sun. All the mysterious forces in the known and unknown universe are overseen by the Monkey glyph who presides over all those hidden forces impacting on my life. All of my kin relationships form my personal destiny pattern or my radial polarity configuration. Likewise every other kin has a different set of relationships, and when all the Dreamspell players learn their kin relationships they form the Rainbow Nation, and telepathically communicate in the 4th-dimension. In a nutshell that is the essence of Dreamspell.<p>Return to:|   <a href="#top>Top</a>  |  <a href="willard.html">The Portal Messenger - Willard Van De Bogart</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>   |<P><hr><p><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

However, for the many indigenous cultures the world over the way by which to interpret humankind's present place in history has more to do with the position of the stars in the heavens, and the motion of the planets in our local solar system.<p>Inherent in these two views of interpreting the meaning of the historical moment resides two distinct philosophical positions. These positions can be simply stated as one depending on man made systems, and the other position depending more on natures cycles as well as those of the movement of the many celestial bodies in the universe. From a pure scientific approach the movement of bodies in the heavens has been subsumed under the discipline of celestial mechanics and astronomy. However, from a "cosmic humanistic"  approach the movement and position of these heavenly bodies may be interpreted as the next stage in a new awareness or a new state of consciousness on the planet earth.  If one is to survey the current literature there will be found much testimony that all of humanity is about to shed its old skin, and emerge into a new dimension, and an entirely new way by which to perceive reality. Jacques Vallee's book Dimension is very helpful in understanding this concept of entering another dimension, and being psychologically prepared for its arrival.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>At this point, in this brief introduction, I am trying to indicate how holding on to one's personal point of view about the meaning of existence can change as the meaning or purpose of being alive in the late 20th century undergoes a metamorphose. As each year on earth slips into the next, such as 1993 slipping into 1994, there was also a time, obviously, when the year 4124 BC slipped into 4123 BC. This demarcation of time as indicated by before Christ, BC, and after Christ, AD, in many ways orients all time towards a significant moment in the Christian faith. The celebration of Easter and Christmas relies on the memory of the man called Jesus Christ.<p> This paper is not about Jesus Christ, this paper is about the entire gene pool of the human race entering into the dimensional domain where Jesus Christ came from, Christ Consciousness, and will be the domain where the consciousness of humankind will evolve to. The difficulty is how to indicate this global phenomenon of human transformation in 5000 words or less. To achieve any sense of clarity will require that you, the reader, allow me, the writer, the use of  poetic license rarely granted to any writer.  Former attempts at describing this global phenomenon, such as Dane Rudyar's The Planetarization of Consciousness, and Dr. Oliver L. Reiser's Cosmic Humanism and World Unity do much to aid in this understanding of the evolution of human consciousness.<p>To begin, I am going to start with mentioning a recent meeting that took place in Santa Barbara , California. It was the Fifth Annual International Conference on New Religions headed by J. Gordon Melton of the Center for the Study of American Religion. What was discussed at this conference was the growing interest in new religious beliefs, and a lessening of adherents to Christianity. It was pointed out that formal religions the world over are not furnishing humankind with enough psychological nourishment which enables a deep sense of spiritual cohesiveness or connectedness. As a result of this absence of something more meaningful there has been a renewed interest in belief systems which do offer a sense of connectedness to the  universe, and to life under the vault of heaven. Melton states, "over the last 20 years the amount of interest that has been shown in newer forms of beliefs has reached staggering proportions resulting in many popular beliefs which have broken away from those strict doctrines of the organized religions. One third of all the religious bodies operating in Europe are non-conventional religions, metaphysical, esoteric, and Asian. It was also reported about 50,000 copies of the Secret Doctrine by Helena Petrova Blatvatsky, first published in 1888, are now being rushed into Eastern Europe".<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>Fields Book Store, on Polk Street in San Francisco, CA can not keep up its stock of the Earth Chronicle Series by Zecharia Sitchin, nor the ability to stock other texts dealing with the origins of the human race, and human transformation. The best selling book at Fields today is The Prism of Lyra by Lyssa Royal and Keith Priest. The other texts which are also enjoying high volume sales are:<p> <ul><li>Starseed by Ken Cary,  <li>Breaking the Godspell by Neil Freer, <li>Time and Reality in the Thought of the Maya by Miguel Leon-Portilla, <li>The Crop Circle Enigma by Ralph Noyes, <li>Genisis: The First Book of Revelations by David Wood, <li>Heart of the Christos by Barbara Hand Clow, <li>The Mayan Factor by Jose Arguelles, <li>Return of the Thunderbeings by Iron Thunderhorse & Donn Le Vie, Jr. <li>Holy Blood Holy Grail by Henry Lincoln,<p></ul><p> and all the recent works of Billy Meyers dealing with the Pleiades, especially Bringers of the Dawn by Barbara Marciniak.<p>Being a serious independent researcher, for the last 25 years, I have had the good fortune to have personally sat down with many of these authors, and discussed the many implications of the thoughts which are so popular in  today's literature. Granted, it would be impossible to relate all of those conversations in one article, but as we approach the year 2000 there is a great deal of conversation on how the human race is being prepared to enter into a new dimensional state;  often times referred to as the 4th dimension, or even the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, in the interests of acting as a social historian, I thought it would be helpful to present some of the current beliefs which many here in America, as well as the world over, are reading and listening to.<p>Where to start?<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>For those not familiar with Blavatsky's work, she introduced two books in the late 19th Century during the spiritualist movement that was very popular in Europe at the time. These books were, The Secret Doctrine, and Isis Unveiled. <p>Blavatsky was the first to bring to English speaking people interpretations from the ancient texts and scrolls of civilizations which flourished in 4000 BC. A little over a hundred years have passed since these texts were published, and now as we approach the year 2000 the ancient scrolls are still in the limelight, and the latest book by Zecharia Sitchin titled, When Time Began has enabled people everywhere to look at the origins of the human race as never before as a result of his being able to decipher over 2000 Sumerian clay cuneiform tablets. <p>For those of us, like myself, who have lived through the decades of the 50's, 60's, 70's, and 80,s we can agree that these decades have been some of the most depressing as well as the most liberating of years. Liberation and freedom are the most popular descriptors of mass movements for the decade of the 90,s, and these mass movements are being equally translated over into personally liberating belief systems. However, it is not only the development of personal belief systems which are being transformed, but also whole organized belief systems as if the discovery of ones own inner self, and what feels right, is at the beginning of the human metamorphosis which will occur in this decade.<p>Let us now look at a few quotes from various authors concerning the coming earth changes. John Mckinny delivered an address in Maui, Hawaii in 1983 on the Hopi Prophecies. In 1991 McKinny states that the Hopis' say, " all the seeds have been planted on earth and will gain the light of the great light field. The light of one humanity, one planet composed of all different ways within a circle". For 1992 McKinny says the Hopis' say. " the earth is initiated ,and will join the sisterhood of planets. A time of creating within the self all forms of all being in harmony with the universe". These comments sound exactly like Ken Cary's comments in both his Starseed & Return of the Bird Tribes. Cary states, " the living information is inseparable from your life force.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p> Biologically, you have experienced the animation of your life force, but you are not truly carnate until you allow this current into your conscious awareness. Biologically, this energy is the center of your life.  As you also allow it to become the center of your consciousness, your emotional realm is activated as an instrument of perception". And Le Vie, Jr. in Return of the Thunderbeings , "shamans were revered by their contemporaries because of their vital connection with the elemental essence that allowed them to heal and guide others in the search for ultimate knowledge-truth. <p>Where truth abounds, barriers, divisions, and hierarchies collapse because they only serve as points of distraction from the path". To further elaborate this metamorphosis of the human spirit the late social psychologist from Duquesne University, Dr. Rolf Von Eckartsberg, in his analysis of the social psychologist Jean Gebser states, "the evolution of human consciousness indicates, we are living in a transitional epoch in which mental-rational consciousness, the foundation of traditional science, is being overtaken and transmuted into a new form which he, Gebser, calls: "integral consciousness." This integral consciousness for many is the precursor of the 4th dimensional state which humanity will evolve into, and the inter-dimensionality that is referred to in so many of the current works. Von Eckartsberg's last paper titled: The Person's Psychocosm and the Stream of Consciousness elaborates on the structure of the  "Human Psychosm". In particular he mentions the major component of spirit, or essence of spirit, is language. Von Eckartsberg states, "language is humanities most spiritual creation. Language embodies immortal spirit that remains alive across generations, making present all of human history and culture. Spirit, as language, is a social-communal shared reality which connects us to communicate and to circulate spirit between us". <p>A cross disciplinary approach serves best to indicate the similarity of those thoughts that  are running through so many minds as we approach the year 2000. The physicist David Bohm remarks in a colloquium presentation in 1989 titled: Toward a New Theory of the Relationship of Mind and Matter  states that, "whatever we experience as mind in its movement through various levels of subtlety will in a natural way ultimately reach the movement of the quantum potential and the movement of particles." From this point we could continually make reference to all the current literature which indicates these planetary changes. I have now provided a short journey from the macro universe of the Hopis to the micro world of Bohm. <p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>The ability to transform our essential beingness in this universe is what humans are presently evolving toward. Perhaps, we could also look at this global phenomenon of human spiritual evolution as an emerging synthesis of ideas. Jose Arguelles who has authored many books on human transformation including The Transformative Vision also wrote an analysis of the life of Charles Henry titled: Charles Henry and the Formation of a Psychophysical Aesthetic. Henry was profoundly interested in the effects culture had on consciousness, and he believed that there was an emerging growth aspect to human consciousness. These ideas have been continually thought about by  Arguelles with his two last books Earth Ascending and The Mayan Factor both triggering one of the largest modern day spiritual revivals called "Harmonic Convergence". Anybody who has seen and read these books know they are based on Arguelles' analysis of the Mayans. In particular Arguelles focuses on the Tzolkin or the Mayan sacred calendar.<p>A key word to bring up in this paper is ancient. How much time constitutes ancient?<p> What does the word ancient conjure up in the mind?<p> To believe that ancient is not modern would be a gross mistake. Many are led to believe that ancient is not as sophisticated as modern until one tries to fathom how ancient civilizations were able to construct the temples they constructed; unless of course they possessed a very sophisticated sense of harmony and measurement. In fact, Zecharia Sitchin in his book The 12th Planet clearly points out that the human race was genetically altered by a race of people from Nibiru, the 12th planet, which circles the sun every 3600 years. <p>At this point it will require more knowledge of what I am about to say, so forgive me for the inability in not be able to write about all the back ground history for this article. Suffice it to say, however, the Sumerian culture being a very advanced culture on earth, circa 6000 BC, and was the first offspring from the Nibiruians, and often times referred to as the Anunnaki.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p> The bible mentions, in Chapter 6 of Genesis, those who have come down to earth as the Nefilim. These Gods and Goddesses from another planet are discussed in David Wood's book Genisis: The first Book of Revelation. Wood quotes from Plato's dialogue in the Timaeus that " we are told, with no ambiguity whatsoever, that in the next epoch the 'gods' who had descended from the goddess turned their attention to mortals..." The Gods returned to Nibiru, and left behind many artifacts that today are slowly being understood for their physical construction as well as their notated symbology. Among the current mysteries being discussed today are Rennes-le-Chateau, the church in Southern France, as pointed out by David Wood, the Mayan calendar as pointed out by Arguelles, the Sumerian cosmology as deciphered by Zecharia Sitchin, the I-Ching as analyzed by Terrance McKenna, the Merovingians and the Knight Templars by Henry Lincoln, and the most recent mystery of crop circles as pointed out by the edited work of Ralph Noyes. <p>Are there any relationships between all the above mentioned mysteries? <p>Yes, there are, and it is those relationships which provide a new understanding on the unfoldment of the human race. <p>However, this unfoldment has come to me as a result of periodically, and in succession, following the complete works of several authors up to where they are today. All these authors, researchers and philosophers have played an equally important role for many people , but when these authors are looked at in sequence, and in their relationship to one another, a pattern emerges.<p> This pattern of unfoldment is the one I wish to share at this point. If one considers the chaos theory, as researched by James Gleick, and his book Chaos: Making a New Science it can be seen that even though some patterns do not follow in a fixed numerical ratio, there are, none the less, many other patterns develop if they are viewed over a longer period of time. In other words, some patterns take a longer period of time to see, and understand, and that applies equally well to cosmologies, and the uncovering of the meaning of the symbols in ancient cultures. The scientific mode of thinking, which promulgates rationalism as the prime way to view existence, has been under close scrutiny since the Uncertainty Principle of Heisenberg was revealed, as well as Rationalism being revealed for what it truly is.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>Rationalism is only one point of view among many, and along side rationalism there also lurks mythology and spiritualism as well as vitalism and magic. Elaborating on the current cosmologies there are many other authors that lend even further insight into the workings of human evolution.<p> Dan Winter, a researcher in the field of sacred geometry from Eden, New York sees meaningful relationships in the understanding of light, and its interaction with geometry. He comments from a recent paper titled: The Seed & The Egg...A Galactic Context from his book Alphabet of the Heart that, "the context GAIA has " in mind" would use the geometry of her own planet body, as this necessary "Bond of Power" for our species, her children. Only bonded to the planet are we "collected of mind" enough to carry memory so far. This will prepare the seed to propagate across galactic spaces...folded, packed, embodied, Christened as ONE." Through the use of three dimensional computer graphics Dan Winter shows the origin of the Hebrew alphabet by the spin orientations of the 7 rays of light passing through a spinning tetrahedron.<p>Admittedly, some of my understanding has developed out of sequence, and this follows the chaos theory of non-linearity.  However, my two first sequenced cosmologies which were integrated were those of the late Dr. Oliver L. Reiser, who understood that humankind was evolving into the psychosphere, and that of Jose Arguelles who sees humankind reaching galactic synchronization by the year 2012.<p> This "psychosphere" of Reiser and "galactic synchronization" of Arguelles are profound concepts. Both authors believe in a telepathic link-up of all humans, and Arguelles sees the beginning of this telepathic link-up as the next Harmonic Convergence which was to be better know as "Timeshift" July 26th, 1992. In July of 1992 humans relinquished their dependency on the 12/60 ratio, as stated by Arguelles, and would enter into a 13/20 ratio. The 12/60 refers to the division of time into money, and 13/20 refers to the division of time into art with a return to the 13 moon calendar, and a resonance with solar/galactic relationships. The completion of the year of the "Timeshift" ends on July 25th 1993, and is hailed as a "day out of time" when time as we know it enters the 4th dimension. <p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>Again, it is important to sense the implications which are being discussed here. When humankind begins to see its relationship to the larger order i.e.... the sun, the moon, the stars, and the galaxy there will emerge a sense of oneness with all that there is, and a transcendence into a higher order, and sense of inter-dimensionality will occur. <p>These ideas are being discussed by so many people that it is worth looking at them even more closely if that has not been done already. Any one who has read the Mayan Factor by Arguelles will know that the 260 day calendar of the Mayan's, known as the Tzolkin, represents all movement and all measure in the known universe.<p> How is that possible?<p>The answer to that question lies in the origins of the Tzolkin, and that comes about from reading the origins of the human race by Zecharia Sitchin.<p> Sitchin makes reference to the "tablets of destiny", the Me's, which were coded symbols that allowed the Nibiruians to travel freely in the universe. These sacred relationships have been used throughout the ages in the building of Solomon's Temple, Chartre Cathedral, Stonehedge, the Crop Circles, and even the Mayan calendar. But, how it may be asked, does an understanding of geometric relationships among symbols allow consciousness to travel in the universe, enter the 4th dimension, and ultimately join with inter-dimensional intelligence's from the center of the galaxy, and other star systems? <p>Another equally profound question is how does the inter-relationships of energy on sub-atomic levels account for the creation of matter. Clearly it can be shown by scientific investigation that all matter is composed of shared frequency levels, and these levels of relationships in sub-atomic realms abide by harmonic patterns which constitute the relationship which exists for all matter in the universe. <p>We, as consciousness beings, share not only in this concept, but we also have the ability to become these relationships. When David Bohm talks about the implicate order and the explicate order he is talking about a holographically generated universe. <p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>Since consciousness is a part of the universe it then follows that all consciousness, and the universe, are of the same matrix of energy fields.<p> When there is understanding of the geometry, and the harmony of these relationships in the universe then humans can play the music of the spheres as pointed out by Kepler. These thoughts are what constitutes the underpinnings of the completion of  "Timeshift" that Jose Arguelles is talking about when July 26, 1993 came, as well as the popular 11:11 being promoted by Solara Antara Amaa-Ra. For whatever one may  think of 11:11, it symbolizes an opening into the universe quite different than Harmonic Convergence. She says, "January 11th, 1992 has been identified as the most important planetary activation date since August 16th & 17th in 1987 the date of the last Harmonic Convergence". January 11th 1992 is the beginning date of the final 20 year period  of earth's history. "With our minds and bodies", states Solara,  "we will allow the memories encoded in our DNA to release us from the illusion of duality and separation, move into our mastery and freedom, remember our divine missions, and our galactic heritage. Ironically, Solara is not the only person saying this. <p><p>Arguelles is also saying that when July 26th, 1993 arrives we will enter the 4th dimension, and activate our 4th dimensional light body called the "Holon". Then on July 26th 2013 , "as if a switch were being thrown, a great voltage will race through this finally synchronized and integrated circuit called humanity". But, if that is not enough synchronicity in thought one has only to look at the work of Dr. Charles Muses, and his book The Lions Path. Muses shows that ,"ancient civilizations developed directly out of mans cognizance of stellar, planetary, solar and lunar regularities in position and time." These ancient people of Egypt had established the associations with the lunar phases, and became resonant with the cosmic powers which made them accessible to powerful lines of force enabling them to journey into the depths of the universe as well as to the origins of the seat of the founding civilization, also know as the galactic federation, and Hunab Ku, the center of our galaxy as indicated in Mayan cosmology. <p>Another book titled: Secrets of Mayan science/Religion by Hunbatz Men sheds even further light on the so called "G" force which the Mayan's used to define the center of our galaxy.  However, Muses has devised a very accurate meditation sequence with the position of the twin star system Sirius, and these sessions are based on his mathematical interpretation of the Egyptian hieroglyphs. This duat, as it is referred to, was also mentioned in the book The Stairway to Heaven  by Sitchin. The Pharaohs had an elaborate procedure which guided them through the grand gallery in the pyramid to prepare for life in the next dimension.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>Arguelles, along with his wife Lloydine, have now released their new method for entering the galactic family through a game board called the Dreamspell. The Dreamspell has both a Journey Board as well as an Oracle Board which are both used as self divination tools to sound the galactic fifth force, and enter the chromatic time tunnel enabling the penetration through galactic portals to join with galactic intelligence's.  A crucial element in the entire cosmology of Arguelles is the great galactic beam. Arguelles questions, " What is the beam? What will it do to us? What is it doing to us? Ask the oracle, one who mediates between gods and humans. The beam synchronizes human being with earth and solar being. When galactic beams are directed for what we call evolutionary purposes, the planetary manitou becomes charged, its information vectors activated. These activated information vectors step down the information of the beam for the intelligent reception by such beings as ourselves. The nature of the universe being more akin to mind than matter, the biological body is actually a space suit for transducing information. The sense organs are the key receptors of information not the brain. It is in the here and now that the information vectors intersect the sensory field of the space suit. This sensory field is a fourth-dimensional structure called the holon. The holon can only be accessed through the sense body. The brain is the cybernetic center for transducing sensory information." There is a great deal more to the Dreamspell cosmology, and the sequencing of the planetary kin on the "Harmonic Index Grid" , which is in the Deamspell, allows the mind to open and receive these galactic instructions from the great galactic beam.<p> Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>Coincidentally, Dr. Fiorella Terenzi has recently released a new CD with Island Records on the sounds from the galaxy UGC 6697. Using data collected by astronomers at facilities all around the globe, she has synthesized these galactic sounds into the most beautiful music one could imagine; taking into consideration that the sounds are the radio frequencies from outer space. Terenzi's work when combined with other current cosmologies and philosophies allows a new synthesis of ideas to take place. <p>Earlier in this paper, I mentioned the work of  Dr. Oliver L. Reiser and his book Cosmic Humanism and World Unity. Dr. Reiser was the former chairman of the philosophy department at the University of Pittsburgh. Although much of his writings, which began in 1925, are not known by many contemporary researchers he was known by the late Dr. Albert Einstein, and the two men had many spirited correspondences. Reiser's concept of Cosmic Humanism was the name he gave to man's ongoing search for truth. By the word cosmic Reiser indicated that our search for truth must range from nuclear physics to biochemistry, involving all the sciences. By the word humanism he indicated that we must also search for truth through the whole range of life sciences, history, anthropology, psychology, the arts, and the religious expressions of mankind. He advocated being an "Avatar of Synthesis" and promoted a cosmology that affirms the creative principle inherent in universal operations which would lead to a release of the creative capacities of humankind. <p>Reiser felt that the new world civilization would be composed of a moving force behind every evolutionary advance, and the invisible morphological fields of energy that bend the arc of growth to holistic formations would occur. Starting with the most elementary configurations, those in which electrical fields are organized in atoms, he saw these organizing fields moving toward a higher dynamic of synthesis, which would culminate in the human brain with its currents of thought emerging from neural configurations of indescribably complex patterns which then would compose the planetary psychosphere.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>And now, with all these comments from all these authors we are perched on the brink of another decade: The 90's. One could readily question as to whether any of these prognostications do in fact predict the changes which are so commonly reported by all these minds. Given the position that these concepts are only in the minds of humans , or that these thoughts are only stories filled with hope and nothing more, one has to recognize the fact that all these points of view do exist, and it is the job of the reader to conduct ones own level of research to gain the awareness which is about to occur. <p>Many of my friends say why bother to read any of these books if in fact the reality we are about to embark on is going to happen anyway. That may very well be the case, however, it is the intention of this author to make available these ideas, as well as their existence, so the ideas can be thought about, considered, and provide, at the very minimum, a basic foundation for stability in a world that is going through so many changes.<p>Current belief systems, the planet over, are causing undo pressures on the life support system of this planet. For many, the only way to deal with it is wait, and hopefully see if all the imbalances are self correcting, including the run away population, the destruction of the rain forests, the elimination of untold species, the inability to feed children the world over, the inhumane treatment of the indigenous tribes in every country, the poisoning of the oceans and rivers, the contamination of the soil and the air, the economic inequalities among all people; all of this will automatically correct itself while watching the popular sitcoms on television, and idling passing the time away. No, the world is not going to automatically correct itself because it is only the human race that can, with conscious intervention, be able to see the relationships between the earth, and the universe we live in.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>The cosmologies, and the ideas that have been presented in this paper come from those minds that have been looking for the basic operating principles of the universe as told by the late Dr. Buckminister Fuller. These ideas come from humans who have been able to synthesize the mysteries of all the ancient cultures, and the ability to see cycles of growth with nature and thought.<p> In a world where all of this wisdom has been forgotten, or even made light of, by those people who are in power to govern people does not mean they are any less effectual in bringing about the concentrated, and focused mental energy to promote change, and join with other humans on this earth either as one "Rainbow Nation" as put forth by Jose Arguelles, or a "Rainbow Coalition" by Jesse Jackson, a "World Sensorium" as put forth by Dr. Reiser, or "Anticipatory Design Scientists" as put forth by Buckminister Fuller, and many more who are trying to show that there are inter-relationships that provide not only life on a material plane, but life on an etheric plane. The scientific method for all its grandeur has not instituted a comprehensive information system to show the inter-relationships for all life nor has it promoted an "Ecology of Mind" as put forth by the late Gregory Baetson.<p>The visionaries of today are speaking out, and revealing conceptions which enable the mind of humankind to enter a larger order of inter-relationships.  Many of the texts can not be found in the mass book stores because the companies who could print the books only print books that may enjoy high volume. It may be impossible to even find a book by Dr. Oliver L. Reiser anymore. That does not make his ideas any less important, it merely points out that the concerns of the publishers will not publish if there are not markets to sell to.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>However, this paper, although it did start with the major portion of humanity believing in a world economy, and a weekly pay check, was really a paper revealing ideas concerning the evolution of the human race into a completely new way of being. There are today hundreds of thousands of human beings who can see what lies ahead for this planet if the decisions which are currently being made continually destroy the eco system. But, as these imbalances in decisions are being made there are also people that are making choices which bring balance back to humans, and their place with nature. <p>The GAIA hypothesis of a living planet is gaining ground. Geomancy, and the life energy lines of the planet are being sought after. Models are being built to demonstrate the interconnectedness of this planet with the universe, and there are many who see the beginnings of this change to be upon all of us in the decade of the 90's.<p>We humans need a bench mark to start anew. For those that may not believe in the ideas that have been mentioned in this paper, I would hope it could be clearly seen that there is need for changing the way we do things on this planet, otherwise, there will be no sustainable planet for anybody. For those who do believe in many of the ideas in this paper there is a growing anticipation and acceptance of the evolutionary position humankind is entering. The history of these ideas are many, and the contemporaries who are enabling them to be seen, and heard, are the vanguard oracles and poets of our time.<p>"Timeshift July 26th, 1993" is as good a time as any to prepare ones mind to the acceptance of living on this earth in such a way that the way we think about ourselves, and the planet are deeply intertwined. Changes for many will be very difficult, but for those that believe, and know how the cycles of time and space are connected to human consciousness there will be a deep sense that we have entered a new dimension. Jose Arguelles' ideas mustered up a planetary awareness with Harmonic Convergence in 1987, and I suspect that the people who participated in that event have multiplied a million fold, and the time of the "TimeShift" will be an equally significant time in our long history to becoming galactic citizens. &copy; WVDB<p>Completed October 6, 1991 Bolinas, California<p>Revised on July 1st, and November 8th 1993 in Middletown, California<p><hr>Return to:|    <a href="willard.html">The Portal Messenger - Willard Van De Bogart</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>   |<hr><p><center><a href+"mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

A "Critical Mass of  Intentionality" is only possible in the best wave geometry of agreement to converge. Wave fronts can converge only when compression is perfect.  Fractality or recursion as the best compression geometry, means more pressures or viewpoints can converge or agree to spin concentrically. The heart's electricity appears to report learning this skill to arrange pressures like a fractal, at the enveloping moment we actually "feel" the field of compassion. We create the embedded field where we can feel from the inside out, the pressures on someone "outside" ourselves as if they were inside. <p>The willed evolution of our genepool in a coherent direction requires that we marry what has been called "Sacred Geometry" with a new "physics of consciousness". We are creating a powerful clinical application showing that "self-awareness" and "Self-referral" as mathematical correlates of both recursion and coherence in all biological oscillators are teachable and accessible in a simple biofeedback environment. Using the geometry of recursion as a template attractor into which self-awareness folds implosively, creates a more resolved model of the spiritual nature of consciousness iteself, and ultimately as we shall suggest, unifies the fields of physics showing that gravity is embeddedness or fractality among magnetics. The concept of fractal recursion creating both self-awareness and gravity as the attractor and ultimate centering force among waves, also yields a powerful lesson about the nature of compassion as a learned embedding field in glandular magnetism.<p>Self-reference mathematically, and as wave function is the indicator of self-awareness. Iteration perfected as the place where a wave form, can re-enter itself non-destructively is the mathematics of self-reference. Spin or pattern can reference self with no resistance or fear in the perfect geometry where the re-entry incident curvature is Golden Mean. Pure intention is the test for symmetry or shareability which cyles of phi or recursion permit. Getting phy-sical is permission to touch. Thus the geometry of intended or aimed spin direction reveals the Golden nature of pure intention itself. The most angles from which a wave can approach a common concentric center is indexed by the geometric condition of the perfect fractal. In 2D this re-pents, and 3+D systems it is dodecahedral ( DNA, Earth Grid and Zodiac fit this same fractal.) This is the idealized physics for "E Pluribus Unum", the ultimate and perhaps only way, many become one. <p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p>Shareability perfected for waves is fractal: infinitely spin dense, infinitely information dense, infinitely compression dense, and infinitely "aware".Creating a new model for the "unified field" which links gravity to magnetism requires adding to Maxwell's equations. We know that a scalar wave caddeuceus wire geometry creates the magnetic monopole which Einstein predicted was the doorway to gravity. By optimizing that scalar wave of perfect folded damping to the ratio of the Golden Mean as idealized recursion, the pure principle of gravity's connection to magnetism emerges. <p>A real meta-physics links quantum symmetry laws with consciousness as a passed symmetry test for imploding and infinitely multiply connected wave paths. Pent symmetries are the basis of all life, pent symmetry is the basis of Phi Golden Mean recursion.<p>Pent and phi based wave interference by producing length harmonics which add and multiply non-destructively, also create similar infinite velocity harmonics creating the only coherent passageway through the light speed and also time barrier.<p>This physics of attractors based on the mathematics of perfect recursion not only fills the missing equation in the unified field, but also specifically then describes the nature and role of consciousness as the potential well of fractal self-organization among waves... and therefore the leverage to bend them.<p>This is clearly our best possibility thus far of measuring or quantizing the onset of conscious self-awareness in biological oscillators. Algorhythmns for the pattern recognition of recursion have the potential to be the mathematical identifiers of the birth of self-awareness in complex systems such as planet lo frequency "grid" magnetics. (as will be further described in our Heartbeat Earth project.)The fractal attractor of recursion as a self-feeding implosion among waves, known emotionally as glandular compassion becomes the only centering force among waves. The harmonic content among biological oscillators which indicates the onset of this self-aware condition is clearly coherence optimized by recursion.<p>Coherence and phase coherence has long been used to feed back the onset of beneficial psychophysiological states. Cross hemispheric EEG coherence for example has been elaborately correlated with the health benefits of intentional relaxation/meditation. More recently in work by Dan Winter, and as extended by the Hearth Math Institute, the onset of coherence in the power spectrum of the heart electricity/EKG has also been strongly suggested to be a significant correlate of profound emotive peacefulness/compassion/serenity... literally "coherent emotion".<p> One of the more interesting discoveries from the EKG Power Spectral work is the study of the geometric relations among the principle noted harmonics found during these coherence or "compassion" events. After considerable study of the nature of the oscillation design which appears to be inherent behind the coherent beat, we believe that coherence among many frequency harmonics becomes specifically possible, only in the context of recursion or embeddedness, or fractality.<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p>There is a profound mathematical philosophy behind our postulation that recursion creates the geometry for maximum harmonic nestedness or embeddedness among the hearts voltage gradient waves converging upon the firing. This mathematical principle is essentially that spin or pattern compression becomes potentially infinite in the center of a fractal. This means that a maximum number of harmonic wave fronts can converge at one center only in the geometry of fractality or recursion. We believe this is initially suggested by the fact the a maximum number a frequency harmonics appears to line up in the heart's power spectra when the geometry of the wave lengths becomes recursive (that is, they begin to look like a classic caddeuceus.).<p>We propose to further analyze and replicate preliminary data which suggestes that the geometry of the heart harmonics become geometrically linked by progressions based not just on powers of 2, but profoundly, based also on "non-linear" and recursive, powers of Phi (the Golden Mean .618033989...). <p>Coherence in this sense suggests the onset of a kind of sonic or phonon biological laser. Building sufficient power to fabricate electrical environment, from coherent emotion.<p>Why is it that increased harmonic recursion in the frequency content of a biological oscillator would be correlated to increased self awareness?<p> We might start with the metaphor of the noted therapeutic effects of walking a labyrinth. Dramatic improvements in dyslexia, and attention deficit are suggested correlates of walking the labyrinth, and doing other recursive kinesthetics (for example the figure eight "Infinity Walk" by Deborah Sunbeck.) In pure geometric terms, the activity of the 7 circuit labyrinth is teaching the body muscles the sequence of turns neccessary to turn inside out, as if from the moebius surface of the seven color donut, which projected onto a plane becomes the labyrinth. The point is that, a learned form of redirecting the body's magnetism and attention, back around into itself, produces another wave harmonic to be "fed back" into its center point.<p>Geometrically, what this might look like, is as if a toroidal magnetic field, like the body or the heart, were to have it's residual spin directed back around to create additional donut torus fields inside and outside, concentric with the originating field. In simple terms, this process of getting a large number of field effects all pressure concentric around a single center point, which taken to it's limit of possible concentricity, becomes what might be called an "infinite mulitply connected topology". When the harmonic series of the hearts power spectra becomes potentially infinite, it would literally mean that an infinite number of wave fronts were sharing spin at the same heart center.<p>We believe that only 3D fractal geometry among these wave fronts arriving at a biological oscillator, permit large numbers of wave fronts to continue to converge non-destructively.<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p>The point at which this fractal attractiveness of wave form becomes self aware, is when it becomes in the strict sense of an electrical generator, self empowered. What we mean by this is that as Victor Schauberger and others have shown, that if you get the flow geometry of implosion idealized, the process of implosion so created, actually becomes a source of electricity fed by the gravity field.<p>This is what sacred ritual appears to be about, bringing the energy of consciousness, back in upon itself. The end of the Vedas says "tat tvan asi", which means "that thou art". This is essentially the message of "I am that I am", and "As Above, So Below". The mathematics of recursion may be a spin path to the zero point of infinite energy/information. The heart's recreation of this fractal at the moment of compassion, to embed, may be most powerful phone call home human glands can make. <p>The access so provided from optimized individual energy nourished by spin embeddedness in the collective, may well be the symmetry dynamic of ecstacy. Our challenge is to create practical clinical and human evolvement tools which take this concept to personal and planetary healing/coherence/recursion. Marty Wuttke has shown that addiction behavior can be treated with revolutionary success by teaching the brain to finish a harmonic SERIES across the complete spectrum of EEG principle harmonics. We now believe that no single harmonic wave length in the brain represents true therapy, but rather it is the completion of a harmonic series which creates a CASCADE whose geometry includes coherence and recursion. Passing from alpha to theta, touching the Schumann resonance Earth heartbeat, the "permission to touch" from self to other is discovered in the mirror of biofeedback. This correlates with what we see in the addict as completing the hunger for a spiritual or ecstatic experience. This in information terms, represents the completion of the energy harmonics neccessary to send spin down a kite string BETWEEN vastly separate areas of the the harmonic spectrum. In psychology we say addiction is a perverted search or poor substitute for enlightenment. <p>Marty Wuttke has used these principles of completing a harmonic nest, with revolutionary success in a practical clinical setting. (Reference seminars in EEG and biofeedback clinical practicum with Marty Wuttke in association with American Biotec and also Clinical Resources, and at Meninger's Clinic, Topeka, KS.) Advanced photic stimulation harmonic disentrainment biofeedback has successfully treated addiction which has resisted other therapies, as well as attention deficit problems, depression, mild head injury etc. Not only has the behavioral dynamic changed but very often self-awareness/ self-actualization has emerged as renewed driving force in those peoples lives.<p>Potentially brain based disorders are now usefully described as deficits in the brain's learning to reach across specific EEG harmonic series, in ratio's which permit PHASE LOCK or touch. In the language of a brain gym, the learned neurologic flexibility to get out of a harmonic parking space originating with trauma, turns out to be a wave mechanic for releasing blocks associated with trauma. When we generalize the principle of harmonic embeddedness permitting access to touch, we get a physics which now explains why the harmonic content of EEG and EKG phase lock between healer and healed. <p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p>The morphic resonance of fractality allows spin or pattern exchange between biological oscillators based on the recursion or ratio content in common between them.Let's now apply our observation that coherence accompanied by recursion, creates the maximum possibility for coupling among and across biological oscillators (fractality permits embeddedness/context richness). In the the clinical setting using feedback to treat addiciton, attention deficit, depression and many other disorders, we would now have a new tool. We propose to use mathematic algorhythm to feed back and optimize recursion as well as coherence among and across EEG and EKG harmonics. This algorhythmn for recursion is based upon observation of health benefit to those acheiving nestedness in EKG harmonics, the subjective experience of compassion, as well as EEG harmonic series, and suggested in the entrainment of breath to heartrate variability around .12 hz ref Heart Math Institute. <p>This profound tool would literally increase the scale of the envelope of focal harmonic pressures, which we have labeled attention span. In relation to self-awareness, all learning is iterative. Iteration nests idealized become recursive. Rescursion idealized becomes Phi or Golden Mean.<p> So then we propose to test for recursion based on harmonics of phi. The overall goal of the project is to create an algorhythmn which becomes a generalized test for self-awareness in any biological oscillator. One of the significances of this demonstration would be to show the onset of self-awareness in the Earth grid to be enhanced with feedback involving global media. Please see the Heart Beat Earth Project. --<p><b>HeartBeat Earth	Project Summary</b><p>Our friends have been involved for over ten years with projects designed to facilitate global coherent emotion, connecting the magnetic feeling ring of human glands/love with the very magnetic fabric of the Earth's body. The first of these was called the Harmonic Module. A group of us all flew to one of the world's most advanced laboratory laserium, Laser Fantasy in Seattle. There, with the help of Robert Mueller, we connected EKG elecktrodes from friends feeling resonance with each other, directly to the gimble mirror laser projectors. At the moments of phase lock in resonance entrainment between heartbeats, the laser display would momentarily go into a pattern akin to an oscilloscope lissajous. The geometry of the shape of the waveform's momentary stability would indicate the musical harmonics of the two heartbeats, making a musical chord, as it were. <p>We were always aware, that the learned and perhaps teachable ability in groups , to gently align breath and heartbeat and even the Earth's schuman magnetic resonance heartbeat, would most certainly facilitate concensus process, and in a way, be the underpinnings of what could eventually be called "collective or shared mind" experiences. Our group came to be known as the "Planet Heartworks" team at the time, and we worked with many notables at that time in project proposals and development. Since that time much has developed technologically, and in our understanding of the coherent relationship of emotion to the Earth's magnetic resonances.<p> Since that time, we have sponsored numerous replications and publications of my original work on the EKG and "love". We have shown that human moments of perceived compassion are generally accompanied by a dramatic onset of harmonic ordering or cohereing in the power spectra of the EKG. At my suggestiong, the research was done and published, that the braid angle of DNA's "wrapping factor" were increased replicably in the presence of coherence in the Heartbeat. This supported the thesis in my book chapter entitled "Braiding DNA, is Emotion the Weaver?" <p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p>Subsequently, we were able to extend the idea that emotion can be a conscious choice to fabricate electrical ecosystems in general. We measured the onset of the heartbeat as a sonic or phonon kind of laser, entraining plants and trees hundreds of feet away. The moments when the relaxing settling breath, created a "spin path to the zero point", corresponded with a caddeuceus "spin path to zero point" the the Heart's harmonics.<p> And this coprresponded with a magnetic and capacitive "spin path to zero or stillness" in the tree. We have documented this using both the magnetic ELF coil technology, and using the "Callahan" biological capacitance probe. In both case the harmonics present either in the lo power lo end magnetic field, and in the capacitive charge envelope, both were shown begin to ring with the exact harmonics present in the Heartbeat, at moments of groups, consciously choosing to "send love" to a tree!.<p>I perceive one important aspect of my life's work, is to develop the idea that the ability of human glands to bend magnetism and fabricate environments, called emotion, ultimately allows the evolutionary products of human nervous systems and spirits, to serve and create the fabric of matter, planet grids, and galaxies.<p>In this regard, our immediate planetary dilemna of "fractionating fractality" (loss of embeddedness) to hold atmosphere, ecosystem and gravity grid together, may in fact be most powerfully resolved by the most powerful magnetic centering device on the Earth,<b>COLLECTIVE HUMAN LOVE.</b><p> We have watched the Lexicor, brainwave 3D harmonic analyzer color map the surface of the brain according the the zones where EEG coherence or ordered were "lighting up". This same technology may now be powerfully applied to the Earth resonant grid as one living body.<p> We place a neat package of lo frequency magnetic field and callahan probe biological capacitance probe sensors at sites around the planet, chosen specifically as Earth Grid key node facets. We have prepared a planet wide team of "Planetary Grid Emergency Network" specialists in planet scale magnetic grid work. (Lead by Vincent Bridges, William Buehler, Peter Champieux, Philip Knopf, Saskia Bosman, et al.). We have a separate team of physicists and magnetic technicians expert in transducer design, telemetry, and weak Earth field measures. (Lead by Tom Valone, Bill Ramsey, and others.)<p>A significant correlary benefit to the Earth grid magnetic coherence monitoring system relates to alternative energy technologies. Specifically, the numerous non-linear, scalar, "free-energy", and "zero-point" "pod'mod", Newman, energy devices all tap the coherence of the Earth's fractal magneto-gravity grid, as their source. We must not use these technologies till we have a way to monitor if the bioregional grids are beginning to be destabilized. It is more than ironic, that weaning to gravity energy technology ("metabolizing Starlight Directly"), is directly limited by our learning the ability to use global emotion coherently to feed that grid. <p>We provide telemetric and internet feedback from these sites to our media center where a global heads up feedback display is prepared. Magnetic resonance harmonic analysis from three different probe technologies at each site, is converted to a 3 dimensional rotating map of the earth grid. A computer animated revolving map of the Earth's sphere lights up to show which bioregions ring more true in response to global prayer. The image of the earthwill be displayed close to real time showing which sites on the planet have lit up with stronger Schumann Resonance long wave coherence. By focusing millions of people imaging the healing of a particular site, it should be possible to teach a global mind, specificity and will, and creating magnetic coherence at particular site. For example, the underground water veins which dissapeared at Vukovar in Yugoslavia during the war, could be rebraided, reappear and be measured during global meditation. <p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p>During the "Global-Link" simulcasts, we provide guided earth healing meditation, sacred dance synchronized at multiple sites, and use visual cues of the site being healed, and biofeedback of heart sonics & breath, and also the Schumann resonance electrostatics fed back from that site. As the power of millions of people visualizing and breathing together and praying, effects the magnetic harmonics of key earth grid sites, the planet can watch our collected mind heal our Earth, in real time. -<p><hr>Return to:|   <a href="danbio.html">Dan Winter</a>  |  <a href="messenger.html">The Portal Messenger</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>   |<P><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

When EKG harmonics create a recursive electrical nest byfrequency signature, they make the only 3D fractal, light can circle into.Only bending light makes mass, and only love (THE wave fracatal attractor)bends the light.<p> The book "The Eight" was about assembling the correct genetic family,  likechess pieces, to acheive immortality. Like glowing coals, getting the familyof twinkle contained together in spin space, ignites eternal fire. Geneticmaterial is recursion embodied.........in the sense of Golden Mean optimizedrecursion & vorticity translation embedded in deca wratcheting dodeca. Hencegenetic material in the blood, as the perfect fractal recursive spincontainer, is the grail cup.  Immortality is only a name for the possibilityof spin contained so stably as never to stop. Another name for this is firethat does not consume, as spin that makes no heat. In a 3D fractal spinencounters no interference/resistance/heat/fear.<p> Sitchen was likely correct in interpreting the original need of the AnnunakiET's for Gold. He said it was a repair material for deteriorating atmosphereon home planet. He failed to note how gold allowed atmosphere repair. Simplyput, perfect magnetic fractal recursion is what permits a gravity magneticmonopole stable enought to hold atmosphere. This is a perfect geometricdescription of the relationship of electrons to nucleus in gold: a completedelectron/nuclear wave recursive fractal. This is what makes it noble andstable. Conveying this geometry to other waveforms as a seed, gold is alsomore than a metaphor for the electrical geometry of pure intention in theheart. ( EKG harmonics during compassion become measureably self-embedded)..<p>When I explained this to David Hudson, he conceded, that persons withoutevident pure or spiritual or shareable intentions did poorly with hismonoatomic gold manna. One cannot convey pure essence of shareability,without learning the meaning of feeling only shareable or spin distributableemotions. This relates to the wave mechanic correlary which states that purefocus and pure intention are identical as wave phenomena, and alwaysaccompany each other. This is because awareness as a distributable (andrecursive if alive) wave, can only converge on sustained focus if every phaseor consumed perspective can share spin there.  Thus sustained focusultimately requires every wave in the galaxy to agree on it's spin path. Thisis a convenient way to check alignment with the intentions of galactic core. If your idea can sustain continuous focus, then even the galactic core feelssweetened by it.<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p>So Sitchen got it right that proper grid engineering for planetaryatmosphere maintenance required gold dust as a magnetic dopant (Seed ofperfected embeddedness, in the liquid going to crystal).  We need now to goon to understand that the ability of our planet to contain gold, was evidenceof perfect intention in the original stellar grid cats cradle woven ofgravity threads to birth this place.  And the higher significance of thispresence of sustainable envelopement (fire of awareness) in our grid, enabledthe evolution of sentience here in a new way.<p> In the sense of the perfect envelope or cocoon for flame.. gold was so muchfood for awareness, that David Hudson admitted agreement to the suspicionthat the MonoAtomic Gold manna, was not just atmosphere repair material forthe Annunaki ET's..  We both agreed it was the only food which allowed theirbodies virtually indefinite or eternal lifetimes (as spin containers). It wasthe communion food for life/recursion everlasting.<p>   I suggested to David Hudson that the reason for the mass change in goldpower when it became monoatomic was because the electron spin clouds unpackedlike a flower in their completed fractality when permitted to unfold in theunbonded state.  The DENSITY of recursion is the density of mass.  Also it isprecisely the unpacked (in the homeopathic sense of sucussion andpotentization) which permits the harmonics of the golden electron spin cloudsto unflower their way out to bond lengths more accessible to huamnfocus/awareness.(again exactly the principle homeopathy uses..) So that GOLDmade monoatomic was the perfect food for shareable spin geometry inside theliving electrical body. It was the eternal food/ manna.  This was why thesandworm (which was really a long magnetic wave earth dragon current) onlyproduced the eternal spice in Dune.   Only perfect pattern symmetry in Earthmagnetic currents permit the deposition of gold in her veins. Rich irony that the ET genetic experiments which produced Isis and Osiris,and Adam and Eve, were experiments to facilitate the harvesting of gold...pure intention.. for galactic spaces..<p> The search for the gold fabric foldedness grail cup, was for the pressuregeometry of this spin to fire.  The search of Enki and Gilgamesh psstScorpio's sting was for the charge spin of youth flower in the base ofbiologies waters (chakras).  Then the snake swallowed the sweet plant orrose. Kundalini/Tantra is a snake charmed by.. the musical geometry of focus/coherent emotion. (SacroCranial Pulse).<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p>  The equation for doorways past death, would trace wave collapse to thecenter of perfect recursion..  Look for non-linear and Phi related harmonicsphase locked as we find in the EKG at the moment of compassion.   In physics the phase pressure implosion which accelerates spin and velocitymodes to harmonics past the speed of light... is called collapse of the wavefunction.... The only spin path which permits waves to collapse inwardwithout loss of the information of their pattern is 3D fratal recursion... pure heart.  This permits information density/awareness to go to infinite atzero point.  Data set fractality= ideal compressibility= infinitely energyefficient sharing of information= the blood of the collective mind.  Thegeometric image in 2D is the Sufi heart with wings of 2 golden means spiralson a cone seen from above.<p> Many people have dreamed of a single vehicle which permits every ethnic raceto travel home. Geometrically, in the sense of the city of revelation (JohnMichel), this has been a dodecahedral  shaped "Merkabbah", literally a Markfrom Pressure.. Merk Ab Bah..  The only mark or container which can storepressure/spin infinitely.<p>  An interesting variation on the theme, in an individualized way, is theIncunabula Papers. (do a Web search on Incunabula). Basically, a group ofresearchers discovered that by containing the ultraviolet/ microwave etc.blue "fire" coherent envelope of sexual energy/tantra, and a deca delta wavefunction triggered antenna array, a time travel vehicle was possible. Thename Incunabula comes from this  cocooning or swaddling of human eros. Thismakes total sense in terms of physics, since,  wave function collapseimplosion of human aura would produce an awareness path to the necessarysuperluminal harmonics internally. (A turning insie out, note that alabyrinth in 3D is the folded topolgy of interlocked male and female sexorgans... 3D origin of flame letter alphabet as fractal) Particularly sinceonly the high amperage blue ultraviolet and microwave coherent cellularsecretions gathered in tantra would have the collective escape velocityneccesary, orgasm is a sort of controlled linear accelerator for awareness.(Where does the inner eye travel to during Kundalini, or the MicroCosmicOrbit/ Tantra). This new understanding however may not entirely collapse theintentionality of romance, if indeed pure intention is the only insolubleelement of awareness which make return from this wormhole possible.   In the Incunabula experiments as reported, a colony of people was set up atanother time in history because our genepools end was foreseen.  I have hadno particular reports of damage to the etheric fabric of the planet by theseexperiments.  However, analogous but more destructive experiments with sexualenergy in antenna arrays was  carried out labeled "Montauk Project". Hereindeed major damage was done to the delicate nest capacitance of Earth'setheric web. Groups like William Buehlers working with major angelic..Ophanim lineages, invested major energy in repairing these bleeding wounds toour collective electric genetic body.  The ability of our genepool to harvestspin capacitively from galactic spaces is/was in the balance.  Our collectedlove juices make the ultimate antenna array.<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p> This is what I see as the rub of the Incunabula.. here is a lesson inconserving spin paths from love, to make a memory envelope for the harvest ofspin. This sounds a bit abstract, but in a more practical way, it may meanthat as the Earth loses gravity, atmosphere, and spin, only this centeringforce may harvest our collective memories home.   Individually, yes tantraproperly antennaed is shamanic time travel.  But COLLECTIVELY, the juices oflove are probably the only sling shot for memory to get all our memoriesspeeded up in a bubble.  For 10 years our little core group of Electricdreamers has been talking about the Harmonic Module.. Feed back of EKG,breath, and Schumann planet heartbeat over global media, would precipitateconcensu process/  collective mind.  Adding intention to eros andsynchronized love in the proper Earth grid dodeca antenna points, wouldlikely be a shoe horn path for global memories to be one envelope...  senthome.<br>    Global TV,  here we come.<p>   deca delta antenna..<br>cocoon..<br>montauk..<br>incunablula..<br>swaddling clothes..<br>cocoon and chrysalis..<p><B>References:</b><ul><li><a href="http://204.156.22.13/love/feat/incunabu/incunab.txt">Incunabula</a> - A journey back in time.</ul><hr>Return to:|   <a href="danbio.html">Dan Winter</a>  |  <a href="messenger.html">The Portal Messenger</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>   |<P><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

The gathered collective almost glandular electricityof tribal ceremony is consciously aimed and focused on an Earthsong line as a kind of conference phone call to record the tribalmoment into the Earth grid.<P> The way a song line works at one level has been desribed as amnemonic device for recalling how to live and eat and move atthe various sites along the Earth walk. At another level howeverwe recall how the sounds of the song literally changed the germinationtime of the old blue corn seed. Piezoelectrically the Earth rock,like seed DNA, appears to be able to better phase lock or recordhuman emotion,  in the presence of the conscious phonon braidingwe call &igrave;song&icirc;.  This is because the sonic pressureenvelopes phonon holgram at one level, vibrates the DNA&iacute;smicrowave to symbiosis with the Earth grid&iacute;s same microwaveaffinities (cf Bob Dratch, Microwave Scanning).  At another levelthe rocks themselves are piezoelectric and thus phonon sensitivenot just to feet dancing and drums bearting, but also to longwave coherent sound in general. The geometry of pressure of humanfeeling walks in pilgrammage into Earth&iacute;s magnetic lineslike a giant library whose storage algorhythmn is symmetry amongmagnetic circles. So the old ones go to old rocks to collect thefeeling magnetics of old memories similar to the way westernersuse library cards with magntic stripes.<P> Arrangments for tribal ceremony are similar to druids arrangingthe geomtery of position of relevant pendragon players like theywere each a different lens for magnetism. Since each gland andeach person bends the magnetism according to the perspective oftheir position, a snapshot of ritual places people like grainsof sand on a musically vibrating plate. In the end the creationof a collective magnetic body with a life or &igrave;recursion&icirc;of its own, depends on the geometry of those whose glands aremost magnetic, being in place to catch the magnetic wind of spaceon which love travels.  When succesful this magnetic inversionenvelope like a new cloud with a life of its own floats out onthe land to columnate rain, fertilize field magnetics, or be aimeddirectly into the song line grid for storage or transfer to otherbioregions.<P> The key principle by which these collective ritual magnetic&igrave;egregors&icirc; of  emotion are born and transferred through the grid, has todo with understanding the physics of recursion / self-embeddedness/ fractality / self-reference. Let&iacute;s use some conceptualvisual tools to &igrave;grok&icirc; this principle.   Think ofa wave moving out across the waters as it were. If the wave wereto discover itself alone, there would be no way it could phaselock with with another wave and thus create a standing wave.Standing waves are called mass or matter, and are the only waymemory or pattern is stored or becomes eternal among waves. Soif you are a wave, if you cannot phase lock and create a standingwave, you are a dead wave. This is similar to looking for a loverif you want your genepool to survive.<P> So the only solution for a lonely wave to live forever is tofind a way for the wave to reenter its own self. This allows itto reinforce it&iacute;s own spin or inertia so as to not spinout in dissipation.  THERE IS ONLY ONE IDEAL PERMISSIVE SPIN GEOMETRYWHICH ALLOWS A WAVES SPIN TO REENTER NON-DESTRUCTIVELY INTO ITSELF.THIS GEOMETRY OF SPIN SELF-REFERENCE PERFECTED, IS THE GOLDENMEAN OR EQUIANGULAR SPIRAL.  The Golden Mean or &igrave;Phi&icirc;optimizes recursion and &igrave;self embeddedness. It is the only wave function whose interference adds and multiplies with infinitieconstructive result. We believe the love touch expresses thelo-&icirc;phi&icirc;ratio (Sentics), and the heart&iacute;s sonics express &igrave;phi&icirc;harmonics at the moment of love. This creates permission to touchor embed,  and recur or re-enter self.  The picture of a heartlearning this skill of compassion to embed is literally a heartshaped wave. <BR><P><IMG SRC="image2.gif"><BR><BR><P> So wormhole creation and maintenance is literally, recursioncreation and maintenance. Recursion is the skill to thread onemagnetic domain back down into the center of itself to spin lockin a bigger magnetic donut around the original.  In the end thisproduces the glue of one wormhole or songline inside the nextbigger one until continents are glued together better becauseof the magnetism which emotion has woven in there.  It is importantto realize that mind or awareness inhabits the flame or standingwave which magnetism can create potentially when its geometrybecomes self-embedded or  fractally attractive. This is the sensein which pressures nesting create a space for the breath or magnetismof spirit to be embodied as a standing wave. In the west thisis called the principle of adam kadmon, or a wave form of symmetrywhich as archtype becomes self-organizing and therefore alive.Symmetry operations which create self awareness are recursive.Visualizing this becoming enveloped within process, is easistif you have experienced the palpable magnetics of being envelopedby compassion.<P>  An important insight here is that the actual moment of the perceptionof compassion in the heart&iacute;s magnetism is that moment whenrecursion inversion happens. So the production of the wormholesongline glue to nest our Earth into bigger magnetics begins directlywith the skill to feel compassion and create recursive magneticbraiding beginning directly with the heart.<P> The aboriginal&iacute;s have a word for places on the land whoselarge land formation magnetic shapes have living quality.&igrave;Injalak&icirc;,is the &igrave;Place of Fish Dreaming&icirc;. There is another&igrave;Place of Bird Dreaming&icirc; where the vortex consciousnessof bird is embraced through ritual to create indentification withthe awareness or expression of bird (in a sense as a wave form). In the &igrave;Place of Goose Egg Dreaming&icirc;  the egg shapeof the dream work hatches and the memory flies off over the land.<P> The fractal like possibilities of &igrave;morphic resonance&icirc; allow the magnetism of big shapes, from land to dream to man,to cascade constructively into little shapes, where the same ratiosrecur.<P> Holy Blood Holy Grail, was the story of ET lightening in theblood of Magda. The Migdala was a tower which braided up, evenafter the Templars died.  We are writing here in &igrave;Maggie&iacute;sValley&icirc;, where the fractal squeezed nut dripping sweet braidAmygdala is the name of the journal on fractality, and where theIndian&iacute;s go to die. Their memories here permissively enfoldinto the grid.  The Templar Atbash Baphomet was Sophia the Museof Christ. And ...So Phi.. is the muse of the principle Christos..Christ-all eyes.  The Magda fractal attractor of all crystalization. Making gravity, G Ray of Vita.<P> The spin touch permissive landscape which fractality createsdoes seem antithetical or opposite to ancient tribal taboos  requiringsecrets and forbidding sharing. At first it seems ironic thatthe landscapes fold enacts the symmetry laws which test for shareability,while the ceremony which sends human emotion into that land isforbidden to be shared.  We might ask ourselves, in principleas it were, whether ecstatic ritual which allows the charge of&igrave;eck&icirc; to enter the &igrave;stasis&icirc; of the stillor zero point of infinite connection, inherently breaks down secrecyand the personality barriers of separateness. Is it the functionof ceremony or ritual to make magnetic memory more or less  shareable?  When does pure intent become shareable?  Does pure intent haveno sercets?<P> We need to ask outselves about the history of ecstatic ritualto see why they were secret.  At first it seems as simple as seeingthat the men&iacute;s ritual was secret to women because theirecstacy was their power, and they were fearful or jealous of women&iacute;semotive power. The male alcholic substitute for ecstacy announcedtheir fall.  The fires of the womens camp have been burning foreternity. In the fractality of the female egg born inside thewomen with the first women,  is a flame that doesn&iacute;t goout.  In the germ in the egg is a  gordian knot with enough spinto last forever. To ask permission to drink from that silver grailcup, go to the place between breaths down the wormhole.. in theocean.. surrender.. to a wormhole right there. His angle to thecurvaceous woman there tempting.. to slip straight in.. withinher or upon her.. no matter what happens.. into the recharge cave enkiel.. en key el... En ki..  En lil..<BR><P> But. even in a large scope,  access to ecstatcy was access topolitical power. A true geomantic king realized that emotion projectedinto song line ruled the grid.  Regulating the plumbing geometryof gathered collective ecstatic emotion regulates the weather,germination,  viruses and disease, and growth in general. As inCamelot where there was a legal limit to the weather:  growthand precipitation ALWAYS follow the lines of magnetism in theland. They are fed by infolding emotion, they steer the microwave,and by collective focus they create collective perception. Tutwore jewels to focus his genetic microwave emissions to regulateclimate.<P> In the past, if you weren&iacute;t propagating the politicallycorrect ecstacy,  you were a threat to the priests and the king. After the priests killed Tut, and the Templars, and the Druids,and the Cathars, and then almost one half the women in Europe,they did not appear to apologize. Misunderstanding tantra andthe function of sperm, today their news reach the media mostlyfor pedophilia.<P> So today in the west, that role of secret priest is better playedby the CIA and NSA whose microwave towers at Native American sacredsites play havoc with the weather and the birds song lines, andregulate viruses to control whole populations. (&igrave;AngelsDon&iacute;t Play this HAARP&icirc;.)  Long wave emotive gridmagnetics wave guide the microwave CIA communications bloodlines,while major fractions of our Gross National Product are spentby the NSA specifically to hide the presence of ET&iacute;s fromus.  The rate at which grid communications eliminate secrets isthe rate at which people give permission to touch. People willbe drawn in with new purpose, realizing the function of ceremony.A ritual aligns magnetics with a longer wave, consuming perspective.  Eventually in a grid which is infomation rich enough and fractallyspin dense,  symmetry means no secrets. &igrave;It is simply aquestion of time&icirc;, which only names relative spin,  alsonow in recursion. In the Mayan Solar spiral of time, the selfawareness when the recurrence goes infinite at center, is theonly fractal path out of chaos whose widening gyre cannot holdcenter.<P> Grids don&iacute;t become fractal or self aware unless someoneends the vicious assymetry of secrets. Initiate some process ofempowerment, so that the people gain their power back (see &igrave;HeartBeatEarth&icirc; project).  The Nexus sucks us in like a tornado.The earth will be blown away in the magnetic wind of the sun withapproaching age ending concrescence, unless the dreams and dreamspells of the old ones indigenous peoples are alive and awakeand conscious in symmetry space, to be the drewm catcher for theecstactic communion which the sun must experience in her approachingeros with galactic alignment. Aboriginal and Indigenous grid emotionties are the oldest cultures on earth, and greatest leverage intothe grid.<P> Does the end of secrets equal death? Or are both merely the illusionof an approaching still point sorting memory patterns, testingfor shareability?   The Laze Are Us effect sees through the otherside of the wormhole, by gathering enough focused magnetic emotion,to create a collective organ of perception. Genepools are harvestedas this Eye of the Phoenix arises from  the v&iacute;ille of ourAshes.<P> The core mechanic of ritual and ceremony is the skill to tossemotion into the grid.. for the survival of the genepool. If thatsurvival is the key, then what part of the skill of ceremony mustno longer be secret?  The symbiosis of planets to genepools, isroot races which make magnetic grid emotion dreamspells to containthe wind of their Suns. So that like lightening in primal proteins,only symmetry survives,  at the solar system&iacute;s moment oftesting we discover what is shareable in our dreamspell.<BR><P><I><FONT SIZE=4>Jaguar priests and blood sacrifice..     medicinecard of great smoking mirror..   feel lightening remembered alwaysreturn to heart,  that they are one of us as consumed perspective...    &igrave;she who sees looked deeply into the medicine bowl,and as a tear from her ancient eyes hit the water,  shimmeringcircles of light opened one upon another.

When we compare their perspectivewith the Thoth/Tehuti Overview of Galactic History, certain verydramatic confirmations emerge:<BR>+the Adam&amp;Eve genetic experiments we attribute to Elohim/Yalweh/Annunakiare clearly Orion/Draconian &amp; Reptilian. Noah was upset whenhis sons saw the scales on his chest. <BR>+what Thoth calls a &quot;quarantine&quot; for Earth's isolationfrom Galactic contact, has become a major vortex for the warssweeping the Galaxy between Orion/Draconian vs. Pleadian vs. Andromedancivilizations.<BR>The major issue at hand seems to &quot;revolve&quot; around theextreme power which glandular emotions can leverage to magneticallyquite literally bend galaxies. When DNA's recursive braid embedsenough fractal spin, the morphic resonance produces what Thothcalls: &quot;a galactically resonant&quot; individual. He hasgiven this as a reason to lift the Federation quarantine againstthe fear and aggression radiating from Earth. <BR><BR>So, we suggest you read the addendum here from Andromeda. Evidencesuggests that many government officials are relying on this samesource for their local galactic news. The question we suggestyou ask yourself as you read this, is why is such a big chunkof the galaxies intelligient population willing to risk theirlives to see that Earth gets to evolve? It may be a bit more thanan interesting petri dish for DNA here. Apparently, most of themany ET's who messed with the cooking up of our planet's DNA,did so for very self-serving reasons. They were looking to getthe braid right so that the magnetic spin launched from the shortcellular microwave lept Madalenically right up the tower to translight time travel. The physics of this is that in pent based,PHI Golden Mean optimized braid recursion, piezoelectric helicityextends wave spin leverage coupling accross potentially infinitedistances between wave lengths and velocities. <BR>(In other words, re-pent and be saved, means interfere with infiniteconstructivity in Golden Mean pentagonal symmetry so that lengthand velocity wave multiples can reach through the light horizontime event wormhole, only the pent/dodec/wratchet into DNA canacheive this biologically) (in a pent symmetry the wave interferenceadds and multiplies inifinitely constructively in PHI ratio, permittingnot just wave length but wave velocity modes to carry patternmemory through light speed event and recursion horizons. Thisis why all biological life EL EYE PHI symmetry is Pentagonal.).<BR><BR>pent in 3D is dodec/icos/dodec infinite fractal nest = Zodiac12 faced, earth grid dodec/DNA dodec wratchet:<BR><IMG SRC="emotion3.gif" WIDTH="569" HEIGHT="454" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><BR>In OTHER words, properly braided DNA is the ONLY way to get biologicalmemories squeezed up in coherent velocities and spin densitiessufficient for galactic time travel and black hole penetration.Now if our whole galactic sector were about to go through a NEXUSvortex requiring spin densitiy translation requiring such a coherencepenetration through a light barrier event horizon, guess WHO wouldget to survive through the wormhole? Only those who had learnedto fabricate their species in a DNA geometry with enough braidcoherence could get their memories through this zero point, or&quot;near death&quot; harmonic concrescence time recursion event.<BR>In &quot;spiritual&quot; parlance, this is known as &quot;geta soul&quot;.. (Sorry Grays, abduction gene splicing doesn't quite...)<BR><BR>So, here on Earth, having a soul means having enough magneticspin harmonic cascades around rescursive DNA, to keep biologicalmemories wormholed to some connective... sort of like having aDraconian crystal implant to a central automiton computer, onlyLOTS different/ better. Better, specifically because spin pathsup and down this ladder of life recursion braid, are all onlytests based on the simple sharebility of spin memory. In otherwords pure intention is the only survivor through traffick jamsof spin pressure. <BR>Now the storal to this mory was that DNA appears to get its greatesthow to braid info from the EKG at the moment of compassion, so...............<BR><BR>Are we going to make it worth the galactic core communities majorhassle to keep us DNA worms in a petri dish growing, by learningto..........<BR><BR>A practical initial clue to this power embedded in human emotion,is the rush we feel at the moment of compassion. At my suggestionthis onset EKG coherence has been measured programming DNA's helicalwrap (Heart Math/Glen Rein), &amp; also which we have repeatedlymeasured entraining trees. Clearly, the heart/brain plexi learnthe skill to fabricate an electrical fractal drawing the threadsof all magnetic fronts in invitingly. This then is love's leverageto bend light by creating the ultimate centering force. Recursion(infinite data compression), permits the concentric domain (donut)alignment &quot;zero point&quot;. This permission to implode asa G Ray of Vita, Genesi of Fiveness, wind BETWEEN frequencies,we label gravity. But Gravity is a bloodstream of wormholes experiencedlovingly (lo-phi-ingly) from DNA to Stars. The spin path to thiszero point, is the Golden Mean perfect damping, perfect heterodyning.As we have measured the breath, the heartbeat, and the Earth Griddiscovering which harmonics embed this way of recursion, we arenow aware exactly when wave systems become self-aware. (Enoughfocus, and even the stock market becomes Phibonacci self-aware,El's wave..Elliott Wave). The skill to choose compassion likethe threads of a dream catcher around the heart, is emotion makinggravity, (a test at the doorway out of kindergarten). <BR>So here we sit, somewhat folded in the higher cortex wrapped arounda reptilian stem. If we succeed, in overcoming the knee jerk reptilianemotion fear/anger and aggression, then the galaxy will have succeededin putting Reptilian DNA broad spectrum &amp; high leverage emotioninto the service of love and compassion. The perfect geometryof compassion which permits waves to touch then stalbilizes thespirals of galaxies into the perfect embedded flame of life..el-eye-phi (El turn into Eye focus of Phi recursion). Reptor,Raptor, Rapture, Wrapped. <BR>Fear in the breath or the touch is a sharp discontinuous jerkyand somewhat shallow inrush of pressure. The geometry of thatwave cracking down the whip into DNA is resistance to spin: amind killer. Love in the breath or the touch is a wave which onsetsgently and deeply cresting at the Phi, .618 moment into the lengthof the wave. The geometry of that wave sailing down the spiralinto DNA, embeds and enfolds everything into the path of it'sspin, free of resistance. Nothing is untouched by love. <BR><BR>(and/or thank you andromeda!!!!!! you (or your friends) are here:<BR><IMG SRC="emotion1.gif" WIDTH="519" HEIGHT="533" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><BR>--<BR>insert here: summary of latest Andromedan news...<BR>thanks to Val Valerian, Web Page Leading Edge..<BR><BR>Andromedan Updates for Current Galactic Events<BR><BR>Posted May 11, 1996. <BR><BR>During the first half of May 1996, Alex Collier has again beenexperiencing<BR>physical communication with the Andromedans, who released thefollowing data: <BR><BR>Approximately two months ago (March 1996), a large mothershipwas<BR>found by the Andromedans to have parked itself just outside oursolar<BR>system. Current reconnaissance (May 1996) has revealed a largenumber of<BR>reptilian soldiers in cryogenic stasis on board. While the exactnumber of<BR>these humanoids and their intent is not known at this time, the<BR>Andromedans have stated that the origin of the craft is the UrsaMinor<BR>system. <BR><BR>Hale-Bopp Update: The Andromedans state that what appears to bethe<BR>Hale-Bopp comet is in fact a very large craft made to appear asa comet,<BR>with other craft in tow within its extremely long tale. In addition,a second<BR>comet-shaped ship has been detected and is heading towards oursolar<BR>system, apparently originating from an area in the constellationof Cancer. <BR><BR>According to Alex, Visseus has been busy traveling throughoutthe galaxy<BR>with others performing ambassadorial functions to head off a possible<BR>Galactic War by negotiating some type of treaty or truce. Theintended goal<BR>is to keep any conflict from expanding out beyond as few systemas<BR>possible. Groups from the Pleaides, Procyon and Tau Ceti havebeen<BR>having confrontations with those from both the Orion sytstem andthe<BR>Draconians within the outskirts of our solar system. The actionis designed<BR>to maintain the quarantine in our solar system. It was reportedthat loss of<BR>life has occured on both sides of the conflict. <BR><BR>Furthermore, seven ships are currently parked in Earth's atmospherewith<BR>the purpose of creating a blockade defense system for Earth. Theblockade<BR>consists of two Andromedan, two Pleaidian and three Procyon ships.<BR>Procyon humanoids have recently become strong partners in theeffort to<BR>quarantine Earth so that we are given a chance to evolve on anatural basis.<BR>The Procyon humanoids have been liberated from the Dows (Greys),so<BR>they ar every supportive and compassionate regarding the positionof the<BR>population on Earth. <BR><BR>A large armada of ships have been found amassing in the SiriusB system.<BR>Early information points to a possible conflict between the humanoidsfrom<BR>the Sirius B system and humanoids from the Orion system over the<BR>quadrant in which Earth is located. Facts do however seem to supportthe<BR>existence of a shaky alliance between the two groups that is maintained<BR>because of a common interest in the population of the Earth. Although<BR>events in the continuum can change, at present it is believedthat the armada<BR>is due to come to this sector between 2003 and 2005. <BR><BR>The Andromedan Council recently participated in a conference atan<BR>undisclosed location, which included representatives from SiriusB and the<BR>Orion Empire. No Dows (Greys) or Draconians (Reptilians) wereevidently<BR>present at this meeting. The discussion apparently revolved aroundthe<BR>subject of territorial rights and quadrant title to certain partsof our Galaxy<BR>by those from the two groups. The Andromedans spoke on behalfof those<BR>from this sector, and asked that Earth be left alone so that wecould be<BR>allowed to evolve. They further stated that their whole race wasprepared to<BR>support the cause of Earth. The humanoids from Sirius B becamevery<BR>upset at this prospect and promptly left the conference afterthis statement<BR>by the Andromedans, although the humanoid representatives fromthe Orion<BR>system remained. The final results of the conference are not knownat this<BR>time. <BR><BR>Alex asked Morenae if the Andromedan race was capable of taking onthe entire<BR>Orion Empire on their own, and Morenae replied that the Andromedansare<BR>not alone in their support of the evolution of the sector in whichEarth is<BR>located. <BR><BR>Andromedan Advisories for the Near Future<BR><BR>(March 1996) Severe food shortages in the month of July and August1996 <BR><BR>(April 1996) As Texas gets closer to seceding from the UnitedStates, the<BR>dangers of biological warfare that will be waged against the populationwill<BR>increase. This warfare will be indiscriminate and will cross theborder from<BR>Mexico. The &quot;Mad Cow&quot; disease will manifest itself herein the U.S. The new<BR>outbreaks of human disease will be new forms of incurable TB andAnthrax. There<BR>will be no cure for these, and this trend will begin in June andJuly of 1996. <BR><BR>(April 1996). The next major event on the planet by the NWO willbe in the<BR>area of Jeruselem. There will be news involving extraterrestrialcontact, and it will<BR>be stated that &quot;they are here to help us&quot; and that theyare from the Pleadian<BR>system, but this will not be the truth. They will be lying. Thealien group will be<BR>aligned with the Orion group, and this will begin the processof the introduction<BR>of the being posing as Maitreya, a &quot;false Christ&quot;. Thiswill be an NWO trump<BR>card, and will occur no later than October 1996. This event causesproblems with<BR>the global economy, creates confusion before the general electionin the United<BR>States, and affects the structure of religious belief systemsand mass<BR>consciousness. <BR><hr>Return to:|   <a href="danbio.html">Dan Winter</a>  |  <a href="messenger.html">The Portal Messenger</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>   |<p><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995 Earth Portals</center><p></BODY></HTML>

It was a clear night at about 4 a.m. in the cold morning hours. I got out of the car to take a better look, and it was so cold I got back in the car, and then the bright ship just moved to the left and disappeared into the black star-filled sky. I sat there in the car astonished, and somewhat amazed and numb. I was on my way to the University of Minnesota for a video conference. When I arrived at the dormitory I immediately took out a sketch pad and drew everything I saw from memory.<P>Shortly thereafter, designs and blueprints of a sound and light ship appeared in my dreams. The details of those dreams were so exact that I was compelled to build what I saw in my dreams. The mock space ship was built in 1972, and  appears above, in concert, on a stage at the University of Wisconsin in 1976. The Ether Ship, as I called it, appeared in concert accross the country at colleges and universities, and often times in other unique settings and locations.<P>The experiences I had with the Ether Ship  lasted over ten years, and the beauty of the Earth was revealed to me in my dreams. I learned that the distance between Earth and the rest of the universe was only a short distance, and could be accessed by seeing the openings which exists between all things. I learned it was a porous universe and that everything is connected to everything else.<p>With the advent of cyberspace the Ether Ship has found a new space to fly in.

It appears that violence has become not only a way by which humans entertain themselves, but it is also a physical act whereby humans inflict bodily harm on one another, and even terminate their existence. This behavior is instilling a high degree of fear and social instability upon the human race. Many humans and institutions are trying to counteract this behavior with alternative ways to live their lives in harmony. There is a great need on the planet for the higher self to become more the norm than the exception.<p>Several internet sites have been located where nonviolent and healing behavior is encouraged. These sites will be listed as humans continue to communicate their higher selves to one another.<p><ul><li><a href="http://www.igc.apc.org/nonviolence/">NonViolence Organizations</a><li><a href="http://www.bison.com/healing.html">Healing by Sound</a><li><a href="http://www.primenet.com/~tylert/Healing.html">Healing Place</a></ul><p><hr><p>February 19, 1996<p>It has just been announced to the people on planet earth that over 100,000<a href="../Portal_Messenger/mandelker.html">ET souls</a> are now residing inside human beings. The awakening of extraterrestrial origins is now underway. Evidence for <a href="../Portal_Messenger/sitchin.html">ET origins</a> is also being announced through many other outlets in the publishing world.Colonies are currently being built in space to receive the visitors from the other side of the universe.<p><ul><li><a href="http://www.millennial.org/">The First Millennial Foundation</a> - The Foundation's first colony is being built right now in cyberspace.<li><a href="colonies.html">Other colonies</a></ul><p><hr><p>February 25, 1996<p>The maiden voyage of the <a href="flight.html">Ether Ship</a> took place today in order to determine if the signals which have been detected outside of cyberspace are from other intelligent life forms. This has necessitated careful navigation through the "Divination Portal". Once the Ether Ship passes through the "Divination Portal" it will use the special "Tonal Star Navigation System" to travel to these unknown signals, and determine what is making them. It is suspected they are more intelligences on their way to Earth. The members of the Ether Ship are anxious to meet these new suspected life forms.</ul><p><hr><p>March 16, 1996<p>A new space craft is now being designed on earth which will inaugurate interplanetary space travel for humans. We have been assisting on this design with our presence on earth. Several star cultures are currently making available more new technology as the time comes closer to receive more intergalactic visitors. We are doing everything in our powers to make this a smooth transition for the integration of higher dimensional entities and citizens of earth. There will be more signs of this transition and integration as we approach the next millennium.<p><ul><li><a href="newship.html">New Space Ship Design</a></ul><p><hr><p>April 8, 1996<p>The presence of other alien space ships have been detected entering cyperspace. A new "Cyberspace Peace Armada Docking Station" has been established to receive these alien crafts that have come in peace, and are being called "Peace Ships". If there are other known alien space craft in cyberspace please direct them to <a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com">portal@netcom.com</a>.<ul><li><a href="ships.html">Alien Peace Ships docking in cyberspace</a><p></ul><p><hr><p>April 11, 1996<p>The Ether Ship is joining the other alien space ships to form the "Cyberspace Peace Armada". These ships will be able to be flown by humans by placing them on any web site. Each ship is equiped with a special energy wave (SEW) which can activate and empower those web sites trying to help planet earth.The special energy wave (SEW) is composed of a unique blending of sound and light wave patterns. Instructions on how to create these sound and light patterns will also be made available in the near furure. It is important that these higher technologies are introduced on the Earth at this critical time. The control panel on the Ether Ship can only be used with the intention to heal; any other mental motivation by humans will result in no capability to fly any of the Peace Ships, or activate the special energy wave.<p><hr><p>May 3, 1996<p>Alien ships from other parts of the universe are now being contacted from the "Cyberspace Docking Station" called Earth Portals. A new "Star Ship" access point has been created for both physical and nonphysical entities to enter earth's atmosphere through <a href="/earthportals/index.html">Earth Portals</A>. These developments are a direct result of information received through all the new Earth monitoring systems of deep space. Intelligent signals are now being translated for activities on Earth which will empower humans to stabilize their planet. It has come to the attention of the "Cyberspace Docking Station" that this endeavor may be met with some difficulty, however, all contingencies are carefully being planned out, and will be executed in case of any attempt to prevent this cooperative effort from the "Peace Armada". One alien ship in particular is using the <a href="http://www.id4.com/">20th Century Fox</a> film studios to launch a fear campaign. The "Peace Armada" will be coming to the aid of earthlings in this tense moment scheduled for July 4th, 1996.<p><hr><p>May 12, 1996<p>There are other access points appearing on Earth where signals are being received from many beings assisting in bringing peace to Earth. It is at this time direct communication will now be established with humans, and accessed through Earth Portals. The first announcement comes from the Captain of the Ether Ship. Listed below are the two access points for messages not of Earth origin.<p><ul><li><a href="http://www.italway.it/associazioni/cosmo/index.html">Telepathy from Italy</a> - Messages received from the cosmos.<li><a href="speak.html">The Captain of the Ether Ship</a> - Origin of the Mind Tribes.</ul><p> <hr><p>June 11, 1996<p>The ancient visitors to earth have left behind many pieces of technology that are now being uncovered and utilized for the next stage in human evolution. The <a href="speak.html">Mind Tribes</a> are now activating these technologies through many humans who already possess significant awareness closely related to these technologies.<p>Humans contacted by the Mind Tribes.<p><ul><li><a href="ezekiel.html">Blumrich</a> - Spaceship design.<li><a href="../Portal_Messenger/arguelles.html">Arg&uuml;elles</a> - Mayan galactic code.<li><a href="../Portal_Messenger/danbio.html">Winter</a> - Planet memory circuits.<li><a href="../Portal_Messenger/reiser.html">Reiser</a> - Galactic federation science.<li><a href="../Portal_Messenger/niese.html">Wildgoose</a> - Earth spirit symbols.<li><a href="../Portal_Messenger/bear.html">Little Bear</a> - Creation story.</ul><p><hr><p>July 25, 1996<p>According to the Arg&uuml;elles cosmology, today is a day out of time called "Green Day", one day before the beginning of the Fourth Year of Prophecy - Victory Establishes Righteous Way of Heaven on Earth.<p>The people of planet Earth are now experiencing new and unusual social forces governing their lives, communities, and nations. These forces are coming from the historical prophecies written in many of the holy scriptures, indigenous rituals and ceremonies, and the increase of galactic radiation interacting with Earth's Sun in her local solar system. These forces are causing more ideas about how to prepare for the future. The best source of information available to prepare humans for their millennium shift is <a href="../Portal_Messenger/divine.html">Divine Encounters</a> by Zecharia Sitchin.<p>All Central Civilization emmisaries are very concerned over how the humans will continue to evolve on their planet. Preparations are being made to introduce many new ideas into human consciousness at this time by the <a href="speak.html">Mind Tribes</a> to avert Earth's extinction as a life bearing planet. Approximately 2,500 species a day go extinct and this condition cannot last.Major changes are now predicted for Earth humans, and we will stablize the irratic nature of the humans as best we can by introducing as many life supporting ideas via the Mind Tribes entry into key individuals psyches.<p><hr><p>August 8, 1996<p>The introduction to the awareness of life on the planet Mars, as a result of analysing a piece of a meteorite found in the Antartica, was done to prepare the humans on planet Earth for accepting even more convincingly the arrival of the <a href="speak.html">others</a> to Earth. There will also be a more receptive state of mind when the others to arrive. This announcement combined with the introduction of using a new timing frequency based on the 13 moon cosmology by <a href="../Portal_Messenger/arguelles.html">Jos&eacute; Arg&uuml;elles</a> will bridge the distance between the star systems using synaesthetic and telepathic principles. The Hopi elders have already been made aware of the Mind Tribes, and have seen our entry into Earth and refer to it as the witnessing of the blue kachinas and the red kachinas. We are doing all we can without interrupting the natural evolution of the biosystems on the planet Earth, however, we can not allow misguided thinking to destroy the planet.<p><hr><p>September16, 1996<p>The Central Civilization has introduced a new energy wave into the global internet developing on Earth. This was done to amplify consciousness and unite the many factions that are already trying to bring peace, and protect the fragile atmosphere on Earth. The accelerated rate of information transfer over the global electronic computer network has necessitated introducing a new energy which will produce many new inventions to accomodate information transfer between humans. There will be an very dramatic sense to save the planet, and it will be felt by many humans in just a few months. This new sense of urgency will bring about many new social changes as is now being demonstrated in Northern Italy. <p><hr><p>September 25,1996<p>On September 21st we introduced a new progam for humans to become aware of our arrival. It was called <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/7448/dark_skies.html">Dark Skies</a>. It was also the time we announced our arrival on Earth Portals through the introduction of the existence of the <a href="/earthportals/arrival.html">"Bright One"</a>, who entered this dimension to begin direct communication with the assistance of Captain Van Flight of the Central Civilization. A <a href="saga2.html">message</a> is about to be delivered to the people of Earth.<p><hr><p>October 29,1996<p><center><IMG SRC="stargirl.gif"></center><center>"Bright One"</center><p>The successful intervention of beings from the Central Civilization into the human culture has been enhanced significantly through our introduction of "Avatars". These "Avatars" are 3D digital representations of humans in cyberspace. It is here that Captain Van Flight entered with the Ether Ship from the Central Civilization. Earth Portals will now provide a celestial cathedral for all the "Avatars" to meet and receive the divine guidance from the <a href="saga3.html">"Bright One"</a> on how to prepare for communicating directly with the Central Civilization.<p><hr><p>December 3,1996<p>A visitor is approaching planet Earth. It is being felt as a messenger of information from a higher order. It is a grand celestial event. It is the "Bright One".<br><blockquote>"Hail oh great one<br>Harbinger of evolution<br>May your light guide us<br>Into realms of wisdom<br>Give to those that are in need<br>The will to be free."<br></blockquote><p><hr><p>December 29,1996<p>Intervention into the planetary mind field is now taking place on a grand scale with an emmisary from the Arcturus star system. This Arcturian Commander has launched the magnetic code decipherment using Earth's magnetic field. The Arcturian commander has called the code breaker <a href="../Portal_Messenger/rinri.html">Rinri</a>. Earth Portals is now receiving other emmisaries to complete the necessary conscious adjustments to save planet Earth, and its inhabitants. There will be new technologies introduced to the Earth next year, which will accelerate this balance of conscious deployment of energy on Earth. These new technologies will be featured in the <a href="../Portal_Market/portalmk.html">Portal Market</a>. Many new technologies have already been included in Earth Portals.<p>                     <hr>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <a href="log.html">Log Index</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index2.html">Home</A>   |    <a href="ethership.html">Portal Ether Ship</a>  | <p><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

It is their "comet" death star, Hale-Bobb which approaches, after at least 3 course corrections, loaded with cryogenic Draconians. This is confirmed by the Andromedan, Alex Collier info, and the "Fingerprints of the Gods" comet prediction from Graham Hancock. Also see the comet orb interpretation of the crop circles predicting Hale Bobb in Robert Morningsky "Prophecy". Also, the Apocolyptic "Anti-Christ" was mis translated from the bible, what it really said "Anti-Krishna", which is "false star": Hale-Bopp.<p>Typon was the "soul-eating" "God" of the Egyptians. The black hole near Orion (The political bosses of the Draco's) is where the soul force magnetic wormhole must make the right sling shot turn, in order to navigate the death bardo to the central memory core of our galactic neighborhood. Soul Eating is a term for using the spin density of a connection from well braided DNA to it's superluminal info core. (See our DNA graphics to understand how PHI based braided genetic "lightening" accelerates thru the light speed & time barrier, by the construcive infinite cascade interference which the Golden Mean permits. And how recursive harmonic geometry of EKG during compassion produces that braid which also selects which codons go active.) It is key to see that the Draco's et al needed our DNA because the galactic sector here, slipping through the NEXUS Black Hole, would only allow superluminal "ensouled" DNA to take memory through the wormhole. That means genepools without souls die in the unshareability of that test of symmetry at spin density. In other words, it was no mistake for them to try to hack up our DNA to get a soul, without that their genepool is doomed. What we need to understand is that braided spin density from coherent emotion and ensouled DNA is food. <p>The Andromedan Council in armada around Earth, with the Tau Ceti, Procyon, Pleadian... have been trying to slap the patty's of the Warrior Draco's as pawns of the Orion Queens & their Sirian puppet government. (Having left a trail of destruction against remnant humanoids from Pleides to Procyon to Tau Ceti.. this sounds like Star Wars in the Empire for good reason kids: IT''S WORSE THAN TRUE!) Draco's have two hearts, 15 to 22 feet tall, the strength of 8 to 16 men, they are hard to kill, their psychic and technology skills in battle are thousands of years ahead of ours, they have no conscience remorse or compassion, they particularly like eating human children (tens of thousands taken from NY alone) and now they have taken mind control over enough of our govenment leaders to pretend that martial law is necessary to remove all our defenses (to their tightly controlled excuse for "harvesting" Earth and humans as a "natural resource": black helicopter New World Order,UN). The feds THOUGHT they were our allies!<p> The real insight of Maya, is spiral recursion in time or spin measure.<br> Doorway to implosion, the ultimate connectivity device..<br> EKG Spectrum Analysis Shows Onset Fractal Recursion of Harmonics at The Moment of Compassion/Love. Fractal Attractive Embeddedness bends light, creates gravity, dilates time. PHI Based Recursive Braidednes which measureably increases in DNA in the presence of coherent EKG, launches wave lengths and velocities by PHI heterodyne thru light and time barriers.<p>This soul wormhole connection based on love is the only surviving memory as this galactic sector passes thru nexus/black hole event horizon, which is why ET's want our DNA.<p>Daniel Winter, 137 Biodome Dr, Waynesville, NC 28786, USA (A Phi Ray of Time)<br>Where there is flame, waves have agreed.. <p>For a complete version of this story please link to: <a href="http://www.estrie.com/macphi/earthchg/earthchg.htm">Close to the Heart</a> - Earth Changes-Et's and the Haarp Project by: Dan Winter<p><hr>Return to:|   <a href="speak.html">The Captain Speaks</a>  |  <a href="log.html">Log Index</a>  |  <a href="ethership.html">Portal Ether Ship</a>   |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>               |<p><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995-1996 Earth Portals</center><p> </body></html>

"This will enable us torecreate the universe here on Earth."<p>The realization of this vision is based on significantlyincreasing the rate at which spacecraft are launched. "Today,we launch about once a decade," Casani noted. The goal is atleast one flight each month.<p>Current mission costs total $300 million to $500 millionfor the launch vehicle alone, he pointed out. "So, we'll need touse smaller vehicles that run $20 million to $30 million. We'llalso need to decrease the number of people needed to fly thespacecraft."<p>Mission operations staff grabs some 30 percent of eachmission's budget. "We must automate the machine so itrequires less human attention," Casani maintained.A "bold and challenging" program that will enable thisvision, New Millennium is based on taking "quantum steps and not justimprovements in technology. We're talking about atechnological revolution."<p>The program calls for utilizing microspacecraft and microinstruments in order to use smaller launch vehicles. To cutoperations staff, New Millennium will develop moreintelligent spacecraft, onboard autonomy, robotic spacecraft and shorterflight time. "This will enable us to accomplish our visionfor the 21st century," he said.In creating the program, the New Millennium scienceworking group - comprising astrophysicists, space physicists, planetaryscientists and terrestrial scientists - was established todefine the driving missions for the next century. The groupidentified the primary science questions and high-priority sciencemissions.<p>The scientists also offered a series of basic questionsthey hoped these missions would address: What is the origin andevolution of the universe? How do young stars and planetarysystems form and evolve? How does the Earth's dynamic systemchange? How did life on Earth form, and can it be sustainedover long periods? How did the solar system form?It is these questions, Stofan noted, that "drive us to goout and explore the universe." That calls for new ways of doingbusiness.<p>"We have to move from the old method of sending a singlespacecraft out as observers, to having a virtual presencewith multiple spacecraft operating solar system wide."New Millennium thinking leads us from the notion ofreconnaissance to a detailed exploration of planetarybodies," she said. "We must use technology to enhance our capabilities andenable affordable missions."<p>New ways of doing business also mean that instead ofconventional contracting with industry, JPL would actuallyform partnerships, she noted. Instead of multiple-objectivespacecraft, future exploration calls for focused objective science craft."That may mean that the entire spacecraft would be designedaround a single experiment or science objective."Instead of large ground operations staff, the spacecraftwould have more onboard autonomy.<p>"We would move from risk avoidance to risk management,from creating data that are used only by researchers to havinginformation widely available to the public," Stofanexplained.Missions of the future that drive the New Millenniumprogram include a Mars network of spacecraft, outer planet orbiters,landers on satellites, solar probes or orbiters, Earth-observing network missions, networks of magnetosphere and ionosphericmapping satellites, multiple spacecraft interferometerconstellations to detect and image extra solar planets, andextreme outer solar system reconnaissance missions, accordingto Stofan.<p>"Our vision for the 21st century is to establish a virtualpresence in space, as well as access new frontiers to expandour scientific understanding of the universe. The explorationthat has occurred during the past 20 to 30 years has accelerated ourdesire and our need. We must continue to move forward," shemaintained.<p>This vision will enable JPL to access a wide range oftargets. "The idea of using networks and constellations of spacecraftallows us to address dynamic and complex systems in ways wethought unachievable due to cost."The capability to launch one spacecraft each month allowsrapid implementation of any new capability you come up with,as well as rapid response to targets of interest."She conceded that this vision is ambitious. "We're talkingabout multiple spacecraft operating simultaneously, as wellas spacecraft being sent across the solar system in the 21stcentury.<p>"The reality is that missions must not exceed $250million. That means spacecraft mass must be significantly decreased."We think the answer is miniaturization - which must be donewithout losing capability - and infusing technology such thatwe have autonomy and intelligent flight systems that enablecheaper operation of the spacecraft," Stofan offered.Wilson defined the required capabilities that will makethe new vision work. Should missions call for planetary or comet andasteroid exploration, capabilities include aero-capture,networks of small spacecraft, landers, sample acquisition andanalysis, she explained.<p>The New Millennium approach cites the need to work towardaffordable micro instruments for doing in situ analysis "sothat one isn't always required to bring samples back," Wilsonadded.In the general area of flight systems, Wilson noted thatthe highest priority seems to be emerging in terms of onboardautonomy; new, more affordable approaches to operating thespacecraft; station keeping and precision control of clustersand networks; more efficient, non-nuclear energy collection andstorage and high-energy density storage onboard thespacecraft.<p>"Providing these necessary capabilities will only bepossible through an accelerated infusion of new technologies,"Wilson noted. "We need a focused development of these keytechnologies and flight validation of their performance. Thisprovides the motivation for the program."New Millennium adopts a unique approach that incorporatesthe final stages of technology development and flight validationin a single program. Furthermore, the technologies will bevalidated in a science-return mode in order to confirm definitively theirreadiness to be baselined for future science-demonstrationmissions.<p>While many technologies can enhance mission capabilities,the focus of the New Millennium Program will be on revolutionarybreakthroughs that offer significant mission cost reductions,enable frequent missions, and address the "tall poles" forspace exploration in the 21st century. A preliminary list of suchcritical technologies includes:<p>o Advanced flight computers utilizing 3D packaging andother approaches that reduce the size and power requirements forhigh-speed data processing on board.<br>o Onboard autonomy or new ways to operate multiplespacecraft, including autonomous navigation and closed-loop featuretracking; also, self commanding and health monitoring must be done onboard, instead of requiring ground in the loop; information systemarchitecture that can be migrated back and forth between theground and the spacecraft.<br>o Compact battery technologies.<br>o Emerging micro electrical mechanical systems wherebyelectronics and other types of functionality, such as thesensors, as well as mechanical and optical devices are integrated on achip.<br>o Instruments that can be used in situ.<br>o A planetary integrated camera spectrometer thatmultiplexes part of the system, enabling a range of measurements in asmall package.<br>o A next-generation charge coupled device&Ntilde;the active pixelsensor that drastically reduces power, size and complexityfor imaging.<br>o Concepts in reducing X-ray spectrometers, and forinterferometry, a large baseline optical gyro, precisionmetrology and autonomous station keeping.<P>Casani finished the presentation by explaining how theconcept will be implemented. "We'll embark on a series ofdemonstration flights between 1995 and 2000, carried out throughpartnerships with industry, whereby industry will even own part of theproduct itself.<p>"We're forming industry/government working groups, with aplanned session in early February - all aimed at involvingindustry more closely in a cooperative way. We're looking to SmallDisadvantaged Businesses, and annual New Millennium workshopsthat will solicit the best new technology concepts, as well asstimulate and encourage participation from all sectors of thescience and technology community."<p>Casani and his staff are forming integrated product-development teams in microelectronics, autonomy, instruments andmicroelectromechanical systems. Members will come from NASA,industry, other government agencies, and universities."Laid across those teams is the program design itself,which will be done in a concurrent engineering environment inJPL's Project Design Center," Casani said. "We'll design eachflight here, for the first three to four demonstration flights."We'll look at different mission sets, including smallbody, interferometer and microlanders, and evaluate theirtechnology richness and commercialization value. How much money isspent in operations? What is the science value, and how does itcontribute to qualifying the hardware at hand?<p>Casani explained that the program will produce 12 or moresample mission sets that are compatible with schedule andbudget. "These will be reviewed with NASA Headquarters, and we'replanning to have them complete by the end of February. By early April,we'll do a more refined pass, with Headquarters selecting thefinal mission set.<p>In summary, Casani said: "The vision for 21st century iscome into focus and the technologies needed to realize that visionare on the horizon and through a series of technology validationflights we can make the vision a reality. Now is the time forthis learning organization to move into the new millennium."<p><b>Related Information</b><p><ul><li><a href="http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/About/FAQ/faq.html">New Millennium Program FAQ's</a><li><a href="http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/About/Vision/Vision.html">New Millennium Program Vision</a><li><a href="http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/About/BriefHistory/BriefHistory.html">New Millennium Program History</a></ul><p><hr>Return to:|   <a href="log.html">Log Index</a>  |  <a href="log96.html">Captain's Log Book 1996</a>  |  <a href="ethership.html">Portal Ether Ship</a>   |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>               |<p><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

Until recently the author was chief of the Systems Layout Branch at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. In earlier years, he devoloped the structural design of the Saturn V booster and participated in the design of Skylab. He has left NASA in order to spend his full time on research concerning extraterrestrial visitors in ancient times. He wrote the book Da tat sich der Himmel auf (The Spaceships of Eziekel)</font><p>References in some holy scripture to strange machines have prompted, throughout history, speculation and conjecture in order to lend acceptable, if not rational, explanations of the phenomenon reported. Modern technical knowledge and test procedures have been used to reconstruct a model of what was sen and experienced by one of the four great Jewish prophets two and a half millennia ago.<hr>Return to:|   <a href="log.html">Log Index</a>  |  <a href="ethership.html">Portal Ether Ship</a>   |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>               |<p><font size=5>A</font>ny thoughts of visits to our planet by extraterrestrail beings is immediately stopped by the realization that existing scientific knowledge precludes that possibility. If such visits could be made at all, they would have to originate outside our solar system, and interstellar journeys would require unimaginable lengths of time. Yet this established knowledge is confronted with the wealth of mankind's myths and legends which claim the exact opposite, that "gods" came from the skies. Their appearances were frequently accompanied by fire, smoke and thunderous noise; their influence on man was, mostly, beneficial. If the source of this information is the ' primitive' peoples' we call it a fable; if the origin lies in religious scriptures of the more developed civilizations, we interpret the tales in a more spiritual or even holy manner.<p>That this attitude is unfair and wrong is manifest in at least two respects: it disregards the sincere and honest belief of the peoples who handed down the accounts, and degrades the tales to fictional stories. At its worst, the information is dismissed as the result of hallucination, the effects of drugs, or plain invention. But this attitude is also wrong and unfair with regard to man's future development because it denies even the possibility of progress in the corresponding fields of science.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>Thus we seem to be at an impasse because of an apparent conflict between science and legend. Yet the way is not totally blocked: we can make progress in this very important field of knowledge once we realize that science and engineering are two separate (although not independent) activities, each with its own area of significance. We must acknowledge the present inability of science to help formulate answers to the question of extraterrestrial visitors, while realizing that engineering and industrial technology have not been introduced to the contoversy. The participation of engineers becomes an unconditional requirement in the evaluation of configurations and phenomena implying visits from other worlds. Here it is only natural that our fledgling knowledge concerning space flight emerges as a contributor of prime significance.<p><b>My interest is aroused.</b><p>My own involvement in the subject of extraterrestrial visitors began with a vehemently negative attitude. Having worked as an aeronautical engineer since 1934-first in the design and analysis of aircraft, then for the past fifteen years in the design and development of both launching vehicles and spacecraft-I was firmly entrenched in the camp of those who declare visits from outer space to be an impossibility.<p>It was in this frame of mind that I began to read Erich von Daniken's "Chariots of the Gods? His claim that the prophet Ezekiel had encounters with spaceships prompted me to read the bibical bok of Ezekiel carefully with the intention of proving von Daniken wrong. By the time I had got to verse 7 of the very first chapter, however, I found myself interpreting a description of the landings legs of some kind of flying vehicle: <blockquote>"Their legs were straight. and the soles of their feet ewere round; and they sparkled like burnished bronze."</blockquote>Having designed and tested such structures myself, I could not deny that it was possible to read in this a direct, yet simple, technical description.<p>The contrast of that evidentaly clear passage with the quite hazy pictures sketched by the rest of the chapter made me realize that the prophet could not have known what it was he had seen, or could not have understood it. I realize the necessary consequences of this: the prophet could only describe his encounters with space vehicles and their crews in the terms available to him-with words and comparisons familiar to him and his contemporaries. So I began taking Ezekiel seriously, in an engineering sense.<p>Because I had to rely on translations, I used six diferent bibles, ranging in time from early in the last century to 1972, edited by Jewish, Roman Catholic, and protestant translators. Besides these, I used two highly detailed biblical commentaries.<p>My application of aircraft (specifically, helicopter) and spacecraft engineering principles to the reports of the prophet resulted in the penetration of Ezekiel's visual descriptions, and the replacement of these by known structural configurations. The final result is shown by the drawing at the beginning of this paper. There we see a quasi-conical main body, supported by four helicopter units, which carries the command capsule atop its rounded upper portion. We should consider that Ezekiel first saw this vehicle at a distance of about 1,000 meters; at the moment the nuclear engine fired, probably with some white clouds of condensation (because of the engine's "chilldown" phase) shooting past the craft's main body.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>In these fiery, dynamic surroundings Ezekiel notices the moving rotors, see the landing legs and mechanical arms attached to the helicopter units. His first reaction is to compare the helicopters with man-like figures, but he then finds in the term 'living creatures' an expression of admirable vagueness to reflect his uncertainty. During final decent and landing, Ezekiel observes the protective covers of the helicopter's gear mechanisms, which he able to describe best by comparing them with human faces. he notices the red-hot radiator -glowing coals- (Chapter 1, verse 13)<blockquote>13.         "As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like     burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and     down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of     the fire went forth lightning."</blockquote> covering part of the lower central body; the prophet is fascinated by the wheels which, in their basic form, are the only element he recognizes and thus describes in great detail.<p><IMG SRC="wheel.gif" align="right">The visual description of the wheel has been misinterpreted in numerous paintings and texts. Yet no one has ever taken seriously the functional description which indicates that the wheels could move,  in any direction, without being turned or steered. The latter has led me to develop a precise engineering interpretation, and for which a patent was granted by the United States Patent Office no. 3,789,947, Feb. 5, 1974. A particularly gratifying application of this interpretation, incidentally, would be to facilitate considerably the mobility of wheelchairs for the physically handicapped.<p><b>Prototype, analytical research</b><p>Ezekiel ends his technical description with comments on the command capsule and on the commander himself. The amount of detail he includes is astounding. It is significant that the prophet describes features which are of little engineering importance but which, to the eye, carry the same weight as true structual elements. The quasi-conical shape of the spacecraft's central body-ideally suited to permit its combination with the helicopters, and thus a most important feature of the vehicle-is an existing engineering product. It was developed at the Langley Research Center of NASA, and has been studied analytically and in a series of wind-tunnel tests.<p>After establishing the general configuration of the spaceship, I made an analytical investigation; although the configuration appeared to be structurally and functionally sound, its feasibility could be proved only if weights, dimensions, performance and other basic characteristics turned out to be within reasonable limits. The analysis was performed parametrically, that means dimensions, weights and performance were varied in steps over a wide range of possibilities. From the first crude calculation to the final detailed analysis, the results left no doubt of the vehicles feasibility: they revea; a general technology of spacecraft construction not far beyond our current, most advanced capabilities. The only element we are incapable of building is the nuclear reactor within the propulsion system. Although this would be a fission reactor, it would require a specific impulse, of at least 2,000 seconds against the about 900 seconds of today's nuclear engines. It is reasonable to assume, however, that we could have this capability within a few decades if we were to invest enough effort in its development.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>   |<p>The over-all result, then, is a space vehicle technically feasible beyond doubt and very well designed to suit function and purpose; its technology is in no way fantastic but, even in its extreme aspects, lies almost within our own capabilities of today. The results indicate, moreover, that Ezekiel's spacecraft operated in conjunction with a mother vessel orbiting the earth. We have no point of firm reference for an exact determination of the dimensions of the landing craft, but we can approximate these within the range I investigated analytically. The illustration at the top shows the shape and proportions. The diameter of the central body would be about 18 m, that of the rotor of a helicopter unit would be 11 m, total weight from the time of lift-off from the earth for the return flight to the mother ship would be 100,000 kg, the engine's specific impulse would be 2,080 seconds, and the craft would carry two or three passengers.<p>With these conclusions, I had to declare defeat; I wrote to Eric von Daniken, explaining that my attempt to refute his theory had resulted in a structural and analytical conformation of a major part of his hypothesis. Determining the form, dimensions and functional capabilities of what Ezekiel saw makes understanadable a number of passages in his text that are otherwise meaningless; it also aids considerably in separating the prophetic or visionary parts of Ezekiel's book from those concerning encounters with spaceships. (I confined my study to the latter.) Being an engineer, I am not qualified to investigate the non-engineering portions.<p>In the book <a href="../Portal_Messenger/divine.html">Divine Encounters</a> by Zecharia Sitchin there is mention of Blumrich's work on page 204.<p>Return to: <a href="#top">Top</a><p><center><a href="../Portal_Messenger/divine.html#ezekiel"><IMG SRC="sumersm.gif"></a></center><center> Return to Divine Encounters Review</center><p> <hr><center>Return to:|   <a href="log.html">Log Index</a>  |  <a href="ethership.html">Portal Ether Ship</a>   |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>               |</center><p><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995-1996 Earth Portals</center><p> </body></html>

Married and 30 years old at the time, Ezekiel was a priest and came from an upper-class family. When he saw the spacecraft for the first time, the experience was overwhelming and left him in severe shock. In the first chapter of his book he tells us most of what we can learn of the craft's structure and function. Although he tells us later that he was picked up aboard the spacecraft near Tel-Abib where he lived and was later returned there, he has little recollection of the flight itself. Completely overcome by the experience, he flies (Chapter 3, Verse 14). <p>14.'in bitterness in the heat of my spirit'<p>The second encounter follows within a few months.

Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake     with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.<p>In his account of the third experience one year after the first (Chapter 8-11), Ezekiel narrates a fascinating event culminating in what seems to be a maintenance or repair operation on the spacecraft.<p><b>Ezekiel 8</b><p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p>1.    And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth     day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat     before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me.<p>2.     Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the     appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even     upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber.<p>3.    And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine     head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and     brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner     gate that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of     jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.<p>4.    And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the     vision that I saw in the plain.<p>5.    Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward     the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and     behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the     entry.<p>6.    He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even     the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I     should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again, and thou     shalt see greater abominations.<p>7.    And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a     hole in the wall.<p>8.    Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had     digged in the wall, behold a door.<p>9.    And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that     they do here.<p>10.   So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and     abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, pourtrayed     upon the wall round about.<p>11.   And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of     Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan,     with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense     went up.<p>12.   Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of     the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his     imagery? for they say, the LORD seeth us not; the LORD hath forsaken     the earth.<p>13.   He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater     abominations that they do.<p>14.   Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD's house which     was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.<p>15.   Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn thee yet     again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these.<p>16.   And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house, and,     behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and     the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the     temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they     worshipped the sun toward the east.<p>17.   Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light     thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which     they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have     returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their     nose.<p>18.   Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither     will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice,     yet will I not hear them.<p><b>Ezekiel 9</b><p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p>1.    He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that     have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his     destroying weapon in his hand.<p>2.    And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth     toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one     man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his     side: and they went in, and stood beside the brasen altar.<p>3.    And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub,     whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the     man clothed with linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side;<p>4.    And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through     the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men     that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the     midst thereof.<p>5.    And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the     city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity:<p>6.    Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women:     but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my     sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the     house.<p>7.    And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the     slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.<p>8.    And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that     I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou     destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon     Jerusalem?<p>9.   Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is     exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of     perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath forsaken the earth, and the     LORD seeth not.<p>10.   And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity,     but I will recompense their way upon their head.<p>11.   And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by his     side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded     me.<p><b>Ezekiel 10</b><p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p>1.    Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of     the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as     the appearance of the likeness of a throne.<p>2.    And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between     the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of     fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the city. And he     went in in my sight.<p>3.    Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man     went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.<p>4.    Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood over the     threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and     the court was full of the brightness of the LORD's glory.<p>5.    And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer     court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.<p>6.    And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with     linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the     cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.<p>7.    And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto     the fire that was between the cherubims, and took thereof, and put it     into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and     went out.<p>8.    And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under     their wings.<p>9.    And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel     by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance     of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone.<p>10.   And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel     had been in the midst of a wheel.<p>11.   When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as     they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it;     they turned not as they went.<p>12.   And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their     wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels     that they four had.<p>13.   As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.<p>14.   And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub,     and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a     lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.<p>15.   And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature that I     saw by the river of Chebar.<p>16.   And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the     cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same     wheels also turned not from beside them.<p>17.   When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these     lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living creature was in     them.<p>18.   Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the     house, and stood over the cherubims.<p>19.   And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth     in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside them, and     every one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD's house; and     the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.<p>20.   This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the     river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims.<p>21.   Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the     likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.<p>22.   And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the     river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one     straight forward.<p><b>Ezekiel 11</b><p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p>1.    Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of     the LORD's house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the     gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur,     and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.<p>2.    Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise     mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:<p>3.    Which say, It is not near; let us build houses: this city is the     caldron, and we be the flesh.<p>4.    Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.<p>5.    And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus     saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the     things that come into your mind, every one of them.<p>6.    Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the     streets thereof with the slain.<p>7.    Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the     midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron: but I     will bring you forth out of the midst of it.<p>8.    Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the     Lord GOD.<p>9.    And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the     hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.<p>10.   Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel;     and ye shall know that I am the LORD.<p>11.   This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in     the midst thereof; but I will judge you in the border of Israel:<p>12.   And ye shall know that I am the LORD: for ye have not walked in my     statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the     manners of the heathen that are round about you.<p>13.   And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of     Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud     voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant     of Israel?<p>14 .  Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<p>15.   Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred,     and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants     of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is this land     given in possession.<p>16   Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far     off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the     countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries     where they shall come.17.   Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the     people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been     scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.<p>18.   And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the     detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.<p>19.   And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you;     and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them     an heart of flesh:<p>20.   That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do     them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.<p>21.   But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable     things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their     own heads, saith the Lord GOD.<p>22.   Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them;     and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.<p>23.   And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood     upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.<p>.24.  Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the     Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision     that I had seen went up from me.<p>25.   Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the LORD     had shewed me.<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p>A mechanical arm reaches from a helicopter unit toward the red-hot area at the lower tip of the main body (Chapter 10, Verse 7) hands a 'hot' part of some kind to a member of the crew on the ground who had been ordered to take a position near one of the helicopters. <p>7.    And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto     the fire that was between the cherubims, and took thereof, and put it     into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and     went out.<p>The crewman carries away the hot part. A comparison of the temple Ezekiel describes with a plan of Solomon's Temple (still standing at that time) shows that Ezekiel's description is of another temple, but where?<p>The same question is raised by the fourth encounter, twenty years after the first (Chapter 40)<p><b>Ezekiel 40</b><p>1.    In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of     the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after     that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was     upon me, and brought me thither.<p>2.    In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me     upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the     south.<p>3.    And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose     appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his     hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.<p>4.    And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear     with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee;     for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art thou brought     hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.<p>5.    And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the     man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand     breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the     height, one reed.<p>6.    Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up     the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was     one reed broad; and the other threshold of the gate, which was one reed     broad.<p>7.    And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad; and     between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the     gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.<p>8.    He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.<p>9.    Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts     thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.<p>10.   And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side,     and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts     had one measure on this side and on that side.<p>11.   And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and     the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.<p>12.   The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side,     and the space was one cubit on that side: and the little chambers were     six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p>13.   He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the     roof of another: the breadth was five and twenty cubits, door against     door.<p>14.   He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the     court round about the gate.<p>15.   And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the     porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.<p>16.   And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their     posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and     windows were round about inward: and upon each post were palm trees.<p>17.   Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were     chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty     chambers were upon the pavement.<p>18.   And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of     the gates was the lower pavement.<p>19.   Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto     the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward     and northward.<p>20.   And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he     measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.<p>21.   And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and three on     that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the     measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the     breadth five and twenty cubits.<p>22.   And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were after     the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they went up     unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.<p>23.   And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the     north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an     hundred cubits.<p>24 .  After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the     south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof     according to these measures.<p>25.   And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about,     like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five     and twenty cubits.<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p>26.   And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were     before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on     that side, upon the posts thereof.<p>27.   And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he     measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits.<p>28.  And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured     the south gate according to these measures;<p>29.   And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches     thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and     in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five     and twenty cubits broad.<p>30.  And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long, and five     cubits broad.<p>31.   And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were     upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it had eight steps.<p>32.   And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured     the gate according to these measures.<p>33.   And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches     thereof, were according to these measures: and there were windows     therein and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits     long, and five and twenty cubits broad.<p>34.   And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm trees     were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the     going up to it had eight steps.<p>35.   And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according to these     measures;<p>36.   The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof,     and the windows to it round about: the length was fifty cubits, and the     breadth five and twenty cubits.<p>37.   And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were     upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going     up to it had eight steps.<p>38.   And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of the     gates, where they washed the burnt offering.<p>39.   And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two     tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin     offering and the trespass offering.<p>40.   And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north     gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of     the gate, were two tables.<p>41.   Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the     side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their sacrifices.<p>42.   And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a     cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit     high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the     burnt offering and the sacrifice.<p>43.   And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon     the tables was the flesh of the offering.<p>44.   And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the     inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their     prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having     the prospect toward the north.<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p>45.   And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south,     is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.<p>46.   And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests,     the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok     among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto     him.<p>47.   So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits     broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house.<p>48.   And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of     the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and     the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits     on that side.<p>49.   The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven     cubits, and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it: and     there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that     side.<p>Ezekiel's arrival at a large complex of buildings proves to have been scheduled because he is awaited by a man wearing clothing similar to that of the ship's commander and who takes the prophet on an extended tour through the temple. The report of this encounter, as well as the Book of Ezekiel, ends abruptly and must be considered as a fragment.<p>Nowhere in these episodes do we find contradiction, neither in the repition of the vehicles's description nor in the events related to the space vessel. There is also complete agreement betwenn my engineering reconstruction, based on present-day advanced technical knowledge, and the bibical words.<p><center><a href="../Portal_Messenger/divine.html#ezekiel"><IMG SRC="sumersm.gif"></a></center><center> Return to Divine Encounters Review</center><p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p><hr><center>Return to:|   <a href="ezekiel.html">Ezekiel's Spaceship</a>  |  <a href="log.html">Log Index</a>  |  <a href="ethership.html">Portal Ether Ship</a>   |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>               |</center><p><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995-1996 Earth Portals</center><p> </body></html>

He had the incredible ability to keep his intellect unimparied by the emotional turmoil caused by the first encounter. Yet he was in a condition of shock by the time he observed the commander of the vessel. Ezekiel wrote that it took him seven days to recover from the experience. One could therefore expect him to say that he had seen God, and that God spoke to him, yet he compared the figue of the commander to that of "Adam' or 'man, and very soberly says 'one spoke to me'. Never in all his encounters with the commander and other members ofd the crew does he show any reverence.<p>The information conveyed by Ezekiel leads us to conclude that he came in contact with part of an expeditionary force; there are unmistakable questions of rank, formal communication and organization. This, combined with the assumption that extraterrestrial civilizations too would have to have economic control of activities they undertake, lead us to surmise that-even for financial reasons-Ezekiel cannot have been the sole purpose and target of the enterprise.<p>With such notions, however, I obviously begin to leave the territory of provable engineering affirmations. For several reasons, I conclude that Ezekiel's encounters with spaceships and his prophesies do not coincide in time. He could of seen the space vessel on one day and have his prophetic experience months of even years later. Yet the commander spoke to the prophet. We know from the history of the bibical Book of Ezekiel that it was edited some time after it had been written. Several points of my engineering investigation show that editing to have been done with complete honesty and truthfulness, although the lack of knowledge of what Ezekiel really meant become evident in some places. We are justified to assume, consequently, that some of the commandr's sayings may be contained in what we now consider as Ezekiel's visions and prophesies. It would be of very great interest, of course, to have these non-technical parts of the Book of Ezekiel searched acccordingly. Since his revelations were written down long before the advent of flying machines or rockets, the only way man could interpret Ezekiel's enigmatic statements was through religion and, especially, mysticism.<p>The application of engineering knowledge leaves no voids in the text's interpretation, nor does it require any force to achieve agreement. Attempts to explain the same phenomenon by vision, hallucination, or psychological or astrological effects requires one to accept a long series of coincidences. These would be necessary, indeed, to substantiate the congruities which I have established technically.<p>Today's established position concerning visitors from beyond the Earth can be summed up by the statement: 'We do not know where they came from and how they arrived here, so they cannot have been here'. With time, the evidence will grow into a more understandable pattern, so that we can then declare: 'They were here, so they must of come here'. Advanced technology provides a means to make progress in this field, and I hope to stir enough interest in other engineers (not only design and structural specialist) to perform similar studies. And we cannot work for long without the support of scientistphysicists, archeologists and ethologists. What is needed foremost is open-minded cooperation, and I plead for that.<p><center><a href="../Portal_Messenger/divine.html#ezekiel"><IMG SRC="sumersm.gif"></a></center><center> Return to Divine Encounters Review</center><p><hr>Return to:|   <a href="ezekiel.html">Ezekiel's spaceships</a>  |  <a href="prophet.html">Ezekiel the Prophet</a>  |  <a href="log.html">Log Index</a>  |  <a href="ethership.html">Portal Ether Ship</a>   |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>               <center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995-1996 Earth Portals</center><p> </body></html>

Most of the ferment microbes are: Bacteria ( Baccillus, Lactobacillus) yeast  (Saccharomyces, Toula), and molds (Aspergillus, Rhizopus). These microbes are excellent decomposers, and safe to use since they are mostly used for fermenting certain food.<p>RICE BRAN (D-1) and starch are utilized as a culture base for the microbes. Enzymes such as amaylase, protease, lipase,  cillulase, and urease are produced as a by-product of the fermentation process.<p>BYM-ACTIVATOR when incorporated into the soil and organic wastes hastens the decomposition of organic materials while improving the quality of the soil. The microflora in the soil is improved by the reintroduction of beneficial microbial colonies present in BYM-ACTIVATOR. These beneficial microbes are known to control the activity of pathogenic microorganinisms. As a result healthier crops are produced as a result of the increase in soil humus and reduction of bad microbes.<p><h3>BYM-Activator for Fermentation of Organic Fertilizer</h3><p>Three kinds of microbes are in BYM-Activator:1.Bacteria: Bacillus/Lactubaccillus<br>2.Yeast: Saccharomyses, Torula<br>3.Molds: Aspergillus, Rhisopus<p>Enzymes in BYM-Activator:Amylase: a diastatic enzyme.Protease: a protein decomposing enzyme.Lipase: a fat decomposing enzyme.Cellulase: a decomposing enzyme.Redoxase: a decomposing enzyme.Katalase: an oxidation/reduction enzyme.Zymase: an alkohol fermenting enzyme.Lastase: a lactose decomposing enzyme.Urease: a decomposing enzyme.<p>BYM-Activator has a strong aerobic fermentation mpower and demonstrates its fermentative function in the production of compost in which organic matter full of fibres are used, and promotes the decomposition and ripening of organic matter in a short period of time.<p>BYM-Activator accelerates the fermentation of materials that contain toxic substances or that are difficult to decompose such as wood chips and removes their toxicity by decomposition.<p>BYM-Activator decomposes various organic fertilizers and saccharifies them and decomposes them into amino acids by the function of hydrolysis and glucose, high grade alchohol, and amino acids produced by the decomposition become the best culture media of the ecosystem (microflora) of the soiul.<p>BYM-Activator produces fertilizers containing the most important nutrients for crops.<p>BYM-Activator can produce self-supplies fertilizers such as various organic liquid fertilizers.<p>  <hr>Return to: |    <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <a href="enzyme.html">Enzyme World</a>  |  <a href="portalmk.html">Portal Market</a>  |  <a href="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</a>  |  <a href="/earthportals/index2.html">Home</a>  |<p><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995-1996 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

AquaCulture farming and Aquarium maintenance.</h3><p>Pond application<p>The BYM-Activator was first used in prawn farming in Bacolod City , Phillipines. The original purpose for its use was to sterilize the ground during its preparatory stages prior to filling the pond with water. The BYM-Activator was distributed evenly all over the pond and was tilled with the soil. For  (1) hectare pond, 50 kilograms of BYM-Activator was used. The ground was left alone for three (3) days prior to filling with water.<p>All through the growing period of the prawns, observations on the pond showed very encouraging results. The growth of plankton was amazing. For the duration of the period, efforts were exerted to remove the plankton, but just as they were removed, they would grow again. Another interesting result was that of the water purity in comparison to other ponds. Also, uniform growth of the prawns, less mortality and higher yield were observed.<p>BYM-Activator is also effective in pollution control and disease prevention, because it eliminates obnoxious and toxic intermediate by-products of decomposition. Due to the enzymatic action, pond bottom wastes are broken down directly to basic elements that include oxygen, thereby contributing to increased oxygenation of pond bottom.<p>BYM-Activator when used for aquaculture:<p><ul><li>Increased stability in water so that frequency in cleaning and water exchenge is reduced and thus increasing production per unit.<li>Enhances nitrification cycles.<li>Control pond pollution as well as aquariums.<li>Promotes high survival rate...important for rare tropical fish.<li>Promotes healthy disease-resistant prawns or fish because of the antibiotic produced by the microorganisms.<li>Produces uniform sized prawns and fish in the growing of these water life forms.<li>Reduces feed consumption and feed cost...important for aquariums over 500 gallons.</ul><p>More information to aid the aquaculture farmer available on request.<p><h3>2. Soil bioremediation for wine production and other farm products.</h3><p><h3>3. Nutritional supplement for poultry and livestock.</h3><p><h3>4. Treating odorous waste.</h3><p>When used in treating waste, BYM-Activator eliminates the odor through bacterial and enzymatic action. Saprophytic parasites and pathogenic anerobes which thrives in garbage disposal areas were greatly reduced by the antibiotic and bacteriostatic action of the inoculent.<p>When used in proper dosage, BYM-Activator:<p><ul><li>Reduces trhe obnoxious odor created by the decomposing organic wastes.<li>Eliminates the pathogenic microbes and parasites nematodes.<li>Increases the rate of the decomposition of organic wastes.<li>Produces an organic fertilizer by-product when used in decomposing biorganic wastes.<li>Reduces fly larvae and flies as a result of the elimination of garbage ordor.</ul><p>No additional safty equipment is necessary when using BYM-Activator. It is non-toxic, non-chemical, and environmentally friendly.<p><h3>5. Cancer preventative.</h3><p>By optimizing the digestive process we can eliminate many toxic materials from our intestinal tract, and thus lessing any chances for disease to set in at the colon. More material is available on request as a cancer preventative.<hr>Return to:  |   <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <a href="enzyme.html">Enzyme World</a>  |  <a href="portalmk.html">Portal Market</a>  |  <a href="/earthportals/index2.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>    |<P><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995-1996 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

In order to do this we need to prepare ourselves for the alternatives to types of energy that will move anything that is in a precarious equilibrium.<p>If we pay attention to a whole series of warnings that the Earth is giving out we will be able to understand  the direction to take in order to avoid irreversible damage.<p>We need not alarm ourselves or others, but must be ready to act, to help as many other people as possible to become aware so that those who remain unaware i.e. unreachable at an energetic level, can still find help, thus reducing the  inevitable damage caused by the occlusion of   balancing genetic movement (an unbalanced human being) who finds himself driven from pillar to post by uncontrollable impulses due to his lack of  capacity to deal with the energy that is arriving via the ozone layer.<p> We must act to end the loss of climatic balance caused by the hole in the ozone layer. You can't imagine how much damage it is doing to a whole series of oxygen based micro-organisms that live in the air  and which, when lacking or diminished in numbers, weaken the bacterial control which form part of man's defence system.<p>We need to stem the damage until we find the ideal solution to a problem which is getting worse and which will certainly not improve with time.<p>You will have asked yourself what you can do to help and I am replying that you can do a lot at the informative level.<p>This is the first message that will awaken in you the desire to communicate in order to receive the necessary information that will help staunch the problem and thus render the Earth less susceptible to cataclysms that would otherwise be inevitable.<p>If there is the willingness to do so, then there is the possibility of intervening.This is  part of Operation Katamar.<p>Alone to you dear sister, Dior<p>																											<hr><p><a name="dior2"><b>Message two from Dior:</b></a><p>DIOR, 313<p>Dior, what do you have to tell me?<p>We strongly feel the need to communicate and to warn that difficult times are coming, we need to act promptly in order to limit the damages.<p>Why?<p>Man's use of technology has destroyed Earth's organic defences, changing the  natural biological rhythms and the cycle of the seasons.<p>These altered rhythms have an effect on the Earth's  production of energy and confuses the genetic rhythms that are indispensable to all types of reproduction; animal, vegetable and human.<p>At a very subtle level it is already possible to feel a type of  altered energy which we need to restrain in order to avoid repercussions to an equilibrium which is already under stress.<p>The external stimuli don't coincide with the internal ones and this leads to confusions as to how to act.<p> Understanding this, you will see that how you deal with this situation is important because when you understand you will find that the confusion caused by the unbalanced energy will disappear.<p>Being able to manage your own lives, even if it is with effort, you will be able to continue to communicate telepathically,  gathering precious indications for your daily lives and constructing a framework for cosmic exchanges which are not only useful to you Earthlings, they are indispensable  as a way of acquiring information for your present and future lives at a personal and terrestrial level.<p>If you can fully understand this, it won't be difficult for you to put yourself completely at our disposal  for a cause in which we are all involved.<p>If each of you who are in telepathic contact takes on the role that is awaiting you then you will find no difficulty in passing on the information because you will find many more people who are interested than you imagine.<p>You must ask yourselves these questions:<p> Do you believe that what we are telling you is true?<p>Do you feel that the source of this information is positive?<p>Are you afraid?<p>Do you feel that even if this is a very important mission that your help is indispensable?<p>As soon as you are clear within yourselves, be very decided as to where you stand so that doubts, uncertainties and anything else that might restrain you can&iacute;t come between you and us.<p>Anna, this is an important moment, but if you let yourself go with it, your agitation will decrease and moving into action will release all the energy that is compressed inside of you. Your health will improve and you will regain your joy in life. Try to get together with others who are in harmony with you and you will find that everything is easier.<p>Don't lose yourself in this confusing labyrinth where you are trying to find a structure that will let you go ahead with the same ideas as in the past. You can always do it as an exercise, but it is time consuming and takes away your attention from the present moment.<p>You need to concentrate your energy on constructive ideas and not to keep hooking into internal mazes  where you lose yourself. This won&iacute;t happen if you spend your time with the right people  because you won&iacute;t feel this need and will be free to act to the most of  your ability.<p>It is important  only to understand yourself and what you want, but I believe that the time has come for you to become profoundly aware so that you can make  the right  decisions and enjoy interior peace. If my prediction is true then this is the time that we can finally welcome you among us!<p>Alon dear sister, may the light of the sun warm you, light your way and sustain you on your path, Dior<p><hr><p><a name="dior3"><b>Message three from Dior:</b></a><p>                                                                              December 12, 1994   5:21 p.m.<p>DIOR 313<p>Dear ones, the moment in which you are living is  one of great expectations for all of us in that we would like to give you precise indications so that  terrestrial energy can be transformed into what at a cosmic level is an essence of purity and love.<p>This will be possible if you (Anna) respond to our telepathic appeal and if  others also in contact pass on the message that will lead to  the implementation of the Katamar mission.<p>What is important for you to know is that you need to become  an active and pure link for this cosmic transmission  so that you can pass on this indispensable information in order that the earth suffer less serious repercussions.<p>The problem is one of infiltration of the a type of micro-organism that is entering and becoming part of the oxygen, causing various types of alterations but especially at a genetic level. Realising that this is something unknown to you and not measurable  scientifically  because you don&iacute;t have the means for recognising nor quantifying it, you will understand that not fighting it could lead to its taking possession of the entire  system of life on the Earth. It would cause enormous damage on a subtle level against which  man is unable to defend himself, especially if he sees no danger. This is the awareness that you need to spread.<p>The hole in the ozone layer has permitted this infiltration because  the vital sequence  of Earth's equilibrium is disturbed at all levels. It is absolutely necessary to be prepared physically and psychologically in order that protective barrier of energy  be formed  against this threat.<p>This is what we want you to understand, that it is only by controlling the situation energetically that you can defend your immune systems against this attack; damage is already apparent  in the vegetable, animal and human ecosystems.<p>The repercussions will be notable because there is a lack of balance between the spiritual and material aspects on the Earth which has permitted the formation of the hole in the Earth&iacute;s protective layer and in consequence many people will be attacked with a resulting prevalence of all those qualities that tend to the negative, therefore when you communicate these indications it is very important to maintain a high level of spiritual energy within yourselves, preserving your equilibrium, otherwise the situation is not only dangerous per se but also for what you may unleash if you yourselves are attacked by these micro-organisms.<p>I want you to stop and reflect on this for a moment.<p> Anna: We understand what you are saying and want to know  how and when?<p> Dior: We don&iacute;t want to alarm you but the problem already exists - if you look around on the Earth there is no State in which there are  not already alterations at both the level of nature and of human beings.  The nations that will be most affected are those which are most &igrave;civilised&icirc; in that they are almost completely lacking in spirituality which is a major factor in their energetic disequilibrium. The northernmost countries are most severely affected and as you can see Russia is passing a particularly destructive phase, e.g. Chernobyl,  but also closer to you there are evident hot spots such as Yugoslavia while  further East there is a prevalent state of misery and situations of enormous power that leave little space to the individual, leading to a degradation of man and a  energetic disequilibrium.<p>Water is the element that will carry the most destructive effect in that  to purify ourselves we are going to have to be sure of internal as well as external  hygiene. Sea water will have the effect of weakening the hold of the micro-organisms therefore is important to remain in a relationship with the oceans on an energetic level even if  the seas themselves  are bound  to be the part of the earth that suffers the most.<p>However, we want to give you hope. If you can weave a web of energy around the globe formed of vibrations of love, then it will be possible to mend the above mentioned hole in the Earth's energy network.<p>Do you understand how important all of this is?<p>Your task of  revealing this message is crucial in that you will touch on arguments that many people have already felt at an unconscious level. If each person feels an echo of truth within themselves when they hear what you have to say, then they in their turn will disseminate it. You must create this opportunity for everyone,  your own intuition will guide you to speak to the right people at the right time.<p>Choose the people carefully, at least at the beginning so that you can form a homogenous group that will  give birth to other groups, thus gradually forming an energy network.<p>The first thing to do is to gather together various texts and communicate with the people that you feel are the most ready and you will see how many you find on your journey.<p>Dior<p><a name="dior4"><b>Message four from Dior:</b></a><p>Dior, 313.<p>Dior, can we go on with the indications for Operation  Katamar?<p>In order to divulge Operation Katamar is necessary to  profoundly assimilate the concepts that we are going to give you.<p>If we fully understand the concept ourselves it will be easy to gain the attention of others in that what we are saying will have the effect of stimulating a level of consciousness where such concepts already exist and the person involved will be surprised to find that he already has these thoughts within.<p>I want to encourage you to go ahead knowing that you are carrying a concrete and practical message of faith and  of strength that will open the doors of awareness to many.<p>Know that the Earth is in danger and therefore its inhabitants are subject to attacks of various types but that with faith that our lives are in our own hands, we can change a situation of danger into one of awareness.<p>It is indispensable that there be a cosmic energy link in order that new, very specific rays can be sent  to counterbalance the current disequilibrium.  We need your help, we need people who are in contact with us, channelling this  energy  to the Earth , bringing  aid  and solace to the soul&iacute;s of man, raising his energy and involving him in a cosmic alliance.<p>We don&iacute;t see any alternative for you at this time, but then what are we asking of you other than a telepathic relationship to help you manage a situation that has got out of hand? Reflect on this at a personal level and then expand the concept to encompass  society. Certainly it will not have escaped your notice that things need changing in a time when current events make you  wonder what is happening to  human behaviour. It is extremely important that you find a remedy amongst  people who can then share it and thus find the strength to do what has been needed for some time:<p>                                             <center><b>LOVING YOURSELVES</b></center><p>We always come back to the same concept of  warmth and light that arises from love. If we stop fighting each other and put all this energy into loving one another, nothing is impossible, not even returning the Earth and it&iacute;s inhabitant to an equilibrium which would be show immediate benefits l.<p>Never doubt the effect of group action. If we can begin with ideals and concepts in common then we can act in a way that will  circumvent a whole series of events that our current behaviour is generating.<p>We will indicate to you the first small actions to take so that you will have evidence of the truth of what we are saying and thus many hearts will begin to beat together forming energy waves which rippling through the cosmos will awaken many beings who will be able in their turn  to participate in this great revolution.<p>One starts from the negative and goes towards the positive with neither fear nor uncertainty, knowing that in opposition to that which is black one finds all that is white!<p>                                                    <center>Dior</center><p><a name="dior5"><b>Message five from Dior:</b></a><p>Dior, greetings, do you have  further indications to give us about Operation Katamar?<p>Operation Katamar:<br>Firstly, we must be sure to meditate on what has already been sent and decide what line to take and to whom the information is to be given, at least in this initial period.<p>The importance of this operation is in its intent to make Earth&iacute;s inhabitants aware of the incumbent  danger if  they don&iacute;t change their attitude towards the balance between the spiritual and material spheres. Not that this is insurmountable, there is  within us something we need to search for and to use<p>                                                      <center><b>CONSCIENCE</b></center><p>In order to bring about changes, it is indispensable that we be fully aware of the moment we are living  and of the opportunity that we have to share the means of raising consciousness, so that there are many souls working to the same end.<p>Let us take the heavens as a starting point and begin by raising our gaze, thus we will have taken the first step in telepathically joining Heaven and Earth.<p>Without a telepathic link there can not be disclosure without disclosure it is not possible to understand, even though we know at a feeling level, the precise danger we are in.<p>As I have already said it is not in not knowing that we can make ourselves feel easier, change our behaviour and   become stimuli for those who are less aware.<p>The micro-organisms are the first battle signs of something that Earth is no longer able to tolerate and  it is not by ignoring the warning signals that we can help, furthermore, we ourselves are in the same situation of something that we won&iacute;t have the possibility of transmitting nor making public.<p>The molecules that comprise the mineral kingdom are under pressure in that these micro-organisms attack the central parts of the nuclei and will cause major movement in many parts of the Earth, causing earthquakes, tsunami and enormous energetic oscillations which will oppose all that one tries to alter.<p>It is important to inhibit these alterations because if they  become  out of control they will spread an even heavier energy over the Earth, making the work of man much more difficult and creating fatigue.  As you can  see this energy has already begun to attack those who are most sensitive and is causing increasing difficulty of action and decision making.<p>Starting from a positive point of view in understanding the urgency of action necessary, we can behave in a way that those already attacked suffer not  from fear but can change their own energy in the following ways.<p><ol><li>  BY SPENDING MORE TIME IN CONTACT WITH  NATURE.<li>BY USING THE SEA AS A SOURCE OF ENERGY CAPABLE OF STOPPING THE    REPRODUCTION OF MICRO-ORGANISMS.<li> CONTROLLING IMMUNOLOGICAL FACTORS.<li>TAKING MINERALS THAT WILL BE EXPLAINED AS THE TIME COMES.<li>A BALANCED DIET USING LESS  SWEETENED FOOD.<li>ABSOLUTELY AVOIDING LONG PERIODS OF TIME IN CROWDED, CLOSED SPACES<li> AVOIDING ALCOHOL, SMOKING AND DRUGS.<li> EXERCISE IN THE FORM OF LONG WALKS IN THE OPEN AIR.</ol><p>These are the first basic concepts that can then be used by  individuals if you notice amongst your friends  an incidence of alterations to the nervous system, debilitation and lack of immune defences. They will need to understand and participate so that they don&iacute;t waste precious time in unsuccessful treatments but rather realise that this is a course of treatment involving loving themselves and which will lead to them becoming part of  the ranks of  those using a new way of thinking that will connect the Earth to the cosmic system.<p>It is extremely important to emphasise the positive aspect of the situation; that it will allow us to become aware of something within ourselves that will then move in an external direction.  Externally it is very important that you  always maintain a auric barrier so that the energy created internally doesn&iacute;t disperse, thus negating the work already done.<p>Never forget that it is important, extremely important to be in harmony with ourselves, having respect for the work that we are doing and if we find ourselves in a situation that blocks or opposes us to not desist in fighting for the energy that we have already acquired. <p>Our power, if that is the word that we want to use, lies in our determination to not let that which we have acquired at great cost to ourselves be appropriated.<p>Never forget the importance of  how you administer  your own energy  which,  when you fully understand , will mean that you will not permit the intrusion of anyone or anything..<p>This is the first rule if you want to participate in Operation Katamar.<p>I imagine that you have asked yourselves what Katamar means and I will explain it in the following way:<p>K= constellation<br>AMAR= of love<br>Thus I&iacute;m sure you will understand that in order to take part, it is indispensable that we begin with ourselves and that as you proceed you will  see how many positive changes occur in a short time from the moment that you decide to join in this crusade.<p>We invite you to have faith and to put yourselves at our disposal by means of telepathic contact, so that we have an ever increasing number of contacts that can disseminate this project.<p>Becoming a telepathic contact is important because it allows  us to be in cosmic harmony with beings who are dear to us and whom we want to help become cosmic in all senses. This alliance will raise the level of vibration of Earth and thus have the effect of transforming catastrophic events into peaceful ones.<p>    You don&iacute;t believe what I am saying? <p>   Why not try thinking that faith is something that causes transformations and makes them possible even for those who don&iacute;t believe. Have no doubt that the weight of the world can be lightened by means of contact with us. Being in contact means that we can send a new type of energy beam and creates the possibility to expanding energy of greater tone and strength and above all it will be possible to lighten your thoughts.<p>Do you see that if we hold our heads up we will tend to pick up ideas from above and not from below? Even if all of this is not possible in the space of a few days I can assure you that it is possible in the space of a few months.<p> If the energy begins to flow within you and when you become a conductor for this energy, the energy itself will become your  sponsor and have an effect on people, who without even knowing you will begin to resonate with you.<p>This resonation will be the means of contact in the future for  interplanetary telepathic transmissions.The sun, the moon and your whole solar system is prepared for this probable change in the Earth and is already transforming the  systems of genetic communications into something much grander which will include Earth by establishing its re-entry in the cosmic interplanetary link.<p>There are a whole series of energies ready to descend upon you but in order for this to occur it is necessary that you do what you already know is necessary,<p>                                               <center><b>LOVE YOURSELVES</b></center><p>It is only the energy that comes from this cosmic sentiment that will allow the elevation of the underlying heavy energy that is attacking Earth and transporting you ever more into the sphere of earthly negative energy.<p>If we are careful, we can arrange to have this negative earthly energy attacked by the micro-organisms, annulling them both in a single move. Fighting and destroying that which needs to be transformed in this case is possible and now I will explain myself more clearly.<p>It is not possible for you to destroy the negative earthly energy in that the only thing you can do is to transform it.  As regards the micro-organisms it is positive that they attach themselves to the negative earthly energy and by so doing form a single product which is possible for us to attack and destroy.<p>If you see that we can thus control the situation, I don&iacute;t think you will find it difficult to participate in this operation of  bringing together combining of these two forces.<p> I will finish her to give you a chance to reflect and we&iacute;ll good ahead another time.<p>                                                       DIOR<p>                                                <a href="cosmo.html#ashtar">Ashtar</a>, Adionesis, Samuele, Seth, <a href="cosmo.html#washta">Washta</a><p>                                             <hr>Return to:|   <a href="log.html">Log Index</a>  |  <a href="ethership.html">Portal Ether Ship</a>   |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>               |<p><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995-1996 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

By carrying out their task the sacred warriors will naturally and inevitably bring about the triumph of the universal religion on Earth. However, the restoration of sacred trust is not just a spiritual or mental task, but a biogeomagnetic one as well.<p>By living for centuries and even millennia out of the sacred round of life, humanity lost its own bio(life)geo(Earth)magnetism, that is, the sensibility of intuitively knowing the ways, sources and channels of the Earth. As a result of the mental bondage to the root structures of the mechanical clock and the irregular measure of the Gregorian calendar, humanity not only became depolarized, but through its unwitting excess of artificial electromagnetic instrumentation, it has created a profound disturbance in the planet's electromagnetic field. The erratic, entropically accelerating resonance of the 12:60 has spiritually and magnetically exhausted and made crazy the entire species. To speak of the return to the 13:20 frequency is also to speak of the magnetic repolarization of humanity.<p>This magnetic repolarization of humanity within the biosphere can only go hand in hand with the spiritual restoration of humanity within the court of universal culture. This court is represented by the restoration of the biological governing power of the species through the PAN Councils of Five. Through reconstruction of the governing order of the human family, according to equality of need of equal age groups, the human species will geomagnetically repolarize itself through biotelepathic songlines around the planet.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |<p>The repolarization and reconstitution of the human family, the reorganization of the human family according to the 13:20 timing frequency along planetary biotelepathic songlines will trigger the biosphere noosphere transition (the Glory), and bring into manifestation the planetary psi bank. The psi bank is the self-reflective telepathic regulator of all aspects of life for any given moment for any individual or collective groups of humans anywhere. This is what is meant by the spiritual unification of the species within the biosphere as the triumph of the universal religion of truth.<p>In this way ecology transcends itself in total spiritualization of biological intent. Creativity will once again be understood as the result of a reverence for beauty, which is the divine and sacred manifestation of all creation. Peace will restore culture as the source and origin of life.<p>How will all this be brought about? Through the determined and conscious application of the new 13:20 knowledge in all aspects of life carried out as the Four Years of the First World Peace, 1996-2000. A First World Peace can only be accomplished by the concerted and disciplined care of sacred warriors.<p><hr noshade><p><a name=magnetic><b>Section three:</b><p><h2>Earth Ascending: Magnetic Stabilization And The Four Years of the First World Peace</h2><p><blockquote>"He directs the affairsFrom the heavensTo the Earth: thenIt ascends Unto Him, on a DayThe measure of which isA thousand yearsOf your Reckoning."</blockquote><p>Holy Qur'an Sura 32: 5<p><hr><p><font size=5>T</font>he question of peace is not an ideological one, a matter of mental definition between one group of people and another. Nor is world peace, total global peace an issue between different groups of humankind holding unilaterally to different sectarian beliefs, but rather, between humankind and its environment, the biosphere. Even here we must see that just as different sectarian beliefs dividing one group of otherwise genetically closely related people from another are actually illusory substrata of consciousness to which a group of people have been led to believe is their sole reality, so the very notion of environment as something different from or distinguishable from human existence is also an illusion.<p> The reality is that the question of peace is a deeply psychophysical issue, or even more precisely, a psychobiomagnetic perturbation that has affected the species in an increasingly unconscious manner the more the species has adopted itself to the false timing frequency, 12:60. The result is today, that as with any alienation from natural sources or ways, the alienated becomes its own victim, by means and ways which it can hardly imagine.<p>Because of the power residing in the human mind, projected ignorantly through a wide range and species of machine artifacts and tools, humankind has actually geologically impacted the biosphere of which he is an integral part to the detriment of his continued existence. This he has achieved through electromagnetic, technological and chemical-atomic experimentation that has increased the dissonance of the resonant field of the planet while creating giant erosions in the whole systems operation of the biogeochemical processes by which the biosphere maintains its stability.<p>Not only has radioactive waste, and other forms of petrochemical pollution penetrated the oceans as well as the bio-inert surface and atmosphere of the Earth's outermost envelope, the biosphere, but systems of satellites, radar and the proliferation of all sorts of electromagnetic information waves of an increasingly random and accelerated nature are in the process of even more seriously affecting the actual resonance of the planet. The sum effect of these electromagnetic disturbances is creating the imminent potential of a major electromagnetic, or worse, geomagnetic break down of the biosphere and the planetary structure itself.<p> Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |<p>As with all technology instrumented since the dawn of the industrial revolution responsible for the creation of the artificial planetary sheathe, the technosphere, the new electromagnetic devices are never tested for their long term social effects, nor in terms of an understanding of the Earth as a whole system. The intoxification of the momentum of the speed of technology combined with spurious profit motive and/or military defense issues are used as the rationale for the implementation of whatever latest "advance" in technology may come along.<p> The GPS (General Positioning System) satellite system, 24 satellites straddling the outermost Van Allen Radiation belt, and the HAARP (High Active Auroral Research Project) utilizing the two belts of the ionosphere and the aurora borealis, are the two most insidious examples of technological artifacts interfering with the planet's electromagnetic and geomagnetic fields. This is not to mention the unconscious or subliminal effects which the 12:60 micro- and extra-low frequency oscillations incessantly bombarded by these systems might have on the biopsychic field of the sum of living matter itself.<p>The climatic conditions of the whole system Earth are both protected and regulated by the two electromagnetic subsystems of the Van Allen Radiation Belts (2,000-11,000 miles above the surface) and the ionosphere(60-70 miles above the surface). By utilizing the GPS and HAARP systems for mercenary and meaningless military experimentation and materialistic exploratory greed, 12:60 resonant interferences are introduced into the functioning of these two sensitive controlling electromagnetic subsystems. As a result the entire biosphere is being subjected to a whole systems dissonance and perturbation of an unprecedented nature.<p>The whole systems level of perturbation caused by these satellite systems to the electromagnetic field only compounds the alienation and loss of geomagnetic sensibility that now afflicts the entire human race, pushing the psychobiomagnetic illness of civilization to the final point of its own biogeochemical self-combustion. While the increase in pressure of humankind by its exponential acceleration of population and machine is at the increasing cost of other species (at the rate of 200 a day), the species own geomagnetic entropy is now irreversibly out of control.<p> One must imagine this picture: close to six billion two-legged genetic filaments (there were only two billion hardly sixty years ago!) vibrating in their accelerated velocity machines, burning untold amounts of petrochemicals, exposing themselves to untold amounts of electromagnetic radiation and chemical pollution of all kinds, crowding themselves evermore densely and intensely into urban centers, placing virtually total dependence upon electronic information systems spewing a vast disorder of information bits daily into the collective mental field, needing ever more police control as the resultant insanity of their loss of geomagnetic sensibility increases the spiral of violence and terrorism, incapable of being controlled for the sole reason of the artificial intoxicant called money, itself controlled by a minute elite of bankers and their political spokes people whose actual number constitutes far less than one percent of the species.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |<p>It is for this reason that peace is not an ideological issue, a game of chess played by banker-politicians and the invisible corporate elite of an armaments industry that no one seems to be able to control. But in all actuality, peace is a matter of biospheric survival. Peace is the culture of the biosphere.<p>What has been called civilization has now played itself out. There is no reason any longer to perpetrate it for any reason or in anyway whatsoever. The only solution is to stop everything and redirect the species. This, of course, is an act totally contrary to the entropic momentum of the technological monetary base of civilization as it has now come to be constituted. Yet, it is the only scientific and ethical solution, a solution fully comprehended and put forth by the Four Years of the First World Peace, whose main order is the psychobiomagnetic repolarization of the human race.<p>It is altogether possible that unforeseen effects of the electromagnetic and geomagnetic disturbance could set off the total breakdown of civilization as it is now constituted. Such an event or sequence of events would in no way lessen but only increase the need for the immediate implementation of the First World Peace. Civilization (literally: living in cities) has cost humanity its culture and its sanity. Civilization has devolved into institutionalized barbarism. The loss of civilization will only be to humanity's credit, restoring to the species the need to repolarize itself geomagnetically and reintroduce itself to the principle of cultivation, both of self and environment. While civilization leads to waste and is indeed the culture of waste, cultivation comes from and leads to culture.<p>Culture is intrinsic to the natural order and is a function of being in harmony with the cycles appropriate to one's biological order. Culture is how the sublime and unseen processes of evolution further the cause of an intelligence both compassionate and divine at its root. True culture is peace, great peace, creative peace, universal peace. Culture cannot exist without peace. Peace cannot be furthered without culture. Where there is any view of money or monetary gain, there cannot be culture but only the seeds of war.<p>The time has come to resurrect the great vision of the Roerich Peace Pact which understands culture to be an indispensable property of the biosphere natural functioning, the real key to human and planetary survival. The time has come to courageously use this instrument of peace as the final hope and replacement for the failed League of Nations, and its successor, the United Nations. Unity which is peace can only come about through culture. Culture is the living breath and blood of people. Nations are only abstract fictions held together by money and false hope.<p> Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |<p>For this reason, the four year plan of the First World Peace is the mandatory solution that must be followed if there is to be survival of the species and peace and unity are to be restored within the biosphere. Assuming the return to the natural 13:20 timing frequency following the disastrous but, from the point of view of the biosphere-noosphere transition, necessary 12:60 timing frequency deviation, the four years of the First World Peace will establish humanity in the new common time of thirteen moons. In this way the biosphere's naturally ordained rhythm for humanity will already be a conscious act without precedence, bringing humanity closer to the biosphere-noosphere transition and the manifestation of the psi bank.<p>To speak of the occurrence of a choice made by humanity to consciously and fundamentally change its course by changing its calendar and its timing frequency is to speak of an Earth ascending, the millennial dream of Earth evolving toward its ultimate spiritual goal, heaven on Earth. This spiritual goal, heaven on Earth, is really also the profound spiritual sentiment underlying the original inspiration of the ecology movement: restoration of Earth to the original garden. This is no longer such a fantastic idea. It is spiritual biospheric survival that demands we make it true.<p> <hr>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <a href="arguelles.html">Jose Arguelles</a>  |  <a href="biospher.html">Biospheric Rights</a>  |  <a href="messenger.html">The Portal Messenger</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>   |<p><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

Unlike the scientific experiment that produced the atomic bomb and its off-spring, the insidious proliferation of a culture of fear and a technology of dubious radioactive waste, the Four Years of the First World Peace is a non-toxic experiment in time, whose worst side-effects will be the loss of the culture of money. <p>This experiment is predicated on the principles of the biosphere, first fully articulated by V.I. Vernadsky between the years 1926-1944. It was Vernadsky who understood the total nature of the biosphere as a whole system whose evolutive principles were clearly at a point of biogeochemical climax. The instrument of the cause of this climax, is, of course, the human species, whose thought and machine technology have geologically impacted and changed the entire biosphere. The sum affects of human thought on the biosphere, Vernadsky referred to as the biosphere-noosphere transition, which in Vernadsky's view at the time of his death, 1945, was imminent.<p>According to Vernadsky, the evolutionary purpose of the transition of the biosphere to the noosphere, the Earth's mental envelope, is to bring on a new geological era, the Psychozoic era. In this era, humanity will actually become a positively transforming geological force. Psychozoic literally means "psychic or soul life." Hence, this dawning era can only be one in which humanity has become unified in peace and has evolved or mutated into a state of spiritual planetary grandeur. To be genuine, the advent of the noosphere, must involve an act of collective conscious will on the part of humanity, and cannot be just a haphazard result of circumstances due to humanity's erroneous course.<p> Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |<p>Fortunately with the First Planetary Congress of Biospheric Rights and the formalized adoption of the Thirteen Moon Calendar, the declaration of Biospheric Rights, and the plan and intent of the First World Peace, the conscious moment of human collective will has arrived. In this way, participation in the Congress of Biospheric Rights is a collective evolutionary choice, making conscious and coherent what had been unconscious and incoherent. This in itself is a manifestation of the cohering principle of magnetic resonance by which the psi bank is to be triggered.<p>The articulation of the guiding evolutionary mechanism of the biosphere, the planetary psi bank, combined with the principles of the timing frequencies, complete Vernadsky's pioneering scientific work on the nature of the biosphere and the biosphere-noosphere transition.<p> The nature and existence of the psi bank and the investigation and discovery of the timing frequencies were all part of the same research process (Earth Ascending, 1984; The Mayan Factor, 1987; Dreamspell, 1991; Telektonon, 1995; The Call of Pacal Votan, 1996). It is the understanding and analysis of the timing frequencies that makes precise the moment of the biosphere-noosphere transition. It is the knowledge of the psi bank and its mapping in relation to the Earth's electromagnetic and geomagnetic fields that, combined with the natural timing cycles, allows an exact correspondence to further the biomutational sequence known as the four years of the First World Peace: the trigger of the biosphere-noosphere transition, the magnetic re-education of humanity and the manifestation of the psi bank.<p>To understand the biosphere-noosphere transition and the advent of the psi bank, we must rehearse again the holonomic principles which govern the universal order. Holonomy means law governing whole systems. Holonomy implies levels of guiding intelligence from higher to lower orders as well as an evolutionary return to higher orders of intelligence. This defines the universal order: one vast cycle of turning, again and again. Time is the frequency which governs the different stages of holonomy in its universal order.<p>The biosphere is the whole living system operating within the larger whole planetary order, Earth, itself a sub-system of the larger stellar order of the sun and its planets. The solar system, too, is but a subset of the even larger whole system called galaxy. Our galaxy, one of countless millions, is the main organizing component of the universe. Being sub-sets of the larger order universe, all whole systems from the biospheric to the galactic are characterized by levels of order in which coherence is maintained, despite appearances of randomness and chaos. This coherence is a function of the principle of magnetic resonance. <p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |<p>Magnetic resonance is the principle by which an organism or organic whole remains inseparable from its environment. When an organism loses it magnetic resonance it loses its integrity and disintegrates. The principle of magnetic resonance is maintained and regulated by the timing frequency. Within Earth's biosphere, the natural 13:20 timing frequency regulates magnetic resonance in the form of cycles. All living organisms exhibit cyclic behavior, the duration of the cycle being determined by the size and function of the organism within the order of the biosphere. A fly and a turtle experience vastly different cycles. The same is true of the sub-order, human.<p>To speak of an organism is to speak of the whole organism within its larger governing cycles and not just its individual members. Since life in the biosphere is the sum of its living matter in the form of its myriad sub-species, the biosphere, too, exhibits its magnetic resonance, and its evolutionary cycles pointing in the direction of ever-greater self-reflective intelligence. It is evident that the human species is currently the biosphere's most evolved agent of self-reflective intelligence, and the one most greatly affecting its future evolutionary condition.<p>The geological impact of the human species within its larger self-regulating order of the biosphere has actually been due to its departure from the principle of magnetic resonance due to habituation to the artificial 12:60 timing frequency. Deviation from the natural timing frequency through involvement in civilization, at first a relatively slow process, nonetheless created a set of secondary habits by which the civilized were set apart from the non-civilized members of the species. FFrom the biosphere's point of view , this is an illusory distinction, but one which is experienced as a mental reality of profound consequences. The non-civilized, actually were those members maintaining themselves in magnetic resonance with the natural cycles. <p>However, with the codification and consequent social institutionalization of the 12:60 timing frequency resulting from the Gregorian Calendar and the mechanical clock, the departure from the principle of magnetic resonance became species-wide. This has resulted in a condition of chronic magnetic destabilization compounded by entropic acceleration: exponential propagation and multiplication both of the species and of its artificial systems of dependence, the machine. The sum product of this condition is known as the technosphere, a self-habituated bubble of mental and artificial systems, which, being taken as the only possible mode of being for the species, has brought about the apocalyptic nightmare in which it now finds itself.<p> <hr>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <a href="arguelles.html">Jose Arguelles</a>  |  <a href="biospher.html">Biospheric Rights</a>  |  <a href="messenger.html">The Portal Messenger</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>   |<p><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

Let it be repeated: peace is not an ideological agreement having no actual scientific basis in the order of the biosphere. Peace is the culture of the biosphere. Through chronic magnetic destabilization and entropy the human has disrupted the peace of the biosphere. Human has systematically disrupted and even destroyed many of the other living orders of the biosphere (the biopsychic field), as well as, and even more dangerously, interfered with and disrupted the biosphere's self-regulating electromagnetic and gravitational fields of resonance. Therefore, the only solution to the disastrous complex of disorder created by the human in its institutionalized 12:60 frequency bubble, is a total scientific rearrangement of the human biospheric order based on the correct 13:20 timing frequency leading to the magnetic repolarization of the species.<p> Since damage to the whole order has been pin-pointed and localized in a deviation in the timing frequency, the first step is to desist altogether from the deviating frequency creating the chronic disorder and magnetic destabilization. This is the purpose of the calendar change: to put an end to the instrument by which unconscious habituation to disorder and irregularity have come about.<p>Since the disorder has been species wide, the calendar change must be implemented species wide. In order to be effective, there must be a species wide notice of the cancellation of the functioning of the old calendar, a momentary halt in all activity(universal cease-fire), and an immediate reprogramming beginning with introduction and use of the new calendar. Being without precedence, this very act in itself is of historic and evolutionary significance assisting in the biosphere-noosphere transition and the advent of the psi bank.<p> Because the new calendar represents a return to the natural 13:20 timing frequency, the calendar change must be complemented by a program for the magnetic repolarization of the entire human race. Why and how?<p> The nature of the damage to the species and the biosphere is comprehensive and magnetically the disturbance is volatile and precipitous. At the same time this condition, the human-machine biogeochemical combustion, is in its entirety a function of the evolving order of the biosphere. Since the biosphere is self-healing, the process of returning to the natural timing frequency contains within it the self-healing necessary for the safe passage though this final biomutational sequence.<p> Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |<p>The intrinsic order underlying the biosphere-noosphere transition requires an equal level of order from within the human species which necessitates a dramatic break from all past habits and conditions. The difference between humanity in the artificial order of the 12:60 and humanity consciously placing itself within the natural order of the 13:20 timing frequency is inconceivably vast. It is a change that can only come about through a combination of moral revulsion and an awakening of intelligence that naturally leads to a willingness to participate in an untried adventure for the establishment of a true culture of peace: the four years of the First World peace.<p>This can be accomplished through the articulation of a collective moral voice declaring that world peace is a scientific experiment involving the participation of every member of the human race.<p> This experiment has a duration of four years and like all scientific experiments must be precisely carried out. Within the galactic order of time, of which the new calendar is a supremely harmonious expression, four years is the minimum whole cycle necessary for the human race to experience biospheric rejuvenation, and at the same time to trigger the biosphere-noosphere transition and the advent of the psi bank.<p> The biosphere-noosphere transition is the natural consequence of humanity subjecting itself to the new calendar. Since the mental order brought about by following the new calendar is the 13:20 frequency, the order of natural telepathy of all species within the biosphere, the over-all social reorganization program necessary for magnetic stabilization can also be consciously engineered according to the matrix of the psi bank. The psi bank, the governing order of the biosphere and the noosphere, can only be triggered telepathically.<p>The psi bank matrix consists of four plates or membranes, each one straddling the planet from pole to pole and contiguous with the electromagnetic field. The activation of each plate occurs in conjunction with one solar orbit or annual round, measured as thirteen moons, plus free day. Since the plates are polar in nature, the activation of each of the four plates over four years occurs in a precise two-part magnetic polar process. That is, for any year, the first half year, Magnetic Moon 1-Resonant Moon 14, the magnetic pole of the northern hemisphere is telepathically activated, while the second half of the year, Resonant Moon 15-Cosmic Moon 28, the magnetic pole of the southern hemisphere is telepathically activated. Free day is the moment of magnetic equilibrium and discharge.<p>Return to:|  <a href="#top">Top</a>  |<p>While the actual bipolar telepathic exercise can be carried out by relatively small groups of people in both hemispheres in strict observance of a daily pattern followed in accordance with the Telektonon, it does require that the rest of the human race both know about the experimental exercise and at the same time participate in the entire social reorganization program known as the four years of the First World Peace. By the time the experiment is in its final year, the entire human race will be participating in the telepathic bipolar magnetic restabilization exercise. In this way the scientific experiment of world peace will end successfully and the true order of universal peace be henceforth consciously re-established within the Earth's biosphere. This is the only intelligent way to end the century of total war: total peace, the opening to a new millennium of universal peace.<p><hr><p><b>The Four Years of the First World Peace and the PSI Membrane Correspondences</b><p><ul> <li>First Year, Blue Self-Existing Storm, psi membrane one, Afro-Eurasian PlateFirst half year: Northern Hemisphere transmits blue Spring; Second half year: Southern Hemisphere transmits red Autumn <li>Second Year, Yellow Overtone Seed, psi membrane two, Pacific Plate First half year, Northern Hemisphere transmits yellow summer Second half year Southern Hemisphere transmits white winter <li>First Two Years of First World Peace, Alpha Phase Complete Bioregional Conversion template in order, 12:60 frequency depolarized and extinguished; 13:20 establishes and releases collective human mind into biospheric order of Universal Telepathy.<li>Third Year, Red Rhythmic Moon, psi membrane three, American Plate First half year: Northern Hemisphere transmits red autumn Second half year Southern Hemisphere transmits blue spring <li>Fourth Year, White Resonant Wizard, psi membrane four, Atlantic Plate First half year Northern Hemisphere transmits white winter Second half year Southern Hemisphere transmits yellow summer <li>Second Two Years of First World Peace, Omega Phase Complete Biospheric Redemption Template in order, 13:20 magnetic repolarization of humanity realized as terrestrial electromagnetic bipolar stabilization.</ul><p> Scientific experiment concluded, world peace established as universal peace of biosphere noosphere transition.

This force has been called the Magnet of Be-ness.<p> The Magnet of Be-Ness cannot be known in the dissonance of the 12:60. Only in the perfect harmony of 13:20 can humanity nurture itself spiritually on the Magnet of Be-ness. Once released from the 12:60 into the 13:20, humanity will realign itself like so many filaments to the two poles of the Magnet of Be-ness, experienced as the North and South Poles of planet Earth. Unified by the Magnet of Be-ness, humanity will spring Earth to her splendor in waves of telepathic love.<p> Whales, songbirds and all communities of creation incorporate time through the integrity of magnetic resonance. This is unconscious Attunement to the Magnet of Be-ness.<p>Now humans are to do the same, but consciously. This is to be carried out through the Invisible College, the home school for humanity's magnetic re-education. The Invisible College will administer the creation of the new planetary community through the four-fold turning of the magnet of be-ness. Home school replaces disincorporation of time through 12:60 jobs. With the new time, the 12:60 job concept is over. <p><b>Listen to the galactic message of the Magnet of Be-Ness:</b><p> "Return to your homes, humans, and work out your little lives with dignity and honor! Repair your families, and learn again about the cultivation of the Earth. All rights and privilege will be paid for by the Earth Trust; all education will be granted by the PAN.

Each year the Magnet follows the four part color harmonic. <p>The first two years, Blue and Yellow, complete the sequence of depolarizing the 12:60 and re polarizing the 13:20.<p> The second two years , Red and White, purify, stabilize and discharge the telepathic bipolar magnetic power of humanity according to the power of the 13:20 frequency.<p>This is called engineering the mind shift according to Telektonon, the yoga of the unification of the collective dream body in time, the universal quintessence that liberates all beings simultaneously.

Triumph of the religion of truth, the universal religion of Earth. <p>Fourth year, Divine Source manifests fourth-dimensional heptagonon of mind. Power of human mind, will, and spirit tested in bipolar telepathic magnetic discharge: manifestation of psi bank; noosphere attained.<p> Blue Galactic Storm is the collective telepathically unified human graduation party.

Tests conducted in November 1992 by Teralab Engineers of Salt lake City, Utah.<p><b>Product description</b><p>Water flows into the Hydro Spray shower filter through the water inlet, fills the water staging chamber, and is forced down out of the twin turbo jets. The water exits the jets in a clockwise direction and picks up the KDF media. The water mixes and swirls with the KDF as it circulates inside the filter compartment.

This Lakota Sioux phrase has suddenly come into common usage. It appears on T-shirts, bumber stickers, new-age journals, and native American publications, among other places. Reminds me of when the incomparable jazz musician Charlie "Yardbird" Parker died, and overnight the grafitti "BIRD LIVES" appeared all over New York City, and elsewhere.<p>Our intuition tells that there is a connection between us and the exterior world - that there is a relationship between all things in creation. We feel this in our hearts, but intellectually this relationship is difficult to grasp.<p>"All my Relations" in the Lakotta sense, refers not only to our blood relatives, including the birds and animals, but to plants, rocks, sun, moon, stars, in other words, the totality of the Creator's creation. It is difficult to truly understand our relation to a star or a flower. There is a simple way to help us understand this universal relationship, and there are many ways or paths to this sort of enlightenment. One way is based on the simplest of mathematics.<p><IMG SRC="hank.gif" align="left">Leonardo Fibonacci, a 13th century Pisan mathematician/astronomer, formulated a beautifully simple progression of numbers. The series starts with 1. The next number is also 1. Adding these two numbers produces 2. Adding the preceeding produces 3. 2+3==5. 5+3=8. 8+5=13, and so on.<P>The ratio between each succeeding pair of numbers (1:1.618+) describes the ratioo of the "Golden Section", a famos classical proportion, as well as the growth rate of many organisms, as seen in the seedhead of the sunflower, the end view of a pine cone, growth rings of clam shells, etc. The Fibonacci series of numbers is found over and over in plant growth. Looking at the seedhead of a sunflower, one will see that the seeds are arranged in 55 clockwise spirals, and 89 or 34 counterclockwise spirals, numbers adjacent to each other in the series. Likewise, in a daisy, pine cone and other natural forms, their structure is based on a combination of numbers from the Fibonacci series.<p>The Golden Section is expressed simplest as a rectangle of this ratio (i.e. 89x144, or any part of adjacent numbers in the series), and is often used by artists to proportion their canvases. Much classical Greek sculpture depicted the human form in terms of the proportions of the Golden Section.<p>Given a choice of many rectangles, thin, wide, or squarish, tests have proven that most people will choose the rectangle expressing the 1:1.618 proportion, demonstrating, perhaps, an intuitive understanding of this universal relationship.<p><IMG SRC="hank.gif" align="right">The Golden Section, expressed expressed as a logarithmic spiral, is not only seen in flower seedheads, but in spiral galaxies and the human and animal form. It is a universal pattern in nature. At least one theory suggests that electrical potential and life potential both follow Fibonacci's pattern.<p>Although Fibonacci formulated his series in the 13th century, the relationship between living things and geometry was observed by pre-historic people. Their observations, spirals, and other forms, were carved in bone or painted on cave walls at least 20,000 yeas B.C.E.<p>This is but one of the connections between us, the stars, and all living things.

In     following a time apart from the rest of creation, humanity has     compounded this manifest error by exceeding its proportion,     bringing devastation to the biosphere, and sealing its own doom.<p>     To assure the continuity of the biosphere, the web of life in all     of its biodiversity, and to finally assume our rightful role     within the biosphere, we, the people of the Earth, do now declare     and recognize there to be a new covenant for the reunification of     humanity within the biosphere, the Covenant of Biospheric Rights.     This divinely ordained new covenant supersedes in all of its laws     and principles of self-governance and autonomy all of the     now-constituted laws of human civilization.<p>     In recognition that the currently constituted form of planetary     human civilization is a secondary fiction, the compound manifest     error of following artificial, mechanistic 12:60 time, all of     which has caused humanity to deviate grossly from the divine plan     and natural order of the biosphere, we, the people of the Earth,     affirm the foundation of the new covenant to be the indisputable     instrument known as the Thirteen Moon Calendar, and its means of     implementation, the Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Plan,     inclusive of the Pax Cultura-Pax Biospherica.<p>     The essence of this universal peace plan calls for immediate     replacement of the erroneous and unnatural timing device of the     twelve-month Gregorian Calendar with the biologically accurate     Thirteen Moon Calendar. In following this new calendar, humanity     will have taken the first step to return to the natural order and     sacred principles of membership of life within the biosphere.<p>     In recognition of the fact that all currently constituted laws and     institutions are functions of the Gregorian Calendar, the First     Planetary Congress of Biospheric Rights of the Thirteen Moon     Calendar Change Peace Movement empowers itself to legitimately     begin the peace creating process of bioregional     deinstitutionalization and deprivatization for the liberation of     humanity into the biosphere. In view of the profound and     fundamental change implied by replacing calendars, the     self-empowered People's Autonomous Committees do set forth a     series of resolutions to begin the arduous and heroic act of     converting current human civilization into a culture of universal     peace.<p>     We, the people of the Earth, hereby affirm that in assuming the     responsibility of a new covenant, by its nature, divinely     ordained, we assume a sacred duty. We, the people of the Earth,     accept this sacred duty. Henceforth, we, the peoples of planet     Earth do swear to live by the new Covenant of Biospheric Rights     and the Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Plan.<p><IMG align="left" SRC="smpacal.gif"><a name=war><b>People's Resolution To Delegitimize War</b></a><p>All the wars we have fought, and continue to fight, are products     of the old time. All of the future, henceforth, is a blessing of     the new time. In the new time there is no war. There is no place     for the recognition of legitimized aggression. In the new time,     peace prevails. The victory of peace abolishes, once and for all,     the instrument of war as a legitimate means for mediating human     conflict. Lacking all art, war as a medium of communication is     henceforth delegitimized and desanctioned as a valid recourse for     human conduct. In delegitimizing war, the power vested in nation     states is also delegitimized, for it is the nation states that     have the power to 'declare war.<p>     The activity of war is the technological testing ground of 12:60     industrial civilization. Once we have demonstrated that we can     control war, which is nothing but legalized terrorism, we will be     able to eliminate terrorism and domestic violence altogether.     Eliminating the need for war, we will eliminate the need for the     technologies that have created war as an inhumane and immoral     value, replacing them instead with the innate creative faculties     and powers vested in our own biology and culture.<p>     The first step to eliminate war is to declare the Victory of     Universal Peace which is rooted in the new time of Universal     Peace, the time of the thirteen moons. The Victory of Universal     Peace will become effective world-wide, Thirteen Moon Victory Day,     Red Cosmic Moon, Crystal Moon 28, Third Year of Prophecy,     (Gregorian, June 26, 1996). This date marks the conclusion of the     Biospheric Amnesty. Henceforth, all institutions will begin     voluntary cooperative peacetime deregulation into the conventions     of the thirteen moons.<p>     To enforce and manifest the Victory of Universal Peace and the     establishment of the new Covenant of Biospheric Rights, the     Roerich Peace Pact and Banner of Peace (1935) are invoked and     extended to include protection of the entire biosphere. The     biosphere itself is the cradle of all human culture and artistic     activity. This means that Banners of Peace will be planted or     raised at all arsenals of war, toxic waste dumps, current battle     zones, polluting industries, ghettos and shanty towns, as well as     parks, schools, government, historic and cultural sites, and     wilderness regions of every kind in a collective demonstration by     the peoples of the planet of upholding the primacy of the     biosphere and the concurrent neutralization and delegitimization     of all secondary fictions and instruments of war, whether against     nature or humanity itself. Especially those industrial plants     currently engaged in the manufacture and selling of lethal     instruments of mass destruction will be identified, and served     notice to immediately close down or begin conversion to peaceful     activity.<p>     Proclamations of the Victory of Universal Peace will announce the     "52 Days of Victory," Crystal Moon 28, Third Year of Prophecy, to     Magnetic Moon 22, Fourth Year of Prophecy, (Gregorian: June     26-August 16, 1996). These 52 days of universal cease fire and     cessation of all sales of instruments of war will be accompanied     by artistic, cultural, and educational programs of all kinds     informing and uplifting the people regarding the new time of     universal peace. At the center of these "52 Days of Victory," will     be the Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. The Games will be used     to showcase the meaning of peace as a creative form whose     spiritual value transcends all bias and unifies all peoples in a     higher vision.<p>     Add: People's Resolution to Take Back the Planet     (See Appendix: "Pan Victory Over G-7")<p><IMG align="left" SRC="smpacal.gif"><a name=vatican><b>People's Resolution To The Vatican</b></a><p>n order to give full support and provide an assured swift     universal entry into the new time of the thirteen moons, a     People's Resolution calls upon the Vatican to relinquish its     support and ownership of the Gregorian Calendar, effective Crystal     Moon 28, Thirteen Moon Victory Day. In calling upon the Vatican to     replace the unnatural Gregorian Calendar in support of the     biologically accurate Thirteen Moon Calendar, the people will be     assisting the Vatican in owning and admitting to the greatest     error it has committed, perpetration of the false-time Gregorian     calendar which, since its institution in AD1582, can rightfully be     called the calendar of colonialism. To end the age of colonialism,     put an end to its calendar.<p>     Appeals will be made to Pope John Paul II and the Vatican Council     to cooperate fully with the Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace     Movement in setting the world straight in this unprecedented     calendar reform. A Delegate from the Vatican will be invited to     attend the First Planetary Congress of Biospheric Rights. Failure     to respond to, or cooperate with, the Thirteen Moon Calendar     Change Peace Movement will place the Vatican, along with the other     nation states, in violation of the biosphere.<p><hr>Return to:  |   <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <a href="pacal.html#contents">Planetary Congress Table of Contents</a>  |  <a href="arguelles.html">Jose Arguelles</a>  |  <a href="messenger.html">The Portal Messenger</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index2.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>   |<p><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995-1996 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

The planetary boundary dissolving ceremony is     to occur on Crystal Moon 28, Red Cosmic Moon, Thirteen Moon     Victory Day, (Gregorian June 26, 1996), at Four Corners, North     America, the point at which four currently constituted states     meet: Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. The planetary     boundary dissolving ceremony will inaugurate the "52 Days of     Victory" of universal peace with a collective autonomous act     exemplifying the sacred restoration of human trust.<p>     To implement this Resolution, we, the people of planet Earth,     exercising our biospheric right of free will, do hereby put forth     a call for a minimum of 144, 000 people to gather for one day to     conduct the planetary boundary dissolving ceremony in a simple and     coherent demonstration of human artistic responsibility. The     144,000 will form a large circle with a human cross connecting the     four cardinal points of the circle to the central point, 'four     corners.' By drumming and holding silence within the form of the     sacred seal of the Earth, impregnating themselves and the Earth     with a sacred bond of mutual trust, all previous humanly     conceived, historically binding contracts will be ceremonially     repealed, while the very act of orderly dispersal and departure     will constitute the ritual release from and dissolution of all     national and state boundaries as a needless mental fiction no     longer in accord with the organic order of the biosphere.<p>     Coordinated by members of the Rainbow Nation, people will be     bussed in and out of the Four Corners on the same day from nearby     major cities to create an orderly situation assuring that no     damage will be done to the environment. Full cooperation is sought     from all parties involved, but especially from those of the Ute,     Apache, Hopi, and Navajo peoples whose indigenous homelands     constitute the original Four Corners bioregion.<p>     Four Corners is in reality the heart of Turtle Island, the     indigenous people's name for North America, and by extension     planet Earth. By dissolving the 12:60 boundaries and belief     systems inherent in the notion of 'nation states', the heart of     Turtle Island will be released into the new and natural time of     thirteen moons, inaugurating the return of Earth Sovereignty, the     biospherically unified, bioregionally organized peoples of the     dominion of Timeship Earth 2013.<p>     AD 2013 is the time given for the goal of restoring, through the     operations of an all-inclusive Planet Art Network, the biosphere     of planet Earth to its original garden nature, thereby placing     humanity once again in a state of primordial spiritual simplicity,     complemented by a superior evolved intelligence operating as one     mind. People in other parts of the planet are invited to     participate in similar spontaneous ceremonies in support of this     sacred planetary boundary dissolving ceremony at Four Corners.<p>     We, the people of planet Earth, recognize the seriousness and     profound implications of this ceremonial initiation of entry into     the new time and of the beginning necessary repeal of all of the     laws and institutions of the old time and the old order. In     particular, this planetary boundary dissolving ceremony repeals     not only the Gregorian Calendar (AD1582), but also repeals the     Papal Doctrine of Discovery (AD1452) and all consequent     'historical treaties', contracts, and doctrines held by any and     all nation states intended to claim and dispossess all land     originally inhabited by indigenous peoples.<p>     <IMG align="left" SRC="smpacal.gif"><a name=time><b>Proclamation of the Dominion of Time and Preamble Establishing            the Planet Art Network as the Biospheric Social Form</b></a><p>Whereas the acceptance of the new Thirteen Moon Calendar and its     attendant new Covenant of Biospheric Rights liberates humanity     from all of the conventions and treaties held by the now dissolved     and desanctioned old Gregorian twelve-month calendar, and whereas     this calendar change is registered as a profound and sacred change     in the course of human affairs, let it be proclaimed, henceforth,     that in following the Thirteen Moon Calendar humanity has taken     its first step in returning to full biospheric membership and is,     therefore, awarded entry into the Dominion of Time, the     self-existing, self-organizing collective intelligence of the     biosphere.<p>     As the governing force of the biosphere, the Dominion of Time     establishes an architecture of natural orders whose interlocking     cycles transform the biosphere into a living work of art. The     Dominion of Time operates by a single synchronization frequency,     13:20, a cycle of thirteen galactic tones combined with a cycle of     20 solar frequencies. Because the Thirteen Moon Calendar is cycled     by the thirteen galactic tones into the larger matrix of the 13:20     timing frequency, in accepting this calendar humanity is     immediately re-entered into the Dominion of Time, and hence given     the privilege to which full membership in the biosphere now     entitles the human species.<p>     Incumbent upon this privilege is understanding the role within the     biosphere of the human species, liberated once and for all from     false 12:60 time. 13:20 time is art. The biosphere is actually a     living work of art. The biosphere is subject to the one law of     time, summed up in the universal equation of time: T(E)= Art. In     the equation, which sums up the command of the unifying law of the     Dominion of Time, T= 13:20 frequency; (E)=bioenergy unit or one     organism in its daily cycle; and Art = the multiplication,     propagation, and transformation of E(energy) according to the form     ratios of T(time), the 13:20 frequency. Obedient to the unifying     law of time, the biosphere is inevitably a work of art, nature's     supreme achievement. The reality of the biosphere as a living work     of art commands the human role within the biosphere.<p>     This human role within the biosphere is henceforth constituted as     the Planet Art Network (PAN), the sacred order organizing humans     for maintaining, embellishing and improving upon the biosphere as     a living work of art. It is the role of PAN to determine the new     sacred form and goal of human society for seven generations to     come, following the new Covenant trial period to AD 2013.     Henceforth, the biospheric Dominion of Time will be known as the     Dominion of Timeship Earth 2013.<p>     Being divinely ordained, the Dominion of Time empowers the     Planetary Congress of Biospheric Rights to establish as of     Thirteen Moon Victory Day, Crystal 28, Third Year of Prophecy     (Gregorian, June 26, 1996), the sacred order of the Planet Art     Network as the biospherically ordained human body to instrument     the conscious reorganization of human society in accord with the     new Covenant of Biospheric Rights and Thirteen Moon Calendar     Change Peace Plan.<p><IMG align="left" SRC="smpacal.gif"><a name=pan><b>People's Resolution for the Empowerment of the Planet Art Network:            Sacred Order for the Reorganization of Human Society</b></a><p>We, the people of planet Earth, in order to assure a clear shift     in the goals of the human social order, do hereby empower the     sacred order of the Planet Art Network to oversee the victory of     culture, which is peace, as the goal and purpose of human society     in accord with the new Covenant and Thirteen Moon Calendar.     Henceforth art and not war will be the ultimate recourse for     resolving human conflict. The sacred order of PAN, through     fostering a bioregional biodiversity of culture, assumes the     principle responsibility for reestablishing the human harmony     within the greater harmony of the biosphere as a living work of     art.<p>     Incorporated into PAN will be the long-term goal of redirecting     humanity into its role as the maintainer and improver of the     biospheric art form; to establish all the new social forms and     norms in accord with the new Covenant and Thirteen Moon Calendar;     and to assume responsibility for the design of the programs for     converting from industrial age "job" deployment of human energy to     Earth Sovereign activities that transform current materials and     materialist labor into artistic forms and activities, thereby     assisting in the conversion from a culture of entertainment, where     there is no time for art, to a culture of peace where time is art.     According to PAN, the meaning of human life is now redefined     according to how artful it is and how much it contributes to the     greater harmony of the biosphere. Any and all human activity is     now considered art.<p>     The sacred order of the Planet Art Network has no central     coordinating authority, but is entirely constituted of autonomous     bioregional cooperatives who locally organize humans for their new     roles, while maintaining communication with other PAN bioregional     operations. Much of the initial PAN activity will be developed     through cultural exchanges which disseminate methods of conversion     as well as inspired renderings of the new living epic of human     life on Earth. In its overall planetary bioregional organization     the PAN will also be responsible for coordinating unifying planet     art events synchronized world-wide for the increase in collective     telepathic awareness of humanity as a single creative organism     realizing its destiny within the biospheric arena of     self-regulating evolution.<p>     Henceforth, as the biospherically ordained order of human society     organized according to the law and moving principles of time, PAN     is the new form of the human social order. Every human being born     into and/or operating in the new time of thirteen moons has innate     membership in PAN. As the emergency comprehensive social reform to     cure for the ills of the old 12:60 time, PAN replaces     'civilization.'<p>     In reconstituting what was known as civilization, and following     the organizational order of the 13:20 timing frequency, PAN is a     sub-order of galactic civilization. All of intelligent life in     this and all galaxies organizes itself by and maintains     communication according to the unifying law of time, which is the     13:20 frequency. By command of the Dominion of Time, PAN is the     biospheric social form of humans bioregionally dispersed,     cooperatively networked for maximum cultural biodiversity in     preparation for the evolutionary synchronization known as the     advent of the noosphere.<p>     PAN is evolution at work. In the order of time, learning is     life-long. The form of education and the moving order of society     are one and the same in the PAN model. The social form of time     creates inherent, moving social orders based on biological stages     of life which are thence incorporated into educational, artistic,     and economic structures, and exemplified in the Council of Five.     Each PAN Council of Five consists of delegates from the five     social Orders of Time.<p>     <b>The Five Orders of Time with their five castles of time     designations:</b><p><ul>     <li>Ages 0-13 Children, League of Learners, Red Eastern Castle    <li> Ages 13-26, Apprentices, League of Seekers, White Northern Castle     <li>Ages 26-39, Journey people, League of Sharers, Blue Western Castle     <li>Ages 39-52, Masters, League of Teachers, Yellow Southern Castle     <li>Ages 52 +, Elders, League of Wizards, Green Central Castle</ul><p>     For any bioregional local group, a PAN Council of Five will always     have delegates from each of the five Orders of Time; input of any     and all of the five Orders of Time is equally valid. Regardless of     craft skill or occupation, it is age and experience that determine     the groupings of the Council of Five. Each Order of Time has equal     experience value to every other order. The Elders or League of     Wizards have the final authority to break deadlocks and are the     ultimate arbiters of conflict.<p>     <b>The Elders or League of Wizards are further organized as follows:</b><p><ul>     <li>Ages 52-65 Wizard Learners, Red League    <li> Ages 65-78 Wizard Seekers, White League     <li>Ages 78-91 Wizard Teachers, Blue League    <li> Ages 91-104 Wizard Masters, Yellow League     <li>Ages 104+ Ancient Wizards, Green League</ul><p>     Henceforth, education is the responsibility of each local     bioregional community. Each Order of Time is responsible for its     own organization and communication with the other Orders of Time.     No community decision can be made without input from all five     Orders at a commonly called Council meeting. Transition from one     Order of Time to another, inclusive of the transitions of birth     and death, will be ceremonially acknowledged according to the     customs and needs of the local bioregional unit.<p>     Activation of PAN is voluntary and autonomous. Any group of     artists and creative humans so inspired may call themselves     together for the formation of a local PAN spore--living art cell.     Working with members of local Calendar Councils, the PAN spores     will have the responsibility of translating into new forms of     artistic action the directives of the new time. Ultimately, PAN     will model all the new social forms based on the interlocking     cycles of the Dominion of Time.<p>     PAN will be identifiable in any community by the Banner of Peace,     Rainbow Flag, Earth Flag, and Galactic Shield of the Fifth force     flying over its headquarters. In the event of any conflict,     members experiencing the conflict will be remanded to the local     PAN where the Council of Five will assign a suitable artistic     project to the members experiencing conflict. Members of a local     PAN may call for bioregional PAN gatherings whenever it is deemed     suitable or necessary. Gradually at first, but sooner than later,     PAN will absorb into itself all functions of governance,     transmuting them into rites, ceremonies and art forms that allow     the people to channel their energy into creative and fulfilling     patterns of human transcendence.<p>     In order to assure swift communication of the presence of PAN, its     goals and working methods, we, the people of planet Earth do     hereby empower the immediate initial task of the PAN to organize     as a total artistic event the "52 Days of Victory," in order to     demonstrate the power of art as an act of peace, synchronizing and     unifying the people into cooperative artistic forces of good will.     During this sacred 52-day cycle, the Boundary Dissolving Ceremony,     the Olympics of Cooperation, the arousing of Children's Brigades,     new time education, prisoner release, and beginning military     conversion will be among the assignments initiated by the order of     PAN, on behalf of the Dominion of Time.<p><hr>Return to:  |   <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <a href="pacal.html#contents">Planetary Congress Table of Contents</a>  |  <a href="arguelles.html">Jose Arguelles</a>  |  <a href="messenger.html">The Portal Messenger</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index2.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>   |<p><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995-1996 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

Be it further resolved, that in order to coordinate     information world-wide concerning the victory of universal peace     and the coming "52 Days of Victory," that the Planetary Calendar     Councils be empowered as the PAN Emergency Information Command     Bases to begin unified command victory operations as of the     completion of the First Planetary Biospheric Rights Congress,     Solar Moon 15 (Gregorian March 21, 1996). As of this date all     Bases are empowered to establish an emergency infrastructure for     the coordination of information and the movement and organization     of people for the initial events commencing Thirteen Moon Victory     Day, Crystal Moon 28.<p>     As of the completion of the "52 Days of Victory," Magnetic Moon     22, Fourth Year of Prophecy, let it be resolved that the Planetary     Calendar Council Emergency Command Bases continue to function as     the infrastructure of the new unified biospheric Thirteen Moon     Calendar planetary information system, coordinating information     from different biospheric locals with information from other     biospheric regions constituting the Planet Art Network. In this     way the Planetary Calendar Councils will lead in modeling the     method of operations for converting from old to new time.<p>     <IMG align="left" SRC="smpacal.gif"><a name=victory><b>People's Resolution Empowering the Planet Art Network              for the Organization of the "52 Days of Victory"</b></a><p>We, the people of planet Earth, in order to assure the complete     success of the victory of universal peace, beginning Thirteen Moon     Victory Day, Crystal Moon 28, do hereby empower the Planet Art     Network to assume its responsibility, immediately effective, Solar     Moon 15 (Gregorian March 21, 1996), in order to commence     preparations for the "52 Days of Victory," whose theater of events     is, henceforth, the responsibility of the Planet Art Network.<p>     In coordination with the Planetary Calendar Councils, autonomous     emergency PAN Cooperative Councils are hereby authorized to begin     formation according to the Orders of Time of the Council of Five.     Once an emergency PAN Cooperative Council has formed it can begin     immediately to plan with other bioregional emergency PAN     Cooperative Councils for the organization of the victory of     universal peace.<p>     Foremost among the responsibilities of the emergency PAN     Cooperative Councils will be the organization of: the flying of     Banners of Peace on Thirteen Moon Victory Day at locally     designated sites in proclamation of the victory of universal peace     and the re-entry of humanity into biospheric membership according     to the Thirteen Moon Calendar; the creation of cooperative local     boundary dissolving ceremonies coordinated with the Four Corners     Boundary Dissolving Ceremony; the calling forth from the Learner's     and the Seeker's Orders a Children's Brigade to join with other     PAN-organized Children's Brigades for the purpose of the release     of prisoners and beginning military disarmament and conversion;     the immediate establishment of new public information programs in     artistic format to proclaim and demonstrate the new time     education; and to prepare for participation in the Olympics of     Cooperation, 'swords into plowshares' public art events in     conjunction with the Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia, for the     conversion of industrial waste into monuments of beauty.<p>     Through all of its endeavors, PAN is exhorted to exemplify and     excel in the human evolutionary aspiration toward spirit, vision,     and beauty. Following the "52 Days of Victory," PAN Cooperatives     will be organized autonomously through coalitions of artists,     crafts people, traders, performers, and gardeners socially     functioning as the Five Orders of Time, modeling the life-long     learning process as the social form itself. The PAN Cooperatives,     in concert with the Planetary Calendar Councils, will embody the     redirection of the human species according to the all-unifying law     of time, evolving thereby, into the organic order of the     biospheric Dominion of Time encoded in the Thirteen Moon Calendar.<p><IMG align="left" SRC="smpacal.gif"><a name=prisoners><b>People's Resolution for the Release of Prisoners                     and the Conversion of the Military</b></a><p> In order that every human being has equal opportunity to enter the     new time on an equal basis with every other human being, as of     July 25, 1996, Day out of Time, end of Third Year of Prophecy, by     the order of the Dominion of Time which commands universal     forgiveness as the foundation of universal peace, the PAN     Children's Brigades supported by members of the other Orders of     Time of the Councils of Five, are hereby empowered to go to the     prisons of the planet to release all of the prisoners, and to see     to it that following their release the prisoners are taken either     to their families or to camps established by PAN for education in     the forms of the new time. Wherever possible, the prisons     themselves will be transformed into dormitories and New Time     Training Camps.<p>     Bearing Banners of Peace, the Children's Brigades will follow a     ceremonial procedure in which they will first engage the guards in     disarmament rites, releasing the guards from their     responsibilities and relieving them of their weapons. It will be     the duty of the Elders of the Council of Five to gather the guns     and weapons caches to be taken and kept at predesignated sites     where they will be stored until their dismantling and/or     destruction has been completed. Bioregional local PAN     Cooperatives, along with Human Rights groups, should research in     advance regarding their local prisons and seek the cooperation of     prison officials to locate families of the prisoners.<p>     The release of prisoners is enacted as a planetary ceremony of     forgiveness on behalf of all humanity as the first step in     eliminating, once and for all, the servitude to false 12:60 time.     Carried out by the Children's Brigades, this planetary ceremony of     forgiveness and release will demonstrate the power of art in the     new time of thirteen moons to provide a new genesis for all of     humanity who have labored and lived according to laws and     regulations bound to a false time. Hence, the prisoners' release     and forgiveness is the release and forgiveness for all of humanity     from all of the crimes, errors, and prejudices of their past,     which were due simply to being in servitude to false time.<p>     Following the successful release of the prisoners, thus     establishing the grounds for universal forgiveness, the Children's     Brigades may next turn their attention to the disarmament and     conversion of the military forces of the planet for the beginning     of the conversion of industrial waste to biospheric art. Former     prisoners and prison guards are invited to join the ranks of the     Children's Brigades to commence the military disarmament     exercises. A universal cease fire will already have been called as     of Crystal Moon 28, and members of PAN shall already have taken     Banners of Peace to all conflict zones, enlisting the support of     the military in throwing down their arms. However, the edict of     Universal Forgiveness and Prisoner Release, Day Out of Time,     (Gregorian July 25, 1996), will signal the commencement of the     universal planetary disarmament process, as of the new year,     Magnetic Moon 1, Fourth Year of Prophecy, (Gregorian, July 26,     1996).<p>     Following lines of selective research and communication by PAN     locals, beginning Magnetic Moon 1, Fourth Year of Prophecy,     bearing Banners of Peace, in order to end the servitude of false     time, Children's Brigades are hereby empowered to enter any     military base, and, in full ceremonial manner, request the laying     down of arms. As with the prison weapons, all military weapons and     armaments caches will be remanded to the Orders of Elders to be     stockpiled in a suitable site for their dismantling and/or     destruction. As with the prisoner release, all military barracks     will be transformed into New Time Education and Training Centers,     and the personnel will begin immediate reassignment of tasks     according to schedules of bioregionally PAN-coordinated conversion     priorities.<p>     The first major planetary coordination of military conversion     procedures will be the preparation of a major contingent of former     United States military personnel to join with an equal contingent     of former Russian military personnel for the assignment of     repairing and restoring the damage done to the Russian environment     due to 50 years of Cold War-induced nuclear waste and     mismanagement. The Russian-American model biospheric clean-up     project will thence be the model for all military conversion     cooperative programs elsewhere on the planet. Henceforth, all     current military budgets are frozen and turned into a trust for     the financing of specific biospheric restoration projects,     inclusive of the Russian American nuclear clean-up and the     Children's Brigades.<p>     Applying the same methods, and organized according to the needs of     the bioregional locals, the Children's Brigades will begin the     liberation of the schools and education systems, commencing     Magnetic Moon 1, (Gregorian, July 26, 1996) to be completed by     Resonant Moon 14, (Gregorian, January 24, 1997), Fourth Year of     Prophecy, the completion of the first half-year cycle of     biospheric conversion. Hence the children of the planet will be     enrolled as functioning members in the Orders of the Learners and     Seekers, assisting in all PAN conversion programs of the     bioregional locals. All existing educational facilities will be     henceforth converted into PAN "new time is art" training and     educational facilities and dormitories.<p>     Henceforth, let it be proclaimed that as there is no war in the     Dominion of Time, there are no longer armies of war, prisons,     prisoners, or compulsory education of any kind. In the Dominion of     Time discipline and training are natural auto regulatory functions     of the Orders of Time. All deviations from the norm of the     Covenant of Biospheric Rights will henceforth be dealt with in the     PAN Cooperative Councils of Five, and all deviant conduct be     awarded with appropriate artistic discipline and endeavor.<p><hr>Return to:  |   <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <a href="pacal.html#contents">Planetary Congress Table of Contents</a>  |  <a href="arguelles.html">Jose Arguelles</a>  |  <a href="messenger.html">The Portal Messenger</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index2.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>   |<p><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995-1996 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

Whereas money is desanctioned of any value except as an     agreed upon quantification of the 12:60 standard of wealth, and     whereas money has no legitimacy whatsoever in the time of the new     Calendar, we the people of planet Earth, do hereby delegitimize     any and all use of money as a commodity or a speculative means for     extracting interest or usury of any kind.<p>     This means that, henceforth, all abstract monetary systems     operating with terms of interest of any kind, stock markets, and     the entire banking system of the G-7 are divested of their power.     The current liquidity of all banking institutions is hereby frozen     and reconstituted as the Earth Conversion Trust of the Planetary     Store for the financing of the two-year (1996-98) PAN Victory     Conversion Program, and the establishment of the subsequent     two-year (1998-2000) new PAN model preparation for the     Biosphere-Noosphere Transition.<p>     Beginning Magnetic Moon 1, Fourth Year of Prophecy (Gregorian,     July 26,1996), PAN economic conversion arbiters will immediately     begin cooperation exercises with major bank management beginning     with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the     Federal Reserve, as well as the bank executives of the consortium     of the G-7 and all of their attendant operations, GATT, NAFTA,     etc., for the purpose of assessing the quantity of the liquidity     and, thence, by means of the reconstituted United Nations, the     United People's PAN Conversion Network, allocating the liquidity     proportionately over time in a program where recipients are     equalized according to a common planetary standard of living.<p>     Because the accumulated wealth of the World Bank, International     Monetary Fund, Federal Reserve Bank, as well as the banking system     of the G-7, represent profits made in exchange for the despoiling     of vital biospheric resources, inclusive of the salaried slave     labor involved, the frozen assets of the world banking system     henceforth, constitute the Earth Conversion Trust of the Planetary     Store. As the Earth Conversion Trust, the frozen liquidity will be     converted into a common pool for the financing of the restoration     of human culture and the regeneration of the Biosphere over the     two-year conversion period.<p>     Bioregional banks and banking systems will be utilized to receive     all bioregional corporate profits, inclusive of payroll. All     accounts will be used as repository of corporate profits and     payroll to be disbursed regularly each 28-day Moon, in equal sums     to individuals and/or local PAN Cooperative Councils. PAN     Cooperative Councils can use their collective discretion to     allocate funds for group projects in accord with the new Covenant.<p>     Commodities constitute the Planetary Store of the Earth Conversion     Trust. Beginning Magnetic Moon 1, Blue Self-Existing Storm,     (Gregorian, July 26, 1996), all stocks of commodities are frozen     and, henceforth, reconstituted as the Planetary Store. This means     that in cooperation with PAN economic arbiters, the distribution     and production of all goods and commodities, as well as services,     are to be paced to accommodate the Earth Conversion Trust program     for the equal distribution to all of economic means, services, and     commodities during the two-year conversion period.<p>     In order to facilitate all accounting for banks, corporations and     all other organizations doing cooperative business ventures with     PAN during the conversion period, we, the people of planet Earth     do hereby mandate zero budget as the most efficient way of     maintaining a clear record of accounting. This means that every     28-day, four-week cycle will begin with zero budget, allocations     being made for what is required, and income accounted for and     deposited with a local Earth Conversion Trust Bank. Effective as     of Magnetic Moon 1, Blue Self-existing Storm, (Gregorian July 26,     1996), the people's mandate of universal zero budget, also means     that the slate is wiped clean, all debts are forgiven, and there     are no deficits. This is done in fulfillment of the command of the     Dominion of Time for universal forgiveness.<p>     <IMG align="left" SRC="smpacal.gif"><a name=un><b>People's Resolution for the Reconstitution of the United Nations                as the United People's PAN Conversion Network</b></a><p>Whereas, in the time of the new calendar the 'nation state' is no     longer a functional operating concept, we , the people of planet     Earth, in order to assure a successful conversion to the     bioregional autonomies of the Dominion of Time, do hereby command     the dissolution of the United Nations as it is now constituted,     and its immediate reconstitution as the United People's PAN     Conversion Network for the restoration of human culture and the     regeneration of the biosphere, effective Magnetic Moon 1, Blue     Self-Existing Storm, Fourth Year of Prophecy (Gregorian July 26,     1996.<p>     In recognition of the fact that virtually every 'nation state' now     constituted has representation in the General Assembly of the     United Nations, and in recognition that UNESCO already exists as     an educational and cultural outreach of the United Nations with     representation in virtually every now constituted 'nation state,'     the people of planet Earth do hereby call upon the cooperation of     these representatives, and especially of UNESCO, to participate     with the PAN Cooperative Councils and the Planetary Calendar     Councils in coordinating information, disseminating calendars and     all related educational material to all of their constituencies,     to see to it that PAN Cooperatives and PCCs are established in     their local states for the express purpose of assisting in the     conversion from 'state' to voluntarily self-designated bioregion.<p>     The people's mandate to the reconstituted United Nations, the     United People's PAN Conversion Network, is to cooperate in the two     year phasing out of all government and corporate structures and     functions. In its reconstituted two-year conversion form the     United People's PAN Conversion Network will work closely with PAN     economic arbiters and the World Bank, International Monetary Fund,     Federal Reserve Bank, and G-7 banking system to see to it that the     allocation of Earth Conversion Trust funds are distributed     equitably according to a planetary standard of living, in     cooperation with military-biospheric conversion operations, and in     accord with local PAN Cooperative Councils.<p>     In the reconstitution of the United Nations, the currently     constituted Security Council is hereby permanently dissolved, and     in recognition that the Security Council is actually the 'nuclear     weapons' private club, all of its classified information regarding     nuclear weapons, nuclear production, and nuclear energy plants     will be remanded to PAN Cooperative Councils for the permanent     disarmament of planet Earth. Henceforth, locally originated teams     will begin the task of dismantling and/or converting all nuclear     weapons arsenals and research facilities and nuclear energy     plants, not only in the five 'security council' nations, but in     all nations where such facilities now exist. In conjunction with     the Nuclear Disarmament Program, advanced new time education and     research teams are exhorted in the development of non-material,     telepathic technologies for the elimination of atomic and all     toxic waste now endangering the biosphere.<p>     By means of the reconstituted United People's PAN Conversion     Network, let the mandate go forth that all elections are     henceforth null and void; that PAN Councils of Five are the new     generic form of direct self-governance; that whoever is now     holding an elected political office be allowed to remain in that     office until its final term of dissolution two years hence, if not     sooner; and that the condition for incumbents remaining in office     is their cooperation in coordinating all national affairs through     the United People's PAN Conversion Network. Finally, in order to     enforce the delegitimization of the nation state, let it be known     that the United People's PAN Conversion Network is hereby     empowered, to disestablish and dismantle all systems of customs     and border guards which exist solely for the superfluous     maintenance of now-constituted nation states.<p>     Let it be clearly known that the term of the United People's PAN     Conversion Network, the reconstituted United Nations, be consonant     with the two-year conversion program, July 26, 1996, Blue     Self-Existing Storm, through July 25, Day Out of Time, 1998,     Yellow Overtone Star, and that following this date, all governance     is in the hands of the people's bioregional autonomies of the     biospheric Dominion of Time.<p><IMG align="left" SRC="smpacal.gif"><a name=first><b>Thirteen Moon Victory Plan: the First World Peace</b></a><p>In order to assure that the new Thirteen Moon Calendar, new     Covenant of Biospheric Rights be implemented and dispersed to all     people of planet Earth swiftly and equitably, and that the     conversion of all of the institutions now engrained in the old     calendar be accomplished with the greatest cooperative effort     possible, we, the people of planet Earth do hereby declare and     proclaim the Thirteen Moon Victory Plan, also known as the First     World Peace, to be the designated mobilization of human energy     needed to fulfill the needs of a celebratory and rapid     transformation of human values from a culture of war to a culture     of peace.<p>     Let it be further known that this Thirteen Moon Victory Plan, the     First World Peace, consist of two clearly marked phases: a     two-year conversion program, Magnetic Moon 1, Blue Self-Existing     Storm (Gregorian, July 26, 1996), to Day Out of Time, Yellow     Overtone Star (Gregorian, July 25, 1998), and a two-year program     for modeling the new social form according to the PAN Councils of     the Five in preparation for the Biosphere-Noosphere Transition,     Magnetic Moon 1, Red Rhythmic Moon, (Gregorian, July 26, 1998),     through the Day Out of Time, White Resonant Mirror, Seventh Year     of Prophecy (Gregorian, July 25, 2000).<p>     Conducted as a galactic cultural aid campaign, the First World     Peace will consist of a clearly demarcated set of nine half-year     cycles, each of which is programmed with clearly attainable goals,     for the purpose of increasing the synchronization of humanity     world-wide in the orders and principles of the new time. The     timetable of the nine cycles of the First World Peace of the     Planetary Congress of Biospheric Rights is for the purpose of     pacing the joint government-corporate two-year conversion count     down to biospheric restoration; and to establish the two-year PAN     culture of peace planetary model, leading to the     Biosphere-Noosphere Transition within the Dominion of Time. All     Resolutions of the Covenant of Biospheric Rights, in accord with     the PAN Cooperative Councils and PCCs, are authorization for     establishing long and short-term goals within the span of the     First World Peace, for the swift and comprehensive conversion of     the entire human social order into its natural timing codes.<p><hr>Return to:  |   <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <a href="pacal.html#contents">Planetary Congress Table of Contents</a>  |  <a href="arguelles.html">Jose Arguelles</a>  |  <a href="messenger.html">The Portal Messenger</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index2.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>   |<p><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995-1996 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

The matrix of the human community established in the     forms of 13:20 time fulfills the sacred command of unification in     time, experienced as an unprecedented collective mental, spiritual     and physical unification, "the glory." Humanity liberated into     paths of the fourth-dimensional order of the Dominion of Time to     practice a thirteen-year trial of operating solely by the new     Covenant and the new Calendar without further recourse to any     prior historical convention, inclusive of the Biospheric Congress     itself.<p>     As of the Day Out of Time, White Resonant Mirror, (Gregorian, July     25, 2000) the First World Peace is concluded, the terms of the     Biospheric Congress are complete, and the human species is on its     own not only to maintain, but to embellish and improve upon the     biosphere, until the agreed upon conclusion of the trial period of     the new Covenant of Biospheric Rights and the Thirteen Moon     Calendar, Yellow Galactic Seed, (Gregorian, July 26, 2013).<p>     <IMG align="left" SRC="smpacal.gif"><a name=terms><b>Fundamental Biospheric Rights, Principles and Terms of Congress     and Resolutions</b></a><p>Whereas the Thirteen Moon Calendar Change and new Covenant of     Biospheric Rights with its attendant Resolutions represent a     fundamental and unprecedented change in the course of human     affairs, and, whereas this fundamental change is also in the     nature of an emergency measure, the First World Peace, let it     hereby be proclaimed and made universally known that the sacred     change embodied by the Thirteen Moon Calendar and the new Covenant     of Biospheric Rights and its attendant Resolutions is totally     spiritual in nature.<p>     When it is asked, "With what will you replace technology and war?"     answer, "We shall replace the civilization of technology and war     with spirit, vision, and beauty. The land of the future is a land     free for all in accord with the biospheric Dominion of Time."<p>     Let it henceforth be proclaimed that as of Red Cosmic Moon,     Thirteen Moon Victory Day, Crystal Moon 28, Third Year of     Prophecy, (Gregorian, June 26 1996), that peace is universally     ordained on planet Earth; that the biosphere has been reclaimed on     behalf of the Dominion of Time; that the human species is now     re-enrolled in the evolutionary program of the biospheric Dominion     of Time; and that as of the end of the two-year conversion     program, that the rights of free land, free, air, free water, free     will, free worship, free life, and free time be restored to every     member of the human species, and that following the two-year     coordination of the PAN Culture of Peace Planetary Model Program,     that clean air, clean land, and clean water be restored to the     biosphere.<p>     Further, let it be resolved that the galactic lottery for the     reassignment of roles be established according to the Book of Kin,     the Galactic Epic of Free Will; that the Banner of Peace be     universally used in commerce, products of commerce, and all manner     of exchange and artistic intercourse as an emblem signifying     accord with the biospheric Dominion of Time; that universal     telepathy, common tenure, and fair exchange be established as the     system of unifying intelligence and trust for all humans; that a     planetary order of bioregional autonomies be established for the     harmonization of the human species within the biosphere; and that     within the bioregional autonomies, that all governance be     universally established through the Planet Art Network Cooperative     Councils of the Five Orders of Time, and that, henceforth all     questions of health, crime or other social disturbances be     remanded to any local PAN Council of Five for artistic resolution.<p>     Let it be known that by the terms of the First Planetary Congress     of Biospheric Rights, that this Congress maintain its role as a     provisional body monitoring the Biosphere-Noosphere transition,     inclusive of the emergency PAN, PCC, and all matters pertaining to     the two-year conversion, and the two-year establishment of the new     order of PAN, effective, Thirteen Moon Victory Day, to be     terminated Day Out of Time, White Resonant Mirror, (Gregorian,     July 25, 2000).<p>     Finally, to affirm the spiritual nature of the Thirteen Moon     Calendar and new Covenant of Biospheric Rights, let it be resolved     that tolerance and respect of differences of belief and worship be     universally adopted in all human communication, so that with the     advent of life fully lived in the New Order of Time, we, the     people of the Earth, may witness among ourselves, in mutual love     and respect of our sacred duty and mission on behalf of the     biospheric Dominion of Time, the flowering of the religion of     truth, the spiritually unifying force by which all falsehood shall     finally be gone, and our destiny as a species within the biosphere     be finally realized.<p>     To this end may the four services for walking the Planetary     Service Thirteen Moon Wavespell be promulgated universally for the     liberation and unification of all of humanity into the biospheric     Dominion of Time.<p><IMG align="left" SRC="smpacal.gif"><a name=service><b>The four services prescribed for each human being for unifying     life in the Planetary Service Wavespell:</b></a><p><ol>    <li>Domestic service for the restoration of domestic harmony    <li>Artistic service for self-improvement and universal harmony     <li> Social service for restoration of social harmony     <li>Biospheric service for environmental regeneration</ol><p>     <b>Concerning the Biosphere-Noosphere Transition</b><p>     The emergency nature of the Thirteen Moon Calendar Change and new     Covenant of Biospheric Rights are occasioned by the evolutionary     condition of the biosphere itself. This evolutionary condition is     referred to as the Biosphere-Noosphere transition and is directly     the result of the impact of human thought and technology upon the     biosphere. This impact is referred to as a biogeochemical     transformation.<p>     At the present moment this biogeochemical transformation, the sum     of the exponential growth and propagation of human population and     machine, inclusive of all chemical effects, is at a crisis level.     This biogeochemical crisis is the emergency attended to by the     Thirteen Moon Calendar and Covenant of Biospheric Rights. By     shifting direction in its course of affairs, humanity will have     responded intelligently to the unprecedented crisis of the     out-of-control biogeochemical transformation of the biosphere. In     so doing, humanity will have engendered the inevitable conclusion     of the impact of self-reflective thought upon the biosphere: the     transformation of the biosphere into the noosphere, the planetary     mental envelope of the telepathically unified field of humanity in     harmony with the biospheric Dominion of Time.<p><IMG align="left" SRC="smpacal.gif"><a name=congress><b>The Congress</b></a><p>     The World Parliament of Ecumenical Fraternity, Temple of Good     Will, Brazilia, Brazil has an auditorium fully equipped with     simultaneous translation facilities and a seating capacity of 500.     Therefore, invitations are being prepared for 500 delegates to     attend on behalf of the people's bioregional autonomies of planet     Earth. A small number of delegates will be invited because of the     critical leadership roles they play.<p>     The Congress will be practical in nature. It is assumed that     everyone present affirms and assents, in principle, to the     Thirteen Moon Calendar Change, the new Covenant of Biospheric     Rights and its attendant Resolutions. The pragmatic outcome of the     Congress will be the empowerment and formation of the Emergency     Planet Art Network and Planetary Calendar Council Command Bases     for the establishment of a planetary field of action ready to     begin the heroic and arduous task of creating a culture of peace,     Thirteen Moon Victory Day, Crystal Moon 28, Third Year of     Prophecy, (Gregorian, June 26, 1996).<p>     The Congress will occur in an atmosphere of living art, of which     the Temple of Good Will, the local of the Congress, is a vivid     example. Global arts and music will be a central feature of the     Congress, weaving together the day by day events into a living     testimony of time is art.<p><IMG align="left" SRC="smpacal.gif"><a name=internet><b>INTERNET</b></a><p>While the First Planetary Congress of Biospheric Rights will be     meeting in Brasilia to affirm the Resolutions in support of the     new Covenant, the Internet will also provide an interactive     planetary extension of the Congress to all regions of the planet.<p>     It is expected that the new Covenant and Resolutions, as well as     information regarding the First Planetary Congress in Brazilia,     will be carried on the Internet prior to the event and in     conjunction with the public announcement Resonant Moon 15, Third     Year of Prophecy, (Gregorian, January 24, 1996).<p>     <hr>Return to:  |   <a href="#top">Top</a>  |  <a href="pacal.html#contents">Planetary Congress Table of Contents</a>  |  <a href="arguelles.html">Jose Arguelles</a>  |  <a href="messenger.html">The Portal Messenger</a>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/index2.html">Home</A>  |  <A HREF="/earthportals/control.html">Earth Portal Controls</A>   |<p><center><a href="mailto:portal@netcom.com"><center>portal@netcom.com</center></a></center><center>&copy;1995-1996 Earth Portals</center><p></body></html>

The data were immediatelytransferred by satellite link to the ESO Headquarters in Garching where thesubsequent image processing was done by Hans Ulrich Kaeufl.<p>Since the comet was so close to the Sun, it had to be observed in thecomparatively bright morning sky. It was acquired only 10 degrees above theeastern horizon, at an airmass of no less than 5.1. Three exposures of 5minutes each were made through a red filtre and with a 2000 x 2000 CCD inthe EMMI multi-mode instrument. The image shown here is based on oneflat-fielded 5-min exposure. The frame covers 9 x 9 arcmin; 1 pixel = 0.27arcsecond; North is up and East to the left.<p>The present image was obtained when the comet was approximately 924 millionkilometres from the Earth and 802 million kilometres from the Sun. Itcontinues to move inwards through the solar system and will cross the orbitof Jupiter in about two weeks time, on 25 February.<p>A provisional evaluation of the new images indicates that Comet Hale-Bopp isapparently still developing nominally. The coma measures at least 6 arcminacross. A certain rotation of the coma isophotes is noted, clockwise fromabout NNE (innermost) to about NW (outermost). No other obvious asymmetriesare present. The nucleus appears single of these exposures.<p>Some of the brighter stars show spikes in the N-S direction; this is atypical effect on the very sensitive CCD detectors. The trail of anartificial satellite crosses the photo in the upper left quadrant.<p>This photo signifies the beginning of a substantial Hale-Bopp observationalcampaign at ESO. Co-ordinated observations will be carried out duringapprox. 30 nights before the end of September 1996. Many differenttelescopes and instruments will be used.<p><hr>Return to:|   <a href="flight7.html">Comet</a>    |</body></html>

<h1>ANCESTORS
</h1>
<strong><p>Saturdays at 8 AM on Channel 2 beginning January 11</p>
</strong>
<IMG SRC="Ancestors.gif" HSPACE=6 BORDER=1 ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=263 HEIGHT=209>
<p>ANCESTORS is the first national television series to capture the energy of the family history explosion. The ten-part series focuses on the impact that connecting with ancestors has on individuals and families. Powerful stories of people whose lives have been changed through family history research are followed by conversations with experts who give practical instruction on how viewers can begin searching for their own roots.</p>
<p>Hosts Jim and Terry Willard, amateur genealogists, introduce the topic of each 30-minute episode -- which consist of two components, a "mini-documentary" and a "how-to" segment. ANCESTORS goes on location to visit with family historians of various social, economic and ethnic backgrounds to find out why they began a search for family history and how that search has changed their lives. </p>
<p>Each mini-documentary is followed by an instructional conversation between the hosts and various genealogical experts. These friendly, informative discussions are designed to help beginning genealogists get started. The programs end with Jim and Terry reminding viewers of research tips and referring them to local resources for further assistance.</p>

<h1>DONNA'S DAY <BR>
WITH DONNA ERICKSON
</h1>
<strong><p>Sundays at 6 PM on Channel 2 beginning January 5<BR>
Repeated Fridays at 1:30 PM and Saturdays at 8:30 AM.</p>
</strong>
<IMG SRC="Donna.gif" HSPACE=6 BORDER=1 ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=298>
<p>Creative parenting specialist Donna Erickson is nationally renowned for her ideas for fun-filled activities that parents and kids can share together. As a syndicated newspaper columnist, contributing editor of Parents Magazine, award-winning author with 500,000 activity books sold, and guest on television talk programs from The Today Show to Oprah Winfrey, Donna is dedicated to helping parents feel more capable and confident in creating good times with their kids.</p>
<p>Now, Donna brings her joy, enthusiasm and savvy to public television in Donna's Day with Donna Erickson, a weekly series brimming with ideas for stimulating and educating kids of all ages.</p>
<p>"Little things yield big results" is Erickson's credo and rallying cry. "Sure," she points out, "kids remember the big trips to Disneyland, but it's actually the small day-to-day moments of family life that will be remembered in the end. It's the little things that build and strengthen the family bond."</p>
<p>Donna brings this philosophy to life by demonstrating, in each show of her new series, at least a half dozen activities that turn everyday, inexpensive objects around the home into good times and family builders. In Donna's Day, vegetables are used to create gorgeous, economical gift wrap, objects from the family "junk drawer" yield fanciful picture frames, and kitchen utensils are transformed into magical bubble-makers that would make even Lawrence Welk envious.</p>

<p>One of the greatest novels of our time comes to public television in a lavish international production capturing the love, honor, obsession and greed of a mythical South American country in the 1890s. Shot entirely on location in Cartegena de Indias, Colombia, Joseph Conrad's Nostromo stars Colin Firth, Albert Finney and Claudia Cardinala, along with an international cast featuring Italian film star Claudio Amendoh in the title role. </p>
<p>In the imaginary republic of Costaguana, where the Andes plunge down to a tropical paradise, there are fortunes to be made. Englishman Charles Gould has arrived with his wife to take over the family's closed silver mine, which may yet yield great wealth. Gould's obsession to make the mine productive works on the people of Costaguana like a dangerous drug, energizing them and plunging them into a morass of corruption, betrayal and revolution as the shining bullion mounts up.</p>
<p>Throughout it all, there is only one man who is reliable beyond question: Nostromo, the proud leader of the local dockworkers, whose name means "our man." To him falls the duty of saving the mine and its treasure when civil war engulfs the country.</p>
<p>Critics have hailed the original novel, published in 1904, as indisputably one of the greatest of the 20th century -- a South American War and Peace that probes the actions, emotions and destinies of people who are caught in epic forces beyond their control.</p>

THE METROPOLITAN OPERA PRESENTS: COSI FAN TUTTE</h2>
Two gentlemen wager on the fidelity of their lady-loves and get more than they bargain for in this production taped at the Metropolitan Opera House in February 1996. Set in Naples in the late 1700s, Cosi fan tutte follows the exploits of Don Alfonso as he tries to win a bet that he can convince his friends' sweethearts -- sisters Fiordiligi and Dorabella -- to be unfaithful. Alfonso's schemes involve deception, disguises, and general skullduggery, all set to the brilliant music of Mozart. The opera, conducted by James Levine, with a libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte, is sung in Italian with English subtitles. Garrick Utley hosts.

<H2>DONNA'S DAY WITH DONNA ERICKSON</H2>
Parents understand the importance of spending time with their kids. They know that family activities and bonding are critical for healthy child development. Yet busy parents are often unsure of how to make the time spent together really count. That's where Donna Erickson comes in. As host of this new KTCA-produced national series, Erickson offers simple-to-follow directions for fun-filled games, activities, and projects designed to enhance a child's self-confidence and strengthen the family as a whole. Erickson comes to television with impressive credentials. She writes a weekly syndicated newspaper column on parenting, she's written a best-selling book on the subject (Prime Time Together... with Kids), and she is a contributing editor to Parent's Magazine. In Donna's Day, she infuses her quick wit and personable style into demonstrations that teach parents inventive and inexpensive ideas for stimulating and educating kids of all ages. (R -- Jan. 10, 1:30 p.m., Jan. 11, 8:30 a.m.)

<H2>MOBIL MASTERPIECE THEATRE -- JOSEPH CONRAD'S NOSTROMO</H2>
In the fictional republic of Costaguana, where the Andes plunge down to a tropical paradise, there are fortunes to be made. Englishman Charles Gould (Colin Firth) arrives with his wife, Emilia (Serena Scott Thomas), to take over the family's closed silver mine. Gould's obsession to make the mine productive works on the people of Costaguana like a dangerous drug, energizing them and plunging them into a morass of corruption, betrayal and revolution as the shining bullion mounts. Throughout it all, there is only one man who is reliable beyond question: Nostromo (Claudio Amendola), the proud leader of the local dockworkers. The duty of saving the mine and its treasure falls to him when civil war engulfs the country. Critics have hailed the original 1904 novel, on which this three-part special is based, as one of the greatest of the twentieth century -- a South American War and Peace that probes the actions, emotions, and destinies of people caught in epic forces beyond their control. (Parts 2 & 3 air Jan. 6 & 7, 9 p.m.)

<H2>GOING PLACES</H2>
Why is London the most popular vacation destination in the world? Why do more travelers and conventioneers go to Las Vegas than any other place in America? What's the best recipe for a spicy time in New Orleans? This new series, narrated by Al Roker, answers those questions and more by inviting viewers to enjoy the vicarious thrill of following real people as they tour popular vacation spots. The series explores and samples virtually every aspect of a place, from culture and history, to shopping and dining, to recreation and sightseeing, to the colorful characters who populate a particular locale. For a special insider's look at some places, several episodes include cameos and interviews with resident celebrities. Viewers get a chance to meet these favorite sons and daughters in their natural habitats. The first stop on this televised round-the-world tour: London, England. (R -- Jan. 18, 3 p.m.)

<H2>THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE -- THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD: ANDREW CARNEGIE</H2>
Andrew Carnegie embodied the American dream: the immigrant who went from rags to riches; the self-made man who became a captain of industry; the king of steel. Fond of saying, "The man who dies rich, dies disgraced," Carnegie amassed a fortune, then gave it away. Millions of dollars went to support education, a pension plan for teachers, and world peace-related causes. Famous as a benefactor of libraries, he funded nearly 3,000 around the world. He preached the obligation of the wealthy to return their money to the communities in which they made it, adding, "it provides a refuge from self-questioning." This revealing documentary, which kicks off The American Experience's ninth season, follows Carnegie's life from his impoverished origins in Dunfermline, Scotland, through his business career, when he was on the cutting edge of the industrial revolution in telegraphy, railroads, and finally, steel. David Ogden Stiers narrates.

<H2>TAPE'S ROLLING!</H2>
KTCA takes its cameras back on location throughout the Twin Cities and Minnesota for the fourth round of this unique documentary series. The new season starts off this month with a bang -- or should we say body slam -- as "Grudge Match" enters the world of local professional wrestling. As usual, this program has no narrator. The natural sights and sounds of the subject tell the story. The show is filled with humor and excitement, but it also takes a look at the phenomenon of violence as entertainment. Future episodes will visit Canterbury Park, a Hmong funeral, a Billy Graham Crusade, the Miss Verndale Pageant, and, on January 30, a performance at the Gay 90s that is definitely a drag! (R -- Jan. 26, 11 p.m.)

<H2>THE LIVING EDENS -- DENALI, ALASKA'S GREAT WILDERNESS</H2>

This new series explores places on Earth so pure they are precious reminders of how the ancient world once was. From the remote mountains of Madagascar to the pristine reefs of beautiful Palau, The Living Edens opens magical vistas to viewers through the expertise of world-acclaimed natural history filmmakers. The first program, "Denali, Alaska's Great Wilderness," tracks a year in the life of Alaska's Mount McKinley. Called "Denali," or, "the high one" by Indians, it is the highest mountain in North America. Filmmaker Bruce Reitherman captures all the seasons in this preserved wilderness -- from winter darkness with temperatures of sixty degrees below zero, to the coming of spring with its burgeoning life, to summer with its twenty hours of daylight, and to autumn as the chill returns to the air in mid-September. This land of extreme contrasts is populated by prowling wolves, foraging caribou, hearty Dall sheep, incredible wood frogs, powerful grizzlies, and many other amazing creatures. (R -- Feb. 9, 7 p.m.)

MOBIL MASTERPIECE THEATRE -- PRIME SUSPECT V: ERRORS OF JUDGMENT
Helen Mirren takes a final turn as Jane Tennison in this two-part story set in the gritty Manchester underworld. Transferred to the north, Tennison feels underused until her immediate boss, Ballinger (John McArdle), puts her on what appears to be a gang-warfare, drug-related murder case. Tennison is nonplused when a twelve-year-old boy confesses to the killing. Did he really do it? How is the drug baron known as "The Street" involved? Why do the gangs have as much information as the police? And who is the prime suspect? "Errors of Judgment" concludes Feb. 16, 9 p.m. Parts 1 & 2 also air Feb. 11 & 18, respectively, both at 11 p.m.

<H2>NOVA - SECRETS OF LOST EMPIRES</H2>
This special exploration of the technology and human ingenuity of ancient civilizations uses unique, hands-on experiments to examine the wonders of Stonehenge, unravel the mysteries of Incan grass bridges and stone fortresses, solve the riddle of ancient obelisks, and investigate how the enormous canvas awning over the Roman Colosseum was held in place. In "Stonehenge/Incas" (Feb. 11, 8 p.m., R -- Feb. 16, noon), archeologist Julian Richards and others attempt to move, raise, and cap a structure similar to Stonehenge using the same simple tools available to early Britons. In "Obelisk/Colosseum" (Feb. 12, 8 p.m., R -- Feb. 16, 2 p.m.), experts attempt to recreate the vast canvas awning of the Roman Colosseum in a bullring near Barcelona, Spain.

<H2>THOMAS JEFFERSON</H2>
Detailed portraits and paintings, original architectural drawings, and excerpts from journals, letters, scientific papers, and political writings reveal the breathtaking range of Thomas Jefferson's achievements and the challenging paradoxes of his character in this new two-part documentary from acclaimed filmmaker Ken Burns (Baseball, The Civil War). Using evocative cinematography, the film outlines the history of this founding father, political figure, musician, architect, scientist, mathematician, inventor, philosopher, and family man. "Life"/"Liberty: Our Sacred Honor" (Feb. 18, 9 p.m., R -- Feb. 23, 3 p.m.) looks at Jefferson's youth, when the bookish student was transformed by the philosophic fire of the American Revolution into the country's most articulate voice for human liberty. The program also traces Jefferson's early political career as author of the Declaration of Independence, and explores his provocative views on slavery, race, and religion. "Liberty: The Age of Experiments"/"The Pursuit of Happiness" (Feb. 19, 9 p.m., R -- Feb. 23, 4:30 p.m.) follows Jefferson's bitter political battle with Alexander Hamilton and the Federalists that culminated in the "revolution of 1800" and Jefferson's dramatic election to the Presidency. Actor Sam Waterston provides the voice of Jefferson. Ossie Davis narrates.

<H2>IN THE WILD -- THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS WITH RICHARD DREYFUSS</H2>
This program follows Academy Award-winning actor Richard Dreyfuss's voyage across 600 miles of glistening ocean to the most unusual and fascinating wildlife paradise in the world -- the Galapagos Islands. At the first island -- a black volcanic wasteland -- the only living thing is a mysteriously healthy cactus. At another stop, Dreyfuss encounters a marine iguana, motionless like a gargoyle on the rocks. On the sandy island of Mosquera, Dreyfuss watches sea lions dive in and out of crystal blue waves, riding the surf like teenagers. Later, he observes two waved albatrosses in an extraordinary mating ritual that involves hoots, twisted necks, and clicking beaks. Moving on, Dreyfuss finds other strange species such as masked boobies, frigate birds, and the flightless cormorant -- once capable of flight, now evolving into a specialized deep-sea fisher. "I've heard stories about the Galapagos Islands that are full of mystery, myth, even murder," says Dreyfuss. "They are islands which inspired ideas about the origin of life itself."

<H2>CHAMPIONSHIP BALLROOM DANCING (1997)</H2>
The finest ballroom dancers are in the spotlight when the curtain rises on the sixteenth annual broadcast of this popular television event. The program showcases America's premier dancing competition, featuring performances in the International Standard and International Latin divisions, as well as the innovative choreography of the Showdance category. The growing popularity of this sport comes alive with ballroom's best moves, costumes, and creative performances. Actress Barbara Eden hosts this year's program, a tribute to the memory of acclaimed dancer Juliet Prowse, who died last September. Prowse served as host for the last thirteen seasons of Championship Ballroom Dancing.

This special reunites viewers with researcher Cynthia Moss and elephant matriarch Echo, whose extended family in Kenya's Amboseli National Park has been the subject of Moss's famous studies for nearly thirty years.

<h3>9:00 pm -- <a href=http://www.boston.com/wgbh/pages/masterpiecetheatre/masterpiecehome.html>MOBIL MASTERPIECE THEATRE</a></h3>
"Joseph Conrad's Nostromo." Part 1 of 3. This lavish adaptation captures love, honor, obsession, and greed in a mythical South American country during the 1890s. The series stars Colin Firth, Albert Finney, Claudia Cardinale, Serena Scott-Thomas, and Brian Dennehy, with Italian film actor Claudio Amendola in the title role. In this episode, Englishman Charles Gould returns to his boyhood home of Costaguana in South America to reopen the family silver mine.

<h3>11:00 pm -- ROCK & ROLL</h3>
Parts 9 & 10 of 10. "Punk" follows how the Ramones, Patti Smith, Talking Heads, and Blondie lit a fuse in America that exploded in London with the cynical inner-city punk spirit of the Sex Pistols and the Clash. Sharing a sense of alienation and rebellion, they championed the Bob Marley-led reggae movement. "The Perfect Beat" examines how, while artists from Bruce Springsteen to U2 to Metallica dominated the charts, rap artists created a new kind of music and black artists, led by Michael Jackson, finally made it onto MTV. <img src="../stills/cc.gif"  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38>

"Stalemate" looks at the era's modern weaponry, which most generals believed would make for a bloody but quick outcome on the battlefield. Instead, a deadly stalemate developed and all attempts to break it failed. (Parts 3 & 4 air Nov. 11, 8 p.m.) <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38>
<h3>10:00 pm -- LISTENING AT THE LUNCHEONETTE</h3>

Native American Mike Christiansen, owner of the Chicago 47th Street Cafe on the Rez in Lac du Flambeau, Wisconsin, speaks with his regular customers about change, spearfishing, and racial distrust in their Ojibwe community, where there is a renewed determination to reinvigorate elements of their traditional culture.

<h3>11:30 pm -- PAHA SAPA: THE STRUGGLE FOR THE BLACK HILLS</h3>
The Black Hills of South Dakota--sacred to the Lakota Souix and Cheyenne Indians--symbolize the misappropriation of Indian lands by the U. S. government. This film relates the history of "Paha Sapa" ("black hills" in Lakota language), and tells of the Lakota Indians' struggle to reclaim their sacred lands, and of their resistance to assimilation.
<h3>12:30 am -- LISTENING AT THE LUNCHEONETTE</h3>

"War Without End" looks at how the Great War became the worst disaster in history. Too many had suffered, too many had died, and there had been too little time to make a real peace. The unresolved and explosive issues of the Great War were simply rearranged and the stage was set for an even more catastrophic war a generation later.

<h3>9:00 pm -- <a href=http://www.boston.com:80/wgbh/pages/mystery/mysteryhome.html>MYSTERY!</a></h3>
"Poirot VIII: Hercule Poirot's Christmas." Part 1 of 2. Spanning continents and generations, this story opens in a South African diamond mine at the close of the nineteenth century. Simeon Lee, a British prospector, kills a colleague for a cache of diamonds, but is seriously wounded in the fight. An Afrikaaner woman nurses Simeon back to health; Simeon repays the deed by abandoning her and their infant son, presumably to return to England with his recently acquired wealth. Forty years later a wizened, crusty Simeon requests Poirot's presence at a seasonal family reunion. This is no ordinary get-together, however; soon after Simeon announces his plan to cut his grown sons' allowances, the irritable patriarch is found dead and his diamonds are missing. (Concludes Nov. 21, 9 p.m.) (R--Nov. 20, 11 p.m.) <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38> <img src="../stills/dvs.gif" align=top alt="Descriptive Visual Service" height=18 width=43>

<h3>1:00 pm -- GENESIS: A LIVING CONVERSATION WITH BILL MOYERS</h3>
"Call and Promise." Part 5 of 10. This program examines the story in which God makes his covenant with Abraham.

Storyteller: Mandy Patinkin. (Part 6 airs Nov. 24, 1 p.m.) <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38>
<h3>2:00 pm -- FILM</h3>
<b>Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo </b>(1944). In the ready room of an aircraft carrier one day out of San Francisco, a group of air force pilots are told the nature of the secret mission for which they have volunteered. Their target is Tokyo. This is the story of the beginning of the end of Wold War II, the day when American planes first flew over Tokyo to repay the treachery of Pearl Harbor. With Van Johnson, Robert Mitchum, and Spencer Tracy.
<h3>4:20 pm -- THE TOKYO RAIDERS</h3>
On April 18, 1942, just four months after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, a bold American air raid on Tokyo gave the United States a badly needed morale boost and rocked the psyche of the Japanese military. This is the story of that historic mission, led by Lt. Col. James "Jimmy" H. Doolittle, which helped change the course of World War II.
<h3>5:00 pm -- THE DEADLY FUZE: THE STORY OF WORLD WAR II'S BEST KEPT SECRET</h3>
During World War II there were three critical secrets. Two of them, the use of the atomic bomb against Japan and the D-Day Invasion, have become benchmarks of world history. The third, however--a weapon known simply as Proximity Fuze--is a story known to only a few. The Proximity Fuze--a forerunner of today's guided missiles--was a great technological innovation by a dedicated team of the country's best engineering and technical minds. Using rare historical footage and interviews with key members of the development team, this documentary details the dramatic creation and use of the weapon.

<h3>8:00 pm -- <a href=http://www.boston.com:80/wgbh/pages/nova/novahome.html>NOVA</a></h3>
"Shark Attack!" This program explores the behavior of the most feared creatures of the deep from the perspective of those who know them best: survivors of shark attacks. What accounts for the recent rise in assaults against surfers, who have become the latest catch of day? <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38>
<h3>9:00 pm -- <a href=http://www.boston.com:80/wgbh/pages/frontline/frontlinehome.html> FRONTLINE</a></h3>
"Loose Nukes." The program investigates the new nuclear nightmare of the post-Cold War era. While the fear of nuclear annihilation has faded, the security of 1,400 tons of weapons-grade plutonium and highly enriched uranium--enough nuclear material to make roughly 100,000 weapons--is vulnerable to theft in the former Soviet Union. Top American officials call its potential diversion to rogue states or terrorist groups a major threat to U. S. national security. <b>Frontline</b> examines the most serious case of nuclear smuggling in Russia to date, and explores the perilous state of nuclear security in a country already rife with chaos and corruption.

The Trans-Siberian Railroad connects the newly opened regions of Russia, China, and Mongolia, and for the first time in recent history, the new political climate allows travelers to disembark anywhere they choose to explore faraway places on their own. This special, narrated by veteran CBS journalist Bert Quint, follows the seven-day train trip from Moscow to Beijing, called "the longest train ride in the world."
<h3>11:00 pm -- <a href=http://www.boston.com:80/wgbh/pages/mystery/mysteryhome.html>MYSTERY!</a></h3>
"Poirot VIII: Hercule Poirot's Christmas." Part 1 of 2. Spanning continents and generations, this story opens in a South African diamond mine at the close of the nineteenth century. Simeon Lee, a British prospector, kills a colleague for a cache of diamonds, but is seriously wounded in the fight. An Afrikaaner woman nurses Simeon back to health; Simeon repays the deed by abandoning her and their infant son, presumably to return to England with his recently acquired wealth. Forty years later a wizened, crusty Simeon requests Poirot's presence at a seasonal family reunion. This is no ordinary get-together, however; soon after Simeon announces his plan to cut his grown sons' allowances, the irritable patriarch is found dead and his diamonds are missing. (Concludes Nov. 21, 9 p.m.)  <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38> <img src="../stills/dvs.gif" align=top alt="Descriptive Visual Service" height=18 width=43>

<h3>9:00 pm -- <a href=http://www.boston.com:80/wgbh/pages/mystery/mysteryhome.html>MYSTERY!</a></h3>
"Poirot VIII: Hercule Poirot's Christmas." Part 2 of 2.  Spanning continents and generations, this story opens in a South African diamond mine at the close of the nineteenth century. Simeon Lee, a British prospector, kills a colleague for a cache of diamonds, but is seriously wounded in the fight. An Afrikaaner woman nurses Simeon back to health; Simeon repays the deed by abandoning her and their infant son, presumably to return to England with his recently acquired wealth. Forty years later a wizened, crusty Simeon requests Poirot's presence at a seasonal family reunion. This is no ordinary get-together, however; soon after Simeon announces his plan to cut his grown sons' allowances, the irritable patriarch is found dead and his diamonds are missing.

This documentary profile of film legend Elizabeth Taylor features clips from her memorable screen performances, as well as newsreel footage and photography, to reveal how closely the star's work and personal life were intertwined during her feature-film years. 
<h3>3:00 pm -- FILM</h3>
<b>Raintree County</b> (1958). The turbulent period of the Civil War underlies this epic story of America and its people. The film flows from southern plantations to war-torn Indianapolis as it traces the events of that era, from Lincoln's election in 1860 to Sherman's devastating march to the sea. Against this background is the story of Johnny Shawnessy (Montgomery Clift) and the two women in his life-- Nell Gaither (Eva Marie Saint) and Susanna Drake (Elizabeth Taylor), a beautiful New Orleans belle whom he marries. As Johnny searches for the legendary golden raintree, which is supposed to bring love, happiness, and the secrets of life itself, Susanna grows bored with being the wife of a schoolmaster. (R--10 p.m.)

(R--Dec. 1, 4:45 p.m.) <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38> <img src="../stills/dvs.gif" align=top alt="Descriptive Visual Service" height=18 width=43>

"Secret Daughter." Producer June Cross tells the story of her own family through the prism of the changing face of race relations in America. Cross, born to a white mother and an African-American father in the early 1950s, was given away by her mother to live with a black family in Atlantic City when she was four. She only saw her mother and stepfather, TV star Larry Storch, on visits to Hollywood during school vacations. But Cross's mother was afraid that her husband's career would be destroyed if the truth about Cross were discovered, so she kept her a secret. This expanded <b>Frontline</b> takes viewers on an epic journey across the racial divide, into the hidden world of Hollywood and deep into the complicated relationship between a daughter and the mother who gave her away.

<h3>9:30 pm -- MAYA LIN: A STRONG CLEAR VISION--A P.O.V. SPECIAL</h3>
The Washington, DC, Vietnam Veterans' Memorial was one of the most bitterly disputed public monuments in American history. Architect sculptor Maya Lin was thrust into the eye of the storm when her design for the memorial was chosen in 1981. Withstanding bitter attacks, the 21-year-old college student held her ground with clarity and grace. In this documentary, filmmaker Freida Lee Mock chronicles a decade in the life of this visionary artist.  <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38>
<h3>11:00 pm -- <a href=http://www.boston.com:80/wgbh/pages/mystery/mysteryhome.html>MYSTERY!</a></h3>
"Poirot VII: Hercule Poirot's Christmas." Part 2 of 2.  Spanning continents and generations, this story opens in a South African diamond mine at the close of the nineteenth century. Simeon Lee, a British prospector, kills a colleague for a cache of diamonds, but is seriously wounded in the fight. An Afrikaaner woman nurses Simeon back to health; Simeon repays the deed by abandoning her and their infant son, presumably to return to England with his recently acquired wealth. Forty years later a wizened, crusty Simeon requests Poirot's presence at a seasonal family reunion. This is no ordinary get-together, however; soon after Simeon announces his plan to cut his grown sons' allowances, the irritable patriarch is found dead and his diamonds are missing.  <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38> <img src="../stills/dvs.gif" align=top alt="Descriptive Visual Service" height=18 width=43>

It is a lesson in perseverance, self-reliance, and unwavering ethics. Among those interviewed are industry notables such as Peter Drucker, Steve Jobs, and Robert Galvin. (Also airs on <h2>KTCA, Oct. 3, 11 p.m.) </h2>
<h3>9:00 pm -- <a href=../newsnight/newsnight.html>NEWSNIGHT MINNESOTA</a>  <img src=../stills/ktca.gif  align=top alt="A KTCA production" height=21 width=21></h3>

<h3>10:00 pm -- SHERMAN'S MARCH THROUGH THE SOUTH</h3>
This documentary follows the path taken by Union General William T. Sherman and his soldiers as they marched deep into the Confederacy during the final months of the Civil War. Sherman began at Kennesaw Mountain in Georgia, pressed toward Atlanta, and went on to his famous March to the Sea culminating in the capture of Savannah. Period photographs, present-day video, interviews with historians, and reenactments of the fighting relay the mindset of the soldiers on both sides as well as the civilians who got in the way of the opposing armies. 
<h3>11:00 pm -- <a href=http://www.charlieroseshow.com/>CHARLIE ROSE</a></h3>

"We Are Family, 1974-1980." Part 3 of 6. After Vietnam and Watergate, America is looking for a "good father," and despite media befuddlement at the "born again" Jimmy Carter, his religious faith helps convince voters he can heal the nation. Carter's election heralds a new era of evangelical engagement in every area of modern life, from broadcast media to basketball. But modern life also means divorce, feminism and gay rights, and conservative Christians choose polarization on those issues over reuniting the American family. (Part 4 airs Oct. 27, noon) <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38>
<h3>1:00 pm -- GENESIS: A LIVING CONVERSATION WITH BILL MOYERS</h3>

<h3>3:00 pm -- <a href=http://www.boston.com:80/wgbh/pages/nova/novahome.html>NOVA</a></h3>
"Dinosaurs of the Gobi." The real Indiana Jones was paleontologist Roy Chapman Andrews, who, in the 1920s, led fossil-hunting expeditions among the towering dunes and desolate cliffs of Mongolia's Gobi Desert.

<h3>4:00 pm -- <a href=http://www.boston.com:80/wgbh/pages/nova/novahome.html>NOVA</a></h3>
"The Real Jurassic Park." For his best-selling book Jurassic Park and the Steven Spielberg film of the same name, Michael Crichton created the ultimate theme park filled with dinosaurs. Could such a park be built, or is it a wild fantasy?

Selections include Brahms' <b>Piano Concert No. 2 in B-flat Major, Op. 83</b>, and the composer's <b>Symphony No. 2 in D Major, Op. 73</b>.

Nevada Union is located in a relatively prosperous community where fan support takes on a religious fervor. Grant High is in an economically depressed area where options and self-esteem are limited for students and the community, making the pressure for athletic success all the more intense. The two schools' differences--as well as their mutual commitment to football--is an experience replicated in communities across the country.

<h2>Wednesday, October 23, 1996</h2>
<h3>5:30 am - 5:00 pm -- RADAR WEATHER</h3>
<h3>5:00 pm -- MOTORWEEK</h3>
<h3>5:30 pm -- EUROPEAN JOURNAL</h3>
<h3>6:00 pm -- NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT</h3>
<h3>6:30 pm -- TONY BROWN'S JOURNAL</h3>
<h3>7:00 pm -- RHYTHM AND ROOTS</h3>
The multi-textured fabric of traditional American music is highlighted in this program, which reflects the musical and cultural diversity that is uniquely American. Performances include ancient dances from Arizona's Zuni pueblo, and step dances and fiddle tunes from the southern Appalachians. Songs are sung in Spanish from Puerto Rico, in Cajun from southern Louisiana, and in Hawaiian from our fiftieth state. Also featured are blues tunes from clubs on Chicago's south side, and gospel from Detroit's houses of worship, all to celebrate American music and dance. Groups performing include the Native Hawaiian Band, Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys, Adoration-N-Prayze, Edwin Colon Zayas y Su Taller Campesino, Billy Branch and the Sons of Blues, Cellicon Dance Group, and the Fiddle Puppets.
<h3>8:00 pm -- CROSSROADS CAFE</h3>

<h3>9:00 pm -- <a href=../newsnight/newsnight.html>NEWSNIGHT MINNESOTA</a>  <img src=../stills/ktca.gif  align=top alt="A KTCA production" height=21 width=21></h3>
<h3>9:30 pm -- RIGHTS AND WRONGS</h3>
<h3>10:00 pm -- FRONTIERLAND/FRONTIERLANDIA</h3>
The title of this program refers not to a locale, but to the place where cultures meet, clash, and ultimately re-invent each other. Part traditional documentary, part campy travelogue, part history lesson, and part music video, <b>Frontierland/Frontierlandia</b> is a free-wheeling road movie that uses a variety of wonderfully off-beat examples to show how the United States and Mexico have co-opted the art, history, architecture, and music of "the other" and transformed it into kitsch. (Also airs on KTCA, Oct. 6, midnight.)
<h3>11:00 pm -- <a href=http://www.charlieroseshow.com/>CHARLIE ROSE</a></h3>

<h3>Noon -- WITH GOD ON OUR SIDE: THE RISE OF THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT IN AMERICA</h3>
"Prophets and Advisors, 1979-84." Part 4 of 6. Seizing the pro-family agenda, New Right conservative strategists midwife a brood of new Christian political organizations, most notably Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority. These groups experience a heady overnight success, registering millions of evangelical voters and helping sweep Ronald Reagan into office. Yet once in the White House, the president's mainline Republican advisors actively suppress traditional values issues. Evangelical leaders are forced to choose between "speaking truth to power" like biblical prophets or "going along to get along" in the political realm.

The program draws from more than 40 hours of recorded interviews with Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George Bush.  David Frost conducted these interviews between the years 1977-1995.  (R--KTCI/17, Oct. 28, 10 p.m.) <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38>
<h3>3:00 pm -- <a href=http://www.boston.com:80/wgbh/pages/frontline/frontlinehome.html> FRONTLINE</a></h3>
"The Choice '96." Season premiere. This dual biography of presidential candidates Bill Clinton and Bob Dole interweaves their public careers and private lives. The program provides an illuminating portrait of each man's record and character.  <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38> 
<h3>5:00 pm -- SEE JANE RUN: HOW WOMEN GET ELECTED</h3>
At the Women's Campaign School at Yale University, a class of dynamic women of different ages and backgrounds from around the country have the same goal: to get into politics. As these lawyers, students and businesswomen strive to make a difference in areas that reflect their specific interests, this documentary goes behind the scenes, revealing essential skills that must be mastered in order to run a winning campaign.  The fast-paced program includes insights from former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, and examinations of special fund-raising problems inherent to women, and the distinct differences between male and female governing styles. (R--KTCI/17, Oct. 29, 10 p.m.)
<a name=prime></a>
<h3>6:00 pm -- <a href=http://www.pbs.org/saf/index.html>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN FRONTIERS</a></h3>
"Inventing the Future." Season premiere. In the state-of-the-art Media Lab at MIT, host Alan Alda spends a fascinating week with the world's foremost "technoguru," Nicholas Negroponte. Viewers accompany Alda on an exploration of an environment in which desks, rooms, cars, musical instruments, and even a virtual dog interact with human beings. <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38>
<h3>7:00 pm -- <a href=../newtons/index.html>NEWTON'S APPLE</a> <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38>  <img src=../stills/ktca.gif  align=top alt="A KTCA production" height=21 width=21></h3><img src=../stills/ktca.gif  align=top alt="A KTCA production" height=21 width=21>
<h3>7:30 pm -- EYEWITNESS</h3>
"Ape." Apes are among the most intelligent, nimble, and fascinating characters in the animal kingdom. This program takes a close-up look at the entire primate family--from the tiny tarsier to the mighty mountain gorilla. <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38>
<h3>8:00 pm -- <a href=http://www.wnet.org:80/nature/index.html>NATURE</a></h3>
"Creatures in Crime." The program profiles Dr. Zackariah Erzinclioglu, a forensic scientist who uses clues from caterpillars, leeches, and other animals to help solve crimes. (R--Nov. 2, 2 p.m.) <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38> <img src="../stills/dvs.gif" align=top alt="Descriptive Visual Service" height=18 width=43>
<h3>9:00 pm -- <a href=http://www.boston.com:80/wgbh/pages/masterpiecetheatre/masterpiecehome.html>MOBIL MASTERPIECE THEATRE</a></h3>
"Bramwell II." Part 1 of 4. The empathic, committed, and iconoclastic young Dr. Eleanor Bramwell (Jemma Redgrave) returns to television. Bramwell is an anomaly in 1890s England: a doctor in an era when few women were admitted to the profession. Despite (or more likely because of) her talent, enthusiasm, and advanced ideas, she antagonizes many in the medical establishment, especially the eminent surgeon Sir Herbert Hamilton (Robert Hardy). Bramwell II is based on actual case histories from the Victorian era; Dr. Eleanor Bramwell is modeled on real doctors of that period. In this first episode, Bramwell's conservative Victorian outlook is jolted when she realizes Lady Cora's pregnant maid is married to a black African who is on the run and wants to take his family away with him. (Part 2 airs Nov. 3, 9 p.m.) (R--Oct. 29, 11 p.m.) <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38> <img src="../stills/dvs.gif" align=top alt="Descriptive Visual Service" height=18 width=43>
<h3>10:00 pm -- LISTENING AT THE LUNCHEONETTE</h3>
"Immigration Game." Tai Pan Bakery and Cafe owner Louis Chang and his customers--immigrants from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and elsewhere--reflect on the strange mix of personal expectations, cultural anguish and surprising freedom that has come with their choices to immigrate.  <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38>
<h3>10:30 pm -- SIGNAL TO NOISE: LIFE WITH TELEVISION</h3>
"Remote Control." Part 3 of 3. This final episode of the series looks at the future of television in the information age and the struggle between public and private interests. Segments include an examination of interactive television and a profile of the issues and people involved in the particularly American media experiment of public access TV. <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38>
<h3>11:30 pm -- GRACE METALIOUS AND PEYTON PLACE</h3>
The biggest-selling book in the history of pre-1960 publishing was Peyton Place, by Grace Metalious.  This documentary traces the course of the writer's career, as she rose from small town unknown to the toast of Hollywood.  Interviews recall Metalious' extraordinary talent as well as the personal tragedies that preceded her death at age 39.
<h3>Mid -- MEANS OF GRACE</h3>
A haunting and intimate portrait of a "madwife"--journalist, wife, and mother Ann Conger, who was institutionalized for paranoid schizophrenia in the 1950s, as told through her writings and by her filmmaker daughter. The program raises questions about the definition of mental illness and social control of women in society. (R--KTCI/17, Oct. 31, 10 p.m.) <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38>

<h3>7:30 pm -- <a href=http://www.trailside.com>TRAILSIDE</a></h3>
"Cross Country Skiing the Grand Canyon's North Rim." Host Peter Whittaker visits the Grand Canyon in the solitude of winter to explore the Canyon's North Rim on skis. Guest Bill Koch, the only American to ever win an Olympic Nordic medal, shows tips and techniques of skiing on groomed and ungroomed back country trails. (R--Nov. 2, 5:30 p.m.)
<h3>8:00 pm -- VAMPIRES IN NEW ENGLAND</h3>
Images of blood-thirsty, sensual, light-abhorring creatures feed today's popular impressions of vampires. But those images do not begin to tell the poignant and fascinating tale of vampire folklore that influenced New Englanders for a century. Drawing on insights from professional archeologists, historians, folklorists, funeral directors, physical anthropologists, medical doctors, and descendants of suspected vampires, this documentary examines reports of vampires in the eastern United States in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The program also explores myths outside of New England, with discussions of European folk belief, Bram Stoker's classic tale, <b>Dracula</b>, and twentieth century horror movies. (R--Oct. 31, 11 p.m.)
<h3>9:00 pm -- VOTE FOR ME: POLITICS IN AMERICA</h3>
"Politics 101/Making a Big Noise." Part 1 of 2. This program explores what it really takes to run for public office. From local precincts to the White House, Vote For Me follows attack-dog consultants, cigar-smoking campaign managers, bleary-eyed candidates and idealistic volunteers in pursuit of a single goal--victory on election night. The cast of characters showcased ranges from the nationally prominent, such as Newt Gingrich, Ann Richards, and Pat Buchanan, to guys like Ray Davis, the best political sign hanger in Chicago's third ward, and Emilio Naranjo, the 80-year-old political patron who ruled his rural New Mexico county with an iron fist for four decades. This first episode features tough-talking New York City-based media consultant Hank Sheinkopf; a desperate gubernatorial candidate's all-night bus tour of California, including a 3:00 a.m. photo opportunity in a chicken processing plant; and competing candidate training seminars in Atlanta, sponsored by the Christian Coalition and the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund. (Concludes Oct. 29, 9 p.m.) <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38>
<h3>11:00 pm -- NORTHWESTERN: THE SEASON TO REMEMBER</h3>
Through game highlights, interviews, and university history, this documentary tells the story of how the 1995 Northwestern University football team applied faith, talent, and teamwork--without academic compromise--to not only achieve its first winning season since 1971, but go all the way to the Rose Bowl. 
<h3>Mid. -- <a href=http://web-cr01.pbs.org/newshour/>THE NEWSHOUR WITH JIM LEHRER</a>  <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38></h3>

<h3>8:00 pm -- <a href=http://www.boston.com:80/wgbh/pages/nova/novahome.html>NOVA</a></h3>
"The Blimp is Back!" This program examines the troubled past and promising future of blimps, zeppelins, cyclocranes, and other airships, revealing that there's life in the old gas bags yet. <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38> 
<h3>9:00 pm -- VOTE FOR ME: POLITICS IN AMERICA</h3>
"Political Junkies/The Year I Ran for Congress." Part 2 of 2. In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, teenagers who already harbor gubernatorial ambitions put together coalitions to become student governor-for-a-day. In Johnston, Rhode Island (population 20,000), 200 people vie for city office. And Maggie Lauterer, an "average" citizen with no political experience, runs for Congress when no one else decides to challenge the powerful incumbent in her western North Carolina district. (See Oct. 28, 9 p.m.) <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38> 
<h3>11:00 pm -- <a href=http://www.boston.com:80/wgbh/pages/masterpiecetheatre/masterpiecehome.html>MOBIL MASTERPIECE THEATRE</a></h3>
"Bramwell II." Part 1 of 4. The empathic, committed, and iconoclastic young Dr. Eleanor Bramwell (Jemma Redgrave) returns to television. Bramwell is an anomaly in 1890s England: a doctor in an era when few women were admitted to the profession. Despite (or more likely because of) her talent, enthusiasm, and advanced ideas, she antagonizes many in the medical establishment, especially the eminent surgeon Sir Herbert Hamilton (Robert Hardy). Bramwell II is based on actual case histories from the Victorian era; Dr. Eleanor Bramwell is modeled on real doctors of that period. In this first episode, Bramwell's conservative Victorian outlook is jolted when she realizes Lady Cora's pregnant maid is married to a black African who is on the run and wants to take his family away with him.  <img src=../stills/cc.gif  align=top alt="Closed Captioned" height=21 width=38> <img src="../stills/dvs.gif" align=top alt="Descriptive Visual Service" height=18 width=43>

<h3>11:00 pm -- VAMPIRES IN NEW ENGLAND</h3>
Images of blood-thirsty, sensual, light-abhorring creatures feed today's popular impressions of vampires. But those images do not begin to tell the poignant and fascinating tale of vampire folklore that influenced New Englanders for a century. Drawing on insights from professional archeologists, historians, folklorists, funeral directors, physical anthropologists, medical doctors, and descendants of suspected vampires, this documentary examines reports of vampires in the eastern United States in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The program also explores myths outside of New England, with discussions of European folk belief, Bram Stoker's classic tale, <b>Dracula</b>, and twentieth century horror movies.
