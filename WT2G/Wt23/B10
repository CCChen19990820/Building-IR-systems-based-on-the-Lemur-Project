&gt;Is there a time which you should replace the ol' corncob?  The taste I'm
&gt;getting towards the bottom of the bowl is really starting to get strange
&gt;even tho' I clean the pipe and change the filter often.

Strange, how ? Like burnt corncob ?  (Does it taste like you left the
cornbread in the oven too long ?)  If so, you're just burning the cob at
the bottom, which might mean you didn't smoke your first few bowls all
the way down, and still haven't caked the bowl.

I replace mine when it becomes black and unattractive (rarely), or
more frequently, when I've chewed up the stem so badly it's no longer
smokeable, or even more frequently, when I lose it.

&gt;Again, sorry for
&gt;asking what is quite probably a silly question, but hey, what can I say?

Sorry, you only got permission to ask *one* question.  It would be against
my contract, therefore, to tell you what you can say.

Subject: Meerschaum musings and churchwarden chewings

A friend of mine just gave me an antique meerschaum (by Hayim Pinhas
of Istanbul, if that means anything to anyone), which looks like it's
of 40s or 50s vintage, not smoked too much. It's a nice-looking pipe,
but I'd like to make sure that the pipe is thoroughly clean before I
smoke it. Does anyone here know how to disinfect a meerschaum? I
understand that hot alcohol is used for briars, but shudder at what
that would do to the beeswax (which is what causes the meerschaum to
acquire its color.) Ben Rapaport's "Guide to Collecting Antique Pipes"
gives some hints on cleaning, but nothing really on germ killing. (Of
course, I could just load it up with some Pipeworks "Churchill"
mixture, which is sufficient to eradicate all life downwind :-)

Also in the news this week, I'd mailed Tim West several weeks ago,
asking for a price quote and a paper design for a churchwarden, as
(hopefully) a reward for passing my Ph.D. exam in February. It looks
beautiful - a half-bent Danish-style stem, chopped mouth and shank,
oversize bowl, and several choices of stain (or lack thereof). A goal
worth working for!

And, yes, I've been enjoying a pipe while I study, which occupies most
of my time now. Nothing like a nice bowl of John David's "JD 24" to
make the data flow analysis go better. And it's a good thing I've got
a good collection of briars built up - just hope the tobak (and the
stems) hold out until exam time! Until then (or until the next
mailing), 

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

Subject: Pipes Mailgroup

	Hi.

	please include me in the mailgroup, and let me start off by asking
	any overseas members if they know of a source for Mullingar's
	Tobaccos? They used to be available in the US in the early '70's,
	and I especially enjoyed "Knockbrack". I wrote various overseas
	distributors, and the company itself, but no one could help me.
	Has anyone seen this? As I recall, it might be Scottish.

	Another (lost) source of enjoyment were S.S. Pierce pipes. Several
	of my favorite pipes were from that company. They all broke in nicely
	and mellowed with age. Many far more expensive pipes I've bought over
	the years have disappointed.

	I'll chat more later.

	Brent Higinbotham
	Digital @ Andover, MA

[ I've given my library a cursory look for Mullingar's, but I'll give
it a more thorough look a little later.  Welcome to the group, Brent! -S. ]

Subject: Puffing in Pursuit of a Ph.D.

After many hours, many books, and many bowls of baccy, I managed to
pass my Ph.D. exam this week. Immense sigh of relief! I may actually
make it to the degree one of these days... (scuze me while I light up,
cause it ain't right to put the mailing together while I'm not
smoking!) As many of you who are also students surely know, a good
pipe helps improve concentration and attentiveness. Don't know why
this is, but I guess it works! :-)

As a reward, I'd promised myself a new pipe, of course. At Bill
Thacker's suggestion, I'd written to Tim West, a carver, around
December, and sent him a rough sketch of a "wizard pipe". Actually,
it's a large churchwarden with an egg-shaped bowl and a carved
push-fit (military) stem, rough top and saddle (where the stem fits),
and red/black stain finish. Tim's also going to include a shorter
Peterson-bit stem for travelling use. All this for about $65,
estimated He predicted it'd take him two or three weeks to carve - I
can't wait!

On related topics, on the front page of today's Central NJ "Home
News", is an article about a "smokers' rights" bill sponsored by
Assemblyman Willie Brown, D-Essex, which prevents employers from
discriminating against smokers when hiring or firing personnel. The
Senate sponsor, Francis McManimon, found it "offensive that the
companies might try to fire somebody just because he smoked on his
time off." (I agree!)

The article, like most such in the Home News, is basically
anti-smoking, and insinuates that Brown is sponsoring the bill due to
RJR contributions.  (Well, maybe just a little... :-) But it might
just be time to look up and write to a few legislators, so that yet
another of our rights doesn't get taken away. Remember, folks (with
apologies to Rick Hacker):

	      I F   P I P E S   A R E   O U T L A W E D,
     O N L Y   O U T L A W S   W I L L   S M O K E   P I P E S !

But for now, enjoy! And, as always,

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

The reason is simple; insurance companies give them lower insurance
rates if they don't hire smokers, because they'll pay statistically
less benefits.

I wish people would distinguish between cigarette smokers and pipe/cigar
smokers in measures like this !

Re: Sublets, insurance, civil rights, and of course pipes...

I'm still checking the mailbox anxiously, Bill, but no package from
Columbus yet. In the meantime, I bought a nice little bent from an
Israeli company named Alpha last week - cost was $10 on a 50%-off
sale. It looks fine - has some Dremel work on the bowl which probably
hides sand pits, but no visible fills, and it's an interesting shape
(stem meets bowl about 1/3 of the way up.) So there still are bargains
to be had. (I got it at John David's in Quaker Bridge Mall, if anyone
in NJ wants to catch the sale.)

Also to our NJ population: I'm looking for a summer sublet near
Rutgers (but not in high-crime areas) where both I and my pipes would
feel welcome. If you have any leads, please let me know! (I 'm clean,
pay rent regularly, and don't live with a stereo, pet, or child :-)

Regarding the insurance question: I think you're absolutely right. And
in the future, we may expect to see companies performing pee tests for
nicotine, if they're not doing so already (gaah! more civil rights
down the tubes!) On the other hand, I read somewhere (think it was the
Ephemeris) that cigar and pipe smokers are still considered nonsmokers
for insurance purposes. But should it matter? Some people can smoke
cigarettes occasionally, without getting nastily hooked, and I don't
think they should have to pay the insurance either.

By the way, I heard a report on NPR (of all places!) about this
phenomenon. There seem to be two types of cigarette smokers - those
who smoke on certain fixed occasions (like after dinner), and those
who basically smoke "while they're awake." If anyone else heard the
report, I'd appreciate details. In either case, I'd venture to say
that very few cigar and pipe smokers are in the second category.

If you've heard any news on pipe smoking and legislation to
decriminalize it :-), please write in! Until next time, (which should
be sooner to this time than this time was to the last),

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

Subject: Pipes-related software "movie".

Got this little program a few days back that I thought you would possibly
be interested in...

Dunno if you have access to an Apple // or not, but the program is called
PICTOSAGA.  It's about Mr. Pictograph, who gets tired of just representing
numbers in charts for "people too stupid to read bar graphs," so he goes
out into the world to try and find out what it's all about.
Along the way, he meets the man whom you sent us the ascii picture of a
while back (Rev. Somethingorother from the Church of the Subgenius) and the
Rev. gives Mr. Pictograph a pipe.  Well, this pipe ends up being a great
help for Mr. P. as he encounters all kinds of nasty situations.

It was written years and years ago, but it's still very cute and the pipe-
will-conquer-all references is what I thought you'd get a smirk out of. If
you, or anyone else on the list for that matter, use or have access to an
Apple // (][+ and up), I'd be happy to pack it and send it out.

From: Steve Masticola (????????@??.???????.???)
Subject: The Churchwarden Cometh

Well, the Timwest Original finally arrived last week, and we've been
getting acquainted a little bit. As advertised, it's half-bent, with
an egg-shaped bowl and chopped lip and shank, and about twelve inches
of stem. There's a noticeable divot on the front of the bowl, but no
other surface flaws, and Tim didn't charge full price due to the
divot. The workmanship is generally good, though there are some minor
nits to pick (vise marks on the stem, and what may or may not be a
light point in the stain.)

I'm discovering some general facts about life with churchwardens, and
with this one in particular. First, you have to have a hand free to
smoke; the leverage on the teeth is just too much for hands-off
operation. Of course, you can just let the bowl rest on your chest (as
I'm doing now). Second, you _have_ to maintain a dry mouth, or that
long stem gets a case of gurgles. Churchwarden pipe cleaners are
available (Tim sold me a bundle for $1), though standard cleaners
miiiight just make it if you use one from either end of the stem.
Peculiar to this pipe is its large (7/8") bowl, so any smoke costs
about 1/4 ounce of tobacco. Of course, a bowl lasts over an hour,
which is great for reading! Tim didn't pre-carbonize the bowl, so it's
getting "broken in" in the old-fashioned way. All in all, an
interesting "specialty piece."

Also in the local news: I bought a small bent for my roommate, on the
theory that it was in my best interest to have another pipe smoker in
the apartment (crafty ;-) Actually, he wanted to try a pipe and seems
to enjoy it. Which brings up a point - if someone you know likes the
smell of a pipe, or is trying to get off cigs, why not do them a favor
and buy them a starter briar?  They'll appreciate it, and you'll be
helping the cause of pipedom from a grass-roots level.

Until next time, folks,

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

Yes, the Ascii picture is of J.R. "Bob" Dodds, founder of the Church of
Subgenius.  "Bob" (whose name is always quoted thusly) is the ultimate
Earthly avatar of Slack.  He is Slack incarnate.  In his mouth is held
"the true Pipe", in which he smokes "frop" to achieve his most Slackful
states.  He is destined to save Earth from the Xists, so that we may
all be re-united with our Yeti ancestry and become Overmen.

If the above sounds intriguing, you might want to pick up "The Book Of
Subgenius".  Ten smackeroos at better (if less tasteful) bookstores
near you 8-)

You'll find that this leads to the buildup of a plug in the middle of the
stem, as pipe residue (aka "gunk") gets pushed inwards from both ends.

Subject: hello,  pipecraft is the topic.

Any pipe makers out there?  I've been dabbling at it for a little while now
(In between the honey-dos and what-nots).  I borrowed a miniature machine
lathe from my father that works pretty well.  Thanks to Steve I was able
to get the supplies and a convience tool (a tool that helps to make the
mortise and tenon for the stem) from PIMO inc.  I have made one pipe from
the handy dandy kit (We drilled the holes and fitted the stem for you).
This is rather boxy and not too pretty,  but I love it cause it is my first
pipe made by me.  I destroyed a briar block (please don't cry, we all need
to learn on something) cutting the stem on the lathe,  but the second block
turned (pardon the pun) out well.  I still need to clear the wood from the 
areas where the lathe can't get,  around the base of the shank and bowl.

Briar is a very hard wood and this task seems time consuming.   Anybody got
some good ideas?

Norm

[ Good going, Norm! Personally, I'd try a flex-shaft with a wood rasp
bit. Does anyone else have any help for Norm? -S. ]

BTW do you know what is healther smokeing camel filters or a pipe and not
inhaling.  (I currently smoke camels).
	--Aryeh

[ Welcome, and excuse me while I light a GBD Canadian to contemplate
your question...that's more like it... :-) Of course, when you smoke
cigarettes, you're also smoking paper. There are also chemical
additives in cigarette tobacco to make it burn more evenly. Pipe
tobacco, on the other hand, typically contains flavorings and such.
In "The Ultimate Pipe Book", Richard Hacker mentions that "in the
United States... pipe tobacco is normally treated with chemical
additives such as diethylene glycol, sugar, glucose, and molasses as
agents to keep the tobacco moist and sweet smelling. These tobacco
additives are not allowed in Great Britain." Additionally, "casings",
or flavorings, are added.  Hacker gives "... chocolate, honey, rum,
cherry, apple, peach, banana, coffee, liquor, and a host of other
flavorings" as possible additives. From the health standpoint, it
seems you're best off smoking a pipe with unflavored English tobacco.
Additionally, pipes are, IMHO, more fun, more pleasant to nonsmokers,
and held in better regard than cigarettes. Let us know what you
decide! -S. ]

Subject: Pipes

Dear Steve Masticola:
	I have been a pipe smoker for about two years now and enjoy it
very much.  I have a small assortment of pipes and am expanding my collection
almost constantly.  I also like to try out new and different blends of 
tobbaccos and keep a list of where I bought them, name, and characteristics.
I would like the chance to share my experiences with other and gain from
them their own experiences that may help inhance my own pipe-smoking pleasure.
	Thank you for your consideration.

					Thomas A. Chrisman

[ Tom, I'm having trouble reaching your address. If any of our members
at UIUC could help out and forward this to horizon, I'd appreciate it.
If you have a chance to stop in at Jon's Pipe Shop (509 E. Green St.,
Champaign, IL), I've heard excellent reviews from all quarters, and
Jon is most gracious and accomodating. Hope I can stop in there this
summer myself! In any case, welcome, and we hope to hear more from
you! - S. ]

Subject: Pipes vs. Cigarettes

?????@????.????.??? enquires:

&gt; BTW do you know what is healther smokeing camel filters or a pipe and not
&gt; inhaling.  (I currently smoke camels).
 
Camels are known to be quite carcinogenic, of course, when burned.
Plus, they almost always carry syphilis and other nasties.  If you
must smoke a desert animal, go with a Dromedary, they're cleaner.

As for cigarettes vs. pipes... I've always heard that pipes were much
safer so long as you don't inhale the smoke.  That avoids the two
biggest dangers associated with cigarette smoking, lung cancer and
heart disease.  (And I'll add that pregnant mothers could probably
safely smoke pipes, as well)

Past that, considerations of which smoke is more harmful are purely
secondary.  It might be safer to smoke cigarettes than a pipe if you
inhale neither, but not many people do that. After all, why smoke
w/out inhaling if not for the taste ?


And our Most Referential Sponsor, Steve Masticol, cites:

&gt; In "The Ultimate Pipe Book", Richard Hacker mentions that "in the
&gt; United States... pipe tobacco is normally treated with chemical
&gt; additives such as diethylene glycol, sugar, glucose, and molasses as
&gt; agents to keep the tobacco moist and sweet smelling. These tobacco
&gt; additives are not allowed in Great Britain." Additionally, "casings",
&gt; or flavorings, are added.  Hacker gives "... chocolate, honey, rum,
&gt; cherry, apple, peach, banana, coffee, liquor, and a host of other
&gt; flavorings" as possible additives. 

The British are such snobs about such things.  The implication is
that while we Yanks are perverting nature by adding such artificial
nasties as sugar, glucose, and molasses, it's perfectly fine to 
toss in flavorings of chocolate (mostly sugar), honey, fruit, and
distilled spirits.  

Of course, the Germans got even with them.  Beer drinkers are well aware
of the German Rhineheitsgebot, a law which requires that beer may be only
be produced using barley, hops, water, and yeast, a requirement met by
very few British (or American) beers.  And so it happened that when a
British embassy in Germany tried to import a quantity of Guinness for
a party, the German customs officials refused to admit it, claiming
that "we're not sure what it is, but it certainly isn't beer."

It was after all the English who introduced tobacco to the western
world, and as such we can be *snobbish* about these things.  Most of the decent
pipe tobacco available in England is imported from the Netherlands, although
there are many specialist shops catering for the needs of the more
discerning smoker.

&gt; Of course, the Germans got even with them.  Beer drinkers are well aware
&gt; of the German Rhineheitsgebot, a law which requires that beer may be only

&gt; a party, the German customs officials refused to admit it, claiming
&gt; that "we're not sure what it is, but it certainly isn't beer."
&gt; 
 
The problem here is one of semantics.  While the americans associated beer
with some cold fizzy liquid, we English mean ALE.  Lager is the usual term
used in the UK for what the Germans refer to as beer (and they even drink it
chilled).  For your information, Guinness is a *stout* and not a *beer*
and it is not brewed in the UK, but in the Irish Republic (Eire).  This
would explain why the germans correctly identified that it was certainly not beer,
it was not even ale.

Respectfully,

Andrew J. Chipperfield.

Subject: Re: pipes vs cigarettes

Just a short note about my recent experiences of pipe smoking vs cigarettes.

Having been a cigarette smoker for about 7 years, catching colds every 
year, and having to put up with continual price rises (a pack of 20
Benson and Hedges costs 180 pence (sterling)(nearly $3 US)), I decided 
to try to give up the cigarettes and just smoke pipes. 
(for comparison a 25g pack of Clan tobacco cost around 135 pence)

Some observations:

- people who have never before complained about smoking have now done so.
- I am now unable to smoke during the day at work.
- the follow on effect from above is that by the time I get home to my
pipe (which is very difficult to light in a car in moving traffic),
I am so desperate for a smoke that I dont enjoy it.

The net result is that now I get little or no enjoyment out of my 
pipe smoking.  I have lapsed back into smoking cigarettes during 
the day and the situation with the pipe is beggining to improve.

The question:

Has anybody else come across this prejudice of pipes, or suffered
in the same way when trying not to smoke cigarettes?

Keep on puffing,

Andy Chipperfield.

[ I smoke my pipe in the car all the time, Andy - the key is doing the
critical operations at stoplights. Hope some of our other readers can
comment on their experiences regarding pipe vs. cigarette smoking at
work... - S. ]

Re: A new pipe magazine; a pleasant English tobacco

Well, summer is over and the real "pipe season" is soon to begin. Here
at Pipes Newsgroup Plaza (sorry, Tom &amp; Ray :-), we have a couple of
pleasant news items to report, over a small Peterson loaded with John
David's "African", and a glass of iced tea. Join us now, as we write:

Last week, I received a copy of "The Compleat Smoker", a new quarterly
magazine for the pipe and cigar lover. It looks much more professional
than the (now defunct) "Pipe Smoker and Tobacciana Trader" - all
articles are well-written and the photography is good.  Feature
articles include:

	"Of Shanks and Stems - The Bridge between Smoker and Tobacco"
	"The Thinking Man's Pipe: The Peterson Story"
	"Tobacco and the Tsar"
	"Wrapping it Up: Judging a Cigar by its Cover"
	"The Quest for Briar"
	"Are we Looking through the Surgeon General's Smoke Screen?"
	"The Charring Light"

The cover painting by Anisa Nedzelnyitskaya is also most attractive!
Tom Dunn, Rick Hacker, and Ben Rappaport have all lent endorsements to
the mag. Write for a copy, or a 1-year subscription ($17.50) to:

	The Compleat Smoker
	P.O. Box 7036
	Evanston, IL 60201

I did - and your editor is never (well... hardly ever :-) wrong!

Also, I've recently picked up a couple of cans of "After Hours", a
mild English tobacco by Lane Ltd. Very nice smoke, tasty and no tongue
bite. The price ($7 for a 4 oz. tin) is a bit off-putting, but you
might manage to find it discounted as I did (but not at the same
store, since I bought out their stock). 

In the same sale, I got a 2-oz. can of Robert McConnell's "Red
Virginia Superb", which I found a bit harsh. Oh well, you can't win
'em all!

Until next time,

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

I'm unfamiliar with the blend you're referring to, but in general, I find
that people who object to pipe smoke do so for one of two reasons:

a) They object to all smoke, either because of allergies, health concerns,
	or general contrariness
b) You're smoking something that smells bad.

I smoke a deep, dark cavendish; very moist, very aromatic.  It smells
good.  For every complaint I get (either a) or b) above) I average about
three compliments.

Most smokers seem to abandon the aromatics for English blends; I've tried
them from time to time, and have never cared for them.  I did observe,
though, that when flirting with these tobaccos I started getting comments
from friends and aquaintances of the sort "Say, did you change tobaccos ?"
As these were invariably accompanied by frowns, I took it that the change
was not appreciated 8-)

&gt; - I am now unable to smoke during the day at work.

While IMHO even the worst-smelling pipeweed is twice better than 
cigarette smoke, the smell of the pipe is much more pervasive.   I 
suppose this is why pipes (and cigars) are not allowed on airplanes,
even when cigarettes are permitted.  Again, a change to a more pleasant-
smelling tobac might solve this problem.

&gt; - the follow on effect from above is that by the time I get home to my
&gt; pipe (which is very difficult to light in a car in moving traffic),
&gt; I am so desperate for a smoke that I dont enjoy it.

Do you inhale the smoke, or just "mouth" it ?   I smoke fairly heavily,
but not at work.  While I especially miss the taste right after lunch,
I never find myself desperate for a smoke.  In fact, I have at times gone
"cold turkey" for as long as a week (nothing like taking a business trip
and forgetting to bring your briar!) with no adverse affects; had I been
at all desperate, I could easily have picked up a corncob at any
drugstore.

As for the car, you have two choices:  

a) use cruise control and steer with your knees (this is quite do-able
on highways, for instance)

b) fill and light before you pull out of your parking space.

If you use a lighter, as opposed to matches, one-handed lighting in the
car is no trouble.

&gt; Has anybody else come across this prejudice of pipes

The only prejudice I've noticed about pipes is that people classify
you as an intellectual (unless you're smoking a cob, in which case,
you're a hillbilly 8-)   I can live with that 8-)

Subject: Please remove me from the "pipes" mailing list


I've, err...well, I quit smoking. ;-)   I've got ulcer problems,
and while the pipe-smoking is psychologically relaxing, the tobacco
induces acid secretions that aren't very good for me.  So as much as
I've enjoyed it, I've given it up.  I've packed everything away in
case I want to take it up again in 5 or 10 years...but for now, it's
probably better for me to refrain from my favorite vice. ;-)

BTW, having gone through (1) quitting smoking and (2) cutting out caffeine,
I can say that (2) is *much* harder.  I still get headaches from not
having enough caffeine!

Thanks, and pleasant smoking!
Rich

[ Rich won't be getting this mail, of course, but it was a nice
letter, so I decided to put it in anyway. Perhaps one of our other
members could comment about pipe smoking, stomach trouble, and ways to
insure that the twain never meet? Hope we can hear from you again
someday, Rich! -S. ]

Re: A few pipeish notes

The holiday season has come, and for most of us has gone. Like some
lucky individuals, it left a few pipes in its wake...

While at the local Tinder Box, I bought a $1 special ("Imported Briar"
[as opposed to the domestic kind, which doesn't grow here anyway :-],
large router marks in an unsuccessful attempt to hide splits in the
grain). It's a small billiard shape, something I haven't posessed
before, and it's working out well. At the price, I don't care too
much... :-) While at a restaurant, I persuaded my friend Diane (an
inveterate cigarette smoker) to try a puff - reaction: "This is
_nice_!" Next trip to the pipe shop, I'll try to find another dollar
special for her too! My parents also got me a nice rough-surface
Peterson. I really like them - you can chomp down and not worry about
the stem too much.

Also, we got into the _Ephemeris_! (Although Tom spelled the mail
address slightly wrong, anyone with net experience should be able to
figure it out.) I'm _still_ waiting to get issue #2 of _The Compleat
Smoker_, and will write to the publisher before the postage goes up
again. Has anyone else heard from these people?

On the down side, it seems that two of my present roommates are moving
out, and at least one of the guys moving in seems to be an antismoker.
I've decided that next year I'm going to actively hunt for fellow pipe
smokers to dorm with. Any input from the Rutgers contingent would be
most welcome!

In the meantime, hope you enjoyed Christmas, preferably with the stump
of a pipe held tight in your teeth, and the smoke encircling your head
like a wreath... :-) Until next time,

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

Subject: I'm still alive...


Hello everybody,

   After a veeryy loong period away from the pipe mailgroup, due to unstable
computer accounts, I'm happily back.  I've kept up with the pipe digests by
logging into my previous account, but since it was a long distance call away
from me, I barely had time to read the message without going bankrupt.
Remember, I have to buy pipes too :-).

  Anyway, I am happy that the group that I had the honor to have started along
with Steve is well, alive and smoking (hopefully a nice English blend - no
flames, I'm not smoking now :-) . Hopefully now I will be able to be more
active in the mailgroup, since apparently I got a fairly stable account in one
of our clients.

  In this past year that I was absent of the group, I have acquired a number
of pipes, which of course would take a long time to list them and talk about
all of them now.  The one I would like to mention is a full bent pipe bought
at the Connoisseur (remember Steve) in NYC.  It is a very nice pipe with a
bird's eye grain.  I mentioned this pipe because the person in the pipe store
(the same one when me and Steve were there almost two years ago) told me that
the shape, a full bent, was named after a South African general who wanted a
pipe that would be easy to hold in the mouth while giving orders in the battle
field, and whose name I have forgot (unfortunately !!!).  Anyway, if someone
knows more about it, please share with us.  I will try to find out more about
it myself.  It was also my X-mas pipe, since part of the money to purchase the
pipe came from a gift certificate given to me. It would be nice to hear from
everybody about any X-mas pipes bought and/or received as X-mas presents.

  Inspired by the shape of this pipe, together with the fact that I am working
in a workstation running X windows, I have created a nice bitmap to be used as
the root cursor.  I am sending the file with the bitmap and instructions to
Steve and if someone has a workstation with X windows, send Steve mail and he
can send to you .  Sorry Steve, I don't want to give more you work, but I
figured would be easier in terms of e-mail addressing to contact you.  Anyway,
I hope those of you who got X windows will enjoy the nice pipe cursor.

  Continuing with my catching up of old pipe digests, I remember recently a
message in which we had the sad note of Rich Kulawiec, who unfortunately had to
quit (aarrgghh !! what a terrible word...) smoking his pipe.  He says in his
message that he had ulcer and had to quit (aarrrgghh !!!).  When I begun to
smoke pipes and really started to enjoy it fully, I got concerned about the
possibility of an ulcer over a long period of time.  The solution I found for
myself was to drink milk on a VERY regular basis.  I like milk a lot, so I had
no problem.  I usually drink a glass of milk after my night pipe at home.  It
may be a little empirical, but it also may work.

  Finally I want to thank Steve for keeping up with the pipes digest which,
like a pipe itself, gives all of us a moment of tranquility.

- Elias Mazur

[ Good to have you back, Elias! I believe the general's name was Oom
  Paul; I have one of his pipes too (from Savinelli). Can I forward
  your posting to Rich? -S. ]

Subject: Pipe bitmaps for root cursor.


Steve here is the bitmap file for the pipe cursor.

--------- cut here -------------

Instructions:

  1) save the first bitmap in a file called 'bigpipe'
  2) save the second bitmap in a file called 'bigpipeMask'
  3) give the command:

     xsetroot -cursor bigpipe bigpipeMask -fg black -bg brown

  4) enjoy the pipe...


---------- cut here for first bitmap  (bigpipe) ---------

Hello,

How has everybody been?  I did not get a new pipe for xmax but I did get
a very nice xmas present from my brother-in-law.  He went to a couple of 
different tobacco stores and bought about 5 different blends.  Put them
all in a box along with some matches.  It was great.  I don't smoke too
much (in California anything that smokes is considered evil) but about
one or two bowls a day makes me happy.  I currently have all the tobacco
still in plastic bags and in the refrigerator.  Is this a good place to keep
it or should I put it someplace else?

I currently have one pipe that I use almost exclusively.  I know this is not
a good idea.  But I just enjoy smoking this pipe more than others.  I'll
look around for some specials (the budget currently does not allow for
classics).  Till next mail,  keep in touch.

Norm

I've worked in computers for a few years now,  but I still can't believe
how these things work.  The message you just sent to 13 seconds to get 
here.  From NY!  anyhow,  add my latest to the next digest.  I,  like
Elias,  look as much forward to the pipes digest as a new pipe.  It
really kicks my day of great to see the masticol header in my mail box.
Keep up the good work.  

Norm

[ Glad to provide the service, Norm, and we're always glad to hear

Re: Soapbox mode ON!

Many of the readers in other states may have heard of Jim Florio, the
governor of New Jersey who became spectacularly unpopular after
raising the state sales tax last year. I was willing to forgive him
this; it seems right to pay for what we get from government. However,
I won't forgive what he did this week. He vetoed a piece of
legislation which would have prohibited discrimination against hiring
those who choose to smoke in our own homes. That means us, folks.

We have to face the fact that we're losing ground against the
antismokers. I'm not talking about the people who are uncomfortable
around tobacco; many are, and I'm perfectly willing to be polite. I'm
speaking of our self-appointed moral guardians who don't want anyone
smoking. Anything. Ever.

Now, I'm no great fan of the cigarette companies either; they've done
a lot of things that are morally shoddy, and that's a fact. But I
firmly believe that, as an adult, I am capable of taking care of my
own health and my own morality. Florio and his ilk say that we am not
our own best moral guardians. They say that some company should have
the power to regulate what we may do on our own time and in our own
homes. I regard this as a profoundly un-American attitude.

Like many of you, I choose to smoke a pipe. We must also, it seems,
choose to defend our right to do so without harassment. This I will
do, and I encourage others to join me. Even if you don't live in New
Jersey, antismoking discrimination is on the rise and will affect you
too, sooner or later. We must defend our rights or lose them.

For those who would like them, here are some smokers' rights groups
listed in the _Pipe Smokers' Ephemeris_. I'll be writing to some of
these and will let you know the results.

Grass-roots groups:

	American Smokers' Alliance
	Suite 560
	3401 West End Avenue
	Nashville, TN 37203
	
	Smokers Unite
	32 North Bartlett St.
	Kingston, Ont.
	K7L 1X7
	Canada
	
	Smokers' Freedom Society
	8615 st. Lawrence Blvd.
	Office 300
	Montreal, Que.
	H2P 2M9
	Canada

	American Pipe and Accessory League
	Cano Ozgener, President
	4121 Hillsboro Road
	Suite 209
	Nashville, TN 37215

Industry sponsored groups:

	Choice
	A service of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company
	P.O. Box 453
	Winston-Salem, NC 27102

	Smoker's Advocate - National Edition
	A service of Philip Morris U.S.A.
	P.O. Box 96599
	Washington D.C. 20078-7552

	Smokers' Caucus
	A service of Philip Morris U.S.A.
	P.O. Box 90738
	Washington DC 20077-7551

Also, write for a 56 page manual on public issues and protecting your rights:

	Consumer Affairs Department
	Philip Morris U.S.A.
	120 Park Avenue
	New York, NY 10017


However you choose to do so, I hope you'll help, so that we can
continue to 
					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

Subject: Re:  PIPES DIGEST REQUEST

 Thanks.  I don't want to see the list go political, and would hate to be
the agent of that change, so please use your judgement.  I might rather that
you simply say:

  David Chesler (now ???????@?????.???.???) replies that he is ambivalent
about the failure of the New Jersey anti-discrimination for smokers act
to pass.  On the one hand he dislikes Big Tobacco and believes addicted
cigarette smokers do use a disproportionate amount of health care and
sick days; on the other hand he doesn't like Big Brother coming into
his house (but also doesn't want Big Brother in his private employment
contract either) and finds pipe smokers to face worse discrimination,
for less reason, than cigarette smokers.

  - David

[ Note to the perplexed: I received some correspondence from David and
asked him if I could post it. This was his reply. I'd agree with it in
some points, the main one being that I'd rather not see the mailgroup
get involved in political harangues (and probably shouldn't have
encouraged such discussions in the first place). For more pipely
activities, read on. -S. ]

Subject: Clay Pipes?

I'm glad to see the Digest alive and kicking, again.

Question, to the world at large:  I've just acquired a couple of
clay pipes, one with a long stem, and one short.  Is there anything
I should be particularly aware of, before smoking them?  Do they
break-in as briars do?  Should I do anything special?

I have a couple of pipes with ceramic bowls, but I've never tried
smoking either of them.  One has an incredibly elaborate carved
ebony stem, more than a meter in length, with mother-of-pearl inlays
and a flexible tube connecting bit to stem.  It's Danish, and my
father acquired it because it was like the pipes he remembers old
men smoking during his childhood in turn-of-the-century Denmark. 
The other belonged to my great-grandfather, is apparently American,
and has a ceramic joint that connects the ceramic bowl to the
unpeeled stem.  It, too has a flexible connection to the bit.

The new pipes are much simpler, and strongly resemble illustrations
I've seen in 18th- and early 19th-century publications.  Any help
would be appreciated.

Hi! 
I have a question for you pipe smokers.  How old were you when you
started smoking a pipe?  Did you start smoking a pipe, or did you
switch from cigarettes or cigars?  
I don't smoke right now, but have always been curious to try smoking 

a pipe...so I am curious how others got started.  THanks -- will

[ I'll answer briefly Will - hope some others will too. I remember
sneaking off to the woods to smoke a homemade pipe at the ripe old age
of eight; bought my first "real" pipe at age 15. Still have it; don't
smoke it much these days. Never cared much for cig*s.

If you're curious about pipes, why not go to a tobacconist and ask for
a good-quality starter set? Ask him or her (or us) to give you some
pointers about how to smoke your pipe for better enjoyment. Most of us
really like it! - S. ]

Subject: When I started


I started smoking in college.  There is something about a pipe that lends
itself to a quiet and relaxing moment which is just what I needed from time
to time during the college days.  I stopped for a few years when my daughter
was born but went back to the pipe.  I usually smoke only one or two bowls 
a day and if I try two in a row I can start to get dizzy after all these
years.  I'll go for a few days without a pipe (which actually makes the next
light *very* enjoyable).  If you know someone who smokes a pipe then you should
get together with him to light.  You can ask questions and discuss preferences.
As with anything worthwhile it takes a little practice to get the most pleasure
from your pipe.  Knowing the right feel of the load,  how to light,  keeping
an even burn,  and good pipe maintenance are all a part of enjoying your pipe.

Well enough is enough,  I sound like an ad for RJR.  Hope you get as much or
more pleasure from your pipe as I did from mine.  Steve,  I still have my
first 'real' pipe (not bought from the drug store) and I keep it in the 
office of emergency situations. 

P.S.  Does anybody know the situation with Andre's pipe shop.  I visited
him once and meant to go back and buy a pipe while he was there crafting
but I never did.  The shop I believe was destroyed during the '89 quake
and I would like to know if he started up again?

Subject: Pipes &amp; Matches.


	Steve, a while back there was an issue dealing with the
availability and location of "strike-anywhere" matches.  Where might I
find them? 

	Also, to the pipes in general: What's the "life-span" of tobacco?

Oh, a propos (french for man -k :-), what are the opinions of the group co
concerning &gt;hand-rolled&lt; cigarettes?

					-rick.

[ Sorry, Rick, but I really don't think those matches are made
anymore! (Other members, please correct me if I'm wrong.) As for the
"life-span" of tobacco, it can be re-humidified if it dries out - just
place a moist wad of paper towel on top, and mix it around carefully
(so as not to crumble it into dust!) every 12 hours or so. Repeat
until it's properly moist, but not too wet - about like when it came
new. I've revived some "sale" tabak that way. I'll let other members
answer about the hand rolled cigs, having no opinion myself. -S. ]

Subject: Re:  Pipes Digest #51 - March 2, 1991

In answer to will thomas' question (Mr. Moderator: please summarize this
for me, do y'all want to hear all the details of all the stories?) about
when I first smoked a pipe:
 Within a few weeks of starting college, age 17, I bought a cheap pipe and
some tobacco at the local tobacconist, and tried to learn how to smoke it.
I eventually bought some pipe-smokers' guidebook, and acquired a few Dr.
Grabow's.  My roommates were not too happy (especially the asthmatic) because
we were in that dorm because we were non-smokers (well I wasn't one when I
filled out the rooming form!).  We adopted some compromise after he stuck
my pipe in the freezer.  (Another roommate figured "smoke?" meant tobacco,
and since he only smoked marijuana answered "no", leading to all sorts of
goings-on.)
 My father gave me my first cigarette at about age 5, and as he predicted
I wasn't particularly curious through my teens, and never really picked
up habitually cigarette smoking.  I stayed up the night before a final
my first term in college, studying and chain-smoking Carlton's, then
overslept and gave up both of those habits, although I still smoke a
Turkish Special every few months, particularly in bars and clubs, and
will bum a cigarette during times of high stress.  (I currently only
smoke pipes on ocassion, usually outdoor things like football games and
hikes.)
 BTW my father had "always" owned a pipe, and every few years at my
mother's urging grew a beard, lit up a bowl, and posed for a picture,
but he is basically a non-smoker.

"Strike anywhere match" = Ohio Blue Tip.  I haven't looked, but I'm sure
as recently as five years ago I saw them at a supermarket.  I prefere
a butane lighter.

Hand-rolled cigarettes:
  Rolling is as much fun, and more mysterious, than filling a pipe. 
Georgopolous (NYC) sells tobaccos for that purpose as well.  Personally
I never got the hang of it.  Hand-rolled cigarettes are supposed to cost
half as much as store-bought (I think I read this on a bag in a drug
store) but you smoke so little that the tobacco gets stale [*] then it
doesn't matter either way.
  Many folks will assume a hand-rolled cigarette is a joint.

[*] Lifespan:
  Water is only one factor, the aromatic oils will also evaporate, probably
more so with flavored tobaccos (rum, whiskey, mango, cherry, etc).  I have
an inexpensive humidor jar (looks like a small glass cookie-jar with a clay
piece in the top I fill with water when I think of it.)  There are also
metal cases with that porous clay in it to put in a pouch.  I think I read
that pouches preserve the tobacco much more poorly than do jars, and should
not be used for long-term storage.  For me if I have any tobacco left after
a year or so I toss it - gives a good excuse to visit the tobacconist :-)
  Pipo (the Turkish State Monopoly's pipe brand) is imported nearly dry in
steel cans that rust.  It has to be humidified before smoking.
  What do freezers do to tobacco?  I bought a second pack of cigarettes that
I won't smoke for a while, and hermetically sealed it in cellophane
and aluminum foil, and put it in the deep freeze.  I haven't defrosted it yet.
Was this a smart move?

Thanks for the quick response!

I got my first pipe with $3.49 the first year I was in the US
as a graduate student.  The pipe was to be my company for the
long hours of study.  There were not many smokers around, so
I did not really appreciate pipe smoking that much.

We, my wife and I, came back to Taiwan three and half years ago
to teach.  I somke pipes occasionally and joined the pipe club
here in Taipei.  We gather about every other month in a JAPANESE
resturant and have Japanese food while puffing.  But it was not until
some three weeks ago when I finished reading Hacker's THE book
that I started to appreciate the meaning and pleasure of pipe
smoking.  In addition to TPSE, I also asked for a few other
publications about pipes.
Currently I own about 20 pipes, most of which were bought in
the US.  None are expensive; the most expensive one cost me $30.
However, I am in the process of acquiring a few pipes of better
quality and would very much like to have the input from you and
the others.

Really glad to get in touch with you.  I shall smoke in peace!

Subject: Here am I...

Hello there!

This is my little introduction of myself. I'll also take the
opportunity to ask the rest of you a couple of beginner's
questions.

The first pipe I bought (which is still the only I've owned) was a
straight stemmed, simple one (I think the model is called apple or
billiards...). That was in 1987, when I was 20. I didn't smoke it
until a month later when I and my wife (then fiancee) were in London.
In London I bought 50 grammes of Old London Sweet Cut at G. Smith &amp;
Sons at Charing Cross Road in a round metal box.  I smoked that
tobacco during our stay in London, but then my smoking habits were
about nonexistent until this January (I bought a small pouch of Borkum
Riff in '88, but it got so old and dry and I didn't get it moist
again...).  So, in the middle of January this year I went to a local
tobacconist and bought a pouch of Borkum Riff, which I smoked
contently during the month it lasted (I'm very modest in my smoking
habit). The Borkum Riff didn't last longer than to the end of
February, so this Saturday I bought my next tobacco experience: Mac
Baren's Plumcake. During the few days I've smoked this tobacco (which
I find most inspiring, by the way) I've started to considered buying
another pipe, and perhaps an additional brand of tobacco... or two.
This is the state-of-my-pipe-hobby.

Now, the questions. When I bought that first tobacco in G. Smith &amp;
Sons in London I also found a small pamphlet published by the
Pipesmoker's Council (UK). It's from that little pamphlet that I've
gathered all I know about tobacco and pipe smoking (I even read about
how to light the pipe! which now is quite easy... but then it
wasn't!). Well, I realize there must be loads of books published on
the subject of pipe smoking and tobaccoes. What I need to know is
which ones are good and which publisher published them.

Secondly, I've read about a tobacco described as "rum-soaked perique".
Do any of you listers know of a brand even remotely similiar to this
description?

Hope any of you can answer both or one of my questions! Post here or
to me directly (depending on the tradition of the list).

Best,
/andreas

Sorry that this reply is so late, but things is a bit hectic this a' ways. :)

Well, the Ohio Blue Tip Matches still are being made.  Just got some not
even 2 weeks ago.  I don't know what exactly to do if your local stores
aren't stocking them.  The most I can give you is the address:

Universal Match Corp.
Kenner, LA  70062-7096

Also, as for my story...  Well, there's not really anything really interesting
to tell.  I've seen a very small number of people smoking pipes who seemed
quite happy with it (being not only a "habit," but a hobby also.)  So, when
I had a couple o' extra bucks in my pocket, I bought a Dr. Grabow corn-cob &amp;
a pack of cherry tobacco (can't remember the brand offhand.)  I liked it alot.
A lot of friends of mine saw I was having fun and couldn't stand it so they
went out and bought their own.  Now there's a small pack of younger persons
running around this small town of mine all clad in demin and leather and
whatnot with nice (not expensive, but nice nonetheless) pipes hanging out
of their maws.  An interesting picture, at least in my mind.  Well, I continue
to smoke a pipe because, as most others have stated, it lends itself well
to quiet contemplation or a relaxing moment (and this is most welcome while
in the middle of a compiler design class. :)  I only own two pipes (a replace-
ment corn cob, and a Grabow Grand Duke.)  When some money starts coming my
way, no doubt I'll be purchasing more &amp; more.

Well, I suppose that's all I have to say.  Thanx for the time to say it.

Steve,

Thanks for the interesting mess.  Now I got a problem for you.
Two days ago I was using a quality Castello and managed to have
the mouthpiece broken.  I learned from the expensive lesson that one should
never try to pull out the mouthpiece while smoking a pipe.
I am in the process of finding a place to have it repaired.  There
is no repair shop here in Taiwan.  I would like to send it to the US for
repair.  I know both Levin Pipes and Connoisseur Pipe Shop do repair
works but have no idea which one is more reliable.  Would your give me
some advice on this matter, provided that this won't cause too much
trouble for you.  I thank you in advance.

                                            Sean 5/3/91

[ No trouble at all, Sean; always glad to create an interesting mess!
I've never used either Levin or Connoisseur for repairs; the last few
I've had done have been from:

	Pipes Unlimited
	19 Auburn Ave.
	Utica, NY 13501

Stem repairs run about $8.50. Elias uses this shop as well; I've had
quite good results with them. -S. ]

As a dedicated, very-low-volume pipe smoker, I struggle almost

Steve,

Thank you so much for the info.  I have sent the Castello and an
Alfa for repair.

A few pieces of information that may be of interest to you and the
members out there.

The Pipe Club of Taiwan, Taipei Division just had another meeting
a few days ago.  It was again in a Japanese resturant.  Some ten
members showed up, some with their spouses.  Considering the wrestling
in our Congress and the street demonstrations which you might have
seen in the SPORTS section of your evening news, the turn-out rate was
OK.  We wined and dined for a couple of hours, then an informal contest
was held.  The winner kept his pipe lit for about 89 minutes, a
respectable record.  The Chairperson made it a goal to be at least
the second runner-up in the next International Pipe Smoking Contest.
(Our club sent a delegation to Japan last year and finished 4th.)

A few grad students here asked me where to buy a pipe and get
started.  I have yet to asked them whether it is because they
like me or it is because they like the smell of pipe tobacco I brought
with me into the classroom that they want to join the world of mature
men.  I gave each of them a beginner's pipe of sort (below $10 ea.)
and some tobacco.  Judging from the way they carry themselves (and their
pipes), I guess other grad students will come to be before long.
The prudent thing for me to do, I gather, is to make available free
order lists of companies like LePeltier, Levin...instead of free pipes.

Speaking of LePeltier, I have to add one more note.  I mail-ordered
clay pipes from him for a couple of times and found out that we have
a mutual friend here in Taiwan.  The world is quite small after all.

Fianlly, do you have any idea about the ingrediants of the sweeterners?
It is fairly difficult and therefore expensive to get sweeterners here.
I wonder if it is just a pipe dream to get a chemical supplies store
to put up a bottle of homemade sweeterner?


                                          Sean
                                          5/11/91

[ Thanks for the update, Sean! I believe sweeteners mostly have an
alcohol base, but don't know what else they put into them.  A little
150-proof rum might work quite well. :-) -S. ]

Subject: trip to NewMexico

Hello,
since I am on the list for about one year and just booked my 1st
trip to leave europe heading for NewMexico in June, it might be 
interesting to ask some questions:

  Does anyone know about interesting sites for  "pipe smokers"
  in or around NewMexico ?
  I will have a car for 1 week of spare time time from Albuquerque.

  Of course I would like to get a useful souvenir.
  I am thinking of a pipe from the local Indians: 
  Do they have any pipe tradition ?
  Of course I would like to have a fully useable pipe, not just
  a tourist's dummy.
  What do I have to pay attention to when buying a pipe or tobaco ?
  Is it maybe dangerous for an average european organism to use
  a certain tobaco or else products in NewMexico ?
  also with respect to the climate.

  What is the climate in NewMexico of June ?

  I need some US american vocabulary concerning pipes.
  "pipe smoker", f.i. is literally from german.
  Meanwhile I know about the different use of 'pipe'.
  Perhaps s.o. could tell me a few expressions by describing 
  a tobaco pipe in its parts, and the words one needs when talking
  about pipe smoking. F.i. what do you call the 'white fog' produced
  when smoking: fog, smoke, smog, steam or .... ?

Finnally some personal data, so you know who is asking:
In December I graduated in Radio-astrophysics in Bonn, FRG.
In January I was 27 yrs.
Since March I study/work for a Ph.D. in Radio-Astronomy, what will
last some 3 years.
Last month I bought a handmade pipe (after a Stanwell model) from my 
local dealer, with respect to my graduation. (A very common way to
justify a new pipe if considering the mail to this list :-)
Now I am looking forward to check Columbus' hypothesis about
disks and balls in space (never been out of europe).
And I like this $15.- tobacos (per 50gr.) which I cant afford  :(

Best wishes from Bonn, FRG

Martin

[ Wow, that's a lot of questions, Martin! I'll answer a few: (a) yes,
there are several Indian pipe ceremonies (don't know much about them);
(b) whether you like them :-); (c) depends on whether it's the variety
known as "Mexican laughing tobacco", which can cause serious
incarceration :-) :-) ; (d) if the European organism wants to use the
climate to cure a case of dry skin, forget it :-) :-) :-) (e) hot, I'd
think, but I've never been there; (f) how about: bowl, shank, stem,
bit, ferrule, tenon, keel, mainsail, yardarm :-)^4 (f) "smoke" will do
in most cases - an exception is "fallout" for when you light yp a bowl
of Old Plutonium :-)^5. I'll rely on our other readers for more
serious answers, or funnier ones. -S. ]

Subject: Trip to Germany and Austria

Steve,

   Due to the short time between now and my trip (my fault, I kept postponing
such an important message...), I would appreciate if you could forward this
message to the group as soon as possible.

-----

Hello,

  I have a request for the group.  I will be going to South of Germany, more
precisely a town called Germisch about one hour south of Munich, for a
conference, and then will be spending a few days in Vienna, by the end of this
week.  If any of you out there in Europe have any suggestions or pointers to
good pipe shops in the area, I would appreciate to learn about it.  Sorry for
the short notice, but things have been pretty hectic at my work.

  Hope to hear from you guys in Europe.  I just read the message from Martin in
Bonn, Germany.

   Anyway, I will report any pipe exciting adventure in Europe to the group.

- Elias

[ I was out of town on vacation, but here it is! Sorry, I can't help
you out myself, but perhaps some of our European members could. Were
it Denmark, I'd send you to Larsen's in Copenhagen. -S. ]

Subject: A&amp;M Gazette, DC pipe show

I've wanted for some time to pass on word of the Agricultural and
Mechanical Gazette, published by Neil Murray (47758 Hickory, Apt.
22305, Wixom, MI 43893 - a bit heavy on the 5-digit numbers, I'll
admit! :-) Neil gave us a mention in his April '91 issue - perhaps
some of our new subscribers found out about the group through this
tome! For only a few dollars a year, this enjoyable bimonthly pub
(possibly the most frequent in pipedom) offers a good list of pipe
club activities, shows and swap meets, and their unique "Dirigible
Pirates" serial, which is better read than described! Send Neil a
letter for all the facts.

Also, in the Spring 1991 issue of the Compleat Smoker, we learn of the
Pipe Collectors' International Convention and Pipe Show at the Crystal
Gateway Marriott, Arlington, VA. The show goes on from May 24-26.
Would go if I could, but my car has other plans - something to do with
its brakes :-( Hope this isn't too late to let some of you know!

Just returned from a trip to California, and was astonished by the
level of smoker-bashing there. The restaurants and hotels that permit
smoking are apparently required by law to display a fairly obnoxious
sign to the effect that if you patronize the place, you'll succumb
immediately to the effects of the evil weed. Personally, I'm no great
supporter of smoking in restaurants, but those bits of state-enforced
propaganda made me appreciate the relative freedom of NJ a little more
(than seemed possible :-) Wherever you are, I hope you'll continue to

			Smoke in peace,

Subject: Re:  Pipes Digest #57 - May 24, 1991

To Elias
sorry to use this way but Elias' path looked somewhat strange to me.

In 1986 I was in Augsburg (west of Munich) for a day and decided to
buy me a second pipe. Since my 1st pipe was a present, I never had 
seriously spent time in a pipe shop before. I found s.th. what occured
to me as a pipe store and up to now its still the biggest pipe shop
I have seen. There I got an introduction on pipes which lasted about
 one hour. The only other thing I remember from this shop:
 this introduction was given by a woman. (Before that I never saw a
 woman 'handling' a pipe and since I remember only one more; WHY IS
 this so ?)
As far as I remember from this day the shop was near the eastern
end of the inner cities foot-passengers zone. There are two main
lanes of shops with some places inbetween. The lanes going east-west
but slightly bowed to the south. I recall the shop at the southern
bow about 100 meters from the eastern end.

Err, hope you dont get lost with this description.
And (since it was my 1st and therefor impressive visit of a pipe shop)
you might only find a small kiosk  :)
In the end I came out of the shop with my 2nd pipe:
  Stanwell No. 11 ,  black and 'sand beamed'
It's still my favoured one.

However, I wish you a nice stay in  Garmisch 
				     ^
and there is still  'my' shop in Bonn; AVOID any shop in the foot passenger
zone here ! But as I see you are not passing here. 

regards
Martin

[ Martin, I'm having trouble getting through to Elias too. Neither his
old address (?????@?????.???.???.???) nor his new one
(????????????@??????.??????.???) works; mail to postmaster at the new
address bounces too. Any ideas, anybody? -S. ]

Steve,

When were you in CA?  And you didn't even call :-&lt;  You are very right about
the anti-smoking atmosphere here.  We have a larger portion of yuppies here
and most of them expect to live forever so anything that reduces that goal
is a threat and is treated most harshly.  Oh well,  live and let live.  It
is kind of funny that most of them jog, and jogging in this smog filled
area for 20 min. is equivalent of 2 pack of cigarretes.  Go figure, for sure.

Take care,

Norm

agent and we'll do lunch :-) -S. ]

Subject: From Cigarettes to Pipes


It's nice to see the pipes group going so well.  I have a question regarding
the new member Tim and his plan to change one smoking medium for another.  I
understood that smoking a pipe was healthier than cigarettes because pipe 
smokers rarely inhaled the smoke.  It normally just drifts in the mouth.  But
cigarette smokers who convert to pipes face even greater risk because they
continue to inhale and recieve a condensed version of the smoke and more of
it.  Can anybody set me straight?

&gt; the tabaconist's.  What is a good starter pipe?
&gt; What is a good blend?  What sort of price range
&gt; should I pay, both for pipe and tobacco?

Well, there are different schools of pipe smoking.  The Highbrow School will
first inform you (politely, but pointedly) that the correct spelling is
"tobacconist's."  They will then, in their own scholarly way, proceed to
teach you about cognac, single-malt scotch, the steeplechase, and yachting,
until they eventually get around to suggesting a $75 briar and a proper
English tobacco blend.  The Lowbrow School will send you to the drug store
for a Doctor Grabow and a pouch of Cap'n Black.
 
Myself, I'd suggest you buy whatever pipe strikes your fancy.  You'll
probably want something in around the $30 price range, but that's
adjustable to your budget; you can get pipes with small cosmetic blemishes
for even less, and they're often excellent smokers.  I'd opine that a
simple shape would be a good starter; perhaps a straight-shanked,
rounded-bowl (the classic "dad" pipe, ala' the Appleton's or J.R. "Bob"
Dodds.)  But if a deep curve really fires your spirit, then go for it!

A few simple things to look for:

  - Wall thickness.  You want a uniform thickness, and the thicker the
better.  If it's too thin, the smoke will be hot; local thin places (for
instance, on a square-carved bowl) will become "hot spots," bad for the
pipe and often uncomfortable.  If the wall thickness tapers down toward the
top, that's OK.  Also check the bottom; stick a finger all the way in the
bowl, and gage the thickness with your thumb under the bowl.  You may not
be able to judge this well from day one, but you'll pick it up with
practice; look at some of the more expensive pipes for a "standard."

  - Hole drill.  Make sure the shank hole has been drilled properly.
If it meets the bowl more than about a 16th of an inch above the bottom,
it will be difficult to smoke the pipe all the way down; and therefore,
hard to build up the important heel cake.

  - Stem fit.  Make sure the stem isn't too tight to remove, or so loose
that it slips out easily.  

  - Blemishes.  I advise you don't worry about them.  Their effect on taste
is minor, if any, and your "walking-around" pipe is going to take some
abuse, anyway.  Someday you may want a beautiful "dress" pipe for those
formal occasions (the rare ones that still allow smoking).

  - Grain.  Another one not to worry about.  I've heard people argue
"straight grain conducts heat better", while others say, "curly grain means
dense wood and a cooler smoke."  My favorite pipes have either style, so
I'm a skeptic on the importance of grain.  I can vouch that you can get a
great smoke with either sort.

  - Stem material.  I'm a chewer; rubber stems last me about 3 days of
smoking before they're ruined, so the harder Lucite stems are a must.
Lucito is also more expensive, and can be hard to find on inexpensive
pipes.  You might use this as a tie-breaker.

  - Buy a corncob.  By all means, spend the money on a briar; but toss in
an extra three bucks for a Missouri Meerschaum corncob pipe.  Sure, you'll
look like a hick, but it might just smoke better than your briar.  It'll
also give you something to smoke on off days (you should let a briar rest
for a day after a day's smoking).  Cobs also make great outdoors pipes...
"Dang, my pipe fell out of my mouth and under the lawn mower!  Honey,
throw me another corncob and a match, will you ?" 


Tobacco.  Get one ounce of whatever 3-5 tobaccos smell good to you.  They
won't taste like they smell, but there's a correlation.  English blends,
for example, have an aroma that makes me think of hand-carved hardwood and
fine leather; sure enough, they taste like sawdust and burnt horse.  8-)
Seriously, though... get an ounce of whatever looks interesting.  Then
smoke the whole ounce (or as much of it as you can stand) before switching
to another blend.  The cake in a pipe takes on the flavor of the tobacco,
and it takes at least half an ounce to get the cake settled in so you get
the true flavor.  There's another advantage to having a corncob for your
second pipe - you can be trying a different blend in each pipe.

Also, be sure and ask your wife how she likes each blend; she can enjoy
your pipe almost as much as you do if you account for this, and I've been
surprised at how two blends with similar tastes can have markedly different
smells.  Also be aware that what you smell when you smoke is very different
than how others smell it.  For proof, after smoking for a while, leave the
room (and the pipe) and get some fresh air.  Come back a few minutes later
and take a whiff.

Finally, don't be afraid to tell the tobacconist you're new.  He can
provide lots of other tips on loading, tamping, lighting, etc.

And enjoy!

re: tim's note
I started with a corncob and just got what ever a good cheap blend was (b
bascially just ask for a good mild cheap one) and found after tring 3 or 4 b
blends that I enjoyed them all (except maybe mild burley).  As far price goes
I got 2 oz. of tobaco and all the riggings for the pipe and the pipe it self
for around $10.  I whould suggest that you start with something cheap so you
don't have to worry about losing or damaging it also to see if you like it.

Subject: Welcomes, tips and pipes...

Hello everybody,

I am happy to see that the group continues to grow.  Let's hope that
we will keep adding fellow pipe smokers from all over the world and
continue to exchange information, or simply chat about pipes.  Steve,
I think it might be a good idea if you have some free time between a
Cavendish and a Balkan Sobraine, to put together a list of all the
members of the group with a brief description such as State, city,
country, etc.  And maybe in the near future we may even begin to talk
about a possible Pipe Mailgroup meeting ?? (thoughts??).

Well, again welcome to the new members.

Tim, I think it is a great idea to give up cigaretes (arghhhh!!!!) and
join the civilized world of relaxed pipe smokers.  I did it myself
about 12 years ago and definetely do not regret.  The first steps may
a little ardous.  It takes some time to fully enjoy a pipe, which I
think is very positive.  You learn how to better smoke your pipe(s)
and you grow with accostumed to them.  The first recomendation I have
for you is to buy the book from Steve Hacker "The Ultimate Book of
Pipes" - Steve if the title is wrong, please correct me. I don't have
the book with me and it is 5:30 pm :-).  It is a great book about
pipes and very fun to read.  It gives a lot of general info for the
beginner.  Steve, could you send Tim the address where to order the
book?  If you want to buy a pipe to smoke while you read it, here goes
some general tips:

- Buy a pipe in the unexpensive range, but not from drugstores.  Ask the person
at a good pipe shop to show some pipes.  Never rush to buy a pipe; take your
time.

- Buy a smooth tobacco. Some aromatic cavendish. English tobaccos are heavy for
the beginner, although after a while those will be the only ones you want to
smoke (OK - I know this is MY VERY OWN opinion :-) just kidding. I like
aromatics every once in a while )

- Buy a pipe companion (a small instrument to push the tobacco down the bowl as
you smoke it)

- Buy pipe cleaners

- Fill the bowl sparingly the first 3 to 4 times, increasing the amount on the
next smoke.  Do not pack the tobacco tight the first time. You have to be able
to smoke it smoothly. If you make any effort to puff, it is no good. Do it
again.

- You should not spend more than $20 in this first visit, although you
can spend a lot more if you want.

- Do not over do it.  Smoking pipe is a pleasure not a habit.

- Have fun

 Let us know about your first experiences with a pipe. Do not give up.
With little time you will be enjoying a pipe and have a great time
just like the rest of us :-)


Martin, thanks for your info about pipe shops in Munich, but
unfortunately I only received your mail after my return.  Anyway I
only spent one day in Munich and didn't have much time there.  I saw a
few pipe shops in Vienna but they were way overpriced, so I decided to
hold on for now.

[ Good to hear back from you, Elias! I like the idea of an address
list, and of a possible meeting. However, I don't have everyone's
physical address. How about this: if the members send me mail with
this info, I'll put them on the list? More on this later. -S. ]

Hi all,
I just returned from NewMexico to Bonn (180 ft MSL), and after living
one week around 4500ft and the second around 7000 ft  I verbally feel
depressed now.
The second week I explored the northwest of NM and southwest of Colorado
(abbrev. ?). By the stereotypes of nomade indians living in tents, I was 
all but prepared to see the pueblo-cities build 1000 yrs ago in that area.
By all these impressions I totally forgot about my pipes (also due to the thin
air) and about my plans to look for indian pipes.
Now I wait for the slides being developed to see where I was :-)

Subject: First pipe (corncob), smell vs. taste, Smoke-Con

 I second the advice on corncob pipes.  Being proud of my working class 
background even though a graduate of an Elite Eastern School(tm) I generally 
try not to look too hoity-toity, which a young man with a briar pipe does.  
Most people are reminded of Gen. MacArthur when they see me smoking a corncob,
but it tastes fine, is much less expensive, and I don't mind knocking one
around.
 It is indeed unfortunate that smoke in the mouth doesn't taste the same 
as smoke in the air (if it did, I'd smoke Marlboro.)  
 I disagree that one need smoke many bowls to learn taste.  For a first
pass, and for an uneducated palate, a single bowl can teach a lot,
especially when trying grossly different flavors.  My tobacconist
was happy to let me take a sample bowl out of the jar.
 
 For my $0.02, my taste has run towards blends called "Mango Cavendish",
or pure Turkish.  The commercial blends (Cap'n Black, Sail) have always
been either too weak-tasting, or have an unpleasant bite.  Cherry flavors
smell sweet, but taste like Life Savers.

 There has been an unfortunate anti-pipe trend in the press lately:
A medical study showed increased mouth cancer for pipes and smokeless
tobacco (I guess we knew this), Dear Abby said it gives bad breath, and
just yesterday Ann Landers had a letter from about a habitual pipe smoker
who denies he is addicted.  She said he's fooling only himself.
 
 I'm always interested in mailing list meetings.  I live in Woburn, Mass,
10 miles north of Boston.  First choice would be to descend on Leavitt
and Pierce in Cambridge, or David P. Erhlich in Boston.  Second choice, 
and probably more central (especially since Our Moderator is in New Jersey) 
would be the Georgopolu factory in lower Manhattan.  Last time I was there 
(about 7 years ago) it was a small, five story building, complete with old 
cigarette rolling machines, headquarters for this three-generation family
importing business, tucked away behind Chase Manhattan Plaza in the financial 
district.

Subject: PIPE ML

Thanks for the suggestions about starting pipesmoking.
I resisted the temptation to rush out to Walgreens or House o'Pipes.
While on vacation in the Adirondacs, I rediscovered a shop in Lake Placid 
I first visited on my honeymoon, "With Pipe and Book".  It is, appropriately
enough, a combination tobacconist and high-quality used book store.  There was 
walk-in humidor for cigars and 22 blends of pipe tobacco on the shelf.

Breck Turner, the proprietor, was kind enough to show me the basics,
set me up with a bent stem and curved lucite briar pipe and a couple ounces
of his store's Cavendish blend.  He took the time to discuss the difference
between aromatic and english; Latakia, Burley and Cavendish; which drugstore
plastic pouch brands are best in an emergency ("Hardly matters; they'll all
be stale anyway."); tamping and relighting.  All this, singlehanded, on the 
Fourth of July weekend in a tourist town.  

They had twenty $30 natural briar pipes to choose from, as well as some gnarly
pipes, Meerschaums, novelty, Rip van Winkle clay pipes.  They do mail-order.
Here comes the plug:

 With Pipe and Book
Breck and Julia Turner, prop.
91 Main Street
Lake Placid, NY  12946

I left with a good pipe, five ounces of Cavendish blend and a copy
of "The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism" by
George Bernard Shaw.

Subject: Pipe Con

 Haven't seen a pipe digest in a few weeks (#61, 7/18).  Anyway, if there 
is further discussion of the PipeCon, I'll be out of work and idle from 
August 12 until August 23 (this has only one weekend, Aug 17-18) and I'll 
be in Chicago and San Francisco Aug 24 - Sept 5, so I could come to the 
greater NY area for a PipeCon Aug 17-18 (or mid-week), or Sept 7-8.

  - David Chesler (??????@?????.???)

[ Would others be interested in a get-together in the NY area at
either of those times? Mail me if so. -S. ]

Subject: Agriculture, Mechanics, and the Dirigible Pirates

Well, the story goes like this. Norm Carpenter was in NYC on business
for a couple of days, so I met him for dinner and a pipe at La Bonne
Soupe. (It wasn't the night the NY Pipe Club meets, so we had to do
the smoking outside of the restaurant, along with a little
exploration.) For some reason or another, I mentioned a slightly
strange-of-center bimonthly pipe lore magazine called "The
Agricultural and Mechanical Gazette", in which the Internet Pipes
Mailgroup has been listed for the last two issues. It's edited by Neil
Murray, and well worth the price of $15/year for club and convention
news, as well as the, er, "different" Dirigible Pirates stories.

Norm asked me, quite reasonably, why a pipe journal would have a name
like "The Agricultural and Mechanical Gazette." Rather than
paraphrase, I'll repeat the whole story, from Vol. 2 Issue 4, December
1990, p. 2.

"Many of our readers have written in asking questions. Questions such
as, "Where is the 'Great North Woods?', 'Who are these Dirigible
Pirates?', and 'What does it all really mean?'

"Various explanations have been offered from time to time, both by the
informed and also by the uninformed. At long last, this is an attempt
to set the record straight. Consider it a sort of Christmas present,
from us, to you.

"The story of the Dirigible Pirates, which has been accepted by most
people as a work of fiction, is in fact an historical account of
future events. That is to say, when the future becomes the past, and
the present becomes irrelevant, the story of our Pirates will become
an accepted part of our cultural and historical baggage. Suffice it to
say that when the Clean Air Police grab our society by the throat,
wrenching our pipes from between our clenched teeth, a few brave men
and women will take refuge in a place which will become known as, 'The
Great North Woods.' Anticipating their (the Pirates') need for a camp
newsletter, _The Agricultural and Mechanical Literary Gazette_ was
founded -- well in advance of their actual need! (The word 'Literary'
was eventually dropped from the title for reasons which are no longer
of interest - and we can't remember anyway.) As the title implies, the
objective of the _Gazette_ is to inform and entertain the readers
since anything of interest to a Dirigible Pirate - being folks of
simple needs - can be categorized as either agricultural or
mechanical. We initially envisioned that the _Gazette_ would be packed
with informative articles about pipes, tobaccos, the social news of
our cohort, the historical chronicle of the pirates, the husbandry of
small cereal grains and their conversion through fermentation into a
more transportable form, horticulture, the repairs of old pipe
friends, practical machine tools and material sciences. Much of this
has been accomplished and much remains ahead of us.

"And, finally, what does it all mean? We don't know. If we did, maybe
we would be writing for the _Harvard Business Review_ instead."

[ Editor's note: So how does the dang dirigible come into this? ]

In any case, Neil asks me to drop him a note about how the mailgroup
is going, and promises to include it in the next issue. Here's how I'd
describe it.

"Our membership is now over forty (in number, not age :-), and
includes folks from four continents. Unless I'm mistaken, all our
members are of the male persuasion, though women would by no means be
discouraged from joining in, except by the social bias currently
prevailing about who should be permitted to smoke a pipe. We seem to
average about one mailing every three or four weeks; they go out
whenever someone has something to contribute. There are, I am certain,
a few dyed-in-the-wool collectors in our ranks, though most of us are
just ordinary aficionados.

"I started the group two years ago when I heard of the efforts of
Elias Mazur to found a pipe newsgroup. A newsgroup is a different
beast than a mailgroup is. Anyone can read a newsgroup, and a vote
must be taken to create one. Elias called for the vote to found the
newsgroup, but was soundly shouted down by the antismokers on the net,
who are legion. (See my comments on 'flaming' below.) Hearing of this
only by chance, I contacted Elias and founded the mailgroup. Sixty-two
mailings later, we are still here, tapping and puffing happily away.

"One of the more heartening things I see happens when a new member
asks advice on how to become a pipe smoker. The old hands rally to aid
the neophyte, who, if lucky, may even make sense of all the
conflicting approaches suggested ('Buy a corncob!' 'Buy a Dunhill
ODA!' 'Use a lighter!' 'Use kitchen matches!' 'Use flint and steel!')
Some members use the mailgroup to ask about the origin of a peculiar
pipe they own, and some have gotten suggestions for pipe maintenance,
shops in cities to which they'll be traveling, etc. In this way, we
fill a niche that the pipe clubs and conventions miss.

"One thing I should explain is the term 'flaming,' which, in the world
of computer networks, means invective or insult. To avoid this, I
restrict the circulation of the mailgroup to its members only (though
anyone can become a member), and edit out flames. To date, I have not
received even one; we use flames only to light up.  :-)

"In short, we're healthy, reasonably active, and always looking for
new friends and things of tobacconicular interest. If you have access
to the Internet, please drop us a line!

"P.S. Netters use typography for their own purposes. The symbol :-) is
called a 'smiley'; turn it sideways and you'll see why. We've also
developed the symbol ~\U to represent a pipe."

If anyone has anything to add, subtract, or differentiate here, please
let me know and I'll pass the result along to Neil. I'd especially
like to know if anyone heard of the mailgroup either through the
_Gazette_ or _The Pipe Smokers' Ephemeris_.  For those of you
interested in The Agricultural and Mechanical Gazette, the address is:

	The Agricultural and Mechanical Gazette
	c/o Neil Murray
	47758 Hickory, Apt. 22305
	Wixom, MI 48393

And finally, I'll light up my old "Beehive" pot shape, the one with
the slight bend that sits on my desk imploring me to smoke it some
more, and wish you,

			Smoke in peace,
			~\U Steve.

Subject: A Greeting To All


Greetings to all my fellow pipe smokers!

I am Robert Whitehead (most call me Bob), and I am a technical
writer for Intergraph, the largest computer-aided design firm in the
United States.

I started smoking a pipe when I was a freshman at Samford University
in Birmingham, Alabama.  This was back around 1978 or so, and being
young and stupid, I picked up a Dr. Grabow and some Borkum Riff Rum
that had been sitting on the shelf at KMart for about eight months. 
Needless to say, I failed to be terribly impressed.

At the time, I was working at an ice cream store in the nearby mall.
One night, after I had just gotten off work (and gotten paid), I
wandered into The Tinder Box and met Skip Elliott, the proprietor's
son and assistant manager.  I struck up a converstion and admitted
that I was not impressed with pipes, having had such a poor
experience with the Grabow &amp; Riff combination.

Skip, a graduate of the Tinder Box training course, offered to set
me straight.  He explained all about the origin of pipes and pipe
smoking (having some impressive texts to help), demonstrated the
proper method to pack and light a pipe, and offered to sell me an
inexpensive meerschaum-lined briar pipe and some good rum-flavored
tobacco.

The rest is, as they say, pipe history.

I've had my little briar for about thirteen years now; it keeps
company with three other lined briars, a straight Danish briar, a
small meerschaum, a meerschaum-capped Calabash, and my latest
acquisition:  a straight-stemmed, detachable German Schwarzvalder
(Black Forest) pipe that I brough home with me from Wiesbaden just
two weeks ago.

I prefer rum tobaccos (as that is my favorit spirit), but I am also
fond of the Trade Winds / Black Satin / Captain Black genre with
vanilla.  I also fondly remember The Tinder Box blend called V.S.O.P
(with cognac).

My first question:  has anyone dealt with Carey's Smokeshop?  I
recently received their catalog in the mail, and I'm interested in
trying the Grandma's Apple Pie blend.  If it smells and tastes as
good as its namesake, I'll be a fan for life; if it isn't, I'll be
sorely disappointed.

In my next missive:  How I converted my roommate in college from a
cigarette chain-smoker to a pipe smoker.

All the Best!

Subject: Has anybody seen John Cotton's #1 or #1&amp;2 ?

Greetings, fellow puffers.

I have a question about a brand of tobacco that I greatly enjoyed 
years ago: John Cotton's.  I used to be about to find Cotton's #1
(a mild English) and #1&amp;2 Medium (a medium English) in smokeshops
everywhere, but I haven't seen it in years.  Does anyone know of
a store that still carries this stuff?  Or has it gone out of
production?  

It's one of my all-time favorites.  The #1 was an especially delightful 
after-breakfast tobacco.

Subject: The Conversion Factor

The Conversion Factor
(or How I Got My Roommate To Give Up Cigarettes)

During my freshman year of college, I moved into the dorm with a
cigarette chainsmoker named Carl Michael Allen.  (Only guy with
three first names I ever met!)

Carl could never understand why I smoked a pipe.  "Why bother?" he'd
ask.  "Look at all the trouble you have to go through for a smoke. 
You gotta have the pipe; you gotta have matches; you gotta have a
pipe nail, a dottle pick, a pipe rag, a tobacco pouch, and so forth.
I can have a smoke any time I want, and all I need is a lighter. 
Besides, if you run out of tobacco, you have to wait for the tobacco
shop to open; I can go to the streetcorner and drop $1.25 into the
cigarette machine for my favorite brand!"

Of course, I rallied my defenses quickly.  "Sure, Carl, smoking a
pipe is a little more trouble, but I think it's worth it.  In the
first place, not everyone can stand the smell of cigarette smoke. 
That's because cigarettes contain stale, dry tobacco that's been
impregnated with phosphorous to keep it burning.  You set a lit
cigarette down in an ashtray, it burns itself to the end of the
filter; that's tantamount to a tear gas grenade.  But how many times
have you heard someone say, 'I love the smell of a pipe; it's so
much nicer than cigarettes'?

"Another good thing about pipes:  as you smoke a pipe, it gets
better and better as it breaks in.  There's no challenge to smoking
cigarettes, and it takes no skill at all to light up.  Pipes make
you work for the burn, but the rewards are worth ten times the
effort.

"Pipe tobacco (that you get fresh from the tobacconists, not the
smunge you get at KMart) is pure, except for the flavorings that are
put in some blends.  Even the flavors are pure:  vanilla, rum,
cognac, cherry, apple, and so forth.  Since the tobacco is pure, it
won't sustain a burn:  you have to keep smoking a pipe, or it'll go
out.  Saves on tobacco if it doesn't keep burning."

Soon, Carl began to see the light.  I even loaded my favorite pipe
with my favorite blend and let him smoke it.  With his first puff,
he was sold; he'd never had such a smooth smoke from a Marlboro!

To complete the conversion, I splurged and bought him a coachman's
pipe with the extra stem lengthener, a pipe nail, and two ounces of
The Tinder Box's V.S.O.P. blend.  I showed him how to break in the
briar, how to pack, how to light, all the time knowing how my Dad
must have felt when he taught me how to shoot.  I felt part of
Tradition.

Soon, Carl and his pipe were inseperable.  I'd come back to the room
between classes and find him stretched out on his bed, his pipe bowl
nestled on his chest, his eyes closed and a look of sheer angelic
bliss plastered on his puss.  Occasionally, he'd open one eye and
cuss me, tongue firmly in cheek, for getting him started on pipes.

"I can't get through the day without coming back to the room, lying
down, and smoking this damned thing!" he wailed.  "Beats driving
everyone else out of the room with those coffin nails you *used* to
smoke," I retorted.  "You got that right," Carl finally admitted.

Christmas rolled around.  Carl had cast longing looks at my
meerschaum-capped Calabash pipe I had bought and with which I had
fallen in love, so before he left for his hometown of Drasco,
Arkansas, I purchased an identical pipe for him.  Needless to say,
Carl was stunned when he unwrapped the pipe and pouch of Aalborg
tobacco he'd found on his desk.

I guess you could say my roommate and I were good friends from then
on.

Time passed; Carl completed his studies and was graduated from
Samford as a summa cum laude Accounting student.  I left Samford and
went on to Auburn to carry on the tradition, then went to Air Force
Basic Training in April of 1980.

I haven't heard from Carl Michael Allen since 1979; I understand he
is a bank accountant in Little Rock, Arkansas.  If anyone on the
list is from the Little Rock area, and perhaps know of Carl's
whereabouts, please pass along my regards.

And, in the words of our esteemed moderator,

Smoke in peace!

Subject: Renting &amp; puffing

From time to time, I scan the ``Rentals to Share'' ads in the
newspapers, and see a lot of ads for nonsmokers only. Now, I have
nothing against those folks, but I'd certainly appreciate knowing when
I was welcome in a place, as well as when I was unwelcome (as one
poster ad made clear with the suffix, "This means YOU, butthead!" How
bigoted! How unkind!)

Therefore, I'd like you to think about the following. If you have an
apartment for rent, or to share, why not advertise it as ``Pipe smoker
welcome'' ? What could be frendlier, and more in keeping with the
spirit of camraderie among pipe people?

And, after your tenant moves in, you will be secure in the knowledge
that he or she will be quiet, clean, and timely with the rent payments
(as all pipe smokers are :-) Knowing this, you can relax and

						Smoke in peace,
						~\U Steve.

Subject: Stem repair from the Golden State

I had the fortunate experience to be within a hundred miles of our
dedicated moderator Steve recently when I was called to NY City rather
briskly on business.  With a suit bag in hand,  ready for the drive to
the airport, I decided to sit down at the system and drop a quick email
note for Steve letting him know that I was going to be on the East
Coast.  I suggested a possible meeting, signed off, and headed East.

Later,  when I had been working at the trouble spot for a day,  I
arrived at my hotel room to find a message from Steve.  I quickly
called him and we agreed to meet for dinner the next day.  Elias was
supposed to join us but he had a prior obligation somewhere else.

During our discussion at dinner the topic of loose stems came up.  I
had told Steve that the tobacco shop owner where I first bought my pipe
had taught me a quick fix for a loose stem.  Steve suggested that I
send this out over the mailgroup.  Not a bad suggestion, so here it
is...

I have a problem of having the stems on my pipe becomming loose over
time.  I think this happens because I get a lot of moisture in my
pipe.  (No, I don't remove the stem while the pipe is hot!)  Anyhow,
when I was a beginner I took my first pipe back to the shop and showed
the guy my problem.  I expected a repair job, but he smiled at me and
said, "I'll show you this once, after that you're on your own."

For those of you who don't know or don't care about the names of pipe parts,
here is a picture:  (please disregard the lousy Ansii art)

                                  _____________
                    _________    /   _________/
                   (         )  /   /     ^------------Stem
                   (         ) /\  /         _____          _______
    Bowl --------&gt; (         )/  \/         {     |        |       }
                    (        /   /          { -----      ---       }
                     (__________/ ^         { ----- &lt;    ---       }
                                  |         {_____| |   ^  |_______}  
                                  |                 |   |
                      Shank ------+      Mortise ---+   +--- Tenon

He took my pipe and removed the stem.  He grabbed the thickest pipe cleaner
he had and inserted it into the mouth end of the pipe until it just appeared
at the other end.  Then he lit a match and held it under the stem for a few
seconds (maybe five or so).  The flame never touched the tenon on the stem,
but it did melt the rubber.  After this he quickly pushed the stem against the
counter being careful to hold the stem so that the tenon was as perpendicular
to the counter as possible.  This caused the tenon to bulge a little.

After waiting a few minutes to allow the stem to cool, he grabbed a piece of
sandpaper and started to bring the tenon back down to a size that would fit
the mortise.  When he got close he kept testing the tenon by inserting it
into the mortise.  He cautioned "Never try to force the tenon in,  let it
fit snug, but easy to insert.  Otherwise you'll only end up with a cracked
shank."  (I didn't listen very well because after a year I did crack the
shank on one of my favorite pipes,  but it was repairable with a metel band.)

Once he got the tenon to fit snug, he removed it from the shank and rubbed 
the entire tenon surface with a pencil.  This provided a lubricant (graphite)
and allowed the snug tenon/mortise to fit together nicely.  His last comment
was,  "This 'quick fix' is good for about three times,  after that you are
going to need a new stem."

I would'nt try this method for the first time on your most favorite pipe, but
it does beat sending them in to get repaired.

Re: Article reprint from Utne Reader

For those who don't know of it, "The Utne Reader" is sort of a liberal
(or progressive, if you're afraid to use The L Word) version of
"Reader's Digest". I'll post the following short article, which
appeared under the "Civil Liberties" section of the May issue, without
further comment.

		Is The Anti-Smoking Movement Elitist?

In the last few years, as the evidence has mounted on the dangers of
smoking and passive smoke, it has begun to seem that even smokers
themselves were against the nasty habit. (For a particularly agonized
smoker's apologia, see "The Sun" [Feb. 1991].)

But now a new smokers' champion has appeared in (where else?) the
libertarian journal "Reason" (Feb. 1991). While not denying the health
dangers of smoking, author Jacob Sullum suggests that the anti-smoking
movement is "profoundly paternalistic. It does not trust people to
make their own choices about smoking - neither whether to do it nor
whether to tolerate it."

By banning cigarette advertising under the guise of calling it
commercial speech, we are compromising all freedom of speech, he
argues, since with enough effort we could classify almost anything as
commercial speech. Also, Sullum points out, it smacks of elitism for
certain groups (i.e., smug, educated, white upper-middle-class types)
to object to the cigarette niche marketing aimed at other, supposedly
more vulnerable groups such as young working-class women and blacks.
By doing so, Sullum argues, one group is essentially proclaiming
itself as superior to other groups that it has deemed incapable -
unlike itself - of standing up to advertising pitches.

Finally, and perhaps most controversially, he questions the supposed
irrefutable dangers of passive smoking, pointing out that most studies
on secondary smoke (and there have been relatively few) relate to
long-term exposure in the home, yet these studies are used to justify
jaws banning smoking in public places and businesses.

Don't know about you, but it kind of makes me want to vote Libertarian
next time :-) Perhaps, unlike the Republicrats, they have some
interest in letting us,

					Smoke in peace,

Subject: Aromatic vs. What?

Greetings, fellow pipe-o-philes (or whatever we're called);

Ever since I started smoking a pipe (circa 1978), I've never
understood aromatics.

The way I've always thought of it, an aromatic is a tobacco that
smells great (lit or unlit), but doesn't have much taste.  To my way
of thinking, that's sort of a social tobacco; something you can
smoke at a party and not worry about choking everyone out of the
room.

Well, if that's the case, what do you call a blend that tastes
great, but maybe doesn't have much in the aroma department?

I ask this because I just got my new Carey's Smokeshop catalog, and
I'm dying to try some of the flavored blends, but some of the
aromatics sound great, too.  Does anyone out there buy from Carey's?

While I'm on the subject, does anyone smoke an Aerosphere pipe?  How
do you like it?

Subject: Aerospheres (was Aromatic vs. What?)

&gt;&gt; While I'm on the subject, does anyone smoke an Aerosphere pipe?  How
&gt;&gt; do you like it?

&gt; [ Aerosphere? Never heard of it... tell us more! I'm sure we'd like
&gt; the address for Carey's, too. -S. ]

Well, an Aerosphere pipe has a small brass dingus with a hole in it
on the side of the stem.  It is supposed to draw a metered amount of
air into the stem each time you draw on the pipe.  This is supposed
to cool down the smoke and help the tar and nicotine precipitate
out.

Once you finish the pipe, the hole allows the precipitated tar,
nicotine, and other fluids to evaporate out.

The prices for Aerosphere pipes seem reasonable enough; I just
wondered if anyone out there had tried one.

About Carey's Smokeshop:  they stock a good variety of blends,
pipes, cigars, pipe tool and accessories.  They also have a tobacco
club, which gives you all sorts of discounts and first chances at
sales events.  If you smoke at least three pounds per year, it is a
good deal.

Subject: Mixing pipes and cigars

Greetings, fellow pipesmokers;

Back 'way long years ago, when I was in my Senior year of college, I
had a professor who did something I've never seen done before or
since with a pipe:

He smoked a cigar in it!

He'd take his cigar and light it, then put it butt-first into his
pipe and smoke it.

I can only surmise that he smoked nothing _but_ cigars in this pipe.
I can imagine what smoking a cigar in an already-broken-in pipe
might do to the flavor of the pipe; I'm sure it would destroy the
carbon cake.

Now, in addition to my pipes, I occasionally enjoy a good cigar.  I
often buy several cigars fresh, then store them in the freezer until
I'm ready to indulge.  Not long ago, I bought a high-bowled
Meerschaum-lined pipe with which I am not terribly pleased, and I
don't smoke it much.  Well, an idea has struck me:  I'm considering
trying what my old Prof did and smoking a cigar in this
less-than-satisfactory pipe, hoping that the Meerschaum lining will
temper the cigar smoke as it does my regular blend.

Has anyone else had any experience with this technique?  How did you
enjoy it?  If I start doing this regularly, should I use this pipe
for nothing else.

Subject: Re: Mixing pipes and cigars

Hello everyone,

Robert Whitehead writes:

&gt;Back 'way long years ago, when I was in my Senior year of college, I
&gt;had a professor who did something I've never seen done before or
&gt;since with a pipe:
&gt;
&gt;He smoked a cigar in it!

Before taking up a pipe, I would infrequently enjoy a cigar. I switched
to a pipe under the influence of a roomate who insisted that I would
enjoy it more. It was much like the scenario that Robert described in
digest #64. My only regret was that I waited so long. Even though I prefer
the pipe, every once and I while I still smoke a cigar.

I often toyed with the idea of trying a cigar in a pipe but my idea was
to first shread the tobacco from the cigar into something like pipe 
tobacco. I had never thought of just sticking the cigar directly into
the pipe. This seems like an interesting idea. Sort of like combining
both worlds. 

Expecting that the taste would be a little strange if using a pipe
which had already been broken in, at least until the cake had acclimated
itself. I found a pipe which I was not particularly fond of and being 
somewhat curious, tried it.

It worked quite well although looked somewhat strange. It would
probably be something you would not do in public but could enjoy in the
comfort of your own home. Next time, it would be possible to smoke the
cigar normally, and when it got a bit shorter insert it into the pipe.
This would be possible since it seemed to take longer to smoke the
cigar using the pipe. You could treat the cigar as a pre-packed pipe.
Overall, once getting past the cake acclimation period it was an
enjoyable experience. You would probably not want to use the pipe for
anything else since the cigar would be overpowering to any other pipe
blend.

I am wondering if anyone else has tried this and if so, what their 
reaction was.

Subject: Pre-packed pipes

John Kaczala writes, concerining my article about mixing pipes and cigars:

&gt; You could treat the cigar as a pre-packed pipe.

I have often wondered if tobacco processors had ever considered
compressing a measured amount into a cylinder, then vacuum-sealing
the pouches.  This would allow you to simply take a "plug" (for lack
of a better word), drop it in your bowl, then cut it up and re-tamp
it with your favorite pipe tool.

Here are some questions I would ask:

1. Does vacuum-sealing tobacco cause the moisture to boil out,
leaving the tobacco dry?

2. Would there be problems with determining a standard size for the
plugs?  (Sounds like we're smoking Zoysia sod, folks....;-)

3. Would you want each individual plug sealed like so:

Subject: Review of two great blends

Greetings, fellow pipe lovers;

Many of you may remember my postings about Carey's SmokeShop, and
the questions I have asked about the blends they carry.  Well,
recently I found a smokeshop in my hometown that carries the same
Danish blends that Carey's packages.  So, today I present a reivew
of two of them:  Cinnamon and Raisin, and Cocoa Creme.

Cinnamon and Raisin
===================

The first thing you notice about this blend is that the aroma of
cinnamon does not leap out of the pouch and assault your nasal
passages, nor is the raisin scent overpoweringly sweet.  In fact,
you'd probably have a hard time telling just _what_ in the Sam Hill
was in the blend in the first place.

Cinnamon and Raisin is a mildly aromatic blend; not thick and
cloying like some fruit-flavored tobaccos (most notably cherry
blends), C&amp;R tends to be somewhat sharp in its unlit state, but
quickly mellows when burning.  This blend is definitely for
those people who like to take their time with a pipe, for smoking it
too fast will result in a very unpleasant tongue bite.  It also
tends to burn a bit hotter than other similar blends.

Because of its propensity for hot burns, I recommend C&amp;R for a long
pipe, such as a meerschaum-capped Calabash or a Churchwarden's
long-stem.  Strangely enough, a short-stemmed corncob pipe also does
well; I think it must be the excellent heat-radiating properties of
the cob.  Clay pipe smokers should stay away from this one.

C&amp;R is very pleasant indoors.  Many people have asked me what blend
I was smoking and where they could get it.  Very good for after
dinner, especially with a brandy or some other restorative drink. 
Not good for straight rum drinkers, as the cinnamon bite can be
amplified by the rum.

Cocoa Creme
===========

Ever had chocolate satin pie in a fancy restaurant?  It's one of my
favorites, and CC reminds me very much of how such a confection just
sort of sashays across your tongue.

CC is pure joy to smoke; an excellent blend for novices or for
breaking in a new pipe.  With its light, smooth aroma, CC is a blend
to enjoy all day.  It simply refuses to bite or burn (unless you smoke
like a Hoover).

&gt;From its name, you'd expect that CC would have a pronounced
chocolate nose or taste.  Not true!  CC has a very mild cocoa aroma
when unlit that quickly goes away while burning.  The flavor has
just a *hint* of chocolate tempered with vanilla, and an
oh-so-smooth and creamy texture in the mouth.

I realize I'm waxing poetic about CC, but I can't get over how very
*good* this blend is!  I had almost given up my pipes altogether
because I couldn't find a blend that I could be happy with.  Then I
found CC and fell in love with my pipes all over again.

Happy Puffing!

Subject: A Christmas calabash

Greetings, pipe fans,

Hope y'all had a good Holiday! (Some of us may still be having one
around April or so, or trying to recover...)

This Christmas, I splurged on a Nording for myself. It's approximately
a "briar Calabash" shape, fairly large, with a full-bent stem and a
chopped top. Beautiful pipe, smokes nice and cool, and I haven't yet
found the first fill in it. I inaugurated it the right way, on
Christmas night, in front of a fireplace, with a bowlful of Balkan
Sobranie 759.

One of the things I found out, in connection with the Nording, is that
it is possible to negotiate price, even in a mall pipe shop, even just
before the holidays! I had seen the pipe in a display case in the John
David shop, and the store owner, noticing my interest, opened the
cabinet and let me have a closer look. I looked, agreed it was a nice
pipe, but thought the $70 pricetag was too much. "I'll wait until it's
on sale," I declared.

"You want a sale? We'll have a sale! I'll let it go for $60. How about
that?"

"Mmmm, nah, it's still a little too rich for my blood." He resumed
filling my tobacco order. I then had an inspiration.

"Now, for $50, I think I could buy it," said I.

"Wait a minute." He began rummaging around for a calculator. "I think
I can give you about 20 percent off. That'd bring it down to about
$55. How about that?"

"Sold," I replied, and handed over the plastic fantastic. The Nording
was mine. And, perhaps, part of what makes it so enjoyable is the
memory of this small, but satisfying, negotiation.

Whether or not you got a Christmas pipe this year, I wish you and
yours a happy "holiday from the Holidays." And, until next time,

	Smoke in peace,
	~\U Steve.

Subject: Harsh Re-Start


Dear fellow Pipers,

  I have only recently started smoking my pipe again after a long respite.
I went to the TinderBox and got some Golden Cavendish -- the problem
is that the smoke is a lot harsher than I remember from a few years ago.

I have been smoking out of my old pipe -- a fairly small pocket pipe
  that was once broken in and well used (during college).

My questions are --
  -- does my pipe need to get re-broken in?
  -- is there a milder blend I could get here in health concious So. CA?
  -- should I dump this little pipe and get a large one ?
       (would it give a milder smoke?)
  -- does a person's taste in smoking materials change with years?

James aka ????????@??.???????.???

[ I don't think the pipe needs to get broken in again, nor do you need
a new one (though it never hurts to have several and rotate them).
Check the tobak - if it's too dry, it can smoke harshly (as I'm
finding out right at this moment :-) Also, you may be smoking a bit
too hard, or the pipe might not be clean. 

As for taste in tobaccos, I know mine has changed. When I was 17 or
so, I used to smoke Amphora Blue exclusively; I'm now much more into
Englishoid blends.

Thanks for the note, James, and let us know how it goes! I hope one of
our other members will be able to suggest some things I've missed. -S. ]

Subject: Pipe stories and personalized bitmap pipe cursor.

Dear fellow pipe smokers:

Very happy to see the group alive and smoking.  I've had this piece of one of
the Sherlock Holmes' adventures sitting in my desk, and I've been meaning to
post it for a while now.  Well, better late than never.

(note: comments in brackets are obviously mine..)

-----------------------------------------------------------
&gt;From the "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"

(story begins ... mystery prevails ... the game is afoot)
(then, after collecting the clues...)

"He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue
dressing-gown, and then wandered around the room collecting pillows
from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs.  With these he
constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself
cross legged with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid
out in front of him.  In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting
there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly
upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him,
silent, motionless with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline
features.  So he sat as I dropped off the sleep, and so he sat when a
sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun
shining into the apartment.  The pipe was still between his lips, the
smoke still curled upward and the room was full of dense tobacco haze,
but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the
previous night."

(morning... mystery is solved ...)
(the police detective to Mr. Holmes...)

"I am sure Mr. Holmes that we are very much indebted for your having
cleared the matter up."

"I reached this one", said my friend, "by sitting upon five pillows
and consuming an ounce of shag.  I think, Watson, that if we drive to
Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast."

--------------------------------------------------------


Really enjoyable story.  I don't remember at this moment what is the
title of the story.  It is a short story in the collection of "The
Adventures of Sherlock Holmes".  I will look it up if someone wishes
to read it.  I personally recommend reading them all.

Question to the group:

Has anybody ever solved a mystery, ever found a great solution for a
complex or mundane problem "...by sitting upon five pillows and
consuming an ounce of shag" ? .. Let us know.

For the new (and old members) of the group that have a GUI type of
workstation (X, Motif, twm,...): some time ago I posted a bitmap that
I designed of a nice Oom Paul pipe (deep bent).  I looks very nice and
I use it as my X windows cursor.  I am re-posting it again:

Instructions:
------------

1) extract the first bitmap (between `cut mark 1' and `cut mark 2') and save it
in a file. Call it "bigpipe".

2) do the same for the bitmap mask (between `cut mark 2' and `cut mark end');
save it in the file "bigpipeMask".

3) to make the pipe your customized, personalized cursor, type in the system
prompt of an xterm:

xsetroot -cursor &lt;path&gt;/bigpipe &lt;path&gt;/bigpipeMask -bg brown -fg black

where &lt;path&gt; is the full path to the directory where "bigpipe" and "bigpipeMask"
are located.

4) move the cusor to the root window and be delighted.

5) you may want to put it in your .xinitrc so it is executed every time you
start X.

The hot-spot (the place where the click of the mouse takes effect) in
on the bit of the pipe.

I have a color monitor, so I don't know how it looks on a monochrome monitor.

It looks nicer on a solid root window background color.  I use:

xsetroot -solid grey46

Feel free to send me mail if you have problems with it. Actually, if
you do have problems, just sit down and smoke a nice and relaxing
pipe.  The answer will come to you as the blue smoke curls over your
head :-)~\U

Here it goes...

Subject: 9th Annual PCCA Convention and Pipe Show

I got a flyer from The Compleat Smoker a few weeks ago, announcing the
ninth annual Convention and Pipe Show, June 5-7, at the Gateway
Marriott in Arlington, VA. They'll have "over 130 tables of pipes,
tobacco, cigars, related books, and catalogs hosted by private
collectors, retail dealers, importers, and industry trade
representatives," and a number of special events. It looks like a good
show, and the price is right too: FREE. I'm planning on spending a day
there, probably Sunday the 7th.  Is anyone else interested in getting
together there or driving down?

The convention schedule is, roughly:

Friday, June 7:
- Reception, hosted by Levin Pipes and PCCA

Saturday, June 8:
- Coffee courtesy McClleland Tobacco
- Show floor open 10 AM - 5 PM
- Judging for show awards Saturday afternoon
- Buffet dinner banquet ($35 for that)
- Open smoker reception 9 PM - 1 AM

Sunday, June 9:
- Coffee courtesy _The Compleat Smoker_ magazine
- Show floor open 9 AM.
- Award announcement 11 AM.
- Pipe smoking contest at 1 PM. Over $5000 in prizes, including a
  Collector Radice pipe valued at $840 and a Savinelli briar finished
  18 pipe display cabinet valued at $700. Each contestant gets a new
  pipe, and the entrance is free!

The Crystal Gateway Marriott is at 1700 Jefferson Davis Highway,
Arlington, VA 22202, or call (800) 228-9290 (from inside Virginia,
(703) 920-3230). 

Please let me know if you're interested in carpooling, and hope to see
you there! Until next time, then, may every puff be cool, and may your
favorite place to light up be always smoke-friendly.

Smoke in peace,
~\U Steve.

Subject: Trip to Chicago.

Dear fellow pipe smokers:

I will be going to Chicago to work for 2 weeks on July, 13th.  Since I
will be staying over the weekend, it would be nice to tour around some
of the pipe shops in the area.  If anyone has recommendations on pipe
shops in the great Chicago area I would appreciate to hear about it.

And if anyone who lives in the area would like to get together to have
a nice pipe conversation over dinner, just let me know...

Smoke in peace,

Elias Mazur ~\U

in Chicago. Any other recos for Elias? -S. ]

Dear pipers,

In early August I'll be in Princeton, NJ at a summer seminar for two
weeks. I thought it might be a good opportunity to try some American
tobaccos, and perhaps buy an American pipe or two.

My question to you all: are there any good tobacconists around
Princeton, NJ?

Thank you for any tips!

Subject: Yo Ho off to the East

Elias reminded me that I needed to send a note to you guys.  I'll be in 
Cape Cod on Thursday and wonder if anyone knows about some tobacco/pipe
shops I should visit in New Fallmouth or Boston?  I am running low on
tobacco and might just have to stop smoking for a day or two to wait
until I get to a new unexplored shop there.  I'm brining my wife along,
so I probably won't be able to buy a new pipe ;-) but I can have fun
looking.

Subject: First pipe (corncob), smell vs. taste, Smoke-Con
 
 I'm always interested in mailing list meetings.  I live in Woburn, Mass,
10 miles north of Boston.  First choice would be to descend on Leavitt
and Pierce in Cambridge, or David P. Erhlich in Boston.  Second choice, 
and probably more central (especially since Our Moderator is in New Jersey) 
would be the Georgopolu factory in lower Manhattan.  Last time I was there 
(about 7 years ago) it was a small, five story building, complete with old 
cigarette rolling machines, headquarters for this three-generation family
importing business, tucked away behind Chase Manhattan Plaza in the financial 
district.

From: ???????@??????????.???.?? (Martin Ott)
Subject: Australia

Hi there,
happens that I go to Sydney via Honkong in about 2 weeks from now.
As I have only some 8 hrs for shopping in Honkong, I would highly
appreciate any suggestions about pipes and shops there (no, I dont
mean the opium pipes) before I go there.
In Sydney I'll have some more time, roughly 6 months working there.
But for I was told that smoking is frowned upon down there and
"out-of-date" as one said, there might be kinda subculture there, who knows.
So maybe one of you knows some 'under-cover addresses' there ?

regards
Martin

 Seacost tobacconists:
  Princeton:
   There was a suitably academic tobaco shop in Princeton Boro a few years
ago; things being the way they are it's probably still there.  Not being
a wearer of the Orange and Black myself (and my Princetonian sibling
being more interested in driving between Elm Street and the E-Quad) my 
directions are a little off, but Princeton Boro is a nice place to walk anyway:

   There is a short street "west" of Nassau Street (that is, the opposite
side from the campus).  In the quarter-mile stretch between the Post
Office (which might have been called Prospect Square, opposite about
the level of Nassau Hall) and the Boro Police Station (opposite the
U-Store) that's about where the shop was.  And maybe the street is
two blocks west of Nassau Street.

 Boston:
  As I've often repeated, the must-see is Leavitt and Pierce, south of
Harvard Yard, Mass Ave, Cambridge (MBTA Red Line to Harvard).  In downtown
Boston, near the Freedom Trail and Quincy Market/Faneul Hall is David
P. Ehrlich (top of Tremont St, near MBTA Green Line Govt Center [once
Scollay Sq] but near enough to Red/Green Park Street.)


 I've just come back from a weekend on the South Shore/Near Cape/Buzzard's
Bay area :-), but I don't know of any tobacconists in that area.  I did
start to break in a new briar pipe my fiancee bought me for my birthday
(OK, a Dr. Grabow, but it's my first briar since I realized corn cobs
suited my level-of-care better) on the shores of White Island Pond,
Wareham,  and we dined in two restaurants that tolerated pipe-smoking
(awfully close to our non-smoking table) so this may be a pipe-friendly
region.

  This new pipe, and a new bag of "Tropic Cavendish" were purchased
from a gentleman with a tracheotomy (not the best advertisement for our
vice) at the Tobacconist, Ltd, a mall chain store in Nashua, NH.  They 
used to carry a blend called "Mango Cavendish", which was similarly to 
a blend of the same name Ehrlich used to make.  The salesman said this 
was similar, but it was much less sweet and more bitter.
 
 My late grandfather-in-law (the reason my fiancee likes men with pipes)
used to smoke something called "Perkins #51 mixture".  I'll be looking for
it around here, but any pointers would be appreciated.  Its secondary
smoke (what's the word for the aroma that everybody gets to enjoy?)
is apparently similar to Mango Cavendish, so it might please both me
and my fiancee.

                                 a direct, if not permanent, position)

bears checking out. Thanks! -S. ]

Alas, my lack of speed cost me dearly!!!  Elias, where was your post when
I needed it!?!.  I went to Boston and saw nothing.  Well, I did see the
Freedom trail, the Tall ships, Cape Cod, Lexington and Concord, New Hampshire
coast, Maine (to Portland), the Battle Road, the Alcott and Hawthorne home, 
Emerson's house, and was a stones throw from Walden Pond.  But I did not 
get to one !#@%!$#^!$ pipe shop.  The worst part is that we parked near
Harvard and took the MTA from the Harvard station into downtown.  Apparently
I was soooo close to a great pipe shop I should have been able to sense it!!

There used to be a little nice pipe store in Princeton but I can't
remember the name or street name (*sigh*, the mind is going :).  It's
on a street parallel to the Nassau St.  And I believe you go down the
street opposite the main Princeton Univ. entrance and then make the
first right.  Hopefully you can find it with those directions :)

From: Steve Masticola (????????@??.???????.???)
Subject: Pipe initialization and maintenance

There's really no big deal to lighting a pipe; it just takes some
practice. First, get yourself a quality pipe and some good tobacco.  I
like Petersons and GBDs; they're usually a good buy. Avoid pipes with
lacquer finishes, or with a lot of "fills" (putty applied to smooth
over surface defects). Rough-surfaced pipes are fine, though, and
usually cost a little less (and smoke cooler).  You should plan on
spending $30-50 for a decent pipe; smoke shops are usually willing to
bargain on price, and often have sales.  Look them over and buy the
one you like best; it's largely a matter of personal preference.

Amphora Regular, or a similar mild non-aromatic or light aromatic
Burley/Virginia blend, would be a reasonable tobak for a beginner.
Keep the package tightly sealed to keep it fresh. Experiment with
tobaccos until you find what you like. It helps to get a tobacco that
your wife or girlfriend likes, so get her input. If she doesn't like
pipes at all, get a new one of those, too. :-)

Also get a package of cleaners, a bottle of pipe sweetner, a LOT of
wooden matches :-), and a pipe tool with tamper, reamer, and scraper.
I have a neat little one made by GBD; it looks like a silhouette of a
pipe, and has wooden sides. It cost me about $12.

Now, to the matter of lighting. Pack the tobacco a bit at a time,
perhaps 1/3 of the bowl. You want to have it slightly springy, neither
loose nor tight. It should be easy to draw through. Use the reamer to
loosen it if it's too tight.

Light a match and hold it horizontally until the match completely
catches fire. Then hold it horizontally over the bowl, puffing and
moving the match in a circular motion over the tobacco until it is
alight. Avoid burning the edge of the bowl when you light up. After a
little while, the tobacco may go out. If so, tamp it down a little and
re-light. If there's a lot of ash in the bowl, empty it out without
knocking the pipe, then tamp and re-light.

You may find the pipe getting a little juicy as you smoke. To avoid
this, try to keep your mouth dry as you smoke, and avoid swallowing.
If it does get juicy, run a cleaner down it to clear it out. However,
don't take the stem off the pipe while it's still hot, as this will
eventually cause the stem to get loose.  (You can, however, take a
military-type push stem off a hot pipe; many Petersons and Savinellis
have this feature.)

Try to puff rhythmically. If the pipe gets too hot, or if your tongue
gets "bitten", slow down, or lay the pipe down and let it cool awhile
if necessary.  If the pipe goes out a lot, speed up. Before too long
you'll find a good rhythm.

Try to smoke your pipe all the way down, as long as it's pleasant.
This helps build up an even layer of "cake" (carbon) inside the bowl.
When you're done, clean all the dottle (ashes and unburned tobacco)
out of the bowl with the reamer. Avoid banging your pipe on the
ashtray, as this can make dents in the pipe. Put a cleaner in the
(cool) pipe until the next time you smoke it, to absorb any leftover
juice and help keep it clean.

"Break-in" refers to the initial carbonization of the bowl.  Many
pipes now come with pre-carbonized bowls and require no break-in. I'd
recommend such a pipe for a beginner.  However, it's desirable to
maintain a 1-2 millimeter layer of cake for a cool, even smoke.

If your pipe smokes sour or gurgles, if there's a lot of goo inside
the stem, or if the cake is very thick, it's time for a cleaning. This
usually will have to be done every 5-10 smokes. First, use the knife
blade of the pipe tool to scrape the cake to the proper thickness.
Then use the reamer to get any heavy goo out of the wood part of the
air hole of the stummel (the wood part of the pipe). Dip a cleaner in
the pipe sweetner, and run it through the stem; repeat with fresh
cleaners until they come out clean. Repeat with the stummel air hole;
be careful not to get any cleaner on the outside of the pipe, as this
harms the finish. After cleaning, let the pipe rest a few hours before
smoking it again, to give the sweetner a chance to dry out.

If you like smoking a pipe, why not get another? Or several? Most pipe
smokers have some kind of a collection, since we like variety, and
because pipes smoke better if they're given time to rest between
smokes. I have about 25, but I've been building my collection for
about 15 years. Make sure you've gotten to know the last pipe before
you buy the next one, so you don't wind up with a lot of new, unsmoked
pipes. It's OK to make mistakes; hardly anyone likes every pipe they
buy.

Lastly, enjoy! Don't smoke if you don't feel like it. It should be a
pleasurable pastime.

Perhaps (undoubtedly!) our other members will have things to add to
this. There are a million ways to smoke a pipe, all of them right. :-)
Let us know how it's going.

Until next time, then,

				Smoke in peace,
				~\U Steve.

Many thanks to you who gave tips about tobacconists in Princeton! I
found the one in Quakerbridge Mall. He had a very nice tobacco called
"King's Delight". Smoked very pleasantly!

Subject: Further Princeton tips

Well, I finally found the Mystery Pipe Shop in Princeton - and I
wasn't too impressed. The shelves were bare and the owner was more
than a bit off-putting.

For anyone who'd care to form their own opinion, the shop is called,
"Tom Pipecarver and Son," and is at 4 Spring Street (a little way from
the corner of Spring and Witherspoon, one block away from Nassau).

Smoke in peace,
~\U Steve.

Well, by your description I shoudn't perhaps visit the

do pipe and tobacco buying since I pretty much regard myself as a

Hello All,
 
I was wondering if people could recommend pipe tobacco.  I'd like something 
mild and preferably aromatic and distributed nationally as opposed to local 
tobacconist custom blends.

[ Note to readers: This message was sent out unmoderated due to a bug
in the mail system. The bug has since been fixed; please let me know
if there are any further problems.

More to the point, I just tried a pouch of "Sail Natural," and liked
it a lot. No bite at all, so it's a good beginner's blend! -S. ]

Although my taste for tobacco today is located on the other side of
the spectrum from you (very strong, non-aromatic English tobacco), I
used to smoke a lot of aromatic and mild tobacco in the beginning of
my pipe smoking career.  At that time I lived in Brazil where it was
very hard to get custom made tobacco and sometimes hard to find even
the more commercial types.  For this reason I used to smoke more
commercial blends. Well, here goes a summary of what I remember (it's
been a while :-)...

- I personally enjoyed (and still smoke it sometimes) the Amphora. It
is a Dutch Cavendish tobacco.  It has 4 different types identified by
the color of the pouch (red, brown, green and blue).  The strength
determines the types. Based on your message you might want to check
the extra mild.

- Another one I used to smoke often was the Borkum Riff.  They have
several types (I remember a whiskey Cavendish that I liked).  They
have a very good Black Cavendish which is very good and aromatic, but
maybe a little stronger. Give it a try.

- A very good one that you may like is the Captain Black.  It is very
aromatic and mild.

- Another one that I remember trying was Sail. It is OK.

I know there are many other blends out there.  Given that the price of
one pouch is usually on the lower side, I would suggest trying several
types to see which one fits your taste better.

****IMPORTANT: do not discard a tobacco immediately if you didn't like
it.  Sometimes the moment is not right for that specific tobacco, or
maybe you will develop a taste for it after a few smokes.  It is the
old trial and error that makes life (and pipes) so rewarding.

Also you may want to call some tobacconists that ship anywhere in the
US.  I know one in NYC (I actually just bought a pipe there today)
that ships tobacco and pipes anywhere.  They have a very good
selection of tobacco.  If you want to give it a try, call him.  He is
very helpful and can indicate a custom blend from his shop that suites
your taste.  Here it is:

	Connoisseur Pipe Shop
	1285 Ave. of the Americas
	New York, NY

	tel:  (212) 247-6054

ask for Ed Burak. He is the owner and maker of the pipes.

By the way, since I am talking about Connoisseur pipes, I would
suggest to anyone who is interested, to give him a call anyway and ask
him to send some literature on his pipes and tobacco blends.  He has a
nice set with the design of his pipes, prices and tobacco.  It is well
worth the call.

Smoke in peace,

- Elias

Hi -
  I thought I'd finally get around to introducing muself, and maybe stir up
some discussion at the same time.
I've been smoking a pipe for about 6 years now, and I really enjoy it.  I also
go for cigars now and then (ballgames, in particular...).  I gravitate towards
aromatic Cavendish mostly.  I've been smoking a blend from Sir Timothy's in
Chicago area (used to live there and got hooked on it!) called Tipperary (sp?),
though I recently have started trying others again.  I spent last weekend in
Gatlinburg, TN, and visited "The Gatlinburlier Tobacconist".  They have a
pretty smooth blend called CAEDS Cove Cavendish that I sampled.  Haven't
decided which I like better yet.
The Gatlinburlier also had an interesting selection of pipes carved by a local
guy (Weber?) with some intricate faces - old man of the sea type, I guess.  I
wanted (needed?) one, but couldn't cough up the $200 for them.
On another topic, I would like to try my hand at carving my own brian pipes. 
Any tips would be appreciated, as well as sources for briar and stems.
   Later -
     Brian
      ????????@????.???

[ Thanks for the note, Brian! I've heard of Gatlin-Burlier, but
haven't had a chance to visit yet. Sounds fun! Let us know how your
search for the Perfect Blend progresses. -S. ]

Subject: Pipe material sources.

Hello,

I've finaly got something worthwhile to write about.  Brian requested some
information about pipe making and sources.  I've made two pipes so far.  One
that was more or less pre-turned for me (shank and stem fitted, but the bowl
had not been worked) and one from scratch (just out of a hunk of dried 
plant root - briar).  I'm smoking the one I made from scratch now, trying
to put a decent cake in the bowl.  The supplies I got from Pimo, Inc.  The
address is:

			Pimo, Inc.
			P.O. Box 482
			Skokie, IL  60077

			(708) 470-0640

They sell an introductory pipe making book "Pimo's guide to Pipe-Crafting
at home".  Really good book  about some pipe history and where briar 
comes from (after that story you might want to rush out and buy a couple
of pipes before they are all gone), and a must if you are starting from
scratch.

They sell the Plateaux (Blocks of cured briar) and other materials for a 
complete pipe maker.  One of the best tools is the tenon turning tool which
fits tenon and stem together exactly.  A drill press is a good thing to
have.  For the scratch pipe I used, drill press,  table saw, very small
hobby type metal lathe, files, sandpaper et. al.

Haven't tried carving images into a pipe.  For drilling the bowl, I took
a 3/4" spade bit and ground it into a tapered shape.  This worked better
than I had hoped.

Good luck with your project and let us know how it turns out.

[ Thanks for the word, Norm! I've still got 1 or 2 plateaux from
Pimo's that I hope to turn into pipes someday, when I'm wealthy enough
to have some shop space :-) -S. ]

Hi -
   I have a couple of pipes where the stem is loose in the shank (one
that will actually fall apart!)  Admittedly, these are not expensive
pipes, but I've grown accustomed to them and like them.  Is there some
way to tighten these up?
   On another note, I have a meerschaum pipe that I've been smoking
about once a week for over a year now - when will it start to
color?????  I'm smoking an aromatic cavendish in it.
   Last question - I will be spending about a week in downtown Detroit
(lucky me!) for a trade show soon.  Are there any great pipe shops I
should visit?  I'll actually be staying in Windsor, Ontario.  Any
leads would be appreciated!
   Thanks for the info!

[ Sorry, Brian, only one question allowed per letter! (Just kidding
:-) I'll repost an article about loose stems which was on the
newsgroup earlier. Re the meerschaum, I don't have any personal
experience (don't like meerschaums because they're so delicate), but
I've heard they may take months to color. Last, I don't know how close
this is to Detroit, but you might want to check out:

Subject: Stem repair from the Golden State
[ Reposted from pipes#65, September 14, 1991. -S. ]

I had the fortunate experience to be within a hundred miles of our
dedicated moderator Steve recently when I was called to NY City rather
briskly on business.  With a suit bag in hand,  ready for the drive to
the airport, I decided to sit down at the system and drop a quick email
note for Steve letting him know that I was going to be on the East
Coast.  I suggested a possible meeting, signed off, and headed East.

Later,  when I had been working at the trouble spot for a day,  I
arrived at my hotel room to find a message from Steve.  I quickly
called him and we agreed to meet for dinner the next day.  Elias was
supposed to join us but he had a prior obligation somewhere else.

During our discussion at dinner the topic of loose stems came up.  I
had told Steve that the tobacco shop owner where I first bought my pipe
had taught me a quick fix for a loose stem.  Steve suggested that I
send this out over the mailgroup.  Not a bad suggestion, so here it
is...

I have a problem of having the stems on my pipe becomming loose over
time.  I think this happens because I get a lot of moisture in my
pipe.  (No, I don't remove the stem while the pipe is hot!)  Anyhow,
when I was a beginner I took my first pipe back to the shop and showed
the guy my problem.  I expected a repair job, but he smiled at me and
said, "I'll show you this once, after that you're on your own."

For those of you who don't know or don't care about the names of pipe parts,
here is a picture:  (please disregard the lousy Ansii art)

                                  _____________
                    _________    /   _________/
                   (         )  /   /     ^------------Stem
                   (         ) /\  /         _____          _______
    Bowl --------&gt; (         )/  \/         {     |        |       }
                    (        /   /          { -----      ---       }
                     (__________/ ^         { ----- &lt;    ---       }
                                  |         {_____| |   ^  |_______}  
                                  |                 |   |
                      Shank ------+      Mortise ---+   +--- Tenon

He took my pipe and removed the stem.  He grabbed the thickest pipe cleaner
he had and inserted it into the mouth end of the pipe until it just appeared
at the other end.  Then he lit a match and held it under the stem for a few
seconds (maybe five or so).  The flame never touched the tenon on the stem,
but it did melt the rubber.  After this he quickly pushed the stem against the
counter being careful to hold the stem so that the tenon was as perpendicular
to the counter as possible.  This caused the tenon to bulge a little.

After waiting a few minutes to allow the stem to cool, he grabbed a piece of
sandpaper and started to bring the tenon back down to a size that would fit
the mortise.  When he got close he kept testing the tenon by inserting it
into the mortise.  He cautioned "Never try to force the tenon in,  let it
fit snug, but easy to insert.  Otherwise you'll only end up with a cracked
shank."  (I didn't listen very well because after a year I did crack the
shank on one of my favorite pipes,  but it was repairable with a metel band.)

Once he got the tenon to fit snug, he removed it from the shank and rubbed 
the entire tenon surface with a pencil.  This provided a lubricant (graphite)
and allowed the snug tenon/mortise to fit together nicely.  His last comment
was,  "This 'quick fix' is good for about three times,  after that you are
going to need a new stem."

I would'nt try this method for the first time on your most favorite pipe, but
it does beat sending them in to get repaired.  

[ Thanks for the words from "This Old Pipe", Norm! -S. ]

Subject: Pipes Digest: any collectors out there?

Are there any collectors of rare or collectible pipes out there?
I don't have the time or money to make it to any of the pipe
collectors' shows held around the country, but I would like to
get in touch with anybody in the Pipes Digest mailing list who is
into collecting.  I am, in a small way.

One pipe that I've been on the lookout for is one of the Peterson
Mark Twain collectors' series.  (I'm interested in the "firsts"
in the series, not the "seconds".)  This series came out about
nine years ago.

I've been very impressed by Peterson's Sherlock Holmes series,
both in term of smoking quality and craftsmanship.  That's why
I'd like to add one of the Mark Twains to my collection; I figure
they did as good a job with the Mark Twains as they have with the
Sherlock Holmes.  Does anyone know of a Mark Twain "first" available 
for sale or swap?

Are there any other Peterson smokers/collectors out there?  I've
owned and smoked all the top-shelf brands of pipes, including Dunhills 
and Charatans, but Peterson is still my all-around favorite in terms 
of smokability.  And the Sherlock Holmes series is a cut above even
the standard Peterson.  The Peterson "system" pipes, with the
cavity in the shank to absorb moisture (the innovation that
attracted Mark Twain to the Peterson pipe) smoke great, but I've
also had good luck with the non-System pipes, such as the Kildare.

[ I love Petersons, and have a Mark Twain that I got at a show in
Washington in August. Might I suggest you try Levin Pipes
International? They sell a lot of collectable pipes, and every so
often send out photos of their stock. They also have an "on approval"
ordering policy, which I find very attractive for mail order. Their
address is:

	Levin Pipes International
	RFD 1 Box 565
	West Hill Road
	Craftsbury, VT 05826

I'm also planning to buy one of the Sherlock Holmes pipes as a present
for defending my thesis, so if you find a supplier, please let me know
too! -S. ]

Subject: my first mail over this list

Hello all of you,

This is my first mail over this list. I heard that there was not much
going on but I still hope that people can help me with some question.
But first the following, I am a cigar smoker (so not a pipe smoker),
but I hope that this is no problem for you. I really enjoy sitting
relaxed and smoke a cigar for an hour.  The most important of this, is
that you can not do anything else!

Furthermore I run an Fidonet BBS (2:500/278) in the Netherlands about
wine, beer, liqour, chees, pipe and cigars. I started 1/2/92 and the
most active part is beer. I even wrote to all cigar-associations in
the Netherlands (and there much, because of our past), and these
people never took the keyboard to look at my BBS:-( This is of course
a real pity:-(. I hope to get on this list a better sounding board.

I am looking for methods how you can taste a cigar in a structured way
(I know some books about wine tasting). I am looking for terms which
can be used to describe the tate of the smoke in a simple way (not to
simple, but simple enough to distinquish a cigar/pipe by its
describtion).

Does somebody have such a structured way of tasting cigars (or pipes)?
The method is the most important and the used terms.

Furthermore do people know about other distributions lists /digest
which handle a good smoke!

All the best,

Victor

[ I'm finally out of words of wisdom, Victor, but perhaps our other
Gentle Readers can help! There is a BBS in the US called the Briar
Patch, which has a (somewhat inactive) pipes thread. The thread is run
by Neil Murray, the same fellow who publishes the Agricultural and
Mechanical Gazette.  I don't think they're on Fidonet, but if you'd
like to call them, it's (313) 340-0814. -S. ]

Subject: re: Pipes Digest #82 - October 24, 1992

It's nice to see so much activity on Pipes Digest.  I have a
reaction to Brian Morgan's question about coloring meerschaum
pipes, which is also an opportunity for me to give a plug for
English-type tobacco blends.  :-)

I read in a Tinder Box brochure years ago that blends containing
Latakia (i.e., most English types) tend to color meerschaums more
quickly.  I've never done a side-by-side comparison, but I've had
a meerschaum for two years that I rarely smoke (maybe 2 or 3
times a month), but it's still on the way toward being nicely 
colored.  You might want to try an English type to see if it
speeds up the coloration.  Dunhill Standard Mild or Medium, and
Rattray's Professional Mixture are mild, and not a whole lot
stronger than your aromatic cavendish.  Also, the combination of
latakia and the distinctive patina that meerschaum imparts to the
smoke is a unique (and I think delicious) taste experience.

OK, enough of my etitist Anglophilic ranting. 

Steve, thanks for the address of Levin Pipes International.  I'll
drop them a line.

I believe that Barclay, my local tobacconist, has a few of the 
Sherlock Holmes series still in stock.  Their address is:

	Barclay Pipe and Tobacco
	1677 West Lane Avenue M-12
	Columbus, Ohio 43221
	(614) 486-4243

[ Note to members: Ron's new address is ?????@?????????.???????.???.
-S. ]

First of all, I would like to say thanks to Steve for allowing me the
opportunity to become a member of the group. I have had a love affair
with the pipe ever since my navy days. I own Petersons, Butz-Choquins,
a Savinelli, Pioneer Calabashes, clays (broke all of them), and of course
a handcrafted meerschaum. As for as Tobacco goes, I am still looking for
the Holy Grail, but I have discovered that I have a soft spot for anything
with a fair share of Latakia in the mixture. Around my house, you will
find dozens of empty tins of the various English blends. Enough of this.

There was a Gentleman, who left a note inquiring as to how long it will
take a meerschaum to stain. There is no easy answer. I have given up on
my Calabashes. After years of smoking they seem no worst for the wear,
but on the otherhand my meerschaum is coming along nicely. The shank and
the top of the bowl have in a few weeks turned a nice brown. If I may I
would like to pass along a few hints. These hints are not mine but come from
the "The Ultimate Pipe Book" by Richard Carleton Hacker.
1. Do not allow any cake to form inside the bowl. Any cake will only
   impede the coloring process.
2. As you smoke your pipe blow the smoke on the pipe. Mr. Hacker claims
   this will speed up the process.
Also, I suspect not all meerschaum is equal. If after a few months the pipe
shows no signs of behaving,you may have something other than quality
meerschaum. I hope this is not the case.

		 Pipes Digest #84 - November 7, 1992

For once, we don't have any new members between postings! But we're up
to 59 members now - not an all-time high, but pretty darn good, IMHO!
Which brings me to the following (fanfare please)...

ADMINISTRATIVE NOTE:	(don't that look official? Even officious? :-) 
--------------------

IF your email address changes, and you'd like to keep on receiving the
Digest, please let me know your new address! I've been able to track
down a few members who've moved, but this has been the exception
rather than the rule. If someone's mail starts bouncing, I have no
choice but to drop them from the mailgroup.

And now, after that heavy Latakia-like note, let's lighten up (and
light up) with Martin and Douglas!

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

Subject: Cigar Recommendations?

Fellow Fumeurs,

In recent months I find my interests turning more in the direction
of fine cigars, but I've been sadly unmethodical in exploring the
field.  I've discovered that my tastes do appear to have a
definition:  relatively short (6.5" or less), fat (48 ring or
greater), mild but aromatic (usually Dominican), hand-rolled, with a
preference for a Maduro wrapper.  The stinging intensity of a
smuggled Cuban "Cohiba" I smoked a couple of months ago did not
please me.  Can anyone suggest a cigar that I might like, within
that range?  How about one outside of that range, and what are its
characteristics?  Further, in one of the mail order catalogs I saw a
reference to a "bullseye cutter".  I normally use a guillotine, and
have seen piercers and vee-cutters, but this is apparently something
different from any of those.  How does it work?  Thanks ...

Hi Steve,
 
I was wondering if any of the members of this mailgroup live in Southeastern
Michigan (where I live.)

[ Can't say, Stefan; the only info I keep on members is in the form of
email addresses and past submissions. This is for the protection of
the members, just in case the government criminalizes posession of
tobacco :-) Anyone else here from Michigan?  -S. ]

Hello Martin,

Ik hope I can help you.

&gt;In recent months I find my interests turning more in the direction
&gt;of fine cigars, but I've been sadly unmethodical in exploring the
&gt;field.  

It is rather difficult indeed, I am also trying to find THE cigar. But it
seems that the FIRST cigar I smoked is still the best! When I was in San Jose,
there was an excellent bookshop/cigarshop which sells a lot of cigars (I think
some 50 brands). All coming from Dominicans, Cannary isles, Mexico, etc. But
non from Cuba (is that not allowed in US?) and not from Holland!

I am coming from the Netherlands, so my first cigar was also a Dutch one
(Balmoral), and as I said above this is still the one I prefer. I am still
searching of course for better ones, but Cubans and all other 'puros' lack
something, they are quiet flat in there smell/flovour/taste. And furthermore
I think they are quiet heavy. From most Cuban cigars I become sick :-( (Cuesta
Rey, Quintero [this is the best Cuban until now], Romeo y Julieta, H. Upmann).

So I would recommend you of course a Dutch cigar. The best coronas, in my
opinion are: Justis van Maurik, Balmoral, Schimmelpenninck, De Huifkar (in
that order).  German cigar are quiet heavy in my opinion and Spanish cigar are
not so bad (although they are quiet 'puros').

But I am still open for other ideas of course! So let me know your chooses!

Furthermore: do you have ideas how to describe the smell/taste of
cigars/pipes. It is all smokey;-), but that does not make a difference. In
wine one has a lot of describing terms, but the only ones I know for cigars
is: Java, cuban, etc. tates/smells, but that does not say enough! I hope we
could get some swapping of ideas also on this matter.  

&gt;I've discovered that my tastes do appear to have a
&gt;definition:  relatively short (6.5" or less), fat (48 ring or
&gt;greater), mild but aromatic (usually Dominican), hand-rolled, with a

Most of the above mentioned Dutch cigars are some 12 cm (some 5 "), corona
type (12 mm, 1/2"), mild and hand role (not all). They are made from at least
some 5 tabaccos (havana, brasil, java, sumatra, etc.). What is the meaning of
48 ring???

&gt;preference for a Maduro wrapper.  

This is difficult for me, I do not have any reference on this colours. I read
about it in a book, but what the color is, I do not know. Do you have some
colored flyer about cigar colors? If so let me know, I will forward my
snail-mail address.

All the best,
Victor

[ Thanks for the update, Victor! BTW, I understand that there are some
books on cigars, and even a "Cigar Connoisseur" magazine. Can other
members shed some light on cigar descriptives? -S. ]

Steve,

As regards Martin Lodahl's request for maduro cigar
recommendations....  Arturo Fuentes makes a good maduro 
Rothschilds in that size range, rather ostentatiously wrapped 
in a slice of cedar wood.  La Unica also makes a (much cheaper)
maduro in about that size.

If you're really into maduro cigars, I'd highly recommend
Macanudo maduros and Royal Jamaica maduros.  I don't think they
conform to your size &amp; shape preferences, but they are excellent
cigars.  They have the characteristic maduro flavor, but are
milder than other maduros.  Kind of expensive, though.  I can
only afford these once in a while.

As for Roug Mayo's request for high-Latakia English blends....
Dunhill Nightcap is pretty heavy in Latakia, I seem to recall.
Balkan Sobranie No. 759 (the black label) also has a lot of
Latakia.  So does Rattray's Black Mallory, but it's so strong
that I can't finish a bowl of it.

If you try some of these, I'd recommend them as an evening smoke.  
These are 'way too strong for the morning, at least for me.  I
usually smoke medium blends like Rattray's Professional during
the day, and smoke the heavier blends once in a while, in the 
evening.  But some people can handle the heavier blends better 
than I can.

While we're on the subject of tobacco, has anybody else tried the
Esoterica Tobbaciana blends, recently imported from England?
They're a few more dollars than average English blends but worth
it in my book.  My favorite is Pembroke, a medium-to-full latakia
blend flavored with a little cognac.  Yumyumyum.  Margate is a
heavy blend, with a lot of latakia.

[ Thanks for your update, Steve! Hope that you or some of our other
readers can point us toward a source of the Esoterica, for the
holidays! -S. ]

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #85 - November 14, 1992
 
In Pipes Digest #85, Victor Reijs offered some excellent suggestions
on cigars, asking:

&gt; non from Cuba (is that not allowed in US?) and not from Holland!

Cuban cigars have been forbidden, alas, in the U.S.A. for some 30
years now.  They do find their way in, usually smuggled in from
Canada.

&gt; 	... Cubans and all other 'puros' lack
&gt; something, they are quiet flat in there smell/flovour/taste. And furthermore
&gt; I think they are quiet heavy. From most Cuban cigars I become sick :-( 

My experience exactly.  

&gt; &gt;I've discovered that my tastes do appear to have a
&gt; &gt;definition:  relatively short (6.5" or less), fat (48 ring or
&gt; &gt;greater) ...
&gt; 
&gt; 	... What is the meaning of 48 ring???

Cigar makers use the same measure of the diameter of the cigar that
jewelers use for finger rings.  "48 ring" = 48/64 of an inch, or
3/4", or ~18mm.

&gt; &gt;preference for a Maduro wrapper.  
&gt; 
&gt; This is difficult for me, I do not have any reference on this colours. I read
&gt; about it in a book, but what the color is, I do not know. Do you have some
&gt; colored flyer about cigar colors? If so let me know, I will forward my
&gt; snail-mail address.

I don't have such a thing, but I have a description in words.  What
follows is what I've gathered from an article written by Lew
Rothmann in the summer catalog of the JR Tobacco Company:

*  Claro claro, claro, jade, Cambridge, Candela, American Market
Selection (AMS):  All these mean a light green wrapper, once favored
by the American market.

*  Claro, Natural, English Market Selection (EMS), Oxford Cafe,
English Claro, Rare Corojo, Spanish Claro:  A light brown wrapper. 
As you can see, imaginative marketing has led to more than a little
confusion.

*  Colorado Claro, Natural, EMS, Oxford, Cafe, Spanish Claro,
Rosado:  Brown wrapper.

*  Colorado, Natural, EMS, Oxford, Cafe, Spanish Claro, Rosado:  The
next degree darker brown, presumably.

*  Colorado Maduro, EMS, Maduro:  Dark brown wrapper.

*  Maduro, Spanish Market Selection (SMS):  Nearly black wrapper.

*  Oscuro, Maduro Maduro, Extra Oscuro:  Absolutely black wrapper.

Which all goes to show that if you see a cigar in a catalog with
what's described as a "Natural wrapper", they haven't really told
you much that you can use.

And Steve Houser suggested:

&gt; As regards Martin Lodahl's request for maduro cigar
&gt; recommendations....  Arturo Fuentes makes a good maduro 
&gt; Rothschilds in that size range, rather ostentatiously wrapped 
&gt; in a slice of cedar wood.  La Unica also makes a (much cheaper)
&gt; maduro in about that size.

I've never been disappointed in an Arturo Fuentes, though sometimes
surprised at the price.  I'll give the La Unica a try, too.

&gt; If you're really into maduro cigars, I'd highly recommend
&gt; Macanudo maduros and Royal Jamaica maduros.  I don't think they
&gt; conform to your size &amp; shape preferences, but they are excellent
&gt; cigars.  They have the characteristic maduro flavor, but are
&gt; milder than other maduros.  Kind of expensive, though.  I can
&gt; only afford these once in a while.

My cigar club has bought both, and they are indeed fine cigars.
I'm not sure that we'll be buying more, though, as the rest of the
group seems headed in a double-claro to EMS sort of direction, while
I'm going more EMS to Maduro.

Thanks, all!

Subject: Cigars and books

A book store which sells cigars in San Jose eh?  Where would I find such a
place?  Hmmmmm?  Do they also sell pipe tobacco?  I know of one place not
too far from here in Half Moon Bay (over the hill from San Jose) called
Bay Book and Tobacco.  They sell (are you ready for this) books and tobacco.
(Us Californians are pretty clever people).  Fun place to go.  Never heard
that San Jose had the same type of deal.  Please elaborate.

Pleasant smoking,

Norm

Subject: books on cigars

Hello all of you,

Thanks Steve for your reference to Cigar Connoisseur'. Do you have
more information on this one (price, where to get it, etc.). I have
the idea that there are not many books on cigars (there are more in
pipes;-).
The books I have are:
The book of the Havana cigar, B. Innes, 1983, Orbis Publishing,
London, ISBN 0-85613-546-1
Zigarren-Brevier oder Was raucht der Connaisseur, Z. Davidoff, 1991,
Mohndruck, Guetersloh, ISBN 3-7014-0751-7

(the real prices are not known, because I bought both at second hand
bookshops)

The last book is, I think, originaly in French, but perhaps there is
also an English version.

Both books handle Havana cigars, I never have found a book about
Brazil or Dutch cigars. I am thinking of trying to get together some
people in the Netherlands to print a book (in the style of present
wine quide books [incl. some 'touristic' info]).

If people know about others cigar books, please let me know (if possible
some indication of the price).

All the best,

Victor

[ Victor, all the information I have about the magazine is that the
name of the publisher is Marvin R. Shanken, who also publishes "Wine
Spectator." (There's an article about him, and "Cigar Connoisseur," in
the September 21 issue of _Newsweek_; that's how I found out.)  But if
you call up the information desk at your local library, they might be
able to help.  Please let us know if you find out, and thanks for the
book references! -S. ]

Hello! As requested in the opening letter here's a brief explanation of myself
and why I am interested in the discussion here.

I am a 38 year old white male, born and raised in New Jersey but living in San
Francisco since 1980. I did a stint as a tobacconist while completing a degree
in History back in the late 70's. I worked for Wally Frank in their retail
store in Paramus, NJ. My involvement with pipes and cigars has dwindled since
then, especially after I became involved in judging homebrewed beers and needed
to preserve my palate. Nevertheless I have always appreciated the craft and
maintain my pipe collection, imbibing on the rare occasion. My tobacco of
choice is Rattrays Red Rap. I find it mixes well with a dram of Prime Malt in
the late evening.

I'm looking forward to conversing here.

RW...

Subject: cigar shop in San Jose

Hello all of you,

Here is the address of that cigar shop (and I though I have seen that
also pipes, and pipe tabacco): it is Downtown Tabacco &amp; News, 70 East
Santa Clara St, San Jose, CA 95113, (408)295-2277.

The cigars I bought there were:
A. Fuente, De cassio Teides, Te-am, Juan Lopez, Costa Rey. He had much
more. And I had the bad-luck that I only wrote the names down when
being home (and some of my cigars were stolen in the plane, so :-()

If someone is going to visit this shop, do the greetings to mister
Louis Chendler, I had a nice talk with about cigars, and offer him
some Dutch cigars (which he liked very much:-).

A disclamer, I have no commerciel binding to the above mentioned
shop;-)

All the best,

Victor

[ Thanx, Victor! -S. ]

Subject: Hello and Loose Bits

Hello all, from one of the new guys on the list.

Perhaps one of you briar-wise persons out there can shed some light on
a curiosity with one of my pipes.

But first a little background.  I have been smoking pipes on and off
for the past 30 years (I started when I three! I wish!!!).  I am
recently coming off one of the 'off' times.  It's been about 8 years
since I was regularly smoking my pipes.  Throughout those 8 years the
pipes have been boxed away in the basement.

Upon unpacking them, I picked up one of my favorites to give it a 
gentle caress and, the bit falls out!  I couldn't figure out for
the life of me why it should have become so loose.

The bit is nylon (I think that's the material they are made of???),
a nice, iridesent variegation of creams and browns.  It was in 
good shape, so I hated the thought of having to have a new one 
made for the pipe.

So I decided to put a little of my analytical prowess to work.
(always a dangerous proposition!!)  I figured when wood gets wet,
it swells.  Perhaps if I soaked the stem of pipe, it would also
swell, thereby making a tighter fit for the bit.  So, at the
risk of ruining the finish, I stuck the stem in water for about
a day.

Returning with great expectations, I stuck the bit into the pipe
and it was as loose as ever.  At that point I pretty much
resolved myself to having a new stem made.  However, a few days
later I came back to the pipe and lo and behold, the bit was as
snug as ever.

Now I would have figured that the stem would have swelled while
it was sitting 'in' the water but, that was not the case - it
was not until the stem was 'out' of the water for a few days
did the swelling take place.

So, back to the reason of this post - is this normal for briar?
Also, it seems strange that only one pipe out of the bunch
turned up loose.

Well enough rambling for now....
Once again, a smokey hello to all...

[ First off, thanks for your post! Second off, please excuse me, but
I'm mildly horrified. ((8-O Water is what causes the stems to become
loose in the first place.  Taking a pipe apart when it's hot and
getting goo up the shank is bad enough news, but you _really_
shouldn't soak a pipe in water!

There are two more orthodox ways to deal with loose stems - have a pro
make a new one, or expand the old stem with heat. Your stem material
sounds like acrylic, which is fairly common. And I've run into repair
people who claim to be able to duplicate any stem. Contact:

	J. T. &amp; D. Cooke
	RFD 1 Box 1022
	East Fairfield, VT 05448-9801
	(802) 849-6272

I'll send you a back article on stem repair from Norm, if you'd rather
go the second route. -S. ]

Subject: Neophyte

Howdy, I'm new here.  I figure I'll lurk more than I submit -- at least
for the time being, but there was a suggestion that I let the order know
what I'm about ...

I'm another one of those homebrew fiends that wandered over.  I'm 24
yrs old, currently work in Pierre, SD -- I hope to end up in a REAL
city in the next year or so.  I smoked a pipe off and on for about 4 
years ending this past spring.  I put it away for a while, and I've
irrationally let a woman's views on tobacco influence me into not enjoying
the occasional recreational bowl or two.  (Support is welcome :-)

I'm not too knowledgeable about things -- I guess I know I like vanilla
in my tobacco, and I'll accept any advice on what to look for in a reasonably
priced pipe.

That's all -- I'm glad to be here!
--Danny Breidenbach

[ You have _my_ support, Danny! Personally, from now on, Steve only
dates those female folks who love the smell of a good pipe. Had too
much trouble the other way... :-( I'll send you the generic "how-to"
article, re your other questions. -S. ]

Subject: East Lansing pipe shop

	I was in East Lansing, Michigan, today and had the opportunity to
visit Campbell's Smoke Shop, a small, pipe-specialty shop, but which
offers cigars and cigarettes as well.  Someone on this list asked if
there were any Michigan members, and this is my response.
	Campbell's is in Block One of M.A.C Avenue, just off Grand River
Avenue, which goes by the Michigan State campus.  It offers about 30
types of tobacco, and has 200-300 pipes for sale.  According to a
brochure I picked up the pipes are made by Savinelli, Peterson,
Stanwell, CAO, Clairmont and Wiley.  They also offer Savinelli
Seconds, and Savinelli makes pipes to the specifications of the shop.
They handle mail orders as well.  (The zip code is 48823 if you want
to write to them.)
	There seem to be few pipe shops in Michigan.  This is the only
one I've been to, and so I have no way to judge it.  It's a heck of a
step up from supermarkets, though.  All of the employees are always
friendly and helpful, and willing to answer questions.  They seem
knowledgeable to me.  It's a nice place.

Subject: loose bits and difficult sucking

Hello Michael and others,

You did an excellent experient. and the results are
indead what one could expect. Wood is becoming bigger
while nylon is becoming smaller, when wet (if you are
sometimes camping, one can also see this after a wet
day, the nylon tents will be nicely tight, while the
cottons are miserable looking;-).

If this experiment is oke for the pipe, I do not
know;-)

Related to this (or not related, I do not know), is
the following:
While smoking a cigars it sometimes happens that the
sucking on the cigar becomes more difficult. I say
becomes, because in the beginning it sucks normal and
and after the difficult part it again becomes normal.
I can not say when the difficult part will happen!

I really do not know what reason there is, why this
happens (does it have to do will heat, way of
manifacturing the cigar, wetness, ...). Because a
pipe is even more handmade, does one also experience
this kind of things while smoking a pipe???

All the best,

Victor

[ Sounds like the same thing as pipes, Victor; little bits of tobacco
getting stuck, then coming free. -S. ]

Subject: Stem Repair followup

Your stem material sounds like acrylic, which is fairly common. 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I'll send you a back article on stem repair from Norm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Steve,

Just a note to point out that the repair method I described only works with
the vulcanized rubber (the black stems) as far as I know.  Anybody else out
there with different knowledge?

Anyhow,

Thanks for the 'by' line.

Norm

[ Point taken, Norm. Thanks for the correction! -S. ]

Subject: re. loose stems

Well after being properly and thoroughly chastised by our moderator
for the soaking the shank (I even used the right word this time) of
my pipe in water, I PROMise - I'll never do THAT again!  Seriously
though, I never realized that it was water/moisture that caused 
the stem to become loose.  As I postulated in my orginal post, it
seems the shank should swell as it became damp.  I suppose what's
going is that the inside diameter of the shank is actually enlarging
rather decreasing as it swells - I guess that makes sense.

At any rate, thanks for straighting me out Steve.

     Mike-

ps  Please send a copy of your 'generic how-to article' - I think
    I might need it!  Thanks-

[ Who ME? Chastise? Couldn't be; you must be thinking of some other
pipes mailgroup moderator! :-) The "how-to" article has wung its way
to you. -S. ]

Subject: Pipe making video

Just got a video on how to make a pipe, from an outfit called HTV in
Dover, Delaware. The video is _very_ homebrew, but at least somewhat
informative; I learned some things I didn't know before, such as how
to clean tripoli off a buffing wheel.

The guy who made the video is a garage woodcarver, certainly no Norm
Abram, though he did OK with the tools he had. I guess the video was
worth it, since I was inspired to read the Pimo's book more closely
afterward. :-)

Ah, well, for the days when I have a real home and a workshop, instead
of a dorm room. Coming soon, I hope! Each day brings us a little
closer. So, until the next time,

				Smoke in peace,

Steve,

This isn't really related to pipes (as far as I know), but your
mentioning the upcoming completion of your thesis has me
wondering what you're getting your degree in.  

I'm interested in this kind of stuff because I've been feeling a
sweet nostalgia for graduate school.  We live right next to Ohio
State University, and my wife has gone back to complete her BA.
Since you're still in the middle of the fray, you could probably
cure my nostaliga with a dose of reality.  :-)

Subject: obstruction in cigar

Hello Steve,

Could told in the last pipes digest that the effect of difficult
sucking of a cigar could be compaired to what happens in a pipe, when
something obstructs the pipe. But I do not understand how you can
compare this in a cigar? I do not see how tabacco could do that, or is
the tabacco wronbgly roled so that there is at some place to much
tabacco, and when this tabocco gets hot, it enlarges, could that be
the reason??? Are there people who have some scientific explanation?

All the best,

Victor

[ It might swell as it gets wet, or a piece of tobacco might break off
and get lodged in some part of the cigar. That's my opinion, as a
non-expert; anyone have any more informed ideas? -S. ]

&gt; 
&gt; Could told in the last pipes digest that the effect of difficult
&gt; sucking of a cigar could be compaired to what happens in a pipe, when
&gt; something obstructs the pipe. But I do not understand how you can
&gt; compare this in a cigar? 

&gt; Are there people who have some scientific explanation?

Yes, but let me give my answer first.
 
The most common cause of cigar blockage (constipanatella, as the ancient 
Romans termed it) is nothing more complicated than that some overworked 
Honduran cigar maker has carelessly rolled a live tobacco worm (actually,
a caterpillar, but I'm sticking with the vernacular) into the cigar.  For
those who've never seen one, an adult tobacco worm is about a half inch 
(12.7mm) around and one to two inches long, shaded in a putrid green.  
They're the only terrestrial life form that can survive eating tobacco (try
it yourself if you don't believe me) and they look about like you'd expect
something that lives on tobacco to look like.  

Anyway, the adults are so big that they're hard to miss; usually it's just
little caterpillars that get rolled up.  Mostly they get squished; after a
month or two the juices get soaked up by the cigar.  The dessicated husk
that remains doesn't prevent smoking the cigar, although a slightly pungent
or putrid flavor may remain.

Sometimes the tobacco worm survives the trauma of being rolled up.  If it
does, it finds itself in tobacco worm heaven, and usually responds by
eating a cavity into the cigar.  If you like your cigars fresh, then a
blocked stogie probably indicates the presence of a live, near-adult worm.
That's the better of your two options.

Given time, the caterpillar will mature, spin a coccoon, and change into
a butterfly.  They're actually quite lovely, marked with purple and gold
and scarlet, but it hardly matters because you're only going to see it for
a couple of seconds as it shoots from the end of your lit cigar, bursts
into flames, and falls lifeless to the floor, leaving a trail of acrid
smoke.

Anyway, I don't mean to sound alarmist.  This rarely happens; heck, I've
only seen it a couple of times myself, and it's not really *that* gross
once you get used to it.

Enjoy! 8-)

From: ?????@??????.??.??? (Robert Byron Sweet)
Subject: no subject (file transmission)

In regards to a previous request for information about pipe shops
in Michigan, and in response to John Perry's input about
Campbell's Smoke Shop in particular.

I know of three shops in Michigan:

There is a shop in the mall in Battle Creek which has a variety
of blends, as well as a decent collection of pipes, especially
carved meershaum ones. I've purchased a couple of pipes there,
including a decent meershaum job, though I've really come to the
conclusion that meershaum is just too darn soft to make a day to
day pipe out of.  Battle Creek is a smallish town, and you can't
miss the Mall if you drive down I94.  The mall is just South of
the express way.

The second shop I know of is in the ground floor of the Fisher
building next door to General Motors headquarters in downtown
Detroit. This shop also sells small snack items (gum, candybars,
etc.) and is really a cigar shop, not a pipe shop. Not having
been there in a couple of years I can't recall if they even sell
house blends of pipe tobacco.  The cigar collection on the other
hand is decent.

Third there is Campbell's Smoke Shop in East Lansing. Campbell's
is a nice place with a polite staff. (I detest snobbish store
clerks) I recently went in with a friend and we both bought new
Savanelli pipes there, as well as a few varieties of tobbaco. I
particularly like blend #2 (a full English blend, though a bit
harsh), blend #16 (English and American tobaccos), and blend #23
(a nice flavorful blend that has almost no bite). I also
purchased a half dozen cigars, relying upon the advise of the
shopkeeper.  Though decent, I've come to the conclusion that I'm
just not a cigar smoker, I'm a pipe man.

I've smoked a pipe for about ten years, but have only recently
moved beyond the standard store bought 'Dr. Grabow' pipes. I'm
truly amazed at how much better a quality pipe draws and stays
lit. Speaking of staying lit, I've come to the conclusion that
the bigger the bowl the better. I have a new pipe with a bowl
that has roughly the volume of 1 1/2 golf balls, and it is a far
more pleasant smoke than any previous pipe I've had.

I'd like to close with a couple of conversations starters, refering
back to a couple of my comments above:

	1)  What is the general opinion of meershaum pipes?

	2)  Big bowls vs. little bowls.

[ Thanks for the word, Robert! Regarding your questions, I personally
don't like meerschaums, because of the delicacy you mentioned, and
also because the bits are too hard and don't chomp very well. I also
prefer big versus little bowls at different times, depending on my
mood. However, as they say in the TV editorials, we welcome opposing
viewpoints... -S. ]

Subject:  Question #1

My question revolves around the matter of opinions.  I have learned the pipe
smoking trade through the fairly traditional blue collar manner.  By this, I
mean that I learned upon "Dr. Garbow" pipes and "Sir Walter Raleigh Pipe
Tobacco".  I still use both predominately, and learned the "art" from the
similar experiences of my father and grandfather.  My questions are...

1)  What is the impression that the "elite" have of the Dr. Garbow line?
Is there an inherent loss of quality as compared with more pricey pipes?  Or,
perhaps is the value only that of greater "artistry" in the more
expensive pipes?

2)  Sir Walter Raliegh is an inexpensive tobacco that seems to be
different from "gourmet" brands mainly in the cut.  In SWR the cut
is like that of small squares, while the "gourmet" brands usually
have a more shag-rug apperance.  SWR seems to need less "tending" to than the
gourmet blends and seems heavier.  What are your impressions in comparing the
SWR brand with others?

[ Welcome to the group, Gary! I don't remember trying SWR (except in
ham radio .... ..), but it sounds like a "cube cut" tobak. Nothing
wrong with that, in and of itself. -S. ]

Subject: re: pipe smoking

     Awhile back you posted an article in sci.med about
pipe smokers living longer than non-smokers. I would
be interested to find out the source of that info, if
you still have any of the references. 
     Thanks for any help you might be able to give.

[ Richard is not a member, and I've tried to reply to him but the mail
bounced. The article he's referring to was, I believe, in
alt.folklore.urban. I have the text of the newspaper article on-line,
but parts of it violate the no-flames policy, so I won't post it here.
But I will mail it to any interested parties. Also, if anyone can
track down a good mail path to Richard, I'd appreciate the help. -S. ]

Steve,

Thanks for the dose of reality.  I'd forgotten how much of a pain
undergraduates can be.  I taught freshman English while I was
getting my MA in English.

I think what I miss is the independence and the loose schedule.
I definitely don't miss the low pay.  :-)

This is in response to your note on Pipes Digest.  _Cigar Aficionado_'s

      New York, NY 10157-0198

I have a copy of vol.1, no.1 which they sent to me free.  You might want to
request a sample copy.  I first saw mention of it in _Esquire_.  The cover
price is US$3.95 and well worth it.  It will be coming out quarterly and a

Subject: Another Michigan pipe shop

	I've found another Michigan pipe shop.  Between Rob Sweet and I,
we're going to make Michigan a Mecca for pipe smokers.  (-:

	In downtown Ann Arbor, there's a small row of shops known as
Nickel's Arcade, and there is found the Maison Edwards Tobaconist.
It's a pleasant little place, but with an excellent selection of
pipes, about 40 different kinds of tobacco, and a very friendly and
highly knowledgeable staff.  They also have a shelf of pre-owned
pipes, and they do repairs on pipes as well.
	I was there on Christmas Eve, picking out a last-minute present
for my brother, and I was a little surprised they were open.  I asked
for advice on both a pipe and a tobacco, and got a thorough
explanation of both.  I could have spent much more time there, but
unfortunately was in a bit of a hurry.
	The proprietor explained something I've never understood: why do
some pipes cost $20 and others cost several hundred?  He told me it
was a choice of wood, which I'd figured.  Further, though, he told me,
the better pipes are made from the denser wood near the center of the
tree, and the best come from the smoothest grained wood.  "Seconds"
are made from wood with knots in it, or from softer wood.  He showed
me the grains of some different pipes, and told me of pipes he'd seen
with holes burned through the side where a knot was present.
	I'll be back there, soon I hope.

I really enjoyed the story about the tobacco worm in the cigar that was told
in the 90th issue.

If you have the time, I (and perhaps others (unless you have already talked
about it)), would be interested in hearing more about the "tobacco tea"
experiment.

Thanks again for keeping me on the list.

[No problem, Gary! I'd like to keep everyone on the list, wherever
humanly possible. See next article for the Inside Story on Teabacco.

Subject: Tea, or another way _not_ to enjoy tobak...

At Gary's request, here's a report on the infamous Tobacco Tea
experiment. Warning: the following passage should be read only by
those with strong stomachs or lots of Pepto-Bismol...

When I was a freshman in college, I occasionally conducted strange
science experiments, mostly motivated by boredom. F'r instance, there
was the time I used an undershirt as a lampshade, nearly causing the
firetrucks to investigate... or tried to see how many pipes I could
keep alight at once (three)... Harmless, but wierd.

In any case, one dull night I looked at my coffeepot, then at a pouch
of Amphora, and a light bulb went on. (Fortunately, the T-shirt was
nowhere in evidence.) So I disemboweled a teabag, filled it with
tobak, stapled it back together, soaked it in boiling water, and
attempted to partake.

Ever gotten pipe juice on your tongue? That just about describes the
effect.  I believe I might have gotten two swallows down; I was
pretty, ah, ill for an hour or so afterward. I would not recommend the
practice.

On the other hand, when I was a little kid (talking 8-10 years old,
now, when tobacco was difficult and dangerous to obtain :-), I would
sometimes turn the tables, and smoke some tea in a pipe. (That's
Orange Pekoe, not what you're thinking. :) It wasn't a particularly
good smoke, but at least it didn't give me the spins. Did anyone else
ever do this, I wonder?

Moral of the story: _Drink_ the tea, _smoke_ the tobacco. Don't get
mixed up on this point! But, whatever you do,

				Smoke in peace,
				~\U Steve.

Subject: Smoke Shops

Since I grew up in the Boston area, I'm surprised that 
nobody has mentioned those bastions of pipe smoking:

David P. Ehrlich (Downtown Boston)

Leavitt &amp; Pierce (Harvard Square, affiliated with Ehrlich)

Peretti's  (Boston area. Two (?) stores.)

They have/had a very good mail order service. At least
they did the last time I checked. I used to know all
of Ehrlich's blends, and they seem to have a blend for
just about any taste, from mild cavendish and flavored
cavendish to burley to virginias and turkish and english
styles. I don't quite know what's in their "D.P.E.", 
but there seems to be a little bit of everything, and it
is a good smoke for people who want more than a
burley or cavendish. I used to buy blending tobaccos,
and experimented with burley and virginia bases with
some turkish or latakia or perique. Unless you're a
real dedicated pipe smoker it's easier to stick with
"known" blends. There's nothing as smooth as the
Dunhill or Balkan Sobranie blends, though some of the
"house" blends are quite nice, and a lot less expensive.
I used to like Ehrhich's "Number 68" blend a lot. (medium
English blend)

I wonder if people in the Boston area are subscribing to 
this group. Let me know if any are. I don't have the addresses
for the companies mentioned above, but I can look them up
in my files. I just moved from one side of the Bay to the
other, and I have to update my mail order catalog addresses.
I woudn't publish the commentary above since it's based on
non-recent recollections. O.K. to include it if you get
some info from Boston. I just got a job at U.C. Berkeley
( no, Berkeley hasn't banned outdoor smoking, (yet)) and
I am looking into the local scene. Still haven't found any
better than the mail order places, but it's hard to sample
from 3000 miles away. Unless you order a sampler, memory 
has to suffice. Whelan's is just off campus. I'll have to
sample their wares someday. Until then, I'll work on that
Sobranie.

[ Thanks for the mention, Art! I'd like to put them in the Resource
List; would appreciate the full addresses, if you (or anyone else) has
them. -S. ]

Subject: EPA antismoker ruling

Well, here we go again.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency this week classified
"environmental tobacco smoke" as a class 1 carcinogen, in the same
class as radon and asbesdos. This from the same government that
classifies marijuana as a schedule A narcotic (along with heroin and
crack), and once classified ketchup as a vegetable.

Now, I'm not in favor of making other folks uncomfortable, and do not
generally smoke where it would be objectionable to anybody. But the
EPA's risk assessment is faulty, and they know it. The only thing it
proves is that the EPA does not like smokers. Unfortunately, a lot of
people are going to believe it, and we can expect another wave of
tobacco-bashing and further restrictions.

In order to prevent some of that, I'm passing along the following
information. They show that most people voluntarily expose themselves
to risks a lot worse than smoke, every day of their lives. Please
circulate it wherever you feel it would do some good. And, at least
until the Government outlaws it,

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

asbesdos or radon, family history, diet, pollution, etc., each of
which can cause illenss."

					Gary Huber, M.D.
					Robert E. Brockie, M.D.
					Vijay Mahajan, M. D.
					_Consumers' Research_, July 1991, 74:7.

"Anyone who is mindful of the welter of really serious health and
environmental problems with which mankind is faced must be amazed, if
not disgusted, by the huge effort and resources that have been and are
being devoted to try and distinguish between 'a very low cancer risk'
and 'no' cancer risk, from ETS.

"Indeed, those who keep this pot boiling now may well be accused of
having got their priorities wrong and thereby delayed progress toward
solving much more serious problems."

Subject: Smoking article

Steve,

I would like you to email me a copy of your article on pipe smokers being
healthier than non-pipe smokers.  I just want to know for my own benifit.
I don't get on the soap box one way or the other on this issue.  I do
believe that secondary smoke is probably harmful to others (as well as myself)
and therefore choose not to smoke indoors (especially in my house with my
kids around).  At home, I usually reserve my smoking for the garage 
(actually a wood shop, a car has never lived there since I bought the house).
Commute times are my other most enjoyable smoking time.  I just wish I could
offer some same sort of environment control on other forms of air pollution
such as car exhaust.  Wouldn't it be nice if we could limit the exhaust to
the confines of the street?  Anyway,  send the article along if you will.

I hope the dissertation and all your fun are going well.  I fear for the
day when you will have to join the rest of us.

Norm

[ Thanks for the note, Norm, and 'scuze me if I've been getting a bit
too soapboxy lately. We pipe smokers should demonstrate that we are
considerate as we enjoy, and you do that amply well. Degree's going
fine; expect to defend in April. -S. ]

From: ???????@????????.???.?????????????.?? (Thomas Krausche)

Hello to all members of the pipes mailgroup !

Since I am new to this mailgroup, I will give you some information
about me and my interests in pipes and pipe smoking.

I Ave read about the Internet pipes mailgroup in the Pipe SmokerAs
Ephemeris, which I ordered after the reading of Rich Hackers excellent
"Ultimate Pipe Book". I am a graduate student at the Institute of
Theoretical Chemistry of the University of Tuebingen in Germany. In
our group, we are interested in the interactions of proteins with
water, and especially, the protein folding process.

I am a pipe smoker since I finished school, about ten years ago. I own
about 30 pipes of different manufacturers (Stanwell, Savinelli,
Brebbia, Peterson, Dunhill, ...). My favorite tobaccos are: Dunhill My
Mixture 965, CrownAs Achievement and Balkan Sobranie Smoking Mixture,
but because my wife doesnAt like their strong smell, I smoke LarsenAs
Premium pipe tobacco at home, and I am always looking for an english
mixture with a danish smell (suggestions are welcome !).

In recent years, I started to build a small collection of books about
pipe smoking, tobacco and related themes. Up to now I have only german
books, but I have contacted Ben Rapaport (Antiquarian Tobacciana) to
complete my collection with foreign language books.

I am also a member of the local pipe smokers club, the "Stuttgarter
Pfeifenfreunde B79". Our meetings take place every second friday in
the month.  If someone wants to join our meetings, feel free to
contact me.

ItBs an exciting experience to communicate with pipe smokers all over
the world. Please let me know, if somebody is more interested in
whatBs going on in the pipe smoking area in Germany.

Keep on smoking !

Cheerio Thomas.

[ Sounds great, Thomas! Hope some of our European and other members
will look up the Stuttgarter Pfeifenfreunde B79 (is that '79?) when in
the area.  -S. ]

Subject: Dr. Grabow and Medico Pipes

One frequent question which I noticed in the Internet pipes mailgroup
postings has to do with Dr. Grabow pipes.  Now, this may come as a shock to
those who only buy Savenilli Signatures, but Medico and Grabow do sell a
fairly decent pipe.  I know, you are thinking to yourself, "Oh no, I just
blew a $1000 note and I could have bought a Medico and a new used car."  If
one shops selectively, there are good quality Medico and Grabow pipes which
if properly broken in will taste just as good as a pipe made in Italy,
France, England, or Denmark.  I have a variety of moderately expensive pipes
in my collection, nothing outrageous, but fair stuff, and I still think that
one of the best pipes that I used to own was a filtered Medico which I had
while i was in the Air Force.  A college student or person in the service
should not waste their limited funds on a questionably expensive pipe.
Another alternative is Wiley Pipes of Florida, they make a good pipe for a
reasonable price.  All for now, i got to go,
       Neil

[ I found this on the Briar Patch BBS (313-340-0814), and copied it
here, given the interest people have in Dr. Grabows. -S. ]

	Is it possible to get back copies of the Pipes digest?  I have
issues #81 - 93, and would be interested in reading previous issues as
well.  Are these available for anonymous FTP?
	I really admire the style with which you run the digest.  I look
forward to receiving my copy each week, and invariably enjoy reading
it.  Thank you very much for offering it.  I hope you can keep it up
for a long, long time to come!

&gt; Now, this may come as a shock to
&gt; those who only buy Savenilli Signatures, but Medico and Grabow do sell a
&gt; fairly decent pipe.  

I should say so!  There'll be no bad-mouthing Dr. Grabows in this list, not
if I have anything to say about it.  A Dr. Grabow pipe saved the life of 
one of my ancestors.  

It was my great-uncle, Zachariah Thacker.  Uncle Zack was an impetuous
young man, so when American announced its entry into the World War (which
is what they called World War I at the time; obviously, WWII hadn't
happened yet.  If it had, then it wouldn't have been WWII, eh?) he
immediately volunteered.

I'd love to tell you the whole story about how he managed to pass the
medical despite the fact that a childhood accident with a threshing machine
had left his left leg some four inches shorter than his right.  But this
is the Pipe Digest, so I'll stick to the point, which is that just before
he shipped out his fiance' presented him with a Dr. Grabow filter-stem and
two ounces of Tinder Box Anniversary blend(*).  She teased that the horrid
cherry stench ought to chase those perfume-drenched French girls away from
him. 8-)

	(*) It's a little-known fact that The Tinder Box hasn't produced its 
	Anniversary blend since 1909.  There were bumper crops of tobacco
	and cherries that year, so they mixed up "a batch," and have been
	selling it ever since.  

As you might imagine, Uncle Zack was none too fond of mechanical equipment.
It was therefore inevitable that he would be assigned to the newly-formed
Tank Corps,   After a few weeks of training, he was given the job of
driving one of the new French-built Renault FT-17's, a two-man light tank
carrying a small cannon.  Of course at this point in the war there were no
Americans with tank experience, so the Army decided that, for their first
battle, the new tankers should be accompanied by veteran French tank
soldiers.  My uncle was paired up with Lt. Jacques Aulantirn, who knew the
Renault inside and out, in addition to being a skilled tank commander and 
a clever tactician.  Unfortunately, Jacques spoke no English, and Uncle
Zack knew no French.

Still, they learned to communicate after a fashion, and soon gained a
reputation as the best tank crew in the unit.  It sort of happened by
accident; Uncle Zack's short left foot kept slipping off the left clutch 
when the tank would hit a bump, so the tank would swerve to the right.  His
tank would thus zig-zag across rough ground; the rest of the unit though 
this was a carefully-practiced evasive maneuver!  

Finally, the day came when Uncle Zack's unit was sent forward to help
press the attack on Soissons. Just before noon my uncle's unit rolled 
forward into the attack.  At first, progress was good, but soon the German
artillery began to take a toll on Uncle Zack's battalion; by two o'clock only
a third of the tanks were still advancing.  It was at that point that fate
stepped in.  

The French decided to support the attack with gas shells, hoping to catch
the Germans unprepared.  An inopportune change in the wind brought that gas
back toward the Allied lines, and the tanks drove straight into it.
Jacques saw the cloud and knew what it meant; he immediately shouted
"Gasse!" to Uncle Zack and began frantically donning his gas mask.

Battle is chaos, and for inexperienced soldiers, it's an exercise in
confusion.  Who can blame Uncle Zack, then, for assuming that Jacques meant
for him to "hit the gas"?  With the accelerator set wide open, Uncle Zack
careened headlong (with an occasional jolt to the right) into that fog of
death.

The first whiff of gas told my uncle he'd made a mistake, but he thought
quickly.  He knew he'd never be able to put on his gas mask in time; he had
only a few seconds to act.  Instead, he pulled out his Dr. Grabow, which
he'd already packed with tobacco in anticipation of a victory smoke after
the battle.  Clamping it fiercely between his teeth, he breathed in through
the pipe!  And as luck would have it, the combination of the heavy chemical
content of the Anniversary blend and the filter in the pipe stem
counteracted the deadly gas. Uncle Zack made it through, shaken but
alive, with the pipe jutting proudly from his mouth!

Needless to say, he kept that Dr. Grabow handy for the rest of the war;
indeed, it was his constant companion until his untimely death in a freak
sewing machine accident.  They buried that pipe with him.  They had to, 
really, because it was stitched to his hand.

&gt; Bill, you're utterly deranged.

Thanks, and same to you!  8-)

I dunno... I have this image of pipe smoking linked to telling stories; a
bunch of guys sitting around a fireplace, smoking pipes and drinking
&lt;beverage of choice&gt;, reminiscing about bygone days and swapping tall
tales.  The digest gets kind of dry when we just talk about smoking, and
this is my way of livening it up a bit.  (I keep hoping that it'll catch on
with other people...)


I realize these stories get a bit long sometimes, and maybe I'm the only
person who thinks they're amusing.  If I get out of control, just let me
know.

Hello Steve,

I am quiet interested in having the back issues. I joining at number
81, so if it is possible I would like to have all earlier messages (or
is that a problem).

Furthermore, is it not possible to have a ftp server somewhere? Is it
not possible to join that ftp server with for instance the
sierra.stanfort.edu (used by HBD-digest)?

Thanks for sending the back issues.

All the best en keep up the good work!

Victor

[ No problem with the back issues, Victor! Actually, setting up an FTP
area would be slightly problematic, and I'm happy to mail out the back
issues as I get requests for them. -S. ]

       There is now an area in Files which contains more of the popular
Internet  pipe mail.  This area is called the Pipe file area.
       The next issue of the A&amp;M Gazette will go out some time in late
February or early March.  I have a pile of photographs from the Los Angles
pipe show which was held in October.  I will use as many of them as
possible.
       The michigan regional pipe smoking contest will be in mid-march.
As soon as the date is pinned down, I will post a note.  All pipe smokers
are welcome to participate.

Subject: Pipes and Internet

       Steve, thanks for the disk.  As you can see  we are getting them
loaded into the bbs.
       One of the folks asked about pipe shops in michigan.  Of course,
Paul's Pipe shop is probably the largest and best in michigan, if not the
country.  I travel the country on business and trust me, not many compare.
The next shop, nearly as good, is Humidor 1 in Southfield, mi.  It is a
suburb of Detroit.  Good selection of tobacco, cigars, and in excess of
10,000 pipes in inventory.......of course Paul probably has twenty times
that number.  I just bought a pre-transition Peterson system pipe 307 from
Humidor 1, a great pipe.  He probably has a hundred peterson's alone.
       Anyway, thanks for the disk.
       Take care,
               Neil Murray

I just wanted to offer my own special story to the pipe group.  Just
to underline the importance of keeping that pipe with you at all times.

Norm
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

You know guys,

Bill Thacker's story about his great-unclebeing saved by his trusty Dr.
Grabow pipe reminds me of our family story about my great great
Uncle Randolph of the Yukon.

Randolph was one of the first people to try and settle the Alaska
territory.  He would often roam around the wilderness for months
mapping out the region, just his dog sled and him.  It is a little
known fact that the well known sledding command 'MUSH' was attributed
to Randolph.  When driving the sled,  he was unable to smoke his pipe
(needing both hands free at all times for the job of driving).  He
still needed nicotine in his system though,  so he opted to chew
tobacco whenever working the sled.  One day as he left the trading post
he started his team after putting an unusually large plug of tobacco in
his mouth.  When he shouted to his dogs to 'MOVE IT' he mangled the
words so bad because of the plug,  it came out 'MOOOOSHT'.  The other
sled drivers saw with great wonder how Randolph's team pulled with such
force that they all soon began to use the same command.  After a
while,  'MUSH' was the common command to use for starting a sled team.

Anyway,  it was on one cold winter day that Randolf was in the extreme
North of the territory.  It had been so cold that he had not seen
another living thing (besides his sled dogs) for days.  He was running
low on rations and was heartbroken over the thought of having to skin
and eat one of his dogs.

He had hoped he could reach an outpost in two days time,  if they all
were at their peak,  but the dogs had run out of food two days before,
and they were moving rather slow.  Yet,  Randolph pressed on.  He would
not give up.  He had just completed mapping the Northern sector and
people were counting on him to deliver his map.

Mile after mile slipped by ever so slowly.  Randolph and his sled were
moving slower by the hour.  Just when they were 5 miles from the
outpost, Randolph noticed that one of his dogs was not pulling any
longer.  He stopped the sled and stepped forward to see what was wrong
with the dog.  The poor animal had froze solid right there on the run.
Randolph sat down in the snow next to the dog took out his pipe so that
he could ponder the situation.  Unfortunately this turned out to be a
hazardous error on Randolph's part because as he removed the plug of
chewing tobacco from his mouth,  another dog froze right there on the
spot.

Things were getting a little bleak right now.  Randolph could not get
very far,  being two dogs down,  and he needed to think out his
survival options.  He pulled his pouch from under his jacket and as he
started to load his pipe, plop,  another dog froze and fell on his
side.  

At this point,  Randolph noticed how really cold it was outside.

His pipe full of tobacco and dogs freezing all around him,  there was
only one thing for Randolph to do,  he struck a match.  He placed the
lit match to the tobacco in his pipe and started to draw air through
the pipe.  No smoke!  He looked a little more carefully, adjusted the
match,  and drew more air throught the pipe.  Still he could not get
the darn thing to light.  Randolph shook his hand in order to put out
the match so that he might be able to adjust the packing of his pipe,
but the match stayed lit!  Taking off the glove on his left hand,
Randolph waved his hand over the match, no heat!  He put his finger
into the flame and found that the fire had frozen solid.

Randolph could not remember a time when it had been this cold.

Taking off his glove was the second mistake Randolph had made that
day.  The insulation barrier being broken between his body and the
cold,   Randolph soon found himself unable to move,  he was being
frozen just like his dog team.

Randolph would probably have died right there and not been found until
the Spring had it not been for the fact that he had sat down to smoke
his pipe.  Lighting that match had saved his life.  It seems that the
outpost,  which was only five miles away,  noticed a light in the
distance every night.  After three days,  they decided to send a search
party out to find out what was the source of the light.  When the
search party got to the light,  they found Randolph, frozen, sitting in
the midst of his frozen dogs holding the lit match in his hand.  The
flame was still frozen and sending out that life saving beacon of light.

They piled Randolph and the dogs onto another sled, and quickly got
them back to the outpost.  Some ingenious soul thought to try putting
Randolph into a hot bath to thaw him out enough to fit into a pine
box.  After soaking for an hour in the bath,  Randolph let out a scream
and started cussing a blue streak.  Seems that when they put him in the
bath, they didn't take his pouch from him and had ruined 3 ounces of
Cavendish (besides,  Randolph wasn't due for a bath for a month).

Well,  the people of the outpost were able to save all but two of
Randolph's sled team and Randolph suffered no ill effects of the freeze
(except for the loss of his tobacco which the owner of the post
replaced since Randolph was often a very good customer,  and they HAD
given him a bath prematurely.)

As for the match,  they put it in a glass case and kept it outside in
the middle of the outpost and it served as a light for the rest of the
Winter,  until Spring,  when the flame unthawed,  the match burned out.
Randolph was right on hand at that moment.  Not wanting to waste a
match,  he lit his pipe.

		 Pipes Digest #96 - February 14, 1993

Well, happy Valentine's Day to all, and welcome to new members:


	J. Fulper (?)		(?.??????@?????.????.???)
	Charles Myers		(???????@???????.?????.???)

And, in honor of Valentine's Day, I'll post the following poem by
Rudyard Kipling. If nothing else, it shows that people have been
conflicted about tobak, and love, for a long time. (Yes, I know it's
sexist, but after all, Kipling was writing for a male audience nearly
110 years ago. For the [too-few] women reading this list, I might
suggest that you swap the gender of the terms, and poke fun at those
misguided males who don't appreciate a good cigar. Another alternative
would be to gender-neutralize the poem, e.g., "a Yuppie is only a
Yuppie..."  The thump-thump-thump you hear is Kipling spinning in his
grave :-) Enjoy!  -S.

			    THE BETROTHED
			  by Rudyard Kipling

	    'You must choose between me and your cigar' -
		*Breach of Promise Case, circa* 1885.


Open the old cigar-box, get me a Cuba stout,
For things are running crossways, and Maggie and I are out.

We quarrelled about Havanas - we fought o'er a good cheroot,
And *I* know she is exacting, and she says I am a brute.

Open the old cigar-box - let me consider a space;
In the soft blue veil of the vapour musing on Maggie's face.

Maggie is pretty to look at - Maggie's a loving lass,
But the prettiest cheeks must wrinkle, the truest of loves must pass.

There's peace in a Larranaga, there's calm in a Henry Clay;
But the best cigar in an hour is finished and thrown away -

Thrown away for another as perfect and ripe and brown -
But I could not throw away Maggie for fear o' the talk o' the town!

Maggie, my wife at fifty - grey and dour and old -
With never another Maggie to purchase for love or gold!

And the light of Days that have Been the dark of the Days that Are,
And Love's torch stinking and stale, like the butt of a dead cigar -

The butt of a dead cigar you are bound to keep in you pocket -
With never a new one to light tho' it's charred and black to the socket!

Open the old cigar-box - let me consider a while.
Here is a mild Manila - there is a wifely smile.

Which is the better portion - bondage bought with a ring,
Or a harem of dusky beauties, fifty tied with a string?

Counsellors cunning and silent - comforters true and tried,
And never a one of the fifty to sneer at a rival bride?

Thought in the early morning, solace in time of woes,
Peace in the hush of the twilight, balm ere my eyelids close,

This will the fifty give me, asking nought in return,
With only a *Suttee's* passion - to do their duty and burn.

This will the fifty give me. When they are spent and dead,
Five times other fifties shall be my servants instead.

The furrows of far-off Java, the isles of the Spanish Main,
When they hear my harem is empty will send me my brides again.

I will take no heed to their raiment, nor food for their mouths withal,
So long as the gulls are nesting, so long as the showers fall.

I will scent 'em with best vanilla, with tea will I temper their hides,
And the Moor and the Mormon shall envy who read of the tale of my brides.

For Maggie has written a letter to give me my choice between
The wee Little whimpering Love and the great god Nick o'Teen.

And I have been servant of Love for barely a twelvemonth clear,
But I have been Priest of Cabanas a matter of seven year;

And the gloom of my bachelor days is flecked with the cheery light
Of stumps that I burned to Friendship and Pleasure and Work and Fight.

And I turn my eyes to the future that Maggie and I must prove,
But the only light on the marshes is the Will-o'-the-Wisp of Love.

Will it see me safe through my journey or leave me bogged in the mire?
Since a puff of tobacco can cloud it, shall I follow the fitful fire?

Open the old cigar-box - let me consider anew -
Old friends, and who is Maggie that I should abandon *you*?

A million surplus Maggies are willing to bear the yoke;
And a woman is just a woman, but a good Cigar is a Smoke.

Light me another Cuba - I hold to my first sworn vows.
If Maggie will have no rival, I'll have no Maggie for Spouse!

Hello Steve,

in digest#94 you wrote about the possibility to get back issues of the 
Pipes Digest. I have joined the mailgroup with number 92, and would
like to have the previous issues of the digest as well. 

Last week I have been in Istanbul, also known as the gate to orient. 
I wanted to take the opportunity and smoke a water pipe (Nargileh)
somewhere in a turkish coffeehouse. Believe it or not, we could not
find a location where to smoke a nargileh!! Even in the big oriental 
bazar nobody seems to know where we could smoke a water pipe in
Istanbul.
Therefore, I buyed a nargileh by myself, together with 500g tobacco
(called tombak or tombeky). Because I need some charcoal for smoking, 
I have to wait for the next barbecue party in summer, before I can 
test the nargileh.
Does anybody have some experience with water pipes ? 
 
Keep on smoking !

Cheerio Thomas.

[ Issues sent. Personally, I have no experience with water pipes that
involved tobacco :-) But have been interested for some time in the
concept. Any others? -S. ]

        I saw mention of your group in the Coterie collectors directory.
        I have been a pipe smoker for a number of years and I am
        considering doing some collecting.  I just purchased an older
        GBD bent bulldog in the original box.  How can I determine its
        age and value. I am chales Myers, the science Librarian at 
        Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster PA...home of 
        the oldest tobacco store in the US...Demuths Pipe Shop...sadly
        disappointing.

[ My suggestions would be to take it to a pipe show and see what you
can get for it; there are shows coming up in New York in March,
Washington DC in May. As far as I know, there is no established price
guide for pipes. Any other ideas? And thanks for joining us! -S. ]

  OFFICE MEMO          Network stuff, Orlando, Cuba...        Date:2/11/93
Hi -
   First of all, I was wondering if I am still on the list, under my "username
du jour", ?????.??????@????.???.  I haven't received any digests for a while. 
The net config has changed here several times in the last two weeks, and I
think we're finally done!
Now for the serious stuff...
   I will be in Orlando for a couple of days later this month, and I was
wondering if anyone could recommend one or two "really neat" pipe shops to
visit - there aren't any listed in the resource guide I have.  Also, is it
still illegal to buy Cuban cigars in the US?  I thought I had heard that the
ban had been lifted.
     Thanks,

Subject: marvelous these 'old' digets

Hello Steve,

Thanks for sending the 'old' digets. It was good to read them (and
I will reread then sometime). Certainly the articles from Bill and
Norm about (the growing of) tabacco. It is really good to have such
'story' tellers in our mids (and I mean story teller in the righ
sense, Norm;-).
I hope indeed that people will continue that, perhaps if I get the
atmosphere of putting something on paper, I will certainly do that.

I am still wondering if it is posible to try to describe a smoke by
means of some pre-defined terms. I certainly am aware that it will
NEVER be possible to fully describe the atmosphere of enjoyment of
a smoke, but it is always good to be able to tell people what they
can expect. At this moment that is quiet difficult, and I think
that is because of lack of defined terms. If that is true, I would
like to start some discussion with you about this. I read some books
(concerning cigars, so perhaps it is different for pipes), and I
came acrose some tables of terms. I will compose that list and you
will see it. 
One thing I already know, is that is seems very difficult to
describe all the terms assosiated with bruns/smoke/fire. It seems
as if we are afraid of it;-)

All the best and keep up story telling!

Victor

Hi, Victor,

Here's a chart I found in the _Pipe Smoker's Ephemeris_ for
Winter-Autumn 1974.

Comment


_____________________________________________________________________________

Also, Brian Morgan asked last week about pipe shops near Orlando. Here
is the only Florida pipe shop listed in the two most recent issues of
the _Ephemeris_:

	Jim's Pipe and Tobacco Shop
	2812-C West 23rd St.
	Panama City, FL

Recommended, but I don't know if the geography is right for a trip
from Orlando. In any case, enjoy the trip, and

				Smoke in peace,

I must say, that with all the snow afalling, I feel the right and
proper Gentle-Hobbit, what with getting this most enjoyable
newsletter.  Reading is a delight, and watching the snow flakes lazily
drift, my thoughts turned to an interesting matter: What would be a
good choice for and outdoor, or porch fill while the snow falls?  With
the wood-burning scent of fireplaces, and the coolness of the flakes,
a nice churchwarden, some sweetrolls, a fine red, and some deer
grazing make perfect compliments like and unto themselves and each
other; yet what would be a good fill for such a day as one which
inspired Robert Frost?

THANKS FOR THE PROMPT RESPONSE. I WOULD APPRECIATE SUGGESTIONS FROM YOU OR THE
MEMBERS OF THE MAILGROUP HOW TO SELL THESE FINE PIPES. I HAVE NO WAY OF
ESTIMATING THEIR VALUE. FIRST I HAVE TO CREATE AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION. ASIDE
FROM DUNHILL, THERE ARE ONLY TWO PIPE SHOPS LEFT IN SAN FRANCISCO, AND THEY DO
NOT HANDLE CONSIGNMENTS. WHAT REFERENCE WORK SHOULD I CONSULT IN ORDER TO
DESCRIBE THE PIPES? THANKS FOR YOUR ADVICE.

[ I've pointed Oliver toward the Bay Area Pipe Club and Hacker's and
Ehwa's books, and invited him to advertise in this group. Any other
ideas? -S. ]

Subject: Interesting thought...

In the past few years (decades), more and more concern has been given to the
dangerous effects of pesticides in our food.  I was wondering if anyone has
given thought or perhaps grown their own pipe tobacco amongst the members.
I understand that tobacco is a relatively difficult and specialized crop to
grow, and was interested in hearing if any of you have tried it in your
personal gardens at home.  If so, how did your effort turn out?  And, how
did you feel the overall quality was?

From: ????????????????????? (Jon E. Schneider)
Subject: Pipes

    Thanks for signing me up so quickly. I'm new to the net, so
please let me know if I'm addressing my messages wrong, or if I'm
violating network etiquette.

    I'm 40 years old and a father of three boys. I am a supervisor
at a local (El Paso, Tx) oil refinery, and before that I was a
Sgt. with the local Police Department. My wife and I joined the
Police Department at the same time, and she is still with them
(going on 18 years).

    I only recently took up pipe smoking, at my doctors
suggestion. I was a 3 pack a day cigarette smoker before that.
Needless to say, I am glad I switched. I also enjoy a cigar from
time to time.

    I'm starting to collect pipes, and am currently up to 25
medium grade pipes. I have one Dunhill, but on the average I
purchase something in the 50 to 100 dollar range. So far I seem to
prefer Stanwells, Charatens, and Nordings.

    The estate pipe market is something that I would like to get
into, but I currently have no contacts. We only have one pipe store
in town, and they don't have a very interesting collection.

    Whenever I travel, the first place I visit is the local
tobbaconists. My favorites so far have been Stag Tobaconists and
Ford&Haig Tobacconists in Phoenix, and R.J. Clarke in Vancouver,
B.C.

    I will be going to Birmingham and Montgomery Alabama, and
Atlanta Georgia next month, and would appreciate any advise on
where I could find a good tobacconist there.

    I am also interested in buying any issues of Pipe Lovers
Magazine. I've never seen one, and would like to read any old
issues. It seems that not much is written anymore about pipe
smoking and collecting.

                                    Jon
                                     
[ Hope some of our members can help you with Birmingham and Atlanta,
Jon! And welcome to the group. -S. ]

We have now reached the century mark! Please excuse the delay between

BTW, check out alt.fan.rumpole, a newsgroup I created not too long

Subject: Smokin' Homegrown

Gary asked about raising tobacco at home:

&gt; I understand that tobacco is a relatively difficult and specialized crop to
&gt; grow, and was interested in hearing if any of you have tried it in your
&gt; personal gardens at home. 

(Gee, I *told* you he asked about growing tobacco at home... you should've
taken my word for it! 8-)

Given that a person lived in the proper climactic zone, it's possible.
Gary, for example, is from "msu".  If that's Missouri State, no problem.
If it's Minnesota State, I think he can give up now.

You could grow tobacco at home without pesticides (you'd want to to
fertilize, but those are Good Chemicals, not Bad Chemicals).  Tobacco is
very sensitive to the soil it's grown in, though; if you want Virginia
leaf, you've got to grow it in Virginia.  (That's why Cuban cigars still
have that mystique.  Cuban Seed Leaf tobacco can be (and is) grown in
Honduras, but it doesn't taste the same.)

As for how to actually grow tobacco... well, I wrote a long, dull article
on exactly that a year or more ago on this very digest.  (Is this puppy
archived?)  I didn't keep a copy myself, as I already knew how to do it.

Assuming that you raised the tobacco, cured it, and stripped it, you'd next
need to clean it and (unless you just want plain "tobacco" flavor) season
it.  Couldn't tell you how to do either.  Then you've got to cut it, which
probably isn't a big deal.

In the final analysis, I would suggest that the chemicals used in growing 
the tobacco are probably less of a concern than those naturally in the
tobacco (e.g., tars) and those used to flavor certain tobaccos (e.g., rum)
(which is not to say that burning rum is a health hazard.) (Well, not the
fumes, anyway.)

Oh, and BTW; tobacco farming is a regulated industry.  Each farmer receives
a "base," a limit to how many acres they can grow.  I called the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (geez, what a fun place that must be to
work!  Somebody let me know when they get responsibility for Fast Cars and
Pizza, OK?) and the agent there assured me that it is legal to grow tobacco
for your own consumption; selling it, on the other hand, would be illegal.

Subject: Back Issues

   Hi Steve, I have enjoyed the last few issues of The Digest very much!
Please e-mail to me the back issues (before #95 I think).
   As for tobacconist in the Atlanta area I can recommend the following:
         Royal Cigar Co. - 1776 Peachtree St. NE - (404) 876-9422

         Edward's Pipe and Tobacco - 444 N. Indian Creek Dr.
-(404)292-1721.
   The former was an Atlanta landmark before the store was moved out of
downtown proper. Edward's is also a good place to get a smoke.
                    -Thanks Much-

Subject: New Member and a few questions

        Hi all.  I am one of those on and off smokers.  I have smoked pipes
from time to time.  I joined the group and within a few minutes of joining
called several of the sources for pipe items.  

        I have a few questions for anyone out there.  I am a Civil War
reenactor, I haven't been to my first real event yet, but I am learning as
much as I can so that I can portray an authentic 'impression' as a Civil
War soldier in the 1990's.  
        A reenactor friend of mine who I owe the world to for introducing
me to the authentic side of the hobby and who has provided valuable
guidance is a pipe smoker.  I gained some interest and he gave me a quick
reference as to how pipes were made.  I did a little more research and
found out some more details on handmade pipes (quick pipes made by soldiers
when they could not buy one) of soldiers.

        I have a box of wood coming so I can experiement with making these
homemade pipes.  My question to pose is this:  are any of you out there
carvers or makers of pipes?  If so, how can I find out more on pipes of the
19th century?  I am more interested in the common wood pipe and not clay
pipes.  I have seen many fancy pictures of carved pipes used by officers
that were cherry and very fancy.  Overall, my goal is to learn as much as I
can about making pipes.  I have never made a pipe, but have smoked many. 
Can anyone point me in the correct direction? (resources)

Thanks

Ted

[ Norm carves some, but as far as I know nobody is a specialist in
19th century reproductions. I could recommend "A Complete Guide to
Collecting Antique Pipes" by Ben Rappaport (ISBN 0-916838-22-6) as a
source of ideas for you. Also see Pimo's in the Resource Guide. -S. ]

Steve,

Thanks!  My roommate, who is a young-ish looking 25 years old, is part 
of a small but determined group trying to start a club/newsletter for 
pipe smokers under the age of roughly 30-35.  So far they've produced 
two issues but (in our case) time is at such a premium lately  the 
production schedule has slipped a great deal!

Anyway, thanks again for the back issues!  Good luck with the studies . 
. .  I had a friend at San Jose State that used to say there wasn't 
anything you could study that couldn't be made easier with a pipe!

Subject: Help me identify a pipe


Howdy all,

I have enjoyed reading the pipe digest and now wish to contribute.  
Unfortunately my contribution is not that of a whimsical antidote,
or receipe for growing tobacco, but a question.

I have only started to 'dabble' in the wonderful world of pipes and
their 'toys'.  My father gave me a pipe a few months ago.  I would
like to know if it is a decent brand of pipe or just a regular everyday
pipe that he figured would be fine to get me going.  I don't see my
father all that often lately and I don't want to just come out and
ask him about the pipe.  Well.. onto the specifics.  The pipe has
the words "Buts-Choquin VERSAILLES" (well thats what I could make of it)
pressed into the wood grain stem.  And on the mouth piece the letters
"BC" are etched.

I am very anxious to read your responses.

Roll Tide,
Rod

Monica should contact the Museum of the American Indian in NYC (a branch of
the Smithsonian) or the Smithsonian itself in DC.
 
On another topic, have any of your cigar smoking members heard of J R
Tobacco in North Carolina? Can save a bundle on cigars. For a catalog, call
1-800-J-R-CIGAR. Interesting place to visit (right on I95) with bargains in
remaindered books by the hundreds of titles, huge cigar inventory (obscure
ones tend to be a bit dried out), cut rate brand name cosmetics, some pipes
and lots of the commercial packaged pipe tobaccos. I buy my cigars from
there and my tobacco (Riverboat, a Danish blend cavendish-cut burley; mild
aromatic, women seem to love having me around with it &lt;g&gt;) and pipes from
the Tabagerie, Westport CT on US 1 between I95 exits 17-18 (closer to 18,
head south on US 1 from the exit, in shops across from Ed Mitchell's
clothing). If you stop in, tell Tony I sent you and be sure to check out his
estate pipes.

Subject: European pipe tobaccos

Hello everyone,

Since this mailing list is fairly American I would like to know if
there are many European pipe tobaccos sold in the US. For instance
tobaccos like MacBaren(Dani sh), Dunhill(British) or tobaccos in the
Amphora collection(Dutch). I wonder if the Dutch tobaccos are known at
all outside Europe. Question number two: if you know any Dutch
tobaccos, do you enjoy them? Or Danish (like Alsbo Gold).

Enjoy your pipes,

Niek.

[ Dunhill, MacBaren, and Amphora tobaccos are all widely sold, and
enjoyed, in the US. Don't know about other Dutch tobak. And thanks for
the word - we will enjoy our pipes! -S. ]

Subject:      Pipe shop in Prague

Hi everybody,

if you have a trip to Prague, Czech Republic (special note for american
subscribers: that's in Europe :-) you should check out this shop:

Kralovstvi Dymek
Stepanska 19
110 00 Praha 1, tel. (02) 295873

Oh, the former USSR has a rich history when it comes to pipe smoking!  I'm
glad for the opportunity to expound a bit!

Of course, the pipe was invented in Russia, in 1554.  They didn't become
popular, however, for over 100 years (when tobacco began to arrive from the
British colonies of North America).

For decades, only the wealthy could afford to smoke the imported Virginia
leaf, but in 1768 farmers in southern Russia began to successfully
cultivate the plant.  It soon became widely grown through the regions we
know as Azerbaijan, Soviet Georgia, and Soviet Tennessee.  Pipe smoking
became a national hobby, and it was considered nekulturny to have tea
without a smoke.

This affluence attracted the interest of Russia's neighbors.  In 1812, a
jealous Napoleon sent his armies into Russia to plunder tobacco stores.  At
the Tsar's orders, a "scorched earth" policy was implemented; the Russians
would send their tobacco up in smoke rather than allow it to be taken by
the French!  Sadly, the furnace-like tobacco fires spread, destroying
millions of acres of farmland and villages.  (It is said that the odor of
gunpowder and Perique are still noticeable at the Borodino memorial.)

The Pyrrhic victory sent the Russian smoking industry into a virtual dark
age.  Domestic production had all but ceased with the loss of the 1812
crop, and the high cost of imported tobacco led to unrest among the
peasants.  The situation was kept in check only by the harshest repressive
measures, until finally, in 1917, the dam burst.

The new Communist government quickly implented a five-year plan which
called for huge increases in tobacco production and established "Peoples 
Pipe Works" at key points around the nation.  The most important were 
located at Bryaransk (sometimes nicknamed "Pipograd") and Merzhomsk. 
Typical of a planned economy, only a limited selection of rather 
unimaginative designs were available.  For example, in 1937 the Red October
Pipe Works in Bryaransk introduced the "V.I.Lenin,Hero of the Soviet People
Commemorative Pipe No.17."  The "Sporty 17", as it was known, weighed over
14 ounces empty, and held over an ounce of tobacco.  Constructed of oak, it
was rough-hewn and unfinished, and could not be disassembled for cleaning.
It was, however, remarkably durable, and could be filled with charcoal for
outdoor cooking.  

During the Great Patriotic War, the Soviets attempted to convert pipe
production to less strategically-valuable materials.  Experiments with
alternatives, including steel, cement, and unseasoned pine led to repeated
failures (and no few fatalities).  Pipes from this era are extremely
valuable; should you come into possession of one, do not smoke it, leave it
in its factory cosmoline coating!

In 1943, however, the Kalabashnikov Design Bureau in Leningrad succeeded in
creating a new pipe, which could be rapidly fired and was auto-loading.  
The pipe could be produced in almost any machine shop using mild steel 
stampings and leftover sawdust.  It was a major factor in preserving morale
during the seige of that heroic city, and its production soon spread across
the USSR. By the end of the war, over 70 million "Aromat Kalabashnikova
M.1943", or AK-43's, had been produced.  

Pipes played a vital role in the defeat of Nazi Germany. Hitler, you may be
aware, was a vehement anti-smoker, having vowed to annex the USSR for 
"breathensraum."   The turning point of the war, the German defeat at 
Stalingrad, can be traced to Hitler's order that his troops hold their 
ground to allow time for the destruction of the vital meerschaum mines 
there.  

After the war, the Soviet tobacco industry continued to grow.  By the 
1950's, the USSR was ready for a tobacco war with the United States,
embargoing the import of our crops.  The USA responded, naturally enough,
with a blockade of Cuban cigars, which to this day cannot be imported.    
The "Cold War" (so called because of the many empty pipe bowls which
resulted) continued for decades, until the SALT (Strategic Aromatics and
Latakia Treaty) accords became the first step toward international
friendship.


As you can see, pipes are an integral part of Russian history.  They should
be treated reverently, like a religous icon or a bottle of vodka.  And
remember the old Byelorussian proverb: "No man is a stranger who has once
smoked your pipe or painted your ox-cart."

Well, it loses something in translation.

           A pipe gives a thinking man time to think and 
              a fool something to stick in his mouth.

[ And don't forget that Joseph Stalin, famous world-class heavyweight
despotic tyrant and trendsetter in '70s mustache styles, was also a
pipe devotee!  And so was Alger Hiss, famous State Department spy, so
named for his trademark heavy buildup of goo and subsequent
sussurating noises!  AND Robert Oppenheimer, atom-bomb genius deposed
by HUAC (the House Un-Aromatic Censors, led by the infamous
Representative Joe "the only GOOD Comoy is a DEAD Comoy" McCarthy!)
And Nixon was a pipe smoker, too - I bet he was in on it, somewhere!
Coincidence...  or conspiracy?

On second thought, _do_ forget Stalin... -S. ]

Subject: Lifestyle changes and Sherlockiana

Well, your moderator finally did it.

That's the reason this Digest is so late.

On Friday, April 16, between the hours of 2:00 PM and 4:30 PM, Yours
Truly was subjected to intense scrutiny by a select panel of five
inquisitioners. The object was to justify whether the last four years
of his life had resulted in anything meaningful.

Well, I dunno, still. But the practical results were that I get to
tack three letters and two punctuation marks after my last name, and
have become a Luxury Property in the employment market.

In other words, I defended my thesis. I graduated. I GOT OUT! YAY!!!!

And It's "Doctor Masticola" now. For purposes of our discussion here,
I look upon it as following in the steps of Dr. Grabow.

To celebrate, I went out and bought myself a "Baskerville" from
Peterson's "Sherlock Holmes" series. (Found it at John David;
bargained the owner down to $130.) Still haven't smoked it yet;
that'll wait until I have my own place, which will definitely be an
antismoker-free environment. :-)

Thanks to all on the Pipes Mailgroup for your support, encouragement,
and friendship. My status as moderator won't change, at least not
immediately, but my mailing address may have to move at some point.
I'll keep you posted.

For now, join me in lighting a professorial pipe, and until next time,

					Smoke in peace,

					~\U Steve.

Cavendish:              A variety of pipe tobacco that is reputed to produce
                        remarkably clear thought processes, and thereby leads
                        to major scientific discoveries; hence, the name of a 
                        British research laboratory where the tobacco is 
                        smoked in abundance.

From: ??????@?????.??? (David Chesler)
Subject: Resources, Teabacco

  Thanks for putting me back on the list after I fell off!
 
  Here are addresses for the Boston tobacconists as requested some issues back:

         Leavitt &amp; Pierce     established 1883
         1316 Massachusetts Avenue
         Cambridge, Mass 02138
         617-547-0576
             Prices as of 6/4/93: Balkan Sobranie pipe tobacco, pouch, $4.20
                                  Turkish Special cigarettes, regular, $3.00

         David P. Ehrlich Co.   Tobacconist since 1868
         32 Tremont Street
         Boston, Mass  02108
         617-227-1720

      The packages of Turkish Special now are imported by Andros, not
G. Georgopolous (48 Stone St, NYC).  According to a salesman at Nat Sherman
one or both elder Georgopolous brothers died, and the business is no longer.
Georgopolous used to make the cigarettes for Sherman in its factory, an old
building in the shadow of Manufacturers Hanover Plaza in the financial
district of lower Manhattan.

         I was looking for a blend my late grandfather-in-law used to smoke
(trying to generate remembrances of things past for my new wife), and the
Perkins Tobacco Co. is still around southwest of Boston, but I don't have
their number handy.  He used to smoke a numbered blend, but now my wife
found a familiar red and green box called "Half and Half" at a drug store.
Too bland for me.

       -------

   I'd highly recommend against brewing "teabacco".  Although tobacco juice
is a fine emetic, if you ever kept it down you might be in trouble.  I've
heard that the amount of nicotine in one pack of cigarettes is the well over
the fatal does for ingestion.  I don't know how much nicotine is exhaled
(ie remains in the "second-hand smoke"), but being a small alkaloid once it
gets in the gut it's all going to go into the bloodstream.
   There've been quite a few reports of people who continued smoking while
using a nicotine patch, and having heart attacks.  If we presume they didn't
start smoking more, and that the patch is somewhat decreased, that means
they only had twice their normal amount of nicotine.
 
   As for pesticides, I don't have any hard information, but most alkaloids
(nicotine, caffeine, cocaine) are natural insecticides produced by the plant.
I imagine that except for the colorfully-described tobacco worm, tobacco
doesn't have many insect enemies, and may not need much external pesticide.
Viruses and fungi may be another matter.  (I could go off-topic and ask
what it is that makes pest-resistant tomatoes [for organic farming] so
pest-resistant, and whether you'd prefer to have tested artificial chemicals
on the outside, or natural poisons throughout the fruit.)o

     - David Chesler (??????@?????.???)

[ Thanks for the info, David; I'd recommend against "teabacco" too.

Steve,
 The last copy of the Pipe Digest I got was #104 June 18, 1993. I hope
there isn't a problem. It is my understanding that the largest letter
that can be sent to CIS is 30K. Will this be a problem?  Also, I am
looking for a book by the name of "My Lady Nicotine" by J.M.  Barrie.
Maybe some of the reader's can help.
 
                                     ,Ron

[ No problem except a lack of material! Re the Barrie book, you might try:

To try and generate some net noise...
I found some cigars made with pipe tobacco the other day, and gave them a try.
They were pretty bad, but I liked the idea and convenience.  They would be
handy when working outside or in the garage, etc.  Anyway, I wondered if
anybody else has tried any that were decent.  I normally smoke a cavendish
in my pipes, and would like to find something fairly aromatic like that.
  Any suggestions????
     Thanks,

I checked at the local smokeshop yesterday, and the Autumn 1993 issue
is out. I believe this is the latest. (If you have the premier issue,
you're pretty lucky!) 

BTW, I bought back copies and enjoyed reading 'em last night. Although
I'm not a frequent cigar smoker, this put me in a frame of mind to go
out and experiment with a quality cigar. Will do so, Real Soon Now...

The summer issue of C.A. has a picture of Bill Clinton, hunkered down
and chewing furtively on an unlit panatella in the officially
smoke-deprived White House. It was priceless! If anyone can scan it
in, especially in color, please do so and I'll post the GIF.
_Especially_ if you can superimpose the quote below.

Also, BTW, there has been some "discussion" (often flame) on
rec.food.drink about a cigar or tobacco newsgroup. I feel it's a great
idea, but it should be moderated to avoid getting bashed. Colin
(sorry, I don't have your last name!), our newest member above, is
organizing the effort, and has 25 people interested. Whether the group
is eventually created or not, all are invited to join the Pipes
mailgroup, of course!

So, until next time, here's wishing you tall cold 'un out on the
porch, a comfortable lawn chair, a quality cigar or pipe, and a

				Smoke in peace,

		 Pipes Digest #107 - August 24, 1993

Welcome to new members:

	Andrew Tepper		(at15+@andrew.cmu.edu)
	Colin Crist		(???@??????.??.??.??)
	Gregory Nyce		(?????@???.??????)

And we have a LOT of discussion this week, concerning proposals for a
pipes newsgroup! Background: Andy and Colin proposed a cigars
newsgroup in rec.food.drink. I saw the advancing flames and contacted
them. Turned out Colin was putting together an effort to create the
newsgroup, so I got involved. And there the fun starts...

In short, the resolution seems to be that we will propose two new
newsgroups, tentatively named rec.fine-tobacco and
talk.politics.smoking.  

The discussions that led to these decisions are below. Feel free to
join in, here or in news.groups when we make the proposal. (For your
enjoyment, there are also some bits about cigars, interspersed. :-)

This is the most fun I've had here in a while! -S.

Subject: what is price of the following books

Hallo,

Can somebody tell me what the price of the following books are in US. And
furthermore if I could order them somewhere by credit card:
- Gourmet guide to the cigar, by Paul Garmirian (price in Holland some $ 75)
- The cigar companion, by Anwer Bati
- The ultimate cigar book, by Rick Hacker

(the last two are perhaps not yet published)

Hope somebody can help me.

All the best,

Subject: Status of rec.tobacco/rec/smoking

All,

All in all, I've recieved about 25 replies from people regarding a
smoking newsgroup.  As well as support, a few points have been raised
that should be considered before we go ahead and start a CFV.

1. Steve Masticola (????????@????.???????.???) recommended that the group be
   moderated. The reason for this is that smoking has become a subject that
   can cause heated discussion and non-smokers starting a thread such as
   "You are all going to die !" or other such rubbish. Whislt I agree with 
   this, having a moderated group would require someone to moderate it and
   would loose out on a newsgroups spontaneous and dynamic nature.

2. What shall we call it ? rec.tobacco or rec.smoking ?

3. Are 25 replies really enough ? At a call for votes, I could well imagine
   some bloody-minded people out there voting against just because we are
   smoker.

4. There is already a mailgroup (contact Steve as above if you want to
   join the list, I have.

So, how do you all feel ? Shall we go for a CFV or not ? My opinions
one this are that I would happily arrange the vote, a few more of you
can second it (Andy, Steve ?) and see what happens. I wouldn't be as
keen on a moderated group, we'd have to see how it went and the number
of flames that occured and maybe moderate at a later date.

If the preference for a moderated group occured then I wouldn't be
able to do much moderation myself as I'm a contractor and move from
place and cannot guarantee email :-( etc.

Anyway, you thoughts please ! I'll summarise in a day or so and act on
your decisions.

Cheers,
	Colin.

Subject: Re:  Status of rec.tobacco/rec/smoking

Hi, Colin,

Could you please mail this out to your followers?

First, thanks for the advert for the pipes mailgroup! Anyone who would
like to join can mail me at ????????@???.???????.???. Also thanks for
your organizational efforts.

Second, I'll second your motion to begin forming the newsgroup, but
with an additional suggestion.

If a group on the alt. hierarchy (alt.tobacco or something similar) is
acceptable, then there would be no need for calls for votes, which I
feel would almost certainly be defeated. A friend of mine, Elias
Mazur, made a similar call years ago, and was roundly booed off the
net for it. (That was the genesis of the pipes mailgroup, BTW - I
heard about Elias third-hand, contacted him, and posted a call for
members.)

The standard procedure would be to post to alt.config a call for
discussion, wait a few days for the flames to die down, then post a
create message. (I've done the last and can probably still find my
notes on how to do this.)

In any case, I'll mail anything I receive on the subject to the pipes
mailgroup, probably by Friday.

Also, if anyone's interested, there is a BBS in Michigan called the
"Briar Patch," that has a "With Pipe and Book" discussion group.
Interested parties can phone it at (313) 340-0814. Tell Neil I sent
you :-)

Looking forward to having a legitimate mailgroup!

Smoke in peace,
~\U Steve.

&gt; I'd strong recommend rec.tobacco rather than rec.smoking, even though
&gt;it's less accurate (we don't seem to be inviting chewers, nor OTOH users
&gt;of hashish) because of all the negative connotations of "smoking".

Fine; alternately :) "alt.tobacco" or "alt.tobak". See my previous
mailing.

&gt;There
&gt;might be some call for talk/soc.politics.smoking for smokers' rights and
&gt;all that, but I'd hope that this new group would be simply to share and
&gt;enhance the enjoyment of smoking tobacco (in pipe, cigar, or cigarette
&gt;form) and any legal, political, or health concerns be limited to increasing
&gt;that enjoyment, if they appear at all.

I kind of halfway agree about that... wouldn't want to restrict
discussions of politics from the group. I'm more interested in
preventing smoker-bashing.
 
&gt; A very regular message explaining that the newsgroup is not for discussion
&gt;of the rights of smokers and non-smokers, nor is it for discussion of the
&gt;risks about which we're well aware, might make the newsgoup more enjoyable,
&gt;once it's started.

Realistically, I don't think that's going to take the place of
moderating the newsgroup. There are always going to be a certain
percentage of people who either (a) want to save you from your evil
habits, or (b) want to damn you to eternal hellfire for them. (Usually
both.) These people aren't going to care about polite guideline
postings.

Regarding Colin's comments on spontaneity, I think that moderated
groups can certainly be spontaneous -- software exists for automatic
authorization control, so all the moderator would have to do is check
for flame, and hit the appropriate keys.

I think that creating an unmoderated tobacco group is an invitation to
a permanent flamefest. It's the reason why rec.guns, for instance, is
moderated.

&gt; As an alternative, would Steve or someone else from the Pipes mailing list
&gt;be willing to widen its charter, or form a new mailing list, to include all
&gt;users of smoked tobacco (or maybe chewers too.)  I've seen lately at least
&gt;a tolerance for discussion of cigars.

Already in the mailgroup's charter. I certainly tolerate, and
encourage, discussions of cigars, cigarettes, chewing, snuff-dipping,
smokers' rights, whatever you care to do with the leaf. The only thing
I categorically reject is antismoking flames. Assuming the newsgroup
isn't created, anyone who wants to talk cigars on the mailgroup should
feel free.

&gt;     - David Chesler (??????@?????.???), writing from Cambridge, Mass,
&gt;           where anything goes, as long as you don't smoke while doing it.

Tobacco, that is... on my one visit to Hahvahd Squayah, I smelled less
licit leaves being burned, quite freely. :)

Subject: Re: Status of rec.tobacco/rec/smoking


I don't like the idea of a moderated group; moderated groups seem very
"anti-Internet". I also would prefer rec.tobacco to alt.tobacco only
since (as I understand it) some sites have eliminated the whole alt.
hierarchy.

We may have to put up with the occasional flame, but it will certainly
be nothing compared to what happened when I first _mentioned_ cigars in
rec.food.drink! 

I say we go ahead with the RFD/CFV procedure to create rec.tobacco. (I
agree that this is better than using the word smoking.) If the CFV does
not pass due too many "no" votes we can go ahead with alt.tobacco.

Andy

P.S. I feel I must add something worthwhile to this message... Cigar
smokers: I had an Arturo Fuente (Churchill size, the one with the cedar
inner wrapper) on Saturday. What a fantastic cigar! Nice rich flavor the
whole way through, and without being harsh. I'd like to know if that
company makes any superpremium cigars; this was only in the $2.25 range.
(I do think there's some price/taste correlation within a given brand.
For instance: try the regular Partagas vs. their "Limited Reserve")

Oh, well. Looks like I've started a "discussion" :-)

Andy Tepper writes:

&gt;"anti-Internet".

I'm not sure what you mean by "anti-Internet", so I'll assume that you
mean "anti-freedom." Specifically, anti- freedom of speech. But
arguing that moderating the newsgroup violates freedom of speech is
like arguing that the existence of a bar violates your freedom to be a
teetotaler, or that the existence of the Usenet violates your freedom
to read newspapers.  

A moderated newsgroup is simply a specialized communications medium.
It does not violate anyone's freedom of speech.  Anyone who feels that
they've been unfairly constrained by moderation is free to post in any
of the 2000 existing groups, or to try to create their own.

But there are also practical considerations, as well as philosophical
ones, why rec.tobacco should be moderated. I have already stated one,
and will re-state it here. If the group is created unmoderated, it
_will_ be a magnet for bashing of smokers. Or at the very least, for
smoker versus nonsmoker arguments that lead nowhere and detract from
the enjoyment of the group. Furthermore, if this happens, it will be
impossible to start moderating the group without elaborate rigamarole,
including probably another call for votes. Which we could easily lose.

An unmoderated group would give the antis yet another vehicle for
flamage and bashing. Instead, let's give ourselves an outlet to enjoy
discussing the pleasures of moderate tobacco use, unmolested. Let's
propose a moderated group.

&gt;We may have to put up with the occasional flame, but it will certainly
&gt;be nothing compared to what happened when I first _mentioned_ cigars in
&gt;rec.food.drink! 

IMHO, your experience with rec.food.drink would only be the beginning.
Look around. Antismoking flame wars are everywhere. I can name three
groups, right of the top of my head, not including rec.food.drink,
where they're going on now. A group devoted to tobacco _will_ be a
flame magnet. Conservatively, I'd estimate the signal-to-flame ratio
would probably be about 1:4, on a good day. 

The history of Elias Mazur's rec.pipes proposal bears me out. There
are just too many people on the net who are eager to bash smokers.

&gt;I also would prefer rec.tobacco to alt.tobacco only
&gt;since (as I understand it) some sites have eliminated the whole alt.
&gt;hierarchy.

Good point.

&gt;I say we go ahead with the RFD/CFV procedure to create rec.tobacco. (I
&gt;agree that this is better than using the word smoking.) If the CFV does
&gt;not pass due too many "no" votes we can go ahead with alt.tobacco.

I would be glad to support a proposal for a moderated group, in either
the rec or alt hierarchy. I cannot support an unmoderated one.

Subject: Re: Status of rec.tobacco/rec/smoking

Thanks to all who have contributed to a very interesting discussion.

I'd like to say I support a _moderated_ group _if_ someone is willing to
take this on.

Moderated or not, I favor a rec group if feasible to an alt group for
reasons already raised.  Alt distribution is terrible.  In sampling
various news servers, I've found my home server is receiving only about
one in four of the posts which I can find on other servers.  This is a
true distribution problem, not a time delay.

Re: Flames.  How about rec.cigar or alt.cigar?  Those actually interested
in fine tobacco would poke in to see what's happening.  Hopefully, the
flamers might be less inclined to do so than with a .tobacco or .smoking. 
In offering this I am not saying the scope of discussion should be
constrained.  But possibly there might be fewer flames and negatives
in a call for votes.

Mark Twain, of course!) and the dash to work this morning, I looked up
the Arturo Fuente reviews in Cigar Aficionado.  They use a
blind-tasting system and rate on a scale of 1 to 100. Here are the
early results. (All the Arturo Fuente cigars use Dominican filler and
binder and a Cameroon wrapper, so I won't repeat that info.)

Coronas: (Spring '93):
----------------------

Arturo Fuente Reserva No. 3
	
Length:		5 1/2 inches
Ring guage: 	44
Price:		$4.25
Rating: 	88/100

"Already a cigar well-appreciated in Europe, it's only now being
smoked in America. This is a harmonious smoke with cedar and tobacco
flavors which go on and on in the aftertaste."


Torpedos: (Summer '93)
----------------------

Arturo Fuente Hemingway Classic

Length:		7 inches
Ring guage: 	48
Price:		$4.00

"Smokes as good as it looks. Elegant rich flavors of nutmeg and
cinnamon with a wonderful silky texture."



Arturo Fuente Hemingway Masterpiece

Length:		9 1/4 inches
Ring guage: 	52
Price:		$6.25
Rating: 	86/100

"Powerful rich smoke. Good draw and full-bodied with rich coffee taste
and spicy flavors."



Churchills (Fall '93):
----------------------

Arturo Fuente Double Chateau
	
Length:		6 3/4 inches
Ring guage: 	50
Price:		$2.25
Rating: 	90/100

"A full-bodied cigar with a great balance of coffee flavors and a
range of sweet spiciness including nutmeg and cinnamon."



Arturo Fuente Churchill
	
Length:		7 1/4 inches
Ring guage: 	48
Price:		$1.85
Rating: 	86/100

"A medium-bodied cigar that looks as good as it tastes. It has creamy
coffee flavors and a mild spicy finish laced with white pepper."

Subject: Re: Status of rec.tobacco/rec/smoking

 I vote against {rec|alt}.cigar, in favor of {rec|alt}.toba{k|cco}:
 
 1) All users of tobacco should be welcomed.
 2) Similarity (especially given that names are often shortened) between
       the words cigar and cigarette would attract the flamers.
 3) Some folks think all cigars smell like bad cheap cigars.
 4) The n pack per day Merit/Marlboro/Camel smokers don't often think of
    the plant from which their product is produced, and neither do the
    anti-smokers, so tobacco doesn't have as much negative connotation
    as cigarette or smoking.
 5) I don't usually smoke cigars :-)  (Although I probably should.  Judging
    from the 2 minutes I got to smoke the Jamaican of which a friend brought
    a case to my wedding, there's a lot of enjoyment to be had there.)

 Moderated is good if someone will volunteer.  If the group doesn't attract
flamers, the moderator can auto-reflect, or just auto-reflect with selective
twitting.  (I gather from what Steve said that there is software to do this.)
Moderated doesn't have to mean digest form.
 
 Rec is better than alt, if we can get it.  Alt is better than nothing.
(And nothing is better than a good smoke... :-) ).

Subject: Moderation in all things...

Regarding the *.toba* newsgroup: If the decision is made to create a
moderated group, would we have a volunteer to moderate it? (Colin?
Andy? It's your baby, after all :-)

I'd do it, but I'm waaaaaaaaaaaay overcommitted as is; besides which,
I'm already doing the pipes mailgroup.

If no one in this small cohort wants to do it, I could put a call for
volunteers out on the pipes mailgroup, but I really hope that doesn't
come to pass.

BTW: I vote for:

	- rec.fine.tobacco initially, alt.fine.tobacco as a backup.
	  The word "fine" to indicate the purpose of the group.

	- Moderated, but not digested, as David suggests.

BTW, David, I'm including your previous message for Andy's benefit; he
seems to have gotten dropped off the list.

- Steve.

Subject: Re: Moderation in all things...

Steve,

    If there's a consensus that rec.fine.tobacco should be moderated,
I'll do the moderating. I know nothing about moderating a group, so
there may be a few problems:

  There are occasions when I am not on the internet for 4-7 days at a
stretch; I assume that for those periods, things can be set up so the
group is unmoderated for a short time (although nobody will have to know
it). Little flames may creep up in those periods, but they could quickly
be extinguished.
  Also, I don't have much space in my account, and I don't want to push
for more since I am officially CMU "staff" who currently works zero
hours per month. This is how I get my account, and it's best not to stir
this delicate arrangement. I am assuming messages don't sit in my
account until they are posted. (I could handle some storage, just not
lots.)

  Assuming that these are not problems, let's do an RFD for rec.fine.tobacco!

Andy

Subject: Re: Status of rec.tobacco/rec/smoking

 &gt;    ... In offering .cigar as a suggestion, my thinking was that the
 &gt; readership in news.announce might be more willing to let us slip by and be
 &gt; created if they thought we were discussing the merits of one cigar versus
 &gt; another, rather than promoting use.  I realize this is a _tenuous_
 &gt; argument about emotions of people I don't know.  It's a hunch. (shrug)

Paul:

 Agreed, generally.  _MY_ thinking was that a random pipe-smoking browser
who doesn't yet like cigars wouldn't bother visiting rec.cigars.  In my
humble guess, we'd lose more people like that than we would lose anti-
smoking flamers.

 And once we're in our own space, I don't think we'll attract the rabid
anti-smokers.  Even alt.sex.bondage and other perverted sexual groups
don't get all that many problem people.  I can't speak for rec.guns, but
the firearms mailing lists get occassional reasoned argument, which as long
as it remains polite is welcomed.  Abortion is a hot topic of course, but
it's not all that bad.  (I'm the keeper of the abortion bit bucket for the
libertarian mailing list: whenever the topic comes up people tell the offender
to talk to me, and I say "Here is the list of people interested in talking
about abortion in a libertarian framework, start a mailing list" and that
shuts them up, and I add their name to the list for next time.)

 In a net that has places for perverts, bikers, druggies, gun nuts, and
political and abortion whackos of all creeds, I don't anticipate much
problem once the group is established.

 I agree with Steve that it's easier to start moderated than the other way
around, but I'm not as worried as he seems to be, now that I've thought about
it, that we'll get rabid anti-smokers.
 
 Hmmm -- maybe the discussion should suggest two groups.  One (that we've
been discussing) for articles about the enjoyment of tobacco, and another
along the lines of talk.politics.smoking.

David --

This is an interesting idea, offering an outlet for anti-smoking talk at
the same time a tobacco newsgroup is proposed.  I certainly would hope
your sense is correct: that offering both simultaneously would result in yes
votes for both, not yes for talk and no for tobacco.

[ Although the irony is amusing :), having smokers propose an
approved group to discuss the "evils" of smoking while the tobacco
discussion is voted down by anti-smoking people ]

To All --

Has anyone witnessed a similar double proposal, one for a controversial
group and one for a separate group to talk about the controversy?  Did it
work?  What do you think?

From: Colin Crist &lt;???@??????.??.??.??&gt;
Subject: My views on the discussion so far

All,

Some interesting ideas have been proposed and these are the ones that I
like....

1.	A *loosely* moderated group rec.fine.tobacco. The fine is a nice
	touch that emphasises we are talking about the finer things in
	smoking/chewing good tobacco. It covers the widest area and I
	like it.

	The moderations can be done mainly atomatically with articles
	being checked for key words (or posters :-)) and referred to
	a moderator for checking. This would keep some of the spontaneity
	in the group/

2.	David Chesler's idea of two groups, one of which would be 
	talk.politics.smoking/tobacco could well be a rather clever
	way of helping our case *and* keeping the heat of a newly
	formed tobacco group.

I would suggest that in the moderation, we have a few people who get forwarded
posibly dodgy articles for checking, I get the feeling that none of us would
be able to take on the commitment of a moderator alone (we all have jobs to
do to bring in the pennies after all) so a group could well be the best way.

Having moderation done in this method would allow me to participate as a
moderator as I wouldn't be alone !! My workload goes up and down somewhat
rapidly and so this would fit in quite well.

In a nutshell:
	1. Arrange CFD/CVF: rec.fine.tobacco, Moderated (more volunteers?)
	2. Arrange CFD/CVF: talk.politics.tobacco, Unmoderated.

I suggest we have 3 or 4 moderators sharing the workload (which *should* be
very low).

I'm off to Prague later today for the weekend :-) so you'll not hear
from me until next Tuesday - how about we make the middle of next week
definite action time ?

As I'll put myself forward for part-time moderator, here are my biases and
prefernces in smoking. On a day to day basis I smoke cigarettes, but thankfully
none of those mass produced variety. Generally I hand-roll using Durma/Drum 
Milde Shag (I try and keep to 5-10 a day). The only ready-made cigarette
I'd consider now is Sullivans No1 Turkish, nice for a change but I can
never smoke more than a couple of them. As for cigars, my general perference
is for a nice Romeo y Julietta (there's nearly always a No 3 in the fridge!).
I don't smoke many of them, maybe once a month at most and so often talk
it over with the chap in the shop and try something different, sadly I
always forget to write down which I liked, I must start !!

I would be nice if other moderators had interests in different areas such
as Pipes or had more knowledge than myself (i've only really taken an
interest in cigars over the last couple of years).

Question: Anyone out there got Nat Shermans number ? I bought a box of
Carpe Diem when I was in NY over Easter and I have one left. I hope
Nats will do mail order as I rather liked them, definitely worth a try.
The glass tube is classy and useful when you don't smoke that many as
they keep individually fresh. A reasonably mild smoke, and a fairly
long one too. They're about $6 each I think.

Speak to you all next week....

Colin.

Subject: Nat Sherman's number

Chris asks for Nat Sherman's number.
 I misplaced their card and catalog (yes, they do mail order) but from a pack
of cigarettes, which coyly gives their address as Fifth Avenue and
Fifty-Fifth Street, NYC (I know the outlet on Fifth and 42nd; if you 
used 1 W. 42nd St, New York, NY 10001 you wouldn't be too far off, or
omit the optional zip code) there is a slip of paper:
  For more information on Sherman products we invite you to call:
    1-800-221-1690
 
 The other day I got the "Thompson &amp; Co." good-life catalog.  There's a lot
of the usual hokey catalog stuff, but also a lot of cigars and some pipes.
I can't judge of the quality or price.
   Thompson
   PO Box 31274
   Tampa FL 33633-0537
   800-237-2559
                (Hey -- do 800 numbers work from the UK?)
 
 And back to the boring discussion at hand, technically it should be
rec.tobacco.fine, or rec.fine-tobacco, but I guess since the wags started
creating alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork folks aren't so picky about
the heirarchy.

		 Pipes Digest #108 - August 31, 1993

Welcome to new members:

	Arthur Noguerola	(????????????????@???.???????.???)
	Randy Smerik		(??????@???.????????.???.???)

I'm mailing a Digest a bit early this time, because there have been a
lot of comments on the proposed tobacco newsgroup, and because
tomorrow's the day that Colin promised to initiate the request for
discussion (RFD). If you have any comments about the group, the best
thing at this point would probably be to mail them directly to Colin
at ???@??????.??.??.??. Send a copy to me if you'd like them included
in the Pipes Digest.

If you'd like to make a legitimate fine-tobacco newsgroup a reality,
it is _imperative_ that you support the proposal on the open
newsgroups. PLEASE join in! I presume the posting will be done on
news.groups; any place else, Colin?

Also, I want to re-emphasize that, although the name of the digest
contains the word "Pipes," discussion of cigars, or any other
tobacco-related topics, are welcome here. This goes regardless of what
happens with respect to the newsgroups.

As always, light 'un up and enjoy! -S.

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #107 - August 24, 1993

First, I vote for rec.fine.tobacco, unmoderated.  I think the group should
be self-policing.  We can bounce the bozos out by ignoring them.

Second, I was in the U.S. Capitol building the other day and saw this
exhibit called "A good 5-cent cigar" or something like that.  It is one of
a number of exhibits on the history of the Senate and House.  Anyhow, they
had a full box of "Webster" cigars in the display case.  It's from circa
1950.  And I thought the cigars I keep around in the open for three weeks
were bad! :)

Subject: This Newsgroup Thing

Concerning the proposals for the newsgroup:

I have to admit, I suspect we may regret entering this fray.  The 
process of the creation of rec.motorcycles.harley was just horrible,
thanks to the incredible bigotry of the "antis".  Smoking, especially
of pipes and cigars, is a loaded-enough topic for us to be pretty 
confident of the same sort of reception.  It took four tries to
get the Harley group established, and there are those of us who
now doubt it was worth all the tsuris.  The Harley mailing list
has better discussions and a much better S:N ratio.

If we go ahead, I favor the rec.* heirarchy over alt.*, as many who
reside in the *.com domain are denied the alt.* groups.  Corporate 
America just can't relate to (paying for) alt.sex.

I further recommend that the "main" discussion group be moderated.
The more time I spend on the internet, the more convinced I become
of the benefits of moderation.  In the case of the Harley group, 
for example, there has never been a time when there isn't at least
one "flame" thread, started by non-Harley-riders who feel they
need to attack the Harley folks in their own group.  This is simply
noise, wasting net resources with no benefit to anyone.  The 
anti-smoking folks I've met seem to feel divinely empowered to 
be the most obnoxious squits on the face of the planet, and I 
believe we can expect a HUGE dose of this during the CFD/CFV phase,
and it will not go away.  The responses we got on rec.food.drink
are just a small sample.  Did anyone else notice that while there
were howls and shrieks that we were discussing something outside
the group's charter, there was no similar reaction to the discussion
of shrimp in Maryland that immediately followed?  We've been warned.

A "talk.politics.smoking" group might be a useful lightning rod,
but IMHO, a waste of time.  No one's mind is likely to be changed 
about any aspect of this.  People will still claim to support human
rights while forcing oppression and bigotry of the rawest kind
upon smokers.

If my tone sounds a little depressed, it's because I'm already
bracing myself for the ugliness I'm sure will follow.  This will
not be fun, folks.  A moderated digest may serve us better.

&gt; Does anyone here like to smoke fine cigars?  Is there any interest in
&gt; starting a discussion or a newsgroup on this fast-growing avocation?
We just had a major flamewar on rec.food.drink on this very subject! :)
We are in the process of starting such a board, and are getting things
going (RFD/CFV) on Wednesday. I think it will be called
rec.fine-tobacco. The board will be lightly moderated, and we are also
proposing an unmoderated rec.politics.smoking board for people to yell
at each other on. Steve Masticola runs a pipes mailing list that you
might find interesting.

Subject: news on smoking;-)

Hello Steve,

I wonder how the relation between the present discussion list will be and the
news? Is there a means of having the groups linked in a close manner? I would
like that, because of the difficulty in reaching news!

All the best,

Victor

[ I had no plans to link the newsgroup(s) with the pipes mailgroup.
However, should the newsgroup be created, I could set up a cron job
that could mail articles to members who don't get news easily. Let's
defer that discussion until we have something to discuss. -S. ]

Here, here!  I do believe that a small unmoderated group could be created
without the deluge of unsavouries attacking every little post.  Thus I
propose the following:

	rec.tobacco	: FAQ and discussion, effectively a misc version
			  of a rec.tobacco.d

	rec.tobacco.pipe	: For pipes

	rec.tobacco.cigar	: For cigars

	rec.tobacco.growing	: For discussion on growing, curing, etc...

		.
		.
		.

	and a host of others should the need arise.

Hey Steve, 

Was there a Pipes Digest #105?  I noticed I have 104 thru 107 but
no 105.  If there was, could you send me a copy?

I'm leaning on John to post to the group his recent meeting with
the fine British gentlemen of the Norwich Pipe Club.   We met 
with them last year when we were in the UK, and John went there
again in June.  

Take care!  \\JR

		Pipes Digest #109 - September 3, 1993

Welcome to a new member:

	Neil Flatter   		(???????@???.???????????.???)

And the big news is that the RFD for the tobacco newsgroups has gone
out to news.groups. See Colin Crist's message (the last one in this
Digest.) And join us there for the fun!

BTW, Norm posts an urgent appeal for postings NOT relating to the
fine-tobacco newsgroup :-) Can anyone help him out? 

With that in mind, I'd suggest that we take discussion of the f-t
newsgroup to news.groups itself, reserving the Pipes Mailgroup and
Colin's list for discussions of tactics. Or to just light up your
favorite Dunhill (gee, it can be a cigar OR a pipe, so I'm safe! :-),
relax, and chew the rag in a friendly, if somewhat visible,
atmosphere. -S.

Steve,

Concerning the newsgroup proposal, you said:

&gt; [ Don't be down, Martin. Yes, it'll be an uphill struggle, but one
&gt; worth struggling for. -S. ]

I wonder.  You've done a superb job with this mailgroup, and the
level of discussion on it is far beyond anything I've seen on
Usenet.  A newsgroup is just too accessible to the idiot fringe.  I
suspect the folks who say "ignore them;  they'll go away" haven't
seen really determined bigots in action, and aren't paying for their
newsfeeds (neither am I, but some folks are).  As I learned in the
case of Homebrew Digest, wider circulation is a mixed blessing, at
best.

I hope you plan to keep the Digest going, whatever the fate of the
Newsgroup? 

	- Martin

[ I think moderating the group will remove the idiot fringe, Martin.
But I will indeed keep the Pipes Mailgroup running, regardless of the
vote. And thanks. -S. ]

Subject: So Ya wanna be a newsgroup :-&gt;

Hi all,

Just my $0.02 on this newsgroup thing.  It's okay and I'll support
it come vote time,  but it will never replace the mail group in
my opinion.  Can you imagine 16 followups to one of Bill Thacker's
stories of pipes lore?  All the anti-smokers and historians will
flame forever -- who needs the hassle.

The only good that may come of it is that we will have an avenue to
advertise the mailgroup and continue to enjoy a growing membership
of serious pipe people.

&gt;From my point of view,  when I light up a pipe it is a time to
reflect,  to think,  to quietly drift off in a world of my own.
I don't want to cloud this most peaceful time with questions about
the ill effects of tobacco.  I already know all of this,  and most
everything else that the media jumps on to tell us is unhealthy.
I want to know how to keep the moisture out of my pipe,  what 
blends I should try,  the advantadges of a good meersheim (sp), et. al.

Like I said,  I'll support the group in the vote and see what happens,
but I'll probably flake out of it in a while.  If you are really
interested in getting the newsgroup going,  I would suggest a very
vague euphanism for smoking be used as the group name.  Something
like rec.churchil (Famous smoking statesm and and also the name of
a cigar).   This way,  the occasional zealot who roams through the
newsgroup file won't find smoke or tobacco and will not make the
connection.  Hey,  how about rec.light-up?  rec.SwanVestas?

Where the hell is Bill anyway,  I'm getting bored with this discussion
(although I must admit it's nice to have this much traffic in the
newletter lately).  I've been wondering if he knows how the discovery
of Briar came about,  and who first introduced this material to the
world.

For you more serious types;  tell me how to keep the moisture out of
my pipe (short of sticking cotton balls in my mouth)?

Till later (let me know where I vote)

Norm

[ At the risk of boring you still further, Norm, I think what happens
in the next two months might give Bill some material for his war
stories :-) See my comments at the top of the Digest. -S. ]

Subject: Here we go...

All,

As promised, I shall today be starting an attempt to form two newsgroups.

1.	rec.fine-tobacco: lightly moderated - mainly automatic with a
	group of moderators (Andy, Steve and myself at present) who
	shall be forwarded possibly unsuitable articles.

2.	talk.politics.smoking: unmoderated group. Hopefully it will
	take most of the flames during formation and give some cover
	for the main group !!

Thanks for everyones support and ideas so far, if you would inform
colleagues who have expressed an interest to watch out for the
discussion and votes (I'll let you all know when) and participate
(positively please!).

I'll keep you informed of what's going on....

Colin.

(Andy - this is my first newsgroup forming attempt, as you said that
 you were involved in one before, could you send me any info and perhaps
 some help ? Cheers - Colin.)

It is a bit difficult for me to understand the discussions you have
about the new mailgroup.  Do you have to apply through a certain
procedure to start a group?  Are the names/addresses of the mailgroups
`posted' somewhere so the `antis' can poke in?

I am interested in subscribing to a few magazines about pipes, since it
is not easy to get any info about pipes here in Taiwan.  Can anyone
kindly help me out?  Thanks.

???????@?????.??? (James Taranto) wrote requesting people interested
in starting a discussion or a newsgroup on cigars to respond to this
address.  I have been smoking a pipe for almost ten years and would
be interested in joining your pipe mail group.  As far as the cigars
go, I smoke a cigar about once a month so my tastes are still crude.
Being able to gather information about pipes, cigars, and related
tobaccoo hobbies would be of interest to me.

Subject: Current situation

All,

I have posted a CFD to the powers that be for rec.fine-tobacco and 
talk.politics.tobacco. When/if they approve then the discussion will
follow-up on news.groups. I also copied the CFD to rec.food.drink as
quite a lot of interest has stemmed from there.

I'll let you all know when I hear anything - when I do could Steve
send the information to his mail group ?

I suggest that we be prepared for a fair amount of flames - although
in the propsed charter I explicitly stated that rec.fine-tobacco is
for the discussion of enjoying tobacco by enlightened people in 
moderation !! I think I'm right in saying that long discussions about
Marlboro or rolling non-tobacco consumables would not be welcome - 
there are other newgroups for such things !

Cheers,
	Colin.

Steve,

I figured that if I make *very* clear that the group is for more
enlightened smokers - those that take enjoyment of it and are
aware of the dangers, not really for the 40 a day Marlboro man, 
then the flames should be minimised and our chances of the
group becoming a reality are increased.

There are plenty of alcohol related groups - why not a tobacco
related one ?

Colin.

Oh - a warning to anyone traveling to the Czech Republic. Don't
attempt the local tobacco or cigarettes, they are quite incredibly
disgusting ! Even worse than Russian ones !

[ Thanks for the warning, Colin! I think we have one .cz address in
the newsgroup now, though... -S. ]

&gt; I figured that if I make *very* clear that the group is for more
&gt; enlightened smokers - those that take enjoyment of it and are
&gt; aware of the dangers, not really for the 40 a day Marlboro man, 
&gt; then the flames should be minimised and our chances of the
&gt; group becoming a reality are increased.

True, but then again, remember the wars around Mazur's proposal for
rec.pipes. That one clearly was aimed at pipe smokers and not the
two-pack-a-day cowboy, but it still went down in flames.

Perhaps we should set up a strategy? I think there's a great danger of
getting bogged down in flame wars. I've tried to draw up a list of
points to reiterate when the flames come. Perhaps we can use the
"broken record" approach to resist the flamage.

- rec.fine-tobacco is aimed at enlightened smokers who:

	* Enjoy the moderate and considerate use of fine tobacco;
	* Smoke to appreciate fine tobacco, rather than out of
	  addiction; 
	* Recognize that tobacco smoking carries potential danger to
	  themselves and others;
	* Respect the rights of others who do not wish to be exposed
	  to tobacco smoke.

- Other newsgroups already exist within the rec. hierarchy which are
dedicated to controversial and/or dangerous activities. These groups
include, but are not limited to, the following:

	* rec.hunting:		Posession and use of deadly weapons.
	* rec.guns:

	* rec.pyrotechnics:	Construction and use of rockets,
	* rec.models.rockets:	firecrackers, and the like.

	* rec.food.drink: 	Consumption of alcohol.

	* rec.gambling:		Gambling.

	* rec.motorcycles:	Potentially dangerous sports.
	* rec.autos.sport:
	* rec.aviation.homebuilt:
	* rec.skydiving:
	* rec.scuba:
	* etc.

	* rec.nude		Prurient interest.

	* rec.arts.bodyart:	Social stigmata and bloodborne disease
				risks. 

These groups have a right to exist, as demonstrated by the fact that
they were created and now do exist. If these groups have a right to
exist, then so does rec.fine-tobacco.

- Nonsmokers who disapprove of smoking can post their disapproval
almost anywhere on the net without fear of harassment. The existence
of rec.fine-tobacco will not prevent them from continuing to do so.

- Nonsmokers have the right not to subscribe to rec.fine-tobacco if
they feel the group would offend them.

- However, _enlightened_ nonsmokers acknowledge that:

	* Other adults have a right to make their own informed
	  decisions regarding whether they will be smokers or
	  nonsmokers;  
	* Other adults have a right to enjoy fine tobacco as long as
	  they are considerate of others and obey the law;
	* Other adults have a right to engage in free speech among
	  themselves, free from harassment;
	* The acknowledgement of the above rights of adults does not
	  detract from their own rights.


How does this look? Complete enough? Too complete? Will it do any
good? Do you have any other tactical ideas?

&gt; Oh - a warning to anyone traveling to the Czech Republic. Don't
&gt; attempt the local tobacco or cigarettes, they are quite incredibly
&gt; disgusting ! Even worse than Russian ones !

I'll make sure to avoid them! (Actually, I haven't smoked a cigarette
in the past ten years, so no danger! :-)

Steve et al.,

I say (IMHO) let's go ahead with the proposed newsgroup.  Yes, the 
flames will be fierce.  It will probably take more than one try.
But --  how many times are we told "The Internet is for the Free
Discussion of Ideas" etc. etc. etc. and so forth?  Free speech does
include letting those you disagree with have their say, and it seems
like the flamers could be met with that point.  After all, we're not
asking them to light up a Butera or a Partagas (although it might 
help 'em if they did!) -- we just want a newsgroup!

Subject: Better Nat Sherman's address

  While vacationing this week, and enjoying Nat Sherman's Mint (beaches, and
cottages with ashtrays and without flammable clutter, and nightclubs, are
more condusive to smoking, especially cigarettes, than is the firetrap I call
home), I found a better address than the one I hurriedly sent out last week.
(Who's this Chris character anyway? :-) )

      "If your favorite Nat Sherman cigarettes are not available at your
            local tobacco counter, please mail this order form to:
           Nat Sherman, Inc.  500 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10110
 
         Call toll-free: 800-221-1690 or fax your order: 212-246-8639"
 
 Although they do have a full catalog, the order form referenced mentions only
their cigarettes, which are generally $30 per carton of 200 cigarettes,
$4 postage and handling for the first three cartons.
 
 And speaking of Marlboro-bashing, it's not such a bad cigarette (just like
a Big Mac isn't such a bad hamburger) and it is readily available.  On the
other hand, I tried the Menthol (my wife likes mint) and found it unsmokably
harsh.

           - David Chesler (??????@?????.???), not only an enjoyer of fine
                  tobacco, but also lately a non-addicted nicotine savorer.


[ Thanks, David! I'll modify the Resource Guide to include the new
address for Sherman's, and also try to avoid bashing Marlboros. We
didn't do that, did we? -S. ]

Steve,

Your mention of lighting up a Dunhill brings to mind a question I was
pondering recently.

Dunhill have cigars by sold by year of making, now I was wondering that 
except for the time for the tobacco to mature and mellow, is this anything
more that a sales gimmick ?

Can anyone really notice the difference in a 1988 and 1989 because of
better growing conditions ?

My strong suspicion is that of a sales ploy - anyone know for sure ?

Cheers,
	Colin.

[ I'm 100% certain that someone, somewhere, does. :-) Non-smart-alecks
who know the real answer are urged to follow up. -S. ]

Status: R

Greetings;
 This is my first message to this list as I just recently joined and I thought
I would just ask a quick question. I usually buy different boxes of cigar for
variety, these get split three ways as two of my friends and myself have a
'cigar consortium' and thus we get to buy cigars more often and try different
ones than we otherwise would if one person had to smoke the whole box. At any
rate my absolute favorite cigar which I sporadically go back to is the before
mentioned Fuente Hemingway. the problem is that my usual source (Famous in NY)
has been out of these now for about 4 months. Can anyone tell me where else I
might purchase these.??
thanks
sixto

&gt;Steve,
&gt;
&gt;Concerning the newsgroup proposal, you said:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; [ Don't be down, Martin. Yes, it'll be an uphill struggle, but one
&gt;&gt; worth struggling for. -S. ]
&gt;
&gt;I wonder.  You've done a superb job with this mailgroup, and the
&gt;level of discussion on it is far beyond anything I've seen on
&gt;Usenet.  A newsgroup is just too accessible to the idiot fringe.  I
&gt;suspect the folks who say "ignore them;  they'll go away" haven't
&gt;seen really determined bigots in action, and aren't paying for their
&gt;newsfeeds (neither am I, but some folks are).  As I learned in the
&gt;case of Homebrew Digest, wider circulation is a mixed blessing, at
&gt;best.

As I see it, a newsgroup's accessability is a huge advantage.  Many
people subscribe to Homebrew Digest and/or read rec.crafts.brewing
before that actually make the investment to start brewing on their
own.  This gives them security in knowning that good advice is close
at hand.

When I first started smoking a pipe, I did like so many other people:
I bought a filtered Dr. Graybo and some Apple tobaccoo that had been
sitting on the drug store shelf for three million years.  [Reflective
pause to light my Ben Wade.]  Had it not been for a patient staff at
the local pipe shop, I'd probably be one of those anti-smoking freak
you're concerned about.  A newsgroup has the visibility to help these
neophites enjoy the pleasures of a good pipe.  It might also help
present an acurate representation of the risks involved in contrast
to the media lumping pipe smokers in with smokeless tobaccoo and
cigarette smokers.

Please add me to the Pipes Mailgroup routing list.  I smoke "fine" cigars
and occasionally my pipe, but I despise cigarettes.  Good luck with the
newsgroup.  I'm one of the many who've previously searched for such a
newsgroup with obviously no luck.  It's news to me that there was a
mailing list.  I hope that my inclusion not only satisfies my interest,
but also adds support in numbers to the newsgroup effort.

Wade.

[ Thanks for your interest, Wade. I must say that, regardless of
anything else, the discussion has netted us a lot of fresh blood. -S. ]

Re Sixto Gonzalez' request for cigar resources, don't forget JR's in Salem
NC (1800-jr-cigar) which bills itself as the world's largest cigar retailer
(and from my experience, one of the cheapest as they supply my Macunudo
Portofinos at about $16/box under local cost).

In response to the inquiry from a list member for a source of
Arturo Fuente Hemingway Signatures, I wanted to mention that I
have bought boxes of that (excellent) cigar, from JR Cigar in
Selma, NC.
The price is excellent too (only $54 for a box of 25).
One can call them to order or request a catalog at 1-800-JR-CIGAR.

Hope this helps,

Smoke in peace,

Subject: vinatage year on cigars

Hello Colin,

I never smoked a vintage year cigar (is perhaps expensive and not
available in Holland), but according to the Cigar Aficionado articles
there seem to be cigars with a year on it (called vintage cigars, like
for vintage wines).

I certainly can imagine that these things are around and that they
will certainly have different tastes over the years. It is a product
of nature and the sun, water, wind, see, etc. have influence on it.

But perhaps somebody has the oppertunity of smoking such a cigar? Let
us know the results.

Beside this reaction, perhaps we could place an article in Cigar
Aficionado to get even more new memebers. I will think on this and try
to put something on the list, but perhaps a real American writing
person can do the job better;-)

All the best,

Victor

[ Not sure about that last assertion, Victor, but we could give it a
shot! I'm sure they'd be interested.  -S. ]

Subject: brie profile new member

thanks for your prompt response to my request to join the group. i have
been smoking a pipe for about 15 years after having smoked cigarettes for
many years before. at the present time, i smoke "brigham" pipes made here
in canada. my favourite tobacco is amphora brown and occassionally i use
the red, blue and green. one of our problems in canada is the price of
tobacco. with all the taxes we have to pay, a 10 oz can of amphora that
can be purchased at the duty free store at the border in buffalo or
detroit, costs about $10.00 us will cost about $70.00 canadian. as you can
see, i try to pick one up whenever i'm in the usa. well, thats all for
now. i think i need a smoke.

[ Don't blame you a bit for buying the Amphora on this side of the
border, Duane! My apologies for thinking you were a novice, and thanks
for your interest. -S. ]

From:         Charles Huttar &lt;??????@????.??????&gt;
Subject:      tobacco

This has to do with an earlier fantasist (?), Sir John Beaumont
(1583?-1627), who as an obviously gifted youth produced in 1602 a
mock-Ovidian poem of 1056 lines, "The Metamorphosis of Tabacco".  Earlier
English Ovidiuan writers (they were quite in vogue as John was growing up)
had tended to rewrite myths found in Ovid and to be quite serious,
sometimes moralizing (I can hear you shuddering).  Beaumont was playful,
satiric, ironic--and he concocted his own myth.  Two of them in fact. Which
of the gods, he asks, was so "bounteous to the humane race" as to create
tobacco ? (This was while Elizabeth still reigned and a couple of years
before the new king, James published his "A Counter-blaste to Tobacco"; thus
praising tobacco was still politically correct.)  Beaumont is saddled, of
course, with the historical fact that tobacco was only recently introduced
into Europe (where many seriously promoted it as a medical panacea), but
that doesn't stop him from incorporating it in narratives of much more
ancient times.

FIRST MYTH: Prometheus was caught stealing fire and punished, but to avenge
him, Earth brings forth an herb that makes the theft of fire worthwhile.
This takes place in Atlantis (which for Beaumont = America).  But Jove,
still angry, hides it from Europe.  The Graces, in their travels, happen
across it and refuse ever to go back to so-called civilization; Europeans,
desperate to recover Grace, eventually discover America.

SECOND MYTH: There is a beautiful nymph in Virginia whom Jove sees and
falls in love with; Juno finds out and transforms her into a plant, but Jove
endows this plant with healing and pleasure-giving virtues, and this is the
beginning of "the famous golden age"!  Then Proserpina destroys it, and the
world rapidly becomes more and more corrupt.  Finally Aesculapius reveals
tobacco "to our new golden age" (a typical Elizabethan theme) and invents a
smoking pipe.

                                   ***

BTW, C.Huttar's article on Sir John Beaumont appeared in full in the
DICTIONARY OF LITERARY BIOGRAPHY, Vol. 121, 1992.

<TITLE>Pipes Digest Article: 111.007</TITLE>
</head>
<body>
<pre>
From: Martin A. Lodahl &lt;??????????????@???????.???&gt;
Subject: On the Group Front

In Pipes Digest #110, Neil Flatter reacted to an enigmatic remark I'd
made in Pipes Digest #109:

&gt; &gt;     ....  As I learned in the
&gt; &gt;case of Homebrew Digest, wider circulation is a mixed blessing, at
&gt; &gt;best.
&gt; 
&gt; As I see it, a newsgroup's accessability is a huge advantage.  Many
&gt; people subscribe to Homebrew Digest and/or read rec.crafts.brewing
&gt; before that actually make the investment to start brewing on their
&gt; own.  This gives them security in knowning that good advice is close
&gt; at hand.

It's a question of the balance between the number of those benefitted,
and the extent of the benefit.  For much of its history, HBD was a
mailgroup with a superb signal:noise ratio.  Its members were mutually
supportive, its discussions had a distinctly civilized and adult tone
to them, "flaming" was altogether unknown.  Its excellence, often
cited by its delighted readers, attracted more and more subscribers.
"Critical mass" was reached in the autumn of '91.  One new subscriber
proved to be a dyed-in-the-wool flame-monger, the boorishness of his
discourse exceeded only by the unsoundness of his opinions.  This
appeared to be a signal to many others who had been on their best
behavior, conforming to the group norm, and the value of the discussion
crumbled rapidly.  Many of the most valuable contributors of years
past either read but don't post, or have left altogether, feeling
they have better things to do with their time than defend themselves
from aggressive swine.  This could just as easily happen to us.  Bigger
is by no means always better.

On another subject altogether, I must say I've been pleasantly surprised
by the discussions so far concerning the possible new newsgroups.  The
anticipated flamefest hasn't materialized, and even the handful of folks
who seemed to look for any specious argument they could club us with,
seems to have calmed down.  The potential for a "rec.connoisseur.*"
hierarchy seems promising.  Onward!

Subject: The History of Briar

Norm asks the eternal question:

&gt; Where the hell is Bill anyway...

&gt; I've been wondering if he knows how the discovery
&gt; of Briar came about,  and who first introduced this material to the
&gt; world.

I'll defer the latter question to philosphers and the clergy.  But oddly
enough, I've just finished researching the question of the discovery of
briar.

Traditional has it that briar pipes were introduced in the early 1800's by
one of Napoleon's officers.  At the time clay pipes were the norm (er, no 
relation), but apparently this chap took a nasty spill from his horse and
his pipe bravely threw itself between him and the ground, cushioning his 
fall but with tragic consequences.  

As no gentleman of the day would be caught without a pipe, the officer
began searching for a replacement in nearby villages.  He happened upon a
woodcarver who offered to construct a pipe from a particularly hard and
durable wood he knew of.  The officer, in desperation, consented, and soon
realized the superiority of his new pipe over clay; the briar pipe was 
born.  

Well, that's certainly romantic, and perhaps even true, yet this Frenchman
can hardly be credited with the discovery of the briar pipe.  At best, he
deserves recognition for reintroducing this bastion of smokingdom to
Europe.

Nor do I put any stock in Greek legend.  Their mythology has is that Athena
(goddess of wisdom and battle) and Poseidon (god of the sea) had a contest
to gain the loyalty of the city of Athens. Poseidon created the horse; 
Athena responded with the briar tree; and the citizens of Athens chose 
Athena's gift as the more useful and took her as their patron goddess.  
Poseidon was naturally jealous, and to this day no pipe will remain lit 
underwater.  While this myth serves to explain the abundance of briar in 
the Mediterranean region, the complete absence of pipes in Greek lore 
reveals that something is amiss in this account.  

The truth lies shrouded in the mists of history.  The Calumets (or "peace
pipes") used by the native Americans,for instance,show evidence of common
lineage to the ceremonial pipes used by the natives of Kamchatka and 
Irkutsk,indicating that smoking and wooden pipes must have migrated to 
North America before the loss of the Siberia-Alaska land bridge.  It 
appears that these Siberian pipes were themselves crude copies of the 
ornate ceramic pipes enjoyed by the Chinese rulers in the Forbidden City 
during the Han dynasty.  Similar degenerate pipes are found in the ruins of
ancient civilizations throughout Asia.

At this point the evidence becomes sparse, but it seems clear that
pipes, like so many other things, were introduced to Europe by the Mongol
tribes.  These horse nomads traveled from Asia throughout eastern Europe,
bringing with them exotic customs, goods, and diseases.

The Mongols, of course, had no artisans who could work with ceramics, and
were forced to improvise pipes from the materials they had on hand.
Fragmented accounts indicate that early experiments with dung pipes were
failures (these same accounts, incidentally, provide us with evidence of
both ritual gift-giving to the Khan and detailed descriptions of capital 
punishment under Mongol law).  

Eventually, the mongols found in their travels a suitable material.  The 
discovery came during their westward migration/invasion. Genghis Khan, then
chieftain of all the tribes, had broken his last ceramic pipe (looted from
China) and was inconsolable.  His advisors, fearing the wrath of Khan, sent
scouts in all directions to find a replacement.  Two of the scouts, 
brothers named St'yek and St'yon, were sent into the high passes of the 
Ural Mountains. It being the dead of winter, simply surviving these frigid
heights was a severe test, and a quest such as this was practically a 
suicide mission.    

The full details of their ordeal have not survived in the oral tradition of
the mongols' descendants.  We do know that during their first night above
5,000 feet, their rations froze solid; it was so cold, in fact, that they
couldn't make a spark from their flint fly far enough to light a fire with
which to cook or even thaw their food.  St'yon, we learn, soon died of 
exposure and malnutrition; but St'yek, a more resourceful man, found that
his horse was so numb from the cold that he could carve a chunk of raw meat
from its flank without causing so much as a flinch, and thus he gained 
nourishment to continue his search.  

(I know this is starting to get pretty boring; stick with me, we're almost
there. 8-)

Three weeks later, St'yek's horse bore him back to the tribesmen.  He was
near death; his hands and feet were completely frostbitten, his skin was 
blue, his hair a mass of solid ice.  (His horse, needless to say, wasn't
in particularly good shape itself. )  But in a pouch on his belt was found
a small block of an unusual wood; tight-grained, dense, and strong, the 
pipe-making material the Khan's advisors had sought.  Asked the name of 
this fabulous wood, the shivering St'yek would only respond, "Brrrr.Br'rrr."  

The best woodcarvers were called, and a pipe was fashioned.  The Great Khan
was well pleased!  He described his wooden pipe as, "more pleasurable than
driving your enemies before you, seeing their severed heads lying at your
feet, and hearing the lamentations of their women.  " High praise,indeed.
He ordered that more of this Br'r wood be found, and naturally the lesser
khans soon demanded Br'r pipes of their own.  St'yek had by this time 
recovered consciousness and was able to describe in detail the location of
this vital wood.  Other riders were sent, bringing back supplies of Br'r 
wood and young seedlings, which the mongols took with them and planted at
intervals along their way.  (Nearly two thousand years later this would 
serve as the inspiration for a young Jonathan Wilson, better known as 
"Johnny Appleseed."  ) And of course, the years have transmogrified the 
word "Br'r" into Briar. 

The importance of St'yek's discovery cannot be overstated.  St'yek, as a 
result of his frostbite, lost both hands and both feet.  A man in this 
condition, unable to ride a horse, would normally be abandoned by the 
mongol tribesmen.  But Genghis was so thankful for the young man's 
discovery that he granted him the lands of the south Ukraine and Crimea for
the perpetual use of his family, and gave him the the honorary title, 
"Tartar", meaning "Wood Finder".   Though his contribution to smoking is
nearly forgotten today, the gourmets of the world are more grateful;
St'yek Tartar's name is celebrated on restaurant menus world-wide in honor
of his culinary innovation.

I've been reading Homebrew Digest for a couple of months now, and it seems
pretty flame-free now.  I agree, however, that when the flame is in, reason
goes out.  But an ember or two from time to time can warm upa dry discourse.

Subject: re: Pipes Digest #111 - September 17, 1993

Just a note on the discussion of vintage cigars...Macanudo makes
a range of Vintage Cabinet Selection cigars.  Two years ago I smoked
a box of five vintage 1988.  I'd say that the price--$5 a
cigar--is justified; they are considerably better than your
average 2 or 3 dollar cigar.  But the price is still prohibitive
for me most of the time.

I think aging may have something to do with the quality, but the
main thing is the vintage year.  The box says that in 1988 Macanudo 
acquired an especially good crop of cigar tobacco. 

I'd recommend trying one of them, if you've got 5 bucks you don't
especially need.

Thank you for such a speedy response.  As it happens, I am a Graduate student
at Marquette University, and I have been smoking pipes for about four years
now.  A friend of mine and I decided that because we were studying Philosophy,
it was imperative that we begin smoking pipes.  I have come to see that this
was a wise decision.
	Here in Milwaukee there are two tobacco stores that I enjoy going to:
	1)Uhle's - famous in Milwaukee, for pipes and tobacco.  The tobacco
they sell tends to be dry.
	2)Edward's - up and coming.  The blending they do here is unmatched in
Milwaukee, as far as I know.  Their tobacco tends to be sweeter.  They have an
outstanding variety.

Subject: Consensus Results

The winner is: rec.tobacco

Here's how the votes came in:

	                        1st	2nd	3rd
rec.conoisseur.tobacco   	2	  4	  0
rec.tobacco.X             	0  	  2  	  0
rec.fine-tobacco         	0  	  1	  5
rec.tobacco	              	5  	  0	  1
rec.matchstrikers        	1	  0  	  0
rec.conoisseur.X	        1	  0  	  0

...Where X is an initial split of cigar/pipe subgroups. In nearly all
weightings, rec.tobacco won. Rec.conoisseur.tobacco comes in second.
(Since you were about to start calculating: a weighting of 6/5/1 gives
rec.conoisseur.tobacco the edge.)
    As was always the case, the group will be moderated. We still need a
site that can do the moderating. (Steve, Colin and I will moderate.) I
assume that this will work by setting up a common account that the three
of us have access to, and allowing us to telnet to a machine with that
account. I understand that moderating software is available. If anyone
on the list is able to set up such an account, let me know. It should be
on a site that will be around for a while.

Andy

P.S.: We haven't actually discussed our favorite topic in a while, and
I'd like to give a smoke report: Yesterday I had a perfectly humidified
La Gloria Cubana Soberano. It was almost a cross between a Hoyo de
Monterray Excalibur, and some of the cuban cigars I've had: considerably
more harsh that the Hoyo, but even richer, more complex flavors. This is
the second time I've tried a La Gloria Cubana, and each time I was
impressed. I've been told that the cuban cigars that I've had (and that
I considered _very_ full bodied) are actually mild by cuban standards.
I'm still waiting to try a large, blockbuster cuban smoke.

[ Let us know when you do, Andrew! -S. ]

Subject: CFV: rec.tobacco

                      1st CALL FOR VOTES (of 2)
 
                     Moderated group rec.tobacco
 

Newsgroups line:
rec.tobacco		Fine tobaccos, cigars, pipes, collecting. (Moderated)

Votes must be received by 23:59:59 UTC, 26 Oct 1993.

This vote is being conducted by a neutral third party.  For voting
questions only, contact Mark James &lt;??????@????????.???&gt;.  For questions
about the proposed group, contact any of the proposed moderators.

This CFV is also being sent to the Pipes mailing list 
&lt;?????@????.???????.???&gt;.


MODERATORS
----------

The group would be moderated on a rotating basis by the following
persons:

Colin Crist		(???@??????.??.??.??)
Steve Masticola		(????????@???.???????.???)
Andrew Tepper		(at15+@andrew.cmu.edu)


CHARTER:  The following statement is taken from the proposers.
-------

The rec.tobacco newsgroup provides a forum for discussing the moderate
use and appreciation of fine tobacco, including cigars, pipes, quality
cigarettes, pipe making and carving, snuff, collectible tobacciana,
publications, and related topics. The group is lightly moderated to
prevent flame (except for the purpose of lighting up.)


1.  Etiquette and Moderation Policy

The readers of, and submitters to, rec.tobacco are assumed by this
charter to be mature adults, who can make their own informed choices
regarding tobacco, who are aware of the potential risks of excessive
tobacco use, and who respect the wishes and rights of others, whether
they are smokers or nonsmokers.  Other readers and submitters should
also make the same assumptions.

Rec.tobacco is specifically _not_ a forum for the debate of smoking
versus antismoking issues, bashing, flamage, morality lectures, etc.
Submitters wishing to initiate such discussions will be directed by
the moderators to whatever other newsgroup they deem appropriate.

The purpose of rec.tobacco is to facilitate communication among
fine-tobacco aficionados, not to deny it to others. The moderators
will periodically post a "Frequently Asked Questions" (FAQ) message to
the group, to inform the readers (among other things) of the
newsgroups to which the submitters of bounced messages are suggested
to repost.


2.  Rationale

In brief, there is currently no newsgroup in which those who
appreciate fine tobaccos can gather to discuss their hobby, and
significant demand has been demonstrated for such a group. The
100-plus members of the moderated Pipes Mailgroup
(?????@????.???????.???), and discussions on rec.food.drink and in
news.groups, show that the demand exists for a fine-tobacco newsgroup.

The rec.food.drink discussions, and Elias Mazur's earlier discussions
on news.groups (in 1989, regarding a "rec.pipes" proposal), further
demonstrated that moderation of the group would be needed to prevent
excessive flamage.

The name "rec.tobacco" was chosen after considering many alternative
proposals, in detailed discussion on news.groups and off-line.
Extensive efforts to find a third-level name for the group, and many
suggestions for a third-level name, did not produce a completely
satisfactory result. The name we propose also permits splits, should
the need arise. While "rec.tobacco" is a compromise, we feel that it
is a necessary, and a satisfactory, one.


3.  Special Notes

The following is information for voters, and is not part of the
permanent charter.

Smoking is a controversial, hot-button issue, about which many people
have strong opinions. Many nonsmokers have valid objections to smokers
who do not consider their rights. They are perfectly correct in
objecting to rude behavior. We support their right to object; we also
support mature, considerate behavior on the part of smokers.

However, regardless of one's personal stance on smoking, we believe
that thoughtful people should not vote against this (or any other)
newsgroup simply because they personally disapprove of the subject
matter.  Rather, we hope that the voters will remember the two basic
issues behind newsgroup creation: (a) whether the charter is
well-formed, and (b) whether sufficient interest exists in the subject
of the group.  (The latter is discussed later in the Rationale.) We
hope that you will judge the group on this basis, and on no other.

Along with the proposal for rec.tobacco, we are simultaneously
proposing an unmoderated group, "talk.politics.smoking," for
discussion of the political, legal, health, and social issues
surrounding smoking. The CFV for talk.politics.smoking should also be
posted in the group in which you are reading this. Regardless of
whether talk.politics.smoking passes, there are other (if somewhat
less appropriate) places on the Net for such discussion.  We do not
wish to, and in fact can not, deny anyone their right to speak their
mind on smoking issues.

We simply wish our own place to enjoy and discuss our hobby, in
moderation, and in peace.


STANDARD VOTING INFO
--------------------

You should send E-MAIL (posts to a group are invalid) to:

      ??????@????????.???

(just replying by MAIL to this message should work).  Your mail
message should contain one and only one of the following statements:

      I vote YES on rec.tobacco
or
      I vote NO on rec.tobacco

You may add a comment, or use other wording, but anything other than 
a definite, unconditional, unambiguous statement for or against the
creation of rec.tobacco will be rejected.

If you later change your mind you may vote again; only your last valid
vote will count.  You may also send in an "abstain" vote in the same 
manner, using "abstain" in place of "yes" or "no".  This will cancel
any previous vote.

All votes will be acknowledged by E-mail.  If you don't receive an
acknowledgment within a few days of your vote, vote again.  A list of
any acknowledgment messages that bounce back to me will be posted in a
second Call for Votes article.  (CFV articles will *not* otherwise
contain mass vote acknowledgments.)  The complete vote list will be
posted with the vote result.

Standard Guidelines for voting apply: no more than one vote per person,
no more than one vote per account.  The requirements for group creation
are 100 more YES votes than NO votes, and 2/3 of all votes being YES.

CHARTER

  The talk.politics.smoking newsgroup provides an open forum for
  discussing the political, legal, health, and ethical issues related to
  tobacco smoking. This charter specifically remains neutral on these
  issues.

  Etiquette
  ---------

  The readers of, and submitters to, talk.politics.smoking are assumed by
  this charter to be mature adults, who can make their own informed
  choices regarding smoking, and who respect the wishes and rights of
  others, whether they are smokers or nonsmokers. Other readers and
  submitters should also make the same assumptions. Ad hominem attacks,
  bashing, flamage, morality lectures, etc. are specifically discouraged
  by this charter.


RATIONALE

  In brief, there is currently no newsgroup which is specifically
  dedicated to the issues surrounding tobacco smoking. Discussions on
  this topic periodically appear in almost every newsgroup on the Net,
  and are, for the most part, inappropriate to the group in which they
  appear. A specific, designated place for discussions on
  smoking/nonsmoking issues is badly needed on the Net. Discussion in
  news.groups on the creation of talk.politics.smoking has been mostly
  favorable.

STANDARD VOTING INFO

You should send MAIL (posts to a group are invalid) to

      ?????@????????.??? 

(just replying by MAIL to this posting should work, *if* your
newsreader honors the "Reply-To" line in the article header). Votes
sent to other addresses will be discarded.  Your mail message should
contain one and only one of the following statements:

      I vote YES on talk.politics.smoking
      I vote NO on talk.politics.smoking
      I vote ABSTAIN talk.politics.smoking

You may add a comment, but anything other than a definite statement
involving the group name and "yes", "no", "for", or "against" on a
single line may be rejected by the automatic vote counting program.
If you later change your mind you may send in another vote, which will
automatically supercede all previous votes. "ABSTAIN" votes serve to
cancel previous votes.

Standard Guidelines for voting apply.  For the group to be created,
100 more YES votes than NO votes must be cast, and 2/3 of all valid
votes must be YES votes. "ABSTAIN" votes are not counted in either
calculation; their only role is to cancel previous votes. A single
user may send no more than one vote, no matter how many accounts he or
she might have. Furthermore, a single account may cast only one vote,
no matter how many users may share that account.

Every vote will be acknowledged by EMail. The CFV will be repeated
once; the 2d CFV will contain a "bounce-ack", i.e. a list of people
whose ACK messages bounced when I sent them.

Subject: A story.

	Greetings from Milwaukee.

	You know, you can always tell which way the wind is blowing
downtown, because of the smell in the air.  Actually, it's hard to
tell now if it's coming out of the North, since they took down the
chocolate factory.  When it's out of the East, we can smell the river
- and anything floating therein.  When it's out of the South, we have
the good fortune of catching wind of the progress that they're making
at the tanneries.  (I try to go on a short retreat - anywhere - when
it's out of the South.)  Out of the Southwest we've got a smell that
the people of Milwaukee are divided on - yeast.  Some people like it,
some people don't.  I kind of like it, but it's a lot like listening
to my mother talk: too much makes my head hurt.  (Don't get me wrong -
I love my mother.  If it weren't for her, I never would have tasted a
Guinness or smoked a pipe.)

	Now then, I've got a story to tell, so buckle down and loosen
up.  I have this friend.  Iggy.  His full name is Ignatious Podowa.
No one knows what nationality he is, and most of us are afraid to ask.
He looks a little like an iguana, but he certainly doesn't act like
one, so we just leave his appearances alone, if you know what I mean.
Children are afraid to touch him.  We're not sure why.  He always has
a cigar in his mouth.  I've tried to get him to try a pipe, but he
can't take the cigars out long enough to light a pipe.  That's okay by
me, because I don't want anybody smoking a pipe who doesn't want to,
who can't appreciate it to the fullest.

	Well, now sure enough Iggy wanted to get a dog.  He's not
married, so we all thought it would do him some good.  If children
won't touch him, maybe a dog will.  Or so we thought.  He and I and
Bob Stillman, who can never go ten minutes before he's got to find
toilet, went out in search of a dog for Iggy.  We tried all of the pet
stores.  This didn't work too well, because whenever he went into the
store, all of the birds would start shouting.  I think I even heard
one of the talking birds shout a curse to God.  I assumed it was
cursing God for the life of Iggy.  I was a bit scandalized.  There was
a second problem too.  Whenever Iggy went to pick up one of the dogs,
if there were children in the store, which there almost always were,
they'd cry, as if Iggy were there to rip the little puppies apart.  I
don't think that was ever his intention, although I never asked him.

	Well, we got to the end of our list of places to look at dogs,
when there was only one left.  Iggy had gone through the whole list,
going from place to place with us, never finding a suitable dog.
Either he didn't like the dog, or, more frequently, the dog didn't
like him.  Some of the last few were private homes.  Many of the
people didn't want to let us in once they got a look at Iggy.  This
was sort of a problem, because Bob Stillman had to use a water-closet
pretty badly by the second of third house.  We had a plan to let Bob
go to the door first, petition for the use of the bathroom, whereafter
Iggy and I would stroll up to check out the dog.  But Iggy would have
none of it, because he thought it would seem strange to just knock on
somebody's door, asking to relieve yourself.  Iggy thought it would
lower his chances of getting the dog.

	By the sixth house, nobody was happy.  There was Iggy,
dogless, there was Bob Stillman, holding his crotch, and there I was,
listening to the both of them whine.  Finally, the last house we came
to was owned by a sixty-three year old blind woman.  Her seeing-eye
dog, an AKC Golden Retriever, had apparently been raped by the Chi Tzu
next-door, leaving her with a truly ugly litter that she could barely
find, let alone sustain.  Iggy was thrilled to see that she was blind,
and almost gave out a "Coo!" when he figured it out.  Without waisting
any time, he went over to one of the newborn pups, decided that it
liked him well enough, handed her the money - and did not cheat her
one dollar, I might add, which might be the temptation when dealing
with the blind - and we got out of there in a hurry with Iggy's new
dog.
	What we didn't realize was that Bob Stillman, having reached a
kind of plateau of pain, had also taken advantage of the fact that the
woman was blind by sneaking into her bathroom.  Iggy was so happy to
find a dog, and I was so relieved that I could go home, and Bob
Stillman took such a long time, that we left without him.

	Iggy is fairly happy now that he has a dog.  It's the ugliest
thing I've ever seen in my life.  Iggy doesn't care though, because
the dog likes him too.  Iggy named it "Donaldson," since it kept
sticking its nose in places that it shouldn't be stuck.  Bob Stillman
has not yet told us what happened after we left, but he did have two
bruises on his face the next day.  Maybe someday he'll tell us.

From: "Wade D. Corbett" &lt;???????@??.???.???&gt;
Subject: Havanas - Benchmarking Cigars

Well, folks - I just got back from Toronto where I finally found out
for myself about the Havana Hype.  My purchases included the Montecristo #2,
Romeo y Julieta Churchill, Cohiba Robusto &amp; Esplendido, Simon Bolivar
Corona Gigantes, Partagas Lusitania &amp; Series D #4, and Hoyo de Monterrey
Double Corona - and a few others.  Each cigar that I smoked was quite
different:  I thought the Monty #2 was harsh and overrated.  However,
the Cohiba was without question the very best cigar that I've ever smoked;
it is like smoking creamy chocolate - and it is gorgeous.

To make a long story short, the best place in Toronto to buy cigars is
the Havana House.  They import and distribute Cuban tobacco for all of
Canada.  Ask for Peter Dobbs at the Cumberland St. location, or give him
a call at 416-927-7703.  He may be able to help you plan a tasting.

Please send me e-mail if you have any questions.

Also, to qualify my taste - my favorite house cigar is the Arturo Fuene 8-5-8,
and it's available in claro, natural, and maduro.  All three are quite
different in taste, but have characteristics of coffee with sweet spiciness.
I haven't tried the A. Fuente Canyones, but I think it's similar tobacco,
only in a larger size.  I personally don't like the Hemingways as well -
they burn too quickly being losely rolled, and they have like a nutmeg
spice flavor which is alright, but not as much to my liking as their
Connecticut Shade wrapped smokes.  So, I'd guess you'd say I like a
chocolate coffee cigar that is not harsh or have a bite, has a sweet
spiciness and burns cool, and is a joy to watch burn with a silky wrapper.
IMHO, the 8-5-8 is gorgeous. 

And last night I smoked an Aliados Piramide which was almost like a
torpedo-shaped Cohiba...

[ Great info, Wade! -S. ]

And, as many of you commented, the Digest hasn't been sent out in some
time. I'd been holding off until the voting was complete on the
proposed Big 7 newsgroups, rec.tobacco and talk.politics.smoking.
Unfortunately, neither of them passed. I've excerpted the final
results below.

However, those of you who can receive it should check out alt.smokers.
Although it's an unmoderated group with low distribution, there are
still discussions of a fine-tobacco nature to be joined. I'll be
posting a call for participation in the Pipes Mailgroup there every
month or so.

And don't forget: Election Day in the U.S. is tomorrow, so don't
forget to vote! And enjoy your favorite tobak afterward. As always,

				Smoke in peace,

Subject: armchair pipes

(Yes, I'm still ???????@???.???????????.???, but I'm trying out a  
different account.)

I was asked about making an armchair pipe, but I've never heard of  
such a specimen.  Is it simply another name for the long,  
churchwarden pipes?

Subject: Traveling and Some Notes

Hello all,

I just wanted to introduce myself to the group, and drop a few notes about 
my recent travels.
First of all I'm a 32 year old computer consultant, from Suburban Detroit 
and have been happily smoking a pipe and
little else since I was 15.   Over that time I've garnered a collection of 
well over 100 high-grades
to seconds, that I rotate through as the mood strikes.  In my job, I travel 
about quite a bit and
want to report on some pipe shops I've visited:

Cut 'N Puff - Fifth Street, Moline, IL
Visiting my sister in Davenport, I've stopped by this store several times.  
The proprietor keeps an excellent selection
of high-grades and mid-priced pipes as well a good selection of 
accessories.  I'm happy to report that here I purchased
my first Charatan.  It's a medium-sized canadian, and smokes EXCEPTIONALLY 
well.  I'm very, very pleased.  

The atmosphere of this shop is extremely friendly.  Local folk are always 
popping in filling up their pipes, or selecting
among a large cigar assortment and swapping stories of the local trade.  
The only thing that's a bit different about this
shop is that it accepts no credit cards of any kind.  That can be a bit 
daunting for the traveler, since I rarely carry cash.
Fortunately, there's a money-machine located conveniently across the 
street.

Up In Smoke - Galleria Mall, Dallas TX
This is a nice little store with a friendly staff and an exceptional 
selection of Peterson's and a number of Tim West pipes.
They've got a nice selection of accessories, and good tobacco selection.  
Again, I picked up a nice prize, a Peterson Oom-Paul without
a metal band. (I'm not fond of the metal fittings on most Petersons, and 
when I find one that doesn't have one, it is usually a keeper).
I also picked up a pouch of their Vanilla Supreme which proved to be very 
satisfying.

AA Tobacco Barn - El Toro Rd, El Toro, CA
While visiting my other sibling in LA, I stopped at this nice little shop.  
They've recently moved from an older location and the
renovations are quite nice, although the shop is much smaller.  Their 
specialty is in fine high-grades.  They've got a number
of Savinelli signatures as well as Dunhills.  A little pricey for my 
tastes, but always nice to look.  If you stop by, be sure to
see the Giant Full-Bent Peterson that was made for Alfred Hitchcock.  Its 
an amazing piece of work.

As always, I'm eager to hear about places to visit when I travel, so please 
drop a line when you find a special place.
 
Regards,

Rob

Subject: Smoke Report: Nat Sherman Cigars

I went to NYC 2 weeks ago and stopped at Nat Sherman. After hearing good
things about their cigars on the net I bought a sampling in sizes from
Robusto to Churchill. (I skipped the thinner shapes.) So far I have
tried three, and overall have been a bit disappointed.

Let me first describe their store: I could not imagine a more pleasant
place to buy fine cigars and accessories. Downstairs is a small room
staffed by several people who know their products perfectly. After
selecting a half dozen smokes from their cabinet humidors the
salesperson suggested I look into some of their vintage cigars upstairs.
The upper level was a beautiful smoking lounge with additional display
cases of accessories. It contained a large walk-in humidor, and we
headed inside. The smell was fantastic, and the selection enormous. I
was told that some customers buy boxes of a favorite vintage of cigar (5
box minimum) and keep them inside the humidor to be removed as needed. I
selected another 3 cigars and was on my way.

That evening after dinner I headed to the '21' Club for cognac and a
cigar. I had a Nat Sherman Gotham Selection (and splurged for a glass of
Louis XIII cognac!) The cigar had only a bit of harshness, but certainly
not as light as a Macanudo. Maybe my expectations were too high, but
there was just nothing distinctive about it. My score:75

A few days later I tried a Nat Sherman Landmark Selection. This cigar
was the best of the three I've had. It had a much richer, more aromatic
flavor. Again, very little harshness for such a flavorful smoke. My
score:85

Tonight I tried a Nat Sherman Manhatten Selection. This seemed like a
spicy version of the first, and did have some distinctive character.
Still, the "ash" flavor (I've never heard that term used before to
describe cigars!) predominated. It got quite harsh toward the end. My
score:81

I'm still looking forward to the vintage cigars I bought from their
upstairs humidor, but overall I was expecting better, more distinctive
tobaccos. Guess I'll have to go to Canada for those. :)

Andy

[ Let us know if you do, Andy! -S. ]

Subject: intro

 My name is Zoltan Farkas, I'm a junior student of Computer Engineering &amp;
 Science at the University of Veszprem, Hungary.For my grandfather is 
 (among others) a carver, pipes and other carvings have always been a part
 of my life, though I didn't smoke until the age of 18.
  Pipe smoking has rich traditions in Hungary, the habit originates from
 the 17th century,when, due to Habsburg influence, the Nobility began to 
 smoke. They've always preferred Western European (especially French) pipes
 and tobaccoes, while the poorer classes smoked claypipes and used terrible
 home-grown weeds.As with tobacco, situation remained the same;we smoke 
 imported Dutch and Swedish tobaccoes, while most of the pipes available
 here are Hungarian. Some words about the prices:a simple pipe costs $6-12,
 price of quality pipes range from $80 to infinity, Hungarian tobacco costs
 $0.70-$1,while imported ones cost $2.20-$5.
   As with my interests, I love history, especially pre-history, and 
 literature. My favourite writers are Hemingway, Robert Merle, and above all,
 J.R.R.Tolkien.I'm a pipe carver also (though beginner, very enthusiastic) who
 would like to learn more about different techniques and designs.
   for the moment that's all,
			Smoke in peace,Zoltan

Subject: New Pipes Digest member questions

Hello Steve- I received Pipes Digest #114 yesterday, and thoroughly
enjoyed it- thanks for adding me on.

I have already voted for the tobacco newsgroup- I am keeping my
fingers crossed.

Are there any FAQs for Pipes Digest?  What is in/out of bounds as far
as this group?

Is there a way to access pass issues of PD?  Are they stored in a
computer I can get access to?

I appreciate your help.

Oh- one more question- are you the editor of PD?  Are you the one I
contact for questions?

Thanks for your help.  

Go Rec. Tobacco!!!

[ Sorry, Zoltan, there's no formal FAQ, though we do have a Resource
Guide and a "How-to" guide for the beginning pipe smoker. Does anyone
feel energetic enough to help get a full FAQ together? -S. ]

Subject: Re[2]: New Pipes Digest member questions

 Hi Steve- thanks for getting back to me so quickly.


- I can mail you the past issues; just let me know how far back you want
to go.
- I'm the moderator of the Pipes Digest.

I don't want to create too much of a burden.  I would be interested in
the past year if possible.

My interests focus mainly on cigars.  How about yourself?

Do you know if the Cigar Aficionado magazine has an E-mail address?
There are a couple of suggestions/questions I have and I would love to
fire them off- snail mail is just too much of a hassle.

Thanks for your help Steve.

Keep puffin'
Tom

[ Well, I mainly smoke pipes, with the odd cigar once in a while.
Sorry, Tom, but I don't think C.A. has an email address. And, BTW,
it's no trouble to send all the back issues -- though they do take up
a fair amount of space. -S. ]

Hey Steve, I haven't received a digest since #114 on october 5!!

I just wanted to comment on how personal cigar preferences really are
and why I dislike the ratings in the cigar aficionado magazine. I've
been smoking a lot of different cigars for the last few months since
fuente hemingway's became unavailable. These BTW are my favorites but
in a previous pipe digest someone mentioned that they prefered regular
fuentes to hemingways, the same thing happened when I called Famous in
NY, art suggested I buy regular fuentes as they were very similar,
however I can tell the difference just by the aroma if someone else is
smoking across the room.

Similarly I bought Pleidaes (overpriced and overrated, in the next issue
they fell more than ten points), Hoyo de Monterey excalibur (very nice,
strong coffee and nutmeg flavor), some Punch which i also enjoyed very
much and finally the Aliados piramide which I also considered to be 
overpriced, they had a very strange flavor, harsh but flavorless if
you know what I mean but I may just have received a bad box because
the last tasted better than the first ones, certainly not like
cohibas though.

I have resorted to my fallback of smoking Upmanns, my second favorite
and of which I consider their petit coronas to be probably the finest
examples of that size at any price. One comment I have is that after
moving to the tropics from Utah the flavors are quite a bit different,
I don't know it is the humidity, the altitude or what but I find any
cigar here has a much richer taste, more personality and much more
complex flavor profile, maybe my cigars where just drying out in
Utah???
ciao

A lot of membership activity this week! Welcome, all! I took the
liberty of mailing to all the people who'd voted "Yes" for
rec.tobacco, but who weren't already members of the mailgroup. And
therein lies the Tale of the Compunerd.

When I do mass mailings, I usually use a blind carbon copy. Well, this
time, the mailer here hung, and retried every hour to send the
invitation to someone. And every time it retried, it sent not to just
that Special Someone, but to a lot of other people... had people on
two continents mad. Ah, nothing like coming in in the morning to face
an intercontinental technodiplomatic crisis...

Well, that's over, and I'm sorry for deluging the unfortunate people
on the list with mail. If you're having any problems, please let me
know. BTW, I'm converting from a BCC to individual mailings per
person. Lots less potential for horrible disaster... :-)

In any case, light one up, kick back, and enjoy! -S.

Steve,

Ah well, we failed !

Thanks to you (and if you pop this in the next digest) to all who had
a hand in the attempt to for the smoking newsgroup. The closeness of
the vote shows that we are doing something right !

Anyway, now that all this discussion and campaigning is over I think
I shall have my last Nat Sherman Carpe Diem tonight and perhaps
a glass (or maybe two ;-) of port. I suppose the best thing that has 
come out of all this is that the pipes newsgroup has lots more members!

Thanks again !

Colin.

(PS - I am moving from BT soon as I have a new contract back in London
so if any mail bounces is a few weeks then I've moved and I'll 
email you with my new address as soon as possible)

[ Path changed, Colin... and we didn't exactly fail, in a larger
sense. The Mailgroup increased its size by about 60% as a result of
the newsgroup proposal. Hope you enjoyed the cigar. -S. ]

Subject: Tobacco tax increases

Hello everybody-

My name is Tom Zweng.  I just signed on to the Pipes Digest this past issue.

I smoke cigars, but I enjoy reading about pipes/tobacco as well.

I came across an interesting article in the NY Times Newspaper from Saturday, 
Oct 30th.

It discussed the proposed tax increases on both cigar and pipe tobacco that the 
Clinton administration is suggesting.

Presently, the Federal "large cigar" tax is 3 cents.  That will increase to 12 
cents a cigar.  The Fed pipe tobacco tax will increase 1,852% for a total of 
$13/lb!!!  The article didn't mention the present pipe tobacco tax, but those 
of you with a good math base will be able to figure it out from the numbers I 
just gave you.

The article goes on to talk about other issues related to cigar smokers and 
includes a short interview with Lew Rothman, president of  J.R. Rothman, the 
nation's largest cigar catalog dealer.  According to Rothman, our Prez smokes 
Arturo Fuente 19-12s.  He has a box shipped every 4-5 weeks.  To quote Mr 
Rothman: "Somebody else pays, or his wife gets mad."  No surprisde there!!!

I'm glad to be aboard- I've enjoyed what I have read so far.

[ $13/lb?!?!?! Addresses of Congresscritters are available upon
request. Grrrr! -S. ]

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #115 - November 1, 1993

Steve:

All cigar smokers on the mailing list should read an article in the
Saturday, Oct. 30, New York Times on taxes and cigars.  It was really a
chance to get some great cigar stuff in there, while the tax stuff
convinced the editors to run it. :)

&lt;drum roll please&gt;  Here are the brands President Clinton likes: Arturo
Fuente 19-12s ($1.75 each) and Trafalgar 4 ($5 each).  The latter being
too expensive for me, has anyone tried the former?

And, BTW, George Burns smokes El Productos, which he gets for free,
because he's on stage, talking most of the time, his agent says.  "A good
cigar, you have to keep smoking it so it doesn't go out," he says.  "Cheap
cigars keep burning."

Ah, the wisdom one must accumulate by 97...

Todd

[ If anyone saved the article, I'd much appreciate a hardcopy. -S. ]

Hi everyone.

Here's a little bit about me.  I'm a 23 year old electrical engineering
student (fourth year at Waterloo).  I've loved the smell of a pipe being
smoked for as long as I can remember.  I tried smoking a pipe when I was
16 and liked it, but wondered where I could enjoy such a "mature" habit as
a highschool student.  I haven't really smoked a pipe since then but am
interested in starting up again.  I think I've seen one other person on
campus smoking a pipe at one of the bars.  Are there any younger pipe
smokers out there?

Steve, could you send me the "How-to" guide and a few (10) back issues
of the digest?

Thanks.

Dave

[ Sent, I hope... -- and welcome! -S. ]

Subject: Smokin'

Hi Paul, and everyone!  Thank yoiu for responding so quickly to my request.  I
have enjoyed smoking pipes casually for a few years now, and I wanted to connect
with  other pipe smokers.  I am a college student at    Loyola of Chicago, and I
am interested in discussing differrent sorts oftobaccos, and pipes, as I am
fairly new to the subject.  I have been smoking pipes for about three   ars now.
years now.  I am particularly interested in different sorts of blends in
tobaccos, and being able to decide what I would best enjoy.

          Thanks!  @:`)

Subject: Thanks for the "endorsement"

&gt;However, those of you who can receive it should check out alt.smokers.
&gt;Although it's an unmoderated group with low distribution, there are
&gt;still discussions of a fine-tobacco nature to be joined. I'll be
&gt;posting a call for participation in the Pipes Mailgroup there every
&gt;month or so.
        As the creator of alt.smokers, I'd like to thank you for encouraging 
your readers to read (and also hopefully to contribute to) the group. I have 
been disappointed at the amount of flame traffic going on lately (although I 
should have known this would happen), and have even been thinking of closing it 
down if things do not improve. But now that I've seen this measure of support 
from you, I will keep it open. I look forward to seeing posts from your readers 
which will help to cut through the flame curtain.

        This is intended as a personal message to the moderator, but if you 
feel it would be appropriate, feel free to include it in the digest.

exhibits tendencies toward smoker bashing qualifies. I guess there's
about 50% legitimate interest and 50% flamage. Hopefully, some of our
Hardy Perennials can help remedy that situation... -S. ]

organic. I wounder why the big tobacco companies don't offer organic.
Does anyone else out there have any seeds for other tobacco varieties?

[ Don't know about homegrown, but you might try the "American Spirit"
folks. Bill Thacker, the inventor of the Feckless FAQ, did contribute
a longish series on growing your own. Not for the fainthearted... -S. ]

Subject: Intro..

Greetings..

Another new subscriber!  Glad to be here..

A quick rundown on who I am..the computer sys admin at a small
manufacturing firm in one of Milwaukee's northwestern suburbs;
previously a programmer/consultant at the University of Wisconsin-
Milwaukee.

I quit smoking cigarettes around 6 years ago and I'm glad I did.
Since then I have an occasional cigar, usually something *real*
cheap.  I dabbled a bit in smoking a pipe, but at the time, never
had much peace of mind at home to spend the time to do it right
(I'm divorced now, thank goodness :) ).  Also tried the "pinch
between cheek and gum" approach to using tobacco - but it gave 
me nasty hiccups. 

This past June I spent two weeks vacationing in the Florida Keys,
and while visiting Key West stumbled (literally) into the Key
West Cigar Factory.  What the hell, I'll buy a couple..well,
they were so fresh and such a joy to smoke that I bought a few
more, asking for "the freshest, longest and fattest you have my 
friend".

I settled into a 1 cigar-a-day pattern and started reading CA (I'm
a wine collector so I was already curious from reading about CA
in the Wine Spectator).  There are a couple of places in Milwaukee
which have a good selection of cigars.  Unfortunately, they're a
long way from where I live (across town).  It turns out that one
of the tobacconists, Uhle's, distribute to grocery and drug
stores, of which, one is 5 minutes from my home so I'm able to find
nearly everything I need there.  

But when I happen to be on the east side of town, I always stop in at 
Edward's, a very nice shop (mentioned previously in Digest #110 or #111) 
since they stock Fuente Hemingways which my nearby drug store does not.

My favorite cigars?

Fuente is the producer that I've been most impressed with for being
consistently good and reasonably priced.  I've tried quite a number
of different styles and have enjoyed them all.  Their 8-5-8 is my
usual day-to-day cigar with the larger Hemingway being my favorite
cigar, hands-down. 

I like Hoya de Monterey Excalibers, and Ashton Churchills are always a
delight.  Partegas are pretty good, but I've had a couple that were
nasty.  Macanudo (sp?) are ok, but I've had a few where the draw was
tough as nails.  Dunno if my snipping technique is flawed or the cigar
was wound up too tight.  An 8 1/2" Punch Churchill is a great wake-me-
upper - what a blast.

Recently, I've been trying H. Uppman's and have been favorably impressed.
Also waiting anxiously for the 12 Churchills that are being shipped
to me.  In the September 20 (or thereabouts) issue of the Wine Spectator,
H. Uppman had what sounded like a great promotional offer: 12 Churchills
in a nice case for $10.  Well, they've cashed the check according to my
bank statement, so they should be here any day now - heh, heh, heh. 

Have never had the opportunity to try Cohibas, Cuban Uppman's, 
Montechristo's, or any of the other Cuban cigars.  It's not keeping
me up nights, so...

Ok, I guess I've droned on enough.  

regards,

-mm

Subject: Re: Invitation to join the Pipes Mailgroup

Hi everyone!

I'm lucky enough to live near a fine tobacco shop in State College, PA
called Tobacco Tavern.  They cook up some very fine flavors here, let me
tell you!  Also available is a large selection of pipes.  Cigars and fine
cigarettes are also sold.  In the 10 or so years since I've been smoking a
pipe, my favorite it my Jefapip with my Hilson Fantasia coming in close
behind.  I think the two are totally different because the Jefapip is French
and Briar; it's fairly light to hold with the teeth, too.  The Hilson, on
the other hand, is meerschaum lined and very heavy.  Too heavy for the
teeth!  So it sits on my desk a lot.

My favorite tabacs are Tobacco Tavern's Blackberry Brandy (!), Vanilla,
Smoker's Delight, Olde Cherry, and Sugar and Spice.  Call or write Tobacco
Tavern; they mail stuff out daily, I think.  814-237-8252 or 256 Calder Way,
State College, PA 16801.

May your lighter always work,

Scottie

[ Thanks for the notes about Tobacco Tavern. Sounds like a must-see!

Subject: Re:  Invitation to join the Pipes Mailgroup

	
Hello, Steve, thanks for putting me on the mailing list.  I've been
smoking pipes for about twelve years, and I've been smoking the odd
cigar since I joined the army (troops apparently don't take kindly
to officers who smoke pipes -- they think it's stuck-up, so the pipe
smokers in the mess smoke cigarettes or cigars around the troops).
Because tobacco taxes are so high in Canada (over 50%) I buy most
of my tobacco products in the States or in duty-free, which is why
I talk about buying stuff in so many different places.  The shops
I refer to are all about one day's drive from the border along
various major interstate highways.
	
	For starters, why not take a few minutes and tell us
	about yourself by return mail? We'd like to hear about your
	preferences in 

	pipes, 

Right now, I'm chewing on a graceful little hook made by Connaisseur
in New York.  Beautiful briar, great shape, draws poorly.  My two 
favourites are a Canadian made by Charatan, and a hook by Ben Wade.
I also have, somewhere, a late '60's Dunhill, very slender and unlike
their later stuff, that I slide into my hosetop right beside my
sgian dubh for formal Scottish events.

I do a lot of historical re-creation, and I smoke clays there.  My
favourite was bought at Plimoth Plantation; but it went the way of
all clays.  I still have the pieces somewhere...

	tobacco, 

I'm an English fan.  I smoke Balkan Sobranie by preference, Dunhill's
standard mild as well.  I can also reccommend Scott Ziegler of 
Kalamazoo Michigan, who makes a Sobranie knockoff called Balkan Shag,
which isn't shag, but is very nice.  Right now I am working on a kilo
of medium English I bought at Tobaccoland in Mill Creek Mall, Erie,
Pennsylvania, two years ago and lost.  I found it a couple of months
ago, still in ziplocs and only a little bit dried out.  A bit of 
water from a spray bottle, and it's nearly good as new.  

Recently, while making a connection through Copenhagen airport (which
has a great Peterman shop) a stunning young lady sold me a tin of 
Danish stuff (which I hate), but ... well ... she was just so pretty.
And she gave me a nice little Tokai pipe lighter and a pipe tool;
so I can recommend Denmark highly for one thing.

	shops, 

I mentioned Ziegler's in Kalamazoo, and Tobaccoland in Erie.  There's
also Briar Route in Rochester (Marketplace Mall), which has sadly 
gone way downhill; and my favourite of all time, Continental on 
Murray Ave. in Pittsburgh.  Ivan, the owner, is very good at blending
his own knockoffs of name brands, and customising them to individual
customers.  I owe him some Cuban cigars next time I'm down there.
In Toronto there's Havana House, which is great for cigars, but no
longer very good for pipe tobacco or pipes; and Winston and Holmes,
which is too expensive.

If you ever have time and money, the basement of the Royal York Hotel
in Toronto is home to Julius Vesz, who makes gorgeous pipes.  His
address there is 100 Front St. W., Toronto.

Cheers,

Aryk Nusbacher

In Pipes Digest #116, Our Esteemed (and Esmoked) Moderator asked us:

As one of the first to post cigar-related material to this list, I
must say, I don't see the need.  Unlike some fora I could name,
no one here as ever made me feel unwelcome for being so eccentric
as to actually prefer cigars.  While the name doesn't explicitly
say so, the ambience here is definitely tolerant and accepting,
and new subscribers never seem to be long in seeing that the subject
is really fine tobaccos, whatever the form.

&gt;[ Any thoughts on this? -S. ]

Vulcanite (hard rubber) mouthpieces discolour from of the sulpher,
used as an anti-oxidant, leaching to the surface.  It is possible to
polish it off, using successively finer buffing compounds and a good,
soft buffing wheel, but the potential for rounding off the sharp edges
is great.  Better is to use 400 and 600 grit wet-or-dry paper to get 
the stem clean, taking off as little material as necessary, and then 
use the wheel for final buffing, being cautious not to damage the edges.

For the past couple of years, I have been using household bleach for this 
task.  This is only advisable on some stems, as dicussed later.  The bleach 
restores the colour, but leaves the surface quite rouch, so requiring 
polishing.  Again, a wheel with very fine compound is the best tool.  
(I don't have the patience to use the Dunhill mouthpiece polish for this!)

Dunhill stems respond very well to the bleach, as do many old stems.  I
have found, howver, that Saseini dots tend to dissolve, and the cement
which adheres GBD and (old) BBB logos will not stand the test of bleach,
and the older Comoy "C", which is actually made from white and black rod-
stock, doesn't take kindly to the process, either.  Obviously, painted 
logos and insigniae (later Comoy, Charatan, Stanwell, &amp;c) should be kept
away from the bleach.  For all stems apart from Dunhill, I simply stand 
them upright in the bleach with the logo out of harm's (bleach's ;) way!
Overnight, they turn dull black and are ready for the final polish.  THe
bleach also has the advantage of removing any built up residues inside the
stem!

The best treatment is prevention.  Keep your pipes out of the light as
much as possible, and use a good polish, like the Dunhill, frequently.
If your body chemistry is particularly acidic, you'll have to try to 
keep the mouthpieces dry as well.  I find that making a good stem rubdown
with a paper towel part of my apre' smoke cleaning ritual, I can, for the
most part, avoid the oxidation before it becomes problem.  

Cheers,
Gregory

I've seen Pipe shops take a cloth wheel and go at the stem with (i think)
jeweler's rouge.

Subject: Name Change

Guys, there seems to be a lot of cigar activity on the newsgroup these
days. Perhaps it's time for a name change? If you have an opinion,
and/or an idea for a new name, please let us know! In the meantime,
may your matches always be dry and may your mailer never bite you.

                                        Smoke in peace,
                                        ~\U Steve.

No!  traditionally speaking of course.  Cigars are welcome
(in fact,  the discussions have prompted me now to pick up
a cigar or 6 when I buy my shag,)  but with all the cigar
talk,  the only thing Bill Thacker can get in is a little
bit about the PIPES faq.

Hi, Steve:

Why not call it the Pipes and Cigars Digest?

Also, I have two questions:

-- Does anyone know if the United States is the only nation with a ban on
Cuban cigars?  I understand you can legally buy them in Canada.  Is it
then illegal to bring them back into the U.S.?  Is it illegal for a
Canadian business to send Cuban cigars to individuals in the U.S.?

-- Could the gentleman who mentioned the $10 offer for Churchills give
us the address and other details so we can take advantage of this?  :)

Todd 

[ Well, I've seen Cuban cigars in Canadian duty-free shops, so someone
must _want_ you to bring them back... Also, re the name change, I
think I'm going to just be content with the change to the writeup, for
now. -S. ]

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #116 - November 5, 1993

Hi Steve. 

Let me introduce myself. My name is Henry Lai and despite my
email address, I live in Montreal, not San Diego. I am basically
a cigarette smoker but I occassionally indulge in cigars. I have
never tried a pipe, though my father and grandfather both used to
smoke pipes so I've very accustomed to the aroma. I'm not a connisseur
of cigars and know very little about them except what I like. The ones
I like most were made by Uppman, though I don't recall what the exact
cigar was. I had a Davidoff cigar about ten years ago that I really
enjoyed (...and enjoyed, it lasted quite a while). Again, I don't recall what
cigar, except that it was very long, about 10-12" (perhaps called the
"Imperial" or something like that???).

I get the impression that cigarette smoking is somewhat of a taboo subject
here and a no-no for pipe afficiandos.

Subject: Re: Invitation to join the Pipes Mailgroup

Steve- I would love to have whatever back issues of the pipe digest you
can forward- yes, all of them if possible!

Now, my self-introduction ( I assume that you are cutting and pasting on
this for the digest.)

I'm delighted to join the list, which I would never have found out about had
it not been for the ill-fated attempt to establish the new tobacco list on
usenet.  I started out as a pipe smoker, although in recent years I have
tended to smoke cigars more than pipes.  I would never give up any of my
little wooden prizes, however.  I'm sure that others on the list share my
consternation about the impending enormous tax hikes.  My advice is stock
up now- under the right conditions, both smoking tobacco and cigars will
keep for a long time.

Personal preferences- for pipe tobacco, blends that either play down or
avoid the strong latakias, and NO fruit flavored syrupy additives thank
you!  The McClelland blends are about the best packaged blends I have
found produced in this country.

As for cigars, I have tried most everything except for some of the rare
pre-revolution cubans allegedly squirreled away by the greatest of
afficianados.  From my purchases in Europe, I must contend that
even present day cuban brands are superior to anything else, even if they
are sometimes rolled miserably.  Personally, I would put a large Cuban
Montecristo up against anything.  Since we can't get them in the U.S., I
would suggest that fanciers consider the product coming out of the Canary
Islands.  Sure, it is terribly uneven, but overall these cigars have
gotten a bad rap.  They are somewhat tame for inveterate cuban or honduras
fans, but have a subtlety lacking in most brands available in the U.S. 
The Dunhills produced in the Canary Islands (If you can find them) are
excellent.

[ Did I forward the back issues? I forget now... welcome, anyway! -S. ]

Subject: Cheap pipe kits

American Science &amp; Surplus is selling Carve Your Own Pipe Kits
(#10635) in their October 1993 catalog for $4.75 each.  We have
purchased kits from them before, and they are of moderate quality.
The kit includes a block of Corsican briar 1.5" x 1.5 " x 1.75" with
about a 1 1/16" bowl that tapers to the hole on the bottom.  This
hole leads outside where a 5.5" black vulcanite stem may be inserted.
Be aware that this stem is inserted directly into the pipe w/o space
between the newly carved heel and the joint for the mouthpiece.  It
just makes the bowl seem even larger when stuck to the straw-like
mouthpiece.  The article also warns that some of these square edges
may have been beveled off.  I didn't want to invest in an expensive
pipe carving kit until my wife (the family carver) saw that it was
something she could do.  (Her comment was that she never realized
briar was really that hard, and she wanted to know if her church-
wardens were made of the same kind of rock.)  ASci&amp;Surp (watch the
abrev.) can be reached by mail or in person at 3605 Howard Street in
Skokie, IL 60076; by phone at (708) 982-0870; or FAX (800) 934-0722.
They have a $10 minimum order and will accept MC, Visa, Money Order,
Checks, and quantities of unique toys, gizzmos, and young children.
They buy a fixed quantity so supply is not guarenteed.

Subject:  Polishing Stems                       Time:8:15 AM     Date:11/8/93
       &gt;I have a question for the membership...Even though I've been smoking
       &gt;and collecting pipes for twenty years I have'nt figured out a 
       &gt;satisfactory way to clean and polish mouthpieces.  I have tried
       &gt;Dunhill mouthpiece polish and often it means I have shiny but still 
       &gt;discolored stems.  I was thinking about trying siome automotive type
       &gt;rubbing compound.  I would appreciate any suggestions or advice.
       &gt;???????@???????.?????.??? 717 291-3843  Thanks

When I worked in the trade (Wally Frank shop in Paramus, NJ in the late '70's)
we had a double buffing wheel set up in the shop which we used to polish
bakelite stems. We used Cannuba (sp?) wax on one wheel and kept the other clean
to buff with. This wax is similar to jeweler's rouge in that it is a mild
abrasive like rubbing compound. I found that some discoloration could be
removed with this set-up but severe cases would retain that olive drab tone
after the best workout. I also found that the stems which were allowed to
oxidize the most were the hardest to keep polished. There must be some
cascading effect on the breakdown of the stem material.

Moral: keep those stems well polished. Once they start to get a crystalline
appearance they will need to be replaced because they won't retain their retain
their color or finish any longer.

Subject: Post to Pipes Digest.

Greetings Steve and Group, 

I'm a system software specialist at the University of Pittsburgh.  
I quit smoking cig's back in 1975.  I'll ocasionally smoke a "good"
cigar, but haven't really settled into any discernable pattern.  
The world is still my oyster when it comes to choice, except for
Cuban :^).  I've noticed that Fuente is one brand that keeps being
mentioned on the list.  Interestingly, this was the first brand in-
troduced to me.  The tobacconist offered it as a good mild cigar.
For an all tobacco smoke, the $0.75 Fuente "throw-aways" are a great
buy.  Although these are mixed short and long cut filler I've never
had a bad one.  If I've got the time then I'll light up and savor a 
Dunhill.  

Does anyone have any tips on making your own (cigar) humidor?  I'd
like to build my own, cedar lined, of course.  Any info is helpful.

Unfortunately, not everyone can receive the Usenet alt.smokers news-
group.  There are some very interesting threads of conversation there.
BTW, how soon will rec.tobacco have another chance at creation? 

If any readers in the Pittsburgh area have the time, I recommend a 
visit to Jernigan's Tobacco Village in the South Hills Village Mall. 
Stop by and see Rich for some interesting conversation and a few 
great smokes.  They carry a complete line of accessories and have a
walk-in humidor.  Ahhh, the aroma...

Subject: Introduction

&gt; We'd like to hear from you, and hope you'll help us to keep the
&gt; mailgroup going. For starters, why not take a few minutes and tell us
&gt; about yourself by return mail?

Surely.  I enjoyed the latest edition you sent me, and I hope that the
volume does not become so much that I can't handle it.  It's not like
I have a whole lot of spare time for yet another mailing list/newsgroup.

To my surprise, I find yet another list/group I share with this fellow ...
&gt; Bill Thacker             AT&amp;T Network Systems       attmail!att!cbemf!wbt
Considering his company will soon own my company, I should drop him a
line.

I'm 30-something, and have been smoking since I was 21, when a friend
who was a clerk at a smoke shop brought me a few free samples, cut some
of them open, and explained to me the nuances of different cigars, and
what differentiates a good cigar from a bad one.  Since that time, I've
been a regular cigar smoker, an occasional pipe smoker, and a cigarette
smoker at work.

I generally smoke one Romeo&amp;Julieta a day, in the evening after dinner
along with a suitable beverage.  I'll occasionally smoke Dunhill Juniors,
as well.  For social situations where a larger cigar is not appropriate,
but I still want to enjoy a good smoke, I'll bring along a tin of
Danneman Imperials, a cigarillo.  They have the added advantage of being
a dry cigar, not requiring humidor-storage.  Perhaps someone can explain
that to me, as I never understood it.

I order cigars (by phone) from the following shop in Scottsdale, AZ :

Ford &amp; Haig Tobacconist
7076 E. 5th Ave
Scottsdale, Arizona
(602)-946-0608

I enjoy browsing through the humidor, but unfortunately this shop is
many miles from my house, and I've seen the cigar shops in this city
gradually close down over the last several years, so I think this is
the only 'full featured' tobacco shop left in the county.  I'm open
to trying new cigars, and perhaps this list will give me some ideas.
But so far, I haven't found any better combination of flavor and price
than the Romeo's.

Subject: New member views

Greetings!

First of all I'd like to thank you for the invitation to join this mail
list.  While I am NOT a cigarette smoker, I do enjoy the occasional cigar.
And this seems like a great way to learn about the wide variety.  I am
more interested in personal reviews, hence I don't get C.A.

Since I only smoke a few dozen per year, I am really interested in the
top quality cigars.  Also, I prefer "Churchill" size.  Hey, I'm a big
guy and it fits well.  So I'm looking forward to trying the Arturo Fuente
Hemingway this week.

The vast majority of my cigar smoking is on the golf course.  I'm always
aware of the wind direction.  It provides a distraction so that I don't
"over-think" about the game.  And it's a superior method of bug repellant,
certainly more pleasure than spraying DEET on my face!

But the problem I have is: What kind of lighter can be tossed around in
the bag (all orientations) and not leak, yet be reliable in breezy or even
down-right windy conditions?

Subject: Re:  Invitation to join the Pipes Mailgroup

Dear Steve and others in the group,

yes, I'd be happy to join the mailgroup.

To present myself, I'm a 25 year old mathematician from Denmark, just
about to finish my PhD in Tokyo, Japan. My life as a pipesmoker began
in highschool when I was 16. In Denmark, it is not unusual at all to
smoke (pipe) at that age, and to tell the truth I never had anything
but pleasure from smoking until I stayed in the USA for six months
last year. To me as a foreigner, all this antismoking hysteria seems
a little out of proportion with the problems I thought to see in the
american society. - As a contrast, here in Japan, you can smoke just
about anywhere, but pipe tobacco is hard to find and very expensive.
	
I'd like to ask a question to all you experienced pipe smokers. Any
hints on how to avoid swallowing (small amounts of) acid due to humid
pipe smoke? I don't think this is linked to be tobacco brand, since
all fresh tobacco contain a certain amount of humidity, but maybe to 
the pipe?

					Best regards, 
					Carl Winsl\ow.

on tobacco, and even in the very childhood of this art, seven years before
it became legal in France. Here is an approximate translation into (some
sort of) English: 
"Regardless of what Aristoteles (?) and all the philosophers might say,
there is nothing like tobacco; it's the passion of honnest people, and
who lives without tobacco is not worthy of living. Not only does it 
please and purify the human brain, it also teach virtue to the soul, and
with it one learns to become an honest man."

to be a pipe smoker. Thanks for the quote! -S. ]

The alt.smokers postings are generating quite a bit of interest!
However, we still got mailer problems with some of our Bitnet members.
If there's someone who knows whether the cunyvm.cuny.edu gateway or
Bitnet itself has changed in the last month or so, could you please
drop me a note?

For our U.S. members, here's wishing you a happy Thanksgiving, and
remember not to drop your tobak in the turkey!  And, after dinner's
done and the dishes are clean, why not retire to the smoking room,
light up, and sort through the mail...

Subject: H. Uppman offer..

Greetings,

Just read Digest #117, and saw a request for the address, and some
info on H. Uppman's cigar offer.  I've also gotten some mail regarding
this offer.  I must apologize for not posting the info; takes time to
hone that "netsense"  :)

Here's the facts:
$10 gets you 12 Churchills in a nice (plastic) case.  I have gotten
them and I'm quite impressed with their freshness, decent draw, and
taste. 

Here's the address:

H. Uppman
P.O. Box 24146W
Richmond, VA.  23224

Allow 6-8 weeks for delivery..

regards,
-mm

Subject: Cubans

CUBAN CIGARS

&gt; Does anyone know if the United States is the only nation with a ban on
&gt; Cuban cigars? 

I believe so.

&gt; I understand you can legally buy them in Canada.  Is it
&gt; then illegal to bring them back into the U.S.? 

Yes.  The importation of any Cuban products/services into the U.S.
via any means is strictly forbidden, as is the export of products
from the U.S. to Cuba, via any route.

&gt; Is it illegal for a
&gt; Canadian business to send Cuban cigars to individuals in the U.S.?

Yes.

Cuban cigars in Canadian duty-free shops are intended to be taken out
of Cuba, but not into the U.S.  However, with the Cold War ending and
with recent and impending events in Cuba, I do not expect this ban to
last into the next century.  I look forward to the day when I will be
able to sample Cuban cigars.  In my semi-frequent trips to Mexico, I
have been unable to find any.  I'm sure I'm just going to the wrong
places (tourist areas), so if anyone has any tips on where Cubans can
be had in the more popular Mexican destinations, please let me know!

TAXES/STOCKPILING

Unlike wine or scotch, I have not found that cigars store well for
any period of time.  Someone mentioned, though, that under the 
proper conditions they can last quite a while.  Short of building
my own fully-enclosed hermetically-sealed walk-in humidor, what 
conditions will keep a cigar fresh for more than a month?  It had
been my impression that all tobacco products were best used fresh.

I question the value of stockpiling tobacco products to avoid
taxes anyway.  I don't think the per-unit taxes on cigars or pipe
tobaccos are going to go up much; does anyone have actual figures?
Even the 75c tax on a pack of cigarettes (watered down from the
originally proposed $2) is in jeopardy, as Clinton may cut a deal
with congressmen from tobacco-growing states to get votes on NAFTA.

[ Actually, I've heard that the quality of the Cubans has gone down in
recent years, due to the sad state of the economy... can someone
verify or refute this? -S. ]

Subject: Re: Moderated mailgroup for cigars, pipes, fine tobacco

Sirs:

     Thank you for putting me on your list.  I originally got on to
alt.smokers because I wanted to hear how other people rated different
cigars.  It seems that 75% of the posts to alt.smokers are pro/con
flames on the act of smoking itself.  I just want posts of new
cigar/pipe/tobac. accessories.

     Now that you are going to post a moderated pipe mailgroup, I
would like to know how pipe tobacco is processed.  In the past 2 years
I have learned what it takes to process cigar tobacco.  This would
greatly expand my knowledge.  Also I want to know about the quality of
the mega expensive pipes like Charatan, Davidoff, and Duhill.

     At my fraternity in West Lafayette, Indiana we sit around at the
Midwest Farm Management Center and debate the finer points of pipe
tobacco smoked in briar vs corn cob pipes.  We now have a private
stock of cigars in a humidor at the center.  Someday some of the
fraternity brothers are going to take some Southern Indiana tobacco
and try to make it into long filler cigars, the way the Dominicans do
it.

     Once again, thanks for the post.  Please direct the posts to:

     ?????@??????.???.??????????.???

                                             Sincerely,

                                             E. Neal Blue

[ I'd recommend a trip to your favorite (well-stocked) library to
check out Carl Ehwa's _The Book of Pipes and Tobacco._ It has one of
the most comprehensive sections on pipe tobacco I've seen. And, IMHO,
improvements in pipe quality level off fairly rapidly with price above
$100. (Your mileage may vary.) Thanks for the note, and welcome!  -S. ]

To my fellow tobacco affectionados:

A very close friend once gave me a lighter which he had treasured for
many years.  I used it for several years and then gave it to a friend
to enjoy.  It was unfortunately lost several years later.  Although
that particular lighter has sentimental value to myself and my two
friends, I was wondering if it is still availble to purchase.  Perhaps
you can help me locate one...or three.

It is a Calibri (I think that's how it's spelled) flip top butane
model with a red light that comes on when you pop the lid.  If you
break the beam of light it ignites.  The case was gold with turtoise
inlays.  Like other lighters from the Calibri company, it was good
quality.  It is this particular model I'm interested in.  If other
finishes were made, I would be interested in them as well.  Thanks in
advance.

Scottie

[ OK, Scottie! You might also want to check Levin Pipes, from the
Resource Guide, which occasionally has lighters. -S. ]

Subject: Introduction and Tobacco Reference

Hi,

My name is Kam Kashani, and I'm a technical writer working for Silicon
Graphics. I live in Santa Cruz, CA and commute to Mountain View, CA
(about 45 miles, one-way), so I visit tobacco stores from Santa Cruz
to Redwood City.

I am a cigar smoker migrating to a pipe. It's amazing how much less
expensive a good pipe smoke is than a comparable cigar ;-) The only
problem I'm having with the pipe is finding out what all the tobacco
varieties are and how they contribute to aroma and taste.

Can anyone recommend a good book on the subject of tobacco in general,
or on pipe tobacco in particular?  It would be nice to have a
reference to varieties, where in the world they are grown, curing
techniques, and so forth.

Thanks,

Kam Kashani

Subject: Cigars and getting sick

First off, let me say that I love this mailing list.  I was
disappointed that the tobacco group didn't pass (next time, though).
Now for my problem.  A few weeks ago, I sat down with a book and a Te
Amo Meditation.  After about an hour, I had finished the cigar and
went to go do some school work.  When I got up, I felt as if I were
drunk (physically, not mentally).  I thought this was a bad sign so I
[went?] to go lay down.  While on myway to the bedroom, I felt very
ill and went into the bathroom and threw up.  Has this happened to
anyone else (or is it just me)?  This is the first time it has
happened to me and has made me somewhat hesitant to smoke again.  Any
help would be appreciated.  Thanks

Jeff

[Sounds like you might have swallowed a bit of cigar juice, Jeff! My
advice is to try to keep your mouth dry and avoid chewing on your
cigar. Any other comments? -S.]

Subject: SMOKE REPORT: Cohiba Robustos
Status: R

I had posted this to alt.smokers and forgotten to also send it to the
Pipes group... (Is everyone else getting as annoyed as I am about the
content of that group? Steve, I've got to admit that you were 100% right
about rec.tobacco being moderated.)

I finally got to try a famous Cohiba Robusto, the so-called benchmark
for the Robusto size. For the money ($20 each), I was a disappointed:
construction was uneven, with soft spots along the cigar. It was
certainly a powerful smoke (this was, afterall, a Cuban cigar), but not
particularly distinctive. I certainly didn't get any "chocolate" flavors
as were mentioned in CA, but did get rather intense leather and spice.
Don't get me wrong: if this had been a $3 (or $5) Dominican Republic
cigar I would have been blown away, but I expected more from a Cuban.
(See my previous smoke report of the fantastic Romeo &amp; Julietta
Churchills!)

&gt;
&gt;Unlike wine or scotch, I have not found that cigars store well for
&gt;any period of time.  Someone mentioned, though, that under the 
&gt;proper conditions they can last quite a while.  Short of building
&gt;my own fully-enclosed hermetically-sealed walk-in humidor, what 
&gt;conditions will keep a cigar fresh for more than a month?  It had
&gt;been my impression that all tobacco products were best used fresh.

Cigars and pipe-tobacco age beautifully, but must be kept under proper
conditions; for cigars, this is at a temperature of about 70F and a
relative humidity of about 68%.  One of the finest smokes I've ever 
had was a pre-embargo Bolivar!  Another cigar of note was a Royal
Jamaica Park Lane, which had been carefully aged for 11 years.  I can
still almost taste that beauty...and the aroma!  Sublime!

Unless you have purchased a cigar from the chap who rolled it, you have
likely never had a "fresh" cigar.  Cigars are rolled quite wet, and after 
manufacture, they must be aged for a minimum of 6 weeks to allow the 
moisture level to come down to the correct level for smoking, and to 
allow the flavours of the various tobaccos in the blend to "marry."  
A truly "fresh" ("green" in the trade) cigar can be quite dreadful.  
Though some rollers know how to make a "green" cigar that can taste 
quite good, these are not the cigars you would buy by the box.  A friend
who represents one of the major Dominican manufacturers once brought me
a few "green" cigars of a quality brand I routinely smoke.  They were
HORRID!  Harsh, difficult to draw, and just plain nasty.  I put the rest
away for a few weeks, and voila!  

&gt;From the time a cigar is normally purchased, assuming good inventory
turnover at the retailer, it will undergo its most significant change 
in the first 8-15 months, going through a sort of "growing pain" period 
at somewhere between 6 and 10 months, and then mellowing.  After a couple 
of years, the change is much more gradual.  The spice of some tobaccos 
becomes more tightly integrated with the other flavours, and the overall 
complexity increases, though the cigars often become more subtle.  Cigars
with darker wrappers, as a rule of thumb, age better than cigars with 
claro wrappers, as do cigars with more oily wrappers.  In order for them
to age well, they should be removed from their cello sleeves, and packed
loosely in cedar boxes, and kept in the proper temperature/humidity.

***

I have built a most cost-effective humidor.  Some years ago, my mum was
getting rid of her old freezer, which had been out of sorts.  When I
discovered that the cost of parts to repair was nearly that of a new
freezer, I opted to put it to *better* use!  A few cedar sheets from the
inside of cigar boxes, a small hygrometer and a sponge allowed me to 
convert a scrap into a first-rate humidor!  Each time I go for a cigar,
I am rewarded by a magnificent aroma, and the joy of knowing that I 
can smoke any one of a variety of cigars, at any one of a variety of
ages!  I now can have the "right" cigar available for almost any occasion!

***

As an aside, my favourite pipe tobacco hasn't even been made for over
twenty years.  I was able to acquire about 100 tins of it when the shop
which had it commissioned went out of business.  (I was barely out of
diapers when this stuff was made!)  Anyone with whom I have shared this
delight has commenced aging their tobaccos!  Virginias and Turkish
tobaccos age gracefully.  Latakia loses some of its piquancy, but develops
a richness that is indescribable!

&gt;[ Actually, I've heard that the quality of the Cubans has gone down in
&gt;recent years, due to the sad state of the economy... can someone
&gt;verify or refute this? -S. ]

Cuban cigars are still unequalled.  Though there are excellent cigars
made in the Dominican Republic, the Honduras, the Canary Islands and
even Miami, *nothing* tastes like a Cuban cigar!  The quality largely
depends upon which factory they come from; even a Montecristo isn't 
always a Montecristo, as they come out of several different factories!
The best ones are shipped to the markets which the Cuban government deems
most worthy, so you can always find the best ones in Switzerland and Spain.
&gt;From other markets, they are quite inconsistent.  It really is sad that
politics and pleasure are so inextricably linked when it comes to cigars!

I`ve had some unbelieveable Montecristos, Romeo &amp; Juliettas, H. Upmanns,
Cohibas and Hoyo de Monterreys lately; as good as ever.  It all depends 
uoon where they were made (which factory) and how they were stored.

Happy smoking!

[ Thanks, Gregory! BTW, your message got me interested in how to build
a cost-effective humidor. The fridge seems like a novel idea, though
I'm sure that a one could build a more elegant one... perhaps a
veteran woodsmith could provide a reference to a plan?  (Or, as Norm
Abram says, a "measured drawring and a materials list" :-)

BTW, I think one could make a very inexpensive humidor for a few
cigars or just a little tobak, from a Rubbermaid or similar box, a
sponge-type humidifier, and a hygrometer. The hygrometer is available
from:

		Edmund Scientific
		101 E. Gloucester Pike 			
		Barrington NJ 08007-1380
		609-573-6250 		(orders)
		609-573-6858/6859 	(catalog requests)

I've ordered their catalog and will probably try this in the near
future. If anyone else has built their own humidor, please write in! -S. ]

Subject: Re:  Pipes Digest #118 - November 19, 1993
	
	
A few comments on digest 118:	
	
	Yes.  The importation of any Cuban products/services into the U.S.
	via any means is strictly forbidden, as is the export of products
	from the U.S. to Cuba, via any route.
	
I, as a Canadian, can bring Cuban cigars into the United States for my
own personal use.  It is only illegal if I sell them or give them to
somebody else.  That's why they sell them in the Duty Free.
	
	     Now that you are going to post a moderated pipe mailgroup, I
	would like to know how pipe tobacco is processed.  

According to my old tobacconist in Pittsburgh (Ivan at Continental), 
Latakia is processed over fires of dried camel dung.  Any tobacco
experts out there care to comment?

	Also I want to know about the quality of
	the mega expensive pipes like Charatan, Davidoff, and Duhill.

I am told that the only difference between a $100 GBD and a $300
Dunhill is the label:  they come from the same factory.  I have 
seen some recent Dunhills that make my flesh crawl _before_ looking
at the price tag.  It's not like the old days, when Dunhill pipes
were notably light and graceful right down to the bottom of the 
line.

Charatan makes some excellent pipes that are realtively inexpensive.
Right now I'm smoking a Charatan (3102DC) for which I paid C$60 on
sale.  Not in the same league as Dunhill (which, last time I was in
their New York blazer shoppe and pipe showroom, started at $250 for
a cheesy clunker).  Buying a pipe from an excellent cigar roller
like Davidoff seems pointless.

If you're going to blow lots of oof on a pipe, you might consider
a decent Stanwell, Comoy, Ben Wade or Charatan -- you could buy two
for the price of one Dunhill dental appliance.

	...  Someday some of the
	fraternity brothers are going to take some Southern Indiana tobacco
	and try to make it into long filler cigars, the way the Dominicans do
	it.
	
This weekend past, I had the opportunity to pull some Virginia leaf
off of a drying rack, rub it up, and smoke it; both in a clay pipe
and in my big Ben Wade.  It was really quite nice -- I might start 
keeping some plain Virginia around the apartment to match the plain
Latakia I occasionally buy for outdoors smoking.

Later,

Aryk Nusbacher

[ Plain Latakia? You're a stronger man than I am, Aryk! :-) And thanks
for the info on Dunhill vs. GBD; I agree that Dunhills aren't really
worth the price difference. -S. ]

Excerpts from internet.other.pipes: 19-Nov-93 Pipes Digest #118 -

&gt; [ Actually, I've heard that the quality of the Cubans has gone down in
&gt; recent years, due to the sad state of the economy... can someone

&gt; 
While I've heard the same thing, I'd say that the quality of Cuban
cigars is inconsistant. I have had _3_ different Cuban cigars over the
last few weeks (a little bragging here :) and of those, one was
absolutely fantastic (Romeo &amp; Julietta Churchill), one was better than
any non-Cuban I've ever had (La Flor del Fino Short Churchill; actually
a Robusto size), and one was good but disappointing given it's
reputation (Cohiba Robusto). I've had other Cubans over the last year
that were strong/harsh, but not particularly interesting: Partagas
(Corona size?), Montecristo (Corona size?). I have tried a handfull of
others, but those were before I had smoked a wide enough variety to know
what my tastes are. If you're inclined to spend alot of money you can
buy pre-embargo and even pre-Castro Cubans. CA had a fascinating article
on this subject in the last issue. From what I could gather, these
cigars go for $50+ each. A friend went to an auction recently and bought
one for $120 and smoked it immediately; He said it was the best cigar
he's ever had.

Subject: US import of Cuban cigars


&gt; 	Yes.  The importation of any Cuban products/services into the U.S.
&gt; 	via any means is strictly forbidden, as is the export of products
&gt; 	from the U.S. to Cuba, via any route.

There's an exception: You can bring in a limited amount (I believe it's
the standard amount allowed for personal use) if you're returning from Cuba.

Unfortunately, you can't legally have _been_ in Cuba without the permission
of the US government.

If you happen to be among (or know) the rare legal visitors, the custom's
service publishes a brochure with all the details, most travel agents and
international airlines have copies.

&gt; I, as a Canadian, can bring Cuban cigars into the United States for my
&gt; own personal use.  It is only illegal if I sell them or give them to
&gt; somebody else.  That's why they sell them in the Duty Free.

Damn. A Canadian just came down to visit, and all I ordered was a haggis.

&gt; According to my old tobacconist in Pittsburgh (Ivan at Continental), 
&gt; Latakia is processed over fires of dried camel dung.  Any tobacco
&gt; experts out there care to comment?

Dung is a traditional fuel throughout most of the world. I've read that
it's over a fire of herbs; I much prefer to believe that :-)

&gt;According to my old tobacconist in Pittsburgh (Ivan at Continental), 
&gt;Latakia is processed over fires of dried camel dung.  Any tobacco
&gt;experts out there care to comment?

Latakia was "discovered" when a bumper crop resulted in surplus,
and the excess tobacco was stored in the rafters.  The  village farmers
traditionally used camel dung (or other dung, I suspect) as a source 
of fuel, and the smoke cured tobacco was revealed the following season.  
Today, Latakia is smoked over a smouldering fire of aromatic herbs.  The
camel no longer has to process the herbs first!

&gt;	Also I want to know about the quality of
&gt;	the mega expensive pipes like Charatan, Davidoff, and Duhill.
&gt;
&gt;I am told that the only difference between a $100 GBD and a $300
&gt;Dunhill is the label:  they come from the same factory.  

Dunhill and GBD are *not* made in the same factory.  GBDs and Comoys
are both made in France, where they actually have quite a strong
tradition.  Dunhills are still made in England by Dunhill.  Many of the 
GBD and Comoy pipes  are stemmed and finished in England, last I knew, 
but the bowls are turned in St. Claude.

There have been times in Dunhill's history when bowls were purchased and
then cured, stemmed and finshed.  This practise has not been done in decades.
The Dunhill curing process is what makes the Dunhill pipes distinctive.
When William Ashton Taylor left Dunhill's employ to establish the Ashton
factory, he cured his pipes using very similar methods.  Ashtons are now
cured differently, and no longer taste like Dunhills.  I believe there
was a bit of trouble with Dunhill's ownership of the patents, even though
Mr. Taylor originated some of the methods...

&gt;I have 
&gt;seen some recent Dunhills that make my flesh crawl _before_ looking
&gt;at the price tag.  It's not like the old days, when Dunhill pipes
&gt;were notably light and graceful right down to the bottom of the 
&gt;line.

The "old days" are a much lauded myth.  Dunhill pipes are no better or
no worse today than ever, but the poor quality ones of olde have long
since been discarded, while the better ones have been cherished.  Dunhill
has had some periods during which certain models were not up to scratch,
but overall, they have retained their traditional curing and manufacturing
methods despite increasing costs of doing so.  The same can not be said of 
Comoy, GBD, Saseini, Barling, BBB, Charatan (now made in France and imported 
by J. B. Russell), all of which made wonderful pipes at one time, and all of
which make an inferior product today.  I have a significant number of
Dunhills in my collection, made between 1912 and 1986.  They are all 
superb smoking pipes.  I have had poor quality, heavy, flavourless Dunhills
from the 1980's *and* from the 1930's.  The most beautiful pipe set
I have ever seen is a set of Dunhill Shells, group 1 through ODA in a 
straight billiard shape.  Each pipe is sxtraordinary, and the impact
of all seven pipes, presented in a beautifully crafted chest is
breathtaking. 

I'm not defending Dunhill prices; I think they are ridiculous, but
everything has its perspective.  I have to applaud Dunhill for retaining
traditional methods and materials.  (They don't make movies like they
did in the good old days, either.  Or cars.  Remember the Edsel?)

&gt;Charatan makes some excellent pipes that are realtively inexpensive.
&gt;Right now I'm smoking a Charatan (3102DC) for which I paid C$60 on
&gt;sale.  Not in the same league as Dunhill (which, last time I was in
&gt;their New York blazer shoppe and pipe showroom, started at $250 for
&gt;a cheesy clunker).  Buying a pipe from an excellent cigar roller
&gt;like Davidoff seems pointless.
&gt;
&gt;If you're going to blow lots of oof on a pipe, you might consider
&gt;a decent Stanwell, Comoy, Ben Wade or Charatan -- you could buy two
&gt;for the price of one Dunhill dental appliance.

As I mentioned, Charatan is not the pipe it once was.  Really.  They
were once independent, then Lane Limited (the same chaps who own Dunhill)
bought them.  About a year or two ago, the rights to the name and shape
chart were purchased by James B. Russell, and the pipes are now made
in St. Claude, France.  I've had great pipes from St. Claude, so this 
might not be all bad, but the Charatans I have seen lately have been
piss-poor counterfeits of the "real" ones.  

GBD and Comoy are now one and the same.  The only difference between 
the pipes is the finishing and the logo.  Barling has been a different
product since the father/son transition in the (i think) 1960s.  Ditto
Saseini. 

For reasonable prices, Peterson makes a nice smoking, though not always
pretty pipe.  Because of a glut on the market, Castellos can be had for
a decent price (relative to Dunhill!), and the lesser priced Larsens
are a real bargain.  The upscale Danish pipes are truly wonderful, and
some of the less know Italian marques are worth searching out; Fiamma
di Rey, Mastro de Paja, il Ceppo, Ser Jacopo and Grenci come to mind.  
Some of the finest pipes being made today come from small American makers, 
Butera, Frey, Rausch.  These are hard to find, but well worth the search.  I
don't know if he's still around, but Julius Vesz, somewhere in Canada
was making superb pipes a few years ago.  I haven't seen one in a while,
so I can't say much about availability.

On Cigars:

If you can find them, the Private Stock (a second from a *major* Dominican 
maker) cigars are the best bang-for-the-buck going.  The Number 11 is a 
robusto with a lot of character and taste.  It's full bodied without being
overwhelming, and quite complex. (Quite similar to the Davidoff Special R.)

I've prattled on long enough.

From: James Taranto &lt;???????@?????.???&gt;
Subject: A great Thanksgiving

Several of my friends feel sorry for me because I'm spending Thanksgiving
alone, as my family lives in California and I live in New York.  They
don't know what a good Thanksgiving is.  I'm sitting here watching the
Dallas-Miami game with the sound down, I've got a Beethoven symphony going
on the stereo, and... I'm enjoying my first Cuban Cohiba.

Actually, it's a Canadian Cohiba, one of several I purchased on a trip to
Toronto three months ago.  The Havana House on Cumberland was having some
sort of charity benefit, and had a Cuban roller making Cohibas on the
premises, which were being sold for bargain prices: C$5 (about $4) for a
corona, C$10 for a robusto, C$15 for a Churchill.  I bought four of the
coronas and one robusto, which have been sitting in my humidor since.

I'm smoking a corona (actually a nonstandard size, 38x6", half an inch
short of what they call a Corona Especial).  It's very tasty and
full-bodied, but not harsh like some cheaper Cuban cigars.  It's a
wonderful accompaniment to a Canadian beer (LaBatt Blue, purchased at the
duty-free shop on the same trip).

My father has severe asthma and doesn't allow smoking in his house, so
it's a real treat for me *not* to spend Thanksgiving with the family.

By the way, there's a Dominican Cohiba on the market now, available at
Dunhill shops among other places.  Like the Dominican Montecristo that was
recently introduced, it's a pale imitation of the real thing from Havana.

Cheers,
James Taranto  ???????@?????.???

[ Hope the others had similarly happy Thanksgivings! -S. ]

Subject: Pipes, Tobacco and AD&amp;D2nd


Hi pipers,

I would like to ask you for some information on making pipes and
tobacco. Sure I could read a book or look it up in an encyclopedia.
But I think I need the knowledge of people who have actual expereince
in doing these crafts.

if you know AD&amp;D2nd, I would like to ask you for some help (you can
skip the next paragraph).  If you don't know what AD&amp;D2nd is, please
read on, you may even be of more help, since you apparently dont waste
time with it and spend more time with pipes...

AD&amp;D2nd is short for Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition.  It is a
rule system for fantasy role playing games. The system allows to set
up a very detailed personality and abilities of a player/character.
The setting of the play is often a civilisation like the roman empire
or medival times (f.i. Tolkien). In these worlds live lots of
interesting and dangerous creatures. Our group is very story oriented
and very often invent a new skill/proficiency which is not in the
official rule book. Recently, my bard started to learn the trade of
crafting tobacco pipes. Since in ancient times the trades of craftsman
were highly specialiced, one can not simply make a pipe if one already
had 'crafting wooden shoes' before. (cf. the different types of
smiths...).

Now I want to do a write up for 'Crafting Tobacco Pipes'.  (If you'd
know a better title, please let me know. But 'Crafting Pipes' might by
confusing with flutes.)

Since I almost know nothing about crafting pipes or production of
tobacco (I just use it) I would like to ask you for some input. Please
bear in mind that 1000 or 2000 years ago the trade of pipe making may
have been different from to day.

'Crafting Tobacco Pipes'

Points of interest are:

What do you need to make a pipe.  (Tools, woods, workshop or 'on the
road')

How long does it take to make a pipe.  (Experience, tools, wisdom,
dexterity, patient wife...)

What is the _relative_ value of the pipe when it is finished.
(a formula based on wood quality, time of labour, artistic abilites,
final quality of the pipe...)  Please, dont put the final value in
terms of US$.  The fantasy world has a price system that is based on
relative values, like 100 eggs is about one goose, or rather more
dependend on the time and knowlege it requires to produce something.

How long will pipes last. (quality, usage,..... ) [My first one,
though of good quality, lasted one year, then the neck broke due to
heat damage]

Anything else to know ?  (If you have some historical knowledge, it
would be very welcome.)


'Tobacco manufacturing'
Points of interest are:

The growing and harvest of tobacco plants would be in the domain of
the farmer's trade, I think.  Here I am looking more for the steps
from after harvest until the tobacco is ready to smoke.  If I recall
corectly, tobacco was available in Europe only after the Spaniards
brought it back from America.  Of course, in our fantasy world tobacco
is available at all times.  To make it short, points of interest are
similar to those listed above under Pipe making.

that's it, finally.  Ah, of course, when you mail me something, I take
it that I can use it in the Net.Bards.Book that I am writing.
Certainly this will be done under the no-profit ettiquette and you get
your acknowledgement.

Sorry Steve, maybe this long mail should go into the Pipes Digest
Supplement...

thanks to all 
Martin

[ A tall order, Martin! But it sounds like fun! I'll attempt a few
preliminary answers. Hope someone else will help me out!

A crude pipe can be made by an eight-year-old with a pocket knife. (I
know from personal experience. :-) But it takes a fair amount of
woodworking skill to make a good one.  Depending on the tools you're
using, and the effects you're trying for, it can take from an
afternoon to a week.

Briar is a _very_ hard wood, so briar pipes will be the toughest to
carve. Meerschaum is much softer, hence easier to work, but you'd
still have to make some hard fitments, so it would last. And
meerschaum carvers go in for fancy artwork and fitted lined hard
leather cases. A corncob can be made by anyone in minutes, including
an eight-year-old with a pocket knife.

Materials: Block briar root, sandpaper, rouge, walnut or similar
stains, carnauba wax. Possibly bone or amber for the stem. (I guess
vulcanite, or any other plastic, is out for AD&amp;D purposes...)

Tools: At the minimum, leather gloves and apron, a drill and bits
(metal bits, not wood augers), fine-tooth saw, sharp carving knife,
vise, small paintbrush for the stain, rags for buffing. A lathe would
help, for turning the pipe, as well as sanding or buffing it; so would
some sort of a grinder. I'd love to have a flex-shaft, especially if I
was trying to carve complicated artwork on the pipe. (Which I can't,
personally...) As the number and power of the tools increases, the
time to make the pipe decreases.

The value of the pipe depends on the quality of the wood. There's a
large chance factor, because you can hit grains of sand and other
defects that you can't see, as you carve. I'd say the effort is about
equivalent to making a good wooden chair.

Pipes can last forever if they're well-designed and well-cared for.
Stems will typically be the first thing to break, usually in about
five years, by sheer chewing.

Don't have the history handy, but I can check it. I'll send you Bill's
write-up on tobacco growing by separate mail. No problem with using
this, and if you do put in an acknowledgement, please mention the
Mailgroup. And please let us see, too! -S. ]

            Items marked (*) are reprinted in every issue.


So many of you subscribed to mini-JIR that you rendered it,
very temporarily, irreproducible. We had planned to send out
this first issue early in the week of November 15. But with
this number of subscribers, that would have overwhelmed the
MIT computer system, and possibly slowed down other portions
of the net. Rather than do that, we made arrangements to
have a number of sites redistribute mini-JIR.

We apologize for the delay, and thank you for your patience.


---------------------------------------
1993-01-02  Purpose of the Mini-Journal (*)

The Mini-Journal of Irreproducible Results publishes news
about overly stimulating research and ideas. Specifically:

A) Haphazardly selected superficial (but advanced!) extracts
of research news and satire from the Journal of
Irreproducible Results (JIR).

B) News about the annual Ig Nobel Prize ceremony. Ig Nobel
Prizes honor "achievements that cannot or should not be
reproduced." A public ceremony is held at MIT, in Cambridge
Massachusetts, every autumn. The ceremony is sponsored
jointly by JIR and by the MIT Museum.

C) News about other science humor activities conducted by
the MIT Museum and JIR.

1993-01-03  Abstracts from JIR, vol. 38, no. 5, Sep/Oct 93

This section contains abstracts of articles that appear in
volume 38, number 5 (the September/October 1993 issue) of
The Journal of Irreproducible Results.

"Teeth Pulled by Peter the Great," by Rosamond Wolff Purcell
and Stephen J. Gould.
A photograph documents 24 teeth, all personally pulled by
Peter the Great of Russia, who fancied himself a dentist,
and who often would demand this sacrifice of a member of his
retinue or even of an idle passerby.

"Selecting a College: The Squirrel Index," by Bruce McAfee.
In recommending a college to attend, experts traditionally
rely on innacurate assumptions: that prospective students
can read, etc. The author proposes and tests a new approach
for selecting a college: examining the number and
friendliness of a college's resident squirrel population.

"What's in a Name? (Middle) Name-Dropping and Postwar
American Politics" by William J. Tompson
There is a marked trend toward shorter names for American
politicians and statesmen. This study uses a number of
highly sophisticated quantitative tests to draw a link
between this phenomenon and the influence of the Bolshevik
Revolution on American intellectual life.

"The Coffee Strength Gauge," by Stephen Drew.
A new wristwatch-shaped device assesses the quality of a cup
of coffee. It provides house guests and restaurant patrons
with a polite way to tell before drinking the coffee whether
it is too strong, too weak, or just right.

"A Phenomenon Caused by Excess Gravity," by J. William
Taylor.
Photographic evidence supports the author's theory of how
two wine glasses came to be of differing heights.

"The Phantom Research Grant Phenomenon," by George
Englebretsen and Genevieve Boulet.
The authors contend that, just as victims of limb loss are
often forced phsychologically to continue to behave as if
their phantom limbs still exist, victims of research grant
loss are often forced to continue to behave as if their
grants still exist.

"The Therapeutic Value of Whimpering," by Roma Lark.
The author, a nursing student, finds that the length of a
hospital patient's stay can be predicted by the quality and
frequency of the patient's whimpering.

"Measuring Effects of Space Flight Without Space Flight," by
Mark Shelhamer.
A simple mathematical method predicts human physical
performance under weightless conditions. It is based on
measuring the difference in performance, under normal
gravity, between subjects weighing (for example) X and 2X.

Interview with Nobel Physics laureate (1979) Allan Cormack.
Cormack developed the mathematical and physical foundations
of  computerized axial tomography (CAT) imaging. In this
interview, he explains his secrets for staying awake during
a dull lecture, and suggests candidates for the Ig Nobel
Prize.

"An Important but Neglected Function of Nitric Oxide (NO),"
by X. Perry Mental.
A historical context is given for the recent discovery,
published in the research journal "Science," that nitric
oxide (NO) may play a role in penile erections. A non-
seminal event was the 1965 discovery of the contraceptive
NO-acetol, the chemical structure of which has nitric oxide
(NO) in every position.

"Nitric Oxide (NO): Don't Confuse Cause With Effect," by
Benjamin J. Luberoff.
The author contends that recent research on nitric oxide
(NO) leaves it unclear whether: (a) NO conveys a message
that causes penile erection; or (b) the erection elicits the
NO.

"Comedic Cosmology," by Howard Zaharoff.
The publication of this article was made possible by a
generous donation from the author's family.

"A Cool Analysis of the Heat Pump," by Mark Lipsman.
The classical heat pump is analyzed in terms of the spaces
between molecules, Planck's constant, and moving trains.

"Elegant Results" (regular column) by Alice Shirell Kaswell.
Styles, trends, and tidbits, culled from leading research
journals. In this issue: findings from the research journals
"Skin Art Encyclopedia," " Outlaw Biker Review," and
"Tattoo."

"Scientific Gossip" (regular column) by Stephen Drew.
Contains 100% gossip from concentrate. In this issue:
Recycled House Wine; Disorder for Doctors; Patch People;
Fungus Factory; There's a Song in My Stomach; Gas for
interested Viewers; The Passing of Things Remembered;
Borderline Therapy; The Omni-Drug Revolution.

1993-01-04  List of 1993 Ig Nobel Prize Winners

The winners of the 1993 Ig Nobel Prizes were announced in a
ceremony held on October 7 at MIT. The Prizes honor
individuals whose achievements cannot or should not be
reproduced.

Eleven Ig Nobel Prizes were given this year. The winners
come from 16 different countries: Australia; Belgium;
Canada; England; France; Germany; Ireland; Israel;
Luxembourg; the Netherlands; New Zealand; the Philippines;
Poland; Spain; Switzerland; and the United States.

A number of dignitaries participated in the ceremony,
including: Nobel Laureates William Lipscomb (chemistry,
1976), Sheldon Glashow (physics, 1979), Jerome Friedman
(physics, 1990), Mel Schwartz, (physics, 1985) and Dudley
Herschbach (chemistry, 1986); Russell Johnson, professor
emeritus from Gilligan's Island; Alan Lightman, author of
"Einstein's Dreams;" jazz harpist Deborah Henson-Conant, MIT
economist Paul Krugman; "New England Journal of Medicine"
executive editor Marcia Angell; past president of the
American Bar association John J. Curtin; and Tufts
University Dental School's Philip Molloy, who has performed
more than 10,000 root canal procedures.

The new winners:

Psychology
John Mack of Harvard Medical School and David Jacobs of
Temple University, mental visionaries, for their leaping
conclusion that people who believe they were kidnapped by
aliens from outer space, probably were -- and especially for
their conclusion that, in Professor Jacobs's words, "the
focus of the abduction is the production of children."
[Both Mack and Jacobs have written and spoken extensively on
the subject. A good introduction is the book "Secret Life,"
by David Jacobs with an introduction by John Mack, Simon and
Schuster, New York, 1992.]

Consumer Engineering
Ron Popeil, incessant inventor and perpetual pitchman of
late night television, for redefining the industrial
revolution with such devices as the Veg-O-Matic, the Pocket
Fisherman, the Cap Snaffler, Mr. Microphone, and the Inside-
the-Shell Egg Scrambler.

Biology
Paul Williams, Jr. of the Oregon State Health Division and
Kenneth W. Newell of the Liverpool School of Tropical
Medicine, bold biological detectives, for their pioneering
study, "Salmonella Excretion in Joy-Riding Pigs."  [The
study was published in "The American Journal of Public
Health," vol. 60, no. 5, May, 1970. Kenneth Newell died in
March, 1990.]

Economics
Ravi Batra of Southern Methodist University, shrewd
economist and best-selling author of "The Great Depression
of 1990" ($17.95) and "Surviving the Great Depression of
1990" ($18.95), for selling enough copies of his books to
single-handedly prevent worldwide economic collapse.

Peace
The Pepsi-Cola Company of the Phillipines, suppliers of
sugary hopes and dreams, for sponsoring a contest to create
a millionaire, and then announcing the wrong winning number,
thereby inciting and uniting 800,000 riotously expectant
winners, and bringing many warring factions together for the
first time in their nation's history.

Visionary Technology
Presented jointly to Jay Schiffman of Farmington Hills,
Michigan, crack inventor of AutoVision, an image projection
device that makes it possible to drive a car and watch
television at the same time, and to the Michigan state
legislature, for making it legal to do so.  [Michigan House
Bill 4530, Public Act #55 was signed into law by the
Governor on June 6, 1991.]

Chemistry
James Campbell and Gaines Campbell of Lookout Mountain,
Tennessee, dedicated deliverers of fragrance, for inventing
scent strips, the odious method by which perfume is applied
to magazine pages.  [Additional historical information about
the invention of scent strips can be obtained from the
Campbells' former colleague, Ronald Versic, President of the
Ronald P. Dodge Company in Dayton, OH.]

Literature
Awarded jointly to E. Topol, R. Califf, F. Van de Werf, P.
W. Armstrong, and their 972 co-authors, for publishing a
medical research paper which has one hundred times as many
authors as pages. [Source "An International Randomized Trial
Comparing Four Thrombolytic Strategies for Acute Myocardial
Infarction," "The New England Journal of Medicine," volume
329, number 10, September 2, 1993, pages 673-682.
The co-authors come from 15 different nations: Australia;
Belgium; Canada; England; France; Germany; Ireland; Israel;
Luxembourg; the Netherlands; New Zealand; Poland; Spain;
Switzerland; and the United States.]

Mathematics
Robert Faid of Greenville, South Carolina, farsighted and
faithful seer of statistics, for calculating the exact odds
(8,606,091,751,882:1) that Mikhail Gorbachev is the
Antichrist. [Faid's complete calculation is contained in the
book "Gorbachev! Has the Real Antichrist Come?" published by
Victory House, Tulsa, Oklahoma. The pertinent section of the
book was reprinted in the January, 1989 issue of Harper's
Magazine.]

Physics
Louis Kervran of France, ardent admirer of alchemy, for his
conclusion that the calcium in chickens' eggshells is
created by a process of cold fusion. [For an English
language version of Kervran's research see the book
"Biological Transmutations, and their applications in
chemistry, physics, biology, ecology, medicine, nutrition,
agriculture, geology," by Louis Kervran, Swan House
Publishing Co., 1972.]

Medicine
James F. Nolan, Thomas J. Stillwell, and John P. Sands, Jr.,
medical men of mercy, for their painstaking research report,
"Acute Management of the Zipper-Entrapped Penis."  [Nolan is
Associate in Urology at the Guthrie Clinic in Sayre, PA.
Stillwell is in private practice at North Urology, Ltd., in
Robbinsdale, MN. Sands is Chairman of the Department of
Urology, Naval Hospital, San Diego, CA. Their report was
published in "The Journal of Emergency Medicine," vol. 8,
1990.]

1993-01-05  NAFTA Update

Until very recently, the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) was the subject of fierce debate among economists.
The remarkable sudden arrival at concensus within the
profession was due largely to a concept articulated by Paul
Krugman. Krugman delivered his remarks on October 7 at the
Ig Noble Prize Ceremony, in the form of a Heisenberg
Certainty Lecture.

Heisenberg Certainty Lecture #4.
Paul Krugman, Professor of Economics, MIT.
"The MIT Economics Department has now solved the riddle of
world economic crisis. It turns out that if you add up last
year's reported imports and exports for all of the countries
in the world, world imports exceeded world exports by more
than one hundred billion dollars. You know what that means.
It means that we are running a huge global deficit in our
interplanetary trade. So Ross Perot has it wrong. That great
sucking sound isn't coming from Mexico -- it's coming from
outer space. Space aliens are stealing American jobs."


--------------------------
1993-01-06  JIR Recommends

Research reports that merit a trip to the library:

"Surgical Management of an Epidemic of Penile Amputations in
Siam," by Kasian Bhanganada, Tu Chayavatana, Chumporn
Pongnumkul, Anunt Tonmukayakul, Piyasakol Sakolsatayadorn,
Krit Komaratal, and Henry Wilde, "The American Journal of
Surgery," 1983, no. 146, pp. 376-382. The report reads in
part: "It became fashionable in the decade after 1970 for
the humiliated Thai wife to wait until her [philandering]
husband fell asleep so that she could quickly sever his
penis with a kitchen knife. A traditional Thai home is
elevated on pilings and the windows are open to allow for
ventilation. The area under the house is the home of the
family pigs, chickens, and ducks. Thus, it is quite usual
that an amputated penis is tossed out of an open window,
where it may be captured by a duck."

"Protein, cDNA, and Genomic DNA Sequences of the Towel Gourd
Trypsin Inhibitor, A Squash Family Inhibitor," "The Journal
of Biological Chemistry," vol. 268, no. 2, January 15, 1993,
pp. 810-814. (Thanks to Thomas Michel for bringing this to
our attention.)

"Establishment of Cattle-Human Relationships," by X. Boivin,
P. Le Neindre, and J. M. Chupin, "Applied Animal Behavior
Science," vol. 32, 1992, pp. 325-335. (Thanks to Earle
Spamer for bringing this to our attention.)

&gt;Administrative notes: I've updated the Resource Guide to reflect

Would you mind sending me a copy of the Resource Guide, please?

While on vacation over the last week, I bought a seventy cent cigar;
a manduro Arthur Fuente.  It was one of the best I've tried.  It was
mellow with a pleasant aroma.  Even my wife didn't complain as much.
It burned evenly all the way down.  I've been smoking what I thought
were inexpensive Dominican cigars from the local chain store.  This
was cheaper; but a much, much more enjoyable smoke.  The Dominicans
tend to burn faster on one side than the other and get so bitey near
the end that I frequently let them go out and finish them after my
taste buds have recovered.  If you haven't tried one yet, it's worth
the effort!

Bulk tobacco source

I recently found one I am quite fond of named "341". This is not a private
label, rather a order number from the manufacture. It comes in bulk 5 pound
bags, and is quite good. It is a balanced English blend, with a very small 
amount of virginia. This makes it burn very cool. 

341 was available from a PCI, but they have dropped it. I would like to find
a source for the blend and stock up before taxs hit the roof. 

Mr Levin, of Levin pipes guesses it's put out by World Tobac. I have no idea
how to find out for sure, or how to find World Tobac.

Thanks all.

[ If you've still got a sample, give these people a call:

	Cornell &amp; Diehl, Inc.
	P.O. Box 398
	Doylestown, PA 18901-0398
	(215) 345-0875

They offer to duplicate blends from samples. BTW, does anyone know
where I can get my hands on a sample of L.L. Bean's Pipe Tobacco? -S. ]

Subject: Re: Dave's cigar?

Excerpts from mail: 2-Dec-93 Re: Dave's cigar? by Chris ??????@???.??? 
&gt; I was looking for some information about cigar smoking and was hoping you
&gt; may be able to help me out. Is there a FAQ that I just haven't found? I am
&gt; curious about the correct way to light, cut, and smoke a cigar and which
&gt; brands are considered to be the best in certain price catagories. Thanks
&gt; for the help.

  You _definitely_ should subscribe to the pipes mailing list. (I CC'ed
this letter to Steve, the moderator of the list.) Don't be fooled by the
name; there are just as many cigar lovers as pipe enthusiasts
participating. As for forming a tobacco newsgroup... that has sort of a
checkered past: A couple years ago, Steve tried (unsuccessfully) to
start one. Two months ago, Steve, Colin Crist, and I attempted to form a
moderated rec.tobacco. Again it failed, this time due to a huge number
of "no" votes from the anti-smoking crowd. If you've been reading
alt.smoking you can see that they're pretty rabid in their attacks. The
good news is that all the publicity has caused Steve's list to
dramaticaly increase it's distribution.
  As for cigars to try: go to a good tobacconist and tell him you're
just learning about cigars. Select 2 or 3 cigars in the $2-$5 range. Be
sure to get one Dominican Republic cigar with a light colored wrapper,
and one Honduras cigar with a dark brown wrapper. (I'd recommend a Hoyo
de Monterray Excalibur #1, #2, or Banquet for the later...a personal
favorite). Dominican Republic cigars tend to be a lighter style.
Honduras are more full bodied. If you find you like the full bodied
variety then the ultimate treasure is a Cuban cigar. They're illegal to
bring into the US, but not impossible to find. It's best to know what
you like before spending $15-$35 (or more) on a single cigar. Have fun!

[ Thanks for the good word, Andy! Perhaps we could expand this into a
"how-to" guide for the novice cigar smoker? _S. ]

Subject: Buttons, buttons, who's got the buttons?

Hi, all,

For some time, I've been meaning to tell you all about Nancy
Lebovitz's calligraphic button catalog. If you've been to computer
shows or science-fiction conventions in the general Middle Atlantic
area, you may have noticed her tables, laden with all kinds of
hand-drawn slogans, and thronged by the largest crowds at the show.
There are _thousands_ of them, in all colors (buttons, not the crowd
:-) and nicely done, too! To get her catalog, write her at:

	Nancy Lebovitz
	400 Wollaston Ave, C6
	Newark DE  19711

	Email: ?????@?????.????.????.???


The email catalog has three advantages: it's machine-searchable,
it's suitable for a cookie file, and it's free. :-)

So why am I plugging her buttons? Because there are a few of
special interest to fine-tobacco aficionados, some of which I'll
reproduce here:

     I've read so much about the dangers of sex, smoking, and drinking
     that I've given up reading   (I'VE:dangers/reading)

     Thank you for not lecturing me about smoking   (THA:not lecturing)

     Mobile Smoking area   (MOB:smoking)

     There is no heaven or hell--only smoking or non-smoking
     (THE:heaven/smoking)

In fairness, there are about as many non-smoking buttons, and a
_lot_ of others. Some good ones at random:

     Think "HONK" if you're a telepath   (THI:think honk)

     Avoid cliches like the plague--they're a dime a dozen   (AVO:$0.10)

     Campus Crusade for Cthulhu--It found me   (CAM:campus crusade)

     Hail to the Sun God! He is the Fun God! Ra! Ra! Ra! (HAI:ra!)

     Migratory lifeform with a tropism for bookstores   
     (MIG:tropism/bookstores)

     Invertebrate Punster--Spinelessly unable to resist a pun--So slug me!
     (INV:invertebrate punster) 

     Back off, man--I'm a scientist   (BAC:Back off/scientist)

     Hail to the Sun God! He is the Fun God! Ra! Ra! Ra!   (HAI:ra!)

     Student of the Harry Tuttle school of Revolutionary Plumbing
     (STU:tuttle/plumbing) 

     Seppuku button(tm)--to use, fold back pin   (SEP:seppuku)

And, especially for Bill Thacker,

     Humpty Dumpty was pushed   (HUM:dumpty)


And she also does custom ones. I noticed, though, that her stock
has a Serious Shortcoming - no pipe or cigar buttons. Would anyone
be interested in inventing a slogan or two, and getting a custom
button made? Let's talk!

Until Digest #122, then,

					Smoke in peace,

					~\U Steve.

Subject: Pipes Digest #121 - December 3, 1993

&gt;   &gt; I, as a Canadian, can bring Cuban cigars into the United States for my
&gt;   &gt; own personal use.  It is only illegal if I sell them or give them to
&gt;   &gt; somebody else.  That's why they sell them in the Duty Free.
&gt;
&gt;   Damn. A Canadian just came down to visit, and all I ordered was a haggis.

That's news to me - It was definately NOT true in the 70s. 
Cuban products are BANNED in the United States - it matters not who owns
them. (The trick is to get them into an embassy via diplomatic pouch.)
Cuban cigars would be confiscated (or destroyed, depending on the agent) at
the border. Canadians had the option of returning to Canada and keeping
their cigars or "destroying them". Americans simply had them confiscated.
Occasionally, a "liberal" agent would allow the "distruction" by smoking on
the spot. I have heard stories of this happening as recently as August of
1993. (By the way, "personal use" is a formal customs term, which
translates into 4 cigars - per trip - they don't consider duration - if I
remember correctly. 2 packs of cigaretts and 4oz of pipe tobacco.)

And as for the Haggis - they are easily enough acquired here in the states.
However, given the recent tax increases, a request for a bottle of Laphroaig
might be considered a reasonable compromise.

&gt;   &gt; According to my old tobacconist in Pittsburgh (Ivan at Continental), 
&gt;   &gt; Latakia is processed over fires of dried camel dung.  Any tobacco
&gt;   &gt; experts out there care to comment?
&gt;
&gt;   Dung is a traditional fuel throughout most of the world. I've read that
&gt;   it's over a fire of herbs; I much prefer to believe that :-)

This must explain why I and many other latakia fans have always described
the "scent" (and had it described to us) as "buring camel dung."

However, I don't believe that ANY tobacco is "dried" over a fire. Although I 
could see the already "dired and aged" leaves "smoked" to provide a flavor.
But then, all the references I can find to Latakia call it either an
"oriental spice" tobacco, or simply "Turkish Latakia." Hmm, I'll have to
see if I can find any other references to its "curing."

&gt;   From: ???????@??????????.???.?? (Martin Ott)
&gt;   Subject: Pipes, Tobacco and AD&amp;D2nd
&gt;
&gt;   I would like to ask you for some information on making pipes and
&gt;   tobacco. Sure I could read a book or look it up in an encyclopedia.
&gt;   But I think I need the knowledge of people who have actual expereince
&gt;   in doing these crafts.
&gt;
&gt;   AD&amp;D2nd is short for Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition.  .....
&gt;   ... Our group is very story oriented
&gt;   and very often invent a new skill/proficiency which is not in the
&gt;   official rule book. Recently, my bard started to learn the trade of
&gt;   crafting tobacco pipes. 

Danger Will Robinson, Danger.... (Steve, you may not believe this but...)
Axler, Otto and I are still playing together - although we "retired" Axler's
world (1980-88) and moved to Otto's world (1984-current). But we never
spent the money on the 2nd edition (except for Wild Magic.) We have been
known to spend as long describing the "dinner" we were ordering from the
local Inn as we did dispatching monsters. However, I must say that recently
(since we all grew up) we have taken to "tasting wine" along with our D&amp;D
to the point where we are running something like 2-3 game sessions
(typically a 6 hour Saturday about every 6 weeks) per hour of game time.

At any rate, the most logical type of pipe for the period (ignoring the
Hobbits) is the "tavern pipe". This was a "clay pipe." It typically had a
very long stem, when new. This was because the pipes were EXPENSIVE,
probably in the 50-100 GP range (assuming "fine dinner with ale" at the
Inn costs 5GP - you'll have to shift and shuffle to match the economy of
your world. Fine ale is typically 1gp/tankard. Cheap beer 2-3 sp. Wine is
VERY expenisve as viticulture is "reserved" to the clerical folks - a glass
of wine might go for 10-15GP if you can get it. Similarly distilled
spirits, are in the 10-15GP range PER gill! Again, typically restricted to
"sacramental" uses... but if you have a cleric of Thor!!! Fine dinner would
be a hank of meat and potatoes, carrots and onions. Normal dinner would be
"stone soup" - a thin stew (or maybe gruel) which had the bones left from
the "fine diners" tossed in for flavor.

Back to the "tavern pipe." A tavern owner kept a rack of pipes on the wall
which he "rented" to customers for an after dinner smoke. His "regulars"
might have a marked pipe kept aside for them. All other would "share" a
pipe. This sharing was accomplished by breaking off about 2 inches of the
pipe for each new customer. Hence a "tavern pipe" with a 2 foot long stem
would eventually shorten itself down to a "billiard" shape with a 6 inch
stem after a number of customers.

&gt;   What do you need to make a pipe.  (Tools, woods, workshop or 'on the
&gt;   road')
&gt;
&gt;   How long does it take to make a pipe.  (Experience, tools, wisdom,
&gt;   dexterity, patient wife...)
&gt;
Hmmm. Since we are essentailly talking about "pottery" here. A good source
of "firing clay," a mould would most likely work better than a "wheel".
(the 2 halves are created separately and then stuck together in a
"finishing" step. That's how you get the hole in the stem since you can't
"pour" clay, only force it in a mold.) The mold would be "hand carved" and
probably good for some arbitrary number of "castings." Then it would break,
wear out, etc - probably a D12's worth. Now you could add "high tech" to
this mould by making it of 3 pieces. Piece 1 is the outside shape of the
pipe (bowl and stem). This would be "filled" with clay. Then the "inside" 
pressed into this - half the bowl and smoke hole. Then the Flat back of the
mold "scraped accross the front and attached so as to make the whole ready
for firing. Hmm... what would you make the mold out of that wouldn't burn.
Or maybe it would, in which case 1 mould = 1 pipe.

&gt;   Anything else to know ?  (If you have some historical knowledge, it
&gt;   would be very welcome.)
&gt;
A "Missouri Meershaum" (croncob pipe) can last a long or short time, mostly
depending upon the care with which the "cake" is burned on and how
frequenly it is used "and abused."

"Obviously?" A "traveling man" would need something in which to carry his
or her pipe which would protect it against pummelling and the like. So an
obvious "side line" would be the crafting of a carying case for the pipe.

&gt;   A crude pipe can be made by an eight-year-old with a pocket knife. (I
&gt;   know from personal experience. :-) But it takes a fair amount of
&gt;   woodworking skill to make a good one.  Depending on the tools you're
&gt;   using, and the effects you're trying for, it can take from an
&gt;   afternoon to a week.

I used to make pipes out of acorns and nails. They didn't smoke very well,
but they looked the part. Yeah, it was probably around eight years old.
About the time that one got the first pocket knife from Cub Scouts or 
whatever.

Subject: The Big Question (one of them, anyway)

Hi Steve.
Greetings to all.

	I'm about to bring up a subject that may be wholly unpopular,
but what the hell. I'm not looking for arguments, only for
information.
	How many people that smoke pipes are really concerned about
mouth cancer?  I'm one who doesn't really care.  (i.e. we're all going
to die...)  I want to know what the level of concern is here, whether
there's any good material to read on the fallicies/truths involved in
the cancer issue, etc.  I've spoken to people about it, but I would
sooner trust a group like this to know the truths about the subject.
Answer with care, please.  I'm not looking for offhanded remarks.
	Thanks.
	Also, regarding the subject of How to Smoke a Pipe, I know
there are some who would say, "Just smoke the damn thing."  Others,
however, would give small tips about what should &amp; shouldn't be done
when smoking a pipe to make it most enjoyable.  I'm looking for a
handful of these little tips, so I can compare it to how I smoke.
Excellence is a matter of habits, so tell me how you might achieve
excellence in the minor habits of smoking a pipe.

[ Well, personally, I'm concerned to the point that I'm really trying
to avoid tongue bite these days. It's more pleasurable that way, too.
BTW, I'd like the other readers here to feel OK about discussing
health issues here; I'll post concerns, but not flames. Glad you felt
comfortable enough to bring it up, David!

And that also brings up something on the "How To" topic: lately, I've
been smoking only half-bowls, because the full ones get pretty gamey
toward the end, and have more tendency to bite. Does anyone else do
this? -S. ]

Subject: Where to buy tobacco and pipes in Philadelphia area

I'm a digester on this list and don't get a chance to respond very fast.
Apologies if this repeates.

At any rate, discussion earlier touched on Philadelphia tobacco shops
and I'd like to plug a good one, The Tobacco Village in the Roosevelt Mall.
Yes, a Mall tobacco shop worthy of the name.

The proprieter is Louise Hood and her hysband Irv.  
Louise is probably more knowledgable about 
tobacco than most of the men that enter her shop.

The stock is wide ranging, including pipes from some local (PA) carvers
plus most of the best Italian and English pipes, signed meerchaums 
and all of the major pipe tobaccos, including the Levin/McClellen line
Bengal Slices, et al.
(Holt's shop long ago moved the pipe tobacco to the rear of the store and the
expensive pens to the front -- this was a business consideration to be sure,
but it's a shame the place is not what it was, at least for pipes, cigars
are still their forte)

I'm not trying to be an ad for Louise, or anything, it's just one of the best
shops I've been in.  And a friendly place, too, as most tobacco shops are.

If you're in the area, the number is (215) 331-0216
The Roosevelt Mall is on Roosevelt Blvd, which is US route 1 north through
Phila.

Best regards for the Holidays,

Subject: Buttons

If you're a great fan of wearing buttons, but you're disappointed
because you can't find the slogans you want, here's a tip:

Go to a local craft store and ask for "Kelly's Fun Buttons". The front
of "Fun Button" pops right off, so anything you can print on a small
circle of paper can instantly be made into a button. 

I print up pages of buttons all the time using DTP programs.

And she'll do special orders of one button, too. -S. ]

Sorry that this took so long to get to you, but I've been busy.

	I've been lurking around the mail group, reading what has been
posted and have decided to introduce myself.  My name is Brent Williams, and
I am a sophmore at Indiana University.

	I started smoking pipes a year ago, and am still new at it.

	I noticed a few issues back that someone(I can't remember who), asked
if there were any younger pipe smokers out here.  I am 19, so I guess I 
qualify.  Anyway, My thanks for allowing me into this group and I hope to
have more to say later.

[ Thanks for the belated intro, Brent! -S. ]

Hi Steve,
thanks for the help with building pipes / growing tobacco.
Meanwhile I received 2 more direct emails from other
list members, both of which know that game.

After I wrote something up for the game,
I will certainly let you and the list know,
if not post it.

Subject: introducing myself...

	well, i've only recently started smoking a pipe.  it's got all
	the makings for a great hobby for me: stuff to collect, taste
	to enjoy, and it's a bit off-center :-)  i've got four pipes
	so far, and am trying a variety of tobaccos.  i've got a
	problem that needs to be rectified before i can really get
	into pipes: mine go out too often.  i'm sure this is something
	everyone who smokes has to figure out, but i'm having troubles.
	Gregory Pease has helped quite a bit, but i want to smoke to
	relax, usually when reading or walking, and i don't want to
	have to stop every couple of minutes or so to relight.  so any
	pointers would be appreciated.  at worst, i'll just switch to
	cigars which i can seem to keep going :-)  part of my problem
	probably lies in the fact that i don't have a lot of time to
	devote to this.  i need to smoke outside, when doing something
	else, and it's been a bit cold here recently :-(  that's about
	it, i'm looking forward to reading the digest...

Thanks!
BTW, I am all for a rec.tobacco (or similar) group to get away from all
the whiny anti-smokers on alt.smokers.  Seems like there are very few
people posting cigar/pipe items on there anymore since it became a
big bitch group.  Thank goodness for your Digest.
While I am at it, would it be much of a hassle to get some backissues?
I started with about issue 115, so would appreciate to get the 4 or 5
issues before that.  Is there any FTP site for the backissues?

Thanks, 
Mark K.

[ Never a problem getting back issues. BTW, I'm planning on
re-proposing a Big 7 tobacco newsgroup around April/May, when the
6-month period from the last rec.tobacco proposal is up. -S. ]

Subject: Re: alt.cigars/rec.tobacco

  IMHO, we can endure the flamage in alt.smokers (and a two-entry
twit filter would take care of most if it.)
  With the goal of having a real, moderated, rec.tobacco next
summer, I'd rather keep all the good high-signal stuff in one
place (alt.smokers.)

  If there were alt.cigars, I would ask again what I asked on
alt.smokers, and if there were any answers I missed them:
  What with so many people enjoying cigars, I thought I'd give
them a try.  I like Turkish Special cigarettes, and their Pipo
tobacco, or something sweet like Mango Cavendish.
  So far I've tried the following:
    Canaria d'oro (baby 65c) -- harsh, nothing good about it
    Juan Clemente (Demitasse $2.10) -- Nicely strong, but more bitter than sweet
    Royal Jamaican (Pirate $1.80) -- Too Weak taste, what little there was
             was mainly metallic or sour, possible hint of sweetness
 And today I picked up:
    Danneman Menor Sumatra small cigars
    Henry Clay
    Petrus
 and Cake Box Connecticut Valley

  (Tonight I'm going to a Hanukah Party at the home of a friend who
smokes a lot and well -- what better way to celebrate the Festival
of Lighting Up?)

 Any suggestions for other varieties I might enjoy?

      - David Chesler (??????@?????.???)

[ While not as dedicated a cigar buff as others on the mailgroup, I
seem to like Upmanns, and I tried a Pleaides the other night that I
enjoyed. In small cigars, Panters and Henri Winterman spring to mind.
I'd also appreciate other what-to-try ideas! -S. ]

Subject: Home-made pipes

  I vaguely recall from childhood trips to historic villages (which were
Dutch in greater New York) that clay pipes were built not with two pieces,
but with a "lost wax" method.  (I'd guess any world advanced enough to
have fine clay, and that with which to light their pipes, would have
some form of wax -- bees or tallow.)  The wax is formed into where the
hole goes, the clay is formed around the hole, and then when the clay is
fired the wax runs out.

  Now two folks have posted that it's easy to make corn cob pipes:  Although
the season for fresh sweet corn is departed in New England, please tell!

  I did bring two Cuban cigars home from Canada in 1978 (before I knew what
to do with them, and it was a high school bus trip, so I didn't actually 
declare anything through customs.)  Considering what other intoxicants we 
had on board, commie tobacco was probably the least thing to worry about.
(My impression, not based on hard sources, is that US citizens and businesses
may not do business with Cuba, but not that Cuban products were always
forbidden [as is the case now with ivory] although I could well be wrong,
especially if things changed in the last decade.)

     - David Chesler (??????@?????.???)


[ Well, I wouldn't recommend using a wet ear of sweet corn for this,
David! What you need are: one dry corncob (you can usually find these
around farms, or use an Indian-corn Thanksgiving decoration), one dry
hollow milkweed stem (the kind with the long thin seed pods), and a
pocket knife. Cut the milkweed stem to about six inches and break a
two-inch length off the corncob. Hollow out the cob to within about
1/4 inch from the bottom, and drill a hole in the side with the knife.
The stem should fit snugly in the hole and should come in just above
the cob insides you left at the bottom of the bowl. Fill with tobacco
and enjoy! 

BTW, the tobak that smokes best with this procedure is the kind you
steal from your dad.  For complete authenticity, sneak out into the
woods to light up. :-) -S. ]

Subject: Cigars

This is my first posting to the group.

I am a Macanudo and Hoyo fan.  Been smoking Macanudos for over 15
years now.  I particularly love a smoke accompanied by a good Island
Malt Whisky (like Lagavulin or Laphroaig).  I prefer the ring sizes
around 50 and 6-8 inch in length.

I have purchased Cuban cigars (Upmann, Los Statos, and Cohiba all
Havanas), and brought them into the US with impunity. Most recently at
the duty-free shop right at the Los Cabos airport in Baja.  Private
citizens were not prohibited from buying them outside the US and
bringing them in in limited numbers for their own use.  As I
understand it, direct trade with Cuba is the issue - not cigars.  I
have also had friends ship them to me from Guantanamo Bay!  I have
noticed that Havanas have gone down in quality considerably in the
last 5 years.  My last batch of Cohibas were nothing special at all,
and when I heard that Davidoff has stopped making Cubans, that did it
for me.

I recently purchased a couple of 18 inch (! that's right !) Generals
(ring size 60).  Has anyone dared to try one of these yet.  I'm
waiting for a 5-6 hour stretch when I can sit down and light that
model up!  Another new one I've been trying, along the milder side
like Macanudo, is Avo.  Anyone tried them?

I have had a problem with a large percentage of my Hoyo Excaliburs
lately.  They do not burn evenly, and frequently unravel!  Is anyone
else experincing this difficulty?  Great flavor, but the construction
seems to be poor lately.

Well, happy smoking,

Ron Nadel

[ Thanks for the word, Ron! BTW, Cigar Aficionado had an article in a
recent issue about single-malt whiskys, including the unpronouncable
kinds. -S. ]

Modest pipe and pipe tobacco selection, huge room-size cigar humidor.
Pens a specialty.  Mail order.

        Address for Holt's is 114 S. 16th street  Philadelphia, PA 19102
        800-523-1641.  I agree the store is not what it used to be for pipes
        or anyone interested in talking about pipes or tobacco.  They do have 
        several good blends...Burlington Arcade is an old blend Holt's took 
        over, a flake cut easy to pack with nice flavor and aroma.Their blend
        101 is mild but very aromatic...a good beginners smoke.  Concerning 
        Tobacco shop blends it has been my experience that they are often too 
        moist, I tend to leave several ounces spread out on newspaper or in
        old baking tins to dry out, this gets some curious looks in my office 
        and we won't go in to what my wife has to say about it at home.  I'm
        wondering if anyone out there has tried drying out tobacco in an oven
        or if they would suggest or discourage such an activity.  I prefer
        a dry tobacco I think it burns better and makes for a more relaxed
        smoke. Thoughts on cancer.  Moderation.  If I'm going out to 
        spend a night drinking beer and talking I'll switch to cigaretts or 
        a H. Upmann 2000, I try to limit pipes to 2 bowls a day.  I am of the
        ilk that believes there is a strong genetic component to cancer so I
        would suggest a good look at the family tree.

[ Too bad about Holt's; I used to love that place when I was an
undergraduate. Ah, well... -S. ]

I have two suggestions for you: 1) Try some of the Honduran handmades;
they are generally more robust in taste, and closer to the old style
havanas.  Some of the best values right now IMHO, are the "Hoyo de
Monterrey" and "Punch" (actually made by the same factory) brands.
2) Try some of the higher quality, more complex, but still not very
heavy, Dominican handmades.  Two of the best lines in the world right
now (again IMHO), are the "Arturo Fuente" and the "Partagas" brands.
Try any of the thicker than 45 ring Fuentes, or the Partagas #10.
Sublime!!!

&gt;     - David Chesler (??????@?????.???)

Hope this helps a little

[ I agree about the Partagas, so far... -S. ]

Subject: Importing Cuban cigars

There are, in fact, two ways to import Cuban cigars legally in the
United States:

1. If you are a U.S. citizen and you visit Cuba itself, you are
allowed to bring back up to 100 Cuban cigars, worth up to $400, for
personal use.  The catch is that the only U.S. citizens allowed to
travel to Cuba are people who have relatives there, and scholars,
journalists, and diplomats traveling on business.

2. If you are not a U.S. citizen, you may bring in Cuban cigars for
personal use.  I'm not sure how many you're allowed to bring, but I
imagine the rules are the same as for U.S. citizens returning from
Canada.  I stopped at a duty-free shop along the Quebec-Vermont border
a few months ago, and they were selling Montecristos and Bances from
Havana, but only to non-Americans.  The only place to go when you
leave the parking lot of this shop is over the bridge to the U.S.

Someone said earlier that "personal use" meant you can't sell or give
them away; I doubt, however, that giving them as a gift violates the
law.  Selling them probably would, however.

Cheers,
James Taranto  ???????@?????.???

[ Well, the "journalist" thing is easy to use... a friend of mine
travels there routinely and just writes a samizdat article when she
comes back. But... you can bring them back from Cuba, but not from
Canada????? -S. ]

Hey Steve,

Good question -  how many of us are hams?  I'm KC6TXU, licensed since
1991 and currently hold an Advanced license (though my code speed is
probably about 1 or 2 WPM now!!).  Speaking of walking around hamfests - 
we have one here in the summer at a local JC, and one of the goodies I
found there last year was a circular pipe rack whose center pillar
was carved in the shape of an 807 transmitting tube!

Subject: Re:  Subscription

Thanks for the welcome. I'm a pipe smoker of many years standing,
having started in 1962 or thereabouts. I quit for a number of years in
between, then picked it up again around 1980. I not that you listed
Pipeworks in NYC; I have dealt with them from time to time. Their own
pipes, made by Elliot Nachwalter, are excellent.

My favorite pipemaker is not currently listed, so here it is:

   S&amp;R WoodCrafts
   4244 East Main Street
   Colombus, OH 43213
   800-828-2535
   614-235-6422

"S" and "R" are Steve and Roswitha Anderson. Both are pipemakers. Steve does
primarily high quality classic pipes, and Rose makes mostly freehands, also
of very high quailty. Their regular pipes range from $65 to $300, and they
have some specials that run into several thousand (such as a 7 day set, all
straight grain with curved smokeholes).

They also have an excellent set of tobacco blends which they ship anywhere.
They offer an automatic delivery program.

They appear at a few craft shows during the summer.

That's all I have for now--I'll probably send more after I read the digest
thoroughly.

Larry

[ Thanks for the word, Larry! Don't own any S&amp;R pipes, but I had a
chat with Roswitha a while ago, at a show in Arlington, VA, about how
to make the curved shank holes. Verrry interesting!  -S. ]

I just got the Gold Medal sampler from Thompson.  It has 6 different
styles of cigars, 42 cigars in all, for $12.90.  If you're looking
for a quick way to try several styles of reasonable cigars, this is
it.  Most seem to be short filers, but all have a nice taste.  (Even
my wife didn't object to smell of all but one style!)

Hi.  Thanks for putting me on your list.  You asked for some info about
myself so... I am 40 years old, teach philosophy, married with children,
have smoked pipes off and on for 15 years.  Used to live in New York, 
now in California, but I still get my pipe supplies from Connoisseur
Pipe Shop in NY.  They are the best I've found.  Make their own pipes, 
mix their own tobaccos.  I do not have an elaborate pipe collection -
only three briars of comfortable if not magnificent quality.  And I 
agree that pipe smoking is the king of smoking pleasures.

[ I think many of us would, although we'd have contention from the
cigar buffs and the single-malt and brandy aficionados... Welcome! -S.]

Welcome to new members:

	Ted Clark		(Edward. ?.?????.???.@?????????.???)
	Jim Richmond		(????????@???.???.???.???)
	Vichu Tanta-Nanta	(????????@???.??.???)

And welcome to the Holiday Issue of the Pipes Digest! The guy in the
red suit has left me the Comeback of the Week:

	"Is it the smoke that bothers you, or the sight of someone
	 enjoying himself?"

				- From "101 Ways to Answer the
				  Question, 'Would You Please Put Out
				  that #(!&amp;*!$ Cigar'," Hague et. al.,
				  1987. 

He also left a cookie file of the shortest and best of the 101 Ways,
which I'll put in the header every now and then. The file should be
suitable for use with fortune(6), perhaps with minor tweeking
necessary. If anyone wants a copy for their own personal use, please
send mail and we'll ship it out Reindeer Express.

In the meantime, we'll continue the Cuban Debates, indulge in some
hamming activities, review some fine cigars, and of course have plenty
of good smokes for the holidays. Enjoy! -S.

Re: Question about bringing Cubans into the US

	If anyone wants, I would be more than happy to contact US
Customs and ask them the details of the official regulations about
bringing Cuban cigars into the country. (It's nice to live in the home
town of the Federal Government. :) )

	But I need to ask you to change my subscription address from
????@???????.???????.????????.??? to ???@????.???. The machine I use
now will be inactive between tomorrow and January 8th, and any mail
sent to an address here will bounce. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Unless I hear otherwise (at the address above), I will assume that
people want me to send the results in for publication.)

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #123 - December 17, 1993

Steve- ran across a few questions in digest #123 that I can respond to. 
Cuban cigars in Mexico?  Good luck folks!  I looked high and low during at
least three different trips in the 1980s.  On one of these trips I spent a
lot of time in Mexico city and even there could not turn up a single
Havana.  Personally, I am not at all fond of the Mexican brands sold in
the U.S., but I tried a few down there which are not available here that
were remarkably good.  By the way, there is one way that most any American
citizen can get to Cuba- that way being directly from Mexico.  You get the
visa for Cuba in Mexico, and from what friends have told me, neither the
Mexican nor the Cuban authorities  cause any problem.  Of course, if one
somehow ended up with a Cuban stamp in a U.S. passport, the U.S.
authorities might not be amused upon one's return from Mexico.  I tried a
large Avo cigar recently and thought it was excellent- they do seem
awfully expensive however.  As for the Hoyo's burning unevenly, I have
always had that problem with them.  I think it may have to do with their
wrappers- at least in the maduro.  Has anybody tried the new Rey del Mundo
line just out from the Dominican Republic?  Happy Holidays.

Subject: Another ham

QRZ de N8JYV - QTH Columbus, OH - nm hr is Steve!
   
   Yes, another pipe-smoking ham here.  After 15 years of cigarettes, I
took up the pipe in order to give my idle hands something to do.  For the
past 8 years or so, I have enjoyed my pipe.  My favorite pipe is my trusty
little Dr. Grabow Bucko - a small bowl, and half-bowls are enough to make
me happy during my breaks at my "smoke-free environment" workplace (however
recently the outside temps here in the Midwest make me hurry thru them a
lot quicker than I would like!)

   My favorite blend is called Cade's Cove Cavendish from the Gatlin-Burlier
in Gatlinburg, TN - it's a nice aromatic with a pleasant taste - not the wet
taste one finds with the commercial domestic aromatics!  It smells so nice
I can usually get away with puffing it in no-smoking zones such as department
stores without criticism - usually someone will go out of their way to say
how nice it smells!

   The big advantage is while at the keyboard (I am sysop for a packet BBS
here) I can set the pipe down while I type, and when I need a moment to get
my thoughts on the right track I can light it back up again, take a few puffs,
and continue - not like letting a cigarette burn away in the ashtray!  And no
longer do I have to smell the harsh chemicals the cigarette manufacturers use
to keep the paper from burning faster than the tobac - no formaldehyde or
other nasal irritants!  Just a nice, natural burning smell.

   I was a bit miffed when I went to a nice restaurant in the area recently
and found printed on the front of their menu that cigarette smoking was ok,
but pipes and cigars were not allowed!  Of course, we all have smelled some
rank cigars, and some pipe tobaccos aren't real pleasing either (I personally
can't stand Latakia - smells and tastes like soap to me!) - but I was real
tempted to fire up my cavendish to see if anyone would complain!  I didn't,
but I can almost bet I would have gotten more compliments on the smell than
complaints!

   Ham radio is both my hobby and my business (which I don't want to go into
right now), and interfacing my radios to my computers gives me long (and late)
hours of entertainment!  I don't do much HF, and VHF/UHF repeaters are a turn-
off to me for the most part.  I do participate in some ham/computer nets in
the area on a regular basis, and spend most of my time on 2-meter simplex -
occasionally some SSB, but not very often.  My interest is digital communica-
tions (PACKET RACKET!!!) on VHF, and am currently experimenting with TCP/IP
gateways from ax.25 packet to the Internet.  The major drawback is that any-
thing going from Internet to the airwaves MUST be read and approved before
transmission so as not to jeopardize my license - but we have the gateway
free-running from the airwaves to the Internet, so who knows?  We may see
some more hams using their radios to access lists like this one!

   Surely there are some more pipe-smoking hams out there - CQ CQ CQ?

   73 to all, and best wishes for a great holiday season!

I can't remember who makes it, but I saw a distinctly right-handed
pipe a few days ago.  Also it's left-hand counterpart.  If you use the
wrong hand, you'll cook yourself practically.  It ran about $400.00 or
so.  Had a deep bowl, and a nice grain, but seemed awfully heavy;
however, it looked like a nice "outdoor" pipe.

Subject: Pipe tobaccos

        I just recently aquired a used pipe, a very interesting one to say
the least. Its got a leather "coating?" around the whole thing except the
inside and the part you put in your mouth (I know NO terminology, sorry!).
Does anyone have any ideas on how I can identify this pipe?

        Since this is my first pipe I am shopping around for some pipe
packing that I might like. I have no idea what to try and am looking for
some suggestions. I've seen at stores large bags of tobacco (rum smoked?
that one caught my eye) at Fred Myers and such but I didn't want to commit
to a large bag of the stuff especially if I found it especially repulsive.
Does anyone know where I can get some sampler tobaccos for the pipe? It
would be nice to have like several little baggies of say a pipe full that
you could experiment. This sort of thing probably does't exist however...
:)

Any suggestions on some good ones to try?

Micah

[ Well, I'd say try a nice mild aromatic cavendish to start... you're
definitely right not to buy a huge amount of tobak until you know your
own tastes. Most smokeshops would be happy to make up a sampler for
you. Among national brands, Amphora Blue, Sail, or Skandinavik would
all be good bets. And, re terms, I think "cover," "tobacco hole," and
"stem" are the coating, the inside, and the part you put in your
mouth, respectively. Though others might have a different preference
:-) -S. ]

Subject: Greetings / Cigars / Handrolling?

First off, my belated introduction to the list.  I've been reading for
a while now but never got around to introducing myself.  Anyhow, I'm a
student at the University of Texas.  I joined this list after hearing
about it during the rec.tobacco CFV.

I must confess that I was primarily interested in discussing quality
cigarettes rather than the more upscale stuff like pipes and cigars.
However, much of the talk on here has got me interested (see below).
Does anyone here roll cigarettes?  If so, what type of tobacco do you
like to use?  I am extremely fond of American Spirit.  It's amazingly
smooth, a handrolled AS goes down smoother than some "light" big-name
cigarettes.  Three Castles is nice, but expensive.  Very tasty, to
boot.

With all this talk about cigars floating by me, I decided to head down
to the tobacconist and see what it's all about.  I bought three
cigars: a Partagas (very small around, I think it was called "No. 1"
but not sure), a Arturo Fuente (I think this one was called "Gaucho",
it was bigger than the Partagas with a dark wrapper), and a generic
Jamaican with a light wrapper. The Jamaican was OK, but I liked the
darker cigars better.  The Partagas and the AF were both great.  I
tried these two based on the reccomendations I'd read here.  I don't
know what it's worth from a virgin cigar smoker, but I would heartily
second the reccomendation.  The AF was big, tasty, and cost only
$0.85.  It was a little hard to smoke, though, and toward the end it
was running rather badly and getting hot.  The Partagas was great too.
Tasted even better than the AF and didn't have any of the burning
problems.

So, I'm hooked.  My cigar-smoking experiment was thoroughly enjoyable.
Can anybody tell me what the cigars "representative" of the various
styles of tobacco are, so I can check them out too?

And sorry to the pipe smokers, but I don't think I'm quite ready to
have a go at that yet.  I have all the equipment I need for a stogie
(mouth) but I'd have to go buy a pipe to try pipe-smoking.

Subject:      cigar thoughts

Hello All,

I have recently began enjoying the fascinating world of fine cigars.
What an incredible hobby! I am beginning to see that one can truly
enjoy and respect fine tobacco without abusing it, like I did for so
many years with cigarettes. I am truly enjoying all the good pipe and
cigar reports from you who are more seasoned in this world! Keep 'em
coming.

I've tried three good ones at this point. The first was an Arturo
Fuente. I believe it was Churchill sized. It was from the cheaper
Fuente line, in a natural wrapper, and it was a good, mild smoke.
Cost about $.70 as I remember. I then tried a Montesino, with natural
wrapper. At about $2.75 it was well worth the money...a mild and
flavorful smoke. The best yet, was an Arturo Fuente Flora Fina 8-7-8
in a maduro wrapper. This cigar was nothing short of delicious! Its
burn was completely even, and it held up all the way. I enjoyed it
down to about two inches, but I could have gone further with more
time. This is without a doubt the finest cigar I have smoked to date.
At $1.60, it is *well* worth twice that, IMHO.  It is the first one
that I have considered buying a full box of. Anyone else have any
experience with this cigar? If it gets any better than this, I cant
wait to smoke 'em!

Happy Holidays....a box of good cigars would make a wonderful
Christmas present....!

Steve

   Thanks for the prompt action on adding me to the group. I'm 39 yrs
old, married w/children, pipe/cigar smoker, wine drinker esp. port.
I'm a system engineer but NOT a computer geek. Consider myself a
regular guy. I have about a dozen pipes but I seem to be on a cigar
kick lately. Reading Cigar Aficionada really gets me in the mood. At
this time I'm fond of Onyx 750s or 650s and I just tried a Dunhill
that I loved but know little about. It was 6" with approx. 50 ring and
a natural wrapper. It was great. Looks like I should try Pauls in
Flint if its legendary since I live in the area. thanks again.

how it is! -S.]

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #123 - December 17, 1993

&gt;several good blends...Burlington Arcade is an old blend Holt's took
&gt;over, a flake cut easy to pack with nice flavor and aroma.Their
&gt;blend 101 is mild but very aromatic...a good beginners smoke.
&gt;Concerning Tobacco shop blends it has been my experience that they
&gt;are often too moist, I tend to leave several ounces spread out on
&gt;newspaper or in old baking tins to dry out, this gets some curious
&gt;looks in my office and we won't go in to what my wife has to say
&gt;about it at home.  I'm wondering if anyone out there has tried
&gt;drying out tobacco in an oven or if they would suggest or discourage
&gt;such an activity.  I prefer a dry tobacco I think it burns better
&gt;and makes for a more relaxed smoke.

At work we use a large oven to dry beakers, powders, etc.  When I
started here, the manager would empty his fresh tobacco into a large
size beaker and put it in the oven for ~10 min.  He then would add
alcohol to re-moisten it for smoking.  This process didn't remove
much of the flavorings he liked, it was still moist so it was easy to
fill a pipe, and the ethanol made it burn faster.

Another coworker kept peach brandy on the submarine he was stationed
on to moisten his tobacco.  At least once a week, the captain would
stop by to "see what we were smoking tonight."  After a chat, the
captain would go on with his rounds.  And who says you can't have
your whiskey and smoke it too?

&gt;I just got the Gold Medal sampler from Thompson.  It has 6 different
&gt;styles of cigars, 42 cigars in all, for $12.90.  If you're looking
&gt;for a quick way to try several styles of reasonable cigars, this is
&gt;it.  Most seem to be short filers, but all have a nice taste.  (Even
&gt;my wife didn't object to smell of all but one style!)

&gt;[ Great, Neil! To save the flood of requests, how does one order the
&gt;Gold Medal Sampler? -S. ]

Since it was in the Resource Guide, I omitted it, figuring that was
common knowledge.  Here it is:

Hi Everyone

	I'm just getting started on this newsletter, this is going to
be wonderful.  Well lets see a little about me.  Well I'm a chemistry
student at Boston University and just started smoking last year (both
pipes and cigars).  It started from curiosity (how can people like
burning a plant so much) and now I just plain love it.  I like larger
cigars ~50 ring and 7+ inches is nice (Avo, Glorias, Punch, Griffin,
are some of my favorite).  As for pipes I haven't quite developed and
attachements (for pipes or tobacco) yet and would love any
suggestions.

	Hey thanks a bunch :)

Subject: Cigar reviews, and other assortments..

Hello Steve, et.al...

Enjoyed digest #123, and thought I would make some comments, and
also review some of the cigars I've tried lately.

But first..

Ron Nadel (?????@????.????????.???) says:

&gt;I am a Macanudo and Hoyo fan.  Been smoking Macanudos for over 15
&gt;years now.  I particularly love a smoke accompanied by a good Island
&gt;Malt Whisky (like Lagavulin or Laphroaig).  I prefer the ring sizes
&gt;around 50 and 6-8 inch in length.

I haven't really tried Macanudos, but Hoyas are a favorite; never
a dull smoke with them, that's for sure.  My SO thought Lagavulin
tasted like a dentist's office; I love Lagavulin - gofigure :)
I also love a fine cigar with a great bourbon.  I still have a
small bit of Maker's Mark Gold Top 101 left.  Too bad it's not
being made for American consuption anymore :( .  Maker's Mark
Red Top will have to do (it's excellent too).  I also prefer
larger ring sizes and 5-8" length.

&gt;I recently purchased a couple of 18 inch (! that's right !) Generals
&gt;(ring size 60).  Has anyone dared to try one of these yet.  I'm
&gt;waiting for a 5-6 hour stretch when I can sit down and light that
&gt;model up! 

Oh my lord..I have read about these and thought it was a misprint..
seems like one of these battleships would be an exercise in staying
power.  I have to admit that it would be *fun* though.

&gt;I have had a problem with a large percentage of my Hoyo Excaliburs
&gt;lately.  They do not burn evenly, and frequently unravel!  Is anyone
&gt;else experincing this difficulty?  Great flavor, but the construction
&gt;seems to be poor lately.

Hmmm, I haven't noticed this, but it has been a while since I've had
one.  I'm due for more soon; I'll be curious to see how they are.

----

David Chesler (???????@????.???????.???) wrote that he picked
up some Henry Clays...
I would be interested in knowing how you liked them (Henry Clay 
is one of the cigars that I'll be reviewing later in this tome).

&gt;And Marios H. Agrotes &lt;?????@??????.??????.???&gt; in response to: 
&gt;&gt;Any suggestions for other varieties I might enjoy?

&gt;says,

&gt;I have two suggestions for you: 1) Try some of the Honduran handmades;
&gt;they are generally more robust in taste, and closer to the old style
&gt;havanas.  Some of the best values right now IMHO, are the "Hoyo de
&gt;Monterrey" and "Punch" (actually made by the same factory) brands.

Powerful cigars that pack enormous flavor.

&gt;2) Try some of the higher quality, more complex, but still not very
&gt;heavy, Dominican handmades.  Two of the best lines in the world right
&gt;now (again IMHO), are the "Arturo Fuente" and the "Partagas" brands.
&gt;Try any of the thicker than 45 ring Fuentes, or the Partagas #10.
&gt;Sublime!!!

I agree completely!  I have not smoked a Fuente yet that I didn't 
thoroughly enjoy. 

----

I recently enjoyed some time off from the "how many lines of code can
one write per day" rat-race and spent a very relaxing long weekend in
Chicago.  Spent way too much on fine food, wine, jazz, cigars, and other 
decadent pleasures. (Any Mose Allison fans out there?)

A number of friends recommended that I check out the legendary Iwan
Ries &amp; Co. tobacconists.  Had a hell of a time finding the place (as
an out-of-towner, it's bad form to crane your neck up at the buildings,
so I don't - maybe if I had, I would've found the shop easier. They're
on the second floor of a tall building.)   Was worth it though.  Here
are the particulars (forgive me if this is old news):

Iwan Ries &amp; Co.

Chicago, IL 60603
phone: 1-800-621-1457 (24hours, 7days a week); (312) 372-1306
Fax  : (312) 372-1416
Talk to Tony Palacios (who was very helpful and made me feel welcome)

Reviews:
[Disclaimer: Richness, flavor, and smoothness do it for me.  I'm   ]
[not necessarily looking for a "mild" smoke. Your mileage may vary.]

H. Uppman Churchill : 46 x 5.5" 
Thought I would say a few words about these; I had posted an address
a while back to get a nice box of them for cheap.  After smoking all
ten that I received, I must say that overall, an excellent cigar.  
Moist almost to the point of softness, they were flavorful and rich
with a draw that was at times perhaps too free.  A good firm ash (only
Fuente Hemingways are firmer in my experience).  My only criticism
was an occasional uneven burn. It's sometimes said that a soft cigar 
with a loose draw is an example of poor construction; I tend to
believe that it's more an example of freshness.  They certainly were
not "mushy".

Don Diego Conn. #300 : 44 x 5.5"
Very nice, not particularly special.  Got a bit harsh too early.

Henry Clay Breavas Conserva : 46 x 5.5"
A very pleasant surprise. Enormously smooth, but not wimpy either.
Tasty, tasty, tasty..I had to remove the label to finish it :) 
One of my more "relaxing" smokes..

Cabanas : 44 x 5.5"
A good solid, very rich cigar wrapped in blackened Mexican maduro with
Java, Dominican and Mexican binder (is it common to have a "blended"
binder like this?) Even burn and a free draw. Tasted great with port..

Davidoff Gran Cru #2 : 43 x 6" ($7.85 each!)
I've found it impossible to find Davidoffs in Milwaukee, so when I
saw these at Iwan Ries, I thought, "why not?".  A fabulous smoke - 
rich with lots of power and intense flavor.  While this was objectively
as good as I've ever smoked, it wasn't worth $3-4 more than anything
I've ever smoked either.  Ash was nicely firm, nearly snowy white,
but for some reason, at about the 2-3 inch mark, it began burning
very unevenly and continued to for quite some time.  A bit disapointing.

A final note..I've been finding it very difficult to find Fuente
Hemingway Classics lately - Edward's here in Milwaukee has been out
for a couple of months now, and it looked like they were running
low at Iwan Ries.  Is this happening all over?

Thanks for listening,

regards,

Subject: Happy Holidays!

Hi, all,

Just a few holiday notes. Last weekend, I bought myself the Annual
Presents: A large Peterson sandblast Dublin with nickel shank, an
eight-pipe teakwood rack, the "`#(!&amp;*!$ Cigar'" book, and three
cigars.  This purchase was made at the smoke shop near Somerville
Circle, which was surprisingly well-stocked. If I can remember the
name, I'll throw it into the next Digest.

One of the three cigars was an Ashton maduro, which was a surprising
disappointment. _Very_ hard draw. But a different Ashton with a
lighter wrapper smoked fine.  Well, maybe it was a Bad Stogie Day...
The third is still waiting in my desk.

Also contacted a couple of the local organizations listed in the
Autumn Cigar Aficionado about cigar get-togethers. CCC had an
interesting idea - a casual Saturday afternoon meeting rather than the
formal dinner. Not being a tuxedo type, I appreciate that approach!
More info as it becomes available.

I'm off until January 3. Hope you and yours have a happy holiday, and
may your cigars draw easy, your pipes burn cool, and the smoke
encircle your head like a wreath. And if anyone should be so rude as
to demand that you put out your #(!&amp;*!$ Uppmann, just lean back, puff
thoughtfully, and let loose a merry reply:

	"No, and all God's blessings this holiday season."

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

Subject: Hello!

Hello to all!  I was happy to see a list that was devoted to one of my 
favorite seductions.  I have been smoking cigars for 15 years and am 
always on the lookout for a reasonably priced quality cigar.  One 
thing I've noticed over the years is that the price of a good 
cigar has been going up quickly.  I remember buying good-sized 
Royal Jamaicans (when the were made in Jamaica!) for less than $1. 
 Those days are sure gone now.  I've been trying the new cigars: 
AVO, PG, Credo, Temple Hall, Oscar, PG, etc, and except for the Temple 
Hall, I don't think they're worth it, IMHO.  Most of them are too 
mild and characterless. I freely admit that I tend to like the 
bigger, heavy cigars.  Lately, I've been smoking Las Cabrillas, 
Troya (kinda mild 'tho), Canaria D'Oro, bundled Punch, Te Amos, and most 
recently Henry Clay.  After I smoked a Henry Clay, I went back and bought 
a bundle!  Good cigar.

After finishing the faq, I noticed that my favorite cigar store isn't on 
the list!  I'm not sure if they do mail order, but I've gotten excellent 
service from Duke and Josh at Draper's Tobacco here in DC.  I work downtown 
and after buying a cigar at Drapers, I sometimes walk a few blocks to 
Lafayette Park across from the White House and smoke my purchase after 
lunch. I could swear I once saw Bill wave at me from the window with a big 
Cohiba in his hand!  ;-)

Hi Steve
  de K3JSZ.  Picked up my Novice back in June of 59.  I may have
smoked a pipe or two by then.  I am a cw man, although I don't get on
now.
 
My first tobacco was good old Half &amp; Half.  I did not like it.
Smelled wonderful when others smoked it.  I went through various
brands always looking for something missing.  Flying Dutchman was
about the best I had tried back then.
 
Later, much later, I got into other tabacco.  A shop not too far away
in Allentown had various blends.  I guess my favorite type is Black
Cavendish.  Smokes cool, smellls great, and has no bite at all.
 
Many a bowl was smoked, poring over the bands with my Heathkit SB102,
looking for DX.  With a simple setup, bare rig, simple wire antenna,
not even a dipole, I got DXCC, WAS on 75 meters, I was into traffic
work, was a TCC 3rn rep, and ran a training net for awhile.  Field
day, and other contests were exciting for me.  My interest in cw
carried over into the service, I was in the US Army Security Agency,
as a morse intercept operator, from 1965 to 1968.  Served in Vietnam
and Japan.  Vietnam has no tobacco anyone would want to smoke as far
as I could see.  People used to give the houseboys, and other
labrorers, American ciggys, to keep them from smoking the water
buffalo dung they normally smoked.  It was bad.
 
I don't have any big name pipes, only two handmade ones, from the
fellow in Allentown.  Don't remember his name, his shop was in the
Whitehall Mall.
 
Herm

[ TNX FER QSL, Herm! WAS and DXCC on 75 with an end-fed wire? I'm
impressed!  Never got all the way to WAS myself, much less DXCC,
though my primary hamming was in the early seventies after things had
gotten a bit noisier. Ran a 40-meter dipole and later a Hustler 4-BTV
vertical. The rig was a Heathkit HW-101, barefoot. K3JSZ DE KF2IO K ]

Subject: Pipe Tobaks tried

        Well in my never ending search for the most excellent pipe tobacco
(Ok, I just started...) I've tried the following and would like list
members to comment on their experiences and possibly make suggestions on
further venues to explore.

        The first package I picked up was Captain Black Royal, which comes
in a blue pouch and claims on the front, "America's #1 pipe tobacco." which
I beg to differ with. It is described on the front of the package as,
"aromatic black and golden cavendish, exceptionally mild, delightfully
aromatic." I will agree with the delightfully aromatic part - although it
had a horrible taste. I wouldn't mind burning it as inscense, but smoking
it is a chore. I believe that there was another "kind" of Captain Black at
the store which I claimed this one, I am not sure if I want to venture to
try that one right off.

        The second was much more pleasant. I am sorry that I don't have the
package with me, but I believe the name of the tobacco was, "Danish" it
came in a red pouch and was VERY smooth and relaxing. I found myself
wanting to pack a few more bowls of this fine brew after I'd finished.
Again I wish I had the package with me so I could give more details - I
hope to find this kind again, I had purchased it in California and am
afraid that my trip to the shop today will not unearth the golden leaves up
here... We shall see.

Has anyone else tried these types? Based on what I thought of the Captain
Black which types of tobacco should I avoid?

Much thanks,

Micah

[ I have to concur on the Captain Black. Danish? Maybe the "Danish" is
Skandinavik? -S. ]

Subject: holiday smokes

For X-mas my wife got me a sampler box of Don Diegos, Uppmann, Henry Clays and 
Cabanas which sounds like what Martin Miller was trying also. All of them were
5.5" and approx. 45 ring. I agreed with him about the Henry Clay but I hated 
the Uppmann. It had a terribly tight draw and the wrapper was coming unraveled.
I am pleased to hear he had alot better experience and I'm going to try the
second one with an open mind. 
  I also tried a couple Arturo Fuente, double chauteau Fuente and they were
excellent. A full 50 ring with a great flavor and nice draw. Along with the 
sampler box, my wife also got me a Dow vintage port, 91. She was slightly put 
out that I couldn't drink it until at least the turn of the century but I'm 
looking forward to it. I think I'll crack it open when the first grand-child 
arrives.
  Hope everybody has a safe and enjoyable New Year.

				JR  

p.s. - Right now I'm buying my cigars in pairs and smoking them ASAP. I'm
       thinking of buying a humidor. Anything comments, things I should look 
       for/stay away from? thanks

[ An Uppmann? It wouldn't _dare_! But it sounds like you had a nice
Christmas anyway! Please tell your good lady wife that she is most
considerate. -S. ]

Subject: Hello

Well, it's about two weeks late in coming, but I thought I'd introduce
myself to the group.  I'm a 23 year-old student at the University of
Texas at Austin.  From what I understand, my age and economic status
(i.e. young and poor) establishes me as not your typical cigar fan...but
that matters little.  I purchased my first pipe about 5 yrs. ago, and
have been smoking only occasionally ever since.  About 6 months back,
while in the tobacco shop for more "bourbon-vanilla", I ventured into
the humidor...my love affair with cigars began, and I have virtually
abondoned my pipe (a decent little Peterson)--sorry pipe fans :)

I have since rigged my own humidor (remember, I'm on a budget), and favor
Churchill-sized smokes.  Partagas No. 10 and Fonseca 10-10's are a staple
for me.  Both are very attractive, smooth, yet rich and flavorful.  I
occasionally have trouble with hard-draw and uneven burning in the 
Fonsecas though.  When money's tight or I want a little more "punch", I'm
also fond of several makes of Hoyo de Monterrey.

In addition to economic limitations, I must also adhere to a strict routine
of showers and mouth rinsing after smokes, which only take place outside
on an often windswept balcony.  I do these things to maintain peace in the
household--my wife has not yet come to admire the pleasure of a fine cigar
as I do.  I know, I know, I can hear the sad violins even now.

I saw some mention of Cubans in Mexico, or their scarcity.  While honeymooning
in Cabo San Lucas this summer, I smoked my only Cuban to date.  After
dragging my new bride around the dusty streets for a couple of hours searching,
we returned to the hotel where I found one in the gift shop.  It was
a small Romeo and Julieta (pettite?), and extremely dry--I steamed it while
in the shower (yes, I was desperate), but, needless to say, the expirience
was nothing special, although it did impove a little about halfway through.
As we waited in the small, hot airport for the return flight, I had my eye
on a box of R&amp;J Corona's in the duty-free shop--sadly, the owner must have
been on Mexican time as the shop never opened.  Of course, we breezed
through customs at home...what could have been :)

Okay, I've rambled enough...happy smoking all.

[ Sigh. Better luck next time, Michael, and bon chance on converting
your betrothed to the Brother-and-Sisterhood of the Leaf. -S. ]

Hi!	Merry Christmass &amp; Joyeux Noel a tous!!

I've had the pleasure of having my first cigar on monday, the beginning of
an enjoyable hobby, I'm sure! Now.. I tried a $ 6.00 Cuban Troyo cigar, which
was very disappointing.. It left a pot aftertaste in my mouth, it simply
awfull. I tried as well a cigarillo (??), a small cigarette like cigar, from
davidoff. Now that was a pleasure and a half! It tasted fine and smelt smooth
and refined. At $2.25 (and considerably smaller than the vile Troyo) I imagine
a full size Davidoff would run me a few bucks more.. An investment well worth
indulging in...

I purchased my tobacco at a Montreal area store named H.Poupart, I'm not sure
if they have locations in the other two Canadian cities , it was a real treat
to see such a large quantite of cigars, pipe's and tobacco. I am beginning
to realize the potential expense of fine Cubans, has anyone experimented with
Manila products?? (Can't help thinking of marcos (and shoes))

If I can assist anyone with

opps.. Darn editor...

Greetings!  I'm glad to find this publication--it's great to hear from fellow
pipe smokers.  I am currently a seminary student at Gordon-Conwell Seminary
studying for the pastorate (Pipe smokers do come in all varities!), and am
really a novice at pipe smoking.  I would really like some help with one
issue:  How do I keep my pipe lit?  Am I supposed to keep lighting it every
two seconds, or is there a way to just puf and relax without having to
re-light?  I find that I have to smoke really hurridly in order to keep it
lit, which takes away from the enjoyment.  Any suggestions?

[ I've passed along the How-To guide, Patrick. Please let me know if
you haven't yet received it. And, yes, there have been some pipe
smokers with religious connections... witness Bing Crosby :-) Welcome!

I recently acquired America Online and remember your listing from one of the
pipe publications.

I have been smoking, collecting, for 10 years and have a collection of
Dunhills and Charatans.  Enjoy trading, although I've found this difficult to
find other willing to do so.

If you can help, please respond.

[ Hope you can find some others here who are interested in trading,

Subject: X-mas Blessing

  I hope that my youthful excitement can be forgiven, but a freind of mine
and I received a wonderful gift from Bermuda over the Holidays-some Cuban
Upmann's to ring in the New Year.  The novelty of Cubans (my first) may have
added to my pleasure, but these were GREAT!  Certainly the finest I've ever
had.  If these were any indication of the quality produced there, the embargo
cannot end soon enough (IMHO).

Also, if I may add my two cents to the "Cuban debate".  I attempted to bring
a box of Cubans back from Gibraltar a few years ago and got snagged in
Customs.  While pleading my case, the officer said that the only ways to
bring Cubans into the U.S. was, not if they were for personal use, but if you
were a diplomat or if you were bringing them in "for a Cuban citizen" (nudge,
nudge, wink, wink).

Lastly, has anyone ever tried this??  Knowing tobacco's penchant for
absorbing outside odors, I began to put rum on the humidity element in my
humidor every now and again instead a moistening with water.  The cigars do
pick up the aroma and it doesn't seem to affect flavor (that I can notice
anyway).  I quite like it.  I use Goslings "Black Seal" rum, which has a real
gingery scent and taste.  Has anyone else ever tried to do smething like
this?

Hi, Steve!

I've left my position at OSSI to pursue a full time photography career.
It won't likely pay as well in the beginning, but my soul will be the
better for it, and my studio partner smokes, so the occasional pipe 
will be enjoyed between shoots!

I have established the netcom account from which you are receiving this 
mail, so if you would change my address in your mailing list, I can 
continue to get and enjoy the newsletter.

I hope the ney year is a good one for you.

Cheers,

p.s.  It is certainly a great joy to be smoking some 15 year old Balkan 
Sobranie in a turn of the century GBD Liverpool as I write this.  That
could *never* happen at a company in Berkeley!

[ Address changed. I'm sure many of us will envy you from our

Hello Steve,
Well, Thanks for all of the good stuff.  I have been really overwhelmed.
 Hope you enjoyed the
Christmas issue of the A&amp;M Gazette.  I suppose I will have to start
thinking about the February 1994 issue soon.  Actually I have a new 256
grey scale scnnner which will result in a dramatic increase in the
number of photos in future issues.  I am also converting over from
express publisher to MS Publisher which is much better.  What did you
think of the latest Dirigible Pirates episode?  I note that in your
listing the A&amp;M Gazette is described as "different"  which probably
compares to the Hitchikers Guide to the Universe's description of Earth
as "Mostly Harmless."  BTW I have been reading a whole lot of William
Gibson (Differenc Engine, Mona Lisa Overdrive, and also Neal Steaphanson
- SnowCrash)  Which probably all indicates that I am off in some
cyberpunk phase -- hopefully not to some negative impactto the beloved
Pirates.
    Take care, Hope your new year is off to a good start with your new
Peterson.

Subject: composition of cigar tabacco

Hello all of you,

In a message of in Pipes Digest 124, someone asked about the
composition of the tabacco in cigars. In most Cuban cigars and
some Mexican cigars this is only from one country (puros), but most
other cigars have tabacco from more than one country. The Dutch
cigars (and almost all European cigars) are perhaps different
(if not, please let me know).
These cigars are short fillers (so the tabacco is cut in
small peaces [2 - 12 mm long and no stems or vein]), and the 
tabacco comes from up to 15 regions (normally from some 5
regions/countries). The countries of tabacco used in Dutch cigars are:
Indonesia (Java, Sumatra), Brazil, Cuba, South Africa, Italy,
Columbia, Greece and US. 
In some of the cheaper cigars one uses the hominized tabacco
paper (this is paper made of cranulated tabacco, called HTL). 
But remember this is only in cheap cigars (and I think in a lot
of export-cigars;-)!!!

You can imagine that by using this much of different tabaccos
it is easy to blend the cigars in such a way that they are
smooth and mild. I think that is the stength of the Dutch
(European) cigar, the blending.

The humidity for smoking a Dutch cigars is in my opinion the
same as for Havana cigars (60 - 70%). The lower recommended humity
by manufacturers in Holland (50 - 60%), is in my opinion to
low, so that the cigars becomes more harsh.

I wonder if it is easy to get good cigars in other parts of the
world. Good Dutch cigars in Holland are: Huifkar, Balmoral,
Schimmelpenninck, De Olifant, Justus van Maurik, De Heeren van
Ruysdael, Oud Kampen, Hajenius, van der Donk (handmade)
(perhaps I have forgotten some;-).

If people are once travellig to Holland, and have some time,
perhaps I can enjoy with them some good Dutch cigars (if you of course
bring some good once from your own country).

All the best,

Victor

[ If ever in Holland, we'll make a point of stopping in with some
Amurrican cigars. Some nice White Owls, Phillies, or Hav-A-Tampas...
OUCH! Seriously, though, thanks for the note. I've tried
Schimmelpenninck and can confirm that they make a good small cigar.

Subject: Cuban Connection

On a Christmas trip to Edmonton, Alberta, I bought two
things that Canadians enjoy which we Californians do not:
good ice skates at a reasonable price and Cuban cigars.

It was a hurried trip, but after visiting four tobacconists
(damn there are a lot of them in Edmonton!) I found some
Monticristo coronas. They needed a few days to rehydrate,
but the first one I've tried was very nice. It drew well,
had a full, smooth flavor, and was a nice smoke.

However, at least for this batch of Montecristos, I'd have
to say they are a novelty smoke. Soon afterwards I had an
Arturo Fuentes that knocked my socks off. At least
I can now say I've tried those Commernist Seegars.

P.S.: The skates are nice ;-)

Subject: Re:  Pipes Digest #125 - January 10, 1994
	
	The first package I picked up was Captain Black Royal ...

I don't want to sound like a snob.  I really don't.  But think about it
this way:  would you expect much of a cigar that is sold in 7-11?  A
wine? Would you buy a match rifle at K-Mart?

Captain Black is the Taylor California Cellars of pipe tobacco.  Smells
pretty, and so loaded with artificial preservatives that it will be 
around with the Twinkies long after we're all gone.

When the pockets are empty, or when you're stuck away from a tobacconist,
you might find yourself buying grocery store brands.  But they're just
not the same as the real thing.  They're also frequently very bad at
depositing thick layers of tar in your pipe -- fine if your pipe is
also from the 7-11, with a filtre to keep it from  drawing right up 
into your mouth, but a cruel thing to do to a good pipe.

Maybe it's a bit of missionary spirit, but I think you might really 
enjoy picking up a bit of English -- Balkan Sobranie, Dunhill Standard
Mild, or a good clone -- and give it a try.  It can be harsh if you
smoke it too quickly, but it can be really worthwhile.
	
	...  About 6 months back,
	while in the tobacco shop for more "bourbon-vanilla", I ventured into
	the humidor...my love affair with cigars began, and I have virtually
	abondoned my pipe (a decent little Peterson)--sorry pipe fans :)
	
Once again, my flesh creeps a bit.  Bourbon-vanilla tobacco is like
General Foods Cafe Irish Creme -- an interesting confection, but not the
real thing.  There are a lot of very good natural tobaccos out there,
so don't give up on your pipe.

And natural pipe tobacco might not smell as sweet and pretty as the 
flavoured stuff, but it is easier for a non-smoker to take than 
cigar leaf.	
	
	[ Manilas? Now there's a thought... any other experiences? -S. ]
	
A lot of good cigars have just too much nicotine for my system, and
for my pipe-smoker puffing habits.  I have found that there are a lot
of good Filipino cigars which are very delicate in flavour and in
smell, and without the same nicotine shock of, say a Cuban.
	
Reminiscent in some ways of a Villiger, without the square-cut 
regimentation.

Cheers,

Aryk Nusbacher

Subject:      Pipes Digest


I must respond to Edward Clark III's suggestion to moisten a humidor
with rum.  An excellent idea!  I frequently moisten myself with
Gosling's Black Label, and the effects are quite encouraging -
combined with a decent stogie and something old and mellow on the CD
player.

On another subject, please reveal more on the "Agricultural &amp;
Mechanical Gazette". Is this an on-line publication, or a veritable,
published publi- cation?  I ask, because as a specialist in the
history of lighter than air flight at the National Air and Space
Museum, I'm strangely moved by the sound of the Dirigible Pirates - I
yearn to hear more!

From: Steve Masticola (????????@??.???????.???)
Subject: Agriculture, Mechanics, and the Dirigible Pirates

Well, the story goes like this. Norm Carpenter was in NYC on business
for a couple of days, so I met him for dinner and a pipe at La Bonne
Soupe. (It wasn't the night the NY Pipe Club meets, so we had to do
the smoking outside of the restaurant, along with a little
exploration.) For some reason or another, I mentioned a slightly
strange-of-center bimonthly pipe lore magazine called "The
Agricultural and Mechanical Gazette", in which the Internet Pipes
Mailgroup has been listed for the last two issues. It's edited by Neil
Murray, and well worth the price of $15/year for club and convention
news, as well as the, er, "different" Dirigible Pirates stories.

Norm asked me, quite reasonably, why a pipe journal would have a name
like "The Agricultural and Mechanical Gazette." Rather than
paraphrase, I'll repeat the whole story, from Vol. 2 Issue 4, December
1990, p. 2.

"Many of our readers have written in asking questions. Questions such
as, "Where is the 'Great North Woods?', 'Who are these Dirigible
Pirates?', and 'What does it all really mean?'

"Various explanations have been offered from time to time, both by the
informed and also by the uninformed. At long last, this is an attempt
to set the record straight. Consider it a sort of Christmas present,
from us, to you.

"The story of the Dirigible Pirates, which has been accepted by most
people as a work of fiction, is in fact an historical account of
future events. That is to say, when the future becomes the past, and
the present becomes irrelevant, the story of our Pirates will become
an accepted part of our cultural and historical baggage. Suffice it to
say that when the Clean Air Police grab our society by the throat,
wrenching our pipes from between our clenched teeth, a few brave men
and women will take refuge in a place which will become known as, 'The
Great North Woods.' Anticipating their (the Pirates') need for a camp
newsletter, _The Agricultural and Mechanical Literary Gazette_ was
founded -- well in advance of their actual need! (The word 'Literary'
was eventually dropped from the title for reasons which are no longer
of interest - and we can't remember anyway.) As the title implies, the
objective of the _Gazette_ is to inform and entertain the readers
since anything of interest to a Dirigible Pirate - being folks of
simple needs - can be categorized as either agricultural or
mechanical. We initially envisioned that the _Gazette_ would be packed
with informative articles about pipes, tobaccos, the social news of
our cohort, the historical chronicle of the pirates, the husbandry of
small cereal grains and their conversion through fermentation into a
more transportable form, horticulture, the repairs of old pipe
friends, practical machine tools and material sciences. Much of this
has been accomplished and much remains ahead of us.

"And, finally, what does it all mean? We don't know. If we did, maybe
we would be writing for the _Harvard Business Review_ instead."

Subject: Please add me

Hi there.

You might remember me from my earlier addres at the "andrew.cmu.edu"
site.  I've now moved to working full time here in Pittsburgh, so
please add me to the list at this new address. Thanks.

I mostly smoke cigarettes (Nat Sherman's "Virginia Circles", "Three
Caftles" handrolling), but when I get a chance I like to pack my briar
and sit around lounging.

While I was home for the holidays, I had occasion to be in New York
city for about a half an hour as I walked from Penn Station to Grand
Central. As I walked, I window shopped absent mindedly. Eventually, I
passeda rather nice looked shop with pipes in the window. I looked up
to the marquee and realized that I was *there*. It was the Nat
Sherman's *store* on Fifth Avenue in New York.

Walking in was an experience to remember. I assume that this store is
approximately 60 years old, and it's still run like a 1930's
gentleman's shop. Lot's of wood cabinets and glass. In addition to the
full line of cigarettes, there was a wonderful selection of pipe
tobacco and a large selection of acoutrements like walking sticks,
cigar and cigarette cases, and flasks. Also, all of the three salesmen
was dressed in suits! The place really radiates the kind of class
that tobacco *used* to have in this country before the advent of
Marlboro and Camel indutrial commercialism. The humidor (which I
unfortunately did not have time to browse) was *upstairs* on the
second floor.

Since I already had a box of cigarettes in my pocket, I just bought a
bag of Golden Virginian pipe tobacco so that I could get *something*
in this wonderful store. I'm not sure why I was so impressed, but
since I didn't expect to see anything of value during that short time
in the city, I guess it's just a pleasant suprise that I'll remember
for a while.

those dumb listservers.
Am I a 28 year electronics engineer orginaly born in New Zealand but
now I live in the frozen wastes of Montreal (actually a very nice city
in the summer time.) .
My Interests are in fine Cigars and after my recent vist to The UK
in pipes ( what a wonderful range of tobaks's they have in the UK..)
while I was there I picked a pipe smokers guide has a run down on tobaks and
pipes if any body is interested i can give them the mail address in the UK.
I buy my tobbac at Davidoff here in Montreal ( found them cheaper than
H.poupart who only has One store  and thats in Montreal.) as for Adrian Gold's
comments concerning getting Cubans into the US I have a couple of friends
that I supply on a regular basis ( but using Post or Fedex accross the
border will not work.. if any body is interested private email me...

I recently discovered a little company in Toronto that Imports Cuban tobak

A little bit more for a future digest.  My name is Barry Schenker and
I live in Buffalo, yes the home of the Bills.  I've already read the
back issues you sent and I would like to compliment you and everyone
on the job they do.

I saw you listed in Tom Dunn's 1992 listing of pipe collectors.

About tobacco - there have been alot of questions about various
tobaccos.  For all your subsribers, I stongly recommend getting a
listing of Barry Levin's Personal Reserve tobaccos and trying some.
Although some may consider them expensive, they're well worth it.
Also, Brebbia (yes the pipe manufacturer), just introduced a line of
tobaccos as well as Butera, another pipemaker. They are all an
excellent line of Virginia or English type tobaccos.  Levin also
carries a line of aromatics.

I smoked English for years, but got tired of all the complaints, so
smoke them at home.  Virginias are my choice when I'm in the office or
out.  i have found several which are close enough to English that they
serve well in crowds.

Reading about all the cigars makes me want to go over to Canada and
pick up some Cuban cigars although last time I tried some, they seem
to have lost quite a bit in quality.

Kepp up the good work.

Barry 

[ Will do, Barry! Glad to hear that the word is getting out through
TPSE. -S. ]

  Cubans in Windsor, Ontario?
With all of the cigar discussion lately (and I thought this was a Pipes
list :-}  ), I was wondering if any of you around Detroit or Windsor can
recommend a good shop in Windsor that carries a selection of Cuban cigars
that won't cost me an arm and leg and...?  I get to Detroit on business
quite a bit, and Windsor is just across the tunnel.

Subject: herbal tobacco

Besides my other hobbies, I am working on my herb garden.  One of the
references mentioned a smoking mixture based on coltsfoot instead of
tobacco.  Does anyone know anything more about it?  I have a few
herbal recipes to add to a smoking blend if anyone is interested.

Subject: A.T. 8-7-8

Steve
   In #124, J. Mark Jones mentioned that he smoked an Arturo Fuente 8-7-8 and
loved it. He was looking for some other opinions on it and since I had my 
first 8-7-8 last night I though I'd toss in my two cents. I also liked it very
much and for $1.50 ea. it was a real bargain. It was quite firm with a nice 
even burn. It wasn't hot at all and I too smoked it down to the last. I prefer 
larger cigars but for a nice quick smoke, I highly recommend it.

Subject:      questions and comments

Hello All,
enjoyed a decent Arturo Fuente Numero One today at lunch. I think the
guy at the smoke shop called it a "longsdale". The wrapper was dark
brown maduro (my favorite). It was a decent smoke. Not as good as the
8-5-8 (wonderful!). I noticed that the ash didn't burn nearly as
white as the 8-5-8. Is a good white ash the sign of a good wrapper,
possibly? It was a bit harsh until a little better than halfway, and
it smoothed out. I believe I will stay with the 8-5-8 (they were out
of them :-( ). Smoke shop guy has more 8-5-8's on the way, and also
some Fuente Hemingways. Now here's one I can't wait to try. Martin
Miller likes 'em and that's good enough for me! The smoke shop guy
highly recommends them. The guy tells me he is selling a ton of
good cigars, and the guy tells me he will soon install a walk-in-
humidor. Its funny, I don't *see* that many people smoking cigars...
but their seems to be almost Renaissance of cigars and pipes
happening.

Read an article the other day about life on the road with one of my
favorite singer song-writers-Billy Joel. Said he carries boxes of
Palmas cigars on the road. I didn't figure the Piano Man for a stogie
smoker. Anyone ever heard of/tried these?

Rush Limbaugh stated on his show a couple of days ago that he thinks
the Hoyo De Monterrey Double Corona (Cuban) is the finest cigar on
the face of the earth. Anyone know about this cigar? I'd love to try
it.

Question: Give me some hints on cutting the cigar. Smoke shop dude
sold me a $2 gizmo that looks like a little guillotine. Doesn't do a
very clean cut. Are you supposed to go for a small, neat drawing hole
while maintining the rounded end of the cigar? He said "I just cut
the end off...." But I like that rounded end, it seems the cigar
could get messy if you tear up the end very much. Also Steve, I hear
that there is a FAQ and a How-to-Guide. Would you be so kind as to
send them to me?

Thanks! May Good Cigars and Pipes come your way!

I've wondered about that myself.... 

Re the cutter, I'm told that a V-shaped cut is the best. I've seen
cigar cutters that run in excess of $400. But a sharp penknife works
fine. -S. ]

Subject: Misc

RE: poor student not a typical cigar fan

I first started smoking cigars while in college, when a friend of mine
who worked in a tobacco shop introduced me to a few free samples.  I've
been enjoying fine cigars ever since.  Most of my friends in college
also enjoyed the occasional cigar, so I do not believe you are a rarity.

RE: composition of cigars

This same friend dissected several cigars for me, some good and some not 
so good, to show me how they are constructed and how to identify the better 
cigars.  It was my understanding that most good Caribbean cigars are composed 
of tobacco from a single plantation, not blends (as are many or most of the 
European's).  The finest ones will have no stems or seeds, and an all-natural 
tobacco wrapper.

Bad cigars, from the US, will have an abundance of stems of seeds; I 
think sometimes that they just uproot the whole plant, run through a
grinder/mulcher, and call it tobaccey.  They are wrapped in paper, which
burns hot, unevenly, and tastes lousy.  Typically, but not universally,
'hand made' or 'hecho a mano' is synonymous with an all-tobacco wrapper.
If there are non-tobacco elements, it is usually a machine made cigar.

An anomaly is Backwoods smokes (please don't shoot me for mentioning
them!), which are indeed all tobacco, including the wrapper, but have
an abundance of stems and seeds and are machine made.  They are the
best cigar you will find in grocery/dime stores, but that isn't saying
much.

RE: Lingering odors, domestic tranquility

I was grandfathered.  I smoked cigars before I met my SO, and there was
never any mention of stopping.  She does not mind the aroma of a good
cigar.  This is a serious consideration when choosing to take on smoking,
or an SO, as I know some people for which this has been a very divisive issue.

RE: Humidors

Whilst poor students in college, I know of some folks who used old
non-defrosting refrigerators as makeshift humidors.  If the seal is intact,
the ability to 'chill' is irrelevant.  Such items can frequently be had
at bargain prices, if you're on a budget.  Else, a good small-to-medium
hardwood humidor should be had for around $50.  You can pay much more,
for much larger, if you like.  Be careful that whatever humidifying
element you insert, that there is no loose moisture on it.  If it's a
strip, after wetting the element, pat the outsides dry.  If it's one of
those little cylindrical gizmos (?), make sure it's not dripping, and
the exterior is dry.  I made this mistake early on, and it resulted in 
a slight warpage of the top of my humidor, revealing about a 1/16" space.
It isn't totally ruined, but it definitely degrades the ability to keep
the contents moist.

RE: High prices for Cuban's in Canada

I suspect much of this is due to the exhorbitant tobacco taxes in Canada.
We'll catch up to your prices, probably soon. :-(

Subject: Pipe Pictures

Since you have a large subscriber network, you might want to find out if
anyone would like to send pictures of pipes across the network.

I have many that I've scanned.  I have a Mac and would like to try sending
someone a picture(s) if anyone's interested.

Just have them send an E-Mail and let me know what format it should be sent
in.  I will reduce the pictures so the files are small, so they'll need a way
to enlarge them.  I think I can translate them into IBM format(s) if one of
those "other types" are interested.

Barry

[ Maybe if you sent a list of the pics you have? Could be the start of
a whole nother enterprise! -S. ]

&gt; the Hoyo De Monterrey Double Corona (Cuban) is the finest cigar on

I kind of think he said that because Cigar Aficianado said it. Two weeks
ago I was amazed that a tobacconist I visited had one for sale. He got
it from a company that I _know_ had sold out of them before CA's review.
These would therefore be from a new shippment from Cuba. It was an
excelent cigar - rich, sort of a more stylish version of an Arturo
Fuente Hemmingway (which I just had last night, BTW... _really_ good.)
but not the best cigar I've ever had; That would be the Romeo &amp; Julieta
Churchill. I wonder if my taste just dosen't match CA's, or if some
producers compromise quality for quantity once a good review comes out.
Remember, these producers are all owned by the Cuban government; they
don't have quite the incentive to maintain a reputation the way a
Chateau Petrus does. If other readers have tried this cigar I'd be
interested in their opinions.

Subject: Re: Introduce myself, etc.

Hey Steve!

I just caught #124-#126 all in one shot (they all came to my mailbox while I
was on vacation), and I think it's about time I introduce myself.  My name is
Bruce Morris, I'm a student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York,
and I am a four-year veteran cigarette/cigar smoker who has just recently
ventured into the world of pipe smoking.  (In fact, I must confess, I just did
my first bowl about an hour ago!)

While I'm sure as hell not a veteran, I want to agree with Micah in Pipes
Digest #125, who complained about the taste of Captain Black Royal.  Micah,
let me tell you: Captain Black Gold is no prize either!  My tongue felt numb
after about ninety seconds with that blend (and I am a regular Camel smoker
who enjoys occasional Dunhills and even more occasional Phillies!), and I
couldn't taste the cup of coffee I drank after that!  Someone, please suggest
a better brand!  (And tell me if this problem might have something to do with
the fact that this pipe is far from broken in! (They do mellow, right?)

Also, I think my first choice of pipe might not have been the greatest.  I'm
currently using a Dr. Grabow Omega, a filtered pipe which I'm afraid to clench
in my teeth because the stem has an annoying habit of separating from the bowl
(which is how you change the filter, of course).  Will that get better over
time?  And how often do you change the filters?

Thanks in advance, all!

Bruce

&gt; with rum.  An excellent idea!  I frequently moisten myself with
&gt; Gosling's Black Label, and the effects are quite encouraging -

Subject: Esoterica Tobacciana

Well, it's starting to look like Esoterica Tobacciana has gone
out of business.  None of my local pipe shops in Columbus, Ohio
has any of their tobacco left in stock, and the guy who imports
the stuff isn't returning calls.  I've managed to put aside a
small stock of these, but I'd like to get more before these
blends disappear from everywhere in the country.

The Esoterica Tobacciana blends are pricey (but worth it)
English blends in tins (and half-pound packages) with a white
label.  Has anyone seen these blends in your local smoke shop?
If you've seen them, I'd greatly appreciate if you'd give me the
name of the shop, and (if possible) their phone number.

Many people on the list have probably experienced this before: a
favorite blend goes the way of the mastodon, and you've only got
a tin or two to last you the rest of your life.  I'd like to grab
as many of these as I can before it's too late.  Please reply by
e-mail if you can help.

Subject: Pipes Digest

Steve - 

Just got your intro and first issue of the diges, really enjoyed it!

I'm 28 and run an insurance office in St. Petersburg, FL.  I've been enjoying
cigars for about three years.  Until Cigar Aficionado, and now Pipes Digest,
I thought the only people smoking cigars were old Cuban gentlemen in Ybor
City (Tampa), new fathers, and myself.  Maybe it is a vestige of herd
mentality, but it's great to know you are not alone.

J. Mark Jones asked about cutters.  Edward's Pipe &amp; Tobacco in Tampa, (813)
872-0723, offer a cutter they have made locally.  It's called an El Toro and
is a combination of a bullet cutter and a sharpened, spring loaded, drill bit
which acts as a piercer.  I know it sounds strange, but it works great. 
Gives a nice clean hole, with a good draw and it is easy to clean.  The whole
thing is in a two piece wood tube that is about three inches, so it is easy
to carry in your pocket.  Sells for about twenty bucks.  (No, I don't own
stock)  I used a V cut for a while, but I tend to chew on the end of the
cigar and would loose my draw with the V.

Cigar Aficionado has given great ratings to La Gloria Cubana,  made in Miami.
 I wasn't able to find any in tobacco stores and all the mail order houses
were "out of stock."  Finally, a friend was able to pick some up at the
factory, while in Miami on business.  Boy was it worth the wait!!

Upon arrival they were very "green" , but after a month or so in the humidor
they were fantastic.  Snow white ash, even burn, and spicy flavor that makes
you want to smoke two at a sitting.  I've tried the Coronas, Churchills,
Robustos, Double Coronas, and Torpedos and they have all been excellent. 
Question is, has anyone else tried them?  I'm wondering if they are really as
good as I think or if it is simply the trouble I went throught to get them
that is playing tricks on my head.

Also, does anyone smoke Cuba Aliados?  If so, how about a review.

Thanks for the digest, hope to hear from you soon.

Subject:      Smoke, if you got 'em

Hello All,
Just a couple of short shots....

Both of these came from Rush Limbaugh (I confess I am a ditto-head).
Rush is quite knowledgable about cigars and discusses them, and Cigar
Aficiado quite frequently on his show.

President John F. Kennedy was a cigar man. On the eve of the Cuban
embargo, he sent his top aide out to buy up as many Cuban cigars as
he could find. Rush says he brought some 1200 to the Pres.

Winston Churchill usually smoked about 10 cigars a *day*! Of course,
the churchill size (which I suppose is a bit subjective) comes from
those big suckers he smoked. I can't imagine smoking 10 a day. 'Course
its hard to believe I used to do two packs of Marlboro or Winston
regulars, and more if I stayed up late. Give me a good cigar once or
twice a week, and I will be a happy camper!

BTW-Pipes List is fantastic....I've come to really look forward to it
each week. Thank you very much Steve, you are a gentleman and a
scholar!

Subject:      The Ultimate Cigar Book, "The Smoker" in Albany NY, 8-5-8

Hi,
     As I have just come in to work after a visit to "The Smoker" in
Albany, NY and then found the latest digest waiting for me, I thought
it would be a great time to relate some of my recent experiences and
thoughts on matters relating to lady nicotine.

"THE SMOKER"
I have been a customer of Mel Feldman, "The Smoker" proprietor, since
1980, when I started college in Albany.  He moved to his current
location at 136 Washington Avenue (a block and a half from the Capitol)
soon afterwards, and I continued frequenting his store since then.

He is not only a master blender of pipe tobacco and an all-around expert
on all pipe-related things, but also a very good conversationalist with
many interests, (every time I go there, I stay two-three hours) and stocks
an excellent collection of new and estate pipes at very fair prices, in
all ranges.  His walk-in humidor is not very big, and neither is his
cigar selection, (even though he has a few sizes each of the "major" brands)
but that is more than made up for by his thousands of excellent pipes.

I usually buy an estate pipe from him around new year's (this year I
was late) and on my birthday.  Today I bought an excellent "Ben Wade"
Danish freehand from the "Autumn" series.  Nice amber stem.  Can't wait to
go home to fire it up.
This is the fourth or fifth "Ben Wade" Danish freehand I bought in a row
from him.  They have all been excellent.  Almost as good as my Dunhill
"Shell" in smoking quality, and vastly more beautiful!

He is also always looking to buy used pipes, so if you wanna get rid of
anything...

"The Smoker's" hours are 8:00 AM-5:30 PM Mon.-Fri. and 9:00 AM-1:00 PM Sat.
Phone #: (518)462-1302

"THE ULTIMATE CIGAR BOOK"
A week ago I finished reading Richard Carleton Hacker's "The Ultimate
Cigar Book."   Although much shorter than his "Ultimate Pipe Book,"
(around 250 pages versus 400), it is very informative and very well
written.  It talks about the history of cigars, the process that takes
tobacco from seed to finished cigar, how to choose and how to smoke a
good cigar, accessories like lighters, humidors, cutters, cases, etc.
and which spirits are good with which cigars. His last chapter is a
list of all of the world's cigar brands/factories that he could get
information on.

He does not rate individual cigars, using only his own "HPH" (Highly
Prejudicial Hackerscale from 1 to 3) rating, for cigars' intensity of
flavor.
I think he is a little too "diplomatic," as if he doesn't want to offend
anyone (like "Stereo Review's" approach to reviewing equipment).
He even finds merit to many mass-produced, homogenized leaf cigars.
(Or at least that's the implication, since he does not slam those
foul- looking, tasting, and smelling cardboard contraptions.)
I would have much preferred a blind-tasting rating system a-la "Cigar
Aficionado," or even a personal preference scale like the one
Michael Jackson uses in his excellent "Guide to Single Malt Scotch!"
(Both scales go to 100.)  Oh, well..

So, even though the book didn't tell me anything I didn't know already
(or seen someplace else in the past), it was still appreciated for its
nice style, good pictures and the gathering of all that interesting
information in one place.  A "Must Have," for beginner and veteran alike.

CUBAN CIGARS
Coming originally from Europe, and visiting there frequently, I have had
the good fortune to experience Cuban cigars since the age of sixteen.
(I quit smoking cigarettes at age twelve, after a brief experiment;
I knew even at that age, (lack of) quality. :-} I still drink wine though,
which I liked a lot since I was six.)

In general, I am of the opinion (that I wasn't the first to express, I'm
sure) that even with the relatively recent (last ten years or so) consistency
problems of the Cuban cigars, THE BEST CUBAN CIGAR IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE
BEST NON-CUBAN CIGAR.  Of course, there is a great spectrum of different
qualities among Cuban handmades, and except for the top 10%, for every Cuban
handmade, you can find a better non-Cuban cigar for one fifth to one tenth
the price.  (For example, IMHO, you'd have to spend $8 to $15 on a Cuban cigar
to beat the quality of the Arturo Fuente 8-5-8, $1.20 mail-order, and my
current price/quality champion.)  So, if you are going to buy a Cuban cigar,
it's worth it to buy only the best.  A "Cohiba," or a big "Hoyo," "Romeo Y
Julieta," "Partagas," "Punch," or "Montecristo," even at $30 to $50 MAY
be worth it to some people, because you can't get an equal quality for
less.  But don't waste your money on the cheaper Cubans.  Buy 5 to 10
Dominican "Arturo Fuentes" or  Honduran "Hoyos" for the same money
instead!

"ARTURO FUENTES 8-5-8"
I've decided that I consider the "Arturo Fuente 8-5-8" my favorite
all-around cigar.  Oh, sure, a "Partagas #10" or "Excalibur #1" or
"JR Ultimate Double Corona" or "Arturo Fuente Hemingway" will give me much
more pleasure after a rich dinner or a specific Single Malt.  But on other
occasions those cigars can feel heavy and even a little harsh.
Not the "8-5-8!" It pleases me much more consistently (much less
variability in the pleasure I derive from it) than any other cigar. If the
above premium cigars let's say, ranged in pleasure from a 80 to a 97,
depending on the circumstances of the smoke, the "8-5-8" ranges only
from 87 to 92.
Make of that what you may!  That's my way of conceptualizing my
preferences in cigars.  Your milage may vary.

Smoke in peace,

Marios H. Agrotes

P.S.  Mel Feldman of "The Smoker" told me that some publisher in Buffalo
      is preparing a "cigar" magazine for publication, to compete with
      the "Cigar Aficionado!"  This new magazine, will reportedly be much
      more amenable to including articles about pipes than Shanken's "CA" is.

[ Wow! What a lot of great information! Thanks, Marios! -S. ]

Subject: Preventing Dry Pipe Tobacco

I thought I'd share this with the Pipes list
and see if anyone else out there has comments.

If the tobacco in my pouch starts to feel a little
dry, I sprinkle a few of drops of water directly onto
the tobacco, then mix it up. This seems to keep the
tobacco  properly moist and doesn't seem to damage it.

[ We do this too, sometimes, but find it difficult to control the
humidity of the tobacco. Saturating it kills it, too. Any advice on
this? -S. ]

Subject: Pipes Digest #126 - Janua

Hello Steve,
    Once again, thanks for promoting the Agricultural and Mechanical
Gazette.  If Allan Janus will email me his address, I will send him a
sample copy.  The number of subscribers has been steadily increasing
over the years, five years in publication now, and it has been a long
strange trip for our pirates.  Yes Allan, as an Air &amp; Space guy, you
might find the story interesting.  I must warn everyone that the story
has "some" satire and does tend toward the Richard Brautigan/Douglas
Adams/John Barth kind of strangeness.  The dirigible's computer by the
way uses magnetic core memory for ballast, which being ferrite works
quite well except when they dump ballast for altitude, which causes some
memory problems, but perhaps not unfamiliar to those who lived in PDP-11
land, or have tried tacking an OS/2 machine to a Novelle network.
    BTW we do cover a fair bit of the pipe news from the Hungarian pipe
clubs (and there is a lot of it) - we have a virtual monopoly in this
area.
   Captain Black, by the way is a Lane Limited tobacco and is the most
popular of commercial blends.  They, Lane also sell it in bulk as BCA
which most pipe shops carry under various names.
    take care,  Neil

Subject: Clippers and such

Perhaps I am stressing on the little things in life-grad students tend to do
that-but, I've always taken the clip of my cigar quite seriously.  One of my
leading critria for enjoyment is a cigar's draw.  If a cigar is not drawing
well it can almost be a chore to smoke, and a cigar's clip plays a big role
in draw.  My experiences with clipping began as Mark's did, with a small
$2.00 clipper that left a very ragged cut on one side of the cigar which
tended to flake apart as time went by and generally promoted unravelling of
the cigar.  I then moved up to a more expensive but, more effective clipper
that cut from but sides and left a very nice edge.  The beauty here is that,
unlike the $2.00 clipper, this one had a much larger opening, and could clip
even the largest ring gauges, and the clean edge didn't encourage
unravelling.  I, then, thought I'd seen everything when, on my first visit to
Leavitt and Peirce, they had a desk-top clipper at the register that gave a
very nice V-shaped cut.  The theory here is that it doesn't compromise the
wrapper and there is almost no chance for unravelling to occur.  It also
leaves "the rounded end" rounded.  At Leavitt's, they had hand clippers that
would make these V-shaped clips, but I didn't pusue this afterwards because I
really prefer the "customizing" you can get with the two-bladed hand clipper. 
There are a number of cigars, Avo's "Pyramide" and "Belicoso's", that put a
taper on the end to allow for different clips. But if you're careful you can
change the draw of almost any cigar to your preference.

Also, keep the snappy come-backs coming.  I had recent occasion to use one
while relaxing with close friends and a Machanudo "Portfino" at The Capital
Grille in Providence.  Not only did I have to withstand the hatpin jokes of
my friends ("Portos" are long and thin).  But the woman behind me just
wouldn't stop with the glancing comments.  So, since The Grille is listed in
Afficianado as "cigar friendly" I felt I had the green light to reply with
the "sight of someone enjoying themself" line. It was quite effective and I
certainly want to reference to proper sources.

     I'm a poor college student at the University of Oregon and have just
recently started smoking cigars. I really love to get together with a friend
and chat over a good cigar. Because I am so new to this, I thought that your
mailing list could help me out a lot. I'm glad that there is a mailing list
on this topic because it is hard for a beginner like myself to get good
information on cigars. I would really appreciate it if you could send me some
of the back issues or any good info on cigars. Thank you very much,

  Was in my local smoke shop last night and noticed they are now carrying 
a brand called Zina. They look like a Davidoff (even the band looked the same).
I thought I saw the name Davidoff on the box and they certainly had the same 
price range; up to 7.50 ea. Can you or someone tell me something about them.
In the winter issue of CA, there was an ad for them but not much was said. If 
they are worth the money, can anyone suggest which of the numerous one that 
I should try? I ended up getting an Arturo Fuente numero2. I've never seen 
this one before but so far I haven't had an AF that disappointed me.

		 Pipes Digest #128 - January 28, 1994
		     Circulation This Issue: 210

Yes, that's right, it's down from 214 last issue. The circulation does
drop sometimes, as Digests bounce with "User unknown" errors, and we
had no new members this week. And the weather on the East Coast
continues to be, ah, suboptimal, unless you're a road-salt salesman.
(Good for a quiet smoke and a good book, though.)

But take heart -- this time, we do have a significant amount of news
on the subject of -- yes, Norm -- pipes!

Subject: I can answer that!

If the tobacco in my pouch starts to feel a little
dry, I sprinkle a few of drops of water directly onto
the tobacco, then mix it up. This seems to keep the
tobacco  properly moist and doesn't seem to damage it.

Kam Kashani
????@???.???

[ We do this too, sometimes, but find it difficult to control the
humidity of the tobacco. Saturating it kills it, too. Any advice on
this? -S. ]

Wow:  A pipe smoking question.  (Feigned look of shock as our hero
wades through 2000 messages about cigars. :-)  )  

Anyway,  I've found the best way to deal with tobacco dry out in the
pouch is to buy a button himidfier.  This is similar to what you would
put in your humidor when storing the tobacco, but is small enough to
stay in your pouch.

Now,  back to cigars.  Not to offend any of you guys but -- well --
Sheesh!  What are you guys?  Maschochicts  uh? Massochists um? Machss-
Crazy?  I was lulled in to a false sense of security by all your wonderful
messages on the list and went out and bought myself a few stogies.  Sheesh!
I had one on the way home and kept wondering why the car was spinning whilst
I didn't even turn the wheel?!?!  Good lord,  I think I like my pipe better.
I do find cigars good --- for when I've run out of pipe tobacco and am 
stranded without money and no one is around to borrow off of and a major
flood has hit and we've just had another earthquake.  Yes,  that's a good
time to start a cigar.  I did notice that the cigar was a bit on the dry
side (leaf flakes coming off during the smoke).  How do I go about 
putting life back into the leaf?  Also,  I never cut the end off the cigar,
I just put a hole in the end to allow for a draw (Is this why they made 
me want to kiss the ground).)?  

Where's Thacker been through all this cigar talk anyhow?  I'm going to have
to order that crazy magazine just to get some decent tobacco stories to
pass around at the campfire.

Smoking safely with a stem....

Zino Davidoff died last week at 87 (I think). 
Services were private and the news was only made public after the funeral
by the family. He was evidently retired from the company for the past year
or so. I don't know if he was actually involved in the great "Cuban cigars
are no good any more" announcement or not.

I saw his obit and didn't think to save it.

    (Bruce Michael Morris) let me tell you: Captain Black Gold is no
    prize either! .... Someone, please suggest a better brand!

Balkan Sobranie.  Worth every penny.

	(And tell me if this problem might have something to do with
	the fact that this pipe is far from broken in! (They do
	mellow, right?) 

A tobacconist once suggested to me that I mix some honey and some 
cigarette ash, and coat the inside of a non-carbonised bowl; then 
bake the pipe (without the stem) in a hot oven until the stuff caramelizes.
So I've done that with a few pipes, and I can't complain.  Also, a
trick I learned from my dad is to alternate full and half bowls with
a new pipe.

	Also, I think my first choice of pipe might not have been the
	greatest. I'm currently using a Dr. Grabow Omega...

So there you are in Troy, NY.  First thing you do is go down to the Smoker
in downtown Albany and get a good, inexpensive pipe.  If you are willing
to pony up a few dollars, you can get a piece of good briar that might
have a few fills in it here and there; but will smoke decently well.
Ask the guy about tobacco, and sample a few.  Get some little packets to
take home and decide what you like.  Stick with the house blends -- 
an honest tobacconist sells his own blends (and custom blends) for less
than the mass-market equivalent.  And ask the guy there for advice.

And save the Dr. Grabow for a backup emergency pipe in case of earthquake.

Re moistening a humidor element with rum:  I seem to recall that alcohol
is a dessicant, and that while half (or so) of the rum is water and sugar;
the rest might be damaging your cigar.  Take the rum in the way God

Re the Rt Hon Winston L.S. Churchill's prodigous ability to smoke
cigars:  when I worked in a smoking-allowed office (way back when there
was such a thing) I could go through 20 pipes of tobacco in a day; and
there's a lot less of me than there was of Winnie.  Given sufficient
cash, sufficient availability of tobacco, and sufficient freedom; I could
probably go through an equivalent weight of pipe tobacco in a working 
day to Winnie's 20 cigars.

[ Pure alcohol is a dessicant, but rum is only 40-50% alcohol, and
most of the rest is water. So I don't think it would dry tobacco out.

Subject: coral flake

It is extremely frustrating to find a tobacco one really likes and then 
see it suddenly disappear.  In Washington D.C. a couple of years ago I 
picked up a couple small (one oz.) tins of something called Coral Flake 
at the D.C. JR Tobacco shop.  It was made by the firm of W.T. Davies and 
Sons of Great Britain.  I have never seen it since.  I really loved this 
stuff- it was almost black in color, but quite mild- sort of like a 
slightly spicier St. Bruno flake.  If anyone has spotted Coral Flake 
(mine was in a cute little circular tin, bright green with a red stripe) 
I would GREATLY appreciate hearing about it.

[ If you still have a sample, you might consider getting it
duplicated... BTW, has anyone seen any L. L. Bean's pipe tobacco in
recent years? I'd like to get some for the same purpose. -S. ]

Subject: Getting Cubans into the US

Has anybody bothered to call customs yet?  I've tried a couple of
times but justgot some stupid answering machine (I called the number
in Terminal Island, CA (310) 514-6030 for anybody that's interested).
I did think of a way to get themin, though.  Just take off the bands
(stash them somewhere if you want to keep them) and make sure you
bring an empty non-Cuban box with you to put them in.  Fool customs,
get your Cubans home.

Subject: Re: Preventing dry pibe tobacco

In Pipes Digest #127, Kam Kashani writes:

&gt; If the tobacco in my pouch starts to feel a little
&gt; dry, I sprinkle a few of drops of water directly onto
&gt; the tobacco, then mix it up. This seems to keep the
&gt; tobacco  properly moist and doesn't seem to damage it.

The same problem occred to me recently with a portion of
my "stock" of American tobacco bought in the states during
a visit last August. (In Tokyo, where I live now, only
standard series seems available, and at outrageous price.)
My solution is a variation of yours: after loading the
pibe with dry tobacco, add _one_ drop of water directly
into the pibe. While smoking, the humidity seems to 
spread in an appropriate way. This is of course an 
emergency act but not as terrible in practice as in theory.

Regards, 
Carl.

  Cigars, and pipes too....
Hi - 
   I haven't written for a while, but have been following the current
discussion on cigars - and I thought this was a "Pipes" list!    :-}  
   Actually, though, all of the cigar info has been great.  I've started
going to the cigar store with a list of recommended cigars - it's been
Very Interesting.  In particular, I like the Arturo Fuento 8-5-8, which
Marios Agrotes just gave a glowing report on.  I've got to ask a dumb
question though - where can I mail order these for $1.20?  Here in
Cincinnati (not the best market I'm afraid), they cost about $2.50 each!

   Since I'm actually a pipe smoker, I thought I'd ask a pipe question too
- I have a very nice pipe my wife gave me several years ago (can't
remember the name) with a Lexan stem.  The stem has grown loose over the
years.  When I raised this question some time ago, I was told how to
tighten a rubber or vulcanite (?) stem (heat slightly with a match, press
against something to swell it, then sand to fit).  Does this work with
Lexan?  I'm afraid to screw it up!

   Thanks,
      Brian
      ?????.??????@????.???

[ I think Lexan is a thermosetting plastic, in which case it'd ruin
it... -S. ]

Subject: Care and Feeding of Meerschaum

I recently bought a nice small Meerschaum (on SALE!),
but after smoking my first from this wonderful device,
I realized that I had no idea how to care for it.

I know to avoid water and heavy scraping, but are there
any other details I am missing? For instance, do I want
to build the same kind of carbon cake as on my briar?

(In case you were wondering, it's carved into a grinning
 skull. It's got about a ten minute bowl, which is a bit
 small, but better to little than too much.)

Subject: Dry tobacco

Greetings to all:
	I find that if my tobacco is getting too dry, there is a
*quick* technique for making it moist again.  Simply place a damp
chunk of paper towel, napkin, etc., in the container where the tobacco
is stored.  It only needs to be mildly damp.  The tobacco should soak
up the water within 24 hours like mad, leaving the paper towel dry as
bone.  As with other similar techniques, it is difficult to regulate
moistness, and might just take some experimentation.  When I have
tried it, it has made ten month old tobac seem like new.
	I know someone who likewise puts a slightly damp napkin in his
cigar box sometimes - when he first gets the box.  He never
replenishes it if it gets dry.
		David U.

[ Done that for years, too. And IMHO, it works better than humidifier
buttons. -S. ]

Subject: How long until cigar goes bad?

I don't have a humidor so I was wondering how long I can keep a cigar
before it will no longer be enjoyable to smoke.I just bought a
Macanudo but am waiting for a special occasion to try it out. Any
suggestions for keeping cigars for someone on a poor college students
budget?

[ Tupperware would likely work better than wood for a humidor. If you
have about $25 and want something fancy, you can also get a hygrometer
from Edmund Scientific and put it in there. Their address is in the

Subject: Pipes Digest

Hi NET Smokers,

It was a great surprise to find the monthly letter in alt.smokers.
Let me introduce myself -

My name is Ib FAGERLUND, 37 years of age and i've been smoking the
pipe since my teenage years.

During the last 10 years i have spend a lot of time arranging the
annual Danish Championship in Pipesmoking. Every year we form a group
of about 10 people, who will use about 6 month's to knit this show
together.

We usualy have around 400 participants for the contest, plus a very
beautiful exhibition of pipes, tobaccos and related items. As you
might know, we have some of the worlds best pipe carvers in Denmark.
People like Winslow, Bang, Hedegaard, Ph Vigen etc. show their latest
products, along with factory made pipes from Stanwell, Refbjerg, G.
Jensen .... You name it (try to avoid slobber in the keyboard).

Three years ago i was elected for the executive committee of the
Nordic Smokers Guild; a nordic pipe smokers club, counting around 600
members, mainly living in Denmark, Sweden and Norway.

This year, our club has the honour to host the World Championship in
Pipe Smo- king 1994. It will be heldt in Copenhagen, Denmark october
8th - 9th 1994.  We expect somewhere around 400 participants from all
around the world, and i can promise a blast of an exhibition. The
contest and exhibition will be open for spectators at no charge. So if
you'r in the neighbourhood, feel free to join us.

If you have interrest in any of these arrangements, just drop me a
note and i will put you on our mailing list (full postal address,
please).

By the way -

Denmark is known for being quite liberal on the smoking issue. It's
hard to find a no-smoking restaurant around here, so it will be a
while before we will join you in the 'Great North Woods' !

Good puffin'

	How do I go about putting life back into the leaf?  Also,
	I never cut the end off the cigar, I just put a hole in the
	end to allow for a draw ...

I won't go so far as to say "no wonder you didn't like
it, it was dry." The taste of cigar and pipe tobacco is
quite different. I like them both for different reasons.

However, a dry cigar is not nearly as nice as a properly-humidifed one.
To rehumidify cigars, I put them in my cedar box, unwrapped
(if they came wrapped in plastic or anything else)
with a home-made humidifier: a tightly-rolled Handiwipe. The
rolled-up Handiwipe sits in a small tray to keep moisture off the wood.
It is tied up with a small rubber band. This takes up space in the box
but it's a large box so there is plenty of room. (I built the box
out of Tennesee aromatic cedar). You could also do this with tupperware.

The difference between a well-humidified cigar and a
dry one is remarkable. But they aren't the same smoke
as a pipe.

Off to enjoy my Peterson,

&gt; Where's Thacker been through all this cigar talk anyhow? 

In fact, I've been out of town, conducting research at the Library of 
Congress and other important archives.  The result is this report, and I
hope it's worth the wait!

In a previous issue of the digest, I commented on how the history of briar
(brought to us by the Mongols) was confused by the possible influence of 
the Egyptians, and promised to expound on that comment.  

Excavations of the tombs of Tutankhamen and other Egyptian nobility 
indicate that pipes figured heavily in the mummification and burial ritual.
The Egyptians believed that smoking raised one's spiritual consciousness;
symbolically, a small portion of the deceased's heart was burned in a brass
device not unlike the Turkish hookah.  But a startling revelation at the 
1992 Conference of the Chicago Association for Lost Aegypt has shed new 
light on this practice.  

The Conference featured a panel discussion on the construction of the
pyramids, and was widely attended by historians, archaeologists, and
architects.  While this blue-ribbon team made much progress in
understanding ancient Egypt, the real breakthrough came as an event
of pure serendipity.  

It chanced that the hotel was also hosting another conference, this one for
the Benevolent Alliance of Sausage Handlers. The meatpackers were having 
quite a time celebrating their 50th anniversary (held, of course, in the 
city known as "hog butcher for the world"), and the liquor was flowing fast.  

One of the attendees was none other than Jimmy Dean, who I'm sure many of
you have seen on television advertisements.  Just how drunk he was isn't 
recorded, but he was far enough gone that he accidentally staggered into 
the wrong ballroom.  Expecting to hear a lecture on the latest sausage 
curing techniques, Jimmy found himself looking at a cross-section of 
Cheop's pyramid.  He leaned over and whispered to a woman standing nearby,
in a voice loud enough to be heard throughout the room, "Mah mama used to
cure hams in a smokehouse lahk that!  Mmm-mmm!"   

After the ushers had removed Mr. Dean, several of the archaeologists
realized that he was on to something; in certain ways, the pyramid *did*
look like a smokehouse.  And when word spread that the sausage conference
had an open bar, a motion to merge the two conferences for an
"interdisciplinary exchange of ideas" passed unanimously.

The result, of course, was the now-famous 1992 CALA-BASH conference.  It
took another 9 months to confirm their initial findings, but confirmed they
were.

Once the scribbled, beer-stained notes from the convention were deciphered,
the conference proceedings were published.  The long-standing belief that
mummification was meant to preserve a body for resurrection was debunked.
"Instead," the proceedings stated, "the burial process was a spiritual 
send-off for the deceased.  The body, in funereal wrappings, was placed in
a sarcophogas, itself on a bier surrounded by the finest tobaccos.  A 
charcoal burner was set alight, kindling the tobacco, then the entranceway
to the tomb sealed.  Cleverly designed channels in the pyramid itself acted
to create draft, bringing fresh oxygen into the smoking chamber and burning
the tobacco at a precisely-controlled rate.  The aromatic vapors permeated
the sarcophogas (itself needed to protect the body from the heat), 
literally smoke-curing the body while, it was believed, helping the soul 
loft upward toward heaven.  " 

Seen in this context, the ritual burning of a piece of the deceased's heart
is now seen as a ceremony performed for the benefit of the survivors, a
symbolic demonstration of what was taking place inside the pyramid.  And
the pyramids may rightly be considered the largest pipes ever built.

This breakthrough naturally led researchers to look for further evidence of
pipelore in Egyptian history, and many significant finds were made.  We now
know that the earliest Egyptian pipes were constructed of sun-baked brick,
being thicker (and heavier) than our modern clay pipes.  These quickly
became a rage, demand growing so fast that the Hebrews were enslaved to 
make the brick pipes, and records prove that shortages of stems were 
frequent.  (The Bible records one such incident during the reign of
Ramses; sadly, mis-translation from the Greek has turned "stems" into
"straw.")

As Egyptian culture became more sophisticated, so too did their pipes, so
that within a few hundred years ornately painted pipes were common among 
the rich.  Skilled artisans became interested in pipemaking, and intricate
carvings became the rule of the day.  Most of these were stereotypically 
Egyptian, featuring busts of jackal-headed gods; clearly these were the 
ancestors of today's carved meerschaums (which, adapted to western custom,
now portray skulls and the like).  

Finally, with the advent of metalworking, elaborate brass water pipes
evolved.  These were to have tremendous impact on Middle Eastern culture;
more durable than clay, they could survive the hardships of travel and were
thus ideal for the many nomadic tribes in the region.  They became a staple
in Arab culture; indeed, Aladdin's "Magic Lamp" was originally a water
pipe. (Sadly, anti-smoking revisionists have warped that legend beyond
recognition.)

It can be shown that Arab coffee makers began as modified water pipes; so
the final irony is that espresso, so beloved to our modern tobacco-hating
crowd, owes its origin to smoking!

Ancient Egypt must also be credited with the invention of the pipe nail;
in this case, miniature gold obelisks, which chemical analyses have shown
to bear traces of tobacco ash.  On the other hand, ashtrays were unknown to
them, which was to have tragic consequences for the Library at Alexandria.

Briar, sadly, was unknown to Africa until the Crusades, and no other
suitable wood was found in the Middle East, though legends recount several
failed attempts at wooden pipes.  (Bible scholars believe that the story of
Moses and the Burning Bush is an allegory for the ancient pipemaker's
quest for a suitable wood.)

So it was that Egypt's influence on smoking was exclusively in the form of
the hookah.  These traveled far and wide; certainly reaching as far as
Turkey and India, where they remain to this day an important cultural
element.

Subject: meerschaum care, Esoterica Tobacciana

A question came up about meerschaum care, specifically about
whether meerschaums need a carbon cake.  The answer is no--you
don't want them to develop any cake.  It inhibits  the coloring
process.  Do do have to be careful about removing the cake, so
you don't remove meerschaum material from the inside of the bowl.

Meerschaums can be a pain in some ways--their fragility requires
careful care, and it's not safe to smoke one outdoors--but the
fact that they don't need a carbon cake is a real advantage.  No
breaking in is required.  Since briar pipes require a
carefully-shaped cake to smoke well, I'm usually very meticulous
about smoking a bowl down to the bottom.  You don't have to worry
about that with a meerschaum, which is why if I want to smoke a
pipe close to bedtime, I'll often choose my meerschaum, since it
doesn't matter if I don't finish the bowl.

A follow-up on my concerns about the demise of Esoterica
Tobacciana...  Gregory Pease informed me via e-mail, much to my
delight, that ET is still in business, and will be shipping new
tins of their blends soon.  The reason why there's been such a
delay in filling orders is that ET is so meticulous about
insisting on only the very best tobaccos for their blends--which
makes the delay fully justified in my mind.

I'd encourage people on the list to try the ET blends if you can
get them in your area.  They're pricey, but worth the price if
you value good English blends.  After this false alarm, you can
bet that I'll be stockpiling away several pounds of these. :-)

Subject: Like fine wines...

I'm not sure of the exact issue, but Rolling Stone did an interview with
David Letterman a while ago (within the past year, say).  In it he mention
receiving a gift of a "perfectly humidored" cigar (again, the specifics
escape me).  Does this imply that tobacco has "vintages" that improve over
age?  The time scale for this aging was on the order of a number of years,
maybe 10 or so.  I'd never heard of doing anything like this, even if I could
muster the self-control to keep my hands off that last cigar.  Perhaps some
of you could educate me on this tobacco maturation process and things to look
for.

Also, Chris Cooper mentions wanting to keep his cigars around for a while,
but doesn't have a humidor.  There are certainly better alternatives to my
experience, but when I first started smoking cigars, and was still shopping
around for a humidor, I used to keep them inside a zip-lock with a humidity
element and put that inside another zip-lock.  And I'd put the whole thing
inside the fridge.  This worked quite well as far as I could tell at the
time.

quality. But you have to be careful, or you run the risk of insect
damage. See back issues of Cigar Aficionado for more info. -S. ]

Subject: Meerschaum

One thing I do know about meerschaum, why you're not supposed to touch the
meerschaum itself, is that the grease (and dirt, I suppose) on your hands might
leave a permanent fingerprint on the stuff when it's hot.  I have a meerschaum
(carved into the head of a lion) and was very careful not to touch the bowl for
a long time.  Then a friend of mine pointed out that a meerschaum owner will
mostly not touch the bowl in order to keep it as white as possible.  It may
never leave a fingerprint, but it will darken the meerschaum to a golden or
brown color.  After that I decided, like my friend, to start grabbing the bowl
anyway, because I too think the golden color looks good.  It may be profane in
the opinion of a true meerschaum fan, but what the hell.

[ I like the gold color too, but I thought that touching it prevented
it from darkening! -S. ]

 Ma&gt; We'd like to hear from you, and hope you'll help us to keep the
 Ma&gt; mailgroup going. For starters, why not take a few minutes and tell us
 Ma&gt; about yourself by return mail? We'd like to hear about your
 Ma&gt; preferences in pipes, tobacco, shops, books - anything you think your
 Ma&gt; fellow pipeists would be interested in knowing.

Well, I've been smoking pipes and cigars since 1972. My father smoked a
pipe, but never cigars. He gave up his pipe years ago, but I'm still
puffing.
My preferences in pipes include Dunhills (when I can get them for half
price), my Ashton (an estate pipe), Petersons, and Americans. The latter
are hand made pipes by a guy from Pennsylvania. They start at about $65
and go up, but they smoke like much more expensive pipes. No fills, very
well made with good briar. They are sold all over the DC area, but I
don't think he sells them outside of this area.
For pipe tobacco, I'm smoking two blends right now. Both are from pipe
shops, but contrary to what they'd like you to believe they don't mix
them at the shop. Most of these guys buy their blends from one or more
of several different distributers. The two blends I am smoking are
distributed by Lane's. The first almost everybody has. Lane's calls it
1Q.  If you ask your pipe shop what blend they sell more than any other,
whatever they call it, it's probably really 1Q. They other is also from
Lane's. I don't know its real name, but it's a light Latakia blend.
Cigars: I'm firmly of the opinion that life is too short to smoke bad
cigars. I'd rather smoke fewer of a good cigar than alot of bad cigars.
Nevertheless, I'll put my favorites into three categories by price:
1. Money is no object:
Cohiba Robustos (Cuba)
Davidoff Special R
Davidoff Special T
2. Moderately expensive:
Santa Damiana
Dunhill Vintage (blue labels)
3. Best cigar for the money:
Arturo Fuente's Chateau Fuente (about $1.70 for a rich medium strength
Rothschild shape cigar that tastes good right down to the very end).

 Ma&gt; Now,  back to cigars.  Not to offend any of you guys but -- well --
 Ma&gt; Sheesh!  What are you guys?  Maschochicts  uh? Massochists um? Machss-
 Ma&gt; Crazy?  I was lulled in to a false sense of security by all your
 Ma&gt; wonderful messages on the list and went out and bought myself a few
 Ma&gt; stogies.  Sheesh! I had one on the way home and kept wondering why the
 Ma&gt; car was spinning whilst I didn't even turn the wheel?!?!  Good lord,  I

 What kind of cigar did you try? Cigars very widely in strength and
 taste. For a good quality, but very mild, cigar, try the Macanudo
 (other than the Hyde Park, which is a little stronger).  Also, you'll
 find that the wider ring gauges smoke cooler.
     I did
 Ma&gt; notice that the cigar was a bit on the dry side (leaf flakes coming off
 Ma&gt; during the smoke).  How do I go about  putting life back into the leaf?

Once the leaf starts coming off, that cigar is history. If it hasn't
gotten to that stage yet, but it back into a hunidified environment for
a week or two. If you don't have a humidifier, make one out of a
Tupperware-style container and a humidifier from you local pipe shop.

 Ma&gt; Also,  I never cut the end off the cigar, I just put a hole in the end
 Ma&gt; to allow for a draw (Is this why they made  me want to kiss the
 Ma&gt; ground).)?

I'm told that tends to concentrate the smoke. I prefer the guillotine
cut, myself.

 Ma&gt; 	BTW, I'm going to contact Customs and ask about the "personal
 Ma&gt; use" and other allowances for Cuban cigars (as I promised before I

 Last time I looked at a customs form, it said that the personal use
 exemption for Cuban cigars was only for foreigners visiting the US.

 Ma&gt; It is extremely frustrating to find a tobacco one really likes and
 Ma&gt; then  see it suddenly disappear.  In Washington D.C. a couple of years
 Ma&gt; ago I  picked up a couple small (one oz.) tins of something called
 Ma&gt; Coral Flake  at the D.C. JR Tobacco shop.  It was made by the firm of

I know that the JR's in DC does mail order. Have you tried calling them
to see if they still have it?


 Ma&gt; I don't have a humidor so I was wondering how long I can keep a cigar
 Ma&gt; before it will no longer be enjoyable to smoke.I just bought a
 Ma&gt; Macanudo but am waiting for a special occasion to try it out. Any
 Ma&gt; suggestions for keeping cigars for someone on a poor college students
 Ma&gt; budget?
Yes, spend $2 or $3 on a Tupperware-style container long enough to fit
your cigars, then spend another $3 on a tube-type humidifier from a pipe
shop. Fill it only with distilled water, and you'll have a humidor that
works just as well as the $300 versions.


... Power corrupts, absolute power, however, is kinda neat.

BTW Steve, the subscription rate is only $10, not the $15 that you list,
what has happened is that i assign a 1 1/2 year subscription to anyone
sending $15.  However with the cost increases in paper and postage over
the past 5 years, I have been considering increasing the sub rate....$15
may be a good number.
    Another item that I have been working on is the first A&amp;M Gazette
Calendar.  I have most of the pages done, using a different photograph
for each month from the photo collection of Paul Spaniola.  It actually
looks pretty decent.  Dont know what i will be charging for them, but
will have a mention or advertisement in the March issue (yes the next
issue will be in March) including price.  Who knows, maybe i will just
skip the whole thing and wait until 1995.  I have some old photographs
from the 1950's of Mastercraft pipe company etc.  Looks interesting.
aal for now,  neil

[ I'll correct the Resource Guide sometime next week. Looking forward
to those calendars! -S. ]

Subject:      Arturo Fuente 8-5-8's mail-order.

Answer to Brian Morgan's question about $1.20 Arturo Fuentes 8-5-8
by mail order:

JR Tobacco (1-800-JR-CIGAR) sells the box of 25 for $28.95.

Since my orders are usually in the $200 range, (about every four months)
the $3 shipping/handling charge they add to the total order is
inconsequential.  For a single box order though, it raises the price
by more than 10%, to $31.95.  Still, a pretty good deal.

Suggestion: Get a couple of friends, and order 2-3 boxes each.
The boxes they come in are some of the prettiest boxes on the market
today.  You can proudly keep the cigars in there as you use them.

Smoke in peace,

Marios H. Agrotes

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #127 - January 21, 1994

&gt;Anyway,  I've found the best way to deal with tobacco dry out in the
&gt;pouch is to buy a button himidfier.  This is similar to what you would
&gt;put in your humidor when storing the tobacco, but is small enough to
&gt;stay in your pouch.

My father suggested putting an apple slice in with the tobacco.  He
does that with popcorn that needs moisture.  Well, it's not the worst
advise he ever gave me; but it did ruin about 2 oz of otherwise good
tobacco.  I finally gave up and bought a jar with the soak stone in
the lid.  Now I have one at work and at home.  It looks nice and is
effective in keeping an even humidity.

&gt;A tobacconist once suggested to me that I mix some honey and some
&gt;cigarette ash, and coat the inside of a non-carbonised bowl; then
&gt;bake the pipe (without the stem) in a hot oven until the stuff caramelizes.
&gt;So I've done that with a few pipes, and I can't complain.  Also, a
&gt;trick I learned from my dad is to alternate full and half bowls with
&gt;a new pipe.
                        [snip]
&gt;I recently bought a nice small Meerschaum (on SALE!),
&gt;but after smoking my first from this wonderful device,
&gt;I realized that I had no idea how to care for it.
&gt;
&gt;I know to avoid water and heavy scraping, but are there
&gt;any other details I am missing? For instance, do I want
&gt;to build the same kind of carbon cake as on my briar?
&gt;
&gt;[ I've heard you're not supposed to touch the bowl with your hands;
&gt;some people use gloves. Any meerschaum fans out there? -S. ]
&gt;
One of the flyers I picked up at Tinder Box (chain store that sells
tobacco, pipes, cigars, etc.) suggest filling any pipe loosely with
tobacco, tamping to 1/3 of the pipe volume, refilling loosely, tamp
to 2/3 volume, overfill loosely, tamp level.  When breaking in a
pipe, they recommend smoking ten bowls that were filled loosely and
tamped to 1/3 volume.  Then smoke 10 more bowls at the 2/3 level.
This builds up an even carbon cake.  The carbon can withstand
extremely high temperature so the briar will be protected from the
burning contents.

Meerschaum is sea foam that has been hardened.  Since a meerschaum
already is rock and will not burn like wood pipes, there is no need
for a carbon cake.  It also is porous so it absorbs oils from the
tobacco.  Smoking tobaccos with a higher oil content (ie naturally
flavored instead of using sugary flavor additions) provide more oil
that can be absorbed.  This produces the graceful characteristic of
the style.  The pipe can also absorb oil from your hands.  When the
pipe was manufactured, the bowl was covered with wax to inhibit the
oils from being absorbed into the pipe from the outside.  This wax
will become hot enough to melt when you smoke your new pipe.
Touching the bowl may remove wax so some people wear gloves.

I was looking at a meerschaum lined briar because it smokes evenly.
The tobacconist recommended a low grade, all-meerschaum bowl.  I've
been a fan ever since.  I have a few collector-type pipes in my
collection, but I don't worry about the meerschaum as a collector
item.  I like it because I don't get hot spots and less juice comes
up from the bowl.  The only drawback I found was that a small pipe,
especially a meerschaum, is frequently considered drug paraphernalia.

[ I had some meerschaum-lined pipes once, but no more. For some
reason, I guess I liked the wood-walled ones better. Probably because
the lined pipes tended to have lower grade surfaces. -S. ]

<TITLE>Pipes Digest Article: 129.010</TITLE>

<body>
<pre>
From: JOSEPH MAXIMILLIAN MURPHY &lt;???????@???.???&gt;
Subject: Various and sundry tobacky stuff

Well, after a few healthy months of lurking, I'm finally getting down to
writing in to the Digest. Most recent things first: a tip I've heard on
re-moistening pipe tobacco. My father, a veteran pipe and cigar smoker since
before my earliest days, suggested this technique to me. Make a few small
slices of apple and put them in your pouch. (Eat the remaining apple.) This
works on the same principle as the "moistened napkin" technique: the dried out
tobacco will absorb the moisture from the apple in a matter of days, without
actually having to contact water directly. It also, according to Da, gives the
tobac a nice apple flavor. One caveat: in a day or two, check your tobacco and
take out the fruit! Otherwise, somewhere down the road, you end up smoking some
vile green fuzzy thing, and talking to little purple snakes from Alpha
Centauri for a couple of hours.

Why was I interested in re-moistening tobacco, you ask? Well, this is for the
"don't buy this mass produced garbage" thread. I recently made the mistake of
picking up a pouch of Borkum Riff Whiskey in a 7-11. Blech. I think I know what
"bite" is now. It's interesting to note that the first tobacco I ever bought, a
"black forest" house blend (more on that later) is still moist enough in a
little plastic baggie from last August, while this stuff in their "Hermetically
sealed special bag" is drier than any sawdust I've ever come across. But then,
I think it may be older than I am, too. Yes, from now on, it's only real
tobacco shops for me. No more drug stores.

As that reveals, I'm new to pipe smoking. I got a little baby bowl pipe for a
pretty low price at a tobacconist's in Bethany Beach, Delaware. (Notice to all
pipe-smoking beach goers in the Delmarva area of the U.S. East Coast: check it
out. It's a small little place and I can't recall the name, but the guy I dealt
with was nice to a couple of relatively new smokers. And hey, how many places
can you go to a good tobacconist's and then be on the beach 2 minutes later?)
That's also where we picked up the "black forest," a nice blend I think. Mild
and tasteful. The guy ion the shop claimed it was blended with "malt;" I now
know a little about homebrewing (although I've done even less) and I don't see
anything that looks like what I expect actual malted grain to look like. Maybe
he's talking about extract? Any ideas? Anyway, the "black forest" is a short,
thick cut; would this be the "flake" you folks talk about? The Borkum Riff
(blech again) is longer and thinner, is that the Cavendish? I'm thinking of
getting a bigger bowl size soon; the one I have doesn't seem to hold the
longer cut very well. I also have a question about the pipe I've got. I know
diddley about its composition, but the bowl is terribly pitted. Little tiny
holes all over. Why might this be, and is it bad?

Anyway, I have to get to work. I'll send a personal bio and some of my cigar
habits along in a while.

[ A while later... -S. ]

So, on to cigars. I'm afraid these comments might offend some of the more
high-quality readers. I like drug store cigars. Maybe it's because of the
psychological connections; they were easy to find and afford when I was and 
undergrad doing lots of technical theatre and looking for something to
enhange my faux-macho image. It's just the way I am: I like King Edwards. Not
enough to keep a supply on hand, you understand, but every now and then for
special occasions like a show opening. You can share them with your friends
without going in hock. There was a recent compliment to Backwoods; while I
remember the quality of the smoke as better than the King Eddies, I couldn't
tell which end you lit from the end you put in your mouth! They're virtually
untapered, as I recall. I spent much of that evening spitting out chunks of
tobacco. I did get something, though, a Dutch Masters or Hav-A-Tampa, that
was just about unsmokable, so maybe I'm past that phase now. As for real
cigars, I've tended to have bad experiences. A friend brought me a Romeo y
Julieta back from the UK; while it smoked nice, the nicotine punch is too
much for an occasional smoker. I'd have to advise against smoking these at
6 am on an empty stomach after a major fight with your SO. (Good news is that
the RyJ is gone, but many months later, the SO and I are still around.) I
forget the brand, but I think I had a Churchill-size once. Biggest cigar I've
ever seen in my life. Easily the size of my forearm. Light colored, and very
smooth, with a firm ash, as I recall. But again, a ittle too much for this
poor dope. I'd have to recommend against mixing these with greasy food and a
little too much booze. Ah well, I was young; we live and learn. And I think
the cigar was not so much to blame as the food and drink.

I think that should serve as an intro to the group. Thanks for your comments,
questions, etc. By the way, Steve, I seem to remember subscribing to the user
name "pipes," but I'm sending this through the one on top of the Digest as I
get it. Is either preferable?

                          (-"Lemon", U2)                        

[ Thanks for the de-lurk, Murph, and glad to hear from a fellow
Delawarean! But see Neil Flatter's letter above regarding apple
slices. -S. ]

Someone on the list wrote that he tends to have bad experiences with
"real cigars" and cites as an example the Romeo Y Julieta a friend
brought back from England.
Look, Cubans, general, and that cigar in particular, are much stronger
than your average Dominican or Jamaican cigar.  And, in my view, Romeo Y
Julietas are the most poorly made modern Cuban cigars.  Try some good
Dominicans before you reject the good ones categorically.

Subject: Another post for your newsletter

To all you Netters on the Pipes Mailgroup:

     I recently went to Camelot Tobacco at the Continent (Busch Blvd
on the north end of Columbus, OH) and picked up a batch of new cigars.
I discovered that Fonseca Cigar rejects are sold under the name
Rollers Choice.  I picked up several Rothschild Sized cigars (5'x 50)
and as far as I could tell they were rejected for wrapper blemishes.
The Fonseca cigar brand has a grassy tea character with a sharp after
taste just like Cigar Aficiando says.  This kind of taste may not be
to every ones liking but it sure breaks the monotony of smooth woody
creamy tastes of other Dominican made cigars.  The Fonsecas are well
made and burn evenly.

In my next post I will lay out where to find all the big brand
rejects.  These provide the same taste at one-half to one-third of
brand name price.

                                        Neal

        Steve: I have two requests that I am sure you can help me with.
        My brother has taken to making pipes, he does very nice work, and
he is looking for a source of briar, since he is just getting started I
would like to be able to tell him some sources of various quality briar. My
second question is, is this information in the resource guide and how do I
get a copy of the resource guide?

It is clear that I am not worthy of the information presented by
Mr. Thacker.  The research,  time,  and effort he has spent in 
giving us these valuable insights into smoking history have been
truly worth the price paid.  I,  for one,  bow low to Mr. Thacker
and congratulate him on his research.  Job well done.

Subject: Possibly for the Pipes Digest

Steve,

I thought this little tidbit might amuse you and maybe some of the
other hams that read the Digest. It's pretty tangential to the subject
of smoking, so if you choose not to put it in the digest, I'll
understand completely. It's lifted wholesale from Purps 57, another
email magazine I subscribe to.

By the way, I'm from Maryland, not Delaware. Rockville, actually, just
outside DC. I just vacation in Delaware, because I've outgrown Ocean
City, MD. B-)

===============================================================================
As reported in the San Francisco Chronicle, Tuesday, December 28, 1993, p. A10:

           RADIO AMATEURS TAKEN IN BY "ALIEN INVASION"
        British cops set up sting to catch eavesdroppers
                     Reuters News Service

Doncaster, England.  Police in northern England turned the tables on ham
radio operators who eavesdrop on police by issuing a spoof broadcast of
aliens landing nearby and then arresting those who turned up to see the
"spacemen."

South Yorkshire police ordered "Operation Marconi" when they suspected that
criminals were cashing in on information gleaned from the airwaves, the
Guardian reported yesterday.

The eavesdroppers "could hardly believe their ears -- aliens were invading
planet Earth ... Doncaster to be exact," said the report, citing the latest
edition of a local police magazine.

It said several people were arrested and charged with acting illegally
on information in police broadcasts.

Scanning equipment can be legally purchased for a few dollars, and it is
not illegal to eavesdrop on police broadcasts.  But it is against the law
to act on any information overheard when monitoring police frequencies.

Subject:      Smoke Report

Hello All,
I'm continuing to enjoy the Pipes Digest: learning something
new each week it seems. It seems that this list spans a pretty
good cross-section of tobak aficianados from all walks of life,
and it's pretty amazing when you can see one common thread which
seems to come up regularly, almost across the board. It seems that
by and large, this list believes the Arturo Fuente 8-5-8 to be one of
the best "everyday" cigars out there. I'm stopping by to pick up one
for tonight after work. I prefer the maduro wrapper, and they are a
true joy to smoke! The local shops have been out for some time, and
I just found out a new shipment has arrived. Another seeming favorite
is the AF Hemingway Classic. Smoke shop should have some of those in
now as well, but I'll probably save one of those pricey beauties for
a special occasion.

Another very good cigar which I can heartily recommend is the H.
Upmann Churchill. I've smoked two in a row and found them to be
extremely good. Right up there,close to, but still not on par with
the 8-5-8, IMHO.  But there again, different cigars for different
moods, right?

Another that I tried recently was a Te-Amo Churchill. This maduro
wrapped cigar was a huge churchill! It was beautifully wrapped, and
the wrapper had an excellent spicy flavor. I thought I was in for a
treat. Well, I lit it up and waited, waited, waited. This was the most
bland, character-less smoke I have ever tried! Mild is a kind word,
this cigar was nothing short of wimpy! The draw was pathetic; I put
it out after about 15 minutes of nothing. At $2.60, I said "I coulda
had two 8-5-8's!" Anyone else know anything of the Te-Amo? It is a
Mexican smoke.....is it typical of Mexican handrolls?

May good smokes come your way,

Subject: New Guy

Steve,
When I read my first post from you I felt like I was standing in the
Tobacco Taverne in State College, BSing and inhaling the wonderful
odors.  I lived in Turkey for a while in a little town with several
meerschaum carvers.  They used to put bushel baskets of pipes out in
front of their shps with seconds in them.  We typically paid a couple
obucks per pipe.  A very common design was the man's head with turban.
I sent pipes back to everyone that smoked.  Care of pipes became a subject
of much discussion.  Our best information was that the oil from fingers
caused darker spots in the golden color that everyone strove for.  We
would buy pieces of chamois and make little custom shaped gloves for our
pipes.  A friend who had smoked pipes, particularly meerschaum, for years told
me to pack the first pinch like a baby, the second pinch like a little
girl, the third pinch like a young boy, and the final pinch like a man.
It may not be polictically correct, but it does burn nicely, allowing lots
of air circulation in the bowl.
The bottom line was that I had sent a pipe for everyone but me.  When my dad
died a few years ago, I got his meerscyhaum.  At Christmas, my brother-in-
law gave me an eqagle claw holding a bowl that I had sent him twenty years
ago.  He has since stopped smoking and wanted me to have it back.  It
has a wonderful color and draw.
Please pardon the typos, my cursor keys are gifing me fits.
Thanks for a great list.
Bob Lambert

Subject: Shoe comic

I was just curious to know if anybody else noticed the Shoe comic strip about
cigars a while back. In it, a bird walks into a cigar shop and asks the
tobacconist for a box of 50 caliber Il Duce Grandes. The tobacconist looks at
him and replys "certainly sir, you can pick those up next week". A confused
look comes over the bird and asks why he'll have to wait until next week. The
tobacconist answers, "there's a five day waiting period on those."   ;)  
Just thought I'd share it with the rest of you.

Subject: The Ultimate Humidor, the Penultimate Hygrometer...

Well, ya win some and you lose some. You find a great smokeshop and
you get bashed by Billary and the EPA. You come up with the world's
greatest humidor, but it doesn't quite work.

Billary and the EPA, you already know about. Let's just hope it
doesn't happen the way they want it. Write your Congressthing. If you
need their address, ask me -- I've got the whole list.

The great smoke shop is Track Town in Cherry Hill, NJ. Right across
from the Garden State Racetrack. It doesn't look like much from the
outside, but they have some _very_ good pipes (Larsens, Ben Wades,
Upshalls...) and a fully-charged cigar humidor. Stop in if you're in
the Philadelphia area.

And for the great humidor, while I was in Cherry Hill, I took a short
drive to Edmund Scientific in Barrington. I was looking mainly for a
hygrometer, but I also found a dessicator. For those who don't know, a
dessicator is a huge glass jar with a heavy glass lid. They're
commonly used to dry things out in high-school biology labs; one fills
the bottom with kitty litter (to absorb moisture) and closes the lid.

I reasoned, that if it could keep things dry, why couldn't it also
keep them damp?  A heavy-glass, see-through humidor, with a ceramic
shelf and more capacity than any reasonable smoker could ever want.
And a great conversation piece to boot!

Well, forty dollars later, I owned it, and after forty more dollars I
also owned a digital hygrometer-thermometer. They all came back with
me to Chez Masticola, where I put the one, and all my worldly tobak,
inside the other. I could read the hygrometer through the glass, and
the humidity rapidly went up into the seventies. Great!

Well, not so great. Next morning, I awoke and, of course, immediately
went to read the hygro. Guess what? The numbers were so dim that I
couldn't read them. Checked the batteries. Nothing. Dried it with a
hair dryer. Nothing.

Then it dawned. The digital hygro works by sensing air capacitance.
Meaning that any condensing environment, which included the inside of
the antidessicator, would mess it up. Back to Edmund it went, with a
request that they send me an analog model instead.

Well, after I mail this, I think I'll drive home through the slush and
freezing rain (hasn't it been a _great_ winter? )|-P and have a quiet
Peterson to myself. My CHILL parser is working now, after a month of
late-night hacking. I've earned it.

And to all of you, here's hoping that you're warm and dry, that your
matches stay lit, and that your smoke smells wonderful to the ones you
love. Until next time, then,

				Smoke in peace,
				~\U Steve.

P.S. A question for the group: Has anyone run into a B&amp;B or
resort-type place that _welcomes_ pipefolk and cigarists? Love to hear
about it if so! -S.

&gt;         My brother has taken to making pipes, he does very nice work, and
&gt; he is looking for a source of briar

Sort of off the subject: I made a handful of pipes. I figured that I could
get a briar pipe anywhere, so I used various weird and exotic woods.

The pine pipe smoked exactly like you'd think. The rosewood pipe had (may
still have) a wonderful aroma that it added to the smoke. That week, I read
a long and scary article about allergies to hardwoods- With a little more
carelessness, I could have been killed. Eeek.

Now I just smoke what the nice man sells me. With a little extra perique.

Fumingly,

Martin

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #130 - February 11, 1994

&gt;   Someone on the list wrote that he tends to have bad experiences with
&gt;   "real cigars" and cites as an example the Romeo Y Julieta a friend
&gt;   brought back from England.
&gt;   Look, Cubans, general, and that cigar in particular, are much stronger
&gt;   than your average Dominican or Jamaican cigar.  And, in my view, Romeo Y
&gt;   Julietas are the most poorly made modern Cuban cigars.  Try some good
&gt;   Dominicans before you reject the good ones categorically.
&gt;
This comment is not quite complete.

ANY tobacco product, especially cigars, from the "continent" is STRONGER
than the "American" version.  This follows the general American proclivity
for "watered-down" versions of the real thing - like beer. It turns out
that today not only do American breweries churn out barrels of Lager
instead of Ale, but that Lager is only 4.0%! When I was in the military in
the late 60's, 3.2% beer was served at the PX and referred to as "Panther
P..." 

In the cigar world there is a style called EMS or European Market Selection.
This is different from the "maduro" or dark wrapper, although, in my
experience, the two terms are often interchanged. Both are DARK BROWN
wrappers, almost black, compared to the "candela" or "natural" wrappers.
The "candela" is easy to spot, it's green, while the "natural" ranges in
shades from tan to brown.

I have found that the EMS wrapper is "bitter" to my tastes, even on good
cigars (any manufacturer). I don't particularly enjoy the "maduro" although
most good cigars tend to have "dark natural" wrappers which some call
maduro.

And as for Romeo Y Juleita being a Cuban? I have a brochure from the
company on the occasion of their re-introduction to the American Market
after a 20 year absence (circa 1982). They characterize themselves:

"Romeo Y Julieta is an old and respected name in the cigar industry. We
believe it to be the last of the really famous Cuban brands to re-enter the
American Market." They go on to describe their quest to find new tobacco
sources until, "We found the two bends that would more than fulfill the
desires of the most discriminating of cigar smokers world-wide."
Cameroon Deluxe from the Dominican Republic and "All Cuban Seed" from

all of their production from Cuba to these two locations - "Cuban-born
supervision," "Cuban-born rollers," "Cuban seed," expatriate Cuban cigar
experts," etc.

Subject: Pipes Digest #130 - February 11, 1994

These reminiscences may be a bit too long for the Digest but I wanted to pay
tribute a someone who educated me in the way of the pipe some 34 years ago.
Like many kids, I began with cigarettes, eventually going to six packs a day
(along with the jokes: Don always wears the same color clothes, ash gray;
you can find Don in a crowd by the cloud over his head, etc.). Finally I
figured what I was spending on butts and quit. A year later, I took up a
pipe, real cheapie, Dr. Grabow. Fortunately I dropped it and it broke after
a week. Turning to the Yellow Pages for a pipe shop, I found a modest ad for
a place near work. That's how I met Joseph Roth. Joe was a tobacconist and
pipe maker from the old school in Russia. When I met him he was 72 and told
me he began as an apprentice when he was 15. He was a perfectionist. The
pipes he made, and I'm lucky enough to still have four of his, including a
rough-cut (not sandblast) lumberman with a 6" shank, made from a single
piece of briar, were all from Algerian briar. Not just any Algerian briar.
Joe imported 6 tons of aged Algerian briar in 1911 which he stored in a
warehouse by NY's East River. Said when it ran out, he'd retire. Said no one
aged briar properly anymore. To age briar root, he said, one threw the briar
into a swamp and let it sit for several years; then air dried it for several
more. At that point, it was totally sapless, rock hard and ready for use. He
also aged and blended his own tobacco, using totally natural ingredients to
achieve different flavors. Each customer had "their blend" written in a
ledger and you could order any amount. He shipped blends all over the world.
That was the first time I learned that there were tobaccos that naturally
tasted of chocolate, vanilla, etc. He avoided Louisiana perique in his
blends because he said its high nicotine content could lead to heart
attacks.
 
Like many old-time tobacconists, Joe would willingly spend time explaining
his craft, which is how this snot-nosed kid learned how to tell birds eye
from straight grain; and how many sandblasts are covering up minor
imperfections in grain or wood. Finally he did run out of briar and retired,
selling his business and its name to a person who was an excellent pipe
repairer but not a pipe maker, named Lou Bascomb. Lou attempted to carry on
but he began using commercial spray-flavored tobaccos and customers such as
myself drifted away. I have _never_ found a blend to equal "mine" from those
days though now I do enjoy a commercial Danish wholesale blend of
cavendish-cut white burley which The Tabagerie in Westport CT retails as
"Riverboat". I'm glad Joe passed on before this country begain turning into
a People's Republic where the rights of the individual were trampled by a
politically correct (now _there's_ an oxymoron) vocal minority who insist
that only they know what's good for humanity.

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #130 - February 11, 1994

&gt;   I was just curious to know if anybody else noticed the Shoe comic
&gt;   strip about 
&gt;   cigars a while back. In it, a bird walks into a cigar shop and asks the
&gt;   tobacconist for a box of 50 caliber Il Duce Grandes. The
&gt;   tobacconist looks at 
&gt;   him and replys "certainly sir, you can pick those up next week". A confused
&gt;   look comes over the bird and asks why he'll have to wait until
&gt;   next week. The 
&gt;   tobacconist answers, "there's a five day waiting period on those."   ;)  
&gt;   Just thought I'd share it with the rest of you.

        "The Cigar Smoker's Shoe."

I wonder if McNelly has gotten rid of his old Underwood yet?

Subject: Re: Meerschaum stuff...

&gt;   Meerschaum is sea foam that has been hardened.  Since a meerschaum
&gt;   already is rock and will not burn like wood pipes, there is no need
&gt;   for a carbon cake.  It also is porous so it absorbs oils from the
&gt;   tobacco.  Smoking tobaccos with a higher oil content (ie naturally
&gt;   flavored instead of using sugary flavor additions) provide more oil
&gt;   that can be absorbed.  This produces the graceful characteristic of
&gt;   the style.  The pipe can also absorb oil from your hands.  When the
&gt;   pipe was manufactured, the bowl was covered with wax to inhibit the
&gt;   oils from being absorbed into the pipe from the outside.  This wax
&gt;   will become hot enough to melt when you smoke your new pipe.
&gt;   Touching the bowl may remove wax so some people wear gloves.
&gt;
&gt;From a brochure entitled "Why buy Meerschaum" - C.A.O Meerschaums - 1985
                                                1-800-BEST CAO (?sill valid?)

                WHY BUY MEERSCHAUM?

Simply put, because it affords a unique smoking experience. Meerschaum is
the most flavorful and beautiful pipe you can own. Meerschaum - one on the
most porous substances found in nature - acts as a filter,  absorbs tobacco
tars and nicotine, and yields a most satisfying smoke. Meerschaum smokes
cool and dry with a flavor unrivaled by another pipe. As it ages,
meerschaum colors a rich honey-brown, improving both in appearance and
taste.

Meerschaum Pipes - with a minimum of proper care - will last for a
lifetime. They will not burn out as briars do.

A CAO meerschaum is an investment in smoking pleasure

                ENJOY THE ARISTOCRAT OF PIPES.

As beautiful as meerschaum is to the eye, its true beauty must be
experienced.

A meerschaum is made to smoke.

Hold it. Enjoy its light weight and silky feel, its distinctive taste, its
ripening to a mellow golden-brown.

Justly deserving its reputation as the "aristocrat" of pipes, the
meerschaum is not meant for the connoisseur alone. All pipe smokers can
appreciate the unique pleasure of meerschaum.

                MEERSCHAUM - A GIFT FROM THE SEA.

"Meerschaum" is a German word meaning literally, "sea-foam," alluding to
the belief that it was the compressed whitecaps of waves. Meerschaum is a
mineral - hydrous silicate of magnesium - of organic origin. Composed of
the fossilized shells of tiny sea creatures that fell to the ocean floor
millions of years ago, meerschaum is found in red clay deposits. The
average size of the meerschaum blocks extracted from the clay is about the
size of a grapefruit.

                THE JEWEL OF ESKISHEHIR

Meerschaum deposits of the highest quality are found only in one place in
the world - in the small city of Eskishehir in central turkey. And here the
deposits are confined to an are of only 4 square miles. 

Mined with hand tools, and by men trained in this singular family
tradition, meerschaum is excavated at depths ranging from 200 to 300 feet.
The miners wash the raw meerschaum lumps and sort them into 5 categories
according to quality. Each of these 5 categories is further divided into 12
qualities according to size, color porosity and homogeneity of the
mineral." 

"The BLOCK-MEERSCHAUM - not to be confused with pressed meerschaum - is
shipped to the manufacturer. And only the purest 10% of this block
meerschaum is judged suitable for CAO pipes.

                CRAFTING THE WORLD'S FINEST PIPES

Nearly 300 years ago, the first meerschaum pipe was carved by hand. And
today, these unique pipes are still carved by hand.

The carver, a craftsman of unique ability and long experience, examines
each piece of meerschaum, calculating the lines of cleavage along which it
should be split.The split block-meerschaum is soaked in water for 15-30
minutes until the material achieves a cheese-like consistency. 

Working with the softened material, the carver determines the rough shape
of the pipe before the bowl and draft hole are bored. Like all fine
hand-crafted articles, no two meerschaums are alike.

The carved meerschaum goes into a kiln at high temperature, a process that
removes all moisture from the mineral. The shank is threaded and fitted
with a stem.

After meticulous polishing with the finest grade abrasives, the meerschaum
is ready for waxing. Though there are many different wax formulas, beeswax
alone yields the rich coloring associated with the finest Meerschaums.
Melted and then bleached, the beeswax is ready to receive the pipe itself.
The subtle differences in color and tone among CAO pipes are intentional,
achieve ed by careful dipping of the pipes a specific number of times.

Finally, the slightest imperfection detected in the finished pipe means
that it cannot wear the CAO name. The quality of each CAO meerschaum is
thus insured.

                SOME DO'S AND DON'TS FOR CAO MEERSCHAUM SMOKERS.

DON'T be afraid to handle or hold your meerschaum with clean hands.
Remember, you purchased a meerschaum primarily for your smoking pleasure.
The "Added" pleasure you derive from a meerschaum is watching it color as
you smoke it. 

The conventional wisdom on this topic is that handling a meerschaum while
warm removes the beeswax coating on the pipe, which highlights its
coloring. While this is true, only the purist - the smoker far more
concerned with the look of his pipe than his own smoking pleasure - need
wort about it. Besides, you can replace the wax coating removed by
handling very simply with CAO's Meerschaum Antiquing Compound.

DO take care when removing the stem of your CAO meerschaum by pulling it
and twisting it CLOCKWISE while supporting the shank with the fingers.
Replace the stem by pushing it and twisting it CLOCKWISE also. A little
care here will be repaid through a lifetime of smoking pleasure.

DON'T tap your CAO meerschaum against a hard surface. If you tap it in your
palm, be sure to support the shank firmly with your hand. This is sound
advice for briar pipe smokers also.

DON'T worry about "breaking in" your CAO meerschaum. Meerschaum pipes,
unlike briars, do not burn and hence need not be protected by a carbon
"cake" inside the bowl.

DO clean the cake or reside inside the bowl of you meerschaum. Use a
sharp-edged, blunt-ended tool. Avoid digging into the heel of the pipe when
cleaning the graft hole by not allowing the pipe cleaner to extend too far
into the bowl. [The meerschaum is WET and SOFT in the heel immediately
after a smoke. - whm.]

Smoke your favorite blend in your CAO meerschaum. Each pipe will color
differently. However this process depend on how often you smoke, not on
what tobacco you smoke.

Your CAO meerschaum dealer will be pleased to answer any further questions
you may have about our pipes. Be suer to ask about CAO's complete line of
meerschaum accessories.

Remember also who smokes CAO meerschaums: presidents, statesmen, doctors
and businessmen - people in all professions, all lines of work - and you.

                                -- 30 --

This has been typed with benefit of meerschaum lined calabash, a truly
light weight, large bowl pipe.

Sitting on my pipe shelf is my "Caveman Kit" pipe. I don't recall the
vendor, it was purchased at Holt's many years ago, it was a "carve it
yourself" meerschaum. A pre-drilled block (bigger than my fist),
instructions and beeswax. It smokes as well as my professionally carved
CAO and was fun to do.

&gt;   Subject: Various and sundry tobacky stuff
&gt;
&gt;   I also have a question about the pipe I've got. I know
&gt;   diddley about its composition, but the bowl is terribly pitted. Little tiny
&gt;   holes all over. Why might this be, and is it bad?
&gt;
Hmmm....Never heard of a pipe described as "pitted," especially with
"little tiny holes all over." However, assuming that the pipe is in fact
"whole" that is to say - these little tiny holes are only surface "holes",
and do not go through to the bowl... What you are likely the possessor of is
a pipe with a "sand blasted" finish. 

There are two basic pipe finishes - "smooth" or "sand blasted." 
There are as many different variations on both finishes as there are pipe
carvers or manufacturers, but those are the two categories that everyone
seems to use in describing the finished product.

With a smooth finish pipe, the briar is polished as any piece of wood
using varying degrees of abrasive until a high sheen is achieved -
essentially the same as a piece of fine furniture. The pipe is then buffed
and possibly waxed, much like a meerschaum.

A "sand blasted" finish is intended to enhance the grain structure of the
briar. Yielding "interesting patterns" in the surface of the pipe. Some
say it is a "more rugged" look. Here, quite literally, abrasive is blasted
against the briar causing the softer parts of the bowl to be abraded away
leaving the raised grain showing. Depending upon the kind of abrasive used,
the kind of briar, the "mood" of the craftsman all sorts of different "looks"
can be achieved.

&gt;          I just recently aquired a used pipe, a very interesting one to say

&gt;   inside and the part you put in your mouth (I know NO terminology, sorry!).
&gt;   Does anyone have any ideas on how I can identify this pipe?
&gt;
The most well known of the leather covered pipes is/was the French
Longchamp. They have the name and "Longchamp/France" stamped in the leather
up near where the mouthpiece joins the body. Also, if I remember correctly,
(I bit thorugh the origial and replaced it) the stem has a running horse
in white.

Subject:  Pipes Digest - ?FAQ vs Resource Guide?

Maybe the FAQ is just an appendix to the Resource Guide - or vice versa?

Here's a start. The definitions are "pretty good." They come from all over.
Some need more research and flesh - like the different types of stems,
tobaccos, etc.
--------------------------&lt;cut here&gt;--------------------------------
PIPE:   Narrow tube of clay, wood, etc. with bowl at one end for drawing in
smoke of tobacco. - Oxford English Dictionary

PIPE TYPES

BRIAR:  This is the closely-grained burl joint between the stem and roots of
the White Heath, a tree found on the hillsides of mainly Mediterranean
countries. Underground, this burl protects the briar wood, which is tough,
close grained, porous, and nearly impervious to heat. Good briar is hard to
find. The larger shrubs take a long time to mature...and the older the
shrub the better the briar and thus your pipe. The most suitable root may
be 80 to 100 years old, and the finest pipe briar may be from a shrub over
200 years old... aged and mellowed by time. 

MEERSCHAUM: A German word meaning literally, "sea-foam," alluding to the
belief that it was the compressed whitecaps of waves. Meerschaum is a
mineral - hydrous silicate of magnesium - one of the most porous substances
found in nature. Composed of the fossilized shells of tiny sea creatures
that fell to the ocean floor millions of years ago, meerschaum is found in
red clay deposits. Meerschaum deposits of the highest quality are found
only in one place in the world - Eskishehir, in central Turkey.

AFRICAN BLOCK MEERSCHAUM comes from Tanzania, Africa and is usually stained
in varying shades of brown, black and yellow.

MISSOURI MEERSCHAUM: The All-American Corncob pipe. It is a length of
hollowed-out corncob, usually from a special hybrid variety of corn, with
a straight wooden stem and, sometimes, a inexpensive plastic mouthpiece.
Some veteran pipe smokers buy corncobs by the dozens, smoke one until it
burns out or goes sour, then throw it away and light up another. (If a
youngster uses yours to blow soap bubbles, buy another.)

CALABASH: A South African gourd similar to a squash grown specifically for
use in pipes. The shape is determined as the gourd grows by placing small
blocks under the stem, forcing it into a gentle curve. The mature gourd is
cut and dried, then fitted with a cork gasket to receive a meerschaum bowl.
The finished pipe offers one of the coolest, driest smokes available. 
Immortalized by Sherlock Holmes and in Jimmy Durante's signature line - 
"Good night Mrs. Calabash - wherever you are."

CLAY PIPE: Clay or pottery pipes were very popular in England and in Europe
before the discovery of briar. In London coffee houses and clubs,
long-stemmed "Church wardens" and "London Straws" were universally accepted.
The finest clay for pipes is said to be found in Devon, England.

HOOKAH: Also known as a WATER-PIPE. The Turkish hookah filters the pipe
smoke through water (or booz) for extra coolness. Many styles of hookah
exist including those with multiple mouth pieces so that several may enjoy
the hashish simultaneously.

OPIUM PIPE: An Oriental water-pipe, normally made of brass with a very tiny
bowl used for smoking opium. Opium pipes are frequently seen with 12 or 18
inch long stems and fancy braiding.

CAST IRON: Normally used to carry natural gas.


PIPE PARTS:

BOWL: The part of the pipe that holds the tobacco.

HEEL: The base of the inside of the pipe bowl. 

SHANK: The part of the pipe that joins the bowl and the stem.

STEM: The part that connects the shank with the bit. 
Examine it carefully. Its quality, finish and fit will reveal the maker's
carelessness or attention to detail. 

BIT: The part of the pipe stem that fits in the mouth. Also called the
MOUTHPIECE. 

BITE-PROOF STEM: A bit designed with a solid center portion at the mouth to
prevent the "canine" tooth from punching a hole in it as readily as is done
in a standard bit. 

AMBEROID STEM: A fusion of Bakelite and pure amber - usually used with
meerschaum pipes.

BAKELITE STEM: Trade name for a synthetic resin widely used for lacquers
and varnishes and as a plastic.  A common material used for the stem,
especially of mass produced pipes. An alternative to vulcanite.

AMBER: brittle, feels like glass to the teeth - Usually used with
meerschaum pipes.

VULCANITE: A dark-colored variety of India rubber that has been subjected
to vulcanization : also called "hard rubber." A common material used for
the stem, especially of mass produced pipes. 

Lucite: Trade name for a plastic. A common material used for the stem,
especially of mass produced pipes.  

HORN STEM: Animal horn - often found on inferior meerschaum pipes

BONE STEM: Animal bone - often found on inferior meerschaum pipes

PIPE ACCESSORIES:

PIPE CLEANERS: Indispensable - two types - "soft and fluffy" to dry up
moisture or "thin and wiry" to dig out deposits.

LIQUID PIPE CLEANERS: Also called PIPE SWEETENERS, dissolve the gum and tar
while leaving a fresh aroma in the bowl, stem and mouthpiece. Frequently
featured in the "Dennis the Menace" comic strip.

SMOKERS COMPANION: Also called MULTI-PURPOSE PIPE TOOL, a spoon, a pick,
and a tamper in a metal holder. Usually built like a pocket knife, often
accompanied by a "knife blade reamer."

PIPE REAMER: A tool for smoothing out the "cake" and trimming it down to a
desired size. Reamers come in a variety of shapes and functionalities. 

PIPE RACK: A storage place for your pipes. To most enjoy pipe smoking one
needs several pipes to accommodate one's moods and activities.

HUMIDOR: A thing in which to store tobacco. Ideally - cheap and air-tight
(try Tupperware) - one places fresh tobacco in it and once sealed, it will
maintain the tobacco in a smokable consistency indefinitely. A major
alternate use of a humidor is the "re-moistening" of dried out tobacco.
For this action one adds a source of moisture to the tobacco in the humidor
before sealing. 


PIPE TERMS:

CAKE: A small layer of protective carbon allowed to form and remain in the
bowl of a briar pipe. The cake protects the briar from burning but too much
cake can split the pipe by causing uneven heating of the bowl.

DOTTLE: Unburned tobacco left in the heel of a pipe.
        

PIPE STYLES:

1-Freehand
2- smooth finish
3- sandblast

DUBLIN: An Irish style, shaped after the clay pipe.

BENT: A curved stem pipe

OOM PAUL: A large-boweled bent stemmed pipe name for the Boer leader who
smoked this variety.


TOBACCO:

TOBACCO: A member of the plant family "Solanaceae" which also includes
tomato  and potato plants. Around 40 kinds of tobacco exist. 

QUALITY: Tobacco is graded by leaf type and quality. There are five grades -
choice, fine, good, fair, and low. These are set by the tobacco's
uniformity, texture, age, oil, body, coloring,  etc.

NICOTIANA: The botanical name for tobacco after Jean Nicot who introduced
tobacco into Europe around 1560. 

RALEIGH, SIR WALTER: He popularized smoking at Queen Elizabeth's court
around the mid 16th century and was believed to be the first to smoke a
pipe in England. 

Tobago: Columbus discovered it in 1498, and according to legend, named it
after the shape of a Carib pipe smoked on the island.

FLAKE CUT:

Basic blending tobaccos:

VIRGINIA - red / black / lemon / orange / orange-red
The mildest of all blending tobaccos has the highest natural sugar content.
Used in virtually all blends as it is a good burner and aids in lighting.
It imparts a light sweet taste when used in moderation

BRIGHT  - From the Carolinas
BURLEY  - "white Burley" - a natural tobacco taste with a soft character
that will never "bite."

CAVENDISH - Cavendish is a process of curing and a method of cutting
tobacco leaf; the term does not refer to a tobacco, but a type of
manufacturing process. The processing and the cut are used to bring out the
natural sweet taste that is a characteristic of Virginia tobacco. This
process will create a tobacco very light in taste, quite mild and easy to
pack. Black - Traditional Navy Cavendish, aged naturally with dark
Jamaican rum .

"Taste" tobaccos:
PERIQUE - From Louisiana
Havana  - From Cuba
Yenidji -

Oriental "spice" tobaccos:

LATAKIA - From Syria/Cyprus (richly smoked and fermented)
Latakia was "discovered" when a bumper crop resulted in surplus, and the
excess tobacco was stored in the rafters.  The  village farmers
traditionally used camel dung (or other dung, I suspect) as a source  of
fuel, and the smoke cured tobacco was revealed the following season.
Today, Latakia is smoked over a smoldering fire of aromatic herbs.  The 
camel no longer has to process the herbs first!

DUBEC   - From turkey
XANTHI  - From Macedonia
KOMOTINI- From Macedonia
DRAMA   - From Macedonia
SERRES  - From Macedonia
SAMSUN  - From the southern coast of the black seas
IZMIR   - From Western Turkey


Cigars

CIGAR: The Mayans are believed to be the first to put a cigar on the
pedestal it deserves. German philologists translated the Myan noun "Zik"
for tobacco or smoke, and "zikar" the verb form. Thus the word "cigar"
evolved and was recognized in many ancient drawings and carvings. A Myan
carving dated circa 300A.D. depicts a long tubular roll of tobacco in the
mount of an obviously happy man.

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #130 - February 11, 1994

  Steve, 

  After a four state search, I was finally able to find 
  La Gloria Cubanas at Smokers' Gallery in Ft. Lauderdale Fla.
  I bought the last two complete boxes he had in stock after (double
  coronas) which the owner said that he wouldn't receive new stock for 
  several weeks because of demand. Lucky me.

  They are of excellent quality and taste, and the price ($1.60 each) 
  made the search well worthwhile.  Nothing quite like sitting by the 
  pool and smoldering a good cigar (especially during the week that the 
  Eastern US was hit by the worst winter weather in 50 years :))

  There have been a lot of questions about humidor systems. I use one 
  that might be of interest for those that want to store a larger number 
  of cigars.  I bought a five gallon aquarium with cover at a garage sale 
  for $20, and a thermometer/hygrometer at a hardware store for $10. 
  I keep the cigars in the original cedar box (or you can buy them for 
  about a dollar at a tobacconist). 
  
  With a plastic tumbler and a sponge as a source of humidity I have been 
  able to maintain it at 65F and 60% R.H. by adjusting the sliding lid 
  slightly.  A ten gallon (or greater) aquarium would accomodate the boxes 
  better, but (like a true Ham operator),  I used what was on hand.  
  Otherwise, this system is terrific. 

  73,
  Mark K.

[ Tnx for the notes! Hope your humidor is working swimmingly :-) -S. ]

Steve, I'll be traveling around Europe this summer (after a grueling 5 years
of university) and I was wondering if there are any countries where I just
simply "have to" pick up a pipe.  I figure Denmark is a good bet.  Any other
suggestions?

Also, I have really enjoyed the reviews of different pipe tobaccos.
Could the experienced guys out there maybe ramble a little more about
different generic types (like cavendish) and the flavours associated
with them (mild, aromatic, fruity, etc).  This would be useful for us
beginners.

Thanks.

Dave.

[ Denmark would be a good bet. Ireland too, for the Petersons. Maybe
France (Butz-Choquin and I believe GBD), England (Dunhill), and Italy
(too many to mention).  -S. ]

Subject: Nothin Much

I've been subscribed to the digest for quite some time now, but this is
the first time I've written.  I've got a few questions for everyone. 
First, has anyone ever heard of fanto leaf?  I believe it's from Jamaica. 
The only use I have ever heard for it has been to roll cannabis with it (
which is what I smoke when I don't smoke Tobacco)  So has anyone ever seen
a cigar wrapped in it? Second I have a pipe that I found in my basement
(which is strange because no one in my family smokes a pipe), and it is
carved in the shape of a bison head, complete with horns that go into his
head.  Does anyone know who made this pipe, or ever seen one?  Also, to
everyone in New York, as well as everyone else, I went to the Rennaisance
Fair in Oswego Last summer and there was a pipe carver there who made
Fantastic meerschaums and calumets.  Once I find the address, I'll post
it. All you need to do to get a catalog is to send a post card.  Is there
any way to get briar to carve my own pipes?  I've heard about using
mountain Laurel root, but I'd feel bad for taking the roots because its a
beautiful plant.  Are there any other woods that are good to carve? 
Finally, My cigar of choice is a 45 ring Montesino Numero Uno with a
Maduro Wrapper.  Does anyone have any suggestions for a good cigar along
those lines ( namely below 2 bucks and a real good smoke).  Well I'd
appreciate any input, so so long and happy smoking.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   "To smoke or not to smoke, what a stupid question." 

   				-From High Times Magazine's Hemp 100

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[ I think I saw the bison pipe as an offer from Amphora, once upon a
time. See Martin's letter above re exotic wood. 

BTW, regarding alternative smoking materials, I can't really say
anything about whose hands it may eventually end up in.  Proceed with
caution. 

Or do like Our Beloved President and don't inhale :-) -S. ]

Subject: Pipes Digest

Steve Masticola:

I subscribed to the Pipes mailgroup last month.  You sent me the intro
package which included digest #126, dated January 14, 1994.  I haven't
received anything since then. I guess I don't know how often the
digests are sent out, but I fear that something may have happened so
I'm not getting the mailings.

I have two addresses here at FSU, 

	??????@??????.????.???.???	(which is forwarded to the following:)

	???????@???.???.???


On a different note, I am very much a newcomer to pipes and tobacco.
I would be greatly interested in any information you might offer
suited for someone in this situation.  For the purposes of sparing
myself the embarassment, I won't go into detail at exactly how
ignorant I am; let's just say that I come from a long line of
non-smokers but just could not resist the appeal of pipe smoking.

Thank you for you assistance in these matters.

Sincerely,

Robert Woody

Anyway, I have a passion about history.  I think it's extremely important
and has to be preserved, especially nowadays when so many revisionists
want to re-write history to support their own beliefs.  As George

I'm new to this list, so I apologize if this has been discussed before.

Has anyone ever suggested segregating Pipes Digest from a not-yet-
created Cigar Digest?

I can't be the only subscriber who is interested in one but not in
the other.

Subject: Pipes Digest

Hi, Steve!  I'm the Associate Sysop of the CompuServe Wine/Beer Forum, where
Ben Ricci is the leader of our Cigars &amp; Pipes section.  Ben told me about
your Internet Pipe Digest and suggested that we consider subscribing and
sharing some of your mailing list's discussion across the
CompuServe/Internet gateway.
 
Because Ben doesn't have direct Internet access and has to pay long-distance
charges to reach CompuServe, he's asked if I'd mind being the forum's
contact point by taking a subscription to my mailbox.  I'll collect the
postings, trim off the address material, ZIP them and pass them on to Ben,
who'll -- with your permission -- post conversations from them to our forum
and encourage our members to reply back to your list as well as in our own
round-table discussion area.
 
Although I'm not a smoker (used to be, smoked my last cigarette on St.
Patrick's Day 1974 and don't dast risk a seegar or pipe for fear I'll fall
off the nicotine wagon), I've been very interested in the tobacco
discussions on our forum, and can see clear connections between serious pipe
and tobacco appreciation and wine appreciation, so this topic fits right in
to our area of interest.
 
Assuming your approval, I'll look forward to reading your digest and sharing
it with our members online.
 
Thanks!
 
Robin Garr
Associate Sysop, CompuServe Wine/Beer Forum

Subject: Re:  Pipes Digest

Steve, thanks for the info on pipes.  Looking at its length, I know Ben's
going to appreciate getting a compressed copy! &lt;grin&gt;
 
To answer your question, I don't know how familiar you are with the way
CompuServe forums operate, but you could say that our forum is more like a
BBS system than a mailing list.  Members post messages on the public board,
and other members can read them and post replies, all of which are open for
reading and comment by all comers.  This feature is quite busy and
fast-moving, and messages have a "shelf life" of only a few days before they
scroll off.  We also have "libraries," which contain longer files of general
information, available to members by keyword search.  This is where I expect
we'd plan to cross-post the Pipe Digest, in an area normally habituated only
by smokers and serious fanciers of fine tobacco. We also have live online
conferences at scheduled times (usually Wednesday evenings) when members can
gather in real-time and communicate directly via their keyboards.
 
We DON'T, however, have a mailing-list type facility. We don't send material
out by mail, but make it available on CompuServe's mainframes where users
can log on, read it, and post replies if they wish.  I guess a moderated
Usenet newsgroup is the closest 'net analogy.
 
The forum is moderated in that we have a staff of managers (sysops like me
and "section leaders" like Ben) who try to maintain information in the forum
in clear, easy-to-access form and keep things organized.
 
To be quite frank, we have NOT found "flaming" or harassment to be a
problem. CompuServe is not inexpensive -- in fact, jokers online refer to it
as "Compu$erve" -- and while Usenet by its nature hosts a large number of
college students and young folks, CompuServe's published demographics are a
bit more mature.  By its nature, our forum attracts adults, and the general
tone of the place is one of shared interest in a common hobby.  Even though
neither Jim Kronman (my sysop partner) or I are smokers now, we've
established a firm principle that the purpose of our Cigars &amp; Pipes section
is for people who enjoy fine tobacco to have a welcoming place to discuss
that hobby online.  We haven't had an infestation of anti-terbackky folks to
this point; if we did, I expect we'd probably all enjoy the debate for a
little while but would begin to self-censor it if things got repetitive or
tiresome.  And if necessary, the sysops would take the necessary steps if it
devolved into harassment.
 
These are just random thoughts, actually, spurred by your comments, about a
problem that hasn't happened and that we hope won't happen. I hope I haven't
bored you with a long reply, but I wanted to be as candid as possible in
responding to your reasonable concern.
 
We'll look forward to reading your digest!

Subject: Digest 127: Hookahs

&gt; HOOKAH: Also known as a WATER-PIPE. 

occasionally hubbly-bubbly, but that may be restricted to US expatriates.

&gt; Many styles of hookah
&gt; exist including those with multiple mouth pieces so that several may enjoy
&gt; the hashish simultaneously.

Hookahs are Turkish only by grace of history, since what used to be Turkey
used to own most of the middle east.

The implication that hookahs are used only for hashish is ethnocentric.
In most of that area, one is as likely to sit in a sidewalk cafe and
"drink smoke" from a rented hookah as one is to sip coffee. 

And a possible interesting addendum to this topic in the FAQ:

The tobacco used in the hookah is usually dried whole leaf, soaked and
crumbled, or canned, mixed with various herbs and flavors. The very moist
tobacco is heaped into the bowl and covered with a small charcoal fire.

(Very convenient, BTW, for staying lit through a long afternoon of quiet
philosophical hammocking. The whole leaf I have burns for _hours_. I haven't
gotten the Indian herbal blend to work yet.) 

Fume quietly,

Martin

From: ?????@??????.??? (Richard E. Byer)
Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #131 - February 18, 1994

&gt; From: "William H. Magill" &lt;??????@????.?????.???&gt;
&gt; &gt;   Someone on the list wrote that he tends to have bad experiences with
&gt; &gt;   "real cigars" and cites as an example the Romeo Y Julieta a friend
&gt; &gt;   brought back from England.
&gt; &gt;   Look, Cubans, general, and that cigar in particular, are much stronger
&gt; &gt;   than your average Dominican or Jamaican cigar.  And, in my view, Romeo Y
&gt; &gt;   Julietas are the most poorly made modern Cuban cigars.  Try some good
&gt; &gt;   Dominicans before you reject the good ones categorically.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; This comment is not quite complete.
&gt; 
&gt; ANY tobacco product, especially cigars, from the "continent" is STRONGER
&gt; than the "American" version.  This follows the general American proclivity
&gt; for "watered-down" versions of the real thing - like beer. It turns out
&gt; that today not only do American breweries churn out barrels of Lager
&gt; instead of Ale, but that Lager is only 4.0%! When I was in the military in
&gt; the late 60's, 3.2% beer was served at the PX and referred to as "Panther
&gt; P..." 

Not to be argumentative, but I think this response deserves some elaboration.
Most quality cigars imported legally into the US today com from either 
the Dominican Republic or Honduras. A few may still come from other 
Carribean Islands, such as Jamaica, and a few come from Nicauragua, 
Mexico and Brazil.  Focussing on Honduras, the Dominican Republic, and 
Cuba, generally, the Honduran cigars tend to be stronger than the 
Dominicans, and the Cubans tend to be stronger than the Honduran.  There 
are exceptions.  For example, La Fontanas (from Hondura) tend to be 
rather mild and sweet.  Contrast the Honuran Punch cigars (not to be
confused with the Cuban Punch cigars), which are quite strong (other than 
the vintage Puch cigars, which are not so strong.

&gt; In the cigar world there is a style called EMS or European Market Selection.

I always thought that the EMS stood for "English Market Selection" and 
was more a medium brown.

[snip]
&gt; 
&gt; And as for Romeo Y Juleita being a Cuban? I have a brochure from the
&gt; company on the occasion of their re-introduction to the American Market
&gt; after a 20 year absence (circa 1982). They characterize themselves:
&gt; 
&gt; "Romeo Y Julieta is an old and respected name in the cigar industry. We
&gt; believe it to be the last of the really famous Cuban brands to re-enter the
&gt; American Market." They go on to describe their quest to find new tobacco
&gt; sources until, "We found the two bends that would more than fulfill the
&gt; desires of the most discriminating of cigar smokers world-wide."
&gt; Cameroon Deluxe from the Dominican Republic and "All Cuban Seed" from
&gt; Honduras. The implication is clear from their brochure that they have moved
&gt; all of their production from Cuba to these two locations - "Cuban-born
&gt; supervision," "Cuban-born rollers," "Cuban seed," expatriate Cuban cigar
&gt; experts," etc.

That may be the implication, but it is my understanding that that isn't 
quite right.  Most of the popular cigar brands have at least two alleged 
owners, the Cuban government and the growers who left Cuba with their 
seeds to set up shop elsewhere in the Carribean.  Hence there Romeo Y 
Julietas made in Cuba (which, as I said before, are very mediocre cigars) 
and, recently, RYJs from the Dominican Republic, which aren't bad.
Similarly, one can get Partagas made in the Dominican Republic and 
Partagas made in Cubas.  These are not made by the same folks.  the same 
is true with Cuban and Honduran Punch cigars.

On the other hand, Davidoff used to buy tobacco from Cuban, but recently 
stopped.  Their Davidoff line is now exclusively Dominican, and their 
Zeno line is Honduran.

For a truly delightful Cuban cigar, if you have access to them, try a 
Cohiba Robusto.
&gt; 
&gt; DOTTLE: Unburned tobacco left in the heel of a pipe.

Thanks, I didn't even know there was a name for it!
&gt; 
&gt; LATAKIA - From Syria/Cyprus (richly smoked and fermented)
&gt; Latakia was "discovered" when a bumper crop resulted in surplus, and the
&gt; excess tobacco was stored in the rafters.  The  village farmers
&gt; traditionally used camel dung (or other dung, I suspect) as a source  of
&gt; fuel, and the smoke cured tobacco was revealed the following season.
&gt; Today, Latakia is smoked over a smoldering fire of aromatic herbs.  The 
&gt; camel no longer has to process the herbs first!

Another illusion shattered, as I sit here smoking a rather pleasant 
Latakia blend &lt;VBSEG&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; From: ????????@??????????.???????.?????????.??
&gt; 
&gt; Steve, I'll be traveling around Europe this summer (after a grueling 5 years
&gt; of university) and I was wondering if there are any countries where I just
&gt; simply "have to" pick up a pipe.  I figure Denmark is a good bet.  Any other
&gt; suggestions?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I have really enjoyed the reviews of different pipe tobaccos.
&gt; Could the experienced guys out there maybe ramble a little more about
&gt; different generic types (like cavendish) and the flavours associated
&gt; with them (mild, aromatic, fruity, etc).  This would be useful for us
&gt; beginners.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; Dave.
&gt; 
&gt; [ Denmark would be a good bet. Ireland too, for the Petersons. Maybe
&gt; France (Butz-Choquin and I believe GBD), England (Dunhill), and Italy
&gt; (too many to mention).  -S. ]
&gt; 

The best European deal I ever saw was a a Dunhill #3202 style pipe for 
about 80 pounds in a pipe shop in Bath, England.  This was when the pound 
was equal to about $1.50.  I recently priced the same pipe at Georgetown 
Tobacco at $375.

Subject: Wooden Shoes and all that...

WOW!  Quite a collection of info to glean from Digest #130!  I'm almost out
the door to pick up a Meerschaum and desert the cigars for good, but I'll
have to think about it over a Fuente.

On to other things, I have to be especially thankful for the recent warming
trend here in the north country.  I'm sure I'm not alone in breathing a sigh
of relief for the relief, but I've always had a particular fondness for
enjoying a cigar and taking an idle walk around.  I found the campus here to
be a great trip.  But, this activity is totally beyond my metal when the
temps are toying with negative numbers.  At one point I toyed with the idea
of clipping cigars into thirds and taking very fast walks, but that fever
passed thankfully.  So, Mother Nature's recent respite from winter has me
feeling like I've got an old friend back. (warm fuzzy feeling comes over
those assembled)

Lastly, I've just racked off a batch of a Dutch Lager that SHOULD be quite
nice.  I sampled some at a brew store and tried to recreate the recipe.  And,
so, to round out the "international thing" I'm looking for some suggestions
on some nice Dutch cigars to complement.  The beer is heavily hopped and will
be on the bitter side, not as sharp a stout, but I'm trying for the "Heineken
thing".  So if anyone is relaxing with a nice "Heinie" (and the latest issue
of the Newslett), and any thoughts of a proper cigar pop into your head,
write 'em down.  Have a cold one for me, too.

Steve,
  I'm not an enthusiast, but have a Cherokee friend who ekes out a bare 
existance recreating native artifacts, including a wide variety of pipes, 
using natural materials...
  He does everything from raccoon paw medicine bags to custom-carved 
ceremonial pipes.
  Not much of a businessman, though.
  He travels the country, selling to museum gift shops, selling at pow 
wows, etc.
  I'm trying to get a perspective for how this business is conducted and 
help him identify resources and marketing methods.

Subject: Cigar Humidor Wanted

Thanks for the info.  I smoke cigars and pipes.  I primarily smoke Uppman 
and Macunudo cigars. Mostly purchase mail order from NY except when I go to 
Europe (once or twice a year) then I get Cuban versions of Uppmans.  I 
smoke mostly Dunhill pipes straight and bent (mostly older ones 1940's 
-70's). I find them in antique stores, flea markets etc. Most interesting 
ones have the real ivory "dot" and banded in silver or gold. I get my 
tobbacco from The Carmel Pipe Shop  on Delores Street in Carmel, CA.  They 
also do mail-order.  I'm 36 years old and work at 3Com in management 
training.  I'd like to be sent some of your earlier newsletters including 
#114,116,118.  Thanks, steve

Help from the newsletter:
I am looking to buy a used cigar humidor in good to excellent condition 
with a hygrometer.  Should hold only about 35-50 cigars.  I don't want a 
real expensive one (less than $100 USED). 

The other item I'm looking for used is a Dunhill "theatere pipe."  It's 
black and the bowl is slightly flattened to slip into a suit jacket pocket. 
Thanks steve,  e-mail or 408-764-5976.

[ Newsletters sent. Good luck on your search! -S. ]

Subject: Pipes Comment

&gt;If the tobacco in my pouch starts to feel a little
&gt;dry, I sprinkle a few of drops of water directly onto
&gt;the tobacco, then mix it up. This seems to keep the
&gt;tobacco  properly moist and doesn't seem to damage it.

&gt;????@???.???

&gt;[ We do this too, sometimes, but find it difficult to control the
&gt;humidity of the tobacco. Saturating it kills it, too. Any advice on
&gt;this? -S. ]
				   
My Dad gave me the tip of inserting a piece of fresh orange rind into the 
tobbacco pouch to keep the tobacco moist without saturating or imparting a 
strong flavor. sw

[ But be careful, this can cause mold... -S. ]

Subject: Heartbreak Pipe

I haven't been to the States in quite a while.  Which means that I
haven't been able to buy cheap Amerikanski tobacco in quite a while,
either.  Mind you, since the government realised that it was either
going to have to lower tobacco taxes or start shooting Indians; the
excise situation will have improved a bit.

So there I was in Winston and Holmes in Yorkville, picking up a couple
of hundred grammes of Latakia-heavy tobacco (why do people on this
group use the term "tobak"? Is it Danish or something?), and I was
looking at the pipes on the wall.  And a salesman smells my desire to
buy a pipe from across the room.  And he's showing me some of their
reasonable standby stuff.  And I tell him that it is all very nice,
but I never buy sandblasts; and I like a medium-sized bowl with a
dead-straight vertical grain running to an eyeball on the heel.

Well, he says, have you ever looked at an Italian pipe?

No, says I, I haven't.

So he opens up a case and starts taking out these beautiful
blond-coloured Costello pipes.  Every one has a dead-straight vertical
grain.  Every one feels light as ... well, light as a Stanwell.  And
there she was ... blonde, delicately curved, silver military shank,
with a sexy vertical oval shape that made my heart stop.

You have sold me a pipe, sir, says I.

Excellent, sir, says the salesman.  That will be nine hundred
ninety-eight dollars plus GST and PST (which, incidentally, would add
another hundred and fifty dollars).

Well, I uttered a groan of heartfelt pain.  There she was, right in
front of me; and there I was facing the prospect of blowing my then
strong cash position by spending my rent and car-payment money on this
gorgeous Italian blonde.

You have broken my heart, says I to the salesman.  Then I walked over
to the proprietor so that he could overcharge me for my tobacco; and
told him that he should be ashamed of his employee; who was using the
charms of his wares to tempt upright young men into inappropriate
behaviour.

Oh, but it was hard to leave the shop, and hard to walk home that day.  

Remember this, and don't let it happen to you!

Cheers,

Aryk Nusbacher

[ Know how it feels, Aryk - BTW, I think I picked up the term "tobak"
from _The Pipe Smoker's Ephemeris._ And I think it is Danish, but am
not sure -- if I remember correctly, French is tabac, and German is
tabak. -S. ]

Subject: Re: Humidors: Repost

Thanks for the newsletter from the pipes group. I found it
interesting and informative and will look forward to it.  Now, I
have a question for the group which, perhaps, you can help  me
with.

I am embarassed to have to admit it, but I live in a country where
a conspiracy of health bigots and tax gougers has made the price of
tobacco outrageous.  Recently, however, as you may know, the
Canadian smoker, by resorting to widescale smuggling (amazing and
encouraging!), has forced the government to reduce taxes on
cigarettes, and several of the provinces have followed suit.  Mine
(Manitoba) has not.  Hence, in Ontario, the price of cigarets is
half (23/carton) what we pay here (approx 45/carton).  If I were a
cigarette smoker, I would have several means of availing myself of
these greatly reduced prices. Alas, I smoke pipes.

What I need to know, then, is this:

     First, have pipe tobacco prices dropped accordingly in the
Provinces which have accepted the reduced cigaret taxes; and,

     Second, can someone from Ontario/Quebec/another province
supply me with the names and addresses of dealers or individuals
from whom I can order my pipe tobacco supplies?

I would very much appreciate a quick response to this and thank you
in advance for any help you can provide.  

Thanks,
Walt Stein

[ Perhaps someone who wants to trade Cu-er-Canadian cigars for US
pipes and terbacky could help Walt? -S. ]

Subject: Laszlo steps out of the shadows!

Salve', all!

	Well, it occurs to me that I've yet to actually introduce
myself here, which is curious considering I've become something of
a deferred-to expert.  Yes, I am *the* Laszlo, who maintains the
infamous Smokelist of luxury cigarets.  I've been around since the
ill-fated rec.tobacco RFD, and have since been active in alt.smokers.
I updated the Smokelist a couple weeks ago, adding flavour comments
and including the finds I unearthed over Xmas at the legendary Paul's
Pipe Shop in Flint, MI.  The big guy himself was absent, but a darling
little old lady took us upstairs to see the "museum" and show us around.
They had the actual pipes used by every winner since the late 1940s in
their annual pipe-smoking contest!

	In this contest, each entrant gets a small, measured quantity
of tobacco (3 grams?  About a tablespoonful, anyway) and two matches.
The second match is taken away if you don't use it to relight within
the first minute.  The object is to keep it lit for as long as possible;
the record is just over *two*hours*!  Egad.

	They also had all manner of strange and kitschy lighters,
promotional items, strange pipe designs through the years (one had
a black plastic cage holding a quartz-glass bowl--very '40s/'50s
looking), and a few displays of old, defunct brands of cigarets.
One had even been offered as a diet aid (called "Trim-A-Way" or
something, with a '50s stylized hourglass-figure silhouette)!

	Then, back downstairs to the cool, clammy humidor, where
they kept all their cigars *and* import/luxury cigarets.  These
cigarets could be 10 years old, and still fresh!  Every nook and
cranny had something bizarre or quaint to offer.  My "buy" stack
reached higher and higher.  I wound up spending *$50* on packs
of cigarets!

	I do smoke a pipe very rarely, but quality cigarets are
my forte', only smoking 1-5 cigarets per day.  I've got a whole
rationale for why cigarets, but I'll save that for another time,
another Digest.  I bought a Fuente 8-5-8 Maduro the other day,
as my first "real" cigar, and while it was *nice*, it didn't make
me a cigar "true-believer" as I'd half-expected, judging from
comments here. %-}  For the money ($2.25), I could've had a couple
weeks' worth of smoking satisfaction from a pouch of rolling tobacco.
Ah well, to each his own...

Subject: Separate groups

It's getting about time to try the rec.tobacco group again, isn't
it.  I mean, with the amount of participation in this newsletter
(and a darn GOOD newsletter, too), rather than direct the frag-
mentation of it, how about giving another shot at a newsgroup?

While I don't smoke a pipe, I still enjoy some of the talk about
it.  And I do appreciate the hospitality of the pipe smokers for
having so much cigar talk.  Maybe the case is stronger now for
rec.tobacco.pipe, rec.tobacco.cigar, and rec.tobacco.loose.  Or
just plain rec.tobacco?

[ Work has gotten intense here, so I don't know how much time I'll
have to charge forth with another newsgroup proposal. Anyone want to
volunteer to spearhead the effort, when we can propose it again in
April? This time, I'd probably go for rec.misc.tobacco, to placate the
namespace purists -- or at least to deprive the antismokers of an
excuse to vote it down. -S. ]

&gt;
&gt;   Steve,
&gt;     I'm not an enthusiast, but have a Cherokee friend who ekes out a bare 
&gt;   existence recreating native artifacts, including a wide variety of pipes, 
&gt;   using natural materials...
&gt;     He does everything from raccoon paw medicine bags to custom-carved 
&gt;   ceremonial pipes.
&gt;     Not much of a businessman, though.
&gt;     He travels the country, selling to museum gift shops, selling at pow 
&gt;   wows, etc.
&gt;     I'm trying to get a perspective for how this business is conducted and 
&gt;   help him identify resources and marketing methods.
&gt;
&gt;   [ Maybe check out sales through the magazines? Sierra, Utne Reader,
&gt;   etc. might be a good place for that sort of thing. -S. ]
&gt;
Steve, Don't know if you want to put this in the digest, but...

I would say that the trick would be to join/affiliate with  a "guild."

I don't know the geographical area of your friend but here in the east
there are a number of "Craft Guilds." Several very strong ones in North
Carolina and Pennsylvania that I know of.

Basically, these are organizations of "craft persons" - whatever that
means. For example, my cousin makes plaster "models" of "famous" buildings,
paints them and sells them. They are "artistic" renderings of say,
Independence Hall. The guild runs a physical shop as well as a number
of "juried" events year long. A juried crafts show is where participation
is permitted only to people who are designated "craftsman" - essentially
to differentiate them from "flee market quality" stuff. Consequently the
goods produced - and the are everything from corn-husk dolls to fancy
cabinetry - command (potentially) higher prices than things simply sold
as "trinkets." Additionally, at on of these shows, the Artist pays a flat
fee to participate (varies depending on the show) and sells directly to the
public for whatever they want. The guild also has a number of "outlets"
(non affiliated commercial contacts) where a particular shop is looking for
a particular kind of goods. The guild acts as a clearing house putting the
artist in contact with stores looking for their kind of goods.

Generally speaking, however, this is a VERY hard way to make a living.
My cousin would put 5-10 hours into painting a house only to sell it for
$25 bucks! Pretty poor hourly wages WITHOUT counting materials costs.

The real problem is that except for the very top tier craftspeople, nobody
is willing to pay big bucks for something "hand made."

If you succeed in making a "gallery" contact - that can change. There the
gallery does the merchandising and pricing for you. The downside is that
you typically sell to the gallery low and they sell it high. Until they
sell "lots" and your name becomes known enough to create/attract a
following who will pay more money directly to you - it's pretty rough.

One other venue for your friend to explore - Scottish Highland games.
Virtually all of the "games" have a vendor area where almost anything can
be found, albite with a Celtic flavor. There are a couple of carvers and
sculptors who frequent many of the games. There are games held virtually
every weekend someplace in the US. 

One particular tie of interest here. One of the US Indian tribes (I don't
know which one) has a "license" from the Federal Government to sell,
especially, Eagle Feathers. A clan chief is entitled to wear one, two or
three feathers according to rank. This is a rather limited market, but
whenever one of those who are "Chief of the Name" is the guest of honor
at one of the games, his clansmen will often make a presentation to him (or
her) accordingly as they do wear out (get broken, mashed in travel, etc)
and are apparently NOT available in the UK!

The second related area is the "medicine bag" or as we call them "sporin."
In the Kilt "uniform" this is a large (typically about 8x8x2 inch bag worn
on a chain around the waist - which carries not only Scotch (for medicinal
purposes) but keys, matches, pocket knives, wallets, etc. - ie a handbag
or purse, if you will.

The "neat" sporins are animal head pelts. The head forms the flap which
hinges over the opening at the top. I happen to have one made of a muskrat.
A friend of mine has one made from a red fox - a gorgeous accouterment!

One final area... there is a magazine "Tantra."  Which despite its Taoist 
origins has made sizeable "New Age" inroads. (If you know Tantra, you can
guess why.) At any rate, the latest issue (it's a quarterly) has a number of
ads in it for spirit drums, ceremonial feather fans and the like.

&gt;
&gt;  The other item I'm looking for used is a Dunhill "theatere pipe."  It's 
&gt;  black and the bowl is slightly flattened to slip into a suit jacket pocket. 

You can't have mine.... 

I have had a Comway "vest pocket pipe" for about 30 years now. It is more
than "slightly flattened!" The pipe is about 1" wide by 2" long and 2 1/2"
high with the stem "folded back. " The stem attaches "virtically" and when
"unfolded" looks like a "bent." Rotating the stem 180 degrees allows one
to, quite literally,  slide it into one's vest pocket. The stem is only
as long as the bowl is wide.

                          "========    
                +-------+ "
                |       | "
                |       +---+
                |           |
                +-----------+

It has a surprisingly large bowl (deep) and still smokes quite well.

Subject: cigar digest

Hello Steve,

I have no objection against a seperate cigar digest, but I will
also like to continue the pipe digest. It is just interesting
for me to read both things (And I do not want to miss the
stories of both Bill's!).

With regard to humidors: The Dutch Cigar Association
"Coupe-cigares" also did some investigating with regard to
humidors. They found out that the best humidity to preserve
cigars (European and cuban cigars) can be gained by using water
with salt. So not plain water. In this way the humidaity is at
the right level. Remeber the water must be satuarated with salt.

All the best,

Victor

[ Don't understand why the salt helps... in any case, there've been no
takers yet to start the hypothetical cigars-only group. -S. ]

&gt;And, first off, we have a couple of administrative questions that I'd
&gt;like your opinions on -- whether to create a cigars-only group, and
&gt;whether to gateway the list to the Pipes &amp; Cigars area of the
&gt;Wine/Beer Forum on CompuServe. The relevant letters follow; enjoy!
&gt;[ I replied to Robin, expressing some concerns about member privacy
&gt;and the possibility of flame wars. He replied: ]

Although I much prefer pipes to cigars, I enjoy the extra information
about cigars once in a while.  If I don't have time, I just push the
PageDown button and it disappears.  I handle "flaming" in much the
same manner (unless it's truly deserved).  While I admit keeping the
two subjects together in one digest decreases the signal to noise
ratio for both groups, I'd probably join both groups if they were to
separate.  As far as CompuServe posting goes, the more the merrier.
Other groups (such as the homebrewers) run a mailing group which
posts to a UseNet news group.  There is some commonality, but mostly
it gives me more information.  That's why I join a group like this in
the first place, to share ideas, opinions, and resources.

&gt;Subject: Wooden Shoes and all that...
&gt;
&gt;WOW!  Quite a collection of info to glean from Digest #130!  I'm almost out
&gt;the door to pick up a Meerschaum and desert the cigars for good, but I'll
&gt;have to think about it over a Fuente.
&gt;
&gt;Lastly, I've just racked off a batch of a Dutch Lager that SHOULD be quite
&gt;nice.  I sampled some at a brew store and tried to recreate the recipe.  And,
&gt;so, to round out the "international thing" I'm looking for some suggestions
&gt;on some nice Dutch cigars to complement.  The beer is heavily hopped and will
&gt;be on the bitter side, not as sharp a stout, but I'm trying for the "Heineken
&gt;thing".

I hope you decided on the meershaum even though a Dutch Freehand
might be a better ethnic pairing.  Perhaps an English blend so the
Latakia will stand up to the hops.  How dark is this beer?  The stout
only accomidates the heavy hopping because it is such a heavy style.
If you've made a lager with only 4-6 IBU's, maybe a Virginia would be
better to round out the flavor.  My personal favorite is a stout made
with lots of Black Patent malt and a Roasted Cavendish.

Steve: As a pipe smoker AND a cigar smoker I'd object to having the NL split
into two. Bandwidth accessibility is getting precious and I don't want to be
forced to choose. As a Compu$serve section leader in a couple of forums I
certainly have no objection to the NL being shared on the wine/beer forum
there. Of course you realize that you'll be making more money for the Wizops
on that forum by increasing forum traffic.
 
Re the great moisturizing debate: Here's the way I was taught a couple of
hundred years ago. Empty your pouch, container etc. into a mixing bowl. Take
a spray bottle and gently spray the _top_ of the pile of tobacco. Mix
thoroughly with your hands. Blot tobacco with paper towels and replace in
pouch. Works fine without adding flavor the way slices of apple/orange/etc.
do. BTW I keep my tobacco in a ceramic container from Gevalia designed to
hold coffee. Has an airtight seal; works fine. Gevalia gave the container
away as a premium for buying two one-lb. samples of their coffee.

ever, in the sense of rejecting cigar articles from the Pipes Digest

thought that someone would like to start up an offshoot, specialty
list for cigars only. -S. ]

Subject: The continuing saga...

Well, I went to the Tinder Box in Rockville, and quickly got to the bottom of
the little tiny holes in my pipe. Most of them look like pinpricks, but some
seem to be growing larger along the grain. (See where this is going yet,
Watson?) Well, the guy at the shop informed me of my basic problem: my pipe is
not made of briar. Those little holes are some characteristic of whatever
wood(s) my "composition" pipe is made of, and a signal that sooner or later,
I'm going to have one busted pipe. Oh well, the thing cost me less than 15
bucks, and now I know I like pipe smoking well enough to get a good one. Does
anyone know if there's a way to save this thing other than retire it
completely? Being that it's my first pipe and all, I'd like not to lose it.

Which brings up another question: why are there no Tinder Boxes in the Resource
Guide? Is it just a prejudice against chains? Which is OK with me; I try to
support the small businessman, and I know the large business is easy enough to
find in the Yellow Pages. Just wondering. It is kind of interesting to note,
though, that the one in White Flint Mall in Rockville, MD, is the _only_
smoking area in the mall. It's in their lease that the right to smoke in the
tobacconist's shop shall not be abridged. Let's hear it for the crafty
entrepreneur!

As for separating cigars into their own list, I'd really prefer only to
subscribe to one digest. I'm not discouraging anyone from starting their own
group; I'm just appealing that no smoker of good will ever be run out of this
group. Hey, a good blend is the secret to good smoking!

OK, that was corny enough to make me shut up. See ya in the smoking lounge...

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #132 - February 25, 1994

Steve:
I am new to the newsgroup (#131 was my first issue). I really
did enjoy the pipe digest and found it a refreshing change from some
of the "flame fests" that you see on alt.smokers. Regarding the
suggested separate cigars-only newsgroup, it seems it would be
a sound idea. As a "pipe only" smoker, I know little about cigars
and I am sure that there are many cigar smokers out there that have
little interest in pipes. In any case, that's my 0.02 cents worth.
By the way, can anyone suggest a decent tobacco shop in northwest
NJ? I lived in the DC area for many years and really miss G'town
tobacco on M St. Maybe one of the newsgroup subscribers can suggest
a comparable shop in my locale. Keep up the good work.
W.E.Patterson

[ Thanks, and welcome, William! Don't know about northwest NJ, but
there are good ones in Somerville and the Princeton area. -S. ]

Subject: PipeWorks &amp; Wilke closing &amp;c.

I have been reading and enjoying the digest long enough; it's time I
contributed. First, some comments on questions from #132.

As a pipe smoker only, I generally skip over the cigar discussions in the
digest. If there is enough interest, a separate digest might be in order for
cigar smokers. (I don't object to cigars, I just don't have any interest in
them).

As far as archiving on CIS, I see no harm in it; you are unlikely to get any
contributions from CIS'ers, however. A number of CIS fora collect
internet-distributed mailings and news in their libraries. They are typically
used more for reference than avid reading as far as I can tell.

My other news is a mailing I just got from Pipeworks &amp; Wilke in NYC. As you
probably know, Pipeworks was originally the shop of Elliot Nachwalter, who is
a skilled pipemaker. A number of years ago he bought the Wilke pipe shop on
Madison Avenue. He continued both for a while, then closed the Madison Ave
shop, leaving only his shop on West 55th Street. The announcement I received
says that he is now closing the 55th street shop, and will do mail order
business only out of Manchester, Vermont. For the month of February, he is
running a closing sale of all merchandise in the 55th street shop. Discounts
range from 30% on his own pipes (which generally range from $50 to $1,500) to
60% on third party merchandise. In addition to his personal line and the
Wilke line, the shop specializes in high quality estate pipes. The sale is
available by telephone; you can call the shop and they will describe what is
available in your price range. If you order anything and don't like it, it is
returnable. While I will miss the shop, the sale is nice. I visited him on
Feb 28th, and I'll probably be back a couple more times before he closes.

From: ??????@?????.???????.??? (James Dollar)

Dear Steve

My name is Vance Burns and I receive hard copy of this mailing from Mr
Dollar so I asked him to post this info.

I am, by preference, a pipe smoker but I do enjoy reading about others
interest in cigars (I hold an R&amp;J as I type). Please don't separate
it. It's no trouble, and frankly, there isn't enough on pipes to speak
of. You need the cigar folks to fill it up.

To help out a little:

I enjoy pipes of all brands and english style tobaccos. But after
acquiring my umpteenth pipe I discovered tobacco books. Already a book
buyer, I found tobacco related material added much pleasure to my
enjoyment of the craft. I got started indirectly by my interest in
George Simenon's character Inspector Maigret. Maigret's ever present
pipe, and his meditations on it captured my interest. 50+ novels
later, and still going. 

The best book for the pipe smoker is Carl Ehwa's "The Book of Pipes
and Tobacco". Full of salient and obscure information not to mention
still photos of fine wood that are in themselves an art form. I've
ended up with three copies. If you are familiar with the McClelland
tobacco, Carl's widow, Mary, is the owner.

I recently purchased a few books from a dealer in tobacco antiquariana
and hit upon a real gem. The book is Sublime Tobacco by Compton
Mackenzie, 1957 London, 357p. Certainly gifted (the fly lists over 40
other non tobacco works by Mr. Mackenzie) it is without a doubt the
best account of tobacco history I've come across. The first 62 pages
are entitled "Prologue: My Smoking Life" and are some of the most
entertaining stories I've ever read. In the remaining pages Compton
details the record of the herb from it's beginnings to its post WWII
heyday. Throughout he rails against the British tax system, a kindred
spirit to smokers and non. He chronicles pipe, cigar, cigarette, snuff
(he made snuff interesting), and variants. Highly recommended, if you
can find it.

I shall end with a little vignette. In the early 1800's two ministers,
one a rather poor parson and the other a blue blood (I remember his
name was Thorn) where traveling together via coach. Thorn, having run
short of his own custom made smokes, requested a cigar from his poorer
companion. After a few puffs he threw it out the carriage window and
exclaimed "Anyone who would smoke a cigar that bad would steal!"

Thanks
Vance

[ Thanks for the note, Vance, and I quite agree that Ehwa's book is
worth having. -S. ]

Subject: PROFILE OF A PIPESMOKER

Dear Steve:

		Here is some basic information about me and my world of
pipes and tobacco.  My first and favorite pipe is a black sandblast Comoy
Rockroot.  It smokes excellent and gleams with beauty.  I also have 2
Petersons, which are excellent as well.  

 		As for tobacco blends, my favorite is a local blend
called "Blackberry Cordial."  The aroma is divine, and the flavor.....I
cannot begin to describe it.  My favorite tobacco shop is Cascade News and
Tobacco.  They boast the largest humidor in the Pacific Northwest, which
is pretty profound.  I also associate myself with the T. Wittacker Tobacco
shops sometimes, as well.  Another favorite blend that I enjoy (the name
varies from shop to shop) is a straight heavy vanilla black Cavedish. 
This, I think has the sweetest flavor one can find.

		I believe that just as a bride is meant for her husband so
is the pipesmoke meant for the fireplace (in which fragnant wood is burning).
Or perhaps the shady pattio on a warm summer's evening.

In pipes and tobacco, 
Daniel Octavian Romulus Tiberius Sauder U/~

A man and his pipe, who can separate?  What two things are more enjoyable
around a warm fire with man's best friend and his calabash gourd reading

From: Robert Ewart &lt;????????@????.????.???&gt;
Subject: Pipes Digest

Thanks for putting me on your mailing list.  I've found the issues very 
interesting.  I'm all in favor of someone starting a Cigars-only digest 
as I'm a pipe smoker.  I do enjoy a cigar once in a while, but I've been 
a pipe smoker since the third weekend in May 1958.  Over the years I've 
acquired a large number of pipes.  In addition to the usual briars and 
meerschaums, there's a few made of cherry wood, zebrawood, rosewood, 
olive, bubinga and a calabash.  I've had clay pipes, but I kept chewing 
off the stems.  Does anyone remember Baronite pipes?  

I've seen the humidor thread in the rec.woodworking newsgroup, but down 
here in south Florida keeping tobacco from drying out is not a problem.  
I'm more interested in making pipe racks.  I've tried my hand at carving 
pipes.  It gives you a real feel for how hard briar really is.

If you get down to south Florida, I recommend a visit to Bennington 
Tobacco.  Jim is second generation in the business and is quite 
knowledgeable about cigars and pipes.  He has a huge walk-in humidor 
stocked with all sorts of good cigars, including Davidoff.  He also has a 
large selection of pipes by Comoy, Dunhill and others.  He's put on some 
interesting shows in the store from time to time.  One of the better was 
a Floridian wood sculptor turned pipe-maker, Randy Wiley.  Randy brought 
down some roughed out pipes and was working on them as we talked.  He has 
a real feel for how to get the best out of the grain of the pipe and they 
smoke great.  

The store is located in the Royal Palm Plaza at 501 SE Mizner Blvd, Boca 
Raton, FL, 33432-6003.  The family's original store is located at 
5 Fillmore Dr/St Armands, Sarasota, FL 34236-1425.  I know you'll get a 
friendly welcome.  They also do mail order.  You should add them to your 
list.

Have you heard any rumors about a $15/pound sin tax that Clinton is 
proposing on pipe tobacco? 

Bob Ewart                             ????????@????.????.???

[ Yes, we have. But that's not the worst of it. We've also heard that
the FDA is talking about classifying nicotine as a drug.. thereby
immediately outlawing many forms of tobak. Write your congressthing --
I did! Ask me if you need a list of their names.

And if he/she makes inane arguments about children, as Senator
Lautenberg did to me, tell 'em what I wish I had. I don't want to see
any kids hurt, and wouldn't consciously do things to hurt them. But,
when they grow up, I'd want my kids to have the same freedom we've had
to make our own choices in life -- for better or for worse, like
adults. We don't need Uncle Sam to be our lifetime nanny. It's not in
his job description, anyway. -S. ]

	Dear Steve:
		 Lately, I have heard much talk about replenishing mositure
 to dryed tobacco.  I question, would it be wise or foolish to store
tobacco in a refrigerator to keep it fresh?  It seems to me that it would
be a trifle bit too cold, but I really don't know.

Long live King Briar!

tongue burn? :-) -S. ]

               			"SHE"

			   Yes, Dear,
		           I fear
                           I love another, strange to say.
                           Brunette.
                           This pet,
                           And I am with her night and day.
                           Just now,
                           I vow,
                           I pressed her fondly to my lips;
                           The kiss 
                           Was bliss
                           And thrilled me to my finger tips!
                           Don't pout!
                           She's out
                           And you are sweeter, love by far,
                           Altho'
                           By Jo!
                           "She" was an awful good cigar!

			    THE BETROTHED
			  by Rudyard Kipling

	    'You must choose between me and your cigar' -
		*Breach of Promise Case, circa* 1885.


Open the old cigar-box, get me a Cuba stout,
For things are running crossways, and Maggie and I are out.

We quarrelled about Havanas - we fought o'er a good cheroot,
And *I* know she is exacting, and she says I am a brute.

Open the old cigar-box - let me consider a space;
In the soft blue veil of the vapour musing on Maggie's face.

Maggie is pretty to look at - Maggie's a loving lass,
But the prettiest cheeks must wrinkle, the truest of loves must pass.

There's peace in a Larranaga, there's calm in a Henry Clay;
But the best cigar in an hour is finished and thrown away -

Thrown away for another as perfect and ripe and brown -
But I could not throw away Maggie for fear o' the talk o' the town!

Maggie, my wife at fifty - grey and dour and old -
With never another Maggie to purchase for love or gold!

And the light of Days that have Been the dark of the Days that Are,
And Love's torch stinking and stale, like the butt of a dead cigar -

The butt of a dead cigar you are bound to keep in you pocket -
With never a new one to light tho' it's charred and black to the socket!

Open the old cigar-box - let me consider a while.
Here is a mild Manila - there is a wifely smile.

Which is the better portion - bondage bought with a ring,
Or a harem of dusky beauties, fifty tied with a string?

Counsellors cunning and silent - comforters true and tried,
And never a one of the fifty to sneer at a rival bride?

Thought in the early morning, solace in time of woes,
Peace in the hush of the twilight, balm ere my eyelids close,

This will the fifty give me, asking nought in return,
With only a *Suttee's* passion - to do their duty and burn.

This will the fifty give me. When they are spent and dead,
Five times other fifties shall be my servants instead.

The furrows of far-off Java, the isles of the Spanish Main,
When they hear my harem is empty will send me my brides again.

I will take no heed to their raiment, nor food for their mouths withal,
So long as the gulls are nesting, so long as the showers fall.

I will scent 'em with best vanilla, with tea will I temper their hides,
And the Moor and the Mormon shall envy who read of the tale of my brides.

For Maggie has written a letter to give me my choice between
The wee Little whimpering Love and the great god Nick o'Teen.

And I have been servant of Love for barely a twelvemonth clear,
But I have been Priest of Cabanas a matter of seven year;

And the gloom of my bachelor days is flecked with the cheery light
Of stumps that I burned to Friendship and Pleasure and Work and Fight.

And I turn my eyes to the future that Maggie and I must prove,
But the only light on the marshes is the Will-o'-the-Wisp of Love.

Will it see me safe through my journey or leave me bogged in the mire?
Since a puff of tobacco can cloud it, shall I follow the fitful fire?

Open the old cigar-box - let me consider anew -
Old friends, and who is Maggie that I should abandon *you*?

A million surplus Maggies are willing to bear the yoke;
And a woman is just a woman, but a good Cigar is a Smoke.

Light me another Cuba - I hold to my first sworn vows.
If Maggie will have no rival, I'll have no Maggie for Spouse!

From: Ib Fagerlund &lt;??@?????.???.??.???&gt;
Subject: Digest article

Several people has asked, here in the Digest, or directly to me, where to
find a good pipe shop and/or places worth-a-visit in Denmark. I just put a 
small list together of the most interresting shops/museums in the Copen-
hagen area.
If you always wanted a first, danish handmade don't miss these shops while
visiting our country. The prize level of these pipes is far lower than in the
US. A true, first handmade can be purchased for around 1500-3000 kr. (220-
440 US$). Stanwell's and Georg Jensen's sell for 150-1500 kr. (22-220 US$) 
in Denmark. More expensive pipes can be found off cause, but they are rare.
If you need more detailed info, feel free to drop me a note...



Phone: (+45) 32 50 28 20
Gents Shop
Copenhagen Airport, toll free area.
2770 Kastrup
Description:	 The shop is located in the toll free shopping area of the
Copenhagen Airport (only accessible if you arrive/leave on international
flights). A good choice of danish handmades, Dunhill's, Peterson's,

Storm P. Museum
Frederiksberg Runddel

his about 700 pipes. Most of these are on display now. Here is a large
collection of ethnic and peculiar pipes + his daily smoked pipes from
the first half of this century. This museum is a must !
10 minutes by car from the center of Copenhagen.

Phone: (+45) 33 12 20 50
W.O. Larsen
Amagertorv 9
1160 Copenhagen K

most pipe brands produced or imported to Denmark. Also a large choice of
tobak's (this *is* the danish term for tobacco, Steve); around 300 brands.
Just beside the shop, they have a small, but exclusive pipe museum.
Located on the pedestrian street "Stroeget" in the center of Copenhagen.

Phone: (+45) 33 14 09 22
Paul Olsens Tobaksblanderi
Gammel Moent 4
1117 Copenhagen K
Description:	 This is the only tobacconist shop in Denmark, where you
can get your own blend of tobacco. The shop keeps a, still updated, log book
of custom blends and long gone factory blends. If you never tasted Dunhill's
"Mister Alfreds Own", John Cottons "No. 1&amp;2 Mixture" etc., they can mix it 
for you. The shop also offers a number of fine cigars and top quality pipes.
The pipe choice includes Bang, Hedegaard, Winslow, Stanwell, Savinelli, Ashton
a.o.. The interior of the shop alone is worth the visit.

Subject: review of a Kirsten pipe...

	i recently got a Kirsten pipe, and thought i'd review it for the
	list.  i got the address from the pipes resource directory and
	called and asked for a catalog.  i talked to a very nice woman
	on the other end, and the catalog came a couple of days later.
	Kirsten pipes have a so-called "Radiator" stem that is supposed
	to remove the steam from the smoke.  it's made of aircraft-grade
	aluminum, and looks way cool.  i bought a 0.25 bent "Horizon"
	which has a small stem, a medium briar bowl, and a Ebonite
	mouthpiece.  they also have straight and full bent stems in black,
	silver, and brass finishes.  bowls are available in medium,
	large, and extra large.  medium is a good size for me as i
	usually don't want to spend a lot of time on a bowl full.  cost:
	$35.00 plus a little shipping.	sent in the supplied order form,
	and got the pipe a week later; good turn around i thought.

	mine's all black, and i like it a lot.	i'm rather new to pipes,
	but this one seems to taste better than most of the other ones
	i have.  i don't know if it's the "Radiator" or not.  maybe it's
	just that it looks high-tech, and that i'm a techno-geek.  either
	way, one of these and a supply of Thompson's "Cherry Laurel"
	and i'm a happy man.  it also seems to keep itself lighted better
	than some other pipes of mine, which is a bonus.

ATTENTION CIGAR SMOKERS

Not having the time myself to administer a mailing list, I have instead 
successfully created a USENET newsgroup.

It is called:

alt.smokers.cigars

It is up and running.

Enjoy!

Rex

[ We have it at Rutgers (the site I read alt.smokers from), but it's
empty there. Maybe our membership can generate a little cigar traffic?
Good luck, Rex! -S. ]

I read on rec.smokers that cigars and pipe tobacco tend to have
little nicotine in them because the nicotine breaks down during the
aging process. Anyone know if this is true or not? (Unfortunately due
to local news server problems I no longer receive alt.smokers so I
couldn't follow the discussion there.)

Subject: humidor and saltwater

Hello Steve,

You asked why the salt in the proposed humidor. That is to
garanteed a stable 70% of humidity in the humidor. If you only
put water in a humidor, all water will evaporate (in principle
there is no other limit then 100%;-). In case of a saturated water
salt solution, there exist a natural equilibrium of 70% humidity
above the water/salt solution.

And because 70% seems to be the optimal humidity, this should
be a good start.

All the best,

Victor

[ Thanks for the info, but I still don't understand the mechanism,
Victor. Perhaps one of our chemically astute readers could help me
out? -S. ]

flamage, and it's only about a week old! (Personally, I find it
excellent for a lot of the bitching and moaning I won't do in the
Digest... :-)

It's good to be back from NYC -- while we didn't make a mint, we
didn't lose our shirts, either. And I won the first door prize -- a
nice presmoked Barling with a birds-eye end grain! Also the first
Barling in my collection.

BTW, Neil Murray asked me to display his A&amp;M Digest 1994 Pipe
Calendars, but I'm sorry to say that his flyers didn't arrive in time
for me to take them up. We'll try to make it up with a plug here. If
anyone would like to order Neil's pipe calendar, contact him at:

	Neil Murray
	Agricultural and Mechanical Gazette
	47758 Hickory
	Apt. 22305
	Wixom, MI 43893

The calendars are normally $12.50, but are $10 to the netizens here.
You can also try to reach Neil at ????.??????@???.???, but the return
mail's been somewhat flaky.

Also of note: Check out the JR Cigar catalog. The ad copy alone makes
it my fave catalog, next to Mo Hotta Mo Betta. Call 1-800-JR-CIGAR for
your copy!

And now, even if you don't have the Pipes Calendar, it's the right day
to have a few puffs of yer favorite smoke, as we enjoy the
following...

Subject: Washington DC

I am preparing to go to the Washington DC area within the next couple of days
and I was wondering if you knew of any quality pipe shop/tobbacconist shop I
should seek out while there.
I was told that this upcoming week was national pipe smoking week, so I hope
to find some real good deals.  At my local shop I purchased a meerschaum for
$12.00 (normall $30.00) and got 4 oz of tobacco free.  What a bargain!
In any event I hope you can help with addresses and phone Numbers .  Thanks.

[ Check out the Georgetown Pipe Shop, I think. Hope this is in time... -S. ]

I am a pipe smoker going on 7-8 years, liking peterson pipes... One problem,
let my wife clean them out a couple of times, and now the Stem is sitting
somewhere on Interstate 89 in Vermont!!!!

Can anyone provide me an address where I can buy replacement parts for
Peterson Pipes??

Subject: This and that

I'm curious how many folks out there care for Indonesian clove
cigarettes ... I like my pipe, but most times when I'm looking for
that contemplative mood, there is nothing quite like a nice aromatic
clove cigarette and a cup of freshly brewed coffee ... Yum!

I've tried a bunch of different makes, Djarum, Sampoerna and so forth,
but have settled on the Sampoerna Internationals.  Nice and aromatic,
plus the tobacco has an interesting flavor.  Can't really recommend
the Xtra's though ... tried one this morning for the first time and
hated it!  

It appears that the Xtras are targeted at the US menthol smokes :-(
The tobacco is pretty lame and there is a really strange character to
them that is probably supposed to be clove, but really isn't.  Ugh.

I see that the only Albany listing is:

&gt;The Smoker				(Pipes Digest #127)
&gt;Albany, NY
&gt;518-462-1302

Their street address is 136 Washington Ave.  Very pipe-oriented place!
I normally go to a place called Edleez Tobacco (Styvesant Plaza,
Albany, 518-489-6872) that caters more to the cigar crowd.  They have
a walk in humidor that is about 15ftx25ft, and jam packed with just
about every brand you can imagine. They even keep reference copies of
Cigar Afficianado in the humidor to look at while you are browsing!

That's right, over thirty new members since last week! We're doing
terrific, folks! Largely through the publicity Rex Wockner's
well-met alt.smokers.cigars group has generated. 

But now, unfortunately, it's time to face a few facts.

		  *** Warning -- Politics Ahead ***

I'm glad we have all this interest, because we're going to need all
the help we can get.

Legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress (by Frank
Lautenberg, D:NJ) that would make it a crime to smoke in any public
place, at all, ever. That means no more brandy and 8-5-8s after
dinner, folks, even if we rent the hall. No more sitting by the
fireside of the inn with a pipe and a beer. Pass out cigars at the
wedding and you'd risk getting busted. Use a lighter, go to jail.

Frankly, I think this violates First Amendment right of peaceful
assembly for legal purposes. Unfortunately, it's already the law in
Maryland. And it's spreading. We simply can't count on RJR and Philip
Morris to defend our rights anymore.

And that ain't all. It comes in combination with the heavy tax
proposals on cigars and pipe tobacco, that may put many smokeshops out
of business. In combination, these events have convinced me that there
may well be a coordinated and powerful effort to wipe out tobacco in
the U.S. Including pipes and cigars. Including smoking in
moderation. Including smoking in the privacy of our own homes. And,
unless we act now, the posession and sale of tobacco will be
criminalized in the United States within the decade.

I'll repeat that. It's important.

*** Unless we act, NOW, the posession and sale of tobacco will be ***
*** criminalized in the United States within the decade.          ***

Please help stop the Second Prohibition. Speak out. Write your
elected representatives and your local media. Find out which
candidates protect your rights, and which ones abuse them; vote as
appropriate, and let the candidates know why you did. Send their names
here and I'll put together a list.

And from now on, the following lines will separate the intro from the
features. I think it's that important. Let us work together so that we
can continue to

				Smoke in peace,
				~\U Steve.

Subject: Re: humidor and saltwater

&gt;From: Victor Reijs &lt;??????.?????@???????.??&gt;
&gt;Subject: humidor and saltwater
&gt;
&gt;You asked why the salt in the proposed humidor. That is to
&gt;garanteed a stable 70% of humidity in the humidor. If you only
&gt;put water in a humidor, all water will evaporate (in principle
&gt;there is no other limit then 100%;-). In case of a saturated water
&gt;salt solution, there exist a natural equilibrium of 70% humidity
&gt;above the water/salt solution.
&gt;
&gt;And because 70% seems to be the optimal humidity, this should
&gt;be a good start.
&gt;
&gt;[ Thanks for the info, but I still don't understand the mechanism,
&gt;Victor. Perhaps one of our chemically astute readers could help me
&gt;out? -S. ]

Let's give this a try.  Suppose that your humidor's humidity has
decreased to 30%.  The water in the cup of saturated salt solution
has the "choice" of staying in the cup with the salt or leaving as
water vapor in the humidor.  Victor's observation is that the water
will continue to leave the cup until the concentration of water vapor
in the humidor reaches 70%.  This causes less water to be in the cup
to keep the salt in solution.  The salt will drop out of solution
into the bottom of the cup.  You then need only to add water to the
cup until most, but not necessarily all, the salt is re-dissolved.

A soak stone works on a similar principle.  Water has the "choice" of
staying in the stone or evaporating into the air in the jar.
Saturated salt solution offers one additional advantage.  If the
humidity in the jar is greater than 70%, the water would "rather" be
in the salt solution than in the air.  This is water is more likely
to condense on the sides of a glass jar than on a soak stone.

&gt; Subject: Washington DC
&gt; 
&gt; I am preparing to go to the Washington DC area within the next couple of days
&gt; and I was wondering if you knew of any quality pipe shop/tobbacconist shop I
&gt; should seek out while there.
&gt; I was told that this upcoming week was national pipe smoking week, so I hope
&gt; to find some real good deals.  At my local shop I purchased a meerschaum for
&gt; $12.00 (normall $30.00) and got 4 oz of tobacco free.  What a bargain!
&gt; In any event I hope you can help with addresses and phone Numbers .  Thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; [ Check out the Georgetown Tobacco Shop, I think. Hope this is in 
                             ^^^^^^^

Also, JR Tobacco at 17th &amp; K, Draper's at 14th &amp; G, Cigar Club 
International at the Grand Hotel, and John B Hayes Tobacco at the Fair 
Oaks Mall in Fairfax County, VA.

Subject: cigar newsletter

I just signed on to the  alt.cigar smoker newsletter and was interested to
see that you could add to my extremely limited knowledge of what is a good
cigar.  My girlfriend hates the idea of me smoking cigars so any info you
might have that can aid me in my effort to confuse and confound my better
half would be much appreciated.

Thanks alot

Subject:      Is it truth?

Hi Steve,
    my pal forwarded me yer Pipes digest. Is a nice idea and I will
read from now on...
    But I have a little question you may answer. I have heard that
Americans (I am from Czech republic, Europe) have discovered a new
material which is much better and much cheaper than bruyere. IS IT
RIGHT?
    I've also heard that plenty of smokers DO want this mew material
(kinda plastic) more than classical bruyere. IS IT RIGHT?
    I study economics so I think that this will probably terribly
decrease prices of classic wooden pipes. It may come to Europe for
within two months. IS IT POSSIBLE?

You may (of course) add this to next Pipes digest, but I would
appreciate your answer to my E-mail since I don't know when will I
get next Digest.

Bye bye
Jaromir

[ Not that I've heard, Jaromir, and I don't know how well they'd sell,
anyway. There was a pipe called "The Smoke" introduced in the 1960s,
which was made of pyrolitic graphite. It bombed... -S. ]

Subject: Re: Digest

   I guess a little personal information is in order. I'm a college 
student here in scenic Delaware and I have learned to get a great deal of 
pleasure out of a relaxing cigar. I am in the process of trying different 
brands and sizes but I have discovered a fondness for Macanudos. I have 
also subscribed to the alt.cigars newsgroup (where I found out about your 
digest) and am eager to try some of the brands mentioned in there. There 
are very few good tobacconists in Delaware, the best being in the lobby 
of a VERY expensive restaraunt, so I go to a little place off the beaten 
path with a decent supply for me to start off with. I would like to use 
your service more or less as a menu of what's out there and then try to 
smoke as many of them as I can. I hope this is enough of a "personal 
note" for you and look forward to your digest.

From: ????@??????.??? (Chris Cochems)
Subject: Autobiograpy

I am a 46 year old unemployed Systems Engineer leaving in the greater San 
Francisco area.  I have been smoking a pipe since I was in the Navy -- 
1966.  

I exclusively smoke a heavy English mixture (English Oriental Supreme 
from American Tobacco).

I worked for a year and a half in the early seventies as a tobaccinist in 
Southern California for several shops including one on the Queen Mary.

My pipe collection is large.  After 5 business trips to Turkey last year, 
I have been mainly smoking my Meerschaums.  The most notable pipes in my 
collection include a hand carved ivory pipe from Japan (unsmokable), a 
very large 3/4 bent Camoy (age unknown) and a very large (6" long by 7" 
high, not including stem) meershaum in the shape of a dragon.

Finally, an addition for the resource file:

Meerschaum Pipes personally handcrafted

Bilal Donmez
Arasta Carsi No. 63
Sultanahmet-Istanbul
Turkey
011-90-212-516-4142

Unfortunately, Bilal-bey does not speak English, but his teenage son 
does.  I have been very happy with the 20 or so pipes I have purchased 
from him.  His prices range from about $10.00 to $300.00, with anything 
over about $30.00 having a case.  I know he has done some mail order 
business with the US.

Chris

Thanks for adding me to the list.

Lots of good information

Still in shock over the passing of Barry Levin.

I doubt anyone will ever reach his level of expertise in terms of pipe
history and marketing.

Imagine being able to talk Radice out of some of his personal
collection of Camminettos!

[ Didn't know him well, but he seemed very friendly over the phone,
and I enjoyed the Levin brochures. Best of luck to his son, who's
taking over the business. -S. ]

A while ago I sent you a request to be included on your mailing list for pipes,
etc.  I recieved one issue and have not seen another one since then.  What
happened, maybe I did something wrong.  Please help I found the first one
informative.

BTW that humidor (sp?) that you bought from ed., I think you said that it is
clear.  Is light bad for cigars?  Also did the shelf come with it?

Thanks,
Tad Olson

[ Glitch hopefully resolved, Tad! And, to my knowledge, light is not
bad for cigars; otherwise the smokeshops would display them under a

Things are going pretty well... First, I got a letter to the editor
published in the Hunterdon County Democrat, about public smoking bans
and the First Amendment right to peaceful assembly for legal
purposes. Next time you see yourself getting bashed in the media, take
arms against the sea of troubles! (But, dhang, I wish there was some
real leadership in the smokers' rights movement that I respected...)

Second, just put down earnest money on a house in Kingston. It has
ample deck space, so that I can smoke my 8-5-8s (thanks, Kam!) without
bothering the sweetie. :-) Wish us luck!

So, looking forward to a new home and a more tolerant America, let's
lean back, light up, and lighten up as we discuss stagecraft,
lighting, and Cole's Law...

From: ?????@??????.??? (Brad Williams)
Subject: Introduction.

Well, looks like you beat me to the punch.  I've received my first pipes 
digest and haven't sent in an intro yet. Here goes...

I'm a project engineer with Iwerks Entertainment, a large-format and 
specialty theatre systems company and I enjoy both pipes and cigars.  I 
have been smoking a pipe for about a year or so now - my cigar-smoking 
friends and I decided it was somehow less offensive - but am still getting
the hang of it.  I can't help but feel I'm commiting some major rookie 
moves now and then and am extremely reticent to pack it in public - so 
any basic advice you can offer would be appreciated.

[ Light edit for space reasons. -S. ]

&gt;BTW that humidor (sp?) that you bought from ed., I think you said that it is
&gt;clear.  Is light bad for cigars?  Also did the shelf come with it?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

&gt;
&gt;[ Glitch hopefully resolved, Tad! And, to my knowledge, light is not
&gt;bad for cigars; otherwise the smokeshops would display them under a
&gt;safety light :-) -S. ]
&gt;
 
Light _is_ bad for cigars, which is why they're boxed. ;)  A cigar store
will have one open box of every brand for the person who wants to buy
individual cigars, but humidors should not let light in, unless you only
keep boxes of cigars in it.

Subject: Re: pipes list

Thank You for adding me to your list. My name is Adam Bourque I'm a 
college student in Ann Arbor Michigan. I discovered the calming and 
relaxing properties of pipe smoking during a stressful period in my life 
and continue to enjoy it. I find that my pipe can act as a distraction 
(?) or such that helps me think. Next digest I will add an address to 
your resource list, currently I do not have the address nor the price 
range. The old addage is true.  "The wise man uses a pipe to think, the 
fool as something to stick in his mouth!"

[ I'm sure we've all used it for both purposes :-) -S. ]

Subject: Comoy or Peterson - I'm a novice.

Steve-    
     I needed a little pipes advice.  I have your FAQ/Starter guide, but I 
needed a little something extra.  I originally joined your list for cigar 
smoking chat, but I find myself wanting to try a pipe (while it's still 
legal :-).  I have ordered a catalog from a pipe company in Chicago (Iwan 
Ries and Co.) and noticed they have Chacom pipes by Camoy for about $23.00.  
I also noticed a Peterson "second" in a pipe shop for $25.00.  Which do you 
think would be the better pipe?  I really don't want to jump in with both 
feet (and wallet) and find that I don't enjoy it.  What do you think?

 -Michael
??????????@?????.?????.???

[ My bias is for Petersons -- easier maintenance and much more
durable. Second, schmecond -- a pipe with a couple of fills, may not
look as nice, but will still smoke fine. Welcome! -S. ]

ah, not exactly clamoring for admission to the Pipes Mailgroup... The
first week of April is often like that. However, we do have some good
news to report... I've proposed a new newsgroup, "alt.smokers.pipes,"
and will create it on April 15 unless someone manages to talk me out
of doing so. Ah, the beauty of the alt. hierarchy... light up as we
contemplate...

Regarding Mike Guentzel's question about
whether to buy a Peterson or a Comoy: I have
pipes from both companies and they are both nice.
However, I think I would give the nod to the Peterson
for overall quality. But they are both fine pipes.

this digest is dated April first hmmmm. Maybe that's what

something can be done to stop this governmental meddling, or

Subject: It just don't get better than this...

Wednesday brought about an unexpected joy.  After teaching two kid's
Kung Fu classes in the afternoon, with the kids a bit more rambunctious
than usual, this being Spring and all, I was in the mood for a relaxing
evening.  I asked my date if she would let me cook dinner for her,
rather than going out, which she found to be a delightful proposition.
After a refreshing Martini, I set about to prepare our repast.  A bottle 
of 1985 Crozes Hermitage annointed the soul, and the chicken Veronique
satisfied at least one of the hungers.  We spoke of all the wonderful
things one speaks about over romantic interludes. 

Supper finished, I built a fire and opened a 1980 Quinto do Noval Porto.
What goes quintessentially well with port?  A fine cigar, of course.  But, 
alas, I didn't suggest this.  

Now, this woman had commented before on how much she enjoys the smell 
of my pipe;  clearly the marque of a woman of discerning tastes.  When
I was selecting the wine for dinner, I gave her a bit of a historical 
tour of the wine cellar, followed by a glimpse of the humidor, in which
I have several hundred cigars ageing to perfection.  (I began buying 
twice as many cigars as I would smoke when I worked as a tobacconist.
These days, I more often turn to the pipe, though I still maintain a 
good supply of cigars, just in case a war breaks out, and I'll need 
supplies to tide me over. ;)

The fire crackled, and the port warmed.  "Would it be alright if we
shared a cigar?" she asked, as we looked deeply into one another's
firelit eyes.   

I'll say this: I have never enjoyed a cigar as much.

Subject: Re: warning -- politics ahead

Hello all of you,

I just want to react on the politics! I see a very dangerous
direction US is going to take. Is that freedom to choose for
yourself? And furthermore, because the europeans are eager to
follow the steps of the 'highle developed' US, I foresee the
same messures in Europe, and that freightens me:-(

I hope you are able to stop this development (is it
development:-(?), in your country. I though that your president
had also a e-mail-box, why not send him some e-mail ot better a
free copy of the digest! If you do not know the e-mail of your
presendent, I can find out;-)

BUt to elaborate a little bit more on smoking:
- oke, smoking things is for your own health not good
(irregardless of what you smoke). So this increases the medical
costs
- smoking gives me a moment of quietnees. So less stress, and
perhaps less costs for medical affairs.
- smoke can be terrible for SOME people, if they have some
kind of alergy or asthma. We as smoker should know that, and
not be blund on this kind of people. They have the right on
clear air.
- a lot of people just do not like smoking, because they don't
like seeing people smoke. They want to deprive us from smoking,
that that is BAD, because of a lesser personal freedom. These
should be convinced of other thoughts.

Just a comparison with something else. How many people die form
driving cars (as active cardrivers or as passive walkers/etc.)?
What does that cost on medical things?
Furthermore what about the polution (acid rain). I heard that
25% of the acid rain is due to car driving. That is also a kind
of passive effect through cardriving. What is that costing us
or will cost us?! I know already, that lots of woods in Europe
are dead because of the acid rain (and 25% due to cardriving).

Why do the people not work on that! Is that not a more
profitable area of work? Why work on smoking
cigars/pipes/cigattes, while the same people drive around with
cars that smell badly (certainly for e.g. asthmetic people),
kills a lot of people and produces a lot of acid rain. 

I know, comparision are always bad, but in some way we have to
stop this mad thing about nor being able smoking a peacefull 
pipe/cigar.
If people have ideas how this discussion shoulk be leveled,
please let us know. If US can not stop this mad idea about
smoking, Europe should be able to do it!

All the best,

Victor

[ Victor, thanks for your efforts, but I don't think emailing Clinton
is going to do much good. As Carly Simon once sang, "You know, you
can't talk to a man / when he don't want to understand." Far more
effective would be letters to the editor, rebuttal time on TV, or
organization. I hope you, and all our European readers, will act to
stop persecution before it gains a stronghold -- the U.S. government
and culture doesn't always do the best thing. -S. ]

Subject: Bans in the Public Interest

Boy, Steve, I just read that entry on banning tobacco (I have
been following this for some time) and was struck by the almost
exact wording used by defenders of the Second Amendment rights.
Banning and/or taxing to put a stop to a product "in the interests
of the public" seems to be the new government pastime.

I too would like to urge all of you on the maillist to consider
writing in behalf of the entire Bill of Rights.  Even easier,
E-mail the White House.  Let YOUR leaders know that you don't
appreciate their intrusion into you lives.

Show that you use the products responsibly.  I don't randomly
shoot people and I don't blow smoke in their faces (except Joe
'cause he loves a good cigar).  I don't drink and drive, but
I love a good single malt.  All three of which may cause me harm
but I take the responsibility that it not cause YOU harm.

Do the majority of you out there feel this way, or do you want
to be legislated into a sterile existance (or jail)?  Rhetorical
question, since you're enjoying this fine newsletter.  So get
off the dime and write for your rights.

The E-address of the President (yes, Slick Willie hisself) is:

       ?????????@??????????.???

Please don't limit yourself to this, as every letter to your
congressman is worth a thousand votes.

[Sorry for the soapbox, Steve, I really tried to stay short.]

Subject:      Re: Pipes Digest #137 - April 1, 1994

Hey Steve,
Sorry to bother you, but I have a question if you have a second.

I was at my Mom's yesterday, and went through my late Dad's desk, and
found one of his pipes. Mom said I could have it, and she would save
any other pipes she found for me.

My Dad was not a die-hard pipe smoker, but before he retired I think
he smoked it at work more so than at home. So it looks to be in good
condition. But Dad was certainly no collector, nor a purist. He
probably would have never paid over $20 or so for a pipe.

When I pulled the stem off, I remembered. This pipe is designed for
you to bend a pipe cleaner in the middle, and stick it into the
shank(?) to act as a filter. I can remember Dad telling me that he
had found these pipes, which were very reasonably priced (it seems
like they sold two for one) from a mail order company. He also ordered
his tobacco from this outfit. Any ideas as to what kind of pipe this
is, or who sold it?

What about the concept, is that filter thing unique?

It appears to be broken in pretty well...looks like a good "carbon
cake" in the bowl (to a novice like me, anyway). Probably hasn't been
smoked in ten years or so...Mom hated pipes so he hung it up right
after he retired. The bowl still smells like that good tobacco he
used to smoke.

I'm sure I don't exactly have a classic on my hands, but of course,
it  is special to me. I'm thinking about firing it up.

BTW: I found a can of your "Balkan Sobranie" at a shop here. Maybe
I'll try a tin when If this pipe thing flies.

Thanks for any advice, Steve.......Have a great day.

Mark

[ I haven't seen cleaners used as filters... anyone have an idea what
sort of pipe Mark has? -S. ]

[ Photos from the 1952 IAPSC convention in San Diego, mostly,
including some nice ones of women smokers. Don't know of any cigar
calendars, but it'd be a good idea for someone. Re Greta Garbo, there
was a picture of her as a young woman, with a pipe, in the latest Pipe
Smokers' Ephemeris, and perhaps in her obituary in the New York
Times. I sent James a copy free, since Neil had sent me three.

From: ??????@????.??? (Jon Baker)
Subject: 2c

Traffic was a bit light last week, so I figured I'd throw in
2c worth.  On the recommendations from the list, I tried some
Arturo Fuente 8-5-8's.  I found them quite pleasant.  Good
flavor, well built, good structural integrity, and fairly
consistent to the end.  The taste is somewhat on the light
side for the first 1/2" - 1" or so, but then it picks up and
is quite nice for the remainder.  The price is modest, and
the box is nice, too!  It's not 100% airtight, but I throw
a humidifier in the box and they're good for the 3 to 4
weeks it takes me to smoke them, obviating the need for a
humidor.

Bang for the buck, I'll stick to 8-5-8's from now on, over
my previous regulars - Romeo&amp;Julieta Cetros.

As for pipe smoking, I've tried it, and have stuck with 
cigars.  Perhaps I was doing something wrong, perhaps the
tobacco wasn't best, perhaps it was the pipe, but there
were a few things I didn't like with the pipe.  Don't take
this as pipe-bashing in any way!  Perhaps someone can 
suggest what I was doing wrong and offer corrective advice ...

  - awkward to hold in the mouth.  When I want to turn the 
    page of a magazine or paper, I need both hands free, 
    and a cigar hangs much more comfortably than a pipe.
  - doesn't stay lit.  Probably my greatest irritation.
    A good cigar needs a draw periodically to stay lit, but
    the pipe seemed to need much more, more frequently.  The
    darned thing would go out in 30 seconds.
  - burned hotter.  Because I had to puff harder and more
    often, it burned hotter, ruining the taste.  Not pleasant.
  - more fumbling.  If I let the thing sit for too long (not
    long at all), it went out, and had to be relit.  This
    could require remixing, retamping, relighting, etc.
    Perhaps it is inherent in pipes that more fumbling is
    necessary, and indeed some people seem to derive great
    pleasure from it (all the power to them).  But perhaps
    if the root cause - going out too readily - was solved,
    that would eliminate this problem for me.

Would a better quality pipe help prevent some of these problems?
Better quality tobacco?  Fresher?  If anyone out there has had
similar problems, and found a solution, please share it!

[ You might have it packed too tight, or too moist. Pack it so it's a
little springy, and perhaps let it dry out some. The object is to just
barely keep the bowl lit. Persistence pays -- eventually, you'll get
the hang of it. -S. ]

Subject: Saltwater in the humidor

Greetings:
I have been listening for about two months and this is the first time
I've checked in.  I believe this is the place where I heard about the
old Danish trick of using salt water in your humidor.  My Tobacconist
tells me this is true.  So, I've been trying distilled water and plain
old table salt in a small plastic cup inside of a large ice chest for
about a month now.  The results appear to be successful so far.
I have some test cigars unwrapped sitting on top of their boxes and they feel
and smoke just great.    Has anyone else givenm this a try
let us know?

Subject: A good beginner pipe

Sorry I have not been able to send the initial greeting and info. you
requested until now (exams are upon me and time is precious).

Anyways I am a student at the Univ. of British Columbia, in the forestry
faculty (there is nothing wrong with clearcuts so long as they are done
properly and there are still plenty of spotted owls in Washington,
Oregon and Northern California).  I was introduced to cigars a couple of
years ago and I have enjoyed these immensely.  Actually I just had a
"Bances - coronna de luxe" from the House of Horvath Inc. in Toronto.  It
was a bit more expensive than the others ($6 after PST and GST) but turned
out to be worth it.  It did have "Habana" on the box so it might be a no no
in the States but if you have a chance you might want to sample some of
Horvath's goods.

I begin to run on at my keyboard so...  I would now like to try pipes.
I know you have probably done so many times already but suggestions on a
good starter pipe and a mellow tobacco to go with it would be much
appreciated.

Thanks JT

Subject: Question

DEAR STEVE:

		Iwan Ries tobak/pipe company claims they have a brand of 
tobacco (Three Star Brand, I think) that "burns cool, dry, is filled with 
flavor, and----does NOT bite the tongue at all."  I want to know how a tobacco
can make such a boast.  I thought tongue bite was mostly dependent upon the 
pipe and not so much the tobak.  Now I realize that the condition of 
certain tobacco can make it apt to burn hotter than others (such as 
dryness, size of cut, and flavoring agents used in it).  But, Three Star 
boasts that all of their blends burn cool.  Is this a valid claim?  I 
know the only sure way know is to try it out, but . . . 

Dan Aromatic Sauder

[ In a word, no. Not because ***'s tobaccos aren't good, but because
cool burning depends on things they can't control, such as moisture in
the tobacco when you smoke it, and how hard you puff. -S. ]

Subject: Re:  Pipe Mailing group

Hello Pipe smokers, 
and thanks for adding me to the Group, Steve.
Well, to introduce myself, i'm a student and enjoy Pipes for
over ten years now. Among my favourite Pipes are some Petersons
and some Mastro de Paja (very nice italian handcarved ones) and
lots of others. Hmmm, sometimes it is a bit complicated to
explain to no-pipe-smokers (girlfriend:) why someone (me)
_needs_ a new pipe when he already has soooo many ones. 

Studying here in austria and living in germany I would be 
interested in opinions about which kinds of tobacco you 
(being in USA, GB, etc.) favor: any lovers of english 
(latakia scented) tobacco? Extremely perfumed tutti-frutti? 
For me, it seems to depend somewhat on the wheather:
Bright and sunny - fruity, rain and snow - more english one.
Any opinions? What about filters? Are they really "typical
german" or are they established in other countries, too?
Happy smoke,
Andreas

Subject: new subscriber introduction + pipe filter answer to question

Hi,

This is my first communication, so an introduction is in order. I'm a
graduate student in computer science. I've been 'out there' in the
real world and am returning to get more education, diplomas, and
creative energy for the future.

Some comments on current threads running through the digest:

A reader asked about using a pipe cleaner as a filter. I'm afraid
that's all too common when you just can't get the original filter ...
I have a Falcon pipe, bought in Scotland, made of aluminum with a
meerschaum lining (!) that comes apart and has two places you put
filters in: a ring shaped filter at the bottom of the bowl, and a
cylindrical filter in the stem. Not finding any of these in Israel,
where I lived, I would bend pipe cleaners and use them instead!

Regarding smoking in public and semi-public places. My general
attitude of live and let live compels me to avoid lighting up in the
presence of people who object to it, or in restaurants. BUT, I would
truly appreciate a restaurant, coffeeshop etc. which would create a
smoker's corner that was insulated from others, and reasonably
ventilated so WE don't choke on our own smoke. That would be a drawing
point for smokers (of which there are many). There is no need to
legislate against smokers, only FOR clean air for those who want it.
Remember how many activities are dangerous to your health, cost the
taxpayer money, and don't provide any benefit to others: sex (!),
children of welfare parents, sky-diving, hang-gliding, scuba-diving,
eating buttered popcorn, eating meat, chocolate.

How about writing about favorite pipes? Many have passed through my
hands over the years. Most I received as presents or mementos from
friends. I currently keep only three pipes. One was given to me by my
brother, who found it as a reject, because it had initials carved on
it, then wasn't picked up by the buyer. Coincidence would have it
these were my initials, so he bought it for me. One pipe belonged to a
close friend of my parents, who was like an uncle to me. He died in an
accident, and that is the memento I have from him (I don't remember
how it got into my hands). The third pipe is one I mentioned above, a
high-tech pipe with meerschaum lining in an aluminum body, filters
galore, wanting only a microprocessor to be perfect ... 8-)

I'd rather pick up pipes with histories than buy them. I feel the same
about growing a garden - I'd rather take seeds from friends' gardens
and grow in mine than 'shop' for a garden.

Boaz

Hi there, I see from the news letter I just recieved that everyone goes by
their real names so I thought I would introduce myself.  My name is Michael
Kurt.  I'm a 23 year old student at Grandvalley State University in Grand
Rapids, Michigan.  Im majoring in accounting and have about another year to
go before I graduate depending on when I intern.  I have been smoking fine
cigars for about a year now, and find that few other things are able to give
me as much satisfaction as enjoying a cigar after a hard week of classes. 
Unfortunately, being a student on a limited budget I can only afford a few a
week.  Hopefully someday I will have enough money to build my own humidor and
stock it with boxes of my favorite cigars.  It's great to be in company of
those who enjoy the same things in life as myself.

[ Great to have you, too, Michael! Nice to see that cigars are not the
exclusive province of us Old Fartz of 37. -S. ]

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #138 - April 8, 1994

Hello to all:

As a former tobaccinist, I could not pass up the chance to give my 
opinions on some of the questions raised in last issue.

Beginners pipe -  First, plan on buying two pipes and rotating them.  Go 
to any reputable tobacco shop and ask for seconds.  These pipes are 
quality briar made in exactly the same way as the more expensive firsts 
made by the same company.  During the final carving and sanding of a 
pipe, small bits of stone or voids in the briar are often exposed.  The 
solution is to fill the void with putty, and sell the pipe for a lesser 
price.  These "fills" have no effect on the smokability of a pipe.

Do not pay the money for expensive pipes until you are sure that you are 
going to like pipe smoking.  Use one pipe one day, and another the next.  
Buy small amounts of two or three tobaccos, a light aromatic, a 
cavendish, and an English, and see which does it for you.  Anything which 
includes "BCA", which is a fire cured cavendish, is a good choice for the 
aromatic.

Bite -  Many things contribute to tongue bite.  Here are a few general 
rules and suggestions.

1.  The more wood in a pipe, the cooler it will smoke.
2.  The more surface area, the cooler the pipe will smoke.  That means a 
rough finish pipe will smoke cooler than a smooth pipe of the same size 
and shape.
3.  The greater the wall thickness of the bowl, the cooler the smoke.
4.  The weight of the pipe is also a factor in heat dissipation.  Look 
for a pipe that is light for its size.
5.  The distance from the bowl to the pipe is also a major factor.  Also, 
the length of shank vs. stem.  A lumberman shape is a very cool smoke 
because of this.
6.  The pipe must not have any varnish or the heat will be held in.  This 
should not be a problem in a good tobacco shop.

7.  The slower the tobacco burns, the cooler the smoke.  Factors 
affecting this are cut (size of each piece), moisture content and 
additives.  This is always a tradeoff of cool vs. staying lit. Even in a 
good pipe, correctly packed, you can get bite from a tobacco that is 
"bone dry" and/or contains chemicals to keep it lit (salt peeter and 
glycerine usually).  This also should not be a problem if you choose a 
reputable tobacco shop.

8.  Puffing - If you are a fast puffer, select a large cut and keep it 
moist.  If you are a slow puffer, go to a smaller cut and keep it less 
moist.  Large cuts include cavendish, cube and plug.  Examples of smaller 
cuts are flake, ribbon and crimp.

9.  Packing - Probably the most difficult smoking art to master.  Here is 
the method I used to instruct new smokers:
a)  Fill the pipe to the brim loosely.  Pack evenly til the bowl is only 
half-full.
b)  Fill the pipe again loosely.  Pack evenly til the bowl is 3/4 full.  
It will take more pressure this time.
c)  Over-fill the bowl loosely.  Pack evenly til the tobacco is level 
with the top.  This will take much more pressure.

10.  Lighting -  Use a butane lighter or a wooden match.  Anything else 
you will taste.  (For the true romantic, you can use an ember from the 
fireplace.) Light the entire surface drawing deeply.  Tamp the tobacco 
gently then relite.  Make sure the entire surface is evenly lit.

11.  Other considerations - Here are some other tips

a)  Smoking outside in the wind, or while driving with an open window 
will cause the pipe to burn faster.

b)  Breaking in (building a carbon cake to the thickness of a dime) will 
make even a terrible pipe smokable.  Do not let the cake get much thicker 
than this or it may split your bowl.  The new smoker wont need to worry 
about a reamer for a couple of months.

c) Placing a pipe cleaner in the pipe while packing will tend to prevent 
tobacco from clogging the draft hole.

d) Never use a pipe with a metal filter.  The metal stays at a different 
temperature, and causes condensation, which results in a wet (gurgling) pipe.

e) Opinion -  Any filter (even a water pipe) means that you are drawing 
through stale smoke from the second puff on.

f) Materials - Good pipe materials are briar, meerschaum, corn cob, 
cherry, ceramic and clay.

Start with a briar.  Corn cob is great if you like the taste of burning 
corn cob (I do), but must be considered a disposable pipe and tends to be 
a hot smoke.  Cherrywood is marginally acceptable, although they are 
heavy for their size and tend to split easily. Ceramic burn hot and are 
fragile, but do "color" rapidly as you smoke them.  Clay is like ceramic 
but more so.  If you are going to try one, get one with a long stem and 
treat it gently.

g)  Before you by a pipe, insert a pipe cleaner and see where the draft 
hole is in relationship to the bottom of the bowl.  It should come in 
exactly at the bottom.  If it is too high, you will end up with an uneven 
cake and a soggy pipe.  If it is too low, the pipe might "burn out".

h)  If you tend to be a wet smoker, a mixture containing Latakia will 
tend to dry out your mouth and prevent this problem. 

If anyone is still reading this horribly long message, I would welcome

Subject: Pipe cleaner filters, etc

&gt; I've proposed a new newsgroup, "alt.smokers.pipes,"
&gt; and will create it on April 15 unless someone manages to talk me out
&gt; of doing so. Ah, the beauty of the alt. hierarchy... light up as we
&gt; contemplate...

Going through a regular proposal process (for alt) I hope?  I thought
it was a little presumptious of the alt.smokers.cigars guy to create a
group so soon.

What about rec.tobacco?  Is it going to be proposed again?

&gt;	C. Everett Koop, M.D.	(????@???.???????.???)

 His address would have been at .nih.gov, anyway, considering
that's where he got his captain's uniform (the National Institute
of Health being a part of the Navy.)  And nothing goes better
with foul weather gear than a pipe clamped between the teeth,
inverted in particularly bad weather -- just ask the Groton's
of Gloucester fisherman.

&gt; What about the concept, is that filter thing unique?

 I've heard of this.  I can't remember where.  I have a slim
paperback on pipe smoking (The Art of...?) and maybe this book
spoke disparagingly of this method (but whichever source didn't
like standard filters either, for weakening the taste.  All
that it approved were the metal condensing devices, and that
begrudgingly, if I remember correctly.)

    - David Chesler (???????@????.???????.??? ?????@???????.?????.???)


[ Well, Rex's group seems to have been pretty successful, so far. And,
yes, I have gone through the regular process. So far, discussion ==
nil. 

Re rec.misc.tobacco: I doubt if I can co-moderate, due to job
pressures. Would you be interested in spearheading an effort? -S. ]

Subject: Latakia vs scented tobacco

I've found an excellent compromise tobacco.  It combines the flavor of a 
light latakia blend with the aromatic qualities of a cavendish pressed 
with vanilla extract.  It comes from my local pipe shop; however, I 
understand that thye purchase it from Lanes, which is a supplier for 
most independent pipe shops.  The Lanes designation for the tobacco is 
"HGL" (for "Herman G. Lane").  I highly recommend it.

From: Ken Udut &lt;?????@????.??????.???&gt;
Subject: What brings me to the Internet Pipes Mailgroup

Hello new friends at pipes!

I'm a relatively new addition to the world of pipes.  I bought a $12 pipe 
at a pharmacy late this past summer, and have been smoking standard 
Captain Black Gold and Half and Half quite regularly.

While I will probably never attain the level of knowledge that many of 
you have on the various fine tobaccos, pipes, pipe history, and the like, 
I am interested in delving deeper into the world of pipes.  

I found out about the pipes list when I saw Steve's request to create 
alt.smokers.pipe on alt.config, and decided to come aboard as a new pipe 
smoker and enjoyer.

One big reason I am interested in smoking the pipe more heavily, getting 
fancier and tasty tobaccos and a nicer pipe (with a filter!), is that I 
am finding myself smoking cigarettes more and more.  I used to be a 
social smoker of cigarettes, only smoking occasionally.  But then, about 
a month ago, something "clicked" and I've been smoking like mad.  I only 
smoke the super-low tar menthols like NOW, but I still would rather stick 
with something safer, tastier and better smelling than cigarettes.

MINI AUTOBIOGRAPHY:
-------------U/~--
I am 22 years old (january 28, 1972), living and breathing in New 
Jersey.  I am a pianist, and I perform my 'spontaneous compositions' in 
local area churches.  We'll be making a 90-minute tape this Thursday, 
which will hopefully sell well (it will be my first tape).

I am the listowner of ????????@?????.?????? - discussion on the rights of 
kids and teens.  On a more specific and quite different shade of the 
children's/teen's rights issues, I am the creator of alt.sex.intergen, 
which is for the discussion of intergenerational relationships of all 
kinds (any relationship between either: two people of significantly 
different ages, such as 52 and 34, or between an adult and someone under 
the age of 18 which, in cases like the two ages being 21 and 16, has the 
same kinds of problems a relationship between a 52 and a 34 year old 
would have, outside of the added legal implications.

I own a 286/16 with hercules monitor, which is what I'm using right now 
to dialin to mordor.com, as well as my BBS, "Free Speech" 908.241-0537, 
which always welcomes people from across the globe to say, "Hello" (it 
takes all of 2 minutes to call, read some stuff other people wrote, 
write a "Hello" type message, and leave.  It's completely anonymous).

I guess that covers the range pretty well.  I've noticed that some of my 
teenage friends (male) are quite fastinated by my pipe, and enjoy 
"passing the pipe around", and the nice smell of the smoke-filled room.
Most of them HATE cigarettes, but somehow put my little drug-store $12 
pipe with Captain Black Gold in it on a higher level.

Subject: Thanks!


          Thanks for adding me to your distribution list.  I'm looking 
          forward to reading the new issues.  I did have one question now, 
          though, and that is, is the text of the Digest formatted in 
          anyway for text readers?  I don't know if you're familiar with 
          the "setext" format, but there's a text viewer out there called 
          EasyView that formats digests like yours into nice little 
          packets.  All those U/~ symbols made me wonder if yours was 
          similarly formatted.  (At least, I see a lot of U/~ symbols.  Am 
          I supposed to???)
          
          Next, I've come across a section in America Online devoted to 
          pipes and cigars.  You'll find it at The Exchange/Hobbies &amp; 
          Outdoors Message Center/Hobbies Board/Pipes &amp; Cigars.  It's where 
          I find out about you, as a matter of fact.  The moderator is 
          starting up a chat room, too, for interested people.

          ????.?????@???????.???.???
          
          P.S.  Which address should I use to send you mail?  There are two 
          I've seen, ?????@????.???????.??? and ????????@????.???????.???.  
          Any preferences?

[ Welcome aboard, Craig! Glad to see that, yes, there are some fellow
pipe enthusiasts at the EPA. To answer your questions, the "~\U"
symbols are supposed to be little pipes, and the
????????@???.???????.??? address is the preferred one. And thanks for
the words from AOL: we get a lot of readers from there, but don't
really know what's going on in that neck of cyberspace. Back issues
sent, too! -S. ]

Subject: PIPES

Hello, Steve. Glad to be on board. I ran off revision 1.6:4Mar94 and looked
closely at the list of sellers, and missing from this list is Faders of
Baltimore, MD. I go to his shop in Annapolis Mall, Annapolis, MD which has a
good feeling once you enter the store. Faders has a tobacco called "Barrister,"
which I have been smoking for several years now. There is enough latakia in it
to make it interesting and a good smoke. I saw that some of the other members
of the group have spoken about their pipes. I am now 69 and have smoked pipes
since I was 17, and also cigars. I have a number of pipes in my collection
which I have owned for many years. For instance, I have a Comoy Blue Riband pot
which I bought in St. Louis in 1954 for $17.50. I think that if you can get a
Blue Riband today, it would be quite a bit more. In '85, my wife and I went
through Scandinavia, and I went absolutely ape in W.O. Larson's and the Pip
Dend in Copenhagen. I now have as many pipes as I need and can reasonably
smoke, but a pipe collector is a pipe collector. Anyway, I am glad to be
associated with a group of individuals who enjoy a good pipeload and a good
cigar. Gen Frank ???.?????@???.???

[ Thanks, Ben, and we'll add Faders in the next rev. -S. ]

Subject: Pipes FAQ request

Well thanks to the pipes digest I was able to locate one of those really neat
little "pocket" pipes that fold over themselves.  I managed to get ahold of
it at the Richmond Pipe and Tobacco in Washington DC.  I also managed to pick
up a pipe by the brand name "Irish Seconds" (3/4 bent Billiard - blond wood -
I got it on St. Patrick's Day too which seemed appropriate somehow).  I was
wondering if someone knew what this brand was.  Someone told me that these
are the slightly imperfect Peterson pipes.  There are a few problems with the
grain of the wood, but it is onothing that will cause any problem (I think)
so it seems really pretty perfect to me.  Can anyone tell me if this is a
Peterson cast off, or is it another brand altogether?
     Another concern of mine is the proper way to break in a new pipe. A
friend filled his new Savinelli full the first time he smoked it.  He said it
got INCREDIBLY hot to the touch, and part of the finih on the outside of the
pipe "bubbled" and craxked.  I received a Charatan pipe as a gift and I am
afraid to smoke it for fear of ruining the finish on it, and I need to know
how to break it in if it in fact needs to be broken in.  Any suggestions? 
Thanks.

[ WOW! Basically, I'd say s l o w   d o w n. The object is to keep the
pipe at the just-going-out stage, so it doesn't get hot enough to do
such nasty things! -S. ]

Hi there,
we here in Germany are usullay a bit late with using
new cyberspace facilities. So I may have missed out 
on this:
Does anyone know a WWW page or even a server
dedicated to pipe smokers ?

Some time ago I got several replies from you pipers
about crafting pipes and tobacco. I intended to convert it
for use with AD&amp;D2nd. Well, the stuff is not lost,
it is still somewhere around. And I hope that one day I make it.

Subject: introduction

Just an introduction. I'm a middle-aged graduate student in New York, and 
have been smoking pipes off and on since about 1967. I took it up in earnest 
again in the mid-1980s and have since been spending a significant amount of 
my rather meager income over the years on pretty good pipes. My preference 
has evolved definitely towards deep defined blasts, and I now am definitely 
a sandblast collecter. I recently wrote a piece, out of frustration, called 
"In Defense of Sandblasts" for a recent PCI newsletter. Recently I've been 
tending toward tanshells, which are becoming a bit hard to find. I have 
about 70 pipes: Radicis, Ser Jacopos, Castellos, Capitellos, Charatans, 
Dunhills, Ashtons, Il Ceppos, Cooke, and some Bessai (a Cleveland shop). 
Recently bought my first Barling (pre-transition Canadian--a beautiful 
blast).

Since 3 Nuns was bought out and degraded (similarly with Rattrays), I've 
been smoking Butera's Virginia blend, which I get directly from him. No 
sooner did I discover Esoterica Tobacciana than they became inaccessible. 
The casualty rate among good tobaccos has been incredibly high.

Re the antismoking people, I've noticed that they never talk about pipes, 
only about cigarettes. However, what they most damn is the intrinsic 
malevolence of tobacco itself. At the heart of the argument is the 
passive smoking issue--one can't just say "Well, I'm free to poison myself 
if I want to and none of your damn business", because the argument is that 
we are poisoning everyone else too. How valid is the passive smoking 
argument re tobacco (we can disregard the additions of noxious non-tobacco 
substances--or can we?)? Is there a doctor in the house?

S. Slottow 

[ Read the front pages of any Cigar Aficionado for some appreciation
of how hard cigar smokers can be bashed. It's not just cigarettes.
And, re passive smoking, I'm of the opinion that classifying tobacco
smoke as a Class A carcinogen (up there with asbesdos and plutonium)
on the basis of a risk factor of 1.3 (down there with drinking whole
milk and keeping pet birds), makes about as much sense as classifying
ketchup as a vegetable. (But then, I'm no M.D., just a Ph.D. I just
wish I made as much. :-) -S. ]

BTW....would you mind subscribing me to your newsletter/forum/whatever it is?

Until the new group goes online, this is all we pipe-smokers have...

FAQ:  How threatening to cigars and pipes are the recent congressional 
attacks on cigarettes?  Do we have cause for alarm?

Subject: pipe pictures

A few weeks ago I commented that I had been sent .TIFF files of pipe
pictures.  They have all been compressed into a ZIP file and are
available via anonymous FTP. Rose-Hulman has established an FTP
server on a trial basis only so I don't know how long they will stay
there.  For those of you who are interested, you can FTP to
FTP.ROSE-HULMAN.EDU  to find pipes.zip in the \Pub\incoming\
[capitalization is exact] directory.  For those of you who are not
familiar with FTP transfers, contact tech services or drop me a note
for more information.

Well, we are now _solidly_ over the 300 mark. A lot of new membership
last week! I am also pleased to report that alt.smokers.pipes was
successfully created, and with the exception of one, ah, individual,
has been mostly flamage-free. Catch it if you can!

On the yucky side, this week also marks the first attempt to hose the
Digest. It wasn't a great attempt (certainly not in the league of the
Green Card Shyster Bandits :-) and may even be in the category of a
prank, but it did happen. This is why I keep the membership list
confidential. Details on request.

And, it seems, that now we're in kind of a Who's the Youngest on the
Digest contest... so far, the winner is 18. Any contenders for the
spot?

In any case, the congressional bashing has ceased for the moment, and
spring is in the air. And so, I hope, is the scent of a fine cigar or
a bowl of your favorite vernal terbakky! Enjoy, in moderation of
course, but first:

Subject: Re: Pipes Archive #139 - April 14, 1994

Hey there. In the last mailing, someone called me "presumptious" for 
allegedly creating alt.smokers.cigars too quickly, or something like 
that. Just for the record, I went through all the discussion process on 
the newsgroups where news administrators bash each other and anyone who 
wants to do something new. It was through that process that my creation 
wound up being called alt.smokers.cigars. If the objection is that I'd 
only been on the Net for 6 weeks before creating alt.smokers.cigars, I 
can only say that I saw a gap and moved to fill it. The success of the 
group suggests the gap I perceived was real. So there. :-) Rex

[ Now, now, boys. Don't fight, or Mr. Moderator is going to have to
pull out his scissors. :-) -S. ]

From: Daniel Sauder &lt;???????@???.????.???&gt;
Subject: inquiries

	First of all, Steve, I must announce that I am 18 years of age 
(lately I've been seeing many people announcing their ages in the 
digest), I must be the youngest pipe smoker.  

	Anyway, today's question(s) are concerning my Peterson.
Petersons are the very best, I belive.  However, I do not like the
Peterson steck bit (hole aimed at roof of mouth).  I find them (at
least on my 3/4 bent Peterson) difficult to draw on and the roof of my
mouth ends up blasted.  Also, since the tongue is where sense of taste
is, I would rather have the smoke hitting there.  Do you know if they
make regular wedge bits as alternitives?  If so, how can I order one?

	The second question concerning my Peterson is about the bowl.
It is short and squat, and has a problem with burning--I think the
tobacco only burns in the center.  I know this is probably because the
bowl is too wide--or is it because of something I'm doing wrong?  If I
puff harder and faster it probably will burn completely, but I
(knowing the fundementals) know that to truely enjoy the smoke one
must puff lightly and slowly.  So what am I to do, Steve?  I don't
want to waste tobacco in this half-burning bowl.
			
				HELP. 
Daniel Sauder ~\U

[ Even if Peterson doesn't make a wedge bit, perhaps somebody could
retrofit one for you. Re the center-only ignition, try moving the
match in a circle around the edge of the bowl for a charring light,
then tamp and relight. -S. ]

        Steve:  I am looking for a Porsche designed pipe.  Several years ago
        I saw one at a local Tinderbox but that store no longer exists.
        Does anyone out there know anything about these pipes and where I
        can find a new or pre-smoked one?  Also my brother is considering
        starting a classified mailing for pipe collectors listing items from
        low end to high,for sale, trade, or wanted.  If anyone out
	there would   
        be interested in subscribing write him at:  Fred Loveland 2605
        Albury Ave Deltona FLA 32738

[ Interesting on the Porsche pipe! And I'll include your brother's
address in the Resource Guide, if you'd like. -S. ]

Subject: Re: Pipes Mailing List

	Well, this will be my first submission to the list, as I just
subscribed and read through all of your tips and comments about smoking pipes
and tobaccos.  Seems like they will be helpful.  First a little bit about me;
I'm currently enrolled at Virginia Tech in the Computer Science department as
an undergraduate (yep, -under-graduate :-).  I haven't been smoking pipes but
for 5-6 months now, and prior to that I was an avid non-smoker.  I started out
with a pipe from a local tobacco shop (not the greatest of tobaccos, but
acceptable for a small southwestern Virginia town).  It's a plain briar with no
fills, but a coupple of cracks in the bowl (maybe I've been smoking it too
hot?).  I grew up with my father a heavy pipe smoker, and always liked the
aroma.  I had always wondered if it tasted as good as it smelled, and I figured
I would try it.  It may seem funny to be smoking a pipe at the age of 19, but
hey, I actually do enjoy it.  I was at first dismayed to find out how little
the pipe tasted like how it smelled.  But I decided I had made an investment
and I would continue with the hobby.  I've grown to like the taste a lot, and
the smell that hangs around a couple hours after I'm done.  My favorite
tobaccos are St.Bruno's Flake cut (in the square tin), and a blend called Billy
Budd which I found at the smoke shop in Annapolis; I'm gonna have to go have a
bowl of it after this message.  I really enjoy smoking a pipe, and have tried
smoking other things like cigars (of mediocre quality from what I am told), and
even some cigarettes.  While pipes don't give me  any "buzz" per se, I really
enjoy the effects it has on my mood.  Smoking a pipe puts me in a very
contemplative mood, and hey, it gets me away from the computer.  :-)  Enjoy
your pipes!

Subject: new alt group

Steve,
Congratulations!  No flamage (except for purposes you mentioned) and seemingly 
rapid propagation.  It arrived at my site this afternoon and I promptly 
subscribed.  It seemed fitting, too, because I had just returned from a local 
emporium with 2oz of Cavendish that I'll try this evening.

In the last mailing (Thursday, April 14), someone mentioned pipe
seconds.  On a recent trip to Boston, I noticed what basically looked
like "unfinished" seconds; much like unfinished furniture.  Each had a
few surface flaws and were, for lack of a better term, unpolished.  I
already have too many pipes for the amount of tobacco I consume, so I
didn't purchase one for the $20 they were asking, but I am curious.
It seems possible that one could try out an oddly shaped pipe without
spending too much money.

Turning to cigars for a moment, I read my wife Gregory Pease's note
from #138 where he cooked dinner for his date and afterwards she
suggested they share a cigar.  My wife became intrigued and subtly
suggested that I cook us a nice dinner during the week.  I agreed and
later that week prepared a nice, though not overly complex, pasta
dish.  Afterwards, she mentioned that I hadn't had a cigar in quite
some time.  When I brought out an Avo Pyramide, I was surprised that
she wanted to share; in fact, after she had had several puffs, she
didn't want to share much at all.  In the end, we spent a very
enjoyable evening amid her fragrant cigar smoke and some good wine.  A
night to remember.

Again, congrats on the newsgroup.
Bryan Embrey

[ And congrats to you, too, Bryan! You and Gregory could have opened
up a whole new vista of spousal tobak tolerance... -S. ]

Subject: Re: Moderated mailgroup for cigars, pipes, fine tobacco

[ Short note from Yours Truly to George deleted for space. -S. ]

Steve,

Thanks.  I look forward to it.  I don't see any attached intro guide, 
though.  I hope the different email address I gave you didn't cause any 
confusion.  I use this account (??????@?????.???.???.???) for most of the 
internet access, but I use a different account 
(??????@??????.???.???.???) for most of my email and I would prefer for 
the pipes mail to go to that (uncmvs) address.  Basically, this gibbs 
account is very limited in capacity and tends to max out with mailing 
list traffic.

If that's a problem however, the gibbs account will work.  I don't see any
intro on either account yet.  Perhaps it just hasn't worked its way
through the system. 

I am looking forward to it, though.  Coincidentally, I just broke the 
stem on a favorite pipe yesterday and was wondering where to get it 
repaired.  As pipe smoking has become less common, the good tobacco shops 
in my part of the world have closed down and I miss the sort of services 
they used to provide, like pipe repair.

Regards,
George

[ Again, George, there are a couple of good stem-repair places in the
Resource Guide. Welcome! -S. ]

Subject: digest

I guess I should introduce myself.  My name is Avik Roy, and I am a 21 year
old medical student at Yale University.  Many of my friends here at Yale 
are pipe smokers, and we have plenty of occasions at which to smoke.  
Judging from what I've read, we have it much better than most.

Here are two notable tobacconists which were not on your list:

David P. Erlich Company
32 Tremont Street
Boston, Mass.  02108
617/227-1720

(Erlich, founded in 1868, is the parent of Leavitt &amp; Pearce in Cambridge.)

The Owl Shop
268 College Street
New Haven, Conn.  06520
203/624-3250

(An outstanding collection of pipes, cigars, tobacco, and other gentlemen's 
products.)

[ Glad to hear that pipe-smoking academia is not dead in the Ivy
League, Avik! I visited Erlich's once, and agree that it's a must-do
if you're in Boston. -S. ]

From: "Mark D. Lamoree" &lt;???????@?????.??.???.???&gt;
Subject: Re: Pipes Digest

	Here is a brief autobiography:
	I am a nineteen year old political science major at Loyola 
University, Chicago.  This no doubt makes me the youngest member of this 
group.  I have been smoking pipes for a little over a 
year, since I was introduced to pipe smoking by my roomate.(Although I was 
pre-disposed to the habit, having grown up with a pipe smoking father.)  
I must point put, however, that my loyalties are split.  Although I enjoy 
a good pipe, I also smoke cigars as regularly as I can afford.
	Regarding the second-hand smoke issue, you should be aware of the 
history of the report which sparked this whole controversy.  That report 
was quashed several times because the science its conclusions were based 
on was so poor.  Because of political pressure, the report was finally 
released in an essentially unchanged form.  Thus, the entire controversy 
is based upon bad science and false conclusions.  I must say that the 
non-smoking fanatics remind me of the old definition of a puritan: a 
person who lives in constant terror that someone, somewhere is having fun.

[ Thanks for the intro and the info, Mark! A full history of the EPA
report would be most welcome. -S. ]

Sorry Steve, I was just displaying a gross ignorance of American 
geography.  I thought your header referred to the province New Brunswick 
(of which Fredericton is the capital).

Anyways, I just found the most glorious smoke shop I have ever seen.  
Pass it  along on the pipes newsletter if you wish.  It is called 
Clarke's Tobacconnists (sp?) in Gastown in Vancouver (at #3 Alexander 
Street).  It is well worth the trip.  A tad expensive but worth it.  eg. 
H. Uppman coronas were $9.50 plus tax (isn't Canada wonderful?).

Until later

NJ. Yes, indeed, Canada sounds wonderful, if you can get past the

Subject: Thanks--

for adding me to the list. I got to download the mail you dropped and found
it to be very interesting.

I've tried a pipe a few times and just never did get the hang of it. I guess
you'd have to classify me as a die-hard cigar smoker. My first cigar (at age
12) was a Tiparillo (yuk!!) and now i'm devoted to the pursuit of the cubans.
A friend brought back a box of Cohiba's from London and made me a
fan---quickly. My regular smoke is a Dannemann Espada. I know, it's dry-cured
and causes the true cigar lover to turn up his/her nose. But that's why there
are horse races too.

I saw a message from someone asking about the "Cigar Dinners".
For the last 2 years I've been a member of the Chicago Cigar Connisseurs ( I
live in KC ) and attend their annual dinner. The only thing I can say is,
it's a shame there are not more dinners like that one. REALLY great time.
I've met some interesting people too. I'd like to attend one of the dinners
at the Ritz-Carlton someday too.

Thanks again. Tim 

[ I'm sure some of our other readers would appreciate news of the
Chicago cigar scene, Tim! Do you have the CCCs' contact address? -S. ]

Steve:

I expire sooner than I thought.  Actually, my account ceases to exist as of
April 22nd.  I think my new address will be

?????????????@?????.?????????.???

based on others email addresses there.  I will send you mail in August
for sure to let you know.  The last digest was a treasure trove of
information.  Keep up the good work.  Hopefully when I return from
Europe, it won't be illegal to run a discussion group about banned
substances in the great ol' USA ;-).  Ah, one more reason to live up
here in Canada.

See ya later

Subject: Re: please add my name to pipe mail group

Thank you for adding me to the distribution list.  For a starter, let me
introduce myself.  My name is Toshihiko Murata.  I'm a graduate student at
University of Oregon, studying sociology.  I'm originally from Japan,
where it is almost impossible to get fine tobacco.  So coming to U.S. and
having a tobacconist near by is almost like a dream come true.  My
preferred tobacco that I can get from local tobacco store are No.25
Virginia from McClelland tobacco company, and Craven mixture.  I don't get
to smoke Craven mixture very often because my partner doesn't like the
"camp fire smell" of craven mixture.   Thank you again.  

toshihiko 

PS. Could you please send me couple of back issues?  Thanks you in advance. 

[ Back issues sent, Tosihiko. Enjoy! -S. ]

Subject: RE: Pipes Digest #140 - April 22, 1994

If Porsche-designed pipes are those weird blue or green metal space ship 
pipes, then John's Pipe Shop in Champaign, Illinois has some. I don't know 
their number, but get it from information and ask for Patrick (he's a state 
cop, and his mother works there during the day).

Re passive smoking: it seems the core of the antismoking argument. If the 
report (is there only one?) on which the argument is based on has been exposed 
as "bad science" then we need more information than simply that bald 
assertion. I would be most appreciative if someone would give a more full 
report than these one or two sentence mentions about the report, what "bad 
science" means in this instance, just what passive smoking is supposed to do 
to people, how its supposed to work, etc. It's no good urging people to 
write in protest without giving them solid information and arguments.

To change the subject--I'm almost out of my last can of Butera's Virginia 
blend. I'm going to reorder, but: have any Virginia-blend smokers tried his 
other two blends? Do you like them? I know their English, and I smoke 
Virginia, but the reviews have been so good...

Subject: Porsche Pipes &amp; American Spirit

Salve', all!

Subject: Porsche Design Pipes
&gt;        Steve:  I am looking for a Porsche designed pipe.  Several years ago
&gt;        I saw one at a local Tinderbox but that store no longer exists.
&gt;        Does anyone out there know anything about these pipes and where I
&gt;        can find a new or pre-smoked one?

	Ah, this was quite the suave unit, designed by "Butzi" Porsche
(designer of the original 904 and 911 models).  Altho' hard to tell,
it *was* made of briar (charred black), and the bowl was enshrouded
in a finned aluminum "cooling tower", looking much like the air-cooled
cylinders of a 911's engine.  The whole shape was smoothly contoured
to look like a wisp of smoke itself.  Damn expensive, too.  If it's
still made, you should be able to get it from any U.S. purveyor of
Porsche Design merchandise; look in some car magazines or upscale
magazines (like "Robb Report") for Porsche Design adverts.

&gt;Subject: American Spirit loose tobacco
	Actually, it's a coarse shag-cut meant for rolling cigarets,
methinks (the pouch comes with papers).  I did try packing my pipe
with it once; while austerely tasty, the nic buzz pinned me to my
chair for a good fifteen minutes afterward, such that I could hardly
even empty the spent bowl into the ashtray next to me!  It goes down
*much* better in a cigaret. %-}  Very clean, leafy flavour.

	Steve, if you would be so kind as to send me the lastest
updates of the resource guide, how-to, and whatever other side-orders
you have... danke schoen!

Subject: not PC - A New cigar club forms at Penn

I have been suffering from Influenza this past week or so, so I missed the
event (of course I didn't know about it until that morning, but that's
normal).  However, I managed to get yesterday's DP with a review of the first
meeting. Apparently co-sponsered by Holt's and Oulette (a French restaurant
in Liberty Place) and SAC sanctioned! They apparently got to somke cigars
in Houston Hall - amazing!

I've been off the keyboard for a week now, so I have a bit of catching up
to do. I'll send along the text of the DP article when I can as well as try
to track down the folks email addresses if they have any.

Subject: Hello

I think i have the whole problem figured out.  Your internet address is
being truncated when it comes through here, so that when i do an
automatic reply to your message, it is not going to a valid address.
Now the problem is why the truncation is occurring.  I just noticed this
this morning.  In fact it is onlyu a one letter difference.

Hope all is well with you, I have been putting in long hours, in fact am
at work and this is a saturday.  But with any luck at all the next
gazette issue will be going out in may as planned.

I heard on NPR that soon there is going to be advertising on
internet....this should really make the purists cringe.  Oh well, sooner
or later everything is commercialized.

take care,  Neil

Warning.  This article is a bit on the long side.  Light up now!

&gt;From: Bryan Embrey &lt;???????@????????.???.???&gt;
&gt;Subject: new alt group
&gt;[...]
&gt;Turning to cigars for a moment, I read my wife Gregory Pease's note
&gt;from #138 where he cooked dinner for his date and afterwards she
&gt;suggested they share a cigar.  My wife became intrigued and subtly
&gt;suggested that I cook us a nice dinner during the week.  I agreed and
&gt;later that week prepared a nice, though not overly complex, pasta
&gt;dish.  Afterwards, she mentioned that I hadn't had a cigar in quite
&gt;some time.  When I brought out an Avo Pyramide, I was surprised that
&gt;she wanted to share; in fact, after she had had several puffs, she
&gt;didn't want to share much at all.  In the end, we spent a very
&gt;enjoyable evening amid her fragrant cigar smoke and some good wine.  A
&gt;night to remember.
&gt;
&gt;Again, congrats on the newsgroup.
&gt;Bryan Embrey
&gt;
&gt;[ And congrats to you, too, Bryan! You and Gregory could have opened
&gt;up a whole new vista of spousal tobak tolerance... -S. ]

I can't tell you how pleased I am to have inspired Bryan (or his 
wife! ;) and anyone else who may have indulged themselves and their
mates to this most intimate of pleasures.  And a quick thanks to 
everyone who suggested I not let this woman "get away!"  All is
well, I'm happy to say!  (Hell, we've known each other for nearly
four years, though the romance part is still young.  I don't think 
she's going anywhere anytime soon.  We are having a bit of a chat
over whether we want two or three children, if that's any indication!)

And onward...

Last Tuesday I enjoyed my 36th birthday.  During a moment of reflection
over a bowl of Balkan Sobranie from the mid 1960's (in a 1918 Dunhill
Shell "O"...ahh!) I recounted the early days of my relationship to the
briar.  While still an impressionable young thing in middle school,
I had a teacher of sciences who smoked a pipe.  I admired this man,
and tried to emulate everything about him, thinking it would bring
me similar admiration.  I adopted his disheveled appearance, his 
propensity for careful speech, his consideration for the art and 
responsibility of science, and his constant companion, the pipe.  I
was 15 at the time.  

Once I had my first automobile (a 1960 Austin Healy Sprite in British
Racing Green), I abandoned the lab coat and pocket protector for a leather 
jacket, tweed cap and white scarf (still impressionable, after all).  
I suspect I still looked quite the fool, though, I'd like to think, in 
a much more rogueish fashion.  I didn't, however, abandon the pipe.  It's 
not that I really enjoyed the bloody thing, but it had become an integral
part of my costume!  In fact, it tasted dreadful!  (I still have that
pipe, and it still tastes dreadful!)

Once I entered University, I chanced upon the tobacconist from which
my mother had procured my uncle's cigars when I was a wee lad.  The
smell brought back many memories, so I struck up a conversation with
the proprietor.  Once he discovered what sort of pipe I was smoking
(the horror) and what sort of tobacco I dared to fill it with (great
horror of all horrors!) he took me under his wing, convinced that I 
could be cured.  He guided me to a Charatan second, a sandblast 
yachtsman for which I paid about $18, and a tin of a rich, full blend
of Oriental and Virginia tobaccos, with more than a hint of Latakia
for good measure.  I found the roadmap to the sublime on that day.  I
went to work for fellow, restoring pipes, blending tobacco and learning
everything I could from him.  I was able to acquire the beginning
of my collection, and develop an almost spiritual, and quite alchemical 
relationship to fine briars and tobaccos.  

Sadly, this sort of story is becoming an all but dead artifact of a 
more gentle era.  I was working a couple of years ago at Drucquer and 
Sons, developing a new blend or two, when a woman came back to see what 
I was so obviously happy about.

I was up to my elbows in fragrant Latakia and Virginias, and obviously
experiencing the sort of bliss which causes some to play with snakes
and speak in tongues.  She looked into my eyes and asked if I really
liked doing this.  I tried to tell her of the feeling of connection
it gave me to the land and the skies, of the sensory pleasures of
smelling and touching and tasting the beautifully aged leaf, of the
palette of colours from golden yellow to rich brown and shiny black.
I told her of the delight in filling a bowl with the concoction I 
had created and setting it alight, to fill mouth and air with delicate
smoke, to warm the hand on a cool winter's night, to find solace and
companionship even when no one else heed the call.  She shook her
head and walked away, waving the anti-smoker's salute in front of her
sensorally maladjusted proboscis.  

The war against tobacco is not new.  In 1604, King James I published
the famous "Counterblaste to Tobacco," and banned the cultivation and
use of tobacco in England.   Neither has this war ever been won, and 
all prohibitions have ultimately been overturned through popular
pressures.  We are part of the populace, and as such, must stand up
and be counted.

We are a coterie who must continue our tradition, and celebrate the 
hobby and romance of the weed.  We can never convert the malevolent 
soothsayers of doom to the understanding that ours is not a dastardly 
plot to create havok in their brachea, but a reflection and appreciation 
of the things that life brings us.  If we keep in mind the joy of our
little celebrations, perhaps we can each change a little piece of the 
world.

Smoke in peace,
Gregory

[ And speaking of wars against tobacco, didn't the king of Germany
once try to outlaw it ... and fail badly? -S. ]

From: ???????@??????.????????.??? (Doug Nelson)
Subject: introduction

first off, let me say steve, this is a wonderful idea.  until i saw that 
there was a pipe smokers internet group it had never dawned on me how much i 
miss the chance to discuss pipes and tobacco.

second, i know this is 'pipes digest' but is there an interactive form (one 
letter at a time)?  not only do i enjoy reading and answering in that 
format, but for some reason my reader chokes when i try to reply to an 
included letter.

ok, on to the personal stuff.
my name is doug nelson (???????@??????.????????.???)
i am 34 years old and an undergraduate at university of missouri-columbia.  
i would normally make a big deal out of how old i was to be an undergrad, or 
how young i was when i started pipe smoking (16), but i see both of these 
areas have been paved.

i own about 15 pipes, with no real pattern, but i guess petersen's are in 
the majority.  i prefer bents, the bigger the better.  currently i am down 
to 3 pipes, with the rest being held for ransom until a divorce is finalized.

i stopped smoking cold turkey when the report on second hand smoke came out. 
 i figured it was a pleasant hobby, but not work endangering other people's 
lives.  after about 5 or so years i find myself living alone (see previous 
paragraph) and have picked it back up again.

i would like to reply to some of the letters in the intro, but as i said, my 
reader choked.  someone mentioned the disadvantages of a petersen bit.  i 
find my palate a little raw myself sometimes, but overall i really enjoy the 
bit.  i like biting down, and its the only one i've found that could take 
it.  (most of my pipes are on their second or even third bit, except for the 
petersens.  well, except for one petersen &lt;G&gt;)

my favorite tobacco is a lane blend that goes by different names depending 
on which shop you go to.  it usually has 'bl' or 'burley light' somewhere in 
the name.  it is a very light aromatic that somehow manages to keep a full 
body.  i can smoke it virtually non-stop with no unpleasant side effects.  
should someone accidentally get a whiff of it (as i said, i try to avoid 
smoking around others) the response is invariably favorable.  btw, if anyone 
has a mail order source for this blend, please let me know.  i've tried many 
catalogs (though by no means everyone listed in the intro) with no success.  
this is a small town, hours away from a larger one, and has only one tobacco 
shop, which is growing smaller and increasingly unreliable.

someone mentioned their pipe keeping them away from the keyboard.  between 
the petersen bit and the light tobacco, i don't have this excuse.  &lt;breaks 
to relight&gt;  actually, i've never had the opportunity to compare pipe 
smoking habits with anyone else (see first paragraph).  i find i smoke about 
a pound of tobacco a month.  how does this stack up with the other readers?

i will break it off here, otherwise no one will even bother reading, let 
alone responding.  i look forward to receiving the digest, and perhaps 
corresponding with others.

Subject: Re: Moderated mailgroup for cigars, pipes, fine tobacco

I hope this is the right address.  I'm a long time pipe smoker, who once 
worked in a pipe shop when younger.  I enjoy the English tobaccos, and
tend to add a bit of extra perique and Latakia, and if in the mood, a
bit of very strong slice.

Also, I am selling off part of my pipe collection, some of which are very
high quality.  I'll send a list to anyone who asks (I left it off to save
bandwidth).  I'm not purely selling it, I'll consider trades for Mac soft-
ware or hardware (noted on the list).

Subject: Hello

I talked with Steve Johnson, he said it is ok for you to reprint his
article on the clinton health plan in the pipes newsletter.  He recently
got AOL so he will be soon sending you a note to receive the mailing.
He is currently writing a second article for the may issue of the
gazette.  Which you will probably also want to circulate in this forum.

BTW, what was happening, the SME bullitin board apparently was
truncating the "M" from siemens.com.  So when ever i would do an
automatic reply, or reference the address as i was seeing it, the thing
would bounce back to me as undeliverable.

Taske care,  Neil

Subject: Seconds

Hi Steve,
	Just wanted to comment on the quality of some of the seconds o
out there. I have always used the same Irish Second with a very light
finish. It has only one slight imperfection and smokes very cool and smooth.
Just wanted to let anyone know that if they're looking for a good pipe 
for under $50, they shouldn't dismiss a good second just by word of mouth
(it seems some people hate them). Also had a question....how does a good
Meershaum (sp?) smoke compared to a briar? I looked into this before I 
bought my briar but have since forgotten. 

Thanks!

Subject: The book I Read

Just thought I would write to mention a book I thought all of you may be
interested in.  It is called "Smoking and Society:  Toward a More Balanced
Assessment" Robert Tollison, ed.  (Lexington Books  1986.  ISBN
0-669-11603-3)  The book is a series of essays written by various people in
relation to smoking and the social ramifications related to it.  Hans Eysenck
(the famous psychologist, which really impressed me since I am a psychology
major) presents the first essay about smoking and health, concluding that the
grounds the AMA and other medical establishments have made on the basis of
smoking and disease are not as strong as they would have you believe.  Other
essays focus on the Health Issues and Passive Smoking, The Social Role of
Smoking, Smoking, Human Rights, and Civil Liberties, The Incidence of Taxes
on Tobacco, and A Sociological View of the Antismoking Phenomenon.  The book
itself is not "light" reading by any stretch, but in consideration of the
activites taken against smokers in modern society it might prove to be useful
for counterattacks.  I happened to find a copy ofthis book for only 5
dollars, and if anyone would be interested in getting a copy, let me know and
I would be happy to try and get a copy for you at the store I obtained it
from.  I would send it cost + shipping, which would put it around 10 dollars
or so (which is sill less than the cover price of any hard bound books
today).  Just thought you might be interested.
     I was wondering if anyone knew of a good cleaner for the outside of
pipes.  The rim of some of mine have become stained through smoking, and I
would like to clean that off if it is possible without ruining the finish or
the pipe.  Any suggestions?
      Also, does anyone know a good place to obtain a calabash pipe?  I can't
seem to find them in any of the stores around here.  I thought it would make
an interesting addition to the collection I have currently.

[ Thanks for the book info, Lenrd! I remember seeing calabashes for
sale, but not where I saw them... any info, readers? -S. ]

Subject: RE: Pipes Digest #141 - April 29, 1994

I enjoyed Gregory's post, pointing out the positive aesthetics of pipe 
smoking. Today I was listening to the radio: first there was an interview 
with an antiabortion activist, who kept saying to the abortion doctor who 
was also being interviewed "I hope you stop this grisly practice to which 
you have devoted your life" and kept interrupting, saying "abortion is 
murder." Then there was an interview with the lawyer representing the couple
who recently bought into a condominium and are suing the people underneath 
them for smoking--evidently the deadly fumes are permeating their apartment. 
A caller started berating the lawyer for his wishy-washy attitude towards 
stamping out tobacco (the caller was evidentally allergic to tobacco fumes), 
and stated that smokers have no right to smoke in their own apartments 
unless they belonged to an exclusive smokers-only apartment house. He
stated that all smokers should be evicted from their apartments (on that 
ground alone) and that within a decade compulsory housing segregation 
for smokers will be realized.

This man's tone of aggressive outrage was very similar to the abortion 
advocate's tone. I am not advocating abortion (or not advocating it, for 
that matter), but pointing to the similarity in goals and styles. If this 
man was allergic to pollen, or dust, or industrial fumes, or anything else, 
he would never attack it with the same ferocity and self-righteousness. He 
reminded me of someone advocating the extermination of a depraved and 
hopelessly evil race--very much like the Nazi attitude towards Jews. I 
don't think I'm exaggerating at all.

Thanks for the member who posted the book information. I will get in touch 
with him--I'd like to have some hard information.

Re meerschaums v. briar. A while ago, thinking I really should try a 
meerschaum, I bought I very nice uncarved slightly bent billiard shape. After 
4 or 5 smokes, I picked up a briar again, and then smoked another briar... 
it's still languishing in my desk drawer. I just can't get interested. I 
guess that what I really like about pipes is the grain and the blast (and 
the flavor, of course). Meerschaums don't have any grain, and the mild 
flavor lacks the distinctive and stronger character of briar, to my mind. Or 
maybe it all comes down to habit. I also like the durability of briar, the 
sense that I can just put it in my jacket pocket and go out for a walk.

Regarding the burn marks on the top of the bowl. I have gotten into the 
habit of wiping them off with a hankerchief before they dry--this ruins the 
hankerchief but has kept the top of my smooth bowls pretty clean and shiny. 
It won't work if the top of the bowl is blasted.

-Stephen Slottow

[ Stephen, thanks for your comments. Did you call the station and let
them know that persecution is _never_ right? If not, I'd encourage you
to do so next time. Unless we defend our rights, we're going to lose
them.

BTW, I'm glad I wasn't the only one to notice the similarity in
tactics between the antismokers and the antiabortionists. The issues
really are the same -- the right to control one's own body. -S. ]

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #141 - April...

I have been smoking cigars for about two and half years now, but as a result
of joining the pipes digest decided to try smoking a pipe.  I purchased an
inexpensive briar, with a straight shank.  I sampled several of my
tobacconists blends and found them most enjoyable.  My only problem is i
can't keep the darn thing lit for more than few minutes.  Also, how long do
you smoke a pipe?  I was told not to smoke the "moist dottle", how do I know
if I am infact smoking said "dottle".  Thanks in advance for any help.

[ I can send you the "How-To" guide... Dottle is what's left after you
smoke. If it's VERY wet, don't smoke it. -S. ]

Subject: My first time

Well I finally broke down and purchased a pipe.  I had resisted the urge for 
this long because I couldn't afford to put out the $40-$50 for a pipe and 
$12-$15 for 50 g. of tobacco.  Yesterday my fast was broken.  I had some 
money in the bank and found a store who was willing to let me part with 
my capital reserves (kind of strange don't you think?).  I found a single 
dot Brigham for $27 and tried a black and brown cavendish mix to 
accompany it ($11.19 for 50g. sorry people my mind has been twisted from 
an early age -metric system- and I have difficulty speaking in standard 
measures).  I was even able to use some of the wealth of knowledge given 
out in a previous pipes digest by Chris (aka. ????@?????? I believe it 
was).  My profuse thanks your info. was very helpful and much appreciated.

I probably looked a little foolish trying to figure out the best way to 
hold the pipe when I returned home and tried to start it up but my 
Scottish ancestry forced me to  continue through the fumblings.  I see 
what you mean when you say there is an art to keeping a pipe lit (I went 
through an entire pack of matches).   I packed the top half to loosely and 
the  bottom to tight but after I was finished... one question for 
myself...what was I waiting for?  I sat outside (I am not allowed to 
smoke cigars and/or pipes inside - S.O's rule #225) for about an hour.  

Pure pleasure!

My S.O. checked on me several times to see if I had finished yet.  With 
each of her checks her warnings of impending headaches and upset stomach 
became more dire.  "I used to smoke and my first cigarette made me sick 
to my stomach", was one of her favorites.  I tried to explain that I 
wasn't inhaling the smoke and, therefore, wouldn't suffer the same 
effects as she did when she first started her habit (she has since 
quit).  She knew what she was talking about though so she wouldn't hear 
any of my apologetics.  Apart from the interruptions, I had one of the best 
hours I had ever had the pleasure of living through.  I even was able to 
tempt a friend out of the house to smell the smoke (his father smokes a 
pipe and cigars so he came out to relive some memories).  This of course 
promted remarks about "men" and "male bonding" but we weathered the assault.

I'll end off with a question.  I have smoked many cigars and if I had 
tried to go for an hour long session with one of them, I would be green.  
How is pipe tobacco different from cigar tobacco?

BTW I didn't even get a twinge in my belly from the cavendish.  In fact, 
I wanted to go back for more.  However, I was able to control my 
desires;  you know, too much of a good thing and all that rot.

Thank you one and all for the info.

    (sorry no age records broken here) 

P.S.  I recently purshased a Dominican "Wassle" the shopkeeper said it 
was similar to a robusto.  It may have been a bad box but I had not even 
got 3/4" off the cigar and I lost the wrapper.  It just came of in my 
hands.  Tastewise, the cigar was acceptable, nothing special but not 
bad.  It was light and cool, coffee-like.  Anyways, I suppose you get 
what you pay for ($3 for a cigar up North is cheap).  Be careful if you 
run across something similar.  Spend the extra dollar or two and get a Punch.

Subject: Some words from Twain

Well, this certainly is an interesting newsgroup.  Having read it since
the outset, all this talk of Havanas, Macanudos, and the like have made my
head spin.  It seems that Cigar Aficionado (published by the same people
who created instant wine experts via Wine Spectator) has had an extreme
influence on several impressionable new smokers.  Therefore, to strike a
balance and waste a little bandwidth, the following article, written by
one of America's most notorious smokers, is provided for those who have
not yet had an opportunity to read it. 

Please E-mail your protestations; I'm off for Graycliff tomorrow and 
won't be back in time to read them here.

Essays by Mark Twain

CONCERNING TOBACCO

As concerns tobacco, there are many superstitions.  And the
chiefest is this--that there is a STANDARD governing the matter,
whereas there is nothing of the kind.  Each man's own preference
is the only standard for him, the only one which he can accept,
the only one which can command him.  A congress of all the
tobacco-lovers in the world could not elect a standard which
would be binding upon you or me, or would even much influence us.

The next superstition is that a man has a standard of his own.
He hasn't.  He thinks he has, but he hasn't.  He thinks he can
tell what he regards as a good cigar from what he regards as a
bad one--but he can't.  He goes by the brand, yet imagines he goes
by the flavor.  One may palm off the worst counterfeit upon him;
if it bears his brand he will smoke it contentedly and never suspect.

Children of twenty-five, who have seven years experience,
try to tell me what is a good cigar and what isn't.
Me, who never learned to smoke, but always smoked;
me, who came into the world asking for a light.

No one can tell me what is a good cigar--for me.  I am the
only judge.  People who claim to know say that I smoke the worst
cigars in the world.  They bring their own cigars when they come
to my house.  They betray an unmanly terror when I offer them
a cigar; they tell lies and hurry away to meet engagements
which they have not made when they are threatened with the
hospitalities of my box.  Now then, observe what superstition,
assisted by a man's reputation, can do.  I was to have twelve
personal friends to supper one night.  One of them was as
notorious for costly and elegant cigars as I was for cheap and
devilish ones.  I called at his house and when no one was looking
borrowed a double handful of his very choicest; cigars which cost
him forty cents apiece and bore red-and-gold labels in sign of
their nobility.  I removed the labels and put the cigars into a
box with my favorite brand on it--a brand which those people all
knew, and which cowed them as men are cowed by an epidemic.  They
took these cigars when offered at the end of the supper, and lit
them and sternly struggled with them--in dreary silence, for
hilarity died when the fell brand came into view and started
around--but their fortitude held for a short time only; then they
made excuses and filed out, treading on one another's heels with
indecent eagerness; and in the morning when I went out to observe
results the cigars lay all between the front door and the gate.
All except one--that one lay in the plate of the man from whom I
had cabbaged the lot.  One or two whiffs was all he could stand.
He told me afterward that some day I would get shot for giving
people that kind of cigars to smoke.

Am I certain of my own standard?  Perfectly; yes, absolutely
--unless somebody fools me by putting my brand on some other kind
of cigar; for no doubt I am like the rest, and know my cigar by
the brand instead of by the flavor.  However, my standard is a
pretty wide one and covers a good deal of territory.  To me,
almost any cigar is good that nobody else will smoke, and to me
almost all cigars are bad that other people consider good.
Nearly any cigar will do me, except a Havana.  People think they
hurt my feelings when then come to my house with their life
preservers on--I mean, with their own cigars in their pockets.
It is an error; I take care of myself in a similar way.  When I
go into danger--that is, into rich people's houses, where, in the
nature of things, they will have high-tariff cigars, red-and-gilt
girded and nested in a rosewood box along with a damp sponge,
cigars which develop a dismal black ash and burn down the side
and smell, and will grow hot to the fingers, and will go on
growing hotter and hotter, and go on smelling more and more
infamously and unendurably the deeper the fire tunnels down
inside below the thimbleful of honest tobacco that is in the
front end, the furnisher of it praising it all the time and
telling you how much the deadly thing cost--yes, when I go into
that sort of peril I carry my own defense along; I carry my own
brand--twenty-seven cents a barrel--and I live to see my family
again.  I may seem to light his red-gartered cigar, but that is
only for courtesy's sake; I smuggle it into my pocket for the
poor, of whom I know many, and light one of my own; and while he
praises it I join in, but when he says it cost forty-five cents I
say nothing, for I know better.

However, to say true, my tastes are so catholic that I have
never seen any cigars that I really could not smoke, except those
that cost a dollar apiece.  I have examined those and know that
they are made of dog-hair, and not good dog-hair at that.

I have a thoroughly satisfactory time in Europe, for all
over the Continent one finds cigars which not even the most
hardened newsboys in New York would smoke.  I brought cigars with
me, the last time; I will not do that any more.  In Italy, as in
France, the Government is the only cigar-peddler.  Italy has
three or four domestic brands:  the Minghetti, the Trabuco, the
Virginia, and a very coarse one which is a modification of the
Virginia.  The Minghettis are large and comely, and cost three
dollars and sixty cents a hundred; I can smoke a hundred in seven
days and enjoy every one of them.  The Trabucos suit me, too; I
don't remember the price.  But one has to learn to like the
Virginia, nobody is born friendly to it.  It looks like a rat-
tail file, but smokes better, some think.  It has a straw through
it; you pull this out, and it leaves a flue, otherwise there
would be no draught, not even as much as there is to a nail.
Some prefer a nail at first.  However, I like all the French,
Swiss, German, and Italian domestic cigars, and have never cared
to inquire what they are made of; and nobody would know, anyhow,
perhaps.  There is even a brand of European smoking-tobacco that
I like.  It is a brand used by the Italian peasants.  It is loose
and dry and black, and looks like tea-grounds.  When the fire is
applied it expands, and climbs up and towers above the pipe, and
presently tumbles off inside of one's vest.  The tobacco itself
is cheap, but it raises the insurance.  It is as I remarked in
the beginning--the taste for tobacco is a matter of superstition.
There are no standards--no real standards.  Each man's preference
is the only standard for him, the only one which he can accept,
the only one which can command him.

Subject: Pipes Digest comments

Well, it's not about the Pipes Digest exactly.  It has to do with
the anti-smoking initiatives.  I hope it's not too far off the
subject, but I've noticed a marked similarity in the arguments
both for and against smoking compared to the arguments concerning
gun control.  Does it make you suspect (as it does to me) that
the anti-smoking crowd has seen some success against the Bill of
Rights and thus concludes (correctly) that if the Constitution
can be assaulted, wouldn't the same tactics be effective against
smoking, which does not have near the same level of guarantee
as the right to keep and bear arms?

Now, I think that commercial American cigarettes stink, but I
still can't bring myself to support banning them because I don't
like them.  Hell, I don't like oysters either.  And they can
harm folks as well as anything.  Go for it, if you want.  It's
your choice.

On the other hand, I appreciate a good cigar and a rare pipe of
quality tobacco.  But lots of people don't, so I'm careful of
the smoke, including wind direction.  I'll do my best to look
out for your space if you agree to do the same for me.

OK, OK, I'm probably preaching to the choir.  But check out for
yourself how similar are the tactics.  Am I just seeing things?

Subject: mailing list

Steve, you might as well keep me on the list with original address. What I
wondered was if you ever received my lenthy letter in which I told of my pipe
smoking experiences and likes. I was 69 in February and have been smoking a
pipe since I was 17, and cigars also. While in high school, I worked after
school in the train years of the New Haven railroad in Stamford, Conn. and
there was no smoking in the shops, and since I wasn't about to chew tobacco, I
chewed on cigars instead, and then began smoking them on my breaks and after
work. Since those days, I have come to appreciate good pipes, cigars, and
tobacco. One of the sources you didn't list was Fader's of Baltimore, whose
shop in Annapolis I shop at. Great walk-in cigar humidor with greater cigars. I
have been smoking a mixture of Fader's called Barrister, which has both Perique
and Latakia but not to an overwhelming amount. I also used to shop in another
great pipe store in Annapolis, The Smoke Shop, which has a tobacco called Black
and Gold which is a heavier perique/latakia mixture. I rarely go there anymore,
I'm sad to say, because it is downtown where parking is very difficult. I'll
have to go back soon, but as long as my tobacco and cigars last, no trip for a
while. Meanwhile, keep up the list and the news. I enjoy them both, and let's
confound the antismoking zealots, who are worse than the worst Puritans in our
history. Ben Frank

Subject: The War

&gt; The war against tobacco is not new.  In 1604, King James I published
&gt; the famous "Counterblaste to Tobacco," and banned the cultivation and
&gt; use of tobacco in England.   Neither has this war ever been won, and 
&gt; all prohibitions have ultimately been overturned through popular
&gt; pressures.  We are part of the populace, and as such, must stand up
&gt; and be counted.

In my brief studies of the history of anti-smoking movements over the
last 150 years in this country, all have ultimately been overturned
by the onset of a major (civil or world) war.

Subject: Re: Dayton Hamfest

Hi Steve.
Well I got a couple of replies on my suggestion, but no turn out
at Dayton. I think the short notice and crummy weather (warm and wet 
Friday; cold and wet Saturday; cold and wet and windy Sunday) might
have been a factor. Saw a fair number of cigar 'totin hams, though.
Maybe next year I'll see if I can get the two cigar shops in town to
throw in some freebies. THEN there will be some interest, I bet.

BTW, there is a TinderBox in the Dayton Mall, and a nice little
tobacconist on Main Street about 3rd Ave. downtown (which unfortunately
was closed on Saturday).

73,
Mark

[ Sorry there wasn't a meeting of the Smoked Hams, Mark! BTW, re
Tinder Boxes and the Resource Guide, I put all reco-ed shops in the
RG. Nothing against Tinder Boxes. In fact, I'm glad for _any_
tobacconist who manages to stay open these days, esp. those who tough
it out in the malls... -S. ]

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #141 - April 29, 1994

Greetings, On the subject of American Spirit Tobacco I believe it is a 
cigarette variety. I was turned on to it on the last day of one of my 
computer classes. I was speaking with the assistant about the class and 
maybe ways of improving it when he pulls out this pouch and rolls himself 
a cigarette, I asked him what he smoked and he showed me the American 
Spirit label. We started talking about tobaccos and I decided to try a 
puff on his cigarette which he offered. I found it very tasty and 
needless to say I keep some with me when I don't have time to smoke my 
pipe. (I use a rolling machine by the way, my skills at hand rolling are 
poor to say the least:&gt;)

Also, This man offered me a job as a computer consultant. So I guess 
smoking can lead to good things :&gt;

[ As I've always asserted, Adam! -S. ]

Subject: Cigar &gt; Davidoff Zino "Mouton Cadet"

It has been a while since I last contributed, I am happy to share with my
fellow cigar smokers a true gem... The Zino Mouton Cadet.

I found this thin, solidly packed Zino at the Davidoff shoppe on Montreal's
Sherbrooke Street West. What a fabulous, full bodied taste! Not a touch of acidity (unlike a awful dannemann that I also tried). That after-taste reminds me of
delicious black forest cake, though less aggresive, the taste lingers rather
than invade your palate. I can not recommend this cigar more highly.

Now that bad part... The cigar was 'on special', reduced from $Can 15- to
$Can 8-.... Add our 15.6% vat and your looking at about $Can 9.20 for a
6 inch by 3/8 inch cigar. Such price, heaven!

The Dannemann was equal in proportion, but at $Can 2.75, a cheap smoke, imagine
sucking on the exhaust of a diesel bus... But in terms of sheer annoyance power
("Whaddya mean i can't smoke seegars here, god dammit.. Puff puff ack ack ack)
it is hiroshima in a leaf.

Steve -- 

NOPE - That was the Tinderbox at Stanford Mall. Gone now, I'm afraid. A
victim of the precarious financial status of the Tinderbox chain. The
story, as I heard it, is that the mall wouldn't renew the lease, since the
chain (and franchising organization - ie: the Tinderbox) needed to be on
the lease, and they were in some type of financial difficulty
(bankruptcy?).

Sad story. The Stanford Tinderbox had a very good selection, although a
little pricey.  I bought both an ODA Shell and group 6 smooth finish in the
months before they closed.

Subject: Re Age of Pipe Smokers

I started smokeing a pipe when I was about 18 yrs and stopped when I was 39 yrs
(do to pressure from my wife and work) but just recently started up again.
I smoke about 2 to 3 bowls a day  from a briar or a corn cob,I still have all
my pipes but except for the two that I smoke the rest are packed away for when
I want to get at them.
I find that its very relaxing after a days work  or sitting outside during the
evening, Half &amp; Half is my staple smoke.

Subject: Re:  Internet Pipes mailgroup

Hi there,

I've joined this mailgroup to get some advice; my local machine does not get
the usenet newsgroup alt.smokers.cigars.  I'm a fairly recent cigar smoker,
and I've been forced, due to price restrictions, to limit myself to the
cheaper boxed cigars.  I've been advised by local tobacconists that "There are
only two sorts of cigars: Cuban, and the rest", and that "Dutch cigars aren't
really much chop", a statement with which I'm beginning to agree.

However, by the time good quality Cuban cigars reach these shores, the costs
of freight and import duties mean that the resulting prices are far more than
I can justify spending.  An understanding tobacconist, to whom I confided my
plight, put me onto Villiger cigars, a box of which I'm currently enjoying.
And here's my question -- what other cheap type cigars are worth my trying?  I
like (as far as I can tell) a relatively mild cigar, but one with a bit of
flavour.  I don't like cigars that taste like the after-effects of a bush
fire; that is to say, I like the cigar to have a "refined" sort of taste.  (I
wish I knew more, so that I could be more explicit).  Also, I don't like
cigars that are too big, or that take too long to smoke; about 20--30 minutes
is enough for me.

Do please let me know of anything that I might try.  On the other hand, if
anybody has any material about cigars, available electronically, I would be
delighted to receive such material via email, or be told how to acquire it via
anonymous ftp.

With regard to pipes (since this seems to be that main topic of this
mailgroup), I tried pipe smoking about ten years ago (I'm now 33), and enjoyed
it.  My main peeve was that they kept going out, and I kept having to relight
them.  What I liked was the long stemmed clay pipes which not only cooled the
tobacco nicely, but were pleasant to hold.  I never made any real discoveries
as to which sort of tobacco I liked.  Maybe one day I'll go back to pipe
smoking again, but at the moment, I'm more interested in cigars, about which
any advice would be most gratefully received.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Subject: How to find a damn good cigar?

Greetings to all.
	I live with three other guys here at Marquette, and in the last week we
have smoked about fifty cigars between the four of us.  What a week!  Most of
them have been Fuentes.  We have discovered that Uhle's (our local cigar and
pipe haven) sells Fuente seconds for about half the price of the regulars. 
What joy!

	Two QUESTIONS:

	1) I live in Milwaukee.  Where can I find a supplier for La Gloria
Cubana Torpedos?  A friend of mine thinks these are the best cigars he ever
smoked.  (I'm not sure what to think after the Twain essay.)

	2) There is a famous pipe shop in Michigan. Bill's Pipe shop?
Is this right?  Does anyone have information on this?  Address?
Phone?  Fax?  Latitude?  Longitude?

Post AND/OR send to ????????????@???.???.??.???

Thanks, David

[ Answered somewhat in the mail -- the pipe shop is Paul's in Flint,
MI, and there's an active cigar club in Milwaukee (Milwaukee Cigar
Society at Edward's Tobacconist) that was mentioned in Cigar
Aficionado. Anyone else have other ideas to pass on? -S. ]

Subject: Hello and goodbye

I figured I'd write a short letter of introduction. I wish I had found
this group earlier but at least I have found it now. I will be going away
for the summer but I'll be back in August. So, my name is Adrienne but
every one calls me Andie. I'm an English major with a Women's Studies minor
at New Mexico State University. I'm 19 and have only been smoking a pipe
  for a short time. I have always loved the look and smell of a pipe so I
decided to try one. I admit that I do get some strange looks because I am
a woman. I go to a pretty conservative school where traditional gender
roles are the norm. A woman smoking a pipe goes against the norm. Smoking
is a way to relax and I refuse to give that up because of convention. I am
in the process of looking for a first pipe that is right for me. Right now
I borrow a friend's pipe or smoke a corn cob. I have my eye on a few and
am really excited about actually buying my first pipe. I guess that's it.
This will probably be my only message until August( I don't know how I'll
get along without email). So, smoke well everyone! 

Andie Rigler

[ Glad to have you here, Andie, and please check in again next August
when you get the email back! -S. ]

&gt;It won't work if the top of the bowl is blasted.

I think the issue here is not burn marks. They wouldn't go away, just using
the hankerchief. Only way to avoid those, are sticking to the ol' wooden
matches or a pipe lighter. It's almost impossible to avoid burning the top,
when using an ordinary type lighter (vertical flame type).
The brown/black substance building up on the top of the bowl, originate from
the burning tobacco. This is easily removed. No need to ruin your hankerchief.
Water is the magic dissolver. A Kleenex, napkin or anything alike, moistened
with water, or even saliva, will do the trick. Just don't let the bowl top
get too dirty. Frequent cleening is esential. This will even work on a sand-
blasted pipe.
If you like your (smooth) pipe-top real shiney, just rub it with a piece of
plain Xerox paper, after the water cure. Voila...

Happy smoking.

&gt;BTW, I'm glad I wasn't the only one to notice the similarity in
&gt;tactics between the antismokers and the antiabortionists. The issues
&gt;really are the same -- the right to control one's own body. -S. ]

Steve,

I am writing in response to the above statements.

I disagree with both.   The tactics the antismokers use are 
scare tactics based on altered E.P.A. data (I'm speaking of the changing
of the confidence factors.).  The tactics the antiabortionists use (at
least the ones with whom I work) are based on presenting the facts which
are available through genetics, biochemistry, and classical physics.  There
is an immeasureable difference between someone "lighting up" and enjoying
tobacco and someone getting an abortion.  These issues are not even close
to being the same.  As for the right to control one's own body, may I 
please point out two things: first, I know of no example in
the history of Western Civilization which provides precedence for this
alleged "right"; second, even if the availability of abortions were controlled,
this would not alter in any way the "right" of the woman to control her body.
It would simply make her responsible for her actions. 

There have recently been a few books published by people who have left the
abortion industry.  What they relate is rather grisly; in fact,it's nothing 
short of frightening.  Just as the antismokers who don't want you to know
about the 29 reports which found no reasonable evidence to link second hand
smoke with cancer, the abortion industry doesn't want you to know the facts.
They have much to hide.

Try one of the books.

Joe

WEll. Here's a profile for you all. ( hope this works. ) I live in Columbis
Ohio ( usa ) Got into pipes and cigars via a freind who worked for the Tinder
Box. Have a hard time keeping the pipe lit,  so I have a great respect now
for the convenience of the cigar. Beyond that, ( and unk=like a cigarrette
which one would smoke at any occasion as an afterthought, the cigar or pipe
is a calculated event in itself. There is a ceremony to it. It requires
thought. We live in an increasingly homogenized world, where corporations
ceate the rituals and decide the  rythms by which we live our lives. Missing
are the rituals and traditions of the individual. Like the use of a mug and
brush to shave with ( including it's obligatory stirring and more stirring ),
Cigar and pipe smoking offers the individual a chance to take back a measure
of control to thier lives through personal ritual. And very few things in the
modern world can lay claim to that ability. I hope this expresses some of
what other pipe and cigar smokers feel. If it rings true, e-mail me at :
 ???????@???.???
To all of you around the globe ( literally )  Peace to all of us. We are as
much the future as the past.  GIdeonH :-)

&gt;does not get the usenet newsgroup alt.smokers.cigars.  I'm a fairly
&gt;recent cigar smoker, and I've been forced, due to price
&gt;restrictions, to limit myself to the cheaper boxed cigars.  I've
&gt;been advised by local tobacconists that "There are only two sorts of
&gt;cigars: Cuban, and the rest", and that "Dutch cigars aren't really
&gt;much chop", a statement with which I'm beginning to agree.

After smoking a pipe for several years and only an occassional cigar,
I was given a copy of Thompson catalog [address in resource guide].
I just finished the Gold Medal Sampler of 42 cigars for $14.90 + S&amp;H.
They are mostly short filler of varying colors and sizes.  While not
the Cadillac of cigars, they're not a Yugo either.  I'm waiting for
my Maduro sampler to arrive.  It is a quick, inexpensive way to try a
number of different cigars.

Subject: Re: #1(2) Re:  Pipe Mail Group

Steve. Nice meeting you and learning about the Pipe Mail Group online. Thanks
for the quick response. 

Last night I was idly going through the latest Ephemeris (Winter-Spring '94)
and there on page 61, in a letter from Thorsten Kramp in Germany, was
information about the Group and your e-mail address. 

I'm a 30-year pipe smoker and, with so many good tobacconists closing their
doors (Wilke in NYC is a recent casualty), I'm happy to have the information
from you about reliable mail-order contacts. I'm more of a smoker than a
collector, and have accumulated about 40 good pipes over the years - a few
freehands, but mostly traditional shapes: Dunhill, Barling, Charatan, and
some great-smoking lesser names. My tobaccos? English blends and Virginias,
in tins. I've never been satisfied with any of the "pipe shop blends," but
would love to locate a good source of unflavored mixtures.

All the best. Charles Crawford

[ JR Cigar has a lot of good tinned blends at very good prices. If you
know of others, please let us know too! And welcome! -S. ]

Subject: Greetings from a newcomer!

Hello:
	Just joined the list and received a very nice "letter" of welcome
from Steve Masticola (thanks Steve). I must say that as a newcomer to the 
"net" I've found that people can be rather cool to newusers, if Steve's
post is any indication that does'nt appear to be the case here!
	Anyhow I suppose I should tell a bit about myself...
I'm married (no kids - yet), two dogs, couple of tankfulls of tropical fish,
love to ski (alpine), enjoy hunting (when I get the time - usually grouse and
white-tailed deer), enjoy a good game of backgammon or squash, skydive (when I
can afford to - sports a lot more expensive today than when I started in 1978.
	About a dozen pipes (all styles) although a nice bent is my
favourite!  Favourite brands a Peterson (the older ones - since lately
I can't find one toda with good briar), Soren, and Danish
Sovereign. As far as tobacco is concerned I like a full-flavoured
canendish with a light roast mixed with viginia &amp; burley. Before they
stopped importing it into Canada I loved "Mullinger's Knockbrack", a
Danish blend from Ireland...if anyone knows where I can find a north
american supplier for it I'd be eternally grateful!
	I also enjoy a good cigar from time to time as a special "treat".
	Well its getting late, and I work "dayshift" tomorrow (May 18) so...
time to finish off this last bowl and "tuck-in".

					G'nite All,

						Bob Cross

[ A man of many interests! Never heard of Mullinger's Knockbrack,
sounds intriguing! Any clues, readers? -S. ]

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #143 -- May 13, 1994

	I have a question for the net. 
	I am a relatively new member of the pipes forum, having switched
from cigarettes to pipes after smoking for 32 years. I recently purchased
several decent pipes, including a Nording, BJarne, and a couple of Savinelli
(Milan, Designer). The Nording and 1 of the Savinelli apparently have soft
spots towards the bottom of the bole, since the pipe has charred through the
sides a bit. Is this normal, and is there any advice about what to do? 
	In addition, the BJarne has begun charring on the outside of the bowl.
I plan on taking it back to the pipe store, since there is an apparent flaw in
the bowl.
	I would appreciate any suggestions members of the forum have.
My address is ????????@????.???.???.???.
	Thanks.

[ Utterly UNnormal, Kenneth -- sounds like you're smoking them WAY too
hard! I could believe a defect in one pipe, but three? But I could be
wrong... any other theories? -S. ]

Well, now I'm working in NYC.  Not, bad, but a tiring commute.
There's a little place on 42nd and Madison, but I haven't been there when
they're open; however, on the way home I stand on the corner of 42nd and
6th, right next to Nat Sherman.  I walked in, sniffed around...not bad. 
However, what's your opinion of the place?  They &gt;did&lt; have The Ultimate
Pipe and The Ultimate Cigar Book there, and some other items on the Cigar
Afficianado, and a couple of nice pipes.

Thank you for stopping the abortion - smoking routine before it got too 
intense.  I am sure that we all have very strong feelings on both 
matters, however, I enjoy this newsgroup for the same reason that I enjoy 
my pipes (I have purchased another) or a good cigar.  The pipes newsgroup 
is a break from reality; a chance to leave the constant arguments and 
anger outside, where they belong.  I would hate to have to pick through 
the pipes newsgroup to find letters that have to do with cigars and 
pipes, rather than abortion, and politics.

No judgements from me.  Just please, keep the discussion to pipes, 
cigars, and tobacco.

A note to "???????@???.???": I agree with you 100% I enjoy the break from 
the routine.  I smoke cigars and pipes, I use a shaving brush, and drive 
a '69 Roadrunner.  IMHO, the "old ways" are the best.

BTW I have moved to Victoria, B.C. over the summer for work.  In this 
city at 1116 Government Street, there is a glorious tobacconist called 
Morris'.  If you're in the area (possibly for the `94 Commonwealth Games) 
check this place out.  It is another one of the old classics.

Until the next trip to Vancouver to check up on my e-mail
See Ya.

Maybe you're not breaking them in properly.  Before you smoke a pipe the
first time, wet the inside of the bowl _immediately_ before smoking (just
lick your finger and run it inside), then smoke it all the way to the
bottom without stopping.  This will help lay a protective layer in the
bowl... and should take care of your problems.

and am currently attending Bowling Green State University.  I have been
smoking cigars for about 3 years and every once in a while I smoke a pipe,
but cigars are my main thing.  I have found Pipes Digest very enjoyable
and I like to hear eveybodys stories.  If you do not mind I want to tell a
little story about my cigar smoking experience.
	I really did not get into smoking cigars until my freshman year in
college, but I would have to say it was one of the best things that have
ever happened to me.  Durring my first year I lived with my best friend of
18 years in one of the dorms on campus.  We started smoking cigars
together and we found that it brought us closer together.  Since Bowling
Green State University's buildings are non-smoking my best friend and I
had to find a place to smoke our new found treasures.  We tried different
benches and steps outside of buildings, but these did not seem to suit our
needs.  Finally we  found a little hallway that was between two of the
older buildings on campus, it was perfect.  This hallway soon became a
temple for Ben and I.  We spent many nights smoking our cigars and
discussing our plans for the future.  The smoking hall was great, it was a
place where we could unwind and forget about the cares of the world.  I
think that cigars are the greatest gift to man, and to have a special
place to smoke them makes it even more wonderful.
	Oh, one more thing, I am looking for a woman who does not mind
cigar smoking.  I almost asked a total stranger to mary me once because
she told me that my cigar sure smelled nice.
	Enjoy your smokes, and forget about the worries of the world.

<TITLE>Pipes Digest Article: 145.006</TITLE>

From: Steve Weinberg/HQ/3Com

(From May 13th Pipes Digest) " An understanding tobacconist, to whom I
confided my plight, put me onto Villiger cigars, a box of which I'm
currently enjoying.  And here's my question -- what other cheap type
cigars are worth my trying?  I like (as far as I can tell) a
relatively mild cigar, but one with a bit of flavour.  I don't like
cigars that taste like the after-effects of a bushfire; that is to
say, I like the cigar to have a "refined" sort of taste."

I have smoked Villagers for several years now.  I usually take them
traveling because I was told by several knowledgeable people that it
was a "dry" cigar and would therefore not have to be kept in a
humidified environment.  I am not sure about that, can others confirm?
I smoke Uppman's Churchill's at home.  What I do know about the
Villiger is that they are from Switzerland where they are relatively
low priced there about $3.50 for 5 pack.  That was the only bargain I
ever found in Switzerland other than some good chocolate. They come in
square and round or "rund" shapes and the ones in Switzerland are made
from real Havana tobacco.  There are the other Villager cigars, the
"Export" stuff, which is sent over to the US and supposedly is made
from Dominican leaf Havana seed tobacco.  In the US, the back of the
five pack boxes are crossed over where they used to say "Made from
Havana Tobacco".  The ones in Switzerland are a bit stronger and
different shapes are available compared to the US versions where I've
only seen two square sizes.  I found that several of the airport duty
free shops in Germany, England and Ireland sold the Swiss version of
them in larger boxes of 25 "to go."  Steve Weinberg

Hi Steve. I just happened to be in Rochester for the Hamfest last weekend
and we stayed in Geneva. Very nice area. Will have to come back
and explore the lakes region better.  We saw the signs to be wineries-
and just what/how good are NY wines? A bottle of red with a Montecristo
would gone together very well.

Mark K.

BTW, the hamfest was excellent. In some ways I find the flea market
better than Dayton.

[ Some of the NY wines can be quite good, IMHO. Tnx 4 QSL de /2. -S. ]

From: CRAIG HAAS 703-308-8682 &lt;????.?????@???????.???.???&gt;
Subject: General babble

          Just some random thoughts here:
          
               I rarely smoke more than a bowlful every other day.  That 
          probably puts me a the low end of the spectrum, but I find I have 
          a delicate mouth, and my enjoyment diminishes greatly if I exceed 
          this.  (I have trouble sleeping on mattresses with peas in them, 
          too....)  Besides, I enjoy the aftertaste that can last for a day 
          sometimes, and if I smoke more than every other day, I don't get 
          that same effect.
          
               As a result, I probably haven't built up any decent chars on 
          my pipes (I have four, two of which I use most of the time.)  The 
          two I smoke most are both medium to low priced pipes.  I have a 
          Nording freehand that I bought in a fit of self indulgence that 
          I'm slowly getting the hang of.  Any words of advice?
          
               It is also taking me some time to develop a discriminating 
          palate, so my knowledge of tobaccos is very limited.  One that I 
          have found that I like a lot is Orkney, from John Crouch at the 
          Scottish Merchant in Alexandria, Virginia.  It's an aromatic with 
          a bit of Latakia for some oomph.
          
               Given the state of the world, I'm also a closet puffer.  
          Neither of my housemates appreciates the art, so I've been forced 
          into the great outdoors.  And since I don't have any pipe-smoking 
          friends I can't seek comfort in another person's home.  What a 
          lonely existence!!!  Anybody out there in the Washington, DC 
          area?
          
               Thanks for your valuable service to mankind by keeping these 
          digests coming!
          
          Craig

[ Will do, Craig! And it might be wise to consider trolling for new
housemates... -S. ]

Subject: New user appreciates the welcome

Steve, thank you for the introductory material and the welcome.  And, so I
don't forget, I would appreciate any of the older digests you could pull out
of your archieve and send my way.

As with one of your most recent new members, I too have been smoking a pipe
for about 30 plus years.  Since I am but a few months shy of my 45th birthday,
it's plain I started young.  My grandfather gave me a corn cob pipe one time
when we went fishing one time near where I was born in northern Wisconsin.  And
since it was his wish to fish most of the lakes in that area, I had plenty of
time to use it.  I am not sure what tobacco he used, and since my recollection
was that it looked like something scraped off the bottom of a table in a diner,
maybe it's just as well to forget it.  But I do remember the corn cobs he gave
me since they always had the six inch bamboo stem and the mouthpiece was one
of the "knuckles" or joints on the bamboo.  Even after I started collected
some better pipes, I would always keep a few of those corn cobs around.  Still
do, but I have been unable to find the old ones with just the cob and just the
bamboo stem.  Does anyone have a source of supply of those old ones?  As for
smoking, I mostly smoke around the house now that we have limited smoking at
work to a little gulag outside each building where folks huddle around while
smoking.  Public pillory I guess.  And, since I had an office with a door, I
enjoyed smoking a pipe or two during the day.  But that was then and this is
now.  As for home now, East Tennessee is home and we have a excellent pipe and
cigar shop in Knoxville called Smokey's, and Smokey's son is very good at
repairing pipes.  I brought about a dozen and a half pipes with broken bits
with me when I moved from Washington DC to here, and since I haven't suffered
a broken bit in the five years I have lived here, I think I have good proof
that one can break out of the tension and stress of DC and lead a better life.
Well, even though pipe smokers probably have good wind from not smoking
cigarettes, I think I ought not prove how long winded I can be with much more
of a message.  I look forward to corresponding with you and others who
appreciate pipes and who understand just how much smoke is being blown about
by those who would stick us outside our place of work or favorite restaurant.

[ It's kind of interesting how may peoples' fathers or grandfathers
started them on pipes... welcome! -S. ]

Could you tell me the current price for a box of 25 Monte Cristo No.1's in

Do you know what the regulations are concerning the actual postage of cigars
to the USA from the UK ?

Would you know of any interested buyers ?

Thanks for your previous reply.

Subject: Introduction to y'all.

Hi folks.  I'm quite a newcomer to the exciting world of pipes [and 
I smoke the occasional cigar] so I hope to learn a lot.
	I'm a sophomore at Yale University in New Haven, CT, who
will probably major in Computer Science and Philosophy, or just
Computer Science.
	May 23rd was commencement here, and I learned of a nice
tradition here:  all the seniors get little clay pipes and some
tobacco. Apparently, they are supposed to smoke the pipes and then
crush them, symbolizing their graduation.
	That's not the nice part, however. :)  It is that I have
lots of friends who just graduated but don't smoke, so I got
them to give me their tobacco. Heh heh. :)

Looking forward to some informative and friendly discourse,
Dave Sklar

[ Never knew of that tradition, Dave! Thanks for the line! -S. ]

Subject: Youngest Smoker.

Perhaps I'm a bit behind on the youngest smoker contest, but I just got 
this story recently.

I was smoking a cigar with my sister's boyfriend last weekend and we 
started talking about how we got started smoking.  He told me that his 
grandmother (!) had taught him how to smoke a cigar at age 6.  It seems 
that her husband (who had died) had been a cigar smoker and she really 
missed the smell of it in the house.  When he was 6 she told him that he 
was old enough to learn how to smoke, so she taught him to cut it, get it 
lit, and come by the ashtray every so often to take a puff so it didn't 
burn out.

Well, it's not a pipe, but 6?  That, IMHO, takes it.

was smoking a pipe at age 2. Laugh-In did a short bit on him, which

it... -S. ]

Subject: Intro reciprocated

Hi.
Occasional pipe smoker since 1972 -- 12 to 40 bowls per *year*.  But
when the urge comes, it's a wonderful pleasure that brings a peace
"that passeth understanding."

I own just four pipes; two bent; and two straight, one with a
meerschaum block lining; the other a traditional apple-shaped briar.
The bents are both el cheapo mass-production items; one, though, is
an anti-lemon: very very pleasant smoking, cool and not too wet
(unless I get hasty!!).  Cavendish, black or otherwise, is my
preferred twaway to prepare of tobacco.  As for tobacconists, I'found
two favourites in the 22 years (both are still there): Sherlock's
Haven in "the city" (San Francisco), and Au Caid on the Boul'Mich in
Paris.

Ben voyons... thinking of Au Caid makes me want to go light one...

Subject: Proposed Smoking Ban / Workplace

Here is some info I received from R.J. Reynolds on the proposed Smoking ban
for employers....even though directed at "employers" I think if anyone or all
of us can voice our opinion and help in the fight, it is better than sitting
by and watching our right fly out the window.
          
         NATIONWIDE SMOKING BANS PROPOSED!

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States
Department of Labor has issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on indoor air
quality (IAQ) and secondhand smoke.  OSHA would impose broad requirements on
employers regarding air quality and the operation and maintenance of heating,
ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.  It would effectively
prohibit smoking in indoor public places.

Smoking would be banned in restaurants bars, private clubs, retail
establishments, office buildings, government buildings, bingo parlors,
bowling alleys, casinsos, hotels and motels, sports arenas and even
residences where work is taking place, unless specially ventilated smoking
areas are established.

It is the most far\-reaching proposed smoking restriction in history, and
would override every less-restrictive state and local regulation currently on
the books.

It would apply to EVERY employer, regardless of size, with the exception of
self-employed individuals.

People interested in voicing their concerns should write a letter to OSHA.
(For ideas on what to say...see later on in letter)  Letters must be
postmarked by June 29, 1994.

SO HERE'S WHAT TO DO:

1.  Write a letter telling OSHA that you object to this proposal.
2.  Take your letter and make three copies of it.  PUt your original letter
plus three copies into an envelope.
3.  Address your envelope to:
                                               The Docket Office
                                               Docket No. H-122
                                               Room N-2625
                                               U.S. Department of Labor
                                               200 Constitution Avenue, NW
                                               Washington, DC  20210

4.  Print your return address on the envelope and mail it as soon as possible
before Jun 29, 1994

TIPS FOR YOUR LETTER TO OSHA

&lt;---ideas that you may wish to include in your letters:

1.  Keep you rletters short and clearly state your position on the proposed
OSHA regulation on smoking in the workplace.

2.  The proposed regulations go too far.  In some cases, the proposals might
even invade the privacy of your own home.  If you pay someone to work in your
home, then you may lose the right to smoke in your own home.  Personal
freedom is at stake.

3.  The proposal amounts to a ban on smoking.  This is an attempt at a
backdoor prohibition.  The majority of Americans oppose prohibition.

4.  The current systems works.  There is no need for the federal government
to further regulate smoking.

Why send all these copies.

OSHA requires four copies of comments on this issue.  We know this is
inconvenient, but it is required.  OSHA WILL NOT READ, NOR COUNT ENVELOPES
THAT DO NOT CONTAIN THE ORIGINAL LETTER PLUS 3 COPIES OF IT.


[ This is scary. Please write the Department of Labor, with four
copies of your letter -- and also write your elected
representatives. Please take the time to do it TODAY.

Subject: Smoking problem

Hi Steve,
	I have a question for anyone who may have an answer. I currently use
a nice Irish second briar and I have developed a problem. The first half of
the bowl smokes very nicely, yet the second half or so tends to burn out 
extremely fast...in fact, it's almost impossible to keep it lit.

Any ideas would be appreciated.

	I would like to learn, how and from which types of tobaccos, that 
various pipe tobacco's are manufactured.  The stuff they sell at the

Subject: Re:  Pipes Digest #145 - June 3, 1994

Steve,

I have been listening in for about a month and a half and I really
enjoy these Digests.  I thought something was missing for a while
and it appears I missed #144, if you could please send it if you 
still have it around.  I am fairly new to pipes and smoking in general
(started cigs at 24, rolling my own for a year or so, and a pipe for about
2 years, I am now 31)  and I am thinking about a second or third pipe to
celebrate finishing grad school and getting a job.  Along these lines,
I have a few questions:

Does anyone have any suggestions for buying a meerschaum?  What should I
look for?  How should I take care of it so it colors nicely?  Do I need
to smoke just one blend in it or can I mix and match?

I will be moving to central Louisiana in August and I need to know if I 
should stock up here and buy my new pipes before I go or will I be able
to find any good shops there?  I did not see anything listed for Louisiana
but I didn't see any listed for Colorado either and I know of two in Ft.
Collins and two or three in Denver.

Is there a good book out on the market for beginners with pipes?  I did
not have a father or grandfather to teach me (life growing up in Utah)
so this has all been a self-taught experience which brings to mind a
passage out of Luke about "the blind leading the blind and both falling 
in the ditch".  Your introductory information was VERY helpful but I 
was hopeful for something more.

Thanks for all your help and willingness to listening to someone who has
let his questions build up.

Hi Steve: J. Upshaw firmly in teeth, thought I'd mention to members that
there is a nice tobacco shop/mail order place in Miami at Harborside called
Kings Treasure. They have a catalog (for cigars) and an 800 # which I don't
remember off hand. It's also a great place to meet gorgeous cigar-smoking
Latin American _women_.

I've only experience with a few shops around here, but in
my humble opinion, _The Briar Shoppe_ in Eugene, Oregon is
one of the most friendly, helpful shops around.  They don't
have the largest selection I've seen, but they've always
been kind and courteous to this neophyte.  Please add this
shop to your list.

Thanks

Steve,

This is my first letter to your group.  I am 26 years and have been
smoking pipes and cigars on and off for the past ten or so years.  For
everybody out there who gets too stressed and uptight about not being
able to smoke at home with your loved one, don't forget there is
always wine!  I can always relax and forget about the cares of the
world sitting anywhere I want in my house with a nice glass of vino.
And as long as I'm willing to pay I can drink any kind of wine I want
- no embargoes here folks!  Also, afterwards, you don't have to brush
your teeth a hundred times, or wash your clothes in acid, and who
knows, maybe afterwards the two of you might get into the mood for
other things as well!

&gt; [...] Nat Sherman.  I walked in, sniffed around...not bad.
&gt; However, what's your opinion of the place?

Well, I was smoking Virgina Circles for a couple of months,
and pipes for only about a year longer than that, when I wandered
into Nat Sherman's in NYC. I only had about five minutes to spend,
so I quickly bought some pipe tobacco (should have bought a fresh 
box of cigs, too) and scampered off.

The salesmen were dressed in suits but were very courteous to me, a
scruffy looking student carrying a large duffle. Even though the shop
is right on Fifth Aveneue in the largest city in the world I saw the
staff converse on a friendly level with some people who appeared to be
regulars. I value that kind of thing.

I didn't have a chance to sample any of their cigar humidor, but Nat
Sherman's cigarettes are simply the best packaged cigarettes I have
*ever* smoked. The pipe tobacco I bought was the best and most suited
to my tastes that I have *ever* bought. The Nat Sherman's store in New
York was one of the nicest tobacconists I have *ever* visited.

If you're going to be in the area, would you be able to pop in and
snag me a couple ounces of "Golden Virginian"? I'd sell my best briar
for more of that leafy nectar! Of course, that still leaves me my
meerschaum. =^&gt;

Subject: Re: Moderated mailgroup for cigars, pipes, fine tobacco

Hi Steve, 

Thanks for sending me the mailgroup so quickly.

My name is Kevin Stampfl, I'm a student at UC Davis. I'm 25 and have been 
smoking pipes and cigars since I was 13. I bought my first pipe at 14 
while vacationing in Australia, under the pretense that it was a gift for 
my father. My smoking habits vary, however I rarely exceed once or twice 
a week. I guess that makes me a dilletant. There's nothing I love better 
than to sit with friends drinking single malt scotches and sucking on 
good cigars. Anyways, I have mixed feelings about the whole smoking thing 
since cigarettes bug the hell out of me and I study toxicology. However I 
certainly would never begrudge anyone the right to smoke whatever they 
want, including cigarettes, opium, or arsenic, and I'm glad there is a non 
political forum for the discussion of pipes and cigars. 

Kevin

Subject: missed 144

Steve, 
	For some reason or another I missed 144. Would you be so kind as 
to send it to me when you get the chance. I also want to take this opportunity
to brag on my wife. Apparently I had been a good boy recently so on a shopping 
trip with her sister, my wife surprised me by stopping at our local smoke shop 
and picking me up some cigars including a few Romeo y Julietta's. The guys at
the shop were so amazed by a wife buying her husband cigars that they gave 
her double doses of help. She said the were EXTREMELY helpful. What a woman!

Subject: Pipes Mailgroup

Thanks for the fast turn-around in signing up.  Any or all of the back
issues you could send would be appreciated.  I would like to get
caught up before commenting on what is new to me, but might be old
news to others.

On your list of pipe shops I do have a couple of suggestions to add.

The Owl Shop two locations, one in Worcester Mass, the other in New
Haven.  They are run by George Photakis (Worcester) and his sister,
Mrs. St. James.  David Sklar from Yale should send us all a review of
the New Haven store as they are feet from Yale and probably started
the tradition of giving claypipes to the seniors at the local
finishing school, aka Yale.

 Mrs. St. James is a jewel, running what she describes as the oldest
tobacconist in thecountry.  She currently (when I was there in April)
had many old Algerian briars left from the early 1960's. Seems during
the Black Panther trials held in New Haven in the 1960's led
Mr. St. James to take the pipes to his home where they languished
until now.  George runs a great store in Worcester, selling his own
blends, as well as some made in New Haven.  George's son, John, used
to make pipes on the second floor, but he has not done so since I
first went in five years ago.  I did find one of his pipes through
Levin International (it is a great pipe) and am looking for more.  If
anyone wants to get rid of any, please send mail.

The second store you should add is Perreti's in Boston. (21/2 Park
Square) It has been there for years, has a good catalog for the
asking, and their own blends.

Having done my bit to add names to the list, let me tell you about my
collection/interests.  I started with a pipe years ago in college,
gave it up, and have come back in the last several years.  The early
pipes were seconds from Leavitt &amp; Pierce in Cambridge, augmented by
Ehrlich (their sister store) in the past ten years.  I then found
Barry Levin and tried, at the urging of a friend, Upshalls, moving up
to Charatons.  At this point I tend toward the used/collector pipes,
as I feel they offer better value, and want to add to the Upshalls,
Charatons, Photakis which I have.  I am also considering Italians, but
of the three I have had so far, one is so-so, one I gave to a friend,
and one I still have under advisement to see if it will prove to be
worth keeping.  In the meantime, I would consider swapping it (it is a
rough finish Brebbia, full bent).

Thanks for the info.

Stephen Wyman


PS  Which address is the proper one to use?  This or the one listed as
rutgers.edu?

Yes, it's been three weeks since the last Digest. Many things have
intervened; buying a house and moving into it, a trip to a conference,
etc. But join us now as we continue the legislative debate (which I'll
try to tone down in later issues, but I think it's important), and
hear some clubby news from Los Angeles... 

And, of course, happy Fourth of July and Canada Day to our readers in
North America! (Hope I got it right... :) Enjoy those barbecues, and
perhaps a good smoke along with the fireworks.

Subject: "Vintage" cigars...

Steve et al..

A while back (and I *do* mean a while back) I posted a question
on so called "Vintage" cigars. An uncle of mine who is a big
cigar smoker had one many years ago at a business meeting (happy
days, conducting business with a cigar and a glass of port!). He
knew nothing much about what constitutes a vintage and nor
do I, I still don't know but I have finally tried one.

What I had was a Dunhill Altamiras from the "Harvest Crop 1987" and
the cigar states "Aged Cigar". My impression was very good, it was
a fairly mild cigar, which suits me fine and although it does not
state the origin of the tobacco, I reckon on Cuban for two
reasons:
        1. It reminded me (a lot) of a Romeo y Julietta (yum!),
           the flavour was more even and, I suppose, mature.

        2. It cost six pounds (about 9 dollars).

If you see one, I'd reccomend giving it a try. All in all I
found it very enjoyable, sociable smoke.

I'm still interested in finding out more on Vintage Cigars though,
I still say it's a gimmick...

Colin.

Subject: The Owl Shop

The tradition of crushing clay pipes at Yale's commencement (which the Owl 
Shop used to participate in) was more elaborate at one time.  A briar pipe 
with a Yale "Y" and the class year inlaid in silver was presented to the 
class president, and was passed around for everyone to smoke.  Mr. St. 
James of the Owl Shop used to bejewel these pipes himself, and when he 
passed away the art was lost.  The Yale administration banned the practice 
in the late sixties, probably due to typical concerns about "elitism" and 
the like.

The Owl Shop cannot be the oldest tobacconist in the country, for it was 
founded in 1934.  I know of at least one tobacconist, Boston's David P. 
Ehrlich (parent of Leavitt &amp; Pierce), which was established prior to 
that time (in 1868, to be exact).

Re: Proposed Smoking Legislation

This isn't going to be popular, but that's never stopped me before... ;)

I've been smoking cigars and pipes since I was sixteen, and I've got to say
that I'm in favor of this legislation.  If the people around me when I'm in
public don't want to breath my smoke, then I think they have that right.  I
know that I don't want to breath anyone else's cigarette smoke, or even
cheap cigar smoke.  (Good cigars are an entirely different matter, of
course.)

Some of this might be due to the fact that I'm in California, so year
'round I have the option of stepping outside to enjoy my pipe/cigar...

If smoking was as non-intrusive as chewing gum, then I'd think this is
outrageous.  It's not.  If they were coming into my house and telling me
what to do, I'd be offended, but they're not.

So... count me as the minority of the minority, I guess.

Subject: Nat Sherman's

I am not impressed with Nat Sherman's. The salespeople dress well, the decor 
is impressive, the space dignified, but they have a poor stock of pipes and 
tinned tobacco, and they don't know anything about pipes. The best stocked 
store with the most knowledgable personnel in NYC is De La Concha on 6th 
Ave. and 55th St. Barclay-Rex (70 E. 42nd and 7 Maiden Lane) is also good, 
although the salespeople are not as well-informed. Barclay-Rex still has 
tins of their English made-to-order Virginia Flake. This is a very good 
basic flake, which is, needless to say, no longer manufactured. These tins 
are years old and sell for $4 each (50 grams).

Subject: Pipes

I recently began to subscribe to the digest and though maybe an 
introduction was in order.  My name is Gideon Pollach and I am a student 
at Trinity College in Hartford CT. I recently started smoking 
pipes,through the encouragement o a friend, also a digest subscriber, and 
I have a question.  How neccesary is the pre-treatment of the pipe?  I 
have read agreat deal but always manage to forget it when I start to 
break in a new pipe.  If this is neccesary is there any remedy for the 
damage done to my pipes?  

I would appreciate any knowledgeable responses.  Thanks
Gideon

[ Breaking in? Depends on the pipe. The pre-carbonized ones supposedly
need no break-in, though I've found that even so it's 3-4 bowls before
they smoke right. -S. ]

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest

I am listening since about five issues and realized that there seems to
be a tradition that people introduce themselves. Well, briefly, I am 33
and smoking pipes (with interruptions) since I was 17. Besides this I
enjoy good cigars, my favorites are Partagas and Romeo y Julietta. (I
tried several other, non-Cuban brands but, none of them convinced me.)

As to the development of anti-smoking initiatives in the states, it
might be interesting for you to know about the situation here in Europe:

Historically, the issue rised already in the mid-17th century:

[Some examples from a booklet I came across]

	1624: Pope Urban VIII banned smoking from the churches in Sevilla
	1634: Smoking was banned in Russia
	1650: Smoking ban in Peter's church in Rome (by pope Innozenz X)
	1653: Bavaria restricted selling tobacco to pharmacies  

Currently, all countries except Britain and the Scandinavian countries
are still quite relaxed wrt smoking. (France also has strict anti-
smoking laws, but nobody is taking them very seriously). The more south
you get, the less fuss people make about it. Here in Germany it is still
not a big issue -- I do not know of any non-smoking pub, for instance.
However, the situation might get worse, as what goes on in the states
seems to move over to Europe with a delay of 2 or 3 years. We will see...

So much to this; finally, I've got three questions:

I am supposed to spend a couple of days in Charlotte, NC; is
there any pipe shop worth visiting?

Out of curiosity: What is the approximate price of Middleton's Black
&amp; Mild in the US? I smoke it occasionally and for a puch I pay here
the equivalent of about 10 USD.

I would like to browse through the back issues of the pipes digest,
is there a way to get them (eg by ftp)? 

Cheers
	Joachim.

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #146 - June 9, 1994

Hi, Steve:

First off, great list.  Now to the controversial stuff. ;)

&gt;But the proposal goes farther than that. It also says that you can't
&gt;go to _any_ indoor place and light up. You couldn't even run a private
&gt;club for smokers only. You couldn't light a cigar at your own wedding,
&gt;even if you rented the hall. Use a lighter, go to jail.
&gt;
&gt;I think this clearly violates the First Amendment right to peaceful
&gt;assembly for legal purposes.

I agree that you should be able to open a club for smokers, and hire
employees who realize that they'll be around smoke, and agree to it.  But
if you're just renting out a place for a night (wedding, etc), then you're
asking that the employees of the place all have to be exposed to smoke,
whether they like it or not.  If you make lead paint, you can tell
employees that part of the job is being exposed to it, but you don't have
the right to go paint any room that you rent, to use a clumsy analogy.

&gt;I'm all in favor of nonsmokers having places where no one smokes. I'd
&gt;even be in favor of that being the default. But I'm adamantly opposed
&gt;to it being a universal rule.

I think the point I'm trying to make is that smokers risk the health of
other people.  (I think with recent secondhand smoke studies, this is not
too much of a debatable fact.)  Even if they're not risking the health,
certain people simply don't enjoy inhaling other people's smoke.  (Count me
as one of those, when it comes to cigarettes.)  So _smokers_ are the ones
who infringe on the non-smokers rights when they're put together.  I think
I'm on the other side of it as you:  I'm all in favor of smokers having
places where everyone smokes.  But when you're in a place where you share
the air, the non-smoker has to win out.

Just the opinion of one smoker. ;)

Jeff

[ OTOH, many researchers think the smoke studies are highly suspect at
best, and blatant axe-grinding probably. There has been much
discussion about this on alt.smokers.

I'd concede that the employees should be free to seek employment in
establishments that never allow smoking. Of which there are plenty.
Likewise, patrons should be free to rent halls where smoking is
allowed. Let the employment market, as well as the patron market,
decide.

Re clubs for smokers go, see Duane Clark's article on the LA cigar
restaurant/bar. I think it would be illegal under the proposed
legislation. -S. ]

Subject: Moderated newsgroup.....

   I just read the first Digest that you sent.  Here are a couple of items
you may post or file.......
1)  Levin pipes, Int'l. - With the passing of Berry Levin, the business is
going through some changes.  They are as follows:  Kathy Levin (widdow) has
moved the business to 6113 Abbey Rd. - Aptos, CA  95003 (408) 477-0140.
Nikos Levin (son) opperates NML Pipes Dirrect - P.O. Box 1393 Burlington, VT
 05402 (802) 863-1379.
Kathy is specializing in the Specialty Tobacco portion of the business while
Nikos is concentrating on all aspects of the briar (new &amp; estate).  Highly
recommended.
2)  General, personal items - I am pushing 40 and have owned pipes for 20
years (regularly smoked for about 10 yrs.).  I have a number of pieces, in my
collection, but am now almost exclusivly interested in XXXL traditional
shapes (hense the name Giantbriar).  I am searching (aren't we all), for the
perfect tobacco.  To date, I can only say that the quest has centered within
the 'English' family.
I am also interested in talking to anyone who can make display racks
(inexpensivly) for my XXXL pipes.
3) In the hobby section of America Online there is a pipe and cigar forum.
 You might post your Digest notice there.

Happy Puffing........
Joel

[ Thanks, Joel, and welcome! -S. ]

Steve,  Thanks for adding me to the pipes mailgroup list.  
I am 50 years old and have smoked pipes since 20 or so.  I 
am a modest smoker--only a bowl or two per day--and my 
preference in tobacco is English type blends such as 
Dunhill #965, London Mixture, Balkan Sobrannie Black or 
Gray, and especially Connoisseur's Turkish Black.  I highly 
recommend the mixtures at Connoisseur, Ltd. in NYC.  They 
are expensive, but the best I've smoked.  I have a 
collection of 100 or so pipes among which my favorites are 
Dunhills and Charatans.

Although I rotate my pipes smoking each about five 
consecutive bowls, I have found that if I break in a new 
pipe smoking it about 3 to 4 dozen bowls one-half full or 
less I build up a nice carbon layer in the hell and avoid 
the wet, unpleasant smoke that so often happens during the 
last half of the pipe.  My pipes smoke to the bottom of the 
bowl leaving only a few ashes, not the wet gunk so many 
pipe smokers experience.

If possible, please send me all the past digests.  I will 
have a new internet address on July 1, 1994:  
??????@????????.???.  Please send the digests to PSILink if 
before the end of June.  If later, please send them to 
Pipeline.

Thanks.  I look forward to lots of good info.   Bruce

[ Digests 1-146 sent. Happy reading! -S. ]

Steve,

Thanks for the intro package from the pipes mailgroup - I've dealt with 
about a half dozen of the pipe/tobacco retailers on your extensive list.  
I am primarily a cigar smoker and order most of my cigars from the Famous 
Smoke Shop in NYC.  I am also a woodworker and would like to build a nice 
humidor to hold 2-3 boxes of cigars, but have not been able to find plans 
or obtain suggestions after sending letters to several of the wood 
working magazines that I receive.  In the NY and Chicago shops the going 
prices for a small humidor often exceeds $500.  I would appreciate any 
comments from you or your subscribers regarding humidor plans or 
retailers that might have well made humidors that sell for several 
hundred dollars or less.  Thanks.

					Dave Ott

[ From time to time there are discussions in rec.woodworking about
humidor plans... I'd think it's just a tight box. Others? -S. ]

LA's Proposed "Premier Cigar Haven"

Seventy Seventy Partners is a pre-formation California limited
partnership planned to develop, own, and operate a restaurant and bar
in the metropolitan Los Angeles area.  The distinct and significant
feature of the restaurant will be its dedication to the enjoyment
of premium cigars by patrons at the premises.  The restaurant will
be designed to have a traditional club-like atmosphere, and will
serve simply prepared grill items along with contemporary fare.  Along
with fine cigars, the restaurant will feature premium beverages,
including single malt scotches and rare ports.

The restaurant will have an appearance and ambiance reminiscent of
the classic east coast restaurants and clubs created in the 1930's
and 1940's.  A large separate bar and salon area will be capable of
holding approximately 50 people and is expected to serve as an
independent destination place for patrons.

The restaurant will also contain a large walk-in humidor to maintain
the ideal temperature and humidity for cigars stored at the premises.
The humidor will include a wide variety of premium cigars.  Patrons
may purchase individual cigars to be smoked at the restaurant, and
individual and quantity packaged cigars for retail take-out.  Because
of the particular orientation of the restaurant, it is anticipated
that it will become a retail destination for cigar purchasers as well.  
A special section within the humidor will be provided for locked 
cigar safedeposit boxes that will be leased to patrons for the 
storage of their personal cigars.

A trained staff will be capable of making knowledgeable cigar suggestions
in the tradition of a skilled wine sommelier.

Sound interesting?  Let me know, fellow aficionados

Clay pipes ...

I got to thinking (dangerous, I know) that it might
be fun to try my hand at making a clay pipe or two.
My mother (an ex-art teacher) taught me the basics of
working with clay, and I've done a few simple things
in the past. There is a pottery guild here in Santa Cruz
where I can get things fired, so I think I have a good
shot at success.

Has on this list ever made a clay pipe? I've done a catalog
search of our local university library and have some leads on
books, but if anyone knows of any books that cover making
clay pipes in particular that would be helpful.

Thanks,

Kam Kashani

oldest smokeshop, and pipes that smell like cigars...

Subject: Re: Proposed Smoking Legislation

I don't want Jeff to feel lonely when the barrage comes, so I'll stand by
his side.

He wrote:
&gt; I've been smoking cigars and pipes since I was sixteen, and I've got to say
&gt; that I'm in favor of this legislation.  If the people around me when I'm in
&gt; public don't want to breath my smoke, then I think they have that right.  I
&gt; know that I don't want to breath anyone else's cigarette smoke, or even
&gt; cheap cigar smoke.  (Good cigars are an entirely different matter, of course.)

I haven't studied the legislation so I can't comment on it directly,
but I do agree that nonsmokers (as well as smokers for that matter)
should not have to experience 2nd-hand smoke in public unless they so
elect.  For example, I think smoking on a park bench should be allowed,
but I'm against smoking at the ballpark.  Restaraunts that have smoking
sections should provide real ventilation to keep diners from encountering
smoke.  Of course, the government had better not tell me I can't smoke on
my own property.  Multi-unit dwellings do pose some interesting problems.
I'm thinking of the case where the smoke from one apartment filled another.
I think the responsibility lies with the landlord or condominum association
to provide proper ventilation for all units.  One doesn't want the smell of
burnt food or infrequently maintained litter boxes wafting into your apartment 
from your neighbor's either.

Essentially I consider myself *both* a smoker and a nonsmoker.  I'm a smoker
when I'm smoking (profound, huh?) and a nonsmoker the rest of the day.
I want to choose when I have smoke in my face.

&gt; Some of this might be due to the fact that I'm in California, so year
&gt; 'round I have the option of stepping outside to enjoy my pipe/cigar...

The late evenings in Massachusetts this spring and summer have been delightful
times to sit on my front porch smoking my cigar.  I suspect my frequency of
smoking will go down in the winter, since it just won't be enjoyable then.
There is no way I'm going to subject my cigarette-addicted wife (she's been
clean for 4-1/2 years) and my young daughters to my smoke.  I've found that
if I smoke in my office on the 3rd floor of the house, I can't stand the
smell of the old, stale smoke when I start work the next morning, so, I guess
I'll look forward to business trips during the winter.

Hi Steve, and other Digest Readers;

I am a 45 year old non-traditional college student who returned to academia 
for a Ph. D.  I returned with a lot of experiences under my belt, not the 
least of which is the pleasuable use of tobacco in many forms.  I enjoy the 
pipe, the cigar, and the flavor of a good high-burley hand-rolled cigarette.

I like good English briars (Wilmers for those who may know of this 
wonderful old maker who no longer exports to the US), Charatans, and an 
ocassional Dunhill (although overpriced, still a very good smoke).

I find my smoke unwelcome on most of the campus, so I feel great about 
using my e-mail access to talk smoke.  Thanks for the opportunity to 
participate in this group.

&gt; What I had was a Dunhill Altamiras from the "Harvest Crop 1987" and
&gt; the cigar states "Aged Cigar". My impression was very good, it was
&gt; a fairly mild cigar, which suits me fine and although it does not
&gt; state the origin of the tobacco, I reckon on Cuban for two
&gt; reasons:
&gt;         1. It reminded me (a lot) of a Romeo y Julietta (yum!),
&gt;            the flavour was more even and, I suppose, mature.
&gt; 
&gt;         2. It cost six pounds (about 9 dollars).

They are great cigars, in fact one of my favorite.  They are readily 
available in the US and are made in the Dominican Republic, not Cuba.

Hi.  Here's a sort of contribution for the digest, if you
don't feel it's too far off topic:

Somebody said reason 9 of 10 for smoking was, "it's not as
stupid as lottery tickets."  Well, I won't argue the
comparison, but I'd like to tell you about my favourite
customer (I manage the online games for Ontario Lottery):

Here's a guy (he really exists, this isn't made up!) who
spends $2 on an instant ticket (the scratch sort) and a bit
more on a six-pack.  He takes the both of them home.  He's
a pipe smoker, this fellow -- that's not in the story I
heard, but he's gotta be -- just wait, you'll see why I
think so.
So he sits down and pops a bottle cap, lights up (if I'm
right) and scratches the first number.  There are six
numbers; find three the same, win that amount.  This guy
scratches one number.
Puff, puff... Glug... let's see, $500.  Now, suppose I had
$500 to spend; no need to save any of it, it's a windfall.
What would I do with that?
Twenty or thirty minutes later, the bowl's getting low and
so's the bottle.  Peace has descended.  Our friend's also
running low on ideas as to how to spend $500.  Pop the next
bottle top and let's scratch another -- hey, $10,000!  Boy,
I bet I can think of a good few fun ways to spend that!

Well, you get the idea.  By the time all six numbers have
seen the light of day, it's three hours later, maybe three
or four bottles too, and one or two bowls of a good blend.
For the two bucks and half the price of a six-pack, here's
three hours of quiet cheer.  Does it matter that the ticket
didn't really win anything?

We lottery folks aren't in business to give away money; we
sell entertainment.  If you buy lottery tickets to make a
living, sure that's stupid.  But don't go and crap on the
people who know it's as inexpensive a form of fun as the
market offers, so long as you don't get your hopes too
high.  And hey, SOMEbody's gotta win...

Subject: Smoke and Fire

&gt; Re: Proposed Smoking Legislation
 &gt; I've been smoking cigars and pipes since I was sixteen, and I've
 &gt; got to say that I'm in favor of this legislation.  If the people
 &gt; around me when I'm in public don't want to breath my smoke, then
 &gt; I think they have that right.  I know that I don't want to breath
 &gt; anyone else's cigarette smoke, or even cheap cigar smoke.
 &gt; (Good cigars are an entirely different matter, of course.)
 
But then, the FDA, and other politicians including the EPA, do not
 make any distinction between cheap cigars or any other type.
 
&gt; Some of this might be due to the fact that I'm in California, so
 &gt; year 'round I have the option of stepping outside to enjoy my
 &gt; pipe/cigar...
 
&gt; If smoking was as non-intrusive as chewing gum, then I'd think this
 &gt; is outrageous.  It's not.  If they were coming into my house and
 &gt; telling me what to do, I'd be offended, but they're not.
 
They are telling businesspeople what to do.  Two places I do business
 with have signs up.  The first place is a hoagi shop.  He has tables
 to eat at.  There is a sign, saying that there is no non smoking areas
 in the establishment.  The other place, a rib house, has a sign on the
 door saying, "non smokers are welcome too"
 
Some women, and men, wear scents which are very annoying to me.  Not
 just annoying, but if strong enough, trigger a case of bronchetis in
 me.  There are no laws against that.
 
The so-called health hazard, might be greatly reduced, if the EPA, and
 other politicians would clean up the air and water we ingest.  If
 nobody ever got lung cancer, that did not smoke, then I would say they
 have a case.  But, I am sure we all know people who never smoked, and
 died of lung cancer, just the same.  And, we all know people who
 smoked heavily, and died at a very old age.  My grandfather was 94
 years old, and had smoked heavily for more than 60 years.  He did not
 die of lung cancer.  Nor did he have COPD.
 
Air is not a good substance for the body to ingest.  Necessary, but if
 you had it tested, you would be surprised at the amount of toxic stuff
 in it.  That probably has more to do with health problems, than
 anything else the politicians are trying to pass laws against, thus
 giving the Mafia new lines of business.
 
Trucks give off many more times the amount of toxic substances that
 smokers do, yet, they roll all over the country.  Apparently, money is
 more important than health in this case.  Well, when smoking becomes
 too expensive for the average joe to do, money will be more important
 than also.  If we all did give up smoking, where will the taxes come
 from?  Who will make up the billions of dollars the federal and state
 governments steal from us.  And, by the way, since we smokers do pay
 those taxes, and non smokers do not, I figure we have more say in
 congress than they do.  Congress has not seen that yet, but they will.
 
I have never had any problems with pipe smoke, cigar smoke, even the
 cheapies, or for that matter cigarette smoke, as I have had with
 obnoxious perfumes.
 &gt; I think the point I'm trying to make is that smokers risk the
 &gt; health of other people.  (I think with recent secondhand smoke
 &gt; studies, this is not too much of a debatable fact.)
 
Those are not reliable studies at all.  EPA is not concerned with
 accuracy, only in presenting their own side.  And, they also wish the
 spotlight of the public, shifted elsewhere, not on them.  One of my
 employers, a polluter, simply paid a "donation" each year, and was not
 bothered by EPA or anyone else.
 
Countries with much more relaxed attitudes about smoking, should be
 showing higher rates of cancer than we do.  I do not think they are.
 
 
&gt; Even if they're not risking the health, certain people simply
 &gt; don't enjoy inhaling other people's smoke.  (Count me as one of
 &gt; those, when it comes to cigarettes.)  So _smokers_ are the ones
 &gt; who infringe on the non-smokers rights when they're put together.
 &gt; I think I'm on the other side of it as you:  I'm all in favor of
 &gt; smokers having places where everyone smokes.  But when you're in a
 &gt; place where you share the air, the non-smoker has to win out.
 
Yes, but only when the non smokers pay the same amount of taxes, as
 the smokers do.  I am tired of being treated as a second class
 citizen.  Especially since I pay a good deal more taxes than non
 smokers do.

Subject: Smoking

For those on this list, if you want to know how far the antismoking zealots
have gone, note that all government buildings in DC have been made
smokeless--not even any smokers' havens. I work in the Washington Navy Yard,
and smoking is not only forbidden in all the buildings, but you cannot walk
about in the open air smoking. There are several smoking oases which have been
set aside and so, if you want a smoke, you leave the building and head for one
of these zones. Of course, in doing so you are away from your desk and I am
surprised that "they" have not insisted on the employees taking "smoking leave
time" which will be deducted from the leave time each employee has on the
books. By the way, heads (restrooms) are no smoking areas also. By the way,
Steve, I would like some of the early digests with lists of vendors of smokers'
supplies (pipes, tobacco, cigars). I believe that I sent you the names and
locations of my two favorite tobaccanists, but have not seen them in any of the
digests. They are Fader's, whose home base is Baltimore, but has a store also
in Annapolis which I patronize. They have a great mixture in Barrister, which
is mild but also has a touch of latakia and perique. The other tobaccanist is
The Smoke Shop on Maryland Avenue in Annapolis. It has a great assortment of
pipes and tobaccos. The one of theirs I particularly like is Black and Gold.

Subject: smoking in public

&gt;&gt;If the people around me when I'm in public don't want to breath my
&gt;&gt;smoke, then I think they have that right.  I know that I don't want
&gt;&gt;to breath anyone else's cigarette smoke, or even cheap cigar smoke.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;But the proposal goes farther than that. It also says that you can't
&gt;&gt;go to _any_ indoor place and light up. You couldn't even run a private
&gt;&gt;club for smokers only.
&gt;
&gt;I agree that you should be able to open a club for smokers, and hire
&gt;employees who realize that they'll be around smoke, and agree to it.  But
&gt;if you're just renting out a place for a night (wedding, etc), then you're
&gt;asking that the employees of the place all have to be exposed to smoke,
&gt;whether they like it or not.  If you make lead paint, you can tell
&gt;employees that part of the job is being exposed to it, but you don't have
&gt;the right to go paint any room that you rent, to use a clumsy analogy.
&gt;
&gt;I think the point I'm trying to make is that smokers risk the health of
&gt;other people.  (I think with recent secondhand smoke studies, this is not
&gt;too much of a debatable fact.)  Even if they're not risking the health,
&gt;certain people simply don't enjoy inhaling other people's smoke.

When you're talking about cigarettes whose papers are bleached w/
assorted chemicals like dioxane, studies have always reported
hazards.  I have not seen ANY study in the last 20 years on
unbleached cigarettes, cigars or pipes either pro or con.  [If
anyone out there can provide a reference, source, etc. I would be most
appreciative!]

As far as locations for smoking, I think that's where early smokers
went overboard.  As a rite of passage, people treated it as a right
instead of a privilege.  I avoid smoking around people at work or
in public when I know it offends them.  On the other hand you should
expect me to be smoking if you visit me in my own home.

In that respect the lead analogy was excellent.  Many of the things
I do at work involve hazards, but I know and accept the risks.  We
don't allow visitors to wander into the area where they might be
exposed to such hazards, nor have we disposed of all such chemicals
simply because they are hazardous.  Why should smoking be any
different?

The other extension of this analogy is warning labels.  We are
required by Federal Law (29CFR1910) to communicate the hazards inside
a container w/ a warning label.  We are also required to have
complete information on each of these items in the form of a Material
Safety Data Sheet (MSDS).  Recent legal actions are trying to
discount the same type of warning printed on cigarette packages.
[And I note that I have never seen such a warning on my pipe tobacco
or on a cigar.]  How will the effect other industries that utilize
warning labels?  All I'm asking for is consistancy.

I just got the latest issue.  Congratulations on the new house and the move.
 Hope all the things the old owners told you about the charm of the house are
true.

I also saw you posting on sending all the back issues.  If you could do the
same for me, 1-136, I would appreciate it.  I lacked the timerity to ask for
them all as I thought it an imposition.

I will send the report on the Show in Boston in the next few days.  In the
meantime, keep up the good work.

Query?  Why are all the people who smoke pipes either people who care little
about their pipes (buy fairly cheap pipes, knock them out on the curb and
mangle the bowl) or obsessed with the minutia, able to relate the history of
each of their pipes and, like Joachim in the latest issue, planning to visit
pipe shops in new cities when they travel?   I confess to be in the latter
group and the discovery of this news group a great find.

Thanks

Subject: The Owl Shop and its age claim

To: Avik Roy
Subject: Owl Shop

Thanks for the description of the tradition of pipes at Yale.  When I
was at the Owl Shop in New Haven in April, I saw one of the old pipes
with the inlaid Y and class year, and wondered about its origin:
whether members of a club received them at graduation, whether they
were a limited edition each year or what.  You solved the mystery.

I knew Ehrlichs and Leavitt &amp; Pierce long before I found the Owl Shop
in Worcester and then New Haven.  Perhaps the reference to being the
oldest refers to their blending on the premises rather than having
their blends made by others.  In that regard, I would think Perretti's
would give them a run for their money if they were founded in 1934.  A
best I know only the Owl Shops and Perretti still mix on the premises
in the New England area.  Am I missing anyone of which you know?

Subject: Twin Cities Cigar Smokers

I moved to the Twin Cities recently, and was wondering what kind of interest
existed out there for an informal "smoke night" of sorts.  Nothing too fancy
-- just find a cigar-friendly bar, of which there are a few, get a few good
cigars each, and smoke away for the evening.  I'm a relative newcomer to
cigars, under six months, and therefore if someone has run one of these
before, I would be more than happy to cede organizational responsibility to
him or her.  If you are a resident of Minneapolis or St. Paul (or the
outlying suburbs) and are interested in doing something like this, drop me
some email.  I noticed several "U" students have just signed onto the list,
so there should be more than a few of us Upper Midwesterners.
 
 - Mike.  (??????????@???.???)

[ Good luck, Mike, and please let us know how you make out! -S. ]

Subject: Re: Moderated mailgroup for cigars, pipes, fine tobacco

	I have just joined the mailgroup. As an introduction: I am 35 years
old and have been smoking good cigars for a few months and a pipe off
and on for several years. My regular cigars are the Baccarat Churchill
and Platinum and the Cuba Aliados Fuma. I enjoy trying others. I only
smoke pipes occasionally. I am beginning to think that I'm not really
going to feel that attachment to a pipe util I create my own, so I am
interested in more info about pipe making. 

	To the gentleman coming to Charlotte for a few days, there are few
choices here in the city, but here they are. 
	1. Tinder Box at Eastland Mall, at SouthPark Mall, and at Carolina
Place Mall. Typical mall tobacco and gift shop. If you've seen one,
you've seen the mall. ;-)
	2. The Humidor Tobacco Shop, 316 Overstreet Mall in "Uptown"
Charlotte. The only tobacco shop downtown (only we say "Uptown" in
Charlotte). I'm told it is small, but I haven't been to this one. This
is near "the Square" which is not a square, just the intersection of
Trade Street and Tryon Street.
	3. McCranie's Pipe Shop, Park Road Shopping Center. I have gotten
incorrect info on cigars here, but I can't evaluate their pipe
knowledge. Expensive; this is a reflection of its character. 

	If you want to save money, you want to go to JR Tobacco. It's about
45 minutes from downtown. Drive north on I-77 to exit 50. It is right
there; you can't miss it. They have a large selection of discounted
tobacco products and accessories, including pipes. They sell the Black &amp;
Mild pouch *six-pack* for $9.35. :-)

	While your here, stop at Dundee's for dinner (Independence Blvd at
Sharon Amity). It is a casual, distinctly American faux Australian place
with a bar, and you can smoke your pipe or cigar there.

Subject: Answers, Anyone?

Steve,
	I wrote to you a while back and asked to be put on your mailing
list for Pipes Digest.  I recieved #146 and was sent #147 from my cousin
at Rose-Hulman.  (Thanks Neil!!)  I would like very much to be put back
on the list.  Thanks alot!
	Here's a question maybe someone can help me with.  I'm
a 22 year old college senior who has been smoking off and on since 15.
Right now I am switching back and forth between cheap cigars (Swisher
Sweets, wood tip) and a pipe.  I like the taste of the Swishers, but
the smell bothers me.  I love the smell of the pipe.  Is it possible 
to have the taste of Swishers in a pipe?  Just wondering.......

[ Swisher Imports distributes a brand of tobak called Brindley's
Mixture, which can be ordered through JR Cigar. Don't know if this is
the same stuff, though... -S. ]

Subject: XXXXXL pipes

   I just finnished a few of the back issues of the P.G.... Great stuff.
  On the subject of this posting:  I finally found a pipe carver who will
make quality pipes to my specs.  J.M. Boswell (717) 264 - 1711 (Chambersburg,
PA).  I recieved my first (by no means last) custom briar from this tallented
gentleman.  The total process took far less than a month from order to
reciept of the pipe.  
The dimensions are aprox. as follows:
Chamber diameter - 1 1/2"
Bowl Diameter - 3"
Bowl Hieght - 3+"
Overall length - 10+"
Color - Med. light brown
Stem - 1/4 curve
Shape - Apple
  I haven't calculated the chamber's capacity, but I can fill the pipe after
dinner and smoke it until the 11:00 news comes on.......
   Also, I would like to plug my local tobacconist: 
 BRIAR ROSE (owned by Shane Pappas)
20700 S. Avalon Blvd. Suite # 560
Carson, CA  90746
(800) 232-1323
   This is a nice little mall shop.  They have a reasonably sized walk in
humidor with a good selection of both cigars and pipe tobacco.  Unlike most
shops, Shane hand selects his pipes.  The briar selection isn't huge, but is
always interesting (I got my first 2 Boswell pieces here).  Another plus,
most of his staff is fully versed in our pleasures.
Until next time...
Joel

[ Great, Joel, and welcome! -S. ]

Hi, Steve!

You've probably gotten a lot of responses to Jeff (in the last
digest).  Well, here's another one, include it in the next digest if
you like.  I suppose I shouldn't find it surprising that a person who
professes to enjoy smoking would aid and abet the regulators, but oh
well. . . .

See ya  \\JR

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeff, will all due respect -- I don't think you've fully thought out
your arguments.  The problem with the proposed smoking legislation is
twofold:

1.  It *is* indeed largely based, as Steve points out, in
axe-grinding.  There's more interest in "bashing the tobacco
companies" than in health issues.

2.  Potentially the worst problem: it never ends.  I also live in
California and if I've noticed anything, it's that when the public
do-gooders get their teeth into something, they never let go.  You
mentioned that " . . . If they were coming into my house and telling
me what to do, I'd be offended, but they're not.".  Well, guess what
-- they are!  It's now being said that people who live, for example,
in apartment buildings should not be allowed to smoke in their own
rooms because the smoke could travel up or down into other people's
rooms.  Nonsense of course, but this is *what people believe*.

As you can tell I feel quite strongly about this.  The reports on
"secondhand smoke" are largely spurious; the reports on smoking itself
are largely spurious; time and precious resources are being wasted on
a non-problem.  If you continue to lend your tacit support to the
"other side", the day will soon come when you won't even be able "to
step outside and enjoy your cigar or pipe".  I don't smoke when or
where it's inappropriate, but, as a free person, I shall smoke where
it *is* appropriate!  And, in California, I *have* been hassled while
smoking outside in the open air.  Please think about it and don't give
up your freedoms quite so cavalierly.

I've beenhassled for smoking in my _car_.  The lady was following me
for about 5 or 6 miles before whe finally passed me and held her nose
and made some stupid face.  I was hoping she would pull up to me again

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #147 - July 8, 1994

Jeff "The Traitor" Lowell checking in. ;)

Rather than try to answer everything, I'll just thank those who agreed with
me, and post a general clarification to others.

I think there are two extremes of thought here, and like most polarizing
debates, people on both extremes are worried that any compromise will
ultimately mean the utter erosion of their rights.

Well, I'm all for compromise, and I sincerely believe that it won't spell
the end of smoking as we know it.  I should be able to smoke outside and in
the privacy of my own home, at the very least.  Some people say that
they've been hassled while smoking outside... well, I've been hassled for a
lot of things that are my right to do, and I simply stand up for myself.
(Memorize a few of the snappy comebacks at the end of every digest.)  If
legislation was introduced that banned me from smoking outside, I would
fight it... however, I really do not believe such legislation will ever be
introduced.

The question of smoking in the house, specifically an apartment, is a
trickier one.  I would fight legislation that said I couldn't smoke in an
apartment, but if someone complained about it in the absence of
legislation... well, the only way someone could know if I were smoking in
my house is if they could smell the smoke.  So, if someone _did_ complain,
I would try to keep my smoke from getting to them, so they had nothing to
complain about.

This actually happened to me at work:  my office is near the intake vent
for the air conditioning.  All winter, I smoked with no problems.  But come
summer, when I smoked, the people in other offices complained about the
smell of my cigars.  Obviously they could smell it -- they wouldn't have
known to complain otherwise.  So, I simply bought a fan for my window
pointed out -- end of complaints.  If I couldn't have stopped the cigar
smell from permeating the building, I wouldn't have liked it, but I would
have respected the other people and stopped smoking.

As Voltaire said, "one must tend one's own garden."  Or something very
close to that -- it's been a few years. ;)

[ Quite a reasonable viewpoint, I'd say, Jeff. And there are no
traitors here; just people with differing opinions. 

But, between our homes and the whole world, there is still some
disputed turf on the issue of where people are allowed to smoke.
Unless the antis are opposed, they will seize it. Personally, I'm of
the libertarian persuasion where this is concerned --- let society do
its own social engineering, and keep the government out of it. -S. ]

	Hi Steve and fellow pipers, just dropping a note to introduce
myself and what I think about smoking.  Im 21 years old and i'm 
currently attending Elgin Community College here in Elgin, IL.
Im a CS Major currently finishing up on an Associates Degree. I
plan on transfering to Winona State, MN next spring.

	Okee enuff of that.  I enjoy smoking very much.  I prefer
nice big fat cigars which last a LONG time.  Currently I like the 
A. Fuente Gran Reserva, it's a fatty so you best watch it!
I have been smoking everything I can {:) for the last few years.
I hope we can get this newsletter/mailinglist ROCKIN! Thanks to 
Steve and all of you, now I have found my destiny!

Subject: Introduction

Steve,
	Thanks for signing me on to the Pipes Digest.  I've received 
several now and would appreciate it if you would send me numbers 1 - 
144.  I am enjoying what I've been reading so far.
	As a new member I'll introduce myself.  I'm 40 and have been
smoking pipes (with occasional forays into cigar and cigarette land)
since I was 17.  I've never been able to afford any really good brand
name pipes but enjoy immensely the few middle of the road pipes and 
a couple of slightly better than middle of the road pipes that I have
been given by friends over the years.  As far as tobacco, I lean towards
the English blends with Wally Franks' "Istanbul" being a favorite.
There are few tobacconists here in Denver and the couple that I 
consider worth a visit are quite a long trip across town.  As a result
I usually mail order most of my tobacco - so I much appreciate your
introductory digest with the list of tobacconists, etc.
	I am somewhat of a pariah in my family since I am the only
one who smokes.  My father used to smoke a pipe but gave it up a 
number of years ago (he and I used to go on long car trips through
the Rockies and I inevitably would get violently car sick with the
combination of his smoke, the altitude and the windy mountain 
roads - so I'm sympathetic to those who don't like second hand 
smoke).  My wife grudingly tolerates my smoking so I try to smoke 
outdoors or in the garage only.  So, as can be imagined, I appreciate
and enjoy this forum very much.
	I'll end with a question:  I was given a rather nicely 
grained pipe a number of years back with the name "Marcini" stamped
on the side and "Italy" on the shank.  I've never seen this make 
mentioned in any pipe literature that I've read.  Can anyone out 
there tell me something about this pipe maker?

[ Nobody here but us pariahs, Chris; welcome! And sorry, never heard
of Marcini. Any others? -S. ]

&gt; 
&gt; The other extension of this analogy is warning labels.  We are
&gt; required by Federal Law (29CFR1910) to communicate the hazards inside
&gt; a container w/ a warning label.  We are also required to have
&gt; complete information on each of these items in the form of a Material
&gt; Safety Data Sheet (MSDS).  Recent legal actions are trying to
&gt; discount the same type of warning printed on cigarette packages.
&gt; [And I note that I have never seen such a warning on my pipe tobacco
&gt; or on a cigar.]  How will the effect other industries that utilize
&gt; warning labels?  All I'm asking for is consistancy.

I have seen such a warning on some cigars and pipe tobacco from the 
state of California. I don't have it with me but I believe it was
a warning about possible reproductive harm and/or other health
problems.

[ I've seen it too, on almost every tinned tobacco product. JR Cigar
even printed it on their invoice, which they mailed to my
cigar-tradin' partner in California. (Didja get the Valverdes yet?) -S. ]

Subject: pipes &amp; cigars

Steve,

Thanks for sending me another copy of #148; there seems to be a
learning curve to using this mail reading software correctly.

To anyone who believes that the second-hand smoke studies *might*
have some basis in fact just think back to a decade ago. If you
lived in a big city do you remember garbage incinerators? There was
one in every apartment building here in New York City belching out
enormous volumes of choking smoke at least once a day. Do you
remember early diesel-powered buses and the clouds of noxious fumes
they expelled? Do you remember burning leaves in the autumn?
Everybody in NY at that time lived in an environment full of the 
smoke from incomplete combustion products. Was it good for us? Of 
course it wasn't, but we didn't all choke to death or get lung 
cancer. What person in his/her right mind could believe that an
occasional whiff of tobacco smoke could be *more* damaging than all
that?

I'd like to recommend a cigar store in Brooklyn I go to
occasionally. Walk-in humidor, nice selection of pipe tobaccos,
will special order for you and reasonable prices. The Cigar
Emporium at 1953 86th St. between 19th &amp; 20th Aves ("B" train to
20th Ave).

      Mark Landers      |     The object of opening the mind,
                        |        as of opening the mouth,
  ????????@??????.???   | is to close it again on something solid
                        |          - G. K. Chesterton

[ Where I live, trucks and buses, and the cars that manage to hose the
emissions tests, _still_ expel great billows of thick black smoke. And
it ain't even pleasant, like a pipe. And anyway, they'll never let you
into a ball game with a lit Greyhound clenched between your
teeth... -S.]

Steve,

I thought the readership might get a kick out of this (reprinted in Nature (vol
374) 30 March 1995):

Cecil Carus-Wilson writes:

"I have discovered a new method for cleaning tobacco pipes which have
become foul.  A shallow cork, through which a hole is bored large
enough to enable it to fit tightly on to the nozzle of a soda-water
syphon, is fitted onto the bowl.  The nozzle is inserted, the
mouth-piece directed into a vessel, about a wine-glassful of
soda-water forced through and the pipe is clean!  This is not a
scientific discovery, but it may be of use to those scientific men who
are smokers.  Rubber stoppers answer better than corks."

-From Nature 28 March 1895

Subject: Best pipe under $50?

This question confronted me several years ago after inheiriting and starting
to smoke some classic pipes from my father, followed by picking up some
modern freehand pipes at flea markets and antique stores. While I had bought
a couple of high quality pipes when  in Europe on business many years ago, I
wasn't smoking them regularly and didn't have adequate experience at
breaking-in then. 

In looking for a new pipe to buy and break-in I was disapointed. The
affordable ones were the flawed seconds or lower lines and didn't compare to
the quality of my pre-smoked pipes. Today the high quality pipes that I
desire are at over $200 each, so I still have not bought a new pipe at a shop
for the last 10 years. I have over 300 pipes in my collection and some are
unsmoked, received from trading with other collectors who bought them new. I
buy several pipes each month and I have very rarely paid more than $50 for
 the highest quality pre-smoked pipe.

I think the pre-smoked pipes are the best bargain by far! Of course it helps
if you have the skill to refurbish and santitize old pipes or buy from
someone who can. As a result of periodically thinning out my collection, I
have over 100 nice pipes available ($14 to $45) and have been occassionally
selling or trading them by E-mail with full satisfaction because they are
quality pipes, well cleaned  and sanitized and are offered at a small
increase over my original low purchase price with inspection/refund
privileges. This gives me spending money to pick up brands not already in the
collection. Let me know if you would be interested in pre-smoked pipes; I can
even put you on to the leading collectors if I don't have the brands or
styles you desire. In the meantime, thanks for your attention and I'll look
forward to hearing from you. Regards,.....Rex

Subject: Reminiscences

  Thanks, Steve, for the back issues you sent me last week--good reading!
And thanks for responding to my request so quickly.

  Reading all the various pipe smoking stories and anecdotes brought back
to mind my earliest attempts to smoke a pipe.  They were, looking back on
it now, quite comical (or perhaps pathetic is the word I'm looking for).

  When I was in junior high school I acquired by devious means a drugstore
pipe of some kind and a package of Cherry blend tobacco.  Of course, I knew
absolutely nothing about pipe smoking.  In fact, about the only thing I
thought I knew about smoking at all, was my mistaken conviction that
cigarette filters kept all the bad stuff away from the smoker.  Well, my
new pipe didn't have a filter like that, just some kind of metal
thingamabob.  So, what I did was remove the metal thingey and stuffed the
better part of a cosmetic puff into the smoke hole of the shank, replaced
the stem and, voila!  A filtered pipe!  Of course, you had to have the
lungs of a Highland bagpiper to draw on the thing, so I soon became
frustrated in my attempts to put in the tobacco and actually light it.
After a few unsatisfactory bowlfuls, I believe I buried pipe and pouch out
in the back yard so my mother wouldn't find it (she did not like 13-year
old boys smoking in any form whatsoever.  She obviously hadn't read the
1964 Surgeon General's report indicating that pipe smokers lived longer
than non-smokers).

  Now we move forward to 1971 to age 20.  By this time I had smoked
cigarettes for several years, but I was once again visited by the urge to
take up pipe smoking.  The drugstore I visited to buy my pipe and tobacco
had, astonishing as it may seem today, a resident tobaconnist--one of the
owners who smoked and so had stocked a moderate selection of briars and
tobacco blends.  I, of course, was expecting to spend no more than about
$5.00 for pipe, tobacco, and all, but he was shocked at the idea of anyone
smoking a _drugstore_ pipe.  Instead he provided me with a pipe that cost,
as I recall, about $10 and a couple ounces of one of his blends.  What he
didn't provide were instructions on how to smoke the blessed thing.  I
cheerfully tripped along home, gravity filled the bowl, and set a match to
it.  Now, whereas during my first pipe smoking adventure, I had no draw
whatsoever, this time around I had too much.  I think I actually sucked in
the flame itself.  A few shards of tobacco began smoldering and I puffed
furiously to keep them lit--to no avail, of course.  So I struck another
match and tried again...and again...and again.  About the only thing I
actually smoked were the matches.  This went on for a couple of bitterly
frustrating weeks, before I once again gave up.

  Fortunately, as they say, the third time's the charm.  In 1977, the lady
who was to become my first wife did just about the only good thing for me
that I can remember--she took me to a local tobacconist to get me started
in pipe smoking, figuring that it would be better for me than cigarettes.
This time it caught!  For one thing, I was older and wiser now, and managed
to ask questions and I went to the local libraries where they had copies of
"The Pipe" by Georges Herment and "The Book of Pipes and Tobacco" by Carl
Ehwa.  A little research, a little practice, and I've been smoking pipes
ever since.

  Now I've regaled you all with stories from my long-lost youth, I've got a
question for the PD readership.  Years ago I acquired a useful gadget
called a pipe cap.  It was basically, a bit of rubber molded so that it
would fit snuggly over the top of standard-shaped pipe and it served to
keep ash and tobacco from spilling out when the pipe was placed away in a
pocket.  I don't remember where I got it and would dearly love to get
another.  Does anyone out there know where one can find a pipe cap?  If so,
please e-mail me at ????????@???.???.  I've made a substitute using a wind
cap with the holes blocked with a bit of cut-up note card, but it doesn't
always stay on, so it's not nearly so satisfactory.

  Well, that's all for now (and the whispers echo back over the Internet,
"Thank _God_!).

The Ashton Pipe Story 
by. R. C. Hamlin 
 
I wrote the original copy of the Ashton Story in November 1988, 
revised it in January 1990, and have added a few "1994 updates" to 
the end of this issue. I hope that you enjoy learning why Ashton 
pipes are considered by many as the best England has to offer pipe 
smokers. Please feel free to post question and/or comments to me on 
the board. Please feel free to copy/print this article for your 
personal usage, however I will reserve the copyright of The Ashton 
Story for any commercial purpose. 
 
************** 
 
The Ashton pipe is fairly well known in today's pipe smoking 
circles.  Ashton pipes, in fact, do sell very well in all of the 
markets that they are in and are always in short supply.  What 
perhaps is not so well known is that this is a very new brandname 
that has only been in existence since 1983.  In these first years of 
production the Ashton pipe has progressed from an idea, to 
production, to possibly the most sought after and best crafted 
English high grade on the market.  The brand is now distributed not 
only in the United States but in England, Italy and Germany with the 
United States and Germany being Ashton's best markets. 
 
How could a new brand, especially an English brand considering the 
recent fortune of some of the other English makers, make it to the 
top of its industry in such a short while?  Basically by creating a 
better "mousetrap" that delivers as it promises.  While the 
brandname may be new there is a wealth of experience behind the 
brand.  This experience along with a burning desire to make the 
finest pipes on today's market have created the richly deserved 
success of Ashton Pipes - one that will continue to evolve in the 
years to come.  This is the story of their creator - Mr. William 
John Ashton Taylor, their catalyst and marketer - Mr. R. David Field 
and perhaps their most important attribute, you their smoker. 
 
Alfred Dunhill and his innovative ideas concerning the production of 
briar pipes is perhaps the single most important event in modern 
pipe smoking history.  Perhaps if Alfred Dunhill had not gone into 
the Tobacconist profession in 1910 and into the production of pipes 
in 1913, someone else would have modernized the curing of briar.  
However, no other person or company had, at least until then, really 
thought about how to make a briar pipe taste good, nor had anyone 
outside of St. Claude (France) truly set out to actually produce 
high grade briar pipes.  Alfred Dunhill pioneered this idea and for 
many years continued to purchase his bowls from France.  Where 
Dunhill differed was that after he received these bowls he cured the 
wood so that they were no longer "just" French bowls, but cured 
bowls to which he added his brandname and his finishing. 
 
The Dunhill story is much longer and full of new principles as far 
as how to produce a quality briar smoking pipe, but this is not a 
story about Dunhill.  This story is about a modern day pioneer that 
was in fact introduced to the Dunhill manufacturing process and the 
idea behind it, as an employee of Alfred Dunhill, Ltd. of London for 
almost three decades.  The result is the Ashton pipe as we see it 
today, full of innovations, made to be the best handmade smoking 
pipe possible and continuing to mature toward something even better.  
 
There are many parallels that can be made between Alfred Dunhill and 
William John Ashton Taylor as their ideas and ambition are similar.  
While perhaps Alfred Dunhill was more of the merchant and Mr. Taylor 
is more of the craftsman, both are very important in the evolution 
of pipes and this article will point this out occasionally. 
 
William John Ashton Taylor was born in 1945 into a world of virtual 
chaos in Britain, one that had suffered the full force of World War 
II not only in damage to its economy and population, but from years 
of bombing raids to London and the surrounding area.  The post war 
era was not an easy one and this is exactly the time and environment 
in which William Taylor (Bill) was raised.  In 1959, at the age of 
14 and while still pursuing his education, Bill applied for and was 
granted an apprenticeship with Alfred Dunhill of London. 
 
England was still rebuilding from the war in Europe and I don't know 
how hard employment was to come by in that post war time, but a job 
at the Dunhill Pipe Factory offered employment and training in a 
skilled trade.  The first year of training (during his 
apprenticeship) was spent hand crafting cigarette holders.  The next 
17 years were spent making briar pipes, with the last 9 of this 17 
acting as the foreman or supervisor.  This "production" time was 
followed by 7 years of management responsibilities involving quality 
control of pipes and tobacco, product development duties while 
maintaining the title of "Quality Control Manager".   
 
Bill used his skill in pipemaking to give demonstrations in the Duke 
Street Dunhill store (plus most of the other Dunhill sales locations 
in London such as Harrods, etc.).  In 1984, after 25+ years learning 
and practicing his "skilled trade", William John Ashton Taylor left 
the security of Alfred Dunhill to pursue his life long dream of 
owning and operating his own company. 
 
The Ashton pipe was an exciting entry onto the United States market 
in 1983.  With Bill Taylor's experience in quality control, 
development of pipes and tobacco and in not only his learned pipe 
making skills, but the secrets that were taught to him by those that 
he apprenticed under, the Ashton pipe would have to succeed.  Things 
are never as simple as they seem and without the intervention, 
encouragement and financial backing of Mr. R. David Field, Bill 
Taylor would not have left Dunhill in 1984 and the Ashton pipe as we 
know it today would not exist. 
 
David Field was an American Dunhill collector and student of pipe 
making, pipe usage, tobacco and their history.  In the early 1980's 
David made several trips to England and Italy in search of knowledge 
and artisan pipemakers to share in their knowledge, as well as learn 
as much as possible about pipes and tobacco firsthand.  In England 
David spent considerable time searching out information on Dunhill 
pipes and spent time visiting the Dunhill Archives, along with 
several tours of the Dunhill pipe making operation. 
 
During one of David's London visits, he attended a pipemaking 
demonstration hosted by Bill Taylor and saw firsthand the precision 
and skill that this "Quality Control Manager" processed.  David 
purchased every Taylor Made pipe (as they were called) that he could 
get his hands on and became consumed with not only the product, but 
with its producer and his skill.  After David returned to 
Philadelphia and with a small assortment of freshly produced "Taylor 
Made" pipes, the idea of marketing this line in the United states 
grew to the point that David knew that he had to act on the idea.  
 
To import and market a complete new line of pipes, especially an 
English brand to compete with Dunhill and Charatan, was not an easy 
quest.  The quality of these Taylor Made pipes was special though 
and would succeed if properly introduced to the American smoker 
along with carefully planning of quality control and production.  Up 
until now David had purchased a few handmade pipes on his travels to 
Italy and England, these he sold to friends and collectors to help 
defray the cost of his trip(s).  The marketing of Taylor Made pipes 
was not just a few pieces to a few friends, but the idea just would 
not leave him alone. 
 
David decided to contact this craftsman that we had witnessed in 
London and while he knew his name to be William Taylor, he didn't 
have an address or phone number.  A letter was written to William 
Taylor, care of Dunhill of London and marked PERSONAL.  This was 
mailed and did get to Bill, but only after it was inadvertently read 
by Bill's supervisor at Dunhill.  The letter was brief and basically 
said "Mr. Taylor, I would like to sell the pipes you are making in 
America - Please contact me as soon as possible at (address &amp; phone 
number)."  David's letter almost got Bill Taylor fired from Dunhill 
and necessitated a personal conference between Bill and his 
administrator in which Bill had to explain his involvement with 
someone that he did not know and in a letter that he had not seen.  
During this conference Bill read the letter, noted the phone number 
on it assured his supervisor that he was not interested in the 
offer.  Later that same day Bill Taylor placed a call to 
Philadelphia; Ashton pipes were soon to become a reality.   
 
Bill Taylor had actually started, in 1980, a small "one man" repair 
business under the name of Briarwoods of London.  This repair 
business specialized in the repair of Antique Meerschaum pipes for 
the quality pipe stores of London and expanded into briar pipe 
repairs soon thereafter.  Bill's repair business was done more as a 
hobby than as a means of income, but being that there was already a 
business set up and in place, the creation of Ashton Pipes was made 
a little easier. 
 
In 1984 Bill Taylor left the security of Dunhill and set out to 
create the Ashton Pipe that would be introduced in the United States 
by David Field.  This was not an easy thing for Bill to do since he 
had a wife and two small children to support.  Bill's position at 
Dunhill not only held security, but there was already a career and 
certainly a future guaranteed.  Possibly the deciding factor for 
Bill was that David offered to advance a full year's pay as start up 
money.  With this assurance, Bill Taylor resigned his position at 
Alfred Dunhill and the Ashton pipe was born. 
 
The driving force behind the production of Ashton pipes was that 
Bill could take the knowledge that he had obtained during his 25+ 
years at Dunhill and improve the process to produce even a better 
smoking line of pipes.  David would take care of distribution in the 
United States and would take every pipe that Bill produced.  Each 
Ashton pipe was to be hand turned and not machine fraised as Dunhill 
pipes were and each would be oil cured with a new and improved 
process that went beyond that of Dunhill's system.  The early years 
of 1984 and 1985 were not without their problems and as most 
companies find out, turning ideas into reality is not as simple as 
it may seem. 
 
The first problem was to turn a small repair shop into a fully 
operational pipe making facility.  Equipment had to be purchased, a 
continual supply of high quality briar had to be found, stem 
material had to be stocked and if these start up problems were not 
enough, production had to get under way as soon as possible.  The 
balance of 1984 (after Bill had left Dunhill) saw very few Ashton 
pipes actually being produced and those that were tended to be on 
the smaller side.  In 1985 the new Ashton "factory" became fully 
functional and saw Bill's ideas of making the finest English briar 
pipe on today's market become a reality.  This too, created 
unforseen problems for this new operation.  The curing process had 
to be perfected which required experimentation with the blend of 
oils used to "oil cure", the time frame for processing the briar and 
with the temperature in which the briar would cure properly, but not 
harm the wood. 
 
All of these experiments took place during the actual production of 
Ashton pipe manufacturer and of all of the pieces that have been 
returned as poor smokers, most are from the 1985 era.  The final 
"perfect" time frame for curing - ended up as 14 days on the heat 
plugs.  Before I go on with this history I want to take a few lines 
to explain - the oil curing method and why the Ashton pipe, by using 
this method, is unique. 
 
The Ashton pipe is Oil Cured using Alfred Dunhill's original concept 
of forcing oil through the briar with heat.  This process cleans the 
wood of sap residue and makes the break in process easier.  The 
Ashton oil cure takes this concept a step further and uses a "blend" 
of three different oils, all with various properties.  The pipes are 
soaked in a oil bath until the wood has absorbed as much as possible 
(of the oil blend).  The briar is then placed on copper Heat Plugs 
for 14 days with the temperature raised and lowered thus forcing the 
oil through the wood.  The end result is a clean piece of briar with 
all of the extra sap, and its bitterness, removed.  In its place 
there is a slight internal coating of the oils which "flavor" the 
briar with a nutty or wood taste. 
 
The problems with using this timely and expensive process is that 
many of the bowls crack and those that do stand up to the treatment 
typically have sand marks pushed to the surface with the flow of the 
oil under heat.  As a result there are very few smooth Ashton pipes 
produced with straight grains being extremely rare in smooth.  If 
the curing process goes on too long or at too high a temperature, 
the fibers of the wood break down and "over cook" which causes a 
burned tasted along with a very high percentage of cracked bowls.   
An equal but opposite problem is created by curing at too low a 
temperature or for too short a period of time.  In this case the 
wood is left heavy with oils which causes a wet smoke without the 
nutty flavor, plus the bowls tend to run heavy for their size.  Much 
of early 1985 was spent perfecting this process which is now as 
efficient as possible, although the problem of producing a higher 
percentage of smooth Ashton cured bowls has not been resolved. 
 
In 1986 the Ashton "pipeworks" was up and running at full steam with 
hungry American smokers lusting for additional supplies of this new 
brand.  During this period, close to 100% of Bill's pipes were still 
coming to the United States (1 shop in London had a few Ashton 
pipes).  The reputation of the line was growing and additional 
markets were looked into including Italy and Germany.  These would 
start to see a few pieces in late 1985 (early 1986) and would 
continue to grow in demand through present day, although the United 
States still enjoys the greater part of Bill Taylor's production. 
 
Currently over 40% of the Ashton pipes produced in 1988 will go to 
the United States, 30% to Germany, 20% are sold in the U.K. and 10% 
are offered to Italy.  All of these markets have developed within 
the last several years and all have the same complaint -"Send more 
pipes".   
 
1986 could be probably be marked as the year that Bill turned the 
corner and became a major player in modern English pipe production.  
A new (and expensive) sandblasting machine was purchased and Ashton 
Pipes sponsored the first Ashton Pipe festival in London for the 
American pipe dealers attending the Dunhill PPD event in London.   
There has always been a shortage of these high quality pipes and in 
1986, on the night before the Ashton show in London, the whole 
"crew" worked into the early morning hours finishing pieces to 
display for dealers the next morning.  A large display of several 
hundred pieces were offered the festival attenders, many were unique 
designs created for the show. 
 
During 1985 when Bill was experimenting with curing and getting his 
new business off the ground, he took time to experiment with a new 
process of finishing briar.  This process was reserved for special 
blocks of briar that held such tight and dense grain that they would 
produce heavy pipes.  It was the density of these blocks that caused 
the problem of weight though and not the age.  Once these special 
blocks of briar had been cured they were still too heavy to please 
most users.  With "standard" grade briar this extra weight could be 
blasted away with slightly increased blasting pressure.  With extra 
dense briar, if the pressure of the sandblaster was turned up to 
blast away extra wood, the dense grain was blasted away also.  The 
wood had to be saved as it was some of the very best as far as its 
smoking attributes and so Mr. William John Ashton Taylor set out to 
correct this problem and in the process once again followed the foot 
steps of Alfred Dunhill in his innovative thinking.   
 
Bill's solution was special, so much so that he filed for an English 
Patent for his new process on June 21, 1985 and this patent was 
approved and granted July 6, 1988.  This new process of finishing a 
smoking pipe bowl was the first "pipe manufacturing" inventions 
granted an English patent in over 20 years.  As with most patented 
ideas, Bill's process while functional, is not that difficult. 
 
Basically the bowls are cured like any other Ashton pipe bowl by 
soaking them in oil, cured with heat over time and then subjecting 
the outer surface to a high pressure jet of steam that raises and 
swells the softer grain on the bowl.  This softer grain is 
"rusticated" or carved away (but not the hard dense grain) before 
the pipe is sandblasted.  Between the carving and sandblasting these 
"Pebble Shell" pipes lose 20 to 25% of their weight and yet they 
keep 100% of their beneficial grain.   
 
There were less than 24 "Shells" produced in 1985 and 1986; these 
were marked Pat. Pend.  1987 saw few if any Ashton Shells.  In early 
1988 there were less than 10 produced that not only included the 
newly issued patent number but an extra single digit (1,2,3 etc.) 
that denoted that these were the very first "patented" Ashton Pebble 
Shell pipes produced.  Number 3 from this first group is in my 
personal collection of pipes. 
 
At this point you may start to understand why I consider Bill Taylor 
to be someone very special as far as a pipemaker and his products.  
Bill's current "factory" has just relocated to a new unit (as he 
calls it), which is still only 1200 SF in size.  This new unit will 
allow the Ashton pipe to be made in a more uniform way with every 
bit of the operation carried out in pre-assigned areas.  Currently 
Ashton produces his pipes in 3 basic finishes, although several 
variations of these are in the works. 
 
The Pebble Grain is a sandblasted finish that is usually stained 
black with deep red highlights, although some are brown stained.  
The Brindle finish is a dark brown stained sandblast that is matched 
with a brown colored vulcanite mouthpiece.  The patented Pebble 
Shell and Brindle Shell are sandblasted and carved finishes similar 
in color to other sandblasted models.  All 1988 and later "Shell's" 
will include the patented number 2176742 within their nomenclature.  
Smooth finished Ashton pipes are graded as either Sovereign or SG (1 
to 5) for graded straight grains.  Smooth Ashton pipes are golden 
colored with waxed bowls and can have either black or brown 
vulcanite mouthpieces. 
 
The nomenclature on Ashton pipes will include the series (Sovereign, 
Pebble Shell, etc) a "size" (explained a little later in this 
section), a year date (4=1984, 5=1985, 6=1986, etc.) the brandname 
(Ashton) and the point of origin (England).  The Ashton logo is a 
"Dunhill Spot" which is actually an inlaid briar dot on the top of 
the handcut mouthpiece. 
 
One area that stands out with Ashton pipes is how Bill has taken the 
basic idea of a "rod stock" mouthpiece a little farther than 
Dunhill.  Rod stock means that the mouthpiece is formed from a solid 
rod of hard rubber (vulcanite) rather than preformed or molded 
blanks (cast stock).  These rods are about four feet in length 
before they are cut for stems and are about one inch wide.  The rod 
is cut into 3 or 4 inch lengths and then cured by boiling.  This 
process removes the sulfur from the surface of the hard rubber stem 
material which in turn makes a harder mouthpiece that resists 
discoloration.  Mouthpieces are formed using drills and files, each 
custom fit to match the bowl in both size and shape. 
 
Like Dunhill, Ashton grades his pipes by their size and in the case 
of the SG straight grains, by grain.  Both smooth and sandblasted 
models are available in 1X (Dunhill group 3 or 4), 2X (group 4 or 
5), 3X (group 5 or 6) and LX (group 6 or ODA size).  By theory the 
other sizes produced by Bill Taylor come in both smooth and 
sandblasted but in actuality, these are only available in non-smooth 
pieces.  The ELX is an extra large size, usually reserved for 
standard shaped pipes.  The "Magnum" and its variations are extra, 
extra large classic shaped pipes that while limited in production to 
less than 20 pieces per year, are very special and unique to the 
Ashton line. 
 
While Magnums are expensive, they offer an outstanding smoking 
experience as the amount of cured briar included with each piece is 
extensive.  Ashton first produced Magnums in a series of 
"Presentation Pipes" housed in custom fitted wood cases.  These 
presentation "Magnums" were not stamped magnum.  The true graded 
Magnum series followed with Magnum "S" (smaller, but still extra 
large) and standard Magnums.  There have also been several "Double 
Magnums" produced which are extremely large examples, although there 
is no additional nomenclature that denotes their extra size. 
 
One of the major problems in producing quality pipes, expecially 
those that are as carefully produced as the Ashton line, is in the 
availability of highly skilled craftsmen to create the line.  When 
Bill went out on his own in 1984 he was depending on his skill and 
experience to produce the pipes that carry his trademark.  However, 
the demand of his line quickly exceeded any capacity that he alone 
could produce and additional craftsmen were needed to increase 
production. Currently the Ashton pipe is produced by the joint 
effort of Jeffrey Mills (stems), Mrs. Y. Mills (finishing), Frank 
Lincoln (total pipe maker - all facets), Sid Cooper (bowl turning, 
with 50+ years experience) and of course Bill Taylor, who is a total 
pipe maker with over 28 years experience. [See note at end revising 
current Ashton employees.] 
 
Within this family, each has a primary skill, however all are able 
to work all of the phases and as a rule, each will work on each 
Ashton pipe.  What this means is that the creation of an Ashton pipe 
is not just the work of one skilled craftsman, but a joint effort of 
all.  This joint effort allows each craftsman to take pride in the 
finished product with each knowing that his skill is a part of the 
final results. 
 
What about the future of Ashton pipes?  In the first years of 
production Bill Taylor has advanced the "Dunhill" process of 
producing a pipe, using his modifications of oil curing, stem 
curing, hand turning bowls, hand making pipe stems, creating a new 
and patented finishing process and added pipe tobacco and cigars to 
his family of products.  Is this all, or are there other ideas in 
the wings? 
 
New products are coming including a new "Tan Shell" light colored 
sandblasted finish which will be called OLD CHURCH (hopefully 
sometime in early 1989).  The Ashton Cigar line is being expanded 
and tobacco line is being expanded to 10 different blends.  Smoking 
cabinets, pouches, special presentation sets and an increased supply 
of patented Pebble Shell pipes should be arriving within the near 
future and after that, who knows? 
 
When asked about his personal and company philosophy William John 
Ashton Taylor responded by saying "To maintain the highest quality 
standards and to be one of the very few true pipe makers. Meaning 
that I start by selecting the briar from the sawmill, age the briar, 
select the best block for a shape, cut and turn the bowl, cure the 
turned shape, handcraft a mouthpiece to a perfect balance, stain and 
finish the pipe and create as near as perfect pipe as I can with all 
of my heart."  It is also the intention of this new company to 
expand into new areas with the same dedication to quality that they 
have shown in their short history. 
 
William Taylor's story is just starting to be told as his "life's 
dream" of owning his own company has come about, and yet is only a 
few years old.  Today's Ashton pipe is as fine a product as can be 
produced in terms of materials and construction.  The end result is 
a handmade smoking pipe that while unique in their individuality, 
are made to be tasted and enjoyed.  The Ashton company is one in 
which production in numbers will always be second to production of 
quality.  One in which the craftsmen behind the final product take 
pride in their work, along with how you judge their efforts. 
 
While it is true that Bill Taylor was trained by Dunhill and learned 
his trade from the company that started high grade pipe 
manufacturer, he has continued to advance these principles of pipe 
making to a new level of excellence.  From a 15 year old apprentice 
turning cigarette holders in 1959 to England's most sought after 
pipe manufacturer in 1989.  The Ashton success story may be a dream 
come true for Bill Taylor, but it is also a pipe smokers success 
story.  Your acceptance and smoking enjoyment of the Ashton pipe is 
the true meaning of success to William John Ashton Taylor and to 
this end he has dedicated his company's efforts.  In today's market 
philosophy, this too is a rare and innovative idea. 
 
END of Original ASHTON Story 
 
*************************** 
 
Update to the Ashton Story from 1990-94 
 
The new Ashton Old Church Tan Shell finish went into full production 
in 1989 with less than 50 pieces produced during the first year.  
Old Church, by the way is the name of the Street that where the 
Ashton Unit is located. The Old church finish is a non-stained 
natural tan color that is moderately dark for a natural finish.  
This darkening is caused by the oil curing process that "cooks" the 
wood.  There is no additional staining or finish added to the Old 
Church, although a slight wax finish is added to polish the bowls.  
Almost all Old Church Ashtons are found with the dark brown stems (a 
few have black bits).   
 
This new finish was produced in both the standard sandblasted finish 
and patented "Shell" process which included the patent number.  Of 
the Old Church pipes produced in this first year most were 2X and 3X 
in size.  A few 1X and LX were offered, but no ELX were made.  There 
has been only 1 Old Church Magnum produced.  This was a medium large 
Billiard with a black saddle bit and nomenclature that read "USA 
001" and is in my personal Collection along with a signed pen &amp; ink 
of the pipe. 
 
The number of workers in the Ashton factory was decreased in 1989 
with the departure of Mr. and Mrs. Mills.  Although it was not 
mentioned in the main article, Mr. Taylor also works in the 
production of Ashton pipes as both as Ashton pipe finisher (stain &amp; 
wax) and the company office manager. As of 1993, Bill's son (Spence) 
has become a full time employee of Ashton pipes.  
 
In 1989 Ashton Products introduced a new line of small cigars, an 
expanded line of hand made Dominican cigars, a series of luxury 
leather cigar cases and 6 new Ashton tobaccos.  As of 1994 Ashton 
large Cigars are very successful in the United States and England.  
For 1990 there were continued expansions into quality leather goods, 
more Old Church pipes and special silver trimmed Ashton pipes (rim, 
spigots and maybe a windcap model).  Starting in 1990 non-smooth 
Ashton pipes will be marked "Shell" rather than Pebble Shell or 
Pebble Grain. As of 1994, this has not completely taken place, 
however the plan is still to produce on "Shell" and smooth Ashtons.  
In addition the patent number will be used on the pipes that are 
carved and blasted, even though all will be marked "Shell".  Over 
the last several years many pieces were mis-marked Pebble Shell or 
Pebble Grain.  The marking of only "Shell" to all non-smooth Ashtons 
will correct this problem. 
 
If you have collected Ashton pipes or have seen quite a few of the 
new patented pieces, you may have noted that there have been three 
different patent numbers used over the last several years.  While 
there was only one patent actually granted Ashton, there is a reason 
for the different patent numbers.  When the patent was first applied 
for the pipes were stamped Pat. Pend. without a number.  After the 
patent was granted the first patent number was stamped on Ashton 
pipes.  This first patent was granted in the name of William John 
Taylor (no Ashton), and so a correction was requested for the proper 
and complete name.  The re-issued "corrected" patent contained a new 
patent number which was then used on the pipes.  In 1989 the final 
"approved after response period" patent papers were issued which 
contained a new final number that is currently used on Ashton pipes. 
 
Starting in 1994, Ashton straight grains are no longer marked SG-1 
or SG-2, but are now marked SG plus A, B, C, D, E for the grade of 
grain. As of late 1994, the Ashton tobacco line is being redesigned 
to include 4 of the original 10 mixtures, plus 6 or 8 new blends 
that should arrive in stores in late 1994 or early 1995. The new 
Ashton tobacco line (all blends) will be produced by McClelland 
Tobacco Company. 
 
Another Collector Fact is that the first Ashton pipes were actually 
produced in late 1983 with most of these using block nomenclature 
rather than the script stampings of 1984 to present.  There are 
other variations to the nomenclature on Ashton pipes that have 
occurred over the years.  These variations will add value to the 
line to the variety collector of Ashton pipes.  The Ashton pipe is a 
new brand that was started just a few years ago and yet have already 
produced a wide variety of products for both the collector and 
smoker.  It is rare in today's market to see a company go back to 
basics and offer a line that puts the product before the profit; 
Ashton does!  There is a bright future for this brand as they offer 
something for everyone.   

[ Whew! Thanks for the story! -S. ]

Subject: Congrats, etc.

Dear Steve:

This posting will be (mercifully) short owing to an acute shortage of units
of calibrated time measurement on my part.

First of all, congratulations on passing the 1000-member mark!  I celebrated
the ocassion by smoking a WONDERFUL Bering Baron maduro.  I remember when
Berings were drug-store cigars.  Boy, have they come a long way since then!

Also, I recently did an "oops" and accidentally blew off about 8 back issues
of PD.  Please let me know if there's an ftp site where I can access back
issues.  I don't want to impose on your time since it was my boo-boo, so
rather than ask you to download the missing PD's I'd have no problem just
doing it from the appropriate ftp site.  BTW - for you non-techies out there
an "oops" is a "duh" with a possible excuse due to technical reasons.

And finally...

Tom Bliley's report is finally available through the Net.  Since AOL only
lets me download from ftp's I had to rely on a friend of mine to get it on to
an ftp site.  For those of you know don't know what the Bliley report is (or
for those of you who've forgotten) here is the description as contained in
the file i.d.:

     "This file contains two documents.  The first is a statement made by
     Congressman Thomas J. Bliley, Jr. (R. - Virginia) before Congress on
     July 21, 1993.  This statement concerns the Environmental Protection
     Agency (EPA) and its work on environmental tobacco smoke (ETS).
     
     "The second document is Rep. Bliley's report of his investigation of
     the EPA, with regards to both its ETS report, and its involvement in
     the ETS controversy leading up to the release of its risk assessment
     in January, 1993.  Rep. Bliley's report is extensively footnoted, and
     contains much information unknown to the general public.

     "THIS IS A PUBLIC DOCUMENT AND CAN BE FREELY DISTRIBUTED." 

Now here's the pertinent information.

FTP SITE:  ftp.demon.co.uk
DIRECTORY:  /pub/doc/liberty/FOREST
SHORT FILENAME:  Bliley Report
LONG FILENAME:  Bliley Report to US Congress, EPA disregarding own rules!
FILE SIZE:  117,244 bytes
DOWNLOAD TIME:  &lt;5 minutes (9600 BAUD)

After scanning Bliley's report I had to spend a lot of time cleaning up
formatting glitches and errors made by the OCR software. Numerous checks
against the hard-copy original have ensured that file is a 100% accurate
word-for-word transcription of the report.  I would enjoy hearing from those
of you who download and read this file.

Also - I would appreciate it if someone could help me pass this information
along to alt.smokers, alt.smokers.cigars and alt.smokers.pipes.  My free time
these days is very,very, very limited, and I'd be thankful for an assist in
publicizing the Bliley report's availability.  Since the anti's enjoy a
monopoly on the news media I think it's about time people get some factual
information on the other side of this issue.

Vive le Resistance!

Steve J. (Briar Man) 

[ Steve, I've already posted to a.s.c and a.s.p. announcing the
availability of the Bliley Report, and have distributed it to about 20
requestors. (I've specifically avoided a.s, as I think it'd generate
more trouble than it's worth there.)  I'll prepend your notice to
further copies of the report that I distribute. And thank you very
very very much for your diligence! I know what a pain scanning text
can be. Vive le Resistance!  -S. ]

Subject: Escudo

Hello, Steve,
  In reading back issues of the Digest I have come across numerous
references to Escudo tobacco and a) how wonderful it is and b) how
difficult it is to find.  Well, wanting to try some, I just ordered a
50-gram tin from Iwan Ries (1-800-621-1457).  I asked if they had a fair
amount in stock and the gal on the phone said yes, but only in the 50-gram
size; the 100-gram size having been discontinued.  Their price is $8.30 for
the 50 grams.  I just thought other pipe smokers on the list wanting to get
some might be interested in this information.  According to their price
list, they also have what appears to be a full selection of other favorite
brands including Dunhill, McClelland, and MacBaren.

Subject: Intro

Gudday! 

After lurking for quiet a while I have decided I had better let you
all know a little about me. I live in Auckland New Zealand and work as
a market manager for a company making TV and Theatre lighting. I look
after the Asian market and spend a fair amount of my time in the Asian
region. I have only been living in Auckland for a year and originally
hail from South Africa with several stops in between, the joys of
working in the entertainment industry. I am 31 years old and have
smoked a pipe since I was 17.  I favour Dunhill Royal Yacht or Dunhill
Black Aromatic at the moment. The choice of Tobak seems to be limited
in NZ, as yet I haven't managed to find any real tobak shops in NZ,
some barber shops and news agents carry limited selections of pipes
and tobaks. Maybye I have been looking in the wrong places any advise
will be greatly appreciated. ( If there are any Kiwi members I would
love to meet you!)

On my  trips to Asia I top up my supplies in Hong Kong. I know there are some
Asian members of the digest so a quick question for them; apart from Davidoff
are there any other shops in the region I should be visiting? As I say I smoke
mainly pipes but  I am about to head to the Philipines and seem to remeber they
have a cigar industry; are there any suggestions on Cigars from this region?

Well I guess that will do for now....
Thanks for the digest and companionship it brings to a lonely smoker at the
bottom of the world.

Cheers
Graham E.

Subject: Antiquarian Tobacciana

I was on the telephone last week with Julia Turner of "With Pipe and
Book," ordering a copy of Carl Ehwa's book.  I asked Julia to send me a
list of their tobacco-related books and was told that they no longer
publish such a list.  In the true spirit of friendship and cooperation 
that pervades this business, however, she told me to contact Ben
Rapaport. 
   
I knew that Ben was an author ("A Complete Guide to Collecting Antique
Pipes," "The Global Guide to Tobacco Literature," etc.), but I did not

know that he is the owner of "Antiquarian Tobacciana":  
   
Antiquarian Tobacciana
11505 Turnbridge Lane
Reston, VA  22094-1220
(703) 435-8113  [also his home phone--please don't call after 10 PM]
   
This business sells domestic and foreign tobacco literature, from books
(both first-editions and reprints), to periodicals (everything from single
copies of "Pipe Smoker Magazine" for $2.50 to a complete original set of 
"Pipe Lovers" [1946-1950] for $1000), to catalogs (original and 
reproductions).  Ben also sells lithographs, tobacco-related
collectibles, and antique pipes and accessories.  His prices are very
reasonable.
   
Ben puts out a quarterly for his patrons entitled "The Nicotian 
Network Nexus and News" that is part newsletter, part product 
listing--send Ben a dollar for a sample copy. [Actually, he'll send you
a copy for nothing if you call him, but do the right thing--the buck 
barely covers postage and repro costs, I'm sure.]

Subject: Rookie Post

Thank you Steve, I appreciate your hard work in preparing the digest.

I have  received the last couple of digests and have found it be a fantastic
source of information as well as "just plain fun" reading.  Since this is my
"rookie contribution", maybe I should introduce myself.  I'm Troy Causey, a
23 yr old programmer/analyst in the fast and frantic Atlanta Georgia where a
good bowlful is simply "NEEDED".  My only notable achievement is that I work
down the hall from your 1000th member, Mr. Jonathon Davis (the crowd
cheers).  In fact, he told me about the digest.  As my age might suggest, I
am only a couple of years into my pipe smoking "career", but have found
immense pleasure in both the smoke and the fellowship it brings.  As far as
my tastes are concerned, "the worst tobacco I ever smoked was pretty good".
I smoked aromatics like "Wilshire" from Tinder Box, but have begun, thanks
to your digest and its contributors, to try some English blends and find
them quite different, but very very nice.  My small but growing collection
includes a couple of Peterson's, a few Stanwells, Ascorti, Brebbia, GBD, and
a pipe from Claudio Cavicchi near Bologna, Italy.  I have enjoyed and hope
to continue enjoying the digest.  I look forward to the discussion.  Without
further adieu, let the saga continue.  Thanks again.

Troy

Subject:       Pipe types

I would like to know what is a good type of pipe to purchase that 
will be inexpensive yet a good quality.
I had an inexpensive Dr. Grabow (sp?) which broke while I was 
cleaning it. Made me sad :(
Anyway, any info you can give would be helpful.
THANKS-
Joshua

Subject: pipes digest

hi steve, first of all thanks for doing the digest, it's great.
i'm writing because i haven't received this weeks digest. if you haven't 
done it yet, no problem, but if you have i would appreciate it if you would 
send it to  me.
well, i geuss i'll take this oppurtunity to introduce myself. i am a 
sophomore philosophy student at northern arizona university in flagstaff. 
i have been smoking pipes for under a year, so i find the articles on 
different blends very helpful. i tend towards the latakia blends, 
although i have not tried very many of them.(the local shop doesn't have 
a very good selection, but i take what i can get)
the shop in flagstaff is:

McGaugh's Newstand 
24 N. San Froncisco St.
flagstaff, AZ 86001

From: Tim Ramsay &lt;??????@???????.????.???????.??&gt;
Subject: intro message

Thanks VERY much for your extremely prompt reply to my request for 
membership.  Especially appreciate all the introductory info on 
periodicals, clubs, vendors, etc., since I've been following your 
discussion group itself for several months, now.  Here's a brief 
introduction of myself, as requested:
        My name is Tim Ramsay and I'm a graduate student in computational 
commutative algebra (ie. I don't care much about computers per se, just 
what you can DO with them!) at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.  
I've been an avid pipe smoker and amateur cigar fan for about two years, 
ever since (THANK GOD) kicking the cigarette habit.  Nicotine's now a 
fine and dependable friend, rather than an "evil influence" in my life.  
Being a poor student, I find it much more affordable to experiment with 
fine pipe tobacco than fine cigars, hence the preference...
        I started out, as do probably most pipe smokers, with aromatics, 
but soon discovered the clear superiority of the natural English/Scottish 
blends.  Due to the presence in my town of an _excellent_ tobacconist and 
pipe maker, I was lucky enough to avoid the usual introductory route of 
Amphora, Balkan Riff, etc. (Yuck, Yuck, Yuck!).  My current preference is 
a full-bodied, Latakia based, 
Knock-you-over-then-kick-you-when-you're-down tobak experience such as 
Dunhill's Nightcap mixture or Rattray's Black Mallory (do you get 
Rattray's in the States?  I haven't seen any mention of it...), but also 
enjoy a mild-to-medium sweet English in the morning or early afternoon.  
I've got a baker's dozen of pipes, some new, some old, including three 
bent Petersons, a Stanwell, a beautiful little hand-made French job, a 
lovely free-hand made of bubinga wood by my local tobacconist Mike Fagan 
(I can't imagine a better smoking pipe this side of tobacco 
paradise), and an Austrian calabash, the last two being my favorites.
        Mike's got his own line of cigars which he has hand-rolled for 
him from several Havana leafs in Canada by an ex-patriate Cuban cigar 
roller and I consider them, for the money, to be just about the best 
`gars I've ever had.  After some experimentation with Dominicans, 
Hondurans, and the much more expensive imported Cubans, I stick with 
Mike's custom-mades when I want a good smoke.  I've got a girl-friend 
from Italy (Perugia, near Tuscany) who's introduced me to Italian 
Garibaldis and Toscanis, which I must confess I've come to love.  
Unfortunately, I've only managed to find the inferior American imitations 
of these last cigars in Canada but, through my girl-friend, I manage to 
maintain a fairly steady supply from Italy.
        I can't believe that Mike's shop, the Pipe &amp; Pouch, is not listed 
in your resource list, _especially_ in view of the tremendous volume of 
discussion I've witnessed on the availability/quality of genuine Cubans.  
I travel quite regularly to both Toronto and Montreal, have sampled the 
best tobacconists in both cities, and have noticed that Mike's prices on 
Cubans (and other cigars) are consistently from 15% to 25% lower than in 
both T.O. and Mtl.  For example, I was in Montreal yesterday and found 
the _lowest_ price on Cohiba Robustos to be $24(Can.) per.  Mike sells 'em 
for $20 and change (I can't remember exactly, but closer to $20 than 
$21).  This translates, for those math-phobes out there, to a savings of 
at least $100 a box!  Davidoff cigarilloes go for $2.53 per, _at least_, 
in Mtl., and Mike sells 'em for $1.57.  The price differences on his 
other `gars are comparable.   He also makes his own nice and relatively 
inexpensive line of pipes and has around 30 different blends of custom 
tobak, of which I've sampled about half (I'm working on the other half) 
and found to be uniformly excellent.
        This must sound like a sales pitch, so let me assure you that I 
am neither a relative, personal friend, nor (in any way) a business 
partner of Mike Fagan.  I think it's a crime that you folks can't get 
Cubans down there and consider it a public service to help anyone 
enterprising enough to come up to Canada for them to get the best deal 
possible.  His address is Pipe &amp; Pouch, 155 Wellington St., Kingston, 
Ont., Canada, K7L 3E1  (613)549-4477.  Well, this has turned out to be a 
hell of a long submission, so feel free to edit where you will...

                        Smoke just as much as ever, but smoke the best!
        
                        Tim Ramsay   ??????@???????.????.???????.??

Subject: How to fight the Prohibition in Massachussetts

Hi, all,

Someone (Mark?) asked me, in private email, if I had any ideas on how
to fight the Massachussetts law prohibiting nicotine in tobacco. This
particular piece of nonsense is the closest thing to Prohibition we've
yet seen. It's already passed the state House, and is headed for the
Senate and the Governor.

There's only one real answer. ORGANIZE.  Someone up there is going to
have to lead.  If you think you can do it, the time for you is now.
If not, please find out who is leading, and offer your support.

But, from a couple of states away, I do have some specific suggestions
on tactics:

* Call and write your elected representatives.  Tell them your
position. Vote your position.

* Work through the existing organizations. (Sherlock Holmes Pipe Club
is one; are there any cigar clubs in Massachussetts?)  Convince the
membership to work with you.

* Enlist the aid of Cigar Aficionado.  They're the biggest player on
our side right now. Write a letter, urging members to write the
Mass. Senate and Governor in protest.  (But make it easy on the editor;
look up the addresses and send them along.)

* Organize at the grass roots. Set up a petition drive in the cigar
stores and collect signatures.  Remember, each of these folks will be
put out of business by the Stoddart act.

* Convenience stores would be good allies.  They're in business to
make money, not to enforce artificial morality.  Remind them of all
the business they'd lose to neighboring states if the act passes.

* The State House is opening another front in the drug war, with 1/3
of the state's population and 49 other states opposing.  Remind the
voters that someone, namely them, is going to have to pay for the
enforcement of yet another unenforceable law.

* Then, smoke in peace.  Even if you have to drive to New Hampshire or
Rhode Island to buy your terbacky. :-)

				Long live the Resistance!
				~\U Steve (????????@???.???????.???).

Subject: Query: Pipe shops in Europe, esp. Berlin

Dear Steve:
Here's an inquiry:  Does anyone out there have an address or addresses of
pipe shops and tobacconists in Berlin (yes, Germany) as well as in Italy?
Our Directory seems to have relatively few European entries, aside from
London and a few in Copenhagen.
Thanks,
John

Subject: Mail order tobac in WA???

Does anyone have an address for any reputable mail order tobacco
outfits in Washington state?? There is really nothing here in
Vancouver, and I have had some tobacs from south of the 49th, and have
no complaints. I have gone over the resource list, but saw
nothing. The reason for choosing WA is its proximity to BC, hence
(hopefully) cheaper shipping, etc. Also, a pound of tobac locally
ranges around 90$ up!!! With the prices that I have seen for T in the
states, even allowing for exchange, duty, GST, shipping, the price
from US is still cheaper!

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Mike

" I'm getting SO desperate, even new-mown grass is looking good!!

[ Nothing in the Guide, Mike! Can any of our Washington State members
help out?  -S. ]

Steve

Thanks for the subscription to "The Pipe Digest". I am the owner of
Finck Cigar Company, manufacturers of cigars since 1893 (started by my
great grandfather). We aquired the "Wally Frank" mail order Cigar,
Pipe, and Tobacco business in January of 1993. We have a large
selection of nationally known brands as well as many private labels.
All of our pipe tobacco is manufactured by Peter Stokkebye of
Denmark. We also carry an assortment of Peterson, Jobey, Butz Choquin,
Comoy's, GBD, and many other pipes.

If any of your subscribers are interested in a catalog or have any
questions regarding cigars, pipes, tobacco, snuff, cigarette tobacco,
chewing tobacco, accessories ... I would love to hear from them.

My email is ?????@???????.???

Subject: Re: #1(4) Pipes Digest #187 -...

Steve,

I really want to express my thanks for the work you do putting the Digest
out. The lates issue (#187) was especially interesting.  I really enjoyed the
story of Ashton Pipe.

I have about 120 pipes and have been a pipe smoker for more than 25 years=2E
Besides the actual smoking of my pipes I really enjoy reading about the
history of some of the pipe makers and the tobacco companies.  I also enjoy
shopping antique stores and looking for tobacco related items such as old
pipe racks or humidors.

Again, thanks for you efforts.

Regards
Don Churn

Subject: Edwards Tobacco?

Hello,

Living in Fort Collins, Colorado has many benefits.  Mountains
and rivers, good beer, lots of sun, etc.  One of the things missing
though is a selection of tobacco shops.  We have one.  That shop 
is Edwards Darts and Tobaccos.  Dutch (the fella who owns runs the 
place) swears up and down that NO tobacco burns better and that NO
bowl smokes nicer than those produced by Edwards.  Being new to this
game I can't say whether he is blowing smoke up my ___ or not.  What
is the consensus on Edwards products?  If people have opinions please
mail me directly at "????@????.?????????.???".  

Smokin',
eric

From: "Mark D. Lamoree" &lt;???????@?????.??.???.???&gt;
Subject: Kevin, Kids, and Hysteria

	Kudos to Micheal from Britan(sorry-I don't recall the last name) 
for a lucid critique of the American Zietguist.  Political Correctness 
and its corrolaries(anti-tobacco hysteria being one of them) is nothing 
more than a re-birth of puritanism.  Our public discourse and our 
society's attitudes are permeated by the constant fear that, as Menken 
put it, "Someone, somewhere is having a good time."
	Although the suuporters of the new puritanism ascribe nothing but 
the purest of motives to themselves, the true aim is nothing new or 
noble.  Puritanism, in whatever ilk, is aimed at nothing more than 
control of others.  Michel Foucault noted that our society is one 
charactarized by a complex and subtle web of power that attempts to make 
us all subjects.  While this is certainly true, what is even more 
disturbing is the willingness of people to accept the controls inposed by 
power.  We are like slaves who call for more and heavier chains.
	As far as the youth element of the issue:the sharing of a pipe is 
*not* equilelent to corruption of youth.  Nor is there any basis to 
assume any sort of purient intent in our fellow tobaccophile's actions.  
It is truly unofrtunate that there is a legitimate concern about whether 
his acitons will be construed in this way.
	To veer from political and philosophical matters, I must say that 
I experimented with tobacco from the time I was about twelve years 
old.(Almost nine years ago)  I did not become a drug addict, a pervert or 
a libertine.  The only ill effect I suffered was a ciggarette habit that 
I am just now breaking. Perhaps if I had experimented with pipes rather 
than sucking ceaslessly on the floor sweepings marketed as tobacco by the 
cigarette companies, I would have avoided this as weel.  BTW, one of my 
fist "cigarettes" consisted of some of my father's Amphora rolled up in a 
piece of notbook paper.  
	Enough preaching...I suspect my time on the soapbax is up.:)

Subject: Could you PLEASE?

I wrote in the last pipe digest for everyone to give me an email if they
wanted to be on the mailing list.  I forgot to mention that the mailing
list is a paper mailing list - would it be at all possible to mail this out
to everyone?  Pulvers' Prior Briar at this time only has a paper mailing
list at the moment - therefore they need to send an address that they can
be reached at.

If you can't, no problem - I'm just getting swamped with requests to be on
the list, and I have to write an apology to most people.

Thanks,

Steve,

   Great job on the digest keep up the good work.  I have followed
most of the articals and was wondering how many of your followers
smoke the Ascorti line of pipes?  This has long been a favorite of
mine. Sometimes I even choose this pipe over the numerous Ashton's and
Dunhill's that fill my racks.

   Thanks Steve,

Subject: Re: #1(4) Pipes Digest #187 -...

I'm looking to purchase a new humidor for between 12-25 cigars and would like
one of the highest quality. I have heard Davidoff and Dunhill do a fine job,
but I wonder if there is a retailer that sells them at a discount. Ordering
them from the main stores in New York means paying full retail.

I would also love to know of a pipe store that carries the finer brands at a
discount. I would love to increase the collection, but hate to pay the full
price if the same is availible elsewhere for less. Any hints would be greatly
appreciated. Also, is there any other great humidor brands? If so, where does
one go to purchase them? Possibly CA magazine has done an article on this=2E 

Meanwhile I'll just sit back and smoke a bowl of Dunhill 965 and enjoy
myself. I love reading PD and appreciate being apart of this fine mailing
list.

Subject:       Early Mourning Pipe

Hi,

After having read so much about English Blends I decided to try them. 
I must say I did try them before once but that was only a sample 
package by W0 Larsen, I liked them, but I wasn't overwelmed.
So I thought let's buy me a tin of Early Morning Pipe. And let me 
tell you, It was an experience. Be it in a negative way. I filled my 
pipe. Lit it and tasted a bar of soap... Put it away, relit it and 
than it tasted quite well. And what a nice pipe it was. The pipe I 
smoked had a relatively small bowl but it lasted for 1 1/2 hour. 
After that one and a halve hour I started feeling sick. Not just sick 
but very _sick_.
I couldn't touch a pipe in days without getting that sick feeling 
again. After a week, smoking was a pleasure again. But not Early 
Moring Pipe, the tint stayed closed for weeks. Then I tried it again, 
and within a few puffs: The same effect.

What could this be? And moreover is this typical for English Blends. 
If so I'll skip them in the future. Dit I make a wrong choise with 
Early Morning Pipe? HELP!

something that doesn't agree with you? -S. ]

Subject: Re: #2(4) Pipes Digest #187 -...

Dear Steve -

Thanks El Mucho for your help in getting the Bliley report out there.  Our
notes must've crossed in the mail, because I sent up my last posting before I
got your note re. getting my floppy, etc.  BTW - I'm glad to hear about the
number of requests you've gotten for the report.  I've put it in the pipe &amp;
cigar library we have here in AmericaOnAndOn - so far about 15 downloads.
 About your reservations concerning a.s - I know that your reservations stem
from flamage (yes, I know about that group).  Howsomever there are 2 things
that might be accomplished.  1 - there might be some people on there who
would actually want to read it, and 2 - for the folks of the other persuation
it would be a "shot accross the bow" so to speak, letting 'em know we're not
afraid to face 'em down.  As far as myself, if I get flamed so be it.  I have
friends know know some ways to neutralize it.  If, however, it would also lay
you open to getting flamed, then by all means follow your instinct - I
certainly wouldn't want to bring that kind of thing down on you.  Whatever
you decide to do is fine with me.

About that Massachusetts thing - WHAT IDIOCY!  I predict the idea will
ultimately get defeated (or perhaps repealed if it passes).  The Mass. State
legislature must be controlled by democrats.  Only "liberals" could come up
with an idea like that.  Perhaps part of liberalism's last gasp?  Oh,
politics...

And one last thing - you didn't answer the question in my last posting re=2E
where I can go to download back issues of the PD.  If there's an FTP site
where I can do this please let me know the site and directory.  Thank you,
Sir!

Lebewohl die Partisaner!

Steve J. (Briar Man)

[ Steve, my concern was not so much about getting flamed (that's
happened _quite_ frequently) as it was about diluting the
effectiveness of the report by making it available to the antismokers
for unopposed rebuttal.  I wanted to mainly disseminate it through the
"friendly" channels.  But I'll follow your wishes and post the
announcement to a.s., if that's what you would like.  (And, BTW, if by
"neutralization" you mean unauthorized cancellation of opposing
viewpoints, I'm opposed to that.)

The FTP and Web sites are listed at the bottom of this mailing, as
always. I'm trying to think of some way I could let folks know that
the Bliley Report is out there, too.

And thank you for your major, major efforts! Long Live the Resistance! -S=2E ]

Subject: PD Readers going to the Big Smok

Dear Steve:

I must begin this note by saying just how much I enjoy reading PD each week.
 You are to be rewarded for the work that you do.  BTW, is there an easy way
for you to segregate the cigar from the pipe stories?

I am planning to attend the Big Smoke in New York on Thursday, May 25.  I was
wondering if anyone else was going?  Perhaps PD readers could get together
either before or after and enjoy a smoke of our own?

Also, if anyone has gone to a Big Smoke before, please help with any info
that I need to know before going.  

Thanks,

Stuart M. Altschuler

[ The question about cigar vs. pipe postings has come up before; it's
hard to do, because some postings concern both pipes and cigars. R the
Big Smoke: just wear a suit and be careful about getting it
burned. And have a designated driver or take mass transit; the alcohol
flows _quite_ liberally. :-) Have fun! -S. ]

Subject: ******Antique Pipe Available****

(forwarded to other members for a possible quicker response.  if you all know
of someone else, send it along.  :)~  )

Greetings one and all,

Well, as some of you can tell, this is pretty important.  A local antique
dealer stopped by the store with a very unique piece that he had no idea what
to do with.  He bought it as part of a jammed humidor at an estate sale and
didn't see it till he got home.  I am the first "dealer" to have seen this
piece, and unfortunately didn't have the disposable income to put down on
this piece at this time, So naturally I thought of you all first and am
providing this opportunity.

It comes with the original case, which has thankfully born the brunt of the
last several decades and also helps to account for the very good condidtion
of the pipe.  It is smokeable, and contained some ash and unsmoked tobak
remnants when I turned it over.  This pipe may have been "smoked" four times.
 There is some damage created by banging the bowl on a hard surface to clear
it of the contents (which judging from the dings was unsmoked tobak.)  

The bowl itself is about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 inches deep and about 3/4 to and inch
accross the top.  Not much caking at all.  The bowl tips outward (helping to
date the pipe...circa 1890 ish I think...)  The Bowl itself is made of wood,
the grain hidden by the finish of the pipe and the metal ring around the top
of the bowl (explanation later).  The coloration starts as a coffee brown at
the bottom and lightens progressively to a honey brown just under the ring.
 There are two grooves running horizontal to the top of the pipe just below
the start of the metal.  the whole wooden portion is highly polished with few
noticable flaws.  There are no identifying marks on this pipe otherwise.  

The metal ring on the bowl (which completely covers the top half and top
edge) is gold colored (he says gold, I say brass....but I am no metallurgist
and he is a chemist by trade...so who knows).  It makes for a very nice
looking pipe.  The metal on the top is dented slightly from the emptying of
the bowl on a hard surface (as mentioned before).  ON the gold there are
silver (real) indian heads in full head dress, leading into flowing corn
stalks with two ears of corn.  There is one of these on either side of the
bowl.  Excellent craftsmanship.  The shank (?) is square/diamond shaped and
is ringed by the gold/brass and one Indian head which goes 3/4 of the way
around the piece.  

The Stem has very little marking from use on it.  It is a resin of some sort,
clear amber in color wit virtually no discoloration from use.  It screws into
the shank via a hand fashioned system using a mallable material that also
acts as a sort of washer...I think it is bakelite or something
similar....could be mistaken.  The stem is the same square/diamond shape as
the shank.

It is a very attractive pipe and has aged very well.  The asking price is
$300, however I would be willing to hear a rough (since you all can't
actually see the pipe) estimate as to the pipes real value.  

If you are interested in buying this piece (Hard to do sight unseen I know)
give me a call at the store during business hours  9 AM to 5 PM Eastern time
 ....The Sundries Shop, (207)-942-1746.  Would like to hear from you.

Roger Hawkins

Subject: Change of address

Dear Steve,

My e-mail address has changed.  My old address was ??????@???.???.  I'm sorry
if this is a nuisance to you.

Thanks for your quick response to my subscription request.  I downloaded all
back issues and subjected my laser printer to a lot of overtime, printing out
the same.  The issues are now firmly ensconced in three-ring binders.

I have relished the reading of the early issues.  It reminds me of the time
that I purchased Book I of the Pipe Smokers' Ephemeris.  I pored over the
pages of that book, all the while savoring my pipes.  My wife thinks I'm
nuts, but so are pistachios.  :-)

With your consent, I plan to keep in regular touch with your mailgroup about
our common interests, namely, pipes and tobacco.  We have few guarantees in
life and there is so much to savor and experience.  I'm not trying to sound
maudlin, but we are dead a long time! :-)

Last year, at this time, my wife and I were living in the French Alps.  While
on a trip to Switzerland I bought a pouch of Avalon Mixture.  It became a
favorite of mine as well as having a favorable WAF (Wife Acceptance Factor).
 When we returned to the US, I was dismayed to discover that it is not sold
here.  I checked with a number of nationally known tobacconists and they were
unable to duplicate Avalon Mixture.  Davidoff of New York suggested that I
contact their Geneva store (which is a shrine, BTW).  I faxed my order.  Six
days later I received the five (50 gram) pouches I ordered along with a
receipt equivalent to $54.00.  The shipping/handling was more than the cost
of the tobacco.  My taste buds had better not change until I have consumed
every ounce or I'll really be kicking myself.

Enough jabbering for now,

James Lawson,  Bangor, Maine

[ Wow! That's some of the most expensive pipe tobacco I've ever heard
of! -S. ]

Subject: Cubans in the States

I'm still amazed, with the cold war supposedly over, that you 
folks can't import Cubans.  I was talking to a tobacconist here 
(who, of course, will have to remain nameless) and he claims to 
send a lot of Cubans down your way.  His strategy is to take 
them out of the box, remove the bands, pack the cigars in 
another container (ie. without "Cuba" written on it), and send 
them by mail.  He also sends the bands in a separate envelope.  
He's only willing to do this by the box (sorry, no singles and 
these babies aren't cheap up here in the North!) but apparently 
does so often.  Of course, if the cigars were stopped at the 
border (although it's hard to imagine why they would be) it 
would be the customer's problem, but this nameless tobacconist 
says that this has, as yet, never occurred.  I'm surprised that 
I've never seen this on the digest.  If this is something that 
the enlightened cigar smoker already knows but deems unsafe to 
discuss in public, I sincerely hope that you will NOT print 
this note.  I'm certainly not trying to wreck a good thing, 
here, just wondering if it's generally known...

[ As long as the tobacconist remains unknown, I see no reason not to
print the note. To this end, I've taken the liberty of jiggering your
address a little so that he or she can't be traced by proximity to
you.  This means that other members are on their own about opening up
similar channels. Thanks!  -S. ]

Subject: Newbie  Uncloaks

Dear Steve:

Thanks for welcoming me into the PD group. As the above indicates, I'm a 
recent arrival in the 'net world. This digest seems like such a comfortable 
place after bumbling around through www and newsgroups.

I've been an intermittent pipe smoker for about 44 years. Recently, after 
having quit cigarettes for about 13 years, I have begun to really enjoy pipe 
smoking. I think this is due to the lapse of the inhaling reflex. I have also 
made a few pipes from briar plateaux which I have enjoyed both for the 
smoking pleasure and compliments received. Made a couple for my son and 
son-in-law.

I have accumulated over 30 pipes of many kinds over the years, ranging from 
drugstore jobs to Stanwells. I'm pretty comfortable with tobaccos I have 
ordered from Carey's over the years. I avoid their "fruit salad" type 
aromatics. I aquired some 965 after reading about it here - excellent!

I mentioned above that I have made a few freehands. I was intrigued by a 
comment by one of the gang that he had a pipe made of bubinga wood. I have 
been curious about other woods suitable for pipe making (other than cherry 
and maple). I have seen several references to wood toxicity in woodworking
magazines, particularly with reference to exotic hardwoods. I asked Tim 
West(the source of the plateau for my favorite freehand) about alternate 
woods, and he couldn't think of any. BTW I'm glad to see him on the resource 
list. I would appreciate if anyone could recommend exotic hardwood(s) with 
qualities similar to mediterranean briar. 

Regarding pipe-friendly places on th SF peninsula: I had visited Old 
Knickerbockers in Menlo Park, but hadn't realized that the affiliated British 
Bankers Club had a pipe smokers' area until I read it here and asked them 
about it. My favorite smoking retreat here in Silicon Valley is an old 
Stanford hang-out called the Alpine Inn in Palo Alto. It is a roadhouse/beer 
garden est. in the 1800's. Many people call it "ZOTTS", a nickname for the 
former owners. I really enjoy having lunch outside and enjoying a pipe close 
by a gurgling creek. Does anyone in this area have a favorite pipe/cigar 
smoking retreat?

Thanks for having me aboard, Steve.

            Bob Weiske &lt;???????@??.??????.???&gt;   

[ ZOTTS (is it all upper case?) sounds interesting! A speakeasy for
cigar lovers in deepest California! Thanks! -S. ]

Subject: Introduction

Steve,

How are you? Well, I hope. When I subscribed you requested that I
send a brief introduction, and now, after a considerable delay, I
present it to you. I am a 19 year old history student at Virginia
Commenwealth University, working his way toward law school. I have
been smoking cigars for about a year and have been experimenting with
pipes off and on now for about six months. I have found the Digest to
be very well run and very informative, and so I look forward to
recieving it. I live in the Richmond, Va. area and would love to talk
with anyone about cigars and pipes, in person or by email, contained
in the header. For those in the Richmond area, or passing through, I
would like to recommend The Tobacco House, Ltd. at 3138 West Cary
Street. They have a fair selection, I have not been to many tobacco
stores so this is pure opinion, of pipes, both new and used, tobacco,
and cigars. They are a friendly bunch who are always willing to talk.
I have rambled on enough and so I bid you a wonderful evening.

Yours,

Tim Hogge

Subject: Subscription Please!

Greetings!

Please sign me up for a subscription to Pipe Digest!

Wife &amp; I just started smoking Pipes this past January and discovered
the digest in the Compuserve Bachus Wine Forum Smokeshop just last
month.  The pub is a real treasury, since there are very few books in
print dealing with the topic.

Prior to January we were both non-smokers, and started the hobby for
health reasons.  (Hope the Tobacco Polizei don't see this heresy!)
Nicotine relieves many of her migraines w/o the use of hard drugs.
Even her doctor agrees it's worth continuing as long as it helps.  I
find that it soothes my ADD-churned brain and helps me lose weight to
boot!  Most important, our hyperactive Belgian Sheepdog mellows
considerably when the air is full of aromatic tobacco smoke, often
choosing to lay peacefully in another room while we puff (and not a
minute longer, I might add).  We haven't had to slip downers into his
water for weeks.  What's a remote chance of cancer compared to those
benefits?

Best Wishes,

Neil &amp; Karen Garra 

[ Neil, for some reason, I'm always quite pleased to get mail from
couples who smoke pipes.  Welcome!  And has anyone else had any
beneficial effects on migraines? -S. ]

Subject: Misc pipe stuff

Hello Steve and PD Readers!

I've got three things to pass on in this letter:  1)  some great replies to
the questions I had, related to being a new pipe smoker, 2) a very exotic
pipe for sale, for serious collectors only, and 3) An update on replies on my
upcoming cross country venture:

First, I got some real good advice from Ed Berggren that I thought was just
too good to keep to myself.  Other new pipe smokers might find this valuable:

------Start of stuff from Ed-------
1)  Relative to tamping:  Yes, tamping definitely helps a pipe stay lit
longer.  As it is smoked, the tobacco tends to loosen up a bit.  Tamping
helps keep it packed together so that one lit strand can light an adjacent
one.  In fact, one of the big problems in my pipe smoking life is holding
onto the pipe with one hand while tamping with the other while driving down
the highway at 65mph.  If, in your travels, you figure out how to solve
this one, please let me know.

2)  Relative to moisture:  Most of the moisture that collects in the bottom
of your pipe is the result of the tobacco burning (heat creates
condensation).  Aromatic tobaccos, in general, tend to smoke "wetter" than
the English-Scottish blends, but there are exceptions to everything.  Also,
some of the moisture is spittle running down the stem.  Pipe cleaners are
the simplest solution.  When your pipe starts to gurgle, run a cleaner down
the stem and (carefully) into the bowl.  It will absorb the moisture and,
with a little tamping, you're on your way.  Of course, the cleaner comes
out dirty and smelly, so you may not want to wave it about in polite
company.  Peterson makes its famous "system" pipes which have an extra
chamber beneath the bowl to collect the moisture.  I've never had a
Peterson, so I can't speak from experience, but a lot of folks swear by
them.  I do believe they're a bit pricey.  Richard Hacker in his book, "The
Ultimate Pipe Book" writes about something called Nording Pipe Stones which
are small clay pellets.  You drop 3 or 4 of these into your pipe before
loading and they absorb the moisture.  I haven't been able to find any of
these in the shops I frequent, so again I can't tell you if they work.
----End of stuff from Ed-------

By the way, I did check my local pipe shop, and they hadn't even heard of the
pipe stones, although they did have some disposable crystals of some type
that you're supposed to put in the bottom of the pipe and dispose of with the
dottle.  It didn't seem too good an idea to me, but the pipe stones still
sound very intriguing to me.  Also, Ed, my friend Vern said that he's SEEN
the pipe caps, that you mentioned in the last PD, at our local pipe shop, but
I haven't seen them myself.  I'll check next time I'm in there and get back
to you if they have them.

And speaking of the pipe shop, the second item is kind of an interesting
one-- while talking with the shopkeep, a nice young lady who has apparently
been running the place for years, talked to me a little about the subject of
pipe collecting, and she wanted me to let everyone know that they have a pipe
for sale, so here it is.  Hold onto your hats:

Pipe For Sale:
Very high end, carved Meerschuam-- never smoked.  It's a large pipe that
should stay on a table (handling should be avoided).  The pipe is a carving
of Anthony kneeling by a nude Cleopatra.  The intricate carving, from a solid
piece of Meerschaum, is adorned with many other detailed features.  It was
carved in 1979 by Ismail Ozel (there is an umlaut over the "O"), in Turkey.
 The whole pipe is about the size of a small football (probably not the
standard unit of measure for pipes, but I'm new to this, so forgive me).
 This pipe is an incredible looking piece, but due to the price, I'm sure is
only for the serious collector.  It is reported to be one of the largest
Meerschaums in the U.S., and the asking price is $15,000.  If you want to
know more about it, let me know and I will get details.

Regarding my trip across the U.S., I got some GREAT responses from people,
including offers to just call and say "hi", and offers to visit and have a
smoke, which is really going to be neat, I think!  I've got a couple places
in Colorado to stay, a couple in Arizona and an offer for a night in central
Virginia.  As for the rest of the trip, I'm tentatively planning to sleep in
my Mazda pickup, under the safety of a canopy most of the time, but may hit a
motel from time to time to freshen up.  Regarding the canopy, I've got a
"beater" identified for $70 which I'll probably buy, and then if I can find a
better one in the meantime I'll get it instead.  I'd like to have something a
little nicer than the one I've found, but the one I've found recently will do
until then.  Then I need to get someone lined up as a housesitter to watch
the place and mow my lawn, etc. while I'm gone, and then I'm on the road!

One the most important items in preparation for the trip is now taken care
of-- I have a laptop computer with AOL software installed and a modem, such
that I can should be able to make contact with the PD crew and keep ya'll
posted on what's transpired, and which great pipe related discoveries I might
have made along the way.  A couple of people told me about some neat shops in
some out of the way places that are a "must visit", so I'll try to hit those,
including "Bob", who suggested a couple of places in Louisiana, in Baton
Rouge and New Orleans.  It's shaping up into an interesting trip already, and
I haven't even gotten on the road!

If anyone has anything else that I should add to my list, or again, either has
 a place, or can suggest a place where I could park my truck to sleep and/or
take a shower (like a community pool that's open in the morning or whatever),
I'll put it into the my database that I've got compiled for the trip.  Any
advice on good pipe spots to visit, interesting people to talk to, places to
eat, or sights to see are appreciated.  I don't know when, or IF I'll have a
chance to take another trip like this, so I'd like to see as much as I can.

Thanks to all the great people who've written already, especially those
who've offered a place to stay and/or the chance to sit down and have a smoke
and talk for a few hours.  I'm looking forward to it!

--Charlie Jewell

Subject: Universal Studio Tours

Sorry to take so long to get back to you steve.  You asked me if Universal
 Studio Tours was a major tourest attraction?  It is considered one of Los
Angles' main attractions .  Families from all over the world travel to this
entertainment theme park each year, so it does to tend to get very crouded.
 My family has spent the entire day there many times but we always try to get
there early.

   There is a tram tour that my kids loved cause you can see them making
movies, they take you on the back lot where you see the streets and sets
 used to make movies.  You can see a real soud stage and have an encounter
with King Kong and the Shark from Jaws.  You can see the back to the Future
and Backdraft attractions.  My two year old loved the E.T. special effects
ride across the universe with E.T.  I could go on and on belive me Steve it
is BIG  BIG  BIG Thank you Don ???????@???.???

[ Gee, Don, I'm confused (but that's nothing new. :-) I thought _you_
were asking _me_! Thanks for the info! -S. ]

Subject: Re: Your Pipes Digest subscription request

Steve: Thanks for adding me to the list. As for personal  background I 
have smoked cigars since college (mid-60's). I have been on Guam for the 
past ten years coming out here as news director of one of the commercial 
television stations. Before that, I was in mostly small to medium markets 
on the Mainland for about 15-years. For the past six years I have been 
Director of Public Affiars for the University of Guam. Not only is Guam a 
tropical paradise with great diving-- we are also within 4-1/2 hours of 
just about every Far Eastern Capitol...and only 3-1/2 hours from Hong 
Kong, i.e, Cuban cigars! Living out here has allowed me to collect some 
rather unusual, and interesting, cigars. I have two boxes of really good 
cigars that I picked up in Burma some time back plus any number of 
"exotics" from Indonesia and the Philippines. Anyway, there are some 
cigar lovers out here and we are trying to form a club. When we organize 
I'll send the information to you so that any weary traveler passing 
through here (7-1/2 to 8-hours just from Hawaii) will have a place to 
relax with other cigar smokers. Being 8,000 miles from the Mainland it's 
great to have a list like this so that we don't feel completely isolated 
from our hobby. Yours truly, John D. Morvant, University of Guam 

[ Welcome, John! I've occasionally been curious about Burma cigars;
perhaps you could share your findings? -S. ]

Subject: Pipe digest submission

Hi, thanks for letting me in to the group and here's to a
prosperous future!

I've been pipe smoking for about four years now, with the
occasional cigar and sometimes a good Nat Sherman or a
handrolled cigarette of Native American Blend Tobbacco.
Since I'm probably A little inexpierienced in the
'International' pipe scene I will gladly listen to the
wisdom of my smoking elders.

My pipe collection consists of about seven or so quality
Pipes with one small cased Meerschaum wich I am working on
breaking in.  By far I prefer the apple shapes with a
diamond cross section so I can set it down, But freehand
andSlightly bent shapes are nice to.  I'd have to say right 
now about the best pipe I like smoking is My Falcon from Dr 
Grabow (yes I know I can hear the sniffs of disdain but for 
the money it is a good pipe).

As for blends I prefer the aromatics, having tried a few of 
the more traditional blends. I especially liked Cesear
Borgia from Amphorae.  It's sadly out of stock now and
I hear they do not make it any more.

As for things I would like to see any articles on Pipes and 
tobbacco which would be of intrest in historical nature as
well as of practical.  It's nice to know how to smoke or
choose the right smoke, but it's also good to not repeat the 
mistakes of the past.

Well, until later, enjoy a pipeful.

Jeff

Subject: water pipe description

Steve, 
I thought this might be of some interest to PD readers.

I have a Lebanese water pipe inherited from my grandparents.  It is called an
'arkilley' or 'arkilleh' or 'arghilleh'  depending on the accent of the person
pronouncing the name.  God alone knows what the real spelling would be.  It
was brought to this country by my Lebanese great-great-grandmother when she
immigrated to Rhode Island in the 1880's.  I don't know how old it is in fact
but it is obviously over a century.  I have seen a photo of her smoking it
around 1920.  It is unused since the 1930's when she died.  (Health nazis
please note:  she died of VERY old age.)

The base is dark green, cut glass with what I assume to be hand painted
flowers on it.  It is about 18 inches high.  The metal parts are white brass. 
Two tubes of different lenght go into the base (one into the liquid, the other
just above it.)  The tubes go up to a cap that seals the base.  The submerged
tube connects to the bowl that holds the charcoal and tobacco; the other
connects to a spot on the side of the cap where the mouthpiece hose is
inserted.  The bowl, which holds the tobacco, has a pottery (ceramic?) bowl
that fits on top of it leaving a little air space.  I believe this topmost
bowl holds the charcoal used to ignite the tobacco.  (Please keep in mind that
I am working from old memories of my grandparents' descriptions and they never
actually used the thing.)  The metal section is all one piece.  The hose is
ribbed and flexible like a narrow vacuum cleaner hose.  The mouthpiece appears
to be ivory.

When used, the base would be filled with water to just below the shorter metal
tube.  A dollop of arak, which is an anise-flavored Lebanese liquor, was
added.  (I remember a bottle of arak my grandfather had, it was 110 proof! 
Whew!  Lebanese moonshine!)  From his description, it sounds like the tobacco
was a plug of Virginia leaf.  He said it was somewhat sticky and broad, so I
assume it was plug tobacco.  This would be cut up very coarsely and placed in
the bowl.  The charcoal was ignited and placed in the bowl above it where it
would start the tobacco smoldering.  By drawing on the mouthpiece, a slight
vaccum was formed which drew the smoke down into the liquid.  The smoke would
rise to the air space and be available to the smoker.  By passing through the
liquid, a lot of the tar and other nastiness would be filtered out and the
smoke would take on some of the flavor of the arak.  The result was apparently
pretty mild.  The base had to be emptied and thoroughly cleaned after each
use.  You can imagine what that liquid was like after a good long smoking
session.

I have no reason to think this water pipe is especially valuable or rare.  I
am told that many of my G-G-grandmother's contemporaries (all women) also
smoked similar pieces.  Oddly enough, my grandparents did not remember men
using the water pipes.  They smoked either pipes or, more often, cigars. 
Certainly none of that group of immigrants would have been able to afford
anything rare or expensive.  I received it because I am the only descendent
who	=E7Dokes
some good flake Virginia and (cheap) bourbon in the water.

Hope this bit of family history wasn't too boring.  It might be interesting to
hear from others who have smoking pieces passed down through the generations. 
Happy Puffing.  The Bear.

(DAHdidit dit DAHditDAHdit diDAH): Some good news on the political
front: We heard this week that Santa Barbara, CA has repealed their
ban on smoking in restaurants.  Reason: restaurant owners complained
that it was driving business to neighboring towns that let the
restaurant owners decide for themselves.  Unconfirmed, but a point for
our side if true! See later in this issue.

Administrativa: From time to time, readers have asked me to separate
the cigar and pipe articles.  For various reasons, this would be
somewhat difficult for Yr. Moderator to undertake. 

However, I do have an idea which might help those members who, like
Art Gorski below, have newsreaders that can search for keywords.  I'd
like to suggest that submitters put the word [PIPE] or [CIGAR] in
their Subject: line.  As in:

	Subject: [PIPE] Plumber Needed; Basement Flooded!
or
	Subject: [CIGAR] What This Country Needs is a Good 5-cent Cohiba!

Not a rigid rule, just a suggestion. And now, on this beautiful late
spring evening, please join us in lighting up and enjoying the finer
things...

In PD #188, Stuart M. Altschuler said:

&gt;I must begin this note by saying just how much I enjoy reading PD each week.
&gt;You are to be rewarded for the work that you do.  BTW, is there an easy way
&gt;for you to segregate the cigar from the pipe stories?

Here's a tip that may work for Stuart and others when reading the Digest.
I use Eudora on a Mac, which lets you search the current message for
occurences of a word or phrase.  So I just search for each occurence of
'cigar' and zip through the Digest to the parts of interest to me!  Not
that I don't respect the pipe smokers in the audience! ;-)

<TITLE>Pipes Digest Article: 189.002</TITLE>
</head>
<body>
<pre>
From: David Fred &lt;???@???.???.???&gt;
Subject: delurk and general comments  (Re: PD #187)

I subscribed to Pipes Digest sometime last fall and have been reading
with interest and appreciation ever since, though until now I have not
posted.

By way of an introduction, I started smoking cigars about 1.5 years
ago and pipes just this last winter.  I had tried smoking a pipe 2-3
years ago with disappointing results, though now looking back on my
consternation it is somewhat humorous. At 27 I am on the younger end
of the traditional cigar/pipe smoking spectrum.  I often feel that
some (not all!) dismiss new smokers' enjoyment of the pastime by
implying that they are simply trying to be trendy or appear
sophisticated.  While this can definitely be true in some cases, it
seems like this sort of attitude can result in the loss of an
opportunity to form bonds and friendships between people with a common
interest.  As has been observed over and over again here and
elsewhere, pipe and cigar smokers *tend* to be interesting and
thought-provoking people; the newer and/or younger ones aren't
necessarily an exception to the rule.

My motivation to post was my desire to commend Michael Bywater
&lt;??@???????.?????.??.??&gt; for his erudite and entirely appropriate
commentary on the state of things here in the US in PD #187.  The idea
that one can attain liberty by the passage of more law is completely
dumbfounding.  And as Michael said, it's not only the laws.  It seems
as if the willingness to openly condemn others as bad or evil, on both
sides of what's left of the political spectrum, has gotten totally out
of hand.  Open discourse has its place, but so do tolerance and
civility.  The current state of affairs is a sad commentary on what a
nominally free society can produce.

Incidentally, I also took up cigar and pipe smoking because of the
associations it had to my maternal grandfather.  Though he did not
directly introduce me to the practice (that was my cousin's doing) I
have a difficult time not thinking of him when I smell cigar or pipe
smoke in the air.  I find it nice that my mother enjoys my cigar
smoking because of the positive associations it has for her.  (Though
my father has a rather different opinion.)

My grandfather will celebrate his 80th birthday on the 2nd of June
this year.  I am planning to buy him a very nice box of cigars, which
seems a fitting and nicely circular gift.

In closing, here's a quote I ran across recently:

"He's an old friend," I said, "I nearly sent him some pipe-tobacco
once."  -Ernest Hemingway, A Farewell to Arms

[ Thanks, David! And I hope your grandfather enjoys his present.
Please wish him a happy birthday from us. -S. ]

Steve,
&gt;Subject: Mail order tobac in WA???
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have an address for any reputable mail order tobacco
&gt;outfits in Washington state?? There is really nothing here in

The best Cigar shop in Washington state (not IMHO, it just is :) is the 
Tinder Box in Bellevue
10150 Main St
Bellevue WA 98004
206.451.8544

Gene is a great guy and I usually drop $20 or so every couple of days 
there, BUT, the sin tax on cigars in WA is 74.8%  It is MUCH cheaper to 
order from like Smokin Joes or Holts (both of which you can check 
prices at the Fuji Cigar Page).

Steve,

Not sure if you saw it or not, but about two weeks ago we added a 
mailto from our Fuji Page to your wonderful digest.  Out URL is 
<a href="http://www.netins.net/showcase/fujicig.">http://www.netins.net/showcase/fujicig.</a>

BTW -  Any smokers (pipes are welcome too :) in the Seattle area are 
invited to the Seattle Smokers at FX McRory's on May 18th at 7:00pm.  
The last went for six hours and between the ten of us (9 guys and one 
breathtaking lady) we probably smoked a grand  :)  What a great night.

Slainte
Bobby

Subject: Cigar sizes

At the risk of getting my hands slapped by our moderator, I'm going to 
mention a commercial supplier.  [Yes, Steve, I agree with your position; 
but it seems the last half dozen digests have been cluttered with this 
issue.]  About six months ago I joined the International Cigar Club.  
Each month they ship 4-6 cigars that are all in the same size group.  
They charge about $11 per shipment with a free shipment if you refer a 
new member.  [I'd be happy to split this windfall if any truly wants to 
join.  Other than that, there is no personal affiliation with this 
company.]  The included newsletter briefly describes where the tobacco 
was grown, the size of the cigar, and the length. One month was double 
coronas.  They were long and fat.  Churchills are also fat, but not as 
long.  Rothchilds are shorter yet.  This leads me to the question I 
wanted to ask here.  Can anyone point me to a reference on cigar sizes?  
Basically I'm looking for a listing of ring gauges and lengths versus the 
names commonly used for that cigar size.  Thanks for the info.

Two ideas for your (and my) smoking while driving problem...

First, try steering with your left knee.  Unless you have
really bad alignment (or no left leg) this should work for 
you.  I've never wrecked cause of it =)

Second, get and extra-long tamper and mount it on the ceiling
of your car in front of you.  As all you'll need to do is lift
your chin- and voila!  

The first method may be more effective, but the picture of the 
second is a lot funnier.

[ Third, mount a tamper shaped like an inverted U on the left side of
your steering wheel. Then you can tamp and make left turns at the same
time! -S. ]

Subject: Tamping &amp; Driving

&gt; In fact, one of the big problems in my pipe smoking life is
&gt; holding onto the pipe with one hand while tamping with the other
&gt; while driving down the highway at 65mph.  If, in your travels,
&gt; you figure out how to solve this one, please let me know.

There are two methods I can tell you for this, though neither is
really recommended. (If either of these techniques causes you to
crash and break both legs, don't come running to me!)

The first is a little trick I learned from my father called
"driving with your knees". Using this technique necessitates
three things 1) cruise control, 2) a straight road, and 3) good
wheel alignment. Simply set your cruise control to the speed you
want to keep going and bend your legs until your knees touch the
bottom of the steering wheel. This will keep the wheel immobile
for long enough to get a good tamp. You can even make minor
corrections to direction by shifting your legs around.

The second trick also needs a fairly straight road, but not
cruise control. The wheel aligment still needs to be pretty good,
though not as good as method one. I call it "driving with your
wrists". Lean forward until you can rest your lower wrists on the
wheel at the noon position. You should have enough friction from
your wrists to make directional changes to stay in lane, and
since you're working right in front of yourself, your eyes are
still mostly on the road. However, this method does involve
removing the pipe from between your lips.

Personally, I've noticed that if I'm going fast enough, and the
road is straight enough, and my alignment is good enough, I can
take my hands off the wheel for up to thirty seconds before I
start to drift out of my lane. I wouldn't tell anybody else to do
this, though.

when the occasion arises... but YMMV. -S. ]

Subject: Poll Request: Pipes and Tobaccos

Hi Steve,

I received the following poll from Dayton Matlick and offered to put this 
in the Pipe Digest.  If you feel this questionnaire is not appropriate 
for the Pipe Digest, I understand, and will convey that to Dayton.
Here's his poll [any typo's are sadly my own]:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
SpecComm International, Inc. is primarily a tobacco publishing house.  We 
have four publications that serve the tobacco industry from seed to final 
sale, one for more than 125 years.  The only void is direct service to 
consumers of tobacco products.

We have been asked by the industry to create a quarterly magazine for 
pipe smokers.  We tentatively call this PIPES AND TOBACCOS.  However, 
before we go forward with this publication, we need to know whether there 
is a "need" or desire for such a publication.  With this in mind, we ask 
that you fill out this questionnaire and turn it in before you leave. [I'm 
quoting here, please understand,  mark rice.]

RATING SYSTEM: Below is a list of article ideas.  Please rank each 
article on a scale of zero to 100, with zero being an article in which 
you have absolutely no interest and 100 being an article that you would 
seek out and definitely read in its entirety.

1. The countries and circumstances under which tobaccos are gorwn for use 
in pipes.  RATING:____

2. A specific look at each of the major types of tobacco used in pipe 
tobacco blends with background on the country, how the tobacco is raised, 
curing, processing and necessary handling. (A series of articles.)
RATING:____

3. Briar:  Where the best briar comes from, how it is found and dug.
RATING:____

4. Selecting briar for excellence.  RATING:____

5. A company by company look at top pipe producers would-wide. (A series 
of articles.)  RATING____

6. Meerschaum source--where it comes from and how it must be handled.  
RATING:____

7. A look at famous pipes down through history.  RATING:____

8. Profiles of famous living personalities who smoke pipes.  RATING:____

9. Profiles of famous personalities from the past who smoked pipes.  
RATING:____

10. Wines that blend well with various pipe tobacco blends.  RATING:____

11. Liqueurs that blend well with various pipe tobacco blends.  RATING:____

12. Anti-smoking restrictive efforts and how they affect us all.  RATING:____

13. New laws and regulations around the country restrict our smoking 
pleasures.  RATING:____

14. Information about what you as an individual can do to resist 
anti-smoking efforts.  RATING:____

15. Restaurants and other establishments that are pipe friendly.  RATING:____

16. Travel and lodging opportunities that are pipe friendly.  RATING:____

17. Pipes and tobaccos in foreign lands. RATING:____

18. Pipe fundamentals.  (How-to series) RATING:____

If a magazine exitsted that covered the features you rated highly above, 
would you subscribe?  Yes___    No____.  Would you prefer to buy 
individual copies at your tobacconist's shop?  Yes___   No___.

Would you be willing to pay $15 a year for four quarterly issues?

Describe your occupation:

Please give a general indication of your annual income to help us judge 
the potential for advertising interest.

How often do you smoke your pipe?

Do you also smoke cigars?  Yes___    No___.  If yes, how often?

Do you also chew tobacco products or use snuff?  Yes___   No___.  If yes, 
how often?

How much did you pay for your last pipe?

Thank you very much for your cooperation.  Your responses will be 
critical in helping us evaluate the potential for a PIPES AND TOBACCOS 
magazine.
-----

Mr. Matlick stated that the proposed magazine is going to be a high 
quality publication (not a newsletter, but a color publication with slick 
sheets, etc.).  Due to the fact that SpecComm doesn't have an e-mail 
address (something they need to remedy... soon) Matlick offered a 
snail-mail address:  SpecComm,  Mr. Dayton Matlick,  3000 Highwoods 
Blvd.,  Suite 300,  Raleigh, N.C.  27604

Due to the fact that these surveys contain personal information (salary, 
etc.) I was going to offer to be a funnel point for completed forms and 
mail the print-outs.  (This would yield a higher response percentage from 
those receiving the survey.)  I'm not going to fill in the salary info, just 
because I'm a private individual.  If anyone wants to bypass the drudgery 
of mailing it, I'm open to having their form sent to me, and I'll just 
package them up on a diskette and ship them off.  

I have no business or even personal relationship with SpecCom, Mr.  
Matlick, or anyone associated with this proposed magazine effort.  I 
just feel that a targeted audience like this needs to provide input on 
something that I see so much discussion about here... tobaccos, blends, 
what to drink with a bowlful, tobacco growing, curing and processing.  

I'll ask Mr. Matlick if he would share an overview of the received 
questionnaires once they process the replies.

 .... enjoying my latest purchase, a Peterson...

[ While I'm a little ambivalent about including surveys, this one
seems to be in a good cause. Thanks, Mark! -S. ]

Attention all cybersmokers:

As many of you know, the National Convention for Pipe Smokers is being
held in St. Louis over Memorial Day Weekend (May 27 and 28).  It is 
sponsored by Pipe Collectors International, and admission is a dirt-
cheap $2.  

I would like to invite everyone to a hospitality room at the Stouffer
Concourse Hotel (the site of the convention).  This invitation is
extended particularly to all readers of alt.smokers.pipes and 
Pipes Digest. We will have an ice-breaker on pre-opening night 
(Friday, May 26).  The smoking light will also be on before and 
after the banquet (May 27).  We'll also have a wind-down party 
after the smoking contest (on May 28).  So, if you are planning 
to attend the convention, you might want to plan to stop by to 
meet in reality some of the folks you know from the net. We'll
enjoy liquid refreshments, sample tobaccos (several blends from
Cornell and Diehl will be available for your sampling), show off
new acquisitions, swap pipes, tell pipe stories, and create a
smoke-filled room. 

If you have any suggestions for refreshments, or if you would like
more details, please e-mail me at 
???????@????????.??? 
Hope to see you all there!!!

[ Please let us know how it goes! -S. ]

Subject:  Criteria for a Pipe Shop...

In the 32 years I have smoked a pipe, I have developed a simple criteria for
chosing a really good shop.  First, it must be really cluttered and possibly
even dirty.  Most of the clutter must be tobacco stuff, hopefully pipes of
rare and distinguished vintage.  Second,  the owner and the workers must
smoke a pipe, hopefully with all natural blends.  Third,  they must have a
repair capability.  Fourth, they should not rush you into buying.  Simple
criteria but it works for me.  Bob 

[ Great criteria! But I'm not sure I've ever run into such a place,
with the possible exception of Leavitt &amp; Pierce... -S. ]

Subject: Re: Giant Meerschaum For Sale

In Pipe Digest #188, ????????@???.??? wrote about a "football-sized" Anthony 
and Cleopatra, carved by Ismail Ozel and selling for $15,000, that is 
reported to be one of the largest Meerschaums in the U.S.

This is fascinating.  I have a unicorn by "Artist Ismail", with the head 
about 5".  Same guy?  It's a nice piece of work.  What is the upper end on 
the size of Meerschaums in the US?  There's a very nice Baccus on display at 
the Tobacco Wharf in Beavercreek with the bowl roughly the size of a 
pineapple and a meerschaum stem about 2' in length.

I also picked up my first calabash yesterday and I must say this is the best 
pipe I've ever smoked.  It's a large pipe (size #5 I believe) from CAO, with 
an uncovered bowl and a smooth solid block meerschaum insert.  The smoke is 
unbelievably cool and dry.  Unfortunately CAO has discontinued this 
particular style, but pipes with carved inserts (lattice and floral designs 
were mentioned) and chamois-covered bowls are still available.

Subject: Concerning the "hookah" or water pipe 

Steve:
    I saw a message concerning a person who had inherited a Lebanese 
water pipe and I must say that I have become enamored of acquiring one 
for myself. I would like to get one that is around 18 inches high or 
larger. Unfortunately, nobody in Champaign, IL seems to carry such 
things. Would you ar anyone out there in PD land know of a shop that 
stocks such items and would ship it to me here? Thanks for any info.

Subject: Pipe Friendly launched.. finally

   Steve,

   Many thanks for your assistance in promoting Pipe Friendly.  Through your
efforts we were able to add several hundred names to our mailing list.
 
   As of 5/9/95 the last of the 'bulk mail' mules will have departed S. CA
for mailboxes throughout these United States.  With luck, you all will get
your copies sometime before the 1996 elections :&gt;)

   To those who didn't get on the list and wish further information, please
e-mail me at ??????????@???.???.

  Again thanx and keep up the good work with PD.

[ Glad to be of help, but you've got potential competition... see
above! And Ted Gage may be looking at re-starting The Compleat Smoker;
he posted something to that effect on alt.smokers.pipes. Hey, maybe
you guys should combine efforts! -S. ]

Subject: Pipes Digest

Thanks for the great work you are doing. On my last trip to Toronto I went
again to Winston and Holmes (and picked out a lovely sand-blasted Stanwell
bent). I bought a superbly illustrated book, originally French, but
translated into English. This is "The Illustrated History of the Pipe" by
Alexis Liebart and Alain Maya.(Harold Starke Publishers Ltd, ISBN 1 872457
20 7)
I had wanted to get Hacker's book, but they had run out; this is a splendid
substitute, and is full of glorious photographs of luscious pipes.  I would
recommend it to anyone as a gift to himself or a favourite pipesmoker.
Cheers
Chris

Subject: Re: Your Pipes Digest subscription request

Thanks for enrolling me.

I'm afraid I'm not that much of a pipe smoker anymore.  In fact, I have a
running battle with my doctor about whether my one pipeful a month is a bad
habit.  He says it is but can't give me a reason.  I'm 64 but in good health. 
I haven't smoked a cigarette in almost 30 years.  Before I quit cigarettes I
smoked my pipes several times a day.  Then I quit entirely for a few years and
when I permitted myself to start up again I found that I wasn't the smoker I
had been.

But I still like my pipes and cigars and under certain circumstances can't
imagine not having them nearby.  I can't go fishing without one, for instance.

For years I just smoked Edwards pipes--cheap but utilitarian.  Now I buy a pipe
here and there, usually on the basis of how well it's carved.  I've had some
good pipes but lost them; the army is hard on any kind of ownership and
graduate school not much better.

I smoke a different tobacco every time out.  In fact, I usually buy both pipes
and tobacco when I'm on the road, so I end up with some occasional surprises. 
I like burley cavendish combinations, I'm not too concerned about the cut, and
I don't mind some aromatic additive once in a while.

That's about it.

Charlie

Subject: McClelland Flake article

Steve: 
 
Thought you might enjoy using this article on tobacco.  
 
************** 
 
A PIPE SMOKER'S GUIDE 
 
HOW TO SMOKE FLAKE TOBACCOS 
 
English and Scottish-style Matured Virginia flake tobaccos are  
among the most interesting and rewarding for the smoker to taste; 
yet, they are avoided by many smokers who simply do not know how to 
approach them. This article is intended to help the pipe smoker 
learn how to fully appreciate the zesty character and subtle 
sweetness of these premium, aged products. (It should also help 
smokers of the flavored American sliced plug and European flake 
cavendish tobaccos.) 
 
One reason flake tobaccos are left in slices after cake-maturing is 
that they retain their freshness better than in ribbon form. Flakes 
also enable the smoker to have some control over the burning rate 
and, to a small degree, the flavor. 
 
It is important to prepare the tobacco before packing so that it has 
an even texture and to fill the bowl evenly, no matter what degree 
of brokenness is preferred. (The more fully-rubbed -- meaning gently 
separated -- a tobacco, the faster it will burn. Similarly, it is 
true that the thinner the cut, the faster it will burn.) 
 
The more moist tobaccos should be packed more loosely than normal so 
they won't pack down densely enough to prevent a good draft. The 
ideal is to have the tobacco draw firmly, with a little resistance, 
throughout the smoke. The smoker may be able barely to hear a little 
hissing through the pipe as it is smoked. Too firm and the tobacco 
won't burn at all or one small spot will burn hot and maybe wet as 
the smoker puffs hard to keep it going; too loose and the tobacco 
will burn inconsistently and unevenly, perhaps causing the bowl to 
overheat in spots and moisture to condense. 
 
Five Steps to Success 
 
1. Put in the palm of one hand the amount of tobacco that it is 
believed will fill the bowl. Then pinch at the slices or rub them 
between the palms until the tobacco separates to the degree 
preferred, keeping the texture even, avoiding clumps. The denser the 
tobacco is left, the slower it will burn. (This becomes especially 
valuable on windy days outdoors.) 
 
2. Gently but firmly and evenly work the tobacco into the bowl of 
the pipe until it is filled slightly over the top and feels firm but 
still springy under enough finger pressure to flatten the surface of 
the tobacco even with the top of the pipe. (we assume the pipe is 
clean at the outset, free of obstruction to a good draft, well 
rested . ) 
 
3. Now, while drawing through the stem, light the pipe evenly across 
the entire surface of the tobacco. After a few puffs to develop an 
ash, and while continuing to draw, tamp the tobacco down evenly all 
around the bowl with a tamper. The goal is to have the tobacco 
packed so that it will burn as evenly and firmly as a good cigar. 
 
4. Relight the pipe after tamping to get the entire surface of the 
tobacco burning again. Even burning is very important. Otherwise, 
hot spots may develop. 
 
5. With only occasional tamping as the tobacco burns down, since it 
tends to expand and loosen as it burns, the pipe should now smoke 
evenly to the bottom. The aim is to maintain a firm, even draft 
throughout the smoke. The process is not difficult to master and 
with practice will soon be effortless. 
 
A Note on Flavor Expectations 
 
For those who are used to the "aromatic" or sweetened tobaccos that 
dominate our market in the United States, it may take some time for 
the additives remaining in the pipe to dissipate. Many smokers 
prefer to maintain one set of pipes exclusively for the natural, 
matured tobaccos and another for the sweetened varieties. It may be 
necessary to smoke Up to four ounces of a natural product before the 
mouth adjusts to the clean taste and subtler range of flavors 
typical of these Matured Virginia tobaccos. The smoker is rewarded 
for the effort as he becomes able to distinguish the delicate 
variations in taste and deepening richness these tobaccos develop as 
they are smoked.

Subject: Not Inhaling

Steve,

London's "Financial Times" newspaper  had an interesting reference to our own
President Bill Clinton.  This can be found on page "X,"  of the May 6/7, 1995
edition.  Christopher Hitchins, in a book review about marijuana, included
the following sentence:
"Meanwhile my other Oxford contemporary William Jefferson Clinton (who never
needed to inhale, by the way, because he baked his marijuana into cakes and
cookies) told his own surgeon general that her proposals on decriminalisation
(sic) would not even be discussed."

Ever since Mr. Clinton fibbed to us about smoking dope but not inhaling, I
was puzzled.  Perhaps Mr. Hutchins above statement clarifies some things. ;)

Subject: New Popularity of Good Cigars

Steve,
        In yesterday's Rocky Mountain News (5/8/95) there was an interesting
article about the resurgence in popularity of good cigars and cigar dinners
("Get Along Little Stogies" - cute, huh? - by Bill St. John, the News dining
and wine critic). Even though I'm not at present into cigars (purely due to
deficient pecuniary resources (read: "I can't afford 'em") I found the
article of interest and thought others on this list who can afford them and
do smoke them might also.  If I can quote some of it:
        ..."What's in are imported, hand-rolled, premium cigars.  "My fine
cigar sales were up 62% in 1994 over 1993," says Jon Cacherat, owner of
Prince Philip's Pipes &amp; Tobacco in Tamarac Square.  "And up 42% in 1993 over
1992."
        ..."To growing legions of cigar aficionados, cigars taste better
than ever. Enter the cigar dinner: Dozens of tux-clad penguins - and,
increasingly, penguinettes - gather in a snazzy restaurant to put away
martinis, single malt scotches, a few courses of top-drawer cooking and
superlative wines - all the while puffing away at several types of cigars.
        ..."Last month, the Ritz-Carlton, Aspen - along with 31 other Ritzes
from Spain to Australia - participated in Cigar Aficionado/Ritz-Carlton's
International Cigar Celebration Dinner: eight different primo cigars; five
courses of five-star food; four super wines; 65 puffers. Sold out, weeks in
advance.
        "Look, I live in Boulder," says lawyer Fred Marienthal, who attended
the Aspen dinner.  "The only place I can smoke a cigar in Boulder is when
I'm walking my dogs."
        "Marienthal's is the voice of a new generation of cigar smokers.
They're back and they're smokin'.
        ..."In Denver, no one has hosted more cigar dinners than Jerry
Goodman, owner of Jerri's Tobacco Shop downtown (see Resource Guide). "In
four years, we've done about 18 dinners," Goodman says.  "Now, we have them
monthly, for about 50 people each time, and I'm getting calls from all sorts
of restaurants that want to do cigar dinners."
        ..."More and more, cigar smokers are younger people in their 20s and
30s," says Jimmy Yeager, general manager of Aspen's Caribou Club, a famous,
cigar friendly hangout in smoke-wary Aspen.  "And it's not a men's club
anymore, either.  We have quite a few women who enjoy a good smoke."

Subject: Greetings

Hi Steve,

This is just a note to say thanks again for the great job you're doing
with the Pipes Digest and to offer a potential swap to our cyberspace
colleagues. I recently received a new Peterson pipe as a gift from a
friend who knows I'm a pipe smoker, but isn't familiar with my
personal likes/dislikes in the style and shape of pipes. He is
perceptive enough to the potential for such foibles to exist however,
because in the card that he sent with the pipe he said "if you don't
like the shape, swap it for one you like". Well..... I'm not too
partial to the shape - its' the Hudson, the second pipe in the new
Peterson Sherlock Holmes 7-day commemorative set. The pipe is a smooth
finished squat bulldog with a wide sterling silver band on the diamond
shaped shank. The band bears the profile of Holmes along with the
normal silver hallmarks as required by Irish law. The briar is
beautiful - tight swirly grain. I really wish I liked the shape
because its' a darn nice pipe, but I'm partial to full bents or
Canadians.  I talked to Bob Hamlin about it and he recommended I
mention it here. Bob says the MSRP for the pipe is $190. I'd be
willing to swap for another Peterson in a similar range or perhaps
some other good make. I'd even be up for swapping for a presmoked pipe
or pipes to come somewhere close to a fair trade value wise. Maybe Rex
or Nikos or one of the more active collectors would be interested, or
perhaps someone just looking for a very nice pipe for him/herself. The
pipe is new and unsmoked and comes in the Peterson gift box with all
the paperwork and even includes a chamois pipe bag. How about it
fellow pipe smokers - anyone interested???  Steve - if this is too
long winded, please feel free to snip at will&lt;ggg&gt;.  Regards to all,
Bob

Subject: intro for PD

As per the local custom, I'd like to introduce myself here....

I'm one of those people who went from nonsmoker to pipe smoker.  Various
friends in high school and college smoked pipes, andthough I was always
vaguely intrigued, I was somehow reluctant to give it a try; perhaps because
of the usual cultural baggage about "that's for grownups" meaning "people
older than whatever age I happened to be at the moment."  About five years
ago, I was hanging out with a friend who was contentedly puffing away, and
when I commented on the pleasant aroma, he offered me a puff, and as they
say, the rest is history.  Pipe tobak was one of those things, like
chocolate, which was an instant *Yes!* from the first taste.  

Shortly thereafter I picked up a decent mid-priced briar and started
exploring where my tastes would lead me.  For a while I smoked Captain
Black, but I was curious about expanding the horizon and finding out what
else was out there.  Eventually I stopped by Sherlock's Haven in San
Francisco (which used to be located next to where the computer hackers'
social gatherings were held) and picked up a few samples of different
blends.  

At this point I smoke various aromatics &amp; Cavendishes, in particular the
ever-popular Lane 1-Q and something I get in NYC from Barclay-Rex called
Alkazar (anyone here know what's in it?); lately have added a couple more to
the regular menu.  Still haven't been able to develop the taste for English
blends, though I'm always open to suggestions (and will follow up on those
which folks here have sent via email).  Admittedly my tastes run toward the
sweet and away from the sharp or bitter.

My preferences in pipes tend toward unstained/unvarnished briar, notably
Peterson Seconds and the pipes of the Connoisseur Shop in NYC (every time
I'm out East I stop in there &amp; buy one or two).  I also have a taste for
estate pipes, and have even found some good ones (by recognised makers) at
local flea markets; a bit of reconditioning work and they're usually
perfectly good.  Lately I've had a tendency to move from medium-sized to
larger bowls, which afford a greater opportunity for the flavor of the tobak
to develop and last.  By now I have between 25 and 30 pipes altogether, and
buy when the mood strikes me or I see something interesting which might not
be around for long.

Smoking a pipe is for me one of those rare things in life which brings
sensual and intellectual enjoyment together.  The aroma and taste of the
tobak, the warmth of a good briar in hand, the contemplative sense of
relaxed thoughtfulness... Some of my best ideas have come in those moments.
Like eating good chocolate (or for that matter taking a relaxed shower or
bike ride), smoking a pipe is an excellent way to let the mind clear and get
in the mood for creative projects and brainstorming sessions.  It's all the
better when shared, though fellow chocolate lovers seem far more numerous
than fellow pipe smokers.  The few times I've worked on a project (business
planning, etc.) with someone who shares both the taste for chocolate and for
pipe tobak, have been incredible: a meeting of minds in a spirit of shared
enjoyment and shared purpose, which sets the tone, and objectively gets more
done, better, faster, and with pleasure. (I guess another part of that is,
working with someone with whom I have a lot in common, or a few key things
in common anyway, is an incredible motivator.)  Finally, in an age of
transience and obsolescence, the pipe is a symbol of permanence; one of
those rare artifacts which a person may easily keep for a lifetime.  

I'm 34, which I guess puts me on the younger end of the spectrum here
(anyone else in their 20s and 30s care to write...?).  I live in Berkeley
CA, which despite whatever controversial publicity it may get from time to
time, is a place where free debate flourishes, new ideas are always welcome,
and the local officials can at least be trusted to be honest.  

I work in telecom consulting, network design, and implementation, in a small
firm which I founded and is now incorporated as employee-owned (which BTW is
a great motivator for my coworkers).  Fortunately, I'm free to enjoy my
pipes during the work day, with minor limits for obvious reasons of mutual
respect (i.e. not in closed vehicles etc.).  I'm also involved in various
projects in sustainable economics and enterprise development.  

After hearing vague rumors, one night I did a keyword search and found the
newsgroup and PD.  It's been wonderful reading; I've learned a few things,
and finally feel like there's a group of people to share discussions of one
of life's great pleasures.

Another news item, unrelated but good news in any case: Santa Barbara CA
repealed its tough anti-smoking ordinance today, on the basis that it was
driving business to neighboring cities.  Bar owners, restaurant owners, and
others were supporting the repeal.  "One down, hundreds more to go..."

Now in all fairness, this doesn't mean stop visiting your favorite eating
place until any local ordinance is repealed.  If the owners are supportive,
they deserve our patronage and mutual support in repealing prohibitionist
ordinances.  Work together, get results.

Subject: Pipe maker: Andre

A while back, someone posted to the digest asking
the whereabouts of a San Francisco Bay area
pipe maker named Andre.

Purely by chance, I ran into someone who knows him.
I was smoking my pipe outside at work, and a contract
illustrator in our group struck up a conversation
with me about pipes. One thing led to another and I found
out she knew "Andre."

It turns out that the "Andre" business is now run by Andre's
son, Jimmy Mermet. Jimmy inherited the business from his
father.

Jimmy can be reached at (408) 353-1370.

Subject: Price of Cubans in Canada

I may or may not be up in Vancouver, BC in the near future,
but I thought I'd plan ahead and investigate tobacconists
in that city.

I checked the Resource Guide and found mention of
Clarkes R.J., Tobacconist in Vancouver (at 3 Alexander St.).
I telephoned them and asked about prices of various Cuban
cigars. To my shock, they wanted over $20 CN for a Montecristo #2.
(I think it was $22 CN.) They are selling Romeo Y Julieta
coronas for about $15 CN.

I asked if there was a recent price increase, and the person
I spoke with said "no, those have been the prices for
about two years now." I can't believe it. When I was in
Edmonton, Alberta about 15 months ago I picked up four
Montecristo #2s for about $12 CN each. I remember thinking
*that* was expensive. (They were definitely Cuban, too, not
knock-offs. "Habana" on the band, very distinctive taste.
Wonderful cigars.)

Can anyone shed some light on this? Is Clarkes in Vancouver
simply out of line on price, or have the prices on Cuban
cigars gone up over 80% in 15 months, or was the shop in
Edmonton giving me a total bargain?

Thanks,

Kam Kashani

[ Wow! Looks like I may not be buying any Cubans when I go to Nova
Scotia this fall... well, not many :-) -S. ]

Subject: Pipes Digest #187 - April 26, 1995

Greetings Steve. Excellent job as usual on the last PD. Thought members
might be interested in the following:
 
The past two weeks I've been on a combination business/pleasure trip which
took me from CT to Key Largo FL. Along the way, had some experiences which
might interest fellow Digesters. Stopped in JR's in Selma, NC and purchased
a few each of the new JR Alternative brand cigars touted to be
"counterfeits" of the best Cuban brands. Bought them all as close a match as
to size as I could (Churchills) and after careful reflection, I won't do it
again. The "robust hearty" flavor was totally missing. Mild to the point of
boring. This was an across-the-board impression and the type of cigar being
imitated did not seem to make a difference. Also bought a tin of McBaren's
burley blend which smells a lot tastier in the tin than it tastes when
smoked.
 
In Sarasota, stopped at Bennington Tobacconist, Inc., 5 Fillmore Dr./St.
Armands Key, Sarasota, FL 34236-1425 (800) 237-5074. In a charming village
with more Rolls' than Rodeo Dr., this is a pleasant surprise. Pipes and
tobacco are _affordable_ and worth the trip. Shop had a surprising number of
Churchwardens on display, as well as their own made-in-France line of
acrylic mouthpiece briars which run about $35. A large selection of
Petersons and Jobeys as well as a goodly number of Wilkes were on display.
The real surprise was in the tobacco which they claim they hand blend. Fell
in love with their No. 05 English Luxury, a blend of burley, Virginia ribbon
and Latakia (just a touch). Tastes great, smokes cool and smells nice to be
around. Some of their aromatics would be a surprise to most--Coffee, Swiss
Chocolate and Strawberry Daiquiri are some flavors/blends available. Large
selection of cigars in every price range too. Picked up a nice little Jobey
for a knock-around pipe; price was too good to pass up and the pipe
looks/smokes well.
 
In Key Largo, looked in at the Caribbean Cigar Store, approx. mile marker
108 on US 1. Can't miss the place--large skull and crossbones painted on the
window over the legend "Cigarettes Kill". Wide selection of Dominican and
Jamaican cigars. Most pleasant surprise: Stopped for lunch at the Quay
restaurant, Mile Marker 102 Key Largo. After a fresh mahi-mahi filet
sandwich and Red Label Jamaican beer, pulled out a Hoya "Presidente", a
large cigar. One of the waiters came running up to me _to offer a light for
it_. OK, I _was_ dining on the pier but this was such a pleasant surprise
after having someone in my hometown bitch about my cigar _in the smoking
section of a cocktail lounge_ (yep, that's where they were sitting too;
wonder what they thought the ashtrays were for).
 
Keep up the good work.
 dsj

[ That's _more_ than cigar-friendly! Thanks! -S. ]

Subject: (fwd) Re: Tobacco Seeds

Hey Steve!

The Tobacco Museum in North Carolina sells small packets of tobacco 
seeds.  (I guess any packet of tobacco seeds would, by definition, be 
small).  Don't have their address or know if they would sell by mail but 
will research it if you like.  The museum is very interesting, located in 
the midst of the N.C. tobacco fields.  J.R.'s big outlet was just a few 
miles down the road, but I guess it's moved since I was there.

Subject:       Migraine &amp; Smoking

Okay this will be tricky, my medical English is quite poor but I'll 
give it a try: Neil A Garra wrote about benificial effects of smoking 
on migraines. My wife suffers from migraines and smoking to her has 
oposite effects. 
As far as my knowledge reaches migraine is a swelling of the veins in 
the brain as a reaction to an initial contraction. And as far (again) 
as my knowledge go's, smoking _can_ have a vein contracting 
propperty. So, when the veins _are_ wide (i.e. you suffer form a 
migraine attac), smoking may have a positive effect on the migraine. 
But smoking _can_ also have the oposite effect (or in fact a 
combination)  widening the veins even further, like drinking alcohol. 

So IMHO there is no rule like smoking helps against migraines. If it 
works for you, great, but chances are probably equaly in favour of 
getting more sick than you where, you'll have to decide if it's worth 
the try... 

If all this is medically incorrect please don't flame me, I'm only a 
technician &lt;G&gt;

Subject: Pipe Digest

High time to send in an introductory post.  I'm a 49 year old mediator
in Central Florida who's been smoking a pipe for a long, long time.
Most of my pipes were inherited from my father, who was God's gift 
to Alfred Dunhill.  My tobacco consumption has covered all parts of
the spectrum, but I've been quite happy for a number of years with
the house blends at The Brass Pipe on U.S. 1 in Fort Pierce, Florida.
By domestic treaty my enjoyment of tobacco is limited to the great
outdoors.  Luckily, my home has a huge, covered second-floor veranda
on which I can sit and puff to my heart's content whenever the spirit
takes me.  I've been a Pipe Digest fan for four or five months now
and wish it a long and prosperous career on the net.  I'd very much
like to see more informational postings regarding national and inter-
national smoking characteristics (why does most continental tobacco
seem stale?  do folks over there like it that way?), commercial to-
bacco additives (what's the *real* skinny on drugstore tobacco - with
names, please) and historical anecdotes (how did churchwardens get
their start?  why don't people smoke them now?  what about clay
pipes?)  It's probable that many of these items have been covered
in prior issues I haven't read.  If so, Steve, is there a web site
where I can get past issues?  Thanks for all your work and good
smoking!

Subject: Intro

I am a new subscriber and thought I would make my entry after reading several
back issues on the Web Page.  I am really happjy to have discovered this
great place to use the new technology for the continuation of a very old and
ancient tradition: pipe smoking. 

I am actually a cigar smoker who has found that pipe smoking is a whole new
world of people who like the pleasure of the finer things in life, there is
nothing I enjoy more than being in the company of fellow afficianados and
having a smoke and some friendly conversation. I am 43 years old and have
been smoking cigars for about six years. I am like many others in that I was
attracted to pipes at an early age would it not have been for a cigarette
habit that took years to quit I would have become a cigar or pipe smoker
earlier. 

I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and am grateful for many of the fine
tobacco establishments we have in this area.  I have enthusiastically
followed the recent trend toward cigar friendly establishments.  Places like
the British Bankers Club are ,I hope, a trend that will ultimately result in
places where the Pipe and Cigar smoking public can enjoy eachothers company.
With the current political climate this may take some doing.  My idea of a
perfect place to smoke is a casual, comfortable, club which may also be a
tobacconists shop. I would like to support an establishment if it were in my
home town. 

The Tobacconist that helped me get started with pipes is not on your list as
far as I can tell.
                   Edwards Pipe and Tobacco Shop
                   El Camino Real &amp; San Antonio Rd
                   Los Altos CA  94022
                   415 941 1228
 
Jim Beardsly who has returned as the store manager is a very knowledgable
gentleman who patiently helped me with my first pipe selection. He got me
started with a wonderful Cavindish Blend that he blended himself ( J B Blend
)   This is the friendly small tobacconist that gives our passtime a good
name.  There are a couple of chairs in the store where you can sit and sample
a bowlful and enjoy the company. 

Thats probably enough for now.  Thanks for making this Digest such a great
place to visit.  
 
JR

[ Thanks, JR! By the way, I have a _lot_ of Edwards Pipe Shops in the
Guide. Is it a chain? -S. ]

[PIPE] Couple of items... the new issue of the Ephemeris and the
permiere issue of Pipe Friendly both arrived in the mail this
week. Tom Dunn included a nice writeup of the Digest near the front of
the Ephemeris. Haven't had a chance yet to do more than skim them, but
it's on my queue!

And, as summer approaches (here in the northern hemisphere, anyway),
stretch out in your favorite hammock, pour yourself something tall and
cool, and light up with us...

Subject: Re: Your Pipes Digest subscription request

Hello Steve and Company....

I've just started to browse my first issue of Pipes Digest and I am very 
excited.  It's great to see fellow lovers of the leaf out there in large 
numbers.

A bit of background... I am 23 years old and have been smoking cigars and 
pipes for the last five years or so. In general, I do prefer pipes, but 
it's really a mood thing for me.  I am a journalism student at San 
Francisco State and I work part time at Sherlock's Haven, a pipe and 
cigar store in San Francisco.  (It's a tough life, you know. :))

As far as favorite smokes go...

Pipes: I like big bowled pipes (i.e. 2 hr plus smokes).  I would say that 
my favorite pipe maker these days is Paul Perri, a retired craftsman in 
southern california, who makes high quality pipes at a low price because 
he does it for enjoyment.

Pipe Tobacco:  I flip between aromatics and virginias.  (Latakia gives me 
the head spins)  Right now I am smoking my ragular aromatic, which isLane 
RLP-6.  At Sherlock's, it goes by the name Black Jack and it is very 
similar to Dunhill's my mixture A20,000, if that helps.  As my treat 
tobaccos, I smoke St. Bruno Flake (Virginia), Butera Blended Flake 
(virginia) and Butera Sweet Cavendish.

Cigars: Amomg Domestically available smokes, I really enjoy Paul 
Garmirian Bellicosos.  From the land of Cuba, although with some caution, 
I love Romeo and Jullietta Churchills.  (Although I just ran into three 
Monte Christo Pyramids, so this may change.)

Just from my browsing of the list so far, it seems that we are all in the 
same boat as far as the anti smoking hysteria, so I look forward to 
comiserating.  But more importantly, I look forward to talking about good 
smokes.

In the leaf we trust,

Chris Freud

Subject: Early Morning Pipe

Re: Jacco van Muiswinkel's post about englishes and Early Morning pipe.

I can think of two possibilities of why the early morning didn't agree 
with you.

1)Maybe Early Morning, the blend itself just doesn't agree with you.  I 
would try another english blend.  Who knows? You may like the new blend 
and your problem is solved

2)You may not react well to latakia.  I for one am among that rank.  I 
have smoked Early Morning, 965, Nightcap, other Lane Englishes and 
Esoterica blends and I just get the spins.  Not all toboacco is right for 
everyone and englishes certainly aren't for me.

On that vein... have other people have similar reaction to different 
styles of tobaccos?  I have found that I enjoy virginias and aromatics, 
whereas some of my fellows smokers get the spins when smoking virginias 
or can't stand the chemicals in some aromatics.

Thoughts?

Subject: Cubans

Tim-

I have a friend who just came back from Europe with two full boxes of 
relabeled Cohibas so it is quite common practice. One just has to be 
extremely careful from whom you buy your cuban cigars whether it be in 
the US (there 10 million cubans a year in the US) or abroad.  There are a 
lot of fraud artists out there willing to take advantage of the 
undiscriminating buyer.

Subject: Water pipes

I read in #189 that there is some kind of shortage of water pipes. Well I
live in San Fracisco and there is water pipes of all sorts. Old, new, big,
small, just about anything you can think of. I think it is due mainly due to
the fact that the hippies like to smoke marijuana in them because it burns so
hot. If anyone is intrested e-mail me with a discription of what you are
looking for and I'll check it out. most likely I can just provide you with
name and number of the shop for you to just order it and have them send it to
you. If they do not ship I would be more than happy to do it for you, free of
charge.

Subject: Alfred Baier, pipemaker

Dear Steve,
  I spent a week in Vermont this February, and happened upon a nice fellow who 
makes pipes in the town of Manchester.  My friend and I were driving down the
road on our way to a museum one morning, and my eye caught a sign with the
shape of a pipe on it that read "pipemaker" and "Butternut Lane" which was
just ahead.  
  Turning onto the snowy road, we managed our way down to another sign in
front of a small shop emblazoned with the telltale pipe shape.   Through the
frosty window we could see a bearded fellow clad in a worn apron with clouds
of smoke billowing from a freehand bent clenched tightly in his teeth.  It was 
Alfred Baier, the pipemaker known for his unusual carvings in briar.   What a
treat this was for me, as I had just completed my fourth handcarved pipe, and
had never met another pipemaker, much less expect to find one by accident a
thousand miles from my Louisiana home!  We were greeted at the door by a
friendly Mrs. Baier who escorted us through the house and into the pipe shop.  
Alfred peered up from a pipe he was staining and welcomed us.   His showed us
samples of his carvings and preliminary drawings he had done for an upcoming
job as well as photos of earlier works.  Basically, the fellow will carve just 
about anything you can imagine in briar!  His shop was cluttered with
machinery and hand tools -- tools of the pipemaker's trade.  We stayed about
45 minutes with him and then headed back on the road to our museum
destination.  Had we not been pressed for time I certainly would have stayed
longer.   If anyone is interested in obtaining a hand carved pipe -- a
one-of-a-kind pipe with animal head, portraits, ect., you can contact Alfred
Baier at Butternut Lane, PO Box 2043, Manchester, VT, 05255.  You won't meet a 
nicer fellow anywhere.

Steve: In the Digest Kameran Kashani asked if he was getting ripped off 
on Cubans at $20-$22 Canadian. I just got back from Hong Kong and the 
larger Cohibas were going for $25 US whilte the smaller sizes were going 
for $20US. I checked prices at the Davidoff store in the Peninsula and 
the Coiba Divan in the Oriental and both were the same. Regards, John

Steve, You may have already received a post about this, if so, feel 
free to delete it (I didnt get a chance to read all of #182).  Several 
members of Alt.Smokers.Cigars started having IRC chat sessions every 
Saturday afternoon at 2 P.M. EDT.  What started as a few people has 
grown to the point that just about any night of the week the chat line 
is going with at least 3-4 people.  The channel is #cigarsmokers.  We 
have also started a channel on Undernet in hopes of making it 
permanent.  Discussion runs rampant from cigars to pipes to politics to 
computers.  I have made several cyberspace friends in this forum.  I 
would welcome anyone to our chat sessions, or invite someone to 
organize a #pipesmokers chat conference.  BTW, there are directions on 
how to access the chat channels on the Fuji web page.

[ I've put #cigarrsmokers in the Guide, David!  What a great idea!
Can't organize a regular #pipesmokers chat session just now, but
perhaps one of our other members would like to take the initiative. -S. ]

Subject: Underage Smokers

Dear Steve:
           I noted in your most recent issue that posts from or
about underage pipe smokers (15 years in the last issue) are 
still being presented.  So far as I know, in most states it's 
against the law to sell tobacco to young folk under 18.  While 
I'm well aware that many are irritated by the present tendency 
to anti-smoking legislation, the underage tobacco sales ban is 
generally agreed to be a good thing: people should be well on
their way to being adults before deciding whether or not to be-
come smokers.  Accordingly, just as you regulate other appearances 
in the pages of Pipes Digest, I'd strongly suggest your excluding 
and/or discouraging posts from or directed towards underage smokers.  

Regards,

Bob

[ You're correct; it's against the law to sell tobacco to a minor.
The Digest doesn't encourage breaking the law.  However, IMHO, people
grow up at different times.  It really ought to be the decision of the
parent or guardian.

Anyway, I'm not going to change the Digest's policy to include such
discussions as a censorable item. Though I would discourage underage
smokers from trying to use the Digest to cadge tobak.  I'd rather see
them consult their parents on this. -S. ]

To Steve and all the others who can read this.

Hello,

nice to meet you.

Sorry, that i answered so late to your
newsgruop, but i am in the middle of
my 'Vordiplom', i am a physik student and
it is a verry hard job in the moment.

I am very new in this stuff of communication.
So i simply replied to your message.
I hope that this is the right way to post
a statement in your corner.
I am a new member of the club of pipe smokers.
I am from Frankfurt, Germany, so please excuse my bad 
pronounciation.

I have two problems here in germany the
industrie thougt that they only be able to sell
pipes with the 9mm Filter in, and what do you think
about this.
How many of you use pipes with a filter in it.

Here in germany we had a new tobacco from
danmark, it is ORLIK CLUB and it tastes
very good.

I had a further problem, during the smoking a pipe
the temperature of this pipe gets rather high,
how does profis in pipe smoking handle this?

If somebody out there can give me a good answer
i will be happy for it.

With friendly wishes
		M.Brandstetter

[ [ Re the filterless pipes, how about just pulling the filter out?
(Or can't they be pulled out?) Re getting hot, it's probably caused by
puffing too fast, improper packing, or tobak that's too dry or too
wet.  Experiment, and find the cause. And welcome! -S. ]

Subject: Re: Your Pipes Digest subscription request

Steve!

Thanks for the welcome. Good to meet fellow pipe smokers on the
Net - here in Norway the Pipes smoker is a lonely hobby.

I am a Norwegian, 51 years - been smoking since the summer of
1968 but I started with mild tobaccos and low priced pipes (starting
out carefully...) and so it took half a year before I bought a good pipe
(all or nothing!) and a stronger tobacco (Three Nuns) and discovered that
this was good. 

So since then I have been a regular. Have ca 30 pipes - major part of the
collection is Stanwell who constantly surprise me with their selection
of pipes that are beautiful, good to smoke and reasonably priced. I have also
some "Larsen" pipes - Norwegian brand now made in Denmark. Excellent
products.

I buy most of my pipes travelling - especially in Copenhagen. Ah - the joys
and frustration of "Stroeget" - the main shopping street  in the center
of town and with  some ofe the best tobacco shops. All those beautiful pipes
displayed there! And the supreme frustration that I cannot have them all
- my purse is too shallow, my life is to short, my mouth is too little!

Favourite tobaccos are still Three Nuns and (my main favorite) 
St Bruno Flake. Mick McQaid was a third, but here in Norway
we only get the ready rubbed version. Not for me! Occasionally
I get the MMcQ from Smith Snuff shop in London in the square cut.
Much better.

Prices for tobacco is here in Norway about 80 kr for 50 grams -
that is about 13 USD or 7.5 GBP.

Smoke well!

Subject: Countdown started/Pipestone info.

Hello again, all--

A couple things to pass on since last I wrote-- 1) Countdown to
liftoff--Pipes Digest, reporter at large and 2) some more info. from the
gratious people of the Pipes Digest:

My X-Country Excursion to Start Soon:
I got a canopy on the truck yesterday, I have a housesitter lined up.  I just
need to prepay a few bills, get my dog settled in at my folks house, get the
housesitter squared away and then I'm ready to load the truck and head out!
 Periodic updates to the PD will begin soon after!  In the meantime, I've
gotten more great letters of encouragement and offers to stop in and visit,
and places to spend a night.  Things are shaping up nicely!

I also have a HP200LX palmtop computer which I plan to keep with me at all
times.  I should be able to take "on location" notes while job hunting, and
(more importantly :) while visiting pipe stops, which can be uploaded to the
portable computer that I'll bring with me.  Then, I'll hook the modem up when
I come close to phonelines and power, and send you updates as I can.

In case I didn't say it before, I'm hoping that I'll be able to stay in close
enough touch with the Steve and the Pipes Digest crew so that as I come into
a region of the country that might have a particularly interesting stop, that
I can be alerted by the PD readers and change course so that I can attempt to
make a visit and report back.  The beauty of this trip (I hope), will be that
I don't HAVE to be in any particular place at any particular time.  If a
place sounds promising, I'll check it out.

PipeStones and Exotic Equipment:
I got a great letter from James Lawson that was real interesting, so I wanted
to share the great story he wrote to me.  He originally wrote me about the
pipe stones I was interested in, but also talks about some other interesting
experiences later of how he was able to talk, over the phone, with the author
of "The Ultimate Pipe Book":

---------- Portions of James' letter follow -------------
 ...He sold me a piece of equipment that was written about and pictured in his
book.  He threw in a whole case of EricsKeystones along with the piece of
equipment I inquired about, at no extra charge.  I was gratified.

I have been very pleased with the Keystones.  I smoke nearly every type of
pipe tobacco - even the aromatics.  As you know, the aromatics burn wet.  The
Keystones work quite well, IMHO.

As far as I know, the stones are not available in this country.  They come
from Denmark, a lovely country that I have visited many times.  I will
certainly try to access more Keystones on my next visit.

Hope this interests you,

James Lawson (aka BriarPipes)

From:	BriarPipes
To	JCJEWELL

Hi again, Charlie,

The piece of equipment I alluded to in Hacker's book was the Pipeking.  This
machine cleans one's briar pipes if used properly.

I'll briefly describe it.  The unit has a small electric motor mounted on it.
There is an adjustable clip which holds the pipe by its stem.  The mouthpiece
of the pipe is inserted into a flexible, rubber hose that is attached to the
motor housing.  To clean one's pipe, you fill the bowl with the cleaning
solution provided (grain alcohol will work).  You then turn the motor on,
ensuring that there is a clean filter in the motor.  Within minutes the pipe
is drained of the cleaning solution and ready for the pipe cleaner swabbing.
I have found that this unit, though noisy, is quite effective.  Hacker wrote
in his book that the Pipeking is also useful for accelerating the browning of
meerschaum pipes.  I have had less success with this purpose.  

Rick Hacker was very pleasant to me on the phone when I called him about the
Pipeking.  We agreed on a price for the very Pipeking that he photographed in
the 2nd edition of his pipe book.  Once I mailed him a check he shipped the
unit right out (along with the EricsKeystones I mentioned earlier).  He wrote
me a handwritten letter on his personalized stationery that features his
likeness in a cartoon form.  Very nice.

When I'm not using the Pipeking, I keep it on my desk in the office.  It sits
next to my pipe tobacco humidor and an antique oil lamp.  It is an
interesting conversation piece when people see it.   ...

---------- End of James' excerpts --------------

So, if anyone out there knows of a place that has the pipestones that James
talked about, (check your local tobacco shop--mine didn't have them!), I, and
I'm sure others, wouldn't mind knowing where to get them.

Type to you all later -- Thanks, Steve.  You've heard it before, but hear it
again:  You do a great job of administering the pipes mailing list!

--Charlie Jewell

[ Thanks, and we'll be looking forward to reading of your Blue Smoke
Highways trip! -S. ]

Subject: L'art de Fumer la pipe

Steve,

While I was living in France, I picked up a brochure in a pipe shop.  It is
put out by Ch. CORRIEU.  It is in French but I will attempt to offer an
adequate translation.  NOTE!  I do not pretend to be a French-language
scholar.  Also, I will by necessity omit the obligatory accent markings in
the French text.  Hope this doesn't offend any French-speaking members.

LES 7 REGLES DU FUMEUR DE PIPE
(The 7 rules of the pipe smoker)

1.  Pour fumer une pipe neuve: Les 5 premieres fois, remplissez votre pipe au
tiers.  Les 5 fois suivantes, remplissez-la a moitie.  Fumez toujours votre
pipe completement.
(Trans.  In smoking a new pipe: the first five times, fill your pipe one
third of the way.  The next five times fill it half-way.  Always smoke your
pipe completely.)

2.  Bourrez votre pipe par petites quantites en tassant bien le tabac, sans
toutefois lui faire perdre son elasticite.
(Trans.  Fill your pipe with small quantities of tobacco and tamp it without
losing its springiness.)

3.  Fumez tranquillement, par larges boufees, pour ne pas surchauffer le
fourneau.  Fumer par petits coups precipites echauffe la fumee et donne un
gout acre.
(Trans.  Smoke slowly, with long puffs so that you don't overheat the bowl.
 If you smoke with small and fast puffs you heat the smoke and render a
bitter taste.)

4.  Si, en allument votre pipe, le tabac fait des "boucles", retassez-le et
allumez de nouveau.  N'oubliez pas que le tabac doit bruler sur toute sa
surface.  
(Trans.  If the tobacco rises when you light your pipe, tamp it again and
relight it.  Remember that the tobacco must burn over its entire surface.)

5.Rien n'est plus important qu'un bon tirage.  Il vaut mieux vider une pipe
qui tire mal et la bourrer de nouveau, plutot que de fumer une pipe qui
"gargouille".
(Trans.  A right draw is most important.  You should empty a bad-drawing pipe
and refill it, rather than smoke a "gurgling" one.)

6.  Nettoyez regulierement votre pipe avec un cure-pipe.  Enlevez aussi les
debris de tabac et de cendres qui restent au fond, pour etre sur de fumer
"sec".
(Trans.  Consistently clean your pipe with pipe cleaners.  You should remove
the dottle and ashes, that remain in the bowl, so as not to smoke dry. (?))

7.  Si vous avez l'habitude de fumer une pipe apres l'autre, mieux vaut en
avoir plusieurs et les utiliser a tour de role.  Une pipe doit etre
completement refroidie pour etre digne de recevoir un bon tabac.
(Trans.  If you typically smoke several pipefuls you should own several pipes
and alternate them.  A pipe deserves a good tobacco, only after it has
cooled.)

There.  I think I have the basic idea that is intended.  If  members see any
glaring errors - let me know.  Please use English.  I was more extensively
trained in Latin and classical Greek than French, so forgive any
mistranslation.

Next week I hope to submit the short remainder of the brochure which
describes "the pipe-smoking man".

Subject: Tamping While Driving

&gt;&gt;&gt;[ Personally, I keep a tamper in the car, and have no trouble using it
when the occasion arises... but YMMV. -S. ]&lt;&lt;&lt;

Personally, I'm confused by all this brew-ha-ha over how to tamp while 
driving.  I tamp the same way while driving that I do while sitting in my 
deck chair at home -- with my right forefinger.  No special equipment, no 
fuss, no muss, no bother.  This may sound as if I have a cast-iron finger; 
 in truth, I've never suffered a serious burn (or even serious discomfort) 
from doing this.

[ Yes, but doesn't this get ashes on your finger? -S. ]

Subject: When a Stogie becomes a Cigar...Reprint from Toronto Star

This article was published in the Toronto Star, dated May 15th 1995 by staff
reporter Bob Brent, and is retyped without permission with apologies to the
author.
When a Stogie becomes a Cigar...
You might say he has money to burn.
The lowly stogie was raised to exultant heights last night as a Texas real
estate investor bid a combined $29,000 US (about $40,000 Can.) for two boxes
of rare Cuban cigars signed by Fidel Castro himself.
In all, five boxes of Castro's very own Trinidad brand were sold for a total
of $63,000 US, with the money going to Cuban medical relief, as stipulated
by the Cuban leader.
Another $25,000 US was raised for the Variety Village of Ontario to help
physically disabled children
The evening was a love-in for cigar afficionados, who revelled in the thick
cloud of smoke that carpeted a second floor ballroom, obscuring their
revelry as it spilled into the hallways of the Four Seasons Hotel (Toronto).
Each course in the elegant meal was separated by one of four cigar
"interludes", each featuring a differnt brand, including the Cohiba
Espledidos selling at $1,100 a box.
High bidder Eric Brauss was upstaged by actress Whoopi Goldberg, in town
shooting the movie "Bogus", who took home the final batch of Trinidads with
a bid of $9,000 US.
Goldberg consented to having her picture taken with the treasured tocacco
but was mum with reporters.
Brauss, 52, said he was happy to help a good cause while adding to his
collection of rare cigars and bottles of Port wine."I think I'll break down
somewhere (and smoke one)," he told reporters. "It's relaxing...just very
relaxing."
When he does decide to light one up, it will likely be north of the border.
It's illegal under a 30-year-old trade embargo to bring Cuban goods into the
United States.
No problem, said Brauss, who moved to Dallas five years ago from Windsor,
Ontario, where he maintains his collection in a humidor.
Auction organizer Marc Tansy, operations manager for Havana House Cigar &amp;
Tobacco Merchants Ltd., said the U.S. embargo has established Canada as a
"mecca" for American cigar smokers.
While tobacco is grown throughout the Caribbean, Cuba's rich acidic soil
gives the leaves a unique and strong flavour that is unsurpassed, he said.
Tassy described the Trinidads made from leaves selected from the best of
Cuba's tobacco in the Laguito region, as "an absolute rarity," unavailable
for sale.
Cuban leader Castro - oncw known for an ever present cigar clenched in his
fist - has sworn off alcohol and tobacco, but still has the Trinidads made
for him alone, Tassy said.
Each box of 50 Trinidads bore Castro's signature and the date May 3rd 1995.
Havana House was expected to lose money on the $500-a-ticket event which
drew about 140 guests.
Among the up-front costs: about $200 a person for food and liquor with
another $200 a person covering the inter-meal cigar breaks.
Tassy was less willinf to divulge the cost of one other expense on the
evening: a dozen or so young woman models who were hired to attend the event
to - in his words - "break the ice."
"On an evening like this, you end up with a bunch of men sitting at a table
staring at each other," he said.
"There's nothing more boring than a bunch of men sitting at a table staring
at each other."
Actress Kirstie Alley caused a stir, entering the ballroom in a rented
vintage gown on the arm of husband Parker Stevenson. "I know nothing about
cigars execpt that my husband smokes them," she deadpanned. "I've never been
to a smoke - that's what you call this, isn't it ? - but it's very...smoky."

(Again, thanks to Star Staff reporter Bob Brent, for covering the event...GF)

[ That's too rich for my blood, Gord! A thousand-dollar cigar! Wonder
if it would smoke well? -S. ]

I don't know if this has been posted yet- due to the fact that I need 
a while to read this digest for its length- but!- I was at Tender Box 
a few months ago and was discussing the list that I printed up about 
cigars from WWW and the worker told me that they were going to start 
up another WWW page and digest, (for the Tender Box). Just thought 
that I would relay this information to all.

Subject: I'm in Cigar Aficianado!

I'm not sure this is something I want to brag to my reletives about, but
Pipes Digest readers will understand my enthusiasm. I'm quoted in the
article "Smoking in the Boardroom" in this month's Cigar Aficianado!

I really wish they had put my picture in there along with pictures of
all the "Fortune 500 crowd", although even being in the article was a
kick. I've got a Davidoff Double "R" (which I'm distressed to find out
is one of Clinton's brands) in my humidor which I'm planning to smoke
this afternoon while reading the rest of the issue.

Subject: [Cigar] An Introductory Cig

                      Subject:                              Time:  3:56 PM
  OFFICE MEMO         [Cigar] An Introductory Cigar         Date:  5/17/95

Top of the day to you, cigar afficianados!  I have just signed on to Digest
and I thought I might introduce myself; perhaps I might even give you pause to
smile.  I am what you might call a "Saturday Night Cigar Smoker."  About three
months ago, I turned to my girlfriend and said, "Wouldn't it be grand to sit
outside on Saturday night, listen to jazz and blues on the radio, sip some
Scotch and smoke a cigar?"  The idea was absolutely titillating!

So, when Saturday came around, we both strolled into the local tobacco shop
and walked right up to the young man at the counter.  "Sir, we are in the
market for an introductory cigar.  We have never partaken of this particular
pleasure, but this evening we plan on sitting down, listening to jazz and
blues on the radio, sip some Scotch and smoke our very first cigar.  Perhaps
you would be so kind as to make a recommendation?"  Needless to say, the man
behind the counter looked at me like I had four heads!  And then WHAM! he was
off and running in his pitch.

"Now, for an introductory cigar, introductory mind you, you might want to
consider some of these Fuentes, but if you're going to be sipping Scotch maybe
you want to consider a darker cigar, but the jazz and blues twist brings us
right around to (and here he reaches into a box) these Macanudos."  And out he
pulls a huge cigar and my eyes just light up.  "Yes sir, this will give you
several hours of complex yet smooth enjoyment."  He pauses like all great
actors, savoring the taste in his mind.

"Well good.  We'll take two."  And my girlfriend and I walked out with
purchases in hand.  That night we smoked our first cigars (Macanudo Prince
Phillips) while listening to the radio and downing a bottle of Knockandoo
Scotch.  I seemed to enjoy the experience more than she did, which is the
reason why I am tap-tapping on my keyboard at this moment.  Bye for now.

[ Well, both are acquired tastes... -S. ]

Re: Santa Barbara Smoking reversal....

Earlier in the week, the San Francisco Comical ran a story saying that 
Santa Clara County (fifty miles south of San Francisco) is considering 
repealing its strict ordinance against smoking in restaurant and some 
bars.  Apparently local merchants have seen their business drop by 25 
percent.  I'm so happy to see smokers talking with their wallets.  
Unfortunately we can't fight the anti-smoking movement with logic, but 
we can with our wallets.  Of course, the anti-smoking groups are starting to 
get worried that other counties will be coming to their senses.

  The same problems 
that Santa Clara Restraunteurs are encountering in San Francisco, where 
there is no smoking in restaurants and where smoking in bars will be 
banned at the end of the year.  SF restaurants have seen a bit of a drop 
off in business but have encountered another problem: lack of table 
turnover.  Customers have been stepping out during dinner to have a 
smoke, which has extended the time that a table is occupied per party.  
Instead opf getting in three seatings per table a night, restaurant are 
getting two.

Keep on talking with your wallet, people.  Support establishments which 
allow smoking and avoid those that don't.  It is working.

Re: Tamping and Driving

I got very good at this while drinking between school in LA and home in 
San Francisco along I-5.  With my left hand on the wheel, I keep my pipe 
in my mouth and tamp with my right hand.  Then I use my right hand to 
re-light.  It works quite nicely.

Happy safe tamping and driving,

Re: Possible Pipe Magazine/ Cigar Afficianado rant

I would like to see a "Cigar Afficianado" type magazine for pipes, BUT, I 
really would hope it would stay away from that magazine's inane rating 
system.

First... CA compares apples and oranges in its testing.  In its recent 
tasting of churchills, it compared a Cuban Romeo and Jullietta and a 
Macanudo.  The only thing those two cigars have in common is their size.  
If you like a light cigar, the Macanudo is a 90, while the Romeo and 
Julliet is a 50, because that sucker is going to make you throw up.  If 
you like a heavy smoke, as I do, then the Romeo is superb and the 
Macanudo is a waste of my time.  Long story short, the CA taster's taste 
in cigars has as much of an influence in the ratings as the cigar itself.
I really wouldn't want to see a pipe magazine rating aromatics and 
englishes in the same tasting.  Yikes!

Second... What's in a number?  Most of the tastings have a few cigars 
over ninety and then a whole bunch in the 80s.  Can you honnestly tell me 
the difference between a cigar that's rated an 85 and one that's an 87?

Third... While CA has done wonders for the cigar industry, its rating 
have turned smoking into a real status thing.  The store I work at had La 
Gloria Cubanas and Licenciados for years and no one bought them (This 
is not to say they're not good cigars.  I like la glorias).  CA 
gave them a fancy rating and we haven't been able to stock them since.  
Some people in the industry do consider good ratings a curse for this 
reason.
  
The testings are good in that they tell people what's out there.  I don't 
have a problem if you see a cigar with a high rating and you want to try 
it.  By all means.  But, don't like a cigar because it got a nice 
number.  Like it because you enjoy the taste, contrsuction, draw, etc...

But getting back to the point... While I would like to see an increase in 
pipe smoking, I don't want to see what CA has done to the cigar industry 
to the pipe industry.  (I would bet you that if there were ratings on 
pipe tobacco, you would never see esoterica tobacco again... and lemme 
tell you that would tick me off.)

End rant....

Subject:   MANY THANKS!

Greetings and Gratitude to you, Steve, for sending me my first issue. This
is a super media for me. I don't know very many people for whom
pipe-smoking and the things around it is a hobby and a love. Cigarettes was
a habit; my pipes are a totally different matter.

I began my love affair with pipes when I was in seminary in St. Paul, MN 25
years ago. There were so many pipe shops around back then and I tried to
make all of them regularly.

Early on I started smoking Edwards' Scottish Moor and in 25 years have
managed to move over to Edwards' Brandywine. Tried a lot of tobaccos, but
none grab my taste buds the way these two do. Occasionally I like a latakia
blend and prefer Tinder Box's Philosopher. Used to smoke a Charatan or Lane
Limited blend that came only in small tins back then; I think it was called
Crown Royale or something like that. Heavenly, but I haven't seen it in
years and never in bulk. It was expensive.

I still like Edwards pipes, of which I collected many, but have not bought
one in years. The only Edwards shop I know of in Texas is in Dallas, where
I get my tobacco. I have a number of Peterson's and Peterson Seconds (Irish
Seconds). I actually prefer the seconds for an all day smoke because the
system pipes get gooey after a couple of smokes and need a couple days
rest.

Yes, Edwards is a chain of stores. Not as many as there used to be. A
result, I am sure, of the anti-smoking lobby, as are many good
tobacconists. Down here we smokers often are made to feel like lepers for
enjoying a good smoke.

I suppose that is why it is so refreshing to make this connection. Thanks.

Peace,

Steve, St. John Lutheran Church, Port Arthur, Texas

Hi, Steve.

[ Administrativa deleted. -S. ]

Yours, Ehud.

PS:  The City of Vancouver B. C. is planning to set a by-law that will
prevent smoking in all public buildings.  Their avowed goal is to have 14
municipalities also pass the same resolution so that city business will not
suffers.  And you thought you had it tough in the states!  (You can print
this in the list)

[ See Chris's letter above. If I were in one of the suburbs, I'd say
now would be a great time to open a cigar-friendly establishment...
Or better yet, be ready to in case the ordinance passes.
Vancouverites, please write the city government. And vote with your
wallets! -S. ]

Subject: Canadian Excursion

This summer I will be traveling to Glacier National Park in the state
of Montana.  Part of the park goes in to Canada.  While I'm there I
figure it would be excellent to pick up a few Cuban Cigars.  I am very
partial to Cohibas myself.  I was wondering if anyone knew of a place
where I could purchase some (Cohiba or other Cubans.  That is in close
proximity to the park Canadian area??  Any help would be much
appreciated.  Thanks

Jeff

Subject: Dunhill's Stomach-Troubling Blend?

Hello Steve, and thank you for providing PD.

Those who are frequent readers of a.s.c. will know me as a Davidoff shill 
and all-around hack, but I have a darker side...

I'm also an undercover Customs agent!

JUST KIDDING!

I smoke a _very_ infrequent pipe.  Literally, less than once a month.  I 
enjoy it, and it does a nice job of masking the cigar smoke, but I prefer 
stogies.  Nonetheless, I do have a question or two:

1) Regarding the letter a few issues back from Jacco van Muiswinkel, who 
complained about Dunhill Early Morning making him sick.  I used to smoke a 
pipe much more frequently 3-4 years ago.  I just smoked aromatics, nothing 
fancy.  On a trip to Europe, however, I stopped at Dunhill's in London and 
picked up their sampler pack of 5-6 tins, including Early Morning.  I tried 
all the tins, and at least 3 or 4 made me quite nauseous.  Was my 
experience, as Jacco's, just a result of inexperience, or is there something 
more to it.  I am allergic to nuts, but I don't see how that would
factor in.... 

2) My two pipes (used to be three) were given to me by my grandfather, who 
has been smoking pipes for 50+ years.  They are "Parker" pipes (a 
"Tanglewood" and an "Avondale"); he says they he bought them at Dunhill's, 
but doesn't know any more.  Anyone know anything about the provenance of these?

Many, many thanks.

It's hard as heck to type when you're holding a cigar.

[ Hey, I already did the April 1 issue two months ago! :-) -S. ]

Subject: Smoking and Gastritis

Recently I went to my doctor for stomach trouble, a suspected ulcer, and
her initial advice was to stay away from Coca Cola, coffee (decaf or not),
high-acid foods and strong teas as well as alcohol. Plus some heavy anticid
to quell those churning moments. She knows I smoke pipes and cigars and she
suggested I stay away from those for three weeks.

Anyone ever get an upset stomach from smoking? I don't think I ever have.
Because we don't inhale does some of that make it down the other pipe to
the stomach? Just wondering. I'm following her advice because I don't think
I'll get a stomach transplant anytime soon, but I'm puzzled just by that
part of the advice. I wonder if she was just trying to curb my smoking?

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #189 - May 13, 1995

Steve,

I send you the address of Gimeno, the best pipe shop in Barcelona. This may
be helpful to any puffer visiting the city. They have an amazing variety of
pipes and pipe accesories, but they don*t sell tobacco. Actually, there is
another good shop also named Gimeno in "Les Rambles", a very well known
boulevard. This shop sells both pipes and tobacco, but has a lesser range of
pipes avilable. Both shops were part of a common business years ago, and it
seems that the old owner split his legacy between his sons when he died. Here
is the adress of the first shop, because I don*t know wich is the precise
addres of the second one:

                     Gimeno, Hogar del Fumador
                     Paseo de Gracia, 101
                     08008 Barcelona
                     Spain

                     Telephone: +34 3 237 20 78

Anybody interested should ask for Elena, the lady responsible for the pipe
department.

Besides this, to buy tobacco is quite easy in my country. We have a
governement owned monopoly for tobacco distribution that licenses many shops
to sell tobacco products. Those shops are generically called "estancos". You
will find available an acceptable range of pipe tobacco brands in any of
those "estancos" (in Spain scandinavian and dutch mixtures are preferred
rather than english ones). If you don't find what you want, then ask the
tobacconist to look in his catalog, and if it's there it will be available
the next day. But if your best loved tobacco is not in the catallog then just
forget it, because this means that this product is not being distributed by
the spanish monopoly.

That's all the help I can give. If I find any other good shops I will tell
you. Thanks for keeping the digest and good luck !

Ricard Pardell, from Barcelona.

[ Thank you for the reference, Richard, and the report from Spain! -S. ]

[PIPE] I've been reading the new Ephemeris a bit, and noticed that
there's a really nice guide to the Peterson stamps. They change every
year, so you can identify the year any Peterson was made!  Good
scanner material, hint hint :-)

And join us now for an evening smoke as we explore the Holmes canon,
Haight-Ashbury, hookahs, the French language, and the Wicket City...

Subject: &lt;swoosh&gt;..&lt;puff&gt;..&lt;swoosh&gt;..Ahh

Hello, all. I'm a newcomer to the list, having read only two of
them. It's really a big deal to me to see so many people in love with
smoking pipes -- I still haven't met anyone who smokes pipes, or
cigars for that matter, on a regular basis.

I guess I should shed some background light..

I'm 20 years old and a few days, and have been smoking my pipe for
about a year. That should teach most of the people who think they're
in the young end of the spectrum! ;-) I work as sysadmin here at
Florida State University's Nuclear Physics Dept, and am going to
school to earn my BS in Computer Science, so that I can travel at my
whim and be assured of finding a good job waiting for me at the end of
the trail. I also want to keep studying, since my true interests don't
lie in CS: math, physics, electronics, literature, psychology and
philology are just a few of the things I'm interested in.

I smoke cigars at the rate of about one a fortnight. They're just too
expensive. Except for the ones I like the best. In my hometown,
Miami, old Cuban guys, including my grandfather, spend their days
handmaking cigars and smoking them while they play dominos. To pay for
their losses there, they sell what cigars are left over to people
passing by. I tend to be one of those people anytime I get a
chance. Going home with an assortment of about 10 cigars, I only paid
about as many dollars! And I like them as much or better than any of
the expensive brands.. Macanudo, Dunhill, etc. 

But really I like to smoke my pipe. I had a rough time of it for the
first period, since there was noone to teach me what to do or how to
do it. I bought a small plastic pipe and an ounce of black cavendish
from a local store, since everyone told me I wouldn't like it. Now I
have 6 briars (one with meerschaum lining), and 3 cobs. My favorite
pipe was my meerschaum, but I broke it at the shank while trying to
remove the stem for a cleaning. After that I've been more careful. I
also gave my cousin my falcon pipe (nowhere to hold it, really, but it
looked nice), and had my favourite briar stolen. Slowly building a
modest collection, and trying more types of leaf, are my goals.

Anyway, now I like to smoke a wide variety of tobaccos, but my
favourite is still black cavendish, especially from a meerschaum. Add
a snifter of brandy (or cognac), "and that's what it's all about."

I have a little nasty trick I play on restaurants that won't let me
smoke a pipe: I have a clove! They smell almost as strongly, and not
necessarily as nicely, and if they make a fuss, I call the manager,
etc, and make a fuss right back. I know, it's not nice, and it makes
people even madder at smokers in the big picture of things, but it
abates my childish anger..

I hope there are people reading this in the Tallahassee area, and I
hope they would like to get together for a while and chat. It gets
kinda lonely, but that's a good feeling, too. 

I'd like to present to everyone a small endeavor I've been working on,
my Smokin' HomePage. It's not very fancy, but it has some useful
things in it already, and it's growing fast. Take this road, make a
left, three blocks down, and you'll come to:

	<a href="http://nucalf.physics.fsu.edu/~santana/smokin/">http://nucalf.physics.fsu.edu/~santana/smokin/</a>

That's all,
 .dave

[ I'll have a look at the homepage! Thanks! -S. ]

Hello, and please sign me up for the Pipes mailgroup!

Here's a little about myself and my tobacco interests:

I am 29 and began smoking pipes at age 18, because a friend and I were
so influenced by Tolkien. We waited until we were about out of high
school, and treated our first pipe purchase and use to be a
"coming-of-age" event. I still have that pipe, an Israeli Alpha
oom-paul, and still smoke and cherish it. I still buy my tobacco from
the same tobacconist I bought that pipe from.

Since then, I have experimented with many popular pipe brands and
styles and have come to prefer bent Savinelli pipes with the Dry
System filter. After similar experimentation with tobaccos, I confess
to still preferring the aromatics, usually mild cavendish &amp; burley
blends, not too heavily sugared, although a little Virginia or Perique
adds some needed spice. Latakia and English blends don't generally
agree with me, although I'm still open to suggestions.

About two years ago another friend introduced me to the pleasures of
smoking premium handmade cigars, and I have enjoyed exploring this new
angle on tobacco enjoyment. So far, I consistently enjoy just about
anything from Partagas, Arturo Fuente, and Avo. I've also recently
become a fan of Dunhill Monte Cruz robustos, but my absolute
hands-down favorite (unfortunately for my wallet) are the three Avo XO
varieties.

I treat tobacco as a special treat and thus smoke infrequently - maybe
once or twice a week. I have never been interested in habitual tobacco
use; I guess a still carry my adolescent motives around, and I just
can't see Gandalf strung out on nicotine!  ;)

I'm looking forward to hearing from group members: for example, do
y'all agree that the Avo XOs add anything significant to the regular
Avos? My tobacconist says he can't taste much significant difference,
but I certainly do!

Hi Steve (and everyone),
	I just wanted to take the time to stop lurking (for a few months) and 
introduce myself. My name is Daniel Meaney (yes, another Irish-American :] ). 
I am 35, and I live in what we call "The Middle Kingdom", San Luis Obispo 
County, California. I'm a Radiation Health Physics\RadioChemistry Technician 
at a little Nuclear plant we have here (yes..It's safe..and I don't glow :] ).

I have been a Cigar Enthusiast for about 2 years, ever since discovering our 
local Cigar store called "The Sanctuary" (It's called this due to the fact 
that it is a crime to smoke anything, inside anyplace, in San Luis Obispo 
except this One store).

My favorites are Avo #9's and R&amp;J #3 Vintage ( as you can see, I do like the 
Robusto!), preferably with a wee dram of Laphroig or Lagavulin. I have yet to 
try a Cuban, but have been pestering a few friends that are traveling to other 
realms to maybe check out a few shops for me. 

One of the Hi-Lites of the past few months was a Cigar Dinner put on by The 
Sanctuary. We started with H.Upmann Churchill's, and ended with Santa Domina 
#100's. Our guest speaker was Richard Hacker (The Ultimate Cigar Book). We 
also left with a pocket full of different Consolidated Cigar Co.'s products. 
This was my first experience with a room full of Enthusiasts, boy was it a 
blast! And the food was excellent also! 

I want to thank you for doing a great job with the list, and to keep 'em 
coming!

Smoke 'em if ya got 'em,
Daniel

Subject: Plano/Dallas Pipe Club?

Hi Steve:

I've looked through the resource guide and did'nt find any. I was 
wondering if anyone on the list was aware of a Pipe Smokers'/Collectors' 
club in the Plano or Dallas area, or if anyone would be interested in 
starting one. 

If anyone has any info or would be interested in starting something, 
please drop me an E-Mail.

Puff in Peace!

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #190 - May 22, 1995 

1.  Thanks for maintaining this mailing list; I really enjoy it, even if it has
become rather cigar centered lately.  Nothing all that wrong with cigars but
they lack my favorite thing about pipes - the variety of flavor.  Sure there
is alot of variety, but it's not as much as that provided by pipe tobacco when
you include aromatics.  Where could I find a virginia/burley mix with some
perique in it in a cigar?  (Watch, someone will know of one..;)

2.  I agree that the Falcon is simply the best pipe I've ever seen or smoked.
I don't think mine's the prettiest I've ever seen but for smoking a bowl down
to the bottom without relights, gurgles, sour, or overly hot smoke it's the
absolute best - nothing else comes anywhere near it for pleasant smoking or
easy cleaning.  Well, I haven't tried a calabash, and water pipes are in some
senses more pleasant than any other kind of pipe.

3. I notice most tobaccos people say they prefer have a brand name.  I've seen
brand name tobaccos but always opted for the loose jarred tobaccos, or had the
tobacconist mix a custom blend.  My two favorites are the 50/50 vir/bur mix w/
perique mentioned above (adjust perique level to taste; the burley cools the
hot burning virginia and takes the edge off its taste, while the VA keeps the
cool burley from going out too easily and lends its sweetness).  Two is an even
mix of RB Light (which your tobacconist probably has, though it may be known by
a better sounding label name.  1-Q works also, both are very mild virginias) 
with a cherry cavendish.  I find pure CC a bit too sweet and it tends to smoke
too moist without being cut with a drier tobacco.

4. Cigarretes seem to have a bad name around here but I've been
handrolling them lately with Three Castles or American Spirit (pure
VA) tobacco and they're as tasty as any pipe that way.  I notice
American Spirit is selling manufactured cigarettes with their natural
tobacco now, but they're filters which I tend not to like so well.  I
tried rolling with an aromatic pipe tobacco but that was a bit much.
The RB/Cherry blend almost worked, maybe an American Spirit &amp; Cherry
would really work.

5.  The web site is impressive, even if it did take me a bit to discover the 
new address.  Shame that Cray couldn't stay in business.

Klisma #1 @ 5442 WWIVnet   --- the person Andy Wallace mentioned who was
                               forwarding these digests, that's me.
