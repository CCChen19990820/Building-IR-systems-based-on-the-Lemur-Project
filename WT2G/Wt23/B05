The citric acid surface treatment process is intended to remove oil, existing   
coatings, and iron oxide (rust) from bilge areas prior to recoating with        
paint.  The entire process entails the preparation of bilge and equipment,      
acquisition of chemicals and tools required, degreasing/cleaning work, paint    
removal, citric acid rust removal, passivation of bare steel, and drying and    
preparation for coating applications.

The best quality paint will perform effectively only if applied to a surface    
which has been properly prepared.  The adequate surface preparation is to       
increase durability and the achievement of the maximum coating life with        
minimum repairs and repainting.  Surface coatings in the entire bilge area      
shall be removed 100 percent to ensure new coating adhesion and minimize the    
possibility of defects such as blistering, peeling, flaking, and underfilm      
rusting.

    c.  Identify hose/piping routes and steps to be taken to protect equipment  
along those routes.                                                             
                                                                                
        (1) Location of work.                                                   
                                                                                
        (2) Type and location of warning signs.                                 
                                                                                
        (3) Type and location of portable ventilation required.                 
                                                                                
        (4) Means of communication to be utilized.                              
                                                                                
        (5) Type of hoses and material compatibility to chemicals used for

    d.  One piece, full body chemical resistant suits, either disposable or     
reuseable, shall be used where possible.  When not in one piece, protective     
suits shall be worn sealed at wrists, neck, and ankles to prevent leakage.      
Suits are required when using the degreasers, the citric acid, and the          
triethanolamine.  In addition, organic vapor/mist cartridges on NIOSH-approved  
cartridge respirators and either face shields or tight-fitting goggles must be  
worn.  Note that the use of any type of tape on the suits or gloves may fail    
because the chemicals will dissolve the adhesive on the tape.  Duct tape seems  
to work best.  If the tape gets saturated, it should be changed to prevent      
leakage into the gloves or boots.                                               
                                                                                
    e.  Full rain suits with goggles and/or face shields and NIOSH approved     
cartridge respirators with organic vapor/mist cartridges may be used in lieu    
of the chemical resistant suits for those employees working with chemical but   
not in a confined space.                                                        
                                                                                
    f.  Emergency eye wash equipment must be readily available in the area.

includes splash goggles or face shields.                                        
                                                                                
    b.  Smoking, open flames (such as matches and torches), and hot work are    
prohibited in or near the areas where the chemicals are mixed, applied, or      
transferred.                                                                    
                                                                                
    c.  Skin contact, eye contact, ingestion, and breathing mists or vapors     
shall be avoided.  Skin that comes in contact with the degreaser, citric acid,  
or triethanolamine solutions specified in this process instruction shall be     
promptly cleaned with soap and thoroughly flushed with water (at least 15       
minutes, with the eyelids held open) and medical attention obtained.            
                                                                                
    d.  NIOSH-approved cartridge respirators shall be worn when applying and    
rinsing chemicals in the workspace.  Organic vapor/mist cartridge shall be      
used.                                                                           
                                                                                
    e.  Personnel using the hydroblast guns and compressed air for blowdown     
shall be particularly careful never to direct the blast steam on themselves,    
in the direction of others, or above a horizontal direction when above the      
deck plates when working in any bilge area.

        (2) Coating coverage and dry film thicknesses for the specified paint   
system used.                                                                    
                                                                                
    e.  Provide one man per shift during citric acid treatment for exhaust      
ventilation, heat, temporary services, utilities, and dehumidification          
equipment.                                                                      
                                                                                
    f.  Provide monitors to conduct gas free analysis during the citric acid    
treatment process, as required.  Provide chemical waste containers as required  
during the citric acid treatment process.

9.  Degreasing                                                                  
                                                                                
    a.  Apply degreaser by means of a hand-held sprayer.  Use an                
extended-length wand and adjust the tip for a non-atomizing stream or slight    
spray.  Observe the safety precaution requirements.                             
                                                                                
    b.  Apply the degreaser solution liberally to beams, stiffeners,            
longitudinals, machinery supports, and deck plate supports.  Pay particular     
attention to the undersides of beams, supports, etc.  Allow the cleaning        
solution to stand for 15 to 30 minutes after application.                       
                                                                                
    c.  Using a stiff-bristled brush, work the cleaning solution into areas     
that show heavy oil and grease deposits.  Apply more cleaning solution as       
necessary.  Allow to stand for 15 to 20 minutes prior to washdown.              
                                                                                
    d.  Wash down the cleaning solution and any removed residue with fresh      
water.  The high pressure pumps are used for this purpose.  Use the highest     
pressure steam for large deposits.  Wash the solution toward a stripping pump   
placed in the lowest portion of the bilge.  Exercise extreme caution when       
working with pressures generated by the high pressure pumps.                    
                                                                                
    e.  Using the stripping pump, transfer the degreaser solution and residue   
to the appropriate chemical waste tank/trailer.  Continue to rinse/flush the    
bilge surfaces until removal or the degreaser is complete.                      
                                                                                
    f.  Closely inspect the bilge area to ensure a complete removal of oil and  
grease deposits.  If there has not been a complete oil and grease removal,      
repeat Steps a through e as necessary.                                          
                                                                                
10. Paint Removal                                                               
                                                                                
    a.  Power tool clean each bilge space to bare metal to expose 100 percent   
of the base metal for citric acid cleaning.  Accomplish the requirements of     
Surface Preparation Specification SSPC-SP-11 of 2.b.                            
                                                                                
    b.  Power wire brushing is not authorized.  Do not burnish or polish        
surfaces.                                                                       
                                                                                
CHECK POINT  (100 Percent Paint Removal)                                        
                                                                                
    c.  Accomplish a visual inspection of the mechanically cleaned bilge space  
to ensure complete removal of all paint, rust, scale and surface,               
contaminants.  If there has not been a complete removal for 100 percent         
exposure of the base metal, continue power tool cleaning or hand scaling each   
bilge space to expose 100 percent of the base metal for citric acid cleaning.   
                                                                                
11. Citric Acid Cleaning                                                        
                                                                                
    a.  Citric Acid Rust Removal                                                
                                                                                
        (1) Prepare a 10 percent citric acid cleaning solution in one of the    
citric acid treatment rig's 1,000 gallon tanks, adjust the pH to 3.5 plus or    
minus 0.1 with triethanolamine (TEA).  Approximate mixing ratio of 900 pounds   
of citric acid and 67.5 gallons of TEA added to 1,000 gallons of water.  The    
on-site chemist will direct the mixing and adjust the solution's                
concentration, pH, and temperature when necessary.  Observe the safety          
precaution requirements.                                                        
                                                                                
        (2) Using high pressure pump(s), transfer the hot (180 degrees          
Fahrenheit plus or minus 5 degrees Fahrenheit) citric acid solution through     
the one-inch I.D. high pressure hose to the bilge area being treated.  Monitor  
the space during the citric acid application for free hydrogen gas.             
                                                                                
        (3) Cautiously apply the hot citric acid liberally to the bilge area    
using hydroblast guns with stainless steel nozzles or other fabricated          
1/4-inch pipe configuration extension wands.  Pay particular attention to the   
underside of beams, machinery foundations, and deck supports.  Continue the     
wetting/pressure application for approximately 30 minutes and then inspect the  
surface for adequate cleaning.  Severe pits and crevice corrosion may require   
up to two hours of treatment for complete rust removal.                         
                                                                                
        (4) During the cleaning/soaking application phase, the citric acid      
solution run-off will drain and puddle to low pockets.  Using a stripping pump  
and two-inch I.D. chemical hose, pump the run-off back to the rig's mixing      
tank for reapplication in the space.  The on-site chemist will monitor the      
solution concentration and make adjustments to maintain the proper pH of the    
mixture.                                                                        
                                                                                
        (5) At the end of the iron oxide (rust) removal, vacuum solution from   
the surface and return it to the mixing tank as before.                         
                                                                                
        (6) Upon successful completion of the citric acid cleaning step,        
transfer acid solution to the appropriate chemical waste tank/trailer.          
                                                                                
    b.  Passivation                                                             
                                                                                
        (1) Passivate the bare metal exposed by the process to prevent flash    
rusting.  This step must also be used to remove residual citric acid solution   
from the cleaned surfaces.  Observe the safety precaution requirements.         
                                                                                
        (2) Prepare a four percent triethanolamine (TEA) solution at 150        
degrees Fahrenheit plus or minus 5 degrees Fahrenheit in the second 1,000       
gallon mixing tank of the citric acid treatment rig.  Use citric acid to        
adjust the pH to 8 plus or minus 0.1.  Approximate mixing ratio is 40 gallons   
of TEA and 32.5 pounds of citric acid to 1,000 gallons of water.  The on-site   
chemist will direct mixing and adjust the solution concentration and pH.        
                                                                                
        (3) Using the high pressure pump, transfer the heated passivating       
solution through the one-inch I.D. pressure hose to the bilge area.             
                                                                                
        (4) Cautiously apply the hot passivator liberally to areas previously   
cleaned with citric acid, using hydroblast spray gun with nozzles or other      
fabricated 1/4-inch pipe configuration extension wands.                         
                                                                                
        (5) Continue the wetting/cleaning application of the TEA until ensured  
surfaces have complete removal of the dark, gummy citric acid cleaning          
solution residue.  Several batches of the four percent TEA mixture may be       
required for complete cleaning and passivation.                                 
                                                                                
        (6) During the passivation/cleaning phase, the run-off TEA and any      
neutralized citric acid residue is transferred by the stripping pump to the     
appropriate chemical waste tank/trailer.                                        
                                                                                
        (7) The solution pumped to the waste tank/trailer is checked            
periodically by the on-site chemist for acid content to determine the degree    
of citric acid removal being achieved.                                          
                                                                                
    c.  Final Rinse                                                             
                                                                                
        (1) Rinse the bilge bare surfaces with one percent TEA final rinse      
solution.                                                                       
                                                                                
        (2) Prepare a one percent triethanolamine (TEA) rinse solution at 150   
degrees Fahrenheit plus or minus 5 degrees Fahrenheit in the citric acid        
treatment rig's 1,000 gallon mixing tank.  Use citric acid to adjust the final  
pH to 8 plus or minus 0.1.  Approximate mixing ratio is 10 gallons of TEA       
added and mixed with 1,000 gallons of water.  The on-site chemist will direct   
mixing and adjust the concentration and pH of the solution.                     
                                                                                
        (3) Apply the solution liberally in the cleaned space and pump the      
runoff to chemical waste tank/trailer as in the above operation.                
                                                                                
    d.  Preparation for Painting (Cleaning and Drying)                          
                                                                                
        (1) Ensure that sources of liquid contamination to the freshly cleaned  
bilge or tank surfaces are secured as necessary.                                
                                                                                
        (2) Heat and dry the space by the installed dehumidified air at 100     
degrees Fahrenheit, 60 percent or less relative humidity, and approximately     
800 CFM.  Each space shall be maintained at approximately 75 degrees            
Fahrenheit and approximately 35 percent relative humidity to maximize the       
effectiveness of the passivator and to hold the bare steel in the rust-free     
condition.                                                                      
                                                                                
        (3) Completely dry and clean the entire bilge/tank area by suction      
pump, vacuum, and blow down as necessary.  Ensure that residue and debris have  
been completely removed and that the space is ready to be painted.              
                                                                                
NOTE:  Compressed air blown down shall not be performed with pressure above 30  
PSI in areas other than below deck plates.  It shall not be used on             
deteriorated, loose/uncovered insulation material (lagging).  Air lines used    
for blow down must have pressure-reducing equipment (90 to 31 PSI) installed.   
Heated air would increase the rate of drying.                                   
                                                                                
12. Painting                                                                    
                                                                                
    a.  Paint the spaces using the applicable instruction specified.            
                                                                                
    b.  Clean each space to be painted completely free of foreign material      
that will affect the proper application and adherence of paint.

PLANNER'S NOTES:  (1) Delete reference not provided.                            
                  (2) This paragraph is mandatory.  Invoke SI 009-67 for ROH,   
                      COH, EDSRA (for longer availability).  Invoke SI 009-78   
                      for SRA, PMA, DSRA (for shorter availability).            
                  (3) When invoking SI 009-67, insert 45 days in 3.1.1 and 30   
                      days in 3.1.2.   When invoking SI 009-78, insert 30 days  
                      in 3.1.1 and 20 days in 3.1.2.                            
                  (4) Delete 3.1.3 thru 3.2.3 when implementing Standard Item   
                      009-78 in 3.1.                                            
                  (5) Delete Combat Systems Supervisors not required for the    
                      full period of the availability.  In making the           
                      determination of whether a supervisor will be needed      
                      full time, consider that each combat system supervisor    
                      has two basic roles; 1) he must monitor the technical     
                      adequacy of production work and 2) he must coordinate     
                      all testing of his respective combat system.  If the      
                      requirements of the authorized SARP do not indicate that  
                      a particular combat system supervisor is needed for the   
                      full period of the  availability, then the less than      
                      full time requirements of 3.2.2 should be considered.     
                  (6) List those Combat Systems supervisors not already         
                      designated as full time in 3.2.1 and required for less    
                      than full duration of the availability.                   
                  (7) Delete when Work Items are not included in work package.

 personnel safety and to help regulate moisture content level.                  
                                                                                
         3.3.3  The shelter shall not be heated other than naturally by the     
environment.  See 4.1.                                                          
                                                                                
    3.4  The shelter shall have no large expanses of material that will  admit  
direct sunlight such as clear glass and plastic.                                
                                                                                
CHECK POINT  (Site Selection)                                                   
                                                                                
         3.4.1  The site for installing the shelter shall provide good water    
drainage and wind movement.  Slightly sloping firm ground away from             
wind-obstructing buildings and wooded areas is preferred.  The ground should    
preferably be covered with crushed stone, gravel, or other material that        
facilitates drainage and discourages plant growth.                              
                                                                                
                3.4.1.1  Site locations such as drydocks, barges, and hardened  
surface sites (concrete, asphalt, etc.) are acceptable if they provide good     
water drainage and wind movement.                                               
                                                                                
         3.4.2  Maintain the wooden craft's underwater hull components (e.g.,   
planking, keel, stem, and other structural timbers) at an 18 to 20 percent      
moisture content during the time the craft is not waterborne.  See 4.2.         
                                                                                
                3.4.2.1  When hull frames and other underwater structural       
timbers are exposed for long periods of time (more than two weeks) due to       
removals of hull planking, maintain these hull components at the moisture       
content stated in 3.3.6.                                                        
                                                                                
                3.4.2.2  Underwater hull components shall be defined as those   
hull components existing from the bottom of the keel up to two feet above the   
waterline from stem to stern.                                                   
                                                                                
                3.4.2.3  Moisture content of the hull components shall be       
measured by a nondestructive electronic moisture meter operated in accordance   
with manufacturer's instructions, the requirements of ASTM D 2016-74, and       
using Chapter 3 of 2.c for guidance.  See 4.3.                                  
                                                                                
CHECK POINT  (Moisture Content Readings)                                        
                                                                                
                3.4.2.4  Moisture content readings shall be taken every three   
days to ensure that the moisture content requirements of 3.3.6 are maintained.  
                                                                                
                3.4.2.5  Maintain a log and record moisture content readings    
for biweekly review by the SUPERVISOR.  Log shall include each reading taken,   
the time of day taken, and its location on the craft.  Submit four legible      
copies of the log to the SUPERVISOR at the completion of the craft's            
availability.                                                                   
                                                                                
         3.4.3  The following are some techniques for maintaining the required  
moisture content of the craft's hull components.  These techniques may be       
utilized individually or in combination to achieve desired results.             
Methodology is not limited to the following techniques.                         
                                                                                
                3.4.3.1  A sprinkler system around the perimeter of the         
craft's hull within the shelter to wet the hull components down.                
                                                                                
                3.4.3.2  Humidifier(s) within the shelter to maintain the       
relative humidity at a level that would provide the required 18 to 20 percent   
moisture content.                                                               
                                                                                
                3.4.3.3  Drip/trickle type irrigation hoses around the          
perimeter of the craft's hull at the uppermost level stated in 3.3.6.2 to wet   
the hull components down.                                                       
                                                                                
         3.4.4  Prior to accomplishing painting of the craft's underwater hull  
components, discontinue wetting down the hull to allow hull components to dry   
to a moisture content of 15 percent.                                            
                                                                                
                3.4.4.1  Surface dryness requirements of the manufacturer's     
instructions for the utilized paint shall supersede the requirements of 3.3.8   
subject to the SUPERVISOR's approval.                                           
                                                                                
                3.4.4.2  Wetting down of the hull shall resume when the         
applied paint coatings have dried/cured in accordance with the manufacturer's   
instructions subject to the SUPERVISOR's approval.                              
                                                                                
CHECK POINT  (Hull Inspection)                                                  
                                                                                
    3.5  Accomplish a visual inspection of the craft's exterior underwater      
hull five working days prior to undocking.                                      
                                                                                
         3.5.1  Search for, mark, identify, and record areas which may be       
detrimental to the structural and watertight integrity of the craft.            
                                                                                
         3.5.2  Submit four legible copies of a report listing results of the   
inspection to the SUPERVISOR not later than three working days prior to         
undocking the craft.                                                            
                                                                                
    3.6  Remove the protective shelter installed in 3.3 prior to                
floating/undocking the craft.  The SUPERVISOR shall designate when to remove    
the protective shelter.                                                         
                                                                                
4.  NOTES:                                                                      
                                                                                
    4.1  Wood readily dries to around 6 to 8 percent moisture content in a      
heated shelter during the winter.  This can cause serious shrinkage and seam    
opening, as well as checks and possible splitting.  Underwater hull components  
of considerably higher moisture content will be drastically shrunken, which is  
the cause of split keels, stems and sternposts, shaft logs, and other           
underwater hull components of wooden craft stored in heated shelters.           
                                                                                
    4.2  Various wood species shrink or swell at different moisture rates, but  
no wood species shrinks or swells until the moisture content is below 30        
percent (fiber saturation point).  Below 30 percent, the wood swells with an    
increase and shrinks with a decrease in moisture.  During the time that the     
wooden craft is not waterborne and is outfitted with a shelter the craft's      
wood members will shrink to a degree dependent upon the average relative        
humidity at the site during the driest seasons of the year.  It is not          
considered probable that wood hulls will tolerate a relative humidity below 45  
percent without troublesome opening of seams.

         3.3.3  Hydraulic fittings and hoses shall be able to withstand at      
least two times the maximum working pressure of the hydraulic pump unit.        
                                                                                
         3.3.4  Tube stub anchoring device shall have slots in the thrust       
collar or an alternate means of visual verification that the tube stub is not   
being pulled through the tube hole during the pulling operation.                
                                                                                
         3.3.5  Equip the hydraulic tube pulling unit with a remote shut-down   
device.  The shut-down device shall be operated by the tube stub anchoring      
device operator and shall be such that the hydraulic tube pulling unit can be   
operated only when the shut-down device is activated.                           
                                                                                
    3.4  Prepare tube stubs so that at least the following conditions exist     
prior to accomplishing tube stub removal operations.                            
                                                                                
         3.4.1  Cut and remove tubes from the boilers so that a tube stub       
remains.  The length of the remaining tube stub shall not exceed one inch,      
measured from the fireside surface of the tube sheet, and shall not be less     
than 3/16 inch, measured from the fireside of the tube sheet.                   
                                                                                
    3.5  Accomplish hydraulic tube removal using pull-stretch-fail method. The  
pull-stretch-fail method involves anchoring one side of the tube stub and       
pulling the other side of the tube stub with the hydraulic puller unit.  This   
action causes the tube stub to stretch and then ultimately fail.  The           
hydraulic puller entirely removes one of the failed portions from the tube      
seat.  The other failed portion of the tube stub can then be easily removed     
using a backing-out tool.                                                       
                                                                                
                                                                                
         3.5.1  Accomplish hydraulic tube removal using the following primary   
or secondary method.                                                            
                                                                                
                3.5.1.1  Primary hydraulic removal method - install the         
pulling mandrel and hydraulic tube removal puller on the outside or fireside    
of the drum.  Install the tube stub anchoring device on the inside or           
waterside of the drum.                                                          
                                                                                
                3.5.1.2  Secondary hydraulic removal method - install the       
pulling mandrel and hydraulic tube removal puller on the waterside of the       
drum.  Install the tube stub anchoring device on the fireside of the drum.      
                                                                                
         3.5.2  The secondary hydraulic removal method shall be used only when  
the primary method is not possible due to interference of adjacent rows of      
tubes or when any other space restriction prevents the use of the primary       
hydraulic removal method.                                                       
                                                                                
                3.5.2.1  When space restrictions prevent tube removal, using    
the primary and secondary hydraulic removal methods, an alternate method as     
presented in Paragraph 3.4 of 2.b shall be used.

the header, causing pipe and header to heat up.                                 
                                                                                
         3.5.9  Observe tachometer during engine operation.  Verify engine      
speed with hand tachometer or strobotach and compare against installed          
tachometer.  Observe installed tachometer for smooth operation.                 
                                                                                
         3.5.10 During engine run-in, conduct engine overspeed test.  Engine    
overspeed and stop latch assembly must actuate and move the fuel control rod    
to the no fuel position when engine speed reaches            RPM.               
                                                                                
                3.5.10.1 The setting of the overspeed trip speed is             
accomplished by removing (this will lower the trip speed) or increasing (this   
will raise the trip speed) the shim thickness of the shims located under the    
spring located on the overspeed governor.  To change shim thickness, secure     
engine, remove the inspection cover in the upper control end cover, remove the  
fasteners in the overspeed governor weight stop and spring.  Shims are located  
under the spring.  Assemble overspeed governor.  Torque fasteners from 30 to    
35 foot pounds.  Lockwire fasteners in place.  Test engine again.  Repeat as    
required until correct overspeed trip speed is achieved for a minimum of five   
times.                                                                          
                                                                                
         3.5.11 Adjust timing chain and tighten as required until slack         
measurements stabilize.                                                         
                                                                                
         3.5.12 Observe governor operation for smooth performance during        
run-in.  This is indication that governor drive gears are operating correctly.  
                                                                                
         3.5.13 Observe lube oil pressure pump, fresh and salt water pumps for  
proper operation and pressure output during run-in.                             
                                                                                
                3.5.13.1 Observe the pump mounting plate during run-in for oil  
leaks or unusual hot spots.  Acceptable leakage:  NONE.  Acceptable hot spots:  
NONE.                                                                           
                                                                                
                3.5.13.2 Listen for unusual noises or vibration in the area of  
the forward part of the engine during the engine run-in.                        
                                                                                
         3.5.14 Observe engine during operational test run-in for unusual       
noise or vibration coming from the area of the torsional damper.                
                                                                                
         3.5.15 Observe cylinder indicator valves during engine run-in or       
operational period.  Allowable leakage:  NONE.                                  
                                                                                
         3.5.16 With engine operating at idle and warmed up, observe fuel       
injection pumps to ensure control racks are the same.                           
                                                                                
                3.5.16.1 Verify the fuel injection nozzles for proper           
operation by disconnecting fuel injection control rod from fuel control         
linkage and moving the control rack to the full fuel position for no more then  
five seconds.  Engine speed should increase.  After test, reconnect control     
rack to control linkage.  Perform this check on each pump one at a time only.   
                                                                                
         3.5.17 During run-in test, listen for unusual noise coming from        
tappet areas.  Upon completion of run-in test, inspect camshaft and roller for  
correct contact.                                                                
                                                                                
         3.5.18 Perform bearing checks during operational break-in or
