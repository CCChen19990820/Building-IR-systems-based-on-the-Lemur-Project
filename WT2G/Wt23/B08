<a name="3">Subject: PD #175 follow-up</a>

Steve-
     I just finished PD#175 which, as usual, I enjoyed immensely.  I'd like 
to comment about your response to  the Zippo lighter info I included in 
#175.  It is correct that the Zippo does not have an angled flame as do the 
better quality pipe lighters.  Still, I have found it to be quite usable 
with only minimum care being required not to scortch the bowl.  I still 
encourage the readership to acquire a Zippo butane if they are still 
available for the following reasons:  rediculously low price, outstanding 
quality and warranty, and their excellence as a cigar lighter.
     There has been substantial discussion in recent PDs about inexpensive 
humidors.  I probably have the cheapest and ugliest but most effective 
"humidor" around.  First I wet and wring out a paper towel and place it 
inside a sandwich-sized baggie with the top folded back to ensure adequate 
air flow.  Then I place this baggie inside a larger freezer-sized baggie 
with a cedar placeholder from a box of cigars.  This leaves enough room for 
about 20-25 large cigars (7"x50 ring, and maduro if you have a lot of 
class).  Sparing no expense, I have separate humidors for my Honduran, 
Dominican and Mexican cigars.  They are ugly but they work.  I find that I 
only have to redampen the paper towel once every 2-3 months.  So there is an 
effective and inexpensive solution to cigar storage:  it's in the bag!
     BTW, congrats on your PhD.  Where did you study and in which field did 
you specialize?  It is a good feeling to finally get that weight off one's 
shoulders so one can pursue more serious, if not important, (a)vocations 
such as pipe and cigar- related activities.
     Thanks for your continued good work on behalf of the pipe and cigar 
fraternity.

[ You're quite welcome, John! I never meant to put the Zippos down;
they are an excellent buy for cigar smokers. -S. ]

     A quick note to those who wonder what the smoke clouds look like from 
someone in the nuclear weapons business.  Well, unlike the Commander in

Having enjoyed a pipe or two in Dr. Weinstein's company (both at a 
meeting of the Capital Area Pipe Smokers and at John B. Hayes Tobacco), I 
can assure you that the shape of tobacco smoke coming from his pipe is 
definitely that of a mushroom.  The reasons therefor, however, are 
probably classified. :)

By the way, if anyone does come to the CAPS meeting, bring a pipe to 
trade.

<a name="6">Subject: high-minded tyranny</a>

Steve-
Here is an excerpt from an excellent editorial written by Russell Baker (New 
York Times, 31 May 94, pg. A17).  I trust PD members will enjoy this essay 
(Hopefully not butchered by my inadequate typing skills) which is entitled 
"The Danger State":

"    ...There is now talk in Washington about a smoke-free America with new 
laws enforcing prohibitions to save the country from smoke's deadly reach. 
 Doubtless there are smoke-haters eager to hear steel doors clang on 
incorrigible smokers, for this is a real crusade, make no mistake, and the 
true crusader doesn't stop at burning the village, killing the women and 
children and making off with the cattle if that's what it takes to purify 
the world.
     "The crusade against drugs has already filled prison cells with 
harmless people serving ridiculously long mandatory sentences at immense 
expense to the public.  A smoke-prohibition crusade would push us into the 
realms of public-policy silliness even more absurd.
     "What accounts for the present zealotry of the anti-smoking crusade, 
which began for such good purpose?  Part of it may be explained by the 
natural urge of high-minded people to rescue the rest of suffering and 
ignorant humanity from ignorance, squalor, godlessness and evil habits.
     "The missionary impulse of people blessed with higher wisdom can be a 
terrifying force, but why has it focused all this fury on tobacco rather 
than the many other things that are killing us?  Automobiles, guns, food of 
almost every variety--all are killing us, just as surely as cigarettes, but 
for every crusader against each there is a stalwart defender to moderate the 
attack.
     "(Alcohol, of course, is not available.  Crusaders did alcohol. 
 Disaster!  It gave crime a shot in the arm.)
     "Now something very sinister is developing.  Some businesses are 
refusing to hire workers who smoke outside the workplace, on ground that 
smokers' health problems are bad for their employers.
     "This is an illustration of a crusade entering its dangerous stage. 
 Give employers the right to control the habits of their workers outside the 
workplace, and you set the stage for a tyranny even worse than the evils of 
too much government which keep conservatives so alarmed.
     "It would appear proper for conservatives to get concerned about the 
anti-smoking crusade.  What it attacks, after all, is precisely what 
conservatives ought to care about:  the right of those who are disapproved 
of by the high-minded to be left alone."

     It seems to me that PD subscribers shoud write to Baker at the Times to 
share anecdotes that validate his fears.  The man is already sympathetic to 
the discrimination against us.  We should provide whatever grist we can to 
support him.  With the new, less hysterical Congress in session, a 
well-timed article from Baker could possibly focus attention upon the 
excesses of the past and result in a revisitation of the smoking issue.

     I'd like to request that anyone who has a short, simple factsheet 
debunking the myth of second -hand smoke send it to me via e-mail 
(????????@???????.???.???.???) or to my home address (12229-K Pender Creek 
Circle, Fairfax, VA 22033).  I am planning to take on the ban in my office.

     As always, I remain,

     Cordially yours-  John

[ Thanks for the reprint, John, and good luck on your quest! BTW,
Baker's autobiography, "Growing Up," is worth a read too. Personal
note: the article is in my briefcase, waiting to be copied. :-) -S. ]

<a name="7">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #175 -- January 29, 1995</a>

Dear Steve,

I guess I'm a subscriber to the Pipe's Digest, but I haven't seen my name in 
the listing of new members yet.  Not that it matters, it doesn't, I get too 
much e-mail as it is.

You asked for a brief message about myself. I am a 48 year old
physician (Obstetrics and Gynecology).  I live in Las Vegas, Nevada,
and have done so for the past 14 years, originally from Chicago.  I
have been an on again, off again cigar smoker since about 1978.  That
gives me about 17 years.  Recently I began smoking cigars again.
Previously I smoked cigars that I got at Iwan Reis in Chicago.  They
were OK, but nothing spectacular.  My brother-in-law has been a cigar
smoker for many years and travels to Europe a couple of times per
year.  He had turned me on to Davidoff's in the past and once gave me
a box of Montecritso No. 1's that I must confess I did not care for
very well.

Fortunately, my profession has allowed me the luxury of purchasing the
finest cigars.  Since I don't drink alcohol I substitute cigars for
wine, which is the fetish of many of my friends.  Cigars are equally
expensive, to say the least, but less well known amongst my friends.
Actually, since most of my friends are also physicians, I get a good
deal of bullshit about cigar smoking.  The one thing I can tell you is
that anything costing a lot of money seems to generate more respect
than cheaper things.  A cigarette smoker, for example, would be
completely ostracized, but a cigar smoker, although considered stupid
for risking lung cancer would be tolerated because of the expense and
knowledge necessary to be a "good" cigar smoker.  Crazy isn't it?

I love Cubans, I currently have about 40 Hoyo de Monterrey Double
Coronas, 10 Montecristo A's, 3 Cohiba Robustos, 4 Hoyo de Monterrey
Robustos, about 10 Cohiba Lanceros and a couple each of the Ramon
Allones and Partagas (Habana) Robustos in my humidor.  I am really
lucky since my partner gave me a box of Hoyo's for my birthday.  I
also like many of the cigars that people talk about on the 'Net.  I
regularly smoke AVO Piramides, LGC #1 Torpedos, AVO XO Maestosos,
Macanudo Park Lane Cafes, Belinda Cabinets, and Partagas No. 10's.

I am always looking for a new "discovery".  Currently I am interested
in trying some Bode and Moore's, but I am having a hard time getting
them.  I would also like to try the Partagas Limited Reserve, but they
are pretty well backordered.  I have an order in another country for a
box of Montecristo No. 2's and a box of Bolivar Royal Coronas.

I would love to hear what "secret" cigars the other members of the
group enjoy. As for pipes, sorry guys, I haven't gotten into that.  I
do like the smell of pipe tobacco, however.

Enough.

<a name="8">Subject: Slick (OK, cheap) humidor</a>

I got tired of my cigars getting crisp and my tobacco getting stale, so I
embarked on a humidor project. Being of Scots ancestry, I wanted something
inexpensive, but durable. The wood humidors I could afford are too small,
and we tend to run out of shelf and counter space to put them anyway.

It occurred to me that a standard medicine cabinet is a fairly well sealed
box, designed to mount in the wall. I could caulk the corners and the razor
blade slot, figure out how to seal the door, and have a large, more-or-less
hermetically sealed, box that would mount conveniently out of the way.
At our local home improvement (I think the British term is DIY) shop I found
a plastic medicine cabinet for about $35, complete with swing mirror. Thanks
to the miracle of modern manufacture (ie, it was cheapest to mold it in one
piece) the body had no holes to seal.

I picked a spot to mount it, cut a small hole next to the stud (discovered
another stud, cut a small hole next to THAT stud) and checked for anything
(wires, nails, more studs) that'd interfere with mounting it. Using a
sharp knife I cut a neat square hole in the plaster the precise size of
the back of the cabinet, next to the stud. Then I found that the cabinet
body was tapered, and recut the edges of the hole so the cabinet just press
fit, and put a pair of flathead screws through the side into the stud to
hold it firmly.

3/8 inch self-adhesive weatherstripping sealed the door, with careful
placement so the hinges and catch still worked. I found a square bowl
that fit, and filled it with salt and water (from advice on this very
list, a saturated solution of salt maintains ~70% humidity at normal
temperature and pressure). My cheap discount hygrometer is holding rock
steady at ~65%, I have no idea how accurate that is, but it's close 
enough for me. Voila, 23x13x~4" built-in humidor. 

Advantages: 

There are shelves. It's entirely out of the way. It'd hold three or four
boxes of cigars, with careful packing. Larger ones are available, at
higher prices. It's got a mirrored door.

Disadvantages: 

It's not quite as deep as a standard round tin of tobacco, I have to
stand them on edge. It can't sit out on a desk looking lush and inviting
(OTOH, at the price of good cigars, maybe humidors _belong_ hidden behind
doors.) If you don't know precisely where your studs are, you may have to
hang some extra art around the humidor to hide the holes.  It's got a
mirrored door.

Also: Now that I have a humidor wherein to store them, I suspect that my
inventory, and my consumption, of cigars will increase dramatically.

(I'll probably hang art over the door. Are there affordable copies of
any of the "Ce n'est pas un pipe" series?)

From: ?????@??????.??? (Brad Williams)
<a name="10">Subject: Pipe Digest Submission.</a>

Steve,

A few thoughts about pipe smoking have been rattling around my brain
(quite uncomfortable) and so I thought I'd better get them into the public
forum quickly. 

First, a *big* thank you to the maillist.  I am still relatively new to
pipe smoking and I have picked up tips here that have made it an enjoyable
endeavor.  I came to pipe smoking mainly because I found that while cigars
remind people of gangsters, pipes remind people of grandfathers or college
professors - I enjoy cigars, but people (in general) seem more tolerant of
pipe smokers.  A cigar-smoking friend gave me a pipe for Christmas one
year and off I went. 

My early attempts were weak and unfulfilling - I did not have any
experienced pipe smokers to guide me, and so I did a poor job of packing
the pipe and had a lot of trouble keeping it lit.  (You mean you tamp it
down?  Really?) Subsequently, I didn't feel comfortable smoking it at all. 
I probably smoked it about twice a year (gasp!) until recently.  I just
wasn't comfortable with it. 

However, there is a happy ending to this story.  I have gleaned great
wisdom from this mailing list, and now can enjoy a bowl of tobacco without
such feelings of incompetence.  For the last month or so, each Sunday
afternoon has contained an hour of sitting on the back patio listening to
the rain (it's been a wet January in LA) and enjoying my pipe.  My wife,
seeing the amount of pleasure the pipe brings me and the mental health
benefits derived from an hour of down time, is starting to come around -
today, at lunch, she even went so far as to say it might be OK for me to
smoke it (are you sitting down?) *indoors* every now and then.  Needless
to say, I was floored. 

So here I stand, on the threshold of a new hobby.

Firstly, I would like some more information on my pipe - it is a
standard-looking straight pipe, with a black vulcanite stem and a wooden
bowl bearing a "GBD" logo, with "Made in England 7012" engraved in the
side.  Can anyone shed any light on this manufacturer?  I have not seen it
mentioned in the digest.  I am intrigued by the possibilities of owning
several dozen pipes, as some readers seem to, but I don't think I'll be
expanding my collection too terribly quickly.  Nonetheless, it is
something else to look for in those antique shops I seem to find myself in
from time to time. 

Secondly, I am having trouble finding a tobacco that I enjoy, and my local
tobacco place (Cigar Warehouse on Ventura Blvd.), while having an
impressive array of pipes and tobaccos, hasn't been especially helpful in
the selection process.  I currently am working through a pouch of their
cavendish, which, to quote another subscriber (describing Macanudos I
believe), is "like smoking fresh air."  It does have some flavor, but it's
extremely subtle.  The one tobacco that I have smoked that I really liked
was some I purchased when on a business trip through Amsterdam.  I had
heard about a tobacconist's that had been open since the early 1800's so I
went to check it out - the name of the store is P.G.C. Hajenius and it was
very nice - I recommend stopping by if only to see how pleasant the Dutch
can be.  I bought a tin of their house "Black Mixture" and enjoyed it
quite a bit.  It had a bit of an anise smell to it but did not taste like
that at all - that's the only good description I can offer, having little
else to compare it to. Of course, now it's all gone and I am left to
wonder when I will be sent back to Europe on business.  Has anyone else
ever smoked this blend, and if so, can they recommend something similar? 
Or, better yet, know of someplace I can get it? 

Finally, my wife and I have had a couple conversations along the lines of
"It's OK for you to smoke once in a while, but smoking is bad for you." 
Aaack.  Can anyone point me in the direction of printed medical reports
regarding pipe smokers vs. cigarette smokers vs. non-smokers?  I don't
think this is going to become a sticking point (see above remark), but I
wouldn't mind a little third-party printed information to counter with. 

Thanks for any information and/or recommendations in advance!

[ Re GBD, from _The Ultimate Pipe Book_: "The initials stand for the
names of the three 19th century French founders, Ganeval, Bondier, and
Donninger. Founded in Paris in 1850, they began their enterprise by
making meerschaums, the most popular "high grade" of the day. Around
1900 the three founders opened a subsidiary in England to be closer to
the booming briar pipe trade that was starting to use London as a
nucleus. The GBD London subsidiary was operated by the historic
English firm of Oppenheimer. The three partners retired in 1903 but by
then their trademark, the GBD initials surrounded by an oval, was so
well known for quality briar, it has been retained on the stem of all
their pipes to this very day. After WW II the entire GBD factory was
transferred from Paris to Saint-Claude. Today, however, virtually all

With regards to:

[ Thanks, Andrew! From some discussion elsewhere, the spongy styrofoam
stuff that florists use to stick cut flowers in also works well as a
humidifying agent; one could replace the cotton wool with that,
too. -S. ]

The "stuff" is called OASIS (I know, I'm in the business).

Actually, this is the padding inside of the sponge holders on the humidors one
buys and should easily be obtainable from your local florist. Make sure though
that you ask for the type that is used for live flowers and not dried! A block
(size of a housebrick) should cost you around L1/$1.50 max.

Cut it when dry, then simply soak it in water, it holds twice it's own weight,
and hey presto!

        I'm shopping for churchwardens, and my local tobacconist just
doesn't seem to be very enthusiastic about finding some for me.
Understandably, he wants to sell what he has first.  Anyone know of
any mail order outfits that are worth checking into?  I prefer a

mailing list, but I haven't seen that they've offered any
churchwardens.
        And while I'm asking shopping questions, anyone know of good

Hi all,

   First off I hope that this is going to the right e-mail address. In one of
my latest fits of cleaning my hard drive I accidentally erased the file
containing all of the neat how to commands for this list.
   Anyway., I recently purchased a dutch wine pipe that I love. It may seem
like a touristy thing to do, but it really smokes well once you get it lit.
My problem is how do I store the dang thing. It is too big and unstable for
me to trust it to my regular pipe rack. I was hoping someone might either
have the plans for a display box or know where to get one that is ready built
for the job. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

<a name="17">Subject: Pipe mailgroup Introduction</a>

Hello again, Steve.  I'm sending you an introduction of myself for the next
Digest; I assume that it gets channelled through you, since I couldn't find
a group address other than yours.  Let me know if messages should be sent
elsewhere.

     I'm an assistant professor of French at Haverford College in suburban
Philadelphia, live in Philadelphia itself, and am 39 years old.  I am
equally fond of pipes and cigars, but tend to go in cycles:  since it's
hard to smoke a cigar while working at the computer (soggy ends!), I tend
to smoke my pipes more often when I have more work to do.  I'm an opera
lover and have a large collection of CDs; bliss for me is to sit down with
a good cigar and a brandy and listen to an act or so of something.  I am
somewhat of a closet smoker, since none of my close friends smokes and I am
reluctant to impose something they find distasteful on them; the campus
where I work is smoke-free, so I don't really smoke at work either.  One of
the reasons, by the way, that I was delighted to find this group was that I
miss being able to smoke and socialize at the same time, and this is the
next best thing.  (Speaking of which--anyone know of any cigar/pipe clubs
in the Philadelphia area?  I was pleased to know that my local tobacconist,
Holt's, is opening a new store soon with a smoking room in it)  In pipe
tobacco, I favor English types, Balkan Sobranie and some blends which I get
from a tobacconist in Albany, NY, by mail, and I prefer large freehands or
bents; in cigars, I am fond of large maduros (they last for more than an
opera act!) and am currently favoring Arturo Fuentes and Gloria Cubanas,
although I like anything Dominican or Honduran, I've found.  So there you
have it--if you want to know more, just let me know, and I look forward to
participating in the group.

     I guess I do have a cigar question--is the way a cigar burns a
function of the cigar or of the way I smoke it?  Sometimes I can get a
cigar lit perfectly evenly, and then about halfway down it starts burning
more on one side than the other, resulting in a mess of burned wrapper
fragments and filler that burns down inside the wrapper.

     Cheers,

     Duane

<a name="18">Subject: The Cigar Company, Pasadens</a>

Jeff -- Sending this to you with a copy for Steve so that others can learn 
of The Pipe Company.

I did finally get around to visiting The Pipe Company.  Needless to say, I 
forgot to get an address.  But it's located on South Lake Street (the 
300-block I'm pretty sure) in Pasadena.  That's on Lake, about three blocks 
south of Colorado Blvd.  It's across the street from Bullocks in the arcade. 

The Pipe Company is run by Carl, who was quite helpful and more than willing 
to spend time with me.  The store is essentially one large room with most of 
the walls lined with boxes of cigars.  No separate humidor -- the store is, 
in effect, the humidor.  Although I've been smoking cigars for about 30 
years, I'm not much of a connoisseur (sp?), and don't feel qualified to 
judge the quality and/or range of the selections.  But it was enough of a 
range to impress _me_.  I explained to Carl that I'm fond of Churchills.  He 
offered me three, and I chose three of A-Fuente brand ($3.70 each -- $4.00 
with tax).  I've smoked two of them and have been pleased with their flavor. 
 No doubt I'll be buying more of them, as well as trying others of his 
products.  As The Cigar Company is only a block-and-a-half from my office, I 
can walk there, buy a Churchill, and have time to smoke it on my lunch hour. 
 Fewer calories than eating a cheeseburger -- and probably more healthy.

In addition to the walls full of cigars, there are display cases with 
various cigar-related accessories.  And I noticed on one of the display 
cases a stack of flyers advertising a Cigar Event to be held at one of the 
local restaurants.  Dinner, drinks &amp; fine cigars, sponsored by the 
restaurant and various vendors.  I thought it would be fun to attend.  Then 
I saw that the price was $75.00 per person (plus tax &amp; gratuity) and decided 
that such events will have to wait a while.  Perhaps if the IRS ever ceases 
garnishing my wages I can afford such entertainments again.

The Cigar Company only carries cigars.  Carl recommended I try The Tenderbox 
(in the Pasadena Mall) for pipe-related needs.

I hope the above gives a valid picture.

<a name="19">Subject: The Smoker, Tim West, Pipeworks and Wilke</a>

Passed through Albany, NY a couple of weeks ago and stopped in at one of 
my favourite places, The Smoker.  He had just reopened after doing some 
renovations, the most important of which was the building of a big 
humidor, as he wanted to increase his cigar selection.  Unfortunately for 
me, all of his pipes (he specializes in pre-owned) weren't yet moved back 
into the store, so I focused on tobacco rather than pipes while there.  

He blends his own tobaccos, both English and aromatics and has a good 
selection.  He also does mail order.  His English tobaccos are 
excellent.  His "Smoker" blend has a wonderful woodsy aroma that I can't 
seem to get enough of.

His address (which is incomplete in the resource guide) is 136 Washington 
Ave, ALbany, NY 12210.  (518) 462-1302.

In the last digest, someone was asking about Pipeworks and Wilke.  They
still exist; they've kept their workshop and are running their business
from there.  For a while they maintained their workshop as well as a
retail outlet in touristy Manchester Center, VT.  Seems it didn't work
out.  Indeed, whenever I'm in Vermont, I don't get the impression it is
much of a smoking state.  Their mailing address for mail orders is RR1 Box
275, Shaftsbury, VT 05262.  Their phone number was not supposed to change,
so it should still be (800) 832-8309, fax: (802) 375-2401.  (Please update
resource guide) I haven't been there for a while but remember particularly
enjoying their #10 Equinox, a fragrant Turkish/Virginia/Latakia blend,
that really hits the spot, although I tend to find it a bit sharp at the
end of a day. 

My other little discovery while in New York was a pipe shop in downtown
Buffalo.  For the first time I ran into a few Tim West pipes, rather big
and funky freehands, which I instantly fell in love with, especially given
their low price ($48-80).  A true artist's pipe, which smokes beautfully
already and I'm barely at the half-way point of breaking it in (the bowl
is quite tall) and flares out from the bottom and also shoots forward
slightly as it rises.  Something tells me I'm going to want more of these 
:)  Hmm, maybe I'll have to go back to Buffalo to find these again....  
Anyone know if he puts out a catalogue of sorts?

Happy smoking all!  A warm pipe is wonderful during a walk on these cold 
winter nights!

<a name="20">Subject: Pipes Digest #175 -- January 29, 1995</a>

Andy Wallace mentions the Falcon pipe in Digest #175.  Andy should know 
that the Falcon is a copy of the Kirsten.  The Kirsten is the originator of 
the Metal bodied pipe.  It was designed to produce a cool smoke without any 
hubble bubble.  It is a vulcanite stem, a metal body, a plastic end cap 
with a hole which can be turned to prevent any of the moisture from getting 
back into the bowl, and a briar or Mershaum bowl which screws onto the 
metal body.  While you're smoking the moisture condenses in the body and 
does not drain into the bowl of the pipe.  If you need to allow the pipe to 
go out, you turn the plastic cap which locks the moisture out of the bowl.  
You can then put the pipe in your pocket or whatever and when you wish to 
relight it you just turn the cap again.  When empting the pipe the cap 
keeps the moisture in the body and prevent it from turning the bowl sour 
and rancid.

I have two or three bowls for my Kirsten and change them to keep them 
fresh.  It gives a fine smoke without a dottle.  The bowls need little 
breaking in .  I think I can say that it has become my favorite pipe.

I regreat to say that I've just had a bad experience with the Dunhill in
Seattle.  I went in there today and bought a Royal Jamicia Parklane and
thought I'd pick up a tim of 965.  The assitant recomended that instead of
getting the 100 gram tim of 965 for $11.00, that I buy a 8 oz. tin for $15.
I did so and I'm afraid that when I got home and opened it, the tobacco was
quite dry.  I should have known, as they keep the 100 gram tins in the
humidor, the tin he gave me was in a cabinet, without any humidy and was
not hermeticly sealed.  I gather that this is a Lanes mixture and is bulk
packed.  I am going to have to bring it back and let them know that they
must do a better job.  This is sad.  I remember going to the Dunhills in
Chicago back in the early '70s and the wonderful tobacco bar they had.  The
one in Seattle, not only does not have a tobacco bar, but does not allow
smoking in the shop.

In the many years that I've been smoking pipes I've never smoked a tobacco 
like Bengal Slices.  So when I picked up a tin I was a bit put out trying 
to figure out how to prepare it for smoking.  I just try tearing it apart 
and then putting it into the pipe.  If anyone has a proper method, please 
inform me.

Dear Steve,
	As a young smoker (25 years old) I have come to enjoy the Pipes
Digest, especially for some of the tips and pointers concerning pipe care,
smoking habits, and the like.  I have been smoking for about 5 years, but
have never had any formal training on the matter, since I have no older
male relatives who are well-versed in the art, and I have felt a little
embarrassed in tobacco shops.  I sometimes get the sensation that one
should know what one wants and what to do with it when one gets it, so
I have refrained from asking too many questions.  Pipes Digest has been
my own guru in terms of answering some of the long-standing questions
I have had.
	And while I'm on the subject, is there any way for me to
overcome my seemingly irrational phobia of asking too many
questions of Mssrs. Peretti and Erlich?  Is this a common embarrassment 
of younger smokers?
	Keep those issues coming.

		Smoking in peace,

	Also, I would appreciate it if you could send me as many
back issues of the digest as possible.  Thank you!

There is a section on online forums, newsgroups, web pages, etc...
Where to find them and what each one consists of.

Many sections.

Severl people have contributed to the reference guide and I was

For intelligent, moderated discussion of fine tobacco products,
consider joining the good folks of the Bacchus Wine Forum on
Compuserve Information Service.  This group was the first organized
special interest area on the information networks for tobacco lovers
and have been sharing factual contributions for several years.  Our
"smoking room" is not only well ventilated, but a safe place where
people who choose to enjoy good tobacco products can talk about them
in a friendly and intelligent manner akin to the enjoyment of the fine
beverages that we discuss elsewhere in the forum, and that while
tobacco issues can certainly get a thorough, er, airing here, we're at
pains to keep the issues of politics and connoisseurship separate.
The Cigars/Pipes section of the Bacchus Wine Forum hosts Blind Cigar
Tastings (BCT's), On-line Smokers, and features PCCA Digest a weekly
newsletter written by Robert Hamlin.  In addition, there are over 150
library files on all topics of interest to the tobacco connoisseur.
Many industry notables have contributed information to the
Cigars/Pipes section of the Bacchus Wine Forum (directly and
indirectly).  They include: Robert t Hamlin (PCCA), Mike Butera
(Butera Pipes), Richard Di Meola (Consolidated Cigar), Gordon Mott
(Cigar Aficionado), JM Boswell (Boswell Pipes), J.D. Jenkins (SMOKIN'
JOES), Brian Dewey (Lane Limited), Lew Rothman (JR Cigar), Craig
Nelson (Cigar of the Month Club), Brian Hurst (Club Connoisseur), Jack
Ehrmantraut (Edward's), Sid Gottlieb (Cigar Club International) and
others. The Bacchus Wine Forum is a comfortable place to exchange
information regarding tobacco and it has developed a significant
membership of regular participants who have become good friends and
electronic smoking buddies over the years.

I would appreciate ascii text.  If possible, I need it no later than
02-06-95.

In addition the the description on the alt.smokers.pipes I would like
to include information on pipes.  Information that would be good for
the new smoker concerning pipes and pipe tobacco.

What do you think?  Are you up to it?

Waiting the hear form you,

One last item.  The software is free.  It will be available for

<a name="23">Subject: Intro &amp; digest fodder</a>

Steve,

I've been on your digest list for a few weeks now. Really enjoy them. I've 
been remiss in taking the time to tickle the QWERTY keyboard and let you and 
my fellow puffers know a bit about this 55 year old smokestack. (Like most 
smokers, I've been called worse.)

Never been much of a cigarette smoker -- only as a kid behind the barn and 
on airplanes back when you could do that. Started smoking cigars at age 21, 
switched to pipes about 20 years ago -- mainly for economic reasons (was out 
of work at the time and my 7 or 8 cigar a day habit was a tad expensive).

While I've always held a white collar job, I'm sort of a blue collar smoker. 
 Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the best -- I've smoked my share (maybe more) 
of good true Havanas when I worked in or visited Europe -- but for day to 
day smoking pleasure, I enjoy my corncob and my drug store bought Sir Walter 
Raleigh Aromatic.  

I thought I'd be the blight of the list being a corncob man, but sprinkled 
among the tales of treasure hunts for  multi-hundred dollar pipes you get a 
few references to 'em.  Corncobs are cheap (we won't use high falutin' 
language like "inexpensive"), they are easy to break in, they smoke good and 
if you break or lose one, you don't cry for a week about it.  But they are a 
bit difficult to find nowadays -- especially here on the Space Coast of 
Florida.  The tobacco/newsstand at the Melbourne Mall carries them only once 
in a great while and that's the only tobacco shop within at least 30 miles. 
(Remember them though if you come to Melbourne and visit the mall -- inside 
their shop is the absolute only place you can smoke inside the mall. So feel 
to browse and puff!) 

Because of limited local supply, I contacted Missouri Meershaum in 
Washington, MO 63090 and got them to send me a catalog and I ordered some 
direct. They will ship to customers direct if you don't have a local 
supplier. I was going to be a nice guy and give you all the complete 
address, but I'll be darn if I can lay my hands on the darn catalog. (Lesson 
#1: Don't follow your wife's direction to clean up your home office!) 
Anyway, they'll get your letter addressed to just the town -- they're the 
biggest company there.

Have similar problems with my favorite tobacco, but I made friends with the 
sales clerk at the Eckerd's I frequent and she goes the extra mile to 
override their inventory system and keep enough pouches coming in and hid to 
keep me puffing and happy. 

Love the comebacks tag section of the Digest.  I have a habit of knocking 
the fire out of my pipe, entering a store and immediately filling one of the 
pipes in my pocket so I'll be able to light up as soon as I leave.  I often 
use the unlit pipe as an oral pacifier while in the store.  After recently 
getting yelled at about no smoking allowed in the store even though the pipe 
was unlit, I'm now ready and looking forward to using this comeback: "It is 
also illegal to have sex in this store. Just because you have the equipment, 
doesn't mean you're going to use it." (Ahem, does Pipe Digest also have a 
bail bondsman list?)

I was downsized from a Fortune 500 company last August and have been 
unemployed since.  But it hasn't been all bad -- at home I can smoke inside 
and use my computer at the same time!  If any of the puffers out there need 
a good software engineer or would like help setting up web pages or could 
use a dynamite newsletter editor/writer or humor columnist, let me know.  
Have pipes, will travel.  :)

Steve, keep up the good work.

I thought the image was amusing and would be worth sharing. Unfortunately,

are a pipe smoker" or something very similar.  Instead, we see
"Congratulations!" only, along with the caricature of the man contentedly
puffing on his pipe (as I am doing right now) and the woman happily
sniffing the drifting aroma of latakia :).  The image is from a
promotional pamphlet I came across that was put out by Dr. Grabow. 

Next time I get free access to a scanner, I'll scan the whole document it
and upload it.  Hope someone gets a kick out of it like I did...  In the
meantime,

Happy smoking all!

<a name="25">Subject: Smelly Meerschaum</a>

Date: Saturday, February 4, 1995
Time: 11:21 PM

Yesterday I purchased a new pipe... a meerschaum in the form of a lion's
head. As far as meerschaum goes it is in the low end of the spectrum--but
above the drugstore variety--I paid about $65.

I smoked it first thing last night and was quite pleased with it. The only
problem was an off smell coming from the bowl after I was done. This evening
when I entered my room it was the first thing I noticed. Now, normally I
would not worry too much about the smell. I don't spend much time in my
room--it's a place to sleep. However, my parents are rabid anti-smokers. My
mother has complained about the smell of tobacco (un-smoked) permeating the
house--either a gross overstatement or she has an extremely sensitive
sniffer--and at the time of complaint I was still smoking aromatics. If she
will complain about that, she'll definitely complain about this. Bottom line,
I need the smell to go away. Any suggestions? Does the type of tobacco smoked
have anything to do with it? I smoked a strong latakia blend in it. Would,
perhaps, a fragrant matured Virginia do better?

Now, about cleaning meerschaums. I understand that I am not to let a cake
develop. Is this accomplished by rubbing the bowl out with a cloth after each
smoke, or does one wait until there is a very light cake developing and then
remove it somehow?

I gather that it is the beeswax coating on the pipe that will cause the pipe
to turn an amber color. It seems to me that the lion's mane offers a good
opportunity for a nice contrast in colors. If I handle the pipe, touching
only the lions mane, while smoking this will remove the wax from the surface,
but leave the wax in the depths of the lines forming the hair. If the wax
will turn an amber color, what will become of the high points where the wax
has become worn off?

Am I also correct in my understanding that a meerschaum can be smoked as much
as one desires without any negative repercussions? My understanding is that a
meerschaum actually wants to be smoked continuously to develop a nice color.

Hello, all.
   
I did not intend to submit an introductory letter; however, after perusing
past issues I see this is something of a tradition, so here goes:
   
I am a 31 year old male, a US Army officer by trade (Military
Intelligence branch--no oxymoron comments, pliz &lt;g&gt;).  I have a wife, three 
children, a dog, a cat, and a profound addiction to caffeine and nicotine.
I have been a tobacco user since my teen years, and have enjoyed the weed 
in all its many forms.
   
I smoked a pipe while in college--a beautiful clay that cost me half 
a week's wages at the time and has since, sadly, vanished.  I only
recently resumed the habit (largely in an attempt to shake off cigarettes 
and snuff), and was delighted to re-discover the joys of pipe smoking and
its associated rituals.  There are no good tobacconists in my local area,
but, thanks to the Resource Guide, I am eagerly awaiting brochures from 
several firms.  I am looking forward to replacing my lost clay, as well
as trying some of the Dunhill blends about which I have read so much.
   
May your tobacco stay moist, and your matches dry.

Dear Steve -

In #173 I saw a posting from John concerning questions he had on pipe
cleaning.  I sent a response directly to him, but I thought I'd pass a cc.
along to you in case you think it might be worth putting in the next digest.
 I know I'm probably going over old territory, so again I say that whatever
you want to do with it is o.k. by me.  Also - if there's anything there you
think might be worth adding to the "how-to" guide please feel free to add it
in.

Regards,

Steve J. (Briar Man)

P.S.  I contacted Tom Bliley's office a few days ago.  Unfortunately
he doesn't have e-mail (at least not yet - his assistant say's he's
thinking about it).  I do, however have the fax number to his
D.C. office.  It is: (202) 225-0011.  BTW - Linwood Hines of CORPS
says that Mr. Bliley appreciates getting notes from fellow pipe
smokers who like having a friend in congress.  If nothing else, we
should write (or fax) him to show our support for his efforts on
behalf of those want to see their liberties restored.

Dear John:

I saw your posting in Pipes Digest #173, and I thought I'd respond to you
directly concerning your questions on pipe cleaning.  The answers are fairly
straightforward, so here we go.

Concerning the use of pipe cleaners:  A pipe should be cleaned with a pipe
cleaner after every smoke.  First you'll need to remove the stem.  Do this
only after the pipe has cooled down (AT LEAST 1/2 hour after you are finished
smoking it).  If you take a pipe apart when it's still warm the stem will
become loose-fitting, and you may find yourself looking at a lit pipe sitting
on the ground - possibly broken.  Here's how you should remove the stem:
Hold the bowl firmly in one hand.  With the other hand grasp the stem near
the shank (not the mouthpiece end), then turn it counter-clockwise (as though
it had screw threads) as you carefully pull it out.  NEVER yank on the stem,
as this is the best way to break it.  After you've removed the stem run a
pipe cleaner through it once.  Then take the same end of that pipe cleaner
and run it all the way through the draft hole until you see the end come out
into the tobacco chamber.  Move the pipe cleaner in and out while rotating
it, and this will swab out the draft hole.  Be carefull not to ram the end of
the pipe cleaner into the other side of the heel since the will chip away at
the carbon cake, and may actually poke a hole in the wood that could lead to
eventual burn-out.  If you want to be economical you can save the pipe
cleaner and use the other (clean) end for another pipe.  You can also bend
the pipe
cleaner until it's doubled over and use that for cleaning a pipe.

After you've cleaned your pipe put the stem back in by following the above
procedure, except turn the stem clockwise as you carefully push it in.  If
the stem seems very tight when you take it out get a pencil and rub some of
the graphite on the tenon before you put it back in.  The graphite acts as a
dry lubricant, and will save you from cracking shanks and/or breaking stems.
 If the tightness of a stem is a persistant problem, then take a piece of
fine-grit (320 or 400) sandpaper, wrap it around the tenon, and put some
pressure on it as you turn the tenon.  This will take off a little bit of
material on the tenon and make for an easier fit.  But BE CAREFUL to not take
off too much - a few turns with the sandpaper should do it.  After you do
this rub some graphite on the tenon before you put the pipe back together.

You may want to let your pipe rest with a cleaner in it.  If you do so be
sure to put the cleaner all the way through to the bowl, and bend the other
end over the mouthpiece.  There is some debate as to whether or not pipe
cleaners should be left in pipes between smokes. Some authorities (such as
Rick Hacker and Georges Herment) advise against it, while others say you
should do it (I do it myself).  The argument against this practice is that
the cleaner cuts off the air flow through the pipe, which keeps the shank
from drying out completely.  My experience tells me that it all depends on
how often you smoke the pipe.  If you smoke it once a week, or thereabouts,
then Hacker, et al. may be right.  If, however you have a lot of pipes and
smoke a particular one less often, then I think that there is enough time for
the stem to dry out since cotton is an absorbent material.  As for me, I have
so
many pipes that it takes me about a month to go through a rotation of pipes.
 And I've taken out enough pipe cleaners that have turned brown just from
being in a resting pipe to believe that there is indeed some benefit in
following the practice.

Concerning the use of sweeteners:  In my opinion you should avoid all
commercially available sweeteners - I have yet to see one that's any good.
 The best thing to use is a pipe cleaner with one end dipped in pure grain
alcohol (see my entry on pipe reconditioning in the new Pipes Digest, #175).
 The advantage to using the pure stuff is that it is unflavored and contains
much less water than the commercially available pipe sweeteners, making it a 
much more effective cleaning agent.  If you absolutely cannot get any pure
grain alcohol, then Vodka or high-proof rum (like Bacardi 161) would be an
o.k. substitute - still preferable to using a pipe sweetener.  Rule of thumb
on using these cleaning agents is to do so when the draft hole becomes
restricted with a buildup of tars.  You may choose to do it more often, but I
wouldn't do it every time I cleaned a pipe.  If you're inclined to follow my
advice on keeping a pipe cleaner in your pipes you can do the same with a
cleaner dipped in the alcohol.  Just dip one end in, and make sure that end
is going through the shank.  Once again, though, I wouldn't do this every
time I cleaned a pipe.

Concerning the use of reamers:  A pipe should be reamed out when the carbon
cake gets too built-up.  Generally speaking a proper carbon cake should be
thicker at the bottom than the top, thus making the tobacco chamber conical
(tapered).  This is critical to the smoking quality of the pipe.  Most folks
say that the carbon cake should not be allowed to get more than about 1/16"
thick.  Here's my take on it:  I think it's fine for the cake to be from
1/16"
to 1/8" thick at the top.  How thick it is at the bottom depends on the
original shape of the tobacco chamber.  If it started out cylindrical, the
the cake should be thicker at the heel.  If, however it was originally
conical, then the cake will roughly follow the countour of the wall of the
tobacco chamber.

There are a number of reamers on the market.  I myself own a Savinelli pipe
knife and a 9/16"-diameter fluted reamer (I think it's made by GBD, and I
believe they are - or were - made in different sizes).  There is also a
reamer that's adjustable to different sizes.  They're rather expensive (which
is why I don't own one yet), but I hear that they're the best.   Anyway, I
use my fluted reamer most of the time.  What I do is every so often just
eyeball
the inside of my pipes.  When I see the bottom of one getting really caked I
just put in my fluted reamer and turn it as I push down.  I do this until I
get down to the draft hole, but don't go overboard - you don't want to ream
out the bottom of your pipe.  It's also a good idea to do this with your pipe
taken apart since this will allow you to put a pipe cleaner through the shank
to the tobacco chamber, thus clearing the draft hole's entrance into the bowl
so that you can gauge whether or not you've gone down far enough with your
reamer.  Truth is that most of the time I ream a pipe I'm basically just
clearing out the bottom of the bowl - I don't ream out towards the top nearly
as often.  I feel it's better to leave some extra cake than to go too far the
other way and end up reaming down to the bare wood.  Some might think that I
let my pipes get a little too caked up, but fact is that I have never cracked
a bowl and my pipes smoke very well.  So that's my advice, for whatever it's
worth.  The other thing about reaming is that you want the cake to be of a
reasonably even thickness all the way around.  And please do yourself a favor
- NEVER use a pocket knife or penknife for reaming.  I've seen too many
otherwise good pipes that were trashed by an owner who carved the hell out of
'em with a knife!

Now that we've discussed the "manicuring" of the carbon cake, let's look at
the other side - building it up.  This is just as important as the reaming
bit, since it's the cake that gives briar pipes their own distinctive smoking
qualities.  Once again, the experts are divided on whether or not to coat the
tobacco chamber of a new pipe with honey.  I personally think it doesn't hurt
and may even help a little in getting the cake started - as long as you don't
use a lot, just a light coating will do.  Be prepared, however, for the first
few smokes to be wet.  In fact you would do well to keep a few pipe cleaners
by your side so that you can run one through the pipe when condensation
starts burbling up through the shank and stem.  If you can't get the cleaner
all the way through try bending it a little and put it through again.  If
that doesn't work you'll probably have to take the pipe apart (but be sure to
observe the rule about letting it cool down first!).  I've found that tongue
bite is often caused by merely letting the condensed juices get into your
mouth, so bear in mind that the above suggestion is useful whenever you smoke
a pipe.  It also has the advantage of keeping the draft hole from becoming
plugged up by a stray shred or two of tobacco.

The buildup of the carbon cake is further assisted by how you empty out your
pipe.  First, take a pipe tool and loosen up the ash in the bottom of the
bowl.  Then cover the top of the bowl with the palm of your hand.  Now shake
the pipe around, uncover the bowl and tap the side of it with your finger.
 This knocks the loose ash off the sides of the tobacco chamber.  You can
then empty out the ash and knock out the remaining loose ash, but do yourself

another favor - use a cork knocker, not a tree, mantlepiece, concrete
sidewalk, etc.  Using this technique will go a long way in helping you build
up a good cake, and do it all the time - even with your broken-in pipes.  A
word of caution on breaking in new pipes, though:  When you fluff up the ash
do so carefully.  If there's any unburned tobacco adhering to the bottom of
the tobacco chamber you should not disturb it as removing it will tear out
chunks of the fledgling cake, preventing you from developing a good cake at
the heel.

Concerning the black buildup on the top of the bowl:  This usually comes from
residues deposited by the burning tobacco at the top.  Some people mistakenly
refer to this as charring of the wood (although it CAN char if you overfill
your pipe and allow burning shreds of tobacco to sit on the wood).
 Overfilling the pipe can also allow the carbon cake to build up on the top
of the bowl.  In other words - don't overfill the pipe.  I disagree with Mr.
Masticola about chipping away at any excessive buildup with a spatula.  You
run the risk of scraping up the top of the bowl, and the only real way to get
rid of the black stuff is to get the pipe buffed.  Another word of caution
here:  I'm a pipemaker (presently inactive, unfortunately), and I have a lot
of experience with buffing pipes.  Care must be taken to avoid having the
pipe get thrown by the buffing wheel.  The nature of the beast is such that
buffing the top of the bowl carries the greatest risk of throwing the pipe,
which can result in some damage (albeit usually the cosmetic kind).  Bottom
line is that once in awhile is fine, but one should not become obsessed with
keeping the top of the bowl clean all the time.

I'll close with some advise on cleaning meerschaums.  I offer this in the
event that you now, or will sometime in the future get into smoking
meerschaums.  Meerschaum pipes are the exact opposite of briars - they should
NEVER be allowed to build up a carbon cake.  After you smoke one let it cool,
then clean out the stem and shank as per my above instructions (although I
don't leave pipe cleaners in my meerschaums when they'r resting).  Then take
a dry cloth or paper towel and wipe out the ash from the tobacco chamber.
 You will get some buildup, but this is where the Savinelli pipe knife comes
in handy.  I find its edge to be just about right for scraping out the
buildup without damaging the meerschaum in the tobacco chamber - but BE
GENTLE.  I find that I need to do this after about 5 or 6 smokes, so don't do
it every time.  Also, you can use a pipe cleaner dipped in alcohol to clean a
constricted draft hole in a meerschaum, but be judicious and just dip the
very end of the
cleaner.  If you dip it too far you can get alcohol running down the shank,
and this will damage the finish.  If, however, you're nervous about even
trying this you can always use a dry "ream-n-clean" pipe cleaner.

Anyway, I hope all this b.s. helps you out.  Please let me know if you find
any of it useful.

Best Regards,

Steve J. (Briar Man)

<a name="28">Subject: Barney's "Punchbowle", etc.</a>

Dear Steve -

In the last Digest Mr. Hendricks was asking about Barney's "Punchbowle".  And
a timely inquiry it was, since I've been working my way through a tin (in
fact I'm smoking some right now).  "Punchbowle" is basically an Oriental
mixture, with Viriginia, Turkish, Latakia and just a hint of Perique.  It has
a very nice balance between the Latakia and Turkish, with just enough of both
to make for a pleasantly subtle flavor.  If he likes English blends, but
finds mixtures such as Dunhill 965 or Balkan Sobranie 759 a little
overpowering, then he should like this one.  I don't know why they describe
it as being "in full strength", but I think "strength" is a relative term
anyway.  Full strength or not, in this reviewer's humble (ha!) opinion it's a
very pleasant smoke.  Hope that helps you out, Tom!

Spent some time yesterday evening with my friend Joel (??????????@???.???),
and he passed along the '95 Dan Pipe catalogue which he wrote away for after
seeing Joachim Posegga's recent posting.  All is can say is WOW!!!  What an
incredible collection of stuff!!!
The catalogue is just full of pipes, tobaccos and related accessories, all in
living color (plus it's huge - 208 pages in a coffee-table format!).
 Although some of the pipe lines in the catalogue can be found here (such as
Ser Jacopo, Stanwell, Peterson, etc.), they carry a number of Italian lines
which aren't imported in the U.S., as well as some very attractive
German-made pipes.  I've already selected a few pieces I plan on trying to
get as soon as I can scrape together some simoleons.

What really caught my eye was the impressive amount of different tobaccos
they sell, many of which they also apparently make.  Being the perpetual
experimenter in tobaccos, I'm always looking for things which I can't find
here at home.  As I feel inclined to "take the plunge" on their smokeables
there are a few things I need to find out.  First, what about Customs?  I'm
wondering if it's possible to get tobacco shipped from overseas without it
being opened by the U.S. Customs service, and thus getting hit with a bill
for duty (and probably an excise tax bill from State and Federal agencies).
 I'd appreciate hearing from any of you with some experience on this.

The other thing is:  What about the tobaccos themselves?  I understand that
German tobaccos generally don't enjoy a very good reputation over here.  My
experience with 'em is rather limitied - some good and some bad.  I realize
that's true of tobacco eveywhere, but since overseas shipping adds to the
cost, I figured I should get some feedback before I put out my shekels.  I'll
rattle off some names here, and see if any of you have any knowledge of 
these tobacco lines:  "Hamburger Pfeifentabak", "Treasures of Ireland",
"Tordenskjold", Torben Dansk" mixtures, "Olaf Poulsson", "Kaept'n Brammer's",
"Bulldog", "Timm"  KM-xbenhavn mixtures, "Th. Timms Own Blend" series, "Timm
Best Blend" series, "Timm No Name" series, "Holger Danske", "Danske Klub",
and "Peter Rasmussen".

What I'd like to know is how any of this stuff compares with the more
familiar tobaccos (such as Dunhill, Rattray's, etc.) in terms of smoking
quality.  I speak enough German to understand the descriptions, so I know
basically what the blends are.  I'm just curious to know if they smoke as
well as the generally available high-quality tobaccos.  I'm not looking for
detailed analyses, but simply a general overview of what I'd be getting into.
 Certainly price-wise most of their tobaccos seem about on par with the
better tobaccos here (which surprises me - I thought they'd be a lot more
expensive).  Anyway, I welcome input from anyone who can tell me about these
tobaccos.  I'm e-mailing my inquiry about the tobacco quality directly to Mr.
Posegga, but I thought I'd throw it out to all of you in case someone has
anything to say on the subject.  Anyone with information on either the Dan
Pipe tobaccos or my Customs question should e-mail it to me,
????????@???.???.  I'll be most grateful for any responses I get!

To close things off I wanted to let you know that I'm forging ahead with my
EPA article.  I should have it done soon, maybe even in time to get it into
#177.  Keep the faith!  Keep it lit! 
Keep it up!

Best Regards,

Briar Man

Administrative note: A final call on the Big Smoke stickers. On
Tuesday, Feb. 14, I'll be mailing out the ID stickers for the
Washington, DC "Big Smoke." This meeting and demonstration promises to
be a seminal event in cigar history; we hope it will underline to our
leaders that bashing and Prohibition are not acceptable. A lot of
folks from both the alt.smokers.cigars newsgroup and the Pipes
Mailgroup will be in attendance. If you'd like to know what the people
you've been e-puffing with look like, please send me your snailmail
address before Feb. 14, so that we can all recognize each other! (Of
course, if you'd rather come incognito, we can accommodate this too
:-)

Also, we have a few items about the mailgroup's advertising policy
below; please let us know how you feel about it. My intent is, of
course, to keep the Digest like kind of a club; but there's no reason
that the club members shouldn't have timely information that can help
them! 

And now join us, with favorite tobak in hand, as we take up European
geography, angelic accoutrements, (some of) our nation's capital,
Utah, missing persons, sideburns (they're back!), bubinga trees,
telephone directories, the magazine industry, German adjectives, and
bright mutations...

Thank you for adding me to the Pipes Digest subscription list!

I am the Catalog Sales Manager for Georgetown Tobacco in Washington,
DC.  I reciently subscribed to AOL because I was curious about the
extent of the interest and exposure that is devoted to cigars and
pipes on the internet. It was gratifying to see the lively exchange of
tobacco related communication on the AOL message boards and to have
found your news group.

I do not intend to launch an aggressive on line marketing campaign.  I was
more interested in finding out that if someone on line was seeking the type
of service that we (Georgetown Tobacco) offer, they would be able to find us.

I was pleased to find Georgetown Tobacco listed on your resource
guide. There is some information I would like to add to that listing:

toll free:  (800) 345-1459
fax:  (202) 338-0008
E-mail:  ??????@???.???
We currently have three different brochures dedicated to cigars, house
tobaccos and accessories.

I noted that a one time commercial entry to Pipes Digest is available, and
since there was no Pipes Digest issue reference number, I assume that we have
not been listed in the publication.  Georgetown Tobacco's 31st Anniversary
Sale will be coming up in mid March.  I would be interested in announcing
this sale in the near future.

Any advice you could give me regarding placing a commercial listing
--tactfully and within the norms of your group-- would be greatly
appreciated.  If there is any information you need from me, please don't
hesitate to e-mail or call.

Sincerely,
Walter Gorski

to Walt below. -S. ]

Hi, Walter,

Re commercial listing, I would suggest setting up an on-line catalog
as a Web page somewhere, especially if you can scan in the color
pictures of pipes and other articles in your catalog. Don't know
whether aol supports Web pages or not; check with your local sysadmin
(or contact other services that support Web pages) If you put up a Web
page, I'd be glad to put its URL in the Resource Guide.

BTW, I'd recommend _against_ accepting orders by email. It is a good
way for customers to get their credit card numbers stolen, and for you
to get forged orders. I personally never send my credit card number
over the net. Maybe someday, when mail security gets better...

Also, there's a "catalog of catalogs" that you might be able to place
your name on. It has a tobacco category. The URL is <a href="http://catalog.savvy.com.">http://catalog.savvy.com.</a>

Regarding sales, I think a short, tasteful message announcing the sale
would be fine for a Digest submission. After all, the pipe smokers on
the net are looking for a good bargain too! :-) I'll put your message
in the next Digest, and will also post this response.

Smoke in peace,
~\U Steve.

Steve:

Thanks... Enjoying pipe digest....and passing it around the pipe club
(CORPS).  I do this via a disk and a printed version when appropriate.
Thanks for mentioning the CORPS in several of your comments to other
communications.

We have had several inquiries on our phone PIPE LINE, and several positive
comments on AOL.......on the WINE and DINE message boards.

Keep up the good work.

&gt; ...  I'm e-mailing my inquiry about the tobacco quality directly to Mr.
&gt; Posegga, but I thought I'd throw it out to all of you in case someone has
&gt; anything to say on the subject.  Anyone with information on either the Dan
&gt; Pipe tobaccos or my Customs question should e-mail it to me,
&gt; ????????@???.???.  I'll be most grateful for any responses I get!

I did not get the message directly, but saw it in the digest. As my
personal preference is in English mixtures, I am certainly not on expert
when it comes to answering. However, I will try to do my best ...

&gt; The other thing is:  What about the tobaccos themselves?  I
&gt; understand that German tobaccos generally don't enjoy a very good
&gt; reputation over here.

First a short note: likewise to English tobacco, the notion 'German
tobacco' refers to tobacco blended in Germany: there is very little
tobacco grown here and that wee bit that is grown goes into
cigarettes. Thus, we are talking about the quality of blending
tobaccos.

The majority of all tobacco sold in Germany was in fact not been blended
here, but is imported from Denmark or England. My local tobacconist once
estimated that 20% of what he sells is Latakia-based English mixtures
and 60% is Danish. Thus, the average taste of the German pipe smoker (I
am excusing in advance for this generalisation!) is clearly oriented
towards Danish-style aromatics. This is in fact also what I picture as
German tobacco.  I cannot say much more, since I haven't smoked aromatic
tobaccos since quite a while and therefore I cannot compare
them. However, I doubt that products blended in Germany (if they exist)
are much worse than the others, since the competition is strong and
prices do not differ significantly.

As to the tobaccos of Dan Pipe: Dan Pipe is actually a subsidy of a
Danish company with the same name. Their selection is quite different
from what you typically find at German tobacconists. This is probably
necessary for them, since there would be little reason to use their mail
order service, otherwise: tobacconists are quite frequent over here,
and a selection of 50+ tobaccos is standard.

I personally tried two out of Dan Pipe's London mixture series, and was
quite satisfied: both in price and quality it was comparable to the
Dunhill products. However, if you have to pay US tax on top of their
prices, the tins might end up being twice as expensive as Dunhill's
mixtures in the US. I certainly would not pay so much extra for them, at
least not for more than one tin out of curiosity.

If you plan to order pipes, be aware that the pipe will come for being
used with 9mm filters, unless stated explicitly otherwise. In my
experience, it results in wet smoke if you smoke such pipes without any
filters. A good compromise for me is to use Savinelly Balsa filters,
although I clearly prefer filterless pipes. Most handmade pipes offered
by Dan Pipe, however, should in fact be available in filterless versions
upon special request.

Best
	Joachim.

Steve, 
     Just got your Pipes Digest info, wow, had to print it all. This is going
to take a couple of bowl fulls to read through. 
     I prefer pre 70`s Dunhills and any Ashton`s. My tobac of choice, at the
moment, is St. Bruno flake ( yum ). But my mood does change from time to
time. As a rule I prefer to stay away from the aromatics and stick to English
blends.
     Im gonna go now and start reading the digest and cloud the room up. 
     Thanks again and my you wear a smoke ring for a halo.

overcoming "Computerphobia"  These people are the following...

Ken Golner--He's from a small town in New Hampshire...actually, his name is

Regarding ?????@??????.???, who shops at Cigar Warehouse in Sherman Oaks,
but is more interested in pipes.

Try Gus' Smoke Shop, which is further East on Ventura Boulevard and also in
Sherman Oaks. This is a great pipe store. A picture of it is in Hacker's
Pipe book, in fact.

Their house blends are quite good, too. Notable is Jolly Whaler, a 40%
latakia blend (!).  They stock some interesting tinned tobaks, such as Copes
Escudo, the major Dunhill blends, 3 Nuns, and some nice aromatics made by
Stokebye and Erik Larson which are really good. Highly recommended. Their
new and estate pipe selection is very nice, as well. Very high quality.
Great, friendly staff.

Their cigar selection is small and expensive, but decent. You can get
Partagas #10s, for instance, although two cigars I bought there recently
were rather dry and not entirely pleasent.

Last week Kevin Cook noted that he had purchased a Tim West pipe in Buffalo and
noted his interest in receiving a catalog from this pipe maker. Tim has been 
making pipes in Columbus since 1967 and also does pipe repairs.  His address is
1588 Grayling Court, Columbus, Ohio 43235  (614) 761-3465.  I have seen Tim's 
work at craft shows here in Columbus and for a time he had his own shop. 
Recently I purchased a most interesting piece, made of Grecian briar.  It is a
deep needle carved surface (hand carved) in a Canadian shape.  It smokes
exceedingly well.  This line of his runs from about 70 to 125 dollars.  When I
spoke with him at a craft show recently he told me that he enjoys working off
of customer-generated designs. His work has a special character-- a kind of 
American Primitive.  I do not mean by this that it is not expertly crafted but 
that it has an aesthetic feel to it that will remind you of this genre.

[ Thanks, Bob! I have a Tim West original large egg-shaped bent that
he did on special order for me a while back. It's nice work, but I'm
afraid we talked each other into making the tobacco hole impractically
large, so it doesn't really smoke well. Not Tim's fault. -S. ]

<a name="11">Subject: How To Evaluate Fine Tobaccos--Barry Levin</a>

Date: Wednesday, February 8, 1995
Time: 12:29 AM

Perusing through the Winter-Spring 1994 issue of the Pipes Smoker's Ephemeris
I came upon an interesting article sent in by the late Barry Levin. The
article was a guide to evaluating fine tobaccos. It covers the topics of
aroma, appearance, moisture, flavor, burning, and aging.
          
             ---------------------------------------
                  How To Evaluate Fine Tobaccos
             ---------------------------------------

I was having dinner the other night with a respected friend and client,
caught up in a lively discussion about the particular properties of quality
tobaccos. During the conversation, my friend suggested that I share some of
the background of what goes into the development of our tobaccos.

Although I'm what corporate America might label "marketing-driven", I
realized my experiences in developing out products have given me some pretty
intense knowledge of tobacco. I've smoked and sampled thousands of blends,
ranging from the old-time classics to experimental mixtures that never
survived past the first bowlful!

My friend suggested that many, if not most enthusiasts don't have a clear
picture of just what is involved in creating pipe tobacco blends. It occurred
to me that by sharing the process, my experiences could also serve as a guide
to evaluating all tobaccos. I've decided to comment on the key
characteristics that blenders consider critical to developing a harmonious
blend to satisfy all of the senses.

_Aroma_

Ideally, there should be some relationship between the pouch aroma and the
smoking aroma. This is not to suggest that it should smell the same in the
pouch as in the smoke, but the aromas should be consistent; harmonious. There
should not be a shocking discrepancy between what's _expected_ from the smoke
and what is actually delivered.

When smoking the tobacco, we carefully consider the 'nose' off the bowl when
the pipe is warm. We judge the nose when the bowl is warm and not really
putting off smoke. Try it! To gently draw a warm bowl past your nose can be
one of the great and seldom appreciated pleasures of pipe smoking. The aromas
can be so rich and wonderful, adding immense pleasures to the overall aroma.
Not doing this leaves an entire dimensio out of the picture.

With English or Balkan blends (Turkish, Latakia predominant), the aroma will
be delightfully pungent. Virginias will yield a sweet aroma, which comes, in
part, from the caramelizing of the sugars.

_Appearance_

Generally speaking, tobaccos darken with age. It is my opinion that extremely
bright tobaccos tend to smoke hot. Many of these "bright" tobaccos have high
sugar content, but without sufficient curing they will never give up their
sugars to the smoker.

I suppose this is the one reason I'm particularly fond of "stoving" Virginia
tobaccos. Beginning with a golden leaf, the proces of stoving with heat and
pressure accelerates the conversion of starches in the leaf to rich sugars.
The dark color is a combination of caramelizing sugars combining with the
oils in the leaf.

We also look for sugar crystals on the finished product to develop over time
in the tin. We're talking years, here, so you must be patient. Crystalization
is usually a good indicator of advancing age and a well-cured tobacco.

Don't mistake mold for sugar and vice versa! Moldy tobacco will have a
distinct musty odor and the white flecks on the tobacco are powdery. An
examination in sunlight will bring out the sparkle of sugar crystals. It's
best to view all tobaccos in natural sunlight so you can observe the color
and crystal development. A blend's aesthetic appearance is an important added
pleasure. Beautiful colors and contrasts, different cuts and presentations
really enhance the experience.

_Moisture_

This is one of the truly misunderstood aspects of tobacco. A pipe tobacco
with too much moisture will exude this as steam during smoking, making it hot
and irritating to the mouth. Part of this heat is caused by the extra puffing
that must be done to counteract the moisture and keep the tobacco burning.
Your puffing acts like a bellows on a fire--great for a fire, but not for a
pipe.

Overly dry tobacco will tend to crumble to powder when packed in the bowl. It
will burn so quickly that the flavor has no time to develop. What's the best
condition for smoking? Slightly dry, rather than slightly moist is best. The
tobacco should be elastic, but never spongy. If a piece crumbles between your
thumb and forefinger when pressed, it's too dry. If you press a few bits of
the tobacco together and they give, but stick together for only a moment, the
tobacco's just about right.

When you open a tin, you must assess the condition of the tobacco and act
accordingly. Vintage tobaccos in older tins may be dry when opened. There are
many opinions abot the best way to re-humidify dry tobaccos. I feel the best
is to carefully remove the tobacco to a zip-close bag and lightly mist the
tobacco using bottled water. Close the bag and test the tobacco in a few days
for moisture. Continue doing this until it's just right.

Putting dry tobacco in a container with a humidification element seldom
imparts enough moisture to the blend to render it smokeable. Some enthusiasts
say that water should never directly contact dry tobacco because it can
promote mold. My feeling is if mold has already permeated tobacco but isn't
visible, the tobacco is already ruined.

If the tobacco is a bit too moist, spread it on a large plate and let it dry
under your diligent observation. If it has no added humectants, it will
quickly reach the right moisture content in all but the most humid weather
and should be placed back in the tin immediately, if a tight fitting lid is
available. Without a tight-sealing tin, your best bet may be a zip-close bag.

_Flavor_

This is what most people key on when picking a tobacco. It's also the
trickiest element. Flavor is predominantly made up of aroma and these two
aspects are really inseparable. Witness the fact of how little you taste with
a stuffed nose! Chances are if you like the aroma (if it's an uncased
tobacco), you'll like the taste.

Most blends are evaluated based on consistency of smoking qualities from the
first puff to the bottom of the bowl. However, this is somewhat unfair, as
_all_ tobaccos will change substantially during smoking. The tobaccos below
the burning level will collect condensed oils and moisture from above,
concentrating as the tobacco burns down. The key is whether the flavor is
pleasant all the way down--not necessarily the same.

The wetter the tobacco, the more moisture will condense as you smoke, usually
creating an unpleasant flavor. Drier tobaccos tend to smoke cleaner, which is
why a slightly dry tobacco is recommended for smoking. Flavor should be
judged within a band, and neither end should be unpleasant. Most blends have
a "peak zone," which yields the best smoke of the bowl. But you shouldn't
have to endure a foul beginning to get to the good part, nor should you
suffer in order to smoke all the way to the bottom.

_Burning_

Not only will moisture affect burning, but also the density of the cut.
Straight pressed flake will be quite dense and will burn unevenly, which is
why you must either rub it out in your hands or whiz it in a food processor.
A rougher cut will generally burn more slowly than a fine cut, changing the
temperature as well as the flavors that develop. A fine cut tobacco should be
slightly more moist to counteract this tendency to burn hot and fast.

A combination of rough and fine cuts will also affedt the burning rate.
Careful blenders spend a lot of time determining not only the mix of leaf,
but the various cuts utilized. The same tobaccos, cut differently, can taste,
smell and smoke very differently. With pressed flake, you the smoker perform
this function, deciding how fine the final blends will be.

_Aging_

The last aspect I'll cover in this overview is one of the most important.
Leaf is aged before processing to prepare the blend and set the oils and
sugars in the leaf. If the processing is done correctly, the real magic
happens in the tin.

Over years, quality tobaccos will begin to mellow and develop complexities
not found earlier on. The aromas and flavors intensify, and the smoke
softens. This is not a controllable process. Some tins will change only a
little. This is especially true for leaf with lower sugar content, such as
burley or Turkish, which is also the base leaf for Latakia. Virginias tend to
change quite a bit with age.

I find that aging generally takes one of three directions: fruity, musty, or
sour. Sugars intensify, flavors marry, and you often end up with a tobacco
that tastes dramatically different than it did when it was originally tinned.
I have tasted tobaccos that were delicious when tenned 25 years ago and have
become even grander with age.

A fine wine is always good, but it too can improve with years in the bottle.
tHis is also true for tobacco, which is why I recommend cellaring a portion
of your favorite tobaccos. All wine, however, will go bad with too much age
unless it's fortified with alcohol, like port, which can improve for a
century or more. There is less chance, however, that a tobacco will turn bad
after several years--as long as the tin's seal isn't damaged.

Predominantly Virginia blends, if they change at all, will either turn
slightly sour or fruity. English blends with Virginia leaf may turn a bit
fruity, sour or musty with aging, which can yield an interesting complexity.
Chances are, however, if a good natural product is properly tinned, it will
change for the better. There is simply no substitute for aging to achieve the
charactersitics of a fine, old tobacco. Aging is one of the beautiful
mysteries of tobacco cellaring. Seriously aged tobaccos are generally much
darker than when originally tinned and have developed visible sugar crystals.
The aroma from the tin is almost transcendental!

Ultimately, there is one rule of thumb: if you like the tobacco when it's
freshly tined, you'll like it after years of aging. It may be different, but
equally delightful and possibly superior.

        I have been receiving the newsletter for several months now, and I 
     suppose it is time to introduce myself as another reader.  I am 20 
     years old and currently attending Illinois Wesleyan University in 
     Bloomington, Illinois.  I do have a pipe, but tend to smoke cigars 
     more frequently.  Unfortunately, I often have to make a trip into 
     Chicago to either Iwan Reis or Up Down Tobacco to get the good stuff.  
     I tend to frequent Iwan Reis more often because the salesmen are more 
     my type.  However, the atmosphere of Up Down is far better.  Plus, Up 
     Down has Partagas Limited Reserve, a wonderful full flavored cigar.
        Along with the studying that comes along with college, I try to 
     sneak time in here and there to do woodworking.  This is the whole 
     reason I chose to write in.  I have a friend who I am indebted to for 
     all of the favors he has done for me in the past.  I thought it would 
     be a nice gesture to make him a humidor since he has been wanting one 
     for awhile.  I was wondering what kind of wood would be best suited 
     for the moisture retention.  I have seen that the expensive ones in 
     the tobacco shops are made of Rosewood, which is imported from several 
     countries.  However, the humidors I have examined look more like 
     African Rosewood, which is formerly called Bubinga.  If anyone has an 
     idea or suggestion on this, I would be interested to know the 
     specifics.

Steve, I wanted to comment on the good professors' question regarding
"un-evenly" burning cigars.  I am sure that everyone has their own reason for
this phenonema however, a personal observation is that especially with
"larger" cigars, (ie: LGC Maduro Double Corona) I have found that they can
burn un-evenly, but tend to finish well.  Some things that work for me
include: rotating cigars during lighting; turning cigar so that the longer /
slower burning area is on top; and sometimes, even re-lighting the are not
burning well.  As I said these are some of the tricks I use, I am sure there
are other ways, or even better ways, but if it aint broke, .....  

Keep up the good work, and as I am hoping to make D.C., I look foreward to
meeting you.

On Sideburns:

Duane Kight
??????@?????????.???

wrote in the last digest about cigars that burn less than evenly around
their sides.  I've had a lot of cigars that do this, and, in my
contemplative moments, have decided that there are several explanations
for this behavior --

First, cigars burn at different rates.  The center of a cigar,
particularly if one is smoking quickly, will burn slower than the
outside edges, leaving the enber with a characteristic curve.  I'm sure
the physicists among us can explain this better than me.  In a
sideburning cigar, one of the edges had just gotten out of hand. 
Usually, (and if one catches it quick enough) putting the cigar down for
a while will equalize the behavior.  Also, smoking the cigar so the
slower burning edge is at the top of the cigar seems to help in a
just-beginning sideburn.  This is one of the practical advantages to
rotating the cigar in your mouth as you smoke it, rather than clamping
onto one spot for dear life.

Secondly, the way a cigar has been humidified effects the rate and way
it burns.  Anyone who has ever had a soggy cigar will know what I'm
talking about -- besides running the risk of the cigar splitting from
the water inside it, frequently the burn is v. uneven.  If you have a
series of bad cigars from the same bundle (particularly in a brand
you've been previously  happy with) think about equalizing their
humidification. If they're cello wrapped, unwrap them (I find cello
keeps moisture at the edge of the cigar); stick them in a veggie bag or
in your humidor and leave them alone for a couple of days. 

The construction of a cigar has something to do with this, as well.
Large ringed cigars seem to have more trouble with this than smaller
sizes; longer cigars than robustos.  I guess this is just the nature of
the beast -- there is more material, and more surface area to burn
unevenly.  I also have less problem with this occurring with Maduros
then EMS cigars, I have no idea why.  If putting the cigar down isn't
really an option (say you're driving), then (particularly with a big
cigar) I say fire it up -- Relight the cigar with a flamethrower and
burn the end even.  Not particularly elegant, but a lot of fun.  Also,
since you've gone this far, you can just chew on the thing and give up
on your Sean Connery imitation.

Finally, if the sideburn is _really_ bad, put it out and clip it flush. 
This is the advantage, by the way, of having a guillotine or scissor
cutter; you can cut the end straight.

	During this past week I sent out 530 promotional pieces to US

quarterly (printed) newsletter for 10,000 - 25,000 pipe smokers. Aside
from a nominal registration fee, I want the newsletter to go out in

   	The newsletter would contain articles, opinions, interviews,
and lots of other pipe stuff that I believe you would find enjoyable.
It would also contain advertisements for smoke shops and other
retailers.
	I would welcome diversity from other retailers.  I will not
promote porn, but I wouldn't stand on a 'Politically Correct' soap
box.  If you know someone who might be interested, have them give me a
call at (310) 549-0439 or via E-Mail.
	Historically the tobacco industry has done almost nothing to
promote itself on a retail level.  Perhaps the winds have shifted, but
I don't want to count solely on this.  I would appreciate support from
this group.  Bottom line..  If it isn't supported by advertisers (or a
white knight - not likely), it won't happen.

tobacconist and express an opinion.  Thanks!

From: Mark Lathem &lt;???????@??????.???&gt;

I want to offer my sincere thanks to all the contributors to this
mailing list.  I *thought* I was a pipe smoker.  I *thought* pipe
tobacco was something you purchased from quaint little mall shops that
was "colored" with sprayed-on fruit flavorings (rather like a snow cone
&lt;g&gt;).
   
To paraphrase the philosopher, "I now know what I don't know."
   
After reading alt.smokers.pipes for several weeks and subscribing to
this list I decided to try some "English blends."  I placed a phone call
to Craig Tarler of Cornell and Diehl and asked him to send me some
samples.  Craig was very patient in helping me make my selections
and immediately shipped his wares.
   
I have spent the last several days positively enthralled.  I have now
experienced the rich taste of latakia (Who said this stuff stinks?  
the odor is definitely distinctive, but even my wife does not find it
unpleasant.), the piquant bite of perique, and the unequalled pleasure
of smoking pure, unadulterated tobacco that leaves ash in the heel 
instead of a clump of gunk.  I am a complete convert, and Craig is 
definitely on my Christmas card list &lt;g&gt;.
   
I am particularly fond of his #965 mixture, which is apparently similar 
to Dunhill 965.  I do find this to be just a bit heavy for my first 
morning smoke, however.  I was thinking that a blend composed primarily 
of Virginia with some latakia and a hint of perique might be just the 
thing.  I would love to hear some suggestions from more experienced 
smokers.  What is the ideal morning smoke?

Dear Steve:

Thanks much for sending me a cc. of your fax to Tom Bliley - simply
and elegantly expressed.  I would encourage everyone in our group to
do the same, if for nothing else than to say "thanks for the work
you're doing, we're glad to have you where you are".  Of course I'll
be faxing him about much more than that, but we need to show our
support for his work - which is much more of a public service than
anything the anti's have ever done.

My EPA article is almost finished.  The only thing barring its
completion is that it's Saturday p.m., and my friend (and former
roommate) has come over for some weekend carousing.  Work?  Forget it!
BTW - my friend is a fellow pipe &amp; cigar smoker and my computer guru -
I've nicknamed him "Baba ROM DOS".  Anyway, I'll send the article to
you next week.

While we're on the subject I want to relate to you an incident that
happened today.  My friend Jerry Lustig and I were at work this
morning, and we had a little donut-and-coffee break with some
coworkers and our boss.  The subject of smoking came up (I think I
started it), and our boss - who is rabidly anti -became angry about
what Jerry and I had to say about ETS and pipes/cigars vs. cigarettes.
All I will say that he displayed a thin-lipped, snarling autocratic
attitutude that exemplified the "I know I'm right, don't confuse me
with the facts" mentality which pervades the anti-smoking mentality.
Given my prediliction towards the factual approach I did what I always
do - use reasoned argument.  This went over like a lead balloon, with
one coworker actually accusing me of being an "apologist"!  Frankly,
we don't have to take this c**p, and the incident has made me even
more resolved (if such a thing is possible!) to arm my fellow
enthusiasts with as much FACTUAL information as possible.  Naturally
time and resources are a limitation, but there's more to come and all
I can hope is that I make some small contribution to our fight.

Thanks for doing what you're doing.  I appreciate what we have more every
day!  In closing I want to thank Joachim Posegga for giving me much useful
information towards doing some business with Dan Pipe.  You guys are great!!

Best Regards und ruhig Rauchen!

was checking to see if y'all were awake. (Believe that one? :-)
Actually, I just posted the digest before I'd put the sig in. So this

<a name="2">Subject: Antique Humidor</a>

        Hello again, les amis du cigar (y pipe as well);
        I have recently obtained a ?antique? Dunhill humidor, which i am
trying to date.  Surprisingly, the Dunhill shop in NYC was unable to help,
and indeed, once the salesperson realized I was not going to put down 5 large
for a Dunhill humidor, his attitude, was, well, most un-retail.
       At any rate, I was hoping someone might be able to help me get a date
for this find.
       It is a thurl exterior, exterior dimensions 9.25 x 6.25 x 4.25 inches.
 The interior is cedar over what is apparently copper sheeting.  the interior
lid is covered in green felt, and has a detatchable copper tray (for what
reason I do not know).  The plate reads "Alfred Dunhill, London", with a
second line underneath in smaller type, " London, New York, Paris"  The
humidifcation device is a long cylinder of ?tin? about the size of a corona
gorda.  There are multiple holes in it, and the center has "Made in India"
written on in, as well as a US patent.
The humidor has a double post clasp, with a lock
       I hope someone out there can give me an idea.  My best guess right now
is mid 1930's
       Happy smoking to all,

Mark Newman

[ Have you tried writing to Dunhill, Mark? -S. ]

<a name="4">Subject: Pipe Experience</a>

s stated in one my earlier posts, last weekend I went out and
bought a Peterson System pipe, a rustic flat-bottomed bent, #306.
Several days later I eagerly filled the bowl with an English blend from
my local tobacconist and lit up, or tried to.  The draw was
exceedingly tight, I thought.  So I made a second attempt at a charring
light, but still no luck.  Thinking this was due to the
peculiar Peterson bit, I tried once more.  Again nothing.  Completely
baffled, I emptied the uncharred tobacco from the bowl and removed
the stem.  Placing my lips around the bowl I began to blow gently
into the airhole in hopes the obstruction would blow out.
Face turning blue, try as I might, no air appeared to be coming through
the airhole. So, gently, I inserted a pipe cleaner through the shank and
into the airhole only to come to a dead end. This was truly a mystery,
or so it seemed.  Now armed with a flashlight I examined the interior of
the blackened bowl: there was the appearance of an airhole, but it was
difficult to discern, especially with my slight case of anstigmatism.
So again I inserted the pipe cleaner, now fully expecting to see its white
furry end popping through thus putting an end to this whole ordeal.
But once more I came up against a wall.  Slowly it dawned on me, embarassing
as it now may seem to confess: Peterson had neglected to bore the whole
*all* the way through!  Obvious as that now may sound it was truly an
epiphany, a validation that, while I might not be the brightest of
men, my pipe smoking technique was not as ragged as I thought.
It however taught me a valuable lesson: regardless of the pipemaker's
reputation, you should always inspect the obvious.  Moreover, this lesson
can also be applied to home purchases, selecting a financial adviser,
or choosing a mate for life.
 
To follow up, the store that sold me the pipe -- a new place called
Liberson's Gourmet International Tobaccos, located at 10143 Riverside Dr.,
Toluca Lake, CA 91602, (818) 985-4310 -- were extremely apologetic and
told me their distributor would have a replacement for me in two week's
time. In addition they gave me a nifty pipe tool to soothe any bad feelings
I might have had.  The store's manager, Beverly, couldn't have been nicer.

<a name="7">Subject: Introduction</a>

Dear Steve:
     Thanks for your work on the mailgroup.
     Some musings on issues that have come up in the digests I have
read while lurking on Compuserve.
     I remember that someone (possibly you) mentioned a pyrolytic
graphite pipe, I have one somewhere in a sky blue color.  I believe
I bought it from Iwan C. Ries. It's claim to fame was that it did
not impart any taste or properties to the tobacco, and did not
retain any taste from other tobaccos. If you can get your hands on
one, it should be perfect for a tobacco comparison, no breaking in.
My recollection was that it smoked very hot. 
     The best smoking pipes that I have are a saxophone meerschaum
(rarely smoked) that I purchased directly from a source in Turkey,
a long Butz Chacun with a bone stem, an "ice age" pipe (Ridged
finish looks a bit like the Michelin Man) of a kind I have not seen
anywhere, a Japanese briar, some bent Peterson system pipes that
I brought in Ireland and through the Shannon Airport catalog (much
cheaper than buying them in New York), some Falcons and Kirstens,
and a calabash with a block Meerschaum insert. I must have at least
a hundred pipes, and can afford to let them sit for a few weeks
between smokes. My preferences are danish shapes, usually bent. 
     As for tobaccos I have some 18 year old Balkan Sobranie, a few
cans of Craven, and a lot of older McBaren's dark twist.  The
McBaren's may do for those who want a spun tobacco for aesthetic
reasons. It is a lot sweeter, than Escudo, but a good smoke. I
notice that is becoming almost as expensive as Escudo. 25 years ago
I found a tobacco being closed out at Barney's (a discount store in
Brooklyn Heights that still carries some tobacco and pipes) called
Old King Cole. It was a baked, wine cured Cavendish (Black). I
bought up all I could get, and still have about 3/4 of a pound. One
of the mildest, mildly aromatic tobaccos I have ever found.   Have
a lot of pouches and cans of tobacco that were test marketed, but
never got anywhere, or like Craven, were discontinued, all
purchased at Barney's, usually at 3-4 cans or pouches for a dollar.
Back then when something was being discontinued it was sold at a
deep discount. Big difference from what is happening to Escudo.  
     You were right about Captain Black. It's only advantage is
that you can get it anywhere. Just about any Amphora or Sail is
better, Flying Dutchman was one of my favorite cavendishes when I
was younger. The idea of charging $13 US for a pouch of any Captain
Black borders on the criminal. A much better choice would be some
of the Holt's or Georgetown mixtures. 
     The soapy taste of Escudo, which some have complained about,
I have found in a few Irish tobaccos, usually spun or cake form. 
I have a few different, old tins imported by Russell that have this
same taste, and it is noticeable. You can get used to it.  The
taste in Erinmore flake or cake is much more pronounced, but Escudo
does have a hint of it. I once had a can of Bengal Slices that had
this taste, so it may have something to do with storage or some
fermentation that occurs in cake or spun tobacco.    
     When Harker wrote that you clean a clay by throwing it into
the fire, he meant that they are impossible to clean.  The clay is
so porous, that nothing will help when they get sour. You just
throw them away and get a new one. They were so cheap then that
there was no point in wasting time on them. I have a few
churchwardens that I bought many, many years ago and they all smoke
hot and surprisingly wet.  
     The only place I have ever seen Churchwardens for sale by mail
is through Thompson's, and they were not cheap. They are very
fragile. I got the ones I have from Wally Frank when it still had
stores in Manhattan.
     When I first started smoking, I was shown how to clean a pipe
by a Brooklyn tobacconist. His name was H. Geyer,  and his store
was located near Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn.  I still
smoke the pipes I bought from him, seconds with his name on them.

     THE FOLLOWING CAN BE DANGEROUS. IT INVOLVES HOT FLAMMABLE

HELP FROM SOMEONE WHO DOES.

******************************************************************
     He had a small retort setup with a length of rubber tubing.
The pipe was held in a test tube clamp with the tubing connected to
the pipestem. The retort had a solvent (rum or isopropyl alcohol)
which was heated with an alcohol lamp very, very carefully.  The
fluid would bubble up through the stem into the bowl.  When you
removed the flame from the retort, the fluid would be drawn back
into the retort along with most of the tar and other deposits. You
repeated this until the fluid remained clear. This would be done
after using a reamer to reduce the cake. I was able to duplicate
his equipment.  I have tried it and it works very well. Any
chemistry types would have the equipment and knowledge to do this,
but you have to be very careful about the alcohol lamp, the solvent
you are using, the finish on the pipe and the retort. DON'T SET
YOURSELF ON FIRE OR BLOW YOURSELF UP!!!

     I seem to be running on, and wandering, sign of getting old,
not enough oxygen going to the brain, or too much free time. BTW I
am a 45 year old tax attorney, don't smoke in the house or office,
and smoke a pipe or cigar on my 45 minute (each way) commute.  I
have been smoking for over 25 years and have smoked at least 100
commercial brands and at least as many house brands, also many
cigar brands. 

(Please consider whether you want to put the cleaning instructions
onto the list, even with the warning.  I would not want anyone
blowing themselves up or setting anything on fire.)

Happy trails,

Hello Steve!

Thank you so much for your prompt response--I look forward to being apart of
this list.

To tell you a little about myself, I am a student in Southern California and
I have been smoking cigars semi-regularly(sp?) for about a year--my favorite
to date is Hoyo de Monterey, Excalibur #1 (closely tied with #2).  I have
been recently introduced to pleasures of pipe smoking by my grandfather, who
was an advid pipe smoker for more than 3 decades.  I have not had the
opportunity to experiment with any different blends, as my friend gave me 5
ounces of a local blend for Christmas (he also gave me my first pipe--my
grandfather has provided 3 new pipes from his collection [a Lorenzo Imperia,
Sasieni four dot and a Castello] and of course guidance).  I'm sorry I can't
provide more information on the blend, but I'm just not that experienced yet.

Thanks Again!

<a name="12">Subject: pipe making</a>

Dear Steve,
  After receiving the Digest for some time now I thought I would introduce
myself to you and the other subscribers.
  I am 42 years old and have been smoking pipes on and off since I was 15.
 I'm a master engraver by profession (firearms and custom knives).  Other
interests include ham radio (AD5C), sculpture, photography,  and 5-string
banjo.  I'm a member of the Knifemakers Guild and Mensa.  My favorite
tobaccos are Dunhill 965 and C&amp;D's 965 clone (perfect match and $12 a
pound!).
  I recently started making my own briar pipes and am wondering if there are
any Digest subscribers that have similar interests.  My pipes are made of
Grecian and Corsican briar, and the drilling, boring, etc., is done on a
machinist's metal turning lathe.  After turning, a lot of hand filing,
shaping, polishing, and sand blasting is done to create the finished pipe.  I
craft my own tapered drill bits for drilling the tobacco chamber and make
stems from rough castings of Lucite and hard rubber.  I can honestly say that
my pipes are better than 99% of what I see in the tobacco stores.  It is very
satisfying to devote a lot of tedious work to a finely crafted briar, fill it
with 965 and sit back and reap the rewards of a job well done.  
  I would be most interested in corresponding with other folks who make their
own pipes.
  Keep up the excellent job you're doing on the Digest!
                         Warm regards,
                             Sam Alfano

[ Sounds impressive, Sam! I know that there are several other members,
myself included, who have made forays into pipe making, so I'll let them
speak for themselves. I haven't made a pipe for years, but one of these
days, I'll get myself a *real* flex-shaft (as opposed to the Black &amp;
Decker toy I have now) and give it another go. -S. ]

            The Subtleties of Classic Oriental Leaf
            ---------------------------------------

Once upon a time, it was relatively easy for the "average" pipe smoker to
find blends that employed particular varieties of tobacco. Although the
categories of tobacco--Burley, Virginia, Turkish, Latakia, Perique--are few
in number, there are many sub-categories.

The difference between varieties of tobacco is sometimes subtle, but more
often obvious. For example, Turkish leaf has more than two dozen varieties,
each with its own particular flavor and character. I have had the extreme
good fortune of obtaining and sampling a number of the individual tobaccos
used to make up blends.

Xanthi Turkish is distinctly different from Yenidje or Smyrna. Today, for
many reasons, such varieties are lumped together under a generic "Turkish"
label. Of course, if quality tobaccos are used, the combination is delicious.
But the, um, subtleties can be lost.

The subtleties are not only inherent to specific varieties. The same leaf
seed, grown in particular regions will have different characteristics.
Tobacco is strongly influenced by soil, climate and growing conditions.
Anyone who has studied cigar leaf knows this. Cuban seed nurtured in the
Cuba's Vuelta Abajo tastes markedly different from the same seed grown in the
Dominican Republic. Not necessarily better or worse, but different.

The best comparison I can make is to certain spirits, such as cognac or
brandy. Each label has its own character, based on factors such as length of
aging, type of barrels used, processing, and, of course, the varietal grapes
used in the blend. the slightest change in the type of grape used will change
the character of the blend. Such subtleties are lost on the masses, but to
the connoisseur, the difference is like night and day.

The same is true for tobaccos. In some of my reviews, I have discussed how
particular types of Virginia tobaccos--zesty lemon, fragrant orange, sweet
red or rich stoved--affect the character of various Personal Reserve blends.
Barry Levin has taken his obsession with fine varietal tobaccos to another
level, seeking out fine varieties of many types of tobacco.

Frankly, I never thought I would see the day when a tobacco blender would
once again incorporate individual oriental leaf to create exciting new
blends. But the day has arrived, and Barry is the blender.

Finding these specal varietal tobaccos isn't easy, but they are available in
small quantities to the persistent tobacco buyer. Such special varieties are
expensive, but they can be used to create unique blends that the connoisser
will gladly pay for. The same type of person who will pay $150 for a bottle
of the finest cognac is the same kind of person who would gladly pay $100 for
a pound of rare tobacco. Quality, not quantity, is what the connoisseur
seeks.

I have heard many veteran pipe smokers lament the dear departed days when one
could find blends incorporating particular tobaccos. They will pay a king's
ransom for tins of vintage tobaccos with both the age and character they
seek.

I'm not sure how he has done it--Barry is appropriately coy when it comes to
divulging his sources. But the end product tells the whole story: somehow, he
has done it.

Heman Lane, the master of tobacco and founder of Lane Limited, traveled the
world to seek out the most special oriental leaf for his blends. Over the
years, those blends have changed largely because the quality and the
character of the tobacco have changed.

Barry has shared some of his thoughts and observations with me, and I'm
pleased to pass them on to you. I hope that you, like me, will discover some
new facts and obtain greater enjoyment out of your pipe. The following is an
interview with Barry, who to my mind, is one of today's leading experts in
tobacco blend design.

TG:  What trends have you seen in availability of base oriental leaf?

BL:  The subject of oriental tobacco has, over the years, become very    
     muddled. This is mostly because changes in the business have 
     dictated that most small growers in a variety of regions band 
     together in co-operatives, mixing their leaf into homogenized 
     blends.

     As recently as 25 years ago, this was not the case. Individual leaf
           
     types were generally available, affording blenders a great variety  
     of characteristics with which to create their unique blends. Little  
     by little, these distinction became muddied, with even the names of  
     each tobacco becoming confused by taking traditional species' names  
     and broadening their usage. Mixing growing regions, leaf types and  
     mountain areas has further confused the issue.

TG:  I assume someone is growing the individual leaf used to create  
     generic Turkish tobacco. Can you elaborate on some of the  
     individual traits of oriental leaf?

BL:  The five basic areas in which oriental leaf is grown are Turkey,  
     Greece, Macedonia/Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Russia. Today Turkey and  
     Greece represent the prime producing regions. From Greece, we have  
     three basic types of leaf with multiple variations--Basma, Katerini  
     and Bashi Bagli.
 
     Basma tobacco is exclusively Greek, with small leaves and fine  
     veins. It is very sweet and burns extremely well. The major  
     varieties of Basma include Xanthi, Djebel, Mahalla, Djubek, Kavella  
     and Yenidje. Bashi Bagli includes Trebizond, a strong and sweet  
     leaf with little or no aroma. Katerini is Samsoun seed grown in  
     Greece, similar in quality to the Basmas. By the way, when Samsoun  
     seed is grown in Greece it's called Katerini and when grown in  
     Russia, it's called Sukhum.

TG:  I once did an article on Russian tobacco--that country is one of  
     the world's largest tobacco producers, a tradition dating back to  
     Peter the Great. Anyway, back to oriental leaf.

BL:  From Turkey, we have Smyrna, the predominant oriental crop. It's  
     very sweet and lightly aromatic. Samsoun is one of the finest  
     oriental leaves in the world when grown in Turkey's Black Sea area.  
     Baffra, a variety of Samsoun, is more pungent and not quite as  
     refined.
 
     Trebizond is very strong and very aromatic, and is principally used  
     for domestic Turkish consumption. Russia produces its variety of  
     Samsoun seed and it's an extremely prized, hard-to-find oriental.

TG:  I know that Latakia is something of a mystery to people. Can you  
     explain how it's made and what leaf is used?

BL:  When Turkish tobaccos are cured over aromatic smoke, they become  
     Latakia. The woods and herbs used for smoking the leaf have a  
     considerable influence on the ultimate flavor. Through 1960, most  
     Latakia came from Syria, but production was then banned due to the  
     severe depletion of the oak forests that provided the wood.
 
     Most production shifted to Cyprus, an island off Greece. Cyprian  
     Latakia is very fine, but due to the different woods and leaf used,  
     the flavor is very different than Syrian Latakia, as any veteran  
     smoker can tell you.
 
     Most Cyprian Latakia is made from Smyrna seed grown in Cyprus,  
     called Yellow Cyprus, smoked over mountain shrubs, pine trees or  
     myrtle. Since 1960, the Syrian forest have recovered somewhat and  
     Syrian Latakia is once again being produced--in very limited  
     quantities. This is an exciting development indeed.
 
     Syrian Latakia is made from a diffrent leaf called Shekk el bint,  
     and is smoked over oak and herbs. Syrian Latakia is 'woodier' than  
     Cyprian, both because of the smoking methods as well as the leaf  
     type, which is more heavily stemmed. Some smokers also find it  
     sweeter and slightly higher in nicotine content.

TG:  Bottom line--what does all this mean for your product line?

BL:  Simply put, it means that as a limited production, high-end  
     blender, LPI can find these rare and interesting varieties and  
     incorporate them into special blends. We have some incredible new  
     blends planned through 1995. I hope pipe smokers are as excited  
     about this prospect as I am.

From: ???????@??.??????.??? (Viktor Nehring)
<a name="15">Subject: My So-called Tobacco Life</a>

Steve:  
	Thank you for adding me to the list.  I really enjoy the Digest.
As a Federal employee, reading the Digest is the only smoking I can do
inside.  I am 30 year old cigar newbie and a pipe wanna-be-newbie.  I've
gotten some good info from some past issues.  Since newcomers are
encouraged to tell their tobacco-life story, here's mine.
	I've never smoked cigarettes.  My generation was brought up being
told (brainwashed?) that "smoking is bad for you."  Taking this to heart
one day after church, I told one of the elderly folks of the
congregation, "My mother says that you shouldn't smoke, because smoking's
bad for you."  My mother practically fainted.  The kindly old man said,
"You know, you're right.  I won't smoke anymore."  I never saw him smoke
again.  He even went out of his way a few Sundays later to show me his
lack of cigarettes.  (I tend to think, though, that he smoked elsewhere
behind my back when I wasn't looking.)  I was eight years old.
	About eight years later, our pastor (new church cuz we moved) and
his wife had a baby.  He brought cigars to softball practice.  He even
let the young one -- me -- have one.  (It's OK.  We're Protestants :-) .)
I smoked about 1/4 of the ghastly thing and was sick for three days.
Whether or not there was a causal effect, I dunno, but the associative
effect lingered....
	Until Christmas 1993.  We were over at some of the in- laws'
house.  He's a southern gent.  After dinner, he invited me and my brother
outside.  We sat down and he gave us all smokes.  Cheapies.  25 cent-ers.
You know the kind.  So, between a few coughs, we smoked 'em.  Right in
front of God and everybody.  "Honey!"  his wife called, "Are you-all
smoking out there?"  Short pause.  "Yeh," he said, and lit up another.
	I thought this pretty cool.
	So I went out to the local five and dime and perused the tobacco
shelves.  There sure were a lot of cigars to choose from.  Too many.  So
to make it easy, I just chose one of the Dutch Masters packages.  After
all, I could still recall their TV commercial from my youth.  Who says
advertising doesn't work?
	(Digression: Around this time, I started noticing all the
anti-smoking "information" out there.  "Was all of this stuff true," I
wondered?  I better look into it.  Even before I took up cigars, I had
kinda sorta followed the issue.  Rush Limbaugh would bring it up.  Dennis
Prager -- an LA talk show host now with a syndicated TV show -- would
talk about it.  I would half-listen.  After all, who cares if "they" ban
smoking?  I don't smoke.
	Well, now _my_ ox was being gored.  I decided to look into the
issue further. I watched C-Span, read every article I could, and listened
more closely to the radio when the issue came up.  Based upon the
evidence, I concluded that while second hand smoke is not harmless, it
certainly is not as harmful as the EPA wants us to believe, as the FDA
wants us to believe and as nearly every major city now wants us to
believe.  I think I've figured it out the reasoning: When guns and
smoking are outlawed, only outlaws will have smoking guns.)
	I have since moved up a bit.  I subscribed to CA.  I bought
Hacker's book.  I pulled down internet files.  I even smoked a few
cigars!  My favorites so far are Macanudo Prince Philip (well, the
seconds anyway) and Licenciado Toros (I was lucky enough to get a box at
the right time).  I have several Tupperdors and a JR lucite humidor which
works fine.  I've stuffed Onyx, Chevere, Five Star seconds (from JR), and
some other JR cheapies into them.  The Five Star seconds are from the
same company that makes Casa Blanca, Licenciados, etc.  They are pretty
good.  One of them tasted like a pencil, though.  The Onyx are sweet and
look marvelous.  The Chevere taste a lot like Macanudos.  I have one more
contraband stick that I am saving for a special occasion.
	My next project is to make my own humidor.
	I am interested in pipe smoking as this is a bit more aromatic.
And mebbe a bit more dignified.  I bought a corn cob pipe and some
tobacco and have had a few smokes.  It's OK.  I think I need a better
blend and the pipe tool gadget thing.  I am open to suggestions from
Digest readers as to which starter pipe to buy.  (Or if they have a good
starter pipe to sell.)  So, anyone: Feel free to email me.
	Thanks for the opportunity, Steve, and keep up the good 
work.
	And this _is_ the short version. :-)

located in a mall (ick), and while it does carry the obligatory "men's
gift items" (again, ick) it does carry a nice selection of fine pipes
and tobaccos.  They had a good selection of Petersons, Savinellis,
Comoys, etc., and several beautiful Danish freehands.  They also carry
some estate pipes and a good selection of briar churchwardens by various
manufacturers (one of these will be mine soon, I'm sure &lt;g&gt;).  Their
tobacco selection is more than adequate, including most of the famous
factory blends.  They also carry their own house blends (an friend of 
mine swears by "Texas Pride"--"That's what us cowboys smoke," says he).  
They *seem* to have a good cigar selection, but you could put what I

Re: Phone conversation with Craig Tarler of Cornell &amp; Diehl

Last week, I learned through Ray Bromley that Craig Tarler, of Cornell
and Diehl, wanted me to give him a call. He'd been trying to get in
contact with me and hadn't been successful (I'd moved last June, and had
neglected to pass on my new address.) Since he had a lot of interesting
things to say, I'll try to pass them on here.

I apparently caught Craig coming out of the shower, but he was happy to
shoot the breeze. Apparently, he'd wanted to get back issues of the
Digest, and although I'd have been glad to provide them, it turned out
that another member had spared me the trouble! (Thanks, Steve!)

He said, regarding his Dunhill 965 duplicate, that a few customers
thought the original smoked sweeter. This he attributed to glycerol:
"everyone uses it," said he, but his duplicate contained nothing but
tobacco. (As an aside, I wonder if the "soapy" taste in Erinmore Flake
[and other tobaccos] mightn't be due to a heavy dose of glycerol?)

I ordered a pound of vanilla Cavendish, and also wanted a carton of Swan
Vesta matches. Although he was too low on the Vestas to fill that part of
the order, he did send me two boxes -- and also some _large_ samples of
his duplicate 965 and Craven's mixtures! (Both of which I tried the night
I received them; most enjoyable!)

One question I'd been meaning to ask Craig (and the group) was how to
cellar bulk tobacco. I've been buying up tinned tobak, but it's very
expensive doing it that way. I'm looking for a way to buy in bulk and tin
my own. Craig's answer was not encouraging. His best suggestion was to
either freeze it, or bag it in heavy bags, or to use wire-bail jars. He
knew of no economical way to vacuum-seal tobacco, and told me that he'd
lost hundreds of pounds of tobacco to mold in a too-humid garage last
summer. He also repeated that the commercial tinned tobak is preserved
with glycerol; I don't think I'd want to do this. So if any member has
successfully tinned their own tobacco, I'd appreciate hearing about the
methodology!

Also of interest to New Jersey residents: Craig informs me that John
David, an excellent pipe shop which was unceremoniously booted out of
Quakerbridge Mall, is now open for business in Edison! I'll pass along
their address/phone when I can find where the note went. :-)

Craig tells me that he's not currently on the Net (it's a toll call from
where he lives :-( However, he hopes to have access within one month, and
can answer a lot of members' questions when he gets online. I'm looking
forward to it.

BTW, Craig is not paying me to say this (though the bribe of free samples
helped :-) I'm just a satisfied, if irregular, customer.

					Smoke in peace,

Dear Steve -

I have finally completed my article on the EPA, and here it is.  The piece is
a bit longer than I anticipated, so I hope you won't mind what it'll do to
the size of this week's digest.

[ Administrativa deleted; Steve requests that this article be
circulated to other interested parties on the Web and Usenet. -S. ]

You'll notice by my "author's note" there'll be a 2nd article on the
subject.  As I was working on this thing it became obvious that the
issue is way too big for me to have given it adequate coverage in a
single piece.  The other article will look at other stuff pertaining
to the EPA, and will also look at the bigger picture of the
anti-smoking movement.  I'll upload it to you whenever it's done.  BTW
- I'd like to thank Neil Murray for once again giving me the green
light on passing this along to you.  I thought it was especially
gracious for him to do so since he knew that the Digest folk would see
it before it appeared in the A &amp; M Gazette - the publication it was
originally written for.  Neil's a great guy, and I think we're lucky
to have him on our side.

Another BTW - I sent advance copies of this article directly to some of our
Pipes Group members.  The article went through some revisions since then, so
for those of you who got it by individual e-mail please note that there are
changes to what you originally received.  Also - our foreign Digest
subscribers should take an interest in the contents of this piece.  The use
of ETS as a pretext for smoking bans and manipulating public opinion is a worl
dwide phenomenon, and the goings-on over ETS in the U.S. shed light on what's
propelling the anti-smoking agenda everywhere else.

Before I sign off here, I just wanted to let you know the sitch with
Kathy Levin.  My friend Jerry Lustig talked with here about a week ago
&amp; found out that she's moving back to Vermont.  This isn't supposed to
happen until May or June, though, so apparently she's still in
California.  And the good news is that she's NOT quitting the business
- which is great news to me since I only recently discovered how
wonderful her M cClelland Private Label tobaccos are!

Anyway, thanks for giving me the space for my article.  Bis spaeter!

Best Regards,

ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE

Part 1:  EPA on Trial

By Stephen Johnson

Author's note:  When I first thought about writing on the subject of the ETS
controversy I intended to concentrate on the EPA's 1993 report on ETS.  In
the course of my research, however, it became apparent that the content of
the documentary material debunking the ETS myth demanded a broader
examination of the issue.  Two men in particular can be credited with
bringing much important information to light - Congressman Thomas J. Bliley,
Jr. and health researcher Gary Huber, M.D.  Both Rep. Bliley and Dr. Huber
have been highly critical of the EPA report.  Their investigations, however,
have gone far beyond the EPA and into the workings of the anti-smoking
movement itself.  While that aspect of their work is beyond the scope of this
article, it will be covered in the second article of this two-part series on
ETS.                
The history of tobacco is also the history of anti-smoking movements.  While
such crusades are nothing new, the current attempt to create a smoke-free
society relies heavily on an unprecedented strategy.  That strategy has
turned smoking into arguably the most emotionally charged issue in public
health today.  Prior to the 1980s all efforts to curb tobacco use relied on
arguments pertaining to the health risks imposed on the smoker only.  Smokers
today, however, face the effects of a strategic shift towards the molding of
behaviour through a well-orchestrated campaign to alter the attitudes of
society at large. 
The present-day war on smoking has its roots in the first report on smoking an
d health, issued in 1964 by then-Surgeon General Dr. Luther Terry.  While
health activists in the 1960s and '70s became increasingly involved with the
anti-tobacco agenda, they were a small minority with almost no influence on
public policy. Things, however, were about to change.  The current
anti-smoking movement started gaining serious power and momentum with the
appointment of C. Everett Koop as Surgeon General in 1980.  From the
beginning of his tenure Koop made it clear that he would vigorously pursue
the war on tobacco, and the "smoke-free society" agenda became official
government policy.  Under Koop's leadership the anti-smoking movement began
shifting its attention to what has become the most powerful weapon in its
arsenal.

Political Science

In the early 1980s researchers began reporting findings which suggested that
nonsmokers' health is at risk by being exposed to environmental tobacco smoke
(ETS).  Koop quickly seized on these findings and began using ETS to do what
he, and his activist allies had dearly wanted to do for a long time - turn
smoking into an anti-social (and ultimately criminal) activity.   Prior to
the emergence of the ETS issue the anti-smoking movement was faced with the
fact that its efforts to curb tobacco use had largely failed.  Although
smoking declined somewhat after the 1964 Surgeon General's report, many
people still smoked.  Furthermore, the nonsmoking majority was generally
either tolerant or apathetic towards smokers.  The purported threat posed by
ETS, however gave anti-smokers the opportunity to wage an unprecedented war
on smoking by manipulating public sentiment.  The manipulative nature of this
campaign was manifested early on by the labeling of the ETS phenomenon as
"passive smoking".  The drive was on to turn nonsmokers actively against
smoking, and thereby create overwhelming support for government intervention.

Throughout the '80s increasing attention was focused on ETS research.
 Findings which supported the anti-tobacco agenda were highly publicized,
while the public was left in the dark concerning the significant amount of
data which refuted the anti-smokers' claims.  The official stranglehold on
information was further strengthened in 1986 when the National Academy of
Science and the Surgeon General's office issued a report which appeared to
confirm the belief that ETS poses a threat to the health of  nonsmokers.
 This report was a major boost to the anti-smoking cause, which had already
been scoring successes with local smoking bans all across the country.  While
it provided additional impetus to the already growing amount of anti-smoking
legislation on the city and county level, the report also set the stage for
the next major player to become involved in the ETS controversy.

By 1990 the anti-smoking movement had made significant inroads in American
society.  Not only was anti-tobacco legislation on the rise, but public
attitudes towards smoking were becoming more hostile, and a growing number of
businesses were engaged in creating smoke-free workplaces on their own
initiative.  The activists, however, had their eyes on a much bigger
objective - nothing less than intervention by the Federal government in the
ETS "crisis".  In May of 1987 several anti-smoking groups petitioned the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to institute an
emergency temporary standard which would impose a total nationwide ban on
smoking in the workplace.  OSHA denied the petition, stating that
insufficient data existed to justify such a sweeping measure.  Over the next
four years several appeals of this decision were made, the denial of which
frustrated the efforts of those groups in their attempt to bring about the
involvement of OSHA in the pursuit of their agenda.  Less than two years
after the last appeal was denied the anti-smoking movement was to have
greater success with another Federal agency.

On January 7, 1993 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released its
much-awaited report on ETS.  The report was unveiled at a heavily publicized
press conference, an event which had been built up by prior leaks to the
media by the EPA and the Department of Health and Human Services.  The EPA
officially announced that it had classed ETS as a "Group A" (known human)
carcinogen, including an estimate of approximately 3,000 deaths in the U.S.
each year from lung cancer due to ETS.  Almost immediately after the report's
release the EPA came under critical fire by researchers, members of the
press, the Government Accounting Office, and two members of congress -
Representatives John Dingell (D. - Michigan) and Thomas J. Bliley, Jr. (R. -
Virginia).  Criticisms notwithstanding, the EPA report triggered a wave of
smoking bans at all levels of government, and in the private sector, with a
momentum which has continued virtually unabated.  On June 22, 1993 the
tobacco industry filed a lawsuit against the EPA to nullify its report.  The
case has been accepted by the Federal court.  When it is finally heard not
only will the EPA be on trial, but the entire ETS controversy itself -
perhaps the greatest scientific scandal of the twentieth century. 
Fudging Facts

Let us now examine the EPA's report on ETS.  Of the 30 ETS studies cited in
the report 11 were done in the United States, the other 19 having been done
in foreign countries.  Out of the 30 studies only 4 showed a statistically
significant association between ETS and lung cancer in nonsmokers.  Those 4
studies were all done in foreign countries - not one of the U.S. studies
demonstrated any significant risk associated with the exposure of nonsmokers
to ETS.  The EPA has called the research "exhaustive", yet the numbers of
subjects in the studies suggests otherwise.  The smallest study used 19
subjects, the largest used 420, with 23 of the 30 studies using under 100
subjects - hardly "exhaustive" by epidemiological standards.  How, then, did
the EPA manage to come to its conclusion concerning the "Group A" status of
ETS?

The answer to that question takes us to the heart of the ETS issue, for the
flaws in the EPA report mirror the very things which throw the validity of
the anti-smokers' claims about ETS into doubt.  Taken at face value, it would
appear that the weight of the evidence in the EPA report would be against the
argument that ETS is a health risk.  The EPA, however came to its very
different conclusion by using a highly controversial technique called
meta-analysis.  Meta-analysis is basically the pooling of data  for
statistical evaluation.  The inherent problems with this method are that
important variables can be overlooked, and uncertainties increase.  The
uncertainty factor was reflected by the EPA's lowering of the confidence
interval applied to its analysis from the standard 95% to 90% - in effect
doubling the chance of error.  A reading of the actual report is a
mind-boggling exercise in suppositions, assumptions and technical jargon.  By
themselves these things would strongly suggest there is truth to the criticism
 leveled against the EPA that the Agency has fudged the facts to fit a
predetermined conclusion.  There is, however, much more to support the view
that the EPA has engaged in an agenda-driven misuse of science.

In November of 1992 a major ETS study by R. C. Brownson, et al. was
published.  Sponsored in part by the National Cancer Institute, this study is
the largest of its kind, with 689 subjects.  The Brownson study concluded
that there is no statistically significant link between ETS, lung cancer in
nonsmokers and respiratory diseases in children.  The EPA did not include
this study in its report, the excuse being that the data wasn't available in
time for its inclusion in the ETS risk assessment.  Given the significance of
the Brownson study one can only wonder why the EPA was so eager to bring its
work on ETS to a conclusion, rather than allow more time for this new developm
ent.  The answer lies in the Brownson study itself.  The study is so large in
comparison with the other studies used by the EPA that even with their use of
meta-analysis the Brownson data would have invalidated their findings on ETS.
 The failure to include the Brownson study is bad enough, but if one looks at
the ETS studies that were used by the EPA the situation becomes even more
troubling.

There are two problems common to all of the studies cited in the EPA report.
 The first is that these studies were done by having the subjects fill out
questionnaires, producing what is known in research as anecdotal data.
 Unlike clinical trials, which are conducted under strict scientific
procedures, anecdotal studies rely on the truthfulness of the responses
gathered from their participants.  This leaves the ETS studies open to
question:  How many of the nonsmokers in these studies were actually
never-smokers as opposed to former smokers?  Were some of these people
actually smokers who were lying about their status as nonsmokers?  Were the
reports by nonsmoking participants on their exposure to ETS quantified by
measuring exposure levels, or were they subjective responses?  In light of
these questions an examination of the ETS studies cited by the EPA shows the
body of health research on ETS to be remarkably inconsistent, and often
sloppy - illustrating why anecdotal data is viewed as unreliable by most
researchers.

The second problem with the ETS studies cited in the EPA report is that there
are over 20 co-confounding variables significant to the development of lung
cancer.  The problem specifically is that all of the studies failed to take
even half of these variables into account (in fact there has yet to be an ETS
study that includes all significant variables).  Add to this the inherent
problems with the anecdotal nature of these studies, and we are faced with
the irony that there is to date not one ETS study in existence which can be
considered scientifically sound.  This casts serious doubt on the case for
making any causal connections between ETS and lung cancer in nonsmokers, even
in studies which show the risk to be statistically insignificant.  The EPA,
however, has taken a different view, relying on political expedience rather
than good science.  There is another aspect to ETS research which provides fur
ther evidence of this.

A Question of Bias

Scientific integrity depends on a number of things, such as strict adherence
to scientific method, and the neutrality of the researcher.  When the
methodology is faulty, or the researcher has a bias in his/her field of
study, the integrity of the end product is compromised.  Two examples of this
can be found among the studies cited by the EPA, both coming from the pool of
4 studies which showed a statistically significant association between ETS
and lung cancer.

First we'll look at the study which was conducted in Greece by
Trichopoulos, et al. from 1978 to 1980.  The results were published in
'83.  The study was prompted by the fact that Trichopoulos was married
to a smoker. He detested his wife's smoking, and after several
unsuccessful attempts to make her quit he decided he would try again
by proving that ETS is harmful to nonsmokers.
 He and his colleagues conducted their ETS study, which concluded that
there is an increased risk of lung cancer among nonsmokers who are
married to smokers.  What is remarkable about this study is that
Trichopoulos had a decided anti-smoking bias which he revealed even
before the research was done.  This study cannot therefore be regarded
as credible, yet the EPA was willing to include it in its ETS report.

The other study in question was conducted in Japan from 1965 to 1981
by Hirayama, et al.  The Hirayama study was published in '84, and,
like the Trichopoulos study, examined the health effects of ETS on the
nonsmoking spouses of smokers.  The subjects in the Hirayama study
were taken from Tokyo and surrounding areas.  Virtually ignored was
the fact that most of the smokers were "blue collar" workers who lived
in metropolitan Tokyo, whereas the majority of married nonsmoking
couples lived in the suburbs.  Tokyo is infamous for its severe air
pollution, with residents of suburban areas being subjected to much
lower exposure levels than those living in the city proper - a
significant variable that was somehow overlooked by the Hirayama
study.  The EPA relied heavily on this highly controversial study
early in the risk assessment process.  After it received devastating
criticism during a draft review of the EPA report the Hirayama study
was dropped, only to be picked up again for the final version of the
report.  While in comparison with the Trichopoulos study the
possibility of anti-smoking bias is less apparent, there are grounds
to be suspicious - Hirayama has denied repeated requests that he turn
over his raw data for independent evaluation.

The EPA designed a multi-tier system for classifying the source studies
according to their degree of value to the risk assessment process, tier-1
studies ranking highest.  The Trichopoulos study was classed tier-3, the
Hirayama study tier-4.  The rather low ranking of both of these studies
betrays the importance which the EPA placed on them in determining the
carcinogenicity of ETS.  The truth is they should never have been included in
the EPA's risk assessment.  That the EPA not only included them anyway, but
gave them so much weight in determining the outcome of the ETS report,
indicates just how untroubled the Agency was on matters of scientific
honesty.   

Stacking the Deck

While the ETS report itself is sufficient to raise serious concerns
about the EPA's misuse of science, still greater concerns are raised
by the behind-the-scenes machinations which took place during the
review process.  The review was conducted by an ostensibly
"independent" panel known as the Science Advisory Board (SAB).  The
EPA Advisory Committee Charter of November 6, 1987 states: "The EPA
Science Advisory Board is intended to serve as an independent review
body composed of impartial experts from outside the Agency.  Its
function is to ensure Agency accountability and integrity in the use
of science."  The SAB that was finally formed to review the ETS risk
assessment, however was a betrayal of the very spirit of the charter
which created it.

The makeup of the SAB is key to understanding the extent to which it
compromised the concept of independent review.  The SAB panel members were
selected by EPA staff member Dr. Steven Bayard, with assistance from fellow
EPA employees Robert Axelrad and James Repace.  Bayard and Repace are
well-known as anti-smoking activists, and have used their positions within
the EPA to further the anti-smoking agenda.   Their involvement therefore had
a definitely negative impact on the independence of the SAB.  The lack of
balance in the panel is highlighted by the fact that none of the candidates
for the SAB suggested by the tobacco industry were selected, while 3 of 6
candidates suggested by anti-smoking organizations were appointed to the
panel.  One of those selected was Dr. David Burns, a longtime anti-smoking
activist who has professed his commitment to "see smoking behavior disappear
from society."  Besides the 3 above-mentioned appointees there were other
panel members who are on record as having a bias towards the anti-smoking
side of the issue.  The makeup of the SAB demonstrated a clear conflict of
interest which defeated any idea of objectivity.

The alarming situation with the SAB was exacerbated by the fact that
no effort s were made to redress this stacking of the deck in favor of
the anti-smoking position.  The EPA's Administrator at the time,
William Reilly, flip-flopped between making assurances about the SAB
that were never honored and justifying decisions which were contrary
to maintaining objectivity in the review process.  The SAB's chairman,
Dr. Lippmann, while appearing to take a more reasonable position on
ETS, nevertheless made often contradictory public statements, and
seemed primarily concerned with avoiding anything which might appear
as bias towards the tobacco industry.  Under the circumstances it
would have been best to reform the SAB with a new panel, but such a
move was never proposed by the two men who had the authority to check
the abuses taking place.

Board Games

The conduct of the SAB during the review process is characterized by
some remarkable irregularities.  For example, most SAB reviews are
conducted in such a way that a free debate of all opposing scientific
opinions is allowed to take place.  At the first SAB hearing on
December 4-5, 1990, however, things were quite different.  The typical
atmosphere of open discussion had been replaced with a rigid agenda
which allowed anti-smoking representatives twice the time that was
allotted to scientists who were critical of the ETS risk assessment,
some of whom were denied even the chance to speak.  Also, the normal
question-and-answer period was conspicuous by its absence.  Yet in
spite of the one-sided debate which took place, a number of the
panelists expressed reservations concerning the validity of the
science being used.  During the SAB Executive Committee meeting of
April, 1991 it became clear that the panel was uneasy with the
possibility it would have to reject the EPA's risk assessment based on
its evaluations.  Rather than doing what was scientifically proper,
they instead endorsed the "Group A" classification of ETS and
recommended that the EPA staff extrapolate data from active smoking to
strengthen the case against ETS - in effect making the facts fit the
conclusion.  The subversion of scientific integrity by politics was
further demonstrated when the panel not only failed to point out that
the EPA ignored its own Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment, but
also recommended the guidelines be changed because the SAB had
difficulty in applying them to the ETS data.  This "creative" approach
to what should have been a scrupulous scientific evaluation was to
happen again.

The second draft of the EPA risk assessment was issued on June 18,
1992.  The continued political maneuverings within the EPA were
manifested by its efforts in coming up with a document that would more
strongly support the classification of ETS as a "Group A" carcinogen -
efforts made at the behest of the supposedly "independent" SAB.
During the drafting of the first risk assessment the EPA found the
U.S. studies did not support the "Group A" classification of ETS.  It
was therefore decided that all studies would be used, including the
foreign ones, since this yielded the desired result.  During the
preparation of the second draft the EPA reversed its decision and
chose instead to use only the U.S. studies.  There were two reasons
for this.  Firstly, the EPA was faced with a study done in China which
showed that the nonsmoking spouses of smokers actually experienced a
lower risk of lung cancer - hardly the kind of data wanted by the EPA.
Secondly, the EPA had obtained the preliminary data from a large
U.S. study which could be twisted to support its conclusions.  The EPA
also revised its standard of statistical significance, rewriting the
rules to ensure the result.

The second risk assessment contained something else which appeared thanks to
the SAB.  The first risk assessment stated there was no conclusive link
between ETS and respiratory diseases in children.  The second draft, however,
announced for the first time that there was indeed such an association.  This
statement was made without the benefit of any scientific corroboration, as no
new data had appeared on the subject since the first draft was written.  The
SAB was responsible for this move, since it suggested that the EPA
"strengthen" its conclusions concerning the effects of ETS on children.  It
is this aspect of the ETS risk assessment which starkly illustrates just how
willing the EPA was to collaborate in the shameless exploitation of emotions
by the anti-smoking movement.

The SAB reviewed the second risk assessment, allowing only 2 days for
a public hearing (the hearings took place on July 21-22, 1992) and
refusing requests for a longer public-comment period.  The SAB
approved the risk assessment in October, while admitting the
extrapolation of active smoking data would not be useful in
establishing the "Group A" classification of ETS.  Now that the review
process was complete the EPA made haste to do a final revision on its
ETS risk assessment.  During this final revision the foreign ETS
studies mysteriously crept back in, a final act of legerdemain before
the official release of the EPA document to the public.  The EPA's
report on ETS shows a clear disregard for the principles of good
science.  If the SAB had done the job it was supposed to, it would
have killed the risk assessment long before it could have gotten as
far as publication.  The SAB's conduct during the review process,
however was defined by activities which demonstrated that it was
merely going through the motions to satisfy the EPA's need to appear
as though the Agency acted with propriety in making its ETS risk
assessment.  On January 7, 1993 the public was presented not with the
result of careful research and independent scrutiny , but a document
which was the culmination of efforts by both the EPA and SAB to put a
veneer of scientific credibility over a blatant abuse of authority for
the purpose of advancing the anti-smoking cause.

Speaking Out

Immediately upon its release the EPA report was hailed by anti-smoking
activists as a watershed event in their fight to create a smoke-free society.
 The media was all too willing to do their part by giving the report wide
publicity.  The media's perspective is largely favorable to the anti-smoking
position, and aside from dissent by some members of the press, the coverage
has been predictably one-sided.  As a consequence of this collusive informatio
nal bias the public has been kept from knowing of the extensive evidence
which debunks the ETS myth.  This situation may, however, change soon - and
if it does, it will be thanks in great measure to the efforts of one man.
Although criticism from the media has been sparse, such is not the case with
a certain member of  Congress who has been concerned with the EPA's work on
ETS since it first began.  At the time of the EPA report's release Thomas J.
Bliley, Jr. was the ranking Republican minority member of the House Health
and Environment Subcommittee.  On July 21, 1993 Congressman Bliley made a
statement before the Subcommittee concerning the EPA ands its risk assessment
of ETS.  Attached to this statement was a 67-page report of his
investigations into the EPA's involvement in the ETS controversy.

Rep. Bliley's report is most revealing, and is a credible, well-documented
indictment not only of the EPA, but also the extent to which anti-smoking
activism has gained power through the government.  Besides the matter of how
science was misused by the EPA and SAB, the report provides details of
serious contracting improprieties, as well as a history of the EPA's work
leading up to the ETS risk assessment.  The report also furnishes important
facts pertaining to professional anti-smoking activists who have pursued
their agenda either through their positions in the EPA, or with the help of
allies within the Agency.  Most, if not all of this information is unknown to
the general public.

Competent criticism of the goings-on over ETS has also come from the world of
health research.  The controversy regarding the EPA report has brought to the
forefront two sources of such criticism who are worthy of note.   Dr. Alvan
Feinstein of Yale University Medical School is one of the world's leading
epidemiologists.  Dr. Feinstein has written on the questionable science
behind the official risk assessment of ETS, and his comments have also
extended his criticism to the entrenched anti-smoking bias within the public
health community.  His position on the ETS debate is a matter of public
record, and his observations have been featured in newspaper articles.  

The other critic, who is worthy of note, is Gary Huber, M.D., a professor of
medicine at the University of Texas Medical Center at Tyler.  He has written
extensively on the subject of ETS, and his own research seriously challenges
the assertions which the anti-smoking activists constantly present as "fact".
Dr. Huber and colleagues Robert E. Brockie, M.D. and Vijay K. Mahajan, M.D.
wrote an article on this research which appeared in the July, 1991 issue of
Consumers' Research magazine.  Soon after the release of the EPA report the
authors revisited the subject in an article published in the technical
journal Regulation, this time placing a critique of the EPA's risk assessment
within the larger context of their findings concerning ETS.  In December,
1994 Dr. Huber gave a presentation before the Cato Institute in which he
discussed the scientific and political aspects of the ETS issue, including
the role played by the EPA in advancing the anti-smoking agenda.  While this
presentation was remarkable enough for being in a public forum, what made it
more so were the startling revelations made by Dr. Huber concerning the use
of ETS in the formulation of a social engineering strategy before research
results had even been published.  The Cato Institute presentation was
broadcast in its entirety on C-SPAN, although the significance of the event
went unnoticed by the news media.

In spite of the increasing amount and quality of criticism that has been
leveled at the EPA, the Agency has steadfastly refused to so much as consider
re-evaluating its ETS risk assessment.  When Carol Browner replaced William
Reilly as EPA Administrator in 1993 she made it clear she would actively
support the Agency's role in promoting the anti-smoking cause.  This
recalcitrant attitude may, however have serious consequences for both the EPA
and the anti-smoking movement.  The general election of November 8, 1994
swept the Republicans into power in both Houses of Congress.  Among the
re-elected Republicans was Thomas J. Bliley, Jr., who assumed the
chairmanship of the House Commerce and Energy Committee - which includes the
Health and Environment Subcommittee.  The subcommittee chairman at the time
of Rep. Bliley's 1993 report to Congress was Henry Waxman (D. - Los Angeles),
a dedicated anti-smoking activist who effectively blocked all of Bliley's
efforts to initiate a Congressional investigation of the EPA.  Now that
Waxman has been replaced by the very man who so vigorously opposed his
crusade, the EPA faces the prospect of being targeted for Congressional
action.

Indeed, the events of November 8, 1994 do not bode well for the anti-smoking
movement.  The examinations of the ETS controversy by Bliley and Huber have
one thing in common - they demonstrate that scrutiny of the EPA's work on ETS
leads inevitably to discoveries concerning the essentially irrational nature
of anti-smoking activism.  Earlier in this article it was mentioned that the
public has been subjected to a one-sided barrage of information on ETS, and
that the situation may change soon.  Certainly a Congressional investigation
of the EPA would bring this about, and it is quite likely Congress will take
action under the capable leadership of Rep. Bliley. It also stands to reason
that the work of professionals like Dr. Huber will be drawn upon - and be
given public exposure - in the process.  The anti-smoking movement has good
reason to fear such a scenario.  Regardless of personal feelings about
smoking, the fact is that people resent being manipulated.  If the full truth
about the ETS scare is ever allowed to come out, then the anti-smoking
activists run the very real risk that the anger they have sought to create
will instead turn back on them, a defeat which could ultimately bring down
their smoking policy empire.

[ Steve, thanks so much for taking on this piece of research and writing.
Fascinating reading, and an eye opener!

Regardless of who's in Congress, though, I see no reason to assume that
the antis will roll over and play dead. They are still there, and they
have not changed their opinions. Members, please stay informed, and stay

Administrative note: Last week's Digest (#178) was a test of the
membership's ability to catch moderator booboos. Hey, that's the
ticket... :-) It was sent out with the correct date, etc. but with the
title "Pipes Digest #177." Let's see if I can avoid silly blunders
this week, and make only intelligent, creative ones :-)

Also, I heard of a new San Francisco Cigar Club last week; more info
later. Bay Area members, please stay tuned!

And join us now, in the last Digest before the March 1 Big Smoke, as
we light up our favorites and plumb the depths of cellars (hot and
cold), aging (hey, we all gotta do it sometime!), brokers (and
brokees), contract law, German grammar (weiter), imaging technology,
politics, the Marine Corps, mega-crystals, and suffrage...

Introduction: Thank you for including me in the mail group. I own a an old
fasioned department store in Plymouth, MA. When I purchased the store four
years ago there was an old cigar humidor. The store had a history of selling
cigars and pipes, but not products of high quality. I hired a person that was
very familiar with cigars and gave him the go ahead to establish a first
quality tobacco department. As kuck would have it, this happened at the
beginning of the cigar boom and it has become a very profitable department.
Since the beginnings of this department four years ago we have built a
walk-in cigar humidor and have become a Dunhill Pipe Dealer.
  I have smoked pipes, but not with regularity. I enjoy cigars, my favorites
are Monte Cristos which I purchase in Bermuda. My favorite legal cigars are
Dunhills from the Dominican Republic.
  The number of pipe smokers seems to have dwindled significantly. We seem to
sell a lot of $50-$80 Parkers etc., but very few Dunhills. This is probably
due to our location in Plymouth, MA which is a blue collar town.
  Being in Plymouth allows us to discuss smoking with people from all over
the world. Many British and French purchase cigars from us because our taxes
are cheap compared to theirs.
  I did not join the group to promote my business. I am fascinated with the
subject and look forward to contributing.
  I hope to here from you.  Sincerely yours,
                                       ??????????@???.???

Steve:

Just read your Digest #177 after it was posted on Compuserve, and I thought I
might be able to help you with your long term tobacco storage problem. First,
this problem of holding tobacco long term and mold have very little, if
anything, to do with a humidity factor being too high. The fact is that when
tobacco is manufactured into the final product the process runs from hogsheads
at 8% to 12% moisture to almost 100% during the processing of both cased
aromatics and stoved virginias. 

I have personally seen bulk tobacco being processed at Universal Leaf
in Petersburg, Virginia and in the Lane Limited operation with bulk
BCA black cavendish (and Captain Black). Many bulk aromatics, such as
BCA or RPL-6 are shipped with a very high moisture content, and yet no
mold problem. Glycerin &amp; glycol are used in tobacco production,
especially the drug store type, but there are many high grade tobaccos
that do not use these products as either perservatives or leaf
softeners.

A perfect example would be McClelland Tobacco Company, who makes many
bulk aromatics, bulk flakes, very high grade limited edition blends
and of course their Personal Reserve Trademarked Line (That Barry
marketed for McClelland).  McClelland does not use Glycerin or Glycol
and yet I've never seen mold on any McClelland product, be it bulk or
tin.

You will get mold in tobacco if you combine reasonable moisture and
high heat storage. This is the key to long term storage of any
tobacco, including tin products. Regular long term storage conditions
should hold the tobacco at 70 degrees or under. Bulk tobacco will grow
mold faster if stored in high heat, but I've seen lots of tins from
quality manufacturers such a A&amp;C Peterson of Denmark, Balkan Sobranie,
Escudo, etc that are full of mold when opened. Keep the tobacco cool
and it will last 10 or 20 years, even in bulk. Storing tobacco in a
garage in the Summer is begging for ruin - it can get well over 100
degrees in a garage in the Summer, at least in Virginia.

If you want to store bulk tobacco for 10+ years all you have to do is
compress it into "snap lid" jars like canning jars. Glass id better
than plastic, but plastic will do. Coffee shops sell these jars, as do
a lot of kitchen stores.  Even plastic tupperware/rubbermade
containers will work as long as the seal is tight (you can always tape
the lids down). Pack them as tight as possible, keep them cool and
you'll have no problem with mold.

My unfinished basement runs 55-58 degress in the Winter and 62-64
degrees in the heat of the Summer. I store 100 to 300 pounds of Bulk
tobacco and 1,000 to 5,000 tins of tobacco on open shelves with no
mold problem at all. Some of these tins are 5-7 years old and I have
had bulk on had for 4-5 years - no problem at all.  I also store over
1,500 cigars and over 250 bottles of wine, again - perfect conditions,
perfect results.

Long term aging of quality tobacco is something that [...] I worked on
in great detail, both in development of new products and in the study
of the changes that take place over time. I wrote a series of articles
in 1991-92 on tobacco again (calling it cellaring) for The Smoker's
Pipeline Newsletter. The condensed version is in the CIS Smoking
Section LIB, but I'll be glad to post it to you if you like.

[...]

This note is not designed to be included in your Digest, but more so
to be a point of information to your question of long term tobacco
storage. [...] Lest you think my ego is getting out of control here,
I'll cut it off - but hope this helps you out with long term tobacco
storage.

Best regards,

-Bob

[ Later... ]

&gt;&gt;P.S. Do you know of a way to seal tobacco in a Ball jar? The normal
method for canning in them is to boil them; this both creates a
partial vacuum and softens the rubber ring around the jar lid. I'd
think this would ruin the tobacco, though. -S.&lt;&lt;

Do not use the standard "canning jars" but use those that have the
"lever snap lid" like Mason jars or Coffee storage jars. Absolutely do
not boil a jar of tobacco to seal it!

I'll get the promised tobacco out to you this week by UPS.

Best,
-Bob

[ BTW, I've posted on rec.food.cooking asking about wire bail jars,
but haven't gotten a useful source yet. And yes, I'd appreciate the
condensed version of the cellaring article. -S.]

Hello,
I am a very new member in the Club of Pipe Smokers.
My name is Mathias and i am from germany.
I would like to know if there were other members in germany 
too, because the USA is to far to travel.
I like to know where i can buy a good pipe without
these 9mm filters, in germany they mostly sell this.
I prefer smoking a pipe without filters, because it would taste
better.
What did the other members of the club say to this subjekt.
I hope i will here some news from you.
( I hope my english is not to bad? )

Tabacs i am smoking are
		Dunhill: Early Morning
		Black Luxury
		Orlik Club (Brand new but it tastes very good )
If you know good tabacs please mail them to me.		

With friendly wishes
		Mathias 

[Almost any mail-order company that sells pipes in the USA, sells them
without the filters. Check the Resource Guide; "With Pipe and Book"
might be a reasonable bet. Don't know about international shipments,
though. -S. ]

Steve,

Thanks for the welcome. I've received the first mailing of the digest 
and I am impressed with the depth of the writing and the manner in 
which this vehicle accomplishes its stated purpose.

I'm a cigar smoker, although I've smoked a pipe in years past (gave it 
up because it seemed too "high maintenance" and I just didn't have the 
time). My favorite cigars are Ashtons, although I also enjoy Don 
Diegos and Macanudos. In my opinion, a good cigar and a good English 
ale are both reasons for one to appreciate drawing breath...

I'm a 35 year old freelance computer consultant, married with one 
child. My wife wishes I didn't smoke, but simply adds it to the long 
list of "things I tolerate about my husband." &lt;grin&gt; (I keep a similar 
list for her...)

Looking forward to reading future issues of the Digest! Thanks!

Fellow PDers:

I have sat back and watched everyone else chat, and I feel that it is my turn. 
 I am a 26 year old ex-broker who has a passion for cigars.  I started in 
Boston at one of the best smoke shops(in my opinion).  Five years and many, 
many cigars later, I am on a quest.  I now live in the Allentown, PA area, and 
I have taken a job at a local smoke shop, so that I can learn more.  I enjoy 
talking to fellow cigar and pipe smokers, and invite anyone who is in the area 
to stop by Collin's Tobacco in the Lehigh Valley Mall.  Newbies are especially 
welcome, I am only a 5 year vet myself.  I am also looking to start a club in 
the Lehigh/Upper Delaware Valley, to host socials and the like.  I have made 
sure that Collin's stocks some of the best cigars, so we can choose and enjoy. 
 If anyone is interested, stop by or email me.

Hi folks!

I would like to thank everyone who contribute to the Digest. I really enjoyed
reading it today. I must honestly say that I've learned several things about
pipes today.

I began smoking cigars over six years ago, when our daughter was born. My
wife and I were executives on Wall Street. We didn't feel cigars that said
"It's a Girl" were the right type of cigars to pass out to our associates.
All the "old time cigar smokers" were not able to tell us what a good cigar
was as we kept getting the same answer to questions when we inquired what a
good cigar was ("I've been smoking the same stuff for years, I can't tell you
what a good cigar is").

We went to Nat Shermans as we thought they would certainly know. I bought 2
boxes of Partigas 8-9-8s with our daughter's name printed on them ($170.00
six and a half years ago).

Having never smoked anything in my life, I tried one and fell in love!!

I learned quite alot from the J &amp; R color catalog (it explained alot about
cigar making and various tobbaccos). Between trying various cigars and the
catalog (and learning from speaking to various cigar merchants).

After a while, I began to explore pipes. I was unable to find the same
pleasure in pipes as I found in cigars. After trying various tobbaccos for
the pipe, I went to a shop here in New York. The tobbaconist was a female who
smoked pipes. I told her of my problem regarding the lack of pleasure which
the pipe had given me. She sold me several types of tobbaccos for over
$60.00. I tried them all, and put the pipe away for several years. A friend
suggested that I try Dunhill "Royal Yacht". I loved it!! Now I am back
between the pipe and smoking my cigars (Hondurans)! Most of my purchases come
from J&amp;R. I highly suggest and recommend them (their telephone number is
800.JR.CIGAR).

Now I find that I must replace my filtered pipe. I would appreciate any
suggestions from anyone who enjoys smoking filtered pipes. It is now time to
move up to a better pipe.

Once again, thank you for the Digest. Please keep it coming!

Dear Mark,
I have also found the Dunhill people out of New York to be less then
enthusiastic. I have called them with questions and they act like they are
doing you a favor. Alfred Dunhill has a free club which you can join called
the "Fellowship of the White Spot". They generate a newsletter every year and
it is quite entertaining. I may be telling you something that you already
know, but this society might help you identify your humidor. If you or anyone
else would like an application e-mail me address and I will mail you
application. Dunhill does have an Archive Dept. Howard Smith is the Archive
Controller. His address is Alfred Dunhill Ltd., Smoker's Products Division,
32 St. Andrews Rd, London E17 6BQ UK.     Happy smoking,

_________________________________________

Greetings to all the 800 and more readers of this list

I'm writing this in Finland, sitting with my 486-DX2-66-PC, every now and 
then looking at my 20" monitor. I watch words emerging out of nowhere in a  
Word for Windows 6.0a. screen.
Let me tell you about a pipe smoker's agony in the wilderness.
Every summer I pack my rucksack to wander three weeks in the wilderness in 
Lapland and fish mainly trout and grayling. That's the peak of the year to me.
I usually travel by air 1000 km:s (about 600 miles) from home in southern 
Finland to Lapland. First with a DC-9 and then the rest of the way with a 
small, 12 to 18 passengers' Bandeirante prop-plane. After that I still have 
a 50 miles drive in a four-wheeler to get to a small Lapp-village called 
Nakkala. (The name is actually written with two small dots above every 
"a"-character.) I have in front of and around me the biggest wilderness in 
Europe. I can wander 4 - 5 days all the time to the same direction still 
going further away from civilization. Nobody lives there in the summertime. 
A few lapps inhabit the area in the wintertime, but now they have moved with 
their reindeers to the Arctic sea. So I'm on my own. The landscape is  from 
400 - 700 m. over the sea. It is subarctic, no trees but fell birch, willow 
and juniper. There are thousands of chrystal clear, blue lakes. Many small 
brooks and a few rivers are runnining northwards to the Arctic Ocean.
Many exciting species live in the wilderness, and they are quite fearless 
because they haven't met human beings before.
But for me, fish is the most important species because I must catch them for 
food. It's impossible to carry food enough for three weeks in the rucksack. 
I'll try to catch with fly or a small lure mainly Salmo trutta = trout, 
Salvelinus alpinus = char, Thymallus thymallus = grayling, Perca fluviatilis 
= perch, and Esox Lucius = pike. Normally it takes from 15 to 30 minutes to 
get fish enough to feed you for the day.
You understand that when packing the rucksack I must be very careful. 
Usually I make a list of things to take with me, but during the years you 
get accustomed to things so you are beginning to make mistakes. 
At home I had bought 8 packs of 40 grams of Amphora Regular, which had to be 
more than needed, but you know how it is.
I like Amphora Regular (a Cavendish-type mixture in brown package) perhaps 
because the sortiment of pipe tobaccoes here in Finland is so scarce. I 
think it is a quite balanced, neutral mixture of Burley, Oriental, Kentucky 
and Virginia tobaccos, whatever they then might be. Especially the 
*Oriental* part wakes up my curiosity. Could it be *this wonderful Latakia* 
so often mentioned in this list?
Having wandered two days enjoying the scenery and loneliness, overnighting 
in tent listening mosquitoes and beginning to make my third morning Muesli 
and coffee I noticed that the first pack of Amphora is coming to its end. 
O.K: crawl to the "abside" of the tent and look in the backpack to get some 
more...
Ididn't find tobaccoes where I usually keep them. For a moment I played with 
the thought: "what if I couldn't find them at all". The thought made me 
shiver with cold. I continued searching till everything that was in went 
out, *but not the tobaccoes*. Pipe cleaners I had three packs, pipes I had 
five peaces with me, but no tobacco. The only tobacco I had was *the extra 
special* two 40 grams' packs of *Mc Baren Virginia no 1* I had bought in the 
town of Oulu where I changed the plane. The sortiment of pipe tobacco there 
was so small so I couldn't get better.
I had to look reality straight in the eyes. "Nearly three weeks in the 
wilderness with just 80 grams of pipe tobacco." And, you know; nowhere in 
the world you enjoy more smoking pipe than alone in wilderness sitting at 
campfire steaking trout and thinking light blue thoughts.
It was an exceptional summer in other respects, too. The temperature was 
higher than I had experienced in 20 years. The thermometer was showing +20 - 
+30 degrees Celsius day after day. Mosquitoes were really angry; there was a 
flock of thousands and again thousands of them trying to suck your blood 
just in the same second you reached your head out of the tent. During the 
hottest time of the day I had a wet towel above my chest when lying in tent 
and waiting the sun get more down to let me go for the fish. Don't you think 
that a good pipe of unsweetened cavendish had been a real pleasure for me? 
But that was not allowed for me. I had two choices: First, stop smoking, and 
second to begin to regulate smoking. I chose the latter option, which meant 
that I could smoke less than two pipes per day, and still I had to 
anticipate that tobacco doesn't last to the end of the journey.
Day after day passes by. I fish mainly with fly and and get fish. Perhaps it 
was one of the best summers regarding fishing. It was the first time I 
didn't take camera with me and of course I got the biggest trout ever. It 
weighted perhaps 3 kg (6 pounds). That fish I had to eat smoked for three days. 
Oh those blessed moments I had filling my sandblasted Savinelli Porto Cervo 
or Roma #305 with Mc Baren's Virginia no 1.!
Usually I waked up about 8 a'clock, had Muesli, coffee and raw salted trout 
on a rye crisp. After that I expanded the moment to get the first puff of 
the day. The agony was in the fact that the pipe had to last long in the 
afternoon. I had a few puffs, layed pipe aside, had a wet towel on my breast 
and layed in my tent swetting and waiting for the time to get next couple of 
puffs. Then in the afternoon I eat fish and got my puffs again. 
The sun getting a bit lower in the sky I went to fish all the time longing 
for a pipe but without getting one. I got my fish and came back to the tent 
to clean the trout. And again found that something was missing.
O.K. That's how it went. The weather was warm and sunny all the time. 
Fishing was great, but the last three days I was without tobacco. It was 
awful. When I got back to Nakkala, there was a reindeer-owner Lapp, whom I 
got tobacco. It was menthol flavored trash aimed to self rolled cigarettes, 
but I filled my Savinelli with it and enjoyed. Afterwards it took many 
pipefulls to get rid of that wonderful taste.

that have been discussed from time to time?

BTW, Steve, I noticed your post on rec.woodworking about biscuit joinery.  What

<a name="16">Subject: Let me introduce myself.</a>

My name is Joe Greenberg.  I work as a CPA in downtown Los Angeles and live
in Sherman Oaks with my wife and 7 month old daughter (neither of whom
smoke).  I grew up in Omaha, NE (Go Huskers!), went to school in Washington,
DC and have lived in Los Angeles for 11 years.  I started smoking cigars
about 4 months ago on a whim and I've enjoyed it ever since.

At first I basically selected my cigars at random.  This got to be
overwhelming given the wide variety available.  So I went to the library
andfound the Davidoff and Bahti?? books which were quite informative (I
recommend them to anyone new to cigars).  I now have a little better grasp on
which cigars to select.  I have not settled on any one cigar to smoke, but I
have tried and liked some from Arturo Fuente, H. Upmann, Matacan, Macanudo.
 I even found the La Plata store near my office where I was able to watch
cigars being made.  It was quite interesting, especially after having read
about the process.

Before I go, I have several questions:

What is the difference between cigars of varying sizes and ring guages made
by the same manufacturer (other than size and ring guage)?

What is the best, inexpensive, way to store my cigars?  I currently keep them
in an air-tight glass jar with a damp sponge on the bottom.

How do I download Pipes Digest onto my computer?

I would love to meet other cigar smokers in the Los Angeles area.  I look
forward to future issues of Pipes Digest and participating in the group.

Steve, et al.,
	Back in Digest 169 I sent in a message titled "Carey's and Jerri's.
There I had complained of the service I received from Carey's Smokeshop
in Ohio when I tried to mail order a Savinelli from them and had given
up waiting for it to arrive after 7 weeks so canceled my order.  I had
written a *SECOND* letter of complaint to Bill Miller on 17 January
before I finally got any response (I received an apolegetic letter on 
26 January from their Manager of Customer Relations with a $20 gift
certificate).  In this second letter I included a copy of my original
letter to Digest 169 and made a point of saying that approximately 
800 people (at that time) were reading this on a weekly basis.  Maybe
that's what got their attention! (altho there is no mention of this 
in their letter).  Anyway, not to belabor this, but I thought I should
report back as to what happened.  (But I haven't changed my mind - I
still will not order from Carey's ever again - too much hassle).
	Anyway, time to fill a favorite pipe with a favorite blend,
light it up, lean back, enjoy and forget lifes' little aggravations.

Steve, and all......
Just an update for those of you who find themselves in Toronto, Ontario
and are looking for a decent shop of Smokers Requisites.
*Winston &amp; Holmes*, have 3 such shops located around town.
        *  138 Cumberland St. (Old York Lane-Yorkville)
            Toronto  M5R 1A6    (416) 968-1290

        *  207 Queen's Quay West (Queen's Quay Terminal - Harbourfront)
            P.O.Box 16, Toronto  M5J 1A7   (416) 203-0344

        *  2 First Canadian Place (Stock Exchange Tower)
            P.O.Box 28, Toronto   M5X 1A9    (416) 363-7575

They also have a Mail Order Service available 1-800-465-2035 and a 
Fax (416) 968-2201.
They have a great collection of Pipe and Cigar books, Havana Cigars 
(I'm not sure if that's a big problem for our US friends or not...), Private
Stock Tobacco Blends, Pipes, Cigars, and Smoker's Accessories. I found a
signed copy of Ben Rapaport's Antique Pipe Book and I've been looking
for a copy for over a year. They also have shops in which one still may
smoke and feel comfortable. (Toronto has an anti-smoking By-Law..)
For our British and European friends..they still stock Cope's Escudo....
So, if you are in Toronto on business (or pleasure), two of the shops are
within walking distance of the CN Tower and SkyDome.
Cheers from Toronto, eh ?

Dear Steve:

Thank you for your prompt response to my request for a subscription to
Pipe Digest.  I started pipe smoking in college (can it be 25 years ago?)
but since graduation I have never lived in close proximity to a quality 
tobacconist.  Therefore I have missed participating in the community of
pipe smokers which I always found so enjoyable during my college years.
Being able to connect via the internet is wonderful.  Thank you, Steve.

I was interested in your conversation with Craig Tarler of Cornell and
Diehl, specifically as it relates to glycerol.  I had heard previously
that it was used as a short-cut method for flavoring tobacco and as a
preservative.  I had also heard that glycerol does not completely burn 
in the bowl and therefore contributes to a "wet heel."  I'd be interested in
hearing if these stories are fact or fiction.  If they are factual I'd be
interested in finding reliable sources of glycerol-free blends.

Thanks again,

John Graham

<a name="24">Subject: Recent Pipes Digest</a>

Steve,

I really enjoy Pipes Digest and appreciate your consistent efforts
to assemble and distribute it. At its best, the Digest is like a
pleasant gathering and converation among fellow Pipe and cigar
smokers.

However, I'm distressed by the increasingly frequent and strident
articles urging political action to combat anti-smoking activists.
I certainly agree that the anti-smoking crowd includes no shortage
of busy-bodies for whom controlling the habits of others transports
them to the brink of orgasm. Although I try to always be courteous
about when and where I smoke, I have had more than a few run-ins
with some incredibly rude nutcakes. Arguing against rudeness and
in favor of accomodating smokers and non-smokers in ventillated
public areas seems only reasonable.

However, it's worse than futile to argue against the idea that smoking
and second-hand smoke are potentially damaging to people's health.
First of all, the basic scientific evidence is quite consistent and
scientifically compelling. Anyone who smokes and thinks otherwise is
fooling him or herself. Compelling evidence is the very reason that
CONVERVATIVE Surgeon Generals Koop and Novello, appointed by Reagan
and Bush, oppose smoking in the first place.

Secondly, any meaningful discussion about methodological "problems"
with that huge body of research must be highly detailed and technical.
I sympathize with many of the points in Stephen Johnson's recent article,
but his criticisms and charges about the EPA and the studies it accepts
or rejects don't offer nearly enough information to evaluate. Even if
Johnson possesses that information, does it really have any place
here? Would a gourmet cooking newsletter devote regular space to cover
methodology in cholesterol testing?

I have no problem with BRIEF news items about restrictive legislation,
or suggestions about where to send letters or petitions, but I hope that
98% of the time we'll stay focused on the enjoyment appreciation of
the things that unite us.

Arthur Greenwald

[ Your point about brevity is well-taken. I would encourage submitters
to limit the length of their postings, or to divide them into weekly
installments, as appropriate. 

I'll let Steve answer your criticisms of his article for himself. I do
have a long technical criticism of the statistical analysis in the
Trichopoulos et. al. article on ETS that appeared in the JAMA, one of
the principal sources cited by the EPA in their finding. This
criticism is available from me upon request, and I'll put it up for
FTP and Web browsing too (site maintainers willing).

Regarding political action, it's being taken against us by the
busybodies you mentioned. Their goals are clear, and are not to our
benefit.  If we don't defend our right to the enjoyment and
appreciation of the things that unite us, we will certainly lose it. -S. ]

Pipe Digest has rekindled (pun intended) my interest in pipe smoking. I've been
experimenting with varioius tobaccos but could really use a primer on the
different types and some of the prominent (or less so) brands in each category.
Have you published such a thing before?  I've read so much about Bengal Slices
(I always want to say bagel slices) that I feel I must try it.  A friend has
recommended Dunhill's Royal Yacht.  What's the low-down on that?

I'm still mainly smoking corncobs because I don't want to rush into
buying a briar and I don't have time now to do a proper search.  I do
have an old briar that I like. I am partial to bent pipes and expect
that the briar I buy will be a full bent or close to it.

Keep up this very good work. I'm having a ball.  Thanks.

Hi fellow pipe &amp; cigar smokers,

I'm new to this list, but I've been a pipe &amp; cigar smoker now for about 11
years.  I'm a 36-year-old active duty Marine.  Besides smoking pipes &amp;
cigars, my hobbies are dogs &amp; dog training and homebrewing.   I usually smoke
Petersons and Charatans, with Dunhill "My Mixture" 965 and Balkan Sobranie
being my preferred tobaccos.  As far as cigars go, I enjoy most of the
premium brand cigars, but I seem to smoke Upmann 100's the most.  
Like many of you, I suppose, my wife is tolerant of my smoking up to a point,
as long as I don't "stink up" the house.  Therefore, I do most of my pipe &amp;
cigar smoking while driving (I commute an hour each way to work), or while
sitting in my makeshift den in the garage, or while taking the dog for a walk
(he gets lots of walks).  
Someone please let me know if this e-mail gets through.  Not only am I new to
the list, but I've only been an on-line subscriber for a month now so I
wouldn't be too surprised if I somehow make a mistake.  
I'm looking forward to many issues of the Digest!

<a name="27">Subject: some reactions to several digests</a>

to ??????@???.???????.??

Hello all of you,

While reading some digest from severals week I have some things in relations to
them:

- like I have said some issues back; using a saturated salts/water
solution gives a humidity of some 70% in a humidor. Because water is
messy;-), I was thinking of some absorbant. Of course oasis works
greet, and I still think that it is the best.  But I saw something new
on the market that perhaps could do as well. It sucks water (but it
does not suck salts water:-(, so the humidy control is around some
90%. The stuff is called in the Netherlands: Mega-Crystals. In dried
form it are small things (some milimeters big), when water is putten
in contact, it sucks it up and the crystals become some tens
milimeters (the stuff is used for soaking plants for a long period of
time). I tried thus this stuff with salt water (to get 70% humidity),
but that does not work. The crystals don't suck this salt water. Do
people have similar alternatives?

- I have been in Virginia some months ago, and in the book "Virginia,
off the beaten path" (Third edition 1993) I saw a tabacco and textile
museum in Danville. I drove a lot of miles (from Wasthinton) to see
this museum, but it is not there anymore:-( But I heard that in future
they are thinking of recreating the meseum, so that is good news in
this tabacco country!  The trip was not entirely for nothing. I have
visited some some 10 wineries, so I bought some bottle of good
Virginia wine!

- the uneven burning of cigars could be caused because of uneven filling (to
much air or tabacco with big stems in it) in the inner side of the cigar.

- a good cigar/pipe shops in the Netherlnds (I have no financial relation with
it, other that I sometimes buy there;-):

P.G.C. Hajenius
Rokin 92-96
Amsterdam
tel: +31 20 237494

It is a shop with a big walk in humidor full of good cigars. The shop is close
to the tram, so when you are in Amsterdam it should be easy to find (ask for
'Rokin').

- when being in Ireland, I saw a nice tabacco shop opposite Trinity College in
Dublin (which is worth a visit due to the Book of Celts):

J.J. Fox,
119 Grafton STreet
Dublin
tel.: +353 1 677 0533

- humidity of cigars depends on the country where you live (this
refers to a mail from ??????@???.???). In the Netherlands the cigars
(which are short filler cigars) are smoked in a less humid way (some
50%), only the import cigars (havana, Dom. Republic, etc.) are smoked
at a humidity of 70%.  In the case of 50% one will hear the crakling
of the cigars (that seems be the sound for a Dutch/short filler
cigar).  My one opinion is that all cigars are smoke better on 70%, it
is a more melow taste in my opinion.

- Mark Thomson, said that he somewhere heard, that the ratings in Cigar
Aficionado where based on advertising. Is this true??? I can image that rating
cigars will influence the advertising and the market within the USA, but I
really don't hope that 'prodcers' with lot of money get the highest points. I
really expect that it is just a rumor!

- I find it a pity that Cigar Aficionado is so related to the Carrebian cigar
making industry. Being from the Netherlands (which produce some 80% of the
ciagrs in the world), I really find it a pity that Cigar Aficionado does not
look at other markets. There are lots of other countries that produce fine
cigars (Holland;-), Germany, Brazil, Indonsia, etc.). Hope they will change
sometime there view!

That was it for now.

All the best,

Victor

<a name="28">Subject: General blatherings</a>

Dear Steve -

Thanks very much for your appreciative comments concerning my EPA
article.  I've received similar comments by e-mail from some
individual members of our group, and I'm glad I was able to provide
some information that can make for substantive arguments in our
defense.  I was particularly gratified to hear from Sheldon Richman,
who is the senior editor at the Cato Institute.  Mr.  Richman informs
me that Cato is about to publish more damaging information on the EPA
report.  BTW - my next project is to scan Tom Bliley's report and turn
it into an ASCII file so that it can be uploaded onto the Net.  I'm
hoping to do this next weekend.

Your comment regarding the persistence of the anti-smoking movement is
well taken.  I don't mean to suggest that our present Congress has
ended our problems.  It's one thing to overturn smoking bans, but
there is still the larger problem of undoing many years of
brainwashing by the anti-smoking activists.  My argument is that we
now have a unique opportunity to see the activists lose their power
over legislation.  When this happens I think we'll find that social
attitudes will start becoming more tolerant.  Bottom line is that we
are no longer alone in our fight, and make no mistake - the
conservative shift which took place on November 8th is the best things
that could've happened to us.  Anti-smokers will always be with us as
long as there's smoking.  I don't think they'll ever disappear (and I
don't think we will either), but whether or not they have any major
influence is another matter.  As empires rise and fall so will theirs,
and I'm very optimistic that we may be witness to their fall from
power.  If so, then perhaps we can also leave behind some weapons that
will be used by a future generation when it's faced with the same
battle we've had to fight.

To underscore my point about our improved political fortunes here's a
bit of news.  Congress recently declared a moratorium on all further
anti-tobacco legislation (this moratorium also includes environmental
legislation as well).  It will remain in effect indefinitely, or at
least until lawmakers can enact reforms which will impose strict
scientific standards on the process of proposing, reviewing and
debating such legislation.  These reforms will include the requirement
that the same standards be applied to the cost/benefit evaluations
made on proposed laws.  In other words the anti-smoking and
environmental activists (who are often one in the same) will no longer
have "carte blanche" in pursuing their agendas through Congress.

Also - even though OSHA started conducting public hearings on its
proposed Federal workplace smoking ban, it is highly unlikely that the
ban will actually go through.  In addition to overwhelming opposition
from the general public, there is also very strong opposition from the
labor unions.  The Department of Energy has issued a report seriously
challenging not only the misuse of science with ETS, but also OSHA's
estimates of the cost/benefit aspect of the ban.  If OSHA does go
through with the ban it is certain to have serious consequences for
the Agency.

In other news, a class action lawsuit was filed against the tobacco
companies in the District Court of Louisiana.  The suit was filed by 3
smokers and the widow of a smoker who charge that the tobacco
companies knew nicotine is addictive, and that they intentionally
manipulate the nicotine content of cigarettes to keep smokers hooked
(hmm, now where have we heard that one before?).  The suit was filed
on behalf of all U.S. smokers.  And get this - the only qualification
for being a part of this class action is if a smoker has been told by
his/her doctor that smoking is hazardous, and the smoker still hasn't
quit.  A note from the doctor is not required, just the individual's
word!

Apparently since the antis are not getting their way through the government
they've decided to try bankrupting the tobacco industry instead.  These
lawsuits are about as frivolous as they get, and they are a gross affront to
reasonable thinking (not to mention concepts like individual responsibility).
 I mention this because the Republicans' Contract with America includes a
clause dealing with liability reform.  Specifically this reform entails
putting in place a British-style "loser pays" system, along with a provision
specifically prohibiting the use of junk science in prosecuting product
liability cases.

In light of these and other proposed suits against the tobacco companies I
suggest that we write to our elected officials in Washington and urge them to
expedite the liability reforms.  We should also recommend that such reforms
include a "grandfather" clause that would apply the new law (if it passes) to
the cases that have been filed since the new Congress was sworn in.  I know
that "grandfather" clauses are typically difficult to get, but I think this
new lawsuit in Louisiana is so outrageous that such action is warranted.  I
personally find these suits offensive simply on the matter of principle,
although some of you may feel they're justified because they attack
cigarettes.  But herein lies a caution:  Regardless of
anyone's feelings about cigarettes we would do well to remember that whatever
hurts the cigarette companies will sooner or later hurt us.

Well, that's it for now.  Thanks for your continuing efforts, Steve, and keep
up the good work!

Best Regards,

Steve J. (Briar Man)

Tobacco, worth the wait

Tobaccos should be purchased for both immediate consumption and for
their long term cellaring potential. In some cases the same blend
can be used now, with additional supplies put away for the future.

The single most important reason to acquire a tobacco, be it for now
or for long term storage, is the fact that you enjoy the taste of
the tobacco. This brings us to the obvious problem of how to find
the best tobacco to suit your taste. The answer is that you probably
will not find just one "best tobacco", but several. In addition, no
matter how perfect your current blend, chances are very good that
you will continue to search for something even better. Chances are
also very good that over your pipe smoking history you will fins
tobaccos that you will like, those that are okay (but not great) and
those that you do not like at all. 

Pipe smoking and tasting are after all part of the enjoyment of the
total experience. The more you know about the basics of tobacco
mixtures and blends, the better chance you will have in find only
those tobaccos that fit your needs. The golden rule of tobacco
tasting, which by the way is the exact rule used in wine selection,
is if you like the taste, smell and general character of the tobacco
(or wine), then it is a good blend. This rule will stand for the
least expensive tobaccos and the most expensive. It is true for the
simple mixtures and just as true for the most exotic blends - if you
like it, that is all that is important. A small problem comes into
play when the tobacco you are cellaring starts to change, as its
taste will change over time. The trick is to taste the tobacco young
and project what it will become in six months or six years.

Let's back up for a moment and redefine the basic types of tobacco
blends. Without going into a basic primer on Virginia, Burley,
Latakia and the like, we will go a step further and define tobacco
mixtures as a) mass produced aromatics, b) true cavendish (or type)
processed aromatics, c) Oriental "natural" non-aromatics and d)
Virginia based natural blends. Without exception, all of these
general types or styles of tobacco will change over a period of
time. 

Since mass-market styled aromatics use low character base tobaccos
and spray their top note or sweeteners, these tobaccos will actually
decline in character over time. Heavy cased aromatics, both in bulk
form and in packed form (pouch or tin) should be used "fresh" and
not left to cellar. True cavendish processed aromatics, usually
Danish produced, can be smoked now, but will continue to improve
over a period of time of up to a year. After the first year little
additional change will occur in the base tobacco of Danish
Cavendish, although the flavor, sweetness and character will "hold"
for several additional years under proper storage conditions.
Oriental natural blends (also English blends which are similar) will
continue to change for several years if left to cellar under proper
conditions. Virginia based flakes, cakes and loose blends will start
to change the day they are packaged and continue for many years. 

The degree of change in non-aromatic tobaccos depends more on how
"raw" the tobacco contained in the finished product. There are many
types of Virginia tobacco. Virginia is used in everything from basic
aromatic mixtures to pure navy flake tobaccos. In general only high
sugar content Virginias is used in premium tobaccos. Pressing,
heating, steaming, stoving and many other processes are used to
modify the basic raw Virginia, each plays a part in both the
immediate product taste and in the maturation process.              
The only way that you can project how a tobacco will change with
time is trial and error. The trick is to improve the odds in your
trials and reduce the errors part of trying new tobaccos. Each of us
has certain types of tobacco that we enjoy, some that we experiment
with and a few that we just do not like. You already have a head
start on your future trials and errors, just with this basic
understanding of personal taste.  If you can not stand American
styled black cavendish, avoid those blends that contain black
cavendish. You should understand that "English styled Black
Cavendish" is a completely different product than that found in
Captain Black or bulk types of American black cavendish (BCA, ZBC,
RLP-6, etc). If you hate latakia, avoid blends that contain this
tobacco and concentrate on the other types of tobacco. There is
nothing wrong with occasionally trying blends that you "think you
won't like" based on the types of tobacco they contain, just don't
expect miraculous results. Now comes the hard part...

Two additional hints concerning the "proper" aging of tobacco are: 

Rule #1 Cool, but not cold, storage conditions will allow your
tobacco to mature in a slow, even manner. The proper range is
slightly less than room temperature (55 F to 65 F) for slow, steady
maturation of tobacco. Tinned tobacco that is stored at a slightly
warmer range, say 75 F, will mature quicker with only a slight loss
in the overall final product. Remember that heat is used with steam,
some types of pressing and stoving of tobacco, but these processes
are used during manufacturing rather than the long term maturation
of the "finished product".  

Rule #2: Long term maturation is best achieved through the use of a
slightly loose packaging that contains some air. Vacuum packed tins
are typically used for Virginia based flakes and some Oriental
mixtures. Packaging that contains no "loose space" or air will still
mature, however the time needed to completely mature these vacuum
packed tobaccos will be much longer. The sealed, slightly loose,
packaging (tins) used by A &amp; C Peterson and McClelland are the
perfect long (but not too long) term cellaring containers. 

I recently read a statement that said "tin tobacco was never meant
by their manufacturers to age in the can...". The remarks went on to
say how a few lucky individuals had discovered that tobacco does
change after tinning and that all you had to do enjoy mature tobacco
was to acquire your favorite blend and put it away for a period of
time. 

Since the writer was not a seller of tobacco I can understand why
this popular misconception was written. The actual facts are that
mass producers of "popular blends" (ie: drug store grade aromatics)
hope that their products do not last long enough to start to change.
Producers of quality leaf do expect their products to change after
tinning, and in many cases will hold their finished (tinned)
tobaccos for a period of time before releasing them to be smoked. 

Almost all of the standard McClelland tin tobaccos, especially
Virginia based blends, are held for at least 12 months before being
released to resellers. Several McClelland blends are held at the
factory for 18 months before being considered a finished product.
A&amp;C Peterson states several times in their tobacco information
sheets that blends are "held to age" to fully wed the tobaccos
during their manufacture. 

Tobacco goes through many different stages before being released as
a final finished product fit for smoking. What should be understood
after saying this, is that just because the manufacturer of a blend
has released a finished product does not mean that the "finished
tobacco" will not continue to change. Tobacco manufacturers are
aware of this fact. Depending on the type or style of the blend
offered, manufacturers will take steps to either retard or enhance
these changes after release.

Exactly how a tobacco will mature is hard to tell without having
tried a five or ten year old example of a current production brand.
There are several basic guides that will hold true in projecting the
future taste of a newly purchased tobacco. 

#1: Highly processed, mass produced "drug store style" aromatics
will hold for up to a year and then begin to lose what little base
character they have. 

#2: Quality aromatics, such as those produced by Stokkebye,
McClelland, Charatan, John Sinclair and the new PCCA USA Series will
age well for 2 to 5 years. 

#3: Oriental style blends such as Rattrays original blends, Ashton
original blends, Dunhill, Sobranie and McClelland will need at least
1 year to soften with almost an indefinite period of time offered if
you would like to hold these. I know of an example where a member
has had a quanity of Rattray's Black Mallory for over 20 years and
it is still maturing and changing. The virginia content of an
English/Oriental mixture has more to do with long term maturation,
than the Oriental or Latakia content of the blend. Orientals and
latakia will mature and "wed" the blend during the first several
years, however the virginia tobacco in an English/Oriental mixture
will continue to change for many years.

#4: Virginia based mixtures, especially pressed Virginias (cake,
flake, spun disks, etc) offer the most drastic improvment with time.
What will start out as a hot, biting, sharp tasting tobacco will
change to a soft, smooth, mellow flavor with the addition of many
years of maturation. A good example of how to tell how old a
Virginia based pressed tobacco is, will be the color. 

If you open a tin of new Escudo you will see a definite contrast in
the bright yellow Virginias and the dark, almost black Perique. This
defined contrast in Escudo will change over time to almost a
monotone dark color on a well aged tin of just opened Escudo. Three
to five years will be a minimum age for softening Virginia based
pressed tobaccos. While pressed Virginias will age well for 10 or 20
years, few of us have the patience to hold these tins for this long.

Stoving  tobacco  is a way  to shorten the long term maturation
period of high Virginia content blends. The process of stoving a
tobacco is basically to heat the final blend under controlled
conditions as you would cook on a "stove". Gentle and controlled,
even heating, will cause the tannic acid breakdown and accelerate
the changes in sugar/starch content of the leaf. You can not replace
the long term maturation of Virginia tobacco with stoving, although
the process will remove the harshness of bright Virginia. Proper
stoving of Virginia based blends will accelerate the aging process,
but will not replace term maturation. 

Generally a stoved tobacco will be darker in the tin without the
contrasting bright and dark leaf of a non-stoved mixture. The
stoving process much more than just heating a finished blend, as too
much heat will break the character of an otherwise excellent
Virginia based tobacco. McClelland tobacco Company has had
outstanding success with stoving tobaccos. Many of the McClelland
produced Personal Reserve Series tobaccos and all of the
McClelland/PCCA USA Series tobaccos enjoying the added benefit of
stoving.

It would be almost impossible to suggest the perfect cellar
inventory for "your tobacco cellar". The perfect cellar selection
would depend more on what you prefer in taste and tobacco style,
rather than the aging potential of aromatics, orientals or
Virginias. Once you understand what you can expect from these
different styles of tobacco, you will be able to select your choices
for your cellar. Once thing that should be remembered is that a one
dimensional tobacco cellar is about as interesting as a single
selection wine cellar, or eating the same dinner every evening.
There are many excellent tobaccos on today's market, in every style
and taste. A properly mixed tobacco cellar will include a selection
of various styles and types with the heaviest selection being your
favorite. Do not limit your cellar selection to only one type or to
a small quantity of your favorite mixture. 
You will want to open and taste your tobaccos, tin by tin, as they
mature. A limited number of tins, especially your favorite types,
will limit your taste testing and offer you only a small amount of
mature tobacco once aging has worked its magic.

Make sure that you date the tins in your cellar with the month and
year of purchase. This can be done by writing on the label or using
a marker on the underside of the tin. As of 1991, all Personal
Reserve tobaccos and the soon to be released USA Series of tobaccos
have the year of manufacture already stamped on the tin. I would
still suggest that you month/year date all tobaccos you decide to
cellar.

As a final step in tracking the progression of tobaccos that you
cellar, you should keep a log. Your cellar log can be as simple as a
3X5 card with dates and tasting comments or as complex as you like.
Your log should list the dates that you added to your cellar, by
type and brand of tobacco. You will also find if very helpful to
keep tasting notes based on either a point scale (taste, bite,
sharpness, softness, sweetness, etc) or just a text based reaction
to each tobacco as they mature. This written history will serve you
well when you track the other tobaccos in your cellar. A cellar log
will help you learn to recognize the progression of various types of
tobaccos, especially those that you decide to add to your cellar
selection in the future.

<a name="7">Subject:      Re: Pipes Digest #179 -- February 26, 1995</a>

Dear Cigar and Pipe Fans,
     As I recently joined the computer world and have begun to learn to "surf"
on the Internet, I was delighted to find a service such as this available to th
e smoking public.  It serves as a reminder that even a leper and a pariah, as
smokers are generally viewed, can have a place where his problems are understoo
d.
     By the way, my name is Tom Payne and I am a third-year law student at the
University of Kentucky.  As such, I will graduate in three months or so.  I onl
y regret that this has been available for so long, and I only found out about i
t last week!  But now that I know, I am and remain a huge fan.  Sadly, my wife
does not share in my joy.  That is good because it gives me an interest that is
entirely separate from her, but it is bad because I can't smoke in the house.
But life could be worse.
     I have smoked pipes of and on for 10+ years (I'm 29) but only recently
settled on English blends as a favorite.  I like Balkan Sobranie, Dunhill
965, and a similar blend available at a local smokeshop called "Paul's
Stuff."  I found out about the 965 copy available from C&amp;D in the last digest,
and intend to order some soon.  Craig T. at C&amp;D was very nice and helpful, even
though I called a 10 at night.  Of course, I expected a machine and was a littl
e embarassed when he answered.  But he answered every question I asked and even
 volunteered info that was relevant but I hadn't thought of.  I was very please
d.
     I have been smoking cigars regularly for about a year now.  I have a stron
g preference for stronger cigars.  The only Dominican cigar I like is Arturo Fu
ente, and it is the only Dominican I have tried that I would call "robust."
Hondurans are a different story;  I like Punch and Hoyo de Monterrey very much.
As we all know, these are the only cigars available in the States due to the
long-standing trade embargo with Cuba (which is ridiculous in my opinion).
But on this point, I have heard from a very reliable source that Havanas can be
purchased through mail order with certain Canadian firms.  I mention this re
Gord Fergusons letter in #179.  I have not heard that these firms will sell
Havanas, but one could call to see.  Personally, I think a good Havana can't be
 beat; I had the opportunity to try some when I was overseas in the military
in my life before law school.  They are just simply the best.
     On a different point, in Levin's article about different types of Turkish
tobaccos, he referred to a Russian type called "Soukhum(?)"  I wonder if anyone
 out there knows anything about the origin of the word.  I was a Russian inter-
rogator in my army days, and in addition to the ordinary terminology that one w
ould be expected to know, I got to know quite a bit of slang.  So assuming that
 the word is Russian, my guess is that it means a declension of the word "dry"
or "of a b-tch" from the phrase "son of a b-tch."  I know this sounds bizarre,
but if anybody out there knows, please enlighten me.
     That's enough rambling for one day.  But let me thank you all once again
for providing such a resource and an outlet for our shared interest.  I look
forward to "talking" to you all again.  By the way, if this messes up, please
forgive me as I am new to the system.

Thanks again,

	Thank you for sending me the Pipes Digest so promptly!  I am a
20 year old college student and I just got into pipe smoking.  Your 
resources on the World Wide Web has been a great help for me;  I know
no one who smokes a pipe so the FAQ's and how to's were extremely helpful.
	I guess I am a hopeless romantic (english major/philosophy
minor) and I always thought pipe smoking was something that
compliments reading a book.  So I bought a pipe from the local
tobacconist and "American Spirit" tobacco.  The pipe itself seems
rather small, about four inches long and is just two pieces, the bit
and the rest of the pipe.  I haven't the experience to say whether or
not it was a "good" smoke, but I am certainly up for experimentation.
	I just wanted to say thanks for your existence.  You have helped me
enjoy a new experience, rich in tradition, almost as old as a the first good
book.

Steve et al: Mayhap the Digest subscribers can help me take advantage of an
opportunity. My girlfriend is spending a week in England next month and I
got her to agree to browse some pipe shops in London for me. What I need are
the names, and addresses, of a few shops, specially any known to have fair
selections of estate pipes (bargain hunter that I am). Also suggestions of
pipe brands she should keep an eye out for (except Petersons, which I
dislike). All suggestions welcome. Thanks.

Steve: I wonder if there are many "heavy tobacco" smokers out there.  That
is, I smoke heavy Balkan blends, Erinmore, St Brunos and Condor.  Also, I
believe that the tobacco from McClellan, both in tins and in bulk,  is just
about the finest in this country and rivals anything from Great Britain.  But
I admit most of these are a bit stout and certain not sweet, as many new pipe
smokers prefer.  I fear that the demand for this type of tobacco is
decreasing such as to be an indangered species.  So also are big pipes.  So
many of the current offerings in pipe shops are medium to small.  It is a
major effort and expense to find truely big Petersons, Costellos, Caminettos,
Ferndown.  Upshalls seem easier to find.  Savinelli has tried to put our a
fair pipe at a good price in the Hersules series.  I woonder if there are any
shops in the sountry that really try to get big pipes.  I would also like to
know of other sources for estate pipes.  I am on Nikos Levins list.  Bob.

<a name="11">Subject: RE: Caminetto</a>

Mr. Craig Lewis: More info on your Caminetto. I asked several of my collector
friends who have been collecting Caminettos longer than myself and got some
good responses, the best from Jay Milton of Edwardsville, IL, in spite of the
fact that the greatest Caminetto collector was the late and sorely missed,
Harvey Grief. 

Your Caminetto is one made not by the original Caminetto firm, but one made
in 1987 by the sons of Peppino Ascorti after they took over the operation of
their fathers "Ascorti" firm and decided to resurrect the Caminaetto name
even though their father and his former Caminetto partners had agreed not to
use the Caminetto name.

The models with numbers around the "quad-cross" indicate a more recent
vintage, after 1986 when the price increased dramatically with no increase in
quality (some collectors believe a drop in quality) so these are not near as
collectable as the several evolutions of the originals; upper left: shape or
catalog # (there were some 70 "usual" shapes and no #61 is listed as they
started at #101; a #161 is a flared Danish freehand shape that was usually
done in a flame grain finish); upper right: finish #: #1 - nat. flame grain,
#2 - nat. smooth, #3 - light walnut smooth, #4 - walnut smooth, #5 - red
smooth, #6 - extra sandblast lt. walnut, #7 - sandblast nat., red, or black,
#8 - carved nat., red, or black; lower right: year (01 = 1986); lower left:
series #: #1 - reg. 19mm bowl, #2 - large 22mm, #3 - Peppino 20-22mm, #4 -
Unique, varies. Since these don't quite agree with your listing, let me know
what you make of it.

The moustache should be white on your model.

Mr. Grief and others have uncovered some fakes, but we believe these were
copied from the older, rarer pieces and very few of them are around so you
should not have to worry. Some of these phonies are conspicuous with shape
numbers above 202 which was the highest seen by collectors on the originals,
however fakes are known with correct shape numbers.

Hope this finalizes the questions you have about your pipe. Hope you get to
try an original vintage Caminetto soon. Regards,...Rex

Hi Steve,

I'm glad to see that my previous e-mail went through okay.  The Pipe Digest
is one of my favorite mailing lists on the Internet, along with the dog
obedience/dog training lists.  You do a terrific job with the Digest--it must
take up a fair amount of your time!  

It's so nice to hear from other pipe &amp; cigar smokers out there.  After
reading the latest Pipe Digest I'm starting to think we're not quite as rare
as I had thought.  

I have a pipe-related question that hopefully will elicit some responses.
 Does anyone know of a high-quality, American-made pipe in the $100-130 price
range?  I've got several very nice Petersons and Charatans (large bowl bents)
but the new Charatans I've been looking at don't seem to be made as well as
the ones I bought in the mid-80s.  I don't particularly care for sandblasts
or freehand styles.  I've always liked the quality of briar that Peterson
uses and the way that Peterson pipes darken with use.  I may end up buying
another Peterson but I'm interested in trying something different, and would
like to get a nice American-made pipe (nothing against foreign brands,
though).

I'm open to suggestions--keep up the good work!

<a name="15">Subject: Hello all</a>

Hello Steve and other subscribers,
	I am a sophomore at the University of Arizona, and an avid pipe smoker.
Until recently, I had only a few close friends with which to share the 
joy of the pipe.  My, the wonders of technology!  I can now associate 
with fellow enthusiasts from across the globe.  I have been smoking a 
pipe now for over two years (my second anniversary was 1 and 1/2 months 
ago).  Through all the pressures and work to be done in college, I have 
always found time in the evening to sit down, light up, and spend an half 
an hour or so of "my time".  It's become one of my favorite parts of the 
day, when I can relax and leave the stress behind for a while.  Being a 
bit of an artist and a poet, the pipe has as well, at times, seemed to 
have helped my creativity and contemplation.  At present, I only have two 
pipes which I regularly smoke (I'm sure many of you know how money is in 
college!), my Peterson and my Maurizio.  My favorite type of tobacco has 
traditionally been the more flavorful aromatics with less bite, but as of 
late, I have begun smoking slightly heavier types with a bit more kick 
(Dark Knight, by name; I'm not sure of the exact blend).  At home, I 
always used to keep my tobacco in their bags, all in a large Tupperware 
container.  However, since I've moved,  the thing seems to get moldy, so 
I just keep the tobacco in their bags in a corner of my closet.  I guess 
the room has a high enough humidity that the tobacco retains a good 
portion of its moisture, although it's not quite the succulent moist kind 
I smoked at home.  Any suggestions on storage w/out mold problems?  I'd 
appreciate any information, just as I appreciate the subscription to this 
journal (thanks!).
						God bless,
						Dan

Hi everyone..
I am new at pipe smoking and just picked up a 10 dollar pipe (one that screws
together, i'm not sure if that is good or bad).  I guess you would say that i
am smoking Generic tobacco. I have tried Jacks, and LTD 300.. So far i can't
tell the diffrence.   
   Here's my question...  When i smoke the tobacco it feels very hot in my
mouth.. sort of like the very end of a cigar (i have been smoking cigars for
a few months now).  The bowl at the end of the pipe is extremly hot,  too
 hot to hold comfortably..  Are all pipes this way?? Am i getting this
problem because of the inexpensive pipe??  What is a good, but inexpensive
pipe just to see if i really enjoy smoking them as much as cigars?   Thanks
alot

Dear Steve, 

Thank you for the prompt response to my request for addition to the pipes

everything seems to be working.

However, this evening I found email addressed to me and several other
people advertising a humidor for $99.95 or something.  This wouldn't
be a Bad Thing(tm) if I were in the market for a humidor.  Since I'm not,
I considered it junk mail and tossed it.  But then I started wondering how
he got my address.  I guess he could have pulled it from the archives, if
this copy is already there, but this message was only to about six people,
not the entire list of new members.  Has anyone else mentioned this?  Do I
now get electronic junk mail forever?  If I win ten million dollars, will
Ed McMahon pop up in the middle of my session?  Is this guy really so
interested in my system that he really wants an entire eight meg core dump
to read?  Will Kimberly have the President's baby, or begin that
correspondence course to become a CIA hit person?

But seriously folks, I'm not particularly fond of any junk mail, but I'm
not going to get my gun out either.  I guess I'm just wondering if you had
heard about anything like this before.  I guess it could be one of the
members flogging this thing.  Well, enough ranting.  I'm enclosing the

slack this time, I guess.

Sorry if I've wasted your time with this.  I'll go take my medication now.

<a name="22">Subject: Uneven burns</a>

Dear Steve-

There's been much discussion lately as to why some cigars burn unevenly,
and I'd like to add my two cents.  It's been my experience that the reasons
for uneven burning can be divided into three categories- 1)Physical
characteristics of the cigar. 2)Storage/ Smoking environment of cigar. and
3)"Method" of smoking.
1)Generally, a better made cigar will burn uniformly, although I have
personally had rare trouble with Punch, Hoyo's, even Monte Cristos.  A fine
cigar will be of quality tobac- and shouldn't have large or noticeable
veins.  Not only are the veins marks of inferior wrapping leaf, the veins
tend to burn at rates unequal to that of the rest of the leaf, encouraging
uneven burns.  If you're buying a cigar singley (sp) you can give the cigar
a once over- checking for wrapper quality, and soft spots where tobac has
been bunched unevenly allowing for uneven burns.  Even some of the "better"
brands can carry a dud or two...
2)Poor levels of humidity are probably one of the most common reasons for
eneven burns- too soggy, too dry- also a quick change in humidity.  Ever
leave the confines of your well heated home on a cold day and try to smoke
a cigar in the process?  Bad things happen- bad things.  If the foot
doesn't burst upon combustion, it will certainly burn unevenly.  A windy
day can also inspire uneven burns
3)Lastly, and perhaps most insignificantly except in extreme cases, the
manner in which the cigar is smoked can contribute, positively or
negatively to the burn.  Slow, evenly paced puffs allow the cigar to burn
the way it was made to burn- evenly.  Any fool trying to suck down a Prince
Philip in 10 minutes flat will assuredly complain that his or her cigar is
burning unevenly.  Given the chance, most good cigars should right
themselves naturally.  An even cut at the shoulder helps for an even draw-
and make sure the end doesn't get soggy in your mouth! This wil generally
cause an uneven draw and uneven burn.
As I'm getting a little winded, I think I should quit lecturing.  Hope this
helps- and as often happens to me- try not to let an uneven burn ruin your
enjoyment of a good cigar- if it tastes good, smoke it.
On a side note of interest- I am a student at Penn State where (school)
legislature is in the works to ban smoking in dorm rooms PERIOD.  I feel
more than a little helpless since this has gone through WITHOUT prior
notice.  What can be done?  Help?  (This is to go into effect in 1996.)
Thanks a lot, and smoke one for me.

accurate.  I relate it as I heard it, leaving it to the rest of you to draw
your own conclusions, but I for one believe the story is true.  The story was
told to me a couple of days after Christmas.  I've told a few friends of mine
about it, but figured many of you Pipe Digest subscribers would also find it
interesting.  

On Christmas Eve afternoon a gentleman walked into the Tobacco Barn at the
Pentagon City mall and introduced himself to the salesman as Roger Clinton,
President Clinton's brother.  He said he was doing some last-minute Christmas
shopping and wanted some advice on getting a box of the best cigars he could
for his brother the President.  The salesman (who my friend knows well) was
only too happy to oblige, selling him a box of $160 cigars (I apologize for
not remembering the brand, but I'm mostly a pipe smoker and didn't pay
attention to the brand name when the story was told to me).  Anyway, the
salesman (who shall remain nameless) rang up the sale and chatted with Roger
Clinton for about ten minutes.  The two of them got along quite well and
discovered that they had some hobbies, interests, etc. in common.  The
salesman even gave Roger Clinton his business card, which happened to contain
not only his work phone # but his home phone # as well.  Anyway, Roger
finally said he needed to head over to the White House to celebrate Christmas
with his brother.  They wished each other a Merry Christmas and Roger
departed.  Shortly after that was closing time at the Tobacco Barn, and the
salesman closed up and headed home to tell his family about his famous
customer and to celebrate Christmas.
That's not the end of the story however.  About 1 a.m. on Christmas morning
the salesman's phone (at home) rings, and he answers it to hear Roger Clinton
on the phone.  Roger said he was sorry to bother him at home (he got his
phone # from the business card) but that the box of cigars he had bought (as
a Christmas gift for his brother Bill) was only one-half full.  The salesman
immediately realized that he must have mistakenly given Roger a box from
which some individual cigars had already been sold.  Roger said that his
brother (the Pres.) wanted to know if he could come right over with a fresh
box and drop them off at the White House west gate, as they had a few friends
over and Pres. Clinton needed the cigars right then.
The salesman told Roger he would try to do what he could.  After hanging up,
he called security at the Pentagon City mall and arranged for the night
watchman to meet him and let him in the building.  He then drove from his
home in suburban Virginia to the Pentagon City mall, picked up a fresh box of
cigars and then headed over to the White House, having second thoughts all
the way (keep in mind that he's driving into DC at around 1:45 a.m. on
Christmas morning).  He exchanged the "complete" box of cigars for the
partial box at the White House west gate as directed and went home and went
back to bed, thinking that that was finally the end of it.  Not quite,
though, because at around 7:00 a.m. his phone rings again, but this time it's
not Roger Clinton but President Bill Clinton, calling him to tell him how
much they all enjoyed the cigars and thanking him for his extra effort in
delivering the cigars to the White House. The salesman, who by this time was
wide awake again, thanked the President for calling him, they wished each
other a Merry Christmas and hung up.

That's the whole story, as I heard it.  Some of you may find it boring or not
believe it, but as I said, I heard it from a trustworthy friend.  I think
it's an interesting anecdote that some of you may enjoy.  I'm not trying to
start any political "flames" here either right or left, but I can't help but
wonder about two things:  (a) where was Hillary during all of this? (was she
one of the stogie smokers?), and (b) what ever happened to all the talk about
a "smoke-free" White House?  I doubt that Bill &amp; the boys were forced to go
out on the White House south lawn at 2:00 on Christmas morning to light up!
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed the story as much as I did.
Adios,
TSUJoe

I am brand new to The Pipe Digest. I must start by saying I am truly
impressed with the first correspondence that was sent to me. This clearly is
a quality organization.

To tell you a bit about myself, I am 30 years old and a customer service
manager with a large west coast telecommunications company. I am married and
have a 7 day old new baby girl. I have never smoked a pipe (yet!) but over
the past 2 years have become a fairly good cigar afficionado. At present, I
am really interested in what any of the members here have to suggest as to
what their favorite cigars are and why, and what mail order cigar clubs are
worth paying attention to. Any feedback would be appreciated.

I look forward to future correspondence with The Pipe Digest members.
   Happy (quality) smoking to all!!

<a name="26">Subject: Update, for what it's worth</a>

I read Pipe Digest faithfully each week, and applaud the steadily growing
numbers of new members. It's fun to read the initial contributions of the
newbies, and the ongoing installments from our more vocal puffers. Having
some spare time just now, I'll submit this update on how my smoking life is
faring.
Awhile back, I reported my big Dunhill blend score on a trip to Chicago.
Here's my take on the four blends I bought. The Standard blend has been the
least impressive. I smoke a pipeful here and there out of duty (waste not,
want not y'know), and the most I can say is it's not bad. It seems to have
dried out quicker than the other three, so I put the open tin inside one of
my cigar humidors, but haven't checked on it since. BTW, despite recent
Digest remarks, I can't perceive evidence of glycerol in any of these Dunhill
blends; maybe the reference was to bulk tobacco (regretfully unavailable at
the Alfred Dunhill store itself!).
The My Mixture 965 is okay as a general purpose smoke--at least it's more
flavorful than the Standard. But the best IMHO are Nightcap, which I do save
for late evening sessions with the mindless pap on TV, and Early Morning
Pipe, which is indeed often the first pipeful of the day, even though I
strive to wait until afternoon for the first spark-up. This is my first can
of Early Morning Pipe in 34 years. I know that because I bought my first can
along with my first Dunhill pipe (a tanshell sitter) while on my modest
honeymoon, May 1961. My bride and I, both unused to tobaccos outside the Half
&amp; Half and Amphora world, jokingly referred to it as Early Morning Dung.
Bride is now an ex, the sitter was also ill-starred, suffering a broken shank
(skillfully repaired by Ehrlich's in Boston with a handsome silver band) and
later lost altogether (moment of silence, please...).
Anyway, these blends afford me a welcome variety of tastes, but my strong
favorite smoke is still McClelland's bulk blend #2020, available through any
tobacconist that wants to take the trouble to order some for you. This stuff
is a rich matured Virginia flake you can rub out to suit your preference, and
burns to a dry white ash, leaving a very pleasant aroma in the room. I love
returning to my car after smoking 2020 in it.
Although cigar season doesn't start for me until I can hand out the porch
swing (here in Lansing MI) for balmy outdoors puffing, I did score a lucky
find during my most recent trip to Chicago (Evanston, actually). In a resale
shop I snagged a lovely cigar humidor, apparently unused, for $15.00. It had
a brass plate on the top, still blank which I've just had engraved with my
initials. The engraver, a cigar guy himself, is green with envy.
After years of guessing to myself (and aloud to curious friends) about just
how many pipes I actually own, I took a hands-on census last week and can now
admit to owning 280 pipes. There are probably a couple dozen drugstore-grade
items in that total, but I was kinda impressed by all the really solid (if
not collector-grade treasures) pieces I've accumulated over the past 39
years. These days I stick with my top-line pipes (Dunhills, Charatans,
Petersons, Nilssons, etc) for daily use, but all these Sasienis, Malagas,
Cellinis, Savinellis, CustomBilts, Doodlers, Velanis, Ben Wades and Stanwells
are darn good smokes, too. So many pipes, so little time...
BTW, I hope all you AOL members out there are aware of (and active on) the
pipes and cigars forum on AOL. I signed up for a maillist update, which I've
yet to receive, and have requested info from several Cigar-of-the-Month clubs
I first read about there.
I've seen occasional passing reference to Paul's Pipeshop in Flint MI, but
would like to alert you all to an annual event worth remembering. Paul
Spaniola celebrates his shop's anniversaries every July, by allowing a 50%
discount, towards the purchase of one pipe (his 50th anniversary was some
years ago). This sale will be on Wednesday July 12th this year. Furthermore,
if you are a Cayuga Pipe Club member (get your card by buying at least one
Cayuga pipe, Paul's in-store brand), you can, at any time during July get 50%
off one pipe or 40% off two pipes. BTW, Paul showed me through his storeroom
awhile back, and I was astounded at the depth of his big-name pipe stock not
even on display. Here's the full ID on Paul's:
     Paul's Pipe Shop
     647 S Saginaw Street
     Flint MI 48502
     810-235-0581

Guess that's enough smokescreen for now. Thanks again, Steve, for this great
service to us puffers.

Dear Steve:

In reference to a digest reader's recent question on "casings", may I offer
this brief explaination, derived from the "Dictionary of Tobacco
Terminology," pulished in 1980 by Philip Morris. I've tried to keep the
techno-bable to a minimum. CASINGS are a mixture of hygroscopic agents or
humectants (ingredients added to tobacco to help it retain moisture and
plasticity: for example glycerin, glycols) and flavoring agents applied to
tobacco to condition it for processing to reduce breakage, facilitiate
cutting, etc. Flavors applied to tobacco AFTER it has been processed and
dried -- usually as it is cooling -- are known as TOP FLAVORINGS or TOP
CASINGS. These are volatile (quick evaporating) flavors.

On a lighter note, thought you might find the following article amusing. It
appeared in the June 4, 1925 issue of TOBACCO, an industry trade magazine now
in its 108th year. 

Is Still Another Cigar Slogan Needed by the Trade?

So many people in the cigar business have objected to the present slogan of
the trade, "After All, Nothing Satisfies Like a Good Cigar," that it is
proposed by interested folk to change the phrase, and get something snappy.

One of the proposals, and now in use by Wertheimer Brothers, is the "Be a Man
-- Smoke Cigars" originated by Leonard Wertheimer. Still another selection
offered has been "Cigars -- A Man's Smoke," by Stern, Mendelsohn 
Co., which is somewhat similar to the Wertheimer slogan.

In Grand Rapids, though, Claude Wykes who has given a lot of thought
to the cigar business and its troubles through his connection with the cigar
fixture business of the Loudon Manufacturing Co., suggests "What's Better
Than a Good Cigar."

It is  good slogan. But the fact is, almost any old slogan is a good
 slogan if advertised enough. "Pillsbury's Best" isn't much of a slogan, as
slogans go, and yet it helped to create, through years and years of
repetition, one of the largest, if not the largest, flour mills in the world.

Same too, with "Say It With Flowers!" It is good slogan, a fine slogan, but
what would it have amoiunted to if the florists hand't spent a fortune
putting it over these last several years?

"Save the Surface and You Save All!" is a pretty appropriate paint sloga. And
the paint trade, to make it go, has advertised it completely -- and
expensively.

Outside of the General Cigar Co., and very few other firms and organziations
in the cigar business, no one ever took hold of the "After All" slogan with
any persitence. And it's persistence which put over everything -- even
slogans. Even cigar slogans.

(Seventy years later, how many Americans actually know the current industry
slogan, "Relax -- Enjoy A Cigar"?)

Brief introduction.

I was extremely excited to find an Email list devoted to my favorite
past time. I am 33 year (as of the Ides of March) and am currently
between gigs while I try and figure out what to do with my life. The
resulting contemplations are a perfect time to relax and have a cigar.

Although I am hesitant to share the following cigar preference (lower
availability and higher price), they are just too good to keep to
myself. Credo is producing some cigars that are, simply, unbelievable.
The only cigar that I have EVER found that can exceed either the Credo
Athanor or Parthagoras is a true Cuban Romeo y Julietta Churchill.

They are quite expensive, but Mike's in Miami has them for a fairly
reasonable price. I would strongly suggest that those of you who
appreciate a milder smoke (along the lines of a Macanudo Cafe) grab a
couple. They won't disappoint.

I have been VERY glad that Cigar Afficianado has not seen fit yet to
rate this fine brand as it has helped to keep demand under control.

Greetings,

I am happy to have discovered this group because I realize that I have no
knowledge whatsoever of tabaccos and their individual charecteristics.
I am a complete newcomer when it comes to pipe smoking.  I recently
purchased a cheap estate pipe and a couple ounces of a mild burley blend at
my local tobacconist.  (The original Tinder Box in Santa Monica, CA)
That was a couple weeks ago, and today I bought a non flavored mild English
blend called Baker Street Mild.   Both of these are mixtures only available
at this particular location.

 The English blend I perchased is quite enjoyable to me-the salesman let me
pack up a pipefull and light up to see if I liked it before buying.
....Kind of reminds me of my favorite pub, one that lets you sample a small
amount of a fine brew before ordering a draught in your preferred size.  I
actually prefer the unflavored english blend to the flavored burley,
although both are quite mild.  If I remember correctly, the Baker St.
Mixture consists of Virginia with a small amount of Pirique(sp?).   I am
wondering if there is a complete volume somewhere either on or off line
that describes all of the different varieties used in pipe mixtures.  This
way I would know what people are talking about when they mention Bengel
Slices, Cavendish, Latakia or burley (or Virginia or Turkish and on and
on).  I enjoy a hobby that requires, or at least invites you to learn about
the finer complexities.  I have always enjoyed fine beers and coffees for
that reason.

What about the FAQ I have heard so much about?  How do I get ahold of it?
Maybe at a URL?  I would try a WWW search of some kind, but a specific URL
would be quicker.

One final question, are there any pipe (and Cigar) friendly
clubs/lounges/bars etc in the west side area of LA?  I live in Santa
Monica, and I doubt if there are too many here.  If anyone knows of any I
would greatly appreciate the info.

Anyway, thanks for this digest, and happy smoking...
N. Brown

Dear Steve and all,

Thanks for the list and the work you do on it. I have managed to
download and read most of the old Digests and have enjoyed them very
much.  My history of smoking a pipe covers about 40 years. I decided
when I was around 15 that I wanted to smoke a pipe. I lived in a small
town in SW Virginia and the only pipes available were Medico, Yello
Bole, and Kaywoodie. How's that for some old and forgotten or possibly
never heard of names. Anyway I got a Yello Bole and some Sir Walter
Raliegh and began smoking a pipe. It didn't work. The pipe soon became
soggy and nasty and I gave it up.

Not much later I went to Roanoke for a Boy Scout Jamboree and found
myself at Milan Brothers. I know one of the brothers was Ellis and I
believe the other was George (memory failing.) Anyway George ? was
very helpful and sugested that, since I could not afford an
appropriate number of pipes to permit a proper rotation, I should try
a Kirsten pipe. I bought a Kirsten Companion for $2.95 and some of
their house tobacco. I was much more successful with this and actually
became a pipe smoker. I think George gave me very good advice and pass
it on to new smokers on the list.

When I went to college I bought my first "good pipe", an oversize
Charatan Special which I picked up at Royal Cigar Company in Atlanta
for $32.50. Since then I have accumulated more than 300 pipes. I
prefere the pipes of Italy and most of my pipes are from Italy. Becker
and Costello are the favorites. For everyday use I still smoke
Kirstens-only smoke my better pipes when I am home.  It is the only
pipe I know of that you can smoke steadily with little attention
without deterioration of flavor and getting soggy.

As for tobacco I pretty much smoke only flakes. I wish I could find a
loose tobacco with the flavor of flakes but I have never been able
to. My all time favorite tobacco was Ashton Black Parrot which at
least at the present time is not available. McClelland is in the
process of developing the complete range of Ashton tobacco and
hopefully it will be on the market again soon. I have a can of their
first effort at Black Parrot to test-they haven't got it yet. I smoke
and enjoy most of the McClelland 20xx bulk tobaccos and a tobacco
called Fader Flake which I get from Fader's in Baltimore.

More the next time.

Dear Steve:

I want to tell everybody about the greatest cigar and pipe store in San
Diego. They have the largest selection of cigars I have ever seen.  The first
time I walked into their humidor I could not believe my eyes.  The shelves
were crammed with lots of cigars, some I had never seen before.  Cigar boxes
are stacked all the way to the ceiling, with a large table in the middle of
the humidor with more cigars on top of and below it.  It was enough to make a
grown man weep with joy.

Charles Hennegan, the owner, set up chairs in the middle of the store so that 
customers can have a seat and smoke with other cigar and pipe enthusiasts. The 
store also has a large selection of quality pipes and tobaccos. The name and
phone number of this find is:

Dear Steve -

Just finished perusing the latest Digest, which I downloaded earlier today.
 I enjoyed reading Antti Kalioski's account of summertime camping in Lapland.
 The bit about the insects sounds a lot like what happens when you go to
Alaska during the same time of year!  BTW, Antti - I wonder if it would be
even worse in Karelia.  Also found Mr. Brandstetter's posting informative re.
the 9 mm. filters (I knew there had to be a drawback!).  Thanks also to Bob
Hamlin for the info on tobacco storage.  I've found that ziplock bags are
also useful, but there's a catch.  I used to use plain old ziplocks, which I
thought would be adequate - until I discovered that the tobacco would often
get dried out just sitting around.  Now I use ziplock freezer bags, and this
is no longer a problem.  What I found out was that the plastic in the regular
ziplocks is thin enough that air will actually pass through, which doesn't
happen with the freezer variety because they're made with thicker plastic
(and the seals are also stronger).  Anyway, Bob's tips for long-term storage
are handy, especially for those of us who cellar more than a pound or two.  I
myself have been doing a lot of cellaring over the
past year because there's something to be said for letting tobacco age, and
besides, one never knows what might happen with excise taxes (or worse
things).

I've been getting more positive feedback from my EPA article.  Seems my work
is becoming widely known in the smokers' rights circles, and it's gratifying
to at least be doing something that helps our cause.  This brings me to
Arthur Greenwald's posting in the last Digest.  His comments miss the mark,
and require a rebuttal (and thank you for leaving the door open for me to do
this).  Mr. Greenwald says "it's worse than futile to argue against the idea
that smoking and second-hand smoke are potentially damaging to people's
health.  First of all, the basic scientific evidence is quite consistent and
scientifically compelling. Anyone who smokes and thinks otherwise is fooling
him or herself."

For starters, when it comes to the effects of smoking on the smoker I have
NEVER claimed that smoking is without risk.  What I take exception to is the
failure to make valid distinctions.  There is a vast difference between the
degree of risk inherent in cigarette smoking and that from pipe and cigar
smoking.  This is a FACT reflected in the medical literature.  What is at
issue is the nature and extent of the risk, as well as factors that can
mitigate it.  The data on the health effects of pipe and cigar smoking is not
nearly as consistent as Mr. Greenwald seems to think.  Having examined a fair
amount of the medical literature on the subject, I can attest to this. 

What I argue is that our choices should be driven by a fair and accurate
understanding of the situation, a process that is often hindered by those who
are in a position of supposed trust.  Contrary to what many would like to
believe, scientists and doctors are not high priests passing down the word of
God.  They are human beings, subject to the all the foibles of human nature.
 If Mr. Greenwald puts unquestioning faith in the pronouncements of the
health establishment, then he leaves himself wide open to the pitfalls
created by an area of science that has been highly politicized.  I therefore
find it ironic that he invokes the name of C. Everett Koop in stating his
case.  Dr. Koop singlehandedly turned the office of the Surgeon General into
a springboard for anti-tobacco advocacy.  His reporting on the health effects
of smoking did away with any concept of fairness concerning pipe and cigar
smoking.  This was accomplished by misrepresenting the findings of medical
studies, as well as ignoring information which refuted his position.  This is
not a fiction on my part,
but is reflected by information that is a matter of public record.

As for environmental tobacco smoke, the science is anything but "consistent
and scientifically compelling."  The charges leveled against the EPA in my
article are not mine alone, but come from numerous competent sources.  Mr.
Greenwald is correct in stating that the field of scientific research is
complex.  The serious flaws in the EPA report are, however due to the
violation of things fundamental to good science.  These fundamentals have
been developed over hundreds of years of empirical inquiry.  The fact that
they have worked well enough to provide reasonable reliability is the basis
for our acceptance of scientific findings.  When these standards are
compromised, as they were by the EPA and its Science Advisory Board,
intellectual honesty suffers.  This is a poor basis for making public policy
- no matter what the target is.  The idea that such a compromise is
acceptable because the subject is tobacco constitutes a very valid reason for
critically examining the motivations and methods of those who seek to
influence human behavior.

My article does not attempt to get into the scientific intricacies precisely
because the conduct of the EPA and SAB ignored the very basics of proper
scientific practice.  The violation of these basics, and the influence of
politics on the outcome of the EPA's ETS risk assessment is what I reported
on.  I have no interest in a mindlessly contrarian sniping at authority, and
I wrote the piece only because there is a substantive basis for questioning
the exercise of power by the EPA in pursuing an anti-smoking agenda.  Many
people have told me that my article contains information which is more than
sufficient to support this argument.  If Mr. Greenwald feels otherwise, then
I don't know what it would take to satisfy him.

He also expresses the idea that the Pipes Digest is not the place for this
kind of topic.  The anti-smokers have been given wide exposure through the
media, while there are few forums available to the opposition - and this is
one of 'em.  In fact this is an ideal forum because 
a). it permits an exchange of information among people who do not want to see
their pursuit
regulated out of existence, and b). it allows us to do this without getting
flamed for doing so. The Digest does indeed give us a way to share the
pleasures of our pastime, and I truly enjoy this camraderie.  But the Digest
also has been a place where there is the FREEDOM to air more activist views.
 Mr. Masticola has recognized the importance of providing a forum for a
diverse discussion of things relating to pipes and cigars, and he has not
shied away from the tackling of serious subjects.  If it were otherwise, then
I would certainly not be presumptuous enough to impose myself on the
membership of this group.

Basically I am a peaceable man.  I would like nothing better than to be left
alone so that I can live - and enjoy - my life as I see fit.  Since I have
been intruded upon by people who are much more than the "busy-bodies"
described by Mr. Greenwald, I've been forced to fight.  I consider myself
lucky that my upbringing and education led me to value and engage in 
critical, independent thought.  In the 16 years that I have been a pipe
smoker I've seen smoking become demonized and subject to increasingly
extremist attacks.  As an independent thinker I have refused to accept this
without challenge, choosing instead to see for myself what would be revealed
by delving into as much information as possible.  By engaging in the debate
on this level I have come across many things that provide ample reason for
taking action in our defense.    

There are those who find the politics of smoking to be a boring subject.
 There are others who think that if we pretend like nothing's wrong the
anti-smoking movement will somehow go away.  Perhaps these people don't care
whether or not we'll be able to continue smoking in the future.  Point is
that, like it or not, we are ALL part of the battle.  We can either
realize this and defend ourselves, or we can do nothing and hope that someone
else will fight for us.  I regret the fact that Mr. Greenwald finds this
attitude "strident", but we are where we are because too many people have
been uninformed and uninvolved.  Any risks entailed with pipe and cigar
smoking are offset by the intangible benefits that come with the pleasure and
relaxation of our experience.  The question of whether or not the benefits
are worth the risk is a subjective one, but today's society is obsessed with
the illusion of "safety".  Our ability to make choices for ourselves has been
attacked by an absolutism which preaches that all avoidable risk is
excessive.  This has resulted in a campaign of social engineering where
anything goes as long as the desired goal is reached.  Such an abuse of
authority and power is inexcusable regardless of the cause, and we have a
right to oppose it.  My concern is to share information so that we can do so
in a substantive, factual manner. 

Best Regards,

Steve J. (Briar Man)

<a name="36">Subject: Several questions</a>

Hi Steve,
     I hope all's going well.  I'm enjoying the postings &amp; information in the
Internet Pipe Digest.  I have several questions to ask.  
     The first is how is it possible to obtain some of the more recent back
issues of the Pipe Digest?  If it is indeed possible, could you e-mail some
of them to me?
     The 2nd question is somewhat related.  Do you know how I might subscribe
to the other Internet pipe-related mailing list, which is called "alt.pipes"
or something like that?  I'm still somewhat of a computer on-line neophyte,
so please explain it as if you were talking to a novice and not a computer
science major.
     Lastly, I'm always interested in new pipe-related gadgets, accessories,
etc.  Specifically, what lighters, tampers, etc. do other readers use &amp;
recommend.  I've learned that regardless of what I might now be using,
someone else usually has a "better mousetrap" of some sort or another.  I
just recently treated myself to a new pipe lighter (an ITT Corona) and am
very pleased with it so far.  I lost my Colibri lighter about two years ago
and have been using Bic cigarette lighters ever since.  This new ITT Corona
is really nice!
  
     Take care &amp; good smoking!
     Joe Hurley

Keep up the good work. Just finished reading #179 while puffing on the 1994
Ascorti Christmas Pipe.  What follows are some NEWSBITS&gt;

******************************************************************************

Dateline: Richmond, VA  28 Feb 1995
The CORPS met at  Universal Leaf Tobacco Corp. and 15 members enjoyed the
lively discussion concerning sandblasted pipes.  Considerable discussion
about the beauty and smokeability of the sandblasts, and John Eels (pipe
carver and reconditioner) explained many of the techniques. He showed some of
his work in various stages of completion.  John explained that softer briar
is easier to work with and creates the most pleasing paterns.

It was speculated that probably Dunhill started the technique back in 1926
and it was, still is, called the Dunhill Shell.  Dunhill had a patent on the
technique.

The Conclave of Richmond Pipe Smokers discussed their plans to attend the New
York Pipe Show (to be held in New Jersey) and the Charlotte, N.C. Show.
 Also, a series of meetings was scheduled to plan the CORPS SHOW in October.
 Be sure to mark Columbus Day weekend on your calendars.

The St.Louis show was briefly explored, but the members in attendance were
not sure of their calendars and an "organized club trip" will be brought up
at a future meeting.  The important point......everyone in attendance is
aware of the show and it shall be promoted in the News Letter  or on the Pipe
Line.

Lynwood Hines reported that the CORPS Show had been reported in several
publications:
The Tobacconist Magazine,  Richmond Times Dispatch, and the newsletter of
Peter Stokkebye International.  BTW, mbr. Norman Winokur's double-bowl
P.Sokkebye pipe was awarded "The Best Pipe in Show".  

******************************************************************************

THE NEW YORK PIPE CLUB  THIRD ANNUAL  CONVENTION...................
will take place at the Ramada Hotel Newark International Airport. (Newark,
N.J.)
Festivities start Friday, March 17, 8PM with a "Welcome Reception" and the
show will end Sunday, March 19.....5 PM.  I have been to one of the earlier
two editions.  Its a good show. I purchased several bargains, including two
identical shape LARSENS....one smooth, the other sandblast.  Both are good
smokes.

******************************************************************************

LOCATION CHANGE: (to benefit the resource guide, if not already adjusted)

NML PIPES DIRECT
PO Box 31194
Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33420

(407) 627-2783

******************************************************************************

Anyway, I am at the bottom of the bowl and that's it for my current
contribution.

Steve:

A short note to correct a typo in my original (earlier) note to the readers
of Pipe Digest.  The first sandblasts by Dunhill date back to 1916.... not
1926.  I hope this will appear in the same issue....before I get "blasted". 

The Plus mentioned above refers to Saturday, April 8.
This is the day and date of  The Carolina Briar Friar's Pipe Show.

It is a small, but very active and pleasant show. Lots of trading.
Its taking place just south of Charlotte, N.C..... Fort Mill, S.C.
Ramada Inn at Carowinds ( a Paramount Theme Park)

<a name="41">Subject: Maryland Smoking Ban</a>

Dear Steve and fellow pipists,

  For those of you who have not heard, Maryland is about to impose America's
strictest anti-smoking law to date.  This law bans smoking in all workplaces.
I understand, without having seen the actual text, that smoke-shops are
excluded.  There is a movement in the state legislature to grant exemptions to
restaurants and bars, but the exemptions have not been voted upon yet, while
the full ban passed last year.  Yet another reason to move out of Maryland,
once known as the Free State...  (The other reasons - taxes, taxes, taxes, ...,
but I digress.)

  On a brighter note, the Bliesener family spent February 25 exploring northern
Philadelphia, where I discovered the pleasures of Tobacco Village.  Note to
Steve: the resource guide has the address as Roosevelt Mall (which is actually
an outdoor shopping center - I was under dressed for the weather).  It should
read:

  Tobacco Village
  Northeast Plaza
  7300 Bustleton Avenue
  (Cottman &amp; Bustleton Avenues)
  Philadelphia, PA 19149
  (215) 745-7040

The proprietors, Irv Lupoff and Louise Hood-Lupoff were very pleasant,
knowledgeable, and helpful.  I purchased and inexpensive half-bent pipe called
a Main Street (attractive Lucite mouthpiece, Corsican Briar) for $24 and a tin
of MacBaren's Virginia #1.  They have a wall full of pipes in ranging in price
from under $20 to over $250 and a very extensive collection of commercial and
in-house tobaccos.  The commercial tobaccos included Dunhill, McClelland,
MacBaren, and many others that escape my aging memory.  They encourage everyone
to try a bowlful of any of their in-house tobaccos.  I tried Black Velvet - it
was nothing to get too excited over.  They also have cigars, but no walk in
humidor.  

				Smoky regards,
				Gary Bliesener

Again, this Digest has rather sparse punning commentary, but I feel
that our members have more than made up for what Your Moderator has
left out! There are a couple of administrative natterings in this
issue, but I'll leave that for the letters.

One minor question: We will probably break the 1000-member mark in the
next couple of issues. What can we do to celebrate? Any suggestions?
Maybe just light up and enjoy! -S.

Thank you for placing me on the mailing list. 

I am an undergraduate at Harvard University and i enjoy a good pipe or a 
good cigar every now and then.

My tobacconist of choice is Leavitt &amp; Peirce in Harvard Square. It's a

<a name="3">Subject: Thanks for the welcome!</a>

Thanks for welcoming me to the mail list! FIrst off, is the above add. the
correct place to mail stuff for the digest, or to generally yak? (preceeding
sentence can be deleted if desired when publishing).
My name is Mike, I live in Vancouver, BC Canada.  I am a self-employed
chimney sweep, who also does a little DTP on the side. I have been a pipe
smoker for about 25 yrs. I have a small collection of pipes, mostly bents,
and all fiercly guarded from strangers &lt;g&gt;! I prefer the bents (either 1/2
or full) as I am in the bush a lot: hiking, camping, running my whippets.
Keeps me in shape, and allows me time to enjoy "the blue" without haranguing
from others. My wife smokes (cigs), and doesn't mind my pipe one bit (no pun
). As for tobaccos, my pref. seems to run to mediums, with light Latakia or
perique tangs, and Burley/English body. This not only makes for an enjoyable
smoke, but also a reasonably "sociable" one. I have used MacBaren's quite a
bit over the years, but like to blend my own better than store bought. I
tend to not smoke at work (g), but rather once I am in the comfort of
hearth, home, and bouncing canines. There is limited selection of
tobacconists establishments here on the WET coast, RJ Clark (the best in
town), and Sheffield &amp; sons being the major players. Therefore, I have to
resort to "drug store" smoke when I am out of town and don't have a supply
of my regular (I forgot to pack it), or want a different smoke, to round out
my palette (this is what I say, my wife says it is AGAIN because I forgot to
pack it!). I don't like to buy large quantities because I find that it goes
a bit sour on me. This could be storage. I use a glass-lid, bail-wire
closure mason jar, and use a piece of bread or potato once in a while. I
don't leave the moisteners in too long, so that mould might develop. The
storage temperature is around the 60F mark. Even with this, I still find
that the taste suffers if left for more than a month. If I am doing
something wrong, I would like to hear about it.

&gt;From out of "the Blue", 
Mike

<a name="5">Subject: Nat Sherman Cigars</a>

Hello,
I'm a new member to the Pipes Digest, so I'll give some info about myself 
first.  I'm a senior at Cornell University, majoring in anatomy and 
physiology, and have been smoking pipes and cigars for a couple of years.  I 
prefer mild smokes with both, and would welcome any and all suggestions for 
pipe blends or cigars.

One of my favorite cigars is from Nat Sherman's in NYC, the Host selection 
in the Hunter size.  It is extremely smooth, with a "fruity and nutty" 
flavor.  I was wondering if anyone could recommend a similar type of cigar; 
I've tried a couple of other brands at random and they were a little too 
strong and harsh for me.

My favorite pipe blend (so far) is also from Shermans - the Golden Virginia 
#580.  As with the cigar, I was wondering if anyone could suggest a similar 
blend.  I'm about 250 miles from NYC, and cannot get to their store too 
often.  I also would like to experiment with different smokes.  By the way, 
they have a good cigar catalog, and their phone number is 1-800-MY CIGAR.  
The store is on the corner of Fifth Ave. and 55th St.  If at the store, ask 
for Zeke.  He was an extremely helpful and knowledgeable salesman.

I've enjoyed reading all of the posts in the Digest.  I particularly like 
the how-to's and FAQ's (since I'm a beginner, probably).  Keep up the
good work! 
                                                   Tom

P.S. This is my first posting to the mailing list, so I'm not sure if this 
is the way to post something :-).

Valts:  the above Club is not new and has been active for several years, even
longer if you consider than many of the current active members participated
in the former and prestigious "All Pipe Smoking Chinese Gourmet and Large
Foot Society" during the 1980's, which was organized by Dennis DiPiazza. As
you correctly noted, Mike Reschke (708) 620-5033, is the
President-by-Default. He and Mike Hipwell have been organizing the meetings
for the past several years. What is new about this Club is the latest in what
seems to be temporary meeting places: Ramada (soon to be Radisson) Northbrook
(northern Chicago suburb); and we have our first newsletter! It features:
updates on event s around the country, spotlight on a collection (this last
one was the over one hundred of previous ly unseen Buteras owned by John
Goldberg), regular columns on books, other literature and antiques. Another
special in the last issue was a directory of Online pipe connections. As the

<a name="7">Subject: Maryland Law</a>

Here in California, A.B.13, by Democratic Assemblyman Terry Friedman of
Hollywood, has banned smoking in enclosed workplaces since Jan. 1 of this
year. I don't think that includes bars, etc. I knew there was a more
restrictive smoking law passed here recently, but it came to light at the
Chino City Council meeting tonight. I cover the city for a regional
newspaper, and the council voted on a plan to enforce the law. All cities
are required to designate an agency to enforce it, under the state law.
Yes, another unfunded mandate for those who have that ax to grind. The city
apparently gets part of the fines, probably in the same forumla as speeding
and other moving violations, according to the city attorney.

I went to a restaurant recently where I asked if we were in the smoking
section, because we weren't asked "smoking or non" when we came in. The
hostess said it's only allowed at the bar.

The city attorney in Chino was unclear about the scope of restaurant
restrictions, but it definitely includes most businesses.

I suppose a restriction would be OK in common areas, like our newsroom, but
this includes private offices and everything.

Does the Maryland law include bars? If so that is pretty damn restrictive.
In any case, here in California it's a misdomeanor offense, but the smoker
isn't the one punished. It's the establishment which fails to ban smoking
inside. Not sure however, if California includes smoke shops. Anyone?

	Thank you, Steve, for adding me to the Pipes Digest subscription
list.  It is a grand thing you are doing.
	A bit about me.  I'm 52 years old and have been a fulltime
freelance writer and editor most of the time since I graduated from Ohio
State with an English Ph.D. in the mid-70s--the depth of the academic
depression.  I have been smoking a pipe since 1964, when I entered my M.A.
program.  (Visions of being a pipe-smoking English professor.  Oh well,
I'm batting .500.)  I smoke mostly large pipes and have been upgrading my
collection over the years so that the 30 or so pipes I smoke are mostly
the higher-grade Italians as well as some Charatons and Ashtons.  I
addition, I have taken up pipe restoration (not repair!) as a
therapeutic hobby, so I have about 300 like-new (sterilized, waxed, etc.)
pipes sitting in cases in my basement that I attempt to sell or swap from
time to time.  If anybody is looking for something special, I might just
have.  Having discovered that burly bites my tongue, I smoke Windsor from
Barclay Pipe and Tobacco here in Columbus.  It is an aged Virginia with a
bit of Perique.
	I am also the secretary/treasurer/newsletter editor (old fashioned
paper and the U.S. mails) of the Ohio Pipe Collectors.  I produce our
quarterly newsletter, which I attempt to fill with good information.  We
are in our third year now, and, for the past two, we have put on a one-day
swap/sell pipe show in Columbus.  We hope to continue doing so, although
we're trying to figure out how to do so on the cheap, since our dues are
only $12 per year, pro-rated for the month someone joins.  If any Digest
readers, especially from Ohio, think they might be interested in joining
the OPC, please E-mail me your name and mailing address, and I will get a comp
copy of the last newsletter into the mail.
	That's more than enough for now, I guess.  It's really great to be
hooked up to you, Steve, and all the others who share in our hobby.

<a name="9">Subject: Hygrometer? Phooey!</a>

Steve, much has been written about humidity in Pipes Digest and elsewhere.
I've often read recommendations for the use of digital
thermometer/humiditiy devices sold by Radio Shack and others.  I want to
report the result of some recent experiments to assess the usefulness of
these devices.

These experiments were conducted by Mr. Fred Dickens, a physicist retired
from Bell Laboratories.  To do these studies he used the commercially
available digital thermometer/hygrometer mentioned above.  As his reference
standard he used a wet/dry dual bulb cyclometer.  The thermometers were
Bell Laboratory grade.  This is the laboratory standard for all
measurements of relative humidity.  The cyclometer was slung for at least
2.5 minutes.  The comparison was done indoors and outdoors (in shade).

Multiple measurements in multiple locations on multiple days showed that
the digital thermometer was highly accurate.  The digital hygrometer was 20
- 25% inaccurate at all times.  The error was not uniform.  Sometimes it
read higher, other times lower.

Fred reports, anecdotally, that Bell Labs tried to use "precision" guages
and found them to have poor accuracy too.

Perhaps the compulsion to measure relative humidity in our humidors should
be moderated.  A device that is this inaccurate does not provide any useful
information. Let's skip the digital hygrometers and use the savings to buy
some first rate stogies!

<a name="10">Subject: Paul's Pipe Shop/Flint, MI</a>

	I saw mention of Paul's Pipe Shop in Flint, Michigan, and was
reminded of my visit to it last summer.  I promised Mr. Spanioli to
write to you of his wonderful shop, and I now realize, with shame,
that I never did so.
	I first read of Paul's Pipe Shop and Pipe Hospital in this 
list.  I live in Ann Arbor, about 50 miles from Flint, and since I 
had heard of the pipe museum there, and never seen one, I decided to 
visit.
	I'm unfamiliar with Flint, so it took me a long time to wend my
way around Flint until I got to the downtown.  I haven't the foresight
to take directions... but finally I turned down a cobblestone street 
called Saginaw Street, and, quite by surprise, saw a sign: "Paul's
Pipe Shop and Pipe Hospital".  I wasn't sure I'd found the right place,
but I was ready for a stop, and so I went in.  It was the right place,
all right.
	The shop was empty except for an elderly man and what seemed to
be his assistant.  I browsed for a little while, then finally asked
the elderly man about his museum.
	"I'm Paul Spanioli," he introduced himself (the name meant
nothing to me), and I gave him my name.  It turns out you can't just 
traipse through the museum, you have to take the guided tour.
	Which he gave himself, for my exclusive benefit.
	I asked him about pipe smoking contests, and it was the right
question; he beamed, and explained that he was the world record holder
for world pipe smoking contests.  He proved it, too.  His museum
includes the pipes of all of the world record holders, and sure
enough, his name was under 6 of the pipes.  The first of his victories
was in 1951, the last in 1992.  He also designed the "official
tobacco", he told me.  He invented the concept of a contest to see how
long you can keep 3 grams of tobacco lit, using at most 2 matches.
	He showed me pictures and pipes used by Susan Hayworth, who
needed to smoke a pipe for a movie, and Harry S Truman, and many of
his personal star and long time friend, Mr. Charles S. Mott, auto 
executive and philanthropist, founder of the C S Mott Children's
Hospital, which is here in Ann Arbor at the University of Michigan.
	He showed me a pipe made for him with a compass embedded "so I
wouldn't get lost", he said.  He had granite pipes, cherry,
sandalwood, clay, metal (ouch!) and of course briar and meershaum 
pipes.
	He has many carved pipes, one in the image of President Truman
that I remember.
	The guided tour is necessary.  His museum is not very organized;
it is packed far tighter than it deserves, with many of the best
displays in drawers.  There is nothing of security.  I would shudder
to think of people walking away with souvenirs, to later forget or
sell for low prices at garage sales.  Also, a personal guided tour
from such a knowledgeable and interesting pipe smoker is not to be
disdained!  I listened, spellbound as a child, to this man's
reminiscinces.  There was no fee, there were no souvenirs, he's
written no books (which disappointed me, as I couldn't even buy one
and ask for an autograph), just an amazing hour or so of a remarkable
education.  I'm sure he would have talked for much longer, but he is
an old man, and he was growing tired.
	Not too tired, though, he sent me to my car for my pipe, and
filled it for me, making sure I saw how he was doing it (little bit at
a time, tap and fill and tap and fill, then drill a hole through the
center with a pipe tool).  I bought a couple of half pounds of vanilla
blends (which were very good), thanked him sincerely, and departed.
	My apologies for not relating this earlier, when it was fresher
in my memory.  Instead I've relied on a few notes I took, and missed
much of what was so interesting about the tour.
	It was a wonderful experience.  If you are ever in Michigan, be
sure to stop by.  I will certainly return some day.

	I know the address is in the resource guide, but here it is again
just so you don't have to look it up:

	Paul's Pipe Shop and Pipe Hospital

Dear Steve,

[Administrativa deleted. -S. ]

I thought I would pass along a pleasant cigar-smoking surprise in the form of 
the Bering Cazadores.  These are quite inexpensive, and don't have the most 
elegant-looking wrapper, but they have a nice draw, burn evenly, and taste 
pretty good (outstanding...and, they are mild!).  

Also, for anyone who is in or near midtown Manhattan, the JR Tobacco retail 
store is a great place to buy singles to try.  The prices are lower than in 
most shops, and they often have in stock brands that are out of stock in the 
catalog warehouse in North Carolina.  The store is on 45th between Madison and
5th.  I'm fortunate enough to be on a consulting assignment on 45th just a 
couple of blocks away.

There were a few postings on alt.smokers.cigars over the last couple of 
weeks regarding tobacco farms in Connecticut.  I wonder if there's anyone 
else on the net who worked on those farms, as I did.  When I was growing 
up in a town in the Farmington River valley, there were many more 
independent shade tobacco farms than there are now, and they employed 14- 
and 15-year-old boys and girls each summer.  The boys picked the leaves and 
packed them into canvas baskets; the girls worked in the sheds, stringing the 
leaves onto laths which were then hung from beams.  I will always remember 
the aroma emanating from sheds while the natural-gas heaters on the shed floor 
warmed the air to aid in drying the leaves...wonderful!  Maybe that's why I 
took up cigars 25 years later! 

Many thanks for your help.  Keep up the great work!

Yours in the smokers' brotherhood,

Paul

Dear Steve,
	I was looking over the last digest and your reaction to the
"spamming" problem, where someone send a subscriber of the digest an
advertisement via e-mail. I appreciate that the digest is your idea
and you do most of the work, however, I feel your reac tion was
overkill.
	Since this seems to be the first offense, wouldn't a slap on
the hand be enough? It appears that you are an "old-timer" on the
'net. Like it or not, commercial ventures are now paying for most of
the net operations. What started as a way for professors and others to
share ideas has become a world-wide communications network. I think we
are all going to have to get used to advertising. We don't control
what the postman puts in our box in front of our house. Don't get me
wrong, I don't want a huge amount
 of junk e-mail waiting for me, but like the old song goes..."The
times they are a-changin'." Please don't take this as a "flame," just
a difference of opinion. Keep up the good work on the digest.

Sincerely,

Bruce Perrussel

<a name="12">Subject: Advertising</a>

Hi, Bruce,

There are several problems with the approach you have suggested.

First of all, one of my primary concerns in running the Digest is to
protect the privacy of the mailing list. I don't think the members
would like the consequences if, say, the antismokers got hold of
it. 

Mr. Alfano found a way to invade the privacy of the members.  Because
of his spamming, another member seemed concerned that I was _selling_
the list. In order to maintain the trust and respect of the members, I
felt that I must send a message to future spammers that their actions
would not be tolerated.

Second, Mr. Alfano had the option to send me a brief, tasteful message
on his humidor kits, which I would have happily put in the Digest and
circulated to the full membership. I have done this before with other
product announcements. Instead, Mr. Alfano chose to capture part of
the membership list and spam it. He could have done it the right way,
but he chose instead to do it the wrong way.

Third, there is some background information of which you are probably
not aware. Mr. Alfano sent me an apology, which at first appeared
sincere. I replied with a list of conditions under which I would
reinstate him and withdraw my objections to ??????????@???.???.
Basically, these conditions amounted to issuing an apology copied to
myself, ??????????@???.???, and all the people he spammed. I believe
these were fair. However, he did not do this; I must therefore assume
that he was not as contrite as he had seemed.

Fourth, while there is a place for advertising on the net, I do not
believe that it should be in the form of unsolicited junk mail. Web
pages and FTP sites do just fine for that sort of thing, and only
those who want the advertising see it. A lot of people pay per byte
for their mail, and do not want junk email cluttering up their
feeds. The people who own and operate the facilities also pay for the
junk mail, as well as the wanted information.

Fifth, I do not agree that junk email must be inevitable.  I have
personally had to take an unlisted number to prevent junk phone calls
from distracting me at home. Radio, TV, and snailmail are full of
junk. Must we also submit this new medium to the will of the
hucksters?

Finally, what sort of "slap on the wrist" would you suggest? And how
would it deter others who want to capture the mailing list and spam
it?

I regret that Mr. Alfano forced me to take a rather distasteful
action, but I believe that I have done the right thing.

I'll post your letter, and this reply, in the Digest. If some member
can suggest a better way to handle this sort of thing in the future,
I'd be glad to take it under advisement.

- Steve.

<a name="13">Subject: Additional discussions</a>

Steve,
     Thank you for your prompt reply. I agree, this is a difficult
situation and we all know that "hard cases make bad law." My reading
of the letter in the digest suggested that the offender may have send
his "ad" to a few people, but it appears he may have really "spammed"
the mailing list.  I didn't receive anything, but I've only been
published once almost a year ago. One man's junk mail may be another's
gold. I know that some services pay by the byte, so that is always an
issue.  I'm sure that e-mail list will be bought and sold in the near
future as are snail mail addresses.  In my business dealings I can
call a "list broker" and receive snail mail lists for pipe smokers to
believers in the occult. Its what we call capitalism. Alot of what I
get as junk mail goes into the recycle bag, but if you send me
something on ham radio, say, I'll be sure to open it. (BTW, Ham Call
Signs, names and addresses are public information through the FCC.)
     If I were in your shoes, I may have taken the same action. I just
thought a full discussion of the issue was needed. It will be
interesting to see the reaction of the membership to receiving ads via
e-mail vs ads in the digest. Keep up the good work on the digest.

Hi, Steve,

Sorry it's taken me so long to get this personal info out, but this is my 
first free time in quite a while (thank gawd for spring break!:))  
Anyway, thanks for adding me to the mailing list.  I've really enjoyed 
the two issues I've received so far.  Here's the requested info:

I'm a graduate student at the University of Illinois, going for my 
master's in the teaching of chemistry.  Yep, I want to be a high school 
chemistry teacher (ooo, scary).  I've been smoking a pipe since my senior 
year of high school, when my mother, of all people, gave me my first pipe 
before my senior prom.  I started collecting pipes, but from the 
perspective of gathering pipes that I personally like to smoke, rather 
than any conscious effort to develop any sort of complete collection.  
Currently I have a moderate number of pipes (about 15 or so) and have 
only recently become interested in the more serious aspects of 
collecting.  I also smoke cigars, and my tastes run a little towards the 
more expensive brands.  My current favorite cigar is an Arturo Fuente 
Hemingway, although I like to try other types, and often ask the 
knowledgeable staff at Jon's Pipe Shop in Champaign (a truly outstanding 
place) for recommendations.  Smoke in peace!

 in light of the conditions, the turnout was very gratifying since as a new

his outstanding collection of dunhills and talked about dating these 
collectibles.  some of the members who attended the 1 march big smoke gave 
their impressions of what was obviously a very successful event.  john

cigars to sample.  caps has been very fortunate to receive support from john

provided goodies at our january meeting.  an added benefit of the meeting, 
apart from the tons of wonderful blue smoke we put in the air, was finding 
out that 4 other members besides myself are avid motorcyclists.  we are

Hi Steve,

Thank you for getting the Pipe Digest to me so quickly.  When I found you on
the WWW I was amazed at the extent of the service and it popularity.  It is
good to see as the anti-smoking attitudes are taking its toll on the
smokeshops and enthusiests alike.

My Smokin' History.

I started smoking a pipe in tech school(15 years ago).  Since then my pipe
collection has grown from a single briar pipe to a collection of 18 pipes
consisting of briar, meerschuam and clay pipes.  I don't smoke cigars mainly
because my wife despises the aroma.  She loves the smell of a good aromatic
blend from my pipe so I am happy with that.  

Like I said I like aromatic blends.  Tinder Box used to sell a blend called
Chocolate Treat but has discontinued it.  Any idea of a similar blend out
there?  I live in Iowa, yes Iowa not Idaho.  Soybeans, corn and pork are our
trademarks not potatos!  There are few smokeshops around in this area.  The
one shop (Tinderbox in DesMoines, 50miles away) is not the shop it used to
be.  It used to be ran by a great guy, who moved to Michigan  to open a
store there.  Since he left the shop just isn't as friendly.  The stock of
pipes is smaller and less quality and higher prices.  The blends I have
purchased lately have been dry and somewhat stale. 

SO, I am looking for a good mail order supplier for my tobacco!  

Some of my favorite smokeshops;
My first;       Town Crier 
                Nichols Parkway Mall
                Kansas City MO
They got me off to a good start.  If I have any advice for beginning or
future pipe smokers is find a good pipe shop who will sell you a quality
pipe, let you sample blends and instruct you on the correct way to load and
smoke your pipe. 

"Yes you can smoke a pipe without tonge bite, Dimestore Cowboy!"

Favorite Shops!
        Diebels of Kansas City (Plaze Shop)
I see they are in your directory as the Crown Center Shop but their Plaza
store has a wonderful atmosphere.  They used to have a carver working full
time.  I have one of their custom pipes.  It's great!.  They are a full
service smokeshop.  
        Up in Smoke, Galleria Mall, Dallas TX
This is another very friendly shop.  Great selection of everything!  Great
people.  

I try and check out smokeshops whenever/wherever I can.  It's a hobby.

A great book for Smokers is The Ultimate Pipe Book by Richard Hacker.  I
would recommend it to anyone.  I understand he has written one about cigars
also.  If any of you have a book or know where I can get it, I am looking
for a book called "The Collectible Pipe" by Benjamin Rappaport.  I can't
find it anywhere.  

Well that's me.  Thanks for the information and I look forward to reading
more of Pipes Digest!

Thanks, I wish all a long cool smoke!

<a name="17">Subject: new at pipe smoking</a>

hello david and welcome to the past time of contemplation.

here are a few hints to cool down the raging inferno in your mouth:

     -  re. type of pipe:
          o get a pipe with a long shank, thick walls, a large bowl and one 
without  a varnish coating.  unfortunately, inexpensive pipes generally lack 
most if not all of the above.
          o  you may want to try a corn cob pipe.  they are very porous and 
do a good job of diffusing the heat and absorbing the wetness that 
accompanies the smoking of many aromatic tobaccos (which smell like they 
should be eaten rather than smoked).  also consider buying a reconditioned 
(used but cleaned up) estate pipe.  for a little more than the price of a 
drugstore pipe, you can get a quality piece of wood that will give you a 
lifetime of good smoking.

     - re. tobacco:
          o  avoid long, ribbon cut ("shag") tobaccos.  they burn quickly 
and tend to produce more heat.
          o be careful of aromatic drugstore tobaccos.  some contain 
additives that smoke hot.  also, the sweeter smelling tobaccos tend, in my 
opinion, to burn wetter and hotter.  go to a tobacconist and ask for a 
natural or very light aromatic.
          o  i would further suggest that you look for a tobacco with a good 
amount of burley (vice virginia) tobacco.  the latter burns hotter than the 
former.  also, ask for a burley that is cube cut.  this cut burns slower and 
therefore cooler.

     - re. technique:
          o  don't puff too quickly.  this produces a hot smoke.
          o  a tobacco packed too loosely will smoke hot while one packed 
too tightly will be impossible to draw.  don't worry, though, in time, 
you'll get the hang of it all.

pipe smoking is a wonderful and relaxing past time.  it was a bit tough 
going for me when i started 27 years ago.  i stayed with it and i'm glad i 
did.  i'm also glad you asked the questions on the net rather than give up 
after a few bad experiences.  if i can be of further help, let me know.

Dear Steve,

In the March 6th Pipes Digest, Ray Bromley and Steve J.(Briar Man)
replied to my previous letter complaining about the increasing
frequency and vehemence of posts railing against the anti-smoking
crowd.

I have no doubt that both Ray and Steve know more than I do
about the scientific literature on second-hand smoke. My quarrel
isn't with their facts, but whether this stuff is the kind of thing
most readers expect or want in Pipes Digest. It's not "ironic" that
I site Dr. Koop as a voice opposed to smoking. As Republican
appointees Drs. Koop and Novello are good examples that anti-smoking
attitudes are not merely the provence of "liberal do-gooders." Any
battle for "smoker's rights" must be fought on the field of public
relations more than statistics.

I expect that Ray, Steve and I may have to agree to disagree on this
matter, and that's fine with me.

I think it's worth noting that while obviously irritated, Ray and Steve
managed to criticize my letter without resorting to insult or even much
sarcasm. Steve was even kind enough to e-mail me privately to politely
forewarn me of his impassioned response.

It's nice to know that the Pipes Digest community saves it's flames
for the tobacco!

Arthur

[ Thanks for your comments, Arthur! I have the feeling that both sides
on this debate have good reasons for feeling the way they do. -S. ]

<a name="23">Subject: Trying Tobacco</a>

I have been smoking the same tobacco blend exclusively for about five 
years. It is Fader Flake from Faders in Baltimore. When you find 
something you like you may as well stick with it, right. But,the 
discussion in Pipes Digest made me start thinking about variety and 
trying something different. I also wanted to try out some of the new 
resources I found in the list and anyway I was getting annoyed with 
Faders. I had ordered a kg. a week earlier and it hadn't arrived. I 
was running out of tobacco. With a phone call I learned that they 
were also out. I didn't get it until almost a month later. I like 
their tobacco but I do not like their attitude or service. I needed 
to find a new source.

I first tried Cornell &amp; Diehl and got a sample of six of their 
English blends. They are all very good tobacco. The best IMO is 531 
Yale Mixture which I believe is a copy of Cravens. It is excellent 
and I plan to get some more. The 965 is also quite good. Prices are 
excellent.

Next stop was J.R. Tobacco for some Bengal Slices which I had never 
tried before. I liked this a lot also and will keep some around for 
occasional an treat or change of pace. Still not as good as Fader 
Flake and a bit expensive at about $33 a pound plus shipping. I burn 
1.5-2 lb. per month. The Fader's is not cheap either, With shipping 
it gets to about $23 a pound.

Before I started with Fader Flake I had generally smoked McClelland's 
tobaccos. The switch was made for economy. Five years ago the 
McClelland tobacco was approaching $20 per pound, at that time the 
Faders was $12. I guess we can talk about the good old days. Anyway, 
I placed a call to John B. Hayes and got a pound of 2015-$26. The 
McClellands bulk tobacco are IMO the best available. I was wishing it 
wasn't so expensive when I spotted an old friend who I hadn't talked 
to in several years--Bob Hamlin at PCCA.

I called Bob to check his price. His offer was $100 for five pounds 
including shipping. At $20 a pound this is a bargain. I have found a 
new steady smoke and one which will allow some variety. I like all 
the McClelland 2000 series blends. 2015 and 2035 I like best. Bob had 
told me five years ago that Ashton tobaccos were no longer 
manufactured so I had quit looking for them. At that time Ashton 
Black Parrot was the best tobacco I had ever smoked. I smoked it 
occasionally when I wanted to be nice to myself. At $30 a pound it 
was an occasional treat. Now Bob tells me that Ashton tobacco went 
away when McConnel the manufacturer went out of business but came 
back and was now manufactured by Kolehaus in Germany and that it was 
distributed by David Field. After exchanging email with Mr. Field to 
find a source, I was off to Holt's in Philidelphia.

Yes, they had Ashton Black Parrot and I got a couple of cans. Now it 
is $50 a pound. I still like it but not as much as I remember. My 
guess is it is a matter of aging. I think the McConnel version was 
better than five years old when I smoked it. It is still worth 
trying. Another thing I learned from Bob was that Ashton was looking 
for a new manufacturer and that soon their tobacco may be made by 
McClellands. I am looking forward to this.

The last Digest had an article by Bob Hamlin which mentioned some 
limited edition tobacco he carried. Bob had not mentioned these when 
we talked so I had to call him to find out what this is about. I 
ordered some of three varieties. They arrived yesterday. The can that 
caught my eye was the Equinox. Quoting from the label, "A delicately 
balanced blend of the finest tobaccos grown in the universe. Smoked 
Latakia from Syria, the spicy Basma of Greece's Macedonian region, 
our own supreme flue-cured Virginias, all aged over two years in the 
tin. Incomparable." Off with the lid and into the pipe. The label did 
not exagerate in fact it was conservative. It should have said 
incredible. The bad news is that only 250 cans were manufactured, 
worse was that Bob limited buyers to 20 cans. At $7.50 for 50gms, it 
is not cheap, but I would still call it a bargain. Bob gets a call 
Monday for my 20 tin order if I can't talk him into more. I'm going 
to hate to see my Amex bill this month.

Most decent tobacco stores carry McClelland tobaccos, but as with all 
bulk tobacco they give it their own name. If you would like to try 
some just ask for a couple of ounces of 2035 or 2015 or any number by 
fives between 2000 and 2050. You will like it.

Till later

<a name="24">Subject: An unfortunate experience</a>

Hi Steve &amp; fellow smokers,
Thanks for the back issues of the Digest you sent me, Steve.  They make for
very enjoyable and relaxed reading.  
An unfortunate thing happened to me recently that I thought I'd share with
other members of the group.  Hopefully this hasn't happened to too many
others.  
While making my usual one-hour morning commute from Baltimore to D.C. on
I-95, I was trying to shake out the last of the ashes from the bowl of my
Charatan bent bulldog out the car window prior to loading up another bowl,
just as I've done thousands of other times.  However, this particular morning
(I must not have had enough coffee or something) I lost my grip on my pipe
and watched in the rear-view mirror in horror as my Charatan went scittering
along the asphalt until it was lost from view when it disappeared under the
wheels of the 18-wheeler that was following me.   I considered pulling over
and going back to look for it but decided that would be both foolish &amp;
dangerous, as all four southbound lanes of I-95 were packed at the time with
high-speed rush hour traffic.  Besides, even if I were fortunate enough to
find my pipe, it most likely would have been ruined and/or covered with road
rash.  Not only did I lose one of my favorite pipes (although it wasn't
terribly expensive, it had a lot of sentimental value because I bought it in
'86 the same week that my oldest son was born and I've always associated that
pipe with that particular event), but because I didn't have any cigars or
other pipes with me I ended up not being able to smoke at all that day.
The only silver lining in all this is that now I can justify buying  another
pipe.  I haven't found a suitable replacement yet, but I've spent a lot of
time looking so far.  I'd really like to get an Ashton or Tilshead (I've
never had either one before), but realistically I'll probably settle for a
nice straight-grain Peterson or maybe another Charatan if I can find one that
I like.  Oh well, like I said, I hope this hasn't happened to any of the rest
of you.  Good smoking, and remember to "hang on tight"  to your pipe near an
open window!
Adios,
Joe H.        

[ The horror! The horror! My condolences. -S. ]

<a name="25">Subject: Glycerol in tobacco</a>

Dear Steve -

I have been interested by the comments flying back and forth in recent
Digests concerning the addition of glycerol to pipe tobaccos.  I thought I'd
weigh in with my 2-cents' worth (and everyone here in the group now knows how
I can't keep my big mouth shut!).

If you want to know whether or not a certain tobacco contains glycerol
there's an easy way to find out.  Just take a little bit, put it on a paper
towel and let it sit out to dry.  If it dries out
to a crispy, crackly crunch it, then the tobacco is pure.  If, however after
sitting out for a week or two it's still just as moist as when it came out of
the pouch (or can or whatever), then it has been treated with glycerol.  A
shortcut test would be to put it in the oven (minus paper towel, of course)
on a low heat.

I've had a fair amount of experience with this.  For a few years I was under
the influence of someone who believed that the only proper way to smoke a
pipe was with bone dry tobacco.
During this time I religiously dried out my tobacco before smoking it.  I
have thankfully given up this practice, although it did give me some insight
concerning the glycerol issue.  Being a fan of variety, I have always
included aromatics in my smoking repertoire, and during my "dry" period I did
find that some aromatics would dry out more or less completely.  One of those
was an aromatic blend that's still one of my favorites - a blend called
"Continental", available only from the original Tinder Box in Santa Monica.
 Similar experiences have led me to wonder about just how universal the
process of casing really is when it comes to the making of aromatics.

Concerning Cope's Escudo and Murray's Erinmore flake I can state that without
doubt they are NOT treated with glycerol.  I don't know what might cause the
"soapy" taste being experienced by some folks when they smoke these tobacs,
but I've never experienced it.  It might be coming from interactions with
residues from earlier smokes, but it certainly isn't coming from glycerol.
 In fact, tobacco manufacturers in the U.K. are prohibited by law from adding
glycerol to their products.  This law goes back to the 17th century, and was
enacted by King James I (yes - the same guy who authored the infamous
"Counterblaste to Tobacco").  The law forbids the adulteration of tobacco in
any way.  In general the vacuum sealing of tins makes the use of humectants
unnecessary, although some manufacturers outside the U.K. do it any way.  For
example, I used to find that many MacBaren's tobaccos 
were virtually impossible to dry out - most likely due to glycerol.  I don't
know why they felt they had to do it.  It's been quite a while since I've
smoked MacBaren's blends, so for all I know they might have stopped using it.

The ultimate glycerol test is in the smoking.  The ash at the bottom of the
bowl tells the story.  A fine light gray ash, and the tobacco is
unadulterated.  A medium to dark gray ash, and I would have my suspicions.
 Black, sticky clumps and the answer is obvious.  With all due respect to Mr.
Tarler of C &amp; D, his comment about how "everybody does it" just simply isn't
true.

That's it for now.  Keep up the good work, Steve!  And I'm glad to see that
we're about to pass the 1,000 mark with our subscribers!

Best Regards,

Steve J. (Briar Man)

[ Thanks for the note! But I'm not sure about the test, never having
found a tobacco that _wouldn't_ dry out... Do you have an example? -S. ]

&gt;Hi Steve,
&gt;
&gt;I have a pipe-related question that hopefully will elicit some responses.
&gt;Does anyone know of a high-quality, American-made pipe in the $100-130 price
&gt;range?

[ Most of previously published letter deleted. -S. ]

&gt;Joe Hurley (??????@???.???)

Joe,

There is a very good pipe maker in NYC called Connoisseur Pipe Shop.
The name of the owner/pipe maker is Burak.  He makes all his pipes.
He has a wide range of good to very high quality pipes.  He also makes
some one-of-a-kind pipes with special designed shapes.  If you get to
go to New York City it is a great idea to visit the shop.  They also
do mail order both on pipes and tobacco (good tobacco by the way).
I've bought several of their pipes including some high quality ($100)
ones, and am very satisfied with them.  Great smokes.  He claims all
the briar he buys is good quality and only the best goes into the
higher grades.  Here is the address:

Connoisseur Pipe Shop
1285 Avenue of Americas (at 51st), Concourse level.
New York, NY  10019 (in the Paine Weber Bldg.)

Quick directios:
Go to the corner of Ave of Americas and 51st St.  Go into the Paine
Weber building.  Find the escalator in the back of the lobby and go
down to the concourse level.  It is right there.

Store hours: Mon-Fri 8AM-6PM
Tel: (212) 247-6054

Give them a call and ask for their catalog.

Smoke in peace.

[ As Elias knows, I agree on the reco for Connoisseur! -S. ]

INTERESTING FACTS: From a source you'd never expect, too! 

"Pipe smokers who inhale live just as long as nonsmokers. Pipe smokers
who don't inhale live longer than nonsmokers (death rate 20% less than
for nonsmokers.)" 
			- Surgeon General's Report
			  Public Health Service Publication #1103, p. 92

"Death rates for current pipe smokers are little if at all higher than
for nonsmokers even with men smoking 10 pipefuls per day and with men
who had smoked pipes for more than 30 years."

<a name="2">Subject: Ronia pipes</a>

About a week ago, my girlfriend managed to get me to stop in at a 2nd 
hand store we were driving by (ooh boy twist my arm I thought, because 
there are usually some old pipes in those stores).  While we were making 
our way through the store, I happened on a pipe stand/ (glass) humidor 
with one pipe in the stand.  I'll call it a humidor because I don't know 
any better so please bear with me if I am wrong.

Good Lord, I just thought, this sounds an awful lot like one of the 
letters in a Penthouse forum... "I would have never believed it if it 
hadn't happened to me...."  Not that I have ever read that magazine or 
anything, but I digress.

I immediately set about searching for a price and was pleasantly 
surprised to see that the store only wanted $18 (canadian dollars) for 
it (the pipe, stand, and humidor).  I was not sure about the brand of the 
pipe but it looked to be in good shape of pretty good quality.

I was saddened to see that some boob had used the pipe as his (or her) 
pot pipe for the last little while before it was put in the store so it 
had a bit of a smell to it.  However, I was undaunted as the worst 
of the smell was coming from the balsa wood filter in it.  (the filter is 
gone and has not been replaced)

Needless to say, I gave the nice lady behind the counter the cash and 
walked out with my new toy.

I took it home, cleaned it out vigorously, and gave it a test drive with 
some Rattray's Black Mallory (thank you very much to Kevin Cook for 
that).  Well it worked like a charm and smoked quite well.

What I was wondering was does anyone recognize the name Ronia (for a pipe 
that is)?  Brief description;

The pipe is briar with a dark, rough finish.  It has a "bulldoggish"
shaped shank and stem (you know how bull dogs have kind of a thick
triangular shank and stem?).  The shank comes out of the bowl at about a
50 to 60 degree angle - if the bowl is sitting upright and is considered
to be at zero degrees - and continues at that angle straight all the way
through the stem.  The stem is a light chocolate brown and the bit?  (part
you put in your mouth) is wide and flat.  The bowl looks kind of
billiardish.  Where the shank and stem fit together, there is a brass or
copper spacer and on the black plastic tenon which fits into the shank it
says "Savinelli patent".  On the bottom of the bowl there is a very faint
imprint in a smooth portion which has the word "Ronia" with the R in a
sheild.  There is also an "S" (in a sheild with two pipes over the
sheild), the number 627, and "Italy". 

The stand was made by a company called "Decatur" from Decatur, Indiana 
and it was made to fit the glass humidor on one half of the stand and 
three pipes on the other half.

All in all I liked the set alot and felt it was worth more than the 18 
(plus tax) that I paid for it.  I don't know about the pipe though.  I 
entertained ideas that it was something special because of the Savinell 
patent part of it but I stopped myself from getting any big ideas until I 
ran it past some of the more experienced members of the digest (I have 
only been smoking pipes and cigars for a year now and while I may like to 
fancy myself a connoisseur at times, I have to be careful that I don't 
get too hoity toity and make an ass of myself).

Anyways, any help some of the more knowledgeable in the group may 
wish to pass along would be much appreciated.

Thanks

I completely agree with your action on the guy using the e-mail list
for advertisement purposes. I have seen a lot of discussion on the
net about access, advertisement and so on. But we have not
to forget that the net was designed as a tool for a specific job
and he is still used this way most of the time. I used it for my
job, it helps me to organize scientific conferences and to do
that in a faster and less expensive way that fax, or to exchange
idea with fellow researchers (for example I 'm writing this message from
Japan, using my computer in France). So I would not like
to have as many many garbage paper as I have still recently in my
physical mailbox. I don't believe that we should have rules
too, but we have just to flame those advertisement guys. You would
not like that anybody come and may write down in your agenda or

<a name="4">Subject: Epoxy ceramic clay pipe</a>

Hi Steve

I have e-mail only and am not sure if this is the address I should be 
addressing. Pipes Digest #177 was passed on to me as a Dos file. It's a 
window onto a whole new world for me.

I am looking for some advice.

On sale here in South Africa is a locally made pipe made from "epoxy
ceramic clay" and rejoices in the name "The Flower Power Pipe"

It appears to be finely crafted. It's graphite gray in colour with a
satin finish, looks roughly like a Peterson, with a copper lining to the
stem which extends into a cylindrical opening in the bowl section to form
a moisture trap. The bowl is double-skinned so that the outside, so they
say, will remain fairly cool in the hand. The attraction is that, being of
a non-porous material, it presumeably will not absorb unwanted by-products
and so retain its original sweetness.

The instructions advise that it be thoroughly flushed with hot water each
day, though my experienced suggests that this may not be enough, and 
something such as surgical spirits may occasionally be required.

My uncertainty is about the Epoxy ceramic clay. My knowledge of hi-tech
materials is limited, but "epoxy" and "ceramic" sound strange together.
How does the material stand up to prolonged exposure to burning tobacco?
Does it give off even traces of strange chemicals under operating
conditions? This may be important if it does have the indefinite life
claimed for it. How does it react to surgical spirits? And so on.

If this material is fired in a kiln during the manufacture of the pipe, as
the term "ceramic" suggests, this pipe may be the holy grail I have been
searching for. What I set out to get was a porcelain or "traditional"
ceramic clay pipe, but without success. But I have not been able to 
establish whether this material is fired, or has a chemical set.

If any of your subscribers have any knowledge or experience which may help 
me, I would be most thankful if they would e-mail me direct. I undertake 
to forward any such advice to the Pipe Digest for general interest.

Many thanks

	There are lots of good American pipe makers you'll probably hear
about, but I'd like to point out three in Columbus, and another up near
Cleveland that you should know about.  All make excellent pipes in a range
of prices but certainly falling within the parameters you indicated.
	Tim West (1588 Graylin Ct, Columbus OH 43225; 614-761-3465)
probably makes more freehands than traditional shapes, but he does both;
more large pipes than small; and more natural finishes than others.
	Denny Soeurs (PO Box 28712, Columbus OH 43228; 614-876-0790) makes
exclusively freehands, most of them quite large.
	Steve and Roswitha Anderson (S&amp;R Wood Crafts, 4244 E Main St,
Columbus OH 43213; 614-338-1733) have been recognized nationally and
internationally for their pipes.  They travel extensively to shows, etc.
but also have a retail outlet (in the front of their workshop) at the
above address.  They do mostly traditional shapes, some quite large,
although Roswitha designs and carves some freehands.  (Great story here,
which maybe I'll elaborate on sometime.  Steve met Roswitha while
stationed in the Army in Germany.  He spent his off duty time traveling
around and picking the brains of all the pipe makers he could find because
he knew that's what he wanted to do when he got out.  Then he wooed and
won Roswitha, an art student, and they returned to the States to begin
making pipes.  Great people, and visiting the shop when they're in is a
treat.)
	Steve Weiner (6683 Laurel Ln, Olmstead Falls, OH 44138;
216-235-9338) makes excellent pipes.  He's the only one I don't own a pipe
by, although I lust to have one.  Mostly traditonal shapes, I think.  Also
a founding member of the Ohio Pipe Collectors club and a real supporter of
the hobby (I think he donated one of his pipes as a prize for our smoking
contest at our swap\sell show last year as well as buying a table).  A
great guy.
	These are all good people who would be happy to send literature or
answer questions about their pipes, but if you think you might go for an
old Charaton or Peterson, you should call Mick or Bob at Barclay Pipe and
Tobacco in Columbus (614-486-4243) to ask about what they have in their
large estate section.  Don't write--these pipes turn over too quickly for
that.
	Happy hunting.

<a name="11">Subject:       Re: Your Pipes Digest subscription request</a>

Thanks for including me in your group.  I am a newcomer to the email 
and pipe scene.  I have had an email account for nearly a month and a 
pipe for nearly a week (although I have been a cigar afficionado for 
nearly a year and a half now).  

Many of my most enjoyable moments in life have been accompanied by a 
cigar.  I remember nights in Mexico where the temperature was sixty-
five degrees with a cool ocean breeze and there was a Cuban Romeo y 
Julieta Churchill with that one.  After a long day of work and school 
coming in to grill steaks with your friends, drinking a few beers and 
then pulling out the Macanudos for many hours of great discussion.

I think that cigars elevate thinking to a higher plane.  They provide 
for concentration as well as providing a link among friends.  Any 
topic can be broached with a cigar in hand.

As for my favorite cigar...I have had three Cubans which lived up to 
their reputation, all three were Romeo y Julieta Churchills, as there 
was a shortage of Cohibas and Montecristos on my visit to Mexico.  In 
the meantime (time between Cubans always passes as "in the meantime") 
I smoke Macanudos and Joya de Nicaraguas.  Since I live in northeast 
Arkansas (no, I didn't vote for Clinton for governor, much less 
president) my only local link to cigars is the local tobacco shop, 
whose humidor is nonexistent and variety is even worse.  Usually I 
drive to Memphis to get my cigars, unless I have a terrible hankering 
for a cigar that particular night.

As for the pipe scene, I have just started.  My first few attempts 
have failed humiliatingly.  I either don't pack the bowl enough, or I 
stop it up entirely.  I'm working on the balance and hope to perfect 
it soon so I will be up to speed on the pipe sceen.

Again thanks for admittance and remember...

<a name="13">Subject: Bright leaf tobacco</a>

In a recent issue of PD, there was some interest in what "Bright" tobacco
leaf was. A few years back I bought a book at a huge used-book sale.  The
book, entitled "the American Tobacco story", explains the origins and 
growth of the American Tobacco Company (ATC).  Copyrighted in 1964, the book 
shows the ATC's various products (Pall Mall, Tareton, Montclair, 
Carlton, and Lucky Strike) and the manufacturing processes of the 
tobacco. There is a section that talks about the different leaf types 
(but not much) and how they differ.  

Here's what they said: 
"When Bright leaves are ripe they are stripped individually from the 
stalks, a process known as 'priming.'  Even this is no simple plucking 
procedure, for each leaf of tobacco must be separated from the parent 
plant just as it reaches full ripeness.  Burley plants are stalk-cut....  

"Cigarette leaf involves more than agriculture:  before it 
goes to market,  the tobacco must be cured.  Curing varies with the region
--Burley and Maryland leaf is are-cured, hung in barns at normal 
temperatures and under controlled humidity until the tobacco is dry.  In 
Turkey, tobacco is spread to dry in the sun.  Bright tobacco, which has 
constituted half or more of every big brand ever since cigarettes became 
the favorite form of smoking, is flue-cured.  Intensive heat is needed to 
drive out all the moisture while retaining the prized lemon or orange 
color.  Flue-curing is a touchy and exhausting business, sometimes lasting
three or four days... 

"Although Bright and Burley make up the largest part of most blends, a
'seasoning' amount of Turkish leaf is needed...  A fourth variety of 
tobacco,   Maryland, appears on its own markets in and around Baltimore.  
Maryland is a large brown leaf, much like Burley in appearance.  It is 
unusually free-burning and contributes a characteristic nutlike flavor." 
___
That's all they discuss about tobacco varieties.  Not sure it provided any
great insight, but it may have answered someone's curiousity.

In Digest #180, Joe Hurley inquired about high quality American-made pipes.
Joe, I recommend that you look into pipes made by Elliot Nachwalter
at Pipeworks and Wilke in Vermont.  I believe their address is on the 
Digest list (in case you can't find it their telephone is 1-800-832-8309).

I bought my first Nachwalter pipes when he was learning his craft at the
Briar Workshop in Coral Springs, Florida.  I was attracted to them because
they had the idiosyncrasies of a true hand-made, without the artistic 
flourishes of the "Danish-style" pipes.  They are unique without being
extravagant or "showy."  He shows a wonderful sense of proportion in his
work, which is often lacking in other pipe carvers.

For years Elliot and Pipeworks and Wilke had a wonderful pipe and tobacco
shop in New York City.  Regrettably it was closed about a year or so ago.
I'm not sure where his shop is located in Vermont, however, he does sell 
his unique pipes and quality tobacco through the mail.  

Joe, you can't go wrong with a Nachwalter pipe.  They are, without a doubt,
my favorites.  BTW, I too like the idea of buying American.

Dear Steve,
   The Digest just gets better each time.  I want to relate an
experience that someone might be able to explain for me.  On the
recommendation of a friend, I bought a tin of Dunhill's Royal Yacht.
Wow!  After a few puffs, my head was spinning and my legs got rubbery.
Had I been driving, I would have pulled over.  I couldn't believe my
reaction.  When I tried it the next day, same thing happened.

   I decided I had enough.  Luckily, my friend was willing to trade me a tin of
Dunhill's Elizabethan Blend for the RY.  I like Elizabethan very much--very
tasty and it doesn't get me high.

   What could account for that reaction?  The nicotine?  Thanks for any
theories.

   My other news on the pipe front is that I retrieved several of my
late father's old pipes.  He had a small but very nice collection.  I
reamed them and ran a rum-soaked pipe cleaner through them.  They
smoke wonderfully.

   Regards,
   Sheldon Richman

[ Nicotine's one possibility.  Another, which I've encountered from
time to time, is swallowing a bit of juice. This has the same effect,
and the thrill wears off quickly. Try the Yacht again, in an open
area, and with mouth kept scrupulously dry. -S. ]

I was glad to happen onto this group.  The more I explore the

There truley is something for everyone!

For introductory purposes... I am 26. I grew up in Oregon.  Went
to college there and everything.  Now I work at Colorado State
University as a research associate.  My job consists mainly of
maintaining a weather station and taking water samples in an 
acidification study up in Rocky Mt. National Park.  Outside of
work I listen to a lot of music (preferably live), I ski, backpack,
climb, and all that crap, and I enjoy reading all sorts of things 
(from labels on paint cans to Walt Whitman to Stephen King).  There
are other things I like, but I want to leave some element of suspense 
out there for you all.  I am a moderate smoker (meaning sometimes
I'll smoke a bowl every day and sometimes I won't smoke for a month).
My main dewice (as my friend Dimitri used to say) is a Stanwell.  I
also use an old ceramic bowl that was handed down to me from my 
Grandpa.  So far, I've mainly been smoking tobaccos from the Up-Down
Smoke Shop in Chicago.  Pretty nice tasting, but kind of syrupy.
My pipe gurgles after 20-30 puffs, even after I let the leaf dry out
a bit.  I guess that brings me to a question that was on my mind.   

What is the consensus on Edwards Tobacco.  I was talking with
the fella who owns the Edwards shop here in Fort Collins and he
had some interesting things to say.  One of them that I was curious
about is how their tobaccos smoke to ash a lot easier than others.
He attributed this to the lack of chemical and other treatments
other companies put into the tobacco for taste, increased burning
time, etc.  I did smoke a bowl of their Kentucky Bourbon last night,
and it did burn readily to ash.  Are there any other brands out there
that people have happened on to which burn cool and clean and taste
like Nirvana?

God, look at the time. Well, no don't unless you have to.  I gotta go.

Take it slow!

Hello all.  I am 27 years old and have been enjoying cigars and pipes
for about 5 years.  I am writing to tell everyone about a premier
event that happened just last Tuesday.  We had the first ever cigar
smokers night in the entire state of New Mexico.  It was held in
Albuquerque at the Baker Street Bar and Grill.  The original
attendance was estimated to be around 25.  By the time they had sold
the final tickets, over 75 people were there.  The Baker Street
establishment has even opened a cigar room just next to the existing
bar area.  There were samples of single malt scotch, ports, and
imported beers.  Everything was excellent!  There were even around 5
ladies at the event.  Just having them there seemed to add class to
the event.  There are already plans for another cigar night sometine
in the near future.  I am glad to have been involved in a premier
event such as this.

As long as I'm writing, I would like to give you the names of two very
reputable tobacco shops in the Albuquerque area.

Hello, I work for Marty Pulvers in San Francisco.  He is the proprietor of
Sherlock's Haven in Embarcadero Center.  I taking on the responsibility of
putting up a home page for his company on the WWW, but I am also considering
other advertising possibilities.  I would like to be placed on the mailing
list so that I can have an opportunity to see the sorts of things that are
out on the net.  Assuming there is no advertising potential, the information
will still be immensely useful.

Thank You Very Much

Hello, Steve
   Imagine that--my very first day on the Internet and the first place I 
look for (and, obviously, found) is a place for pipe smokers to gather.  
Needless to say, I'm glad you've carved out a niche on the WWW.  I've 
been spending a couple of hours on company time (oh well, it's Friday and 
most everyone else is asleep anyway), cruising through the various 
articles, questions, submissions, etc. that you offer.  I have every 
intention of revisiting whenever things get crazy.
  Needless to say, I'm a pipe smoker (also cigars; also, sorry to say, 
cigarettes, but here in the uncivilized state of California one has to go 
outside to smoke and with only five minute increments available to us, 
cigarettes are it).  I have been off and on (mostly on, but there was a 
period when dental problems hampered my ability to hold a pipe between my 
teeth--not that you're at all interested in my dental problems).  I'm 
glad to see that we're not a dying breed, but that pipe smokers are here, 
there, and everywhere.
   I have about 30 pipes in my collection (a lot of Comoys.  I tend to 
like Comoys, but also a few GBDs, Chacoms, and a couple of freehands).  
My favorite tobaccos are an aromatic called Rick's Blend offered by the 
Poor Richard's Pipe Shoppe in San Bernardino, Dunhill's Mixture 965, yet 
another English blend called Barrister offered by the Claremont Tobacco 
House in Claremont, CA, and Iwan Reis's 3-Star Blue.
   My very first piece of E-Mail (this is my second) was a request to 
subscribe to the Digest.  I certainly hope it went through okay and I 
look forward to being on your list.  Thanks to all of you who are willing 
to spend the time giving smokers a place to visit and relax with fellow 
pipe smokers.

[ It's an honor! And I'm glad it was successful. Welcome! -S. ]

Hi Steve!

Thanks for the warm welcome to the Pipes Digest Mailgroup.

Your intro asked me to tell you guys a little more about myself, and this
seems to be a good time to do it.

I've been smoking a pipe off and on for about 8 years or so, when I started
in college because I liked the smell (original, huh?).  I tend toward
lightly cased aromatics (The Humidor's Suite 111 in San Antonio is a
favorite), but also enjoy some of the lighter English blends with a touch
of latakia.  My smoking habits vary throughout the year..harldly any during
the warmer months, four or five bowls a week during the Winter, when I
enjoy curling up in front of a roaring fire with a good book, my pipe and a
glass of single malt.

I've really enjoyed the couple of issues you've sent so far.  I've learned
a lot, and I look forward to contributing.

Thanks again.

Matt.

	I recently changed my net access provider to Sonic.net here in

I'd appreciate it.

	I'd also like to say that my wife gave birth last month to my 
first child, Rachel Ann.  For the occasion, I didn't want to give out the 
generic "It's a girl" cigars as there are many smokers where I work.  
Finding the right cigar was quite a chore ;^)  as I also didn't want to 
go broke.  After much puffing and sipping (scotch) with my neighbor, I 
decided upon the Arturo Fuente 8-5-8 natural.  Not too big, not too 
strong, quite fairly priced and an excellent smoke.  Sooo, everyone got a 
good stogie and my wife didn't kill me when she saw the returned check!

Cheers,
Bill Shroyer

[ Warm congrats on Rachel Ann's debut, Dad! And on having bought the
8-5-8s _prior_ to the fire! -S. ]

   Burak in NYC makes some very good pipes in all price ranges.
Although his so called custom blended tobaccos are merely
Macbaren bulk blends, for an outstanding selection of custom blended tobaccos
I refer fellow readers to Wilkes in Vermont.
Also for great deals on many different top quality American

<a name="26">Subject: More on the Smoking Ban in Maryland</a>

Dear Steve and all fellow pipe smokers,

  In Pipes Digest #180 I told a little about Maryland's soon to be imposed
smoking ban.  In it I made a factual error.  The actual ban did not pass last
year, but is being imposed by executive order of the governor (yes, he is a
Democrat).  Since my last missive I have learned a bit more about actual
contents of the executive order.  Severe financial penalties are to be levied
upon employers if their employees sneak a smoke.  These fines start at $5,000
and can reach up to $70,000 per day (!) for repeat offenders.  The order not
only applies to the employers place of business, but also to any company
vehicle with two or more employees within it that are driving about on company
business!  (Evidently he has never heard of windows.)  I believe this order
will have a chilling effect on the employment of smokers.
  On the bright side, such as it is, there appear to be a veto proof majority
in both houses of the state legislature to exempt the "hospitality" industry,
i.e., bars, restaurants, hotels, etc.  This was strictly a dollars and cents
response to the imminent loss of major convention business in Baltimore.  There
is, unfortunately, no movement to rescind in its entirety this latest
encroachment on our freedoms.  So once again we see the sphere of government
approved behavior shrinking as it is nibbled upon by those who know what is
best for us.  After all, this is Maryland, where it is illegal to smoke in your
seat at Camden Yards (an open air baseball stadium for those non-sports pipe
devotees). 
  On a more cheerful note I purchased a pipe Saturday from Faders on
Reisterstown Road, about a half mile outside the Baltimore Beltway.  I hoped to
be able to identify its generic type from the pictures on the Pipes Digest Web
page, but alas, nothing resembles it.  (Amateur attempt at ascii graphics
follows - real pipe is much more graceful.)

inside----|
          |

     ____  _____
     \   | |   /
      \  |_|  /   &lt;--- outside
       \_____/

The pipe is a half-bent and has the most capacious bowl in my admittedly small
collection.  It took me well over an hour last night to finish my first ever
bowlful of Troost's Aromatic.  (Smelled enticing in the pouch, final opinion
awaits completion of pipe break-in).  I am starting to prefer half-bents as
they are easier for me to light since I now wear bifocals and I really don't
want to char the top of the bowl.

				Smoky regards,
				Gary Bliesener

[ Please remind us when the governor of Maryland comes up for
re-election!  I guess there's no problem there with the economy, or
the environment, or the crime rate they've _already_ got... -S. ]

Hello, Steve,
  Received your introductory materials. Thanks.  Have spent some time
looking at the various files, back issues, etc.  Am thoroughly enjoying
myself.
  Of course, I haven't had time to read everything, but what I have read
has been interesting.  I have noticed no mention of the Iwan Ries Co., so I
thought I might tell you about them so you can add them to your list of
tobacconists.  I learned about IRC in a roundabout way.  In Richard
Hacker's pipe book, he mentions IRC's 3-Star Blue pipe tobacco in a
favorable light, so when I stumbled upon some at a local drug store, I
purchased a package and found that I liked it.  Inside was a coupon which I
sent in to recieve their mail order catalog (more of a price list, really).
Then a couple of weeks ago, I happened to be in Chicago on business, so I
made it a point to drop in on the IRC retail store.
  I found the people there to be very friendly and knowledgeable.  They
have an extensive selection of pipes (they claim theirs is the largest
selection in the country), tobaccos (both their own blends and many
commercial), cigars, and accessories--all of which are available via mail.
They even have a small museum featuring many ornately carved pipes of briar
and meershaum.
  Anyway, their address and phone is:
  Iwan Ries &amp; Co.
  19 South Wabash
  Chicago, IL  60603-3182
  (312) 372-1306
  Phone Orders:  (800) 621-1457 (24 hrs/day; 7 days/week)
  Fax Orders:  (312) 372-1416

And, as you can see, we broke a thousand this issue! Congratulations
to Jonathon W. Davis (???????@??????????.???), who is our Designated
1000th Member. (In all likelihood, we probably broke 1000 sign-ups
some time ago, but this is the first issue in which the active list
has been over 1000. Besides, Yr. Moderator hasn't been counting the
sign-ups!)

On another note: Sam Alfano (?????????@??????.???) has complied with
my request that he send apologies to the 20-or-so members to whom he
sent his ad.  This convinced me that he probably just made an error in
judgment, and that it won't likely happen again. Therefore, I've
reinstated him in the group and re-listed his humidor business in the
Resource Guide. Let's hope that nothing similar happens for a good
long time!

On a third note: Steve Beaty tells me that Cray Computer has shut down
operations, probably taking the Digest web site with it, sooner or
later. More importantly, Steve, like everyone else at craycos, is
unemployed. If you can help with either problem, please let us know.

And now, please let's forget our troubles for a while, and join in a
bowl or stick of something good, for this millenial issue...

Greetings,

Here's a heads up for everyone on the Pipes list. Next month's
issue of Scientific American (May 95) promises to have an
article on "the world-wide tobacco epidemic." This little
gem appeared in a sidebar ad in the current issue of
the magazine, and there was no further information on what
exactly would be in the article. Your guess is as good as
mine... and my guess is that the word "epidemic" implies
the article will be biased. We'll see.

Dear Steve,

Can't say that the question has been posed more directly in this forum, so
tell us, what _do_ you smoke?  My current (and constant) favorite is
Dunhill #965- the right moment and a bowl of 965 can be almost
transcendental.  Perhaps pouring your heart out over your favorite sources
of puffing pleasure would inspire others lurking about the digest to come
forward and spout their favorites, and why they are so...  Just a thought.

Steve, 

Thanks for #181. This is my third issue and I "almost" enjoy it as much as my
Cigar Afficionado subscription, which is a big compliment. 

Just wanted to pass on that I was in Citrus Heights, CA (a Sacramento suburb)
this past weekend and found one of the few remaining Tinder Box stores in
Northern California at Sunrise Mall (6144 Sunrise Mall, Citrus Heights,
CA..ph# 916-725-3231). 

I pleasantly found an impressive array of high-end cigars. Fuente Hemingways
of all sizes and Fuente "El Sublimado's" (hope I got that right)  were in
abundance. Partagas Limited Reserve green label were also a find. This is
only a start to their superb walk-in humidor. I was forced to pull out the
credit card.

Mission Pipe Shop in San Jose is my normal tobacconist. They also carry an
excellent variety of cigars including the Dunhill line, Por Larranga, Avo's,
etc. However, they have difficulty in maintaining a consistent supply of the
high-end Fuente's. Demand is too high.

Just base information to anyone traveling through, or living in, Northern
California.  Also:

++++++  CAN ANYONE HELP ME OUT WITH INFORMATION
              ON HOW TO OBTAIN "LA GLORIA CUBANA" CIGARS??
              I WOULD BE ETERNALLY GRATEFUL IF SOMEONE
              COULD PROVIDE HELPFUL INFORMATION TO ME AT
                      "??????@???.???"      ......THANK-YOU!!!!

Thanks again Steve.

<a name="6">Subject: About Ronia pipe</a>

-Hi Steve and all the near 1000 readers of this list

Jason Hayes asked in Pipes Digest number 182 about a second hand pipe he had 
bought. He read the name *Ronia*. I think the name is *ROMA*. It is a 
Savinelli clone and is quite popular here in Europe. If you are lucky, you 
can get a very good pipe buing this Savinelli Roma. It is meant to be smoked 
with Savinelli balsa system-stick in it. They recommend to use the stick 
just once. The stick takes the moisture in it and I think that it gives no 
side flavour to your puffs.

I hope that you could get the smell of pot from your Savinelli Roma, Jason.

I have seven different types of Roma-pipes in my collection and I think most 
of them are quite good, but you must use these balsa filters in them because 
the 9 mm hole is too wide without the filter. BTW, I think that we pipe 
smokers are a little conservative and prejudiced with these new innovations. 
Another point of view is of course the enviromentalist. What about cutting 
those balsa forests?

Let's enjoy smoking our pipes and be happy to learn that our estimated 
living age is no shorter than with *the good people*!

Happy puffs!

In the last Pipes Digest, you ask:

[ Are Bright leaves used much in any blends for pipe of which you're
aware? -S. ]

At least one blend comes to mind.  The Half-and-Half brand, sold in American 
drug stores and supermarkets, claims on the label to be "Burley and Bright." 
 I would guess, based on the name, that it is 50% Bright tobacco.  I haven't 
actually tried smoking the stuff, though.

Wandering about the WWW I have run into several people who, like myself,
have created sub-pages of their Homepages dedicated to pipes and cigars. 
It strikes me that perhaps we could create an area in the Pipes WWW site
where these pages could be listed, allowing people to browse the humble

I havn't said anything to the page maintainer yet, I wanted to bounce the

Date: 13 Mar 1995 19:06:52 -0500

Any solution with a fixed composition has a fixed vapor pressure at a
given temperature and total pressure.  If the solution has only one
volatile component (water), then the vapor pressure is caused by that
component only (i.e., you won't find PG in the vapor phase). By 
coincidence, the vapor pressure of a saturated solution of PG is about 
70%.

To put it more simply, PG is a hydroscopic substance - It absorbs moisture
from the enviroment (like a salt shaker does in humid weather). The
distilled water evaporates until the ambient humidity approaches 70%. At
that point the PG won't allow any more moisture in the air. This is called
"Vapor pressure". Conversly, if there is too much moisture in the air, the
PG solution absorbs the excess, bringing the system _down_ to 70% as well. 

PG is certainly not the only solution with a suitable vapor pressure for
cigar storage. As several posters have pointed out, a glycerine solution
will also work in a credo. Being a thicker substance, I feel that
glycerine solutions ultimately "plug-up" the pores of your medium,
reducing it's effective surface area. Both are non-toxic, but PG actually
has anti-bacterial properties, which means you may use it alone, where
glycerine should be mixed with some sort of inhibitor to prevent "nasties"
from growing inside your credo. (this is the "secret formula" in some 
glycerine based solutions).

&gt; I have a few questions about this substance.. 
&gt;I read a FAQ about humidors and this chemical came up alot.. Supposedly it
&gt;is to be mixed with water and used to hydrate an "Oasis" foam.. Does the
&gt;Propylene Glycon help make it so it will only humidify to 70%???

Yes, 71% specifically. PG is fairly hydroscopic. it will only allow water 
to evaporate till the ambient stabilizes at that level. It will also 
actually absorb moisture from a too-humid enviroment to stabilize at 71% 
as well. This makes it ideal for regulating a humidor.

&gt;  I called the Pharmacy and it seems to be a big deal to get.. They said
&gt;they would specially order it for me, and i have to sigh it out because it
&gt;is not labeled for customers...  But they said they would get me a pint
&gt;for 7.00.. is that good???

Hehehe. If you buy it mixed with water at a smoke shop, you'll pay 
upwards of $10/oz. Yes, I'd say $7/ pint is excellent! :-)

&gt;How much distilled water do i mix with it??? 

50/50 to start.  It's not that critical, as the water evaporates
eventually anyway - the proportions are constantly changing because of
this. Don't forget to use distilled water to replentish is as needed. 

&gt; Should i use the whole thing at once and hold onto the solution???  

It doesn't matter. Pre-mixed or not, it's a stable compound - It'll keep 
well for years. 

Good luck!

Pharmicologically (sp?), it's used as a solvent for oral and injectible 
drugs.... It also has many uses as a chemical solvent, as well as being 
used in many cosmetics.

And oh yea, it's also mixed with some pipe tobaccos and _cheap_

<a name="13">Subject: RS Hygrometer Calibration</a>
Date: 19 Mar 1995 02:36:59 GMT

Well, here it is as promised - the long lost home callibration procedure
for the Radio Shack 63-855 Hygrometer, (also known as the "Airguide"
Hygrometer). Please read these instructions _very_ _carefully_ before
proceding - If you don't feel comfortable tinkering with sensitive
circutry, DON'T DO IT! 

Let's start with the safe part, checking it's callibration... Even if you
don't want to open it's case and adjust your hygrometer, you would be well
advised to check it's callibration. These are not the precision
instruments that some people think... The factory tolerance (given in it's
tech spec's) is plus or minus 5 points of humidity through the range
40-80%. That means your unit could read anywhere from 65 to 75% while in a
70% enviroment and _still_be_considered_in_spec!!! I've personally seen up
to an 8 percentage point difference between units before callibration. 

For a calibration source, we're going to use salt - NaCl - plain table
salt... Why salt? The following is a brief explanation of the chemistry,
originally posted to asc by Peter Shenkin of Columbia University. Don't
worry too much about the technical details - the point is that plain salt
will, when used properly will maintain an exact 75% humidity in a sealed
enviroment. 

&gt;From Peter Shanken's original post:

"A saturated solution at constant temperature &amp; pressure has a fixed
composition.  [[ Explanation in terms of the Gibbs Phase Rule omitted. ]]
Therefore, such a solution has a fixed vapor pressure. Thus, at constant
temperature, no matter how much solid NaCl and how much water are present,
the concentration of the NaCl in the water is fixed, just as long as both
the solution and the solid phase are present. Therefore such a solution
has a fixed vapor pressure. 

Now, it just happens to turn out that the vapor pressure of a saturated
solution of NaCl in H20 is about 75% of the vapor pressure of pure water
at any temperature close to room temperature.  This means that at
equililibrium, if there were nothing present except this solution and a
vapor phase in contact with it (no air), the pressure above the solution
would be about 15 mm_Hg, in round numbers, using 20 mm_Hg as the vapor
pressure of water near room temperature, again in round numbers.  As
mentioned earlier, the only gas providing the pressure abover the solution
would be water vapor."

OK, class dismissed - you've got it now, right? :-) Now to procedures.
You'll need a zip-lock baggie or other see-through container, about a
teaspoon of salt, and a small, shallow open container for that salt (a
shot-glass would be good) Gee, I love this high-tech lab gear.... ;-)

Place a teaspoon or so of salt in it's container and add a few drops of
water to get it wet. You don't want to disolve it, just get a good wet
pile of salt in your shot-glass. As the technical explanation above says,
you want the salt present in both a liquid _and_ solid phase - salt mush.
Place it in the baggie, along with your hygrometer. CAUTION - DON'T SPILL
ANY SALT ON YOUR INSTRUMENT! Be sure the Hygrometer isn't in it's "min" or
"max" mode, BTW. 

Seal the baggie with some air trapped inside (so it's not tight against
the hygrometer) and let it sit. Allow this to stabilize for _at_least_ 6
hours. (don't rush it!). After the internal "system" has stabilized, check
your reading WITHOUT OPENING THE BAGGIE. It should be _exactly_ 75%. If
not, note the deviation - this is how much your hygrometer is out.  Don't
be surprised if your reading up to 5 points out - unfortunately, that's
the factory tolerence of this instrument. 

Now that you know how far your instrument is out, you _might_ want to
adjust your hygrometer. CAUTION! Mess-up here, and you could ruin it!!!
There is no simple callibration knob to turn. To adjust this instrument,
you'll be re-adjusting the bias current of the sensor, then comparing it
to your callibration reference - the salt in the baggie. 

Remove the battery door, the batteries, and finally the back of the unit.
along the top edge of the PC board inside, you'll see two round, flattish
metal disks (micro-potentiometers). don't touch the left one, you'll be
working _only_ with the one on the right. First, look at it closely.
You'll see a tiny indent for a tiny screwdriver blade across the middle.
Sketch it's exact position carefully - this procedure might take several
days, and you _will_ forget the original orientation if you don't write it
down! 

You'll be turning this _right_ potentiometer (pot) a tiny amount to change
the humidity reading (1/8 turn might change your reading by 3 or 4%). Use
a very small screwdriver (like a jeweler's screwdriver), and don't change
it by much! If you were reading _above_ 75% in the callibration test, turn
this pot _clockwise_, again only a tiny amount... If your reading was low,
turn it slightly counter-clockwise... 

You can leave the back off to save some effort, and put the batteries back
in now. Be sure the "min" and "max" functions are turned off, and place
the hygrometer back in your baggie with the salt. Again, let it stabilize
for 6 hours, and DON'T LET IT TOUCH THE WET SALT! Check your reading, and
re-adjust if necessary. Be patient, you may have to try a few times to get
it right. If you feel you're getting nowhere, set the pot back to exactly
where it was when you started. 

When you're satisfied with your setting (set it to +- 1% of 75%) remove
the batteries, re-assenble the unit, and give it one final check. Once
you're done, light up one of your best cigars - you'll deserve it! 

OK, that's the clearest description I can write of this simple procedure!
I expect _somebody_ out there is going to screw it up and blame it on me,
so let me remind you now that you are doing this yourself - I won't take
any responsibility for your mistakes... Personally, I've re-callibrated 5
units now with this procedure. Even if you don't re-callibrate it, I'd
recomend that you test your hygrometers with the "salt standard". Just
knowing it's deviation might be enough for many readers.

Whew! That's "the-best-of" my PG posts. Use whay you like, combine, 
editorialize, whatever.... And add me to your list!

<a name="14">Subject: Greetings to Pipe Digest</a>

Hello Steve,

It's a pleasure to get the Pipe Digest and share the words of others who
pursue this noble activity.

My name is Jeff Poulin (known to friends as The Bear).  I started smoking a
pipe around 1968:  a Dr. Grabow stuffed with Cherry Blend or Borkum Riff
(shudder!!).  Unfortunately, inspiration to smoke a pipe, from Sherlock Holmes
stories, did not provide any information about the proper way to smoke or how
to evaluate pipes.  Alas, there was no tobacconist in my home town at that
time.  Since then my knowledge and taste have increased and, hopefully,
improved.

My preference in pipes runs to Petersons (including their seconds) Upshalls,
and J.M. Boswell.  Tobacco preferences are for medium to full bodied English
blends (hurray for latakia!) and, more recently, Virginia based tobaccos
(Royal Yacht, Escudo, and various flake styles).  I enjoy these blends by
themselves but they also compliment my tastes in port and cognacs.  

I've added cigars to my smoking pleasures and have a definite preference for
Dominicans with Connecticut wrappers ala Fuente Double Chateaus and
Licenciados in larger ring sizes.  This does not prevent me from enjoying an
occaisional Excaliber I.  I've also found the Don Julio, a mild cigar with
coffee flavors that I enjoy with a rich, morning cup of coffee.

I consider myself to be very fortunate:  I work at home (I am a writer in
Northern Virginia) so I don't have to put up with the incredible stupidity of
non-smoking regulations and my wife ENJOYS the scent of my pipes and cigars. 
(I always knew she was a gem, but this attitude makes her sparkle even more.)

I am looking forward to a long association with this group.  And, Steve, I
really appreciate the effort you make to bring this forum to the rest of us.  

Happy Puffing!  The Bear

I'm sure the group has already discussed this topic ad nauseum, but I thought
it was worth another ask:

I finally tried Escudo the other day, and of course fell in love with it.
 Would someone mind posting the history of this delightful blend?  Does the
"Navy" mean something?  Why is it in slices?  And: I received many helpful
replies to a post on ASP concerning how properly to shred the discs and smoke
them.  Most folks began by saying "take five or six discs in your hand."  I
can barely cram two into my Peterson Sherlock Holmes straight bulldog, which
has a smallish bowl, but not exceptionally so.  Am I doing something wrong?
 I've also noticed that the tobacco is a little damp once I press it down in
the pipe.  Is this normal?

<a name="21">Subject: Whelp, here's my intro</a>

In reading my "trial" issue of this digest, I must say that I am impressed.
By way of introduction, I am a new smoker.  I've battered around the idea
of buying a pipe for a couple years now.  Each time I went to a pipe shop
with the idea of getting myself one, it always ended up that it was my
friends that accompanied me that ended up getting a pipe while I chickened
out.  Alas, my motivation in getting a pipe?  Not an original one I'm
afraid.  Since I was a kid, I've been a huge fan of Sherlock Holmes, and
the period in which he lived.  I was raised on PBS so what do you expect?
My newly acquired pipe is a Savinelli briar churchwarden, and my first
tobacco is a medium English blend.  I've been warned about the aromatic
stuff.  Are Savinellis good pipes?  Who else is known for churchwardens?
Whilst perusing in a pipe shop, the shopkeeper showed me some pipes made in
Santa Cruz, Ca, by a man named Andre.  Are these pipes known by anyone?
The shopkeeper said they were very good pipes for around $60.  Then I was
shown one of the Peterson Sherlock Holmes collection bulldog pipes, which
he offered me for $150 out the door- is this a good price?  Are Petersons
that expensive?  Is it worth it?  (You can tell I'm new to this can't you!)
Back to me, I'm 26, and hopefully will be in graduate school this fall.
After that, I hope to go to Poland to teach english and study classical
music.

Steve, 
Thanks for getting back to me so quickly.  This is  the first time I've
responded to any type of computer news or info,  so bear with me.
I receive your program through Netscape and its well done with great graphics.
Personally I've smoked a pipe OFF and ON for about thirty years.  I've never
been a heavy smoker and sometimes I'll go months without lighting up,  although
on average its two to three times a week.  I've got quite a few pipes(prehaps
twenty) that I have collected over the years.  My first was a Greshiam(sp?)
Giant which still smokes well and my favorites are a Savinelle "Signiture" and
a Cooke(a local pipe carver).  I have several Savinelle's and there all good
smokes.
Some years ago at a travel show I ran into a pipe maker named Dave Alexander. 
I bought a large bent which I like but he also sold tobacco blends which I
thought were outstanding.  He was home based in Gelena,  Missouri and had a
mail order pipe and tobacco business under the name of Dogwood Dave's.  I tried
four of his blends and they were all great---no bite and great taste.  I've
tried to reorder but he has disapeared, I would sure like to find those
tobaccos.

<a name="24">Subject: Bengal slices</a>

Greetings fellow pipesters,

     One side effect of subcribing to the Pipe Digest is the fact that I now
sometimes find myself tempted to try different tobaccos again.  When I first
started smoking a pipe over eleven years ago I experimented with every type
of pipe tobacco imaginable for about a year before I settled down to Dunhill
Mixture 965 and Balkan Sobranie exclusively for about the past ten years
(occasionally buying a tin of Dunhill Early Morning Pipe or Nightcap for
variety).
     After reading through many of the Pipe Digest back issues and hearing
the rave reviews about Bengal Slices I decided to buy a tin.  I had tried
Bengal Slices eleven years ago and remembered it being a good, flavorful
tobacco.  After dinner this evening I pried open the tin and took a sniff
before filling a bowl.  It smelled so good I could hardly wait to light up.
 Unfortunately I was in for a major disappointment.
     I've never tasted anything so soapy-tasting in all my life.  I finally
had to put down my pipe, resolving to come back to it later.  Well, I came
back to finish my pipe a couple of hours later and it was just as bad if not
worse.  Has anyone else experienced this with Bengal Slices, or have I just
completely burned out my taste buds by smoking latakia-laden English blends
for the past ten years?  I recall some discussion of a tobacco preservative
that manufacturers are now using to keep pipe tobaccos from drying out.  Is
that what's being used on Bengal Slices?  If so I'll take my tobacco bone-dry
any day over this soapy tasting lawn fertilizer that's being passed off as
pipe tobacco.  Whoever came up with that preservative idea couldn't possibly
be a pipe smoker!  Can't they leave well-enough alone?  
     Between smoking a bowl of soapy tobacco and doing my taxes I've had a
thoroughly disgusting evening so far.  It's taken a tumbler of Old Crow and a
bowl of my old standby Dunhill Mixture 965 (both of which I'm enjoying as I
write this) to begin to feel like my old self again.  It also helps being
able to vent my frustrations off into cyberspace like this.  
So long for now,
Joe Hurley

<a name="26">Subject: Tobacco production</a>

Dear Steve,

Thanks for all your good work on the mailing list, and congrats on breaking
the 1000 member mark!!!

[ How'd you know? :-) -S. ]

I have not posted anything to this list since my introductory post, but
thought I'd share some information, thoughts, and remembrances concerning the
production of tobacco in the United States, since this appears to be a topic
of some interest to members. This post is rather long, and if you'd like to
break it up for use in two lists, a good breaking point is the part where I
end the discussion of production, and begin discussing marketing and the
government cooperative marketing program.

I am fairly well qualified to speak on these topics, because I grew up on a
tobacco farm in Kentucky, and then graduated from Harvard Law School, where
I, along with several other posters to this list enjoyed the bounty provided
by Leavitt and Pearce tobacconists in Harvard Square. As I type this, I am
puffing away on a Boston-made David Ehrlich briar, which I bought at that
shop,  filled with Dunhill #965.

I ultimately  returned to the bluegrass, where I am a partner in a large law
firm which represents, among other companies, some of the largest tobacco
companies in various litigation matters. I personally handled an antitrust
suit on behalf of one multinational tobacco company. I have lived my life
with tobacco in one form or another.

The federal government recognizes various "types" of tobacco for regulatory
purposes.  One of these types is burley tobacco, which is primarily grown in
Kentucky, Tennessee, and adjoining states. Burley is the form of tobacco that
I grew up with, and have fond memories of.  
The burley tobacco season begins in late February, when the soil is prepared
for the seed beds, which are planted in early March.  Because the average
temperature in Kentucky in early March is too cold for the seeds to germinate
and grow, the seeds are sown broadcast in large rectangular beds, which are
then covered by a thin protective cloth covering to create a greenhouse
effect, holding the warmth from the sun in, and warming the soil.  

Traditionally the form of cloth used was a very thin gauzelike cotton; today,
synthetic types of cloth which are lighter and stronger than natural cotton
are used.  A sheet of this cloth in the size and shape to cover one tobacco
bed is still referred to as a "tobacco cotton," because of the old tradition.

After the plants grow to a height of about a foot or foot and a half (when
the weather warms up, and as the plants grow, the covering is removed), they
are transplanted from the small seedbeds into the large tobacco fields, or
patches.  This process is known as "setting" the tobacco, and commercial
transplanters pulled by tractors used in other regions for transplanting
tomato and other vegetable plants are universally known here as "tobacco
setters."

Setting tobacco is a major job, and requires a great deal of skilled and
unskilled labor.  Not coincidentally, tobacco setting time is traditionally
about the time school lets out for the summer here; in many patches, you see
whole families working together.

Burley tobacco is sun grown tobacco as opposed to some of the shade grown
cigar leaf tobaccos.  After the plants grow to a height of three to four
feet, and leaf out fully, the buds that form at the top of the plants are
removed, so that all of the plant's energies will be focused into the leaves,
rather than into producing blooms and seeds. This is called "topping" the
tobacco.

When the tobacco has grown to its full height and leaved out fully, it is
ready to be cut.  Tobacco cutters work down each row, cutting by hand with a
sharp knife each tobacco plant at the base and spearing it onto a tobacco
stick, a three foot long wooden stick that holds about six tobacco plants.  

After the plants are cut, they are allowed to "wilt" in the field for a day
or two to lose a good deal of the moisture from their stems and veins. Then
the sticks of tobacco are collected and hung to cure in large open barns.
 Burley tobacco is an air cured tobacco; no artificial heat from fires or gas
heaters is applied; the leaf is air dried for six to eight weeks in the
barns.  And let me add from personal experience that there is no smell in the
world more heavenly than that of a barn full of tobacco slowly curing. Most
tobacco barns here have large vertical hinged doors on their sides, which may
be opened to let more air into the barn, or closed to let less in, depending
on the humidity.

Unlike Virginia or bright tobacco, which is cured to a bright golden color by
gas heaters, burley tobacco is air cured to a dark chocolate brown color.
 After it is fully cured, the leaves are stripped from the stalks [this is
known as "stripping" the tobacco] and the leaves are packed tightly into
bales for shipment to market.  

Little is wasted in the operation; the partially dried stalks from the
tobacco plants are collected and used on the farm as a natural form of
fertilizer; they are extremely high in nitrogen, and when I was growing up,
no one ever tried to plant new grass in a field or yard without covering the
grass with a layer of tobacco stalks.

Baling tobacco is a new phenomenon; traditionally the leaves were tied
together in "hands;" the baling makes large quantities of tobacco easier to
handle and process, but in my opinion tends to reduce the quality of it,
because individual leaves cannot be seen or inspected, and removes much of
the farmers' incentive to grow good quality tobacco. [Note to Steve: this is
a good breaking point, if you need to divide this.]

The manner of sale of tobacco and the federal government's role therein is
somewhat misunderstood by many people.  The government's role is often
referred to as a "subsidy" of the tobacco farmers; this is not true at all.
 All registered tobacco farmers are members of a cooperative association
formed by the federal government, and funded with fees collected from the
purchase price of tobacco sold.  No tax money whatsoever goes into this
cooperative.  

Each member is assigned a "marketing quota" each year which determines how
many pounds of tobacco that particular farmer may sell. These marketing
quotas may be sold and transferred each year; many farm owners who do not
desire to grow their own tobacco "lease out" their quotas to other farmers
who do.  Fairly standardized prices per pound for these quotas develop in
each area [the tobacco must be grown in the county of residence of the quota
holder].

The tobacco is sold in large warehouses by auction, though the prices tend to
vary little from farmer to farmer in any particular year.  The only role of
the governmental association in the actual sale of the tobacco [other than
regulating the amount which may be sold] is to purchase, with the funds
raised through the membership fees, all tobacco grown by its members within
their quotas, which is not purchased by commercial entities, at a low price.

This tobacco purchased by the cooperative is known generally as "the pool,"
and the amount of tobacco purchased by the pool each year is taken by
industry watchers as a sign of how accurately the coop predicted the demand
for burley that year, and is stored and placed on the market the following
year.  The quotas set the following year are adjusted by the demand shown the
previous year, and if the system works well [and, strangely enough for a
governmental system, it does] the tobacco supply is kept consistent with
demand, and thus the price per pound is kept at a price that farmers can live
with; the existence of the pool prevents tobacco companies from attempting to
gouge farmers by paying a lower price in years when there are high quotas.

In recent years, tobacco prices have ranged from about $1.50 per pound to
$1.80 or more per pound, depending primarily on demand. [As an aside, given
that I doubt that a pack of cigarettes contains more than an ounce of
tobacco, the portion of the one dollar plus per pack cost of those cigarettes
that eventually winds up in the farmer's pocket is probably about ten cents.]

A friend and I were discussing the tobacco quota system the other day, and he
said that he supported the system primarily because, unlike other
agricultural programs which reward farmers for not growing crops, or which
buy up and waste or destroy produce, the tobacco program, first, only helps
farmers who actually grow, cure, and market their tobacco.  And, second, the
pool system works in tandem with the quota system to channel all tobacco
produced into private channels . . . and it all works with no taxpayer
support.

Processed burley tobacco is a relatively dark, heavy leaf that is primarily
used in the production of cigarettes and pipe tobacco. Most cigarettes
contain a blend of burley tobaccos and Virginia [also known as bright]
tobaccos.  Many pipe tobaccos also contain substantial quantities of burley.
 For example, the MacBaren Navy Flake which I enjoy consists almost entirely
of burley; because of its touch of heaviness and moisture, burely is
particularly well adapted to flake or pressed tobaccos.  To the best of my
knowledge, burley is not used in cigar manufacturing.

I am sorry to have rambled on, but I thought I would add my thoughts and
information to those who have already posted information to this list
concerning tobacco production; I also felt the group might be interested in
my thumbnail description of the cooperative marketing system.

Again, Steve, thanks for all your work and time: I thoroughly enjoy this list
every week!!!

Bye, Bob

I still have it.  I have wondered as of late whether Poor Richards,

Please post the information about the shop for the resource guide. 
It was, and hopefully still is, a wonderful shop.

Thanks for brightening my day!

By the way, Steve, what did you think of that sample of tobacco I

<a name="28">Subject: Article for Pipes Digest</a>

I'm a cigar smoker, primarily.  I smoked pipes when I was in college, largely
because I couldn't afford my then favorite cigar brand, H. Upmann.  I
subscribe to Cigar Aficionado and enjoy reading it.  As for my habit, it is
probably just 2-3 cigars a week, more when the weather is warmer.  I
currently smoke Licenciados Wavell with a maduro wrapper and when I have the
time to enjoy a longer smoke I presently prefer the Punch Prince Consort,
also with a maduro wrapper.  
I was introduced to the Prince Consort and maduros in general by Marc Adams
at Blooms Cigars in Pittsburg.  I am a stamp collecotr and went last summer
to Pittsburg for the National stamp show.  Before leaving for Pittsburg, I
had seen an article in CA talking about Blooms Cigar Camp.  I thought I would
check it out and went on the Saturday morning that I was there.  Intending to
get right to the stamp show, I stopped at Blooms at about 11:00 am.  They
were closed, but, as I was about to leave, Marc, was coming in and let me in
to the shop early.  We started to chat as he set up a buffet of cold cuts and
different breads.  The place was a dump, but Marc was really friendly and he
had a great selection of cigars.  The first thing he did when he walked into
the humidor, larger than my spacious living room, was to hand me a Punch
Prince Consort Maduro.  He told me it was one of the finest cigars, in his
opinion, that he had and it was my gift for visiting from such a far
distance.  I immediately lit up.  Soon after other smokers began to filter
in, conversations grew, and a good time was had by all.  I stayed over 2
hours which seemed to pass like 10 minutes.  Further, I felt like I had known
these guys all my life.  I would reccommend anyone visiting in the Pittsburg
area drop in to Blooms, you'll be well treated.

I live in the greater Boston area and would like to know of any Cigar clubs
that exist in this area.  If there aren't any, I'd be willing to organize a
small function where cigar smokers could enjoy their favorite smoke in a
friendly atmosphere without anyone telling them to "put that stinky thing
out!!!"

<a name="29">Subject: Cigar Afficianado Ratings Etc.</a>

Does anyone understand why the Partagas #10 got a much lower rating (well
below 90) in the last issue of Cigar Afficianado (Ron Perlman) than in the
George Burns issue (above 90).  Sorry but I do not remember the actual
numbers.  It seems odd that the numbers would be so different in less than a
year.  Could it be due to a difference in the batch of cigar or the person
doing the rating?  Is the rating relative to all cigars or just those cigars
rated in that issue?  If it is the later, than the ratings are worthless
since most cigars are not vintaged. 

On another note, I recently asked a friend who was traveling to London to
pick me up some Cubans.  He called with the bad news that a box of
Montecristos would set me back about $350.  I told him to scratch the order
for a box and just pick me up a half dozen.  The bill was $84.  Imagine my
chagrin when, upon a recent visit to my favorite cigar store, I was able to
buy pre-embargo Dunhills for $8.50 per.  I was skeptical about the Dunhill
since is was 40+ years old.  That is until I smoked it.  It beat my $14
Montecristos hands down. 
I generally smoke Hoyo's #50, a great bundled cigar that runs in the $1.10
range, so the super premuim cigars are a rare treat.

Smoke your brains out!

They are in fact great tobacs.  I have tried the Dorchester (Virginia 
with perique) and like it very much.  Others I know have tried the 
others and like them.  They are pricey though at $8.50 a tin.

Try Mike at Brookline News, one of the jewels of this world for pipes.  
He can be reached at 617-566-9634.  Mention my name and see if it helps. 
 He will cut some slack if you get five or more tins, usually.  Also try 
Ehrlich's today or tomorrow as they are having their annual 30% off

 Had the opportunity to visit Churchill's in Long Beach. Overall I have to
say I was impressed.
 A corner lot in Naples Island Plaza. An outside patio is available for those
of us who can't seem to break the habit or on a beautiful day.
 Inside a group of people spread throughout enjoying their stogies. In the
front of the cafe are a few tables and chairs, all occupied. Next to them was
a coke machine where you can grab yourself a coke, ice tea, or an alcoholic
beverage that you provide. If you prefer an espresso just look straight
across and there's the machine just waiting to be fired up.
 It does't take long before your greeted by one of the owners ( George and
Tala ) who will show you to their large walk-in humidor  which was well
stocked with singles but didn't notice many sealed boxes for sale. I guess
that's not their intention. I chose an El Rey Del Mundo Robusto and headed
back into the " big blue " . You have a choice of cutters and ways to fire it
up, including the 44 mag bullet and a unique table-top lighter that reminded
me of the one in " It's A Wonderful Life"
the George pulled on for luck.
 Other things to do include getting your shoes shined, watch TV ,  grab a
magazine from the rack or play a game with one of the many patrons. One of
the things you can't do there is sit in complete silence and smoke. I guess
that's what my late night patio excursions are for.
 I do recommend stopping by if your in the area. It could be the start of a

Steve, feel free to edit as desired.

Hello, all.  I'm finally getting around to writing my intro for the digest.
I'in my early forties, work in medical electronics manufacturing.  I used
to smoke a pipe about ten years ago, but just kind of got out of the habit.
Recently I started reading the newsgroup, then scarfed up the back issues
of the digest.  This led to frantic digging through the attic for my old
pipes.  Sadly, they are nowhere to be found.  Of course, this meant that
they had to be replaced.  Not that I lost anything special, you under-
stand, although I did have a nice Savinelli second.

So far I have acquired a smooth, half-bent GBD and a rough, quarter-bent
Savinelli.  (The Savinelli was the first pipe I've ever seen with balsa
wood for a filter.)  Needless to say, that was rapidly disposed of.  Now
to continue the collection.

In my earlier days I smoked aromatics, but since finding the above
resources, I have been intrigued by the English blends.  I have tried
aromatics again, but I find them just too soupy to fool with.  I'm
currently experimenting with Balkan Sobranie #759, Bengal Slices, Three
Nuns, and a Tinder Box blend known as Connoisseur.  I still haven't
decided which to favor.  More research is definitely indicated.

I patronize the Tinder Box because it is the closest place I can find.  I
live in the northwest side of the Atlanta metro area, and in the immediate
vicinity there is absolutely nothing.  Well, there are a couple of places
that carry mass-produced aromatics from Music City Tobacco Distributors.
!Bleah!  Although today I did hear of a real pipe shop in the same area
as the Tinder Box.  I'll try and investigate it this weekend.

Just got back from my investigation.  You might want to add this to the
resource guide, Steve.

Edward's Pipe Shop
3137 Piedmont Rd. NE
Atlanta, GA  30305
404-233-8082

Nice friendly place.  Knowledgeable staff.  Owner on premises.  Lucky me.
An additional 20% off their already marked down pipes.  Picked up a nice
small, smooth Comoy Sunrise for $US 30.  Just to show you what a nice guy
I am, after I left, there were still two tins of Cope's Escudo on the
shelf, priced at $US 8.95.  Maybe I should go back Monday.  Later.

[ From later message... -S. ]

They do mail order.  Have a fairly large selection of name brand pipes.
A few estate pipes and plenty of inexpensive ones for beginners.

<a name="39">Subject: Trip Report</a>

Hello, all.
   
I just finished a week-long business trip to Washington, DC and spent my
evenings touring the area tobacco shops.  This required considerable
effort on my part, as our nation's capital is well-served by
tobacconists.  It was, however, a chore I was happy to undertake &lt;G&gt;.
   
On my fourth night in town I ran across John B. Hayes, Tobacconist, a
shop in Fair Oaks Mall in Fairfax, VA (it's listed in the Resource
Guide).  The store is a small one, and has tremendous charm.  They carry

a good selection of pipes from most of the major manufacturers, many of
them high grades.  They also have a fair selection of estate pipes of
all categories, and baskets of house-brands and seconds.  Some of their 
high-end pipes are truly gorgeous specimens, and I am still lusting after 
a particularly striking Upshall and a silver spigot Peterson.  My wallet
could hardly bear that strain, so I "settled" for a Ben Wade estate pipe
(I always wanted a Danish freehand) and a particularly nice round shank, 
quarter-bent Peterson bulldog with a beautiful flame grain (damn close 
to straight) and absolutely free from pits and fills (a rare thing in any 
new Peterson, it seems).  The store appears to carry a good selection of 
cigars (I don't know the first thing about cigars, but they had a bunch 
of them &lt;g&gt;) and "gourmet" cigarettes.  They tell me about half their 
business is still in pipes and pipe accessories.
   
The greatest asset of this store, however, is the staff.  The store has
a crew of about fifteen, some of which work part time in exchange for 
goods (my kind of job &lt;g&gt;).  I spent about seven hours over the course 
of two evenings with these delightful gentlemen, talking about pipes and 
sampling quite a number of bulk and tinned tobaccos (one reason I bought 
the Ben Wade--I only had one fully broken-in pipe on this trip, and it 
needed a rest &lt;g&gt;).  Although I was a stranger in town, I immediately 
felt like a "regular," once again confirming my belief that pipe smokers 
are the best type of people.  It was a particular joy to handle items from 
the personal collections of some of the staff members.  I'm sure that one of 
the part-timers, a gentleman by the name of George Riddle, must own half the
extant Dunhill ODAs &lt;g&gt;.  During the course of one of our conversations
I discovered that George's son is a neighbor of Nikos Levin;  it truly 
is a small world.  George, by the way, spent a full hour with me
inspecting every Peterson in the place for flaws until we found the
specimen I purchased.
    
This shop is truly a jewel, and deserves as much business as we can
throw their way.  They do mail order and will do special orders.  If
you're ever close to Fairfax by all means stop by--and tell them Mark, the 
Army captain from Texas, says hello.  Again, the store is listed in the
resource guide, but here's the address and phone one more time:
   
John B. Hayes, Tobacconist
11755-L Fair Oaks Mall
Fairfax, VA  22033
(703) 385-3033
      
[One additional benefit for the unmarried crowd:  the store is 
the only place in the mall where smoking is allowed, and the young ladies 
from the lingerie shop next door take their breaks there (male mall 
employees must smoke outdoors, it seems &lt;BG&gt;).]
   
Also, a quick question for the folks on the list.  I picked up a
Peterson's "Captain Pete" some time back.  Who can tell me the story
behind these and how they relate to the Sherlock Holmes line ("Captain
Pete" was a Holmesian character)?

Steve - 

Thanks for adding me to the digest mail group - you got the 
address fine.  You asked for some details and info, so here
goes:

I'm a programmer/analyst for a large transporation company, and
have been smoking a pipe for about years now.  Don't smoke 
cigarettes, and I haven't much cared for the cigars I tried (kept
forgetting to knock the ash off, and ended up setting myself on
fire (G)!).  

So far, I've got about 20 pipes in my collection, ranging from a
beautiful Nording I got for Christmas, to a couple "utility" pipes
I rescued from a flea market.  I've been smoking the house 
aromatic blend from a local tobacco shop, but am still searching 
for a cooler, yet tasty tobacco.

I also have several Malaga pipes in my collection.  The Malaga
Pipe company is a local shop here in Royal Oak, MI.  It's run 
by the grandson of the founder, who apparently perfected a
"secret" process for hot-oil curing his pipes.  Steve, the
grandson, is a great guy, and also does beautiful freehand work.

Based on my own experience, I can recommend the shop both for the
quality of the pipes and the knowledge of the owner.  It's really
a pleasure to talk to someone who knows the art of pipe-making 
first-hand.

The address is:
Malaga Briar Pipe Co. Inc.
1406 E. 11 Mile Road
Royal Oak, MI  48067
(810) 542-5000
Steve Khoubesser

The store also carries tobacco, accessories, and cigars.  Since 
Steve is the only carver, the Malaga stock is not extensive, but
they do carry other brands as well.  Another advantage, of course,
is the ready access to excellent-quality Malaga seconds, as Steve
seems to be very particular about his "first" quality pipes.  My
current favorite pipe is a beautifully grained bent Malaga "second"
with imperfections you have to search for to find.

Sorry, this is starting to sound like advertising copy (and it's 
not).  But, good pipe stores seem to be getting very hard to find.
Never hurts to spread the word.

Thanks again for adding me to the group!

I see that you enjoyed the copies of the Surgeon General's research I
had at the New York Pipe Show Last week.  I should have put my name on
them in case anyone wanted to discuss the research.  Kudos to you for
printing the information.It is something all pipe smokers can take comfort
in and use it against the ignorantly prejudiced self-righteous non-smokers
who "know" what is good for everyone.

Too bad we didn't meet by name at the NY show.  I am sure we saw eachother.
I was the personwho had the collection of very large Charatans to the left
as you came in the door.  I was just behind John Eells and next to Charlie
Steward and directly across from Dunhill.

Am enjoying the PD news and information.  Thanks.How do I get a peek at
back issues?  E-mail and internet is a bit new to me.

[ Later... -S. ]

It is a pleasure to have this opportunity to introduce myself to my fellow
Pipe Digesters.

My name is Dennis Congos and I have been smoking and collecting pipes since
1961.  My favorite brands of pipes are Charatan and old GBD's.  I am known
somewhat for a fondness for larger pipes but, in my old age, I am investing
more in GBD Collossus and Dunhill ODA size pipes.  I have smoked almost every
tobacco on the planet, it seems.  My current tobacco fancy if for a mixture
I concocted that I call "The Professor's Mixture."  My friends at McCranie's
Pipe Shop in Charlotte, NC hand mix this blend for me as needed.  Historically,
I am one of the 4 original Indiana Briar Friars who started the wonderful
Indiana Briar Friar Pipe Showheld at the end of July each year.  Currently,
I am honored with the presidency of the Carolina Briar Friars who are hold
their pipe show every April in Charlotte.

My pipe collection is small consisting of about 50 pipes, down from over 100.
I am currently unemployed and have had to sell of some of my pipes to cover
expenses. I enjoy writing about pipes and have published on rejuvenating
old favorite pipes.  My favorite pasttime is writing fictional brochures
about pipes and tobacco in the style made famous by Joe Zieve at the old
Smokers' Haven in Columbus, OH.

I am happy to be connected to a forum like the Pipe Digest and look forward
to corresponding with fellow briar friars on any component of kapnismology.

Greetings to my fellow briar friars, squires, liars, buyers, flyers and
eyers.

<a name="43">Subject: LOOKIT ME!  I bought a BRAND NEW PIPE!!!  (help)</a>

Fearless Moderator:
	First off, Steve, thanks for the quote from C. Everett Koop.  My 
wife will let me smoke a pipe.  "Within reason," she says.  Onward.
	Thanks to your publication and to a kindly reader, I am in the 
posession of several estate pipes.  I like them so much I decided to, 
you know, just _visit_ a few local tobacco shops.  NOT to buy anything, 
mind you.  Just visit.  Just look at things.
	So I bought a pipe.  A Nording freehand.  Can I tell everyone 
about my experience?  Hopefully my story will encourage a few newbies -- 
like me -- to give this pipe thing a try.  And maybe it will revive a 
few memories in the, uh, er, "more experienced" pipe smokers ;-) 
	I went first to a few cigar stores here in the San Fernando 
Valley (for you non-LA folks, the SF valley is in the LA area -- TV's 
"The Big Valley", home of the Northridge Earthquake you've heard so much 
about) which I will write about next time.  There are a few new ones yet 
to be mentioned here in PD.  I'll update the data on a few more as well.
	I searched in vain for Gus's Smoke Shop in Sherman Oaks.  I 
injured my neck and had trouble driving and looking at the same time.  
So I went to Lou's Tobacco Row in Tarzana.
	Lou suffered a fire since the last time I was there and had to 
move all the way next door.  Consequently, he's having a fire sale.  
Wow!  A sale, I thought.  I walked in.  Lou was behind the counter 
working on a pipe.  He's about 5'5" and maybe 140 pounds after a 
rainstorm.  And very experienced.  The sale section caught my eye of 
course.  He's got lotsa Comoy seconds, lotsa estate pipes as well.  Some 
very attractive Nording freehands.  Gulp.  "You won't see those prices 
anywhere ever again," he said.  "Yeah," I said, "they seem very 
reasonable."  He let me look around the store for a bit, but the hook 
was in deep.  I kept coming back to the freehands.  "How do you like 
those values?" he said.  "I'm not pushing you:  as you get to know me 
you'll find that I don't push," he said, pushing me.  I told him that I 
needed to talk myself into it first.  "You won't see prices like these 
ever again," he repeated.  I was done for.  I inspected the ten or so he 
had there and settled on what I feel was the best one of the lot.  A 
nice thick shank, and the drill hole meets the bottom of the bowl almost 
spot-on.  For $55 plus tax, I was happy.  I paid in cash.  Now Lou was 
happy.
	"Do you know how to load a pipe" he asked.  "Nope," I said.  And 
he proceded to give me the "Here's How to Smoke a Pipe, Young Man" 
speech,  a speech I have been waiting to hear from someone for awhile.  
As I'm 6'5", I had to lean down to hear him talk.  I imagine it was 
quite a comic sight for any passers-by.  He settled me on a mild tobak, 
showed me how to load it up -- "Medium-hard," he said, "medium-hard." -- 
and gave me some sound advice on choosing a tobak in the future:  "Stay 
away from store brands, but smoke whatever you like."  It was a great 
experience for me.  As he walked me to the door, signaling the end my 
stay, he asked me my name and gave me his.  "Anytime you need advice 
about pipes or tobacco or whatever, you don't need to buy nuthin'.  you 
just come in and start talking."  I thanked him profusely.
	Some of Lou's advice was new to me, in particular, his advice on 
caking the bowl.  I have read all the posts on alt.smokers.pipes on this 
topic as well as a few books and articles.  Lou says to smoke the first 
bowl all the way down, leave the ashes in, reload 2/3 of the bowl 
tomorrow and smoke it down all the way again.  He seemed to know what he 
was talking about to say the least.  Any comments on this technique?
	As for "medium-hard", it smoked the best I've ever had, so "pack 
lightly" as most people advise = "medium-hard" from Lou.
	I hope my story was worth the time and space for everyone.  I 
guess I'm a bit excited.
	I've gone on too lone, but I have a few more questions:  Is 
McBaren's tobak any good?  Which would be best for a new smoker?  Ditto 
for Dunhill's and MacClelland's.
	Take care and keep up the good work.

<a name="44">Subject: Re: Nat Sherman Host Selection</a>

Tom Zimmerman mentioned the delightful, but overpriced, Nat Sherman
Host Selection line of cigars.  These are Dominican with a Connecticut
wrapper.  Is is cured in some manner that maximizes the sugar retained
in the leaf--it's a noticeably sweet wrapper.

I have smoked the Hunter (6" x 43) and the Harrington (7" x 44).
Although I usually smoke Hondurans (except for the Arturo Fuente
Chateau Fuente maduro), I must say that I find the taste of these
*very* pleasurable and interesting, even though it is not as full
as a Punch Rothschild double maduro or an Excalibur #1 maduro.

Tom described it as "fruity and nutty"--I find the smoke creamy and the
sweet wrapper a great taste complement to the smoke (unlike a Baccarat).
Tom asked if there were similar cigars--I haven't found one.  It's too bad
they are approximately US$3.00 and $4.00, respectively, per cigar.

In alt.smokers.pipes you write:

&gt;Hi, all,

&gt;I've been hearing a lot about the Esoterica Tobacciana line here. Does
&gt;anyone know of a mail-order source &amp; descriptions?

Give Steve Richman a call at the Piedmont Tobacconist, 510/652-PIPE.
He's got a brochure he can send out, and can speak about the entire
line.  I can recommend a couple very highly.

Blackpool is a blend of several Virginias, stoved to jet-blackness and
*delicately* topped with a liquorice extract.  I *hate* aromatic
tobaccos, but I love this stuff.

Penzance is Esoterica's version of the old Krumble Kake, though it seems
to have a bit more Latakia.  It is a Virginia dominated English blend,
pressed into cakes and sliced similarly to Bengal Slices, though without
the casing that has appeared in Bengal Slices in the past few years in
increasing amounts.  The stuff is superb; very rich, but quite cool.

Dorchester is a blend of (I think) seven Virginias with Perique.  I like
to mix it 50-50 with Blackpool for a truly exquisite smoke.  This is
different from Escudo, but certainly its equal.

Margate is a more traditional English, and Pembroke is Margate with
added Cognac.  Both are excellent, but I prefer Penzance.  I've laid in
several pounds to age, as I predominately only smoke *well* aged
tobaccos.  (My fave at the moment is some 20+ year old Garfinkel's
Orient Express #11.  Before Larry Garfinkel went out of business, I
bought a several pound stock from him, and guard it with my life!) 

I am a bit partisan when it comes to Esoterica.  I've known the importer
for about a decade, and was on the original "Panel" of tasters to select
the blends.  I was impressed then, and the quality has only improved.
This is real old-fashioned tobacco; hand made and aged before shipping.
Sometimes the supply lines get clogged, but its worth the wait!

Cheers,
Gregory

Headline: Tobacco Crusader Waxman `Outed' As Closet Smoker


SELMA, NC (AP): Lew Rothman, flamboyant president of the popular
J.R. Cigar mail order tobacco house, today announced that Congressman
Henry Waxman (D,CA) has been a steady customer for years.

"He usually buys a box of cigars about once a month," Rothman said in
a telephone interview yesterday. "But he's a real cheapskate.  Always
buys the ten-dollar-a-box factory seconds, the real stinkeroos.  And
he never pays on time."

Waxman, as chair of the House Subcommittee on Health and the
Environment, had conducted a highly publicized campaign against the
tobacco industry last year, which included televised grilling of
industry executives.  Thomas Bliley (R,PA), a pipe smoker, replaced
Waxman as chairman of the committee in the current Congress.

Rothman says that he made the announcement now because "I've had it
with that dried-out little creep.  He owes me six hundred dollars in
unpaid bills, and wants me to write it off.  Called me at my home
about it.  At eleven at night.  Woke up LaVonda [Rothman's wife] and
the kids."

Rothman stated that Waxman "...said to make [the unpaid balance] a
campaign contribution.  Like I'd give a nickel to see that humorless
little goniff re-elected.  I'll send a bushel of Avo pyramids to
whoever beats him."

Rothman continued, "I tried to be nice to that little hypocrite,
because he is a customer and a Congressman.  I even sat still while he
put on that monkey trial in Washington.  But this is too much.  The
nerve of the guy!"

Reliable sources at other mail-order cigar retailers confirmed that
Waxman had been "a regular buyer, if not a particularly desirable
one."

Congressman Bliley declined to make a statement for the record, but
was overheard to say, "Couldn't happen to a nicer guy."

Congressman Waxman could not be reached for comment.

Hi Steve,
Just a quick note and a couple of questions--would you please check to make
sure my name didn't inadvertantly get bumped from the Pipe Digest mailing
list?  My e-mail address is ??????@???.???.   For some reason I never
received last week's digest until I wrote to you later in the week (thanks
for sending it then!!).  As of this writing I haven't received this week's
issue either, but I realize that it may not have been sent out yet.
You're doing a great job with the digest.  I've been printing them out each
week and passing them around to other pipe &amp; cigar smokers that I work with.
 The Pipe Digest is probably the most civilized and gentlemanly area on the
entire Internet (at least compared with what I've come across!).
Did you ever repair your Corona lighter?  I'm curious, as I have one also and
really like it so far.  Hopefully it will hold up for a long time.  
Thanks again, Steve, and have a good week.

<a name="4">Subject:       Re: </a>

Dear Steve (and all the other readers),

I didn't introduce myself earlyer because I first wanted to see what 
was already being discussed in this digest. Nobody likes old 
discussions started allover again! 

So here I am. My name is Jacco van Muiswinkel and I live in Utrecht 
in the Netherlands. I'm married and am owned by four cats. I've been 
smoking pipes for about one year now and can't properly pass a 
shopwindow and not buy a new pipe (just like most of you probably).

My most recent buy is a type of pipe I've been looking for ever since 
I bought my first pipe. Its a bent with a small bowl and a narrow 
bit. Most bents have verrrry wide bits and my grin has grown 
considerably while smoking them ;-&gt; I like the smaller bowl because I 
don't always have more than an hour to smoke it. 

Okay now the Item I wanted to introduce is the question of Inhaling. 
Not Inhaling Yes or No? But Inhaling to what extent. My wife smokes 
sigarets and does not inhale she says. She takes the smoke up to her 
throat. The 'taking in the smoke' consists of an action of the lungs.
I myself use my tongue to take in smoke and thus can't come any 
further than the back of my mouth. When I take my puff I can 
concurrently breathe through my nose. 
I wonder if others do like me. 

To end this posting there's a funny story. I received the Pipes 
Digest HOWTO and there in the section concerning the different types 
of tobacco it stated:"The best Cavendish in my opinion is the dutch 
(Dutch) blend Amphora red pouch". I had never tried it myself but the 
it seems that good tobacco is being made right under my nose, in my 
own home town. I don't know if I agree with Elias Mazur that Its the 
best but its amongst them shurely.

Steve: Keep up the good work and Smoke (as you say) in peace.

<a name="5">Subject: My Introductory Posting to the Newsletter</a>

     Attached as an ascii (DOS) text piece

Dear Steve and Fellow Tobacco Enthusiasts,

While I have now received and enjoyed three "issues" of the Pipes
Digest, I am delinquent in providing an introductory post of my own.
I thoroughly enjoy the digest and never before realized that reading
about others' introductions to pipe and cigar smoking could be so much
fun.  I especially appreciate the informal reviews of particular
tobaccos and cigars as I am always trying new things myself.

For my own part, I am a thirty-two year old Environmental Lawyer.  I
am presently in the employ of the Federal Government, working on
Habitat Conservation Plans with large and small forest landowners in
the Pacific Northwest.  Yes, I am thoroughly ensconced in one of the
most roiling political/ cultural debates in our society.  Happily,
underneath all of the rhetoric, most folks (industry, government, and
environmentalists) actually working on these issues realize the need
to work together. The only reason I want to expound on my professional
background is that today's political climate has generated an
inordinate amount of thoughtless "bureaucrat bashing" without
considering that 1)not all government professionals are "bureaucrats,"
2) not all democrats/ liberals/ environmentalists (pick one or any
combination) are rabid anti smoking kooks.  With that said, I can get
on with the real business of this note!

Outside of work I am married, have two dogs and two cats, play Rugby
with the Seattle Rugby Football Club (a national caliber club) and
drive a pickup.  You see, I am just a "regular" guy.  I started
smoking an occasional cigar when I was about 13.  My pop took me on a
trip to New York City for my birthday and I remember walking with him
into a humidor about the size of our house in Connecticut (I can't
remember the store name).  My dad, a Te Amo smoker since he was 19,
bought several boxes for his home selection.  We proceeded to Lindy's
for lunch and cheesecake and then down to Battery Park for my first
cigar with a view of the Statue of Liberty.  (Symbolism is intended).
This was an August day that will remain fresh in my memory forever.  I
hope other first times are as well remembered as mine.

I started smoking a pipe in my first year of college (Doc Grabow and
Borkum Riff).  I saw the light after reading Hacker's book and set
about developing my present collection (Savinelli straight billiard,
Nording natural (signed), Ascorti, GBD, Peterson (two), etc.
Presently, I am shopping for a Calabash.  My favorite tobaks have
included Tinder Box's Balkan Sobranie, Dunhill's Nightcap, and most
Englishes with Latakia emphasis.  I once smoked a proprietary blend
from a shop in Seaport Village, San Diego called "Churchill," which I
loved but can't seem to replicate.  (Help out there anyone?)  In the
Spring, I may jump over to MacBaren's Plum Cake or a natural like
Burley Regular (any shop's pouch will do).

My cigar choices are similarly eclectic.  I no longer smoke my dad's
Te Amos (unless he's offering!).  I am partial to Punch (though my
public servant salary limits the Grand Cru's I can enjoy per year),
Hoyo de Monterey, Cuba Alliados and any Fuente!  A bonus of playing
Rugby in the Northwest are our frequent matches in British Columbia,
where occasionally I can smoke a real Habana.  Nothing like nursing
the post match bruises with a great smoke, drink and the camaraderie
of my Rugby Brethren!

I hope this note has been informative and fun.  I would like to meet
tobacco interested folks in the area for Big Smoke type get together
if any such thing occurs in the Seattle area.  I also would like
advice on Calabash buying.  Please do not hesitate to E-Mail me!

Sincerely,   David Hirsh

Well, the Wharf RATS (respectable and tolerant smokers) just had yet another 
successful dinner, this time at the Dayton Marriott where we enjoyed their 
prime rib buffet, accompanied by Dunhills and Royal Jamacians.  A good time 
was had by all.

On to other things. I've been experimenting with some tinned tobaccos after 
having read favorable reviews here in the digest.  I loved Escudo, it really 
lived up to its reputation.  The Virginia aroma upon opening the tin was 
fabulous, as was the smoke.  BTW, am I crazy, or does the flavor of Escudo 
evolve after opening the tin?  The first few bowls weren't nearly as rich as 
what I experienced towards the end of the tin.

Dunhill's early AM was also pretty good.  After loving the first pouch I 
bought, I filled my humidor with a 1/4 pound of it.  Unfortunately, it seems 
that the latakia is finer than the other tobaccos in the mix--it was too 
strong as I got to the bottom of the jar.

Next I went on to some "Virginia Curly-Cut" from the Wharf (see below for 
details on this fine smoke shop).  This was quite good, very similar in 
flavor to the Escudo and at $1.60/oz a lot cheaper.  Ron was out when I went 
back for more, so I tried a tin of MacBaren Dark Twist, which was also 
another real winner.  I may never go back to my usual Stokkebye aromatics.

Smoke-shops--well, my regular haunt is the Wharf in Beavercreek, Ohio.  This 
is a fine establishment, a comfortable place to sit and chat while you enjoy 
a pipe.  They have an astonishing collection of Meerschaums--the last time I 
tried counting they had over 200 in stock, mostly SMS's but also some CAO's 
and some lesser known brands.  They also have a fair number of Wiley's, 
Petersen's, Alpha's, Savinelli's, and Stanwell's; and an enormous 
cabinet-style humidor that proably occupies 25' of wall space loaded floor 
to ceiling with fine cigars.  The particulars are:

        The Wharf
        1306 N. Fairfield Road
        Beavercreek Plaza
        Beavercreek, OH  45432          (near Dayton)
        (513)426-0633

Keep on puffing!

<a name="9">Subject: Cigar Digest Intro letter</a>

I've been greedily reading Pipes Digest for a couple months or so, and I have
not yet posted the requisite letter of introduction. Here it is at last.

My name is Christopher Milne and I live in Concord, CA. I am 38 years old. I
own my own business called Printed Circuits, also in Concord. We are a
computer consulting firm. Network installations, repair, service, training,
etc.

I started smoking a pipe about six years ago. I have 6 or 7 pipes. A
Savinelli sandblast that I like very much, a Preben Holm Danish freehand I
also like, and a few others.

After reading this magazine for a while, I'm embarrassed to admit that my
pipe tobacco tastes are not very sophisticated. I like the aromatics,
especially favoring a vanilla-ish blend sold at my local tobacco shop "The
Tobacco Loft."

I have smoked a few tins of McBarens which I like pretty well. Tried Latakia
blends and never really enjoyed them. Some toasted Black Cavendish that was
o.k.

About two years ago, I also started enjoying the occassional cigar. Again,
not too sophisticated, I don't think.

I like the Nat Shermans that another subscriber was referring to. The Hunter
(6" x 43). When I want something stonger, I'll sometimes smoke an Avo.

Also, the Don Linos (not sure what the name is), it's about six inches with a
50 or so ring size. I find I like the shorter, thicker size cigars.

Hope I didn't go on too much, feel free to edit at you pleasure. I really
enjoy reading this, so keep it coming.

Here's my favorite quote, not tobacco related I'm afraid.

Having an open mind is nothing. The object of opening the mind, as of opening
the mouth, is to shut it again on something solid.

Thank you for another enjoyable issue of Pipes Digest :-)

I'm moving back to pipe smoking as a way to have more pleasure out
of smoking.  I started buying cigarettes back in May or June of 1994,
and found that I had to finish whatever amount of cigarettes I had
before the night fell.  Following this pattern steadily, I found
myself with a nasty cough.

I stopped smoking cigarettes altogether a few weeks ago, and have
moved exclusively to pipes.  Not only have my clothes smelled sweeter
and friendlier, but my cough is also gone completely, I can walk
long distances like I did before smoking cigarettes, and I find that
people young and old smile a little more at a 23 year old kid with
a pipe :-)

        [I admit to taking the occasional cigarette when
         offered, but it's less and less enjoyable every
         time]

I had an interesting experience the other day.  I am friends with
a few teenagers around town.  Two of them bought their own pipes
and are starting to smoke them in place of cigarettes.

Yesterday, there were two little visitors at my front door - the
little brother of a friend of mine, and his little buddy, both about
11 years old.  (Nelson and Andy) They've been dying to see my house, so I
brought them in.

We sat in my room and chatted for a while.  Then I broke out my pipe.
Before I knew it, there were two kids and myself lying on a bed,
passing a pipe around.  Nelson, who is a constant talker actually
didn't say a word during the whole smoking experience.  Andy enjoyed
the tingly feeling that the smoking gave his toungue.

We only smoked one bowlful (a local mall calls it "Irish Creme"),
laying around for a while in some kind of contemplative meditation
(which even chatty 11 year olds like Nelson are surprisingly capable
of doing), and then I walked them home.

For some strange reason, while I would never give these boys cigarettes
when I smoked them (and they would ask me - believe me!), I had no
qualms sharing a bowlful with them.

Any thoughts?

--

[ Kevin, it's kind of a delicate situation, unfortunately, and
involved some risk for both you and Nelson and Andy, especially given
certain other details about you that I've left out.  The boys' parents
or some busybody might not see your letter in a good light.  So I've
taken the liberty of removing some identifying information from your
letter, and changing your name and those of the boys.

Most of us who tried our first pipe that young, did so on our own. I
did.  There are a few exceptions. A friend of mine told me once, in
glowing terms, of one time he had stayed overnight in his uncle's
house. The uncle left some Parodi cigars by his bedside. For a
12-year-old, that was a wonderful act of comradeship from an older
man, an acceptance of him into the world of men.  On that level, I
think it's great! 

Perhaps in later years the boys will see it as a rite of manhood.
It's certainly an experience they won't forget. -S. ]

<a name="11">Subject: Re: Your Pipes Digest subscription request</a>

Steve:

Thanks for so quickly adding me to the mailing list.  On review of your 
information, I am sure I will enjoy being a member of the Pipe Digest group.

I have smoked a pipe steadily for nineteen years now, and I started when 
I was only sixteen.  At that time, my mother noted that I was of legal 
age and hence could make my own decision.  I read the Surgeon General's 
report on smoking, and found that pipe smokers live on average two years 
longer than non-smokers.  I'm sure the readership is familiar with this 
statistic.

In 1979, while wasting valuable time and money in Gatlinburg, TN, (I went 
to college at Maryville in East Tennessee) I happened upon the 
Gatlinburlier in the Mountain Mall.  The Gatlinburlier redeems the 
Gatlinburg experience.  Since then I have smoked nothing but Gatlinburley 
(Virginia/Kentucky Burlies with a hint of Latakia) and Cades Cove 
Cavendish (a light aromatic cavendish).  On Thursdays, Gatlinburg's 
traditionally slowest day, you can often get 20% to 30% off any pipe, 
just by talking tobacco.

Lately, I have bought a new brand of pipe which smokes delightfully, 
Chacom.  Being a perpetual student (I'm completing my third masters 
degree in six years), I'm constantly looking for quality inexpensive 
pipes.  I paid only about 30$ U.S. for my Chacom Puma, which is a 1/8 
bent smooth pug with vulcanite bit.  I have no complaints at all about 
its smoke.  Sadly, vulcanite bits become rarer and rarer, and I can't 
stand lucite.

Since I live in Atlanta, GA, I've visited Edwards (on your list) east of 
Atlanta.  Edwards is a chatty place, with plenty of stools and bonhomie.  
Also, they sell estate pipes on occasion, which I find most interesting.  
In one such sale, I picked up a Tolkien-ish Kriswild, a Danish line.  I 
smoke it on crisp, fall evenings when my favorite paths all seem too well 
worn.

In a past life, I worked as a computer consultant for the DoD; hence, I 
spent some time in D.C.  During one trip, I visited John Hayes' store in 
Alexandria, and can heartfully second its good reviews among your readership.

Finally, I am most concerned by our public's lack of discrimination:  I 
dread that pipe/cigar smokers may be caught in the general backlash 
against cigarette smokers.  I must confess:  I have only slight sympathy 
for anyone who will smoke a commercial cigarette.  The Gatlinburlier has 
a number of pure tobacco cigarette brands, having no additives or 
buffers.  You may also pick up a rolling machine to produce your own from 
your favorite pipe brand (I do so when on a flight in which cigarette 
smoking is allowed, put not pipe or cigar smoking.  After all, 
"cigarette" refers more to form than content, at least to the airlines.  
So I roll my own and puff away.)

So, well-met, fellow smokers!  My bowl is filled, my companion ready, my 
Zippo alight.  Hail, and well-met!

I am really enjoying my sub to pd!!
Thought I'd drop a line to introduce myself.
I am Jeff Miller (????????@???.???) and I've been smoking about 4 months.  I
have a Stanwell bent which is wonderful, and a meerschaum which I love as
well.  I am still experimenting with flavors.  So far I have found I like
Dunhill's Early Morning and a couple of local mixtures.

I have a couple of questions to throw out...

1) Is there a point when your mouth adapts and becomes less wet? or is there
anything you can do short of having a spitoon?

2) Someone gave me a tin of MacBaren Roll cake: Any suggestions, tips on
handling ready rubbed/rolled tobacco?

Thanks again for the digest, I always find useful info in every issue.

          There was a tobacconist's in the San Francisco Bay Area that 
          moved several years ago and I wondered if anyone knew what 
          happened to it.  It was a Tinder Box sort of place, thought that 
          might not have been the name, and it was located in the Stone 
          Ridge mall in Pleasanton.  I was back there for a visit last year 
          and noticed it was gone.  The staff there were all very friendly 
          and I was sorry not to find it.
          
          Any ideas on where it is now?  Did the mall go smoke-free and 
          kick it out?  I would offer a reward for information, but we're 
          all such happy and contented people as it is that no reward is

<a name="14">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #183 -- March 27, 1995</a>

Dear Steve,

I've just finished reading my third PD, and decided that it was high time 
that I actually begin to contribute to the discussion.  Be it fortunate or 
unfortunate, my range of knowledge necessitates that I ask many more 
questions than I answer.  I'm an undergrad at Columbia in NYC, majoring in 
the History and Philosophy of Science, with no clue what direction will take 
after I graduate next year.  I picked up my first pipe last summer while I 
was living in Estonia on a fellowship from Columbia.  It is a beautifully 
grained half-bent briar... a bit on the short side, maybe 4-5 inches long. I 
guess the bowl could be described as apple-shaped , in that it is not unlike 
the shape of a small round apple with the top cut off.  The brand name 
carved into the side is Gold Fire (not handmade Estonian obviously).  Has 
anyone ever heard of these people before?  It smokes cool and has led to no 
complaints from me yet.  The tobak that I picked up when I bought the pipe 
was nothing exceptional, Swedish Borkum Riff Bourbon,  but I enjoyed it. My 
second (of two) pipe I picked up while living in St. Petersburg, Russia this 
past fall. It is a beautiful full bent creature carved out of maple, though 
with a very dark finish that lets the grain show through like the grain is 
visible in good green obsidian. The image that comes immediately to mind is 
the pipe that Basil Rathbone smoked as Holmes, with a huge, deep bowl that 
narrows slightly from top to base and curves elegantly back to meet the 
stem.  The stem is interesting as well, in that I was told by the shop 
attendant (bought it in a russian handicrafts shop) that it was carved of 
ebony. I don't know if that is true, but it is a rather solid feeling chunk 
of whatever it is, with some masterful lathework embellishments just before 
it meets the shank that remind me of the work done on the bases of old ebony 
and ivory chessmen.  

Now that the tale of what I'm smoking out of is told, I have questions and 
comments about what I'm smoking in them.  Going to school in NYC (don't live 
here permanently) is great for options, and I've been excercizing them.  I 
started out by picking up some of De La Concha's Marbella, an aromatic that 
doesn't really do much for me...  it has a very sour characteristic when 
smoked unmixed with anything else.  I then walked down to Nat Sherman's and 
paid ungodly money for a couple ounces of one of their house blends that was 
intrigingly black.  This Manahttan Twilight is a very rich but mild tobak 
that blends wonderfully with Marbella and makes a grand smoke. No questions 
about either of these aromatics.  The questions began to pop up when I 
started taking the advice of those on the net, and went out and picked up 
some english blends.  JR's store on 45th St is the best place for prices of 
tinned tobacco I've found in NYC, so I picked up for myself a tin of Bengal 
Slices and a tin of Dunhill's Elizabethan (which was mentioned on the net as 
being very similar to Escudo, is it really?) On the rack, there were some 
tins of BS with a sticker reading "AROMATIC" put on them, and some without.  
Seeing as this was supposed to be Chris's Non-aromatic Adventure, I eschewed 
these and picked up a tin that did not have this sticker on... was there any 
difference, or is it just a labelling mistake?  The pronouncedly smoky 
quality of BS intrigued me as I cracked open the tin and loaded up my briar 
with a slice and a half, carefully rubbed out.  An unusual but enjoyable 
experience.  The Dunhill Elizabethan utterly failed to impress me in any 
way. It smokes hotter than anything I've tried before (yes, a limited range, 
but still the hottest I've yet experienced).  The flavor is almost acrid and 
it bites my tongue like a pit bull. So, as my preferences are beginning to 
for, could anyone point me in the direction of something new and different?  
The name appeal that MacBaren's Plum cake is almost enough to make me want 
to pick up a tin of it.  Could people comment.  Also comments are requested 
comapring the qualities of the different Dunhill blends.  Is the character 
of Elizabethan typical? Are they all as fine a ribbon cut as this is?  Is 
Elizabethan particularly strong? What are Early morning and Nightcap like?  
How about the raved-about 965?  If I dislike one Dunhill, will I dislike 
them all?

Damn, I'm long winded.  This must stop here and now.  

Steve, feel free to edit away as much or as little as you desire.  btw, 
thanks a lot for providing such a grand service to all of us clueless 
newbies out there in the world.

<a name="15">Subject: Pipes Digest</a>

Hello, Steve,
  Just finished reading PD #183 and enjoyed it immensely.  Since
discovering the Digest a little over a week ago, I've been printing out
back issues (just to get caught up) and reading them on the train ride
home. It certainly helps the commute to pass by more quickly.

  In #183 Richard Byer (?????@??????.???) commented on my earlier remark
(almost in passing) about Poor Richard's Pipe Shoppe in San Bernardino, CA.
He asked that it be added to the resource guide, but I don't think I gave
you the particulars, so in case I didn't, here they are:
  Poor Richard's Pipe Shoppe
  364 W. Highland Ave.
  San Bernardino, CA  92405
  (909) 883-7031
It's a friendly, relaxed shop with a good selection of pipes (including a
wall of estate pipes at, what I thought, are pretty good prices--but
admittedly, I don't know much about the pricing of estate pipes), tobaccos,
cigars, and accessories. If you're in the mood, there's a table and a few
chairs and you can sit, have a cup of coffee, smoke, and chew the fat with
anyone who happens to be there.  BTW, in Stephen Johnson's (Briar Man)
report on the '94 West Coast Pipe and Cigar Expo in PD #173, Poor Richard's
was listed as having taken awards for best briar pipe and best antique
pipe.

  Jim Thomas (???????@???.????????.???) asked about the Porsche pipe.  "The
Ultimate Pipe Book" by Richard Hacker says, "Ferdinand Alexander Porsche,
the man who designed the 904 and the 911, is also a pipe smoker, so it
should come as no surprise that he would eventually design a sleek pipe
made of briar with an aluminum-shrouded bowl which incorporates an external
cooling technology inspired by the cylinder ribs of an airplane engine."
"The Illustrated History of the Pipe" by Alexis Liebaert and Alain Maya
adds, "The aluminium flanges were supposed to cool the bowls and give a
fresher smoke.  It created a lot of talk, but few were sold; production has
now ceased."

  I have a question for the Digest readers. I've seen smokers' candles
advertised in Thompson's Cigar Co. catalog and other places with the claim
that they eliminate tobacco odors and not just mask them. Has anyone tried
these?  Do they work?  Any info would be appreciated.  You can e-mail me at
????????@???.???.

  I certainly hope, Steve, you can find a new home for the Digest web page
if it comes to that.  And I'm sure we all hope Steve Beaty finds a new job.

  Finally, here's one of my favorite quotes from a fellow smoker:
  "[Tobacco] is the passion of honest men, and the man who lives without
tobacco is not worthy of living"
                              -Moliere-

  Words to live by...

<a name="16">Subject: Captain Pete</a>

Hello, Steve,
  Here's another reply to a question asked in PD #183 from Mark Lathem
(???????@??????.???) regarding a Peterson's pipe called "Captain Pete" from
a character in Sherlock Holmes.  This is no doubt referring to Captain
Peter Carey also known as Black Peter from the story, "The Adventure of
Black Peter."
  No doubt, many others on the list will send you this same information
(I've noticed a lot of pipe smokers tend to like Sherlock Holmes, in spite
of his disgusting smoking habits--I mean, really, keeping his tobacco in
the toe of a Persian slipper?  Saving his dottles to smoke later?  Smoking
three pipes in 45 minutes?  Shocking!).

Greetings,

Just thought I would drop a line to say how much I appreciated my
first issue.  I am a one cigar a week broke first year law student who
enjoys the rare opportunity to sit down and enjoy a good smoke.  I am
attending law school in Detroit, MI which consequently happens to be a
mere five minute drive from Le Casa del Habanos (formerly the Havana
House) in Windsor, Ontario.  Each Thursday following class a fellow
classmate and myself enjoy our once a week short trek across the
border to unwind and relax for an hour or so while smoking a fine
cigar.  I must admit that I have not found anything that generates
good conversation quite like a cigar does.  I never would have guessed
that I would meet so many interesting people from all over the world
simply by enjoying a great cigar in the store's lounge.  For now my
budget restrained one a week limit will remain, however, after law
school is over I hope to be able to enjoy my hobby much more.

Regards,                             ~

1. Steve, I didn't get issue #182, I think.  I got 181, and then today 183
appeared.
2. I did an incredible dumb when transferring a letter to Word Perfect and
lost the address of Gregory Pease, who had written to me.  Can you
broadcast a plea to him to write again?
3. Being a pipe smoker, a reader, a somewhat health-conscious eater, and a
coffee drinker, I love going to our local Wendy's, where I can sit
undisturbed for as long as I want, eat the salad bar, get free coffee
refills, and smoke my pipe.  A week ago, somebody went into Wendy's and
left with all the little glass ashtrays.  I don't like to be paranoid, but
they don't seem to be very valuable or collectible.  Do you suppose this
could be a new and devious ploy by the rabid anti-smokers?
Cheers.

	Right after I joined the _Pipes Digest_ list (a little over a month 
ago?), I got a piece of advertising for a cigar humidor.  I can't recall the 
origin of the ad.
	In the recent issue of the _Digest_, you say that one Sam Albano 
apologized (individually?) for sending some list members unsolicited 
advertising.
	I don't know whether Albano was the person who sent me the 
humidor ad.  But if he was, I didn't receive an apology.
	No big deal--just thought I'd touch base regarding this matter.

[ Mark, I checked the list of names that Mr. Alfano said he'd sent
apologies to, and you weren't on it. He told me he'd had to
reconstruct it from the copy of the Digest he'd originally used to
generate the spam list. -S. ]

where they can have a smoke during or after dinning.  With all these new

Hi Steve:

You got a post asking about the word "Navy" in Escudo's nomenclature. Here's
an answer.

Centuries ago when sailors sailed the Caribbean Spice triangle they collected
the tobaccos from different ports. They would then take the tobbacos and
place them in a sheet of sail canvas. The canvas would then be twisted into a
roll  and then wrapped with cord (like one giant cigar.) They would let the
tobbaco mature in this fashion. After unrolling the canvas the tobacco would
be cut into sticks. You would then "slice" off enough tobacco (just like
slicing pepperoni) for your bowl.

<a name="24">Subject: New to the Digest</a>

Thanks for the rapid response and copy of the digest.  I am 33 years old 
and have been smoking for about 13 years.  I was really introduced to 
pipes/cigars when I spent 2 years in Detroit from '85 to '87.  I was a 
founding member of the Southeastern Michigan Pipesmokers Club.  I wonder 
if it is still in existance (I moved back to Texas in '87).  My favorite 
tobacco was one from Julus Vesz in Toronto called Cavendish.  It was 
anything but cavendish, my friends called it A-1 because it smelled like 
the steak sauce when you opened the tin.  I think McConnel in England 
made it and it was discontinued before I left.  Now I smoke McClellend 
2000  and 22 and a few scotish mixtures.  I have mainly smoked cigars in 
the last couple of years as the price of pipes has gone up and IMHO the 
quality has gone down.  I have some Upshall P's from '85 which look 
almost as good as some X's I see today.  I prefer Ashton maduros but 
they have been non-existant at my local pipeshop (Edward's in Dallas 
TX).  So I have experimented around and mostly smoke AF and Cuesta Reys. 
I am looking forward to reading/ contributing to the digest.

I'm a recent greedy pipe smoker. For 20 years I smoked cigarettes, but two 
years ago I had the good fortune to meet with Alberto Bonfiglioli, an 
excellent italian pipe maker, I found his laboratory near Bologna 
University, where I work. Bonfiglioli was  my master in pipe smoking 
initiation. I began with a used little Charatan and a Savinelli "punto oro", 
as tobacco I tried a personal Bonfiglioli blend latakia based. Now I have 65 
tasty pipes (many Bonfiglioli ,Ser Jacopo, Savinelli and Ceppo, Mastro de 
Paja, Armorelli, BBB... during this writing i'am smoking an excellent 
Bonfiglioli "Downtown - For Collectors"), as tobacco I mainly smoke "Three 
Nuns".
I showed the Pipe Digest and the Resource Guide to Bonfiglioli. He 
enthusiastly asked me if was possible to include his address in Resource 
Guide. He also gave me  a letter that I report exactly

Some verbiage: Re the article about Henry Waxman and Lew Rothman in PD
#184, please note the date of the last Digest. :-) Oh, how I wish it
_were_ true... and maybe, just maybe, it is.  But, in the immor(t)al
words of Lyndon Baines Johnson, "let's make him _deny_ it." &gt;;-]

In the Not an April Fool Department, it appears that the Pipes Digest
web page, outstandingly maintained by Steve Beaty (?????@?????.?????????.???),
is down for good.  This follows the demise of Steve's company, Cray
Computer. Hopefully, we can get a new site up soon, as well as a new
employer for Steve.  Stay tuned!

Also, a little less pleasant stuff re "Kevin's" letter in the last
Digest, that has generated quite a lot of heat. See below.

And here's hoping that your pipe, cigar, and/or spouse generate no
more heat than is necessary for proper enjoyment... :-)

Steve-
Thanks for the digest!  Is it always so HUGE?  If so, I may not be able to
afford the paper and Long Distance charges (we don't have a Local Access # at
this point- is there a cheaper way than AOL?)  However, I can't afford a lot
of things about pipe smoking, but I always manage to come up with the $ (if
only my wife knew about that newest Castello...Better not to think about
that!), so hopefully, you can count me in!  I'll send a profile of myself and
my P/Tob. interests soon.  Right now, I'm going to go light up and read all
the stuff you sent!  It looks like it will be fun.  Let me know if you have
any tips for cheaper Internet access.  Maybe I'll see you in St. Louis at the
P.C.I. show in May?

I have been lurking on alt.smokers.pipes for a year or so, and after 
hearing  about the Pipes Digest thing so many times, I thought I might as 
well try to join the mailgroup.  As for a little information about 
myself, for your statistics if you keep them, for your curiosity if not, 
I am a 19 year old sophmore at the University of Montana, have been 
smoking a pipe for about a year and a half, and was introduced to the art 
by a couple of friends.  Thanks a lot, and I will enjoy reading the 
newsletter.

Steve,
     I am enjoying Pipe Digest very much. I am intrested in making a humidor.
I can not seem to find plans for one anywhere, perhaps you or one of your
readers can help me out. I would like to make one about 2' - 3' high, I
really can't afford to buy one, but I could afford all the components and
build it myself. If you could help me out I would greatly appreciate. If you
know where I can buy the plans that would be fine also.

                                                                 Thank You,

<a name="7">Subject: Smoker's Profile</a>

Dear Steve and other Pipesters...
    I just received PD#184 (my 2nd issue), and have decided that now is the
time to tell everyone about myself.  But 1st- I read with much glee the story
of the "outing" of Congressman Waxman.  I remember watching those hearings
and for some reason suspecting him of being a closet smoker.  Hah!  It almost
(but not quite) makes me ashamed to be a Democrat (well, I guess it makes me
more ashamed that HE'S a Democrat, actually!).  But enough of politics...
    I am about to turn 30, and am currently a church custodian, but am in the
process of being hired by the Colorado D.O.C. (hopefully!)(I was a
Correctional Officer in Wy previously).  I began smoking a pipe when I was
18, after experimenting w. cigars for a year or two. I still smoke cigars
when my wife is out of town!  My father smokes a pipe, and many of my
earliest memories involve accompanying him to tobacco shops in Dallas when he
was a seminary student at SMU.  So I guess it was inevitable that I would
take up the Briar.  I purchased my 1st brand name pipe- a Comoy- in 1985.
 That summer I got "The Ult. Pipe Book" (bless AND curse the day!), and
learned a lot, but also have lived without MONEY ever since (that's the
CURSE!!!).  I have, however, managed to accumulate a bunch of nice pipes!
    Other highlights:  The day I bought my 1st estate pipe (a Dunhill, at
Jerri's in Denver,CO);  the day I found out about Barry Levin and started
doing business with him; the day (many yrs later) that I was actually hired
at a tobac shop (Straus Tob, in Lexington, Ky); and the day I got to attend
my 1st (and to date ONLY) Pipe show- the Indy Briar Friars show in '92.  The
last experience was so incredible that I still occasionally dream about it!
 I met Barry Levin, and many other biggies (including, I believe, PD member
Dennis "I LIKE BIG PIPES" Congas).  Also at that show, I got my 1st Castello,
which was a life-changing event!
    I live in SW Colorado, and must do most of my purchasing via Nikos Levin
and Edward's in Richardson TX.
    I collect both classic English and newer Italian pipes (in about a 2 to 1
ratio), being partial to Dunhill, Sasieni, Castello, and (recently, and for
an unknown reason) Savinelli Autographs (some I love, others  I loathe!).  I
am also accumulating a nice little collection of JT&amp;D Cooke pipes- they're
great!  I even have one that belonged to Barry Levin.  Jim Cooke did all of
Barry's (and now Nikos's) restoration work, and is a heck of a nice guy, and
a really talented carver and repairman.   
    I saw Alberto Bonfiglioli's letter in the newest PD, and can say that
he's a heck of a nice guy, too.  I've never met him, but have corresponded w.
him and he sent me a bunch of nice photos of his pipes and his shop.  I own
one of his pipes and am looking forward to meeting him at the PCI show in
May.
    I seem to be like many members in my Tobac preferences- Dunhill #965,
Balkan Sobranie, Bengal Slices, and numerous Levin/McClelland mixtures (which
are running low- I need to contact Kathy Levin soon!).  As someone else said
in the Digest, "Hurray for Latakia!"
    Well, I'm sure this is the longest profile you've ever received, so I'll
end now... I like to talk about pipes, I guess.
    Happy Puffing to all!...Chris Tarman

[ Administrativa deleted -- good luck! -S ]

Thanks...Chris

I am a used of nasel snuff and this is one area I have yet to see mentioned
in our digest. Does anyone else use snuff out there? I would like to hear
advice of good shops (mail order) to purchase quality snuff. My local shops
only have one or two brands to choose from and both are quite cheap. I know
Dunhill used to make snuff, so I have contacted them and asked to a catalog.
Any advice would be appreciated.

<a name="9">Subject:       1000 Virtual Smokes </a>

Now what happened to the celebration of the 1000th member.

I do have an idea. I think it's mostly the work of our maintainer 
that Pipes Digest could have grown to the impressive number of 1000 
(and more) members. Moreover I think that the quality of the Digest 
also finds it origins in our moderator. His conscientious approach
to the digest is IMHO the sole reason for the chivalrous character of 
all the postings and reactions. 

I think Steve should be honoured for his efforts. Now it's hard to 
organize something material but since we're on the Internet it may be 
right to offer Steve a Virtual Smoke to endorse this statement!

Here's mine:

Steve and pipers.

I am quite new to the internet ways and have been reading the current issue
and i wonder at how strange it is be reading about pipes (men's second best
friend) in an electronic format, it would seem that this two (electronic
communnication and smoking pipes) would not fit into the mix together, may
be the medium is maturing?, but what i would like to believe is that may be
in here, the net, one needs not to be categorized, as the many ocupations
of the subscribed can atest.
About me? I am a graphic designer in Mexico, I work in multimedia
development, my favorite tabacos are Balkan Sobranie and Dunhill London
mixture, which smoke great in two ascorti pipes (favorites). Greetings and
thank you Steve for taking care of this list.

this over and over. Welcome, Roberto! -S. ]

<a name="12">Subject: Introduction.</a>

Dear Steve,

thank you for joining me to the list!

I really like to read the Pipes Digest - but am a little astonished that the
most pipe-smokers live in USA. Some I used to see in the german djungle as well
... but perhaps they do not own a computer.

To introduce me: I'm a 27-year old student of German language and linguistics
and Philosophy. Pipe-smoking was one of my interests since I was about 20. 

I began with MacBaren's Scottish Mixture till the day I found an old fine
tobacco-, pipes- and  cigars-dealer named "tabac trennt". I changed to Trennt's
Jubilaeumsmischung which is a fine mild longcut of six tobaccos, very good for
beginners. The rhyme on the packet says: 
   "Jeder smoeker 
   hett sin hoeker
   de watt kennt
   swoert op trennt!"
Then I changed to Abu Riha, another mixture of "tabac trennt". It is a mixture
in english way of mixing with a good amount of Latakia. As well longcut, but
spicy.
Sometimes I smoke Dunhill's Early Morning Pipe.

For all who will come to Kiel sometimes :-) I really recommend the shop of Mr
Trennt, as well to the cigar smokers. Mr Trennt himself is a passionate
cigar-smoker, too.

In conscience of my purse I normally smoke Stanwell-Pipes: Lovat, Bent, Bent
Albert.

Smoke in peace! (I like this line very much, Steve!)

Regards,
Hanjo Iwanowitsch, Kiel, Germany.

Hello Everyone,
      I would first like to thank Steve for this fantastic digest.  I find it
makes for interesting reading.  I suppose I should tell a little about
myself.  My name is Zac Gomez and I am a 22 year-old student at Florida State
University (home of the great Seminole football team) and will be graduating
at the end of this month will a degree in music education.  I have been
interning at a middle school in Orlando these past few months teaching band.
 
      I, like many others, learned many new things when I came to college.  I
have come to appreciate the finer things in life.  I now enjoy a fine cigar,
a good blend, a fine wine, and Beam's bourbon!  I was introduced to these
pleasures when I joined my fraternity.  But now I truly enjoy them insteads of
 trying to look cool!!!  I have only been smoking pipes and cigars for about
two years and am very inexperienced.  I like to experiment with blends and
cigars and that why I like this digest so much.  It offers a lot of feedback
on just about everything.  
      After I graduate I will be returning to DC, where I grew up.  I
beg of anyone in the area to e-mail and tell me of cigar clubs or
gentlemen's clubs that I may participate in.  Or anyone with similar
interests as mine.  Thanks again Steve for including me in this digest
and I look forward to future conversations and discussions.

[ Welcome, Zachary! I know of a quite active pipe club in DC (See
Steve Weinstein's letter later), but no cigar clubs. Nonetheless,
perhaps CAPS could help you find some like-minded souls. -S. ]

<a name="14">Subject: used pipes</a>

Steve,
I have an acquaintance in town looking to get rid of about 100-150 pipes.
 Quite a few Savinellis, one Dunhill, many GBD, 3-5 Ben Wade, Edwards, IRC?
and several others.  Anything particular I should look for which would make
these higher quality smokers, or more collectible... Is there a collectibles
resource on this type of thing?

Also, is there a resource in an old pd, perhaps on how to deep clean used/old
pipes?

Thanks,
Booxster

[ There are some articles in previous PDs about how to clean used
pipes. Re value, I'm not sure whether there is a rating system for
pipes, like there is for coins; perhaps someone else there knows? Of
course, a good shine will help. And see this issue for a couple of
show announcements, too! -S. ]

Upcoming meeting of the Chicagoland Pipe Club; the annual "Big Shoulders
Swap" -  April 22, all day 10:00 to 4:00, at the Northbrook Radisson Inn
(formerly the Ramada) for a special sale of new and estate pipes from
esteemed pipe purveyors Bob Hamlin and Jack Ehrmentraut. They have planned to
bring several hundred pipes each, and many pipes which have not been
previously advertised. Bob will feature new: Ser Jacopo, Dunhill, Ashton,

Are there any from "down-east" among us? A friend and I are considering the
possibility of moving to Maine sometime this summer. We are both Yankees
forced into moving to Florida with our parents. The Florida life has never
suited us, and Maine has been an area of interest to us. So, what I'm getting
at is this: what pipe culture exists down-east? Are there any good
tobacconists? Etc.

In addition, if there is anyone who would like to tell me about life in Maine
generally please feel free to send some E-mail my way.

Thanks in advance,

Dear Steve,

That's ok, I'm moving to Bloomington Indiana really soon! I'm getting 
married, to a beautiful young lady (who doesn't mind my pipe, she even 
puffs it now and then). Have you ever checked out the tobacco shops in 
Indiana? I saw some listed in the digest, are they nice places? I love my 
current tobbacconist: The Briar and the Burley at College Mall, 
Bloomington Indiana. I smoke blend of tobacks (sp?) that they call "Joe's 
Blend". I don't remember the author, but the gentleman who mentioned that 
the pipe smokers on the net conducted themselves in a more gentlemanly 
fashion was 110% on target.
Anyway, Erika (the same lovely young lady) sends me the Joe's in the 
mail. It comes in a zip lock bag, and she just throws it into a box and 
three days later I am a very happy man. My question is this: Should I ask 
her to package it in any special way? I'm worried that it will dry out (I 
I have not enjoyed the dry tobacco I've smoked) and I do not want it to 
get damaged or stolen, and waste my special lady's hard earned money.
Thanks in advance for any and all help.

Peace,

In the last issue of PD, Craig Haas asks whatever happened to the tobacco
store in the Stone Valley Mall.

I never actually went to the store in the Pleasanton Mall, but I believe that
the store there was part of a small chain called "The Tobacco Loft."

There used to also be one in the Sun Valley Mall here in Concord, CA. That
mall location is also closed, but they have moved to Pleasant Hill. I am a
frequent customer.

Their address is 1920 Contra Costa Blvd. Pleasant Hill, CA. Phone
510-686-3440. They can probably tell you if they still have a Pleasanton
location.

<a name="20">Subject: C&amp;D reviews for PD</a>

(Steve: Here are the reviews I mentioned for the Pipe Digest.  Hope it meets
your needs.)

Dear Steve:

I recently sampled several blends from Cornell &amp; Diehl and thought PD might be
interested in my impressions of them.  I know that matters of taste vary
tremendously from person to person, but there are always questions about the
taste of this or that blend on a.s.p. so I thought I would give it a try.

A few caveats first.  I have no connection with C&amp;D, although I expect to
become a regular customer now that I have tried these tobaccos.  Also, I
typically smoke English blends and Virginia flake styles; rarely aromatics and
NEVER Balkan style blends. (The latter always taste like ashes to me.)  I tend
to puff slowly, in a relaxed fashion, which I find keeps the heat and
potential bite of ANY tobacco to a minimum but allows all the good character
of really quality blends (like these) to come through.  The tobaccos listed
are in no particular order, just the way I sampled them.

Virginia Dare (# 812) - mild and cool burning but very flavorful with the
natural sweetness of Virginia tobacco;  a lingering, sweet aftertaste;  this
should satisfy any Virginia fans that don't require the heaviest dark VA flake
styles.  This will become a regular for me.

Merlin's Choice (#966) - this is Craig's attempt to duplicate the taste of
Escudo; it's not there yet (perhaps a bit more sweet red Virginia?) but this
incarnation is a wonderful blend on its own:  smooth, medium strength and
slightly sweet;  it smokes easy and dry.  I liked it so much, I'm going to
suggest that Craig keep it as a separate blend as he delves into the
continuing mysteries of Escudo.

Yale Mixture (# 531) - This is Craig's copy of the discontinued Craven blend
(the one James Barrie praised as the Arcadia in My Lady Nicotine);  I haven't
smoked Craven in a LONG time but this blend seemed to strike the right chord
in my aging memory cells;  Barrie's obsession with Craven was justified:  this
is a rich, smooth tobacco with a fullness of taste like a deep red wine or
aged port;  it flooded my tastebuds with flavor.  Ahhhhh!

Constellation (# 411) - a very rich, smooth, mouth-filling English blend (but
quite a different taste from Yale Mixture above); C&amp;D's heaviest latakia blend
and for those of us who appreciate latakia, this is a nectar to be sipped with
enthusiasm.

Coffee (# 909) - a VERY mild aromatic but with a real taste of sweetened
coffee;  it not only smokes well and with flavor but leaves a very pleasant
aftertaste;  it was great with my morning coffee and after a light meal. 
(Please keep in mind that I am one of those "strange" people from New England
who grew up loving coffee ice cream, which gets me some odd looks from folks
in Virginia where I now reside.)

Vanilla Cavendish (# 905) - Medium strength; easy burning; definite, and very
pleasant, taste of vanilla which lingers nicely;  it doesn't smoke wet and has
a dry fluffy ash for an aromatic.

Stanhope (# 502) - my sample of Stanhope was too dry for my taste, even for an
English style and it burned hotter than I liked;  I humidified it for a few
days which I felt improved it;  this is a medium strength English blend, not
quite full flavored;  it reminded me of a medium strength Dunhill;  the taste
was more spicy than sweet inspite of the Virginia ribbon cut base;  it had
more appeal following a fairly heavy meal with a good bordeau.

London Squire (# 012) - Craig describes this as similar to his medium strength
Balkan blend (#081);  if so, it is the lightest Balkan I've ever tried (I
liked it despite my aversion to Balkans);  perhaps the added latakia gives it
a fuller, smoother taste;  a full bodied blend that I preferred after a heavy,
rich meal.

Sweet English (# 100) - as mild, at least, as Dunhill's Early Morning; it
actually has a slight but definite sweetness superimposed on a delicate
English style blend;  I think this would be an excellent tobacco for new pipe
smokers or for those who are trying to switch from heavier aromatics;  it
packs and smokes easily with a pleasant, lingering aftertaste.

Austrian (# 025) - mild, mild, mild!  a wine casing is present but it is
indeed light;  very easy burning and calls for slow (dare I say
contemplative?) puffing; found the flavor more noticeable after a light meal.

Unique (# 816) - two words came immediately to mind after a few puffs:  smooth
and mild;  If you want to smoke an English blend around people sensitive to
heavier styles, this would be it;  the flavors are light but certainly
present;  absolutely no bite or harshness while maintaining flavor.  (I chose
this one because I use so much gunpowder of the same name in my target
shooting.  I'll take any omen I can.)

A few general notes.  All the tobaccos were easy to pack, ignite and were easy
burning.  They produced a light fluffy ash and burned down to the heel of the
pipe.  There was no "goopiness" in the bowl as is common with many commercial
tobaccos.  The long cut and ribbon cut tobaccos which were the norm in the
blends I tried, smoked easily and rewarded slow, deliberate puffing (my
style).  I don't know how Craig does it but the aromatics produced a light,
lingering aftertaste that is very pleasant without being cloying.  The
descriptions in the C&amp;D brochure are accurate and provide more blending
information than is commonly available.  

Talking to Craig on the phone is fun.  He is knowledgable AND enthusiastic. 
If you have any questions on which blend might suit you, he can come up with
some good suggestions.  It was difficult to end the conversation because I was
having so much fun.  But it is, after all, a business line so I restrained
myself.

All C&amp;D tobacco sells for $12.75/pound, which is a terrific price compared to
my usual costs.  Contact Craig Tarler at:

Jim:

     I ordered my first Kirsten pipe a few weeks ago.  I think I'm in love! 
 It's a great pipe.  No "cooling fins" at all.  The bowl is briar (though 
meerschaum is available).  The shaft is aircraft-grade aluminum (available 
in brass, silver tone and black.  I got it in black).

     Very cool smoke, fantastically easy to clean, and due to the nature of 
construction I can smoke several bowls full without gumming up the bottom of 
the bowl -- all the sludge &amp; gunk [technical, scientific terms] gets trapped 
in the aluminum shaft rather than in the briar bowl.

     The only disadvantage I've seen so far is that this pipe is so 
wonderful I'm gonna have to order some more of them.  You ought to give them 
a call at 1-206-783-0700 and ask for a copy of their catalog.

Smoke Signal #15
?????@???.???.???

Environmental tobacco smoke is the present concern of the anti-smoking
lobby. The success of their campaign is such that most companies today
forbid smoking in the workplace. In the ten years that I have worked for
FlightSafety, there has always been a ban on smoking cigars and pipes on
company premises. Two years ago, cigarette smoking was forbidden, although
management relented enough to allow smoking outside.

Although I smoke a pipe, I am glad to work in an atmosphere free from
smoke. Smoke rising from a cigarette smouldering in an already full
ashtray is particularly offensive to my sense of smell, it varies from
brand to brand, but usually has a sour, reasty odour. A dozen people
smoking cigars and pipes would produce an overpowering atmosphere in a
poorly ventilated workplace -- few companies ever spend enough money to
get the heating and ventilation working properly -- this coupled with many
cigarette smokers would make life intolerable.

Early in the year '82 I arrived here on the noon stage to work for a small
flight simulator manufacturing company. Our office was a large, open area
where everyone worked: software, hardware, and mechanical engineers thrown
in with the drafting and secretarial staff. A lot of people smoked
cigarettes, no pipes or cigars allowed. At the end of each working day my
clothes reeked of stale cigarette smoke. I remember well a nearby
mechanical engineer getting up from his drawing-table to stretch, one
afternoon at about three o'clock. As he worked the kinks out of his back
he looked across the room and burst into song:

        "There's a bright yellow haze o'er the office,
         There's a bright yellow haze o'er the office.
         The smog is as high as an elephant's eye,
         And I'm just standing here awaiting to die. . .

         "Oh what a beautiful morning,
          Oh what a beautiful day.
          I've got this curious feeling,
          Everything's not going my way."

Well, this is Oklahoma of course. And sure enough the office was filled
with a yellow haze. I hadn't seen anything like it since the last
pea-souper in London, back in the '50s -- that is, a smog as thick as pea
soup.

So, I am glad smoking is prohibited in the workplace, which leaves me to
the pleasure of returning home to the comfortable frowst of my study. My
wife opens the windows in her lair when she smokes cigarettes and once
asked me why I didn't do the same in my study: "Because I like the fug," I
replied.  Indeed, the smell of quality pipe tobacco smoke is so much
better than that of cigarettes.

In February of this year the magazine "Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology"
reported the signing of an agreement between FlightSafety International
and the Yunnan Tobacco Group to build a $30-million training centre.
Kunming FlightSafety Aviation Training Company will be located in the city
of Kunming, twelve hundred miles West of Shanghai. FlightSafety will be the
majority shareholder in the joint venture. With luck I should have a
chance to exercise my few words of Mandarin or, as it is more properly
called, Putonghua. By strange coincidence my Chinese teacher is a native
of Kunming. She says that the Yunnan Tobacco Group products are widely
distributed throughout China. Like FlightSafety International Simulation
Systems Division, I expect that the training centre in Kunming will be
festooned with those signs so common everywhere in this country, except I
am sure these will command instead: "No No Smoking."

Hi Steve-
         I have been reading your mailgroup on WWW for the last couple of
months with great pleasure.  For some reason, I lost my WWW access this week,
hopefully just temporarily.  In any case, I have been meaning to join your
group and now I have the incentive.  I recently returned to pipe smoking after
a 5-year hiatus.  I have learned a lot from your group and recently sampled
Balkan Slices and Escudo.  I love the Escudo and like Slices, though I still
prefer my usual English blends (Palisades from Georgetown Tobacco and Orient
Express from Tobacco Taverne in State College, PA).
     I have 8 Dunhills I was lucky enough to acquire in London in the early
1980's when the dollar was high.  I also have a couple of Petersons, an Upshall
a nice Bari freehand, and a freehand made by Alpha (made in Israel) that I am
very fond of.  I recently purchased a "junior" Sherlock Holmes Baskerville that
is becoming my favorite as it breaks in and a beautiful straight grained Ser
 Sacopo that I have not tried yet.
     I currently live in Morgantown, WV (I work at the university), a nice town
where tobacco tends to be chewed, not smoked.  I rely on mail order.
     I have a question for any Bay Area members of your group.  I used to
frequent Druckers in Berkeley when I was an undergraduate.  I visited the area

        Steve:  I am writing to express my concern about a recent posting
in the pipes and cigars group.  We have an adult member who talked about
sharing a pipe on his bed with eleven year olds from the neighborhood. I
believe this same person has stated that he is a member of the Man/Boy love
organization.  While I am all for leaving consenting adults alone to do
what they please I can not accept this man boy thing...as a parent I know
eleven year olds are not adults. I feel my silence on this situation is
tacit approval therefore let me say that I do not feel this person belongs
in the pipes list or maybe I don't want to belong to a group that would
have him as a member...Am I alone here or have you had other letters?  I
don't want to read about anything but pipes and tobacco, especially not
perverted fantasies or actual experiences.  What does the membership think?
I guess I have to decide if I want to be part of a group that I find very
enjoyable, that has an advocate of child molestation as a member.  What are
your thoughts?         

[ Charles, yours has been the most civil, so I'm printing it. I've
just re-read "Kevin's" submission. As far as I can see, he never said
that he molested the kids, or that he advocated doing so, or that he
belongs to NAMBLA, or anything of that sort.  (In fact, I've checked
the back Digests; as far as I can determine in a quick scan, no one
has mentioned "NAMBLA," "Man/Boy," or their trivial variants before
now.) 

In any case, I don't kick members off the list because of their
beliefs.  Anyway, "Kevin" has followed up, and you may breathe a
little easier after reading it. But I may in the future reject
submissions that could place me or other members at legal risk.

And please see my posting, also below. -S. ]

I hadn't realized potential trouble, Steve, and I thank you for
taking the time to change the names.

&gt; For some strange reason, while I would never give these boys cigarettes
&gt; when I smoked them (and they would ask me - believe me!), I had no
&gt; qualms sharing a bowlful with them.
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts?
&gt; 
&gt; [ Kevin, it's kind of a delicate situation, unfortunately, and
&gt; involved some risk for both you and Nelson and Andy, especially given
&gt; certain other details about you that I've left out.  The boys' parents
&gt; or some busybody might not see your letter in a good light.  So I've
&gt; taken the liberty of removing some identifying information from your
&gt; letter, and changing your name and those of the boys.

Again - thanks.  Things that I don't see anything wrong with, others
might see something wrong with.  I hadn't seen anything wrong with
sharing a bowlful of pipe tobacco with the kids, but others might
see things that aren't there.

&gt; Most of us who tried our first pipe that young, did so on our own. I
&gt; did.  There are a few exceptions. A friend of mine told me once, in
&gt; glowing terms, of one time he had stayed overnight in his uncle's
&gt; house. The uncle left some Parodi cigars by his bedside. For a
&gt; 12-year-old, that was a wonderful act of comradeship from an older
&gt; man, an acceptance of him into the world of men.  On that level, I
&gt; think it's great! 

That's basically how I view it.  I have a big problem with these kids
taking up smoking (which they haven't much, outside of trying them
with their little buddies) but for some reason, I see pipes in a
completely different light.

&gt; Perhaps in later years the boys will see it as a rite of manhood.
&gt; It's certainly an experience they won't forget. -S. ]

After I posted that message, I saw them running around their apartments
and they stopped to chat with me.  They haven't told anyone about
their pipe smoking experience as they don't want to get in trouble
with their parents, but they kept saying, "That was SO cool!  That was
SO *COOL*!!".  Nelson wants them both to stop by again and light up
again with me, but I said that it probably wouldn't be a good idea.
Thankfully these are understanding kids, and they understand.

I would be tremendously honored if I see them 10 years down the line
and they say, "Remember when we smoked that pipe with you?".  As long
as they don't take up cigarettes, I will be pleased :-)

I'm making an effort to keep them from doing too much in the way
of cigarettes.  Since I've mostly quit smoking cigarettes, Nelson
has said that "cigarettes just don't taste as good as they used to",
and Andy has stopped stealing cigarettes from the corner store for
them to smoke. [a pack would last them a week or more between the
two of them].

&gt; From: Jeffery Glenn Hayes &lt;??????@?????.???&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I have smoked a pipe steadily for nineteen years now, and I started when 
&gt; I was only sixteen.  At that time, my mother noted that I was of legal 
&gt; age and hence could make my own decision.  I read the Surgeon General's 
&gt; report on smoking, and found that pipe smokers live on average two years 
&gt; longer than non-smokers.  I'm sure the readership is familiar with this 
&gt; statistic.

I'm not familiar with it, but I'm glad to hear it!  I would guess
that it has something to do with the relaxation that pipe smoking
gives the smoker.

[ Kevin, as I said, your original letter generated a lot of heat,
including Charles' letter above and a couple that I couldn't
print. But it doesn't seem like anything bad has come of
this. Nonetheless, I will print my own response, which I wrote before
I received your followup. I'd really like to drop this whole

<a name="29">Subject: PD #184 ("Kevin's" letter)</a>

This concerns "Kevin's" letter of PD #184. It marks the first time
that I've ever actually had to invoke the no-flame rule. Briefly,
Kevin (not his real name), an adult, wrote that he'd gotten himself
into a situation where he passed a pipe around with two boys,
pseudonymously named "Andy" and "Nelson."  He didn't say that anything
else happened.

First, if it's true (and I don't have any real idea whether it is),
the most that Kevin is legally guilty of is maybe a misdemeanor. He's
definitely guilty of two remarkably bad pieces of judgment: letting
the incident happen in the first place, and submitting it to a public
forum like the Digest.  I tried to cast the incident in its best
possible light in my comments.  The subject is a sensitive one, and it
was, quite frankly, a stretch.

Second, one member urged me to turn Kevin in to the police.  I flatly
refuse to do this, to Kevin or any other member.  I am neither a cop
nor a rat.  Besides, I have no indication that anything illegal was
done, or that the submission was really anything more than fiction.
And furthermore, it could just possibly wreck his life, and those of
Andy and Nelson, for no good reason.

Only Kevin knows whether or not he has a problem.  He is the one who
has to deal with it, not us.  If he does not have a problem, then no
harm has been done.  If he does have a problem, or if one is
developing, I'd urge him to stop having any contact with kids, and to
seek professional help immediately.  Either way, he should take the
membership's response as a warning to be DAMN careful how he behaves
around kids.

Finally, fercryinoutloud, folks, please THINK before you submit
incriminating material!  I mean, talking about sneaking a few Habanas
past Customs is one thing, but this stuff is bloody serious!  For ME
as well as you!!!

Oh, well. Let's hope for the best to come out of this, and try to...

                                Smoke in peace,

Hello All!

All that talk in the last digest piqued my interest in the Esoterica
Tobacciana line, so I called Piedmont Tobacconist (510-652-PIPE) for a
brochure.  For everyone's information, I transcribed the pamphlet.
(note: I have no commercial interest, this is informational only)

from Esoterica Tobacciana pamphlet:

                         for the Connoisseur

                              **********

                              Esoterica
                             Tobacconiana

                         Esoterica Tobacciana
                              introduces
                        Fine Vintage Aged Pipe

                                  *

There are still a few pipe tobacco companies that age, blend, process
and mature their tobacco using the old time honoured, traditional
methods.  One of the best is J.F. Germain and Son on the Channel islands
of Jersey and Guernsey.  Although closer to France than to England,
there is no mistaking the English accents and fine English tobaccos that
issue forth from this 170 year old company, still owned and operated on
the original premises by the fifth generation descendents of the
founder.

J.F. Germain and Son have always used only the highest grades of tobacco
leaf obtainable.  They continue to age their tobacco before and after
blending; remove all stems and veins from the leaves, and prepare all
their blends in small batches using hand labour extensively.  Their
excellent mixtures, including the aromatics, contain no glycols,
glycerides, artificial flavourings or preservatives.  Germain's
aromatics contain only extracts of natural fruit, liquorice and Cognac.

Now these superb tobacco blends are obtainable in the United States. 
Esoterica Tobacciana of Oakland, California imports the complete range
of 17 blends and flakes.  All of the mixtures are available in bulk in
either 1/2 pound or 1 pound packaging.  Seven of the mixtures are also
available in vacuum packed 2 ounce metal tins:

And So To Bed:
  A soft, but full-bodied mixture for the evening.
Penzance:
  Finest English Mottled Flake.
Pembroke:
  Choice English, Cognac blend.
Margate:
  Best full English Tobacco.
Dunbar:
  A marriage of seven premium Virginia tobaccos with Louisiana Perique.
Dorchester:
  A rich, full, matured Virginia with Louisiana Perique.
Tilbury:
  A broad-cut Extra Matured Virginia.

Like fine wine or malt scotch, all of Germain's mixtures are aged after
blending so that the flavours intermarry and mature.  One usually does
not drink a newly bottled wine or year old scotch, so do not pass up
this opportunity to experience the taste sensation of vintage aged
tobaccos.  Acquaint yourself with tobacco blended and aged using methods
that have been respected and refined for 170 years.

                                  *

                         Distinctive Tobaccos

                        for the Good Old Days

Brighton

A notably smooth blend of six Virginia tobaccos, light in colour and
taste, soft and satisfying.

An outstanding, well balanced mixture of four Virginias, pressed until
reddish-brown and then fully rubbed up.  A truly traditional tobacco for
the most discerning palate.

Burley and air-cured leaf.  Matured by a special process over 100 years
old, producing a unique natural aroma and a piquant flavour.

Virginias until jet-black, resulting in a symphony of delicate aromas
and exquisite flavors.

thoroughly satisfying tobacco has an English pedigree with marvelous
smoking characteristics.

Dunbar

A mature recipe of seven types of Virginia tobaccos blended with
Louisiana Perique, lightly pressed for several days to mellow the
mixture, then cut into flakes and rubbed up.  A high quality blend with
a savory taste and a fine bouquet.  An outstanding tobacco with a rich
depth of flavour.

Ramsgate

Selected dark and Golden Virginias are hot pressed until black, with
added liquorice essence and a pleasant arome enhancement.  A savory,
slow burning, non-biting tobacco with lasting fragrance.

in colour and rich in taste.  Exceedingly mellow and easy to rub out.

A marriage of air-cured leaf and Burley with selected dark Virginia.

Virginias pressed until reddish-brown and then rubbed out, plus Golden

leaves the pipe clean and dry.

Scarborough

A refined, long-lasting blend of Golden and dark Virginias, lightly
pressed, cut and rubbed out.  A soft, smooth mixture.

Margate

A classical English mixture done in the "old style" of many of the fine
tobaccos that have now disappeared from the market place.  Choice
Orientals and generous quantities of premium Cyprian Latakia keynote
this rich, full-bodied blend.  A well-balanced, robust and eminently
satisfying smoke.

And So To Bed

This mixture is absolutely ideal for the evening, ergo...we borrowed the
name from the diaries of Samuel Pepys Esquire.  Finest grade Virginia
and Maryland type tobaccos are carefully aged and blended with Greek
"Oriental" leaf and top-grade Cyprian Latakia.  The blend is then
specially processed and additionally matured to produce a mellow, full
strength smoke with rich flavour and unique aroma.

St. Ives

A totally new concept for the smoker of fine aromatic tobacco.  Dark and
Golden Virginias are blended with Black Virginia Cavendish and portions
of Greek, Oriental and Cyprian Latakia tobaccos.  Enhanced with a subtly
scented fruit extract.  An aromatic English!

Hastings

An aromatic tobacco made in the same time honoured tradition as our
English and Virginia blends.  Five types of Virginia tobacco and an
equal proportion of Black Virginia Cavendish with an added aromatic
essence.  A soft and gentle smoke of outstanding quality.

Penzance

This outstanding cross-cut English flake is unbelievable!  A wonderful
complex secret recipe of the finest Virginias, choice Turkish and
Orientals and Cyprian Latakia, all hand blended together, hard pressed
and broad cut into thick flakes.  Long matured and easily crumbled to
facilitate pipe filing.  This is one of the finest traditional English
Flakes available anywhere.  (Known in the United Kingdom as "Krumble
Kake.")

Pembroke

A luxury English blend (Margate) is married with a fine French Cognac. 
This outstanding mixture is a "match made in heaven." Rich taste with a
character to match.  A symphony of delicate aromas and elegant flavours.

I was busy ploughing around the library and ran across U.S. Senate

also contained a research report on many cigar brands, some of which I 
reproduced below.  The report stated:

"The Federal Trade Commission's laboratory has determined the "tar" (dry

1966 (31 F.R. 14278)...  Results are based on a test of not less than 90 
small cigars of each variety.

"The 'tar' content is report [sic] to the nearest 1/10th milligram [TPM] and 
the nicotine content to the nearest 1/100th milligrams, each with 
appropriate statistical values.  The average weight is reported in grams
per small cigar and the butt length range to the nearest 1/10th

<a name="31">Subject: Radio Shack Calibration !!!</a>

Hello Fellow Puffers:

Well hells bells... I read the #183 Pipe Digest and was very impressed with
the posting concerning "How to Re-Callibrate Your Radio Shack 63-855
Hygrometer." It was difficult to determine who created this posting
originally, (Peter Shanken? Bob Curtis? Both?) but THANK YOU !!!!!

I would like to add some new information. I have one of the older Radio Shack
hygrometers #63-844, but do you think that stopped me? You give me an
opportunity to take something I know nothing about apart, I'm there! Plus, my
Dad was a quality assurance engineer and he wouldn't have put up with that
much of a error factor.

Well the salt portion of this whole procedure is sweet indeed - so simple, I
felt like I was watching "Mr. Wizard" again. After doing this I found that my
hygrometer was a whopping +8% off. Now... I'm not great with math, so I
decided to correct the problem instead of just knowing how much it's off by.
The problem was, which "pot" screws to adjust, since the instructions were
for a #63-855. Well for those of you that have the same model as I do, there
are two circut boards in it, the top one is for the temperature and the
bottom is for the humidity. The "pot" screw CLOSEST to the battery
compartment is the one you need to adjust. And yes, as was mentioned in the
first posting, it does take some fiddling!!! There were times I'd adjust the
screw, and see no change.  But I finally got that puppy within + -1%. 

Let it be known that I tinkered where no person in their right mind should,
and this is no guarantee that it'll work for you (especially knowing Radio
Sahck stuff - yours could be laid out differently?) But if your bold, go
where no man has gone before and make it right!

Thanks Gang!

As per your article on a.s.c, please subscribe me to your mailing list.  My
preferred email address appears below. 

I love fine cigars.  I adore the aroma of pipe tobacco, tho for the life of me 
I can't find any combination of pipe and blend that I enjoy smoking.  All of
the rituals and accouterments surrounding pipe smoking seems very interesting
-- perhaps I can pick up some pointers from the list.  If not, I'm very
satisfied with my Excaliburs. 

But, pray tell, what are "fine cigarettes"?

Cheers!

Do any PD subscribers live in/near the Monterey Peninsula, Santa Cruz or even 
the South Bay? If so, I would welcome information about any pipe-related clubs 
or events (e.g., dinners) in the area. 

I live on the Monterey Peninsula and find it hard to connect with pipe
smokers, although I know there must be some around. Monterey has a
pretty decent pipe &amp; tobacco shop, but the staff don't appear to have
any leads. They also seem to cater to a more established, senior
clientele (I'm in my early 30s) and I'm not sure that I'm considered
to be as serious as I am. Cigar smokers appear to be pretty numerous
around here, but pipe smokers seem relatively less common.

I'd be willing to drive up to San Jos; SF is harder to manage, but in 
desperation, I suppose I could make the trek. I'd appreciate any input that PD 
readers might have!

Mark your calendar!  The Ohio Pipe Collectors will be holding our 1995
swap/sell pipe show on Saturday, September 23.  We have reserved half of
the main ballroom of the Holiday Inn at 328 West Lane Avenue in Columbus
(across from OSU) for the show.  There is no home OSU game that day, and,
as far as I know, no other pipe-related event is taking place anywhere. 
Admission will be free to the public.  The Holiday Inn is holding 10
rooms (single or double occupancy) at a special rate of $70.00 for anyone
who wishes to come in on Friday or stay over Saturday night.  Call
614-294-4848 to reserve a room, and mention the OPC show.  We hope that a
successful show this year will allow us to consider even more space and a
two-day show next year.  Here are some highlights at this point.

Fifty tables, each six feet long X 30 inches wide, will be available for
rent.  Each table will be $20.00 until June 15 and $25.00 after June 15. 
Tables will be available to anyone (individuals, smoke shops, whoever)
strictly on a first-come, first-served basis.

We will be writing every pipe shop and pipe maker in Ohio and asking them
to support our show by renting a table and/or donating merchandise in
return for recognition and promotion.

All donated merchandise will be used to provide three prizes for a
pipe-smoking contest to occur at 2:00 and for a raffle to be conducted at
4:30.  Raffle tickets will be 50 cents each.  Plus, anyone who buys a new
or estate pipe from one of the tables during the show will receive one
free raffle ticket per pipe purchased.  Winners need not be present to win.

If any Digest subscribers require more information, please write me, and
I'll try to provide it.  Also, if you can put show flyers to good use,
please let me know the number and your mailing address, and I'll get them
in the mail.

dear steve at al.,
     a quick note to bring you up to date on the latest activities of the 
capital area pipe smokers (caps).  fifteen brave souls disregarded a driving 
march snowstorm to attend our last meeting.   member george riddile showed 
his outstanding collection of dunhill pipes and gave a rather entertaining 
post-mortem (probably not a good metaphor) of the big smoke.  rather 
surprising was that unbeknownst to the 15 members in attendance (we actually 
have about 30 on the books), 5 of us are avid motorcyclists and a re 
planning some excursions.  btw, speaking of excursions, the next caps 
function will be a mid-april bus excursion to chambersburg, pa to visit 
pipemaker james boswell.  we may even get to see his famous dictionary!  any 
readers interested in joining us should get in touch with me through this 
list or at home (703/273-5737) for specifics on date, time cost, etc.  caps 
is always lookng for new members.  those interested in joining and meeting 
our rigorous screening requirements (you must have a pulse), call.  for 
those of you visiting the dc area and interested in attending one of our 
dinner meetings, pse give me a call.  our requirements in this instance are 
even less rigorous.
     i thought the subscribers to pd would be interested in the sale of 
tobacciana-related items from the collection of king merendino.  photos and 
a price list are available from king upon request by phone (703/541-4539) or

    I ordered some of Bob Hamlin's PCCA "Equinox" blend last week and 
received it just a couple of days ago. This stuff is just awesome. Upon 
opening the tin, the wonderful aroma of the virginias came through mixed 
in with the smoky overtone of the latakia. I loaded up my Peterson and  
set flame to tobacco. The flavor and smoothness of this mixture was 
simply unbelievable and it lasted from first puff to last, burning down 
to a nice white ash. Joe Hurley was right in his recommendation of this 
excellent blend when he mentioned it about two PD ago. It's too bad that 
Bob only has a relatively small quantity of this stuff around. Another 
blend that I will rave about, given the opportunity to, is Esoterica 
Tobbacciana's "And So To Bed". I like to reserve this during the night 
just before--coincidentally enough--retiring for the night. Have you or 
anyone else in the group tried this blend? Thanks for bearing with me in

Greetings folks,
I am curious about a local pipemaker my area.  I wonder if any of you
knowledgable people have heard of him, and if you could give me any info.
The man's name ( or at least it's the name on the pipes ) is Andre.  The
pipemaker lives in Santa Cruz, CA, and he took over the business from his
father.  The briar he uses was also from his father, and is pretty old.
The styles of these pipes are quite beautiful.  He makes carvings around
the top of the bowl sometimes, almost like a sunflower, or he carves a
little on the shank.  The pipes are hand-made, and are quite distinctive,
but I've never heard of them.  The prices of the pipes seem to range from
$60 up to $110, or at least that's what they were at the tobacconist's.
The place where I saw them is Piedmont Tobacco, which is in Oakland, CA.
The owner seemed nice, but I thought I should throw this out there to you
and see what you think.  Are there any small pipe-making operations that
you can reccommend?

Thanks.

Yours Etc.,
David Tracy

Steve,
The instructions on how to test the Radio Shack hygrometer were fascinating.  I
gave it a try, but I am baffled by the results.  I followed the instructions
faithfully.  After leaving the zip-lock bag overnight, my hygrometer read 68%.
By the evening it read 64%!  It's supposed to read 75.  I have a hard believing
my device is so far off.  After all, my cigars seem fine.  The reading in my
Rubbermaid box moves between 69 and 71. I wonder what's going on and am curious
what others have found.

Keep up the good work.

Dear Steve,
           Boy, this is fantastic!  I'm having trouble getting any regular
work done, with all these back issues to amaze me!  I'm hooked.  Could you
send me issues 179-182, so that I am up-to-date in the conversation?  I
didn't realize this was going on.

      Query on protocol, manners:  I have some tobacco I would like to swap
for other tobacco.  Is that something that can be mentioned in the Digest?
if not, where would you recommend I turn?

     Again, this PD is super!  It gives the hobby a whole new dimension,
and I don't feel so damn lonely!

Many thanks, John

<a name="43">Subject: Re: #3(4) Your Pipes Digest s...</a>

Thanks for sending me copies of the digest.  Lot's of good material to read
while enjoying my pipe. I do have an input on resources.  Wally Frank which
sold pipes, cigars and pipe tobacco closed.  The name of "Wally Frank" was
sold to Finck Cigar Company in San Antonio Texas.  They put out a catalog
under the Wally Frank name and also the Finck Cigar company name.  They have
been in business over 100 years and make a line of cigars called Travis Club
which is sold mostly in Texas at drug stores and by mail. They also have
cigars made for them in Honduras and the Dominican Republic.

They have an 800 number which is 1-800-221-0638

Their address is:

Finck Cigar Company
P.O. Box 831007
San Antonio, Texas 78283-1007

On a trip to San Antonio I went by the factory.  There is no organized tour,
but a gentleman working in the shipping department gave me a tour and some
samples.  They make a 100% tobacco cigar by machine. The machines are very
old, but still working. For the price they aren't bad. Most of the workers
are women and most have been employeed there for years.

I'll look forward to other issues of the digest.

Don Churn

<a name="44">Subject: BBC World Service "Outlook" segment on cigar smoking in the US</a>

The BBC World Service daily airs a sort of current-events "magazine" called
"Outlook".  Today (7 April 1995) one of the segments was on the "rebirth" of
cigar smoking in the U.S.  While I personally don't like cigars (I stick
exclusively to --- and greatly enjoy --- pipes) I listened to the segment.
(Twice... it's aired during both morning and evening broadcasts to the U.S.
For those in North America who want to listen in, it's relayed via Sackville,
British Columbia on 9.515MHz mornings and 5.975MHz evenings.  "Outlook" is
aired at 1405 UTC and 2305 UTC and lasts 55 minutes.  [10:05am and 7:05pm EDT]
Outside the U.S. there are other frequencies, e.g. 12.095MHz in Europe ---
also receivable in the eastern U.S. afternoons on most days.)

There wasn't anything in the segment that anyone on this list doesn't already
know via recent Digests, but it might be an eye-opener to folks not on our
good list --- including a brief mention of the DC smoke-in and of women taking
up cigars.  It also noted that Alfred Dunhill has been giving introductory
cigar-smoking "seminars" in New York.

<a name="45">Subject: Making a list of Canadian/Mexican stores</a>

Steve:

Many thanks for your wonderful digest. I've been lurking here for a few
issues, so I figure it's high time to drop you a note. I'm mainly a cigar
smoker, having given up pipes for cigarettes a few years ago. I prefer the
Arturo Fuente's by far as a "regular" smoke, but I always try and find
something new to try.

The reason for this note is twofold, though. I am trying to compile a
comprehensive list of Tobacconists and Tobacco stores in Canada and Mexico
that are close enough to our borders to visit without taking a vacation.
These should be places withing a day's drive, actually. This is for people
who want to try a real Cuban cigar, but don't know where to go to get them.
I would also like to post addresses and phone numbers of stores that are
near major tourist centers, such as Whistler and Cabo San Lucas. I plan to
post this list in several places, and it will be called "The Border Store
FAQ". It'll be posted in AOL, Compu$erve, Alt.smokers.cigars, and also on
the WWW, thanks to a very generous donation of a page. I would also like to
post it to your digest, if you will have it that is.

What I need from your readers are addresses and phone numbers of Tobacco
shops that can be easily reached from the U.S. Please send them to:
???????@?????.??? or ???????@???.???.

Thanks a bunch, Steve! Happy Smoking!

<a name="46">Subject: Internet Pipe Digest</a>

Hi -

I was supposed to do this a long time ago, but haven't had time.  I would
like to give a little information about myself for the benefit of the
readers of this digest.  My name is Nanosh Lucas, I'm a student at Foothill
College in California (Los Altos), I actually hardly ever smoke anything.
I do, however, know pipes fairly well.  I've had the benefit of working
with Marty Pulvers at Sherlock's Haven for some time now, and the majority
of the pipes (at least, the used ones) find their way through through my
sight, and most often; my hands.  I refurbish them, I guess you could say.
I don't like Savinelli's too much; their stems are cheap and too quick
(except for the autographs) to oxidize.  Dunhills are ok, but I like Ser
Jacopo's, the most.  I have a strong dislike for meerschaums and other
non-wood pipes.  If I were to smoke anything, it would probably be a
fruity-sort of tobacco; I don't, however, have enough experience to judge
tobacco's.  If anyone has any questions as to how to "refurbish" a pipe, I
have done plenty to know, so I would be happy to answer any questions.
Enough about me; Marty asked me to pass along information that pertains to
questions in the March 16th edition:

To ??????@???.???:

Much apologies for your recent misfortune.  Marty would like you to know
that he has lots of Charatans, Ashtons, Tilsheads(&amp;Upshalls).  Tilsheads
and Upshalls are actually made in the same place, though Upshalls are the
more upper status/price pipes.  He has great deals, ask anybody.  If you
(or anyone else) would like more information, you can email me at
???????@????.??? until Marty gets an email address of his own.
You were also wondering about American made pipes (of which we carry many).
Randy Wiley, Paul Perri, Roush (used), John Weiner &amp; Andre, and David
Jones (some used, some large unsmoked) are all American pipe makers that he
could give you a $100-$130 price on.

&gt;Steve, if you would rather I email this directly to TSUJoe than clutter up the
&gt;Digest with this, just drop me a line,    thanks...

Dear Sir,

<a name="48">Subject: Tobacco Descriptions</a>

Steve,

Here's a listing of tobacco descriptions I received from M. Arndt in 
response to my request.
I thought it might prove useful to others in the Digest (if you have not 
already received a copy from Mr. Arndt).

Dunhill:    (made in UK)

   'Nightcap'
   A richer, more thoughtful mixture for the evening. A subtle blending of
   the best American leaf with 50% Latakia and small leaved Turkish, matured
   by the blenders and specially processed for a slow, lasting smoke. Just
   prior to packing, costly Perique tobacco is added to enhance the bouquet.  
   Full strength.                 

   'Standard Mixture' Mild and Medium 
   A traditional 'English' smoking mixture using the finest grades of pure
   tobacco. Cyprus Latakia and Oriental tobacco from the Mediterranean is
   blended with the flue cured grades from East Carolina and Georgia lightly
   toasted in a drying drum to enhance the flavour. This, Dunhill's most
   popular tobacco, is available in both Mild and Medium forms, the latter
   providing a cooler, richer smoke ideal for the beginner.
   Mild and mediun in strength.

   'Early Morning Pipe'
   A traditional Dunhill mixture of mild and delicate flavour providing a
   satisfying, slow burning smoke. Sweet burning Oriental tobacco is carefully
   blended with bright and red Virginias, pressed and lightly stoved. The
   blend is further enhanced by medium fired Latakia. Ideal for the 'first
   pipe' arousing the pulse for the further pleasures of the day.
   Mild in strength.

   'My Mixture No.965'    
   This distinctive mixture has found international popularity with
   connoisseurs of full-bodied tobacco and is often described as 'the finest
   smoking mixture ever produced'. Choicest small Latakia leaves are used to
   impart the rich nutty flavour and coolness required by our customers.
   Bright oriental leaves from Macedonia are used for sweetness. To complete
   the blend we added Brown Cavendish tobacco rich in natural oils and aroma.
   A delightful fragrant smoke for the confirmed pipe smoker.  
   Mild to medium in strength

   The 'Royal Yacht' Mixture
   Truly a luxurious, aromatic tobacco. Highest quality Lemon and Bronzed
   Virginia leaves are carefully conditioned to ensure sweetness and are added
   to rich, heavy-bodied Virginia noted for coolness. A unique flavour is
   added to the final blend to enhance the subtle and piquant aroma. This
   internationally famous mixture is ideal for smoking when in company.   
   Mild in strength.            

   'Light Flake'  
   A medium strength cut flake of selected grades of Lemon and Bronzed
   Virginias. One of our most demanding brands to process, both in time and
   expertise, to ensure the quality expected by Dunhill traditions. Ideal for
   sportsman and those who smoke outdoors. If unrubbed, Light Flake will keep
   fresh in the pouch much longer than Mixtures.  
   Mild in strength.         

   'London Mixture'  
   A good example of the skilful blending of Latakia with Virginia and Turkish
   leaf. Being of medium cut and strength it is ideal for the beginner. It has
   a pleasant aroma and a flavour which never seems to cloy.  
   Medium in strength.    

   'Elizabethan Mixture'
   A romantic Virginia mixture using tobacco grades from the 'New World'.
   Tobaccos grown in the areas of North America first colonized during the
   reign of Queen Elizabeth I are pressed to darken and enrich then carefully
   cut to ensure even burning. Costly black Perique is finally added to give
   the blend a stimulating flavour.
   Medium in strength.    

 other comments:

   Standard Mild    mild     - "not a whole lot stronger than
   Standard Medium  "mild"   -  your aromatic cavendish", trad. English
   Royal Yacht      long cut, mild, recommended as summer/morning smoke
                    Lemon and Bronze Virginia
   Mixture 965      Brown Cavendish, Latakia, Macedonia
   Early Morning    Latakia, Oriental, Bright and Red Virginia (lighter)
   London Mixture   Latakia blend
   Nightcap         Perique, heavy Latakia, Turkish, Virginia
   Elizabethan      Latakia/Perique blend, heavy, 'hot smoking, acrid'
   Virginia Blend   100% Virginia, English oriented taste
   Light Flake      100% Virginia, medium strength, rather sweet

MacBaren:   (made in Denmark)

   Dark Twist       comparable to Cope's Escudo
   Golden Extra     mild, Virginia
   Latakia Mixture  mild, spun cut
   Burley           100% Burley, should be very mild
   Plumcake         Navy Cavendish, Virginia/Burley with dark rum
   Scottish Blend   ?, one user alternates this with Amphora Red Pouch, mild
   Virginia #1      100% Virginia, "very distinctive,original taste", mild
   Navy Flake       heavy but sweet
   &lt;general info&gt;   favor Burley as the main ingredient, stronger blends

See Steve's letter later this issue. And thanks to both Vince and

Also, Steve Johnson (????????@???.???) has sent me a copy of a report
by Rep. Thomas Bliley to Congress on the issue of environmental
tobacco smoke. (He's on our side, folks!) 60 pages long, and much
technical detail and political intrigue.  I've asked Steve Beaty and
Richard Geller to put it up at the Web and FTP sites.  I'd also be
glad to send a copy to anyone who requests it. Briarman says you're
free to put it up at your own site, as long as you tell him you've
done so. Many thanks to Steve for taking up the task of scanning it
all in!

And, as some members noticed, Your Moderator sent out issue #185 with
the title, "Pipes Digest #187". When I have a spare hour, I should
really fix the scripts to detect this sort of thing. It's happened too
often, usually when I've been rushing to get an issue out. Sorry!

Personal note: After having subscribed for 20 years, I've written to
Scientific American and asked that my subscription be cancelled. The
May "worldwide tobacco epidemic" issue is the reason; as always, I do
not voluntarily support people who persecute me. Sigh. The quality of
the material has been declining in recent years anyway, and I just
haven't had the time to read it much lately.  If you feel the same
way, you might want to consider whether you need to support them
anymore. Thanks to Kam Kashani (????@???.???) for the heads-up on this
one, a few issues back. And, as always...

Greetings Steve.

I was astonished to get such a quick response to my request to join and am
pleased with the first offerings (are you using a robot?). A little about
myself, started smoking the pipes and cigars at 18 when I was a philosophy
student in college and thought it looked cool. Changed majors (several times)
and eventually graduated. Just left active military service (down-sized
officer) and am now a 36 yr old Systems Functional Analyst working for
Lockheed Martin. Have about 45 pipes of all sort (haven't managed to get a
Dunhill yet). Prefer latakia based english blends but will try aromatics on a
whim. Also enjoy a good cigar. Since one of my hobbies is woodwork, have also
tried my hand at pipe carving and have done a couple of freehand styles.
Great info online, keep up the good work. Happy puffing.

<a name="7">Subject: Are big-name pipes really better?</a>

Hi fellow smokers,

I'd like to ask some of those with some knowledge or an opinion about
the 'better' brands of pipes. Could you describe the difference in the
smoking experience between pipes by Peterson or Savinelli etc. and
other, lesser-known brands of briar pipe? What makes those pipes
different from a standard, lesser-known-brand of briar pipe?

I'm afraid I don't own a new brand-name pipe to try an experiment of
my own. I have one old small-bowled silver-band K&amp;P (is that
Peterson's), and smoking in it isn't any different than other pipes I
have. In fact, my best pipe is an old cracked and repaired
meerschaum. What am I missing?

I hope to gain an insight on the 'quality' facet of pipe smoking.

Thanks,

Boaz

[ Nothing! I have a $1 pipe that smokes great and an $80 custom-carved
deal that smokes lousy. The higher-priced pipes do tend to have fewer
fills, sand pits, and other defects, but IMHO these do not affect
smoking quality. -S. ]

<a name="11">Subject: Wanted: A place to sack out</a>

Hi Steve,

Enclosed is info on:  My pipe bio, a trip around the U.S.A., in a search of
my small, quality pipe collection, a smoking problem/question or two--

My Pipe Bio:
----------------
I started smoking a pipe about 3 months ago, after a very good friend of
mine, Vern, and I got to talking about it at lunch one day.  He had just
turned 40, and said, "You know, I've always wanted to smoke a pipe, and I
think that now that I'm 40, I'm old enough."  I was pleasently surprised to
hear him say that, because I had always had a pipe dream &lt;grin&gt; of someday
taking this pastime up.  I always felt, though, that I was "too young" to
smoke a pipe.  In my mind, society didn't accept the idea of younger people
smoking pipes.  You've got to pay your dues before you're old enough to
warrant that privilege.  Vern's step was enough to give me that final nudge.

I'm 33, and at least for the time being, I'm still a closet pipe smoker.
 I've smoked cigars in the past, but it wasn't really what I yearned for
(although I still enjoy a cigar if I have no pipe available), and I pretty
much only smoke my pipe when I'm alone, or around very close friends.  I
enjoy it immensely, and because of that, I'm thinking that I'll probably be
coming out of the closet sooner than I think.  This is for the plain fact
that I'd like to feel more comfortable carrying my pipe around and smoking it
when I feel the call, regardless of what the world may expect.

As for my motivation to pick up the pastime, my Dad smoked a pipe, briefly,
when I was young (too young to remember, actually), and also I had always
liked the aroma of pipe smoke.  More significant to me, though, was the fact
that most, if not all, of my experiences with pipe smoking men were that they
were very relaxed, methodical, mellow, peaceful, content people.  I have an
image in my mind of a  man in his 50's, smoking his pipe while in his
workshop fiddling with some woodworking project.  He never would never get
too excited about anything, and really seemed to be working with wood as an
excuse to be out enjoying the pipe.  I enjoyed the sweet smelling, character-f
illed smoke-- a real contrast to the cigarette stink that, as a kid, I had
always associated "smoke" with, until that point.  I don't even know if I
ever actually saw the man that I described, but I do have a strong memories
of him.  Figure that one out.

Vern paved the way to my pipe smoking and I followed a week or so later.  We
started at our pipe shop in the local mall:

The Briar Shop
313 Columbia Center
Kennewick, WA  99336

They have a "starter kit" that was kind of neat.  For about $35, you got a
nice no-name (?) briar pipe, of good quality with a straight stem, a tobacco
pouch, a pipe nail, some cleaners, smoker's matches and a little instruction
pamplet for first time smokers.  Add to that the cost of our first ounce of
tobacco (and all applicable @(#)*% state sales taxes), and it came to about
$40 to have my first real experience with pipe smoking.  It was just as I had
daydreamed of, in years past.  I LIKE it!

I was back to the shop within a month or so and got a short little sandblast
1/2 bent (and I mean _short_), that has a stamp on the stem that says,
"Sport".  I like it because it's small enough to carry around if I really
want to, and I also wanted to have a bent.  I've found, though, that it
smokes a little warmer (I think because there isn't much briar to it) than my
bigger pipe.

Pipe's I'm Looking For:
-----------------------------
Now I'm thinking that I would like to build a very small (VERY) collection of
good quality pipes.  I would like a meerchum (I always wonder if I'm spelling
that right), because I've read here that it's a cool smoke, which I'm
pursuing.  I'd also like to have the obligatory Sherlock Holmes (and the word
"obligatory", I think, is obligatory), and would like to have one pipe that I
just really, really like because it smokes so good.  Right now, my "starter
pipe" holds that spot, but then again, I haven't had much to compare it to,
so I hold high hopes that there are better smokes out there.

Pipe Smoking Questions:
-------------------------------
In attempting to keep my pipe lit, I started by tamping the tobacco
periodically, and after a few days of that I began to think that it was
knocking ash down to where I would be drawing it through the stem.  So, I
stopped doing that.  Somehow, I didn't connect the fact that I had to relight
so often with the fact that I stopped tamping.  I recently started tamping
again and found that it stays lit MUCH longer, if not all the way to the
bottom.  Is that the experience of any of you seasoned pipe smokers?

Question 2:  I'm wondering if the only way to keep the stem/bowl dry is to
keep a pipe cleaner handy and swab it once or twice.  Is there another way,
short of doing a lot of spitting in the process?  This method doesn't appeal
to me.  Also, I eventually get a zap of nasty, bitter juice, and it ruins the
whole smoking experience for me (dippers and chewers may disagree with my
description as "nasty, bitter", but I tried chewing once or twice and I find
it no different).  What can I do to keep things drier?  I've seen a little
screen that you can buy to put in the bottom of the bowl.  Are there any
opinions on that?  Would it keep the tobacco off the bottom of the bowl and
thus above the moisture that settles in the bottom from soaking the tobacco?
 Where is the moisture coming from?  Is it from the tobacco or me?

My Big Trip Across the U.S.A.:
---------------------------------------
Now, on to what is biggest in my life the last few weeks:  In pursuit of my
pipe collection (partially), I am going on the road, very, very soon :).  Due
to government cutbacks, the company where I worked had a voluntary reduction
of force.  They offered incentives to get people to volunteer to be laid off.
 I volunteered, because I wasn't all that happy with my job anymore, anyway.
 Seemed like a good day to move on.  Consequently, I'm an unemployed systems
analyst for those who might have work for me--even for times as short as a
day or so (read below), or even an hour-- I'm interested.  I have a great
deal of experience with IBM-PC computers and anything related, particularly
in troubleshooting problems.  I've also done programming in many languages
from high level down to assembly language.  I've taught lots of classes
related to programming, DOS, Windows and such... Need a class taught?  I've
got a lot of experience writing, particularly documentation, but I do other
writing, too.  My real love, though, seems to be in working with people.  I
am thinking of pursuing a career in counseling and have done a fair amount of
adventure based counseling (ropes courses) and would be interested in
anything along those lines, even more than computer work.  It's just that I
have a lot of computer experience, and it pays the bills for me, now-- well,
it isn't paying them RIGHT now... :)

So-- I digressed on my "resume".  Back to the pipe tour:  I'm planning to
travel the U.S., and hoping to line up some stops along the way.  I already
have in mind to stop in the pipe museum in Michigan (gotta dig through the
old digests to find just where that is!-- the museum, not Michigan), but
would like to have some more ports of call along the way.  I plan to start
from here (Washington state) and travel down through Arizona, then across the
south through Louisiana, Tennessee, Kentucky (seeing where tobacco comes from
would be real cool, too...If I knew where to go to see that!) then up to the
northeast and across the northern states-- but I'm carving nothing in stone.
 This is a trip to "see the country".  I want to see what other people in
this country live like, and hear in their own words what life is like for
them in their part of the country.

I don't want to feel that I "have to" be anywhere on a given day.  I would
like to meet however many of the 1,000+ readers might be along my path, and
share a smoke with one or more of them as often as possible.  If there are
any who might offer a barn floor for my sleeping bag, a shower to make me
fresh as a daisy again, a bowl of mush or burger to eat, or even a place to
park my gypsy wagon for the night, I would most graciously consider any offers
, including those that include some bartering of the skills I might offer
your situation.  If I take anyone up on the offers, I will certainly offer my
services to you again (including manual labor :) when I see you.  Hopefully
as I work my way across, I'll have references for you from other pipers :)
 Until then, I can provide some email references for you from other folks!

Each time I read the digest, I think the same thing, and this is a good
opportunity to pass it on.  I am always impressed at how open the letters
have been from people.  Reading the digest is almost like reading a letter
from home.  It's fun for me to read about all the things that people have to
say about their pipes.  I especially like reading about specific stories that
involve pipes.  Like the one where the fellow got the wonderful tour at the
pipe museum in Michigan and was taught by a real master how to pack his pipe,
or the man in Finland (my grandparents were from there!) who was out on that
incredible fishing trip and was stranded without tobacco and had to resort to
drug-store tobacco!  Or (horror of horrors, to paraphrase Steve), the one of
the man who lost his bulldog (wasn't it?) on the highway, left only to
imagine what unthinkable violation the truck behind him did to his cherished
pipe.

I hope to see many of you along my way, and hope to help you generate new
stories to post here!  I'm going to do my best to come up with a "portable"
way be on email and to keep you posted on my pipe travels, but may have to
rely on pipe digest subscribers to pass on regular status reports!  Please
write me if you're anywhere in the U.S. and would like to meet, even if it's
just to say "hi" and maybe share a smoke.

Your Traveling, Smoking Comrade

&gt;But, pray tell, what are "fine cigarettes"?

Cigarettes are what you buy from behind the counter at the
convenience store, and fine cigarettes are what you buy from
behind the counter at the tobacconist.

I've had a lot of luck with Nat Sherman's cigarettes of all
kinds, but there are many types out there. Tell your tobacconist
what you like in a cigar or pipe tobacco, and ask for a
recommendation. Be prepared to spend between three and six
dollars for a pack of smokes, though.

Some tobacconists (notably Poor Richard's here in Pittsburgh)
have a "cigarette of the day" so you can sample different kinds
without buying a whole box. I've also had them tell me to return
the box if it turns out I don't like it. I guess that's how they
pick the cigarette of the day.

From: ???????@????.??? (Nanosh J. Lucas)
<a name="14">Subject: Deep cleaning used pipes</a>

I saw your article in the Pipe Digest and I couldn't help dropping you a
line.  My name is Nanosh Lucas, and I know enough about cleaning pipes to
maybe give you a hand.  The first thing people will look for is bite-marks
&amp; tiny (or large) fills on the bowls - then they'll look for burn-ins.
Also if there's a lot of crusty pipe-stuff on the top of the bowl.  If they
have tobacco gunk inside they will definitely get you a lower price.

The first thing I do is ream out the bowl.  If you have some pipe cleaners
(preferably use the ones with the metal shaft and brush at the end, they
are much stronger - they are reminiscent of toilet bowl cleaners) then use
Bon Ami, or some other type of cleanser, (Bon Ami does just fine) and if
you can, dip the stem amored with Bon Ami into some Everclear and set to
work cleaning out the shank and stem.  I usually keep the faucet just
dripping for the ease of cleaning.  If the stem and shank, respectively,
are clean, the cleaner will come out the same color when you wash it as
when you just took it out of the pipe.  After this is done, dry out the
bowl and stem with a paper towel.  Be careful, certain pipe stems will
oxidize quickly if you leave them under the water for too long.

The next step is dependent upon whether the bowl still has a really nasty
odor.  I give it a salt-treatment in this case.  That is, twist a piece of
paper towel into the shank so that it effectively could stop the flow of
salt - then fill the bowl with regular table salt (if you're would prefer
kosher salt, I'm sure it would be fine).  Then set the pipe up so that the
bowl is level (this may be difficult with some FH's) and gently saturate
the salt with Everclear.  Leave the mixture in for about 24 hours, and when
you come back to it, you'll see the difference (or at least, smell &amp; smoke
the difference).

If the bowl is burned in on the top, you can sand it down so that it's flat
(this is a delicate area, so try to avoid doing this unless the pipe REALLY
needs it).  If the stem has many bite-marks, you can sand them down as
well.  Use maybe a 280 wet-dry sand paper and sand congruently with the
stem.  Make sure the sand-paper is wet.  After you finish with 280 - you
should get the bite-marks completely rid of before going on - use a 320, a
400, then a 500.  This will prevent the stem losing it's shine for later
on.  Sanding actually works fairly well for extremely oxidized stems.  The
upper-number sand papers are for getting the scratches to reasonable levels
before you buff:

Buffing:  The next step.  I have a two buffers set up, with four different
buffing compounds, and four different wheels.  For all practical purposes,
you can use Tripoli - a common buffing compound found all around, for the
second, you can use some type of fine, white buffing compound (sorry, I
don't have the name - you can always ask for something to polish lucite or
vulcanite with), which shouldn't be too hard to find, and lastly carnaubua
wax.  (I suppose you could hand buff these, but you would be about 80
before the pipe got clean - you would have arms like Paul Bunyan,
though--stay tuned for what to do if you don't have a buffer set-up).

For cleaning the bowl, I use the first wheel - a very hard wheel - and
apply Tripoli, just getting the top of the pipe if there is a lot of gunk
on top.  (Be VERY careful with meerschaums, you could easily eat away at
the shape of the bowl, as well as other pipes, with a little more
pressure).  Then I go to the fourth wheel - the soft one, and apply
carnauba wax.  This will give the bowl an excellent shine.

For the stem:  The second wheel (which is fairly hard) I have set up is for
the stem.  I use tripoli, and clean polish the stem until it has a mediocre
shine, and all of the oxidation has melted away.  The next wheel (3rd) is
for the 'fine white' compound.  This will make your stem start to sparkle.
The last is for the carnauba wax wheel, and you won't believe what a
difference it can make.  Your pipe will have gone up in value quite
significantly. WARNING: do be careful of two things, (a) don't buff the
mouthpiece to much - people get frantic about having a little nib to chew
on, and (b) be VERY careful of the nomenclature.  Certain pipes will have a
very easy buff-off rate with Tripoli, such as Charatans.  You won't have
any problem with Dunhills or most Comoy's.

If you have any metal on the pipe (many pipes have a sterling silver band)
you can use a silver polish which will make it look great.

This is only a quick bite into the cleaning process (meaning that I know a
little more than this, so if you have any more specific questions - I'll be
able to answer them).

If you find yourself lacking in any of this equipment, you can certainly
get someone at Sherlock's Haven to do it for cheap - usually $5 bucks,
sometimes $7 - for the worst of the worst.  You can either mail them - call
first, or come yourself to the address below:

Phone: 415-362-1405

We also buy many used pipes (at great prices), so if you don't want to go
through the hassle of either of these, give us a call.

Hope this was some help...

I almost forgot to mention another method for cleaning badly oxidized pipe
stems.  You can put the stems in a jar filled with REGULAR clorox bleach
for about two hours - no more.  Make sure you don't put any stems that
have metal on them, or any rubber (generally avoid cheap stems) stems,
such as "the pipe."  This is a tricky thing, and you'll have to buff them
afterward to get the shine back (they'll look pretty ugly).  Make sure you
clean them on the inside as well - they'll smoke pretty bad. 

Hope this was more help....

Hi Steve, et al - 

Had a quick question.  My life has gotten crazy enough and (with 
roomates) crowded enough that I really don't have the appropriate 
time/space to sit down with a pipe, but I missed it, so I compromised.  I 
still buy pipe tobacco (shag), but roll it into cigarette papers &amp; smoke 
it like a pipe (no inhaling). I find that the tobaccos I'm smoking are 
a little more moist than Drum (which is what I used to smoke), but if I 
roll the cigarette down fairly tight, I get a fairly clean and slow burn 
whch lasts about 10 minutes instead of 30 - 40.

So, I'm curious as to opinions about this.  I'm sure that I'm missing 
something fundamental about the tobacco (other than the peacefulness), 
but it still tastes pretty good.  

Thanks,

Jeremy S. Woodburn

Hi Steve,

I have been meaning to put in my two cents worth, but with opening a new
store, things sometimes get back burnered, as I am sure everone is aware.
 Well, a little about me.  My name is Roger Hawkins, and I own a store called
The Sundries Shop.  I just opened up in Feb (and just had the Grand opening
this past week).  I sell cigars, pipes (the few that I could find till now),
pipe tobacco, darts, game boards, etc.  I also have a section of the shop,
which my wife runs, where we sell candles and crafts. A little something for
everyone....well, enough of that shameless plug.  I am a 25 year old with an
extensive history in retail management (which is why I ventured into my own
store).  I am still hacking out my degreee slowly at a local private business
college, and getting ever so closer to that illustrious golden ring.  I
started smoking cigars about three years ago, celbrating the birth of my
daughter.  I started with Phillies and Garcia y Vegas (rather nasty now, but
it gave me an appreciation of what a truly good cigar can be), and now I have
access to the best available (with the exception of the Cubans) and I take
advantage when I can to expand my horizons.  I just for the first time two wee
ks ago picked up a pipe and filled the bowl with a golden vanilla blend of
tobacco and lit up. (it was an inexpensive corncob meerchaum, but at this
point I couln't tell the difference, honestly).  I found the pipe quite enjoya
ble and can forsee several more bowlfuls in the upcoming years.  I can't wait
to try a Dunhill, Troost, or MacBaren blend (or any other that may be
recommended) in a good pipe.  My only problem is that my wife does not allow
me to smoke in the house... :(  I am working on that one, and I think it will
change once I get a den put in.  I initially subscribed to PD here for the
possible information I could get to help me learn more about the industry I
am involved with, and I find reading all of the postings more than enjoyable
(and some rather disturbing....you know which one).  I can say that this is
some computer time well spent, and I print up every issue and put it in a
binder that I take to work with me to use as reference and for my customers
to browse through.  A definate positive reaction.  Anyway, Thank you Steve,
and all of you.  Smoke in peace.

Roger Hawkins, Bangor Maine

Hi Again,

I read in our local rag ( The Bangor Daily News, Monday April 10th edition) a
story on the AP wire about a Tobaccanist in Portsmouth NH being driven out of
the location they held for 74 years by the landlords to put in a Bagelworks
shop.  There was a petition drive and a protest about the forced move, and
the landlord's response was that there were several vacancies down the
street, and that Federal Cigar would remain in operation, just in a different
location....That is very distressing to me, and I am sure to the rest of you
as well.

Just remember, if you have a local or favorite tobaccanist, please take care
of them!

Roger Hawkins

[ Great news, Roger! For those tobacconists confronted with similar
boneheads, consider organizing a resistance. -S. ]

<a name="19">Subject: Introduction</a>

     After 4 or 5 digests, I figure it's time to introduce myself.
     My name is Dave Goldstein.  I'm 23 years old, a graduate of Northwestern
University with a B.S. in Radio/TV/Film, and currently working as a
Production Assistant for Premiere Radio Networks.  I also perform in an
improv comedy troupe called "On The Spot," performing in various places all
over Southern California.  That's the un-tobacco-related stuff; now for the
good stuff:
     My first smoking experiences came when I was a child.  My father, a pipe
and cigar smoker, would often sneak me puffs when Ma wasn't looking.  While
it didn't seem like much at the time, I realize now how cool my dad was
being, and I'll never forget those times.
     I didn't smoke again 'til college.  The cigars of choice: Swisher Sweets
and Dutch Masters.  Quick snickering; they were cheap, and I didn't know any
better.
     After I started working for Premiere, I became good friends with two of
our staff writers, the comedy team of Pete and James.  In a short period of
time, they went from complete ignorance to cigar aficionados.  I started
thinking about my experiences with my dad when I was little, and decided to
join the guys in the pleasures of "good" cigars.  (It should be noted now
that I have yet to become serious about pipes; please don't take offense, but
I usually just scan the letters that deal solely with pipes.  It's not a
personal thing, nor a reflection on your writing capabilities, but more a
lack of interest in pipes, for the moment).
     Soon I was joining Pete and James on their daily excursions to the Cigar
Warehouse on Ventura Blvd. in Sherman Oaks.  This is where the hordes of
San-Fernando-Valley-based celebrities come to get their cigars.  The walk-in
humidor is bigger than my living room; the front of the store is a
smoke-filled gathering place for the regulars to compare smokes and tell bad
jokes.  Without a doubt, I am the youngest regular at the store, which is
good and bad; the novelty of being a twentysomething among mostly middle-aged
gentlemen has its moments, but it's also discouraging not to have "children
my own age to smoke with."
     My brand of choice is one of the most inexpensive in the whole store:
Kiskeya.  I prefer the milder smokes, and this one just tastes the best.
 When I've got the cash burning a hole in my pocket, I'll treat myself to a
PG or an Avo, but those times are rare.  Kiskeya, Romeo Y Julieta, and Las
Cabrellas are excellent, inexpensive cigars.
     As I am a fairly new [consistent] cigar smoker, I am just now being
exposed to the double standards between cigarette and cigar smokers.  A bar
may be packed with cigarette smokers, but God forbid I light up a stogie;
I've been asked numerous times to vacate the premises (granted I was naked
most of those times, but I'm sure it was the cigar!).  Do any of the other
Southern California readers know of places where a guy can get a beer and
light one up without fear of reproach?
     Well, that's my story.  As I'm sure you're well on your way to a more
stimulating letter by now, let me leave you with these words of wisdom:
"Smoking is a lot like life; you light one up and, um...puff ...and,
uh...blow out smoke...and...ummm...when you're done...you, uh...do..something
else...I guess."  Thank you.

I have a pipe which was given to me as a gift by a special friend. The pipe
is an Amorelli with one star under the name. The mouthpiece has a briar inlay
and the style is called a busbee  a fuoco. Does anyone know anything about
ths make? I think it cost her around $250-$300. I'm not sure, but this is my
guess. I haven't smoked it yet, so I can't report on how she works, but I'm
sure I will by the next publication. 

I am also interested in knowing about any good magazines or books on pipe
smoking. The cigar people have their new magazine, do we pipe people have
anything to rate the pipes of the world? How should I know if a certain
Dunhill is really worth the $300 price? Someone must rate them somwhere. 

I used to know of a club out of Virginia that sold quality pipes at a
discount over prices in fancy stores. They also had a newsletter. I have
since lost touch with this club. I would also appreciate it if someone knew
something about them. I think they were in Northern VA.   Thanks for the help
and keep smoking.

wondering, Do you know of location that favors Large Freehands, or Large
Pipes in general.  I am a well built man standing at only 5-10 and fell most
comfortable with a Large pipe.  I have a few Bari's---they tend to be large
as you know......But I find it difficult to located Pipes of Large
Size....PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!!  And again, Thanks for the great Digest.....

To Steve and the PD:

While touring a manufacturing facility in Finland last month, I was
suprised to find several smoking rooms scattered about the area.
There is a lot of cigarette smoking in Europe, and Finland is no
exception.  Also, this facility is rather close to the Arctic Circle,
so going outside in winter is not a good option.

Each chamber measured about eight feet square, about 12 feet high,
and had walls of very heavy plastic panels overlapping each other.
The overall shape was a tent, with the center of the tent, at the
very top, having an exhast vent that took 100% of the smoke out.  I
bet if you released a cigarette around your head, it would get sucked
out the vent.  The ashes seemed to pose no problem, either.

There were no chairs.  It was meant for getting your smoke and keeping
it [the smoke] out of the factory.  And it worked like a charm.  With
the awful stuff they smoked, it better work well!  But it demonstrates
where compromise can be found that really works.

Dear Steve,
  I just stumbled on a very tasty blend that English tobacco smokers might
enjoy.  My good friend Dr. Ray Bromley gave me a pound of Carey's Traditional
Virginia which in itself is very flavorful.  My only complaint was that it
seemed to burn a little fast and sometimes got a little hot.  So I took 1/2
pound of the Carey's and mixed it with 1/2 oz. of Perique and 2 oz. of latakia 
and it turned out exceptionally well.  It might need a tad bit more latakia
for my taste, but that was all I had at the time.   And I'm sure it will get
even better as the flavors marry in the tobacco jar.  Dr. Ray presses his
homemade blends, and I'm compelled to build a press of some type since my
first experiment was so successful.

Seriously: Astleys is a must if you happen to be in London. Their
pipes come in roughly 30 different shapes, all classical English

start at \pounds 65.00 for a machine made Astleys, and at \pounds
125.00 for hand made pipes. In my opinion excellent value for money.

I am a recent subscriber to your excellent publication.  I have been smoking
cigars for about a year.  I average about 4 per week.  I have been wondering
about the potential health consequences of this very enjoyable activity.  But
since I hold two jobs and am working on a graduate degree, I have had no time
to do any research.  I would appreciate receiving information on this
subject.  Specifically, I wonder if (as I have heard) putting a rubber tip on
the end of one's cigar really cuts down on the risk of mouth cancer.

Hello, Steve,
  Well, I sure hope you find a new spot for your Web Page.  I almost feel
lost without it.  After signing up for a subscription a few weeks back, I'd
go to the Page and download a back issue to read on the train ride home.
Now I can't do that.  So I'm wondering, if you have the time and
inclination, could you send me a few back issues?  Say, #160-170?  I would
appreciate it indeed.

  So much tobacco, so little time!  Reading in the PD about all the great
tobaccos to be tried leaves me salivating sometimes, but it seems I'm
buying it faster than I can smoke it.  I must have 7 or 8 tobaccos that
I've purchased recently waiting for me unopened, but I resist to open them
too soon.  I decided to go through each tin or pouch one at a time,
savoring its qualities down to the last crumb before trying another.  Right
now I'm working my way through the basic Dunhill blends with some Mac
Baren, Rattray, and local tobacconist blends waiting in line.  Sometimes I
wish I was more knowledgeable about what I was smoking so that I could
compare one blend and its ingredients to another to help me in my
purchasing decisions.  But fortunately, the submissions to PD by those who
are more knowledgeable are helping me gain an education.

  At the end of a long hard week, I like to remember the words of the old
French cavalier found wounded on the field of battle, "They slashed me many
times with their sabers, but I never lost my pipe."  (from Carl Ehwa's
book).

HI yet again Steve,

Well,  I have read through three issues of PD (I finally sat down and did
it).  Very interesting reading, and most educational for someone just getting
involved in the pipe industry.  I think as we all go along here I may post a
bit more frequently than others for a while as I learn the ins and outs of
what I am doing.  I will try to keep it light.  But I do have a few
comments/Queries for all though....

1)  How do I get ahold of an importer/wholesaler for Peterson or
Sesseini(sp?) pipes here in the US.  I have customers willing to put the
money down, if I can find them.  As well as these two, If you all would have
some recommendations of a good line(or two) to carry in the lower to
mid-priced range I would be more than grateful (and please no Dr. Grabow.)

2)  ON the lines of pipes...how do I find seconds and estate pipes that my
customers may be interested in (as well as myself! of course)

3)  Recently there was an inquiry to the availabilty of La Gloria Cubana
cigars (I apologize for not having you name handy).  Well, I contacted the
factory in Miami and the official response is that they are not shipping to
ANY stores or distributors in any significant quantity (three bundles or
more).  However..they are willing to ship one or two bundles or boxes at a
time, but depending on the size and wrapper there is a back order of 2 weeks
to 8 months (yes, months).  The reason for this is the poor crops of the last
couple of years creating a shortage on high quality wrapper leaves (as
mentioned in Cigar Affictianado's spring issue).  That coupled with a good
review pretty much set demand WAY above production.  If you would like the
number for LGC, Email me and I will pass it along.

Sorry for the length, Steve, but sometimes I get long winded.  Feel free to
edit as needed.  Also..I did not recieve issue 185 or 186, and would
appreciate the old send along treatment if it is not too much to ask.
 Thanks.

<a name="30">Subject: Posting for Pipe Digest</a>

[ Administrativa deleted. -S. ]

I just rescued a pipe from a local flea market.  It's a very attractive
full-bent briar, with a silver-metal ring at the shank.  Strangely, 
though, this pipe appears to be a Peterson "system" pipe, but it's not.

It has a "classic" peterson stem, which I've never seen anywhere else, 
not even on Peterson Irish Seconds.  The bowl has a distinctive "fat"
shank with the standard Peterson  "System" double drilling and under-
bowl resivoir.  In fit an finish it is every bit as finely crafted as
a Peterson system pipe.  In fact, I think it's better put together 
than the new Peterson I drooled over at a local tobacconist's lat
Saturday.

The name Wellington is stamped in script on the shank, and in block
capitals on the stem.  The following mark also is stamped on the
stem,metal ring, and shank:

                              __________
                              \ W   D  /
                               \  C  /
                                 \ /             
                   
(the mark is much more finely crafted, obviously!)

In addition, there are 3 "crests" pressed into the metal ring  above
the triangle: an anchor, a star, and something else which I can't make
out clearly.

I've seen some new pipes recently that appear to be knock-offs of the
Peterson design, but frankly you'd have to be blind to mistake them 
for anything other than an inferior copy.  This isn't in that category.
Looking at it, it proclaims itself as a Peterson in every way.

If anyone can provide some info on the origin of this interesting speciman,
I'd be grateful.

                                Thanks

list. Let me introduce myself. I am Rafael Colorina. I have been a cigarette
smoker for over twelve years, and just recently switched to cigars.
        I  would love to receive mail from fellow subscribers about good
cigar products.
        By the way, I have something very excitingto tell you.....
This message might make some of the members of this group mad at me for
wasting their time, but I am sure all will be excited about my amazing
discovery.
        I always thought my yellow teeth were heriditary because they looked
as if they are painted wiyh yellow color. My wife just recently bought a
bottle of sugar free chewing gum called SMOKER"S FRIEND. I did not think much
of it but I tried the m anyway. I was shocked and could not believe how most
of my stingy stained teeth changed. My breath used to smell so bad that there
were times when I have some serious problems with my wife.! The company who
makes this product, also has dental microfibers that is supposed to remove
most dental stains. Also, they claimed that these products are 100% natural!
 Samples, anyone?  Call Lifelong USA at 708 470-9100 .

<a name="33">Subject: Re: Chrchills</a>

In my last post I told you about a place called Churchills in Long Beach. I
forgot to give you their address, but before I do I must update you on some
information I have acquired. It seems the owner was arrested at a tobacco
show last year for passing counterfiet (sp?) $100 dollar bills to the
dealers. Also I was told from an a.s.c. member that he also sold someones
Cohibas and pocketed a commision. The first bit of info has been confirmed by
at least three sources and one from the second. I felt it was important to
relate this info before posting the address as this has definitely changed my
feelings about the owner. I still did have a good time there, but, it will
now only be to mingle with other smokers and not to make it my regular stop.
This wouldn't be possible at the moment because I live in AZ.

                            Churchill's
                            5844 Naples Plaza
                            Naples Island, Ca 90803
                            310-433-3994

While I was there the owner also mentioned that someone in AZ was going to
open a Churchill's and felt he was stealing there idea. I finally found it,
you may have seen some of the posts on a.s.c. about it, in Phoenix. I've
dealt with the manager ( Bob Williams ) for a couple of years now when he
worked at Ford &amp; Haig as there manager. This place is upscale! A beautiful
200 sq ft humidor seperates the store from the lounge. There is a memebership
fee for access to the clubroom. They asked me not to list the prices as they
may not be concrete. Anyway, inside the clubroom is a large screen TV, pool
table, highback leather chairs, and a place to stash your beverages. In the
store there are 3 large round tables with product ranging from books to
t-shirts and hats. I finally got to see the inside of an Elie Blue
humidor....... sorry thats my drool. They carry an exclusive Romeo y Juliteta
cigar from Honduras. Haven't tried it yet. They said the only other place you
can get it is at the smoking room in Beverly Hills called Nazareth. Bob's
father has a locker there. I guess when your father is Milton Berle many
things are possible. I definitely will be frequenting this place a lot.
Unfortunately not as a member. 

                        Churchill's Fine Cigars
                        5021 North 44th Street
                        Phoenix, Az 85018
                        602.840.9080

I know I've been rambling but I have to tell you one more story. You see It's
about my first smoke with my son. It's amazing the bond cigar smokers share.
You see my son is only three years old and wakes up every morning doing a 100
miles an hour and only stops for juice and to watch a movie.
 The other night while on the patio smoking my Don Tomas Corona out comes my
son. At first, I thought, he wanted to terrorize the neighbors with his
police car. Instead he looked at me and said " I got my sdar ( spelling for
pronunciation ) daddy!". He then sat down and proceeded to talk to me about
everything he could think of all while puffing away on our stogies. Yes his
was an imaginary cigar. I think I'll wait till he's five before the real
intro :). Amazing thing those cigars are when you can get your two year old
to sit still for twenty minutes or more.

That's All Folks!

Congrat Steve on passing 1000.  (__{@}_________|||

<a name="35">Subject: Peterson Markings (Digest #187 Letter)</a>

Mark, as it happens, Mr. Tony Dempsey is a dues-paying member of the Ohio
Pipe Collectors (yes, we are an international pipe club) and a strong
supporter.  Your letter in the Digest jarred my memory, and I went
searching back through our correspondence.  As I suspected, Tony wrote us
on May 26, 1994, to the effect that: "Generally speaking, earlier
generations in our Company were very negligent as far as our history was
concerned, and did little or nothing that would make it easier for us to
answer the many requests we receive for history and information about Kapp
&amp; Peterson.  By coincidence, we just recently commissioned someone to
write a history of our Company which we hope will be interesting and
useful....Unfortunately, this is a time-consuming exercise which may take
6-12 months to complete.?
        Tony wrote again on Dec. 9, 1994, when he rejoined OPC for 1995. 
He again mentioned the company history--"It should be available in book
form within the next 12 months."  It appears they--or the writer
hired--are having some trouble.  In any case, I will write Tony very soon
to ask about the history.  As soon as details are available, I'll send
them to the digest.

<a name="36">Subject:       BAD HABITS</a>

Hi Steve and all the others too,

As I read in previous editions of Pipes Digest the situation for 
smokers in the US are getting worse by the day. I sympathize strongly 
and consider myself lucky living in a country that is more 
permissive. At my last skiing holiday in Italy I had the opportunity 
to taste some of the sour fruits of the anti smoking movement. I 
booked into a hotel not being told that it was a NON SMOKING hotel. 
On my room was an ash-tray with a card laying in it saying "Non 
Smoking Room Thank You" (It's a bit of a contradiction is it: "Use 
this ash-tray while not smoking") It was a good ash-tray, it accepted 
all the ashes we put in it but every day the card was reinstalled and 
it just didn't feel right. Now if you don't allow smoking in the 
restaurant maybe I'd agree but you can't forbid people to smoke on 
their room without stating this in your brochure! (I'll never go 
to that hotel again!)

But now something different:

I'd like to bring on the matter of bad habits. We all have them and 
I'm interested in them. What (strange tings) do you use for tamping 
down the ashes in your bowl and what do you use to clean it with 
afterwards (socks, parts of your body, other peoples cloths?) What do 
you do with used matches when you can't throw them away immediately 
(do you end up with a matchbox with 50% used and 50% unused matches?) 
Do you sometimes _knock_ your briar pipe? Do you have any strange 
places you keep your tobacco (like I read in PD 184 Sherlock Holmes 
did). Do you smoke in elevators? Do you leave around used not yet 
cleaned pipes (spilling ashes) resulting in many an important 
document stained? Do you keep an impressing collection of half empty 
pouches of tobacco (you didn't like that much but would like to try 
later or kept for sentimental reasons) spilling in time most of their 
contents in drawers or boxes? Is your entire house littered with 
matchboxes just to have them handy. 
If you have any of such "bad" habits and would like to tell me about 
them: mail them to me and I'll post an anonymized selection of them 
back in PD.

Bye!

<a name="37">Subject: 1000th Member Acceptance and Thanks</a>

Steve,  first I want to apologize for this belated response to the news that
I am the 1,000th member in the Pipes Digest -- I will carry the baton well,
rest assured.  Secondly, I want to express my gratitude for your efforts in
maintaining an excellent place for all Pipe smokers from around the world to
enjoy virtual friendships and discussions on the subject of pipes and
tobaccos.  It seems strange that two disparate arenas such as technology and
tobacco can combine so well, IMHO. 

About myself,  I live in Atlanta and work for a Fortune 40 company as the
manager of a client server software development group.  I've traipsed around
the Southeast over the past 15 years from Atlanta to Tampa to Orlando where
I worked for the immortal mouse but found that I couldn't take the heat and
humidity anymore so returned to the fair city of Atlanta.  Unfortunately,
the past year was upsetting as I experienced divorce and the resulting
financial burden of an unsold house and other miscellaneous items -- alas a
good bowl has often been there to soothe me over these long months.   

My pipe collection is not extensive but improving as I just purchased a
nice slightly bent Peterson but, clumsily, managed to set myself on fire
with a christening bowl of St. Bruno.  I've since been babying it with
Dunhill's Early Morning Pipe and a rather light mellow blend from
McClelland's,  Mixture No. 8.   I mostly enjoy English blends that have a
dry crisp character and that burn well.  A bowl of  965, a glass of fine
Scotch, and the Pipes Digest have often been best friends with me over the
past few months.

Thanks again Steve for the Pipes Digest.

Events of the weekend (including the Trenton Computer Festival and the
removal of a gazillion ailanthus from the backyard) kept Your
Moderator too flagged to put out the Digest at the usual time, but
here it is, finally. Enjoy!

HEADS UP for Massachussetts residents: The state House has passed a
measure that bans nicotine from all tobacco products sold in that
state by the year 2002.  This is no April Fool's joke; it has been
independently confirmed, and it's the closest thing to an actual
attempt at Prohibition we've seen so far.  Please call your state
legislators, and put the word out to whoever you can to organize and
fight this thing.  The bill was sponsored by Rep. Douglas Stoddart.
Remember in November. See below.

:through the Legislature after the House added it without debate Thursday
:to the proposed state budget for next year. "It doesn't prohibit smoking,"

(from Marty Pulvers, Sherlock's Haven)

Dear Sir,

        If you know the shape name of your old charatan, and what grade it
was, let me know &amp; I'll do my best to find a similar pipe.  If you don't
know shape names, I'll try to dig up an old Charatan shape chart &amp; mail you
a Xerox copy.  As a point of info, my charatians in the Belvedere,
Perfection, Authentic grades are, if in excellent condition - $35.
        For now, let's impart a short list of some Upshalls &amp; Ashtons
(used) that we can put our hands on immediately.  If these don't work for
you, Nanosh can do a little looking each day through our considerable stash
of used/unconditioned pipes for one you will love (and then you'll be
hooked and woe betide your checkbook).

#637 Ashton - xxx - Pebble Grain - Multi-faceted (octagonal) bowl that is a
cross between a billiard &amp; Cognac (or brandy) shape.  Lazy, Canadian
diamond shank &amp; typically short (black) stem.  Gorgeous pipe.  The walls
are thin, but that's only a problem if you smoke hot or the wood is poorly
cured.  Contrary to myth, thick walled pipes to not smoke cooler.  Med.
large sized bowl - $115.

#697 Ashton - xx - Pebble Grain - in long swan-like 1/2 bend.  Brindle
colored stem is very long and while the pipe is certainly ok, the balance
of proportions don't work all that well, in my opinion.  Again, both
condition and price are excellent - $80.

#621 Upshall FH (freehand) in dark carved finish.  They didn't make many of
these - and although it is an Upshall, not a Tilshead, it was their less
expensive (less than $200) model.  This one is a very nice 1/2 bent with,
for me, a very comfortable, narrow, thin stem.  Has a diamond shank of and
capacious bowl.  One side of shank is smooth in order to accomodate
nomenclature - $65.

#608 Upshall - probably their lowest grade smooth c. red stain finish &amp;
large, almost king size bowl - barely smoked - maybe 30 seconds.  But used
is used.  For some reason Upshall decided to make this a silver spigot,
adding tons to it's original asking price, especially in Europe wehre they
treat silver like gold.  Grain is poor (hence dark red stain) &amp; general
design would have to be called ugly.  Yet - a silver spigot Upshall for
only $100...

#661 Upshall FH - Carved Pot with large bowl &amp; saddle stem.  Nice
comfortable pipe - $65.

#580 Upshall - P grade - large smooth Dublin with lots of good straight
grain.  Clearly a good-old Upshall from their hey day - $90.

#594 Upshall - P - 1/4 bent Bulldog - Also quite large - but grain not as
tight as above pipe.  Doesn't deserve "P" rating - $80.

        All pipes are in excellent condition.  Make any checks payable to
"Pulver's Prior Briar" -- If anyone would like to be on the mailing list

Steve:

Thanks for adding me to your list.  I suppose I have been lurking long 
enough...  Anyhew, here are a few words about me:

I am a 32 yr. old scientist with the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture working in 
southwestern West Virginia.  I have been smoking pipes (off and on) for 
about fifteen years.  My collection of seven pipes includes two Petersons 
and a (brand new) Sasieni.

My chief reason for joining the mailing list was to get info regarding 
what to smoke in my pipes.  I used to be in Carey's tobacco club, wherein 
I received regular shipments of a blend called "Imperial English".  
Carey's discontinued this blend (even though it is still in their 
catalog!), and I quit their club.  Since then, I have tried many similar 
blends, but have yet to find one to suit me.

Steve, your digest has filled my needs and more.  I have tried several 
new blends and just received a shipment of samples from Craig Tarler of 
Cornell &amp; Diehl.  Mail-order seems to be the best way I have found to get 
tobacco.  I live in Huntington, WV and the lone tobacconist in town is 
not acceptable (I don't mean to sound derogatory, but they don't carry 
the "finer" brands of pipes or tobaccos, e.g. Dunhill, Peterson, 
MacBaren, etc).  Still, I am able to visit North Carolina and stop by 
JR's and Pipes Etc. (in Winston-Salem).

Well, I will leave you with a quick piece of news:  My work truck (a 1995 
Ford Bronco) is supplied to my agency by the General Services 
Administration (GSA) of the federal government.  According to a 
regulation imposed last summer, I am not allowed to use _any_ tobacco 
products in that truck.  Last week, despite my statements that I do not 
smoke in that truck, the man from GSA chewed me out because he saw a 
pouch of MacBaren's #1 in the truck. (ARRG!)

Thanks again,
Eric Thompson

I wouldn't call it an English at all, at least how I understand the term.  
According to the inner label, it's a blend of Virginia and perique.  It 
certainly doesn't taste like any latakia is present.

To tangent off a bit, how would people here describe an "English" tobacco?  
To my mind English implies Latakia and no casing.  I'd describe tobaccos 
such as Escudo and MacBaren Dark Twist as something else entirely--Virginia 
leaps to mind as a possible term.  I've also heard "Scottish" used to 
describe tobacco with perique and no latakia or casing, but I have no idea 
how correct or accepted that usage is.

<a name="10">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #186 -- April 15, 1995</a>

Hi Steve.

First, let me say how much I enjoy the Digest, and thank you for doing a
fine job.

Second, about the general matters arising from this "Kevin" business... you
know, it worries me that the USA seems to be falling into what you might
call a Salem mind-set.  For example, there is a belief in a clear path of
righteousness leading to salvation (smoking being an outward sign of inward
disgrace, for example) and a profound suspicion of human relationships
(e.g., this terrible obsession with child abuse).

I know it's dangerous to criticise other people's societies, but, frankly,
I would feel deeply alarmed to be living in the USA at the moment.
Worrying about passive smoking or a man letting a couple of kids having a
pull on his pipe, when the country is in many ways in a worse state than
poor old Britain, seems to me like a man with a florid melanoma fretting
about a hangnail.  Perhaps it is a sort of dislocation: the real problems
are too great to contemplate, so people focus on trivia.

Maybe I have said this before here.  But, reading the Digest and a.s.m.
regularly, I keep coming away with this feeling that a nation which was
once an exemplar of individual freedom is becoming profoundly repressive,
and its citizens are allowing themselves to be coerced into submission.
Maybe it's as Yeats wrote:

        The best lack all conviction, while the worst
        Are full of passionate intensity...

Not forgetting (and relevant to the "Kevin" question) that the line
immediately preceeding those two read:

        The ceremony of innocence is drowned

When I was 12 years old, my Grandfather (RIP) introduced me to the
pleasures of the pipe: a ceremony of innocence, if you like, which I will
treasure forever. People _do_ act from simple motives; men _can_ love
children without any desire to abuse them; death is _not_ a punishment for
living badly.  And the desire to be fair and "non-judgmental" can lead in
itself to horrible abuses.  We have evolved, or been given by God --
whichever you prefer to believe -- the power of judgment, and to abjure
that power for fear of giving offence (or, more often, simply to avoid the
cacophony of axes being ground) seems to me lamentable.

I don't know whether this is the right forum to ventilate my concern. No. I
_do_ know. _Any_ forum is the right one; because, in the name of some
ill-digested salvation, we are being invited into a benighted age of
purse-lipped intolerance and condemnation in which the old benison "Smoke
in peace" seems more and more to require an introductory "Do you remember
when we could...?"  The anti-smoking movement is just a symptom of a far
more serious disease, which attempts to proscribe AND prescribe how adult
human beings may live.

Finally, a question of priorities.  Passive smoking is nominated as evil of
the moment.  How do its mortality and morbidity tolls compare with the
robbed, the beaten, the raped, the murdered, the abused, the mugged, the
maimed, the disenfranchised and the dispossessed who are victims of passive
drug-abuse?

But I suppose we baccy-heads are more amenable to the rule of law.  And
Philip Morris has an address where writs may be served.  Who do I sue when
a crack addict decides that I'm the one to get stabbed tonight?

Good for the politicians, eh?  It's like watching a man standing on the
stoop wrangling with the Jehovah's Witnesses, while the Manson gang has got
in through the kitchen window and is murdering the family.

Smoke in peace... insofar as you are allowed to.

<a name="11">Subject: A few more tobacco musings</a>

Hello all!  Just put down my pipe full of French Vanilla after a rather long
enjoyable smoke to read my PD from this past week.  
I still cannot find a better blend than Champagne.  I think that every
tobacco shop in Indy now has it.  ;-)  My friend at the Lafayette Tobacco
Shop in the Lafayette Square mall always has ample supply for me.

I have tried many blends since I last posted.  (I have also since gotten
married....I guess life can start again at 30...or however you wish to look
at it).  

My other favorite (the above you already know) is (believe it or not) Navy
Flake.  I don't mind Bengal Slices once in a while however.  All other
tobaccos I have samples are usually too sweet and loaded with casings (which
lead to the all too well known pipe gurgles) or they are very bitter, harsh,
and have an aftertaste of charred wood.  Everyone's tastes differ.  But, for
me, I tend to love the mild sweet tobaccos in small bowlfuls (to stay clear
of the casing problem).

Next weekend will be filled with wonderous times and pipefuls as it will be
the start of a new reenacting season.  The cannons will be rolled out, my
corporal stripes have been sewn on, and I am ready to fall in line with my
fellow (although only for a weekend) Virginians of the 1st Rockbridge
Artillery.  Rest assured a pleasantly fed (but beginning to show signs of a
long campaign without much food), moustached corporal will have plenty of
pipefuls for everyone in camp.  ;-)

Now, if anyone out there has seen a dated (19th century or earlier) pipe,
please email me.  By a dated pipe I mean a complete pipe in smoking
condition with a small bowl (about half the size of modern pipes) with a
bowl slightly tilted foward.  One way to date pipes before 1900 was the tilt
of the bowl.  The farther FORWARD a bowl tilts, the older the style of pipe.
I would love to have a smoking antique in my collection.

That is all for now.  Duty calls.  I must destroy a newly made cake that has
invaded my kitchen!

Dear Steve,

I am a faithful reader [and occasional poster] to this list, and in fact my
last post concerned the production of Burley tobacco in my home state,
Kentucky.  I have commented in past posts how much I appreciate your efforts
in maintaining this list, and how much I have enjoyed [and continue to enjoy]
it.

I live in a state that derives considerable income from the production of
cigarettes, and am also a partner in a law firm that regularly represents
tobacco companies.  However, even I cannot ignore the vast evidence showing
the devastating effects of cigarette smoking on the world population.  Many
of these facts and statistics were reported in the Scientific American
article that precipitated your cancellation of your subscription to that
publication.

I am a moderate to light pipe and cigar [primarily cigar] smoker, and believe
that there is little or no adverse health effects from the moderate use of
tobacco in these forms.  However, we cannot bury our heads in the sand and
make believe that all forms of the use of tobacco are equally inocuous.  In
reading the last digest, at least two posters that I recall stated that their
use of pipes and/or cigars had reduced or eliminated their consumption of
cigarettes.  I think this is laudable.

And, despite its searing attack on the cigarette industry, the Scientific
American article does not condemn the moderate smoking of pipes and cigars.
 In fact, one of the opening paragraphs of the article states:

     "Although tobacco use was relatively common in [the nineteenth] century,
it did not produce the widespread illnesses it does today. Individuals of the
time consumed only small amounts, mostly in the form of pipe tobacco, cigars,
chewing tobacco or snuff. Cigarette smoking was rare." 

I find no fault with this statement, nor with the conclusions of the
remainder of the article.  

Yes, I enjoy my pipes and cigars. And, yes, I would like to smoke
occasionally in a public place, an act that has largely been denied me
because of our society's desire to curtail cigarette smoking.  But do I want
to pay [either through taxes or the increased cost of MY health insurance]
for the diseases caused by the overuse of cigarettes??? No.  

And, more importantly, do I want to encourage a practice [particularly in
third world countries] that will both become an expensive addiction to people
who can ill afford it, and ultimately cause the premature illnesses and
deaths of many of these people??? Again, no. 

I once heard a minister give a sermon on the difference between things that
are to be "used," as in used for a particular purpose, and things that are to
be "enjoyed."  He gave wine as an example of something to be enjoyed.
 Obviously, if wine is "used" as a drug, as a crutch to get someone through
the day, severe problems will occur.  I think tobacco is in the same
category.  If enjoyed, in moderation, it can be wonderful.  If "used," as
many people use cigarettes as a drug to get them through their days, the
result will be equally disastrous.

Steve, keep up the good work.  This is not a "flame," or a personal attack; I
just wanted to share my views.  And I hope you won't cancel your subscription
to Scientific American. Though, with it on America Online . . . . I find no
need to buy paper issues of it anymore!!!

Peace,

Bob

Sci. Am. article say should be done? Was there in it a hint of
tolerance? -S. ]

race. The air is clean and when we want to see the 'big city' we drive 45 
minutes east to El Paso, Texas. I have smoked pipes on and off for many 
years. I enjoy the relaxation and sweet smelling aromas of the tobacco. 
When I sit in my home office and look out at the surrounding mountains 
and landscape it does make for an enjoyable time. I am retired and fill 
my time with classes at the local community college, studying Computer 
Technology, especially the repair and upgrading of PC's. I have worked

Hi Steve,

I haven't written in awhile so figured I'd drop you a line.  I just managed
to get all 3 kids off to bed (my wife's a nurse &amp; is working nights right
now), and I'm sitting here with a glass of Bass ale and a freshly-lit bowl of
Dunhill #965 in my largest Peterson, with my Chesapeake Bay Retriever
Budweiser sleeping at my feet.  Also, I've got the day off tomorrow so I
don't have to worry about getting up early.  Life doesn't get much better
than this!

I really enjoy getting the Digest each week and have gotten to be e-mail
friends with several members.  In general, the people I've corresponded with
are some of the most civilized, friendly people I've ever met--true gentlemen
in every sense of the word.  I look forward to logging onto my computer each
day to check my mail.  One Digest member I heard from this week is named
Nanosh Lucas (he's posted a couple of things recently also).  If you're ever
in need of a good reconditioned pipe I'd seriously consider getting in touch
with him (at ???????@????.???).  I've got my heart set on a particular
Upshall of his right now, which I hope will still be available when I can
scrape together the $$.  His descriptions are very detailed, the prices sound
fair, and he seems very conscientious and helpful.

My favorite tobaccos are Dunhill #965 and Early Morning Pipe.  Although I
don't experiment with new tobaccos all that often (I tend to stay with what I
know I'll like), my curiousity is piqued by all the talk about different
blends.  Can anyone recommend something similar (tinned, preferably), with
perhaps even slightly more latakia than the above-listed varieties?

Well, enough rambling for now.  Keep the bowl lit and the Digest coming!

<a name="17">Subject: Fixing loose stems</a>

I hought I'd take a moment to share a recent experience on fixing loose
vulcanite stems.  Many folks have written in the past regarding the 
most common procedure:  run a pipe cleaner through the stem to keep 
the airhole open, heat the end of the tenon with a flame and press it
against a flat surface, then sand to fit.
   
Maybe I was under a mistaken impression, but I thought these folks were
advocating actually *melting* the tenon slightly.  I had a mental
picture of a finished tenon that would have a slight "bead" at the end
after this procedure.  While I like to think that my manual dexterity is
at least average, I was too nervous to try this procedure myself, even
though I had two pipes with dangerously loose stems.
   
Anyway, a small antique store provided me with a $2.00 Iwan Ries pipe
that was in good shape, except for a loose stem.  (It also gave me a
Tilshead for $6.00, but that's another story.)  Having learned many
other life lessons at far greater cost than just a couple of bucks, I
decided to give it a go.  Instead of going for a drastic expansion of
the stem and then sanding to final shape I decided to slowly expand the
tenon until it fit.  I found that by heating the mid-portion of the
tenon only slightly and pressing very firmly it is possible to cause the
tenon to expand imperceptibly (to the eye); there is no need for a pipe 
cleaner or other aid to keep the airhole open.  I allowed the stem to 
cool *completely* before attempting to insert it into the shank.  After 

three or four heatings the stem fit snugly and the repair is absolutely 
undetectable.  I have since repaired the original two loose-stemmed 
pipes, each as easily and invisibly as the first.  Again, I heated the 
tenon only slightly:  the tenon was hot to the touch, but I could touch 
it to my cheek without burning.  I worked *very* slowly and patiently.
Also, each of these pipes had a vulcanite stem--I don't know if a
similar procedure would work with lucite, but I doubt it.
   
A side note on how I *think* these stems became loose in the first place,
as I don't want others to share this rather uncomfortable experience:

I was in the habit of cleaning the interior of pipe shanks with a piece
of Kleenex or toilet paper, twisting one corner and then "winding" it
tightly into the mortise to remove gunk.  I now think that the tightly
wound paper must exert sufficient force (or be sufficiently abrasive) 
to widen the mortise, leaving the stem loose.  Since I *never* remove 
a stem until the pipe has completely cooled, and only then very 
carefully, I can think of no other cause.  In any event, nothing will 
enter the shank of my pipes in the future except pipe cleaners and shank 
brushes.

Steve,

I thought the readership might get a kick out of this (reprinted in Nature (vol
374) 30 March 1995):

Cecil Carus-Wilson writes:

"I have discovered a new method for cleaning tobacco pipes which have
become foul.  A shallow cork, through which a hole is bored large
enough to enable it to fit tightly on to the nozzle of a soda-water
syphon, is fitted onto the bowl.  The nozzle is inserted, the
mouth-piece directed into a vessel, about a wine-glassful of
soda-water forced through and the pipe is clean!  This is not a
scientific discovery, but it may be of use to those scientific men who
are smokers.  Rubber stoppers answer better than corks."

<a name="22">Subject: Best pipe under $50?</a>

This question confronted me several years ago after inheiriting and starting
to smoke some classic pipes from my father, followed by picking up some
modern freehand pipes at flea markets and antique stores. While I had bought
a couple of high quality pipes when  in Europe on business many years ago, I
wasn't smoking them regularly and didn't have adequate experience at
breaking-in then. 

In looking for a new pipe to buy and break-in I was disapointed. The
affordable ones were the flawed seconds or lower lines and didn't compare to
the quality of my pre-smoked pipes. Today the high quality pipes that I
desire are at over $200 each, so I still have not bought a new pipe at a shop
for the last 10 years. I have over 300 pipes in my collection and some are
unsmoked, received from trading with other collectors who bought them new. I
buy several pipes each month and I have very rarely paid more than $50 for
 the highest quality pre-smoked pipe.

I think the pre-smoked pipes are the best bargain by far! Of course it helps
if you have the skill to refurbish and santitize old pipes or buy from
someone who can. As a result of periodically thinning out my collection, I
have over 100 nice pipes available ($14 to $45) and have been occassionally
selling or trading them by E-mail with full satisfaction because they are
quality pipes, well cleaned  and sanitized and are offered at a small
increase over my original low purchase price with inspection/refund
privileges. This gives me spending money to pick up brands not already in the
collection. Let me know if you would be interested in pre-smoked pipes; I can
even put you on to the leading collectors if I don't have the brands or
styles you desire. In the meantime, thanks for your attention and I'll look
forward to hearing from you. Regards,.....Rex

<a name="23">Subject: Reminiscences</a>

  Thanks, Steve, for the back issues you sent me last week--good reading!
And thanks for responding to my request so quickly.

  Reading all the various pipe smoking stories and anecdotes brought back
to mind my earliest attempts to smoke a pipe.  They were, looking back on
it now, quite comical (or perhaps pathetic is the word I'm looking for).

  When I was in junior high school I acquired by devious means a drugstore
pipe of some kind and a package of Cherry blend tobacco.  Of course, I knew
absolutely nothing about pipe smoking.  In fact, about the only thing I
thought I knew about smoking at all, was my mistaken conviction that
cigarette filters kept all the bad stuff away from the smoker.  Well, my
new pipe didn't have a filter like that, just some kind of metal
thingamabob.  So, what I did was remove the metal thingey and stuffed the
better part of a cosmetic puff into the smoke hole of the shank, replaced
the stem and, voila!  A filtered pipe!  Of course, you had to have the
lungs of a Highland bagpiper to draw on the thing, so I soon became
frustrated in my attempts to put in the tobacco and actually light it.
After a few unsatisfactory bowlfuls, I believe I buried pipe and pouch out
in the back yard so my mother wouldn't find it (she did not like 13-year
old boys smoking in any form whatsoever.  She obviously hadn't read the
1964 Surgeon General's report indicating that pipe smokers lived longer
than non-smokers).

  Now we move forward to 1971 to age 20.  By this time I had smoked
cigarettes for several years, but I was once again visited by the urge to
take up pipe smoking.  The drugstore I visited to buy my pipe and tobacco
had, astonishing as it may seem today, a resident tobaconnist--one of the
owners who smoked and so had stocked a moderate selection of briars and
tobacco blends.  I, of course, was expecting to spend no more than about
$5.00 for pipe, tobacco, and all, but he was shocked at the idea of anyone
smoking a _drugstore_ pipe.  Instead he provided me with a pipe that cost,
as I recall, about $10 and a couple ounces of one of his blends.  What he
didn't provide were instructions on how to smoke the blessed thing.  I
cheerfully tripped along home, gravity filled the bowl, and set a match to
it.  Now, whereas during my first pipe smoking adventure, I had no draw
whatsoever, this time around I had too much.  I think I actually sucked in
the flame itself.  A few shards of tobacco began smoldering and I puffed
furiously to keep them lit--to no avail, of course.  So I struck another
match and tried again...and again...and again.  About the only thing I
actually smoked were the matches.  This went on for a couple of bitterly
frustrating weeks, before I once again gave up.

  Fortunately, as they say, the third time's the charm.  In 1977, the lady
who was to become my first wife did just about the only good thing for me
that I can remember--she took me to a local tobacconist to get me started
in pipe smoking, figuring that it would be better for me than cigarettes.
This time it caught!  For one thing, I was older and wiser now, and managed
to ask questions and I went to the local libraries where they had copies of
"The Pipe" by Georges Herment and "The Book of Pipes and Tobacco" by Carl
Ehwa.  A little research, a little practice, and I've been smoking pipes
ever since.

  Now I've regaled you all with stories from my long-lost youth, I've got a
question for the PD readership.  Years ago I acquired a useful gadget
called a pipe cap.  It was basically, a bit of rubber molded so that it
would fit snuggly over the top of standard-shaped pipe and it served to
keep ash and tobacco from spilling out when the pipe was placed away in a
pocket.  I don't remember where I got it and would dearly love to get
another.  Does anyone out there know where one can find a pipe cap?  If so,
please e-mail me at ????????@???.???.  I've made a substitute using a wind
cap with the holes blocked with a bit of cut-up note card, but it doesn't
always stay on, so it's not nearly so satisfactory.

  Well, that's all for now (and the whispers echo back over the Internet,
"Thank _God_!).

The Ashton Pipe Story 
by. R. C. Hamlin 
 
I wrote the original copy of the Ashton Story in November 1988, 
revised it in January 1990, and have added a few "1994 updates" to 
the end of this issue. I hope that you enjoy learning why Ashton 
pipes are considered by many as the best England has to offer pipe 
smokers. Please feel free to post question and/or comments to me on 
the board. Please feel free to copy/print this article for your 
personal usage, however I will reserve the copyright of The Ashton 
Story for any commercial purpose. 
 
************** 
 
The Ashton pipe is fairly well known in today's pipe smoking 
circles.  Ashton pipes, in fact, do sell very well in all of the 
markets that they are in and are always in short supply.  What 
perhaps is not so well known is that this is a very new brandname 
that has only been in existence since 1983.  In these first years of 
production the Ashton pipe has progressed from an idea, to 
production, to possibly the most sought after and best crafted 
English high grade on the market.  The brand is now distributed not 
only in the United States but in England, Italy and Germany with the 
United States and Germany being Ashton's best markets. 
 
How could a new brand, especially an English brand considering the 
recent fortune of some of the other English makers, make it to the 
top of its industry in such a short while?  Basically by creating a 
better "mousetrap" that delivers as it promises.  While the 
brandname may be new there is a wealth of experience behind the 
brand.  This experience along with a burning desire to make the 
finest pipes on today's market have created the richly deserved 
success of Ashton Pipes - one that will continue to evolve in the 
years to come.  This is the story of their creator - Mr. William 
John Ashton Taylor, their catalyst and marketer - Mr. R. David Field 
and perhaps their most important attribute, you their smoker. 
 
Alfred Dunhill and his innovative ideas concerning the production of 
briar pipes is perhaps the single most important event in modern 
pipe smoking history.  Perhaps if Alfred Dunhill had not gone into 
the Tobacconist profession in 1910 and into the production of pipes 
in 1913, someone else would have modernized the curing of briar.  
However, no other person or company had, at least until then, really 
thought about how to make a briar pipe taste good, nor had anyone 
outside of St. Claude (France) truly set out to actually produce 
high grade briar pipes.  Alfred Dunhill pioneered this idea and for 
many years continued to purchase his bowls from France.  Where 
Dunhill differed was that after he received these bowls he cured the 
wood so that they were no longer "just" French bowls, but cured 
bowls to which he added his brandname and his finishing. 
 
The Dunhill story is much longer and full of new principles as far 
as how to produce a quality briar smoking pipe, but this is not a 
story about Dunhill.  This story is about a modern day pioneer that 
was in fact introduced to the Dunhill manufacturing process and the 
idea behind it, as an employee of Alfred Dunhill, Ltd. of London for 
almost three decades.  The result is the Ashton pipe as we see it 
today, full of innovations, made to be the best handmade smoking 
pipe possible and continuing to mature toward something even better.  
 
There are many parallels that can be made between Alfred Dunhill and 
William John Ashton Taylor as their ideas and ambition are similar.  
While perhaps Alfred Dunhill was more of the merchant and Mr. Taylor 
is more of the craftsman, both are very important in the evolution 
of pipes and this article will point this out occasionally. 
 
William John Ashton Taylor was born in 1945 into a world of virtual 
chaos in Britain, one that had suffered the full force of World War 
II not only in damage to its economy and population, but from years 
of bombing raids to London and the surrounding area.  The post war 
era was not an easy one and this is exactly the time and environment 
in which William Taylor (Bill) was raised.  In 1959, at the age of 
14 and while still pursuing his education, Bill applied for and was 
granted an apprenticeship with Alfred Dunhill of London. 
 
England was still rebuilding from the war in Europe and I don't know 
how hard employment was to come by in that post war time, but a job 
at the Dunhill Pipe Factory offered employment and training in a 
skilled trade.  The first year of training (during his 
apprenticeship) was spent hand crafting cigarette holders.  The next 
17 years were spent making briar pipes, with the last 9 of this 17 
acting as the foreman or supervisor.  This "production" time was 
followed by 7 years of management responsibilities involving quality 
control of pipes and tobacco, product development duties while 
maintaining the title of "Quality Control Manager".   
 
Bill used his skill in pipemaking to give demonstrations in the Duke 
Street Dunhill store (plus most of the other Dunhill sales locations 
in London such as Harrods, etc.).  In 1984, after 25+ years learning 
and practicing his "skilled trade", William John Ashton Taylor left 
the security of Alfred Dunhill to pursue his life long dream of 
owning and operating his own company. 
 
The Ashton pipe was an exciting entry onto the United States market 
in 1983.  With Bill Taylor's experience in quality control, 
development of pipes and tobacco and in not only his learned pipe 
making skills, but the secrets that were taught to him by those that 
he apprenticed under, the Ashton pipe would have to succeed.  Things 
are never as simple as they seem and without the intervention, 
encouragement and financial backing of Mr. R. David Field, Bill 
Taylor would not have left Dunhill in 1984 and the Ashton pipe as we 
know it today would not exist. 
 
David Field was an American Dunhill collector and student of pipe 
making, pipe usage, tobacco and their history.  In the early 1980's 
David made several trips to England and Italy in search of knowledge 
and artisan pipemakers to share in their knowledge, as well as learn 
as much as possible about pipes and tobacco firsthand.  In England 
David spent considerable time searching out information on Dunhill 
pipes and spent time visiting the Dunhill Archives, along with 
several tours of the Dunhill pipe making operation. 
 
During one of David's London visits, he attended a pipemaking 
demonstration hosted by Bill Taylor and saw firsthand the precision 
and skill that this "Quality Control Manager" processed.  David 
purchased every Taylor Made pipe (as they were called) that he could 
get his hands on and became consumed with not only the product, but 
with its producer and his skill.  After David returned to 
Philadelphia and with a small assortment of freshly produced "Taylor 
Made" pipes, the idea of marketing this line in the United states 
grew to the point that David knew that he had to act on the idea.  
 
To import and market a complete new line of pipes, especially an 
English brand to compete with Dunhill and Charatan, was not an easy 
quest.  The quality of these Taylor Made pipes was special though 
and would succeed if properly introduced to the American smoker 
along with carefully planning of quality control and production.  Up 
until now David had purchased a few handmade pipes on his travels to 
Italy and England, these he sold to friends and collectors to help 
defray the cost of his trip(s).  The marketing of Taylor Made pipes 
was not just a few pieces to a few friends, but the idea just would 
not leave him alone. 
 
David decided to contact this craftsman that we had witnessed in 
London and while he knew his name to be William Taylor, he didn't 
have an address or phone number.  A letter was written to William 
Taylor, care of Dunhill of London and marked PERSONAL.  This was 
mailed and did get to Bill, but only after it was inadvertently read 
by Bill's supervisor at Dunhill.  The letter was brief and basically 
said "Mr. Taylor, I would like to sell the pipes you are making in 
America - Please contact me as soon as possible at (address &amp; phone 
number)."  David's letter almost got Bill Taylor fired from Dunhill 
and necessitated a personal conference between Bill and his 
administrator in which Bill had to explain his involvement with 
someone that he did not know and in a letter that he had not seen.  
During this conference Bill read the letter, noted the phone number 
on it assured his supervisor that he was not interested in the 
offer.  Later that same day Bill Taylor placed a call to 
Philadelphia; Ashton pipes were soon to become a reality.   
 
Bill Taylor had actually started, in 1980, a small "one man" repair 
business under the name of Briarwoods of London.  This repair 
business specialized in the repair of Antique Meerschaum pipes for 
the quality pipe stores of London and expanded into briar pipe 
repairs soon thereafter.  Bill's repair business was done more as a 
hobby than as a means of income, but being that there was already a 
business set up and in place, the creation of Ashton Pipes was made 
a little easier. 
 
In 1984 Bill Taylor left the security of Dunhill and set out to 
create the Ashton Pipe that would be introduced in the United States 
by David Field.  This was not an easy thing for Bill to do since he 
had a wife and two small children to support.  Bill's position at 
Dunhill not only held security, but there was already a career and 
certainly a future guaranteed.  Possibly the deciding factor for 
Bill was that David offered to advance a full year's pay as start up 
money.  With this assurance, Bill Taylor resigned his position at 
Alfred Dunhill and the Ashton pipe was born. 
 
The driving force behind the production of Ashton pipes was that 
Bill could take the knowledge that he had obtained during his 25+ 
years at Dunhill and improve the process to produce even a better 
smoking line of pipes.  David would take care of distribution in the 
United States and would take every pipe that Bill produced.  Each 
Ashton pipe was to be hand turned and not machine fraised as Dunhill 
pipes were and each would be oil cured with a new and improved 
process that went beyond that of Dunhill's system.  The early years 
of 1984 and 1985 were not without their problems and as most 
companies find out, turning ideas into reality is not as simple as 
it may seem. 
 
The first problem was to turn a small repair shop into a fully 
operational pipe making facility.  Equipment had to be purchased, a 
continual supply of high quality briar had to be found, stem 
material had to be stocked and if these start up problems were not 
enough, production had to get under way as soon as possible.  The 
balance of 1984 (after Bill had left Dunhill) saw very few Ashton 
pipes actually being produced and those that were tended to be on 
the smaller side.  In 1985 the new Ashton "factory" became fully 
functional and saw Bill's ideas of making the finest English briar 
pipe on today's market become a reality.  This too, created 
unforseen problems for this new operation.  The curing process had 
to be perfected which required experimentation with the blend of 
oils used to "oil cure", the time frame for processing the briar and 
with the temperature in which the briar would cure properly, but not 
harm the wood. 
 
All of these experiments took place during the actual production of 
Ashton pipe manufacturer and of all of the pieces that have been 
returned as poor smokers, most are from the 1985 era.  The final 
"perfect" time frame for curing - ended up as 14 days on the heat 
plugs.  Before I go on with this history I want to take a few lines 
to explain - the oil curing method and why the Ashton pipe, by using 
this method, is unique. 
 
The Ashton pipe is Oil Cured using Alfred Dunhill's original concept 
of forcing oil through the briar with heat.  This process cleans the 
wood of sap residue and makes the break in process easier.  The 
Ashton oil cure takes this concept a step further and uses a "blend" 
of three different oils, all with various properties.  The pipes are 
soaked in a oil bath until the wood has absorbed as much as possible 
(of the oil blend).  The briar is then placed on copper Heat Plugs 
for 14 days with the temperature raised and lowered thus forcing the 
oil through the wood.  The end result is a clean piece of briar with 
all of the extra sap, and its bitterness, removed.  In its place 
there is a slight internal coating of the oils which "flavor" the 
briar with a nutty or wood taste. 
 
The problems with using this timely and expensive process is that 
many of the bowls crack and those that do stand up to the treatment 
typically have sand marks pushed to the surface with the flow of the 
oil under heat.  As a result there are very few smooth Ashton pipes 
produced with straight grains being extremely rare in smooth.  If 
the curing process goes on too long or at too high a temperature, 
the fibers of the wood break down and "over cook" which causes a 
burned tasted along with a very high percentage of cracked bowls.   
An equal but opposite problem is created by curing at too low a 
temperature or for too short a period of time.  In this case the 
wood is left heavy with oils which causes a wet smoke without the 
nutty flavor, plus the bowls tend to run heavy for their size.  Much 
of early 1985 was spent perfecting this process which is now as 
efficient as possible, although the problem of producing a higher 
percentage of smooth Ashton cured bowls has not been resolved. 
 
In 1986 the Ashton "pipeworks" was up and running at full steam with 
hungry American smokers lusting for additional supplies of this new 
brand.  During this period, close to 100% of Bill's pipes were still 
coming to the United States (1 shop in London had a few Ashton 
pipes).  The reputation of the line was growing and additional 
markets were looked into including Italy and Germany.  These would 
start to see a few pieces in late 1985 (early 1986) and would 
continue to grow in demand through present day, although the United 
States still enjoys the greater part of Bill Taylor's production. 
 
Currently over 40% of the Ashton pipes produced in 1988 will go to 
the United States, 30% to Germany, 20% are sold in the U.K. and 10% 
are offered to Italy.  All of these markets have developed within 
the last several years and all have the same complaint -"Send more 
pipes".   
 
1986 could be probably be marked as the year that Bill turned the 
corner and became a major player in modern English pipe production.  
A new (and expensive) sandblasting machine was purchased and Ashton 
Pipes sponsored the first Ashton Pipe festival in London for the 
American pipe dealers attending the Dunhill PPD event in London.   
There has always been a shortage of these high quality pipes and in 
1986, on the night before the Ashton show in London, the whole 
"crew" worked into the early morning hours finishing pieces to 
display for dealers the next morning.  A large display of several 
hundred pieces were offered the festival attenders, many were unique 
designs created for the show. 
 
During 1985 when Bill was experimenting with curing and getting his 
new business off the ground, he took time to experiment with a new 
process of finishing briar.  This process was reserved for special 
blocks of briar that held such tight and dense grain that they would 
produce heavy pipes.  It was the density of these blocks that caused 
the problem of weight though and not the age.  Once these special 
blocks of briar had been cured they were still too heavy to please 
most users.  With "standard" grade briar this extra weight could be 
blasted away with slightly increased blasting pressure.  With extra 
dense briar, if the pressure of the sandblaster was turned up to 
blast away extra wood, the dense grain was blasted away also.  The 
wood had to be saved as it was some of the very best as far as its 
smoking attributes and so Mr. William John Ashton Taylor set out to 
correct this problem and in the process once again followed the foot 
steps of Alfred Dunhill in his innovative thinking.   
 
Bill's solution was special, so much so that he filed for an English 
Patent for his new process on June 21, 1985 and this patent was 
approved and granted July 6, 1988.  This new process of finishing a 
smoking pipe bowl was the first "pipe manufacturing" inventions 
granted an English patent in over 20 years.  As with most patented 
ideas, Bill's process while functional, is not that difficult. 
 
Basically the bowls are cured like any other Ashton pipe bowl by 
soaking them in oil, cured with heat over time and then subjecting 
the outer surface to a high pressure jet of steam that raises and 
swells the softer grain on the bowl.  This softer grain is 
"rusticated" or carved away (but not the hard dense grain) before 
the pipe is sandblasted.  Between the carving and sandblasting these 
"Pebble Shell" pipes lose 20 to 25% of their weight and yet they 
keep 100% of their beneficial grain.   
 
There were less than 24 "Shells" produced in 1985 and 1986; these 
were marked Pat. Pend.  1987 saw few if any Ashton Shells.  In early 
1988 there were less than 10 produced that not only included the 
newly issued patent number but an extra single digit (1,2,3 etc.) 
that denoted that these were the very first "patented" Ashton Pebble 
Shell pipes produced.  Number 3 from this first group is in my 
personal collection of pipes. 
 
At this point you may start to understand why I consider Bill Taylor 
to be someone very special as far as a pipemaker and his products.  
Bill's current "factory" has just relocated to a new unit (as he 
calls it), which is still only 1200 SF in size.  This new unit will 
allow the Ashton pipe to be made in a more uniform way with every 
bit of the operation carried out in pre-assigned areas.  Currently 
Ashton produces his pipes in 3 basic finishes, although several 
variations of these are in the works. 
 
The Pebble Grain is a sandblasted finish that is usually stained 
black with deep red highlights, although some are brown stained.  
The Brindle finish is a dark brown stained sandblast that is matched 
with a brown colored vulcanite mouthpiece.  The patented Pebble 
Shell and Brindle Shell are sandblasted and carved finishes similar 
in color to other sandblasted models.  All 1988 and later "Shell's" 
will include the patented number 2176742 within their nomenclature.  
Smooth finished Ashton pipes are graded as either Sovereign or SG (1 
to 5) for graded straight grains.  Smooth Ashton pipes are golden 
colored with waxed bowls and can have either black or brown 
vulcanite mouthpieces. 
 
The nomenclature on Ashton pipes will include the series (Sovereign, 
Pebble Shell, etc) a "size" (explained a little later in this 
section), a year date (4=1984, 5=1985, 6=1986, etc.) the brandname 
(Ashton) and the point of origin (England).  The Ashton logo is a 
"Dunhill Spot" which is actually an inlaid briar dot on the top of 
the handcut mouthpiece. 
 
One area that stands out with Ashton pipes is how Bill has taken the 
basic idea of a "rod stock" mouthpiece a little farther than 
Dunhill.  Rod stock means that the mouthpiece is formed from a solid 
rod of hard rubber (vulcanite) rather than preformed or molded 
blanks (cast stock).  These rods are about four feet in length 
before they are cut for stems and are about one inch wide.  The rod 
is cut into 3 or 4 inch lengths and then cured by boiling.  This 
process removes the sulfur from the surface of the hard rubber stem 
material which in turn makes a harder mouthpiece that resists 
discoloration.  Mouthpieces are formed using drills and files, each 
custom fit to match the bowl in both size and shape. 
 
Like Dunhill, Ashton grades his pipes by their size and in the case 
of the SG straight grains, by grain.  Both smooth and sandblasted 
models are available in 1X (Dunhill group 3 or 4), 2X (group 4 or 
5), 3X (group 5 or 6) and LX (group 6 or ODA size).  By theory the 
other sizes produced by Bill Taylor come in both smooth and 
sandblasted but in actuality, these are only available in non-smooth 
pieces.  The ELX is an extra large size, usually reserved for 
standard shaped pipes.  The "Magnum" and its variations are extra, 
extra large classic shaped pipes that while limited in production to 
less than 20 pieces per year, are very special and unique to the 
Ashton line. 
 
While Magnums are expensive, they offer an outstanding smoking 
experience as the amount of cured briar included with each piece is 
extensive.  Ashton first produced Magnums in a series of 
"Presentation Pipes" housed in custom fitted wood cases.  These 
presentation "Magnums" were not stamped magnum.  The true graded 
Magnum series followed with Magnum "S" (smaller, but still extra 
large) and standard Magnums.  There have also been several "Double 
Magnums" produced which are extremely large examples, although there 
is no additional nomenclature that denotes their extra size. 
 
One of the major problems in producing quality pipes, expecially 
those that are as carefully produced as the Ashton line, is in the 
availability of highly skilled craftsmen to create the line.  When 
Bill went out on his own in 1984 he was depending on his skill and 
experience to produce the pipes that carry his trademark.  However, 
the demand of his line quickly exceeded any capacity that he alone 
could produce and additional craftsmen were needed to increase 
production. Currently the Ashton pipe is produced by the joint 
effort of Jeffrey Mills (stems), Mrs. Y. Mills (finishing), Frank 
Lincoln (total pipe maker - all facets), Sid Cooper (bowl turning, 
with 50+ years experience) and of course Bill Taylor, who is a total 
pipe maker with over 28 years experience. [See note at end revising 
current Ashton employees.] 
 
Within this family, each has a primary skill, however all are able 
to work all of the phases and as a rule, each will work on each 
Ashton pipe.  What this means is that the creation of an Ashton pipe 
is not just the work of one skilled craftsman, but a joint effort of 
all.  This joint effort allows each craftsman to take pride in the 
finished product with each knowing that his skill is a part of the 
final results. 
 
What about the future of Ashton pipes?  In the first years of 
production Bill Taylor has advanced the "Dunhill" process of 
producing a pipe, using his modifications of oil curing, stem 
curing, hand turning bowls, hand making pipe stems, creating a new 
and patented finishing process and added pipe tobacco and cigars to 
his family of products.  Is this all, or are there other ideas in 
the wings? 
 
New products are coming including a new "Tan Shell" light colored 
sandblasted finish which will be called OLD CHURCH (hopefully 
sometime in early 1989).  The Ashton Cigar line is being expanded 
and tobacco line is being expanded to 10 different blends.  Smoking 
cabinets, pouches, special presentation sets and an increased supply 
of patented Pebble Shell pipes should be arriving within the near 
future and after that, who knows? 
 
When asked about his personal and company philosophy William John 
Ashton Taylor responded by saying "To maintain the highest quality 
standards and to be one of the very few true pipe makers. Meaning 
that I start by selecting the briar from the sawmill, age the briar, 
select the best block for a shape, cut and turn the bowl, cure the 
turned shape, handcraft a mouthpiece to a perfect balance, stain and 
finish the pipe and create as near as perfect pipe as I can with all 
of my heart."  It is also the intention of this new company to 
expand into new areas with the same dedication to quality that they 
have shown in their short history. 
 
William Taylor's story is just starting to be told as his "life's 
dream" of owning his own company has come about, and yet is only a 
few years old.  Today's Ashton pipe is as fine a product as can be 
produced in terms of materials and construction.  The end result is 
a handmade smoking pipe that while unique in their individuality, 
are made to be tasted and enjoyed.  The Ashton company is one in 
which production in numbers will always be second to production of 
quality.  One in which the craftsmen behind the final product take 
pride in their work, along with how you judge their efforts. 
 
While it is true that Bill Taylor was trained by Dunhill and learned 
his trade from the company that started high grade pipe 
manufacturer, he has continued to advance these principles of pipe 
making to a new level of excellence.  From a 15 year old apprentice 
turning cigarette holders in 1959 to England's most sought after 
pipe manufacturer in 1989.  The Ashton success story may be a dream 
come true for Bill Taylor, but it is also a pipe smokers success 
story.  Your acceptance and smoking enjoyment of the Ashton pipe is 
the true meaning of success to William John Ashton Taylor and to 
this end he has dedicated his company's efforts.  In today's market 
philosophy, this too is a rare and innovative idea. 
 
END of Original ASHTON Story 
 
*************************** 
 
Update to the Ashton Story from 1990-94 
 
The new Ashton Old Church Tan Shell finish went into full production 
in 1989 with less than 50 pieces produced during the first year.  
Old Church, by the way is the name of the Street that where the 
Ashton Unit is located. The Old church finish is a non-stained 
natural tan color that is moderately dark for a natural finish.  
This darkening is caused by the oil curing process that "cooks" the 
wood.  There is no additional staining or finish added to the Old 
Church, although a slight wax finish is added to polish the bowls.  
Almost all Old Church Ashtons are found with the dark brown stems (a 
few have black bits).   
 
This new finish was produced in both the standard sandblasted finish 
and patented "Shell" process which included the patent number.  Of 
the Old Church pipes produced in this first year most were 2X and 3X 
in size.  A few 1X and LX were offered, but no ELX were made.  There 
has been only 1 Old Church Magnum produced.  This was a medium large 
Billiard with a black saddle bit and nomenclature that read "USA 
001" and is in my personal Collection along with a signed pen &amp; ink 
of the pipe. 
 
The number of workers in the Ashton factory was decreased in 1989 
with the departure of Mr. and Mrs. Mills.  Although it was not 
mentioned in the main article, Mr. Taylor also works in the 
production of Ashton pipes as both as Ashton pipe finisher (stain &amp; 
wax) and the company office manager. As of 1993, Bill's son (Spence) 
has become a full time employee of Ashton pipes.  
 
In 1989 Ashton Products introduced a new line of small cigars, an 
expanded line of hand made Dominican cigars, a series of luxury 
leather cigar cases and 6 new Ashton tobaccos.  As of 1994 Ashton 
large Cigars are very successful in the United States and England.  
For 1990 there were continued expansions into quality leather goods, 
more Old Church pipes and special silver trimmed Ashton pipes (rim, 
spigots and maybe a windcap model).  Starting in 1990 non-smooth 
Ashton pipes will be marked "Shell" rather than Pebble Shell or 
Pebble Grain. As of 1994, this has not completely taken place, 
however the plan is still to produce on "Shell" and smooth Ashtons.  
In addition the patent number will be used on the pipes that are 
carved and blasted, even though all will be marked "Shell".  Over 
the last several years many pieces were mis-marked Pebble Shell or 
Pebble Grain.  The marking of only "Shell" to all non-smooth Ashtons 
will correct this problem. 
 
If you have collected Ashton pipes or have seen quite a few of the 
new patented pieces, you may have noted that there have been three 
different patent numbers used over the last several years.  While 
there was only one patent actually granted Ashton, there is a reason 
for the different patent numbers.  When the patent was first applied 
for the pipes were stamped Pat. Pend. without a number.  After the 
patent was granted the first patent number was stamped on Ashton 
pipes.  This first patent was granted in the name of William John 
Taylor (no Ashton), and so a correction was requested for the proper 
and complete name.  The re-issued "corrected" patent contained a new 
patent number which was then used on the pipes.  In 1989 the final 
"approved after response period" patent papers were issued which 
contained a new final number that is currently used on Ashton pipes. 
 
Starting in 1994, Ashton straight grains are no longer marked SG-1 
or SG-2, but are now marked SG plus A, B, C, D, E for the grade of 
grain. As of late 1994, the Ashton tobacco line is being redesigned 
to include 4 of the original 10 mixtures, plus 6 or 8 new blends 
that should arrive in stores in late 1994 or early 1995. The new 
Ashton tobacco line (all blends) will be produced by McClelland 
Tobacco Company. 
 
Another Collector Fact is that the first Ashton pipes were actually 
produced in late 1983 with most of these using block nomenclature 
rather than the script stampings of 1984 to present.  There are 
other variations to the nomenclature on Ashton pipes that have 
occurred over the years.  These variations will add value to the 
line to the variety collector of Ashton pipes.  The Ashton pipe is a 
new brand that was started just a few years ago and yet have already 
produced a wide variety of products for both the collector and 
smoker.  It is rare in today's market to see a company go back to 
basics and offer a line that puts the product before the profit; 
Ashton does!  There is a bright future for this brand as they offer 
something for everyone.

Dear Steve:

This posting will be (mercifully) short owing to an acute shortage of units
of calibrated time measurement on my part.

First of all, congratulations on passing the 1000-member mark!  I celebrated
the ocassion by smoking a WONDERFUL Bering Baron maduro.  I remember when
Berings were drug-store cigars.  Boy, have they come a long way since then!

Also, I recently did an "oops" and accidentally blew off about 8 back issues
of PD.  Please let me know if there's an ftp site where I can access back
issues.  I don't want to impose on your time since it was my boo-boo, so
rather than ask you to download the missing PD's I'd have no problem just
doing it from the appropriate ftp site.  BTW - for you non-techies out there
an "oops" is a "duh" with a possible excuse due to technical reasons.

And finally...

Tom Bliley's report is finally available through the Net.  Since AOL only
lets me download from ftp's I had to rely on a friend of mine to get it on to
an ftp site.  For those of you know don't know what the Bliley report is (or
for those of you who've forgotten) here is the description as contained in
the file i.d.:

     "This file contains two documents.  The first is a statement made by
     Congressman Thomas J. Bliley, Jr. (R. - Virginia) before Congress on
     July 21, 1993.  This statement concerns the Environmental Protection
     Agency (EPA) and its work on environmental tobacco smoke (ETS).
     
     "The second document is Rep. Bliley's report of his investigation of
     the EPA, with regards to both its ETS report, and its involvement in
     the ETS controversy leading up to the release of its risk assessment
     in January, 1993.  Rep. Bliley's report is extensively footnoted, and
     contains much information unknown to the general public.

     "THIS IS A PUBLIC DOCUMENT AND CAN BE FREELY DISTRIBUTED." 

Now here's the pertinent information.

FTP SITE:  ftp.demon.co.uk
DIRECTORY:  /pub/doc/liberty/FOREST
SHORT FILENAME:  Bliley Report
LONG FILENAME:  Bliley Report to US Congress, EPA disregarding own rules!
FILE SIZE:  117,244 bytes
DOWNLOAD TIME:  &lt;5 minutes (9600 BAUD)

After scanning Bliley's report I had to spend a lot of time cleaning up
formatting glitches and errors made by the OCR software. Numerous checks
against the hard-copy original have ensured that file is a 100% accurate
word-for-word transcription of the report.  I would enjoy hearing from those
of you who download and read this file.

Also - I would appreciate it if someone could help me pass this information
along to alt.smokers, alt.smokers.cigars and alt.smokers.pipes.  My free time
these days is very,very, very limited, and I'd be thankful for an assist in
publicizing the Bliley report's availability.  Since the anti's enjoy a
monopoly on the news media I think it's about time people get some factual
information on the other side of this issue.

Vive le Resistance!

Steve J. (Briar Man) 

[ Steve, I've already posted to a.s.c and a.s.p. announcing the
availability of the Bliley Report, and have distributed it to about 20
requestors. (I've specifically avoided a.s, as I think it'd generate
more trouble than it's worth there.)  I'll prepend your notice to
further copies of the report that I distribute. And thank you very
very very much for your diligence! I know what a pain scanning text
can be. Vive le Resistance!  -S. ]

Hello, Steve,
  In reading back issues of the Digest I have come across numerous
references to Escudo tobacco and a) how wonderful it is and b) how
difficult it is to find.  Well, wanting to try some, I just ordered a
50-gram tin from Iwan Ries (1-800-621-1457).  I asked if they had a fair
amount in stock and the gal on the phone said yes, but only in the 50-gram
size; the 100-gram size having been discontinued.  Their price is $8.30 for
the 50 grams.  I just thought other pipe smokers on the list wanting to get
some might be interested in this information.  According to their price
list, they also have what appears to be a full selection of other favorite
brands including Dunhill, McClelland, and MacBaren.

Gudday! 

After lurking for quiet a while I have decided I had better let you
all know a little about me. I live in Auckland New Zealand and work as
a market manager for a company making TV and Theatre lighting. I look
after the Asian market and spend a fair amount of my time in the Asian
region. I have only been living in Auckland for a year and originally
hail from South Africa with several stops in between, the joys of
working in the entertainment industry. I am 31 years old and have
smoked a pipe since I was 17.  I favour Dunhill Royal Yacht or Dunhill
Black Aromatic at the moment. The choice of Tobak seems to be limited
in NZ, as yet I haven't managed to find any real tobak shops in NZ,
some barber shops and news agents carry limited selections of pipes
and tobaks. Maybye I have been looking in the wrong places any advise
will be greatly appreciated. ( If there are any Kiwi members I would
love to meet you!)

On my  trips to Asia I top up my supplies in Hong Kong. I know there are some
Asian members of the digest so a quick question for them; apart from Davidoff
are there any other shops in the region I should be visiting? As I say I smoke
mainly pipes but  I am about to head to the Philipines and seem to remeber they
have a cigar industry; are there any suggestions on Cigars from this region?

Well I guess that will do for now....
Thanks for the digest and companionship it brings to a lonely smoker at the
bottom of the world.

Cheers

Thank you Steve, I appreciate your hard work in preparing the digest.

I have  received the last couple of digests and have found it be a fantastic
source of information as well as "just plain fun" reading.  Since this is my
"rookie contribution", maybe I should introduce myself.  I'm Troy Causey, a
23 yr old programmer/analyst in the fast and frantic Atlanta Georgia where a
good bowlful is simply "NEEDED".  My only notable achievement is that I work
down the hall from your 1000th member, Mr. Jonathon Davis (the crowd
cheers).  In fact, he told me about the digest.  As my age might suggest, I
am only a couple of years into my pipe smoking "career", but have found
immense pleasure in both the smoke and the fellowship it brings.  As far as
my tastes are concerned, "the worst tobacco I ever smoked was pretty good".
I smoked aromatics like "Wilshire" from Tinder Box, but have begun, thanks
to your digest and its contributors, to try some English blends and find
them quite different, but very very nice.  My small but growing collection
includes a couple of Peterson's, a few Stanwells, Ascorti, Brebbia, GBD, and
a pipe from Claudio Cavicchi near Bologna, Italy.  I have enjoyed and hope
to continue enjoying the digest.  I look forward to the discussion.  Without
further adieu, let the saga continue.  Thanks again.

hi steve, first of all thanks for doing the digest, it's great.
i'm writing because i haven't received this weeks digest. if you haven't 
done it yet, no problem, but if you have i would appreciate it if you would 
send it to  me.
well, i geuss i'll take this oppurtunity to introduce myself. i am a 
sophomore philosophy student at northern arizona university in flagstaff. 
i have been smoking pipes for under a year, so i find the articles on 
different blends very helpful. i tend towards the latakia blends, 
although i have not tried very many of them.(the local shop doesn't have 
a very good selection, but i take what i can get)
the shop in flagstaff is:

<a name="35">Subject: intro message</a>

Thanks VERY much for your extremely prompt reply to my request for 
membership.  Especially appreciate all the introductory info on 
periodicals, clubs, vendors, etc., since I've been following your 
discussion group itself for several months, now.  Here's a brief 
introduction of myself, as requested:
        My name is Tim Ramsay and I'm a graduate student in computational 
commutative algebra (ie. I don't care much about computers per se, just 
what you can DO with them!) at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.  
I've been an avid pipe smoker and amateur cigar fan for about two years, 
ever since (THANK GOD) kicking the cigarette habit.  Nicotine's now a 
fine and dependable friend, rather than an "evil influence" in my life.  
Being a poor student, I find it much more affordable to experiment with 
fine pipe tobacco than fine cigars, hence the preference...
        I started out, as do probably most pipe smokers, with aromatics, 
but soon discovered the clear superiority of the natural English/Scottish 
blends.  Due to the presence in my town of an _excellent_ tobacconist and 
pipe maker, I was lucky enough to avoid the usual introductory route of 
Amphora, Balkan Riff, etc. (Yuck, Yuck, Yuck!).  My current preference is 
a full-bodied, Latakia based, 
Knock-you-over-then-kick-you-when-you're-down tobak experience such as 
Dunhill's Nightcap mixture or Rattray's Black Mallory (do you get 
Rattray's in the States?  I haven't seen any mention of it...), but also 
enjoy a mild-to-medium sweet English in the morning or early afternoon.  
I've got a baker's dozen of pipes, some new, some old, including three 
bent Petersons, a Stanwell, a beautiful little hand-made French job, a 
lovely free-hand made of bubinga wood by my local tobacconist Mike Fagan 
(I can't imagine a better smoking pipe this side of tobacco 
paradise), and an Austrian calabash, the last two being my favorites.
        Mike's got his own line of cigars which he has hand-rolled for 
him from several Havana leafs in Canada by an ex-patriate Cuban cigar 
roller and I consider them, for the money, to be just about the best 
`gars I've ever had.  After some experimentation with Dominicans, 
Hondurans, and the much more expensive imported Cubans, I stick with 
Mike's custom-mades when I want a good smoke.  I've got a girl-friend 
from Italy (Perugia, near Tuscany) who's introduced me to Italian 
Garibaldis and Toscanis, which I must confess I've come to love.  
Unfortunately, I've only managed to find the inferior American imitations 
of these last cigars in Canada but, through my girl-friend, I manage to 
maintain a fairly steady supply from Italy.
        I can't believe that Mike's shop, the Pipe &amp; Pouch, is not listed 
in your resource list, _especially_ in view of the tremendous volume of 
discussion I've witnessed on the availability/quality of genuine Cubans.  
I travel quite regularly to both Toronto and Montreal, have sampled the 
best tobacconists in both cities, and have noticed that Mike's prices on 
Cubans (and other cigars) are consistently from 15% to 25% lower than in 
both T.O. and Mtl.  For example, I was in Montreal yesterday and found 
the _lowest_ price on Cohiba Robustos to be $24(Can.) per.  Mike sells 'em 
for $20 and change (I can't remember exactly, but closer to $20 than 
$21).  This translates, for those math-phobes out there, to a savings of 
at least $100 a box!  Davidoff cigarilloes go for $2.53 per, _at least_, 
in Mtl., and Mike sells 'em for $1.57.  The price differences on his 
other `gars are comparable.   He also makes his own nice and relatively 
inexpensive line of pipes and has around 30 different blends of custom 
tobak, of which I've sampled about half (I'm working on the other half) 
and found to be uniformly excellent.
        This must sound like a sales pitch, so let me assure you that I 
am neither a relative, personal friend, nor (in any way) a business 
partner of Mike Fagan.  I think it's a crime that you folks can't get 
Cubans down there and consider it a public service to help anyone 
enterprising enough to come up to Canada for them to get the best deal 
possible.  His address is Pipe &amp; Pouch, 155 Wellington St., Kingston, 
Ont., Canada, K7L 3E1  (613)549-4477.  Well, this has turned out to be a 
hell of a long submission, so feel free to edit where you will...

                        Smoke just as much as ever, but smoke the best!

<a name="2">Subject: How to fight the Prohibition in Massachussetts</a>

Hi, all,

Someone (Mark?) asked me, in private email, if I had any ideas on how
to fight the Massachussetts law prohibiting nicotine in tobacco. This
particular piece of nonsense is the closest thing to Prohibition we've
yet seen. It's already passed the state House, and is headed for the
Senate and the Governor.

There's only one real answer. ORGANIZE.  Someone up there is going to
have to lead.  If you think you can do it, the time for you is now.
If not, please find out who is leading, and offer your support.

But, from a couple of states away, I do have some specific suggestions
on tactics:

* Call and write your elected representatives.  Tell them your
position. Vote your position.

* Work through the existing organizations. (Sherlock Holmes Pipe Club
is one; are there any cigar clubs in Massachussetts?)  Convince the
membership to work with you.

* Enlist the aid of Cigar Aficionado.  They're the biggest player on
our side right now. Write a letter, urging members to write the
Mass. Senate and Governor in protest.  (But make it easy on the editor;
look up the addresses and send them along.)

* Organize at the grass roots. Set up a petition drive in the cigar
stores and collect signatures.  Remember, each of these folks will be
put out of business by the Stoddart act.

* Convenience stores would be good allies.  They're in business to
make money, not to enforce artificial morality.  Remind them of all
the business they'd lose to neighboring states if the act passes.

* The State House is opening another front in the drug war, with 1/3
of the state's population and 49 other states opposing.  Remind the
voters that someone, namely them, is going to have to pay for the
enforcement of yet another unenforceable law.

* Then, smoke in peace.  Even if you have to drive to New Hampshire or
Rhode Island to buy your terbacky. :-)

				Long live the Resistance!

Dear Steve:
Here's an inquiry:  Does anyone out there have an address or addresses of
pipe shops and tobacconists in Berlin (yes, Germany) as well as in Italy?
Our Directory seems to have relatively few European entries, aside from
London and a few in Copenhagen.

Does anyone have an address for any reputable mail order tobacco
outfits in Washington state?? There is really nothing here in
Vancouver, and I have had some tobacs from south of the 49th, and have
no complaints. I have gone over the resource list, but saw
nothing. The reason for choosing WA is its proximity to BC, hence
(hopefully) cheaper shipping, etc. Also, a pound of tobac locally
ranges around 90$ up!!! With the prices that I have seen for T in the
states, even allowing for exchange, duty, GST, shipping, the price
from US is still cheaper!

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

selection of nationally known brands as well as many private labels.
All of our pipe tobacco is manufactured by Peter Stokkebye of
Denmark. We also carry an assortment of Peterson, Jobey, Butz Choquin,
Comoy's, GBD, and many other pipes.

If any of your subscribers are interested in a catalog or have any

Steve,

I really want to express my thanks for the work you do putting the Digest
out. The lates issue (#187) was especially interesting.  I really enjoyed the
story of Ashton Pipe.

I have about 120 pipes and have been a pipe smoker for more than 25 years=2E
Besides the actual smoking of my pipes I really enjoy reading about the
history of some of the pipe makers and the tobacco companies.  I also enjoy
shopping antique stores and looking for tobacco related items such as old
pipe racks or humidors.

Again, thanks for you efforts.

Regards
Don Churn

Hello,

Living in Fort Collins, Colorado has many benefits.  Mountains
and rivers, good beer, lots of sun, etc.  One of the things missing
though is a selection of tobacco shops.  We have one.  That shop 
is Edwards Darts and Tobaccos.  Dutch (the fella who owns runs the 
place) swears up and down that NO tobacco burns better and that NO
bowl smokes nicer than those produced by Edwards.  Being new to this
game I can't say whether he is blowing smoke up my ___ or not.  What
is the consensus on Edwards products?  If people have opinions please

<a name="9">Subject: Kevin, Kids, and Hysteria</a>

	Kudos to Micheal from Britan(sorry-I don't recall the last name) 
for a lucid critique of the American Zietguist.  Political Correctness 
and its corrolaries(anti-tobacco hysteria being one of them) is nothing 
more than a re-birth of puritanism.  Our public discourse and our 
society's attitudes are permeated by the constant fear that, as Menken 
put it, "Someone, somewhere is having a good time."
	Although the suuporters of the new puritanism ascribe nothing but 
the purest of motives to themselves, the true aim is nothing new or 
noble.  Puritanism, in whatever ilk, is aimed at nothing more than 
control of others.  Michel Foucault noted that our society is one 
charactarized by a complex and subtle web of power that attempts to make 
us all subjects.  While this is certainly true, what is even more 
disturbing is the willingness of people to accept the controls inposed by 
power.  We are like slaves who call for more and heavier chains.
	As far as the youth element of the issue:the sharing of a pipe is 
*not* equilelent to corruption of youth.  Nor is there any basis to 
assume any sort of purient intent in our fellow tobaccophile's actions.  
It is truly unofrtunate that there is a legitimate concern about whether 
his acitons will be construed in this way.
	To veer from political and philosophical matters, I must say that 
I experimented with tobacco from the time I was about twelve years 
old.(Almost nine years ago)  I did not become a drug addict, a pervert or 
a libertine.  The only ill effect I suffered was a ciggarette habit that 
I am just now breaking. Perhaps if I had experimented with pipes rather 
than sucking ceaslessly on the floor sweepings marketed as tobacco by the 
cigarette companies, I would have avoided this as weel.  BTW, one of my 
fist "cigarettes" consisted of some of my father's Amphora rolled up in a 
piece of notbook paper.  
	Enough preaching...I suspect my time on the soapbax is up.:)

I wrote in the last pipe digest for everyone to give me an email if they
wanted to be on the mailing list.  I forgot to mention that the mailing
list is a paper mailing list - would it be at all possible to mail this out
to everyone?  Pulvers' Prior Briar at this time only has a paper mailing
list at the moment - therefore they need to send an address that they can
be reached at.

If you can't, no problem - I'm just getting swamped with requests to be on
the list, and I have to write an apology to most people.

Steve,

   Great job on the digest keep up the good work.  I have followed
most of the articals and was wondering how many of your followers
smoke the Ascorti line of pipes?  This has long been a favorite of
mine. Sometimes I even choose this pipe over the numerous Ashton's and
Dunhill's that fill my racks.

I'm looking to purchase a new humidor for between 12-25 cigars and would like
one of the highest quality. I have heard Davidoff and Dunhill do a fine job,
but I wonder if there is a retailer that sells them at a discount. Ordering
them from the main stores in New York means paying full retail.

I would also love to know of a pipe store that carries the finer brands at a
discount. I would love to increase the collection, but hate to pay the full
price if the same is availible elsewhere for less. Any hints would be greatly
appreciated. Also, is there any other great humidor brands? If so, where does
one go to purchase them? Possibly CA magazine has done an article on this=2E 

Meanwhile I'll just sit back and smoke a bowl of Dunhill 965 and enjoy
myself. I love reading PD and appreciate being apart of this fine mailing
list.

Hi,

After having read so much about English Blends I decided to try them. 
I must say I did try them before once but that was only a sample 
package by W0 Larsen, I liked them, but I wasn't overwelmed.
So I thought let's buy me a tin of Early Morning Pipe. And let me 
tell you, It was an experience. Be it in a negative way. I filled my 
pipe. Lit it and tasted a bar of soap... Put it away, relit it and 
than it tasted quite well. And what a nice pipe it was. The pipe I 
smoked had a relatively small bowl but it lasted for 1 1/2 hour. 
After that one and a halve hour I started feeling sick. Not just sick 
but very _sick_.
I couldn't touch a pipe in days without getting that sick feeling 
again. After a week, smoking was a pleasure again. But not Early 
Moring Pipe, the tint stayed closed for weeks. Then I tried it again, 
and within a few puffs: The same effect.

What could this be? And moreover is this typical for English Blends. 
If so I'll skip them in the future. Dit I make a wrong choise with 
Early Morning Pipe? HELP!

Dear Steve -

Thanks El Mucho for your help in getting the Bliley report out there.  Our
notes must've crossed in the mail, because I sent up my last posting before I
got your note re. getting my floppy, etc.  BTW - I'm glad to hear about the
number of requests you've gotten for the report.  I've put it in the pipe &amp;
cigar library we have here in AmericaOnAndOn - so far about 15 downloads.
 About your reservations concerning a.s - I know that your reservations stem
from flamage (yes, I know about that group).  Howsomever there are 2 things
that might be accomplished.  1 - there might be some people on there who
would actually want to read it, and 2 - for the folks of the other persuation
it would be a "shot accross the bow" so to speak, letting 'em know we're not
afraid to face 'em down.  As far as myself, if I get flamed so be it.  I have
friends know know some ways to neutralize it.  If, however, it would also lay
you open to getting flamed, then by all means follow your instinct - I
certainly wouldn't want to bring that kind of thing down on you.  Whatever
you decide to do is fine with me.

About that Massachusetts thing - WHAT IDIOCY!  I predict the idea will
ultimately get defeated (or perhaps repealed if it passes).  The Mass. State
legislature must be controlled by democrats.  Only "liberals" could come up
with an idea like that.  Perhaps part of liberalism's last gasp?  Oh,
politics...

And one last thing - you didn't answer the question in my last posting re=2E
where I can go to download back issues of the PD.  If there's an FTP site
where I can do this please let me know the site and directory.  Thank you,
Sir!

Lebewohl die Partisaner!

Steve J. (Briar Man)

[ Steve, my concern was not so much about getting flamed (that's
happened _quite_ frequently) as it was about diluting the
effectiveness of the report by making it available to the antismokers
for unopposed rebuttal.  I wanted to mainly disseminate it through the
"friendly" channels.  But I'll follow your wishes and post the
announcement to a.s., if that's what you would like.  (And, BTW, if by
"neutralization" you mean unauthorized cancellation of opposing
viewpoints, I'm opposed to that.)

The FTP and Web sites are listed at the bottom of this mailing, as
always. I'm trying to think of some way I could let folks know that
the Bliley Report is out there, too.

And thank you for your major, major efforts! Long Live the Resistance! -S=2E ]

Dear Steve:

I must begin this note by saying just how much I enjoy reading PD each week.
 You are to be rewarded for the work that you do.  BTW, is there an easy way
for you to segregate the cigar from the pipe stories?

I am planning to attend the Big Smoke in New York on Thursday, May 25.  I was
wondering if anyone else was going?  Perhaps PD readers could get together
either before or after and enjoy a smoke of our own?

Also, if anyone has gone to a Big Smoke before, please help with any info
that I need to know before going.  

Thanks,

[ The question about cigar vs. pipe postings has come up before; it's
hard to do, because some postings concern both pipes and cigars. R the
Big Smoke: just wear a suit and be careful about getting it
burned. And have a designated driver or take mass transit; the alcohol
flows _quite_ liberally. :-) Have fun! -S. ]

<a name="18">Subject: ******Antique Pipe Available****</a>

(forwarded to other members for a possible quicker response.  if you all know
of someone else, send it along.  :)~  )

Greetings one and all,

Well, as some of you can tell, this is pretty important.  A local antique
dealer stopped by the store with a very unique piece that he had no idea what
to do with.  He bought it as part of a jammed humidor at an estate sale and
didn't see it till he got home.  I am the first "dealer" to have seen this
piece, and unfortunately didn't have the disposable income to put down on
this piece at this time, So naturally I thought of you all first and am
providing this opportunity.

It comes with the original case, which has thankfully born the brunt of the
last several decades and also helps to account for the very good condidtion
of the pipe.  It is smokeable, and contained some ash and unsmoked tobak
remnants when I turned it over.  This pipe may have been "smoked" four times.
 There is some damage created by banging the bowl on a hard surface to clear
it of the contents (which judging from the dings was unsmoked tobak.)  

The bowl itself is about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 inches deep and about 3/4 to and inch
accross the top.  Not much caking at all.  The bowl tips outward (helping to
date the pipe...circa 1890 ish I think...)  The Bowl itself is made of wood,
the grain hidden by the finish of the pipe and the metal ring around the top
of the bowl (explanation later).  The coloration starts as a coffee brown at
the bottom and lightens progressively to a honey brown just under the ring.
 There are two grooves running horizontal to the top of the pipe just below
the start of the metal.  the whole wooden portion is highly polished with few
noticable flaws.  There are no identifying marks on this pipe otherwise.  

The metal ring on the bowl (which completely covers the top half and top
edge) is gold colored (he says gold, I say brass....but I am no metallurgist
and he is a chemist by trade...so who knows).  It makes for a very nice
looking pipe.  The metal on the top is dented slightly from the emptying of
the bowl on a hard surface (as mentioned before).  ON the gold there are
silver (real) indian heads in full head dress, leading into flowing corn
stalks with two ears of corn.  There is one of these on either side of the
bowl.  Excellent craftsmanship.  The shank (?) is square/diamond shaped and
is ringed by the gold/brass and one Indian head which goes 3/4 of the way
around the piece.  

The Stem has very little marking from use on it.  It is a resin of some sort,
clear amber in color wit virtually no discoloration from use.  It screws into
the shank via a hand fashioned system using a mallable material that also
acts as a sort of washer...I think it is bakelite or something
similar....could be mistaken.  The stem is the same square/diamond shape as
the shank.

It is a very attractive pipe and has aged very well.  The asking price is
$300, however I would be willing to hear a rough (since you all can't
actually see the pipe) estimate as to the pipes real value.  

If you are interested in buying this piece (Hard to do sight unseen I know)
give me a call at the store during business hours  9 AM to 5 PM Eastern time
 ....The Sundries Shop, (207)-942-1746.  Would like to hear from you.

Dear Steve,

My e-mail address has changed.  My old address was ??????@???.???.  I'm sorry
if this is a nuisance to you.

Thanks for your quick response to my subscription request.  I downloaded all
back issues and subjected my laser printer to a lot of overtime, printing out
the same.  The issues are now firmly ensconced in three-ring binders.

I have relished the reading of the early issues.  It reminds me of the time
that I purchased Book I of the Pipe Smokers' Ephemeris.  I pored over the
pages of that book, all the while savoring my pipes.  My wife thinks I'm
nuts, but so are pistachios.  :-)

With your consent, I plan to keep in regular touch with your mailgroup about
our common interests, namely, pipes and tobacco.  We have few guarantees in
life and there is so much to savor and experience.  I'm not trying to sound
maudlin, but we are dead a long time! :-)

Last year, at this time, my wife and I were living in the French Alps.  While
on a trip to Switzerland I bought a pouch of Avalon Mixture.  It became a
favorite of mine as well as having a favorable WAF (Wife Acceptance Factor).
 When we returned to the US, I was dismayed to discover that it is not sold
here.  I checked with a number of nationally known tobacconists and they were
unable to duplicate Avalon Mixture.  Davidoff of New York suggested that I
contact their Geneva store (which is a shrine, BTW).  I faxed my order.  Six
days later I received the five (50 gram) pouches I ordered along with a
receipt equivalent to $54.00.  The shipping/handling was more than the cost
of the tobacco.  My taste buds had better not change until I have consumed
every ounce or I'll really be kicking myself.

Enough jabbering for now,

James Lawson,  Bangor, Maine

[ Wow! That's some of the most expensive pipe tobacco I've ever heard
of! -S. ]

<a name="20">Subject: Cubans in the States</a>

I'm still amazed, with the cold war supposedly over, that you 
folks can't import Cubans.  I was talking to a tobacconist here 
(who, of course, will have to remain nameless) and he claims to 
send a lot of Cubans down your way.  His strategy is to take 
them out of the box, remove the bands, pack the cigars in 
another container (ie. without "Cuba" written on it), and send 
them by mail.  He also sends the bands in a separate envelope.  
He's only willing to do this by the box (sorry, no singles and 
these babies aren't cheap up here in the North!) but apparently 
does so often.  Of course, if the cigars were stopped at the 
border (although it's hard to imagine why they would be) it 
would be the customer's problem, but this nameless tobacconist 
says that this has, as yet, never occurred.  I'm surprised that 
I've never seen this on the digest.  If this is something that 
the enlightened cigar smoker already knows but deems unsafe to 
discuss in public, I sincerely hope that you will NOT print 
this note.  I'm certainly not trying to wreck a good thing, 
here, just wondering if it's generally known...

[ As long as the tobacconist remains unknown, I see no reason not to
print the note. To this end, I've taken the liberty of jiggering your
address a little so that he or she can't be traced by proximity to
you.  This means that other members are on their own about opening up
similar channels. Thanks!  -S. ]

<a name="21">Subject: Newbie  Uncloaks</a>

Dear Steve:

Thanks for welcoming me into the PD group. As the above indicates, I'm a 
recent arrival in the 'net world. This digest seems like such a comfortable 
place after bumbling around through www and newsgroups.

I've been an intermittent pipe smoker for about 44 years. Recently, after 
having quit cigarettes for about 13 years, I have begun to really enjoy pipe 
smoking. I think this is due to the lapse of the inhaling reflex. I have also 
made a few pipes from briar plateaux which I have enjoyed both for the 
smoking pleasure and compliments received. Made a couple for my son and 
son-in-law.

I have accumulated over 30 pipes of many kinds over the years, ranging from 
drugstore jobs to Stanwells. I'm pretty comfortable with tobaccos I have 
ordered from Carey's over the years. I avoid their "fruit salad" type 
aromatics. I aquired some 965 after reading about it here - excellent!

I mentioned above that I have made a few freehands. I was intrigued by a 
comment by one of the gang that he had a pipe made of bubinga wood. I have 
been curious about other woods suitable for pipe making (other than cherry 
and maple). I have seen several references to wood toxicity in woodworking
magazines, particularly with reference to exotic hardwoods. I asked Tim 
West(the source of the plateau for my favorite freehand) about alternate 
woods, and he couldn't think of any. BTW I'm glad to see him on the resource 
list. I would appreciate if anyone could recommend exotic hardwood(s) with 
qualities similar to mediterranean briar. 

Regarding pipe-friendly places on th SF peninsula: I had visited Old 
Knickerbockers in Menlo Park, but hadn't realized that the affiliated British 
Bankers Club had a pipe smokers' area until I read it here and asked them 
about it. My favorite smoking retreat here in Silicon Valley is an old 
Stanford hang-out called the Alpine Inn in Palo Alto. It is a roadhouse/beer 
garden est. in the 1800's. Many people call it "ZOTTS", a nickname for the 
former owners. I really enjoy having lunch outside and enjoying a pipe close 
by a gurgling creek. Does anyone in this area have a favorite pipe/cigar 
smoking retreat?

Thanks for having me aboard, Steve.

            Bob Weiske &lt;???????@??.??????.???&gt;   

[ ZOTTS (is it all upper case?) sounds interesting! A speakeasy for
cigar lovers in deepest California! Thanks! -S. ]

How are you? Well, I hope. When I subscribed you requested that I

present it to you. I am a 19 year old history student at Virginia
Commenwealth University, working his way toward law school. I have
been smoking cigars for about a year and have been experimenting with
pipes off and on now for about six months. I have found the Digest to
be very well run and very informative, and so I look forward to
recieving it. I live in the Richmond, Va. area and would love to talk
with anyone about cigars and pipes, in person or by email, contained
in the header. For those in the Richmond area, or passing through, I
would like to recommend The Tobacco House, Ltd. at 3138 West Cary
Street. They have a fair selection, I have not been to many tobacco
stores so this is pure opinion, of pipes, both new and used, tobacco,
and cigars. They are a friendly bunch who are always willing to talk.
I have rambled on enough and so I bid you a wonderful evening.

Yours,

Greetings!

Please sign me up for a subscription to Pipe Digest!

Wife &amp; I just started smoking Pipes this past January and discovered
the digest in the Compuserve Bachus Wine Forum Smokeshop just last
month.  The pub is a real treasury, since there are very few books in
print dealing with the topic.

Prior to January we were both non-smokers, and started the hobby for
health reasons.  (Hope the Tobacco Polizei don't see this heresy!)
Nicotine relieves many of her migraines w/o the use of hard drugs.
Even her doctor agrees it's worth continuing as long as it helps.  I
find that it soothes my ADD-churned brain and helps me lose weight to
boot!  Most important, our hyperactive Belgian Sheepdog mellows
considerably when the air is full of aromatic tobacco smoke, often
choosing to lay peacefully in another room while we puff (and not a
minute longer, I might add).  We haven't had to slip downers into his
water for weeks.  What's a remote chance of cancer compared to those
benefits?

<a name="25">Subject: Misc pipe stuff</a>

Hello Steve and PD Readers!

I've got three things to pass on in this letter:  1)  some great replies to
the questions I had, related to being a new pipe smoker, 2) a very exotic
pipe for sale, for serious collectors only, and 3) An update on replies on my
upcoming cross country venture:

First, I got some real good advice from Ed Berggren that I thought was just
too good to keep to myself.  Other new pipe smokers might find this valuable:

------Start of stuff from Ed-------
1)  Relative to tamping:  Yes, tamping definitely helps a pipe stay lit
longer.  As it is smoked, the tobacco tends to loosen up a bit.  Tamping
helps keep it packed together so that one lit strand can light an adjacent
one.  In fact, one of the big problems in my pipe smoking life is holding
onto the pipe with one hand while tamping with the other while driving down
the highway at 65mph.  If, in your travels, you figure out how to solve
this one, please let me know.

2)  Relative to moisture:  Most of the moisture that collects in the bottom
of your pipe is the result of the tobacco burning (heat creates
condensation).  Aromatic tobaccos, in general, tend to smoke "wetter" than
the English-Scottish blends, but there are exceptions to everything.  Also,
some of the moisture is spittle running down the stem.  Pipe cleaners are
the simplest solution.  When your pipe starts to gurgle, run a cleaner down
the stem and (carefully) into the bowl.  It will absorb the moisture and,
with a little tamping, you're on your way.  Of course, the cleaner comes
out dirty and smelly, so you may not want to wave it about in polite
company.  Peterson makes its famous "system" pipes which have an extra
chamber beneath the bowl to collect the moisture.  I've never had a
Peterson, so I can't speak from experience, but a lot of folks swear by
them.  I do believe they're a bit pricey.  Richard Hacker in his book, "The
Ultimate Pipe Book" writes about something called Nording Pipe Stones which
are small clay pellets.  You drop 3 or 4 of these into your pipe before
loading and they absorb the moisture.  I haven't been able to find any of
these in the shops I frequent, so again I can't tell you if they work.
----End of stuff from Ed-------

By the way, I did check my local pipe shop, and they hadn't even heard of the
pipe stones, although they did have some disposable crystals of some type
that you're supposed to put in the bottom of the pipe and dispose of with the
dottle.  It didn't seem too good an idea to me, but the pipe stones still
sound very intriguing to me.  Also, Ed, my friend Vern said that he's SEEN
the pipe caps, that you mentioned in the last PD, at our local pipe shop, but
I haven't seen them myself.  I'll check next time I'm in there and get back
to you if they have them.

And speaking of the pipe shop, the second item is kind of an interesting
one-- while talking with the shopkeep, a nice young lady who has apparently
been running the place for years, talked to me a little about the subject of
pipe collecting, and she wanted me to let everyone know that they have a pipe
for sale, so here it is.  Hold onto your hats:

Pipe For Sale:
Very high end, carved Meerschuam-- never smoked.  It's a large pipe that
should stay on a table (handling should be avoided).  The pipe is a carving
of Anthony kneeling by a nude Cleopatra.  The intricate carving, from a solid
piece of Meerschaum, is adorned with many other detailed features.  It was
carved in 1979 by Ismail Ozel (there is an umlaut over the "O"), in Turkey.
 The whole pipe is about the size of a small football (probably not the
standard unit of measure for pipes, but I'm new to this, so forgive me).
 This pipe is an incredible looking piece, but due to the price, I'm sure is
only for the serious collector.  It is reported to be one of the largest
Meerschaums in the U.S., and the asking price is $15,000.  If you want to
know more about it, let me know and I will get details.

Regarding my trip across the U.S., I got some GREAT responses from people,
including offers to just call and say "hi", and offers to visit and have a
smoke, which is really going to be neat, I think!  I've got a couple places
in Colorado to stay, a couple in Arizona and an offer for a night in central
Virginia.  As for the rest of the trip, I'm tentatively planning to sleep in
my Mazda pickup, under the safety of a canopy most of the time, but may hit a
motel from time to time to freshen up.  Regarding the canopy, I've got a
"beater" identified for $70 which I'll probably buy, and then if I can find a
better one in the meantime I'll get it instead.  I'd like to have something a
little nicer than the one I've found, but the one I've found recently will do
until then.  Then I need to get someone lined up as a housesitter to watch
the place and mow my lawn, etc. while I'm gone, and then I'm on the road!

One the most important items in preparation for the trip is now taken care
of-- I have a laptop computer with AOL software installed and a modem, such
that I can should be able to make contact with the PD crew and keep ya'll
posted on what's transpired, and which great pipe related discoveries I might
have made along the way.  A couple of people told me about some neat shops in
some out of the way places that are a "must visit", so I'll try to hit those,
including "Bob", who suggested a couple of places in Louisiana, in Baton
Rouge and New Orleans.  It's shaping up into an interesting trip already, and
I haven't even gotten on the road!

If anyone has anything else that I should add to my list, or again, either has
 a place, or can suggest a place where I could park my truck to sleep and/or
take a shower (like a community pool that's open in the morning or whatever),
I'll put it into the my database that I've got compiled for the trip.  Any
advice on good pipe spots to visit, interesting people to talk to, places to
eat, or sights to see are appreciated.  I don't know when, or IF I'll have a
chance to take another trip like this, so I'd like to see as much as I can.

Thanks to all the great people who've written already, especially those
who've offered a place to stay and/or the chance to sit down and have a smoke
and talk for a few hours.  I'm looking forward to it!

Sorry to take so long to get back to you steve.  You asked me if Universal
 Studio Tours was a major tourest attraction?  It is considered one of Los
Angles' main attractions .  Families from all over the world travel to this
entertainment theme park each year, so it does to tend to get very crouded.
 My family has spent the entire day there many times but we always try to get
there early.

   There is a tram tour that my kids loved cause you can see them making
movies, they take you on the back lot where you see the streets and sets
 used to make movies.  You can see a real soud stage and have an encounter
with King Kong and the Shark from Jaws.  You can see the back to the Future
and Backdraft attractions.  My two year old loved the E.T. special effects
ride across the universe with E.T.  I could go on and on belive me Steve it
is BIG  BIG  BIG Thank you Don ???????@???.???

[ Gee, Don, I'm confused (but that's nothing new. :-) I thought _you_
were asking _me_! Thanks for the info! -S. ]

Steve: Thanks for adding me to the list. As for personal  background I 
have smoked cigars since college (mid-60's). I have been on Guam for the 
past ten years coming out here as news director of one of the commercial 
television stations. Before that, I was in mostly small to medium markets 
on the Mainland for about 15-years. For the past six years I have been 
Director of Public Affiars for the University of Guam. Not only is Guam a 
tropical paradise with great diving-- we are also within 4-1/2 hours of 
just about every Far Eastern Capitol...and only 3-1/2 hours from Hong 
Kong, i.e, Cuban cigars! Living out here has allowed me to collect some 
rather unusual, and interesting, cigars. I have two boxes of really good 
cigars that I picked up in Burma some time back plus any number of 
"exotics" from Indonesia and the Philippines. Anyway, there are some 
cigar lovers out here and we are trying to form a club. When we organize 
I'll send the information to you so that any weary traveler passing 
through here (7-1/2 to 8-hours just from Hawaii) will have a place to 
relax with other cigar smokers. Being 8,000 miles from the Mainland it's 
great to have a list like this so that we don't feel completely isolated 
from our hobby. Yours truly, John D. Morvant, University of Guam 

[ Welcome, John! I've occasionally been curious about Burma cigars;
perhaps you could share your findings? -S. ]

<a name="30">Subject: Pipe digest submission</a>

Hi, thanks for letting me in to the group and here's to a
prosperous future!

I've been pipe smoking for about four years now, with the
occasional cigar and sometimes a good Nat Sherman or a
handrolled cigarette of Native American Blend Tobbacco.
Since I'm probably A little inexpierienced in the
'International' pipe scene I will gladly listen to the
wisdom of my smoking elders.

My pipe collection consists of about seven or so quality
Pipes with one small cased Meerschaum wich I am working on
breaking in.  By far I prefer the apple shapes with a
diamond cross section so I can set it down, But freehand
andSlightly bent shapes are nice to.  I'd have to say right 
now about the best pipe I like smoking is My Falcon from Dr 
Grabow (yes I know I can hear the sniffs of disdain but for 
the money it is a good pipe).

As for blends I prefer the aromatics, having tried a few of 
the more traditional blends. I especially liked Cesear
Borgia from Amphorae.  It's sadly out of stock now and
I hear they do not make it any more.

As for things I would like to see any articles on Pipes and 
tobbacco which would be of intrest in historical nature as
well as of practical.  It's nice to know how to smoke or
choose the right smoke, but it's also good to not repeat the 
mistakes of the past.

Well, until later, enjoy a pipeful.

Jeff

<a name="31">Subject: water pipe description</a>

Steve, 
I thought this might be of some interest to PD readers.

I have a Lebanese water pipe inherited from my grandparents.  It is called an
'arkilley' or 'arkilleh' or 'arghilleh'  depending on the accent of the person
pronouncing the name.  God alone knows what the real spelling would be.  It
was brought to this country by my Lebanese great-great-grandmother when she
immigrated to Rhode Island in the 1880's.  I don't know how old it is in fact
but it is obviously over a century.  I have seen a photo of her smoking it
around 1920.  It is unused since the 1930's when she died.  (Health nazis
please note:  she died of VERY old age.)

The base is dark green, cut glass with what I assume to be hand painted
flowers on it.  It is about 18 inches high.  The metal parts are white brass. 
Two tubes of different lenght go into the base (one into the liquid, the other
just above it.)  The tubes go up to a cap that seals the base.  The submerged
tube connects to the bowl that holds the charcoal and tobacco; the other
connects to a spot on the side of the cap where the mouthpiece hose is
inserted.  The bowl, which holds the tobacco, has a pottery (ceramic?) bowl
that fits on top of it leaving a little air space.  I believe this topmost
bowl holds the charcoal used to ignite the tobacco.  (Please keep in mind that
I am working from old memories of my grandparents' descriptions and they never
actually used the thing.)  The metal section is all one piece.  The hose is
ribbed and flexible like a narrow vacuum cleaner hose.  The mouthpiece appears
to be ivory.

When used, the base would be filled with water to just below the shorter metal
tube.  A dollop of arak, which is an anise-flavored Lebanese liquor, was
added.  (I remember a bottle of arak my grandfather had, it was 110 proof! 
Whew!  Lebanese moonshine!)  From his description, it sounds like the tobacco
was a plug of Virginia leaf.  He said it was somewhat sticky and broad, so I
assume it was plug tobacco.  This would be cut up very coarsely and placed in
the bowl.  The charcoal was ignited and placed in the bowl above it where it
would start the tobacco smoldering.  By drawing on the mouthpiece, a slight
vaccum was formed which drew the smoke down into the liquid.  The smoke would
rise to the air space and be available to the smoker.  By passing through the
liquid, a lot of the tar and other nastiness would be filtered out and the
smoke would take on some of the flavor of the arak.  The result was apparently
pretty mild.  The base had to be emptied and thoroughly cleaned after each
use.  You can imagine what that liquid was like after a good long smoking
session.

I have no reason to think this water pipe is especially valuable or rare.  I
am told that many of my G-G-grandmother's contemporaries (all women) also
smoked similar pieces.  Oddly enough, my grandparents did not remember men
using the water pipes.  They smoked either pipes or, more often, cigars. 
Certainly none of that group of immigrants would have been able to afford
anything rare or expensive.  I received it because I am the only descendent
who	=E7Dokes
some good flake Virginia and (cheap) bourbon in the water.

Hope this bit of family history wasn't too boring.  It might be interesting to
hear from others who have smoking pieces passed down through the generations. 
Happy Puffing.  The Bear.

#include &lt;walter_winchell.h&gt;

(DAHdidit dit DAHditDAHdit diDAH): Some good news on the political
front: We heard this week that Santa Barbara, CA has repealed their
ban on smoking in restaurants.  Reason: restaurant owners complained
that it was driving business to neighboring towns that let the
restaurant owners decide for themselves.  Unconfirmed, but a point for
our side if true! See later in this issue.

Administrativa: From time to time, readers have asked me to separate
the cigar and pipe articles.  For various reasons, this would be
somewhat difficult for Yr. Moderator to undertake. 

However, I do have an idea which might help those members who, like
Art Gorski below, have newsreaders that can search for keywords.  I'd
like to suggest that submitters put the word [PIPE] or [CIGAR] in
their Subject: line.  As in:

	Subject: [PIPE] Plumber Needed; Basement Flooded!
or
	Subject: [CIGAR] What This Country Needs is a Good 5-cent Cohiba!

Not a rigid rule, just a suggestion. And now, on this beautiful late
spring evening, please join us in lighting up and enjoying the finer
things...

&gt;You are to be rewarded for the work that you do.  BTW, is there an easy way
&gt;for you to segregate the cigar from the pipe stories?

Here's a tip that may work for Stuart and others when reading the Digest.
I use Eudora on a Mac, which lets you search the current message for
occurences of a word or phrase.  So I just search for each occurence of
'cigar' and zip through the Digest to the parts of interest to me!  Not
that I don't respect the pipe smokers in the audience! ;-)

From: David Fred &lt;???@???.???.???&gt;
<a name="3">Subject: delurk and general comments  (Re: PD #187)</a>

I subscribed to Pipes Digest sometime last fall and have been reading
with interest and appreciation ever since, though until now I have not
posted.

By way of an introduction, I started smoking cigars about 1.5 years
ago and pipes just this last winter.  I had tried smoking a pipe 2-3
years ago with disappointing results, though now looking back on my
consternation it is somewhat humorous. At 27 I am on the younger end
of the traditional cigar/pipe smoking spectrum.  I often feel that
some (not all!) dismiss new smokers' enjoyment of the pastime by
implying that they are simply trying to be trendy or appear
sophisticated.  While this can definitely be true in some cases, it
seems like this sort of attitude can result in the loss of an
opportunity to form bonds and friendships between people with a common
interest.  As has been observed over and over again here and
elsewhere, pipe and cigar smokers *tend* to be interesting and
thought-provoking people; the newer and/or younger ones aren't
necessarily an exception to the rule.

My motivation to post was my desire to commend Michael Bywater
&lt;??@???????.?????.??.??&gt; for his erudite and entirely appropriate
commentary on the state of things here in the US in PD #187.  The idea
that one can attain liberty by the passage of more law is completely
dumbfounding.  And as Michael said, it's not only the laws.  It seems
as if the willingness to openly condemn others as bad or evil, on both
sides of what's left of the political spectrum, has gotten totally out
of hand.  Open discourse has its place, but so do tolerance and
civility.  The current state of affairs is a sad commentary on what a
nominally free society can produce.

Incidentally, I also took up cigar and pipe smoking because of the
associations it had to my maternal grandfather.  Though he did not
directly introduce me to the practice (that was my cousin's doing) I
have a difficult time not thinking of him when I smell cigar or pipe
smoke in the air.  I find it nice that my mother enjoys my cigar
smoking because of the positive associations it has for her.  (Though
my father has a rather different opinion.)

My grandfather will celebrate his 80th birthday on the 2nd of June
this year.  I am planning to buy him a very nice box of cigars, which
seems a fitting and nicely circular gift.

In closing, here's a quote I ran across recently:

"He's an old friend," I said, "I nearly sent him some pipe-tobacco
once."  -Ernest Hemingway, A Farewell to Arms

[ Thanks, David! And I hope your grandfather enjoys his present.
Please wish him a happy birthday from us. -S. ]

there, BUT, the sin tax on cigars in WA is 74.8%  It is MUCH cheaper to 
order from like Smokin Joes or Holts (both of which you can check 
prices at the Fuji Cigar Page).

Not sure if you saw it or not, but about two weeks ago we added a 
mailto from our Fuji Page to your wonderful digest.  Out URL is 
<a href="http://www.netins.net/showcase/fujicig.">http://www.netins.net/showcase/fujicig.</a>

BTW -  Any smokers (pipes are welcome too :) in the Seattle area are 
invited to the Seattle Smokers at FX McRory's on May 18th at 7:00pm.  
The last went for six hours and between the ten of us (9 guys and one

At the risk of getting my hands slapped by our moderator, I'm going to 
mention a commercial supplier.  [Yes, Steve, I agree with your position; 
but it seems the last half dozen digests have been cluttered with this 
issue.]  About six months ago I joined the International Cigar Club.  
Each month they ship 4-6 cigars that are all in the same size group.  
They charge about $11 per shipment with a free shipment if you refer a 
new member.  [I'd be happy to split this windfall if any truly wants to 
join.  Other than that, there is no personal affiliation with this 
company.]  The included newsletter briefly describes where the tobacco 
was grown, the size of the cigar, and the length. One month was double 
coronas.  They were long and fat.  Churchills are also fat, but not as 
long.  Rothchilds are shorter yet.  This leads me to the question I 
wanted to ask here.  Can anyone point me to a reference on cigar sizes?  
Basically I'm looking for a listing of ring gauges and lengths versus the 
names commonly used for that cigar size.  Thanks for the info.

Two ideas for your (and my) smoking while driving problem...

First, try steering with your left knee.  Unless you have
really bad alignment (or no left leg) this should work for 
you.  I've never wrecked cause of it =)

Second, get and extra-long tamper and mount it on the ceiling
of your car in front of you.  As all you'll need to do is lift
your chin- and voila!  

The first method may be more effective, but the picture of the 
second is a lot funnier.

[ Third, mount a tamper shaped like an inverted U on the left side of
your steering wheel. Then you can tamp and make left turns at the same
time! -S. ]

<a name="10">Subject: Tamping &amp; Driving</a>

&gt; In fact, one of the big problems in my pipe smoking life is
&gt; holding onto the pipe with one hand while tamping with the other
&gt; while driving down the highway at 65mph.  If, in your travels,
&gt; you figure out how to solve this one, please let me know.

There are two methods I can tell you for this, though neither is
really recommended. (If either of these techniques causes you to
crash and break both legs, don't come running to me!)

The first is a little trick I learned from my father called
"driving with your knees". Using this technique necessitates
three things 1) cruise control, 2) a straight road, and 3) good
wheel alignment. Simply set your cruise control to the speed you
want to keep going and bend your legs until your knees touch the
bottom of the steering wheel. This will keep the wheel immobile
for long enough to get a good tamp. You can even make minor
corrections to direction by shifting your legs around.

The second trick also needs a fairly straight road, but not
cruise control. The wheel aligment still needs to be pretty good,
though not as good as method one. I call it "driving with your
wrists". Lean forward until you can rest your lower wrists on the
wheel at the noon position. You should have enough friction from
your wrists to make directional changes to stay in lane, and
since you're working right in front of yourself, your eyes are
still mostly on the road. However, this method does involve
removing the pipe from between your lips.

Personally, I've noticed that if I'm going fast enough, and the
road is straight enough, and my alignment is good enough, I can
take my hands off the wheel for up to thirty seconds before I
start to drift out of my lane. I wouldn't tell anybody else to do
this, though.

Hi Steve,

I received the following poll from Dayton Matlick and offered to put this 
in the Pipe Digest.  If you feel this questionnaire is not appropriate 
for the Pipe Digest, I understand, and will convey that to Dayton.
Here's his poll [any typo's are sadly my own]:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
SpecComm International, Inc. is primarily a tobacco publishing house.  We 
have four publications that serve the tobacco industry from seed to final 
sale, one for more than 125 years.  The only void is direct service to 
consumers of tobacco products.

We have been asked by the industry to create a quarterly magazine for 
pipe smokers.  We tentatively call this PIPES AND TOBACCOS.  However, 
before we go forward with this publication, we need to know whether there 
is a "need" or desire for such a publication.  With this in mind, we ask 
that you fill out this questionnaire and turn it in before you leave. [I'm 
quoting here, please understand,  mark rice.]

RATING SYSTEM: Below is a list of article ideas.  Please rank each 
article on a scale of zero to 100, with zero being an article in which 
you have absolutely no interest and 100 being an article that you would 
seek out and definitely read in its entirety.

1. The countries and circumstances under which tobaccos are gorwn for use 
in pipes.  RATING:____

2. A specific look at each of the major types of tobacco used in pipe 
tobacco blends with background on the country, how the tobacco is raised, 
curing, processing and necessary handling. (A series of articles.)
RATING:____

3. Briar:  Where the best briar comes from, how it is found and dug.
RATING:____

4. Selecting briar for excellence.  RATING:____

5. A company by company look at top pipe producers would-wide. (A series 
of articles.)  RATING____

6. Meerschaum source--where it comes from and how it must be handled.  
RATING:____

7. A look at famous pipes down through history.  RATING:____

8. Profiles of famous living personalities who smoke pipes.  RATING:____

9. Profiles of famous personalities from the past who smoked pipes.

10. Wines that blend well with various pipe tobacco blends.  RATING:____

11. Liqueurs that blend well with various pipe tobacco blends.  RATING:____

12. Anti-smoking restrictive efforts and how they affect us all.  RATING:____

13. New laws and regulations around the country restrict our smoking 
pleasures.  RATING:____

14. Information about what you as an individual can do to resist 
anti-smoking efforts.  RATING:____

15. Restaurants and other establishments that are pipe friendly.  RATING:____

16. Travel and lodging opportunities that are pipe friendly.  RATING:____

17. Pipes and tobaccos in foreign lands. RATING:____

18. Pipe fundamentals.  (How-to series) RATING:____

If a magazine exitsted that covered the features you rated highly above, 
would you subscribe?  Yes___    No____.  Would you prefer to buy 
individual copies at your tobacconist's shop?  Yes___   No___.

Would you be willing to pay $15 a year for four quarterly issues?

Describe your occupation:

Please give a general indication of your annual income to help us judge 
the potential for advertising interest.

How often do you smoke your pipe?

Do you also smoke cigars?  Yes___    No___.  If yes, how often?

Do you also chew tobacco products or use snuff?  Yes___   No___.  If yes, 
how often?

How much did you pay for your last pipe?

Thank you very much for your cooperation.  Your responses will be 
critical in helping us evaluate the potential for a PIPES AND TOBACCOS 
magazine.

Mr. Matlick stated that the proposed magazine is going to be a high 
quality publication (not a newsletter, but a color publication with slick 
sheets, etc.).  Due to the fact that SpecComm doesn't have an e-mail 
address (something they need to remedy... soon) Matlick offered a 
snail-mail address:  SpecComm,  Mr. Dayton Matlick,  3000 Highwoods 
Blvd.,  Suite 300,  Raleigh, N.C.  27604

Due to the fact that these surveys contain personal information (salary, 
etc.) I was going to offer to be a funnel point for completed forms and 
mail the print-outs.  (This would yield a higher response percentage from 
those receiving the survey.)  I'm not going to fill in the salary info, just 
because I'm a private individual.  If anyone wants to bypass the drudgery 
of mailing it, I'm open to having their form sent to me, and I'll just 
package them up on a diskette and ship them off.  

I have no business or even personal relationship with SpecCom, Mr.  
Matlick, or anyone associated with this proposed magazine effort.  I 
just feel that a targeted audience like this needs to provide input on 
something that I see so much discussion about here... tobaccos, blends, 
what to drink with a bowlful, tobacco growing, curing and processing.  

I'll ask Mr. Matlick if he would share an overview of the received 
questionnaires once they process the replies.

I would like to invite everyone to a hospitality room at the Stouffer
Concourse Hotel (the site of the convention).  This invitation is
extended particularly to all readers of alt.smokers.pipes and 
Pipes Digest. We will have an ice-breaker on pre-opening night 
(Friday, May 26).  The smoking light will also be on before and 
after the banquet (May 27).  We'll also have a wind-down party 
after the smoking contest (on May 28).  So, if you are planning 
to attend the convention, you might want to plan to stop by to 
meet in reality some of the folks you know from the net. We'll
enjoy liquid refreshments, sample tobaccos (several blends from
Cornell and Diehl will be available for your sampling), show off
new acquisitions, swap pipes, tell pipe stories, and create a
smoke-filled room. 

If you have any suggestions for refreshments, or if you would like
more details, please e-mail me at

In the 32 years I have smoked a pipe, I have developed a simple criteria for
chosing a really good shop.  First, it must be really cluttered and possibly
even dirty.  Most of the clutter must be tobacco stuff, hopefully pipes of
rare and distinguished vintage.  Second,  the owner and the workers must
smoke a pipe, hopefully with all natural blends.  Third,  they must have a
repair capability.  Fourth, they should not rush you into buying.  Simple
criteria but it works for me.  Bob

Thanks for enrolling me.

I'm afraid I'm not that much of a pipe smoker anymore.  In fact, I have a
running battle with my doctor about whether my one pipeful a month is a bad
habit.  He says it is but can't give me a reason.  I'm 64 but in good health. 
I haven't smoked a cigarette in almost 30 years.  Before I quit cigarettes I
smoked my pipes several times a day.  Then I quit entirely for a few years and
when I permitted myself to start up again I found that I wasn't the smoker I
had been.

But I still like my pipes and cigars and under certain circumstances can't
imagine not having them nearby.  I can't go fishing without one, for instance.

For years I just smoked Edwards pipes--cheap but utilitarian.  Now I buy a pipe
here and there, usually on the basis of how well it's carved.  I've had some
good pipes but lost them; the army is hard on any kind of ownership and
graduate school not much better.

I smoke a different tobacco every time out.  In fact, I usually buy both pipes
and tobacco when I'm on the road, so I end up with some occasional surprises. 
I like burley cavendish combinations, I'm not too concerned about the cut, and
I don't mind some aromatic additive once in a while.

That's about it.

************** 
 
A PIPE SMOKER'S GUIDE 
 
HOW TO SMOKE FLAKE TOBACCOS 
 
English and Scottish-style Matured Virginia flake tobaccos are  
among the most interesting and rewarding for the smoker to taste; 
yet, they are avoided by many smokers who simply do not know how to 
approach them. This article is intended to help the pipe smoker 
learn how to fully appreciate the zesty character and subtle 
sweetness of these premium, aged products. (It should also help 
smokers of the flavored American sliced plug and European flake 
cavendish tobaccos.) 
 
One reason flake tobaccos are left in slices after cake-maturing is 
that they retain their freshness better than in ribbon form. Flakes 
also enable the smoker to have some control over the burning rate 
and, to a small degree, the flavor. 
 
It is important to prepare the tobacco before packing so that it has 
an even texture and to fill the bowl evenly, no matter what degree 
of brokenness is preferred. (The more fully-rubbed -- meaning gently 
separated -- a tobacco, the faster it will burn. Similarly, it is 
true that the thinner the cut, the faster it will burn.) 
 
The more moist tobaccos should be packed more loosely than normal so 
they won't pack down densely enough to prevent a good draft. The 
ideal is to have the tobacco draw firmly, with a little resistance, 
throughout the smoke. The smoker may be able barely to hear a little 
hissing through the pipe as it is smoked. Too firm and the tobacco 
won't burn at all or one small spot will burn hot and maybe wet as 
the smoker puffs hard to keep it going; too loose and the tobacco 
will burn inconsistently and unevenly, perhaps causing the bowl to 
overheat in spots and moisture to condense. 
 
Five Steps to Success 
 
1. Put in the palm of one hand the amount of tobacco that it is 
believed will fill the bowl. Then pinch at the slices or rub them 
between the palms until the tobacco separates to the degree 
preferred, keeping the texture even, avoiding clumps. The denser the 
tobacco is left, the slower it will burn. (This becomes especially 
valuable on windy days outdoors.) 
 
2. Gently but firmly and evenly work the tobacco into the bowl of 
the pipe until it is filled slightly over the top and feels firm but 
still springy under enough finger pressure to flatten the surface of 
the tobacco even with the top of the pipe. (we assume the pipe is 
clean at the outset, free of obstruction to a good draft, well 
rested . ) 
 
3. Now, while drawing through the stem, light the pipe evenly across 
the entire surface of the tobacco. After a few puffs to develop an 
ash, and while continuing to draw, tamp the tobacco down evenly all 
around the bowl with a tamper. The goal is to have the tobacco 
packed so that it will burn as evenly and firmly as a good cigar. 
 
4. Relight the pipe after tamping to get the entire surface of the 
tobacco burning again. Even burning is very important. Otherwise, 
hot spots may develop. 
 
5. With only occasional tamping as the tobacco burns down, since it 
tends to expand and loosen as it burns, the pipe should now smoke 
evenly to the bottom. The aim is to maintain a firm, even draft 
throughout the smoke. The process is not difficult to master and 
with practice will soon be effortless. 
 
A Note on Flavor Expectations 
 
For those who are used to the "aromatic" or sweetened tobaccos that 
dominate our market in the United States, it may take some time for 
the additives remaining in the pipe to dissipate. Many smokers 
prefer to maintain one set of pipes exclusively for the natural, 
matured tobaccos and another for the sweetened varieties. It may be 
necessary to smoke Up to four ounces of a natural product before the 
mouth adjusts to the clean taste and subtler range of flavors 
typical of these Matured Virginia tobaccos. The smoker is rewarded 
for the effort as he becomes able to distinguish the delicate 
variations in taste and deepening richness these tobaccos develop as 
they are smoked.

Steve,

London's "Financial Times" newspaper  had an interesting reference to our own
President Bill Clinton.  This can be found on page "X,"  of the May 6/7, 1995
edition.  Christopher Hitchins, in a book review about marijuana, included
the following sentence:
"Meanwhile my other Oxford contemporary William Jefferson Clinton (who never
needed to inhale, by the way, because he baked his marijuana into cakes and
cookies) told his own surgeon general that her proposals on decriminalisation
(sic) would not even be discussed."

Ever since Mr. Clinton fibbed to us about smoking dope but not inhaling, I
was puzzled.  Perhaps Mr. Hutchins above statement clarifies some things. ;)

<a name="23">Subject: New Popularity of Good Cigars</a>

Steve,
        In yesterday's Rocky Mountain News (5/8/95) there was an interesting
article about the resurgence in popularity of good cigars and cigar dinners
("Get Along Little Stogies" - cute, huh? - by Bill St. John, the News dining
and wine critic). Even though I'm not at present into cigars (purely due to
deficient pecuniary resources (read: "I can't afford 'em") I found the
article of interest and thought others on this list who can afford them and
do smoke them might also.  If I can quote some of it:
        ..."What's in are imported, hand-rolled, premium cigars.  "My fine
cigar sales were up 62% in 1994 over 1993," says Jon Cacherat, owner of
Prince Philip's Pipes &amp; Tobacco in Tamarac Square.  "And up 42% in 1993 over
1992."
        ..."To growing legions of cigar aficionados, cigars taste better
than ever. Enter the cigar dinner: Dozens of tux-clad penguins - and,
increasingly, penguinettes - gather in a snazzy restaurant to put away
martinis, single malt scotches, a few courses of top-drawer cooking and
superlative wines - all the while puffing away at several types of cigars.
        ..."Last month, the Ritz-Carlton, Aspen - along with 31 other Ritzes
from Spain to Australia - participated in Cigar Aficionado/Ritz-Carlton's
International Cigar Celebration Dinner: eight different primo cigars; five
courses of five-star food; four super wines; 65 puffers. Sold out, weeks in
advance.
        "Look, I live in Boulder," says lawyer Fred Marienthal, who attended
the Aspen dinner.  "The only place I can smoke a cigar in Boulder is when
I'm walking my dogs."
        "Marienthal's is the voice of a new generation of cigar smokers.
They're back and they're smokin'.
        ..."In Denver, no one has hosted more cigar dinners than Jerry
Goodman, owner of Jerri's Tobacco Shop downtown (see Resource Guide). "In
four years, we've done about 18 dinners," Goodman says.  "Now, we have them
monthly, for about 50 people each time, and I'm getting calls from all sorts
of restaurants that want to do cigar dinners."
        ..."More and more, cigar smokers are younger people in their 20s and
30s," says Jimmy Yeager, general manager of Aspen's Caribou Club, a famous,
cigar friendly hangout in smoke-wary Aspen.  "And it's not a men's club
anymore, either.  We have quite a few women who enjoy a good smoke."

Hi Steve,

This is just a note to say thanks again for the great job you're doing
with the Pipes Digest and to offer a potential swap to our cyberspace
colleagues. I recently received a new Peterson pipe as a gift from a
friend who knows I'm a pipe smoker, but isn't familiar with my
personal likes/dislikes in the style and shape of pipes. He is
perceptive enough to the potential for such foibles to exist however,
because in the card that he sent with the pipe he said "if you don't
like the shape, swap it for one you like". Well..... I'm not too
partial to the shape - its' the Hudson, the second pipe in the new
Peterson Sherlock Holmes 7-day commemorative set. The pipe is a smooth
finished squat bulldog with a wide sterling silver band on the diamond
shaped shank. The band bears the profile of Holmes along with the
normal silver hallmarks as required by Irish law. The briar is
beautiful - tight swirly grain. I really wish I liked the shape
because its' a darn nice pipe, but I'm partial to full bents or
Canadians.  I talked to Bob Hamlin about it and he recommended I
mention it here. Bob says the MSRP for the pipe is $190. I'd be
willing to swap for another Peterson in a similar range or perhaps
some other good make. I'd even be up for swapping for a presmoked pipe
or pipes to come somewhere close to a fair trade value wise. Maybe Rex
or Nikos or one of the more active collectors would be interested, or
perhaps someone just looking for a very nice pipe for him/herself. The
pipe is new and unsmoked and comes in the Peterson gift box with all
the paperwork and even includes a chamois pipe bag. How about it
fellow pipe smokers - anyone interested???  Steve - if this is too
long winded, please feel free to snip at will&lt;ggg&gt;.  Regards to all,
Bob

<a name="25">Subject: intro for PD</a>

As per the local custom, I'd like to introduce myself here....

I'm one of those people who went from nonsmoker to pipe smoker.  Various
friends in high school and college smoked pipes, andthough I was always
vaguely intrigued, I was somehow reluctant to give it a try; perhaps because
of the usual cultural baggage about "that's for grownups" meaning "people
older than whatever age I happened to be at the moment."  About five years
ago, I was hanging out with a friend who was contentedly puffing away, and
when I commented on the pleasant aroma, he offered me a puff, and as they
say, the rest is history.  Pipe tobak was one of those things, like
chocolate, which was an instant *Yes!* from the first taste.  

Shortly thereafter I picked up a decent mid-priced briar and started
exploring where my tastes would lead me.  For a while I smoked Captain
Black, but I was curious about expanding the horizon and finding out what
else was out there.  Eventually I stopped by Sherlock's Haven in San
Francisco (which used to be located next to where the computer hackers'
social gatherings were held) and picked up a few samples of different
blends.  

At this point I smoke various aromatics &amp; Cavendishes, in particular the
ever-popular Lane 1-Q and something I get in NYC from Barclay-Rex called
Alkazar (anyone here know what's in it?); lately have added a couple more to
the regular menu.  Still haven't been able to develop the taste for English
blends, though I'm always open to suggestions (and will follow up on those
which folks here have sent via email).  Admittedly my tastes run toward the
sweet and away from the sharp or bitter.

My preferences in pipes tend toward unstained/unvarnished briar, notably
Peterson Seconds and the pipes of the Connoisseur Shop in NYC (every time
I'm out East I stop in there &amp; buy one or two).  I also have a taste for
estate pipes, and have even found some good ones (by recognised makers) at
local flea markets; a bit of reconditioning work and they're usually
perfectly good.  Lately I've had a tendency to move from medium-sized to
larger bowls, which afford a greater opportunity for the flavor of the tobak
to develop and last.  By now I have between 25 and 30 pipes altogether, and
buy when the mood strikes me or I see something interesting which might not
be around for long.

Smoking a pipe is for me one of those rare things in life which brings
sensual and intellectual enjoyment together.  The aroma and taste of the
tobak, the warmth of a good briar in hand, the contemplative sense of
relaxed thoughtfulness... Some of my best ideas have come in those moments.
Like eating good chocolate (or for that matter taking a relaxed shower or
bike ride), smoking a pipe is an excellent way to let the mind clear and get
in the mood for creative projects and brainstorming sessions.  It's all the
better when shared, though fellow chocolate lovers seem far more numerous
than fellow pipe smokers.  The few times I've worked on a project (business
planning, etc.) with someone who shares both the taste for chocolate and for
pipe tobak, have been incredible: a meeting of minds in a spirit of shared
enjoyment and shared purpose, which sets the tone, and objectively gets more
done, better, faster, and with pleasure. (I guess another part of that is,
working with someone with whom I have a lot in common, or a few key things
in common anyway, is an incredible motivator.)  Finally, in an age of
transience and obsolescence, the pipe is a symbol of permanence; one of
those rare artifacts which a person may easily keep for a lifetime.  

I'm 34, which I guess puts me on the younger end of the spectrum here
(anyone else in their 20s and 30s care to write...?).  I live in Berkeley
CA, which despite whatever controversial publicity it may get from time to
time, is a place where free debate flourishes, new ideas are always welcome,
and the local officials can at least be trusted to be honest.  

I work in telecom consulting, network design, and implementation, in a small
firm which I founded and is now incorporated as employee-owned (which BTW is
a great motivator for my coworkers).  Fortunately, I'm free to enjoy my
pipes during the work day, with minor limits for obvious reasons of mutual
respect (i.e. not in closed vehicles etc.).  I'm also involved in various
projects in sustainable economics and enterprise development.  

After hearing vague rumors, one night I did a keyword search and found the
newsgroup and PD.  It's been wonderful reading; I've learned a few things,
and finally feel like there's a group of people to share discussions of one
of life's great pleasures.

Another news item, unrelated but good news in any case: Santa Barbara CA
repealed its tough anti-smoking ordinance today, on the basis that it was
driving business to neighboring cities.  Bar owners, restaurant owners, and
others were supporting the repeal.  "One down, hundreds more to go..."

Now in all fairness, this doesn't mean stop visiting your favorite eating
place until any local ordinance is repealed.  If the owners are supportive,
they deserve our patronage and mutual support in repealing prohibitionist
ordinances.  Work together, get results.

A while back, someone posted to the digest asking
the whereabouts of a San Francisco Bay area
pipe maker named Andre.

Purely by chance, I ran into someone who knows him.
I was smoking my pipe outside at work, and a contract
illustrator in our group struck up a conversation
with me about pipes. One thing led to another and I found
out she knew "Andre."

It turns out that the "Andre" business is now run by Andre's

<a name="28">Subject: Price of Cubans in Canada</a>

I may or may not be up in Vancouver, BC in the near future,
but I thought I'd plan ahead and investigate tobacconists
in that city.

I checked the Resource Guide and found mention of
Clarkes R.J., Tobacconist in Vancouver (at 3 Alexander St.).
I telephoned them and asked about prices of various Cuban
cigars. To my shock, they wanted over $20 CN for a Montecristo #2.
(I think it was $22 CN.) They are selling Romeo Y Julieta
coronas for about $15 CN.

I asked if there was a recent price increase, and the person
I spoke with said "no, those have been the prices for
about two years now." I can't believe it. When I was in
Edmonton, Alberta about 15 months ago I picked up four
Montecristo #2s for about $12 CN each. I remember thinking
*that* was expensive. (They were definitely Cuban, too, not
knock-offs. "Habana" on the band, very distinctive taste.
Wonderful cigars.)

Can anyone shed some light on this? Is Clarkes in Vancouver
simply out of line on price, or have the prices on Cuban
cigars gone up over 80% in 15 months, or was the shop in
Edmonton giving me a total bargain?

Thanks,

Greetings Steve. Excellent job as usual on the last PD. Thought members
might be interested in the following:
 
The past two weeks I've been on a combination business/pleasure trip which
took me from CT to Key Largo FL. Along the way, had some experiences which
might interest fellow Digesters. Stopped in JR's in Selma, NC and purchased
a few each of the new JR Alternative brand cigars touted to be
"counterfeits" of the best Cuban brands. Bought them all as close a match as
to size as I could (Churchills) and after careful reflection, I won't do it
again. The "robust hearty" flavor was totally missing. Mild to the point of
boring. This was an across-the-board impression and the type of cigar being
imitated did not seem to make a difference. Also bought a tin of McBaren's
burley blend which smells a lot tastier in the tin than it tastes when
smoked.
 
In Sarasota, stopped at Bennington Tobacconist, Inc., 5 Fillmore Dr./St.
Armands Key, Sarasota, FL 34236-1425 (800) 237-5074. In a charming village
with more Rolls' than Rodeo Dr., this is a pleasant surprise. Pipes and
tobacco are _affordable_ and worth the trip. Shop had a surprising number of
Churchwardens on display, as well as their own made-in-France line of
acrylic mouthpiece briars which run about $35. A large selection of
Petersons and Jobeys as well as a goodly number of Wilkes were on display.
The real surprise was in the tobacco which they claim they hand blend. Fell
in love with their No. 05 English Luxury, a blend of burley, Virginia ribbon
and Latakia (just a touch). Tastes great, smokes cool and smells nice to be
around. Some of their aromatics would be a surprise to most--Coffee, Swiss
Chocolate and Strawberry Daiquiri are some flavors/blends available. Large
selection of cigars in every price range too. Picked up a nice little Jobey
for a knock-around pipe; price was too good to pass up and the pipe
looks/smokes well.
 
In Key Largo, looked in at the Caribbean Cigar Store, approx. mile marker
108 on US 1. Can't miss the place--large skull and crossbones painted on the
window over the legend "Cigarettes Kill". Wide selection of Dominican and
Jamaican cigars. Most pleasant surprise: Stopped for lunch at the Quay
restaurant, Mile Marker 102 Key Largo. After a fresh mahi-mahi filet
sandwich and Red Label Jamaican beer, pulled out a Hoya "Presidente", a
large cigar. One of the waiters came running up to me _to offer a light for
it_. OK, I _was_ dining on the pier but this was such a pleasant surprise
after having someone in my hometown bitch about my cigar _in the smoking
section of a cocktail lounge_ (yep, that's where they were sitting too;
wonder what they thought the ashtrays were for).
 
Keep up the good work.

The Tobacco Museum in North Carolina sells small packets of tobacco

small).  Don't have their address or know if they would sell by mail but 
will research it if you like.  The museum is very interesting, located in

The kind of pipes rustic and sandblast are those I like more than smooths.
The mixture I smoke is a blend whit italian tobacco (named Golf) and
"Cimette di Brissago" (are the head of Toscano cigars when they are

Okay this will be tricky, my medical English is quite poor but I'll 
give it a try: Neil A Garra wrote about benificial effects of smoking 
on migraines. My wife suffers from migraines and smoking to her has 
oposite effects. 
As far as my knowledge reaches migraine is a swelling of the veins in 
the brain as a reaction to an initial contraction. And as far (again) 
as my knowledge go's, smoking _can_ have a vein contracting 
propperty. So, when the veins _are_ wide (i.e. you suffer form a 
migraine attac), smoking may have a positive effect on the migraine. 
But smoking _can_ also have the oposite effect (or in fact a 
combination)  widening the veins even further, like drinking alcohol. 

So IMHO there is no rule like smoking helps against migraines. If it 
works for you, great, but chances are probably equaly in favour of 
getting more sick than you where, you'll have to decide if it's worth 
the try...

High time to send in an introductory post.  I'm a 49 year old mediator
in Central Florida who's been smoking a pipe for a long, long time.
Most of my pipes were inherited from my father, who was God's gift 
to Alfred Dunhill.  My tobacco consumption has covered all parts of
the spectrum, but I've been quite happy for a number of years with
the house blends at The Brass Pipe on U.S. 1 in Fort Pierce, Florida.
By domestic treaty my enjoyment of tobacco is limited to the great
outdoors.  Luckily, my home has a huge, covered second-floor veranda
on which I can sit and puff to my heart's content whenever the spirit
takes me.  I've been a Pipe Digest fan for four or five months now
and wish it a long and prosperous career on the net.  I'd very much
like to see more informational postings regarding national and inter-
national smoking characteristics (why does most continental tobacco
seem stale?  do folks over there like it that way?), commercial to-
bacco additives (what's the *real* skinny on drugstore tobacco - with
names, please) and historical anecdotes (how did churchwardens get
their start?  why don't people smoke them now?  what about clay
pipes?)  It's probable that many of these items have been covered

I am a new subscriber and thought I would make my entry after reading several
back issues on the Web Page.  I am really happjy to have discovered this
great place to use the new technology for the continuation of a very old and
ancient tradition: pipe smoking. 

I am actually a cigar smoker who has found that pipe smoking is a whole new
world of people who like the pleasure of the finer things in life, there is
nothing I enjoy more than being in the company of fellow afficianados and
having a smoke and some friendly conversation. I am 43 years old and have
been smoking cigars for about six years. I am like many others in that I was
attracted to pipes at an early age would it not have been for a cigarette
habit that took years to quit I would have become a cigar or pipe smoker
earlier. 

I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and am grateful for many of the fine
tobacco establishments we have in this area.  I have enthusiastically
followed the recent trend toward cigar friendly establishments.  Places like
the British Bankers Club are ,I hope, a trend that will ultimately result in
places where the Pipe and Cigar smoking public can enjoy eachothers company.
With the current political climate this may take some doing.  My idea of a
perfect place to smoke is a casual, comfortable, club which may also be a
tobacconists shop. I would like to support an establishment if it were in my
home town. 

The Tobacconist that helped me get started with pipes is not on your list as
far as I can tell.

                   415 941 1228
 
Jim Beardsly who has returned as the store manager is a very knowledgable
gentleman who patiently helped me with my first pipe selection. He got me
started with a wonderful Cavindish Blend that he blended himself ( J B Blend
)   This is the friendly small tobacconist that gives our passtime a good
name.  There are a couple of chairs in the store where you can sit and sample
a bowlful and enjoy the company. 

Thats probably enough for now.  Thanks for making this Digest such a great
place to visit.

[PIPE] Couple of items... the new issue of the Ephemeris and the
permiere issue of Pipe Friendly both arrived in the mail this
week. Tom Dunn included a nice writeup of the Digest near the front of
the Ephemeris. Haven't had a chance yet to do more than skim them, but
it's on my queue!

And, as summer approaches (here in the northern hemisphere, anyway),
stretch out in your favorite hammock, pour yourself something tall and
cool, and light up with us...

Hello Steve and Company....

I've just started to browse my first issue of Pipes Digest and I am very 
excited.  It's great to see fellow lovers of the leaf out there in large 
numbers.

A bit of background... I am 23 years old and have been smoking cigars and 
pipes for the last five years or so. In general, I do prefer pipes, but 
it's really a mood thing for me.  I am a journalism student at San 
Francisco State and I work part time at Sherlock's Haven, a pipe and 
cigar store in San Francisco.  (It's a tough life, you know. :))

As far as favorite smokes go...

Pipes: I like big bowled pipes (i.e. 2 hr plus smokes).  I would say that 
my favorite pipe maker these days is Paul Perri, a retired craftsman in 
southern california, who makes high quality pipes at a low price because 
he does it for enjoyment.

Pipe Tobacco:  I flip between aromatics and virginias.  (Latakia gives me 
the head spins)  Right now I am smoking my ragular aromatic, which isLane 
RLP-6.  At Sherlock's, it goes by the name Black Jack and it is very 
similar to Dunhill's my mixture A20,000, if that helps.  As my treat 
tobaccos, I smoke St. Bruno Flake (Virginia), Butera Blended Flake 
(virginia) and Butera Sweet Cavendish.

Cigars: Amomg Domestically available smokes, I really enjoy Paul 
Garmirian Bellicosos.  From the land of Cuba, although with some caution, 
I love Romeo and Jullietta Churchills.  (Although I just ran into three 
Monte Christo Pyramids, so this may change.)

Just from my browsing of the list so far, it seems that we are all in the 
same boat as far as the anti smoking hysteria, so I look forward to 
comiserating.  But more importantly, I look forward to talking about good 
smokes.

In the leaf we trust,

Chris Freud

<a name="3">Subject: Early Morning Pipe</a>

Re: Jacco van Muiswinkel's post about englishes and Early Morning pipe.

I can think of two possibilities of why the early morning didn't agree 
with you.

1)Maybe Early Morning, the blend itself just doesn't agree with you.  I 
would try another english blend.  Who knows? You may like the new blend 
and your problem is solved

2)You may not react well to latakia.  I for one am among that rank.  I 
have smoked Early Morning, 965, Nightcap, other Lane Englishes and 
Esoterica blends and I just get the spins.  Not all toboacco is right for 
everyone and englishes certainly aren't for me.

On that vein... have other people have similar reaction to different 
styles of tobaccos?  I have found that I enjoy virginias and aromatics, 
whereas some of my fellows smokers get the spins when smoking virginias 
or can't stand the chemicals in some aromatics.

Thoughts?

In the leaf we trust,

Chris Freud

Tim-

I have a friend who just came back from Europe with two full boxes of 
relabeled Cohibas so it is quite common practice. One just has to be 
extremely careful from whom you buy your cuban cigars whether it be in 
the US (there 10 million cubans a year in the US) or abroad.  There are a 
lot of fraud artists out there willing to take advantage of the 
undiscriminating buyer.

I read in #189 that there is some kind of shortage of water pipes. Well I
live in San Fracisco and there is water pipes of all sorts. Old, new, big,
small, just about anything you can think of. I think it is due mainly due to
the fact that the hippies like to smoke marijuana in them because it burns so
hot. If anyone is intrested e-mail me with a discription of what you are
looking for and I'll check it out. most likely I can just provide you with
name and number of the shop for you to just order it and have them send it to
you. If they do not ship I would be more than happy to do it for you, free of
charge.

<a name="6">Subject: Alfred Baier, pipemaker</a>

Dear Steve,
  I spent a week in Vermont this February, and happened upon a nice fellow who 
makes pipes in the town of Manchester.  My friend and I were driving down the
road on our way to a museum one morning, and my eye caught a sign with the
shape of a pipe on it that read "pipemaker" and "Butternut Lane" which was
just ahead.  
  Turning onto the snowy road, we managed our way down to another sign in
front of a small shop emblazoned with the telltale pipe shape.   Through the
frosty window we could see a bearded fellow clad in a worn apron with clouds
of smoke billowing from a freehand bent clenched tightly in his teeth.  It was 
Alfred Baier, the pipemaker known for his unusual carvings in briar.   What a
treat this was for me, as I had just completed my fourth handcarved pipe, and
had never met another pipemaker, much less expect to find one by accident a
thousand miles from my Louisiana home!  We were greeted at the door by a
friendly Mrs. Baier who escorted us through the house and into the pipe shop.  
Alfred peered up from a pipe he was staining and welcomed us.   His showed us
samples of his carvings and preliminary drawings he had done for an upcoming
job as well as photos of earlier works.  Basically, the fellow will carve just 
about anything you can imagine in briar!  His shop was cluttered with
machinery and hand tools -- tools of the pipemaker's trade.  We stayed about
45 minutes with him and then headed back on the road to our museum
destination.  Had we not been pressed for time I certainly would have stayed
longer.   If anyone is interested in obtaining a hand carved pipe -- a
one-of-a-kind pipe with animal head, portraits, ect., you can contact Alfred
Baier at Butternut Lane, PO Box 2043, Manchester, VT, 05255.  You won't meet a 
nicer fellow anywhere.

Steve: In the Digest Kameran Kashani asked if he was getting ripped off 
on Cubans at $20-$22 Canadian. I just got back from Hong Kong and the 
larger Cohibas were going for $25 US whilte the smaller sizes were going 
for $20US. I checked prices at the Davidoff store in the Peninsula and 
the Coiba Divan in the Oriental and both were the same. Regards, John

Steve, You may have already received a post about this, if so, feel 
free to delete it (I didnt get a chance to read all of #182).  Several 
members of Alt.Smokers.Cigars started having IRC chat sessions every 
Saturday afternoon at 2 P.M. EDT.  What started as a few people has 
grown to the point that just about any night of the week the chat line 
is going with at least 3-4 people.  The channel is #cigarsmokers.  We 
have also started a channel on Undernet in hopes of making it 
permanent.  Discussion runs rampant from cigars to pipes to politics to 
computers.  I have made several cyberspace friends in this forum.  I 
would welcome anyone to our chat sessions, or invite someone to 
organize a #pipesmokers chat conference.  BTW, there are directions on 
how to access the chat channels on the Fuji web page.

Can't organize a regular #pipesmokers chat session just now, but
perhaps one of our other members would like to take the initiative. -S. ]

<a name="9">Subject: Underage Smokers</a>

Dear Steve:
           I noted in your most recent issue that posts from or
about underage pipe smokers (15 years in the last issue) are 
still being presented.  So far as I know, in most states it's 
against the law to sell tobacco to young folk under 18.  While 
I'm well aware that many are irritated by the present tendency 
to anti-smoking legislation, the underage tobacco sales ban is 
generally agreed to be a good thing: people should be well on
their way to being adults before deciding whether or not to be-
come smokers.  Accordingly, just as you regulate other appearances 
in the pages of Pipes Digest, I'd strongly suggest your excluding 
and/or discouraging posts from or directed towards underage smokers.  

Regards,

Bob

[ You're correct; it's against the law to sell tobacco to a minor.
The Digest doesn't encourage breaking the law.  However, IMHO, people
grow up at different times.  It really ought to be the decision of the
parent or guardian.

Anyway, I'm not going to change the Digest's policy to include such
discussions as a censorable item. Though I would discourage underage
smokers from trying to use the Digest to cadge tobak.  I'd rather see
them consult their parents on this. -S. ]

To Steve and all the others who can read this.

Hello,

nice to meet you.

Sorry, that i answered so late to your
newsgruop, but i am in the middle of
my 'Vordiplom', i am a physik student and
it is a verry hard job in the moment.

I am very new in this stuff of communication.
So i simply replied to your message.
I hope that this is the right way to post
a statement in your corner.
I am a new member of the club of pipe smokers.
I am from Frankfurt, Germany, so please excuse my bad 
pronounciation.

I have two problems here in germany the
industrie thougt that they only be able to sell
pipes with the 9mm Filter in, and what do you think
about this.
How many of you use pipes with a filter in it.

Here in germany we had a new tobacco from
danmark, it is ORLIK CLUB and it tastes
very good.

I had a further problem, during the smoking a pipe
the temperature of this pipe gets rather high,
how does profis in pipe smoking handle this?

If somebody out there can give me a good answer
i will be happy for it.

With friendly wishes
		M.Brandstetter

[ [ Re the filterless pipes, how about just pulling the filter out?
(Or can't they be pulled out?) Re getting hot, it's probably caused by
puffing too fast, improper packing, or tobak that's too dry or too
wet.  Experiment, and find the cause. And welcome! -S. ]

Steve!

Thanks for the welcome. Good to meet fellow pipe smokers on the
Net - here in Norway the Pipes smoker is a lonely hobby.

I am a Norwegian, 51 years - been smoking since the summer of
1968 but I started with mild tobaccos and low priced pipes (starting
out carefully...) and so it took half a year before I bought a good pipe
(all or nothing!) and a stronger tobacco (Three Nuns) and discovered that
this was good. 

So since then I have been a regular. Have ca 30 pipes - major part of the
collection is Stanwell who constantly surprise me with their selection
of pipes that are beautiful, good to smoke and reasonably priced. I have also
some "Larsen" pipes - Norwegian brand now made in Denmark. Excellent
products.

I buy most of my pipes travelling - especially in Copenhagen. Ah - the joys
and frustration of "Stroeget" - the main shopping street  in the center
of town and with  some ofe the best tobacco shops. All those beautiful pipes
displayed there! And the supreme frustration that I cannot have them all
- my purse is too shallow, my life is to short, my mouth is too little!

Favourite tobaccos are still Three Nuns and (my main favorite) 
St Bruno Flake. Mick McQaid was a third, but here in Norway
we only get the ready rubbed version. Not for me! Occasionally
I get the MMcQ from Smith Snuff shop in London in the square cut.
Much better.

Prices for tobacco is here in Norway about 80 kr for 50 grams -
that is about 13 USD or 7.5 GBP.

Smoke well!

<a name="12">Subject: Countdown started/Pipestone info.</a>

Hello again, all--

A couple things to pass on since last I wrote-- 1) Countdown to
liftoff--Pipes Digest, reporter at large and 2) some more info. from the
gratious people of the Pipes Digest:

My X-Country Excursion to Start Soon:
I got a canopy on the truck yesterday, I have a housesitter lined up.  I just
need to prepay a few bills, get my dog settled in at my folks house, get the
housesitter squared away and then I'm ready to load the truck and head out!
 Periodic updates to the PD will begin soon after!  In the meantime, I've
gotten more great letters of encouragement and offers to stop in and visit,
and places to spend a night.  Things are shaping up nicely!

I also have a HP200LX palmtop computer which I plan to keep with me at all
times.  I should be able to take "on location" notes while job hunting, and
(more importantly :) while visiting pipe stops, which can be uploaded to the
portable computer that I'll bring with me.  Then, I'll hook the modem up when
I come close to phonelines and power, and send you updates as I can.

In case I didn't say it before, I'm hoping that I'll be able to stay in close
enough touch with the Steve and the Pipes Digest crew so that as I come into
a region of the country that might have a particularly interesting stop, that
I can be alerted by the PD readers and change course so that I can attempt to
make a visit and report back.  The beauty of this trip (I hope), will be that
I don't HAVE to be in any particular place at any particular time.  If a
place sounds promising, I'll check it out.

PipeStones and Exotic Equipment:
I got a great letter from James Lawson that was real interesting, so I wanted
to share the great story he wrote to me.  He originally wrote me about the
pipe stones I was interested in, but also talks about some other interesting
experiences later of how he was able to talk, over the phone, with the author
of "The Ultimate Pipe Book":

---------- Portions of James' letter follow -------------
 ...He sold me a piece of equipment that was written about and pictured in his
book.  He threw in a whole case of EricsKeystones along with the piece of
equipment I inquired about, at no extra charge.  I was gratified.

I have been very pleased with the Keystones.  I smoke nearly every type of
pipe tobacco - even the aromatics.  As you know, the aromatics burn wet.  The
Keystones work quite well, IMHO.

As far as I know, the stones are not available in this country.  They come
from Denmark, a lovely country that I have visited many times.  I will
certainly try to access more Keystones on my next visit.

Hope this interests you,

James Lawson (aka BriarPipes)

To	JCJEWELL

Hi again, Charlie,

The piece of equipment I alluded to in Hacker's book was the Pipeking.  This
machine cleans one's briar pipes if used properly.

I'll briefly describe it.  The unit has a small electric motor mounted on it.
There is an adjustable clip which holds the pipe by its stem.  The mouthpiece
of the pipe is inserted into a flexible, rubber hose that is attached to the
motor housing.  To clean one's pipe, you fill the bowl with the cleaning
solution provided (grain alcohol will work).  You then turn the motor on,
ensuring that there is a clean filter in the motor.  Within minutes the pipe
is drained of the cleaning solution and ready for the pipe cleaner swabbing.
I have found that this unit, though noisy, is quite effective.  Hacker wrote
in his book that the Pipeking is also useful for accelerating the browning of
meerschaum pipes.  I have had less success with this purpose.  

Rick Hacker was very pleasant to me on the phone when I called him about the
Pipeking.  We agreed on a price for the very Pipeking that he photographed in
the 2nd edition of his pipe book.  Once I mailed him a check he shipped the
unit right out (along with the EricsKeystones I mentioned earlier).  He wrote
me a handwritten letter on his personalized stationery that features his
likeness in a cartoon form.  Very nice.

When I'm not using the Pipeking, I keep it on my desk in the office.  It sits
next to my pipe tobacco humidor and an antique oil lamp.  It is an
interesting conversation piece when people see it.   ...

---------- End of James' excerpts --------------

So, if anyone out there knows of a place that has the pipestones that James
talked about, (check your local tobacco shop--mine didn't have them!), I, and
I'm sure others, wouldn't mind knowing where to get them.

Type to you all later -- Thanks, Steve.  You've heard it before, but hear it
again:  You do a great job of administering the pipes mailing list!

Steve,

While I was living in France, I picked up a brochure in a pipe shop.  It is
put out by Ch. CORRIEU.  It is in French but I will attempt to offer an
adequate translation.  NOTE!  I do not pretend to be a French-language
scholar.  Also, I will by necessity omit the obligatory accent markings in
the French text.  Hope this doesn't offend any French-speaking members.

LES 7 REGLES DU FUMEUR DE PIPE
(The 7 rules of the pipe smoker)

1.  Pour fumer une pipe neuve: Les 5 premieres fois, remplissez votre pipe au
tiers.  Les 5 fois suivantes, remplissez-la a moitie.  Fumez toujours votre
pipe completement.
(Trans.  In smoking a new pipe: the first five times, fill your pipe one
third of the way.  The next five times fill it half-way.  Always smoke your
pipe completely.)

2.  Bourrez votre pipe par petites quantites en tassant bien le tabac, sans
toutefois lui faire perdre son elasticite.
(Trans.  Fill your pipe with small quantities of tobacco and tamp it without
losing its springiness.)

3.  Fumez tranquillement, par larges boufees, pour ne pas surchauffer le
fourneau.  Fumer par petits coups precipites echauffe la fumee et donne un
gout acre.
(Trans.  Smoke slowly, with long puffs so that you don't overheat the bowl.
 If you smoke with small and fast puffs you heat the smoke and render a
bitter taste.)

4.  Si, en allument votre pipe, le tabac fait des "boucles", retassez-le et
allumez de nouveau.  N'oubliez pas que le tabac doit bruler sur toute sa
surface.  
(Trans.  If the tobacco rises when you light your pipe, tamp it again and
relight it.  Remember that the tobacco must burn over its entire surface.)

5.Rien n'est plus important qu'un bon tirage.  Il vaut mieux vider une pipe
qui tire mal et la bourrer de nouveau, plutot que de fumer une pipe qui
"gargouille".
(Trans.  A right draw is most important.  You should empty a bad-drawing pipe
and refill it, rather than smoke a "gurgling" one.)

6.  Nettoyez regulierement votre pipe avec un cure-pipe.  Enlevez aussi les
debris de tabac et de cendres qui restent au fond, pour etre sur de fumer
"sec".
(Trans.  Consistently clean your pipe with pipe cleaners.  You should remove
the dottle and ashes, that remain in the bowl, so as not to smoke dry. (?))

7.  Si vous avez l'habitude de fumer une pipe apres l'autre, mieux vaut en
avoir plusieurs et les utiliser a tour de role.  Une pipe doit etre
completement refroidie pour etre digne de recevoir un bon tabac.
(Trans.  If you typically smoke several pipefuls you should own several pipes
and alternate them.  A pipe deserves a good tobacco, only after it has
cooled.)

There.  I think I have the basic idea that is intended.  If  members see any
glaring errors - let me know.  Please use English.  I was more extensively
trained in Latin and classical Greek than French, so forgive any
mistranslation.

Next week I hope to submit the short remainder of the brochure which
describes "the pipe-smoking man".

<a name="16">Subject: When a Stogie becomes a Cigar...Reprint from Toronto Star</a>

This article was published in the Toronto Star, dated May 15th 1995 by staff
reporter Bob Brent, and is retyped without permission with apologies to the
author.
When a Stogie becomes a Cigar...
You might say he has money to burn.
The lowly stogie was raised to exultant heights last night as a Texas real
estate investor bid a combined $29,000 US (about $40,000 Can.) for two boxes
of rare Cuban cigars signed by Fidel Castro himself.
In all, five boxes of Castro's very own Trinidad brand were sold for a total
of $63,000 US, with the money going to Cuban medical relief, as stipulated
by the Cuban leader.
Another $25,000 US was raised for the Variety Village of Ontario to help
physically disabled children
The evening was a love-in for cigar afficionados, who revelled in the thick
cloud of smoke that carpeted a second floor ballroom, obscuring their
revelry as it spilled into the hallways of the Four Seasons Hotel (Toronto).
Each course in the elegant meal was separated by one of four cigar
"interludes", each featuring a differnt brand, including the Cohiba
Espledidos selling at $1,100 a box.
High bidder Eric Brauss was upstaged by actress Whoopi Goldberg, in town
shooting the movie "Bogus", who took home the final batch of Trinidads with
a bid of $9,000 US.
Goldberg consented to having her picture taken with the treasured tocacco
but was mum with reporters.
Brauss, 52, said he was happy to help a good cause while adding to his
collection of rare cigars and bottles of Port wine."I think I'll break down
somewhere (and smoke one)," he told reporters. "It's relaxing...just very
relaxing."
When he does decide to light one up, it will likely be north of the border.
It's illegal under a 30-year-old trade embargo to bring Cuban goods into the
United States.
No problem, said Brauss, who moved to Dallas five years ago from Windsor,
Ontario, where he maintains his collection in a humidor.
Auction organizer Marc Tansy, operations manager for Havana House Cigar &amp;
Tobacco Merchants Ltd., said the U.S. embargo has established Canada as a
"mecca" for American cigar smokers.
While tobacco is grown throughout the Caribbean, Cuba's rich acidic soil
gives the leaves a unique and strong flavour that is unsurpassed, he said.
Tassy described the Trinidads made from leaves selected from the best of
Cuba's tobacco in the Laguito region, as "an absolute rarity," unavailable
for sale.
Cuban leader Castro - oncw known for an ever present cigar clenched in his
fist - has sworn off alcohol and tobacco, but still has the Trinidads made
for him alone, Tassy said.
Each box of 50 Trinidads bore Castro's signature and the date May 3rd 1995.
Havana House was expected to lose money on the $500-a-ticket event which
drew about 140 guests.
Among the up-front costs: about $200 a person for food and liquor with
another $200 a person covering the inter-meal cigar breaks.
Tassy was less willinf to divulge the cost of one other expense on the
evening: a dozen or so young woman models who were hired to attend the event
to - in his words - "break the ice."
"On an evening like this, you end up with a bunch of men sitting at a table
staring at each other," he said.
"There's nothing more boring than a bunch of men sitting at a table staring
at each other."
Actress Kirstie Alley caused a stir, entering the ballroom in a rented
vintage gown on the arm of husband Parker Stevenson. "I know nothing about
cigars execpt that my husband smokes them," she deadpanned. "I've never been
to a smoke - that's what you call this, isn't it ? - but it's very...smoky."

(Again, thanks to Star Staff reporter Bob Brent, for covering the event...GF)

  OFFICE MEMO         [Cigar] An Introductory Cigar         Date:  5/17/95

Top of the day to you, cigar afficianados!  I have just signed on to Digest
and I thought I might introduce myself; perhaps I might even give you pause to
smile.  I am what you might call a "Saturday Night Cigar Smoker."  About three
months ago, I turned to my girlfriend and said, "Wouldn't it be grand to sit
outside on Saturday night, listen to jazz and blues on the radio, sip some
Scotch and smoke a cigar?"  The idea was absolutely titillating!

So, when Saturday came around, we both strolled into the local tobacco shop
and walked right up to the young man at the counter.  "Sir, we are in the
market for an introductory cigar.  We have never partaken of this particular
pleasure, but this evening we plan on sitting down, listening to jazz and
blues on the radio, sip some Scotch and smoke our very first cigar.  Perhaps
you would be so kind as to make a recommendation?"  Needless to say, the man
behind the counter looked at me like I had four heads!  And then WHAM! he was
off and running in his pitch.

"Now, for an introductory cigar, introductory mind you, you might want to
consider some of these Fuentes, but if you're going to be sipping Scotch maybe
you want to consider a darker cigar, but the jazz and blues twist brings us
right around to (and here he reaches into a box) these Macanudos."  And out he
pulls a huge cigar and my eyes just light up.  "Yes sir, this will give you
several hours of complex yet smooth enjoyment."  He pauses like all great
actors, savoring the taste in his mind.

"Well good.  We'll take two."  And my girlfriend and I walked out with
purchases in hand.  That night we smoked our first cigars (Macanudo Prince
Phillips) while listening to the radio and downing a bottle of Knockandoo
Scotch.  I seemed to enjoy the experience more than she did, which is the
reason why I am tap-tapping on my keyboard at this moment.  Bye for now.

[ Well, both are acquired tastes... -S. ]

Re: Santa Barbara Smoking reversal....

Earlier in the week, the San Francisco Comical ran a story saying that 
Santa Clara County (fifty miles south of San Francisco) is considering 
repealing its strict ordinance against smoking in restaurant and some 
bars.  Apparently local merchants have seen their business drop by 25 
percent.  I'm so happy to see smokers talking with their wallets.  
Unfortunately we can't fight the anti-smoking movement with logic, but 
we can with our wallets.  Of course, the anti-smoking groups are starting to 
get worried that other counties will be coming to their senses.

  The same problems 
that Santa Clara Restraunteurs are encountering in San Francisco, where 
there is no smoking in restaurants and where smoking in bars will be 
banned at the end of the year.  SF restaurants have seen a bit of a drop 
off in business but have encountered another problem: lack of table 
turnover.  Customers have been stepping out during dinner to have a 
smoke, which has extended the time that a table is occupied per party.  
Instead opf getting in three seatings per table a night, restaurant are 
getting two.

Keep on talking with your wallet, people.  Support establishments which 
allow smoking and avoid those that don't.  It is working.

Re: Possible Pipe Magazine/ Cigar Afficianado rant

I would like to see a "Cigar Afficianado" type magazine for pipes, BUT, I 
really would hope it would stay away from that magazine's inane rating 
system.

First... CA compares apples and oranges in its testing.  In its recent 
tasting of churchills, it compared a Cuban Romeo and Jullietta and a 
Macanudo.  The only thing those two cigars have in common is their size.  
If you like a light cigar, the Macanudo is a 90, while the Romeo and 
Julliet is a 50, because that sucker is going to make you throw up.  If 
you like a heavy smoke, as I do, then the Romeo is superb and the 
Macanudo is a waste of my time.  Long story short, the CA taster's taste 
in cigars has as much of an influence in the ratings as the cigar itself.
I really wouldn't want to see a pipe magazine rating aromatics and 
englishes in the same tasting.  Yikes!

Second... What's in a number?  Most of the tastings have a few cigars 
over ninety and then a whole bunch in the 80s.  Can you honnestly tell me 
the difference between a cigar that's rated an 85 and one that's an 87?

Third... While CA has done wonders for the cigar industry, its rating 
have turned smoking into a real status thing.  The store I work at had La 
Gloria Cubanas and Licenciados for years and no one bought them (This 
is not to say they're not good cigars.  I like la glorias).  CA 
gave them a fancy rating and we haven't been able to stock them since.  
Some people in the industry do consider good ratings a curse for this 
reason.
  
The testings are good in that they tell people what's out there.  I don't 
have a problem if you see a cigar with a high rating and you want to try 
it.  By all means.  But, don't like a cigar because it got a nice 
number.  Like it because you enjoy the taste, contrsuction, draw, etc...

But getting back to the point... While I would like to see an increase in 
pipe smoking, I don't want to see what CA has done to the cigar industry 
to the pipe industry.  (I would bet you that if there were ratings on 
pipe tobacco, you would never see esoterica tobacco again... and lemme 
tell you that would tick me off.)

End rant....

<a name="23">Subject:   MANY THANKS!</a>

Greetings and Gratitude to you, Steve, for sending me my first issue. This
is a super media for me. I don't know very many people for whom
pipe-smoking and the things around it is a hobby and a love. Cigarettes was
a habit; my pipes are a totally different matter.

I began my love affair with pipes when I was in seminary in St. Paul, MN 25
years ago. There were so many pipe shops around back then and I tried to
make all of them regularly.

Early on I started smoking Edwards' Scottish Moor and in 25 years have
managed to move over to Edwards' Brandywine. Tried a lot of tobaccos, but
none grab my taste buds the way these two do. Occasionally I like a latakia
blend and prefer Tinder Box's Philosopher. Used to smoke a Charatan or Lane
Limited blend that came only in small tins back then; I think it was called
Crown Royale or something like that. Heavenly, but I haven't seen it in
years and never in bulk. It was expensive.

I still like Edwards pipes, of which I collected many, but have not bought
one in years. The only Edwards shop I know of in Texas is in Dallas, where
I get my tobacco. I have a number of Peterson's and Peterson Seconds (Irish
Seconds). I actually prefer the seconds for an all day smoke because the
system pipes get gooey after a couple of smokes and need a couple days
rest.

Yes, Edwards is a chain of stores. Not as many as there used to be. A
result, I am sure, of the anti-smoking lobby, as are many good
tobacconists. Down here we smokers often are made to feel like lepers for
enjoying a good smoke.

I suppose that is why it is so refreshing to make this connection. Thanks.

Hello Steve, and thank you for providing PD.

Those who are frequent readers of a.s.c. will know me as a Davidoff shill 
and all-around hack, but I have a darker side...

I'm also an undercover Customs agent!

JUST KIDDING!

I smoke a _very_ infrequent pipe.  Literally, less than once a month.  I 
enjoy it, and it does a nice job of masking the cigar smoke, but I prefer 
stogies.  Nonetheless, I do have a question or two:

1) Regarding the letter a few issues back from Jacco van Muiswinkel, who 
complained about Dunhill Early Morning making him sick.  I used to smoke a 
pipe much more frequently 3-4 years ago.  I just smoked aromatics, nothing 
fancy.  On a trip to Europe, however, I stopped at Dunhill's in London and 
picked up their sampler pack of 5-6 tins, including Early Morning.  I tried 
all the tins, and at least 3 or 4 made me quite nauseous.  Was my 
experience, as Jacco's, just a result of inexperience, or is there something 
more to it.  I am allergic to nuts, but I don't see how that would
factor in.... 

2) My two pipes (used to be three) were given to me by my grandfather, who 
has been smoking pipes for 50+ years.  They are "Parker" pipes (a 
"Tanglewood" and an "Avondale"); he says they he bought them at Dunhill's, 
but doesn't know any more.  Anyone know anything about the provenance of these?

Many, many thanks.

It's hard as heck to type when you're holding a cigar.

to quell those churning moments. She knows I smoke pipes and cigars and she
suggested I stay away from those for three weeks.

Anyone ever get an upset stomach from smoking? I don't think I ever have.
Because we don't inhale does some of that make it down the other pipe to
the stomach? Just wondering. I'm following her advice because I don't think
I'll get a stomach transplant anytime soon, but I'm puzzled just by that
part of the advice. I wonder if she was just trying to curb my smoking?

Steve,

I send you the address of Gimeno, the best pipe shop in Barcelona. This may
be helpful to any puffer visiting the city. They have an amazing variety of
pipes and pipe accesories, but they don*t sell tobacco. Actually, there is
another good shop also named Gimeno in "Les Rambles", a very well known
boulevard. This shop sells both pipes and tobacco, but has a lesser range of
pipes avilable. Both shops were part of a common business years ago, and it
seems that the old owner split his legacy between his sons when he died. Here
is the adress of the first shop, because I don*t know wich is the precise
addres of the second one:

                     Gimeno, Hogar del Fumador
                     Paseo de Gracia, 101
                     08008 Barcelona
                     Spain

                     Telephone: +34 3 237 20 78

Anybody interested should ask for Elena, the lady responsible for the pipe
department.

Besides this, to buy tobacco is quite easy in my country. We have a
governement owned monopoly for tobacco distribution that licenses many shops
to sell tobacco products. Those shops are generically called "estancos". You
will find available an acceptable range of pipe tobacco brands in any of
those "estancos" (in Spain scandinavian and dutch mixtures are preferred
rather than english ones). If you don't find what you want, then ask the
tobacconist to look in his catalog, and if it's there it will be available
the next day. But if your best loved tobacco is not in the catallog then just
forget it, because this means that this product is not being distributed by
the spanish monopoly.

That's all the help I can give. If I find any other good shops I will tell
you. Thanks for keeping the digest and good luck !

Ricard Pardell, from Barcelona.

<a name="2">Subject: &lt;swoosh&gt;..&lt;puff&gt;..&lt;swoosh&gt;..Ahh</a>

Hello, all. I'm a newcomer to the list, having read only two of
them. It's really a big deal to me to see so many people in love with
smoking pipes -- I still haven't met anyone who smokes pipes, or
cigars for that matter, on a regular basis.

I guess I should shed some background light..

I'm 20 years old and a few days, and have been smoking my pipe for
about a year. That should teach most of the people who think they're
in the young end of the spectrum! ;-) I work as sysadmin here at
Florida State University's Nuclear Physics Dept, and am going to
school to earn my BS in Computer Science, so that I can travel at my
whim and be assured of finding a good job waiting for me at the end of
the trail. I also want to keep studying, since my true interests don't
lie in CS: math, physics, electronics, literature, psychology and
philology are just a few of the things I'm interested in.

I smoke cigars at the rate of about one a fortnight. They're just too
expensive. Except for the ones I like the best. In my hometown,
Miami, old Cuban guys, including my grandfather, spend their days
handmaking cigars and smoking them while they play dominos. To pay for
their losses there, they sell what cigars are left over to people
passing by. I tend to be one of those people anytime I get a
chance. Going home with an assortment of about 10 cigars, I only paid
about as many dollars! And I like them as much or better than any of
the expensive brands.. Macanudo, Dunhill, etc. 

But really I like to smoke my pipe. I had a rough time of it for the
first period, since there was noone to teach me what to do or how to
do it. I bought a small plastic pipe and an ounce of black cavendish
from a local store, since everyone told me I wouldn't like it. Now I
have 6 briars (one with meerschaum lining), and 3 cobs. My favorite
pipe was my meerschaum, but I broke it at the shank while trying to
remove the stem for a cleaning. After that I've been more careful. I
also gave my cousin my falcon pipe (nowhere to hold it, really, but it
looked nice), and had my favourite briar stolen. Slowly building a
modest collection, and trying more types of leaf, are my goals.

Anyway, now I like to smoke a wide variety of tobaccos, but my
favourite is still black cavendish, especially from a meerschaum. Add
a snifter of brandy (or cognac), "and that's what it's all about."

I have a little nasty trick I play on restaurants that won't let me
smoke a pipe: I have a clove! They smell almost as strongly, and not
necessarily as nicely, and if they make a fuss, I call the manager,
etc, and make a fuss right back. I know, it's not nice, and it makes
people even madder at smokers in the big picture of things, but it
abates my childish anger..

I hope there are people reading this in the Tallahassee area, and I
hope they would like to get together for a while and chat. It gets
kinda lonely, but that's a good feeling, too. 

I'd like to present to everyone a small endeavor I've been working on,
my Smokin' HomePage. It's not very fancy, but it has some useful
things in it already, and it's growing fast. Take this road, make a
left, three blocks down, and you'll come to:

Hello, and please sign me up for the Pipes mailgroup!

Here's a little about myself and my tobacco interests:

I am 29 and began smoking pipes at age 18, because a friend and I were
so influenced by Tolkien. We waited until we were about out of high
school, and treated our first pipe purchase and use to be a
"coming-of-age" event. I still have that pipe, an Israeli Alpha
oom-paul, and still smoke and cherish it. I still buy my tobacco from
the same tobacconist I bought that pipe from.

Since then, I have experimented with many popular pipe brands and
styles and have come to prefer bent Savinelli pipes with the Dry
System filter. After similar experimentation with tobaccos, I confess
to still preferring the aromatics, usually mild cavendish &amp; burley
blends, not too heavily sugared, although a little Virginia or Perique
adds some needed spice. Latakia and English blends don't generally
agree with me, although I'm still open to suggestions.

About two years ago another friend introduced me to the pleasures of
smoking premium handmade cigars, and I have enjoyed exploring this new
angle on tobacco enjoyment. So far, I consistently enjoy just about
anything from Partagas, Arturo Fuente, and Avo. I've also recently
become a fan of Dunhill Monte Cruz robustos, but my absolute
hands-down favorite (unfortunately for my wallet) are the three Avo XO
varieties.

I treat tobacco as a special treat and thus smoke infrequently - maybe
once or twice a week. I have never been interested in habitual tobacco
use; I guess a still carry my adolescent motives around, and I just
can't see Gandalf strung out on nicotine!  ;)

I'm looking forward to hearing from group members: for example, do
y'all agree that the Avo XOs add anything significant to the regular
Avos? My tobacconist says he can't taste much significant difference,
but I certainly do!

Hi Steve (and everyone),
	I just wanted to take the time to stop lurking (for a few months) and 
introduce myself. My name is Daniel Meaney (yes, another Irish-American :] ). 
I am 35, and I live in what we call "The Middle Kingdom", San Luis Obispo 
County, California. I'm a Radiation Health Physics\RadioChemistry Technician 
at a little Nuclear plant we have here (yes..It's safe..and I don't glow :] ).

I have been a Cigar Enthusiast for about 2 years, ever since discovering our 
local Cigar store called "The Sanctuary" (It's called this due to the fact 
that it is a crime to smoke anything, inside anyplace, in San Luis Obispo 
except this One store).

My favorites are Avo #9's and R&amp;J #3 Vintage ( as you can see, I do like the 
Robusto!), preferably with a wee dram of Laphroig or Lagavulin. I have yet to 
try a Cuban, but have been pestering a few friends that are traveling to other 
realms to maybe check out a few shops for me. 

One of the Hi-Lites of the past few months was a Cigar Dinner put on by The 
Sanctuary. We started with H.Upmann Churchill's, and ended with Santa Domina 
#100's. Our guest speaker was Richard Hacker (The Ultimate Cigar Book). We 
also left with a pocket full of different Consolidated Cigar Co.'s products. 
This was my first experience with a room full of Enthusiasts, boy was it a 
blast! And the food was excellent also! 

I want to thank you for doing a great job with the list, and to keep 'em 
coming!

Smoke 'em if ya got 'em,
Daniel

I've looked through the resource guide and did'nt find any. I was 
wondering if anyone on the list was aware of a Pipe Smokers'/Collectors'

starting one. 

If anyone has any info or would be interested in starting something,

<a name="6">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #190 - May 22, 1995 </a>

1.  Thanks for maintaining this mailing list; I really enjoy it, even if it has
become rather cigar centered lately.  Nothing all that wrong with cigars but
they lack my favorite thing about pipes - the variety of flavor.  Sure there
is alot of variety, but it's not as much as that provided by pipe tobacco when
you include aromatics.  Where could I find a virginia/burley mix with some
perique in it in a cigar?  (Watch, someone will know of one..;)

2.  I agree that the Falcon is simply the best pipe I've ever seen or smoked.
I don't think mine's the prettiest I've ever seen but for smoking a bowl down
to the bottom without relights, gurgles, sour, or overly hot smoke it's the
absolute best - nothing else comes anywhere near it for pleasant smoking or
easy cleaning.  Well, I haven't tried a calabash, and water pipes are in some
senses more pleasant than any other kind of pipe.

3. I notice most tobaccos people say they prefer have a brand name.  I've seen
brand name tobaccos but always opted for the loose jarred tobaccos, or had the
tobacconist mix a custom blend.  My two favorites are the 50/50 vir/bur mix w/
perique mentioned above (adjust perique level to taste; the burley cools the
hot burning virginia and takes the edge off its taste, while the VA keeps the
cool burley from going out too easily and lends its sweetness).  Two is an even
mix of RB Light (which your tobacconist probably has, though it may be known by
a better sounding label name.  1-Q works also, both are very mild virginias) 
with a cherry cavendish.  I find pure CC a bit too sweet and it tends to smoke
too moist without being cut with a drier tobacco.

4. Cigarretes seem to have a bad name around here but I've been
handrolling them lately with Three Castles or American Spirit (pure
VA) tobacco and they're as tasty as any pipe that way.  I notice
American Spirit is selling manufactured cigarettes with their natural
tobacco now, but they're filters which I tend not to like so well.  I
tried rolling with an aromatic pipe tobacco but that was a bit much.
The RB/Cherry blend almost worked, maybe an American Spirit &amp; Cherry
would really work.

5.  The web site is impressive, even if it did take me a bit to discover the 
new address.  Shame that Cray couldn't stay in business.

<a name="7">Subject: Pipe purchase</a>

Dear Steve,

Hi there! Would you be kind enough to advise me on the purchase of a pipe?

For the past several years, I have smoked a filtered Medico pipe. I would
like to place my faithful pipe aside and purchase a good filterless pipe. I
honestly considered a Dunhill, but the bottomline price was above what I was
willing to invest in my first real pipe purchase. Prehaps for Christmas, but
not as my 35th birthday gift.
 
Yesterday, I visited the Connoisseur Pipe Shop here in New York City (1285
Avenue of the Americas). I spoke at great length with Ed Burak, the shop
owner. I explained about my lack of knowledge as well as my lack of pipes. I
am currently smoking a "straight" pipe. Ed quickly showed me a pipe with just
a slight bend in it. He said it was all briar and all made in his shop. The
cost $125.00. Now I must honestly tell you that I have no problem paying
$125.00 for a pipe which will last for years to come.

My questions are simple:

1. Have you ever heard anything about the quality of pipes produced by this
shop?

2. Due to my lack of knowledge (limited to reading the Pipe Digest, The
Ultimate Pipe Book by Hacker and based upon my limited experience), I called
the Connoisseur Pipe Shop this morning. I asked Ed if I would be permitted to
place the pipe in my mouth. He flatly said NO due to "my safety and that of
his other customers". I told him that I wanted to see how it felt. His
response was "Would I make a bit that was not comfortable?" Is it common not
to allow a customer the option of seeing how a pipe feels prior to it's
purchase? He barely allowed me to hold it and look at it. I honestly wonder
if I'm in the wrong place. After all, I fell in love with the pipe, but I
really have not looked at other pipes in the same shop. Should I take his
advise and purchase a slightly bent pipe as my first "real" pipe?
He did sell me some very good tobak called Scottish Ribbon.

Steve, can you please advise me before this Friday (the date of the intended
purchase).

Thank you!!

Karl Leeds    ?????????@???.???

Dear Digestees,

I need some help with humidor plans.  I am building a poolhouse, the
upstairs of which will be my "smoking room", flytying room, etc.  I want to
build a chest type or walk-in closet type humidor that might hold 2-3
thousand cigars.  My builder is an excellent cabinetmaker, but he is a
little daunted by the prospect of building this beast.  Does anybody have
any plans or any suggestions about this?  Any advice either commercial in
nature or not, will be welcome by e-mail to ???????@????.???.

Thanks in advance!

Steve,

In Digest #190, I translated 7 rules for the pipe smoker from a brochure I
picked up in a French pipe shop.  The brochure is by Ch. CORRIEU.  Here is
the rest of the brochure with, what I hope, is an accurate translation.
 Again, I am NOT a French-language scholar and I will have omitted the
different accent markings over certain words.  I do not wish to offend.  :)

Le fumeur de pipe se distingue des autres par son caractere et sa
personnalite.  Il a confiance en lui; il sait reflechir, se concentrer, il
possede surtout la faculte de prendre le temps de vivre et de savourer des
instants de tranquillite que la plupart des hommes ne connaissent pas.
(The pipe smoker differs from other men by his character and personality.  He
is self-confidant, he is able to think and concentrate; also he is able to
take time for life and to enjoy quiet moments that most people do not
experience.)

Le  vrai fumeur de pipe est exigeant sur la qualite de la bruyere.  Il
choisit sa pipe avec soin, en tenant compte de la vieillesse de la bruyere,
de la legerete de la pipe et de la veine du bois.
(The true pipe-smoker is difficult to please where the quality of the briar
is concerned.  He chooses his pipe carefully and considers the age of the
briar, the lightness of the pipe, and the grain of the wood.)

C'est en pensant aux veritables connaisseurs que les "CORRIEU", depuis
plusieurs generations, selectionnent minutieusement et laissent secher
pendant des annees les meilleures bruyeres qu'ils recoltent dans le Massif
des Maures.
(This is for true connoisseurs, that "Corrieu" has been carefully selecting
and drying for years, for several generations, the best briars of the
"Maures" mountains.)

Here is the address given:

<a name="11">Subject: Steve Weiner: Pipemaker (fwd)</a>

Steve, one of the ideas I had for the Ohio Pipe Collectors newsletter was
a series of pipemaker profiles, starting of course with Ohio pipemakers. 
This is the first in that series, which I would like to share with your
readers if you can print it.
                           STEVE WEINER
The Artisan
	Steve Weiner, Ohio pipemaker, lives in Olmstead Falls, Ohio (a
suburb of Cleveland), with his wife, Bonnie.  Their daughter graduated
from Ohio University a year ago.  Steve is president of his own utility
bill consulting business, which performs electric, gas and local telephone
billing audits and verifications for such clients as businesses and
schools.  He carves pipes in his basement workshop in the time remaining.
	After smoking cigarettes for many years, Steve decided to
experiment with pipes in 1979, mostly, as he says, "out of curiosity. 
Pipe smoking quickly turned into pipe collecting, and I was hooked on the
hobby."  Then, in 1989, Steve's 89-year-old grandfather, a pattern maker
by trade, died and left Steve the contents of his workshop: a drill press,
two motors, hand files and countless drill bits and other odds and ends. 
Steve had previously toyed with the idea of crafting a pipe, but this
legacy helped him make up his mind.  He built a workbench, set up a shop
and began producing pipes--"or at least what I called pipes.  They
certainly didn't look like the Ascorti, Jacapo and Butera pipes I had been
smoking, but I kept at it, and after a while they started to look like
something."
	In the summer of 1990, Steve got a "real break"--a visit with Mike
Butera in his Houston shop.  As Steve says, "During one long Saturday, I
learned more about pipemaking than I had in the entire previous year. 
When I got back home, I applied what I learned from Mike and, with some
practice, began getting results that actually surprised me."  Steve
attended his first PCCA show as a pipemaker in 1991.  He was honored as
best Pipemaker at the 1991 and 1994 C.O.R.P.S. shows in Richmond, VA and
received an award of merit at the 1993 PCCA show in Washington, D.C.
	When I asked Steve what ideal, in terms of craftsmanship and
smoking qualities, he strives for, he answered that, in his opinion, "the
best pipes being made today are those by Mike Butera.  This is the
standard to which I compare my pipes.  I have yet to meet it, but I will
keep trying.
	I remarked to Steve that, as with every craftsman/artist, times
must occur when he rises above the workmanlike job of producing a good,
aesthetically pleasing product of which he can be proud and becomes
inspired.  What, I asked, causes such moments of inspiration?  "Luck," he
replied.  "What inspires me is an exceptionally nice piece of wood.  When
I come across a nicely grained, flawless piece of wood, I tend to increase
my effort to make the perfect pipe."
	Steve doesn't have one favorite tobacco but enjoys latakia blends
and is currently smoking a matured Virginia from John B. Hayes called
Tom's Red &amp; Black.
The Pipes
	Steve Weiner makes his pipes from plateau briar and Italian
lucite stems.  The dot he puts in the stem is also briar, and his stem
inlays are briar or lucite.  He stamps each pipe with his name and
"U.S.A.," and he numbers and dates each one.  For example, the pipe
stamped "00594" is the fifth pipe he finished in 1994.
	Steve subjects his pipes to a two-step treatment process, the
first to remove any excess resin from the wood and the second to coat the
inside of the bowl with his special carbonizing formula to ease the
break-in process and protect the wood.
	Steve hand shapes every pipe, using sanding disks, hand files
and sandpaper.  He turns the tenons on a small lathe and then buffs
them for an exact fit.  He hand sands his smooth pipes to 320 grit and
then buffs, stains and waxes them.  He hand carves his rough-finished
pipes.
	Because Steve was a dedicated pipe smoker long before he started
making pipes, he has definite ideas about what is needed to make a
satisfying smoke:
*	He tapers his tobacco holes but not so severely that a tamper will
	not fit into the bottom of the bowl.
*	His air holes are relatively large to make for an easy draw.
*	He constructs each pipe so that you can slide a pipe cleaner all
	the way to the bottom of the bowl without removing the stem.
*	He slightly rounds the lip so it is not uncomfortable to the tongue.
	Steve's production varies with the time he can spend on his craft.
 For 1993 and 1994, he averaged 116 pipes.  He has no philosophical
objections to sandblasted pipes, but, because of space and expense
considerations, he has not invested in sandblasting equipment.  Therefore,
when a briar block will not yield a smooth piece, he carves it.  About 80%
of his pipes are carved, and virtually all of his pipes are standard
shapes or variations thereof.  His retail prices start at $140 for a basic
carved piece but can go up to $400 to $500 for smooth pieces with
exceptional size and grain.  Steve sells many of his pipes through Barclay
Pipe &amp; Tobacco in Columbus, but he has also placed pipes in shops in
Akron, Chagrin Falls, Cleveland and San Francisco and in Virginia and
North and South Carolina.

Steve Weiner--artisan, OPC member, and all-around good guy--can be
contacted at 6683 Laurel Lane, Olmstead Falls, Ohio 44138 or call (216)
235-9338.  Steve has rented a table at the September 23 OPC show and will
be there to display, talk about and sell his pipes.  And he has also
promised to donate one of them to the raffle.

I wanted to thank you for sending me Pipes Digest, reading them has been a
lot of fun.  I've only briefly flirted with pipes, cigars have been my main
source of tobacco enjoyment.  I started out with mild panatelas and coronas
but lately have been enjoying thicker ring gauge robustos, etc..  Currently
my mild mainstay is a Macanudo Hyde Park (5 1/2 x 49) but for true bliss I
love Romeo y Julieta Vintage cigars.  I'd be interested to hear what cigars
your readers were enjoying.  I'm a little frustrated with all the cuban cigar
reviews in C.A.  But I suppose it's just a U.S. problem due to our
chickenshit trade embargo.  My wife's brother in law is a Spaniard and says
that the Cuban smokes available in Spain are inconsistent in quality at best.
 I'd be interested to hear what our friend in Barcelona thinks about that.  

That's all for now.  Happy Smoking!

Smoke Signal #16

One day during a visit to England this month, I stopped for lunch, in the
ancient town of Tewkesbury. On my way back to the car, I passed a bookshop
dealing in used books and was inexorably drawn into its dusty interior. It was
there that I came across a portfolio of papers that I discovered once belonged
to Dr. John H. Watson, M. D. Unaware of the nature of these papers, the
proprietor of the shop sold them to me in return for a five-pound note.

&gt;From this portfolio I have cobbled together the short story that
follows in the file attachment. A story that I believe will be of

            The Adventure of the Pipe-Smoking Woman

            Copyright 1995 by Andrew Donovan-Shead

     It is so often the problem with the numerous cases of my friend
Mr. Sherlock Holmes that I, as his biographer, am hard pressed
to choose which ones to place before the public. Usually, I try
to put forth those cases that have provided ample exercise for
my friend's extraordinary deductive powers. In course of events,
not all problems brought to Holmes' notice needed him to strain
every sinew in the sifting and weighing of facts. And so it is
with the problem of the pipe- smoking woman. It hardly taxed
Holmes as a criminal expert, but it did draw upon his store of
arcane knowledge, a knowledge that allowed him to cut off one
arm of an ungodly, depraved, and wicked trade, the mere thought
of which still sickens me, even I who have been privileged to
see so much of the world.
     London had been enjoying something of an Indian summer that year
and it was towards the end of this period that Holmes and I were
in our rooms sitting either side of a cheerful fire, one of the
first to take the chill off the evening. We had partaken of a
hearty dinner and were at our ease digesting, helped by a noble
brandy and a couple of fine cigars, when the final post of the
day brought a letter for Holmes.
     "It is from my brother Mycroft," said Holmes.
     "He has something of interest for you, no doubt?"
     "No doubt, Watson," said Holmes, tossing the envelope across to
me.
     My first acquaintance with Holmes' brother was in the not
altogether successful 'Adventure of the Greek Interpreter.' Then
as now Mycroft Holmes was the provenance of our case. His letter
read thus:

     "Will you dine with me tomorrow at the club? I have something
out of the ordinary for you."

     "You will come too, I hope," said Holmes as I passed him the
letter.
     "I have nothing doing tomorrow and should be delighted to wait
upon you."
     "Excellent, Watson, we must be there at Noon precisely. The
Diogenes Club is most particular to have its luncheon with the
sun at its zenith."

     Next day, just short of the Noon hour, Holmes and I were walking
down Pall Mall from the St. James end towards The Carlton and
the unassuming door that was the entrance to the Diogenes Club.
As usual we entered mumchance and were shown past the glass
panelling to the strangers room where we found Mycroft Holmes
larger, more corpulent than I remembered. He was sitting at a
table containing covered dishes, in the bow-window overlooking
the street.
     "Ah! Sherlock, how good of you to come," said Mycroft, "I
received your note. I hope you walked up an appetite. Here there
are some cutlets that should dull its edge. Please be seated."
     Holmes and I sat down and a servant removed the covers of the
dishes and helped us to our lunch.
     "You are beginning to find the weather disagreeable Doctor,"
said Mycroft, taking me by surprise.
     "Why, yes I am finding the first chills of winter uncomfortable,
but how can you know?"
     Mycroft smiled, "From your chronicles I collect that you were
wounded in Afganistan. I saw you and Sherlock walking down the
street and I noticed you limping more than when last we met. My
inference is that the chilly nights are making themselves felt."
     "Well, it's true," said I with a laugh.
     "Watson is an interesting study, I know, but Mycroft, your
letter indicated that you had something of interest to me," said
Holmes in some impatience.
     "Yes, Sherlock, it may be nothing, but it is curious," said
Mycroft as he tucked into his cutlets and mashed potatoes.
     Holmes leant back in his chair and touched together the
finger-tips of each hand, rested his elbows on the arms of the
chair, and put his two index fingers just under his lower lip.
It was an attitude I knew well. He left his food uneaten and
listened to Mycroft who went on with his story between
mouthfuls. . . .
     "A fellow lodger in my building is Admiral William Babbington of
the Admiralty. He is a zealous officer who once sailed with
Lucky Jack Aubrey.  He is also known for having an eye for the
ladies."
     Holmes remained unmoved and had assumed that familiar,
heavy-lidded expression of eye indicating deep concentration.
     "Each day," Mycroft continued, "Admiral Babbington lunches at
Black's, his club. He is an officer of an older Navy and likes
his lunch at two o'clock. It is his custom to spend the
preprandial hour between one and two in the reading room at
Black's drinking gin and bitters, while seated in the window
overlooking the street and Button's club opposite; a vantage
point from which he can admire the skirts passing to and fro
below."
     Holmes sat perfectly still.
     "About a week ago Admiral Babbington was on watch as usual and,
getting ready to go to table, raised his glass to his lips,
cocking back his head to drain his drink. In so doing he
happened to glance across the street and saw a handsome woman
sitting at a garret window in the building next door to
Button's."
     "My dear Mycroft, there is nothing unusual about that," said
Holmes in a bored drawl.  "Next door to Button's is Mother
Abbott's, a notorious bawdy house for the wealthy rakes that
belong to Button's and other hot-blooded young men about town.
There are sure to be handsome young women sitting in the windows
of the top floors. Is that not where they live when not on duty?"
     "Yes, indeed. However, what struck the Admiral as odd is that
the young woman in question was smoking a pipe."
     "Well, well, there is nothing too odd about that either, these
days."
     "No, but the Admiral said that she smoked like a pirate and did
the same every day this past week, more so since the young woman
has detected Babbington's interest in her."
     "Ha! Is that so," said Holmes leaning forward in his chair.
     "I thought you would see the possibilities," said Mycroft,
wiping his mouth on his napkin. "What is more, if you present
yourself at Black's today you will find the Admiral ready to
receive you between one and two o'clock. There are fifteen
minutes wanting before one. I will leave you to make your own
way there as I have some reading to do next door in one of those
supportive armchairs."
     Holmes gave a quick smile and said: "Come, Watson, let us see
this pipe-smoking woman for ourselves."
     We left Mycroft sunk in a deep leather armchair with the Times
over his face and made our way to Black's club. As we walked
along the pavement Holmes chuckled to himself.
     "Well, Watson, what do you think of this case of the
pipe-smoking woman?"
     "As you said, Holmes, a woman who smokes a pipe, while not
common, is not all that unusual, and I would not be surprised at
the activity amongst the employees of a place such as Mother
Abbott's. What does surprise me is that Admiral Babbington
should have noticed such a person."
     "That the Admiral should notice a woman does not surprise me in
the least," said Holmes. "In his day he was notorious for his
amours. That he should have noticed a woman in a garret window
is sheer luck, since his attention was focussed in the street
below. Few people, Watson, see much above fifteen degrees from
the horizontal. It was only the chance of his tossing off a
drink coupled with his roving eye, sensitised as it is from a
lifetime of admiration for the female form, that led him to
notice the woman in the first place. He noticed her and her
voracious habit of pipe.  It is a fortuitous combination of
events that leads us to Black's and the possibility of an
instructive half-hour."
     As Holmes finished his didactic speech we came to the steps of
Black's and went up into the foyer of the club. Holmes gave his
card to the attendant and asked after Admiral Babbington.  Soon
a pageboy appeared and took us up to the reading-room on the
first floor front. We crossed the room and were met by a small,
ruddy complected man of weather beaten aspect.  Admiral
Babbington appeared to be well into his seventh decade of life.
     "Ah! Mr. Holmes," he said addressing my tall, lean companion.
"How good of you to come. It may be just one of the whores
enjoying her baccy, but it struck me as such a queer thing that
I mentioned it to your brother, who is my neighbour, and he
thought you might be interested in her as a curiosity. He said
that you take interest in the smallest details."
     "It is the details that count, Admiral," said Holmes. "This is
my friend and collegue Dr.  Watson."
     "Pleased to know you Sir," said the Admiral, his sea-going voice
coming strong from his aging body. His handshake could still
crack walnuts. I observed that when younger he was a man of
barrel-chest, active and vigorous. Although in age his pot-belly
was now larger than his chest.  The Admiral ushered us to the
chairs drawn close to the window overlooking the street. Below,
the population of London ebbed and flowed, bustled and jostled.
     "Will you join me in a tot. The sun's over the yardarm and I
like to whet my appetite."
     The steward brought Holmes and me a decanter of brandy and a
gasogene.  When we were settled with our drinks, the Admiral
raised his glass.
     "Gentlemen, the Queen. God bless her."
     "The Queen," said Holmes and I, standing.
     Remaining seated, the Admiral noticed my look of surprise.
     "In the navy we have a dispensation to take the Loyal Toast
seated; saves broken heads you know, the deckheads being so low.
     "With luck our woman with the pipe should be at her station,"
the Admiral continued and looked up towards the garret rooms of
Mother Abbott's across the street.
     "Yes, there she is. By Jove, what a charming face."
     Admiral Babbington moved out of his chair to make room for
Holmes. I knelt down beside his chair and, looking over his
shoulder, saw in the distance a fine featured woman with a mass
of blond hair about her head. She was sitting in one of the
garret windows smoking a short clay pipe of the type known as a
cutty. Catching sight of us, she increased her rate of smoking
to the point where it appeared positively rhythmical. Holmes
watched for several minutes in silence and then stiffened into a
quivering bodily excitement typical of him when his mental
faculties are stimulated to fever pitch. A demeanour
unnoticeable to those unacquainted with Holmes, but of deep
meaning to me as I know him so well.
     "You will not mind me smoking, Admiral?" Said Holmes.
     "Of course not, Sir, by all means light your pipe. There is
nothing like a pipe to calm a man's nerves; swear by it, that
and Bosun's grog."
     Holmes pulled a battered briar from his pocket, one with a most
capacious bowl, and filled it with his fulsome, extra strong
shag tobacco. Soon he was puffing away with such passionate fury
that the Admiral and I fell back to a safe distance from the
cloud of blue smoke.
     "By Heavens, Doctor! Mr. Holmes is more of a smoker than that
unusual woman. Is he always so?"
     I had always known Holmes as a voracious smoker, particularly
when working out a knotty problem. Three pipes an hour was quite
usual, but never have I seen him smoke with such singular
intensity of purpose. The Admiral and I retired to the other
side of the room and watched Holmes smoke three pipes in thirty
minutes. He sat in the window gazing up at the woman in the
garret, pausing in his rythmical puffing from time to time to
lean back in his chair and gaze up across the street.
     "Do ye think he has taken a fancy to her?" Said the Admiral.
     "Well, there certainly seems to be a meeting of minds," said I,
"but I have never known Holmes to take anything other than a
strictly professional interest in the sex. His pleasure is
derived solely from intellectual stimulation."
     "But a quite charming figurehead, don't ye think Doctor?"
     I could do nothing but agree with the Admiral, for the woman
appeared to be of some beauty even from a distance. After forty
minutes of vigorous smoking, Holmes knocked out the ash from his
pipe, rose from his chair and walked across the room to us.
     "This is more serious than I thought, Watson. Admiral, where is
the nearest point from here that one could get passage down the
Thames?"
     "Why, Mr. Holmes, I should think on the South side of Lambeth
bridge.  There is a pier at which you could board a cutter."
     "Thank you. I may need your help later today. May I prevail upon
your naval experience?"
     "Of course, Sir, I should be proud to be associated with you."
     "Capital! In that case, Admiral, allow me to ask if you have
ships at your command in the estuary of the Thames?"
     "Why yes, Sir, there is the gunboat Vengence anchored at the
Nore. Her captain, James Croaker, dined with me yesterday. He
was a squeaker with me years ago when I was first made post. We
can signal him by sending a despatch from here to Sheerness."
     "Come, Watson, there is no time to be lost. I will send a
special messenger with instructions later, Admiral. Until then,
good day to you Sir. A most instructive hour. Thank you for
bringing this curiosity to my attention."
     As we left Black's, Holmes paused on the steps and scrutinised
Mother Abbott's and Button's club across the street. Moving on,
he was silent as we walked. I could see that he was thinking
deeply and, not willing to break in upon his train of thought,
held my counsel.
     "This is a black business," said Holmes at last, "with some
similarity to our case of the Greek Interpreter, but I hope to
prevent something altogether darker by far."
     "Do you mean to say that the death of that emaciated man was not
dark enough?" Said I with some heat.
     "Not at all, Watson, in many respects this case may have a fate
worse than death in store for this lady, Miss LaVada Sorensen,
unless we can intervene and effect a rescue."
     This revelation stopped me in my tracks.
     "My dear Holmes, this is too much. How can you presume to know
this woman's name?  By what small clues have you deduced it?"
     "You have seen what I have seen," said Holmes as we continued
walking, "but there are no clues from which you can make such a
deduction. No, Watson, the fact is that you do not know, and
cannot know what I know.  Now, I must leave you here and press
on to Scotland Yard for an interview with Inspector Stanley
Hopkins. We will meet again at our rooms in time for dinner.
Until then, goodbye."
     And there Holmes left me, he to see the well-known Hopkins of
the Yard and me for a puzzling afternoon back at Baker Street.
No matter how I cogitated on the events of the morning I could
not discover the means by which Holmes came about his
information. There was nothing left for me to do but wait.

     Holmes returned to our rooms a little after seven o'clock. He
sat down to table and peered under the covers of the dishes.
     "I am famished, Watson, having taken nothing to eat since this
morning, but I think Mrs.  Hudson's steak and kidney pie will
restore me."
     Holmes ate in silence and I knew that it would be fruitless to
question him about his movements that afternoon. He would tell
me in his own time.  I sat beside the fire reading the evening
paper.
     "Watson, I owe you an explanation. . ."
     I put down my paper. Holmes wiped his mouth on his napkin, came
across and sat in his chair, loaded his old and blackened clay
pipe with a plug of tobacco from the toe of the Persian slipper.
With the tongs, he picked up a glowing ember from the grate of
the fire and applied it to the tobacco.  When he had the pipe
going to his satisfaction, he leant back in his chair and
thrust his feet towards the fire.
     "Yes, Watson, I owe you an explanation."
     "Well, Holmes, I confess to being entirely in the dark over this
affair."
     "Time was of the essence. I could not delay to bring you fully
into my confidence. Even now I am not sure there are not gaps in
my net through which these evil people may escape."
     "Is it as bad as that?"
     "Yes, Watson, it is. However, let me bring you up to the moment
with events as I have seen them. We have time for there is
nothing we can do until later this evening when I expect to hear
from Hopkins.
     "Cast your mind back to this morning and let me tell you that
Miss LaVada Sorensen is an American of Scandinavian descent. She
is a telegraphist lately come to London. She has no relatives
and has fallen prey to white slavers."
     "My God, Holmes, this is monstrous, but how do you know?"
     "Miss Sorensen told me so, she is a telegraphist and like her I
am familiar with Mr.  Samuel Morse's code, it being my
professional duty to a nodding acquaintence with codes and
ciphers of many types."
     "So, Miss Sorensen signalled you with Morse's code, but how?"
     "With her pipe, Watson. She is a lady with a keen mind. I sat
there in Admiral Babbington's chair. She saw me and started
sending a smoke signal encoded in Morse -- four short puffs; one
short puff; one short, one long, two short puffs; followed by
one short, two long puffs, one short puff. I recognised a rhythm
at once but it was only after the third repeat that I understood
that it was Morse that I was seeing. By the fourth repeat I
understood that I was seeing HELP."
     "A distress," I cried.
     "Precisely, Watson. It was at that point that I lit my pipe and
sent back the reply: Who are you? Followed by: What is wrong?
She gave me her name in answer to the first question. To the
second she replied: White slave; prisoner. Then I replied: Do
not despair. I regret I could not send and receive faster, but
clarity of signal was of the utmost importance, the pipe not
being the most facile means of communication."
     "Very good, Holmes, but how do you know that she is an American
of Scandinavian descent and alone in the world?"
     "That is information I deduced from her answers to my questions.
Her Christian name, LaVada, is of peculiarly American origin.
Her surname, Sorensen, is Scandinavian, hence my deduction, a
deduction supported in part by her blond hair and the bone
structure of her face.  Obviously, if she is being held against
her will she must have no relatives or friends because if she
did they would have instituted enquiries as to her whereabouts,
and I have seen none such in the newspapers in recent weeks.
Also, her captors must know this or they would not have made so
bold as to kidnap her."
     "Wonderful, but is she not lucky to have attracted the Admiral's
eye? Why not someone in the street?"
     "She is extremely lucky, Watson. In the first place, city
dwellers rarely look up, and if they did they could not see the
garret windows from ground level, they are only visible from the
upper floors of Black's. As it is, the chances of being seen are
a thousand to one against someone taking notice from the upper
windows of Black's. Most people when they look out of a window
look down into the street below. As chance would have it,
Admiral Babbington happened to look up and his eye was attracted
by a pretty woman. Anyone else would have dismissed her as one
of Mother Abbott's girls and not given her a second glance.
Lucky for her, the Admiral is something of a connoisseur of the
female form no matter what line of business that form might be
engaged in. And to make the odds even larger against her gaining
help, the Admiral happened to mention the curiosity to Mycroft
who thought it might be of interest to me. So, you see, Watson,
the chances of Miss Sorensen's rescue relies on a long chain of
remote coincidence. So much so that if I were less of a
scientific and pragmatic man I should be inclined to attribute
her luck to divine intervention. Even now the forces of evil are
not checked, her luck could run out."
     "By God, Holmes, what are we doing sitting here? We must rescue
this distressed lady at once."
     "Ah! Always the man of action, Watson. We cannot charge into
Mother Abbott's brothel and demand possession of this lady's
person, the law is against us. We must be warranted in our
actions, which is why I went in haste to Scotland Yard to
convince Hopkins to raid the place. But the machinery of the law
is slow moving. A warrant must be issued and the constables
marshalled. I fear. . . but hark, that wheel grinding the curb
outside must be the cab containing Hopkins himself. It is almost
twelve o'clock and the raid should be complete."
     We heard the front door slam and Hopkins heavy tread upon the
stair. The boy in buttons opened the door and showed in our
visitor. We could tell by Hopkins' dejected appearance that all
was not well.
     "Well, Hopkins?" said Holmes as the inspector slumped into the
spare chair.
     "The birds have flown, Mr. Holmes. I think they had warning."
     "I am not surprised. I expected as much," said Holmes, "Mother
Abbott's is used by some of the most distinguished names in the
government. What did you find?"
     "As you said Mr. Holmes, the garret rooms had been occupied.
There was a table, two chairs, and a bed. We found smoking
materials on the table and we could see the reading room windows
of Black's. We questioned the girls, but none of them could say
who was in the room as they were closely guarded. Mother Abbott
is not to be found."
     "All is not lost," said Holmes as he scribbled in haste on a
page from his notebook. He pulled the bell-knob and gave the
note to the boy with instructions to take it to Admiral
Babbington.
     "If you will return for breakfast in the morning, Hopkins, I
think I may have an answer to this."
     "I'll be glad to, Mr. Holmes, and I don't mind saying that I'm
at risk from this botched raid. Disturbing high society whores
for no reason. My job's at stake," Hopkins rose and turned to
leave.
     "Do not worry. We should have something by morning."
     "I hope you're right, Mr. Holmes, I hope you're right."
     Our door slammed again and Holmes said: "We had better turn in
ourselves and see what the morning brings when the tide turns."

     Next morning, I came down as the clock struck eight to find
Holmes about already with several telegrams opened on the table
in front of him. I poured myself a cup of coffee and heard the
sound of the doorbell.
     "Good morning, Watson, I trust you slept well?"
     "Yes, Holmes, I did, but who is that at this hour?"
     "It is the boy from the telegraph office if I am not mistaken."
     There was a knock at the door and in came Billy with a telegram
that he gave to Holmes who opened and quickly read it.
     "Excellent! Excellent! There is no reply. It is as I expected.
Have you seen the report of Hopkins' raid in 'The Times',
Watson? You will just have time to read it before he arrives."
     I picked up the paper, reading the leader while sipping my
coffee.
     "The leader writer doesn't show Hopkins in very good light,"
said I.
     "No, Watson, he does not, but I hope to rectify that this very
morning. We will wait until he arrives for his breakfast and
then I will put him at his ease for he is anxious as you will
see."
     At a quarter before the hour, Hopkins was shown up to our rooms
and he did indeed look careworn. His face showed the strain he
was under and his mouth was drawn into a thin, tight line. He
sat heavily into the spare chair and Holmes passed him a cup of
coffee.
     "It's a bad business Mr. Holmes. Have you seen 'The Times' this
morning?" Holmes nodded his assent. "The Commissioner is making
my life very difficult. I hope you have some better news for
me."
     "Indeed, I do have better news," said Holmes. "The watch we set
at the Cinque Ports proved fruitless, as I expected, but
nevertheless it was a safety measure only. This telegram from
Sheerness is of good report. See for yourself."
     Hopkins snatched the proffered telegram from Holmes' hand and
read eagerly.
     "Thank heavens we're not on a wild goose chase after all!
Captain Croaker detained them, taking them out of the cutter on
its way out of the Thames estuary early this morning.  What a
relief to me Mr. Holmes."
     "Yes, Hopkins, I apologise for putting you at such a
disadvantage, but I think you will find that the publicity
surrounding your successful capture of the London end of this
vile trade will more than make up for the temporary
inconvenience. Pray, sit up to the table and enjoy your
breakfast. There are some excellent kippers in that chafing
dish; fried bacon, eggs, kidneys, and tomatoes; toast and
marmalade."
     "Mr. Holmes, you have quite restored my appetite. Indeed, I find
myself sharp set all of a sudden. Pray, tell me how you came to
draw all these threads into your hands."
     I joined Hopkins in breaking our fast while Holmes stood in
front of the fire, leaning his left elbow on the mantlepiece and
propping his foot on the fender, his blackened clay pipe in his
right hand, it charged with the dottles of yesterday's smoking,
blue smoke rising from the bowl.  He related the events leading
up to this capture alluded to in the last telegram. Hopkins and
I listened while we ate.
     "Doctor Watson is not privy to the events from last night," said
Holmes, "so, I will begin there, Hopkins, if you don't mind."
     "Not at all, Mr. Holmes. Not at all," said Hopkins in some
lightness of heart.
     "As you know, Watson, the raid on Mother Abbott's yielded
nothing, the abbess having been forewarned in time for her to
steal a march from us. As soon as I knew the outcome I sent a
special message to Admiral Babbington.  Hopkins had the Cinque
Ports watched. . . ."
     "Yes, Mr. Holmes, at your suggestion," said he.
     "As I thought would happen, this information was also passed to
the abbess and her associates, which left them with one avenue
of escape. . . ."
     "By water down the Thames," said I.
     "Exactly. My message to the Admiral warned him to send a signal
to Captain James Croaker in 'The Vengence' who detained the
cutter off the Nore and took the occupants prisoner.  He is
bringing Miss LaVada Sorensen up the Thames on the flood tide
and Mother Abbott's accomplices are being held in chains until
they can be brought before the proper authorities. The captain
and Miss Sorensen should be with us by one o'clock."
     "Marvellous," said Hopkins.
     "Wonderful," said I.
     Hopkins finished his breakfast and then left us for the Yard to
make arrangements to receive the prisoners and to write his
report. Holmes and I spent the morning reading the papers while
waiting for the arrival of Captain Croaker and Miss Sorensen.

     Captain Croaker made good time. At half past twelve, Miss
Sorensen was shown into our rooms on the arm of Captain James
Croaker, a fine example of a seafaring officer, six feet tall,
dressed in brass-buttoned sea-going rig, grey eyed, auburn
haired, and possessed of a fine, luxurient beard.  Leaning
heavily on his arm, Miss Sorensen was the most remarkably
striking figure of womanhood that I have had the good fortune to
look upon. She was dressed in a high- necked dress of dark
violet taffeta, of full bosom and slim waist, her fine blond
hair escaping in wisps from a hastily contrived chignon. Her
eyes were of a peculiar and startling blue, contrasted by the
dark circles of skin below wrought by her vicissitudes; her fine
Scandinavian features were haggard by the long days of
captivity. Shorter than the captain, she was about five feet,
six inches in height. Together they made a handsome couple.
     "Miss Sorensen, Captain Croaker, please sit down," said Holmes
indicating the settee.
     With remarkable solicitude, the gallant captain helped the
weakened Miss Sorensen be comfortable, arranging pillows behind
her in support of her back.
     "I am glad you received our signal, Captain, and were entirely
successful in your endeavour," said Holmes.
     "So am I, Sir. We caught the cutter coming out on the remains of
the ebb tide and, with little room to manoeuvre, hove to when I
had the master gunner put a nine-pound ball across her bow. I
sent my first officer across in a boat with an armed boarding
party. They found Miss Sorensen bound and gagged in the
forepeak. We have handed those blackguards over to the police."
     "Well done, Captain. There are one or two points about which I
am unclear and I wonder if I might prevail upon Miss Sorensen to
give me and Dr.  Watson a brief summary of the circumstances of
her kidnap."
     "I must thank you Mr. Holmes, and the other gentlemen for my
rescue for I was in despair of ever being free again and
thinking of taking my own life rather than suffer the
indignities to which I was destined," said Miss Sorensen in soft
accents of North America. She continued: "My mother died while
giving birth to me. I was brought up by my father who was in
business in Chicago. He was afflicted with a weak heart and
joined my mother just before I graduated from Vassar College. My
father believed in the benefit of a sound education and sent me
there to attain it. After my graduation, I took a job as a
telegraphist in Chicago and learned Sam Morse's code. This job
was a temporary step to keep me from dwelling too much on my
loss and to give me time to decide what I should do with my
life. While at Vassar, I had studied much about the ancient
philosophers and systems of government common in the Old
Countries of Europe. I decided that I would like to see for
myself the mode of living and the foundations on which the
countries of Great Britain and Europe are based.  However,
despite my father's success in business, I did not have
unlimited funds at my disposal. To support myself I would need
some form of employment and hit upon the notion of using my
education in conjunction with acting as governess to the
children of some wealthy family.
     "From Chicago, I came to London and stayed in a boarding house
where I met a charming man, an explorer and traveller, Mr.
Fortesque Bland. While letting it be known that I was seeking a
position as a governess, I was rash enough to reveal that I was
alone in the world.  On the pretext of going to meet a
prospective employer, Bland decoyed me into Mother Abbott's
house where I was held prisoner in the rooms in the upper part
of the house. Bland had lived amongst the people of Persia and
the Levant, and had contracted with Mother Abbott to sell me
into the slavery of some Eastern Potentate's hareem. Apparently,
I would fetch a high price on account of my stature and blond
hair. . . ."
     "Damn fiends! I would very much like to have them flogged around
the fleet and then run up to the yardarm by the neck," said the
Captain in an angry voice that rattled the windows.
     "Part of the preparation for my journey was to habituate me to
opium in an effort to make me more pliable. Mother Abbott had
been feeding it to me in my food. Each day, I would recover from
the stupor and sit at the window.  Looking down, I noticed a man
sitting in the window of the building opposite. I had discovered
that I could steady my nerves by smoking tobacco as I have done
in the loneliness of my past. All I was provided with was a pipe
and coarse tobacco. Sitting in the window smoking and looking
down on the man across the street, I felt that if I could
attract his attention I might succeed in rescue. You may imagine
the intensity with which I looked at that man, but each day he
would turn away after sitting for an hour, and each day my
despair grew until one day he chanced to look up.
     "Always there was someone in the room with me while I was
conscious. When the man in the window below and across the
street took notice I would puff the letters HELP in Sam Morse's
code. I noticed that he wore a uniform and thought that he would
understand, but I found that the code is not commonly known and
my despair deepened. As the days passed, I began to think how I
could take my life to prevent the abuse waiting for me.
Yesterday, the man was at his window and again I started sending
my cry for help in tobacco smoke.
     "Imagine my disappointment when the man looked up at me as usual
and left his chair, and my astonishment when he was replaced by
Mr. Holmes who, after three or four sends, lit his own pipe and
sent me: Who are you? My heart stopped and I cried out but
managed to cover my confusion with a fit of coughing, so that my
guard was not suspicious. I sent my replies and was able to rest
easier than at any time during the month long eternity that was
my prelude to Hell.  My dismay, Mr. Holmes. . . . My dismay at
the sudden move from the house. . . . It was too much to bear.
Some word was brought to Mother Abbott and her cohort causing me
to be hustled from the house in a cab to the river and a boat
that set sail on the ebb tide.  It was too much for me and, half
stupified, I cried and cried until I was gagged by those
ruffians.
     "Hope returned when we were stopped in our flight by good
Captain Croaker and his crew. At last I am free and I can only
thank you from the depths of my heart."
     So said the unfortunate Miss LaVada Sorensen who had begun to
shake and burst into the most piteous sobbing. Captain Croaker
was at her side instantly, offering her the use of his
handkerchief.
     "I am so sorry, gentlemen, but I am feeling the effects of the
opium."
     "And the nervous strain of your captivity," said I, feeling her
pulse.  "You must have complete rest."
     "Dr. Watson is quite corrrect, Miss Sorensen," said Holmes. "I
think you have completed all the details for me. You must rest
and recuperate and be ready to give evidence at the trial of
these people."
     "I have a friend, Dr. Frederick Clenchwater who has a nursing
home by the sea in Bournemouth. I will give you a letter of
introduction. He will take you in and effect a cure."
     "Alas, Dr. Watson, I have not the money for such a treatment."
     "Do not worry," said Holmes, "I think we can take care of that."
     "Certainly. Certainly," said the Captain.
     "Could you leave your ship long enough to escort Miss Sorensen
to Bournemouth, Captain? There is a four o'clock train from
Waterloo today."
     "I should be delighted to be of service. My first officer will
take care of the ship until I return."
     "I will give Miss Sorensen a mild sedative to steady her for the
journey until she can reach the care of Clenchwater," said I.
     "Then, Captain, you and Miss Sorensen should stay and take a
bite for lunch and then go on to Bournemouth as soon as
possible," said Holmes, ringing the bell for Mrs. Hudson.

     After our guests had departed, Holmes said: "That lady was very
lucky," and picked up his violin. Soon he was engrossed in a
series of melancholy improvisations upon a theme.

     All that remains for me to say is that six months later, Captain
James Croaker and Miss LaVada Sorensen were married. They now
live at Hambledon, in the county of Hampshire and have two sons
and a daughter.

<a name="15">Subject: PCI Show, St Louis, MO</a>

I just returned from the PCI show in St Louis and thought I'd take a
couple of minutes to type up a brief trip report.  I'm sure others will
cover the event in greater detail, but some may find this of some
interest.
  
Military life causes me to travel a great deal--and enables me to visit
far-flung tobacconists--but until now my travels had never brought me to 
the correct place and time to attend a major show.  Unfortunately, I was 
only able to drive over for Saturday, so I missed the Organization of 
Online Pipe Smokers (OOPS) smoker Friday evening.  Craig Tarler must have 
sent 25 pounds of tobacco as his contribution, and "Dr. Ray" and gang made a 
valiant effort to finish it off.  They failed in this task (leaving
more than enough to maintain a pipe "filling station" Saturday), but did
manage to set off the smoke detector.  I am disappointed to have missed 
this particular bit of excitement &lt;G&gt;.
   
It was very exciting to be able to meet face-to-face with folks I had
previously known only from e-mail exchanges, letters, and telephone
calls.  Several PD and a.s.p denizens were in attendance, and I am
pleased to report that they are--without exception--as nice in person as
they are online.  It was also a pleasure to be able to meet Nikos Levin,
Jack Ehrmantraut, Bob Hamlin, Roswitha Anderson, and several folks I
knew only by reputation.  My firmly held opinion that pipe smokers are
the best people ramains unshaken.
   
I went to the show with the intent of purchasing an Ashton (I didn't
have one) and a 1963 Dunhill (for some strange egocentric reason, I have 
always craved a pipe made during my birth year), and I was able to achieve 
both goals.
   
I was shopping for a Dunhill shell, as I prefer their looks and the
price is usually right.  While going over the tables, however, I picked
up a beautiful straight grain--a "DRC".  I was turning the little pipe 
over in my hands, admiring it, when I noticed that there was a "3" after 
"England".  I believe in fate, so after some protracted dickering (which 
included the addition of a Dunhill folding tamper to the bargain) I walked 
away with my first Dunhill Dead Root and my "birthday pipe" at a very
good price.
    
I bought the Ashton (actually a "Taylor Made") from Dennis Congos of the 
Carolina Briar Friars.  Dennis visited Bill Taylor in 1990 and Bill made 
this pipe for him.  Dennis selected the bowl, and Bill hand-cut the brindled 
vulcanite stem for him on the spot.  It is a huge, gorgeous, thick-walled 
pipe with a marvelous straight grain, reminiscent of an old Charatan 
freehand.  I showed the pipe to Bob Hamlin, and he is of the opinion that 
the bowl was turned by Sid Cooper.  The pipe cannot have been smoked a dozen 
times and still retains its original finish.  The fact that I know the story 
behind the pipe makes owning it even more enjoyable.
   
I drove back to Leavenworth, Kansas (my very temporary home) a very happy 
man and look forward to attending next year's show in Dallas (only three
hours from my slightly less temporary home).  [Wonder if I can get the
Army to send me to Virginia for the C.O.R.P.S. show... &lt;G&gt;]

<a name="16">Subject: Response to hookah experience</a>

Steve:
    I just thought that I would relate to the good people of PD how my 
experience with the hookah that I just got in last week went. First, I 
ordered the largest one in stock from the Haight-Ashbury Tobacco Center 
in San Francisco. It turned out to be about three feet in height. I also 
ordered some little disks of charcoal and the tobacco that usually goes 
with it. The tobacco is from Egypt and India and is extremely wet-my 
guess is that it is soaked in molasses and other flaovoring is added in. 
The stuff will not ignite unless you place one of the charcoal disks on 
top of the little mound. I filled the glass bottom with water and a 
little bit of some Lebanese liquor called "arak". Placing the top part on 
and sealing the connection with the rubber gasket provided, I inserted 
the hose and tested for leaks. There were none. I put a small amount of 
the apricot -flavored Egyptian tobak on the ceramic plug on top along 
with a charcoal disk. The little disk throws off quite a bit of sparks 
when it first ignites but then settles down to a nice hot glow. Smoking 
this thing involved drawing on the hose which produced a vacuum in the 
glass, causing the smoke from the burning leaf to be drawn down into the 
water/arak solution. The smoke then bubbled up into the container where I 
was able to access it with the hose. The smoke was very cool and had a 
hint of the arak taste. All in all, a different experience which I intend 
on exploring further.

<a name="19">Subject: Calabash and Meerschaum questions</a>

A few years ago when my great uncle passed away I came across a pipe
collection of his that no one knew he had.  There were only about 6 or so
pipes: one a Digby bulldog, one from a state park in Ky., one with a carved
monkey face on it (!), and another with a broken mouthpiece that had a club
on the shank of the pipe.  However, the two pipes that caught my attention
was an old calabash pipe with a porcelain bowl, and  the largest carved
meerschaum I have ever seen in real life. Larger than my fist, it is a
carving of a woman holding up a flower, which is the bowl of the pipe.  It is
a precolored meerschaum and the manufacturer's label on the inside of the
case is called "WDC -  genuine meerschaum". My questions are these:  while
the pipes seem in good condition in terms of stem and body of the pipes, I am
unable to get a good draw off of the calabash due to the cork being either
rotted or worn away from years of use.  Can calabash pipes be recorked or
refitted to provide a better draw?  Additionally, the draw on the meerschaum
is not very good and the stem on this pipe appears to have been replaced at a
later date (black vulcanite).  Can this too be reconditioned to a smokable
order, and can old amber stems be replaced on to old meerschaum pipes? If any
of these pipes can be reconditioned, where can it be done, and should I even
smoke them due to their age and possible value? Finally, has anyone ever
heard of the abovementioned meerschaum company so I could get an approximate
date and value on this meerschaum pipe?  I know these are  a LOT of
questions, but I feel that these two pipes are among the most interesting in
my collection, if not the most valuable, and would like to gather any info
about their repair and history from the any readers of Pipe Digest if there
is any information to give.  Thanks a million for your time, and happy
smoking.

[ I'd suggest getting in touch with Jim Cooke about the repair, unless
anyone knows of a calabash expert. Good luck! -S. ]

[PIPE] Just got a mailing from Mr. Clive Humm of The Pipe Club of
London (9 Frances Street, Chesham Buckinghamshire HP5 3EQ ENGLAND;
phone 01494 771159), which seems to have a very worthwhile and active
group. Says Mr. Humm: "Our name is damn silly, because the club has
grown a little bit since the early days -- we now have hundreds of
members all over the world, from Brazil to Taiwan! ... Naturally, we
have some U.S. members -- but come on guys, the more the merrier!"
Sounds like a worthwhile group, for Digest members in the UK and
elsewhere! 

And I hope the members will forgive me for not getting an issue out in
two weeks; things have been busy here, with a trip to sunny Florida,
house painting, etc.  But now, whether you're at home like me or on
the road like Charlie Jewell, relax, light up, and we'll try to bring
you up to date...

<a name="2">Subject:       Re: Pipes Digest #191 - May 31, 1995</a>

Hello Steve and all readers of Pipes Digest:

I am enjoying the digest and thought I would contribute some 
thoughts.  I do not intend for my opinions to offend any readers.  
After all, the peace of smoking a pipe is one of a number of reasons 
to smoke, and I wish to promote, not discourage pipe smoking.

I don't smoke my pipes every day, and I sometimes let more than a 
week go by without smoking.  The idea that smoking a pipe might ever 
become a habit is repugnant to me.  I like moderation.  I never smoke 
if I am irritated or stressed out.  Smoking a pipe for me is a treat 
that is for when I am already relaxed and interested in playing with 
the smoke, not using the smoke to make me relax.  I do not inhale my 
tobacco's smoke.  I feel that inhaling smoke from any tobacco 
smoking medium is completely unnecessary and dangerous.  

Of course, nicotine is absorbed through the tissues of the tongue and 
the mouth in general and the blood stream will carry it around the 
rest of the body, but the damage to the lung tissue is avoided by not 
inhaling smoke.

This is a moderate view that, in my opinion, most cigarette smokers 
miss out on.  Let me state once again that my views are not 
directed in judgement of smokers of cigarettes, but to the spirit 
of addiction that _cigarette manufacturers_ cultivate.  The 
manufacturers of cigarettes have a business based on addiction to, 
not necessarily enjoyment of, tobacco.  They hope all people in the 
world will smoke and increase their use of cigarettes, and never 
stop.  The modern factory rolled cigarette is made for rapid 
consumption and for easy disposal of the carcass.  

The cultivation of patience as an attribute of smokers in the 
recruiting smokers is considered contrary to the sales of cigarettes. 
Cigarette manufactures want you to want their product NOW, not care 
what is in the product, use a lot of it, and never stop.  I believe 
that this aesthetic of rushing to get a cigarette prevents 
the enjoyment of tobacco.  The beauty of _choosing_--making the day's 
choice of the smoking instrument, choosing the tobacco for the 
instrument, choosing the place to smoke, choosing the tobacco to 
smoke--these choices are missing for most cigarette smokers. 

The evidence is that most cigarette smokers cannot tell you what kind 
of tobacco is in their cigarettes or where it comes from.  This is a 
very sad condition for which I believe there is no cure except 
through reducation.

We as a people must be willing to see smoking not as an evil to be 
avoided, but as a pleasure to be reconsidered in the light of peace 
and generosity, not tension and greed.

Of course there are some cigarette smokers who are able to be 
moderate in their enjoyment, but not many because of the greed of 
cigarette manufacturers and the trusting nature of smokers.

Now on to some ideas which I hope will show my support of pipe 
smoking.  I smoke nine of my dozen or so pipes.  My favorite smoke is 
Balkan Sobranie standard mixture in my calabash with the meerschaum 
bowl.  I also like Three Nuns and some of the cavendish mixtures from 
Georgetown Tobacco and the Centennial mixture from Milan Brothers in 
Roanoke, Virginia.

It took me a while to learn the rate at which to draw smoke so as to 
avoid getting too juicy or hot.  The cultivation of patience, again 
is one of the joys of smoking a pipe.

Wishing you all peace,

Steve - got a question - when I take trips for several days or even
weeks I would like to take cigars with me - how do I keep them fresh??
I really don't want to take my humidor - what do you suggest.  Are
there small humidors out there - travel ones that will keep the cigars
secure??  Thanks, Jack

[ There are pocket cigar cases, and travel humidors available; I think
CA did an article on them a few issues back. Of course, there are
aalways Tupperdors... -S. ]

<a name="4">Subject: "Pipe Friendly" used pipe summary</a>

Dear PD readers:  I've been a pipe smoker since '61 and an
enthusiast/hobbyist/pipe seller since '77.  Currently, I'm proprietor of a
tobacco shop in S.F., and as such would have been content to sit on the
sidelines and smile as I read each edition of PD, to which I just subscribed
(it was cheap enough).  However, a recent occurrence in the heart of our
hobby compels me to not only introduce myself, but to inflict my opinions on
the readership.
     In Joel Farr's new magazine, "Pipe Friendly," is a summary of the used
pipe (we in the business prefer the euphimistic "Estate Pipe") market by PCI
(Pipe Collectors International) owner Jack Ehrmantraut.  Jack sells used
pipes via a popular mailer and thus has some insight to that market.  He also
exhibits the same types of biases,  aberrant perceptions and miscalculations
as do the rest of us.  Unfortunately, some of those egregious flaws surfaced
in what I consider to be a most irresponsible manner in his pipe summary as
printed by "Pipe Friendly".  And before the less experienced readership of PD
take Jack's (or anybody's...except mine, of course) musings as gospel,
certain dubious assertions  need to be addressed by a third party.  
     The boldest error (in many people's opinion, believe me) was Jack's
advice to "avoid" pipes made by Larry Roush.  You'd have no trouble doing
that in my shop because we're all sold out of Roush pipes and are eagerly
awaiting any more that Larry cares to grace us with.  And any used Roush
pipes that, on the rare occasion, become available are immediately scarfed by
our knowing clientele.  In short, no astute observation of the U.S. pipe
scene could come to the conclusion that Roush pipes are anything but
desirable.
     When asked by Steve Richman (owner of The Piedmont Tobacconist and
importer of Esoterica Tobacciana tobaccos) how he could make such an
inflammatory statement about Roush pipes, Jack  admitted that he's never
smoked a Roush pipe.  He said that his summary doesn't address the smoking
and production values of a pipe, simply it's collectible and resale value as
he sees it.   
Steve's immediate response to that disingenuous statement was "I'll take all
those slow selling Roush's you have lying around off your hands."  No comment
ensued.
     Another proper response to Jack's assertion would have been, "since when
is a pipe merchant equipped to offer investment advice instead of smoking
advice."  Any pipe purchaser who buys pipes for investment instead of smoking
is a sucker and deserves to be taken.  And any tobacconist that sells his
wares as a good investment is a charlatan (pre-Lane). 
     Talking about Charatans, more investment advice from this tobacco
merchant came in the form of advice to avoid Charatans below Distinction
grade because those low end Charatans should "only be purchased for smoking."
 Say What?  What the hell are we about?  I thought finding and sharing info
on good smokes was our main focus.  For investment advice I feel much more
comfortable being screwed by my Merrill Lynch counselor.  
     Another very, very questionable tidbit of investment advice was offered
freely (and well worth the cost) in his suggestion to Mike Butera that he
"needs to produce some pipes or collector demand will wane."  Not from people
who want a piece of art that smokes great will interest wane.  
     Re-reading Jack's summary, I see very little factual info and a lot of
personal opinion.  There's nothing wrong with personal opinion...but in an
area as metaphysical and subjective as pipes, opinion shouldn't be offered as
fact.  And in a hobby as small and precarious and vulnerable as ours,
restraint should be applied by a person in position to damage the reputation
of hard working, honest, devoted and highly skilled craftsmen.  
     Since Jack, probably by his own admission, is not a man of subtlety,
diplomacy or tact, he can't be expected not to voice his own opinion, and his
straight ahead style might be much appreciated by his customers, the readers
of the PCI Newsletter, wherein the summary first appeared.  That, after all,
is Jack's personal organ and a good place for him to vent those opinions.  I
like receiving the newsletter and hope to continue to receive it.
     But publishing rash opinions as fact in a general circulation mag
demands attention to responsibility.  Had Jack reflected on the hurt his
opinions (or observations) can create in the hobby he might have  tempered
his language.   
     The publisher of "Pipe Friendly," Joel Farr, is an absolute novice in
the world of used/collectible pipes, else he might have exercised some
editorial restraint in publishing these already once used articles in his
maiden issue.  Joel is, however, educable and enthusiastic and needs to be
applauded for his effort.  The magazine needs to be supported by our kind and
I have subscribed.
     To pound the death out of the central theme here, please defer to your
own opinion and personal experience on your likes and dislikes.
There are no authorities when it comes your taste except yourself.

[ I can see this will generate some controversy... -S. ]

<a name="6">Subject: Pipes--Testing Before You Buy</a>

Steve, regarding the letter from Karl Leeds in #191 about wanting to feel
the pipe in his mouth before buying, I think he was treated rather
shabbily by the pipe store salesman.  I worked part time at Barclay Pipe
and Tobacco in Columbus for several years, and we did everything possible
to make our customers happy, especialy first-time pipe buyers.
Granted, you can't let people put pipes in their mouths and perhaps mark
them, and most buyers are satisfied just to hold the pipe.  However, for
those who weren't, we carried a large supply of the thick rubber-band type
things (they were like 3 for a quarter) that many pipe smokers who tend to
chew up their bits use on all their pipes.  If somebody wanted to test a
pipe in the mouth, we would give them one of these things and let them
test away.  If your pipe shop doesn't carry them, find one that does and
carry one with you whenever you think you might buy a pipe.  I can't
imagine anyone refusing to let you use it to hold a pipe in your mouth.

If you've got one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you've got more than
one, you're a pipe collector.

[ Quite a few of our readers have made this comment, Bill. I hope the
word gets back to Connoisseur. And see Karl's letter later in this
issue.  -S. ]

<a name="7">Subject:       Intro</a>

Thanks for including me in your digest! As suggested, I'm writing a 
brief introduction:

I'm a 26 year-old cigar smoker who is about to make a move to pipes. 
I currently smoke a variety of cigars, being in a cigar o' the week 
club at my local shoppe, and have come to prefer Thomas Hinds and 
La Uncia - feedback about other brands with similar qualities will be 
appreciated.

I purchased my first pipe just yesterday from Andrea's in Kenosha - I 
highly reccomend the shop for both cigar and pipe needs. Mr. Andrea 
himself assisted me in chosing a pipe, tobak and tamper. He patiently 
explained how pipes are made, showed me a half-finished bowl given to 
him by Mr. Savinelli (but maybe knowledgeable old tobbacconists like 
to pull the legs of young non-knowledgeable smokers) and explained 
the care and feeding of my new pipe.  

If you are get to southeastern Wisconsin, the shop is Andrea's and is 
located at 60th Street and 24th Ave. I beleive they do mail order, 
I'll try to remember to post the address/phone in the near future.

Sorry for rambling (now I understand why the digests are so long!) 
and, I believe this is understood, edit at will!

<a name="8">Subject: Comfortable Pipe Fit!?</a>

Hi Steve:

One of your subscribers wrote about trying to try a pipe out for fit and
looks.

&gt;I asked Ed if I would be permitted to
&gt;place the pipe in my mouth. He flatly said NO due to "my safety and that of
&gt;his other customers". I told him that I wanted to see how it felt. His
&gt;response was "Would I make a bit that was not comfortable?" Is it common not
&gt;to allow a customer the option of seeing how a pipe feels prior to it's
&gt;purchase? He barely allowed me to hold it and look at it.

I would suggest that he inform his tobacconist of his displeasure in the way
he handles customers. It sounds like the tobacconist has a flippant attitude
that will eventually drive business away! A "comfortable bit for him" may not
be comfortable to me. In small shops we have to understand that the people
running the business often times have a lot of things that need to get done
business wise, and this might not allow a lot of time to BS with a customer.
However... if I'm buying, I want your undivided attention, hoe do you know
I'm not going to turn around and buy that $600.00 Tsuge? All-in-all, a
tobocconist should allow you to handle a pipe as much as you need to in order
to find flaws such as sand pits, fills, scratches, etc. As far as trying the
pipe out for fit... any good tobacconist will have "pipe prophylactics,"
small plastic or cellophane sleeves that fit over the pipe stem. These are
provided so that a customer can "see" what the pipe looks like when held to
the face. It is not intended for a person to chomp down on the bit though!
That would not be proper! Again... it's just to slip the pipe in the mouth
while holding it to get a good look. As a matter of fact, a good tobacconist
will have a counter top mirror similar to one found in jewlery or eyeglass
stores just so that you can take a look.

I carry a few "pipe prophylactics" in my wallet : ) ; ) because you never
know when you'll drop by your tobbaconist and see that pipe you can't live
without! If a tobacconist doesn't have these pipe sleeves, you can make one.
Buy a small ring gauge cigar from the tobacconist (he'll/she'll like that,)
remove the cigar and then cut about an inch from the top of the cellophane
wrapper down... now you have a custom made "pipe prophylactic" to slip over
the pipe bit!

Just my two cents.

<a name="9">Subject: Pipes: Smoking and Driving</a>

Steve, I'm slowly reading back issues, and I recently got the discussion
of how do you tamp your pipe, etc. while driving.  I think we should all be
aware of the hazards of smoking while driving--not paying attention to the
road ahead of or behind you while fiddling with your pipe, dropping the
whole pipe or hot ashes into your lap and having a lit object near if an
accident occurs and gasoline is spilled.  Well, here's a new one.  An OPC
member has drawn my attention to and provided me with a copy of an article
called "Airbag Deployment and Eye Perforation by a Tobacco Pipe" in Vol.
38, No. 4, pp. 498-501 of _The Journal of Trauma: Injury, Infection, and
Critical Care._
The 51-year-old driver of a BMW 750 skidded on a patch of ice and struck a
guard rail, deploying his airbag.  The driver was apparently holding his
pipe in his hand (his teeth were undamaged).  The airbag forced the bowl
of the pipe along his face, producing abrasions and slight burns.  The bit
and part of the stem snapped off and were driven into his eye, which could
not be saved.  Enough said, I think.

If you've got one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you've got more than
one, you're a pipe collector.
Bill Unger
Secretary, Ohio Pipe Collectors

[ Gruesome, Bill... although IMHO this counts as a freak accident,
it'd probably be safer to smoke a cigar if you have airbags... But
wasn't there once a small hose pipe with magnets, specially made for
smoking while driving?  One would clamp it to the dashboard and puff
away in safety. -S. ]

<a name="10">Subject: World No-Smoking Day</a>

Hello to all,

   As some of you may have heard, the World Health Organization decreed 
that there was to be a World No-Tobacco Day I supose it was either to 
save us from ourselves, or an attempt to put many of the farmers in North 
Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee and other such states out of business.  I 
hope that some of my experiences on that fateful day may be of a brief 
respite in an otherwise ordinary day.
   Okay, I usually smoke only 2-3 bowlfuls a day, those being in the 
afternoon/evening.  Upon hearing on the radio from some Treehugger that 
tobacco in all forms is bad, evil, etc.  I lit up.  So I don't offend the 
wrong people, my definition of Treehugger is a person that tries to tell 
me how to live my own life, with an obvious exception being a doctor.
   Suffice it to say, I enjoyed a bowl with several friends during every 
break that we could conjure, much to the dismay of the WHO.  Now, usually 
I smoke my pipe in a quite place, shade preferrable, and people usually 
walk by and say, "Hey, that smells good."  Not this day.  I did pick my 
usual out of the way spot, but I was confronted angrilly a number of 
times by people that I feel have no business telling me what to do.
   I am not usually a combative person, prefering just to listen to the 
tirades of others, catalogue their thoughts and walk calmly away.  Well, 
this being an out of sorts day, I had the chance to blow smoke in a 
person's face.  Not really my fault, she was practically nose to pipe 
with me, and I had to breath.
   I did manage to mak it to the tobacco store in the afternoon to find 
it packed with people of a similar mind as my own.  A fairly large group 
of us sat on a bench outside the store and produced such a pile of ash 
that I've never seen!  What a day!
   I almost thank the good old World Health Organization for providing me 
with such an eventful (and mostly enjoyable) day.
   Did anyone else experince the blind stupidity of others or was I the 
only one?

Thanks for reading my rantings,
Shawn

[ Well, Shawn, I personally think that the term "treehugger" is a bit
perjorative; one can love both trees and tobaccco. In any case, I'd
like to know when the WHO is going to stage this, so we can organize
our own World Smoke-In for Freedom, or Know Tobacco Day.  Better names
welcome... -S. ]

<a name="13">Subject: Greetings, Everyone</a>

I'm a 28 year old graduate student who's been smoking cigars since a 1992
Christmas trip to London. I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Albania when a
friend of mine got me interested in Cuban cigars. Therefore, while I was on
the trip, I purchased a Montecristo No. 2 and sat down with a pint of bitter
in the Salisbury, a pub near Trafalgar Square. I enjoyed it immensely. After
that, I used every trip out of the country as a chance to try more Cubans. I
also got into pipes, mainly because the Albanians produce a number of fine
hand-carved briar woods, none of which cost more than five dollars. I'm
little more than a casual pipe smoker, but I do enjoy an occasional bowl. 

In the No-Smoking section war I consider myself a conscientious objector. I
don't mind not being able to smoke in my favorite restaurants. I usually
prefer to spread out on the grass in the park with a nice Churchill or sit at
home with a good book. I do, however, despise cigarette smokers who think
their cig doesn't stink. I recently went into a bar and was met by bluish
smoke to my knees, but when I lit up--on the veranda no less--I earned sharp
glares and a "P. U." from a group of chain-smoking menthol-mouths at a
nearby, upwind table. I just smiled and enjoyed my Arturo Fuente. 

I'm also pleased to say I introduced my last girlfriend to cigars. After
hanging around me a couple months, she developed a taste for Dunhill
Condados. We even did our own two-person smokers' night in the lobby of the
Peabody Hotel in Memphis. (Which, incidentally, is cigar friendly, even in
some of the rooms.) We dressed up in our Sunday-best and were eventually
joined by another cigar smoking couple who were encouraged to light up after
they saw us. She and I are no longer together, but she still smokes cigars.

Anyway, I'm looking for other Kansas smokers, and for some Mississippi
smokers. (I'm currently in Kansas, but I'm a graduate student at the
University of Mississippi.) I'm especially interested in tobacconists in
Wichita or Topeka. If anyone knows of any, please drop me a line. I've
enjoyed PD so far, and hope it keeps going long and strong.

Yours sincerely,

&gt;4. Cigarretes seem to have a bad name around here but I've been
&gt;handrolling them lately with Three Castles or American Spirit (pure

&gt;American Spirit is selling manufactured cigarettes with their natural

&gt;tried rolling with an aromatic pipe tobacco but that was a bit much.
&gt;The RB/Cherry blend almost worked, maybe an American Spirit &amp; Cherry
&gt;would really work.

American Spirit also makes straights, but I find that their tobacco lacks 
the flavor of Threee Castles.  Stokebye (spelling?) also makes a fine cut 
aromatic with a pistachio and vanilla casing that works well for hand-rolling.

<a name="20">Subject: [PIPES]</a>

Hello, Steve!

Just some miscellaneous ruminations:

First of all, I was quite surprised to read Karl Leeds' (?????????@???.???)
note in the last Digest regarding his inability to try out a particular
pipe (hold it in his mouth) to see how it felt.  Every pipe shop that I've
ever been to around here keeps a supply of "pipe slips" on hand which are
essentially little tiny plastic bags that slip over the bit to allow a
customer to hold the pipe in his/her mouth while protecting the bit from
saliva and teeth marks (of course, it's only common courtesy to refrain
from chomping down with all one's might).  It's been common for me to use a
pipe slip to try out three or four pipes (usually in front of a mirror)
before making my final selection.

My most recent pipe purchase was a pipe carved by hand by local craftsman,
Paul Peri.  Two weeks ago I attended my first meeting of the Southwest Pipe
and Cigar League (having heard about it from the pages of the Digest), and
Paul was on hand displaying a dozen or so pipes that he recently carved.
Most were very large--larger, in fact, than I normally prefer, but one was
just my size.  It's in a Dublin shape with a straight stem, and what a
delightful pipe it is!  And what a bargain!!  It's lightweight with very
nice grain; it smokes cool and stays lit.  My main problem is a tendency to
want to smoke it all the time without giving it a chance to rest (but I
force myself--I don't want to risk ruining it).  I'm already saving up to
buy another one.

Three or four weeks back I bought a tin of Escudo tobacco primarily because
I've read so many good things about it here in the Digest.  This was my
first experience with tobacco that came in slices instead of ready rubbed
and initially I had trouble rubbing it out consistently--one time it would
smoke well, the next time I could hardly keep it lit.  So I finally took a
kitchen knife to it, chopping it up to an even consistency.  Since then
things have gone much more smoothly.  I must say I do like it--it's quite
unlike anything else I've ever smoked.  However, I'm not yet sure that I
like it $8.30 per 50 grams worth.  I'm about half-way through the tin, so
I'll reserve final judgement until the last bowl.

Finally, a quote I picked up recently taken from Charles Lamb's "A Farewell
to Tobacco":
   For you, Tobacco, I
   Would do anything but die.

Steve:

In Digest 191, Karl Leeds (????????@???.???) talked about not being able to
hold a pipe in his mouth at the shop to try it for balance.

The hygeine point is valid. But to buy a pipe without testing it for
weight, heft and -- let's be honest -- appearance is about as sensible as
buying a jacket without trying it on.  ("Would I sell you a jacket which
didn't fit, Sir?")

Which is why, in my experience, every halfway-decent pipe shop has little
disposable plastic sleeves to slip over the bit when a customer wants to
try a pipe.

It might be worth Karl recommending these to Ed at Conoisseur.

<a name="22">Subject: Self-Introduction</a>

I'd like to introduce myself to the rest of you on this mailing list.  
Having smoked cigarettes (usually Marlboro, with the occasional Dunhill) at 
a moderate pace for about 15 years, I recently switched to a pipe at the 
advice of a retired painting restorer from England who was living in the 
small New England town of Essex, by the Atlantic.  I was in Essex on holiday 
and waiting for my wife at the pub in the Griswold Inn (the oldest 
continuously operating inn in the United States, by the way) and had noticed 
Jeff puffing reflectively on his pipe while pulling intermittently on a 
fresh pint of Guiness.  I had done without a cigarette for the better part 
of a week, as my wife objects quite strenuously to my smoking cigarettes in 
her presence, and no doubt my first thought was that it was too bad this 
fellow had no cigarettes that I could quickly light up, but perhaps I should 
stroll over and say hello anway.  After we met and exchanged our views about 
nuclear terrorism, the national economy,  the O.J. trial and so forth, the 
talk turned to important subjects and Jeff told me that I could probably 
quit smoking cigarettes by taking up a pipe, that I would like it much 
better, and that my wife would doubtless feel the same way as, in his 
experience, many women who wrinkled their noses at cigarettes were attracted 
to the aroma of a pipe.  We discussed why this was, and I recall some 
theories about the daddies who smoked pipes and the whole thing was getting 
vaguely Freudian when my wife walked in.  First she gave me that searching 
look that sweeps over every finger and any nearby ashtray for signs of a 
burning cigarette or a hastily extinguished butt.  Then she approached and, 
I assume, was preparing to give me the accusatory contraband-sniffing test, 
when she suddenly saw, or smelled, Jeff and his pipe.  My wife veered toward 
him, sparing me a public bloodhounding, and, through a beatific smile, she 
said to me "John, I think you should start smoking a pipe".  As always, I 
did her bidding.

This was about a month ago, and I now smoke a Peterson No. 303 purchased in 
Boston, which was the next stop in that vacation trip.  I have not smoked, 
nor particularly desired, a cigarette since, and in a recent kayaking trip 
off the Baja coast when we were all cold and wet I learned that a warm pipe 
is considerably more comforting than a soggy cigarette.  My interests, at 
this point, are learning more about pipes and pipe tobaccos, locating an 
upcoming  pipe show (are there such things?) in the Los Angeles area, and 
locating a good tobacconist in or near the Glendale/Pasadena area.  To the 
extent such things can be answered by the FAQ and Resource Guide, I will 
inquire there in the near future.

Nice to meet you all, and I look forward to participating in this mailing list.

Steve:

I recently was in Philadelphia and had an opportunity to stop into Holt's new
cigar store on Walnut Street.  The store is very upscale with a posh smoking
room trimmed in leather and expensive wood paneling.  The store itself has a
good selection of premium and super premium cigars.  I took the occasion to
treat myself to an Avo Pyramid and enjoyed it in their smoking room.  They
have a cappuccino machine (that was not working at the time) and lockers for
those who want a place to store their smokes.  The walls were lined with
displays of high end humidors.  In all it was a very enjoyable experience to
relax in a friendly environment with a fine cigar.

I have had the pleasure of visiting Bloom Cigar Company in Pittsburgh.  The
smoking room at Bloom's is more reminiscent of a college fraternity room both
in atmosphere and in furnishings.  At Bloom's the patrons were all engaged in
lively discussion and I almost felt as though I was at the gentlemens'
gathering place, like the corner drug store or diner, of a small town. 

The contrast between Holt's and Bloom's was dramatic in that Holt's was more
of a quiet sanctuary with a focus on cigars and smoking while Bloom's was
more of a local watering hole with a focus on fellowship and good fun.

If any of the PD readers are in the Pittsburgh or Philadelphia I would urge
them to visit these establishments.

<a name="24">Subject: Salutations and Introduction</a>

Well, I finally have a moment to submit my introduction.  First, though, let
me offer my thanks for the reading enjoyment and information I've gotten from
the issues I've been Emailed and downloaded from the FTP site (makes a fairly
sizeable volume in hard copy!).

I'm a 40+ year older and I make my living as an electrical engineer at a firm
in Huntsville, Alabama.  At night I transform into a graduate student in
counseling psychology.

I first smoked a pipe over 20 years ago and, for reasons I can't recall, put
my limited collection away in storage until earlier this year.  At work, a
friend of mine (and a fellow subscriber to this mail list ----- Hi Fritz!)
has a habit of enjoying a Friday afternoon bowl of tobacco (or a cigar).
  Well, being around that wonderful aroma awakened the urge in me, so I
crawled through the attic to rescue my old pipes.

My preference is for a full bent stem pipe, and I favor sweet aromatic blends
with a vanilla flavor.  I've enjoyed several ounces of a blend called Trade
Winds sold at my local pipe shop (The Humidor - Huntsville, AL) wonderful
vanilla aroma - nice flavorful smoke ----- but a definite tongue scorcher!
 I'll have to experiment with cutting it with something to cool it off.

I am currently breaking in a black full bent sandblasted Chacom and a
freestyle Knute using the honey method (haven't seen this mentioned here,
yet).  I guess the Knute is my favorite pipe at the moment -  feels good in
the hand.  My favorite utilitarian pipe is my first pipe, a straight stemmed
Willard that probably came with a pack of tobacco for a few dollars 20+ years
ago. 

I am currently obssessed with perusing through antique shops for "estate"
pipes.  I've found a few that I thought looked good and I'll post info here
about them at a later date for feedback on value and collectability.  Any
good hints on restoring these gems to good looking smokeables is appreciated!

This is getting lengthy, even though I've got a million more questions, I'll
stop for now -- one more I've got a Jobey Torino (full bent) that develops a
bad case of "slurpees" before the end of a bowl, any suggestions - different
insert, filter adaptation??????

The only response I got to my question about standard cigar sizes came 
from
{?????@???.???} who recommended Perelman's Pocket Cyclopedia of Cigars. 
[Thanks JB!]  On my way home from work last night, I stopped by the local 
cigar shop and was pleasantly surprised to find they had several copies 
of it on the shelf.  This year's edition is marked as only $7.95 so I 
picked up a Joya de Nicaragua Presidente as well.  My new purchase tells 
me that this is in the Double Corona group, for those who are interested. 
 When I got home, I found that my latest shipments from both club cigars 
had also arrived.  So there I sat with a bundle of 25 maduros 6 x 60, 
five samples of cigars with a ring gauge of 50, and my Presidente.  Oh 
the agony of a well stocked humidor!

For those of you who, like me, are still curious about the marriage of 
the name and the general size, here's a chart from Perelman's book.  He 
adapted it from Paul Garmirian's The Gourmet Guide to Cigars.  Since an 
experienced tobacconist should be able to provide similar information, I 
hope you will not consider it a violation of the copyright.

Shape                Length Range        Ring Range    Classic

And for those of you who like labels, here's another chart to give the 
general idea on cigar colors.  It, too, comes from Perelman's book but 
should common knowledge.  Never under estimate the knowledge of your 
local retailer!
With 70 colors, they probably have a better idea of where to steer you.

Name            Color
Candela         green, rarely found today
Double Claro    beige to green, also known as American Market Selection 
[AMS]
Claro           a very light tan to beige color, Connecticut
Natural         wide range of browns, aka English Market Selection [EMS]
Colorado Claro  medium brown common to many cigars
Colorado        reddish brown
Colorado Maduro   dark brown
Cameroon        darker brown, often associated w/ Honduras
Maduro          very dark brown, often associated w/ Nicaragua
Oscuro          black

The final bit of general information I'll pass on relates to 
construction.

filler          tobacco in the center, making up the bulk of the cigar
binder          leaf which holds the filler together

I would like to thank everyone who was kind enough to provide me with
information regarding my pipe purchase. I did return to the Connoisseur Pipe
Shop to view the pipes again. Upon a very detailed observation, I did
purchase the pipe. That evening, I smoked it three times. After each smoking,
I allowed the pipe to cool completely. After the third smoking, the stem
became horribly loose from the briar. I returned to the Connoisseur the very
next day. The pipe was repaired and returned the same day. I have been
smoking it since, and I am quite happy with my purchase.

Once again, thank you for your assistance.

?????????@???.???

P.S. I highly recommend the Connoisseur Pipe Shop's "Special Reserve"
tobacco. It's a bit costly at $57.00 per pound, but several ounces are worth
the investment and pleasure :~))

<a name="27">Subject: Santa Clara &amp; California Smoking Laws</a>

In reference to earlier comments about Santa Clara or other California
cities lifting bans on restaurant smoking: As I recall the Legislature
passed an all-encompassing bill banning smoking in all restaurants, except
in bars. In fact, cities and counties were mandated to designate an
enforcement agency for the law. I think it might even apply to charter
cities, because according to a L.A. Fire Department captain I know, his
agency was chosen as the L.A. city enforcer. Now, L.A. is a charter city,
but I'm not sure exactly how much the state can govern over them. The
constitution takes much authority over them away from Sacramento. Now, as
for general law cities and counties, hell, the Legislature could rub them
off the map if it wanted to, and they can certainly govern their policing
ability.

For now I don't think we're going to hear the phrare "Smoking or non,"
anytime soon, or ever again, in California. The law as I understand
superceded all local smoking bans.

<a name="28">Subject: Update from the road</a>

For those who might be confused about this otherwise, I'm on a cross country
trip and am reporting in on various little pipe related things that I come
across.  I'm also trying to meet PD subscribers, but haven't yet gotta to
any!

5/23 - 5/26 - I've had lot's of trouble getting connected with my email.  It
all started in Las Vegas (a town I was glad to see in the rear view mirror)
when I didn't feel like making the last 7 hour push one night to Tucson, so I
thought, since it had been several days sleeping in the pickup, with no
shower, "I'll splurge and get a hotel tonight.  I'll get a shower, make the
email connection, sleep good and hit it tomorrow."  I spread out all of my
computer stuff, only to find (to my horror) that a critical cable was gone.
 After several hours, which included some real agony at Radio Shack, I was
defeated.  When I got to Tucson, I used my friend's computer to send out some
short messages, including an SOS to my housesitter to Priority Mail my cable!
 To make it short (there were more gory details), I'm back up, but AOL
doesn't have very good DOS software (which I have to use because I've only
got an ancient 286 for portable use), so email is a real bear.  Forgive me if
my updates are less frequent than I had planned.

5/27/95 12:20 pm - Stopped at a "Whataburger" in Tucson and happened to see a
man walking in, smoking a well seasoned Meerschaum.  I stopped him and asked
about his pipe smoking (being the neophyte that I am), and he was good enough
to stop and talk to me, even as his burgers got cold in his "to-go" sack.
 He's been smoking for 25 years, and advised me to get a good quality
Meerschaum, and plan to spend around $100 for a good one.  Also, he smoked
Capt. Black in a white pouch.  Didn't get a chance to find out just which
mixture that would be.  Any hints out there?  He says that the smoke is good,
and doesn't cost too much.  I guess stopping people and just asking them
their preferences might turn out to be a valuable education!

06/05/95 4:03 pm - Stopped at a craft shop along the road, out in the middle
of nowhere, between Payson, Arizona and Show Low.  The shop is called the
"Lazy Hoss Gallery".  I met a one armed man there named Don Anderson.  He was
watching the store and wasn't real busy, being toward the end of the day.  I
stopped in more or less for a driving break.  Coming through Arizona from
Tempe on my way to Denver, Colorado, the mountain roads through the Tonto
National Forest are quite winding.  I noticed that he smoked a pipe and I
started talking with him about it.  He's been smoking a pipe for 49 years.
 He was originally from Maine, and I could hear a strong trace of the accent,
still.  He started smoking a pipe there, when he was about 11 years old.  He
started for various reasons, including the fact that he didn't like the smell
of cigarettes, but also due to his Swedish descent, where it was common for
the old guys to smoke a pipe.  I saw a white Capt. Black tobacco pouch
sitting on the counter, so I asked about it.  He said he's settled on it as
his standard tobacco, but as it turns out, he wasn't actually smoking Capt.
Jack today.  Apparently, he has found that Walgreen's sells a mixture called
Burley and Black that he says tastes just the same to him but at 1/2 the
price.  We talked about a number of subjects; his job as a camp ranger for 20
years for the Boy Scouts, his odd jobs across the country, times that he
travelled the country (like I'm doing), sometimes hopping boxcars.  A very
interesting man.  He had a funny quote.  He worked for a farmer some years
back, and the farmer had run out of work but didn't want to cut him loose.
 The farmer asked him if he'd mind being hired out to go do some rod weeding
in a neighboring wheat field until he came up with more work on his farm.  He
told the farmer, "Sure, it beats sittin' around."  When he met the other
farmer, the neighbor noticed that Don had a pipe in his pocket.  He said to
him, "You know, someone told me once, never to hire a man that smokes a pipe.
 Out of an 8 hour work day, you'll lose an hour while he stops to fiddle with
it."  He got hired anyway :)  I thanked him for the pleasant conversation, he
invited me back to visit again, and I was on my way.

06/05/95 5:32 pm - I'm sitting here at the top of the Mollogon Rim,
overlooking millions of acres of the Tonto Nat'l Forest.  What a site!  It's
quite beautiful.  As I gander, I'm enjoying a pipe of Dunhill 965 that I
found at the Tinderbox when I was in Tucson.  Since my local shop in
Kennewick, Washington doesn't carry it, my visit to the Tinderbox at the El
Con mall was the first chance to get some.  It was $5.20 for a 50 gram tin.
 It was a bear to open!  Any hints out there for my future tin openings?  My
first impressions aren't ecstatic, but enjoyable just the same.  I also got a
three pipe tools because they were only $1.25 and were much nicer (polished,
heavier) than what was available at home).  I'm off now to get closer to
Denver by the evening of 6/6.  More later.
 
06/05/95 7:31 pm - Not pipe related, but as I was passing through Holbrook,
AZ, my attention was caught, while driving, by the drums and chanting of a
Navajo dance display in the courtyard of a very old courthouse.  It was very
interesting and turned out to be a great diversion.  If you happen to be near
Holbrook, stop in the courthouse/museum.  It's very interesting.  There is an
ancient jail that was used as recently as 1976 that you can walk through,
complete with copious jailhouse graffiti.  Some interesting artwork!  Ended
up sleeping in the parking lot of the Petrified Forest National Park.  Not
the best of accomodations, but I survived.

06/06/95 7:30 pm - Today was a long and boring day of driving.  The trip
through New Mexico was interesting, seeing the adobe houses, and seeing for
the first time in my life, a cop with 3 people lying spread-eagle on the
pavement at the side of the road, and one with his hands up, facing away,
backing toward him.  Must have been a felony stop.  Later, by Albuquerque,
NM, I saw another cop putting handcuffs on an obviously chagrined man.  Not
too sure New Mexico is the greatest place to be.  As I approached Denver, I
decided it was time for a pipe.  It sure made the boring miles go by easier.
 Colorado is a beautiful state, but after 12 hours on the road, you start to
get a bit jaded.  When I actually got to Denver, I got hopelessly lost--
three times.  I finally made it to my friend's house in Lakewood, and will
try to get this uploaded to the PD and also try to arrange a meeting with
Steve Beaty!  He's about an hour north of here, I believe, so I'd really like
to see him if possible.  We'll see if we can work something out.

Note: After the 13th, I'll be on the open road, with no place to be until I
eventually hit Washington D.C.  If you have any advice on places to see, let
me know as I'd like to visit any interesting place you might suggest
(preferably low or no cost-- I'm on a tight budget).  Please email me
directly, for time's sake.  Of course, if you'd like to get together and
visit, I'd like that, too.  Tentatively, I'm thinking I6ll end up going
through Kansas after this, and pretty sure I'll be going through Tennessee.
 I6ll try to write again soon!

Dear Steve,

I hope I'm in the right place to ask to be on the mail list for the
pipe digest.  I had a very pleasant evening yesterday, reading all of
the old digests I had downloaded and smoking one of my favorite
briars.  By way of introduction, I am an American, living in Berlin,
Germany and working on my doctoral dissertation in theology.  I have
been smoking pipes for about 8 years now.  My current favorite
tobaccos are: Bell's Three Nuns Tobacco, None Nicer, Stanwell's Rose &amp;
the Crown, and a mystery English mixture, the name of which I have
completely forgotten but that has been sitting in my tobacco jar for
some time.  As far as pipes go, I'm a big fan of Dunhill, but just
can't seem to afford them right now, otherwise I like Italian pipes -
Castello, Savinelli, Brebbia etc.  Well, keep up the good work, happy
pipe dreams!!!  Dave Roberts ??????.????@??????????.???

I wanted to write to see if anyone knew how to tighten up loose stems on
pipes.  I had a bag of pipes in the backseat of my car that I had forgotten
about for a few days.  When I finally found them, the mouthpieces on all of
them were loose and a couple of them had the bend melted out of them, from
either the sunlight or the heat or a combination of both (including my
favorite Charatan - drags).  Does anyone know of a way to get the stems
tightened back up without having to replace the stem entirely?  I have heard
of people using burners of some sort to achieve theis but I don't want to try
that until I get more info on it.  Any information about this would be deeply
appreciated.  Thanks!

<a name="32">Subject: Parker Pipes</a>

I read a message asking about the origins of Parker Pipes, I can't remember
whether it was here or in alt.smokers.pipes so I will post the following to
both.  The usual disclaimers apply with the following being reproduced with
the permission of Mr John Campbell, of Alfred Dunhill.  He is interested
with any and all comments although he is not, as yet, on the Net.

--

The name Alfred Dunhill is synonymous with excellance.  Today the company
enjoys a worldwide reputation for its range of high quality luxury goods. 
The company's origins, however, were most humble, having originally been
founded to sell accessories to enthusiasts of the increasingly popular motor
car.

In 1893 Alfred Dunhill took over his father's business, which was as a maker
of tarpaulin, shop blinds and accessories for horse drawn vehicles, and
transformed it into a supplier of accessories for the motor car driver.

In 1904 Alfred Dunhill's innovative mind produced a brilliant idea, which
was to become a milestone for the company.  It was on the 21st of November,
1904, from 29 Broadleaf Gardens, Hampstead, that he filed patent application
number 25,261 for the now famous "Windshield Pipe".

The Windshield pipe was Alfred Dunhill's first foray into pipe making.  The
pipe was designed so as to stop ash and tobacco being blown onto the smoker
and was ideal for sportmen, motorists and sailors, as well as for everyday
use.

Shortly after this, Alfred Dunhill left the motorities business and opened
up a tobacconist shop at 31a Duke Street, St James's, London SW1.  This
location accorded with his resolution in 1907 to be a high-class supplier of
tobaccos, cigars, cigarettes and smokers' requisites to gentlemen.

Iniatally Alfred Dunhill bought pipes wholesale to sell in his shop. 
However, he was dissatisfied with the quality and in 1910 he opened up two
rooms on the top floor of 28 Duke Street as a pipe workshop.  He knew he
could produce better quality, handcrafted pipes than were on offer to him
from his contemporaries.

The first Dunhill pipes were sold in the shop at 7s 6d and immediately
became popular with the 'officer class'. 

( Shillings and pence refers to the currency used in the UK prior to
decimilisation in the late 1960's.  At current value 7s 6d would be 37p or
59 US cents. )

In March 1912 aluminium inner tubes for Dunhill pipes were patented and were
sold at one shilling for a packet of six.  However, some customers could not
tell which way the hand-cut vulcanite mouthpiece fitted back into the pipe,
a problem which was overcome by Alfred Dunhill placing a white sopt on the
upper side of the nouthpiece, and thus a world famous trademark was created.

Also in 1912 the pipe making unit was moved to nearby 6 Masons Yard.  At
this time a gas driven machine for stoving pipes was introduced, which led
to the invention of the famous Dunhill Shell Briar, patented in 1917.

( In order to produce this finish, two grades of microscopic sized glass
balls are blasted, at around 40 pounds per square inch pressure, at the
pipe.  During this process the softer parts of the pipe bowl disappear
revealing a wonderfully unique grain pattern.  The whole process is
undertaken by hand and it is the skill and judgement of the craftsman that
produces these pipes.  If the sandblasting on one particular spot of the
pipe is done for too long this will cause the bowl to become concave, which
natuarlly will mean it is rejected.)    

Expansion of the pipe making division meant another move, and in 1916
production shifted to 186 Campden Hill Road and in 1920 a pipe bowl-turning
unit was established at 20 Pancras Road near to Kings Cross.

The First World War struck everybody, but throughout the period Alfred
Dunhill's commercial acumen helped strengthen the company.  A most
innovative idea was to open up a mail order service to his officer customers
battling in the trenches in France.  To his most loyal customers he would
send a few extra pipes for them to sell to their colleagues and on their
return to England would reimburse Alfred Dunhill.  The Shell Briar became
one of the most popular pipes during this period of time.  This also exposed
the Alfred Dunhill brand to overseas nationalities as allies from places as
far afiled as Canada and France bought pipes from their English officer
friends.  Thus a worldwide reputation for excellence was growing quickly.

The 1920's and 30's saw a great deal of change for Alfred Dunhill Limited. 
In the early 20's the Parker Pipe Co Limited was formed by Alfred Dunhill. 
In 1936 Hardcastle Pipes Limited sold 49% of its equity to the company, and
at about the same time a new pipe factory was opened at Forest Road,
Walthamstow, E17.

The war years of 1939-45 were difficult for the company especially as briar
root for top class pipes was becoming increasingly difficult to obtain.  As
supplies dried up, reserves in the factory were seriously depleted, but with
the end of the war normality slowly resumed.

In 1946 the Dunhill pipe factory in Notting Hill was moved to Cumberland
Road, E13, and in the same year the entire ordinary share capital of
Hardcastle Pipes Limited was obtained.  It was not, however, until 1967 that
Parker Hardcastle Limited was formed, incorporating the Masta Patent Pipe
Company.

Further aquisitions were made in 1962 with the purchase of F Charatan &amp; Son
Limited, and Ben Wade (London &amp; Leeds) Limited in 1965.  It was in 1977 that
Dunhill Pipes Limited was formed, embracing the Plaistow factory in
Cumberland Road and that of Parker Hardcastle at Walthamstow.  In March 1982
Dunhill pipe manufacturing was transferred to 32 St Andrews Road,
Walthamstow, where it remains today.

Throughout all the changes during the twentieth century one thing has
remained constant: the superb quality of the handcrafted Alfred Dunhill
Pipe.

Production of the pipe continues today at Walthamstow where the highly
skilled and dedicated workforce produces beautifully crafted pipes for the
worldwide market.  The White Spot remians on the mouthpiece as a sign of
excellance.

( Of 1000 briars, only 20 become Alfred Dunhill Pipes, and of those 20,
fewer than 5% become the excellant "Root Pipe".)

"Give a mam a pipe he can smoke
 Give a man a book he can read
 And his home is bright with a calm delight
 Though the room be poor indeed."

                          Alfred Dunhill, 1924

<a name="33">Subject: PCCA Collector's Reserve Tobaccos</a>

While on that noble, endless quest for the perfect tobacco I happened 
upon a personal discovery that I thought I might share with the group.
   
I'm sure most readers are familiar with Bob Hamlin of PCCA and his
limited edition tobacco blends.  I had my first opportunity to sample 
one of these blends at the recent PCI show.  The fond memory of this 
experience caused me to call Bob last week and order a small supply.  
While I couldn't remember which blend I had sampled (like an idiot, I 
had neglected to read the label), Bob and I were able to sort it out 
via several e-mail messages and a couple of phone calls.  A few days 
later I had in my possession four tins of "Samovar," a self-described 
"rich, full Oriental Mixture, pleasantly fragrant with just enough 
rare Syrian Latakia to satisfy without overwhelming...Soothing as a 
cup of rich Russian tea."
   
Well, I don't know anything about Russian tea, but I do know that this
tobak is an Epicurean delight.  Upon receiving the package I
immediately smoked a bowl in a pre-Republic Peterson [your old pipe,
Rex, if you're reading this &lt;g&gt;] and was extremely pleased.  Later that
same evening I smoked another bowl; this time in the huge Taylor Made 
that I mentioned in the last Digest.  This second bowl proved to be the 
single most enjoyable smoking experience of my life--it lasted for 
nearly two hours, and I was profoundly disappointed when it finally 
came to an end.  This blend is delicious when smoked in a small pipe,
but a large, deep bowl allows the flavor to build to its fullest, 
and the final puff is the most savory of all.  I sincerely wish I 
had a Dunhill or Ashton "Magnum" to put this wonderful mixture in...I
don't suppose anyone would care to loan me one?  &lt;BG&gt;
      
Anyone who enjoys fine tobacco owes it to himself (or herself) to 
give Bob a call at (703) 878-7655 and order some of this rare stuff.
Just be sure and leave some for me &lt;G&gt;.

Thank you for your prompt response to my request.  I am a 36 year old female
- in a predominately man's world of pipe smoking.  I am beginning my 5th week
of employment at SPARTA INDUSTRIES, INC. in Sparta, North Carolina.  (I'm not
a pipe smoker - but a cigerette smoker) - and what a change that I can smoke
at my desk since starting work here!  I'm the MIS MGR here and this is a real
treat to see that there is so much interest in the industry.  We are a
division of UNITED STATES TOBACCO.  
We manufacture pipes - our brand names are DR. GRABOW and MASTERCRAFT.  We
also sell supplies and accessories.  Believe it or not, there are some great
"old timers" here at our plant that have been making pipes for a lot of years
and some of them have made it a "family affair".  Most of these guys have
been working here for a long, long time.  They take such pride in their work
- and most all of them collect and/or smoke pipes also.  We have some very
talented 
and creative individuals that hand carve the specialty pipes.
Of course you all probably know the Dr. Grabow name.  It's the "World's Only
Pre-Smoked" pipes. (when I got my first tour of the plant, they were pulling
my leg and telling me that we had a room full of 70 year-old ladies smoking
the pipes)  Actually, it's completely automated - but they truly are
Pre-Smoked!
I'll be keeping up with you all now that I'm a member, and of course I'll get
my co-workers on-line as soon as possible.  The president - Doug Allen is
very excited to get this going and so is our plant manager, Max Haynes.
 You'll probably hear from both of them real soon.  

Thanks for your delightful newsgroup!  Everyone keep on puffing!!!

<a name="35">Subject: Update from Colorado Springs</a>

In case this might confuse people coming into the middle of it, I'm a PD
reader who is on a cross-country job hunting trip, and I'm sending in
periodic updates to readers and soliciting advice on good stopping
points along the way:

06/08/95 11:57 am - I'm still in Denver.  It's pouring rain, which is
kind of a neat change, but I worry about the seal on the canopy.  I'm
heading out of town, but thought I'd stop by and try to talk to my
friend, Tim, where he works, before I head out of town.

3:00 pm - I just arrived at my friend, Clay's house, in Colorado Springs.
What a place! His house is huge.  As I came into Co. Springs, I arbitrarily
picked an exit and
stopped at McDonald's.  I had a hamburger, fries and drink.  I met a
lady and her daughter there and got all kinds of information about the
area's sights.  I called Clay, and a recording came on after 5 minutes
saying to put another quarter in, which I didn't have.  I tried to give
Clay the number of the pay phone, but it kept cutting in and
interrupting.  It finally cut us off and hung up!  I had to go back out
to the truck to get another quarter to call him back.  When I did, Clay
had me give him the number right away.  The next time it happened, he
called me right back and gave me excellent directions to his house.  I
called him when I got here and now am just hanging out until he get's
home.

06/10/95  7:41 pm - I'm sitting at the top of a hill in Palmer Park
(Palmer being the founder of Co. Springs), overlooking Colorado Springs.
Clay and I went to the mall yesterday and visited the Stag tobacco shop
at the Citadel mall.  I wasn't very impressed by the shopkeep.  He
didn't seem to care about helping unless you dragged him across the
counter.  I didn't see anything I could afford, but he did have quite a
few nice looking Meerschaums, in addition to lots of briars.  I was
happy that I didn't bust my bank there, though, when I found that the
mall had a Walgreen's in it.  More experienced pipe smokers may cringe,
but I remembered back to what Don Anderson told me, and I went in search
of Capt. Black in the white pouch.  I find that it doesn't really have a
name for the white pouch blend.  I also found that they had a number of
Dr. Grabow pipes, and I recalled what other PD readers had said, so I
got a freehand, and am enjoying it as I type!  I think that what I've
read about Dr. Grabow is true.  It isn't expensive ($19), but of the
three pipes I have, this is now my favorite.  I'd better get down.  It
only took about 10 minutes to climb this, but Clay said if I wasn't back
in an hour, he'd call for an ambulance.  In 15 minutes it will be an
hour!

06/11/95 12:36 pm - Clay and I just got done browsing the mall after
redeeming his winning lottery ticket.  He won $43, so we're here at
"Hooters" restraunt having lunch. This place is just FULL of pretty
waitresses with short, tight orange silk shorts and small T-Shirts or
tanks tops.  Wow...

 2:01 pm - Clay and I decided to go to Barnes and Noble bookstore, and
I'm waiting at the table for Clay to get a tall Mocha at the Starbucks
here inside the bookstore. I've seen a number of military types around
here.  Clay says that there is Norad (Cheyenne Mountain), Ft. Carson,
Peterson AFB, Falcon AFB and the Air Force Academy etc. in addition to
ones that Clay can't remember Accordingly, there are a lot of pawn
shops.

06/12/95  1:10 pm - My itinerary has changed a little.  I will be going
back to Denver tomorrow to spend some more time with Ben.  I don't know
how many days I'll be there, but after that I'll be on the road and
don't know for sure where I'll be.  That may even change, soon!  Right
now, I'm using Clay's computer to catch up on email.

I'll write again when I can.  Email has turned out to be more difficult that
I had hoped.  I'm thankful of the stops I can make where I have access to a
real computer, as I do here at Clay's.  Other times require that I use my
antique Compaq portable and AOL's DOS software, which is HORRIBLE.  More
later!

<a name="36">Subject: For Pipes Digest -- What Pipe Sweetner To Use?</a>

Does anyone have advice as to what pipe sweeteners a new pipe smoker might 
want to try?  I have been advised to try straight vodka, and scotch, among 
others.

Also, how should I care for the wood on a smooth oil-finished briar pipe?  
Should the briar be re-oiled, waxed, polished, or otherwise treated?

[ I've had good luck with Everclear grain alcohol, which is not a
sweetener, but is an excellent cleaner. -S. ]

Good Evening to All ...
        
        Spring is here and my garden is starting to come up. In my garden 
amongst the peas and carrots etc. is a section that I devevote to growing 
about 85 tobacco plants each year. 
        In other years, I've just grown them, dried the tobacco, and as I 
wanted it, I processed it in a blender, added some Scotch and enjoyed it.
        This year because of being enlightened by the DIGEST, I've decided 
to uh ... branch out so to speak. I'm looking for some new flavoring and 
curing methods. 
        I've searched all the old DIGESTS and gotten some good ideas but 
what I really want is a how - to bunch of information on properly curing raw 
tobacco and flavoring it.
        Because of my remote location (6 hr round trip to Halifax ) I am 
rather forced to use whatever is handy locally such as booze, liquorice, 
and/or flavoring. (i.e. vanilla)
        Would somone out there with experience in this, please help to 
further my education by dropping me a line? I'd really appreciate it.
        Thank you Steve for your work on the DIGEST. It's one of the 
highlights of my week.

Steve,

Giving in to the gentle prodding of my wife, I cut back on my cigar smoking 
and at her urging, went out and picked up a pipe as a substitute.  I've always 
enjoyed the look and smell of a pipe, but knew little to nothing about them. 
Since you are from the area (I work in Somerset, NJ) I'm sure you are familiar 
with the folks at John David, Ltd in Menlo Park Mall.  They were very 
attentive and helped me select a nice half-bent Briar (@ a 25% discount), and 
recommended a blend of vanilla and black cavendish they call Todevin - very 
tasty.

The back issues of Pipe Digest I came across on the net were a savior for this 
novice.  I've gotten through the first couple dozen, hence my expanded 
vocabulary.

I look forward to getting added to the newsletter and receiving future issues. 
Who knows, since we're both local, maybe we'll run into each other some time.

Hi Steve,

I want to thank you for your diligence and dedication to us in the Pipes
Digest world.  It is great to see that pipe smoking is still strong.  

In regards to MPluvers notes on the the estate pipe article in Pipe
Freindly.  I did get a copy of Pipe Friendly and enjoyed it very much.  I
read the article on estate pipes/collectible pipes with great interest.  I
think MPluvers was a little harsh in his words about the article.  I
understood the article as someone's opinion not as the only authority of
collectible pipes.  I think all Pipes Digest readers are intelligent enough
to make their own judgements on such articles.  

The whole concept of purchasing a pipe as an investment is rediculous to me.
Yes, I admit I would love to find a pipe at a flea market and have it turn
out to be worth $2000.00, but that is not what pipe collecting(collecting in
general) is all about.  You purchase a pipe, new or estate, because you like
it! The pipe fits you, it makes you happy, pipes and smoking them is to be
enjoyed and putting a dollar figure on such an enjoyable hobby is sure to
ruin the industry and our hobby.  I urge all pipe smokers to buy what you
like, what is in your price range, you won't be disappointed.

From: Christian Joergensen &lt;?????@?????.???.??.??&gt;
<a name="3">Subject: About me and the danish tradition of pipes.</a>

Hello Steve,

First I'd like to thank You for the newsletter, which I read with great 
pleasure. This beats the newsgroups by far, to see that everywhere 
else in the world there are pipe smokers who enjoy themselves with the 
tobacco as much as I do.

Then a Brief intro about myself: Age: 26, Field: french litt. and computer 
science, Not married but close, Pipe smoker since age of 16, Since a few 
years smoking cigars as well, but not at all an expert. 

I live in Copenhagen, Denmark, an old country with a strong tradition of 
using tobacco, ever since Columbus brought it to Europe, I mean, the 
vikings didn't have the tobacco, so they smoked all kinds of other stuff, 
and when not, they were eating strange mushrooms to get weird. 
I think they were pretty weird, and further south in Europe they must 
have felt the same about them, when getting invaded regularily ; I'm 
convinced that this is one of the main reasons (along with discovering 
America) for celebrating st. Christopher in the southern Europe. The 
vikings got the tobacco and stopped being vikings and weird (to some 
extent, anyway).

Does this mean that tobacco will stop you from beeing too weird ?? Well, 
honestly I don't know, but I sure hope so... I smoke quite a lot, as much 
as time lets me, and here are some of the most beautyfull things about pipe 
smoking: If I smoked a cigarette as often as I light a pipe, some people 
would surely turn away, with disgust painted in their faces, but when it 
comes to pipe smoking, this is somehow consideret as natural. Secondly, 
with this many cigarettes, surely my throat would be hurting, I would be 
caughing and so on. Non-smokers in general seem to like the smell of pipe 
tobacco (even burning), and I must admit that even to me, as a heavy 
smoker, a room filled with cigarette smoke can be very unpleasant, while 
with pipe smoke it is more like 'the more the better'. I think that the 
peace and calm attached to this sport can best be described with the words
of a danish artist and humorist, Storm Petersen, from the beginning of this 
century: 'You sit with a pipe, walk with a cigar and run with a cigarette.' 
He himself smoked a large kalabash pipe, that never left his mouth except 
when having a cigar instead.

How does someone begin to smoke pipe ?? From what I know, from my 
country, almost every pipe smoker does have a father or a grandfather 
who smokes or smoked pipes, while far from every pipe smoker's children 
smoke or intend to start smoking pipes. Pipe smoking becomes in this way 
a sort of tradition passed from generation to generation, unlike 
cigarette smoking, where this doesn't happen in the same degree. In the 
ealier days this was not a problem, smoking was a kind of a status symbol, if 
you could affort to smoke you would do so, but nowadays medical science 
and health care organisations work so powerfully against smoking that any 
normal parent (father) will have to strongly disadvice his children from 
smoking (that may be pipes or cigarettes). Maybe this will eventually 
exterminate the race of pipe smokers, just sorry for the best and most 
natural smoking pleasure.

This is a little bit of what I feel about my pipes, what I put in 
them their well being and their future.

Now just a little comment to the article in #192 about testing pipes in 
the pipe shop:
In the pipe shops in Copenhagen, the normal procedure in this case is to 
put a little plastic tube over the mouth piece and then let the customer 
try it as much as he likes. This is very friendly, of course, but in my 
experience, a pipe does never feel the same with this plastic tube as 
without it. I have in trying this been surprised more than once by the 
difference. Not nescesarily to the worse, it can also be: 'wow, it's even 
better than in the pipe store'. To beginners it is though a solution as 
it gives an idea about what the pipe is like (a little advice: take your 
time, let the pipe stay between the teeth for much more than just a few 
seconds, that improves this testing method a lot), but for the experienced 
pipe smoker i recommend messuring with excactitude the dimensions of the 
favourite pipe's mouth piece. Most important: 'How thick is it ?' and then:
'how wide is it ?'. Using this method I (at least) rarely (mouth piece 
is not all) go wrong when buying a new pipe.

Now I think that my 'talking time' must be over, if not long gone....

Yours at all times smoking and friendly

Vikings... I wonder if that's why they wore the helmets with the
horns? :-) -S. ]

An economical solution I once used was to put my cigars in a

kind (From a tape of Disney's Fantasia I think), so it had a very
good seal. 

If you wind up using something not originally intended for
tobacco I would recommend including a humidifier device of some
kind, to keep condensation from forming inside the case.

Steve and fellow digestions (perhaps a different designation is in 
order),

I am absolutely ecstatic about recent events in my pipe smoking 
career - all 2 weeks of it!

First off - I mentioned a shop called Andrea's in my last post, the 
address is 2401 60th st.  Kenosha, WI  53140. They do mail order and 
can be reached at 414/657-7732 or 800/831-1684. I can't really 
comment about quality or comparative prices even with a rich two-week 
history to compare to! Prices are around $2.50 for an ounce and a 
half, $20.95 for 16 oz.  How does that compare to the other shops out 
there? My first impression of quality has been good - and I've 
learned quite a bit about some blending process as they make their own 
blends on premisis. 

Secondly, I found a nice-looking pipe in an antique store for $5 - 
it's a Kaywoodie (?) and has a club emblem (like the playing card) on 
the stem. I cleaned it well - the previous owner had obviously not - 
and have enjoyed smoking it a couple of times. During the course of 
cleaning I (in a short bout of impatience) gouged the bit. Does 
anyone know about replacing these? It doesn't push in like my 
Savinelli, it's got a screw in type thing (technical term) like a 
pool cue.

All of which has led me to remember my Grandfather's smoking a pipe when I was 
young(er). On a long shot, I called my grandmother and was thrilled 
to find out that she still has his pipes and that I am "welcome to 
the smelly things!"  Allllriiight!

Sorry for length, adrenilin and nicotine will do that!

Good Lord Steve!  Thanks for issue 192,  but where did all these people come
from?
Do you remember when it was about 10 of us and most of the digest was Bill
Hacker going on about his world famous experiences and the role that his
trusty pipe always played?
Can't believe you got this many guys on the digest.  I got a couple of
comments that I would like to share.  First is that I saw someone looking
for how to fix loose stems and I did a write up on that two years ago or so.
Maybe you can find it and pass it along. Next I would like to suggest that
since you make a comment on almost every submission that comes into the
digest,  you might consider putting that at the top rather than at the end
of each submission.  I can get a lot from your friendly reply in terms of
deciding to wade through the news or not.

Hope all is well with you!

Norm

[ Everything's fine, Norm! And I'm surprised you haven't been getting
the Digest, since it's been going to your old address at Olivetti all
this time without bouncing.  I'll try to remember to look up the
loose-stem article; there have been a lot of them, and it might be
worthwhile to use the Web page's keyword search facility to hunt for
things like that. Also see the next article.

But I think I'll keep the commentary at the bottom, to avoid giving
readers a case of deja vu... :-) BTW, no one should feel neglected if
he or she doesn't get a comment, or just gets a short one; many
letters are self-explanatory enough that they can stand alone. Glad to

[ ??????????@???.???'s posting re melted stems ]

I'm not familiar with any other practices, but in my experience I've used a
heat gun and a pipe-cleaner.  I've had several pipes do that as well - so i
put the pipe cleaner inside the stem (leave plenty of slack to avoid
burning your hand) and put the stem over the heat gun until it becomes
pliable - then slowly bend it back using the pipe cleaner for leverage,
then run it under lukewarm water...

That should fix the problem - be very careful, though, to avoid melting
your stem, though - although I'm sure you'll be paying attention.  Also -
making sure the pipe-cleaner is wet while you are heating the stem should
insure that the inside of the stem stays open and doesn't heat up too much.
Get some more input from the pros, though...

***Steve*** - I'm aware that there are plenty of people out there who don't
agree with certain things I have to say regarding pipe-maintenance &amp; repair
- if you feel that this is a dangerous practice, and shouldn't be released
to the public, feel free to cut it out - I won't take any offense...

Pipes.  I want to respond to Deona T. who works at Mastercraft pipes in
Sparta, N.C.  While they make Dr. Grabow's and Master-
crafts, they (especially her boss Doug Allen) imports one of the best smoking
pipes I've ever had the pleasure to smoke in my rather extensive experience
 (which doesn't mean my taste is good...but humor me).  This exceptional pipe
that Mastercraft imports is called Ardor.  It's a little known Italian pipe,
and frankly, some of their styles and finishes are a little unusual and not
to everybody's liking.  Their stems (usually lucite) are also odd with an
exaggerated fish-tail stem.  In short, I've found them to be the kind of
appealingly ugly pipe that grows on one.  Their strength, though, is the all
important one...the way they smoke.  I hate to use such fru-fru terms, but
it's an almost nutty taste.  Anyhow, everybody I've introduced these pipes
to, and they include some very picky smokers, agrees with me about the
quality of their smoke.  If you come across one (and they're moderately
expensive, but not at all outrageous) and you like the way it looks, I'd
encourage you to get it.  Perhaps we can, with enough volume, encourage Doug
Allen and Ardor to send in some of their higher grades.  It must be said that
many of the European companies think we are tasteless, uncivilized brutes
here and reserve many of their finest pipes for EEC consumption.  I've seen
this time and again when I get some used pipes from one of my German
connections.  Perhaps more on this later.   

[ And perhaps Deona's going to get some extra orders for the Ardor
now! -S. ]

<a name="11">Subject: [PIPES]</a>

Hello, Steve,

Thanks for yet another fine Digest.  As always I look forward to receiving
them and am always disappointed when I'm done reading the latest.
Fortunately, I still have over 100 back issues to catch up on, so I'm never
alone :-).

I thought I'd report in on a couple of tips I read about here in the Digest
that I've tried and the results.

First of all, both here and in the Humidor FAQ it was reported that using
Oasis florist foam as a humidifying agent worked as well as a Credo
humidifier.  The Humidor FAQ even had a couple of ideas for easily making a
humidifier out of Oasis and either an aluminum cigar tube or a thoroughly
washed film canister.  I've tried both and am very pleased with the result.
I have a cigar tube one in my cigar humidor and film canister models in my
tobacco jars and they provide much more consistent humidification than the
late, unlamented wet sponges.  In PD #192 "Jack" asked about travel
humidors and IMHO using a tupperware-type container with an Oasis
humidifier is an inexpensive and effective solution.

A second tip I tried was soaking discolored pipestems in bleach to remove
the oxidation.  I have to admit I wasn't too impressed with the results of
my first experiment.  Some of the oxidation was indeed removed, but the
process left white patches on the stem which are as unsightly as the
oxidation was.  Of course, I tried it out on the stem of an old,
inexpensive pipe and it could be that the stem is of such poor quality that
nothing is going to work on it.

On another note, I must say I've been somewhat amused that my off-the-cuff
remarks to Charlie Jewell regarding tamping while driving have generated so
many responses over the past few issues.  Actually, I solved my problem
some time ago--I smoke a cigar while driving instead of a pipe (as you
suggested last issue following Bill Unger's horror story of the BMW driver
whose air bag drove his pipe into his eye--yeow!).  With a cigar, no
tamping is required and usually no re-lighting either.

Thanks again for all your hard work and providing us smokers with such a
friendly and enlightened forum.

pipe smoker, I primarily smoke pipes in the car, despite the risk of

<a name="13">Subject: Pipe Mailgroup</a>

Dear Steve;
     Thanks again for your wonderful work on the group. Somehow or
other I misplaced 178 and just now got it off of the website.
Didn't mean to be rude and ignore your question. The Kapp and
Peterson address is one of the retail shops in Dublin, or at least
was so 10 years ago. I don't believe that they do mail order, but
it is in a beautiful location, near the river, worth a visit if in
town.
     I think you or someone on the Smokers newsgroup asked a
question about tinning or storing tobacco. Some time ago there were
two infomercials about vacuum sealing machines which worked on jars
and plastic bags. One was an electric pump with a jar attachment. 
This one was in the $200 dollar range, and had a round vacuum seal
device which worked on Ball jars.  It also did waterproof bag
sealing.  It was promoted for hunters and boaters, and I recall
that they used the vacuum to crush a soda can in a plastic bag.
Using it on plastic bags without some kind of barrier would likely
clog the pump.  The other was a hand operated pump.  You punched a
hole in the metal top, and put some sort of plastic tape
check-valve over the hole. The hand pump evacuated the jar.  This
one cost about $30.  I expect that putting the tobacco in a plastic
baggie, not zipper seal, should prevent the pump from getting
clogged with the tobacco. I don't know if these will beat the mold
problem, or how long the tobacco would last under the "vacuum", but
the absence of air should help.  Maybe someone out there who has
one will try it on tobacco.
     I have to put my two cents in about "collector's pipes" and
the article in the pipe friendly mag. Anyone, other that the people
selling the pipes, who expects to make money on collecting pipes
should have their heads examined.  The market, no matter what
anybody says, is just too small.  If you want to smoke the pipes,
that is one thing. If they are antique hand carved meerschaums, the
market is greater than just the smoking population, but briar pipes
are not likely to have any real appreciation over time.
     You could talk to coin collectors or stamp collectors about
their respective markets.  Only the very rarest items appreciate
enough to keep pace with inflation.  And you will never get the
"collector's" price from any dealer. As the "market maker" (dealer)
is probably the only person who will buy in any volume, forget
about what is a hot collectible pipe. If it smokes well and has a
pleasing appearance, that is all you should be concerned about.  If
you want to invest call a stockbroker, or me, I have a very nice
bridge for sale.  Sorry for the sarcasm, and I don't intend to
deprive anyone of there livelihood, but when anyone tries to give
you an investment analysis of the used pipe market, I think it is
time to run the other way.

[ Thanks for the report on vacuum sealers! I wonder if I could make
a copy of the $200 version from Edmund Scientific parts... -S. ]

Steve,

after seeing a footnote in _The Annotated Sherlock Holmes_ concerning
the great detective's pipes, I tracked down of the references mentioned
therein (Baker Street Journal New Series, Volume V, No. 1, 1955).  This
is an interesting article that I think all readers of the Pipes Digest will
enjoy...
(note: I sent this before, but apparently it didn't make it to you)

                      NO FIRE WITHOUT SOME SMOKE

                           by John L. Hicks

      "Genius," says William James, Sherlock Holmes's great contemporary,
"in truth, means little more than the faculty of perceiving in an
unhabitual way."(1)  The Great Detective of course had that faculty in a
higher degree than any other man of his time.  Another philosopher,
Thomas Carlyle, who was also living during the period of Holmes's early
cases, speaks of genius as the "transcedent capacity for taking trouble
first of all,"(2) and Holmes again undoubtedly qualified.  In _A Study
in Scarlet_ he remarks, "To a great mind, nothing is little."

	But where and how, one may ask, did he acquire the "faculty" of
observation and the "capacity" for taking pains?  His musical talent,
his aptitude for scholarship, his scientific ability - these were
doubtless all inherited from ancestors that produced the French artist
Vernet and the American scholar and scientist Oliver Wendell Holmes. 
The Master himself says, in _The Adventure of the Empty House_: "I have
a theory that the individual represents in his development the whole
procession of his ancestors..."  He would not have evolved such a theory
if his own qualities had not offered evidence supporting it.  "To some
extent," also, as he declares in _The Greek Interpreter_, "systematic
training" increased his facility.  His power of observation and his
faculty of patiently attending to details, however, cannot be wholly
explained in this manner.  Moreover, his ability to use the data he
gathered by observing carefully and not neglecting details - his great
power of deduction - could not have been due entirely to heredity and
training.  It is true that in _The Greek Interpreter_ he attributes his
artistry in reasoning partly to artistic ancestors and offers as proof
the superior abilities of Mycroft, but this is only a partial
explanation.

	A close study of the Sacred Writings reveals that Sherlock
Holmes's powers as a logician were due largely to his pipe - and
primarily to his briar pipe.  Mycroft, of the keen mind and capacious
memory, was exceedingly lazy; indeed, he could be greatly moved only
when, as in _The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans_, the welfare
of his country was threatened.  He received inspiration from tobacco,
but the tobacco was in the form of snuff.  Sherlock was not only a
thinker but also a man of action, and he, significantly, smoked a pipe. 
The difference in the forms in which the two brothers used tobacco
explains their dissimilarity in temperament.

	No one can seriously question that the Master preferred a pipe to
cigars and cigarettes.  He smokes a pipe in thirty-five of the sixty
cases in the Canon, probably does in three others, and in still another
talks about his pipe without, as far as the reader knows, actually
lighting it.(3)  He smokes nothing but a pipe in twenty-nine or, if one
includes the doubtful instances, thirty-two.  He indulges in cigars
definitely in eight tales and probably in one other, and in cigarettes
definitely in nine and probably in one other.  In only ten cases does he
smoke cigars and/or cigarettes but not a pipe.  In eleven tales there is
no mention of smoking by Holmes, but there is no reason to believe that
the great man stopped the habit at any time, especially since these
cases are scattered throughout his career.  Holmes very likely smoked a
pipe during the adventures recorded in the eleven tales in which there
is no reference to smoking, as well as during those of the ten in which
Watson names only cigars and cigarettes.

	The great man's liking for a pipe began early in life and lasted
long; in fact, one cannot doubt that he still smokes one as he
contemplates the industrious bee.  The earliest mention of Holmes's
lighting a pipe is in _A Study in Scarlet_, which records an adventure
of 1882.(4)  The pipe that he enjoys in _The "Gloria Scott"_ is, of
course, on "one winter's night" when he tells Watson of his first case. 
The last reference to a pipe is in _The Adventure of the Creeping Man_,
whose date of occurrence is 1903, the year of his retirement.

	Most admirers of Sherlock Holmes have believed that his favorite
pipe was made of clay.  "Let us consider our data."  In six tales Watson
specifically mentions a clay pipe,(5) and since in three of these
accounts it is a "black clay pipe," perhaps the "old black pipe" of _The
Adventure of the Creeping Man_ is also clay.  Watson tells us in _A Case
of Identity_ that the "old and oily clay pipe" was to Holmes "as a
counsellor" and in _The Adventure of the Copper Beeches_ that a
cherry-wood pipe "was wont to replace his clay when he was in a
disputatious rather then a meditative mood."  The latter statement might
at first seem to indicate that the clay was the favorite among Holmes's
pipes, and it is undeniable that the Master was fond of his clay.  But
since _The Adventure of the Copper Beeches_ is concerned with a case of
the year 1890 and was published only two years later, the pronouncement
can apply only to the first fifteen years of Holmes's professional
career and may apply only to the time of the _Adventures_.

	Concerning the "old black pipe" of _The Adventure of the Creeping
Man_, Watson says, "As an institution I was like the violin, the shag
tobacco, the old black pipe, the index books, and others perhaps less
excusable."  This remark occurs in an adventure of 1903, and the pipe
referred to would seem to have been an "institution" during nearly all
of Holmes's professional career.  _The Adventure of the Creeping Man_,
however, was not published until 1923, and it is hardly necessary to add
that the doctor's memory was not always reliable, even for periods of
much less than twenty years.  As Mr. Anthony Boucher has pointed out,(6)
another "institution" in this list, the violin, was not, according to
available evidence, played by Holmes after 1891.  It may be that the
"old black pipe" is not a particular pipe, but all pipes that Holmes
smoked, confused and blended in the mind of the somewhat elderly Watson. 
Finally, the Master did not treat his clay pipe as a devoted pipe smoker
would treat a favorite: in _The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton_
he even "lit it at a lamp."

	Now let us consider the briar.  In only two of the adventures -
_The Sign of the Four_ and _The Man with the Twisted Lip_ - does Watson
say that Sherlock Holmes smoker a briar pipe.  In the former tale it is
an "old brier-root pipe" and in the latter an "old briar pipe."  The
adjective _old_ is significant.  When these two cases occurred, Holmes
was probably thirty-four and thirty-five years old.  Since a devotee of
pipes does not call a pipe old unless it has been in use for at least
nine or ten years, and since Watson as well as Holmes was a veteran pipe
smoker, the latter very likely had cherished this pipe from the time of
early manhood.  His clay pipe, it is true, is once called old; but for
Holmes, who was careless in his habits, a destructible clay pipe would
have been old if he had kept it six months.  In addition to the two
above-mentioned adventures there are others in which, although the word
_briar_ is not used, the pipe is almost certainly a briar.

	One can hardly doubt that when, in _The Adventure of Shoscombe Old
Place_, Holmes lit "the oldest and foulest of his pipes," he was
lighting the "old briar pipe" of _The Man with the Twisted Lip_ - a pipe
mellowed by eight more years of devoted attention.  In _The Adventure of
the Priory School_, the events which occurred twelve years after those
of _The Man with the Twisted Lip_, Watson speaks of the "reeking amber"
of Holmes's pipe.  A briar pipe might have an amber stem, but not a clay
pipe.  The old briar pipe of _The Man with the Twsited Lip_ Holmes
smoked at The Cedars, the home of Nelville St. Clair, and it was
presumably the same pipe that he smoked on the journey to The Cedars.  A
man who planned his course of action carefully as did Holmes would carry
a durable briar rather than a breakable clay when he went abroad.  For
that reason the pipe he smoked on the doorstep of Pondicherry Lodge, in
_The Sign of the Four_, was likely a briar, as was the pipe he had with
him at Poldhu Cottage, in _The Adventure of the Devil's Foot_.  In _The
Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton_, disguised as a "rakish young
workman," he did descend to the street with a clay pipe in his mouth,
but that pipe was part of his disguise.  In _The Yellow Face_, speaking
of the pipe that Mr. Grant Munro left behind in the sitting room at
221B, Holmes affectionately calls it a "nice old briar," and points out
that it has been given careless treatment, for it is charred down one
side as a result of being lighted at lamps and gas-jets.

	In twenty-two tales Holmes smokes a pipe of which the material is
neither identified nor implied.  Who can deny that in each instance the
pipe is every bit as likely to be a briar as it is to be a clay?  The
evidence supports the theory that Holmes liked a briar pipe better than
any other kind, and that he lit his "old briar pipe" oftener than he did
any other.

	One might infer from many of the tales that Holmes had only one
pipe at some periods; for example, in _The Adventure of the Illustrious
Client_ he says to Watson, "Put my pipe on the table."  If there are
several pipes from which to choose, how does Watson know which one to
put on the table?  Holmes had in mind, of course, his favorite - his
well-loved briar.  Briar, clay, and cherrywood pipes are, by the way,
the only ones mentioned in the Sacred Writings.  Neither Holmes nor
Watson ever mentions a curved stem; it is possible, however, that the
Master followed the fashion of his time and did have one or pipes with
curved stems.

	Watson divers times speaks of the help that Holmes received from
his pipe.  He calls it "the companion of his deepest meditation"(7) and
his "meditative pipe."(8)  When the Master attacked the mystery of the
death of Sir Charles Baskerville, he prepared to spend several hours of
"intense mental concentration" by asking Watson to leave and to have the
tobacconist send up a pound of the strongest shag.(9)  When he was
working on the problem of the disappearance of Neville St. Clair, he sat
up all night with a briar pipe and an ounce of shag - and of course he
solved the mystery.(10)  He smoked a pipe when a tackled the problem of
the abduction of the only son of the Duke of Holdernesse,(11) when he
pondered the mystery of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary
Sutherland,(12) and when he became "lost in the deepest thought"
concerning the problem brought to him by Lord Bellinger and the Right
Honourable Trelawney Hope.(13)  Frequently, when he had a particularly
difficult matter to consider, he smoked two or more pipefuls in
succession: for example, in _The Hound of the Baskervilles_ and _The Man
with the Twisted Lip_ (these incidents are referred to above); in _The
Red-Headed League_, which was a "three-pipe problem"; in _The Problem of
Thor Bridge_, in which he smoked two pipefuls in a row; in _The Crooked
Man_, in which, having gathered some facts, he "smoked several pipes
over them, trying to separate those which were crucial from others which
were merely incidental"; and in _Silver Blaze_, in which he devoted a
whole day to rambling "about the room with his chin upon his chest and
his brows knitted, charging and recharging his pipe with the strongest
black tobacco."  The evidence is so great that one might easily conclude
that Holmes did not solve a single difficult case without the help of
his pipe.  It is true that in "The Adventure of the Norwood Builder_ the
Master spent a sleepless night smoking innumerable cigarettes; but it is
also true that on the following morning he was nervous and pessimistic
about the prospects of his client.

	Colonel R. D. Sherbrook-Walker, in a recent article, states that
Holmes was not a discriminating user of tobacco, but was merely a slave
of habit.(14)  He cites the great man's choice of shag; his custom of
smoking a before breakfast pipe "composed of all the plugs and dottles
left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and
collected on the corner of the mantelpiece"(15); his puffing too rapidly
(he allotted fifty minutes to three pipefuls(16)); his practice of
keeping his tobacco in the toe of a Persian slipper, where it would dry
out and become covered with dust.  No real lover of pipes and good
tobacco can help deploring the lack of refinement of the Master's palate
(17) and the carelessness of his habits.  But it is unjust for one who
likes the more subtle and expensive blends of tobacco to assert that a
smoker who prefers a strong, coarse variety of the leaf does not enjoy
his pipe.  Sherlock Holmes was faithful to shag because he liked it. 
His uneducated palate and eccentric habits, moreover, did not detract
from the aid and sustenance he received from his pipe and his shag.

	It is reported that one occasion when William Makepeace Thackeray
visited his friend Alfred Tennyson, they smoked shag tobacco while
praising Miss Barrett's poetry.(18)  Great Victorians, both early and
late, had a preference for shag as an aid to ratiocination.

Dear Steve,

I've been lurking, off and on, for several weeks now and decided that it's
about time I introduced myself.  I'm a nuclear engineer living in Richland,
WA.  I was born and raised in Tucson, AZ.  I started smoking in college (U.
of AZ) with a Dunhill corona.  Appreciating the grace and style that goes
with pipe smoking (not to mention the cost-savings), I migrated to a Dr.
Grabow and on up the pipe-line through Savinelli and GBD.  My blends at that
time were Wilshire and Sherlock's Choice both from Tinderbox.

As luck would have it, one of my major professors was able to arrange a
summer job for me in Germany working for the DBE (they handle nuclear waste).
 I worked full time during the week (for very good money from a student's
POV) and spent the weekends on the trains exploring Europe.  I smoked mostly
Dunhill cigarettes because they were cheap, good and plentiful.  But I had a
mission: to find a meerschaum pipe that I could afford.  Success was waiting
in Vienna.

A little tobacco shop in the downtown market had a great variety of pipes,
among them several meerschaums for 6-8000S.  Ecstatic, I purchased a pressed
meerschaum full bent with a lucite bit (it looks like amber) for 6000S
(~$120).  I scurried off with my prize and spent the rest of my day in Vienna
getting to know my new friend.

Among the several adventures I had in Europe (such as losing my wallet in
France, not Italy, as I was warned), I had another smoking adventure in
Amsterdam.  I purchased a box of Romeo y Julieta tubos and had my first and,
so far, only taste of Cuba.  Ah! but what a taste it was!  It brought me back
to cigars.

Nowadays, I smoke Partagas Nos. 1 and 10 with an occasional Upmann Churchill.
 For the pipe, I've migrated through Shag and Bob's Best (Mission Pipe Shop,
San Jose) to the English blends.  I've not decided yet which I prefer but
I've tried Dunhill Early Morning Pipe and Blend No. 965, Bengal Slices, and
MacBaren Latakia and Burley.  I look forward to discovering more blends,
thanks to the info posted hereabouts.

That's probably more of my bio than most care to know, so I'll ask a question
and be gone.   I recently acquired a Churchwarden pipe from the Briar Shop,
Kennewick, WA, and wonder about the history of that name.  My interest is
partly personal since I became Junior Warden of St. Paul's Episcopal Church,
Kennewick, in Jan. of this year.  
Many thanks for an enjoyable digest.

Just a note to say our numbers have increased by one.  Here at work,
three of us in the department are pipe smokers.  Since we are not allowed
to smoke in the building, we stroll outside on our breaks (pipe smokers
do not dash) and enjoy a small bowl.  One of our new employees began
accompanying us to join the conversation.  After a couple of weeks, he and
one of the other guys went to the pipe shop during lunch and darned if
he didn't come back with a pipe.  Naturally the rest of us are providing
all the help and encouragement we can.  They brought word that the pipe
shop was having a sale, so I went down there the next day.  I was a bad boy.
I'm not supposed to buy any more pipes, but I couldn't resist a Sasieni
quarter-bent for $25 US and an African block Meerschaum (I know, but that's
what I was told it was) for $20.  One of the other guys showed up while I
was there and talked himself into a very nice straight grain Luciano (not
a single pit or fill) for $85.  That's it from Atlanta.  Enjoy.

Dear Steve,

thanks for putting me on the Pipe Digest mailing list.  I very much
enjoyed reading the issue.  I have an addition for the list of tobacco
shops: Kaernbachs Pfeifen, the only good pipe shop in Berlin, but it
is very good.  They have pipes from Joe Coker (ech!) up to some
beautiful Dunhills, and everything in between.  They also have an
occasional demonstration put on by various pipe makers.  They do minor
repair work.  And they have a small supply of cigars - unfortunatly,
very expensive.  The Address is:
				Kaernbachs Pfeiefen
				Muthesiusstrasse 9
				12207 Berlin-Steglitz
BTW, my wife, who is at a conference in Luebeck right now, just called and told
me that, directly across the street from her hotel, is a Savinelli shop.  She
knew she had heard of Savinelli somewhere, so she looked in the window.
Thousands of pipe!!!!  Savinelli pipes!!!  Oh joy of joys.   Guess I know where
I'm off to next weekend!!!
Smoke in peace,

Dear pipe friends:

I just returned from a business trip to Zurich/Switzerland; if anyone
should happen to be there in the near future: As soon as you arrive,
check out "Zigarren Duerr" in the Bahnhofstrasse (directly at the main
station).  I was there last Wednesday and they just started to sell
out all their Ashton pipes at SFR 75.00 (ie: roughly 60 US$) per
piece! They had about 40 pieces, mostly Ashton Sovereigns of size
XX. These are usually sold for around 250-300 US$ per piece in Europe,
so SFR 75.00 is close to giving them away for free.

Some of them belonged to the most beautiful Ashtons I have ever seen,
so I thought a while about taking them all. However, since that would
have been very unfair against the other pipe smokers in Zurich, I
decided just to pick the three nicest pieces. It was certainly the
best deal in my pipe smoking life so far...

	Joachim.

[ I'm sure all Zurich applauds your fairness, Joachim!  Or at least 37
pipe smokers will... -S. ]

Hello Steve and all the readers of this list!

At first I must say to you, Steve, that I am wondering how you can have the 
stamina to go on month after month with the list. I hope that you'll swing 
it for years, but I wonder how long you will last.

I joined in the list in summer 1994 and have been reading and every now and 
then writing with pleasure  for this group.

I've been smoking pipe for about 25 years now (I'm 54). I'm not a collector, 
but my experience has proved me that one must have at least 10 pipes to be 
happy with smoking. Of course the number of pipes depends of the quality of 
the pipes you have. I live in a small town (45.000 inhabitants) in Finland 
and the assortment of pipes is quite moderate. So I must be patient when 
buing a new one. I prefer Savinellis and Royal Danish (former Stanwell) 
pipes. I have to pay about 75 - 125 US$:s to get a fair pipe here in Finland 
(Europe).

I think that you cannot overestimate the importance of proper cleaning. 
After every bowl you must use at least two cleaners. An economical pipe 
smoker twistes the cleaner  so that he (or she) has at least "four in one". 
I am convinced that it is best to clean the pipe straight away after 
smoking. Don't leave the juices in! To the contrary of opinions in the list, 
I never clean the pipe without first loosing the stem from the shank. I 
always use the cleaner from the mouth-direction, never to mouth-direction.

I have been wondering the opinions of people in this list, who are worried 
about the extra surplus on top of their pipes and how to get rid of it. I 
think that it'll do no harm to you or your pipe. A pipe is meant to be used. 
It is a piece of craftmanship that you like. But it isa pal, too. When you 
get aged, the pipe gets older, also. I love the extra surplus on top of the 
bowl. It reminds me the happy hours I have spent with my pal. Of course you 
must bore (I'm not sure about the proper verb) the bowl when it becomes too 
narrrow. I think that one of the most important things in pipe smoking is 
the fact that you must get the bowl narrowing to the bottom. If the pipe you 
have bought is such that this is impossible, forget it! If it is so that the 
cross-section of the bowl is like an hourglass, you must cone it (narrowing 
to the bottom). There are a plenty of pipes that cannot be smoked properly 
(conical). The briar these days is mainly (if you are lucky) of a fair 
quality. Year after year it has become more difficult to get a decent pipe 
without ruining your budget. So, don't wonder, newbies,  if it is not always 
so happy with the pipe as you have been reading about.

At last I'll mention something about tobacco. The less it is spiced the 
better it is (other things being equal).

<a name="23">Subject: Cigar Experience</a>

I have an interesting experience to relate that serves to confirm my 
belief that pipe and cigar smokers are among the most civilized in the world:

Last year, I wrote a letter to Cigar Aficionado magazine on women and 
cigar smoking, which they published in their Spring 1995 issue. 
In my letter, I quoted another letter CA had published from a gentleman 
who had some very positive things to say about women smoking cigars. A 
few weeks ago, this gentleman called me out of the blue, told me he was 
in the area (he's from Houston, I live in Southern California), and he 
wanted to take me out for a drink and a cigar to thank me for quoting him 
in my letter.

Since So. Calif. is so hostile to tobacco, I had to do some checking to 
find a nice restaurant/bar in North Orange County that allowed cigar 
smoking. The good folks at Maxwell's tobacco shop recommended La Vie En 
Rose, a French restaurant near the Brea Mall. I had eaten there for lunch 
and had no idea they allowed cigar smoking in their bar. Not only that, 
they have a room off the bar that allows cigar smoking WHILE DINING. This 
is not a private club or just for cigar dinners.

So, Joe and I went to La Vie En Rose, had a couple of glasses of a 
Graham's 20-year-old tawny port, and shared Primo del Rey Baron cigars. 
It was one of the most pleasant evenings I have ever spent. Not only did 
no one bother us, but a gentleman who works at the restaurant came up to 
Joe and asked if he could buy a Primo del Rey from him! Joe provided the 
cigar to the man free of charge.

Joe and I marveled at how letters in a magazine could help introduce 
fellow cigar lovers. He helped found a couple of cigar groups in the 
Houston area, and he said about 30 women are members. For those women 
reading the Digest, there is an appreciative group of men out there!

When Joe and I parted company, he gave me a Cuban and another Primo del 
Rey. He hopes to come out to L.A. for the Pipe and Cigar Expo sponsored 
by the Southwest Pipe and Cigar League, and he wants to escort me to it. 
My husband would never go to an event like that, and neither would Joe's 
wife, so I now have a sometime companion for one of my favorite pastimes.

Joe was a gentleman and a true man of the (cigar) world. And, from the 
postings in this Digest, it would appear that many of you are the same. 
&gt;From myself and all women who smoke cigars as I do -- thank you!

<a name="24">Subject: Hi Steve and the group</a>

Hello to all the Cigar Enthusiasts out there in cyberspace.

I just recently saw your homepage and decided to suscribe.  I would 
like to take this opportunity to introduce myself.  My name is Fred 
Pearlman, and I have been a cigar smoker for about 30 years (age 50). I 
also smoked a pipe off and on for a number of years but enjoy a cigar a 
bit more.  I live in Union City, Ca., which is about 35 miles from 
downtown San Francisco.  I have been in the bay area for about 17 years 
and work as a project manager in the medical diagnostics/biotechnology 
business. Besides being a cigar enthusiast, I am also a ham radio 
operator and computer enthusiast. I mostly smoke Arturo Fuente Cuban 
Coronas, Corona Imperials and just about any A. Fuente cigars I can get 
my hands on (usually 1-3/day).  Seems like almost everybody is 
backordered on A. Fuentes, whenever I want to place an order.  Also I 
really enjoy the El Credito Wavell's and Soberano's.  However, the 
several month wait for delivery can be rather tiresome.  I am expecting 
2 boxes of Wavell's to arrive this week after a 3 month wait. I guess 
now that cigar smoking has gotten so popular, everybody is backordered 
on everything (at least everything good!!). My primary goal in life is 
to get my hands on a "gen-u-wine" cuban COHIBA. Maybe next time I am 
out of the country on business I can find one. A couple of years ago 
when in Paris, I looked for a Cohiba but did not have enough time from 
my business meeting to do a proper search.  So left empty handed. Hope 
to do better next time.  

I have a question for the group. Does anyone know of a cigar club in 
the San Francisco bay area. If so please drop me an e-mail, as I would 
like to look into joining mostly because I would like to attend the BIG 
Smoke in San Francisco on Oct 15, 1995 at the Hyatt Regency, but would 
like to go with one or more other cigar enthusiasts.

[ If you find one, please let us know too! CA is supposed to be
accumulating a list of cigar clubs; I should send in the Digest
too. -S. ]

[PIPE]
Hello Steve,

I finished a long day of relaxation, smoking and shopping (a great Saturday)
with a look through PD 192.  I have had a hectic week and just now got to it.
I came up with three remarks for the digest readers.  (oh - this is about 80 
lines without all of the header garbage so feel free to edit if need be)

1.  In response to a comment by ????????@???.????.??? about the WHO's
"no-smoking day", our faithful moderator wrote:

&gt;In any case, I'd
&gt;like to know when the WHO is going to stage this, so we can organize
&gt;our own World Smoke-In for Freedom, or Know Tobacco Day.  Better names
&gt;welcome... -S. ]

Personally, I'd like to see a "Joy of Smoking Day", preferrably on a
weekend, where every smoker takes pride in striking a match for public
freedoms.  We can fill every neighborhood park with an hour or two
(say noon-2pm) of quiet smoking and being seen.

2.  As the battle for smoker's privileges rages on, internal dissent rises, as 
????????@???.??? writes:

&gt;In the No-Smoking section war I consider myself a conscientious objector. I
&gt;don't mind not being able to smoke in my favorite restaurants. I usually
&gt;prefer to spread out on the grass in the park with a nice Churchill or sit at
&gt;home with a good book. I do, however, despise cigarette smokers who think
&gt;their cig doesn't stink. I recently went into a bar and was met by bluish
&gt;smoke to my knees, but when I lit up--on the veranda no less--I earned sharp
&gt;glares and a "P. U." from a group of chain-smoking menthol-mouths at a
&gt;nearby, upwind table. I just smiled and enjoyed my Arturo Fuente. 

Now, I am considerate of people when I smoke indoors (on those rare occasions)
but if I am standing on a city street, waiting for a bus, with my pipe lit, I
do not take kindly to someone telling me, "Would you put that [beep]ing stinky 
thing out?!"  (btw, my response was to step to the other side of this person
so that I was downwind and then say no).  This person did ignore the cigs all 
around him.  Also, I was down in Florida (instead of home in Pittsburgh) last
weekend (6/9-12).  I went to my favorite pool hall, and read the rules which
said "no pipe or cigar smoking"  I suddenly decided to be selectively blind.
I lit my pipe and  quietly smoked and shot pool with my brother, waiting for
someone to ask me to extinguish my pipe.  After about an hour, I was done, and
as we left the waitress told me that the smoke was the best-smelling thing she
had had in her eight-hour shift.  (every table had a smoker at it that night)
Some people may disagree with my tactic, however I am always willing to let my 
pipe go out if someone objects.

3.  And now, on tobaccos, a question.  Ed Berggren writes:

&gt;Three or four weeks back I bought a tin of Escudo tobacco primarily because
&gt;I've read so many good things about it here in the Digest.  This was my
&gt;first experience with tobacco that came in slices instead of ready rubbed
&gt;and initially I had trouble rubbing it out consistently--one time it would
&gt;smoke well, the next time I could hardly keep it lit.  So I finally took a
&gt;kitchen knife to it, chopping it up to an even consistency.  Since then
&gt;things have gone much more smoothly.  I must say I do like it--it's quite
&gt;unlike anything else I've ever smoked.  However, I'm not yet sure that I
&gt;like it $8.30 per 50 grams worth.  I'm about half-way through the tin, so
&gt;I'll reserve final judgement until the last bowl.

I have just purchased several tins of non-rubbed tobaccos, and was wondering 
about the way people smoked them.  I bought a tin of Escudo, a tin of 
MacBaren's Dark Twist, and two tins of Mac Baren's Latakia blend (one of which 
was immediately dated and cellared :)  I smoked my first bowl of the Latakia 
blend today, and I simple ripped up a few disks (4 or 5 I think) and packed my
bowl normally.  This was one of my smaller pipes, and I was wondering if I was 
overloading it.  Any suggestions?  The pipe smoked wonderfully; tasty and dry 
all the way down - however, I had left a large piece of a disk solidly on the 
bottom, and that piece didn't burn completely.  However, a dottle-free smoke
was had, and greatly enjoyed.

Thanks for keeping all of this going, Steve, and enjoy!

Steve,
         Bill Unger was kind enough to send  me a copy of your response to
Jack Ehrmantrout's article in Pipes Digest.  I had read the article several
weeks ago and my reaction was the same as yours, but perhaps a little
spicier.  I know Larry Roush, his pipes, and his devotion to quality work.  I
also know he learned at the elbow of Mike Butera, which would tend to make
JE's article a put-down of Mike.  I also liked what you said about a pipe
merchant giving investment advice vs smoking advice.  Helluva note!!!  Among
the Dunhills, Charatans, Castellos, etc., that I own are several (7) Peterson
XL90 1/2 bent's.  I'm smoking one now.  This is a large pipe with ample bowl
and drilled so a pipe cleaner reaches the bowl.  I just love the damn things.
 Wonder what Ehrmantraut would think of that?  More than a collector, I'm a
pipe smoker of some 33 years and I think JE's gone bloody well around the
bend with his own self perceived importance.
       It was an excellent letter.  You "done good" Steve.  Please add me to

Greetings Steve,

well, I have now read all of the PDs from 130 to 171 - could you
please send me the older copies from 1 to 129???  That would be much
appreciated!

As an American who moved to Germany two years ago, I was also
distressed to learn that 90% of the pipes here are filter pipes.  I
tried it a couple of times, and have found that the tobacco loses a
lot of flavor.  After almost deciding only to buy pipes from other
countries, I found out about adapters.  Most good pipe shops will
provide them free with a new pipe (Dan Pipe was mentioned in one of
the PDs, and they will send any pipe with an adaptper).  An adapter is
simply a round piece of plastic with a hole in the middle - put it
where the filter goes, and you're all set.  Hopes this helps those
people living in Germany who don't like filters.  Peace, Dave

relevant it would be to a fellow-smoker in the Shetland Islands but I 
am interested in seeing what's going on over there!  I've recently 
returned to the pipe after an absence of 12 years during which time 
I've settled here in Shetland with only one "tobacconist" shop hardly 
worthy of the name.  I could well be interested in mail-order from 
the US, although I'm not sure how HM Customs and Excise deal with the 
tax on pipeweed.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Brian

<a name="30">Subject: Advice on my Peterson</a>

Hi Steve
First a long promised personal introduction.  I'm a 21 year-old pipe smoker 
from Dublin,  Ireland who started smoking a pipe a little over 18 months ago.

At the moment I'm having a slight dilemma about my Peterson pipe which I 
suspect many other novice or relative novice pipe smokers have also had.  I 
find that the Peterson bit - where the smoke is channelled through a small 
hole on the upper side of the bit - causes the pipe to smoke extremely hot. 
This is a shame since I particularly like the pipe and under no circumstances
would like to stop smoking it.  Does anyone have any advice as to what I 
should do.  I've only ever seen Peterson's with this kind of bit.

Finally I would be delighted to hear from any other pipe smokers in the 18-25
age group just to make a few contacts.  I don't mind where you're from but if
anyone in the Alsace region of eastern France or in the adjoining regions of
Germany and Switzerland is reading,  I would be delighted to hear from you.  I
intend to start work there in the autumn and would be delighted to hear from 
some younger pipe smokers in that part of the world.  But anyone's welcome.

Best wishes,
Barry Hennessy.

(PS excuse all the delighted's above.  My server has horrendous editing powers
and there's nothing I can do about them now!! BH)

[ Probably the heat has more to do with the tobacco or your rhythm
than the smoke hole, Barry! Try smoking slower.  And I hope some of
our younger mbrs. will drop you a line. -S. ]

What really motivated me to write you was your mention of cigar clubs
sending you assortment of cigars.  That sounds interesting.  Could you
let me know who to contact and what's involved.

++++++++++++++
International Cigar Club
1701 East Empire Street
Suite 250
Bloomington, IL 61704-9916
1-800-729-9717

I just called them up and an automated system took the information.  By 
referring a new member, ICC agrees to send my next shipment free of 
charge.  If you will mention it when you call, I'd be happy to share this 
benefit by reimbursing you for half the charges.  Just reply with your 
postal address, and I'd be happy to send you a check.  In PD #189 I made 
a similar offer.

The long and short of the story is that the club sends you from 4 to 6 
cigars with a common thread.  June's cigars had a ring gauge of 50.  
[Well, one was a 49, but what's a sixty-fourth of an inch among friends?] 
 The month before the cigars all came from the same distributor, 
including an excellent sample that was so new that the band hadn't been 
approved before we received them.  The month before was double coronas.  
You get the idea.  There is no wrapper preference no size choice; just 
five cigars.  This tube arrives the first week of the month, and you pay 
the invoice.  Mine runs $11.50 or so, but I'm close to Bloomington, IL.  
There's a box of wooden matches and a cheap cigar cutter about every 
other month.  I've given two cutters away to novice cigar who just loved 
them.  If you have any questions, or want to send your postal address, 
let me know.

Hi Steve and all!

Thanks for the great job.
Here are the best places to find cigars in PARIS and GENEVA.

1) Paris.

    La Casa del Habano
    169, boulevard Saint-Germain
    75007 Paris
    tel (1) 45 49 24 30
In this very well decorated place, in a great atmosphere you will only find
Cubans. They are kept in the best conditions: good moisture &amp;
temperature allows you to enjoy them immediately with the greatest
pleasure.
Downstairs is a nice bar (ahh... a young rhum with a good cigar is such
a delight...) and a restaurant.

    La boutique 22
    22, avenue Victor Hugo
    75116 Paris
    tel (1) 45 01 81 41
This shop used to be only devoted to Davidoff. But Mr. Matthieu nows
sells all kind of cigars, also kept in the very best conditions.

These two shops above offer you the best conservation in Paris.
If you also need advise, go to:
    La Tabatiere Odeon
    128, boulevard Saint-Germain
    75006 Paris
    tel (1) 46 34 21 89
The conservation conditions are not as good, but the advise are very
fine, and the owner is a very nice man.

2) Geneva.

In Geneva, I can only advise you one adress, but it is UNDOUBTFULLY
THE BEST IN THE WORLD  (no kitting and exagerating at all).

    Gerard Pere et Fils
    Hotel Noga Hilton
    19, Quai du Mont Blanc
    1201 Geneve
    tel   4122 / 732 65 11
    fax 4122 / 738 64 73

Mr. Gerard is the only retailer in the world to be authorized to have the
logo of the CUBATACO in his display. He of course only sells Cubans. He
will give you the very best grestest top awesome advise. He has his
cigars maturing in his own cellar of course, and will only accept to sell
you a cigar if he thinks it is at its top (he once sold me a box he had kept
maturing for 7 years!). He sometimes has great cigars the cubans make
especially for him, without. He will take time to listen to you, your tastes
and your mood, will let you test cigars with a glass of good Cognac or
Rhum. And he will let you make discoveries, and share his new
pleasures. Connoisseurs all agree that Gerard, describing himself as a
"craftsman" has taken the place of regretted Zino Davidoff in the heart of
cigar lovers. His motto could be absolute quality with no compromise.

                                                       Henri
                                                       ????????@??????.???.??

P.S. 1      This, of course is no commercial stuff, I only want to let you    
share my enthousiasm.

P.S. 2       From France, the anti-smoking frenzy you're experiencing
looks completely unbelievable. Kafka is not dead, and where is the           
country of liberty? All I can tell you is VIVE LA RESISTANCE !

[ Thanks for the addresses, Henri! They are now in the Guide. -S. ]

Steve;

Hello,my name is Michael Stanley. I would be very interested in 
your mailgroup.I seem to be terribly busy in the Summer but
I will try and contribute as time permits. I've been a pipe smoker
for about eight years. I am still at because I found Rick hacker's
Ultimate Pipe Book(secrets of sucsesful pipe smoking). It got me
through that nasty tongue bite. I owe all my "good" pipes to the 
late Barry Levin. His mail order estate pipes are sorley missed by 
me. I even had a couple of nice conversations on the phone with 
him. I just don't get mailings from his wife or Nikos,wish I did, I am 
a real fan of there tobaccos. I lean towards dark virginias and the 
orientals when objectors are'nt around.
I heard about your group in the A&amp;M Gazette. I look forward to every
new issue. Thanks in advance for including me.
           Michael Stanley

<a name="34">Subject: Passin' through Kansas</a>

06/14/95 11:02 am - I didn't sleep real sound, but as it
got later I started to sleep better.  Ben's girls went to the grocery store
and I'm going to go handle my email and then better go find an unemployment
office to put in a claim!

06/14/95 1:43 pm - Just got done doing a "courtesy claim"
at the unemployment office.  On my way to get lost
finding the place, I came across a Tobacco Leaf store at
Alameda Village, 7111 W. Alameda, Lakewood, Colorado,
80226.  800-523-6746, 303-274-6746 (I thought I should
start putting that kind of info for the resource guide). 
They have a nice little weiner dog that was real
friendly, waddling around the store.  Great dog!  The
ladies there are pretty friendly and helpful.  Sherry
(sp?) taught me something I didn't know:  One indicator
of a good briar is the weight, relative to the thickness
of the bowl.  If it's thick, but still light, it's more
likely to smoke cooler.

06/14/95 9:48 pm - I just got off the phone with my Aunt Jennie. 
We talked about me coming into town there on Friday night
and staying the weekend.  She works during the week.  I'm
going to try to meet with "DL" Lively, a PD reader, in
Salina, KS.  I hope that he can meet during the week.  He
said that he was unemployed, too, but it sounded like the
weekend was when he wanted to meet.  That may not be
possible for me.  Gotta go, gotta finish this trip!

06/15/95  7:28 pm - Today Mandy, Bekki and I drove down
to a shopping area past Belleview and I got triptiks and
maps and stuff from AAA.  They do a good job there, but I
don't think they use any kind of computer at all to do
the routing.  That surprises me.  I think they should
license Automap from Microsoft, or make some kind of deal
to use it.  AAA and Microsoft could both benefit from it. 
We ate at McDonalds and then I stopped at KMart and
exchanged my bad compass for a better model (hopefully).

06/16/95 - Stopped in Salina today and met with my first
PD subscriber on the trip, "DL" Lively.  When I first
pulled into town, I sort misrouted myself and ended up on
the opposite end of town from where I wanted to be.  It
turned out well, though.  I stopped in at the Payne Oil
Company office and the gals there let me use the phone to
call DL.  He came right over to where I was and then lead
me to "Bogey's", a local hamburger/soda fountain that is
a minor shrine to the actor.  The place is old and small but it's a great
hamburger stand with real good food, including something
on the order of 130 different milkshake flavors!  It was
real fun spending the time with DL.  I wish I could have
stayed longer than the 2 hours we had.  I left and got on
the road to Emporia where my Aunt lives.  I pulled in
there at about 9:30 and am relaxing here now until either
Tuesday or Wednesday morning when I'll head out again for
the open road.  Until then, I'm enjoying some of the
things I'm not used to, like quiet neighborhoods,
fireflys and the older architecture of the homes in the
area.  It will be interesting to see how the rest of the
trip goes until I reach Washington D.C. (where I will
meet my brother and sister).  From here on out, I've have
only my pickup for housing until I reach Virginia, where
I'll meet a gracious country doctor (a PD subscriber) who has offered to let
me stay the night. Then it will be on up to D.C. to meet my brother and
sister for (hopefully) July 4th.

6/21/95 - Today may be my last chance to write to the PD for a while.  I
don't know if/when I'll have access to a phone jack and power for the PC to
upload.  As it is, it turns out the Emporia is not a major town, so there
isn't a local node here.  I'm not even sure exactly how I'll upload this.  I
may end up making a long distance call to get this uploaded.  In any case,
I'm looking forward to hearing from members of the PD mailing list, but
if/when you write, keep it short, for two reasons: 1) I'd hate for you to
invest too much writing, and have me not be able to read/respond until I get
to Washington D.C. and 2) it helps keep my download hassles to a minimum when
I get a chance to hookup and download my email.  I'll be in touch, though!
---

Oh, and one last thing.  I'd like to publically express my thanks to DL
Lively for inviting me to visit with him in Salina, Kansas.  It was
definitely a friendly port in foreign territory, and I sincerely wish that I
it would have been possible to plan some extra time.  If/when you go through
Kansas, get in touch with DL and see if you might be able to arrange a
meeting with him.  He's a very interesting person, well read (much moreso
than I) with lots of fun little stories of life in Albania, among other
subjects.

Gotta go!

<a name="35">Subject: pipes - 2</a>

Hello,
	I've recently decided to let go of some pipes which have been
in my collection for a little over 10 yrs., now. There is nothing
wrong with the pipes, I have taken excellent care of them, they are
just pipes that, for one reason or another, I do not smoke very often
so I've decided to let them out to someone who will get more
satisfaction from them. They are all of Excellent quality, and have
had only high grade tobacco burned in them. I have a fairly large
collection and, over the years, have settled on my "favorites". Though
I love these pipes no less, I've noticed that they get little use, and
have decided to see if there's any interest among my fellow smokers
for any of these.

I've had photos of the pipes digitized, and am posting them in .gif
format in alt.smokers.pipes. I hope the quality is sufficient. This
will be my first experience with this technology. Here's a breakdown
of the .gifs:

castello.gif: two Sea Rock Briars, and a Natural Vergin(how it's
spelled on the pipe!)  The "stack", at the bottom of the .gif is a #74
F The "pot", in the center, is a KK32, and is very "cool" with the
yellow lucite bit The Vergin, at top is KK14, and sort of unique
insofar as the shank to bowl proportion is uncommon.  When you can
findCastellos, they run about $250 for Sea Rocks.  I'd like $85 for
each.

sasdun.gif: an OLD Sasieni 4 dot "poker", and a Dunhill Shell the
Sasieni is a "real" 4dot Rough Root, I'd like $75 the Dunhill is a
filter pipe ! I didn't know they made a filter pipe! It smokes
excellently! Dunhill markets it with meerschaum cannister type filters
but it fits(and I prefer) Savenelli balsa filters also. I'd like $125
for this pipe.

stokebey.gif: This Peter Stokebey half bend is briar poetry! F grade,
this is a definitive flame grain, with bottom bowl birdseye. These
Stokebeys have been unavailable for some time now.  This one cost
$350, 12 yrs. ago. I'd like $125.

wilmer.gif: This one is stamped Wilmer Straight Grain on one side, and
Made in England 1810 on the other........you tell me.........have it
for $50.

brwkshp.gif: This unusual pipe is one of the Briar Workshop pipes. The
Workshop, in Stowe VT. was producing pipes in the late 70's, and they
are all fine pieces.  I've often referred to this shape as a
"Scandanavian Bulldog" just for fun. It's a great pipe....cost me
around $200 in '80. I'll take $60 for it.

	These are, I believe, very fair prices. I may be open offers,
particularly if somenone would like several, or all of the pipes. In
any event, I will pay the shipping charges upon reciept of your money
order, or cashier's check.

Any feedback would be welcome at ?????@????????.???

						Happy Smoking.....

<a name="37">Subject: Escudo match from C&amp;D Tobacco</a>

Steve:  I've noticed a lot of questions and comments on a.s.p about Escudo
over the last few months.  Thought this might be of some interest to PD
readers.  As usual, I have no connection with C&amp;D except as a customer.

Craig Tarler of C&amp;D Tobacco has achieved his Escudo match and it is right on
the money.  I ordered some last week and have been doing a comparison the last
few days.  I used matching Peterson pipes with freshly reamed cakes to test
the blend; one filled with Escudo, one with Craig's blend.  For me, the flavor
is the same.   The only difference is that Craig's stuff is smoother from the
start.  As much as I enjoy Escudo, I have always found that the first minute
or two of puffing is rather harsh.  After that it smooths out (or my tongue
gets numb).  Craig's blend (#967) avoids that harshness.  It has the same
rich, mouth-filling taste as the original.  And considering the cost of Escudo
($8.30 for 1 and 3/4 ounces for me in Virginia) the C&amp;D cost of $12.75 a pound
makes his stuff more palatable.

This is not a pressed cake.  It comes rubbed out like most of the C&amp;D blends. 
It is perique (a LOT of perique), red virginia and natural cavendish.  Craig
mentioned that he might have to raise the price on this particular blend by a
dollar or two because the perique is so expensive.  At the moment it sells for
the same price as his other blends.

I really think Craig has nailed this one, as closely as he has matched Balkan
Sobranie and 965.  I'll be curious as to what others think after trying it to
see if your impressions match mine.

You can call Craig at 1-800-433-0080.  Hope this leads to some enjoyable
puffing for Escudo fans.

&gt;Everything's fine, Norm! And I'm surprised you haven't been getting
&gt;the Digest, since it's been going to your old address at Olivetti all
&gt;this time without bouncing.

Well Steve and everybody else,

The good guys at olivetti have taken care of me and let me keep my old
account. However,  they changed office locations and I was not able to log
into the system.  It's been a year up here in WA and I just got email access
again (We do things the old fashioned way at Olivetti).  Anyway,  they told
me the other day that I need to clear out 8MB of email to save them some
room.   It was then that I suggested that they forward my mail to this
Olivetti Subsidiary.

Okay,  enough of that nonsense.  I frequent a particular pipe shop here that
sells their own tobacco brands.  I've found that I have grown to favor those
brands that have the word 'English' in them.  Typically they are not
aromatic, at least in the sense that no flavorings have been added.  Anyway,
this shop has a brand called 'Old English' which I like a lot and one called
'English Luxury' which is flavored so much that I feel like a kid with an
ice cream cone everytime I pack my pipe with the stuff (sticky fingers!).
Anyway my mind is certainly going because about every other visit I pick up
a pound of the wrong tobacco.  And because I'm cheap I smoke it. 

I'm thinking it's time to start mixing my own.  What opinions do you all
have over your own blends versus buying it in a shop.   Does it keep?  Will
a tobacco shop sell you the necessary stuff to mix your own blends?  Any
good recipes out there?

Norm

[ Good idea, Eeyore! One of these days, someone is going to market a
decent plastic "compromise humidor," somewhere between Tupperware and
Spanish cedar lined mahogany. -S. ]
 
	I was in my local tobacco store the other week, and they had plastic
humidors, nothing special, didn't look like they'd do the job as well as the
video case, but they were only $23, so that might be a start.  I'll be heading
out there tomorrow, so I'll look into it then.  If you want, I'll forward the
info so that it can be included in the next digest.
	One other thing, now that I think about it, they came with a Credo type
unit....again, more info once I make an effort to see it.

Yo, Steve!

It's been a while, so I just thought I'd check in with the latest.
 Preparations for our upcoming 

Expo (September 9 and 10) continue apace, and we even have a travel
agent who'll get discounted airfares for those who want to fly in for
the ocassion.  Anyone who wants more info on our show can e-mail
either me our our club's secretary/treasurer Jerry Lustig (Smokey
???@???.???).

In the meantime I wanted to pass along our latest newsletter which
follows.  BTW #1 - those of you in So. California take note that there
is indeed a pipe and cigar club in the area, and we'd love to have you
join.  BTW #2 - here's the particulars on tobacco blender Roy Fazalare
who's mentioned in the newsletter:

V.S.O.P. Tobacco &amp; Gifts
P.O. Box 1335
Agoura Hills, CA  91376

A tobacco price list is available (includes 25 V.S.O.P. blends plus 34 tinned
tobaccos).  Please add this to the resource guide.

Ihr Rauchenfreund,

                                                  JULY, 1995

HELLO FROM EXPO CENTRAL!

	Yes, friends - things are shaping up very nicely for our
upcoming Pipe &amp; Cigar Expo.  We'll give you an update, but first
here's some general news of the club...

	Our May meeting was held once again at the Scotland Yard pub.
It was a small turnout thanks to yours truly being late in getting the
newsletter out (sorry about that!), but a very pleasant gathering
nonetheless.  Congratulations go to Gordon and Sherri Soladar on the
birth of their new son, who happened to be born on the day of our
meeting!  Gordon rushed in just long enough to give us the good news
along with some very nice cigars to celebrate the ocassion.  Thank
you, Gordon - the cigars were great, and once again congrats from all
of us!

	Roy Fazalare was with us at the meeting, and once again
brought samples of his tobacco blends.  Now that his business is up
and running his selection of samples included some of the blends he's
now selling.  I tried some of his #902, which is a light English
blend.  This is a delightful mixture, and what I noticed especially is
that there is a very good balance between the Latakia and the Virginia
base.  What surprised me was that the balance was maintained
throughout the smoke, whereas with most English blends it seems the
Latakia tends to predominate, especially towards the bottom of the
bowl.  Roy told us about the various ins and outs of tobacco blending,
and as I heard what he had to say (while enjoying my bowl of #902) I
was impressed by his knowledge, which I think certainly shows in the
finished product.  If his other blends are as good as this one, then
all I can say is they're definitely worth experiencing!

	For our next meeting will will return to our old stomping
grounds at Fratello's.  We haven't met there since January.  Given the
fact that AB 13 has been in effect I didn't know they'd feel about
having us back, but the owner has given his "thumbs-up" to the idea,
so I thought it only fitting that we should have another meeting at a
place that's been supportive of us for the last three years.  Let's
show our appreciation by giving 'em a nice, big turnout!
	
	And now on to news of the Expo.  I talked recently with Shane
Pappas, who's arranging the cigar-related stuff for the show.  So far
it looks like we'll have representation for Punch, Hoya de Monterey,
Troya, Legacy, Hoya de Nicaragua and Don Tomas cigars, with more to
follow.  Shane is still in the process of nailing down some other
things for us, and we'll have a more complete report in the next
newsletter.  He has indicated that our cigar coupon book should net
the purchaser at least 20 cigars, and quite possibly more.  The price
of the coupon book will be $44.99 at the door, but can be
advance-purchased for $34.99.  This discount will be extended to all
club members regardless of whether or not they purchase their coupon
books in advance, but this applies ONLY to club members - everyone
else will have to pay the full price if they buy their coupon books at
the Expo.  By the way, even at full price this coupon book is a very
good value since it will be redeemable for at least $80 worth of
merchandise.  If you would like to purchase your cigar coupons in
advance please contact Shane at (800)232-1323. CREDIT CARD ORDERS WILL
BE ACCEPTED!  

	As we get closer to showtime a few reminders are in order.
First of all, there is the matter of publicity.  If you have pipe
and/or cigar-smoking friends, coworkers, etc. be sure to let them know
about the Expo.  We also need people to talk with the smokeshops they
do business with - whether or not they're local.  We are no longer
just a regional show and we need to let the people in the business
know this.  Also, it has been perceived that our Expo is mostly about
pipes.  I've wanted to change this, but before Shane got involved it
had been difficult.  Now that he's assisting me it is becoming clear
that cigars will be a more significant part of our show than they have
ever been.  Don't get me wrong - I'm still committed to promoting
pipes, but with the Expo my aim has always been to promote everything
having to do with pipes AND cigars.  Now we need to let all the cigar
smokers know that there really is a reason for them to come to our
event, and you can help do this.  Please remember that we have flyers
for the show, and we'll be glad to give you however many you want as
long as you use 'em.  If you want flyers please get in touch with
either myself or Jerry Lustig.

	The second item concerns donations to our club table and the
tobacciana auction.  Once again, this is a reminder that the proceeds
from the sale items at the club table directly benefit the club, and
the auction proceeds go towards defraying the show costs.  Please
search your closets, basements and any other storage areas for
anything you can donate - pipes, racks, humidors, books or anything
else related to pipes and cigars.  We have already received some very
nice donations, but we can always use more - and believe me, they will
be very much appreciated!  Our tobacciana auction will also be
including fine spirits, and we would also appreciate donations along
those lines (such as cognac, scotch, etc.).

	The third and last item concerns volunteers to help work the
club table, admissions table, and general assistance.  Jerry informs
me that only a few of you have responded with the sign-up sheet sent
out in the last mailing=2E I cannot emphasize enough how important it
is that we have your help at the show, and frankly we need a much
better response.  We aren't asking anyone to give up all or even most
of their time at the Expo to help us out - an hour or two would be
just fine.  Also please keep in mind that all volunteers will receive
a FREE cigar coupon book.  I know that we're still two months away
from the Expo, but that really isn't much time (as the organizer I can
attest to how fast it goes by!), so we need your response as soon as
possible.  We are including another sign-up sheet with this mailing.
The more volunteers we have the better the show will be run, and we
need all the help we can get!

	That's it for now.  See you on the 9th!

Steve Johnson
President

[ Thanks for the note, Steve! It may bear some edit marks, which were
needed to get out some special "=92" etc. characters. Best of luck on
the Expo -- please let us know how it goes! -S. ]

<a name="5">Subject: Pipe Digest- Pipes</a>

Steve:

Enjoy reading every isuue of Pipe Digest. I have not contributed in a while,
but today I shall briefly cover several issues:

1) In response to the question concerning pipe sweeteners, I believe that a
high quality pipe does not need any artificial sweeteners.  Just smoke a
favorite aromatic during the break-in period.  If one feels that a sweetener
is desirable ( a must for cheaper pipes) I have found that a mixture of
brandy and honey makes an excellent sweetener. I usually mix 90% brandy and
about 10% of honey.  One can use more honey to build the cake quicker and
thicker.

To apply just dip a finger into the mixture and apply a thin coating. Let the
coating dry about  10 to 15 minutes, then, smoke the pipe in a normal manner
with your favorite tobacco.
The flavor of the sweetener can be varied by the brandy used.  Appricot
brandy can be used if you like a fruity flavor for the smoke.

Experimentation with different mixtures can be a lot of fun.

2)  Tightening the stem for a tighter fit into the shank can be achieved in
several ways. I generally heat the part of the stem that fits into the pipe
over a medium gas flame (stove) while rotating the stem. When the vulcanite
is softened I press the tip against a cutting board or kitchen counter to
spread the stem. Then, quickly run cold water over the heated area to set the
new diameter.  Try the fit and repeat if required.

If one is afraid of melting the stem, the same method can be used by dipping
the stem into boiling water and applying pressure to enlarge the diameter.
 Again, cold water to set the new diameter.

3)  Kudos to Charlie Jewel for reporting his trip and the "Smoking
Encounters"....no matter which kind.  I hope he will travel near Durham, N.C.
and visit the "Duke Homestead".  This is a small museum operated by the N.C.
Division of Archives and History, and exhibits the development of tobacco
industry in the Carolinas.  Reenactments of growing and processing tobacco
are part of the exhibits and the history of the Duke family is chronicled.
We all know or have heard of DUKE UNIVERSITY ( painful words for a UNC
graduate) which the Dukes endowed.

If anyone is interested in more detail, here is the address:

Duke Homestead
2828 Duke Homestead Rd.
Durham, N.C. 27705

Tel. (919) 477-5498

Summer Hours:  Tue-Sat 10-5, Sun 1-5, Closed Monday.

If anyone is traveling via Interstate 85 through Durham, just take the GUESS
RD. exit and you are almost there, and it is FREE.  

(Steve: the above for the resource guide??)

4)  The work on the CORPS EXPO is moving forward. It will take place in
Richmond, VA on Columbus Day weekend, October 6-8, 1995.  Holiday Inn,
Central  will be hosting our exposition. This site was the location of our
exposition when Rick Hacker paid a visit to Richmond.  I still treasure my
copy of the collector's edition, THE CHRISTMAS PIPE,...autographed, of
course.

This year the CORPS is honoring the SANDBLAST PIPE.  The show marks the
beginning of the second decade expositions sponsored by the Conclave of
Richmond Pipesmokers and  each year the show has grown in size (# of tables)
and attendance.  I am glad we were able to obtain the location.  It gives us
400 sq/ft more of exhibit space than the location of past four years.

I am currently updating the "CORSHOW.FIL" file.  It is the mailing list for
the show brochures. If anyone anticipates attending the show and is not
already on the list, please E-Mail your "Snail Mail" address for the flyer
providing full details and registration form.

I shall keep providing information and news about CORPS  and the EXPO via the
Digest.

Its time to light my Nording filled with tobacco purchased from an
interesting shop in Temple, TX....The shop had a reasonable selection of
pipes, tobac, and pipe accessories.  The interesting part was that it was
located in the back of  a gun shop .... I had to travel past the gun racks,
weave my way through gun cases and vaults (some very large) to get to the
shop area.  I picked out some tobaccos and paid for them in the gun shop,
after leaving my card and CORPS information on the counter.

The tobacconist (owner) was available Monday, Wednesday, Friday....9AM-
11AM..

Briarwood Pipe and Tobacco Shop
2701 Ira Young Drive
Temple, Texas 76504

I was planning to visit during the "office hours", but my grandchildren had
other plans and was unable to chat with the owner.  Next time!

Until then......SMOKE WELL!  
VEJ &amp; the CORPS

[ Yes indeed! The Duke Homestead is now in the "Museums" section of
the Guide. -S. ]

Thanks to M. Arndt for Hicks'  article about Sherlock Holmes. As a former
English Lit major I enjoyed its thoroughness. 
It also prompted several thoughts-

1) do I remember Holmes being an Opium smoker?? I know very little about the
use of this drug- Isn't it smoked in a pipe?  Could the clay pipe have been
an opium pipe??

2) The article mentioned that Holmes had a cherry wood pipe. I have read
several things about Cherry Wood pipes- What is the real word on them? Do
they smoke well? Where can I get a good one to try out?

Thanks for the advise in advance!

<a name="7">Subject: You oughta be in...</a>

Steve,
It has been a very long time since I have contributed anything to the Pipes
Digest (# 170-something or so...) and, once again, before I explode, I offer
the following...

I attended the PCI in St. Louis last month, which makes a grand total of two
shows I have ever been to.  This time, I came with two friends, Jeff Rients and
Andrew Drapp (both of whom have been lurking in PD for several months) and we
had a blast!  I planned to only purchase a few nice pipes while there, but, in
the face of my biggest weakness--that is, pipe buying--- (and Rex Poggenpohl's
table :-{)&gt; ) I ended up purchasing fifteen pipes (including a wonderful Preben
Holm for $8 from Gordon Vogel of the Kentuckiana Pipe Club)...I had a great
time meeting other members of "OOPS" (Online Organization of Pipe Smokers)
including founder (and Bonfiglioli fanatic!) Dr. Ray Bromley...
I was also pleased and surprised to see Pat Callaghan, tobacconist and
all-around great guy, at the show...he told me it was only his second ever, as
well...(have I dropped enough names yet? :-{)&gt;  )  It was *definitely* the best
two days I've enjoyed in quite some time!  (...and I recovered from the
pipe-smoking contest in only a few hours instead of a few days this time)
                         U/~ ................. ~\U
Recently I received a phone call from a man named Robert Langsam, who is the
publisher and editor of a small, though growing magazine called "The Double
Corona" which is the "for the smoker, by the smoker" medium for the
International Association of Cigars Clubs (IACC)  Robert sent me a copy of the
Spring '95 issue, which contained several interesting articles, most of which
were written by members of the cigar clubs/groups which they formed.  These
articles, which describe the organizations and how they were formed, are meant
to help others who are have formed/are forming a cigar club/society/speakeasy
(in Keith and Dan's case :-{)&gt; )  If anyone is interested, I have the
address/phone for the IACC and the Double Corona as the following:

                            (813)-649-9655 (IACC)
I hope this info will be of help!

Also, through an incredible stroke of luck, I have been given the means to
own and manage what will become Bloomington/Normal's only pipe and tobacco
shop.  In approximately one year's time, my shop will be open for business (I'm
working with floor plans at the moment--and, any suggestions for a name? :-{)&gt;

<a name="8">Subject: Berlin Pipe Shops</a>

Dear Steve,

inn the last PD, J. Paine asked about Berlin pipe shops.  The best, by
far, is Kaernbachs, which was also in the last PD.  There are 2 others
that deserve a mention.  There is a Davidoff Store at the Kaufhaus des
Westens (KaDeWe).  Nice selection of pipes and tobaccos in all price
classes, especially Dunhills and Davidoff pipes.  They also have a
very well stocked humidore with just about every cigar made.  The
people that work there are more or less friendly, but don't know much
about tobacco and pipes ("I've never heard of Peterson pipes, young
man."  "Sorry 'mam, but there's 7 of them in your display window."
"Oh, Peterson...").

The other pipe shop worth visiting is Kiwus (Kantstrasse 56, 10627
Berlin).  They don't have a huge selection, but do have a little bit
of everything.  They have a lot of Savinellis and Bentleys, and a few
Dunhills, and, apparently, a decent suply of cigars.  The owner is
very, very friendly - a nice place to go just to talk and smoke a
bowl.  There is one other pipe shop that is supposed to be very good -
I plan on going there sometime this week, so I'll let y'all know.
'Til then, smoke in peace, Dave

<a name="9">Subject: Hello from Atlanta</a>

June 27, 1995

Dear Steve:

I've been a subscriber to Pipes Digest for about a month and wanted to let
you know how much I enjoy reading it every couple of weeks. I am a cigar
smoker (seriously for only about a year) and tend towards maduros. Most
recently, I've enjoyed Fuente's 8-5-8 s, Licenciados 400(?, 6 by 50), as well
as Hoyo de Monterey Excaliburs and Partagas. The Licenciados were puzzling:
some really fantastic, others rather loosely rolled, fast burning, very open
draw. I haven't tried their highly touted Toros, but was wondering if others
had experienced this type of variation in their product.

I also wanted to mention an interesting side trip I recently made. While
visiting in-laws in the Piedmont region of North Carolina, I remembered that
the warehouse/outlet for JR Tobaccos was in Statesville, NC. I got a little
bored so I made the hour drive over there, and I'm very glad I did: I was
like a kid in a candy store! A very good selection and, even more so, a very
courteous and helpful staff. They gave me maybe a half dozen good quality
cigars to try; in fact, I smoked two of them in the store during the almost
two hours I just browsed and talked.It was a very pleasant experience that I
thought perhaps others passing through the area might enjoy. JR's is located
on Interstate 77, one exit south of Interstate 40 in Statesville, NC. They
also told me they plan on opening a store in Selma, NC, on I-95.

Again, thanks for the subscription; I look forward to every issue.

Yours,

<a name="10">Subject: Update from Gaithersburg, MD</a>

Hello All,

For those who came in late, I'm a PD subscriber who has been on the road for
about a month, and am sending in an occasional update on the trip progress --

Since I left Kansas going east, here's what's happened:

6/22 - I got on the road at about 8am, just as my Aunt Jennie was going to
work and her husband and son, Phil and Corey were starting some more moving.

[This email message interrupted by a breaking weather bulletin: ** Wow!!! I
just heard a terrifying CRACK of thunder, and it must have been right over
the top of the condo complex here at my brother's where I'm staying.  It
probably wasn't, but boy was it loud!  It's pouring down rain, and if anyone
ever tells you that it doesn't rain in Maryland, let me know and I'll
straighten them out.  It's torrential here! ** Back to our regularly
scheduled emailing]

Anyway, as I was heading out of Emporia, I realized that I left some sandwich
fixin's, along with my squeeze bottle of mayonaisse in Jennie's refrigerator.
 No problem, I thought.  I'll just get some more of that stuff at the store.
 Would you believe, NOBODY has mayo in a squeeze bottle.  So, I stopped at a
number of stores along the way, trying to find a squeeze mayo, because when
you're making sandwiches on the road, it's a godsend.  Also, I was trying to
find block ice because the cooler is costing $1 a day to keep that crushed
ice in it!  I thought maybe a block would keep longer.  There's less total
surface area  to expose to melting.  I thought I'd give it a try, anyway.

When I stopped at the Dillon's store in Topeka, I was looking for it with the
help of a store-type person, and as I told the story to him about how I had
bought it in Boise, and accidently left it in Emporia, an old lady
interrupted and said, "You know, if you got that in Boise, there's a good
chance you won't find it anywhere else in the country."  I thought, "Huh? Did
she forget to take her medicine today or something?"  Then she went on to
explain:  "Boise and Salt Lake City are test areas for Safeway and Smith
Foods, which are the two big grocery chains in the country.  If they're just
testing something there, you probably won't see it anywhere else."  Wow...You
learn something new every day!  So, I got squeeze butter instead.  No block
ice there either.

Then I went down to the local "Grease Monkey" quickie lube place and got my
3,000 mile service.  Also, I asked there if anyone knew a place to get block
ice.  They suggested that if I wanted it bad enough, I could go down about 7
miles to the icehouse and maybe get it.  I didn't want it bad enough, I
guess.  Everyone keeps telling me, "No, nobody sells block ice anymore."  I
told them that I see it back home, but they didn't change their story. &lt;sigh&gt;

I got back on the road and eventually came to a little place in Missouri, I
think it was called Clinton.  I decided to check there for a solar shower.  I
decided that I couldn't go without at least washing my hair once a day, even
if I was living in the backwoods.  I'd stopped at various KMarts and Walmarts
along the way, and they always either were out of solar showers or didn't
carry them.  The last KMart I stopped at had one, but it was a really big,
thick black plastic bag and wasn't what I'd seen in the past, so I passed on
it.  At the Walmart in Clinton, there was also no solar shower, but I DID get
a little fisheye mirror for the pickup for $.97, and it was a dollar well
spent, although I wish I'd got the $1.67 model, in hindsight :)  While I was
there, I saw a cooler like one that my dad has that plugs into the cigarette
lighter, only it was about 1/2 the size (18 qt.)  Perfect!  It was $69.95,
but I figured that since I'll be on the road for another month or so, I'm
going to spend at least another 10 or 15 dollars on ice, so it's really that
much cheaper to get it now.  I've been using it and it works like a charm.
 But wouldn't you know it?  I walked out of the Walmart, put the cooler in
the pickup, plugged it in and was pleased with myself.  I closed the door,
walked over to the "Consumers" grocery store, and what did they sell there,
right out front?  You guessed it...block ice, $.89 a block.  I couldn't help
but be amused.  You know what?  I saw it in the next THREE stores along the
way.

That night, I slept in the parking lot of a little picnic area of a place
called "Long Shoal".  It was pitch dark, and lots of little fireflies flying.
 It seemed pretty well out of the way, and I figured that it was going to be
a nice, peaceful, quiet night.  I got in the canopy and laid back and lit up
a pipe.  It was very relaxing watching the fireflies, and as I puffed, to see
a soft glow come from the bowl in the dark.  After an hour or so of that, I
heard a pickup truck come barreling down the road, and I immediately got kind
of tense, thinking it might be some kind of park ranger coming to tell me I
couldn't park there.  It wasn't.  Turns out to be a couple of kids who hopped
out and were out for some extracurricular activity in the grass.  I guess I
was too far a way to hear for sure, but seemed like there was a bit of female
giggling, punctuated by an occasional "Stop it!"  I don't know if the guy
ever got anywhere or not-- believe it or not, I fell asleep and never did
hear the noisy truck leave.

6/23 - I was headed through Northeastern Missouri, heading for Kentucky.  I
stopped to get gas, and the wind was blowing something wicked, like it does
back home where I live in Kennewick, WA, only the sky was real dark and grey
and as I looked east, it go greyer.  I thought, "Oh neat, I'll get to see
more heavy duty rain."  (I like rain, but only when the canopy is sealing
good).  It was real blustery, and the sky looked different that I am used to
seeing, but I just chalked it up to it being a different area, and drove on.
 I stopped for gas and as I was pumping, the guy in the next car over said
that the clouds I was seeing were "funnel clouds", which are the predecessor
of a tornado.  Just as I finished pumping the gas, another guy said that he
just heard on the radio that a tornado touched down in the next town down the
road, only 9 miles way.  It was real windy, but we didn't see any tornado,
and we listened to the radio but didn't hear any kind of update on it.  I
would have parked my "house" in a safe place and waited, but we were pretty
much right out in the open, and I figured that being under the roof by the
gas pumps wasn't such a great place to be either, so since I couldn't hear
anything on the radio about any instructions otherwise, I waited for a few
minutes and when the wind died down a little, I just headed back down the
road, toward where the tornado was sighted.  I figured that if it were
sighted there, it would have to be gone
by the time I got there, and if it was coming west, I'd have seen it by then.
Besides, on the road, at least you have highway overpasses that you can park
under for a little protection.  Where I was, I felt a little vulnerable, with
the gas pumps, electricity and big metal roof over the pumps.  As it turned
out, I saw a road sign or two twisted up at the next town, but I have no way
of knowing if that was related or if someone just hit them with a car :/  I
didn't stop in that town, it was raining so hard and still windy, so, I went
on down the road without incident.

After that, I crossed the mighty Mississippi, and proceeded to head up into
Illinois -- You read right...No, I didn't intendd to go to Illinois, I meant
to go to Kentucky.  But I was going to Illinois.  By the time I got to a
place in the road that I could turn around (exit, actually), it was shorter
to go up the road another 12 miles and then back down to where I was headed.
 It turned out to be a very nice drive through the country.  I even saw a
little historical site, if you want to call it that-- I saw the grave of
"King Neptune", a pig that was a naval mascot that was auctioned off (?) for
war bonds during WWII to raise money for the war effort.  He died and was
buried out there in the country, along where the road is now.  I don't know
how he happened to be buried here, of all places.  Hmm...Apparently King
Neptune didn't rate a place in my AAA tourbook, but it was an interesting
diversion nonetheless.

I pulled into the "Land Between the Lakes" state (?) park, just as it was
getting dark.  It's a 50 mile (or so) mile stretch of land that's sandwiched
between Lake Barkley and Kentucky Lake (I think they're called).  I was
pessimistic about what I was going to have to go through to find a place to
camp, but I was pleasantly surprised!  I drove down about 15 miles, pulled
off onto forest road #113, drove down a tunnel of trees for about a mile (I
don't know how much further I could have driven down that one road of many
that I saw!) and then turned off onto a bare spot next to a dry creek bed.  I
pulled out Dad's trusty Maglight and also my 50,000 candlepower spotlight and
between the two was able to get the pickup settled in.  I turned off all the
lights and the engine and just listened.  It was dead quiet except for birds,
crickets and other forest noises, and pitch black besides.  Ahhh...so
peaceful!

There seemed to be very few, if any, mosquitos, and other bugs stayed away
until I left a light on for more than about 5 minutes.  Once I got settled
under the canopy, they didn't collect on the windows or anything.  I don't
understand why, but it made for a very pleasant evening.  I opened both side
windows and got a nice cool breeze coming through.  I didn't see another
person after leaving the main road, until the next morning (Saturday 6/24)
when I was getting ready to leave (even then, when those people saw I was
across the road from them, they packed up and moved down the road and I never
saw them again.)  That night was the most peaceful night I've spent in the
canopy, since leaving on the trip.  The other nights I survived just fine,
and wasn't uncomfortable, but I was always wondering who was going to walk up
and say, "Hey, you can't sleep here." or something like that.  Not at LBL (as
they call it)-- It was great.

6/24 - The next morning, I woke up and took my new solar shower and filled it
with the only water I had, other than good drinking water:  That was the
water from the big ice chest.  It had little floaters in it, but other than
that, it was basically clean.  In addition, I was unable to rinse the solar
shower out with baking soda and water, as the directions had said.  I didn't
have the luxury of having baking soda and a good source of water.  I walked
down to where some sun was coming through the trees, down in the dry creek
bed, and laid the solar shower on the rocks with the clear plastic facing up,
and black down against the rocks, as it said in the directions.  I went back
and rearranged the pickup a little, ate some grapenuts with bananas on it
with milk, cold from my new battery powered ice chest.  After that, and
cleaning up the cab of the truck, and studying the maps for a while, it had
been about an hour and a half.  I went down, collected the solar shower and
it seemed warm enough.  I threw the rope over a tree branch and tied it off.
 I threw a towel over another branch and was ready to wash my hair, finally--
Originally I had expected to just wash my hair, but it turned out to be such
an isolated location and was probably about a warm 74 degrees out, I decided
to tear a plastic grocery sack and make it into a makeshift shower floor, and
I was pleasantly surprised to find that the little solar shower, with only a
gallon or so of water, made for quite a nice shower!  I just wet down, then
soaped up, then rinsed off.  It was great to be clean again--  It was an
excellent $8 investment!  I figure that at the very least, if I can wash my
hair each day, I'll feel much better.

I debated about just staying there through the day, relaxing and then staying
at  LBL another night, but saw on the map that I could make it to a much
bigger park, and progress east at the same time.  The Great Smoky Mountains
National Forest was my next target!  I figured that if this park was so nice,
and the Smokies was so much bigger, it would be all the better for finding a
quiet spot to park and relax.  So, I got on the road and headed down the
remaining 35 miles or so of the LBL, stopping briefly at the LBL visitors
center, only to find that they wanted $.50-$.75 for a postcard! I said,
"forget it, I'll get better cards for less than a quarter at the grocery
store," which was true.  On top of that, the postcards weren't all that
great.  So, off to the Smokies I went.

I didn't get there until dark, although I had plenty of time.  I'll explain
later on that-- But when I got there, the first thing I read as I pulled into
the Smokies was, "Welcome to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park",
followed by another sign that said, "No Camping Except in Campgrounds" --
Well, I couldn't FIND any campgrounds, and there didn't seem to be any signs,
so I ended up driving half way through the Smokies in the dark (not seeing
any of the views, of course), then pulling into the parking lot at a
trailhead and sleeping in the canopy, regardless of the consequences.  Nobody
bothered me, but I'm sure it's only because they didn't know I was in there.
I got up at 6am and got on the road again. Before I got to the Smokies, I hit
a number of neat little towns along the way, including a place called Pigeon
Forge.  I'd never heard of it, but as it turns out, it's something of a major
attraction.  I would call it a cross between the lights of Las Vegas and the
atmosphere of Knott's Berry Farm. The traffic was unbearable, so I figured
I'd stop and look around.  An hour or so later, I was back on the road, and
it had cleared up a bit, only to get worse at several points, reaching
ridiculous proportions by the time you hit Gatlinburg, TN.  What a nightmare!
 Literally, you could walk from end of town to the other faster than drive.
 It would probably be a lot of fun if you WERE walking.  The streets were lit
up bright, clear into the night.  Something to consider if/when anyone wants
to go there sometime.  Remember, though, summer (schools out) is their real
big time.  The lady I talked to recommended coming just before/just after
school lets out/starts.

6/25 - After hours of zigzagging the Blue Ridge Parkway, I decided to get
off.  It was going to be a scenic tour all the way up to D.C., but it's a two
way road and when you've got to watch the road, and drive at 45 MPH or less,
you can't enjoy the scenery that much anyway.  I figured I'd seen enough
scenery and made an exit at a small town, the name I don't recall.

I stopped for gas in Johnson City, TN, and just as I was leaving noticed a
little laundry-mat, and I had a lot of clothes that needed some sweetening.
 I stopped and got the clothes going, then went down to a pay phone to try to
call my PD friend who offered to visit.  I wanted to meet with him, but I had
kind of accelerated my schedule and couldn't get ahold of him in time to
arrange something.   I tried several times while I was waiting for my clothes
to get done, but to no avail.  I finished my clothes, finally, and got back
on the road.

Later, I stopped at a rest stop and called again.  I guess he was out of town
this weekend because this time someone answered, but it sounded like his son
or daughter (it was hard to even hear through all the noise at the rest stop)
answered and said that he was out of town until the next day (6/26).  The
fine doctor from PD had offered me a place to stay, a shower and hot meal
if/when I made it through there, but it didn't look like it was going to work
out.

So, I called my brother, Andy, and he said, "Come on up!"  We figured that
since it was already about 7pm, I was going to have to be driving into the
wee hours anyway.  In light of that, I'd just take a nap and arrive at his
place just before he had to get up for work, rather than drive straight
through and arrive just after he'd gone to sleep.  So, here's what I did,
after Andy gave me PERFECT directions (no small feat, considering 1) the
complexity of the D.C. road system and 2) the short time he's been here):

I got off the phone with Andy, then looked at the map at the rest stop,
trying to transfer as much information as I could onto my LX.  There was
about 220-270 miles between me and D.C., and I wanted to make sure I stayed
on the right roads.  After that, I got on the road and made my way up toward
D.C., getting off on the wrong road once, and adding about 10 miles to my
total that didn't need to be there.

6/26 -  At about midnight, I was REAL sleepy.  It had POURED rain (and I
can't possibly overstate how much rain was falling.  I almost pulled over a
couple of times, and probably should have, because I couldn't see where I was
going, even with the wipers on high-- I followed the tail lights of the truck
ahead of me), and finally I thought to myself, "I have about 3 hours to kill
before getting to Andy's, or else I'll wake him up," so I decided to sleep
some of that time.  As I said, at about midnight I was real sleepy, so I
pulled off on a very convenient dead end road, set my alarm for one hour, and
about 10 minutes later (or so it seemed), the alarm went off.  I decided to
let myself sleep a couple more minutes, and when all was said and done, and I
got up, it had been 1 1/2 hours!  I got back on the road, afraid that I would
miss Andy and/or hit bad D.C. traffic if I got there too late.  When I got
back on the road, I was still tired, but I made it to the D.C. area and could
see that I had at least another hour before Andy had to leave, so I pulled
off at the last rest stop and slept for 1/2 hour.  It made all the
difference!  I followed Andy's directions, which were perfect, and I got here
at 4:30am.  Andy doesn't get up until 5:30am, but I couldn't remember if he
said 5 or 5:30, so I got out of the truck and found his front door.  He lives
in a real nice condo here with a couple of guys from Poland, Jacek
(pronounced YOT-zik) and Christopher.  Andy had left me a note on the front
door saying to come on in and find his room and wake him up :)  I came in,
went up the stairs to his room and woke him up--an hour before he had to be
up-- It worked out OK though because we talked a very little bit, and before
I knew it, he was ready for work.  While he got ready, I was worried about
how all of his things that I was bringing him had survived the torrential
rain, and whether or not the canopy leaked.  It did leak, but his stuff
didn't get too wet.  I brought it all in, and now I have TONS of room in the
canopy.  I didn't realize how much I was bringing until I got going on the
trip.  Andy had told me to just bring what I had room for, but I didn't
realize just what I had done.  But it worked out good because for the first
half of my trip out here, I haven't spent much time in the canopy, and now
Andy has all (I think) of his things in D.C. that he wanted to get out here.
 Now HE'S got to find some room here.  All his boxes are stacked up all
around in his room.

Anyway, Andy went off to work, so we hot-bunked it.  He took off and I
crashed in his bed and slept until about 11am, which wasn't too bad.  I got
up and Christopher wasn't here and Jacek was gone too, so I spent the first
day by myself all day.  I enjoyed it.  I caught up on my email and did a
little business over the phone (VISA, stock broker, ordering some tapes I
need, etc)

Last night, just before I fell asleep on the couch, Jacek and I were talking
and he asked if I minded if he smoked, as he lit up a cigarette.  He asked if
I smoked, and without really even thinking, I said "No", but then went on to
say that I took up pipe smoking about six months ago (it's interesting, and I
don't think too unique, that I don't think of myself as a smoker).  He said,
"Yeah, I smoked a pipe for a while, about two years ago."  He got out a bent
sandblast with a (hmm...what do you call it...)  gold swirled plastic (?) bit
on it, and a pouch of that "Borkum Riff" (is that right?) that is all dried
out (does anyone have a way that I can revive it without any special
equipment?)  His girlfriend showed up just about that time and we (or should
I say, "he") got sidetracked and we didn't get back to it.  I'll be sure to
get back on the subject tonight when he gets home.  I fell asleep on the
couch and woke up kind of late this morning.  And now, I just got up and am
just finishing this little update (maybe not so little ;)

So, that's about it for now.  I'll probably get to a pipe shop at some point
while I'm in the area.  If anyone has any suggestions for the D.C. area
(actually, the closer to Gaithersburg, in the Montgomery Village area, the
better), drop me a line.  My brother and I will certainly get out and about.
 I'm looking forward to spending time with him.  Right now, he's working, so
I just have to keep myself occupied inside, out of the rain.  So far, there
seems to be plenty for me to do, and when the rain stops, my brother says
that there are a number of places, such as the $1.50 movie matinee, within
walking distance that can keep me busy and help me avoid looking for a job ;)

I'll be in touch!  Drop a line if you get a chance.  My brother has a great
computer, so I've got wonderful email handling facilities at my disposal and
time to reply :)

New pipe collectors should know more about this to protect their

several years.  While this is only quietly mentioned today among the

surfaced a few months ago and come online in alt.smokers.pipes
introducing himself as a knowledgeable "old-timer" collector willing
to answer questions about pipes!  He claims getting out of smoking and
collecting due to a minor heart attack in July of 1985. Now you know
why there has been a stigma about using [a certain pipe product].

<a name="13">Subject: Pipe Stuff</a>

I wanted to update an address on the resource guide for you.  The Private
Smoking Club in Cincinnati's address is:
PSC
Mt. Lookout Square
3195 Linwood Ave.
Cincinnati, OH  45208
(513) 321-3278

I have gone to PSC off and on since it first opened and it is truly one of
the more unique establishments I have encountered.  It is not actually a
private club, which I initially thought, but a store, bar, lounge
aptmosphere.  Located in a former bank, the PSC offers three smoking lounges,
a full service bar, and a walk in humidor (that used to be the bank vault -
the large steel bank vault door is still there).  They have many many cigars
which is the main focus of their establishment, although they do carry some
pipe tobacco and pipe tobacco accessories (no pipes however) and various
imported cigs.  The first night I happened to go there (opening night) I
walked in and was greeted by a blue cloud of cigar smoke.  The men were
sitting around and looked as happy as pigs in mud to be able to smoke in a
comfortable environment without someone hassling them about the smell.  I
must say it was nice to have a cup of coffee and smoke my pipe without anyone
giving me dirty looks, but rather commenting on how nice it smelled.  They
have offered in the past brandy tastings, brunches. and the like.  If any
readers are interested in things of this nature or are passing through the
area, it is worth checking out.
     I also wanted to thank all those people who sent advice on how to fix
not only my melted stems but the calabash pipe I have.  I am happy to report
that both problems have been fixed.  I used a citronella "bug" candle for the
pipe stems  and it worked great.  Not only did the stems fit in the shank
tighter but I no longer have problems with mosquitos when I smoke.  I
dicovered how to fix the calabash by reading the Pipe Smokers Ephemeris.  I
don't remember the English gentleman's name who wrote this idea to the
Ephemeris, but it was so clever I thought I would pass it along.  One needs
to go to a desk office supply store, book store, or school supply department
in a department store and find stuff called plastic adhesive, which is the
material people use to hang up posters, etc. on the wall instead of tape.
 Take a bit of this and roll it out till it is like a long string.  Then take
the adhesive and wrap it around the bottom of the bowl of the calabash.  Once
it is wound completely place the bowl on the gourd and press down.  It seals
the pipe magnificantly!  Furthermore, it appears to be heat resistant and has
not marred either the gourd or the bowl in the time I have been using it
(about 20 smokes or so).  I only wish I would have thought of it first. . . .
 
Later,

Lenrd

for them in the Guide, but I've replaced it with the one you gave

Hi Steve,
	Please don't feel that I'm being picky.  I just wanted to mention

Steve,

I found the following article on the WWW page for The Free Radical, a 
libertarian newspaper from New Zealand.  Amoung the things these guys 
really hate (taxes, silly property codes, etc) are anti-smoking 
zealots.

I have the article on disk, if you feel it's too long for the digest, 
I'll be happy to e-mail it to whomever requests it - 
?????@???.??.??.?? - in that case, you may want to include their home 
page location  - <a href="http://newton.otago.ac.nz:808/~darnton/freerad.html">http://newton.otago.ac.nz:808/~darnton/freerad.html</a>

Otherwise, here it is!

=======================================================

PLEASE, NANNY, MAY I HAVE A CIGARETTE?

David Cohen

They never seem able to make up their minds which is the most beautiful word 
in the language - 'compulsion' or 'forbidden'.

Robert O. Ryder

There's no getting away from it. We tobacco puffers must face facts, chief 
among them that passive smoking - literally, the putting into the environment 
of our cruel fumes - has become the world's leading cause of silly 
statistics.

Getting there hasn't been easy. Over the years there have been any number of 
nonsense figures, circulated by any number of nonsense spokespeople with 
nothing to back their claims up other than a certain belief in the power of 
statistical repetition to make an imprint on society at large. In the case of 
New Zealand, that belief is well founded.

Thus, on the basis of loose speculation by an excitable Indiana
sexologist, it was once widely claimed in this country that 4 percent
of the population was homosexual. The figure then climbed to 10
percent. By the time this article reaches print, it will probably have
bulleted to 25 percent. Any of these figures may well be accurate; the
point is that no one really knows for sure, least of all the claimants
themselves - upon whom the burden of proof logically rests.

&gt;From a libertarian point of view, of course, it really doesn't matter
if 4, 10 or 25 percent of the population is homosexual. The numbers
are of no political moment. But when groups such as Greenpeace enter
the fray with fanciful findings on the damage allegedly being wrought
by big business to the environment - the extinction of one actual
species every day, according to a recent press release - they should
be called to account because they wish actual political harm on the
industrialists. Scrutiny of the same order is also due to the frenzied
brigade whose style it is to use unproved and unprovable assertions on
the dangers of passive smoking to bring about a prohibition on
cigarette consumption among adults.

Take, for instance, a crude claim put about this year on most of the
international and local wire services concerning the harm suffered by
"passive cigarette smokers". Extensive research, it said, has
conclusively established that the incidence of lung cancer is an
astounding 20 percent greater among non-smokers who live with smokers
than it is among those non-smokers who do not.

The research was taken from two sampled groups of 100,000 non-smokers. 
Among the first, whose members has not cohabited with a smoker, ten 
developed lung cancer. Among the second, whose members had cohabited with 
a weed fiend, 12 developed the same.

In other words an entire statistical edifice was constructed on the
basis of two deaths over 100,000 lives!

Professor Peter Lee, an epidemiologist who has interpreted many cancer 
studies, and who presumably is not in the treacherous employ of the tobacco 
industry, clearly felt it was a case of smoke and mirrors!

"The 20 percent link is so small it is impossible to say it does not
arise from various other known sources of medical bias," he told
Britain's Daily Telegraph

"The politically correct climate of our time," he added, "has created
a corrupting bias, making scientists nervous of publishing a paper
that establishes no connection between (passive smoking) and cancer,
lest his career be held back."

So much for the 20 percent increase in deaths caused by passive
smoking.  So much, too, for another illustrated report carried
internationally this year on another death caused, we are told, by
passive smoking in an English household.

For reasons of family sensitivity, the victim in this case could only
be identified as Polly. She succumbed to lung cancer after sharing her
adult life with a chain-smoker, it was reported.

Poor Polly. Her obituary was, in every way, intensely moving, except
for the inconvenient fact that it was completely untrue. For one
thing, she was a budgerigar [ anyone have a definition? RA] - arguably
the most deserving candidate for Greenpeace's endangered list. More to
the point, however, no post-mortem ever took place on the dead bird,
leading sensible people to treat the report for the arrant fiction it
clearly was.

(One hilarious study, published in Holland shortly after Polly's final
squawk, cheekily suggested that keeping birds can increase one's
chances of lung cancer nearly seven times. The Dutch anti-smoking
fraternity was reportedly unamused!)

This didn't stop the local protestations of those who have made it
their life's calling to censor the habits of others of which they
personally disapprove.

"I have so many reports to show that animals are at risk from passive 
smoking," Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) spokeswoman Janie Weir 
told The Free Radical last month. "They did do an autopsy on that bird, and 
they found the bird had been smoked out."

Ms Weir promised to supply verification - it hasn't yet arrived - on this 
autopsy which never took place, and which has, in Britain at least, been 
denounced by veterinary pathologists as a foolish hoax. At the same time she 
wanted to underscore for readers that her 1000-strong organisation was not in 
any way opposed to personal liberty.

"We're not authoritarian," she said. "We're doing no more than
challenging the tobacco industry to be more honest. We're challenging
their credibility if you like.

"I think ASH was perceived as radical when it began in 1982. But as
the Western world has moved, that's changed. I think you'll find that
in the United States they're more radical than we are."

On the last score, she is probably right. A queer paradox of
contemporary America is that while it boasts, rightly, to lead the
planet in the ways of individual liberty, it has from time to time
behaved as one of the most ludicrously intolerant political entities
imaginable.  Suspected communists and known alcohol drinkers have
already this century felt the weight of American-style
authoritarianism; now it is cigarette smokers who must face the feds,
headed in this instance by FDA commissioner David Kessler.

"Give us your tired and your poor," the likes of Mr Kessler enjoin us
from Washington DC, "give us your huddled masses yearning to breathe
smoke-free, and we will give them bureaucratic rest!"

Indeed they will. A recent edition of Time turned over one of its
precious covers to the very real likelihood of a new tobacco
prohibition in the States, speculating that it is no longer a matter
of if but when an interdiction with take effect.

Quoted in the same issue was Jonathan Fielding, a public health
professor currently based in California but ultimately destines, one
assumes, for Teheran.

"Smoking has become associated with lower educational attainment and
lower social status," he argued. "It becomes divisive in a sense. In a
country where we have too many things that divide people, this is just
another dividing us."

Can a geo-religious strain be discovered here? Or is it just
coincidence that all the world's most sternly anti-smoking countries -
the United States in particular, but also Canada, Great Britain,
Australia and New Zealand - happen to be largely Protestant, with all
the self-flagellation and paralysing guilt that such a tradition
exists?

Certainly, within Roman Catholic countries such as France, cigarette
users almost universally cry "Egalite! Liberte!" and smoke on. Pretty
Jewish soldier boys and girls in Jerusalem cradle Uzis and puff Kent
filters with impunity on the Mount of Olives, while Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin chain-smokes his way through Knesset meetings. And in
Shinto-Buddhist Japan, not only do more people smoke than anywhere
else in the industrialised world (roughly twice the rate of New
Zealand, according to the World Health Organisation) but they also
enjoy a greater life expectancy that anywhere else and have one-third
of the West's per capita incidence of lung cancer!

Yes, WASP countries such as our own do seem to have an attitude that's
all their own.

Last summer, by way of example, I was seated outside one of those
faddish Wellington cafes where the tables are placed along the
sidewalk of Willis Street to lend the establishment what the
proprietors evidently hope to be a funky European feel.

Presently, a couple was shown to another outside table. Once seated,
the guy looked through his menu. His partner, on the other hand,
seemed distracted by an object which someone had left before them.

Motioning to the waitress, she asked if the disgusting object - an
empty ashtray - could be removed. This the waitress did, even as I
stole a glance at this drab creature relaxing her features and
proceeding with her mate to enjoy an undisturbed hour of food, drink
and exhaust fumes from the passing traffic.

What are the roots of such frankly bizarre behaviour? Is it nature,
nurture or Nietzsche? No doubt, psychiatrists' case books shed light
on this difficult question, but just common sense, it seems to me,
suggests that valley girls who passively imbibe vehicle pollutants
cannot be taken seriously in their objection to passive smoking (or
passive ashtrays).

Towards those private New Zealanders who choose to remain so
self-deluded, one can have tolerance, but, for those who currently
give political weight to their displeasure, there is a much more
important response: contempt. For it is they who are the true
undesirable smokers - emerging, as they have, from underneath a purple
haze of cooked statistics, quarter-baked notions of proper individual
behaviour and burnt-out Stalinoid impulses, polluting the air of
liberty with their discontent.

There is an overwhelming body of statistical evidence that the
proliferation of such types is very dangerous for any individual's
health.

"These leaves make friends, and celebrate with gentle rites the vows
of peace.  They have given consolation to the world. They are the
companions of the lonely - the friends of the imprisoned, of the
exile, of workers in mines, of fellers of forests, of sailors on the
desolate seas. They are the givers of strength and calm to the vexed
and wearied minds of those who build with thought and dream the
temples of the soul.

They tell of hope and rest. They smooth the wrinkled brows of pain -
drive fears and strange misshapen dreads from out the mind and fill
the heart with rest and peace. Within their magic warp and woof some
potent, gracious smell imprisoned lies, that, when released by fire,
doth softly steal within the fortress of the brain and bind in sleep
the captured sentinels of care and grief.

These leaves are the friends of the fireside, and their smoke, like
incense, rises from myriads of happy homes."

<a name="17">Subject: New  Stores, cigars and pipe</a>

Hello Steve, 

Thanks for all the great Pipe Digests over the past couple of months since I
joined the group. I look forward to these more and more. I have particulatly
enjoyed the Sherlokiana and other literary contributions of the members.

I thought I would pass on a couple of my " finds " in tobacco establishments
 that I have enjoyed lately in the San Francisco area on the peninsula.

The First is a new shop in the Willow Glen area of San Jose, actually in the
South Bay , This is mainly a cigar establishment that plans to offer pipes in
the future The unique aspect of this family run operation is a smoking room,
complete with overstuffed furniture and a big screen TV. I hope this is a
trend starting in stores. It is great to have a place to smoke among friends!
I enjoyed an Avo Preludia in the smoking room while there but could have used
some more company. The store is open 7days a week and has the possibility of
becoming an oasis for southbay cigar fans. The address is:   
               
                                   Willow Glen Cigars and Tobacco
                                   1068 Lincoln Ave   (at Garfield)
                                   San Jose, CA  95125
                                   Phone  408 283 9323

Another find is the:        Burlingame Smoke Shop 
                                   1400 Burlingame Ave
                                   Burlingame CA 94010
                                   Phone 415 343 3363

This store has actually been in business since 1930 but has been recently
remodeled and expanded. They have a great selection of cigars and will rent
keeps (small lockers)  that are part of their walk-in humidor. Although they
don't have a smoking room this location is fast becoming a hang out for cigar
afficianados, there are benches in front of the store where one can enjoy a
leisurely smoke, some conversation, and watch the passing scenery. 

On a recent visit a matronly woman with a nice smile stopped outside to chat
and suddenly realized that her olfactory senses were experiencing something
different, "Am I standing in front of a cigar store" she exclaimed.  After a
pause and a smile she added, " It smells good" .  I think she was surprised
that her senses were telling her that cigars had a very enjoyable aroma.( I
was smoking a Zino Mouton Cadet #6 at the time and there were several other
cigar smoking customers inside adding to the scented draft wafting out of the
store's entry) . We had a pleasant exchange and she left smiling.

They have a selection of Dunhill pipes and several house blends of tobacco,
The selection of tinned tobaccos is limited to some Dunhill and McBarren
blends. I tried the Mild English house offering and it was excellent. 

Thats all for now 
JR

Does anyone have any info. on the new Arturo Fuente cigars called Opus X..
Specifically would like to know what will be available, when and where as
well as cost and specs.  I presume a premium Dominican, but questions abound
about a new cigar.

From: Scott Bukofsky &lt;???????@???????.???.????.???&gt;
<a name="3">Subject: Hello</a>

Steve,

  I wanted to post to the pipes digest, I hope I am sending to the 
correct address.  If not, please let me know.

  Anyway, I have been receiving the digest for a while now, and have 
enjoyed it immensely.  I thought it was time to introduce myself.  My 
name is Scott Bukofsky, and I am doing my doctoral work in Applied 
Physics at Yale University.
  I started smoking a pipe about six years ago, mostly smoking aromatic 
blends, especially a blend called "Don Pepe" from the De la Concha 
tobacco shop in NYC (Try it if you are nearby!).  I smoked for a couple 
of years, and then gradually started smoking cigars.  For the past 3 
years, I have been smoking cigars exclusively.  My favorites are the Hoyo 
Exalibur #3, Fonseca 5-50, and anything by A. Fuente (especially maduro).
  Last week, after a several year hiatus, I got my pipes out of storage 
and decided to start smoking them again.  After trying a few English 
blends, someone gave me a bowl of McClellands #25 to try.  I am 
absolutely in love!  I think this is straight Virginia, and it is truly 
satisfying.  Does anyone else enjoy this?  How about something similar to 
try?
  Well, that's it for now.  I am looking forward to future issues. If 
anyone is ever in New Haven, CT, look for the Owl Shop in town- it is one 
of the oldest and friendliest tobacconists I have ever encountered. 
Drop me e-mail and we'll share a smoke.

Dear Steve
Here is my simple advices on  to buy,to choice,to fill,and smoke the pipe. 
1) PIPE'S CHOICE
   I know people prefer rounded pipe,becouse it's more covenient,but for the
beginners,I suggest straight pipe,that is easier to smoke,suggested
models:billiard,canadian,apple,military.How many?Almost 7, one for day.
2) HOW TO FILL
   Charge full bowl,light uniformoly with matches,smoke 3/4 times in same
way and then just 3/4 with half filled bowl.Everyme will choose best way
then repeat  with full bowl,for a correct pipe's carbonization,
3) THE SMOKE
   Smokes slow and spaced-out,by eluding tougue's and palate's itch.Use
often pipe's temper for pressing the tobac by a right burning: and it pipe
is burning out quietly lighting again.
4) TOBACCO
   Not more thin( because  it burns rapidly ) not more aromatized ( because
it probably bores ) my advice is a medium-regular tobac,more right for the
beginners.
5) PIPE'S CLEANING
   After every smoke clean pipe, and there put it by. Never remove the stem
with hot pipe,by eluding shank's and steam's breakage during the smoke use
pipe clean against  condense.
It's easy smoking pipe, it's enough follow my suggestions with a good dose
of will. 
Good pipe's smoke to everyone.

P.S. I'm looking for two calumet pipes indian's original,please if someone
knows were is possible to find its contact me.... thanks!!! :)

<a name="5">Subject: PIPES and things</a>

Steve, et al:

I've been studying back issues of PD and have been real impressed by the ease
with which Pipes Digest became tobacianna digest. It suddenly dawned on me
around issue 16 or so that I was reading about cigars. This is a nice change
from other newsgroups I've explored (I'm working on a freelance article about
new users on the net and how they are treated.) In some newsgroups,
especially the more sordid, there's a real generation gap and NEWBIES,
especially those from AOL and Prodigy, are despised and not encouraged to
join. While I'm sure our humble moderator has filtered much waste from the
pipeline, this group has a certain civility towards newcomers that must be a
result of tobacco use.

BTW, Steve: I'd love to see some things that didn't make the digest. Do you
respond to the party with a hearty "Nevermore?"

Lately I've been on a pipe smoking kick while a number of cigars (the only
decent ones I could get around here) reconstitute in my humidor. I even broke
down and bought a new pipe: a half bent Denicotea Classic which smokes well,
but has an odd filter--a small tube filled with clear crystals. Can someone
give me info about this? Can it be cleaned, or must it be replaced? Where can
I get more? I also own a Peterson System pipe (stupid question: Do the stems
on these come out? It doesn't seem to want to and I've not forced it.)

The gem of my collection is a three-and-a-half inch long, quarter bent
Albanian briar. It's completely handcarved, including the wooden bit. It's so
small it's easy to take on the road. It smokes well and can hold a good 20
minutes worth of tobacco. (My collection rounds out with three easy-smoking
cherrywood "corn cobs.)

Enough net hogging. Special thanks to Charlie Jewell for taking time out of
his adventure for a brief visit. I wish him the best of luck and encourage
all PDers to meet with him if you can. He's fun to talk to (great stories
about computers, yuppies and various nuclear powered things) and could
probably use a solid meal.

Smoke 'em if you got 'em,

DL

p.s. While visiting a Peace Corps buddy in Atlanta I stumbled across:

                 The Ultimate Cigar and Gourmet Coffee
                 1381 Morrow Ind. Blvd
                 Morrow, GA

It features great coffee, a great selection of pipes and cigars, and a great
smoking room. Ask for Rosemary.

p.p.s. Charlie Jewell, I hope to catch you on your return trip, but if you're
still on the road in late August, look me up at Ole Miss.  --DL

[ Well, DL, I really haven't had to throw much stuff out at all!  In
fact, once in a while, a member grumbles about the length of the
Digest... but I pretty much print everything that comes in. The
toughest part comes when, once in a while, someone says something that
could get himself, me, or some possibly innocent third party
hurt... and the originals of those are discarded.  Some of those I've
printed after editing, and wished I hadn't. 

BTW, I think the no-flame policy has really helped in making newcomers
feel welcome. -S. ]

Dear Steve,

Whenever someone mentions a store's address, you reply by saying, "It's in
the guide."  What is this magical guide, and how can I obtain it?

Also, I just returned from a two-month trip through Israel, Greece, Turkey,
and Egypt.  On my way home I had a two-day stop in Amsterdam, and had the
pleasure of visiting what is self-described as "the last of the elegant
tobacco shops," P.G.C. Hajenius.  From the immaculate decor, to the extensive
selection of its walk-in humidor, and even to its extremely helpful staff,
everything about this store was perfect.  The humidor offers a wide variety
of Cuban cigars, as well as every variety of Davidoff.  The also have a large
selection of Dutch cigars (in Amsterdam, go figure!), which are made from a
combination of tobaccos, including Cuban.  Upon recommendation from a fellow
PD subscriber, I purchased a box of De Olifants, Ivory size, which are made
with Cuban, Brazilian, and Italian tobaccos; excellent!  I also bought a
Cohiba Esplendidos for my dad for Father's Day, and a Robusto for myself to
share with him.  The staff was extremely generous in helping me package my
cigars for travel, including giving me free of charge three small
humidifiers.  If your travels ever take you to Amsterdam, make it a point to
check this place out!

And of all the countries I visited, Turkey's airport customs was the cheapest
for buying cigars (or anything else for that matter!).

Steve, all cigars in this shop are hand rolled on-site and are exceptional
in quality.  The place isn't much to look at, but the smokes are as good as
any over-priced name brands a tourist would buy in the gift shop at the
big casinos.  The place is for real smokers!

Incidentally, seems as though pipe and cigar shop owners are not as up
to speed on technology as the smokers themselves.  I ask shop owners
wherever I go if they know about this e-collection of afficianados,
and none have yet.  Personally, I appreciate that.  To paraphrase
Groucho Marx, I don't want to buy a smoke from someone who's got the
technology to sell it to me!

Steve,

I couldn't help noticing that there have been many requests for a moderately
priced humidor for those not in the jet-set or for traveling. I don't want
to place a full born ad, but I manufacture a $25 humidor which is currently
selling in tobacco shops in 40 states. It provides a perfect 72% humidity
at all times. The humidifier works far better than the Credo Rondo. The whole
package is called "CigarStor".

If the readers can not find CigarStor in their area, they can call me
at 404-237-7340 and I will direct them to a nearby tobacconist selling
the product.  I will also be at the R.T.D.A. trade show, so readers
might tell their local tobacconist to look for us.

I know how frustrating it is to have dry cigars or pipe tobacco. That's why I
designed CigarStor. I wanted all the readers to know that the product does ex
exist. Just ask your local tobacconist.

<a name="12">Subject: Heading out of D.C. soon</a>

Hello fellow PD readers,

If you came in late, I'm a PD subscriber that's been on the road, traveling
the U.S. for the last month+ and I'm kind of passing on the daily happenings
(weekly or so :) to the PD readership.

6/26/95 - After spending all day inside here at my brother's place in
Gaithersburg, MD, Andy got home from work and we took walk down by Lake
Whetstone, a manmade lake below the condo complex where he lives.  It's
really a nice little lake, with places to sit along the way.  After walking
about 15 or 20 minutes, we got to the end of the lake and walked up the hill
to the main road (Montgomery Village) and crossed the street to a local mall.
 I had a hankerin' for a milkshake, and would you believe we couldn't find
anyplace that had them?  In the process of wandering this little mall,
though, I was surprised to find a small tobacco shop!  The place is called:

Tobacco Shack
19328 Montgomery Village Avenue
Gaithersburg, MD  20879
(301) 963-0330

I didn't get a chance to talk to anyone.  It's also something of a
convenience store, selling a lot of cigarettes, junk food, magazines, etc.
 But I was really surprised to see that they had a pretty fair selection of
pipes, tobacco and such, as well as a humidor for the cigar fans.  There is
another Tobacco Shack close by, too:

Tobacco Shack,
12615 Wisteria Dr.
Germantown, MD
972-2905
(Sorry I don't have the area code or zip, I'm getting this out of the phone
book here)

Since I'm on a budget, having no income right now, I've really had a hard
time fighting off the urge to buy when I'm in these places, but so far have
done pretty good since I left Colorado.

&lt;time warp occurs here&gt;
Somewhere in the weeks past on my trip across the U.S., I went through a
small town and got into a casual conversation with a nice lady who turned out
to be a psychologist.  We ended up having a very interesting conversation
that I will relate.

I am purposely being vague about where the town is at, population between 20
and 30,000, and some unimportant details have been changed to help disguise
the people and place.  The psychologist purposely left out names and details
to these stories when she told me about them, but you can read them knowing
that in essence, they are all real.

I'll call this person, "Mary".  Mary was an incredible conversationalist, and
working in a mental health clinic, she had lots of interesting stories.  With
the disclaimer that mental illness is not a laughing matter, I must say that
in spite of that, things happen in life that are just...well, funny.  I can't
help it.  Here are just a few funny tidbits:

Mary had a case where a gentleman made some kind of demand over the phone,
and she was not able to give him what he wanted (he wanted an appointment or
something and she simply couldn't accomodate him).  He responded with, "OK,
well, I'm just going to have to kill myself then."  Of course, they take all
threats of suicide as serious, and she went over to his house to deal with
the problem.  When she arrived at his house, he was laying on the couch out
of breath and his live-in girlfriend was comforting him.  Apparently he had
tried to kill himself (remember, this is a true story) "by wrapping his hands
around his throat and choking himself to death."  No lie-- As he recounted,
"Luckily my girlfriend is a strong woman and was able to pry my hands lose."
 I'm not making this up.

Another case was similar, although I don't recall the reason for why this
woman was upset, but she threatened to kill herself by going down to the
beach, stripping herself naked and laying there waiting for someone to come
along to rape and murder her (she never did follow through on this threat, to
my knowledge).

One woman, in her fifties, had been a chronic case ("a regular").  Mary
relayed this story to me to illustrate how some people manipulate the system
to their like crazy (so to speak) once they get to know what they can get
away with.  The woman called Mary and talked for a while, then said that she
decided that she wanted to be committed to the state mental hospital.  Mary
was taken aback by this and said, "Why?"  The woman said that she had friends
there and wanted to be with them.  Of course, Mary couldn't go along with
this, committing a person to a state mental hospital because the patient
wanted to be with her friends.  So, Mary told her that she couldn't do that,
but she could make her an appointment to come in and talk about.  The woman,
being very familiar with the system, having been in it for years, said in a
very non-chalant voice (like she was talking about making a trip to the
library), "Mary, you leave me know choice.  I'm going to have to kill myself.
 I'll see you at the hospital." and she hung up the phone.  Sure enough, the
ambulance went over to the woman's house and found that she had taken a
bottle of pills.  Mary met the ambulance at the hospital and after pumping
the woman's stomach, was able to talk to her.  The woman was furious when
Mary told her that because she had attempted suicide, she would have to be
committed for treatment--at the clinic there in town.  Life just isn't fair.

To bring this all around to something more serious, mental health
professionals have a very stressful job, as I could tell from talking to
Mary.  Joking about things that happen in the course of business is a common
release among therapists.  Mary herself has recently begun therapy because of
some of the experiences that she has had in the process of doing her job.
 She has been molested by patients, twice, and her management refused to back
her in legal action against the patients, because they "weren't about to sue
one of their patients."  Apparently they were concerned about the publicity.

She is also beginning to experience post traumatic stress disorder after a
case where she was called in by police to talk to a man who was very drunk
and had locked himself in a suburban and was threatening to kill himself.  As
she talked to him, he repeatedly slashed his throat and wrists, a total of
10-15 cuts, and bled profusely as she tried to talk him out of the car.  In
the process, she did begin to form a relationship with the man and was
progressing toward getting him to come out.  As she talked to him, the police
(without ever telling her that they planned to do this), seized the first
opportunity they had to break out a window and dive into the vehicle to pull
the man out as he screamed, "Mary! Help me!  Why are they doing this-- Stop
them!"  She had no idea that it was going to happen, and could only stand by
helpless.  She eventually was able to get into the ambulance with him and try
to put some kind of closure on the incident.  When it was all over, she was
covered with blood (his), and had to leave him at the hospital in police
custody.  The case was "over", but they say that even in a short encounter in
a life and death situation like that occurs, people develop a very strong
bond, like when people survive a plane crash together.  I've forgotten what
it's called.  Mary's a tough lady.

&lt;back to a real time&gt;
7/1/95 - Andy and I decided to head down to Accokeek, VA to visit a colonial
farm across the river from Mt. Vernon.  The farm was established to save the
view as it was when George Washington lived.

We didn't get on the road soon enough, I guess, because traffic caught us up
and we decided as we were passing the exit to "Old Alexandria", Virginia,
that we weren't going to make it to the old colonial farm before closing
anyway.  So, off to Old Alexandria we went.

Andy had been there before, so he took us to a place called Murphy's Irish
Pub.  It was a nice little place where we got lunch and had a couple of
Harp's beers (an Irish brew).  It was a neat little place, and Andy says that
usually there's someone there on stage playing Irish music, although we only
saw an empty stage when we were there.

As we left, we saw a Scottish gentleman on the street corner, all decked out
in a kilt and beret (is that what you call what they were), smoking a
cigarette.  We asked him if he knew of a tobacconist in Old Alexandria, and
he said, yes, he did.  In a very distinctly Scottish accent, he pointed us
down the road to a place called "The Scottish Merchant".  There may have been
other tobacco shops, I don't know.  I guess it's not surprising that he sent
us to this one :)  The place is actually kind of two stores in one.  It's
"John Crouch Tobacconist and The Scottish Merchant".  They sell gentleman's
kilts and ladies kilt skirts as well as wool scarves and tams, balmorals,
glengaries, tartan ties, shawls, stoles, travel rugs, trousers, blankets,
golf caps and more.  They have a lot of clan crest items and other Scottish
heritage items.  It was very interesting.  On the tobacco side, there was a
humidor and a wide variety of pipes.  They also do a lot of shipping outside
the country, and in fact, when I was talking to the clerk there, he had just
finished wrapping up a package to a place in Europe (I'm afraid I don't
remember just where, but it was an embassy, actually).  The address and
phones:

John Crouch
215 King Street
Alexandria, VA  22314
(703) 548-2900

I thought they had an 800 # too, but I don't see it on any of their
information.

After we left there, we wandered around a little more and ended up back by
the Scottish restraunt again.  As we decided to head back to the car, I had a
very interesting experience that I'm still trying to deal with.  A little
background is in order-- In 1988, the company I worked for was downsizing and
was offering a  voluntary layoff.  There was a monetary incentive to
volunteer to be laid off.  At the time, I was struggling with a decision to
leave anyway, because I had always thought of joining the Marine Corps but
went to college instead.  When the VROF (voluntary reduction of force) came
up, I took that as an opportunity to leave and join the officer ranks of the
Marine Corps.  It all starts, though, with a very intense 2 1/2 months course
called "Officer Candidate School" where they put you under a great deal of
mental, but mostly physical, stress and see if you have what it takes to lead
Marines into battle.  Well, I did well, but it wasn't for me, and I dropped
in the last week of the program.  It was a decision that I know was right for
me, but it has haunted me a bit ever since, wondering what might have been.
 In the process of dropping, the platoon commander, company commander, etc.
weren't too happy with what I had to say.  Now, back to Alexandria:

As Andy and I walked back for the car, I walked within 4 feet of my platoon
commander from O.C.S.  It was a complete shock.  The last person in the world
that I expected, or even wanted, to see again, and I almost walked right into
him.  Of course, he didn't recognize me, but I sure recognized him.  I was in
such shock that I just stopped and said to Andy, "Do you know who that was?"
 And I told him.  Meanwhile, my old boss went right on down the sidewalk.  I
wasn't thinking straight then, and we just got in the car and drove off.  I'm
now trying to decide if there was some higher meaning to that chance
encounter.  What are the chances of driving clear across the country, to
spend one day in Alexandria, then walk into one of about 60 people in my
platoon that I thought I'd never see again (much less, the single most
influential person in my life at the time)?  I will be leaving the D.C. area
tomorrow, and now I have to decide if I'm going to try to contact the fine
Lieutenant (most likely Captain by now), and then if I do, what will I say?

7/3/95 -  Andy and I made another stab at the colonial farm, and found it
very interesting.  Among other things, we saw how they grew and cured tobacco
in the old days.  We saw tobacco actually dried in a barn, and it was
tempting to grab a handful and take it home.  But, not only is it against the
rules (probably...I didn't see any sign that said we couldn't, and it was a
self guided tour), but there's probably other steps that have to be taken on
the tobacco to make it smoke right.  It was a full little side trip and
didn't cost anything.

7/3/95 - Waiting for Andy I went down to the lake and did some transcribing
from my little taperecorder onto the computer.  At the same time, I enjoyed a
pipe sitting on the parkbench.  At the last minute, I decided that I was
going to be late meeting my brother, so I packed up the computer and tape
recorder into my fannypack in a hurry and ran off in time to meet him.  We
went over to have dinner at my sister's house and boy was it great!
 Afterward, I got to fishing around in my pocket and realized that I didn't
have my fancy little pipetool.  Darn!  I hope I didn't leave it in the park.
 What are the chances that it would still be there?  Andy estimated about
10%.  It was about 10pm, but he agreed to take me down there, and sure
enough, it was sitting right there where I left it!  I think that it's mostly
due to the fact that it was almost 6pm when I left it there, and few people
probably came by after that.  I would like to think that it was still there
because of the high integrity of the people in the D.C. area, but
unfortunately, I don't think that was the case.  I'm just glad to get it back
:)

7/4/95 - Andy and I got on the Metro and headed for the mall in D.C. to watch
fireworks in the evening  The mall is the big open grassy area between the
Washington Monument and the Capital building that is like a big park.  There
were thousands of people there, and it was real interesting, but we decided
that because it was threatening to rain (and actually did start a few times)
that we didn't want to get caught in a massive dash for the Metro in the
event of rain, with everyone wanting to get back home if they were to cancel
the fireworks.  As it turns out, Andy wasn't all the thrilled about seeing
the fireworks anyway, so that's how we ended up backing out.  Anyway, on the
way down to D.C., we stopped in the White Flint mall and I jotted down the
address on a little tobacco shop in the mall there.  It's just a small
Tinderbox, and nothing of note happened there, but here it is:

The Tinderbox
White Flint Mall
Kensignton, MD  20895

Another shop was also listed:
Laurel Center
Laurel, MD  20707
(3010 776-5675

Later we went to Chinatown in D.C. and then headed back home.  Independence
Day for me this year was pretty uneventful, here in the nations capital.
 Ironic, I guess.

7/5/95 - Well, the plan is for me to get on the road again tomorrow, but I'm
not sure if I'll make it.  Several things have come up, not the least of
which is my pondering of my maybe meeting the old Capt. from OCS.  Another is
that one of the guys here where I'm staying (who are from Poland), had gone
up to Philadelphia yesterday and brought back the 13-year-old son of a friend
down to catch a plane out D.C. here back to Poland.  His name is Luke, but in
Polish it's pronounced "OO-kosh" (sort of like Lucas).  Wow, what a neat kid.
 He speaks very good English, considering that he said he had only a little
English in school, and he's been here in the U.S. for only 11 months.  He's
very personable, fun to be around.  He's doing a good job of hiding the fact
that he's really pretty sad about leaving his new friends and family in
Philadelphia.  He's looking forward to coming back again in 2 years.  He
taught me quite a bit of Polish.  Although I really enjoy learning a foreign
language, I'm afraid that after he leaves, and I leave here (where Jacek and
Christopher speak Polish), I won't get much chance to ever use it again.  Oh
well.  It's in the ol' database just in case.

I just read the latest pipes digest and saw the great writeup about the Duke
tobacco experience.  I wish I'd had known about it sooner.  I'm definitely
going to put it on my list of things to see next time I'm on this side of the
country.  My time is about up on this trip, I'm afraid.  I've got to start
heading back, soon.

I'm going to get this on the wire and hopefully I'll find some way along the
route back to check in again, but I'm afraid that this might be my last
writing until I get back home somewhere around the 17th.  I don't have many
contacts across the north part of the U.S. until I hit Montana.  I do have
one possible stop in Chicago that I have to try to arrange, and another
possibly in Flint, Michigan.  It sounds like a couple of neat pipe
collections to see in those places, if I can link up with the PD people in
those areas.  It's just not real easy to make arrangements with people when
you're on the road already.  I guess there's something to be said for hard
and fast plans.  All in all, it's been great being spontaneous.  Sorry if
there are errors in this.  Later!

Hi fellow pipefolk,

I finally decided to make public the web page I've been slowly putting 
together.  Mainly, it consists of my comments about different tobacco 
blends I've tried.  It started as a list that I was compiling for myself 
to help this absent-minded pipe smoker remember what he has smoked.  Then 
I figured it might as well go on-line as it may be of some use to 
someone.  It is indeed difficult to write about tobacco with any degree 
of accuracy without the necessary vocabulary, the use of which 
sometimes comes off as rather prissy anyway.  The URL is 
<a href="http://www.cam.org/~ghislai/pipes.">http://www.cam.org/~ghislai/pipes.</a>

I'm sitting here smoking a big bowl of Rattray's Accountant's blend in a 
Genod pipe with a curved shank and bore (apparently Genod is one of the 
few pipemakers who make curved bores), thinking how well this tobacco 
seems to go in this pipe.  I'm also still thinking about an event this past 
weekend.

I invited a friend of mine to come along with me to Blatter and Blatter's
as I needed some pipe cleaners and had an urge to smoke some of their
Blatter Reserve blend (a sweet, Virgiia, Turkish, latakia and perique
blend), which I hadn't had for a few months.  My friend doesn't smoke, but
always admires my pipes, which are for the most part nothing special, and
he's always got his nose in my tobacco pouches.  He and I picked out a
small but interesting ButzChoquin quarter-bent apple with an erratic hand-
carved surface as the best item in a reduced bin.  Although I had no
intention of buying a pipe (or do I always have the latent intention of
buying a pipe :) ), this one seemed interesting enough, so I adopted it. 
Well, the atmosphere of the shop got to him and before we left on the way
home, he announced that he wanted to smoke a pipe.  Upon arriving home, a
whole 10-minute walk, he proceeded to do just that and initiated my new
pipe with Blatter Reserve.  He always liked the aroma of the heavy English
blends I smoke, so it was only fitting that he try one.  In a way, this
will always be his pipe.  If he decides to continue to smoke a pipe, which
wouldn't surprise me given his enjoyment of the experience, I guess I'll
just let him have his first pipe as a souvenir. 

Well, it's time to try to get some sleep on this hot and sticky
unair-conditioned night so I can be functional tomorrow at the office...

Dear Steve,

I am a cigar smoker that is conducting market research on the viability of
another on-line cigar store. I have been sending a survey to AOL members to
get their reaction to using such a tobacconist. Overall the response is good
but just not quite enough people to justify the costs yet. 

Would you consider sending or making available this survey to your cigar
smoking members in order that I can get a little better idea of the overall
demand for such a service? In addition, I was going to subscribe to your
mailing list, but did not want to seem rude by subscribing and then
unsubscribing if there is not much info about cigars. Is there a way I can
get a sample of what a subscriber would get before I actually request a
subscription?

Thank You,
Steven

	Well, it took me more than a while to get out to the old local smoke
shop, but, when i did, they had the plastic humidors there.
	I looked at them a bit more closely, and they look like a good
deal, with a clay humidifier unit, Humistor IV.  The seal on them is
pretty decent, and when I asked the woman who was working how good of
a job they did keeping things up to snuff, she said that they worked
as well as the wooden numbers, and a shade better than rubbermaid or
tupperware.
	The only problem is that she can't remember where they got them, and
they have lost the paperwork on the order, so they don't know where to get
anymore.  They did have a fair number of them sitting there, maybe a dozen.
	To get one, call
	The Tobacco Bar Ltd.

Greetings, Steve.  What a wonderful service you're providing!  
I'm a newbie to Compuserve and the Net, but not to pipe smoking 
and collecting.  I've heard about you and what you're doing for 
some time, and am just delighted to benefit from it.

A little about me, as requested...I'm 44, live in Gadsden, Alabama
and began smoking pipes at the tender age of 15.  I've been a fairly
serious collector for the past decade, and since 1987 have attended
2 to 4 pipe shows per year.  (I plan to be in Indy, by the way.)  With 
respect to my pipe interests, I developed a brand-name collection of
Frey pipes, and a motif collection of pipes carved in a "drip wax" style.
In order to make a needed addition to the house, I sold 'em all, which
paid for the work.  Now, I'm into Dunhill Cumberland billiards (used ones)
and Castellos in shape number 84, or "hawkbills".  Thanks to the help of 
Ben Rapaport over the years, I also collect books, periodicals and related
literature about  our avocation. 

Needless to say, I want to get all the back issues of Pipe Digest I can;
should I download them?  Also, how can I make a financial contribution
to further this most worthy cause?

Many thanks, and best regards.

P.S.  Please point out any errors/ommissions/goof-ups I make as I attempt
to learn the proper way to communicate in this new-for-me arena.

<a name="20">Subject: Pipes Digest</a>

Dear Steve

Thanks for the Pipes Digest mailings, I enjoy reading them, and 
a.s.p. very much, perhaps too much.  I have a problem; to quote from 
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Red-Headed League: "It is quite a 
three-pipe problem."  I'll explain.

I started smoking pipes when I was about 16.  My father and my elder 
brother both smoked pipes and I remember them giving me a new pipe 
and a tin of "Four Square Green" for my sixteenth birthday.  So I 
smoked away happily for many years (not quite continuously!).  I 
didn't collect pipes as such but accumulated a few nice Petersons, a 
beautiful Ben Wade straight-grain "chimney" and a calabash as well as 
lots of other odds and ends.  I smoked mostly English tobaccos such 
as Ogden's St Bruno Flake or Gold Block, Players Whiskey Flake or 
Navy Cut and the occasional treat of Balkan Sobranie or Escudo.

In my early thirties I got bitten by the fitness bug, gave up smoking 
and threw away all my pipes.  I never really got over the tobacco 
habit and enjoyed a cigar or cheroot from time to time.  During this 
period of restraint I lived in the United States for 3 years (I was 
in the Royal Air Force and had an exchange duty with the USMC at MCAS 
Yuma Az) so I missed the chance of visiting all the pipe shops I am 
now reading about in PD and a.s.p. when I was in San Diego, LA, 
Denver, Boston, Washington DC, Sacramento, Reno and so on.  However, 
I did enjoy the occasional pinch of snuff (Copenhagen) with my USMC friends!

A couple of months ago, following a brief affair with hand-rolling 
cigarettes, I decided to try a pipe again after a break of over 12 
years.  I have now retired from the RAF and live in the Shetland 
Islands (pop 22500), a near perfect place to live and bring up a 
family.  Only one problem - no pipe shops!  A general store in 
Lerwick (pop 7000 and the "capital" of Shetland) sells a few cheap 
mass-produced pipes and has a small selection of pipe tobaccos. When 
I went there to buy a pipe they had two Petersons, one which I now 
own, the other since bought by probably the only other pipe-smoker in 
Shetland!  The manager tells me they are unlikely to stock any more 
as there is so little demand these days.  I sometimes (about 3 times 
a year) get a trip South to Scotland (usually Aberdeen or Edinburgh, 
neither of which is renowned for their selection of pipe shops) and 
I'm not aware of any pipe shops in the UK who do mail-order.  I clean 
my Peterson meticulously each night and leave it to dry out on the 
top of the Rayburn (a peat-burning stove) but think it could probably 
do with a longer rest from time to time!

So here I am, enjoying my one and only pipe filled with Balkan 
Sobranie, reading, and beginning to fantasize, about all those 
wonderful pipe stores in the US.  This-morning I was reading a 
posting about a store called Edwards in Richardson from Gary 
Stefancik (in a.s.p. under "Dallas or FT Worth") when it occurred to 
me that some of your readers might be able to help me in my plight.

All I ask is that if someone has a favourite pipe store which 
produces a mailer or catalogue, would they please give them my 
address and ask them to send me one.

Thanks.

Smoke, and live, in peace.

Brian

Hallo Steve! Had some trouble with new software-made the setup some days before
and i'm not well-trained in using email. Beg Your(s) pardon.

Here is an email from Germany, Osnabrueck (in the north-west, near the now 
european frontier to the Netherlands). 
Hallo to U.S.A. (and other nations) 
I did read your mail and it made me interested because I'm a smoker and I'll 
write my diploma in a kind of social-history about 
smoking rsp. luxury (goods). Arnold Schmieder (1995), a well known researcher 
here in Germany nominates the social-historic arguments, that the standards of 
idle (in a kind of contemplation) and concentration could be measured by the 
art of tobacco-consume and the ruling smoke appliance; the luxury tobacco 
would be a measurement variable of the society status.  
Remember that smoking pipe or cigar needs restfulness and smoke only touches 
the mouth and not the lungs (normally). But by smoking cigarettes one does it 
during our jobs, in short intervals and in less time to get the effects. 
	Schmieder (1995) means that non-smokers search the staying away of 
smoke- enjoyment in asceticism. But they will not find the way back to the 
laid-back-lifestyle of the pre-industrial society either. 

In literature (SCHIVELBUSCH, WOLFGANG: Die trockene Trunkenheit des
Tabaks; in: Voelger, Gisela (ed): Rausch und Realitaet, Drogen im
Kulturvergleich) 1982, vol.1-3, S. 386 ff, v. 1; ISBN:3499340062)
tobacco and coffee would be incoherent in their modes of action. But
they modify; the aim would be a readjustment of the human organism
under the privilege of mental work.  The brain would be the part of
the human body, which is in the most interest of the new developing
civilian culture - and this is what tobacco supports.  I'll stop it
here. My question to all readers is, who knows literature about
COMPARATIVE LUXURY RESEARCH (less the pharmacological way, more the
historic, social kind). These research-object asks why human beings
are using luxury.  If you know something about institutes, literature
or same research-objects, please answer by email. If you're interested
to read more about it - let it know to me.  I myself have the
possibility to loan an old manual about tobacco trading (and
producing). It has been edited in 1939-1944 and gives a lot of
informations (history, trading, pipes, sorts) but I must remember for
somebody who will get some infos out of it: First that this book is
influenced by the german ideology of Nazis (1933-1945) and that it is
not my opinion and second I need time to scan it. The origin title is:
Handbuch des Tabakhandels, ASCHENBRENNER, H. and STAHL,GUENTHER;
copyright by Richard Gahl, Berlin,1939, fourth edition,1944, 600
sides- the literature-sources are not directly nominated.

From: ????????@???.??? (Ed Berggren)

Hello, Steve,

  I thought that I would, as a means of delaying the start on my weekend
chores, respond to several questions posed in PD #194.

Barry (???????@???.???) asked two questions:

1)  Do I remember Holmes being an opium smoker?  I know very little about
the use of this drug--Isn't it smoked in a pipe?  Could the clay pipe have
been an opium pipe?

  No, Sherlock Holmes was not an opium smoker--he used cocaine, a 7 percent
solution injected with a hypodermic syringe (see 'The Sign of the Four'
which also provides the only reference in the canon to Holmes also using
morphine on occasion).  It must be remembered that, although shocking to us
today, back in those days cocaine was available over-the-counter.  It was
the ingredient that made Lydia Pinkham's Medicinal Compound so popular, and
it was an ingredient in the original Coca-Cola formula (hence the "Coca").

  Opium was (and, I assume, still is) smoked in pipes, but these tended to
be long-stemmed affairs with metal bowls, not clay.  Holmes did spend time
in opium dens, but only when he was on a case--he was not there to indulge
(see 'The Man With the Twisted Lip').

2)  I have read several things about cherry-wood pipes--What is the real
word on them?  Do they smoke well?  Where can I get a good one to try out?

  Cherry-wood is a soft wood along with rosewood hickory, and sometimes
corncobs are placed in this category.  Because they are a softwood, they
tend to burn out more quickly than briar.  Also, it has a tendency to split
from the heat of burning tobacco and cake buildup.  For this reason, many
cherry-wood pipes are made with the bark left on them to help prevent
splitting.  They don't season as well as briar, but they do produce a nice
woody-tasting smoke.  They tend to be relatively inexpensive, so, like
corncobs, are a nice alternative when going places or doing things to which
you don't want to subject a more expensive briar.  I've seen (and bought a
couple over the years) cherry-wood pipes at tobacconists, and I know that
Thompson's Cigar Co. sells a set of 3 (in this case without the bark) for
$10.95.

  ??????@???.??? asked about the new Arturo Fuente Opus X cigars.  The
Summer '95 _Cigar Afficionado_ had an interview with Carlos Fuente Sr. in
which the Opus X was discussed.  Here's a couple of excerpts:

  "Three years ago, the Fuentes also attacked one of the long-standing
myths about the Dominican Republic:  You can't grow shade wrapper there.
Today, the family has three vintages of shade-grown wrapper in its
inventory, and, Opus X, the new cigar that carries the wrapper, will hit
the market this summer."

  "I think it will probably be over $10 for the big cigars...Maybe as high
as $12....We plan to come out with six or seven sizes."

  Hmmm...$12 for one cigar.  I can buy 4 to 6 ounces of pipe tobacco for
$12, enough to keep me going for weeks.

  Well, enough for now.  Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

i have been smoking premium cigars since i was 15, long before a certain 
magazine brought us smokers out of the closet.  I am now about to 
graduate from a university and would like ot know if you have any 
information about breaking into the cigar industry. I would love to 
develop my passion for cigars into a career, so any information you have 
would be greatly appreciated. thanks.

[ Good luck, Christian! Please let us know what develops. -S. ]

[WINCHELLISM] That fun guy at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
David "Loose Cannon" Kessler, continues his bid to overstep his
authority and anschluss the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
The latest maneuver: a report recommending that nicotine be classified
as something that the FDA can control.  The excuse this time:
children, as usual.  Masticola's Maxim of Prepubescent Pugilism: When
someone uses kids to grind a political axe, expect a hit below the belt.

Kessler's move comes despite the fact that the FDA didn't _want_
jurisdiction in the early 1980s, and sued to keep from getting it...
Newt Gingrich counterattacked immediately, saying that the report "had
nothing to do with children and everything to do with control," and
that it was an affront to Americans' right to self-determination and
individual responsibility.  Keep Kessler in mind at election time.
And for those outside the U.S., watch for sleazy moves like this in
your legislatures.

[OPEN DISCUSSION] This issue, I'll throw out a question for
discussion: What's the _worst_ smoke you've ever had, be it cigar or
pipe?  A cigar that's constructed like a Packard-Bell PC, draws like a
stick of ailanthus wood, burns (or, rather, tunnels) to a black ash,
and tastes like someone just tarred the roof?  Or a pipe tobacco that
has a spice note like a rendering plant, that gunks up your pipe so
bad that you need Drano to clean it, and that scorches your _dog's_
mouth when you smoke it?  Something that you'd think about smoking at
a party that will be attended by both Kessler and Waxman. &gt;:-] Thought
it'd be fun to find out peoples' pet peeves!

But for now, please light up something a little easier to take than
Retribution Mixture or the prancing Puritans of prohibition, and join
us for another issue, featuring an Ohio Pipe Collectors' show
announcement, a comprehensive guide to Castello collecting from Bob
Hamlin of the PCCA, and a feature from Ray Bromley on evacuation
procedures...

Howdy all,
        After a few digests, I've decided to come out of the wood work
with a few interesting requests. I grow and smoke my own Tobacco, usually
in ceremony with some Navajo friends. Is anyone out there growing and
making there own blends? I've also decided to carve a pipe from some
applewood I was given. This year, I might also grow a gourd and make a
bong out of that. Has anyone done this before too.
        On a second note, does anyone have seeds for Coyote Tobacco? If
so, could they send me some. Thanks again.

Hi, there;

I smoke a pipe, and a friend is visiting me who smokes cigars. We
were driving down a street not far from my house, talking smokes, 
when we passed a place called the Bombay Cigar Society, which I'd 
never noticed before. And in looking at your Resources page, I 
found it listed. It must be karma- my friend and I will have to 
check it out.

I noticed on your resource page that you had the phone number, but
just question marks for the area code. FYI, the area code is 310.
And if you want it, the Redondo Beach zip code is 90277.

I just found the on-line smoke stuff today, as I hadn't thought to
look until my friend told me about them yesterday. Thanks for
all the work in putting it together- it looks great.

Best Regards-
	Don Merritt

Hi Steve, and all you puffers out there.
Looks like I missed being part of PD history by not being home when Charlie
Jewell came to visit me. I was late in reading his email to me, saying he'd
be here (Lansing MI) the evening of 7July95. I'm a blues saxman, and had a
gig that night out of town. No evidence he was actually here, but I expect he
came &amp; went while I was gone. Shucks, I had plans of going with him to Paul
Spaniola's famous July anniversary sale in Flint. Guess I'll have to go alone
next week.
I hope Charlie went without me; I had told him about the sale.
Unlike last summer, I haven't yet switched to cigar mode, even though the
porch swing is as inviting as ever. I'm still enjoying my pipe the few times
I smoke these hot summer days; seems I don't crave tobacco so much in warm
weather.
I recently scored a half-dozen old Custombilt pipes at a garage sale ($1.00
each). Three of them were without stems, and I'm waiting for their return
from repair even now. The others had thick cakes of carbon; you could barely
stick a pencil inside the bowl. I reamed them down and they smoke
beautifully.
Gotta go off to rehearsal.
My best to all puffers.  --Dennis

Steve, add this to your long list of tobac shoppes...

Edleez Tobacco West / 4 West Main Street / Fredonia, NY / 14063 / 
716-672-4470

Edleez has an extremely large walk-in humidor (size of a one car garage) 
and has some interesting pipes (including Yello Bole, Falcon and 
Denicotea) and about three dozen pipe tobacs in bulk. It's the ONLY tobac 
shoppe in the Western New York area. (I call it The Oasis) :)

They also have a large selection of lighters and the owner is a collector 
of match boxes and booklets.

Enough for now. "Gimme a good blend and I'll be a Happy Tamper"

Steve:

Noticed the inquiry on carnuba wax in #195. A product called 
Briwax (made in England "by appointment to H.M. the Queen") 
is available in the US through Tri-State Briwax. Call 
800-597-5008. It sells x$7.50 for 400 grams.  It is mostly 
carnuba. Great for pipes,furniture and shoes.

The best way to use it on pipes is to spread a THIN coat on 
the pipe and let it dry for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Buff on 
a wheel lightly using a buffer devoted only to this wax.

Tri-State takes Discover cards and is making application for 
VISA/MC.

Best,
Craig

<a name="10">Subject: Savinelli, Early Morning Pipe and prices</a>

"Terveisia Suomesta", which means "greetings from Finland"

We presently have a nice warm summer here. The sun is shining 20 hours day 
and night. I am beginning to prepare this year's trip to the Lapland, where 
I'm going to wander and fish for three weeks overnighting in a tent and 
frying trout and grayling over camp fire. This time I'm not going to forget 
my tobaccos home. Perhaps some of you will remember my sad story "A pipe 
smoker's agony in the wilderness" last year.

I have bought a new Savinelli (this time not with the 9 mm hole and balsa 
filter). It is a slightly bent medium sized model with beautiful grain, 
partly bird's eye, partly straight grain. (But nobody is perfect.) The price 
was approximately 100$:s here in Finland, so the pipe is not of the best 
Savinelli class, but it's all right with me.

 I have begun to smoke Dunhill's "Early Morning Pipe". I must say that I 
like it. It's not so strong as "965" and even my wife likes the aroma (or 
more truthfully, doesn't dislike it). I started to smoke the new Savinelli 
with it and I think that I'll reserve the it exclusively for Early Morning 
Pipe. I have smoked lately mainly "Amphora Regular" in my pipes and because 
the mixture is not flavoured the pipes are quite neutral for this new 
mixture, I think. BTW, here in Finland I have to pay nearly 10$:s for a 50 
grams tin. Could somebody tell me what is the price in the USA?

I'm eagerly waiting for mr. Timo Kuusela's introduction of himself in the 
list as I found that a fellow Finn has joined in the Pipe Digest.:-)  As a 
matter of fact we have been e-mailing and I know that he is a true pipe 
smoker and surely is welcomed to join us.

So, soon I'm hiking again in the wilderness and will be back in the 
civilization on August 11th. Wish me tight lines!

[ I think the Amphora would be about $2 or so for a 50-gram pouch
here; we seldom see it in tins in that size. Congratulations on the
new Savinelli! -S. ]

<a name="11">Subject: Clay Pipes</a>

Steve,
     This is my first post, even though I've been reading the group for 
about six months.  I am a 31 year old unemployed sales representative 
(any prospective employers?) from the Pittsburgh area.  I've been 
smoking pipes for about five years.  I am surprised at the number of 
young pipe smokers.  When I started I felt self-conscious about what 
people thought of a 26 year old smoking a pipe.  People would look at 
me with a puzzled look on their face as if they were wondering what I 
was smoking.  I'm sure they thought what else would a young man be 
smoking in a pipe but something illegal.  Has anyone else had these 
thoughts or experiences?  
     Among my small collection of pipes are two made of clay.  There is 
not much mentioned about people smoking clay pipes.  Is there a reason 
for this?  I enjoy mine tremendously.  Are they manufactured as a 
novelty item or are there different levels of quality?  Does anyone 
know of a mail order company where I can buy clay pipes?
     Thanks for doing a great job with the Pipes Digest.  Keep up the 
good work.
                                    Take care,
                                        Ken

<a name="12">Subject: The fate of the small tobacco shop...</a>

Steve,
   
I normally prefer only to relate pleasant experiences, but I thought
this sad tale held a lesson that should be shared.
   
A couple of weeks ago I had the opportunity to visit the tobacco shop
from which I purchased my first "nice" pipe 14 years ago.  I anxiously
anticipated the trip, but I was sorely disappointed.
   
This shop *was* a quaint little place located downtown (I'll not mention
the city).  The shop had a huge glass case running the length of the
store filled to overflowing with beautiful pipes of every description.
The ceiling-high shelves behind the counter were jammed with jars and 
tins of every tobacco imaginable.  The tobacconist on duty was a kind, 
older man who patiently assisted a young, financially impaired college 
student in making his purchase.
   
First, I discovered the shop had moved to a local mall.  When I walked
into the shop I found the pipes were confined to a very small display
case.  While there were a half-dozen or so quality pipes, the rest were
--to be kind--mediocre.  The shop had no tinned tobaccos at all and only
eight or ten uninspiring bulk blends.  I had intended to buy a pipe to
commemorate this visit, but the only pipe that even came close to striking
my fancy was ridiculously overpriced.  Finding nothing else to purchase, 
I decided to at least pick up some pipe cleaners...but they were out of 
stock!  Downcast, I purchased a couple of packs of cigarettes (which I
gave away).  I have the sad feeling that this poor shop is doomed.
      
The moral to this story:  support your local tobacconist!  I'm not
saying that you should purchase a pipe each and every time you walk into
a shop, but buy *something*.  If nothing else, pick up a tin of tobacco
or a pipe tool (you're going to need it when you lose the one in your
pocket anyway &lt;g&gt;); buy something you don't like and give it to a
friend; buy something you hate and give it to an enemy.  I'll continue
to do most of my buying by mail (for, you see, I don't have a local
tobacconist), but I'll make it a point to support the "little guy"
whenever I am able.

Steve, 

Just a quick word of thanks, I have been quietly enjoying PD for several 
months now. It has been my introduction to the net and now that I have 
had a chance to browse around other areas, I must say I picked a great 
place to start!

Let me introduce myself, I live and work in Calgary, Alberta, Canada,
where, unfortunately, our smoking policies are taking on a freighteningly
similar tone to those of many other North American Cities. I smoke a bent
bulldog made by "Peterson's Kinsale" of Ireland. I smoke a locally blended
dark cavendish and have been smoking since I was about 20 years old or 12
years. I would enjoy hearing from other Canadian pipe smokers 
(or any variety of pipe smokers) especially if they have information about 
good tobacco stores in Western Canada. 

Also, could you please send me an updated Resourse Guide.

Thanks and regards, Jeff Lamb

[ Guide sent, I believe! -S. ]

Steve, I'd like to give you and the Digest readers an update on the OPC
swap/sell show scheduled for Sept. 23 in Columbus.  Club membership now
stands at 53, and we have rented 21 tables for the show, with promises from
Jack Ehrmantraut and Nikos Levin that they will be attending with vast
numbers of estate pipes.  Most of the tables will be featuring estate
pipes, but new pipes, tobaccos, lighters and miscellaneous items will also
be displayed for sale.
 
Anyone planning to come in early should call the Inn on the Lane
(614-294-4848) for the special room rate.  We will be gettng together in
the Inn's lounge Friday evening (8:00--?) for fellowship, bragging,
dealing, whatever.  Anyone wishing show flyers or a complimentary
newsletter copy (we want to recruit more members), please write me.  Also,
I'll be set up at the Indiana Briar Friars show on July 29 with my estate
pipes and information about the show.
 
We have had a tremendous outpouring of support in the form of merchadise
donated.  Three items will be designated later for prizes in our
pipe-smoking contest.  The rest will go to our raffle: 50 cents a ticket
plus a free ticket for every pipe purchased at the show.  More items have
been promised, but here is what I have actually received so far from
donors.  There's some great stuff here.
 
PIPES: S&amp;R Coral Rock--S&amp;R Pipes and Pleasures; Steve Weiner-- Steve
Weiner; Don Carlos 3 Note--Barclay Pipe and Tobacco; two GBD Prehistoric
estates--Smoker's Haven Downtown and Convention Center; Stanwell 1994 Pipe

PCCA's Castello Grade &amp; Style Guide   
by Robert C. Hamlin (c) 1988, 1992, 1994 
 
This article was first printed in the July 1988 Smoker's Pipeline. 
PCCA revised and printed this article again in the January, 1990 
Smoker's Pipeline. Due to the many request that we have had to 
reprint this Castello guide again, we have once again updated our 
data to print our Castello Pipe Guide again in this issue. 
 
Our reference for this article comes from several sources; #1: 
Several trips to Cantu' Italy to visit the Castello pipe making 
operation including interviews with Carlo Scotti and Franco Coppo. 
#2: The personal selection of 3,000 to 4,000 Castello pipes that 
we have stocked in the last 10+ years, plus the thousands of 
others that we have seen, but not purchased (and) #3: A shape 
guide from Richard Esserman outlining some of the lesser known 
shapes produced by Castello.  
 
The Castello brand is probably the most revered and collected 
Italian pipe line on today's pipe smoking scene. Very little was 
ever produced either by the Castello factory, or by their USA 
importer, to show collectors what the nomenclature means on the 
actual pieces, or how they are graded. We have handled many 
thousand Castello pipes during the last 7 years and have viewed 
many more. Simply stated, the stocking of many thousand Castello 
pipes has helped in putting together this guide, but the 
possibilities constantly change.  This article will give you a 
complete look at today's Castello pipe shapes, grades and 
variations. We hope that you find it useful.    
 
******************* 
 
Castello pipes are made in Cantu' Italy by the firm first started 
by Carlo Scotti in 1947. The first Castello pipes were styled 
after English styles, especially those produced by Dunhill.  The 
early Castello pieces were small, mostly carved or sandblasted 
finishes and stamped with "Mi Reserva" (My reserve).  The 
"reserve" nomenclature was only used for the first couple of years 
of production (1947-1949 or '50) and was soon followed with the 
addition of a "Reg." number. We don't know exactly what the 
registry number signifies, although I believe that it is the 
number assigned to the Castello tradename, in Italy. Shapes and 
styles, as far as we can tell, are not patented or registered in 
Italy, so more than likely the "Reg." number that appears on the 
early Castello pipes just refer to the trademark (registered 
Castello).  
 
In the early years of Caminetto production (1968 - '71/72) the 
pipes produced also carried a"Reg." number.  This "Caminetto" fact 
would also support the tradename theory. The registry number is 
still occasionally used on special (usually long shanked pieces in 
carved or sandblasted finishes) pipes, today. It is possible that 
these are older pipes that have not been released or it is 
possible that this stamp is occasionally used "just" to create 
excitement.  What is true though is that there are very, very few 
Castello pipes that are new and unsmoked that carry a registry 
number. 
As with any new company and true in the early years of Castello 
pipes, Scotti struggled with his new company in trying to make a 
name for himself and his new line.  In the early 1950's ('50-'52), 
Scotti came very close to giving up and closing the doors of his 
Castello pipe making operation.  What saved the Castello line was 
a chance meeting between Scotti and Wally Frank of New York.   
 
Mr. Frank was in Italy on a buying trip and became interested in 
the Castello pipes that he found (by chance). After meeting with 
Scotti, Mr. Frank agreed to import this new line to America and 
Castello has never looked back.  
 
In the early year of this joint venture, Mr. Frank tried to 
convince Scotti to move to America and produce his pipes in the 
States. Scotti refused to leave Italy which caused some tension in 
this new partnership, but not enough to end the relationship 
between Frank and Scotti. I am sure that had Scotti come to 
America that the Castello pipe would not have become the world 
class product that it is today. However, the problems of the 
working relationship between Scotti and Frank in these early 
years, before facsimile transmissions, quick transatlantic flights 
and express carriers never allowed the American market to see the 
best of Scotti's talent. The Castello pipe has continued to grow 
in number, quality and prestige until present day where the 
Castello pipes of Carlo Scotti are considered the best in Italy, 
and by some as the best in the world.   
 
The mystery of the early years of Castello pipe production have 
all but been lost in time. Very little is known about production 
figures, shapes, finishes and the nomenclature of the first 20 to 
25 years of Castello production. The beginning, from 1947 to 
1950-52, are recalled and the last 20+ years are traceable due to 
Franco Coppo, who went to work for Castello in 1969. From the 
early 1950's until the late 1960's very little is known. One of 
the reasons that little is known in the USA about Castello 
production, during this time frame, is the fact that USA 
distribution was extremely limited with almost all of the Castello 
pipes imported being the lower graded Carved Sea Rock and 
sandblasted Old Antiquari finishes. I located my first smooth 
Castello pipe in 1974 when the manufacturer's salesman talked me 
into buying this "very rare top grade Castello". I paid $40 or $50 
for this smooth natural colored classic Bulldog with a black 
ferrule and stick bit. Older Castello pipes will usually include 
the "REG No." and have the letters "SC" stamped as a part of the 
nomenclature. The SC stamp was for Scotti, Carlo (in Italy all 
names are listed last, first). Today the full name of Carlo 
Scotti, contained in a small oval, has replaced the SC stamp. 
 
Today the Castello operation is run by Carlo Scotti's Son-in-Law, 
Franco Coppo and his daughter Savina. Scotti still over sees his 
company and his influence is still evident, but he is no longer 
involved with the day to day operation of the factory/workshop. 
&lt;MI&gt;See footnote on Carlo Scotti&lt;D&gt; In 1984-85, when Franco took 
over the running of the Castello operation there was a small 
change made to the appearance of the nomenclature. Under the rein 
of Scotti, pipes were graded  and marked with one or more "K's", 
these were about the size of this text, "open" and stamped in a 
line. The new stamping continues to use the "K's", however the are 
now very small and enclosed in a circle or oval. &lt;R&gt;&lt;MI&gt;Now let's 
look at the specifics of Castello grading, finishes and shapes.    
&lt;D&gt; 
 
This guide will relate current standards for pipes produced in the 
1980's &amp;  1990's and will be accurate for most any Castello pipe 
that you will see on today's market.  We will not list the 
variations and "set standards" for the 1950's, 1960's or 1970's as 
not only is this just about impossible to document, but it has 
very little bearing on the Castello pipes that you are likely to 
run across today. We will also point out known exceptions to the 
rule and tell you how the American Logo'd Castello pipes vary from 
the Italian "standard"  models. We will stop and give details when 
we feel that it is necessary although you should keep in mind that 
it is impossible to list all of the variations that occur with 
Castello pipes. Another thing that must be kept in mind is that 
the Castello factory does not, and will not, produce a set and 
standard shape chart.  Since Castello pipes are all hand made and 
vary considerably, they do not feel that a "standard" shape guide 
could be accurate.    
 
In the late 1980's there were about 8,000 Castello pipes produced 
each year including all finishes and styles. Approximately 4,000 
(50%) pieces are distributed over the smooth finishes (Trademark, 
"castello", Perla Nera and Collection), 800  (10%) are sandblasted 
(Old Antiquari) and 3,200 (40%) are carved finished (Sea Rock, Old 
Sea Rock, Natural Vergin and Epoca). Today, Castello production 
figures are probably closer to 6,000 pipes, although the 
percentage breakdown of finishes will still be accurate. These 
figures, along with the total production, will vary each year 
depending on the quality of briar and demand to some extent.    
 
Note: The Castello mouthpiece logo consists of a white oval 
elongated bar. The "white bar" is used on all of the Castello 
pipes produced for the Italian market and export market 
&lt;MI&gt;except&lt;D&gt; for those that are sent to the United States through 
Hollco International (Wally Frank).  
All Castello pipes use handmade lucite (plexiglas, acrylic) 
mouthpieces. In the early years the white bar logo was inlaid 
ivory, however today the white bar is simulated. Castello stems 
are produced by cutting solid sheet lucite into 1 inch square 
strips. These strips are then cut into shorter square 
(rectangular) blocks and hand drilled, hand filed and formed into 
custom matched Castello stems. Almost all Castello stems are 
black, although green, deep red, brown/bronze, pearlized ivory and 
solid white Castello mouthpieces have been used. 
 
American logo'd Castello pipes use a small round "Diamond" 
(referred to and looking like, but it is NOT actually a diamond) 
inlaid into the mouthpiece.  This was originally done so that the 
standard Castello white bar logo did not conflict with another 
brand and logo that was sold by Wally Frank called the "White Bar 
Pipe" (in the 1950's).     
 
Many Castello collectors prefer the white bar logo and a few 
prefer the "diamond", however there is no real difference between 
the two once you compare like pieces. In a few cases there are 
differences in finishes or grading; we will point these out when 
they apply.    
 
SEA ROCK [Carved Black or dark brown]:  This is the lowest grade 
of the  Castello line and is the most common in the USA.  Sea 
Rocks are produced by taking a smooth bowl that has not been 
"final finished" and surface carving the finish with tools. This 
"carved" finish is then evened out using a steel wire brush, 
stained and then waxed. The Natural Vergin carved finish is left 
unstained and unwaxed as a rule, although we have seen waxed  and 
partially waxed"Vergins".  
 
All carved Castello pipes  are graded by the number of K's that 
are stamped on each piece and are K-graded by SIZE.  1K is the 
smallest and fairly rare, 2K is small to medium, with  3K or 4K 
being the most common and ranges from medium to medium large. 
Large pieces are stamped "G" for giant and extra large pieces are 
stamped "GG" for double giant.  In addition to the number of K's 
on a carved Sea Rock piece the shape number is almost always 
added.  As a rule a Sea Rock Castello is stained Black, although 
recently there have been quite a few coming in stained deep brown 
and still stamped "Sea Rock".  American Logo'd Sea Rocks are all 
priced the same to the consumer, although most are 2 or 3 K'ed 
models.  G/GG models are charged at a higher price on American 
pieces and are basically the same as their European counterparts. 
 
OLD SEA ROCK [Carved Brown, sometimes with a darker, stained 
"fumed top"]: This line is graded, styled and stamped exactly the 
same as the standard black Sea Rock, except that all Old Sea Rocks 
are stained brown.   
The Old Sea Rock stain color will vary from tan to medium dark 
brown. Occasionally, Old Sea Rocks will have a darker stained top 
rim.  All old Sea Rocks are priced the same, graded the same and 
numbered the same as the standard (black) Sea Rock.  
 
American Logo'd Old Sea Rocks are all priced the same (no matter 
how many  K's) to the consumer although most are 2 or 3 K'ed 
models.  G/GG models are  charged at a higher price on American 
pieces and are basically the same as their European counterparts.  
  
NATURAL VERGIN (Sea Rock) [Carved unstained, "Natural" color]: The 
Natural Vergin is basically "just" an unstained carved Sea Rock.  
They are graded, priced, sized and numbered the same as the Sea 
Rock and Old Sea  Rock, including the G/GG grades. A few of the 
Castello Natural Vergin stamped pipes will be finished with a 
light wax and any that have a smooth polished top rim will be 
waxed (on the rim), but most are completely  unfinished (waxed or 
otherwise) carved wood. Since this finish will show any defect in 
the wood, only  the best mono-colored pieces of briar are used for 
the Natural Vergin.  This comment is said with the assumption that 
if the  wood was grained well enough or had clean enough surfaces 
it would have been made into a smooth pipe and not carved in the 
first place.   
 
American Logo'd Natural Vergins are all priced the same to the 
consumer (no  matter how many K's are used) although most are 2 or 
3 K'ed models. There are a few natural colored pieces that come 
through stamped plain Sea Rock and are actually Natural Vergin's.  
G/GG models are charged at a higher  price on American pieces and 
are basically the same as their European counterparts.  
 
OLD ANTIQUARI [Sandblasted Light tan to medium rust colored 
brown]: Only 10% of the total Castello pipe production is produced 
in the sandblasted Old Antiquari series.  These can be either 
crosscut or straight grained pieces and are typically shallow to 
medium in sandblasting depth. These have, as a rule, been stained 
a medium brown or medium rust color although starting in the 
spring of 1987 we have started to see more and more arrive in a 
light colored tan or almost natural color and in 1989 we carried a 
few black sandblasted Old Antiquari pipes.  
 
As with the carved Sea Rock models, the Old Antiquari pipes are 
graded by size and marked by the number of K's.  The higher the 
number of K's the higher the price and larger the piece including 
the G &amp; GG size stamps. Old Antiquari pipes will include a shape 
number along with the K or G size grade.  
 
American Logo'd Old Antiquari Castellos are usually not true 
sandblasted  pieces, but more often than not actually Old Sea Rock 
carved pipes (usually  those with a fume or darker colored top 
rim). This carved finish is less expensive than the actual 
sandblasted (Italian) Old Antiquari and while they are priced 
higher than American Sea Rocks, they are not priced high enough 
above the carved finish to allow them to be sandblasted. All 
American logo'd Old Antiquari's are priced the same to the 
consumer although most are 2 or 3 K'ed models.  G/GG models are 
charged at a higher price on American pieces and while they are 
rarely seen, they too are usually carved pieces rather than true 
sandblasted pipes.  You will not  see carved (Sea Rock style) Old 
Antiquari pipes anywhere other than the States. 
 
Before we get to the Castello all smooth finishes we should take a 
few lines and explain some of the other things that you will 
probably run across with Castello nomenclature.  
 
#1: Silver and Gold bands are used with Castello pipes.  If these 
bands are  put on at the factory (and most are), they will usually 
include either the Castello name in script or more commonly, the 
Castello "castle" engraved on the band. The silver band is used on 
all finishes and gold is usually reserved for only smooth finishes 
(usually the higher graded pieces). Many times rather than just 
having a gold Castello band, the gold will be inlaid with hand 
painted lacquer (I have seen red, green and black). Occasionally 
you will see a Castello pipe come through with a silver "cup" or 
ferrule and a stick type bit. These silver cup (ferrule) pipes are 
not common and usually are reserved for only  the better or higher 
graded pieces. Silver cups are usually signed with "Castello" in 
script and not engraved with the castle. Diamond styled cups are  
rare. While it is possible to make a gold cupped piece, I have 
never seen one and do not believe that this has been done (yet).   
 
#2: All Castello standard shaped pipes have a number (3,4,5 or 6) 
stamped on the mouthpiece or sometimes on the lucite ferrule.  
What does this number mean? Not much really, it is the number of 
the size for the proper straw  tube or reed that fits the shank 
and stem of the pipe. These straw tubes are rarely used in the 
United States. The Castello reed is considered superfluous and 
useless to most, but with this number you will always know  which 
one fits (the different numbers have to do with length, not 
diameter).  
#3: Many Castello shapes are occasionally available with a briar 
or lucite ferrule (extension on the shank is called a "Floc" in 
Italian) and stick or  Army style bit. Many other pieces either in 
standard shapes or in freestyle  shapes include a briar extension 
inlaid into the mouthpiece (called intarsio in Italian).  Both of 
these extensions add to the style of the pipes and can be found on 
most shapes, although not on a regular basis.  If the extension  
is made from lucite there should be no additional charge, however 
if the extension is made of briar there will be an added charge by 
both the factory and on a retail level. 
 
#4: Castello has made several "Presentation" pieces that are 
either very unusual or extra large; these are stamped with a large 
"Castello" signature in script on the side of the shank (instead 
of their normal grade and nomenclature). Two other limited 
editions were recently made for the 40th anniversary of Castello 
pipes.   
 
For the Italian market there was a two piece set of Castello pipes 
(limited to 40 sets), one of the pieces was an original 1947 Mi 
Reserva (although not stamped) in a carved finish and the other 
was a 1987 Collection graded piece made to match the '47.  
 
The American market was also treated to a limited 40th year piece 
(a total of 50 were produced with 48 being distributed).  The 
American 40th year pipe was a full bent hand styled variation of 
the #93 or #293 shape (full bent egg) with a fancy mouthpiece, 
serial number (01/50 or 02/50, etc.) and a 1947/1987 stamp.  These 
were available in several finishes (I have seen Sea Rock, Old 
Antiquari, Trademark and Collection) and are limited to a total of 
50.  
 
#5: Standard shape numbers are only used on Sea Rocks (all 
colors), Old  Antiquari and Trademark lines.  On the non-smooth 
Castello lines the "K"  grading refers to the size (only) and with 
smooth pieces the K's refer to the grain quality.  If a piece of 
any series does not have any K's stamped,  it is usually graded 
and charged as a 3K as this is half way (both in quality and 
price) between 2K and 4K. The "G or GG" markings are used on all 
non-smooth series, the Trademark series and occasionally on the 
"castello" series. Recently, a few extra large Greatlines have  
used the "G" stamp to denote size.   
 
#6: In 1990 Castello introduced a new series of limited edition 
"Pipe of The Year". This series is limited to 235 total pipes, in 
all finishes combined, each numbered (1/235, 2/235/ etc). The 
Castello Pipe of The Year Series will run for ten years until the 
year 2000. The 1990 Castello POY was a slightly bent stacked 
flared top chimney with a slender taper bit and silver inlaid top 
rim. The 1991 Castello POY is a slightly bent Cherrywood or Poker 
with a silver inlaid base (under side of the bowl) and taper bit.  
 
As of the release of this article (2/92), the 1992 Castello POY 
has not been released, nor have the shapes for the future of this 
Castello series. Now let's look at the all smooth grades of 
Castellos' manufacturer. 
 
TRADEMARK [The lowest grade of all smooth, usually stained deep 
red in color]: The Trademark series is used for all of the 
standard shapes of Castello and once in a while an extra large or 
freestyle piece. Trademarks are stamped with K's that rate the 
grain quality with 2K being the lowest and 4K being the highest. 
Extra large pieces are graded G or GG which assumes that the piece 
is graded as a 4K in quality, although the G's are substituted for 
K's, and the piece is extra large in size. Even though smooth 
pieces are graded on grain quality (only?), an extra large 
Trademark is also graded on size.  
 
Since the Trademark series is the lowest all smooth  series, they 
typically have sand spots, fissures, bald spots and only average 
grain.  This line can come with well grained and problem free 
pieces, but if you want one that is more collectable than it is 
smokeable you are better off with a higher graded all smooth. The 
Trademark series offers the best value per Dollar, as far as 
"just" a smoking piece in an all smooth Castello.     
 
American Logo'd Trademarks are rarely red in color and not always 
all smooth.  You have got to be very careful in selecting this 
series with an American logo as I have seen carved (Sea Rock) and 
sandblasted (Old Antiquari) Castello pipes marked "Trademark" with 
the American markings. Most of the American logo'd Trademarks are 
all smooth light colored, poorly  grained pipes; rarely are they 
stained the European red color. American logo'd Trademarks are 
graded with the K's, although they are all sold at one set price.  
Just be careful on "diamond" Trademarks and know exactly what you 
are getting.    
 
CASTELLO "castello" [All smooth light or two toned mid-line 
series]: The "castello" series is available in all standard shapes 
along with G/GG sizes and a few freestyle Greatlines (more on the 
Greatline stamp later).  
This series is usually the pieces that grade just below a 
Collection grade and while there is some overlapping, a 2K 
"castello" is graded higher than a 4K Trademark.  In the same vein 
a 4K "castello" is graded below a 2K Collection (the highest all 
smooth standard grade). The K's are once again used to  denote the 
quality of grain and are not used for size, although an extra 
large piece is bound to have an extra K added to its grade "just" 
for its size. Shape numbers are not stamped on "castellos" (as a 
rule) and you will usually not see G or GG used, although the G 
stamp has been used more often over the last several years on the 
"castello" grade.  
 
The grain on "castellos" is usually good to very good, but seldom 
excellent as outstanding grain is reserved for the Collection 
grade. This series can vary in color from a very light natural 
color to a fairly dark two tone stain.  The "castello" series 
offers good grain quality, a relatively moderate price range and a 
good smoking value for its cost.  
American logo'd pieces in the Castello "castello" series are rare 
as the USA importer does not usually carry these.  If and when you 
see a "diamond logo'd" Castello "castello" double check the price; 
it will usually be high and is generally not recommended as the 
best value in Castello. 
 
COLLECTION [The highest grade all smooth "standard" series]: The 
Castello Collection series is graded on grain (2K, 3K, 4K), with a 
4K piece being the highest graded "standard" Castello available. 
The Collection series is usually used on straight grained briar 
with a few 2K &amp; 3K models available with crosscut/birdseye 
graining. Shape numbers are not stamped on the Collection series, 
nor are the G or GG size grades. As of 1987 the Collection series 
has had a special "year date" stamp added to their nomenclature; 
40 for 1987, 41 for 1988, 42 for 1989,  etc.   
 
American logo'd Collections are usually 1, 2 or 3K models and 
typically small to medium in size. I have seen very few "diamond 
models" that have had excellent grain, although I am sure some do. 
1K's are fairly common in American logo'd Castellos, yet rarely if 
ever seen in Italy. 1K &amp; 2K American logo Collections retail for 
the same price with 3K &amp; 4K models carrying a suggested retail of 
50% more than the 1K/2K models.  
 
Special Castello Series Pipes:    
 
The term "Greatline" is reserved for special Castello pipes, 
either freestyle or standard shaped.  The Greatline stamp was once 
used for only all smooth Collection and above models, but 
currently is used on all  finishes.  If a piece is a standard 
shaped model and it has a natural rough  top rim (as an example) 
or it is extra, extra large it could very well have the Greatline 
stamp added to its nomenclature and to its retail selling price.  
 
Most all of the non-standard freestyle pieces, especially those 
with good size, have  the Greatline stamp added whether they are 
carved, sandblasted, smooth Trademarks or "castellos". The very 
special pieces are labeled Collection-Greatline and are usually 
very good straight grained freestyle pieces.   
 
The term "Fiammata" (flame in Italian) is reserved for the highest 
graded straight grains.  Fiammatas can be standard shaped pieces, 
although they are usually freestyle models and commonly large to 
extra large pipes, with or without natural rough top rims.  
 
Fiammatas come in two "basic" models: Collection - Fiammata 
(almost always standard shapes) and Collection - Greatline - 
Fiammata (usually freestyle pieces).  A Collection - Greatline - 
Fiammata is the highest graded Castello series, the most expensive 
series and by far the most rare.  These are the ultimate 
collector's graded pieces. Fiammatas are only available in all 
smooth models and are usually light colored, although some are two 
tone stained.  
 
It should also be noted that any piece that is graded a 
"Greatline", or a Fiammata or any combination of these markings 
are sub-graded at the factory by price!  The Castello price list 
(Italian) lists all of these models at their "starting at" or 
"starting from" prices.  The actual cost/retail can be 2, 3 or 4 
times this "starting" price with no additional nomenclature added 
to differentiate between a piece that sells for $1,000.00 and one 
that sells for $3,000.00. Starting in 1989 Castello added the K 
stamp to these higher graded series of Greatlines or Fiammatas. 
1K, 2K or 3K added to a collector grade piece (G/L or Fiammata) 
changes the starting from point (for price) but does not limit the 
selling price to any degree. 
 
American logo'd Greatlines, Fiammatas and Freestyles are similar 
to Italian pieces although the prices asked for these are usually 
very high.  I believe that the European "super graded" Castello 
pipe offer a better value and quality in terms of what you will 
receive for the price asked.  The very highest graded Castello 
Greatlines and Fiammatas are seldom seen with American logos.  
 
As of mid-1989 Castello has started to "K" grade Collection - 
Fiammata and Greatline models (generally only smooth pieces, but 
with any combination of the high grade markings). The base 
Fiammata or Greatline grade is 1K with up to 3K's possible. Each K 
grade marks a "starting point" or minimum price, but, as explained 
in the paragraphs preceding, this does not guarantee much because 
all super grades only "start at" their base grade price.     
 
Unique Castello Finishes:    
 
The Castello PERLA NERA is an all smooth, waxed, deep black 
stained finish that is very, very rare.  The finish is similar to 
Dunhill's Dress finish and does not show grain.  The Castello 
Perla Nera is very limited in shape(s) with the most common being 
a small oval bowled "dress" model which is also similar to a 
Dunhill "Oval Dress" shape. I have seen a full bent #93 egg and a 
#37 oval shank Dublin in the Perla Nera, along with the oval bowl 
dress  model.  Perla Nera Castellos are very limited production 
pieces  with no shape numbers or  K's stamped on the shank of the 
pipes. We have never had an American logo'd Perla Nera piece, 
although I have seen a photograph of a full bent 93 "diamond 
logo'd Perla Nera. The Perla Nera grade is priced at about the 
same as a Collection model Castello.    
 
The Castello EPOCA series is a hand sculptured finish that comes 
in three basic styles.  #1: The "dripped wax" model is currently 
the most common and is similar to the Radice "wick" finish or the 
Caminetto/Ascorti "New dear" finish. The wood on these looks like 
dripping wax with "tear drops" going down the sides of the bowl. 
#2: The "Rock" style is a hand carved finish that looks like a 
broken piece of rock. This used to be the most common style of 
Epoca and some prefer it to the "Wax" style, although I do not 
believe that it has as much character as the newer wax Epoca. 
#3: Once in a great while you will see a few of the "shingle" style 
hand carved Epocas. This finish looks like cedar shingles (like on 
a roof) and I believe is the oldest style of Epoca. Very few  of 
these are made today, although I think that they would be popular 
if they were available.  
 
Castello Epocas are not stamped with K's for their grade (they are 
sometimes stamped with a "G" for size), nor are they stamped with 
shape numbers.  As of late the supply of Epocas has been fairly 
good. This is not the usual case as the production of Castello 
Epocas is very limited, quite simply because of the time involved 
to create the finish. Epocas will vary in price based more on 
their size than on the carving (small, medium, large and extra 
large G/GG). Epoca production is very limited with only 24 
Castello Epoca pipes having been produced in 1991, all were the 
dripped wax style Epoca. 

The Castello BAMBOO series was first introduced in 1987.  This new 
series first came out with bowls that were graded "Collection" and 
had long Bamboo shanks.  
 
They were eventually produced in brown carved, tan sandblasted and 
smooth "castello" grades all with long bamboo shanks. Currently 
the production of Castello Bamboo pipes has stopped as Castello's 
supply of aged bamboo has been exhausted, however this should 
resume sometime in the future.  Castello Bamboos are priced at 2 
or 3 times the price of a non-bamboo finish; this is true for all 
of the finishes. The total 1987/88 production of Castello Bamboos 
was limited to 2 or 3 dozen pieces. 
 
In 1989 Castello introduced a new variation in style which we will 
refer to as the Sculptured Series. This finish is actually a 
carved pattern used on the surface of smooth finished "castello" &amp; 
Collection graded pipes. Over the course of 1989 we have carried 
less than a dozen Sculptured Castellos, although we have seen a 
few additional pieces during our trips to Italy. This style of 
carving consists of a spiral or paneled surface that is smooth 
polished and shows the grain (unlike an Epoca that is not smooth 
and generally hides the grain).  
 
This new Sculptured finish could have been the &lt;MI&gt;new for '89&lt;D&gt; 
Epoca style as it is available in standard shapes and follows the 
logic of carving an additional finish over the basic shape. The 
production of sculptured Castello pipes in 1990 and 1991 were very 
limited with few available in the USA in either logo. 
 
We are now going to list the shape numbers for Castello pipes with 
a brief description of the shape and a few comments for each.  
Most of these shapes we have seen, some we haven't and some are no 
longer commonly made. Since there are so many variations of each 
that come about by hand making them, and because there are so many 
"if, and &amp; but" when it comes to grading these, we will list both 
numbers and comments that are based on our experience.  You may 
find pieces made by Castello that are either not on this list or 
simply mis-marked.  Keeping this in-mind, here goes...

Shape Numbers   
 
KEY: SR [all carved Sea Rock finishes], OA [Old Antiquari 
sandblasted], TM [Trademark], CS [Castello "castello"], CO 
[Collection], EP [Epoca], FA [Collection - Fiammata], GL 
[Greatline - standard shapes], SL [Sculptured].  
We have listed the "Key" finishes after each number to let you 
know which shapes are available in which finishes.  These are 
based on the Castello pipes that we have either had in-stock or 
seen and while it is possible to have certain shapes in other 
finishes, it is not at all common. The Perla Nera is not listed 
since it is so rare and basically only available in the "Dress 
oval-bowl shape". The new Sculptured finish is listed although 
very few are available, these have not become more common over the 
last couple of years, but may in the future.  
 
Note: Pipes that are finished in the "Sculptured" finish carry the 
"castello" or Collection grade and are only being listed as 
different models as a matter of information. 
 
#12 - Liverpool or long shanked, taper bit Billiard. Not a common 
shape; runs small and not available in G/GG. [SR] 
 
#14 - Small to medium size Lovat with a saddle bit. Not too common 
a shape; runs fairly small and mostly in 2 or 3K sizes.  Almost 
always found in Sea Rock finishes and can come (rarely) with an 
oval shank and actually be a short Canadian rather than a saddle 
bit, round shank Lovat. [SR, OA, TM]    
 
#15 - Standard wide bowled Billiard or Pot.  This is a very common 
shape that is found in all sizes including G/GG and all finishes. 
The #15 comes with either a saddle bit, a taper bit or a stick bit 
&amp; ferrule; the most common stem is the saddle.  The basic shape 
varies from a billiard shape to a wider bowled Pot shape and is 
fairly common with square paneled sides. [SR, OA, TM, CS, CO, EP, 
FA, SL]    
 
#16 - Tall slender Billiard that can vary from a classic style to 
a slender stacked shape.  This is a very common shape that is 
available in all finishes. These are usually found in &lt;197&gt;all 
standard sizes although G/GG are not readily available. Taper bits 
are the most common although saddle bits are available. [SR, OA, 
TM, CS, CO, EP]    
 
#17 - Pot; Not a common shape and it is seldom seen.  Most "Pots" 
are stamped #15, so we do not have many details of this shape and 
can not remember ever having one in-stock. 
 
#19 - 1/8 or slightly bent long shank Billiard.  This shape is 
usually found with a "wavy" top rim and almost always with a taper 
bit.  These range from small to medium large, although they are 
usually not found in the G/GG sizes. Fairly common shape. [SR, OA, 
TM, CS, CO, EP]    
 
#23 - Standard classic Apple with a taper bit.  This is common 
shape that is readily available in "K" sizes. As of 1988 available 
and common in the G/GG size especially in Epoca, Sea Rock and Old 
Antiquari but not the higher grades. Almost always found with a 
rounded smooth polished top rim and thick walls. [SR, OA, TM, CS, 
CO, EP]  
 
#24 - Prince (of Wales) with a slightly bent taper bit.  This is a 
fairly common shape, although the production is limited and few 
ever arrive in the USA.  Rarely found in smooth finishes or in 
G/GG sizes. We have seen this shape with a taper bit but usually 
with an army mount &amp; stick bit. [SR, OA, TM, CO]    
 
#25 - Classic straight Dublin with saddle, taper or "stick" (army 
mount) bit.  This is a very common and popular shape that is found 
in all finishes, although not usually in the G/GG sizes. [SR, OA, 
TM, CS, CO, EP, SL]    
 
#26 - Short bent Horn.  Another rarely made shape that usually 
looks more like a "prince" or a 1/4 bent squat Apple or Brandy. 
Not generally available in G/GG. [SR]    
 
#28 - Slight bent Horn. Not a common shape - no information or 
details. [?]  
 
#30 - Fat chubby Apple with an oval shank and slight bent taper 
bit. Somewhat common shape with lots of briar used. These are not  
long pieces and are sized in all grades like a G23. Available in 
G/GG sizes, although there is not much of a difference in size 
from a 4K model. Variations include square shanks and stems. [SR, 
OA, TM, CS, CO]  
 
#31 - Slightly bent oval shank Canadian.  This is a very popular 
and fairly common shape which is almost always found with a taper 
bit.  Small to med/ large in size and rarely found in the G/GG 
sizes. [SR, OA, TM, CS, CO, EP, SL] 
 
#32 - Straight classic Canadian with an oval shank and almost 
always a taper bit. This is a very popular shape and is quite 
common in all grades, sizes and finishes. Usually when marked G/GG 
the "extra large" refers to a longer shank and only slightly to 
the bowl size. With the G/GG models &amp; extra long shank, it is 
common that the airhole is drilled off center. [SR, OA, TM, CS, 
CO, EP, FA, SL]     
 
#33 - Short fat squat chubby Canadian or oval shank Pot. Not very 
common or popular and always found with a taper bit. Not available 
in G/GG sizes. [SR, OA, TM, CS, CO, EP, SL]     
 
#34 - Large bowled flared top semi-Dublin that is usually found 
with an oval shank, slight bend and taper bit. Semi-common and 
slightly popular for its extra large chamber with medium overall 
size;  occasionally found with a "stick" type bit. These are 
larger in overall bowl capacity. Not usually available in G/GG 
sizes. [SR, OA, TM, CS, CO, SL] 
 
#35 - Slightly bent oval shank Billiard with a forward "pitched" 
tall bowl. This is not a real common shape although it is fairly 
popular. Always found with an oval taper bit and fairly thick 
walls. Never seen in a G/GG size. [SR, OA, TM, CO, CS]    
 
#37 - Slightly bent, slender oval shanked Dublin with a taper bit. 
This is not a very common shape although it is quite popular. 
These vary in style and can be found in short almost straight oval 
shanked pieces, but this variation is not common or popular. Not 
seen in G/GG sizes. [SR, OA, TM, CS, CO]     
 
#38 - Oval shank Horn. Not common or readily available - no 
information. [?]   
#39 - Slightly bent Yacht or Horn with an oval or rounded shank 
and taper bit. This shape varies from slender to fat and chubby. 
Not real common or popular and rarely seen in a G/GG size. [SR, 
OA, TM, CS, CO] 
 
NOTE: In 1989 Castello started making a medium sized fairly 
slender elongated shaped style with a forward pitch, an oval 
shank, taper bit and slightly bent shank and stem. This is a very 
attractive shape that is lightweight, modern and usually 
lightweight. We have seen these stamped #37, #38 &amp; #39, although 
usually #38. [SR, OA, CO, CS, TM] 
 
#41 - This is a new shape re-introduced in 1989. Small, slender 
stacked rounded billiard styled bowl with a long thin round shank 
and a short (usually slightly bent) taper bit. Very limited 
availability with no G/GG pieces.  [SR, OA, TM, CS, CO]. 
 
#49 - Medium large classic Calabash with a ferrule and stick bit.  
This is a very popular style that is readily available in all 
finishes. Shank extensions are found in either Lucite or Briar and 
occasionally in a silver "cup". Variations include natural rough 
tops, square shanks, diamond shanks and "paneled" bowls.  Fairly 
common in G/GG sizes. [SR, OA, TM, CS, CO, EP, FA, GL]     
 
#54 - Classic 1/2 bent Bulldog or bent Rhodesian with a diamond 
shank and saddle bit.  This is a very popular shape although it is 
limited in production. During the second half of 1989 this shape 
became quite common although we do not expect this high 
availability to continue.  Occasionally found with a taper bit and 
commonly found with briar extensions on the mouthpiece. Common 
with a stick bit and ferrule made of briar, lucite or dressed with 
a silver "cup".  Only lately available G/GG sizes! [SR, OA, TM, 
CS, CO, FA, GL]     
 
#55 - Slightly bent short chubby squat Pot with a short shank and 
taper bit. This is a fairly common although not popular shape that 
has thick wall and a medium large capacity. Not readily available 
in G/GG sizes. [SR, OA, TM, CS, CO]    
 
#56 - Straight classic diamond shank Bulldog with taper, saddle or 
"army"  bit. This is a very popular shape that is quite common in 
all finishes and sizes. Usually has thick walls and available in 
G/GG.  Occasionally stamped "Greatline" and found either extra, 
extra large or with a natural rough top rim. [SR, OA, TM, CS, CO, 
EP, FA]  
 
#60 - This shape number is currently used for a straight square 
shanked panel. Not a classic square bowed panel, but more of a 
paneled Apple and occasionally slightly bent. Uses either a square 
saddle or taper bit.  Not generally available in G/GG sizes and 
not very common. This number has been used in the past for a bent 
Apple, however we have not seen one of these in quite a while. 
[SR, OA, CS, CO]  
 
#63 - 3/4 bent Apple with a round shank and army style stick bit.  
This shape always uses a ferrule or shank extension of either 
Lucite or briar and has a rounded top rim. Not available in the 
G/GG size and not real common, although fairly popular. [SR, OA, 
TM, CS, CO]     
 
#64 - 1/2 bent fancy Apple with ferrule and fancy stick bit. Is 
not a common shape, nor readily available. No information. [?]    
 
#65 - Classic 3/4 bent Billiard.  This is probably the most 
popular standard Castello shape and is readily available in all 
sizes and finishes. The bowl shape can vary from "rounded" to 
classic parallel walls and comes with either a saddle or taper 
bit. Common in G/GG and popular sizes. [SR, OA, TM, CS, CO, EP, 
FA]     
 
#66 - 3/4 to full bent rounded Billiard with a Diamond shank and 
saddle bit.  This shape is very popular and fairly common (lately 
hard to find), although limited in production. Fairly common in 
G/GG sizes with the non-smooth pieces running smaller as a rule 
than the smooth. [SR, OA, TM, CS, CO]    
 
#67 - Medium large thick walled Pot/Billiard with a "domed" shank 
and flat base on the bottom of the bowl and shank. This is a 
fairly common shape which is readily available and always found 
with a taper bit. The shape runs toward the larger with G/GG 
fairly common in the non-smooth shapes. Fairly rare in the smaller 
sizes. [SR, OA, TM, CS, CO, EP]     
 
#74 - Extra large, tall stacked "shank" or Chimney with a short 
shank and stick type bit. This shape is more common in the G/GG 
size than it is in the "standard" sizes.  The bowls are thin in 
width, 3 to 4 inches tall and have fairly thick walls. Shank 
extensions are usually made of Lucite rather than briar. Sometimes 
marked "774" instead of G74. [SR, OA, TM, CS, CO]   
 
#75 - Straight classic Lovat or long round shank Billiard. This 
piece is always found with a short saddle bit. Fairly popular and 
readily available in most sizes and finishes.  As with the #32 
(long shank)  Canadian, G/GG sizes are available with the grade 
referring to shank length  more so than bowl size. [SR, OA, TM, 
CS, CO, EP, FA]     
 
#84 - "Inverted Bent Billiard or Hawkbill Shape" is how this shape 
is listed on our 1985 listing.  The pieces that we have had lately 
are more like a squat Apple styled bowl with an oval "S" bent 
longer shank and short taper bit.  This is a very limited shape 
which is not really popular but is really different. We have not 
seen any in GG size. [SR, OA, CS] 
 
#85 - Bull Moose Panel - Not common - no information.  
 
#87 - Slightly bent Poker or Cherrywood with a saddle bit and flat 
base to the bowl. This is a very limited shape that is fairly 
popular when available.  Never seen in a G/GG size and rarely in 
smooth finishes.  [SR, OA, TM, CO, CS]     
 
#88 - Slightly bent army mounted Poker with stick bit. This, like 
the #87 Poker is fairly popular, but seldom produced. Not 
available in G/GG sizes or rarely in smooth finishes. [SR, OA, CO, 
CS]    
 
#89 - Full bent Poker - Not  available, no real information. 
 
#93 - Full bent slender shanked Egg with a army mount and long 
thin stick bit. This shape is fairly common and popular; almost 
always includes a ferrule made from either lucite or briar. A 
variation that is new for 1989 is the 93 bowl with a flush taper 
bit. Very rare in the G/GG size, although it runs slightly larger 
than some other shapes (G/GG 93's are much larger than K sized 
93's). [SR, OA, TM, CS, CO, FA, SL, EP]     
 
#95 - Long shank straight Pot/Billiard with a saddle bit.  This 
shape is a lot like a #15 except that the shank is a little longer 
(not as long as a #75 Lovat or #32 Canadian).  Rare, as most of 
the pieces in this shape are stamped #15. Never found in G/GG, 
although G/GG are common in the #15. [SR, OA, CO]    
 
#97 - Classic large bowled Oom Paul with a saddle bit.  This is a 
fairly common shape which is moderately popular in all of the 
finishes. G/GG sizes are common, as are smooth finishes. [SR, OA, 
TM, CS, CO, FA, GL, SL]    
 
Please Note: The following 4 shape numbers are currently produced 
by the Castello factory on a very limited basis, all of them start 
with a "2" which has a special meaning. First, all 3 digit shape 
numbers are formed by adding the "2" to the basic shape number 
(last 2 digits). Next the 2 signifies that the piece uses a fancy 
cut "freestyle" stick bit, usually directly into the shank 
(although NOT flush mounted).  Lastly, 2-prefixed shape numbered 
pieces are always bent pieces, usually at least 1/2 bents.  While 
it is possible to create any 2-prefixed shape,  this is generally 
not done by Castello.  The following shapes are the most common 
2-prefixed shapes and while limited in production, they are 
available and popular. 2-prefixed shapes are generally not 
available in G/GG sizes, but run slightly larger than the standard 
shape.   
 
#215 - Fancy 1/4 bent Billiard with a slightly flared shank.  This 
piece usually has a slightly wavy top and can or can not have a 
ferrule made of lucite or briar. Runs from medium to large in size 
and looks similar to a #19. [SR, OA, TM, CS, CO]    
 
#225 - Large fancy 1/4 to 1/2 bent Dublin with a stick bit.  This 
shape is similar to a #34 and commonly has a wavy top rim.  These 
are more common in smooth than in rough and run large. Usually are 
not found with a ferrule. [OA, CS, CO]   
 
#287 - Large 3/4 to full bent fancy Poker with a fancy freestyle 
saddle bit. This shape is very popular yet rarely found. The shank 
is quite bent and the bowl is larger than either the #87 or #88. 
In 1989 we have carried a few "G" 287's  [SR, OA, CS, EP]    
 
#293 - Medium large fancy 3/4 to full bent Egg with a fancy stick 
bit and slightly wavy top rim.  This is the shape that was used as 
a model for the American Castello 40th year limited edition.  
These pieces are fairly common with lots of wood in the bowl.  
Many of the smooth models are crosscut - birdseye grained. Limited 
but available in G/GG. 
 
The 293 is the most common "2-prefixed" shape found in a G/GG 
size. Finish availability is based on regular stock and the 40th 
years pieces that we have had. [SR, OA, TM, CS, CO, EP, SL]    
 
Note: In late 1991 we selected a few Castello Collection graded 
pipes that were stick bit "flared shank", fiammata graded Apples.  
 
This shape could have been just a test shape or it could be a part 
of the Castello line in future production. Based on the style and 
classic bowl shape, we would classify these few pieces as #223, 
for the classic 23 shaped Apple bowl and the "2" prefix for the 
shank-stem treatment.  
 
Grading and Marking the Pieces:    
 
If you have had the privilege of viewing a lot of Castello pipes 
you will know that they are very inconsistent in grading and in 
their "exact" shapes.  The shape variation is easy to explain as 
these are 100% handmade pipes with the only "guide" being the 
craftsman's eye. Each of the Castello craftsman have certain 
shapes and styles that they are skilled at making, however the 
grain or faults of the piece of wood that they are forming will 
more or less determine the final shape and how much it will vary 
from the "standard" or classic shape. This can be seen in many of 
the #19, #15, &amp; #215's where the bowl shape actually comes in a 
square panel, even though these shapes are not "panel" shapes.  If 
the flaws are just surface flaws the piece is usually sandblasted 
(Old Antiquari) or carved (Sea Rock). 
 
Sand spots and small "points" are not considered by Castello as a 
major fault and do not affect the grading of smooth pieces; even 
the highest graded fiammata will usually have several small sand 
spots or points. The inconsistency of grading can be attributed to 
the fact that Castello pipes are NOT graded at the time that they 
are produced.  All of the finished Castello pipes are placed in 
the stock room without nomenclature!   
 
Once a Castello dealer (in Italy) has selected his stock and 
Franco Coppo has taken back the pieces that he doesn't want to 
sell ( he will actually  remove pipes from the selection and 
return them to his inventory ), the pipes are THEN graded and 
stamped.  
 
There are no set standards for grading size or series, other than 
how Franco views the pieces that he is grading at that point in 
time.  If the selection that is being graded consists of many 
extra large pipes (at the time), only  the largest ones will be 
marked G/GG. If the selection consists of all excellent straight 
grains, only a few of the very finest will be marked  Fiammata 
with the balance being 3 and 4K Collections.  On pipes that are 
naturally Sea Rocks or Trademarks (based on their finish and 
staining) the only determination that will be made will be their 
size grade (Trademarks are graded technically on grain, although 
the size does factor in since this is an in-between series).  If 
you think that this explanation is confusing,  how would you like 
to be the one that has to grade these pipes! 
 
If you will remember that a piece is graded based on its grain and 
size at the point in time that it is sold by the factory. You will 
get a better feel for the variations that occur.  While the same 
piece might grade higher or lower at another point in time, 
depending on how the briar is running at that time, all Castello 
pipes are graded by one person (Franco Coppo) who has viewed and 
graded the total factory's production for many years.   
Each Castello pipe should be viewed and/or purchased on its own 
merits by its eventual user, based on what you expect from the 
piece (price vs. grain &amp; size), since it is your hard earned 
Dollars that will be spent to acquire the piece. With this guide 
you will be able to know what you are looking at and hopefully, 
will enjoy smoking and collecting Castello pipes. 
 
Foot notes:  
 
This guide was originally written in early 1988, Carlo Scotti died 
at the age of 86 in October 1988. There are a few additional items 
that should be added to our Castello Shape and Grade Guide: 
Castello has experimented with a new Old Antiquari finish, which 
is a Black Sandblast. Old Antiquari pipes are sandblasted pieces 
that are now available in 1) Light Tan, 2) Medium rust Brown and 
3) the  Black with red highlights (extremely limited).  
The second item that should have been included is a Collection 
sub-grade for a "classified" Birdseye grain stamped Occhio di 
Pernice (literal translation: Eye of Partridge).  We had been told 
of this grade and had seen 1 photograph of it, but had never 
actually seen one or had one in stock so it was easy to "forget" 
this grade when we were making up the article. In July of 1988,  
PCCA received 6 pieces of "Occhio di Pernice" graded Castellos for 
our regular inventory, since then we have had 6 additional 
birdseye graded Castellos. Occhio's are still produced in classic 
shapes, although in very limited numbers. Castello birdseye graded 
pieces are priced at 20 to 25% above a 4K Collection and do not 
carry any K's for grade or shape numbers.  
 
When you look over this Castello guide you should pay attention to 
the details of grades, sizes and shapes to get a better 
understanding of what to expect from Castello pipe shapes and 
sizes. A few examples are: 1) The Epoca series is priced by 
Size and while a few do come in stamped "G", most do not 
carry any size grade. 2) G/GG size stamps vary depending on the 
basic style or shape. A #65 (3/4 bent) and #15 (straight 
Pot/Billiard) have large to extra large bowl capacities - A #75 
(Lovat) or #32 (Canadian) have long to extra long shanks, but only 
medium to medium large bowl Capacities - A #23 (Apple) or 54 bent 
Bulldog have a fat, chubby bowl shape with more thickness, but 
only a medium to medium large capacity.  All are properly graded G 
or GG sizes and yet each is unique to its shape.  
The addition of the G or GG size grade does not mean that the 
walls are extra thick and the tobacco chamber is extra large 
(except possibly with the #65 &amp; #15).     
 
In 1991 Castello produced 50 miniature Castello pipes under the 
name of IL Casteline (the little Castle). These are tiny 
reproductions of classic Castello shapes available in all finishes 
and most styles. PCCA has acquired a total of 8 Casteline pipes 
for our inventory. While standard finish and grades are not 
stamped on these special Castello pipes, we have seen shapes #19, 
#32, #49, #56, #75 and several "greatline" freestyled pieces in 
both smooth finished and sandblasted models. Very rare, fully 
functional, miniature Castello pipes are not available with the 
American "diamond logo". 
 
Castello Value 
 
There are many variations of these listed shapes in size, 
mouthpiece, basic shape and nomenclature. As with any hand made 
product the differences can add to the collecting of Castello 
pipes. New Castello pipes can be purchased for as little as a few 
hundred dollars to as much as many thousand, each offers its new 
owner an outstanding smoking experience with almost an endless 
variety of shapes, styles and grades. There is a Castello pipe for 
everyone.  
 
Over the last several years, the Castello pipemaking operation has 
expanded its product base to include briar ashtrays, tampers/pipe 
tools, a new leather and silk tobacco pouch and a briar finished 
pipe rack.  Some of the new Castello products are currently being 
offered to test the value of each in the retail marketplace. All 
Castello products are handmade, exceptional quality items that 
offer a lifetime of style, craftsmanship, beauty and enjoyment.

<a name="19">Subject: storage of tobacco</a>

Steve:
        You can pu this in the Digest if you think there is much interest.
Otherwise, perhaps it will help you, at least.

        After spending a couple of years buying all kinds of tobacco in
massive quantities, I have, by trial and error, found a few hints that work
for me.  I have been given advice, by the way, that storing tobacco in the
freezer is perfectly OK, but freezer space is at a premium here in my
Arizona home, so I have settled on a cool, inside closet of my home.
        The main tip I have learned is that most tobacco, if tightly
sealed, will keep without extra humidification (provided it is not being
opened up frequently, of course).  Forget the potatoes, apples, vials of
water, etc. if you are interested in long-term storage.  Just seal the
tobacco in an air-tight container.  I have also discovered that it is wise
to avoid handling the tobacco while transferring it to the glass container
(apparently, mold spores live on even the best-washed hands).  If the
tobacco is a little dry when you put it in the jar, you might want to add a
little distilled water.  Still, avoid mixing the tobacco with your hands if
you can resist.
        I have used glass jars to store tobacco with and without a vacuum
seal. You can buy a dozen mason-type jars with lids for $8.00 (less for
smaller ones).  The half-pint sizes are large enough for the leftovers from
a 50 gm tin.  Generally, if I'm storing it for a few months or longer, I
use a vacuum. Otherwise, I just seal the jar tightly.  The vacuum really
helps assure that the seal is airtight.  Also, it is very difficult for
tobacco to spoil in a vacuum, but it can get moldy in a non-vacuum jar (I
think it unlikely, but it _has_ happened to me, and I did not even have
potato slices in the jar).  If your seal is tight, you really don't need
potatoes, and probably have little to worry about, either in terms of
drying out or losing flavor.
        The vacuum storage method for tobacco works quite well (I have been
using it for over a year, both for opened tins and bulk tobacco).  It
enables you to store tobacco in mason-type jars or any airtight jars of
other types (such as gallon pickle jars--once cleaned and deodorized, of
course).  The hand-powered device that creates the vacuum is called a
Pump-n-Seal, and is available from USA Direct, Inc.  The number for
ordering (or information, I imagine) is 1-800-334-0066.
        Some electronic bag-sealing devices advertised on TV or sold in
department stores come with attachments for vacuum-packing Mason-type jars.
I know one that works well is made by Decosonic, which I think is often
featured on home shopping channels.

<a name="21">Subject: Non-briar (Walnut) Pipes</a>

For my birthday this year my brother (a cigar smoker and all around good guy) 
gave me a beautiful freehand :) made by a fella named Charlie DiFranco (he 
owns a shop at 797 Highway 33,Hamilton Square, NJ 08619, (609)587-6375 - 
apparently Charlie has made a few briars in his day, incuding several for Der 
Bingle, and ships worldwide).  The pipe smokes wonderfully and came pre-smoked 
to ensure that a proper cake was developed.

&gt;From the wide grain pattern, it was obvious that the pipe was not
briar.  When I called Mr. DiFranco and asked him about the pipe I was
told it was made of walnut.  Considering what I have read about
non-briars burning out (thru?)  faster than their briar brothers, I
asked him if the pipe required any extra care to insure a long, happy
life for me and my new found friend.  His response was simply to
"Smoke it cool".  Considering I smoke primarily aromatics, smoking
cool is not always an easy thing to do (I do my best not to smoke like
a chimney).

Has anyone else out there had any experience with pipes made of walnut?  Do 
they indeed tend to "burn-out" quicker, or is it really based on the 
individual smoker?  Please let me know what you think, and if you're in the 
Central Jersey area, pay Charlie a visit - it's worth the stop.

[ I have a Ben Wade made of walnut, in a Danish freehand shape,
vintage late seventies. Smokes great. And, yes, Charlie is worth a
visit, especially on a weekday when he's not so busy. -S. ]

And, as some of you may have noticed, it's been about two weeks since
the last Digest went out.  No excuses, just been busy. Hope you don't
mind.  But, taking Nording in hand, filling it with Three Nuns, and
hoping for a cool breeze, we now bring you the first in a one-to-three
part late-summer miniseries, featuring news of reeds, nylon, wodka,
concealed weapons, and of course the winners of the Lousiest Smoke

Hi Steve

I'm sorry about my obscure expression. What I really wanted to know was the 
price of Dunhill's * Early Morning Pipe* in USA, not the Amphora's. I meant 
that Early Morning Pipe costs 10 $ per 50 grams here in Finland. (Amphora 
costs here a little over 5$, 40 grams)

Now I have packed my rucksack (loaded with Early Morning Pipe) and am gonna 
fly early to morrow to Lapland. Will be back August 11th.

50 grams of EMP could be had for US$3.75 in the winter of 1994.  Enjoy
your trip to Lapland!  -S. ]

<a name="3">Subject: Nastiest Smoke</a>

Steve:

I've been getting the Pipe's Digest for a couple weeks now,
and I love it.  Thank you.

I thought I'd put in my two-cents worth on my worst smoke ever.
Actually, it's probably a three-way tie.

The first contender I smoked when I was a lad at summer camp.
We cut reeds from beside the river, set fire to one end, and
inhaled from the other.  Most unsatisfactory.

The next contender was a pipe tobacco blended by the proprietor
of a shop in Fredericksburg, VA.  It smelled OK until one actually
set it afire.  The scent of the smoke was reminiscient of burning
electrical wire.  Being at work at the time, I was quickly inundated
by people wondering where the fire was.  I was told that I could
smoke my cigars and pipes all I wanted, but I was not to use that
particular tobacco again.

The last candidate for my worst smoke ever was the ubiquitous menthol
cigarette.  I have come to believe that the only reason menthol is
added to cigarettes is to hide the fact that the tobacco is worthless
for any other purpose, save perhaps fertilizer.  :-)

Keep up the good work.

<a name="4">Subject: Henry Clay - Great Compromiser  [cigar]</a>

Here's a true story that only a cigar smoker can truly appreciate so I 
thought I'd send it for all to enjoy:

While on vacation the week of the Fourth of July, we stopped in at Jon's 
Pipe Shop in Champaigne, IL.  They have a good selection of estate pipes 
on hand, and I selected a nice calabash briar along with a couple maduro 
cigars.  One was a Henry Clay Brevas Ala Conserva [Corona Extra from the 
Dominican Republic: 46 ring, 5 5/8 long].  

Well, last night I took it from the humidor since I thought I'd have time 
to enjoy it.  My wife was doing a round of diaper changes as I cut off 
the end and lit it up.  It had a spicy taste and a tight draw.  As I 
looked down Amy was just finishing up the our 9 month old son.  Instead 
of settling down for a quiet evening, I saw her grab his sister and take 
her diaper off again.  The diaper was just as clean as it was when she 
put it on minutes earlier.  Only then did we realized that it was the 
Henry Clay that caused the pungent aroma every mother is familiar with.  
I offered to let it go out or move to the porch; but after a few minutes 
the aroma changed to that spicy, full aroma I had expected.  Overall, it 
was a nice cigar, but that initial lighting certainly called for a great 
compromise.  Perhaps that's the reason for the name?

     bureaucrat, elevated to the Chief position at the end of Reagan's

Steve: one of my recent customers for some nice estate pipes was impressed

always built up with black residue after awhile and he was worried that he
was doing something wrong. Below  is my respose which might be of use to some
of your readers. Regards,.....Rex

The black residue on the rim is due to ash deposits as well as finish and
tobacco oils  which are charred from your lighting over time. Try the
following, in increasing order of seriousness:

*  Use long wooden matches which allow you to focus the fire into the bowl
hole.
*  Wipe off the top after each smoke with a damp paper towel.
*  Wipe the top periodically wi th a rag moistened with vodka or similar.
*  Gently scrape with a sharp pen-knife lightly held at a near right angle to
the surface and     
    then lightly buff with mild jewelers rouge or similar polishing compound
on a soft rag 
   before  re-waxing and final buffing.
*  Take to your favorite pipe repair and restoration expert.

<a name="17">Subject: J.T. &amp; D. Cooke</a>

Steve,
   
Having recovered from the sad experience of visiting a dying pipe shop
(as related in the last issue), I thought I might share a *much* more
pleasant experience.
   
At the PCI Show in St Louis I was enthralled by a table of gorgeous
Dunhill LBs, all of which were well beyond the reach of my meager
budget.  Upon returning from the show, I decided to look into the
possibility of having a "clone" made.  I had heard good things about Jim
Cooke through the Digest and the "Ephemeris," so I gave him a call.
   
I had a very pleasant conversation with Jim, during which I explained
that I wanted an LB shape with an ODA-size bowl in a shell finish, with
a fishtail saddle bit.  Jim told me he would ship the pipe to me (*on
approval*, no less) in about a month.
   
I received the pipe two days ago; to say I am pleased would be an
understatement.  The pipe is nothing short of a work of art.  The
sandblasting is excellent, and Jim's stem work is nothing short of 
superb.  The smooth-polished top (an agreed-upon design modification) 
reveals tons of birdseye, and the overall visual impact of the piece 
is striking.  This afternoon I stuffed its capacious bowl with Bob
Hamlin's "Equinox" blend and discovered that the pipe smokes as good as
it looks--no mean feat.  I'm seriously considering having Jim make 
a "Tanshell" mate in the very near future.
   
Dealing with Jim  is extremely enjoyable.  He is a craftsman of the 
first order, and his prices are very reasonable.  He's listed in
the Guide, but here is his address and phone number again:
   
J. T. &amp; D. Cooke
RFD 1 Box 1022
East Fairfield, VT 05448-9801
(802) 849-6272
   
Upon request, Jim will send a flyer with a price list and photos of some
of his work.  I *wholeheartedly* recommend Jim to anyone who wants a
custom pipe made-to-order, or to anyone who needs any sort of repair
work done.  I guarantee they won't be disappointed.

Steve,

Thank you for the wonderfull digest.  I've been content just to read many 
of the posts.  But Ken's question about people in there 20's smoking pipes 
prompted me to finally write a brief introduction, relate a story, and ask 
a question.  I'm 29 years old an have been smoking a pipe for about 12 
years.  I have 12 pipes in my collection, and mostly smoke a blend called 
Argonock (Spelling is questionable) its a blend that I get mailed to me 
from Michigan.  

I remember when I was in my early 20's smoking a pipe when driving 
frequently would cause radom stoping by the state police.  Allthough I was 
not speeding, or doing anything else wrong, the stops started to become a 
regular problem.  When being stoped the routine was always the same,the police 
officer would walk to the side of my auto, notice that I was not attempting 
to hide the pipe or whatever blend I was smoking, take a large smell of my 
auto, and then let me go.  The way I actually got this to stop was simple.  
I grew a beard.  No kidding.  It does work.

One quick question, I'm looking for insight.  I smoke when driving.  I have 
a ragtop.  So there is no roof,  any suggestion on how to smoke in a 
convertable.

Thanks

My absolute worst smoke?  That's easy... in fact I think I mentioned it in an
earlier issue.

The players:  Bengal Slices (aromatic)
              Peterson Killarney 02

BTW, recently on a.s.p, several people discussed the Killarney pipe and its
highly glossed plastic (?) finish.  I know after I got mine, I hated it worse
than anything.  Big, heavy, the stain so dark you can barely see the grain, and
that mysteriously hard, glossy finish that definitely isn't carnauba wax. 
Certainly didn't compare to other Petersons (a 312 system pipe and a Shamrock
canadian) I have, and MOST certainly not with my Ashtons!

So anyway, a relatively inexperienced smoker smoking a latakia mixture in this
klunky pipe, wondering if this the ethereal Bengal Slices experience that
everyone was touting on a.s.p and PD.  After a quarter hour later of puffing
and staring at the Tyndall blue smoke, I became _extremely_ green around the
gills.  My other tin of the "real" (i.e., nonaromatic variety) Bengal Slices
has been sitting in storage ever since, waiting, waiting...

I hope we'll follow this thread with our best smoke ;-&gt;

(BTW, to follow up on my last article that I found on Sherlock Holmes' smoking
 habits in the Baker Street Journal (New Series), I'm trying to locate another
 promising article entitled "The Pipe and Cap", which is in the BSJ,
 New Series, 1959, volume 1.  Any Holmesian scholars out there with
 access to this periodical?  I've been looking at Gravesend Books'

<a name="23">Subject: good smoke, bad smoke, FDA, etc.</a>

Steve, etc.

Had a remarkably pleasant cigar smoking experience the other day with, of all
things, a Don Diego (6x48). When I first got them last year I thought they
smoked well, but were a little bland; however, after aging eight months in my
humidor (pressed up against a couple Partagas, and at one point, a Romeo Y
Julieta--Dominican, not Cuban), the tobacco matured wonderfully and picked up
some spice. I lit up on a quiet Sunday morning and enjoyed 45 minutes of
perfectly burning, medium-flavored smoke. I have one left and hope I enjoy it
as much.

Unfortunately, smoking has not always been so pleasant. Recently, I lit up a
Royal Jamaica Churchill that smoked like an old Commodore 64 (I own a Packard
Bell, so I can't sign on to Steve's analogy to cigars built like them=2E) It
drew like a straw in a sponge, and started to burn down the side. At one
point the top was two inches ahead of the bottom. I crushed out the unburnt
spar, cut it off even and tried again. It burnt better, but still drew
poorly. I remember being in the mood for a relaxing smoke that day. As you
can see, I didn't get it.

The worst tasting smoke I ever had, besides a Swisher Sweet (I just don't get
the sugar thing) was a 5 inch something-or-other from the Thompson Cigar
Company. Harsh, bitter, stung my lips, left an after taste like burnt garlic.
I took five puffs and gave up. It actually put me off cigars for a couple
weeks, which is too bad, because I've smoked some Thompson sizes that I've
really enjoyed.

As for the on-going tobacco battle: I do think the FDA is overreacting, not
to tobacco, but to their own embarrassing 20+ years of inaction. Anyone who'd
ever seen their friends or relatives try to quit smoking knew that something
in the cigarette was addictive, so the FDA shouldn't dump all the blame on
the tobacco companies. To say they covered up something that was so painfully
obvious is silly. The FDA should just say that both sides screwed up and then
both sides should relax and get on with life. Tobacco is not the Great Satan
Kessler says it is, but likewise, no-smoking sections and smoke-free flights
are not a threat to the Constitution. To quote Molly Ivins, `these things are
not tyranny, they're a pain in the ass.' There's a huge difference. 
IMHO, it IS time for the cigarette machines to go. In England I once saw a
vending machine that dispensed beer and the ingredients for mixed drinks
(airplane bottles of gin and tonic, etc.). It was surrounded by kids
obviously under the legal drinking age who were popping in a handful of
pounds and pence for pints of bitter. I've seen similar groups of kids
surrounding cigarette machines in the States. Since most of the adults I know
buy their cigarettes by the carton, I don't think it will kill smoking to
eliminate the machines and limit minors' access to cigarettes. Beyond that
though, I offer my own Presidential Campaign slogan. . . Aslogan I feel
covers all areas of current American political debate, especially tobacco,
abortion and violent/sexy art/movies, etc:

	Lighten Up, America.

Smoke 'em,

<a name="24">Subject: Worst Smoke</a>

Hello, Steve,
  Worst smoke, eh?  Well, offhand, I can think of two, 1 cigar-related and
1 pipe-related.
  The cigar incident happened early last summer before I learned about the
joys of smoking premium, hand-rolled cigars.  I had picked up a few small
boxes of drug-store cigars, just to see if there was anything I liked.  One
of these was a small cigar that touted a "pipe aroma" made, as I recall, by
Muriel.  It was awful!  I don't know what the aroma was like, but after
just a few puffs, I threw it away in disgust.  Bad aftertaste too.
  The worst pipe-smoking experience I ever had was similar.  I like to
check out different blends/brands of tobacco, including store-bought blends
because one never knows when one will be trapped in a out-of-the-way place
and the only tobacco available is that sold at the local drug store or
supermarket.  So anyway, I bought a pouch of Apple tobacco.  Blecchh!
Awful stuff.  I smoked about half the pipe, decided it wasn't going to get
any better, emptied out the pipe, and threw the rest of the pouch away.
  Now, of course, one person's bad smoke is another person's joy of life
and someone must be smoking Apple because it's been around quite awhile.
But it certainly wasn't my cup of tee--or pipe of tobacco for that matter.
  No doubt, my worst experiences aren't all that bad compared to some.  But
there you have them for what they're worth.

Smoke Signal #17
?????@???.???.???

Unusual weather we have enjoyed here in Oklahoma, by the First of July it
is usually hot and oppressively humid. Last week we had some heavy rains
after which the wind swung from South to North, lowering the humidity,
giving us bright, sunny days with cooling breezes; today was one such.

Saturday is my day off when I run errands in the morning, a bustle of
driving hither and thither. Afternoon, I spent immersed in Barron's
newspaper amazed at the sorcery, attending the technical-trader's pursuit
of profit. Mid afternoon, I drove out to inspect, with a proprietorial
eye, my new investment, a position in sixty-three thousandths of a local
company. I have come to believe that we should take care of affairs in our
own backyard before we worry about events in faraway places, and agree
with the sentiments of the Irish essayist Hubert Butler, neatly expressed
in his essay "Beside the Nore" and summed up in his final paragraph.

"I have always believed that local history is more important than national
history.  There should be an archive in every village, where stories such
as the old man told me are recorded. Where life is fully and consciously
lived in our own neighbourhood, we are cushioned a little from the impact
of great far-off events which should be of only marginal concern to us." 

As for history, so with investing, I try to invest locally. But investment
cannot be done in isolation of national and international events,
particularly not with a business that depends on the strength of the
national and international economies. Hence Barron's and investing
locally, consistent with making some money. I'll be local so long as the
company's balance sheet continues to look strong and healthy. And the
company looked good too, on twelve acres in a no-frills part of town,
tucked away down a dead-end street behind a material reclamation plant.
There was no money being wasted on fancy office space.

Late afternoon, I took a nap and awoke, groggy, to greet Marcia home from
work. We were going to cook chicken over the barbecue in our back garden,
but decided instead to bake it in the oven. We turned on the oven to
preheat. To pull myself together, I brewed some tea and while so doing
couldn t understand why I was smelling garlic and other pizza smells that
became ever stronger, until I realized in alarm that the remains of the
pizza we ate last night was still in its cardboard box, parked in the
oven. With a cry of despair, I yanked open the door and pulled out the
scorched and smoking box, quickly taking it outside while the smoke-alarm
shrieked its warning. Now, I was wide-awake. A minute longer and I should
have needed the fire extinguisher. We shouldn t store things in or on the
cooker.

Too much excitement and smoke. We returned to our original plan, I lit the
barbecue and grilled and basted the chicken. Marcia steamed cob corn in a
little milk and water. It was well after seven o clock before we ate
tender chicken and the sweetest of corn, a most satisfying meal easiest to
prepare.

Summertime in Oklahoma is a time when I leave my pipes in their rack for
in the heat and humidity smoking has no pleasure for me. Marcia went
outside to enjoy her after-dinner cigarette. We slung the hammock between
the Pecan tree and the garage. Dusk was upon us by nine o clock. We lit
the citronella flare to repel the mosquitos. Marcia swung in the hammock
reading her book by the light of the garden lamp. The air was cool and
still. A thumbnail moon showed through the haze in the Western sky. A
perfect evening, cool enough for a smoke. I fetched my squat bulldog
briar, charged it with a plug of Rattray's Red Rapparee, and sat at the
garden table, under the umbrella, lit the tobaccos, tamped, relit, and
sat-back. In the stillness utter peace descended on our garden. Cicadas I
could hear in the distance and the mournful lowing of far-distant
locomotives. The city disappears with the wind. Peace under the trees of
our garden, flickering light from the dying embers of the barbecue,
shadows dancing from the citronella's flare, occasional scampering of
Alice, our cat; faint whirring of the June bugs, mesmerized by the light
from the kitchen they dashed themselves against the glass of our back
door; greenish white flashes from Lightening bugs signalling for mates
from the darker shadows beneath the trees. Noise of modern life gone, with
silence the Universe. Watching, listening, I tamped my pipe and slowly
puffed, watched the shadows flicker, observed a small spider let itself
down upon an invisible thread. These minutes, magical minutes, of living
fully and consciously. Slowly I puffed, savouring the aromatic smoke,
tamped the tobaccos to the bottom of my squat, fissured, and pitted briar.
And at the bottom I heard a faint rustling of leaves in the tops of the
trees, the citronella's flare jumped and jived, the North breeze did blow.
Police sirens wailed. It receded as quietly as it had come. North breeze
by East, and a few bars of "Take me out to the Ballpark" from the stadium
organ at Drillers' Field. Beep! Beep! Beep! I blew out the citronella and
went inside; the bread machine had completed its cycle and filled the
house with the smell of new-baked bread.

I finally watched the movie "Shadowlands" a couple of weeks ago.  It is about
C.S. Lewis (and was a real tearjerker, well, for my wife at least :)
Anyway, Lewis (played by Anthony Hopkins) has what appears to be a large
Dunhill (possibly an ODA), pear shaped bowl, straight stemmed briar.  I recall
only briefly glimpsing the Dunhill white dot on the stem in one scene, so I am
assuming it was a Dunhill (which is probably a pretty good bet for an

Go to:  <a href="http://rampages.onramp.net/~texfam/">http://rampages.onramp.net/~texfam/</a>

The way it works is as follows:

You, the merchant, send me pictures or a brochure of the product or
services you are selling.  I will post the pictures or broshure on the
internet, similar to what I am doing for the jewelry store.  When
customers enter your store from the home page that I have created, I
will get a message which I will send to you. You can have an order
form in your brochure from which customers can order your products
directly, or you can contact them by E-Mail, based on my referral, to
close a sale. You and I will work out an arrangement where I get paid
based either on a referral or actual sale basis. A simple method would
be something like a fixed dollar amount per referral or a small
percentage of the selling price. It's a win/win situation for both of
us because you get additional business from my adverising which you
would not have otherwise gotten and I get paid for the business I send
in your direction.  The whole world is the marketplace and most
everything can be done electronically. In addition to the above, I
will charge a small setup fee for creating the internet advertising,
normally not more than $100.  Thankyou for your inquiry and let me
know if this is workable for your situation.

<a name="31">Subject: Pipes Digest Submission</a>

Greetings!

   As a new subscriber to this fine publication, I wanted
both to introduce myself and suggest a shop for inclusion
in the Resource Guide.
   My name is Todd Pytel, I am eighteen and have been
smoking pipes for two years. My favorite pipes are
a beautiful Stanwell Rhodesian I bought used and a fairly
inexpensive meerschaum I recently purchased. I still
haven't settled on a "favorite" tobacco, but generally
tend towards English/Oriental blends. Does anybody know
anybody my age who smokes a pipe? I've read several 
remarks by people in their twenties commenting on the
looks they gather from passers-by but quite sure they're
nothing compared to the ones I've received.
   As for the Resource Guide, I'd like to suggest the 
Oakbrook Tobacco Company in the Oakbrook Center Shopping
Mall. Most of their cigars and pipe tobacco are blended
on the premises by the owner. Sadly, I haven't yet had
the chance to test the pipe tobacco, but the cigars are
excellent, priced at about $3.25 and outclassing many more
expensive ones. Besides their own, they carry a small 
selection of lesser known brands, but avoid the larger
makers. As I moved through the shop in a Christmas 
shopping rush last year, I only caught a brief glimpse of
their briar selection, but it seemed extensive and I'm sure
it will satisfy one's needs. Their real strength lies in 
their selection of carved meerschaums. There are probably
seventy or eighty pipes, most of them busts of famous 
personages, and all absolutely beautiful pieces. The 
collection belongs to the owner, and while they are for
sale, he doesn't really want to see them go. Thus, they 
are bit expensive (starting around $400). The shop also
carries a full selection of cigarettes, lighters, and
humidors. The shopping center is in a northwest suburb of
Chicago and is probably the best one in Chicagoland (if a
little pricey). The shop's address is...

Oak Brook Tobacco Company
at the Oak Brook Shopping Center
Oak Brook, IL  60521
(708) TOBACCO
     (862-2226)

                         Cheers!

website, and only now can appreciate the amount of work that goes
into keeping the digest going. Thanks again and again.
Smoking Sea Farer (see below) in a 20 year old Ice Age pipe. Some
stream of consciousness about recent visits to local and not so
local tobacconists.  Perhaps a bit too long, should all be
considered in light of my familiarity with New York City Stores
like Wilke, Barclay-Rex, Peterson's, Lane Limited, and others which
have passed on, I admit to being spoiled.
     I was in Las Vegas in June. Don Pablo's had rollers working
when I was there.  The cigars, compared to brands like Macanudo,
Uppman, Punch and others seemed overpriced. I may be prejudiced, I
am used to Chicago Smoke Shop and J&amp;R pricing.  They had few pipes
and a few expensive bulk tobaccos.  The walk in Humidor seemed to
be for show, there were a few boxes of cigars, with a Liquor (Rum?)
cured cigar for $7.75, approximately the size of a Punch Pita 
(Short Churchill) showcased. Store was cluttered. I was
unimpressed. There is a store in the same strip mall carrying hand
made knives.
     Ed's shop, was much more spacious, with a large selection of
new and estate pipes, I found a very nice, dainty Kriswell and a
large Butz Choquin Fait Main in a calabash shape, both nice estate
briars. The store had many accessories, lighters on sale, and both
packaged and loose pipe tobacco. Walk in cigar humidor, but I was
only interested in pipes at the time.  They do mail order,
but use a catalog that is distributor published, the same one
Fader's in the Washington area uses. Bulk tobacco was a bit moist,
but some did appear to be house blends. Purchased Edward's 515,
English Flake and Sea Farer, moderate Latakia ribbon cut.
Visit highly recommended.
     Mr. Bill's is very near the University and is more of a head
shop than tobacconist. About 35 pipes on the wall in various price
ranges, with about 16-20 loose pipe tobacco's in interesting
flavors. This is a chain and has 4 locations.  They do mail order
and the tobaccos were well priced.  I bought Nougat, Baklava and
Mango but they were much to wet to smoke, as soon as they dry out
I will try them.
     I recently took a ride to Lahaska, PA, note the large outdoor
antique market has been replaced by an outlet mall, and decided to
go on to Philly. The J&amp;R store, on Samsoun near 16th is worth a
visit. The prices are not as good as I would have expected, but
they do have some antique smoking items for sale.  Also the only
place I have seen large Diamond strike anywhere matches in a long
time. No question about the loose tobacco; a sign above the jars
says that they come from the two largest distributor's.  Seemed
pricier than the J&amp;R in Fairfield  NJ.  Store is a bit crowded.  I
only got a chance to glance at Holt's new store, around the corner,
they close early on Saturdays and Sundays, about 3pm, many, many,
many upscale pens. Nice to look at (I collect antique fountain
pens) unexpected in a tobacco shop. In fact the pens are in the
front of the store, with the cigars and other items in a separate
room to the back. 
     I also visited John David, Ltd. at the Menlo Park Mall, Route
1, on the way back.  Good selection of pipes and tobaccos, I think
they are distributor blends, but were in smokable condition.  There
were a good supply of different lighters, including my favorite,
the Big Boy by Corona at very good prices.  However store appears
to be moving into the gift line in a big way.  They did have a
smoking room in the back of the store with two couches. 
     A small tobacco store in Verona. Sounds like Broadway title.
Thee Tobacco on Bloomfield Avenue. Hours may be limited during the
summer. What looks like a selection of older (new) Stanwell and
other Danish pipes at good prices, accessories, fair selection of
cigars and tobaccos which are probably distributor blends,
(flavored chewing tobacco in bulk??) and last but not least, two
boxed briar churchwardens in a display case (Peterson's I think but
I do have CRS on occasion), last time I was there. No newspapers or
gift items. Proprietor is friendly, was explaining difference
between Maduro, Claro, Natural and EMS wrappers to a woman buying
gift cigars.           
     J&amp;R has a tobacco list (4 Page) which attempts to describe a
large number of commercial pipe tobaccos by content.  If anyone
calls them, be sure to ask for it.      
     I just got a really nice catalog from Finck Cigar Company
(successor's to Wally Frank). They not only have generic cigars,
but also generic tobaccos.  Prices seem good for what you are
getting.  Wally Frank used to have a blend called Yenidje Delight.
Very flavorful, mild English. Finck has Balkan Sobranie copy and
Istanbul which I remeber as being very good, way back when.     
     One last thing for now. I came across a few cans and pouches
of some very old tobaccos.  Some sealed cans, some open. Included
Brindley's navy cut, Exmoor Hunt, St. James, Gold Cube, Murray's
Reserve, some Clarke's blends, Corn Cob, Taconis, and some other
discontinued brands. They are all at least 10 years old, and I am
re-hydrating some of them with Rum.  They are in pretty good shape. 
Will send list next time if there is interest in having them
copied.

Hi Steve and others,

I must sadly say in this letter to the PD that my shop is not faring the
trying economic times of Bangor, Maine.  We have a handful of regular
customers, some of them from the Digest here, however a handful of customers
will not pay my mortgage or put food on the table.  All is not lost, however,
because I am going to be using my connections and accounts to try my hand at
mail order...see how that does...more as a hobby now than anything else...  I
have however picked up a passtime that I love and will cherish for the rest
of my life...the smoking of a pipe and organizing my thoughts.  I forsee many
years upcoming of sampling, puffing, and enjoying.
I am clearing everything out at cost (for those locals who have an interest
in stopping by) up to the 12th of August or untill it is all gone.  It
saddens me deeply to let this all go...however I am somewhat comforted in the
fact that most businesses fail in first year, and the failure rate for first
time business people is far greater than that.  I have learned, and I have
grown...now it is time to move on.  I will stay in touch through PD, reading
and enjoying everyone's adventures and misadventures...See y'all 'round...

Steve,
Please note my new address: ????.????@??.??????????.???.
I have thoroughly enjoyed the digest.  Also, what do you think of asking folks
to sample a particular tobak (say 10 to 20 people) and submit their opinion to
PD?  One a month maybe??? 
Take care --Jeof Bean

[ Sounds like a good idea! I'll do that next month (and the first
issue every month), and am open to suggestions as to what to
sample. Cigar suggestions welcome too!  -S. ]

Steve:

I promised to keep every one informed about the upcoming CORPS Show on
Columbus Day weekend. Attached to this note is the "text only" version
of the show flyer.  I hope you will be able to enclose it in the PIPE
DIGEST.

If you have any problems with the text file, I can send a "WORD" file
or paste it in my communication.  This is a first on my part: sending
an attached file via Internet.

[ Never got it, Vej! But perhaps the interested parties will contact
you directly. -S. ]

<a name="41">Subject:       Intro, seeking tobacco</a>

	Hello Steve, smokers, &amp;c. After reciving two issues of PD, I wanted 
drop a note thanking you for such a fine publication. :) As for 
myself, I've been puffing for about fifteen years, and have recently 
landed a job at a small, nationally known, tobacco shop - here in 
Chicago. Thus, I'm a junior tobacconist third-class , at this point :)
	Here's my question: I'm looking for uncut Latakita, Perique, and 
Turkish tobaccos. I've been experimenting with different blending 
techniques, but as most of what we get at our shop is pre-blended I 
haven't been able to get quite the blend I want.

	Pipe note: Picked up a Ser Jacopo bent bulldog this week - smokes 
beautifully. Hand tooled fininsh helps to disperse heat, creating a 
nice cool smoke.	
	Cigar note: Had a Juan Clemete rothchild yesterday - very nice, 
heavily bodied smoke. Overall impressions include a deep oaken, winey 
flavor; good smooth burn with a nice white ash.

						Thanks

<a name="42">Subject: transporting pipes</a>

Steve- recently someone inquired on the usenet pipes group about a good 
way to transport pipes while travelling.  I am responding to him 
personally, but thought I would mention this here too.  While in my 
hometown this summer, I visited the gigantic retail outleft of Cabelas 
sporting goods.  They sell primarily by mail order, and all over the 
world.  Anyway, while there I spotted several sizes of rectangular hard 
plastic cases that are used to store handguns.  These are very tough, 
have an unexposed built in handle, and most important, have very thick 
foam rubber on the inside that forms itself to fit the object (pistol or 
whatever) one places therein.  The size I got was the smallest (it was 
only about 5 bucks!) but still large enough to hold 5 or 6 large pipes 
comfortably.  Once you close one of these babies up, there is NO WAY 
anything is going to shake around inside.  A couple of the larger sizes 
could probably hold a dozen pipes or more.  I don't have one of Cabelas' 
current catalogs, but assume these are available by mail order.  I for 
one and totally sold on this product.

[ Sounds like a GREAT way to discourage the antis, too!  Or use a
violin case... :-) -S. ]

[ADMIN] Due to a very heavy schedule and the untimely demise of my
Dell's hard drive, I'm having to write this on my lunch break rather
than from home (with briar in hand.) So, in the interest of getting an
issue out at all, I'm going to exclude the usual commentary.
Hopefully, by next time we'll have Linux back up and purring, and a
valued new acquisition from NML up and puffing...

     Steve:
     
     Thank you for the fine job in editing the digest.  It is a quality 
     list.
     
     I want to suggest a Twin Cities addition to the resource list.  
     
     Jonathon Robert Fielding &amp; Company, Inc.
     1747 Lexington Avenue
     Roseville, MN  55113
     612-489-7504
     
     They have an excellent stock of pipes, tobacco, cigars and 
     accessories.  
     
     The pipe selection runs from inexpensive "first pipes" to quality 
     estate pipes.  They have many pipe tobacco blends.  (I would highly 
     recommend Christa's Own and English Aromatic.)
     
     I bought my first pipe there 5 years ago.  The proprietor was 
     extremely patient in teaching me the ins and outs of pipe 
     appreciation. He also reshaped my cigar choices by steering me toward 
     a few new brands that were more compatible with my tastes.
     
     The atmosphere is always welcoming and friendly.  If you bring your 
     pipe, ask them for the complimentary pipe stem buffing. You can sample 
     any tobacco in stock.  If I am curious about something new, they have 
     always been kind enough to give a free 1oz. sample of any number of 
     blends that I would like to try at home. 
     
     If I have given more information than was needed, I apologize.  But, a 
     quality business with fantastic service is a rarity these days.  When 
     I discover such a business, I like to contribute to the "word of 
     mouth."
     
     Warm Regards.

Hey Steve, hey pipe-smokers--

I can't remember this being addressed here, so I'll bring it up: Any hookah
smokers? I am the proud if somewhat ambivalent owner of a lovely "4-seater"
and could use some hints on how and what to smoke. I would love to outrage
the neighbors one of these lovely Oregon nights by puffing away
Caterpillar-like.

<a name="4">Subject: Re: Worst Smoke</a>

This is not a personal experience, but was told to me by my grandfather about
his first smoke. He was about 10 at the time, so that makes it about 1912.

My grandfather's uncle smoked a pipe that he kept filled with clippings he
purchased from a cigar factory in nearby Goodland, Kansas. (I can only
imagine the quality of the cigars.) It was said that you could smell him
coming quite a while before you could see him.

Grandpa and a cousin decided they wanted to try a smoke, so the took the can
of cigar clippings that the uncle kept at their farm and headed for the
pasture to give it a try. Not having a pipe, they rolled "cigarettes" using
pieces of newspaper. 

To say that they turned green would probably be an understatement. Someone
else had to go get the cows that night.

BTW, for a more enjoyable smoke, I like "30th Anniversery" from Fred Diebel
in Kansas City, MO. Haven't found anything I like better.

Enjoy--

Bob

Thank you kind sir!!
I have informed some people on Prodigy and Apples' eWorld of the tobacco
forum.  Hopefully you will get some response from those networks as well.  I
heard a rumor that Rep. Henry Waxman from California is a cigar smoker in
private life and behind close doors.  Interesting rumor if it is true.
Have you thought about IRC (internet relay chat) for a tobacco chat room?

<a name="7">Subject: Pipe Digest </a>

Dear Steve,

One of the members of our pipe club in Richmond,  The CORPS  ( Conclave of
Richmond Pipe Smokers ),  brought copies of Your Pipe Digest to one of our
meetings. I found them interesting, informative, and enjoyable.  If it is
possible, I would like very much to have my name added to your list.

I am John Eells, and my hobby for the last thirty years or so has been
smoking pipes.  Collecting, restoring/repairing, carving, and yes, smoking
pipes have brought me a good
deal of pleasure.

I first became interested in pipes as a young man in Charlottesville, VA
where I spent many pleasent hours in conversation with Mr. Robert Mincer, in
the pipe shop he founded on main street across from the Campus of The
University of Virginia. Mr.Mincer was a master craftsman and as is not
commonly known, the brother of Tracy Mincer who founded the Custombuilt Pipe,
the name which was later purchased by Rogers.
It was then that I purchased my first good pipe; a small Comoy Tradition full
bent.

After a few years in the Army, I returned to Ch'ville and while attending
UVa., I went to work for Mr. Mincer part time to help meet expences. It was
during this time that I received my training from him in the art of making
and repairing smoking pipes.  And this is where I began to establish a modest
collection of smoking pipes.  As well as being able to purchase at a store
discount,  I suppose as a quality control measure, Mr. Mincer allowed me to
purchase any unclaimed pipes for the cost of the repairs. That was the
beginning for me.  I was hooked on collecting.

<a name="8">Subject: Need value of tobacco box (also for sale)</a>

I have an old wooden tobacco box I'd like to find the value of
and sell.
I volunteer at a private elementary school library, where this
box has been residing as a decoration (who knows how it got
there). I'd like to sell it for its highest value so that I can
buy more books for the library.

I've taken it to a local antique dealer, who said he knew nothing
about the value of tobacco collectibles, but that he'd probably
price it at $50 (high end), just on its appeal as an old box.

If you can tell me what it might be worth, I'd appreciate it.  If
you'd like to buy it, let me know.

Here's a description:

Wooden Tobacco Box With Hinged Lid

Size: 12 5/8 x 3 7/8 x 2 inches

WOOD: Unknown

FINISH: quite dark stain (?), but wood grain is visible. Lid is
finished inside and out. Box is finished only on the outside.
The lid has an old printed picture glued inside. Caption is
"Builders of a Better Boyhood" and shows a line of schoolboys
standing at attention in school uniforms. The picture has been
scribbled on by pencil (one mark says Oct 5 192?), and there are
pencil marks on the inside lid wood.

CONSTRUCTION: Corners are joined by a flat tenon and mortise (not
dovetail). Bottom appears to be glued in. No lining.

The lid is hinged in the back with curious wire hinges. Two metal
wire loops protrude from the front edge of the lid, and there are
small holes in the wood below them, evidently for other metal
pieces that allowed the box to be fastened shut.

CONDITION: Aged box. No cracks in wood. In a couple places, the
finish has chipped, leaving a lighter-colored area.

On the bottom, in a kind of reverse embossing it reads:

JOHN FINZER &amp; BROS.,
THE AMERICAN TOBACCO COMPANY
INCORPORATED. SUCCESSOR.
LOUISVILLE, KY.
REGISTERED FACTORY NO. 27.
5TH DIST., STATE OF KENTUCKY
____________________________
NOTICE - THE MANUFACTURER OF THIS
TOBACCO HAS COMPLIED WITH ALL
REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW.
EVERY PERSON IS CAUTIONED UNDER
THE PENALTY OF THE LAW NOT TO USE
THIS PACKAGE FOR TOBACCO AGAIN.

To the right of this message is:

7/8
2

On the back of the box is:

THIS BOX CONTAINS
6 PLUGS

3 x 12 - 5 1/3 Oz.
8 SPACE

Can send photos if desired.

I thank you very kindly for whatever advice you can give as to
how to best sell this box at its maximum value.

I'm not a Dunhill expert, but I am a fan of C. S. Lewis who owns a copy of 
"Shadowlands," as well as a VCR with a "pause" feature &lt;g&gt;.
   
You did, in fact, see a white spot on the stem of the pipe in question.
I don't know the shape number of the pipe, but I did note it has an oval
shank.  The bowl does appear to be of group 5 or larger.  The pipe appears 
to be a "bruyere," but it could be a well-smoked "root."  The spot itself 
is of the later, larger variety.
   
If anyone out there would like to give Matt some additional help, the
pipe in question is featured in a scene early in the film where Lewis
(Hopkins) is delivering a lecture to his students.

Smoke Signal #18
?????@???.???.???

Pipes Digest #197 started a few random thoughts. My worst smoke was
when I was ten or eleven, maybe younger. Anyway, we had moved from the
Big Smoke of London town to the seaside bliss of Hayling Island, a
wonderful place for children on the South coast of England. Some
neighbourhood kids and I were gathered in our empty garage where we had
a swing lashed to the rafters. Who knows how this kind of thing gets
started, but it did and we took to smoking hand-rolled blotting paper
that we could buy at the local newsagent's for a penny a sheet. Pink
paper was the thing although I don't remember having any choice,
perhaps that was all Clapp's Newsagency had for sale. He must have
wondered at the sudden rush on blotting paper by the neighbourhood
children. I can recall the flavour quite easily today it was . . .
well, like blotting paper.

We saw the movie "Smoke." It was good. I liked it, a movie about
people, local people, and how these people reached out to touch the
lives of each other to good effect. If you can imagine the circles of a
Venn diagram then the cigar store was the central circle and the lives
of its owner and patrons were the other circles intersecting the
centre. I will venture the opinion that this is the first movie
produced in America by American hands that treats people both black and
white as human beings on the same scale. "Smoke" portrayed Tolerance
and Humanity, and although there was a measure of violence the
producers exercised restraint, choosing to intimate rather than to
assault us with a gratuitously graphic portrayal, I recommend it to
you.

There was some mention of Kessler and others of his stripe, with their
grubby paws on the levers of power. As you may have realised, I am a
devotee of the essay. E. M. Cioran is a Rumanian, born in Rasinari in
1911. He moved to Paris in 1937 and wrote in French, exclusively, as an
essayist, as a critic, and as the author of two novels. His book of
philosophical essays "The Fall into Time" was well translated by
Richard Howard and published in this country by Quadrangle books. What
Cioran says in his essay "The Tree of Life" struck me as singularly
descriptive and appropriate when applied to bureaucrats and
politicians:

"It is never the strong, it is the weak who crave and who gain power,
by the combined effect of cunning and madness."

                             E. M. Cioran,
                             "The Tree of Life."

<a name="12">Subject: My Introduction</a>

Dear Steve,
     This is the first time I've had the time to write an introduction.  I
have been a subscriber for only 2 weeks, but so far have thoroughly enjoyed
PD.  Speaking of young people, I am a 26 YO pharmacist.  I have been smoking
cigars for only 8 months, but I'm hooked.  Hooked meaning I enjoy the flavor
and aroma of a fine cigar as well as the relaxation it brings me.  As I write
I am enjoying an El Rey Del Mundo Robusto Largo and a fine mug of Chipinge
coffee from Zimbabwe.  I am an ex-cigarrette smoker.  I quit that digusting
habit over a year ago in favor of exercising.  While on a vacation to
San-Diego in December, my friends and I took a day trip to Mexico where I
enjoyed my first Cuban cigars.  I purchased several Montecristos, a few
Upmanns and a Cohiba, all of which I thoroughly enjoyed.  That is what got me
started.  I now have a collection of over 300 cigars.  My father and I are
building a king-sized humidor to store my collection.  It will be made of
Honduran Mahogany and Spanish cedar of course.  I bought an Ambient humidor
from Daniel Marshall several months ago but it just isn't big enough anymore.
It is an excellent humidor and I will always use it, I just need another.    
     As far as bad smokes go, the only one I ever had was a JR Ultimate that
my mother's boss gave her to give to me.  It was tighter than a frog's a**,
and dried out.  It obviously had not been stored correctly.  I only smoked
about one-half inch of that awful thing.  I have since had some Ultimates
that were very good.
     I can't say that there is any one type of cigar that I won't smoke or
don't like.  They all have their own separate palate pleasing aspects.  When
I first started smoking I turned my nose up at full bodied smokes but now
enjoy them as well as lighter smokes.  Some of my favorites are Dunhill
Peravias, Fuente Cuban Coronas, Chateau Fuentes, and Hemingways, Upmann
Lonsdale, Don Thmas Special Selection and Toros and Cohiba Robustos.
     I would really like to try some pipe smoking but don't know where to
begin.  I understand that the pipe itself can add or detract from the flavor
of the smoke.  Some advice about a good beginners pipe would be appreciated.
     Thanks very much for PD keep up the good work.
Rob.

<a name="14">Subject: Visit to Sparta Industries</a>

Took a busman's holiday last Wednesday and hauled the family (bride
and 2 granddaughters) up into the mountains to Sparta Industries,
Sparta, NC, about 2 hours away.  Had a delightful visit with and tour
by Doug Allen, president.

In addition to the Dr. Grabow pipes (over 1,000,000 a year), they make
Mastercraft and Alpha pipes and handle Pipa Croci, Ardor and other
*fine* pieces.  I have had the pleasure of observing individual pipe
carvers, but I had never seen a production line.  Fascinating!  Some
operations are automated, but most are by hand.  In all cases, the
skill and eye of the individual is the key.

Pallet after pallet of briar sacks fill a vast area as they age. Lines
of machines with skilled craftsmen carving bowls and
shanks. Inspectors checking for cracks, sand holes and, very
important, grain. They inspect the wood dry and then wet it to get a
good look at the grain. The best, naturally, are saved for special
finishing.  Another line of operators drilling airholes in the shanks
(10/64 " for those who care) and another forming bits.  Then the pipes
and the bits are "married" and fitted. At this point each pipe is
unique, so that when it comes to adding laquer, the stems and bowls
have to be kept in the right order so they can be matched again. Not
an easy task with a million pipes. One careless moment and there's
chaos!

Why the mountains of North Carolina for a pipe factory? The company
was founded in 1941 and Mediterranian briar was unobtainable. However,
the mountain laurel of the region has a root very similar to briar but
heavier, more dense. Therefore, many of their pipes made during WWII
are not briar, but laurel. Saw a couple of them and you couldn't tell
the difference except a slight bit more weight. Grain was very similar
and finish the same as briar.  So, any of youse guys what has an old
Dr. Grabow made in the early forties may really have a "laurel" not a
"briar."

Whatever, the trip was really wothwhile. Saw some excellent Italian
pipes that I drooled over, but I left the moths in my purse, darn it.
Anybody headed into NC mountains -- Sparta isn't far west of I77 and
just below the VA border, -- ought to take time for a visit. It's an
eyeopener and the mountain location is spectacular.  Suggest you call
ahead and make arrangements with Dan Finney, VP Marketing, or Doug
Allen. Tel # is 919-372-5521.  Best,

Craig

Re: Worst Smoke

As a 23 year old Air Force Officer stationed in Nashville, Tenn, I was single
at that time.  When I found out that a young lady I was seeing came from a
farm that grew tobacco, it was love at first sight.  

During a trip home to meet the family, her father took me to his drying shed,
grabbed a handful of tobacco leaves, rolled them into a cigar, and offered me
a Tennessee smoke.  

I immediately decided that I would seek a Cuban girlfriend.

Steve -- Thank you so much for your labor of love in providing PD for those
of us who enjoy pipes and tobacco as more than just a habitual method of
smoking. When I began smoking pipes and visiting tobacco shops in the early
1970's, our pasttime was quite a respectable endeavor. The mythology
surrounding the invention of second-hand smoke had not become a part of our
culture's perceived reality. Quality, aged briar was abundant. Oh, for the
good old days. I always hated it when the old-timers said that; now
listen to me.

Alas, this media and particularly PD has become my primary method of
sharing this hobby with others so amorously involved in pipe-smoking. Even
though we can't gather around the pipe-bar at the local tobacconist's and
discuss pipes and whatever is on our minds, we can light up our favorite
mixture, listen with our eyes, speak with our fingers, and enjoy each other
and our contributions across the miles. This has been an inspiration for me
and I would conjecture that it has had the same effect on other
"old-timers."

A long-time Edwards Pipe Shop customer, I have been looking to purchase an
Edwards pipe, a shape discontinued many years ago. It was called the
Commodore, an oversized pipe with a flat bottom. If any of your readers
have one of these they would like to sell, I would invite them to get in
touch with me via e-mail.

Thanks for all  your efforts. They are appreciated.

local Tinder Box employee who immediatly told me to buy a cheap one to make
sure I was going to enjoy smoking a pipe.

He recommended a $4 "corn cob"  pipe.  He said they actually provide a
relatively good smoke because they are so porous.  He said the reason they
are so cheap is because they "burn out" so fast.  He advised that some people
actually use these cheap pipes as thier pipe of choice.

What do you think?

Any advice as to what type of tobacco to start with?

Is there any publication, book, etc that tells the ins and outs of pipe
smoking on a "how to" level?

Any other suggestions about the excessories of the pipe smoker?

Thak you for your assistance.

?????@?????????.???????.??? which bouces my mail to address you see at the
header now that I've gotten my feet wet on this Internet thing...anyway. I
really enjoy reading allthe posts from pipe and cigar smokers around the
world. I'm kind of the odd man out in my circle of friends . I don't really
"hang out" with anyone who currently enjoys a good pipe.
    I'm a 32y old ,married with two great Sons(Paul 6 and Neil 3 1/2). I'm
employed as a Suburban Cleveland Police Officer (9yrs) and I've just
recently discovered the wonderful world of computing with a MAC LC II.
Kinda outdated but it suits my needs.
    As I said ,I don't have any friends who smoke a pipe,my Father did
years ago but he's since become an anti smoking nazi type so he was no
help. My Grandfather(rip) passed before I began smoking anything. He always
smoked Amphora in a brown pack. He also used one Dr. Grabow for bout 6
weeks and threw it out for a new one. I waited until I was married and had
a Son to start smoking a pipe because I thought you had to be older to
smoke one. I figured the afore mentioned qualified me as older. Went to the
local drugstore,purchased a pipe some tobacco(Amphora brown,what else) and
proceeded to burn the bejeezus out of my tongue on a regular basis! I did
this for about  a year before I even knew you could buy pipes and tobak and
a store specializing in such things. While learning to use my local
librarys' new computer card catalog,I punched in the subject Pipes.
Well,there they were,people had written books on the subject!
I was now on my way with a copy of "Pipes and Tobacco" by Carl Ethwa(sp) as well
as Rick Hackers first book. I since have read what I believe to be every
available book on pipes and my tongue loves me for it. I got all the back
issues of "The Compleat Smoker" from Theodore Gage,really a shame that
publication went under. I received  a bunch of photos of pipes from a guy
named Barry Levin, it seemed like a great way to get a nice,high quality
pipe at a price I could afford. Unfortunatly,by the time I poured over the
photos,every pipe I picked out was sold. I think after my third or fourth
mailing I was sucsessful. I'm smoking a Comoy tradition pot style filled
with Sofisticate I purchased from Barry as I bang this out.
    My tobbaco tastes are heavily influeced by the Personal Reserve
series,my favorite being Bombay Extra. I had several interesting
conversations with Barry over next the eighteen months with him,his passing
was terribly sad.
    I discovered the Internet Pipes Digest by way of The A&amp;M Gazette, I
reaaly enjoy the fiction it. I also faithfully watch Sherlock Holmes
Mysteries on A&amp;E.
     Well,that's me in a nutshell. Looking forward to future issues of
PD,hope I did,nt bore too many. Smoke'em while you can.

<a name="27">Subject: PD</a>

It is about time to introduce my self. I am a university Professor who has 
been smoking and collecting pipes for over 30 years. I have a collection of 
over a hudered pipes from almost every maker. My prefered ones are the 
Ferndowns, Beckers, Mastro de Paja, old Barlings and pre-1970 Dunhills. I 
occasionally smoke cigars (mostly cuban and Davidoffs).The types of tobacco 
or cigars I smoke varies a lot depending on the mood, time of the day, and 
the meal and/or drink I have. My other hobbies are collecting westren and 
native american art as well as old silver. Needless to say I have been 
enjoying reading the PD for few weeks now and would appreciate very much if 
is possibleto  e-mail me PD issues prior to PD #194, . I would like also to 
add my tobbaconist here in Birmingham  to your list.

          The Briary
          741B Brookwood Village
          Birmingham, AL 35209
          205-871-2839

The owner's name is Skip Elliot and he is a real gentleman and very 
helpfull. Skip is quite experienced about Pipes and tobbacos, and carries a 
very good selection of pipes (Dunhill, Ser Jacapo, Mastro de Baja, Ashton, 
Upshall, Caminitto, etc), and bulk pipe tobacco (house blends, Lane, 
Dunhill, McBaren, etc.). In addition, Skip has a nice cigar humidor and does 
mail order and pipe repairs.  If you ever are in Birmingham visit him and I 
am certain you will enjoy the place.

     I would also like to add the name of Julius Vesz, a superb canadian 
pipe maker, to the list. I visted Julius in his place in the Lobby of the 
Royal York Hotel while in Toronto a couple of months ago  and saw his work. 
Superb to say the least. His pipes ranges from 65$C to 10,000$C for work of 
art pieces. His sliver and gold bands, with or without precious stones, are 
exquisite. He is an artist whose grand father was a pipe maker for the 
Austro-Hungarian court. I have seen some of his grand father pieces. They 
belong to a museum. In fact he has a room in the back of his shop where he 
displays these fantastic pipes as well as some of his own as well as variuos 
smoking articles. The room has an Austrian ambience where one can smoke 
peacfully, drink home made strong coffee, and discuss different topics, form 
pipe making to politics, with Julius. His place is a must for any pipe 
collector who is visiting Toronto. I quite enjoyed him and his place. Here 
is his address:

          Julius Vesz
          Pipesmith
          Royal York Hotel
          100 Front Street West
          Toronto, Ontario
          Canada M5J 1E3
          416-362-0581

     Finally, it would be repeatative to state that I really enjoy the PD 
and I thank you for your time to organize this endevour.

<a name="29">Subject: Upside Down Pipe</a>

Dear Steve:
I wonder if the Digest group can help me solve the mystery of the upside down
pipe.
A friend of mine invented and patented a revolutionary smoking pipe that
lights from the bottom.   A major manufacturer saw the promise and bought the
idea 15 years ago, but it never took off.  My friend got the patent back a
few years ago and we've developed a new rock maple version that we call The
Freedom Smoking Pipe. 
It smokes cool and easy.  A stainless steel screen holds the tobacco and ash
in place - nothing falls out.  No moisture or resin accumulate in the bowl.
 A cork and leather top makes it wind and rain proof.
We had initial success wholsesaling through a well-known distributor.  We
were in about 100 tobacco shops nationwide, and appeared in the Levin
catalog.  Response from our early customers was strong - most loved it, some
hated it.  Then interest dropped off and left us wondering what happened.
We'd be grateful to hear from readers:  Have you heard about The Freedom
Smoking Pipe?  Have you tried it?
Thanks for your help.

Hello Steve,

I would like to be added to the list of your digest's recipients.

I have smoked a pipe on and off for about 6 years and am now getting
interested in cigars.  Being such a newbie I am interested in all
information related to the long weed.

One question I had that I would send to the list is:  what are some
brands of Cuban cigars that would be good for a beginner cigar smoker
and are also not very expensive (within reason)?

        Steve, I have been reading the back issues on the web, it's great
to see how large the group has grown over the years.  Since there are so
many new members I would like to reiterate a few items for the newer
readers.  I am still in search of a Porsche Pipe, if anyone has one to sell
or trade or knows of the whereabouts of one I would appreciate some
information. Naturally I dream of finding one on a table at a flea Market
for five dollars...right next to the shoebox full of Dunhills that the guy
says "take the whole box for twenty bucks"...well a guy can dream can't he.
I am also looking for some Amphora Cesare Borgia which I believe has been
discontinued, if anyone has any to sell or can supply a source I would
appreciate and hopefully reciprocate.
If anyone is interested in trading or selling estate pipes I am interested
in mainly English Pipes in the $20 to $100.00 dollar range. Finally if
there are any Kaywoodie collectors out there I recommend you contact Fred
Loveland at 2605 Albury Ave, Deltona Florida 32138.  He is a knowledgeable

Dear Steve,

Thanks very much for entering my subscription to Pipe Digest. The 
directories you attached were also welcome. I saw some names in
the shops/mail order category which I haven't seen in ages, and I'll 
certainly be contacting several.

I've been a cigarette smoker for more years than I care to admit, but 
started with a pipe and still occasionally puff on a briar. My quest 
(unsuccessful thus far, alas) has been for a pipe tobacco so 
absolutely nonpareil that it will get me off the gaspers and back to a 
pipe exclusively. I may find the answer here in cyberspace in the 
pages of Pipe Digest.

Worst Smoke: Back in the early 1970's there was a commercial pipe 
mixture called GT. I think it was flavored with essence of bubble 
gum. Gawdawful stuff!

Looking forward to more of Pipe Digest.

Cheers,

problem is that he is one person, so he can't make enough pipes to satisfy
would-be wholesale customers (like Sherlock's Haven, which nevertheless

wonderful repairs as quickly as we non-rural, neurotic types would like.
 (His other problem is that he works too cheaply, but don't tell him

<a name="35">Subject: Teen smoke screen</a>

Steve,
I agree with your basic sentiments.  Here are my thoughts.
I'm afraid I could not disagree more strongly with the President's 
policy on teen smoking.  Most states already have put into place 
different methods of discouraging the sale of cigarettes to minors.  The 
Wall Street Journal had a full-page article in Tuesday's (I think) issue 
dealing with what state enforcement techniques work and which do not.  
None of those which work have anything to do with the President's 
executive order.

The restrictions the President has ordered fall into two catagories:  
repeating things that states already do (every state prohibits the sale 
of tobacco to minors), or gross violations of the First and Tenth 
Amendments.

Of course, the latter alarm me greatly.  To force someone to create ads 
(to force someone to say something they do no believe), as the 
President's orders do is not just a violation of the First Amendment, 
but is basically confiscation of property (the funds needed to generate 
the ads) without the consent of Congress, and thus violates Article One, 
Section Eight of the Constitution, as well as the Fifth Amendment 
(taking of property without due process of law).

The limitation of print media ads to text is also an obvious violation 
of the First Amendment.  However, courts have upheld limitations on 
commercial speech in the past (in some states, it is illegal to quote 
Bible passages to sell wine, for example).  Still, this is a clear 
violation of the principle of the First Amendment.  Again, tobacco 
companies don't generally advertise in comic books anyway.  We are 
supposed to be comforted by the news that the First Amendment will be 
abrogated only in those periodicals whose minor readership is more than 
15%.  Left out of this "comforting" provision is any clarification of 
who determines the "readership" demographics?  Obviously, this 
regulation will lead to magazines and newspapersl scrutinized by the 
government to see when the demographics of the periodical changes so the 
regulations switch on or off.  Also, is "readership" defined as 
subscriptions going to households with teenagers, even if the minors do 
not read the periodical?  How can readership of street sales be measured 
in an accurate enough way?  The protection of speech is too important to 
limit, especially in any way that gives discretion to bureaucrats.

The argument might be made that speech has already been limited in the 
case of tobacco advertising, since television ads are not allowed.  
However, this is not as clear-cut a First Amendment issue, since the FCC 
regulates television and radio on the principle that the 
electromagnetic-radio spectrum belongs to the public, and thus is in the 
domain of government control.  No such argument can be made about print 
media.

Billboards are a free-speech issue also, but certainly their placement 
is a local, not a Federal issue.  Being a local issue, the President's 
usurption of authority is a violation of the Tenth Amendment (as the 
Supreme Court has already found in a similarly worded law involving gun 
rules).

All I see in the Presidents Executive Orders are
1. The usurping of power to the Executive that belongs to Congress (the 
ability to tax), and thus a ignorance of Article One.

2. The abrogation of First Amendment rights.

3. The taking of property without due process (the requirement that 
tobacco companies pay for ads to discourage smoking).

4. The usurping of control of local issues, such as the location of 
cigarette vending machines and billboards, by the Executive branch of 
the Federal government, and thus a violation of the Tenth Amendment 
(unless you are prepared to make the case that billboards and vending 
machines pose a threat to interstate commerce).

5. The expression of the President's view that the paternalistic 
government must raise people's children for them.  Teaching children not 
to smoke and preventing them form doing so is ultimately the job of 
parents.  Even if you believe the parents are not doing a good job, 
there are other ways of dealing with the problem.  We know how poorly 
Federal government regulations with regard to gangs, drugs and guns have 
worked at keeping teenagers away from these dangers.  The cost of these 
rules, in terms of the lost freedoms of non-teenagers, is far to great, 
and the chance of significant success is far too small to back such 
Draconian action.

The government is willing to take away your rights by appealing to your 
concern for children.  Don't worry about the camel's nose coming under 
the tent;  the camel is in your tent, defecating on your shoes!

<a name="36">Subject: SMOKE Magazine</a>

Dear Steve:

Here's the word on a new cigar &amp; pipe magazine that will debut in December,
1995. It's a big (first issue over 100 pages), full-color glossy and will be
available at tobacco shops or on the newsstand. It'll have a lot more flair
and a lot more fun than you know who!

\smok\ n: a fun, contemporary magazine geared to the up-and-coming executive
from the ages of 25-38 who are interested in cigars and the lifestyle
surrounding them.

Lockwood Trade Journal is proud to announce the introduction of its newest
magazine SMOKE, which continues over a century-long history of publishing,
and is the final piece of Lockwood's tobacco-related trilogy. With magazines
currently covering the manufacturing and retail side of the tobacco industry,
SMOKE will appeal directly to the consumer. 

SMOKE is a lifestyle-orientated magazine, emphasizing cigars, pipes, and
life's other burning desires. Appearing quarterly, each issue will contain
innovative, contemporary departments, features, and columns geared to the
young executive.

Founded in 1872, Lockwood Trade Journal Co., Inc. has been a family-run
entity since its inception. Presently, fifth generation Lockwood brothers run
the company, and the 6th generation has entered the family business. Lockwood
publishes three trade magazines: TOBACCO INTERNATIONAL, established in 1886;
SMOKESHOP, established in 1970; and the TEA &amp; COFFEE TRADE JOURNAL
established in 1902. 

With SMOKE, Lockwood makes its first, well-researched and supported venture
into the consumer arena.  Through TOBACCO INTERNATIONAL and SMOKESHOP,
Lockwood has a long-standing relationship with the cigar and pipe
manufacturers, as well as the retail tobacconists. The tobacco industry has
given its wholehearted support to SMOKE and its premiere issue.

Launched amid the resurgence of the cigar, SMOKE focuses on the world of the
young, energetic cigar smoker. Distinctively a lifestyle magazine, SMOKE's
vitality is truly cosmopolitan, with creative editorial and design linking
each universe of today's cigar enthusiast to one publication. Speaking to a
wider audience than simply cigar smokers, SMOKE takes the reader on an
entertaining journey to cigar parties, celebrity humidors, Jazz clubs,
unconventional travel locals, and gallery openings while filling the reader
with intelligent insights and new perspectives. 

SMOKE will be published four times a year: Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall. Each
issue will have:

A high-energy News Department consisting of bits and pieces of exciting
items, as well as incorporating world and U.S. events; a Q &amp; A section
featuring a prominent cigar smoker; Two Reoccurring Columns -- one
cigar-related and one non-related; the Cover Story; a Cigar-related story; a
Pipe-related story; an Automotive article incorporating a fun, affordable
vehicle; a Sports article, utilizing non-traditional sports; a Travel
article;  a Wine and Sprits article, featuring different a spirit in every
issue; an Internet article, with a look inside the internet cigar rooms; a
Collectibles piece, featuring unique products and many photos; an Investment
article, lots of details but not too upscale; a list of select tobacco
retailers worldwide; a Fashion shoot, incorporating cigars and fashion; and a
two-page themed comic.

Each issue will also contain the Cigar Review,  not a rating by numbers, but
rather an evaluation by independent cigar enthusiasts speaking in layman's
terms. There will be twenty panelists broken down into four panels of five
people. The panel will consist of industry executives, retailers, and
consumers.

Each panel will review five different brands of one cigar size. So in each
issue, twenty brands from different countries in four different sizes will be
reviewed. Over the course of three months, each panel member will sample five
cigars of each brand. Thus, a fair and unbiased opinion based on random
smoking over time will be presented. 

The Cigar Review, coupled with timely, intriguing articles, will place SMOKE
on the forefront of the cigar world.

 Hello Fellow Cigar Smokers;

 I just got back from Niagra Falls and thought you might be interested in a
small cigar store that I don't see in the database. The store is Gordon's
Cigars &amp; Pipes. I've been travelling to Niagra for the last three years and
each year the selection of Havanas has gotten better. This year,a walk in
humidor has replaced the glass counters. I of course don't bring Havanas
into the U.S. I,of course,don't even puchase the fine product of that
terrible threat to the national security of the U.S.A little Communist
island.Thanks to the Late President Kennedy : [ that's against the law.
But;anyone who does will find a really large selection of just about every
Cuban brand I've heard of. I could have purchased Partagas Lucitanias at
$19.50 U.S,R&amp;J Churchills(tubed) at $15.60
and I could have purchased Bolivar coronas at $8.45 U.S. Any size of
Cohiba,Montis(including the pryamid) and a large selection of Partagas,LGC
and Romeo&amp;Julietta ,which would be my personal favorite,if I smoked
Cubans,were in good supply. Just thought you all might like to know!
     I could have had a really great time watching the Browns roll over the
Bears while sipping a great  Labatts Blue and smoking a Cohiba
Esplendito,(why are they sooooo smooth?) ...If that was'nt against the law!
     Smoke em while you've got'em.

Sorry I am an issue late with this but I've been away for a while.

 The worst cigar I can remember having was a Las Cabrillas robusto
(Hondouran). The pull was easy but it was hot from the beginning.
Additionally, It burned very unevenly and the taste was beyond putrid. Save
your money on this one.

I am looking for information on where Por Larranaga cigars are manufactured.
A new Cigar Shop in San Jose, CA is very interested in finding out where to

Any information, such as an address, name of the manufacturer, etc. would be
greatly appreciated.

Thanks and happy smoking to all!

Steve,
I have enjoyed PD for a few months now and want to thank you for the work you
do on it. I makes for a nice, quick, informed Saturday night read.

I recently had an interesting experience I wanted to relate and get some
input on. After a recent dinner at a fine restaurant in a major US city, the
car hop noticed my unlit Te-Amo in my mouth and asked if I was a cigar smoker
(I liken this to when I am asked if my IDENTICAL twin boys are twins!). I
answered a very jovial "yes" and the car hop asked me if I wanted to buy some
Cubans.

I am obviously a loyal American and want to avoid the issues surrounding the
embargo, but I answered this aggressive car hop that so much counterfeiting
of Cubans was going on that I was very sceptical he could ever have the real
thing. He said that the "Congressman" who was supposed to buy them didn't
show up and he wanted to get rid of them. After a bit more repartee, I walked
over to his white, 1978 Caprice. Inside was a Zip-loc bag with a wet paper
towel in it and a box that read Montecristo.

I was still sceptical. He wanted $100 and they are, of course, illegal. Not
to mention they could have be garbage. The question is, how do you know?

If it ever happens again, how will I know a fake from the real thing? Just by
smoking? Any reader response would be welcome.

Again, great job.  My best, Greg (???????@???.???)

Hi Steve,

Seems that I can't get to the Pipes Digest page right now.  I used tohave
no problem and I was wondering if something on your end was down.

The reason I tried there is because I had a question.  This is for you
personally OR the Digest if you think they can give me more insight.

I smoked my pipe (I'm a new pipe smoker ... for that matter, ANY tobacco) the
other night and I got sick as a dog.  I could barely walk after smoking a
pipe full.  Sitting you don't realize this till you get up.

Anyway, what happened?

I called the tobacco shop where I bought my pipe and he said I must have
inhaled.  I can tell you that if I inhale the smoke (at all), I start coughing
like crazy.  So I don't think that was it.  Sure it's in the air but enough
to make me sick?

However, here's what I think it was.  He told me that a typical smoke is about
a puff every 30 or so seconds.  I can tell you that in my effort to keep it
lit, I was going about every 5.  I could not hold the pipe by the bowl as it
was too hot.  Does this sound like the problem?  If so, the FAQs should mention
this :)

<a name="45">Subject: Quest: Dutch Comfort</a>

This is my first posting.  Didn't notice a different posting address in the
intro material, so I'm going to this one.  Correct me if I'm wrong. PD looks
like a great gang of people.  I've been seeking a resource such as this for
quite a while.

I pose a question for pipe smokers: around the mid-seventies at Old Town
Mall in Torrance, CA there was a shop called Bob's Pipe 'n Pouch.  It was
there I purchased my first pipe and tobacco.  Among the batch of several I
went home with to try was one called "Dutch Comfort".  Well, Bob's stayed in
business at this location for about another year, I guess.  One fateful day,
I went for my refill and the store was gone!  I believe they moved to parts
south, but well out of the range I was willing to drive for mere pipe
tobacco (if I only knew then...).  Dutch Comfort was a great cavendish blend
with an aroma that for me was incomparable to anything I smoked then or since.

About ten or so years later, still on my quest for the perfect pipe tobacco,
I decided to ask the proprietor of Smokers Emporium (in Torrance also) about
Dutch Comfort.  She was extremely well-versed in tobacoo blending and when I
asked, she thought for a second and said: "oh yes, that was blended with a
special Troost blend and a little maduro".  Well, apparantly the Troost
blend was no longer being made, so she tried a blend of another pair of
Troost pouch tobacs with a little Maduro.  The result was vaguely familiar,
but not like I expected. Personally, I think it had a casing of something
else as well.

I know that tobacco names do not always run concurrent through different
areas of the country, etc., but I'd like to know from anyone if they have
heard of a blend like this and who makes it.

I would like to request permission to be included in the PIPES mailing list.
I am mainly interested in cigars, but when I saw the part about collectible
tobacciana I got even more excited. I have been looking for an old Wells
Fargo spitoon for years. Besides cigars I also dip and have a chew once in a

[ADMIN] For the next two or three weeks, there will be not a peep from
the Digest.  Yr. Moderator will, as of September 9, have tied the knot
with his best sweetie, Jeanette Catherine LaRosa.  Thereafter, for a
short time, we will concern ourselves with neither the pressures of
paid labor, nor the more pleasant diversions of moderatorship!  (I
will, however, take a favorite pipe or nineteen along, and smoke 'em
as other husbandly duties permit :-)

We will, however, be back as soon as is reasonably possible after
that. (And, BTW, if you feel so inclined, Jean [who is a beautiful,
intelligent, and tolerant nonsmoker] would probably enjoy a word of
either congratulations or caution, as you see fit; :-) her address is

<a name="2">Subject: pipe, war and peace</a>

Greetings from Lapland to all the subscribers of P.D.

I returned from my annual 3 weeks' wandering in the wildernesses of Lapland. 
There were more mosquitoes than ever, but trout was biting eagerly and the 
line was often tight.

This time I had plenty of tobacco with me. I enjoyed "Early Morning Pipe" 
and every now and then Mac Baren's "Virginia no 1". Had cozy hours at the 
camp fire staking fish and puffing pipe. My mind wandered freely and so I 
remembered an episode about my father in the Finnish-Soviet Winter war in 
1939-1940. My father did not tell this to me, I heard it much later from a 
man, who had participated in the war.

Father was at the time an officer (captain) in the Finnish army and a sworn 
pipe smoker.
He was pointing his men to a direction to move with his dear Dunhill in hand 
when a light Soviet machine gun begun to fire ( with internationally banned 
exploding bullets) from the distance of 50 yards cutting his pointing right  
hand loose from the shoulder. Naturally my old man fell down and lost 
consciousness. He recovered consciousness when being put in sleigh. His 
first words were:" Where is the pipe? You damned, you'll not take me 
anywhere without my pipe !" The pipe was then found and the journey to the 
first aid station through the hard crust of snow began.

Thank God those blood-stained  times are past and gone in this northern 
corner of Europe. The problems lie now in the South-Eastern Europe.

The habit of smoking pipe seems to be a family tradition even with us. 
Grandpa smoked pipe and my brother, too. I remember that this question of 
learning the habit of smoking pipe has once been a theme in the P.D.

So, smoke in peace!

With loaded batteries back to work at the university.

I ran across an old pipe that I had purchased 20 years ago. It was made by 
the Carey Pipe Co. It was sort of a gimmick, in that, it had a vent in the 
stem to cool the smoke (venturi effect)and had paper sleeves inside the stem 
to help slow down the air intake. 

My questions are, does the company still exist and if so what is there
address ?

If not, does anyone know if the paper sleeves are still available anywhere?

&gt;Where can I order replacements for the meerschaum bowl?

I'd give CAO a try. Don't have a phone number, unfortunately.

&gt;Are such bowls poured as slip into a mold or are they carved from
solid blocks? 

It depends.  Most of them are pressed from meerschaum bits with a vegatable 
gum binder, but CAO does make ones with solid block inserts.  It took me 
quite some time to find such a calabash, however.  My understanding is that 
CAO is no longer making plain ones with the solid block inserts--they only 
have ones with more ornately carved inserts and/or a shammy-covered calabash 
section.

&gt;If the former, can I purchase a mold and meerschaum 
&gt;clay slip?  If the latter, can I purchase the blocks?

Beats me, but I'd be interested to hear what you find out.

<a name="6">Subject:      Re: Pipes Digest #198 - August 23, 1995</a>

I have just finished reading my first PD.  I seem to have found a lot
of like-m inded souls among the PD readers.

I may be repeating a request for information that others have
posted--please fo rgive me if I do.  I'm searching for a replacement
for Cravens Mixture pipe tob acco.  I was introduced to it in London
in 1990 at a pipe shop near Covent Gard en and the theatre district (I
don't recall its name) where I purchased my firs t Ashton.  Until
perhaps a little over a year ago, I had been purchasing Craven s from
a Louisville, KY, pipe shop.  However, I was informed that the mixture
i s not longer being manufactured in England or anywhere else.  Does
anyone on th is net know if this is accurate.  If so, where can find a
similar replacement?  I tried a blend recommended by a Texax
smokeshop, but was disappointed.  It doesn't taste at all like the
Cravens.

By way of introduction, I have been smoking for 32 years, since I was
14, but did not become a "full-time" pipe smoker until I was in
college.  I worked for nine years in a smokeshop in Lexington, KY,
while I was in graduate school, whe re I became a collector of fine
pipes and a dedicated cigar smoker (how could I avoid it--I had a
walk-in humidor full of cigars to indulge in).  I mainly collect
pre-1970 Dunhills, of which I own seven (I only buy one or two a year)
and I, too, am still looking for that shoebox of Dunhills for only 20
bucks.  I also own top-of-the-line Savinellis, Ashtons, Tilsheads, but
restrict myself to English-made briar collecting currently.  Has
anyone had any experience buying/collecting in England.  Every time
I'm over there I look for secondhand pipes but haven't had any luck.
I must be looking in the wrong places.

Reply to Mark Cox: Whoever sold you that corncopb isn't much of a
sales- person.  At my old shop, we recommended the best briar that the
buyer could afford.  After all, a briar will last a lifetime if taken
care of.  And the bette r the briar, the better the smoke.  I'd have
recommended a medium priced Savine lli.  Look around for a top quality
second-hand briar that's been well-cleaned and invest in it if you
want to try a really fine pipe.  Reply to Professor Kouni: I, too,
know Skip's shop in Birmingham.  I try to go there whenever I'm in the
city visiting a friend who is also a pipe smoker and collector.

&gt; and could use some hints on how and what to smoke. 

Partially fill the bottle with water. I've been informed that it's traditional
to add a shot of arrak (if you imagine ouzo as a gentle, civilized tipple,
arrak would be its primitive and brutal ancestor).

Crumble dried whole-leaf tobacco, soak it in water for a few minutes, and 
pile it in the bowl. Top with three or four pieces of burning charcoal.
It'll smoke for hours, if you keep the charcoal stoked (which is why I wait
for the goat roast).

Since you're in Portland, you'll be glad to know the International Food
Bazaar, 929 SW 9th, carries the correct tobacco (and single hose hookahs).
For those in less civilized areas, check middle eastern and Persian
grocery stores.

Martin

[ BTW, congrats on the 4-seater! Enjoy, with three friends! And never
mix ouzo with water. -S. ]

<a name="10">Subject: Cigars and The President</a>

Hello,

This is my first posting, I really enjoy PD. 

I smoke cigars and have been for the last 22 years, ouch! Avos are a
favorite. A Hoya De Monterey Rothschild is kinda my default setting, not to
expensive, still a little to butch, but hey get over it (used go for the
maduro wrapper, but have switched to naturals in my old age). Had a Cuban
Cohiba once but didn't think it was worth the trouble. It was good but come
on it wasn't that good. 

I'm on a quest for the ultimate cheap cigar. The specs are under 2 bucks,
fatish like a high 40 to 50, length is not much of an issue. Smoothness is a
prime consideration--AVOs being the model. OK ladies and gentlemen you have
been briefed.  

An on a more serious note: I've got to say that I'm in complete agreement
with the President. The American tobacco industry needs to be policed. Much
of thier advertising is aimed directly at kids and this is wrong. We all
know what effects inhaling cigarette smoke has on the human body, so let's
be realistic. And then there are those additives, not good, very bad. I've
smoked quite a few Camel straights and Gauloise in my time (really is there
anything better than one of these and an espresso and the New York Times)
but I'm not compulsive about it and I'm also an adult who is not physically
addicted to nicotine (I probably am addicted to my trips to the Cigar Store
and to yacking on the phone with the nice folks at Mike's Cigars). I have
many problems with our Goverment but I've got to say that I distrust big
corporations more. They all aren't bad but the system doesn't exactly
promote social responsibility.  

Robin Willis

[ Well, Robin, thanks for your comments.  Many of us, though, are
concerned that Big Government is moving slowly and steadily toward
prohibition, including a ban on your trips to the cigar store, and
that the cigarette companies (though definitely not saints) are being
systematically demonized, toward that end.  I certainly hope not,
though I fear so.  Watch this space for details. -S. ]

<a name="14">Subject: Death of a Smoke Shop</a>

Hi Steve &amp; Pipe Fans,

Here in Bangor, Maine we witnessed the death of a smoke shop.  The owner of
the business wrote of its closing in a recent  Pipes Digest.  I feel inclined
to share with the members of this group some personal observations regarding
the operation and ultimate demise of this shop.  I first learned of "The
Sundries Shop" via a local TV commercial.  I visited the shop and introduced
myself as a fellow PD member and avid pipe smoker of 19 years.  The owner was
a genuinely pleasant and cordial young man.  However, my first impression
upon leaving the shop was that this business was not long for this world.  

Even though the grand opening was a few weeks earlier, the store had a very
unkempt appearance inside.  Trash was piled up next to the counter, there was
a bucket of hand tools sitting next to the trash, and unhung paintings and
pictures were leaning against the walls.  

The smoking area of the business was poorly stocked in the beginning.
 Although the inventory did improve over the months, it didn't start out
properly.  Cigar smokers had more to choose from than pipe smokers.  There
were several tinned tobaccos available, but little in the way of pipes that
would be of interest.  The local drugstores had more to offer - and they
strictly carry the low-end pipes.  Four bulk tobaccos were available, again
the local drugstores carry comparable products.

The owner told me that he couldn't seem to locate suppliers for certain
product lines, e.g. Peterson pipes.  He even wrote of this problem a few
months ago in the PD.  Why he didn't research this BEFORE he signed the lease
and opened up I'll never know!  I told him that he could find this info by
talking to other smoke shops (in the Resource Guide) or by contacting the
RTDA.

The owner had not visited or even known of some of the smoke shops here in
thinly-populated Maine.  This would have been helpful because he had no
previous working experience in a smoke shop.  He had worked for Cutlery World
and Coffee Express prior to starting this business.

This business lacked a focus.  It tried to offer too much.  It sold tobacco,
inexpensive pipes, cigars, Swiss Army knives, cutlery and kitchen utensils,
beer steins, dart boards, T-shirts, paintings, crafts, candles, coin purses,
etc.  It had dart throwing lanes.  In addition, it offered underarm
antiperspirants (perhaps for the occasional patron of the little hotel next
door.)

The owner's knowledge of cigars and pipes was quite limited.  What he did
know was very recently obtained.  I suspect that he had hopped on the cigar
train just a few stops back.  (We were all new to this at one time.)  

My wife, who is a professor of international business, told me that his
business failed because he wasn't in business properly.  She would like to
have seen his business plan before he opened up.  

After six months or so in business, the owner sold everything at cost.  I
spent hundreds of dollars there in the last few days he was open.  But
instead of getting some nice bargains on cigars now, I would rather have a
viable, downtown smoke shop to visit for years to come.

The owner is now looking for work.  I hope something comes along
really soon. He said that he plans to operate a tobacco mail-order
business (in his spare time.)  He hopes to get the word out through
computer bulletin boards and the like.  It'll be tougher than he
thinks (in price, selection, and experience.)  I do wish him good
luck.  He's a nice man.

Perhaps this helps those readers who may have a dream of opening a smoke
shop.  It's good to dream.  There are many success stories of people who took
risks in business.  But do your homework.

Steve, et al.

Well, I'm once again settled down here at Ole Miss and this has given me the
chance to sneak up to Memphis and patronize my favorite tobacco shop. The
Tobacco Corner, Ltd. looks to have been around a while and has a good
selection of pipes, pens (the entire center of the store is writing
implements) and cigars. In fact, Elliot, the owner, recently received a huge
shipment of Arturo Fuentes I'm sure has already disappeared. He says they
move so fast, he doesn't even recommend them anymore. The store also
contains a good selection of Pipe Tobak, but the best are Elliot's
homeblends. My favorite so far is his Lord Elliot Balkan, which is a good
knock-off of Balkan Sobranie. There are usually two or three men sitting at
a table near the back smoking pipes or cigars and chatting about their kids
or the news. The store is also attached to a good sized newsstand. Elliot
himself is quite a character--he puts his own picture on the store's
matchboxes--but he's very helpful to newcomers and more than happy to share
a bit of his personal blends. Pens, Pipes, Cigars and Magazines--if Elliot
only served Coffee, the place would be perfect.

For inclusion in the directory, the pertinent info is as follows:

Tobacco Corner, Ltd.
669 South Mendenhall
Memphis, TN 38177
(901) 682-3326

The matchboxes, btw, indicate that they have a pipe repair service and will
mail anywhere, but I have yet to test either of these. If you're in Memphis,
drop by. 

In other news I'm heading up to Memphis on September 14 to attend the
Peabody Hotel's first ever Cigar Dinner. The Peabody is posh, so this should
be quite a night, even at only $75 per person. For this we get to sample
unreleased Dutch cigars from Hajenius Cigars (which I take to be the shop,
not the brand) and get to partake of a six course meal from Master Chef Jose
Gutierrez--who I've actually heard of, and nine different reserve wines from
Clos Du Val. It sounds like it's going to be a real treat. I promise I'll
have a detailed report of the night, including my opinions on the cigars, in
an upcoming issue. If any one wants more info, email me at the above and
below address.

Until then, keep smoking, but only the good stuff.

<a name="18">Subject: Pipes Digest request</a>

Steve,

Would you please add me to the mailing list for Pipes Digest?  I've  
read a few of the digests off the Wine forum on CompuServe, and  
consistently enjoy it.

I am 23 years old and started smoking cigars approximately one year ago  
after stumbling into the Wine/Cigar forum on CompuServe.  After smoking  
cigars for a couple of months, I found myself continually drifting  
towards the pipes and related supplies at the local store.  I  
eventually bought a corn cob and some of the house tobacco, and gave it  
a shot.  I used more matches in 30 minutes with that pipe than I  
dreamed would be possible (not that I fantasize about playing with  
matches &lt;g&gt;).  Despite this, I thought it to be a worthwhile endeavor,  
and continued with the new found pleasure.

I currently own a couple of good pipes (Peterson and Ser Jacopo) and a  
few bargain basket pipes.  I still tend to use the cheaper pipes, as I  
have concerns of ruining the better two.  Actually, I still haven't  
smoked my favorite.  Some day I'll convince myself I'm ready, I  
suppose.  In the realm of tobacco, I'm primarily smoking Bob Hamlin's  
PCCA Collectors Reserve blends.  At this point, my favorite is Equinox,  
but I have more to try.

Eventually, I'll figure out how to keep the pipe going without using a  
8 matches.  At this point, however, the thought of using just 2 matches  
for an entire bowl is beyond my imaginative powers.

Thanks Steve.

?????@????????.??? [ i'm back in school and it costs me nothing... sorry to
make others feel jealous]

Worst smoke: tie: in high school tried smoking cigarettes[  bleah..], even
worse was the kind of cigarette: a Capri.  My less tolerant and unguided
friends asked if i was gay, which I am not, but I don't think a tobacco
preference has anything to do with sexuality....  I guess  they thought it
was a "girl thing."  That lasted all of 10 cigarettes... I tried to give it a
chance... 

the other worst smoke was a batch of a great blend that i erroneously thought
had been sealed back up in the pouch, but had dried to the point of paper's
consistency.  it was like smoking my term papers. [ which has crossed my
collegiate mind several times]

great smoke story: two other fraternity brothers and i were in KC last year
outside an uptown mall area there, had all just bought great cigar's from the
local tobacconist, and were lighting up outside.  We had about an hour of
fun, talking and making fun of the kids playing in the fountain, and
discussing our futures.  Great memory of a fun trip.

One pipe shop, I can't remember if it's in the resources, but Charlotte has a
great tobacconist's shop, called McCranie's Pipe Shop.  704-523-8554 Located
at Park Road Shopping Center no idea on the physical address or zip, but they
do mail order and have a great selection of cigars and also many estate
pipes...  i was amazed at the type of establishment it is, there is a "bar"
area, where you can sample the blends, sit down and puff away... old man
mccranie is sometimes there and tells wonderful stories...

I've been smoking around three years [ pipes and cigars that is, quit
cigarettes soon after i started], and have enjoyed grading math papers over
my stanwell apple, or a fun night at Phi Gamma Delta with my bulldog [ it is
a secord i got years ago].

Last story.  I started smoking to begn with b/c i remember the wonderful
aroma that surrounded my father's office, as Dad used to smoke a pipe, as did
his other English dept. prof's at Atlantic Christian College [ now Barton ].
 That's one of my few memories of my dad [ he died when i was 5].  Somewhere
safely packed away are his pipes and humidor, and when I find them, mom says
I can take them.  It's not meant to be a sad story, but a good one.  Dad and
I will share a pipe sometime in the heavens and tell stories.

Cigar) on the weekends as a break from the persuit of my Ph.D. in

PD every month.  You're doing a great job and a great service to the
pipe/cigar community.  Tom.

Steve: Hello, I'm Tom McNeill, a graduate student at the University of
Houston, on the weekends I work in a tobacco shop to supplement my
meager earnings from teaching laboratories (biology).  A few words of
advice on a new shop...Know the demographics of your client base.  A
common misconception is that cigar smokers have more money than God.
This is a stereotype that has been promoted by Cigar Afficianado.  I
can tell you from experience in our shop, just because someone makes
seven figures does not mean he or she will spend $15.00 on a cigar.
Actually, at our shop the resistance point is about $5.00 for cigars
and $250.00 for humidors (when I say resistance point I'm referring to
the point at which the customer must be "sold" on the item in
question).  One of the most important things you can do is create a
friendly atmosphere with your furnishings.  I guarantee you, if the
place looks like the board room of General Motors people will be
afraid to enter your shop (example, how many people do you see, on a
given day at your local Ferrari dealership).  In short, if your
clients are in their early thirties and over fifty (typical cigar
demographics) they will be more apt to shop in a store that is
scrupulously clean and has a knowledgable, patient staff and low
prices rather than a place that looks like a nite club (Cheer's
vs. Studio 54).  A couple more suggestions: 1) One thing that may
occur is you will develope a regular group who will make your shop
their hang-out, this is not a bad thing, but from what I've seen,
these people usually don't make big purchases, they'll monopolize the
TV, stereo, and drink all of your free coffee, leer at women customers
and chase off those who are not part of their little group.  To avoid
this, at our shop our seating is un-padded, comfortable enough to sit
on and smoke but too uncomfortable to spend an afternoon in.

2) The idea of a conferece room is a good one; however, is the
occasional usage of the conference room really worth losing the square
footage of display space.  We've only been open since February, but
our shop has undergone three or four rearrangings to maximize display
space both in and out of the humidor.  The conference room space (in
my humble opinion) would be better utilized as locker space so your
customers can keep their box purchases at the perfect temperature and
humidity.

3) Selling coffee is also a good idea, there is a shop here in Houston
that sells cigars, coffee, pipes, and liquor.  What makes this shop
work is the fact that it's run by Grandma, Mom, and Daughter (they're
not related but they are generationally correct).  If a man were to
try and run this shop, coffee sales would suffer because they're
primary coffee clientele is female.  Women customers are a strange
lot, many of them are afraid to go into a cigar shop because of its
masculine nature (just like many men are hesitant to walk into
Victoria's Secret or Fredrick's of Hollywood).  But, if the shop is
light airy and doesn't reek of cigars they will be happy to come in
and shop.  On the other hand, if your shop caters to women too much
(potpourri, scented candles, soaps, and "gifty" items), your shop will
lose that feeling of being the last bastion of maleness (that is, if
that's what your after) and at that point the decline begins (there is
a chain of shops in Houston that did this and they've gone from eight
locations to three locations, as well as from profit to near
bankruptcy.  The moral of the story is to maintain your focus on what
you are selling and not to diversify too much (if you bring in
beersteins, pocket knives and figurines, close up shop, nobody will
take you seriously as a tobacconist).

4) Probably the thing you can do to make you shop unique is to know
your product inside and out.  Too many people in tobacco don't know
their product to save their lives.  Pipes are a good example, the
owner of our (his) shop has been a pipe collector for 40 years and
knows his material better than any three pipe sellers put together in
Houston.  Important, be able to speak with authority on cigars, if you
stock bargain cigars be able to tell a novice what he/she will be in
for with an El Crapo cigar and more importantly be able to tell a
novice what cigars are just as good as a Davidoff for a third of the
price (this they will thank you for by buying cigars more frequently).


5) Music: I would suggest lite jazz, classical (avoid opera), also a
nice touch would be a stock ticker or tuning into Rush Limbaugh in the
afternoon.  Again this depends upon the demographics of your client
base.

6) Last thoughts: I wish you the best, what I've put forth is pretty
much what I've learned about the tobacco business.  I hope I've been
informative and not inflamatory.  If you have any questions or flames
please let me know. 

Tom.

[ Many thanks for the suggestions, Tom! I would also suggest a clubby
atmosphere -- wood paneling and leather armchairs -- if one has the
pockets for it. -S. ]

Steve,
 
  I very much enjoyed the July 20 digest, particularly the Costello piece.
&gt;From that I was able to figure out 4 of my 6 Costellos (the newer ones) -
still can't find any info on my two rather older, Italian market pieces.
 However, what I would really like to know is wether there is a back issue
article of similar depth on Dunhill pipes. I have managed to amass over 20 of
these, with many going back several generations (I believe).  I sent a
message to the newsgroup over the weekend re several of these pipes looking
for clues, but to no avail so far.
  Keep up the good work - it's really helpful!

 1) What is the word that describes the difference between the
taste of hot cocoa, made with cocoa powder and heated milk and
sugar, and Bosco or Quik added to milk?
    What is the word that describes the difference between a
decent port wine and Manischevitz Extra Heavy Malaga?
    I need that word to describe a particular taste note to
my tobacconist.  I want to say "Bite" or "Oomph", but then
I just get harsh tobacco.

 1a) Which tobaccos (in all forms) have this character?  It's
the kind of taste you can dive into.  The Turkish blends come
closest to me in pipe and cigarette; I didn't quite find it
in the cigars I tried before I decided I don't like cigars
very much.

 2) What is it that makes the ash of many cigars, and some
cigarettes, hold their shape, even after the wrapper/paper
has burned away.  (I'm noticing that the new [Andron] Turkish
Special cigarettes seem to have this characteristic, which I
didn't notice before.)

 3) I used to use a pipe tobacco from Leavitt &amp; Pierce/David
Ehrlich called Mango Cavendish.  They don't carry it anymore,
but their Twainbury is very close.  (Judge's Mixture is somewhat
close.)
    So that I can just attribute it to the passage of time, and
end my quest (more recently I did find a blend called Mango
Cavendish at a Tobaconnist Ltd that is no longer a mall 40
miles from here) can anyone who has compared the two blends 
side-by-side compare and contrast?

<a name="23">Subject: cleaning stems</a>

Dear Steve:

I am really enjoying PD, both for the great information and for the way that
it is the closest thing - sadly - to a pipe shop around my home city of
Saint John, New Brunswick.  I have been smoking pipes long enough that some
of my pipes are really old friends of 30 years.

Because there is no pipe shop in town, my pipes don't get the complimemtary
buffing when I am buying tobacco, since that is a mail order event.

A few weeks ago, I decided my pipes needed MAJOR cleaning.  What started out
as an unpleasant chore quickly became an enjoyable activity and a worthwhile
experiment.

Starting out with the pipe in worst shape, a Charatan second with a severely
oxidized gray green brown stem, I set the bowl to soak overnight filled with
isopropyl alcohol.  The stem was such a mess that sanding seemed the only
option.  Starting with 360 grit aluminum oxide paper, I wet sanded, then
worked with 400 wet and the 600 wet.  Although I have buffing compound, a
drill with buffs, and a Dremel tool, I decided, in the experimental mood, to
try using Autosol, a polish for hand polishing metal, fiberglass, etc.  The
Autosol brought the stem to a nice deep black.  Next, three coats of
Armor-All, allowing each coat to soak in for about 12 hours.  By the third
coat the stem looked honestly better than when it was new some 20 years ago!
After letting the Armor-All cure for a few days, I put the pipe back
together and waxed it with Carnauba (Mother's brand, sold in the car wax
section at the local auto/hardware/sports/etc store), buffing it with a
cloth buff on the Moto-tool.  The wax did not improve the already great look
of the stem, but did wonders for the black sandblast bowl.  My old friend is
looking and smoking great.

Continuing the experiment suggests that some stems (Charatan, Dunhill) will
come to a great polish (after sanding) with Autosol polish.  However, some
brands (Savinelli, Royal Falcon (Comoy lower end pipe), and others) only get
a nice deep black when buffed with Tripoli after the sanding.  Buffing a
badly oxidized stem with Tripoli, or using Autosol, without sanding wet
produced shiny but ugly off black stems that came back to life only after
doing the whole routine with the sanding followed by buffing, Armor-All, and
Carnauba.

I've seen some concerns in PD about using tire dressings on stems.  Some
tire dressings are probably toxic.  While I won't advise anyone to use
Armor-All - we all make our decisions on risks of tobacco or stem polish  -
I did do a bit of research.  According to Clinical Toxicology of Commercial
Products, 5th Edition by R.E. Gosselin et al (1984), Armor-All Protectant
consists of &gt;90% poydimethyl siloxone (silicone oil) as a water
solution/emulsion, and &lt;1% antimicrobial agent.  Silicone oil is described
as having no recognized unequivical toxic effects.  A large dose by mouth
was said to have produced mild intoxication.  Silicone oil is used in the
food and pharmaceutical industies as well as various medical and surgical
applications.

Hope this may be of some interest to the readers of PD.  Keep up the great
work, it is appreciated.

Best regards,

Ken

[ Thanks, Ken!  But I still wouldn't trust the Armor-All, what with
all the problems with silicone breast implants... -S. ]

Steve:

Our server was down and we last all mail for last week. Was there a PD?  If
so, please resend.

Just back from R.T.D.A. and it was *great*.  More people than ever before
and a whole lot of young people who were starting or had just started
tobacco shops. Someone told me that 16 had been started in the L.A. area
this last year. Lots of interest in pipes and tobacco, but the main
attraction was cigars, of course. 

Whole atmosphere was very upbeat which is encouraging. People were spending
money, and big bucks at that. One humidor about 6 X 5 feet and 3 feet deep
with its own atmospheric contral and connected to the maker in Switzerland
by satellite (sp?) in case it got "sick," was priced at $150,000. *Two were
sold*  My bride saw the "guts" and said it looked like a Ferrari with its
hood up combined with a 747 instrument panel.  Mastercraft's high end
Italian pipes were so popular they had to have someone fly in with more the
second day. Stores were buying 30-40 at a time!

Whole thing gave me the feeling that pipe smoking was nowhere near dead, in
fact, it was very much alive and kicking. Lots of new, young pipe smokers, too.
Best,

Craig

Let me not to the true marriage of pipe smokers and their tobacco admit
impediments.

[ Very encouraging, Craig! Thanks for the report!  BTW, sadly, I doubt
that I'll be able to make it down to Richmond this year for the CORPS
show, as we'd talked about, but I'm sure our paths will cross
oneadesedays... -S. ]

<a name="26">Subject: PIMO, INC.</a>

Recently received word that there is a change of address for PIMO, Inc. under
RESOURCES, MISCELLANEOUS SUPPLIES  as follows: PIMO, INC. (Pipe carving
equipment, materials, and repair kits) new address is Butternut Lane, P.O.
box 2043, Manchester Center, VT 05255 (802) 362-3371 
Pimo was taken over by my father, Vermont pipe carver, Al Baier upon
retirement of Isso Altalay. Incidentally, Al Baier began his professional
career as a pipe carver a number of years ago by sending for PRIMO'S GUIDE TO
PIPE CRAFTING AT HOME, the "bible" of pipe making for the past 20 years.
Since drilling the tobacco and air hole in a block of briar is the most
critical operation in pipe making, Al will offer a pre-drilled block of briar
with a pre-fitted stem along with the "guide" as a package for would-be pipe
carvers. For the novice, it still leaves plenty of room for creativity in the
shaping and finishing of the pipe.
In addition to supplies - briar and meerschaum blocks, stems, stains, waxes,
etc., Al has two new accessory products for pipe owners - a pipe stem
tightener kit and a patented pipe stem replacement kit. Both items can be
applied at home in a metter of seconds. For more information contact Al
directly at (802) 362-3371 or send e-mail request to: ??????????@???.???

[ Many, many thanks for this! I haven't tried to contact Pimo in
years, but it's a pleasure to know they're still in business. -S. ]

To Pipe Digest Devotees:  A pipe dinner in San Francisco
on Sunday, October 8th. has just been organized by The Piedmont Tobacconist
in Oakland, and Sherlock's Haven in S.F.
It is going to be held at MacArthur Park Restaurant at 607 Front St. in S.F.
and will be a friendly, affordable evening of good food, good drink, and, I
guarantee it, good tobacco.  Multi-course Bar B Que (or fresh fish) dinner,
with salad and top notch dessert and craft brewed beer, plus tobacco favors
and plenty of door prizes donated by our finest suppliers (I have been known
to be a pretty effective extortionist).  
     The hors d'oeuvres and swap/show &amp; tell portion begins at 4 PM; dinner
at 6 PM (or 6:30 if activity so dictates).  All for $45, and well, well worth
it.  If interested, reservations can be made at either of the two tobacco
shops listed above.  At this moment I can only give the phone # for
Sherlock's, 415-362-1405.  Check, Visa/MC/AmEx all accepted.  Hope to see you
there (but seating is limited to about 35-40 tops).
     And now that I'm on the line, I'd like to add my opinion that the
intellectual resource re: pipes has been tremendously magnified now that John
Eels is on this network.  I'd hate to see him innundated with questions,
etc., but his experience and knowledge, etc. has been demonstrated show after
show.  His brain should definitely be picked by any of you who feel the info
you're getting is not much more than guesswork.  (John should also be shamed
into making more pipes, as his craftsmanship is excellent, but he's much
bigger and stronger than me, so I'm going to let you inveigle him into that
enterprise).  Smoke 'em if you've got 'em.  Marty Pulvers

<a name="28">Subject: clay pipes</a>

Hi fellow pipers,

Today I picked up my first clay pipe and tried it out twice.  It's a 
lightweight little thing, white, with a 3/4" wide bowl and a 3" long 
undetachable clay stem.

I still don't quite know what I think about this new smoking experience. 
Smoking such a small, light pipe was strange indeed.  I tried two
different blends in it, Legacy (a heavy Virginia-Turkish-latakia blend
from The Smoker in Albany, NY) and Blatter Reserve (a medium fragrant
latakia-turkish blend).  Both times I noticed a fair amount of flavour
loss towards the bottom of the bowl and that the small amount of tobacco
used in the bowl gave a kick equivalent to a greater quantity of tobacco
in one of my briars.  Maybe this is just because it's a new pipe ?  I 
don't think I left a shred of tobacco unburned in these two initial 
bowlfuls, which is indeed a sign that something was good.

The odour of the warming clay was fairly pronounced as the bowl heated up 
toward the bottom, reminding me of when I was a teenager during which 
time my parents ran a ceramics shop.  I never associated that clay smell 
with smoking except perhaps when quietly stealing a cigarette while 
downstairs in that shop where the kilns were.  I don't know yet if that 
clay smell is pleasant or unpleasant to me when smoking pipe tobacco.

I'm also not convinced that I like the sensation of the clay stem on my 
teeth.  As well, the clay stem, being porous, absorbs some of the 
humidity from my lips while smoking, causing my lips to feel like they 
are going to stick to the stem, which they didn't really.  They di feel 
fairly dry when I had finished my smoke though.  It certainly
feels odd compared to the acrylic mouthpieces I'm used to on my briars.  

I'd like to hear any comments that anyone has regarding clays?  I've noticed 
that clay pipes aren't talked about very often.

[NUPTIAL] Dr. and Mrs. Masticola have returned from a very pleasant
honeymoon in Nova Scotia; more on that this issue.  And many, many
thanks to the members who wrote to my bride, Jean, with wishes of
goodwill!  (And as for the wag who suggested that she make me smoke
out on the porch -- well, if I weren't a gentleman to the core, I'd
challenge you to a rendezvous on the Field of Honour. Straight
Perique, sir, at one pace! &gt;;-) 

Seriously, though, thanks to all for your support!

[SNAPPY COMEBACKS] Those of our readers who make it to the end of the
issues may have noticed the ripostes for rude antismokers which have
appeared there for the last umpty-ump issues.  Well, the sad truth is
that I'm about to run out of the official ones from the cited book --
at least the ones that were any good. :-) So, if you've got a good
one, send it in!  I'll pick one an issue, and acknowledge the source. 

[BICENTENNIAL] We've made it to the 200th issue, folks!  And there are
still quite a few of us who were there from the very beginning, in the
prehistory before there was a Cigar Aficionado, or a Web, or an alt
hierarchy, or any of our other modern conveniences.  Since Pipes
Digest #100, we've multiplied our membership many times over, and been
at the forefront of some really exciting activity.  It's been good,
and we look forward to many more issues!

[MISSING PERSONS] Speaking of people who were here from the very
beginning, does anyone know what happened to that wascally Bill
Thacker?  His mail started bouncing one day with "User unknown."  If
you know, please write.  We miss him.

But for now, as the rain stops for the first time in days, we take
this opportunity to load up with C&amp;D's vanilla Cavendish, open the
screen door, listen to the crickets cricking for what will surely be
one of the last times this season, and

				Smoke in peace,

Hi Steve:

This is a reply to the following: 

[ Stephen Thomas asks for a replacement for Craven's; see PD #199. -S. ]

----------------------------------
Try  Alfred &amp; Christian Peterson's Grand Reserve Melange #466 with the Green
label ("superb balance of latakia-virginia and oriental tobaccos." This is
in fact a whole lot better than Cravens IMHO. It tastes like Cravens but is
better, if that makes any sense. It "out Cravens Cravens" to push a point.

I have talked to a lot of tobacconists and most have _never_ heard of A &amp; C
Petersons. You can order it from the Cigar Warehouse in Sherman Oaks,
California. Larry stocks it. It is superb quality and will satisfy the
connoisseur who craves Cravens.

Dear Steve:
			I should like to thank you first for my
inclusion in the Pipe Digest, wich I find very, very interesting. My
thanks double for your intro_ duction and directory you send me with
the first issue recieved.
	I want to send a help call to all attendants to the list for
ideas in founding a Pipe Club here in B.A. As incredible as it could
sound there is none in a city of ten millon people (or more) like
this.
	If any member or Pipe Club wants to send it, I should be most
grateful if someone send me a copy of the founding chart or statutes
ruling a Pipe Club, so I can take them as model and reference.
	My post adress is:

						Enrique J. Aramburu
						Cabrera 4864 2F
						1414 Buenos Aires
						ARGENTINA

	Thanks to you all!

<a name="3">Subject: Tobacco shop in New Orleans</a>

I've been lurking for too long; it's time to contribute something to the list.

My favorite tobacco store here in New Orleans is the Epitome.  They are 
located at 729 St. Louis Street, next to Antoine's in the French Quarter.  
They are a dealer for Dunhill and they have a variety of pipes in all price 
ranges.

They have a large selection of tobaccos, too.  If you like sweet, cased 
cavendish types, you'll love this shop.  Their most popular tobacco is 
French Market Blend, a cavendish with a hint of vanilla flavoring. My wife 
bought me a packet of this for Christmas, and my initial reaction was "too 
sweet" (I normally smoke English mixtures).  But I didn't want to throw it 
away, so I kept it around and smoked some now and then; it grew on me, and 
has become one of my favorites.

If you like English blends, you won't find a lot of choices here.  But the 
one they do carry is very nice.

They do mail order also, and they have a toll-free number: 1-800-233-8907.  
But you've been wanting to visit the French Quarter anyway, haven't you?

[ Always glad to hear of shops in popular vacation spots! Thanks,
Gerald! -S. ]

&gt;I'm on a quest for the ultimate cheap cigar. The specs are under 2 bucks,
&gt;fatish like a high 40 to 50, length is not much of an issue. Smoothness is a
&gt;prime consideration--AVOs being the model. OK ladies and gentlemen you have
&gt;been briefed.  

My recommendation is the Licenciados Excelentes, a Lonsdale rated 89 by
Cigar Aficianado.  I get them at Georgetown Tobacco in DC for about $1.75.
(C.A. got theirs for $1.60, but Georgetown is expensive.)

You can pick and choose from the Arturo Fuente cigars.  I've never gotten
one I didn't like.

&gt; I'd like to hear any comments that anyone has regarding clays?  I've noticed 
&gt; that clay pipes aren't talked about very often.

I have smoked many clay pipes, and I love them, even though they do seem
to burn very hot.  (They may not actually burn hotter than briar, but the
outside of the bowl gets much hotter.)  The main disadvantage to clay pipes
is their fragility, which they make up for by being inexpensive.

I do especially like the long, churchwarden clays.  The long stem delivers
a nice cool smoke.  They are difficult to clean, however.

<a name="7">Subject: The Bed and Breakfast Circuit</a>

Well, as I hinted before, my bride and I have returned from a two-week
tour of Nova Scotia, doing the country inn/B&amp;B thing the whole time.
Since I've been trying for some time (without much luck) to accrue a
list of pipe and cigar friendly B&amp;Bs, I thought the members might
appreciate my observations.

The truth, though, is that there aren't too many of 'em. The B&amp;Bs seem
to be generally an antismoking lot.  And, although Nova Scotia is
reported to be a home to puffins, I'm glad I didn't see any of them.
If I had encountered one, after three thousand miles of cutesy "No
Puffin" signs, I might have been tempted to thoughts of avicide...

But there were exceptions. Here's the report, in alphabetical order:

				-=-=-

BEE AND THISTLE INN, Old Lyme, CT: Smoking allowed downstairs,
ashtrays in evidence, but no one taking advantage.  Spectacular view
of estuary in the back, which was a good place to sit out with a pipe
and watch the birds. Expensive.

BLUE ROCKS ROAD, Lunenberg, NS: Flowering tobacco plants on the front
walk had a wonderful scent, and gave us reason for hope.  However, the
place also had the no-puffin sign _plus_ a framed bit of doggerel in
the hall inviting smokers to leave the premises.  Otherwise, very
nice; the hosts were accomodating and the breakfasts were hot and
wonderful.  Blue Rocks is the model of a picturesque fishing village,
and the breakfast was excellent. Bike shop in the back.

DUFFUS HOUSE, Baddeck, NS: The odious bird in evidence, but only on
the proprietor's desk.  Outdoor porch on side, sans ashtrays.
Otherwise, both the inn and Baddeck are nice places from which to see
Cape Breton.  (As an aside, we took a day trip to a company called
Glendora [near Mabou], which claimed to be the "only single-malt
Scotch distillery in North America." Sadly, they had just started up
five years ago, and can't actually _sell_ any whiskey for two more
years! However, the scenery at the Mabou Mines, [once we'd _found_ it,
a task in itself!] more than made up for the distillery
disappointment, though.)

LARSEN'S LOG LODGE, Milville, NB: Enthusiastically recommended! Guests
are, as the front door says, "free to smoke outside," and Mary Anne
Larsen has thoughtfully provided smoking stands for that purpose.  On
our first night, when we arrived much later than we'd expected, she
greeted us (at 11:00 PM!) with hot cider and cookies.  She keeps her
operation small and bends over backwards to make her guests feel
comfortable and welcome.

We cancelled our planned stay in Fredericton on the trip back to stay
there instead, and had a T-bone steak dinner, with all the trimmings
(including fiddleheads and a delicious ice-cream sundae!) for $10
Canadian. The rooms are, likewise, inexpensive, and include Jacuzzis.

Their address is: Larsen's Log Lodge, Milville, NB E0H 1M0 CANADA;
phone (506) 463-2731.  Tell Mary Anne that you heard about it on the
Pipes Digest! (And no; I'm not taking a kickback :-)

MOUNTAIN LAKE INN, Henniker, NH: Allowed smoking indoors.  We picked
this place because we'd had a pleasant time there in 1993.  However,
it has since changed owners and gone into an apparently terminal
tailspin. Not recommended.

PLANTERS BARRACKS, Wolfville, NS: We stayed there to see the Bay of
Fundy and the tidal bore. This was the only place we stayed which
featured large, obnoxious antismoking signs in the guest rooms. I made
a deal with the hosts: I wouldn't light up in the bedroom if they
wouldn't push their signs in my face. Thus, I hid the thing behind a
wash basin.

However, the sign was just one of several signal of the hosts'
indifference to our well-being. I wouldn't recommend this place.
(Notable nearby features: the Bay of Fundy and a friendly female
llama.)

SALMON RIVER HOUSE, Head of Jeddore, NS:  The circle-slash-puffin
again.  However, the river plus an Adirondack chair made a welcome
place for a pipe.  Featured a great blue heron which had the maddening
habit of posing for a picture, then disappearing when I went for the
camera. 
				-=-=-

I hope that someday I can find _some_ B&amp;B or inn which features a
comfortable indoor smoking room.  Some place where a guest could enjoy
a quiet bit of tobak, without offending the other guests or being
offended by them.  A place with, say, wood paneling, a fireplace,
leather chairs, and many a quaint and curious volume to peruse in
leisure hours.  Potential innkeepers, take note; I firmly believe
there's a market for such a place. A place where one could retire with
a glass of (extant!)  single-malt Scotch and a favorite cigar or pipe,
to relax among like-minded friends and

				Smoke in peace,
				~\U Steve.

Hello Steve and fellow smokers:

     This is my sad story about my experience with Cuban Cigars.  A friend
of mine was going on a cruise and I asked him to pick me up a few Cubans.
Being a resourceful person, he removed the bans and put them in a seperate
compartment in his suitcase.  He numbered each cigar and ban for later
identification.  

     We met at a business meeting a week later and were sitting in the
Embassy Suites Hotel in Bellevue Washington.  I had a selection of a Cohiba
Robusto, a Bolivar Corona Extra, a H.Upmann Lonsdale, and a Partagas No. 1;
Cuban's one and all.  As a side comment, they were great cigars, but no
worth the money and effort.  I had begun collecting cigar bans from cigars I
had smoked, and placing them in my "Cigar Aficionado" BUYING GUIDE TO
PREMIUM CIGARS.  I smoked the Cohiba the first night and upon returning to
my room the second day, I discovered, much to my suprise, that the  maid had
tossed my bans (carefully placed on the table in a plastic bag) in the
trash.  What was strange was, she left the snipe of the cigar in the
ashtray, but tossed the bans.

    Now my collection is less that complete, and I can not prove that I
actually smoked them.  I have managed to find and smoke 31 of 107 brands
listed in the book and it has become my hobby to find the missing labels.
My personal favorate smoke is a Hoyo De Monterry (Honduras) Excalibur No. 1.
I just finished a Licenciados Toro which was rate 93 and lived up to its
rating.  Word of advice, never leave anything out in a room you could do
without.  ???????@?????.???.  

[ Could be worse; she could have tossed the cigars! -S. ]

Steve,
Could you please post this in the Digest?  And of course, you are invited 
to join as well!!!

You are cordially invited to join the

		 ORGANIZATION OF ONLINE PIPE SMOKERS
			       (OoOPS).

OoOPS is a sort of on-line pipe club, with members sharing information
about pipes and tobacco via e-mail.  Basically, if you choose to join,
you will be sent a Member's Directory / Newsletter every month.  Each
member in the Directory (including yourself) lists some information
about his interests and expertise.  You can use the Directory to find
folks who have what you want or want what you have, and they can find
you.  You can use the list to find people who know what you want to
know.

Then, you can e-mail one another, without sending a message like "Does
anybody out there know about Charatans?," hoping that your post is read
by people who might help you in time for it to actually help you.
Instead, you just write directly to your fellow club-members who have
already offered to help people who want to know about Charatans. You get
a personal response from people who are more likely to actually respond
(e-mail is hard to miss most of the time).

Your entries in the Member Directory can be updated if your interests
change, and the new Directory will be sent out each month (via e-mail)
with a short newsletter.  Your data in the Member Directory can also
list information about any pipes you would like to buy or sell and
tobaccos you would like to try or give away.  This will allow members to
contact one another and arrange such swaps more easily.
This is not meant to replace Pipes Digest or the alt.smokers.pipes
newsgroup, or any other message board (such as on AOL or CompuServe),
but rather to supplement them.

By the way, there are no dues, fees, obligations, or taxes of any kind
involved in being a member.  Your personal information will not be given
or sold to anyone other than the other members of the OoOPS group.

If you are interested in being a charter member, just e-mail me 
(preferred address is ????????@????.???) with a filled-in version of the 
membership form below (take as much space a needed). The charter issue of 
the Member Directory will be compiled by me and sent out via e-mail on 
October 15.  It is hoped that a web-page for the group will also be ready 
by then.

<a name="12">Subject: Filling the lab with the delicate aroma</a>

  I consider myself lucky to have what seems to be one of the last workplaces
where i can smoke. I'm a chemist at a steel mill. Some 20 years ago, there
would have been six chemists --and no computers-- analyzing steel in the
manufacturing process. Now technology has reduced my crew to two chemists and
a dozen computers. I usually smoke a cavendish in a Savanelli bent. I'm leary
of smoking better pipes at work as occasional stress can take a toll on the
briar. One type of sample comes to the lab via a pneumatic tube system --much
like you would use in a banking transaction. The guys sampling for me usually
know within minutes when i'm analyzing, as a faint, lovely smell returns with
the empty carrier! 
  I learned to smoke a pipe with a professor in graduate school. Despite his
esteemed scientific reputation, he began to be barred from smoking in many
labs and buildings. His wife also complained about the holes in the pockets
of his tweed jackets from stowing his still-burning pipe, so he gave up the
habit after some 40 years of pleasure. It was a sad day when he carted his
pipe collection from the office area we shared.
  The PD has been a wonderful expansion of my pipe-smoking world. I've tried
some of the recommended tobaccos; i can usually tell from my partner's face
whether they'll be tolerated --the English blends aren't. Thanks for
reformatting the PD for AOL folks. Downloading one file is much faster and
easier than the several "email" documents. And there PD is, right next to my
downloaded New York Times articles! 
Happy Honeymoon......

Steve,

Congratulations and a nice honeymoon.
I got my golden handcuff in December, but there was no time yet for a real
honeymoon. However, we take a few days off every nowand then, and in a few
years it should add up.
More in topic of the list: I ordered a handmade pipe from the owner
of my favorite pipe shop here in Bonn. Four years ago I bought one of
his pipes on display and it is still one of my favoured. To carve(w?) pipes
is kind of a side-job of the shop owner. I wanted him to make kind of a hybrid
between Stanwell No. 165 and No. 185. He estimated about DM 300 or USD 200,
including best wood and a ring(w?) {isn't there an english pipe dictionary}.
The reason for ordering this pipe is again off topic: I got my PhD in
April (radioastronomy).

cheers
 Martin

Thank you very much for the job done, even if I only have been a
reader and not an active participant to the digest.  I am not fluent
enough in english to be able to describe precisely my impressions when
smoking... :-( Anyway this doesn't prevent me from appreciating the
Peterson's Sherlock Holmes I recently purchased, that I smoke with the
"Resolution" tobaco by Stokkeybe. And that's what's important.

By the way, on the metal ring I can read : Peterson's Sterling silver,
and below a small square, "925" and a balance (it seems) Does that
mean that it is silver ? I don't think so.  And what could I do to
permanently remove the oxydation on the ring ?

I'm quitting my job, and then would like to unsubscribe from the list
until I have my new e-mail.

Thank you,
bye until I'm back on the net !

For all our American friends on the New York-Lake Ontario border, a shop
has been located in Kingston just 2 blocks from the Wolfe Island ferry 
docks.Located in the old section of Kingston,Ontario at 155 Wellington 
Street. The shop is a cozy nook in which one may light up and enjoy the 
company of fellow cigar and pipe smokers. Well stuffed chairs are 
available and the proprietor, Mr. Bill Fagan, is well versed on pipecraft.
Bill repairs, as well as carves custom freehand style pipes as well as 
traditional shapes. A walk-in humidor protrudes from the back end of the 
shop and in it one may find a selection of Havana cigars,30 different 
blended pipe tobaccos as well as custom flavoured cigarette tobacco. Bill 
is also into exotic coffees.
Truly a pleasant find while on my vacation. I understand that mail-order 
is an option for those interested.
The shop...
                 The Pipe and Pouch,
                 155 Wellington St.,
                 Kingston, Ontario Canada.
                 K7L 3E1
                 Tele:  (613) 549-4477
Kingston is located about 2 hours east of Toronto.
Cheers, Gord.

Dear Steve,
I haven't written before, but do enjoy the Pipe Digest and 
appreciate all the excellent work you do. Congratulations and best
wishes to you and Jean on your marriage. My wife and I have been
happily married for 31 years, and I've always been an avid, perhaps
too avid, pipe smoker, and she has never been a smoker, so this may
be a good sign.

As for the request for a clone of Craven's Mixture, Craig Tarler, 
who I am pleased to see has become a regular contributer to PD, has
one called Yale Mixture. For those who may not know it, he is the 
President of Cornell &amp; Diehl, and does a mail-order business in fine
tobacco at very reasonable prices. As he is a gentleman, and doesn't
toute his business with every post to the PD, let me give his e-mail
address: ???@???.???. I notice his e-mail address in the PD is 
???@???.???.???, which may be his personal, not business address. 
IMHO, his service matches (no pun intended) the quality of his many
blends: terrific. I'm smoking a bowl of his Continental Air as I 
type this. People stop me in the street and ask what it is that 
smells so good. 

Cheers to you and yours, and greetings to all sotweed devotees!

     Dear Steve,
     
     I am an avid collector and smoker of very large pipes and cigars.
     How do I get onto alt.smokers.pipes from AOL?  Since this is such a 
     limited field of interest, I am trying everything I can to get more 
     information on large pipes, and people who smoke them.  Hopefully by 
     talking with other big pipe smokers, I will be able to find some new 
     sources of pipes and other helpful information along the way.  I very 
     much enjoy pipe and cigar talk, so I am always looking for 
     correspondence with other pipe and cigar smoking devotees.
     
     Any information that you can forward would be really appreciated!
     
     Happy Smoking,

Hello Steve and fellow pipe smokers!

And by the way congratulations Steve!

I've been reading the Digest since november 94, and thought that I
finally should introduce myself. Really don't know why I haven't done
it before. I guess the main reason is that I have been a "little" bit
afraid of trying to express my self in English. Well here I go.

I'm a 26 year old Norwegian, studying microelectronics and VLSI at
University of Oslo. I'm currently working on my Cand Scient thesis, I
think it is about equal to a master degree in the US.

I began pipe smoking at the age of 14. I've had a couple of years as a
cigarett smoker as well, but the "fun" part of smoking has always been
the pipe!  Through my 12 yaers as a pipe smoker, I have tried several
blends of tobacco. In the last couple of years I have found the blends
that has become my favourite. It is aromatic mixtures of the Danish
brand "My Own Blend". Especially "MC13", but also "1970", "OB89" and
"16V". These tobaccos are worthwhile trying if you like sweet smelling
and tasting aromatics.

I have about 10 pipes and use 6 of them. A small collection just
waiting to grow... . My favourit pipes are a Brebbia and a Bari. These
two pipes give me really enjoyable smoking. The four others are cheap
and no good, bought at a time when knowledge and founds where
shourt. I still live on a small budget, but buy pipes when I have
saved enough money. My favourite shapes are Lovat, Bulldog and "short"
Billiards. I prefer straight stems, because they are both easy to
clean and look's good.

Well, that's it for now folks. Light up an enjoy!

<a name="32">Subject: A couple of questions</a>

Hey there, fellow pipe smokers.  I have a couple of questions 
for the PD community:
	First of all, I have noticed some differences between aromatic
and non-aromatic tobacco besides the obvious one of flavour.  It seems
that when I smoke aromatic tobacco, I have problems with unattractive
gurgling sounds in my pipe, particularly towards the end of a bowl.
Also, there is a certain amount of wet tobacco left in the bowl that
is unsmokable.  Is this because of the additives in aromatic tobacco?
What are those additives?  It seems like aromatic tobacco is moister
to start with, even sticky sometimes.  I don't really trust tobacco
that is sticky.  What's the deal?  Also, one of the types of aromatic
tobacco that I have enjoyed (although, on the whole, I enjoy the
non-aromatic oriental stuff more) is called black cavendish.  Now some
of the black cavendish I've sampled has been very sweet, moist, and
sticky, while other samples have been drier and less odiferous.  Also,
I have seen other tobacco labelled "cavendish" which hasn't been black
at all (does "Dutch Cavendish" ring a bell?).  What's the difference?
Why does aromatic tobacco burn hotter?
	Secondly, I hear (I mean read) a lot of folks talking about
pre-19-something Dunhills.  I just bought a used Dunhill at a Flea
market for $2.  It's both a beautiful smoking and looking pipe, with a
nice tight grain and lots of birds-eye.  How can I tell how old it is?
Although I am somewhat of a collector, I really only classify my pipes
by how nice they look and how well they smoke.  I'm starting to think
it would be nice to know some more information about my pipes, if only
so that I could brag about them to other pipe smokers I might meet.
For example, I have three Petersons and, although they're all
attractive-looking, one of them doesn't smoke all that well.  I have
another labelled "Algor" which looks kind of funny, but smokes
beautifully.  Can someone recommend some literature that might contain
useful information about lesser known brands?
				Thanks, Tim Ramsay

<a name="33">Subject: good inexpensive cigars</a>

Well having happily braved a flurry of EMAIL regarding good, relatively
cheap cigars, I thought I'd report back with an overview. Thanks to all who
sent in their suggestions and I hope you don't mind if share your thoughts
with PD.

The parameters were: high 40's to 50's ring size, length not to important,
AVO like in mildness.

1. "IMHO the best cheap cigar is the La Unica
which is a Fuente bundled cigar.  It comes in both maduro and natural.  I
pay around $30 (a little more or less depending on size) for a bundle of 20.
The La Unica is a dominician cigar.  I have not found a Good cheap honduran
cigar.  I usually stick with Excaliburs."

2. "One of our quests is to find the perfect $1.00 cigar and I believe we
have a few  
that might fit that description.  You said to use Avos as a  
model--which one Avo has at least seven shapes all of which taste  
different?  Judging from your default, the HDM Rothschlide I'm  
guessing Avo Belecosos  or its little brother the petite belecosos.   
Using those two, I might suggest Don Juan Robustos ($1.25), Old  
Fashioned Dominicana No.32 ($1.50)???, Bacarat (watch out for the  
sweet gum on the wrapper), Old Fashioned Jamaicans ($1.10).  

Another hint, for smoother cigars age them at least six months in a  
Spanish cedar humidor, it can turn a Don Diego into a work of art." 

3. "I read your comments in Pipe Digest #199, requesting info on good cigars
that 
could be had for $ 2.00 or less a piece. One cigar that I enjoy immensely
and is 
quite reasonable in price is sold by Mr. Robert C. Hamlin of PCCA. 

He is on compuserve and runs a mail order business. Bob is a honorable man and 
runs a good business. He has contributed to the pipe digest on numerous 
occasions, as well, he contributes greatly to the Cigar and Pipe forum on 
compuserve. His email address is ?????.??@??????????.???

Anyway, these cigars, called PS Cigars(Private Stock, I think?) are
actually Davidoff seconds. I don't think I have to tell you just how
expensive Davidoffs are. After having smoked over a hundred of these
cigars, I have never had a bad one. The only thing I can find wrong
with them is the color of the wrappers may vary from cigar to
cigar. Currently I smoke a 6 X 48rg that is absolutely delightful,
although he has many sizes available and his prices will fit right in
with what you are looking for."

4. "My recommendation is the Licenciados Excelentes, a Lonsdale rated 89 by
Cigar Aficionado.  I get them at Georgetown Tobacco in DC for about $1.75.
(C.A. got theirs for $1.60, but Georgetown is expensive.)

You can pick and choose from the Arturo Fuente cigars.  I've never gotten
one I didn't like."

5. "Hoyo de Monterrey Exquisito #50.  This is a bundled cigar that I get
from J*R
Cigar (1-800-JR-CIGAR). I've only seen them offered mail order through J*R.
Size is 6x50. It comes in both EMS and maduro wrappers, and I prefer the EMS.
Price from J*R is $30 for a bundle of 25, which works out to $1.20 per cigar.
This is a full bodied cigar, with hints of chocolate, probably comparable to
the HdM Rothschilds that you smoke. It's my favorite everyday, working in the
yard type cigar.

Hoyo de Monterrey Excalibur #3. I usually smoke the #1 or the #2, but the #3
falls into your parameters of under $2. The actual cost from J*R is $39 per
box of 20, which works out to $1.95 per cigar. Size is 6x50, and it comes in
either natural or maduro wrapper. A milder and smoother smoke than the
Exquisito #50, probably compares favorably to the Avo. I have a friend who
likes the Avo #5, and he really enjoys the Excalibur #1.

Vueltabajo Robusto. Size is 4.5x50 and only comes in natural. Cost from J*R
is $42 for a box of 25 ($1.68 per cigar). A well made cigar with a smooth,
complex, almost vanilla like flavor. FWIW, I've also smoked the Vueltabajo
Churchill and for some reason, it didn't have the same flavor."

6. "Try macanudo prince phillips they are about $28 for a box of 10.
(hey not under 2 bucks but if you smoke avo's, these are bargains)."

And to this list I'll add Licenciados Churchill seconds from Mike's Cigars,
a great cigar. I have no idea why these are seconds. 

Thanks again everybody.

Robin

<a name="35">Subject: Pipe Makers</a>

Steve, congratulations on your marriage.  One trusts you have had a great
honeymoon and that it consisted of visiting more places than all the pipe
shops within visiting distance of wherever you went.
 
I'd like to share the following article with you and the Digest readers.
It appeared in the September issue of the Ohio Pipe Collectors newsletter.
I encourage anyone who would like to join our club (currently 65 members)
or to receive a complimentary copy of the newsletter to write me.--Bill

OHIO PIPEMAKERS: NUMBER TWO IN A SERIES
 
                   STEPHEN AND ROSWITHA ANDERSON
 The Artisans
 
     Steve and Roswitha Anderson, fulltime Ohio pipemakers, live in
Columbus, where Steve was born and raised.  Steve, the son of an electrical
engineer and woodworker with whom Steve began working at a young age,
started smoking pipes at 15 and nurturing the idea that he would like to
make pipes someday.  While serving in the U.S. Army in Germany in the early
1960s, Steve used his free time to travel and visit as many European
pipemakers as he could, questioning them about their methods and examining
their tools and machinery.
 
     Roswitha, a native German, had undertaken four years of schooling and
apprenticeship as a seamstress/clothing designer, a career for which she
was unable to find work when she finished. So she went to work in a
children's home--the very one Steve's unit later "adopted" and provided
with the hardboiled eggs for a traditional Easter egg hunt.  Steve, the
unit's translator, spoke German.  Roswitha knew nothing about pipes, but
she soon learned because many of her dates with Steve involved his
continuing hunt for European pipe manufacturers to study.
 
     Steve and Roswitha married in 1964 and returned to the States in 1965.
Steve resumed his old job at Western Electric, but he and Roswitha
continued collecting information about pipemaking.  In these years, the
U.S. still contained many small pipemaking factories, and the Andersons
traveled "tens of thousands of miles" to visit them and to make offers for
their unused tools.  Other tools were hand forged to their specifications.
A great influence on them and one of the most helpful of the pipemakers
they visited was Andre Mermet, who Steve calls "a great pipemaker."
Mermet made all the Wilke pipes as well as pipes for the military.
 
     In the late 60s, Steve and Roswitha began making pipes under the S&amp;R
symbol--which is an S in the form of a pipe with smoke coming out of it and
an R superimposed through it.  In those days, Steve and Roswitha would
travel to as many as 25 craft shows a year and produce about 2,000 pipes,
90% of them "cheap" (in the $15-20 range) because, Steve says, "that's what
people were buying."  But the rat race started to get to them and, facing
burnout, they started cutting back.  Today they do about seven shows a year
and produce 500-600 pipes of a much higher grade, ranging in price from $35
to $250.  The most expensive pipe they have ever made and sold was a
seven-day straight-grain set in a hand-crafted box that sold immediately
for $5400.
 
     Steve Anderson creates the more traditional pipe shapes produced by
S&amp;R Wood Crafts: Pipes &amp; Pleasures.  He enjoys researching historical pipe
literature and ads for forgotten pipe shapes that he can recreate in his
workshop.  Roswitha uses her design background to conceive and carve their
line of freehand pipes.  She is possibly the only fulltime woman custom
pipemaker in the world.
 
     For years, the Andersons observed the tradition of many Old World
Masters and lived above their 1,000-square-foot shop, which features a
well-stocked retail outlet in the front (their pipes and other pipe lines,
tobacco, accessories and a cigar humidor). Behind it is their even larger
3,000-square-foot workshop, which is filled with all the machines and tools
of their trade, half- finished pipes and many hundreds of briar blocks
waiting to be carved.  Recently, however, they became tired of the Old
World crowding and purchased a house to spread out in.
 
     Over the years, the Andersons' work has received more than 25 awards
for excellence.  In 1984, Pipe Collectors International chose Steve and
Roswitha to produce the 1985 collector club pipe. These pipes, individually
numbered and stamped with the PCI logo, were distributed to PCI members all
over the world.  The Andersons competed with nine of the largest European
pipe companies and two large U.S. companies for the honor.  They were the
first American pipemakers ever chosen to produce a PCI collector pipe.
 
     Early in 1985, the Andersons flew to Saint-Claude, France, where Steve
was inducted into the Confrerie des Maitres-Pipiers de Saint-Claude, France
(the Brotherhood of Master Pipemakers of Saint-Claude, France) at its 70th
meeting.  Saint-Claude is usually recognized as the birthplace of the briar
pipe.  The Brotherhood, which dates from the late 1700s, is the only world-
wide organized pipemakers' guild.  It is presided over by the Master
Pipemakers, all direct descendants of the original pipemakers of
Saint-Claude.  The Brotherhood is limited to persons who have been
recognized for their contributions to the pipe industry.  Members must be
invited to join--they cannot apply.  Steve Anderson's signature is now
written in the golden book of the Brotherhood, a book that also dates from
the Brotherhood's founding.  His presentation pipe is now displayed in the
permanent collection of the pipe museum at Saint-Claude.
 
     When I asked Steve and Roswitha what ideal, in terms of craftsmanship
and smoking qualities they strive for, they couldn't confine themselves to
a single answer.  Steve still regards Andre Mermet as a great pipemaker,
and they expressed admiration for the pipes of Mike Butera in the U.S. and,
in England, of Barry Jones, who owns Upshall and used to turn the old
Charatan bowls, and Les and Dolly Woods, who make Ferndowns. Steve believes
that U.S. pipemaker J.T. Cooke is a "fantastic artisan" and "perhaps the
best pipemaker in the U.S. today--maybe in the world."  They also spoke
with awe of some of the work being done in Japan, especially the Tsuge
pipe.
 
     Both Steve and Roswitha are pipe smokers, and both like Esoterica
tobaccos.  Steve's favorite is Pembroke, while Roswitha prefers And So to
Bed.
 
     Steve somehow finds the time and energy to work as an unpaid video
producer, director and camera man for the Columbus public access television
station.  He has spoken of his desire to produce a pipemaking video, a
project that many pipe smokers would like to see him accomplish.
 
The Pipes
 
     S&amp;R pipes are all made from the highest grade of Mediterranean briar,
which the Andersons bring back themselves from New York when a consignment
arrives so as to avoid careless handling of the rough-cut blocks in
shipment.  Once in their shop, the briar blocks are air cured for a minimum
of two years before the Andersons begin selecting the blocks to be made
into pipes.  Steve and Roswitha have separate work spaces, with most of the
same tools duplicated in each.  Roswitha designs all the S&amp;R freehand
shapes and helps out with the traditional shapes, but Steve does all the
drilling and mortise work because he's so good at it.
 
     When one examines the S&amp;R workshop, it appears highly mechanized.
Many of the Andersons' boring and cutting machines have been hand-forged to
their specifications; others they purchased from the old pipe firms
discovered in their travels. However, the machinery is only an aid to speed
the process of boring, drilling and shaping the rough briar blocks.  The
final product is carved and finished by hand, and the artistic paneling or
detailing makes each pipe unique even though it may have a traditional
shape.
 
     Steve Anderson is proud of his sandblasting work, which he has given a
lot of thought to and has taught to many other pipemakers.  In Europe,
sandblasted pipes have traditionally been tumbled together in a large drum
while being blasted, which does not produce uniform results.  The
Andersons' sandblasting setup occupies an entire room to itself.  Before
sandblasting one of their pipes, the Andersons carefully mask off various
parts of it in order to produce exactly the effect they want.
 
     The Andersons carefully inspect every pipe between each step of its
making.  If a serious flaw appears, the pipe is discarded. S&amp;R high-grade
pipes come with one of three finishes:
 
     ~    A smooth finish for pipes made of flawless briar.  Some of these
pipes are rubbed with an oil finish, but most are stained to highlight the
grain.
 
     ~    A sandblast, for pipes with minor surface flaws.
 
     ~    A Coral Rock finish, which is a pipe that is first carved with a
hand-made cutter and then etched (blasted) with glass beads.  This process
brings a very fine, spider-web-like grain back out from the carving.
 
     Steve and Roswitha began dating their high-grade pipes (those that
cost over $35) in 1985.  Using a base of 50, they stamp each S&amp;R pipe with
a two-digit number.  Thus a pipe stamped "45" would be made in 1995.  They
do not date their carved pipes, which retail below $35.
 
     Steve and Roswitha Anderson--artisans, OPC members and extremely nice
people--can be contacted at 4244 East Main St., Columbus, OH 43213 or call
(614) 235-6422.

If you've got one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you've got more than
one, you're a pipe collector.

Dear Steve -

Well, we just had our West Coast Pipe &amp; Cigar Expo a couple of weeks ago.
 And what a show it was!  I'll write more about it later, but I just
wanted to let everyone know that we're in production on a video of the
Expo.  When it's ready I hope you won't mind if I put in a plug for
it.  In the meantime I wanted to pass along the following excerpt from
the latest Southwest Pipe &amp; Cigar League newsletter.  The first item
should be of interest to everyone, while the second is aimed more at
the PD subscribers in California.  I would also like to ask our
subscribers to get the word out on all this stuff!

Best Regards,

			      LEGISLATIVE ALERT

	As you probably know, our dear president Clinton has proposed
new measures to crack down on teen smoking.  These measures involve
the FDA (of course), which has wanted to regulate nicotine as a drug.
Now that Clinton and FDA head control-freak David Kessler have teamed
up, the push is under way to try and build public support for these
measures.  Fact is, the public support ain't there, but that won't
stop them from trying to take us further down the road towards tobacco
prohibition.  Although the target has been specifically stated as
cigarettes only, make no mistake - if this goes through pipe tobacco
and cigars WILL end up being on the list later on.

	Reason I mention all this is that the public comment period is
open until November 9, 1995.  I URGE ALL OF YOU TO WRITE TO THE FDA
AND TELL THEM THAT YOU OPPOSE THEIR REGULATION OF TOBACCO.  You can
send your letters to:

Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305)
Food &amp; Drug Administration, Room 1-23
12420 Parklawn Drive
Rockville, MD  20857

Your letter MUST reference Docket #95N-0253-J.  Put the docket number at the
top of your letter.  PLEASE BE SURE TO GET YOUR LETTERS TO THE FDA BEFORE 
NOVEMBER 9!  Also, for good measure you should write to your elected
officials in Washington about this.  Kessler is seeking nothing less than
police powers for the FDA, and given the Agency's expansion of power under
his leadership I don't think I need to tell you about the implications of FDA
involvement in regulating (read "banning") tobacco.  SO WRITE TODAY!

[ I'll write in on HFA-305, Steve. Thanks for the pointer! And, BTW, I
saw that the latest issue of NML photos feature a pipe made by a
fellow named "S. Johnson." Any relation? :-) -S. ]

Steve

I'm moving my E-mail and internet access from Delphi.com to Halcyon, so my 
new address is: ????????@???????.???.  This isn't an easy move, I've been 
at Delphi for 2 years now and have made some good friends there.  But the 
slowness of their News server, as well as the way they have dragged their 
feet on introducing their new interface, I've waited well over a year.

This move has also been fairly exciting, the downloading of new software 
and getting to know how to use it.  It's a far cry from using Delphi's 
interface and their software.  The complications with using seperate mail, 
news, web, telnet and FTP software, getting it all working together is both 
fustrating and invigorating.

Now that the formalities are out of the way let me congratulate you on your 
marriage.  I wish you all the happiness in the world.  I only hope that it 
doesn't keep you from your Pipe Digest duties.  There are three places 
where I find great pipe information, here, ASP, and the Cigar and Pipe 
forum on Compuserve.  Of the three, this is the only one without flames.  I 
used to read ASC, but the signal to noise ratio is just to high there.

My pipe collection is growing daily, well not quite so quick, but it has 
grown.  One of my latest has been a Nording Freehand without a finish.  
After smoking it for awhile it has started to develop a nice patina.  It is 
a rather large piece of briar and that causes it to be heavy in the mouth.  
Also it smokes a tad wet, but the use of pipe cleaners takes care of that.

One of the subjects which I've seen no dicussion of is the qualities of 
various brands of pipe cleaners.  I use BJ Long's for the lucite stems of 
my Italian pipes, which tend to have lips, and Peterson's to clean out the 
shanks.  The Peterson's seem to be thicker and more absorbent than any of 
the others which I have found.  What do you and other use?

A problem I have found is that pipe racks are not built for bents and pipes 
with wide stems.  I've been looking for a large rack with large open holes 
for these pipes.  The complication is that I can' afford to pay a lot for 
it.  If anyone knows where to find such a rack, let me know.

[CIGAR] While in Princeton, look up "A Little Taste of Cuba" (70
Witherspoon St, Princeton NJ 08542; phone (609) 683-8988.)  Jorge
Armenteros, the proprietor, has hit upon a retailing idea which could
spark a revolution: a "cigar parlor."  What this seems to be is a
small storefront shop where one can come in at lunchtime or after
work, buy a 'gar, sit down on a comfortable couch, and puff away,
unmolested by the smoke-cringing Puritans that infest the rest of
Princeton.  Kind of like a seven-day-a-week Bloom's Cigar Camp. The
shop isn't large, and the selection doesn't rival Holt's, but it is a
major source of comfort in a hostile area.

Jorge also carries the Butera line of pipe tobacco, and is working on
building up a line of pipes.  Stop in, and let him know you heard
about it in the Digest! -S.

<a name="3">Subject: Casillas Cigars</a>

I recently visited the Casillas Cigars factory (1221 16th st.) in downtown
Sacramento.  There are two rolling tables set up by the front window, manned
by some very experienced Cuban rollers (they used to work at Tower Cigars
before setting up their own shop).

All cigars are handmade, all but one long filler, using a blend of up to
five different tobaccos.  Most wrappers are Ecudorean maduro, with some
natural Connecticut shade used.  The construction is excellent, with an easy
(but not too loose) draw.  The tobacco is of a high quality, with a medium
bodied, rich blend of flavors.

Sizes ranged from the "Pencil" (36 x 5.5, $1.40), to the "Excalibur" (58 x
8.5, $5).  My favorite is the Rotthschild (46 x 5, $2.30); it has a nice
oily maduro wrapper and a nice blend of flavors; it reminds me of my
favorite smoke, the AF Don Carlos Robusto.

The best part about Casillas is the laid back atmosphere.  You can sit
around and enjoy a smoke and discuss cigars with a master roller as he does
his work.  I brought my boys in to visit, so they could see that cigars were
truly a hand made product.  The folks are very friendly and justifiably
proud of their product.  They have a large humidor/aging room (a former meat
locker), where the finished product is stored in bundles.  Output is in the
low hundreds a day, so don't expect to see these in your local store soon.
But a visit to the factory is recommended to any cigar lover passing through
Sacramento, I'm sure you will find it a very pleasant experience.

<a name="4">Subject: A Few Words</a>

Steve,

First, a belated congratulations.  I haven't been able to read
the last few Pipes Digests due to an enormous workload, but at
least my travels have allowed me to sample a couple Cuban cigars.

The Cubans were a "Romeo y Julieta" and a "Dunhill".  I was a
little surprised by the Dunhill label, but not being well-
versed in cigars, maybe you can help.  There was nothing
distinguished about it, especially compared to the "Romeo y
Julieta" which was (IMHO) terrific.  Please be aware, that was
my very first Cuban.

Now, a question.  Since I seem to be transfering planes in both
Frankfurt and Amsterdam, does anyone know where in the airports
I can find the Cubans for sale?  I've been very rushed and have
not been able to search those airports and they are just not
available at the Helsinki airport.

You raised an interesting point about having a dedicated smoking
room adjacent to non-smoking areas (such as dining and reception).
That would be a terribly civilized and relaxing conclusion to a
meal, something that many of us have considered.  But I rather
doubt that the U.S. culture would support it.  Next time, take
your vacation in Austria.  Stay outside Vienna for country charm
or in one of the numerous places in the oldest part of Vienna.
Then relax in one of the coffee houses.  What you described is
just what you get, as many relaxing hours in an overstuffed chair
with a beer, schnapps, cafe mit schlag, a newspaper, conversation,
peace and quiet, as anyone could ask for.

In fact, Europe just seems more relaxed.  Maybe because the culture
is centuries older, maybe because they don't try to legislate against
Natural Selection.

Best Wishes.

[ Thanks, Brian!  Perhaps the Cubans are no further than the duty free
shop. -S. ]

<a name="5">Subject: Smoking in San Diego; FDA and Kessler</a>

     Steve--Time to thank you once again for the Digest and 
     congratulate you on your nuptials.  I've been subscribed for a 
     little over half a year and always enjoyed seeing the mailing 
     from your address in the mailbox.
     
     I am writing to mention some smoking I enjoyed on ny vacation to 
     San Diego at the end of August.  I went to law school and met my 
     wife there, back in the 80's, so I was already familiar with most 
     of the area's smoke shops.  One of my favorites was Captain 
     Hunt's in Seaport Village (a little tourist shopping center on 
     the water near downtown).  As I mentioned in my introductory post 
     several months ago, my favorite pipe tobacco of all time is an 
     English called "Churchill" which I have found nowhere else (so I 
     believe it's proprietary, although I could be wrong).  I was able 
     to get a pouch and although it is still a great smoke, somehow it 
     had a different character.  Churchill was my first English, and 
     as Richard Hacker wrote, an English can be a bit like smoking 
     meat (which still makes me laugh).  I was wondering if by now 
     (several years of smoking Englishes, later), I have become 
     accustomed to the Latakia and am more appreciative of the other 
     blend constituents?  Or is it possible for a commercial blend to 
     be changed without notice?  Anybody have any thoughts?
     
     On the FDA, Kessler, and some of the commentary from recent 
     Digests, I thought I would add a thought or two.  First, make no 
     mistakes, I am fully aware of the fear that the FDA's attention 
     to tobacco will inevitably lead to total prohibition.  I am 
     somewhat sympathetic to that point of view because there are 
     analogous precedents in other areas (like government promoted 
     censorship).
     
     I think a few mistakes of perception must be mentioned, though.  
     First, in response to Steve J.:  The FDA's regulatory authority 
     is justified under the "police power" of the state.  That 
     authority legally imbues a government with the ability to pass 
     regulations which affect the "health, safety, and welfare" of the 
     populace.  Such regulations are deemed important to the extent 
     that a reviewing court need only find a "rational relationship" 
     (a low legal threshold) between the regulation and the health, 
     safety, or welfare issue that is at stake for a police power 
     regulation to be upheld on challenge.  So Steve is a bit 
     overwrought in suggesting that FDA Commissioner Kessler is 
     seeking police power for the FDA.
     
     Second, while regulation of tobacco might be a "de facto" result 
     of any action by this administration, the regulation at issue 
     concerns the issue of whether a)nicotine is a drug, and b)whether 
     cigarette makers manipulate nicotine content of cigarettes.  The 
     regulation, then, would address the cigarette as a *delivery 
     device* for nicotine, and enable the government to intervene in 
     the selling of the device to (in this case) minors.
     
     The reason I though it important to risk a flame war and bring 
     these points up is that I support the use of public comment to 
     communicate with both legislators and agencies.  Before anyone 
     runs off halfcocked and starts filling my box with expletive 
     mail, let me say one last thing.  I have been smoking pipes and 
     cigars regularly for 17 years or so.  I relish this pleasure and 
     will never relinquish it to someone for their satisfaction at the 
     expense of my own.  However, if you want to effectively take part 
     in the public process, you have to assert yourself credibly or 
     risk being marginalized.  I hope everyone reads my comments in 
     the right spirit.
     
     Sincerely, Dave Hirsh, Seattle, WA. USA

[ A most thoughtful and reasoned commentary, Dave; you seem to know
your subject.  However, under a similar argument, the FDA could
intervene in the sale of cans of Coca-Cola or cups of 7-11 coffee as
"delivery devices" for caffeine.  Even if it is supported by law, the
FDA's assertion of jurisdiction over tobacco is not comforting; they
might, having finished with cigarettes, make the same "delivery
device" assertion about cigars or pipes.

And see the "Quote of the Week" below. -S. ]

&gt;I do especially like the long, churchwarden clays.  The long stem delivers
&gt;a nice cool smoke.  They are difficult to clean, however.

I don't know how widely available they are, but when I bought my
churchwarden, the store also sold super-long pipecleaners especially made
for it...

<a name="7">Subject: Canadian Pipe Shop-Kingston area</a>

Gord Ferguson's assessment of Kingston's The Pipe and Pouch in the last PD
is accurate in all respects but that of the owner's name.  The Pipe and
Pouch is owned by MIKE Fagan, not Bill Fagan.  Bill is Mike's father and
often tends the store when Mike is out on errands.  Interestingly enough,
Mike happens to be on Rex Poggenpohl's list of american pipe makers (said
list immediately preceeds Gord's description of the P and P in last weeks
digest)!  I own several of Mike's pipes and one of them, made of Ethiopian
bubinga wood, is the sweetest smoking pipe in my collection.  It also has
a bowl large enough to eat soup out of- maybe there's a connection? 
Anyway, I heartily second Gord's endorsement of the Pipe and Pouch and
have smoked many a
hand-rolled cigar in one of Mike's overstuffed chairs.

[ Thanks for the clarification; I had his name as Mike in the Guide,
and wanted to confirm that. -S. ]

<a name="8">Subject: Inns For Smokers</a>

Further to your search for B&amp;B's that permit smoking. . .

The Pelican Inn in Muir Beach, CA (in Marin County just north of the Golden
Gate Bridge) is an old British inn with leaded glass windows, thick-timbered
ceilings, low-beamed door, old iron latches, clean white plaster and
well-worn dark wood floors.  It has 5 or 6 guest rooms, each different but
usually including a high or canopied bed, antique sideboards, Olde English
tapestries and decorations, and a sublime view out over the flowered lawn
toward the Muir Woods.  Downstairs is a characterful dining room with long
rough-hewn tables, a huge stone fireplace, and much heavy pewter.  The menu
is unfailingly British and a fine place for lamb, prime rib, and bangers
with stewed tomatoes in the morning.  Off the entry is a small
honest-to-goodness pub, with a healthy selection of ales and stouts.  Some
evenings this pub becomes quite lively with the local Britophiles and
various dart teams, while other times it is a quiet place for a tasty ale
and a chat with the bartender.  And, getting to the point, the inn reserves
a private sitting room for guests, furnished with antique tables, deep soft
chairs, and a roaring fireplace.  On our last stay, although all the guest
rooms were full we were the only ones using the sitting room, where we
played whist and drank ale (the pub being only a door away) while a heavy
rain fell outside.   I recall -- although anyone planning a stay should
double-check!!! -- that smoking was permitted in the private sitting room
and the pub.  As you can tell, this is one of my favorite places in the
whole world and if anyone on the list chooses to stay there I hope it's not
when I need a room.  The only downside, alas, is the price which currently
hovers around $200 a night.  Don't have the phone number but its listed in
Information.

<a name="9">Subject: Another Inn For Smoking</a>

Here's another inn where smoking is permitted.  The Griswold Inn in Essex,
CT, is the oldest inn in the United States, or so they say.  It is a
beautiful old collection of white-sided New England buildings with a variety
of guest rooms ranging from smallish to mediumish, but all filled with charm
and comfort.  The dining room encompasses several large book-lined library
rooms and the menu is very fine.  The adjacent pub has a corner from where
musicians, some rather odd, occasionally play for guests at the several
round tables.  One night the entertainment was some rather proficient
spoon-playing, and I noticed a board behind the bar where regulars
apparently kept their spoons.  The bar itself is large and long and backed
with all manner of liquors, local New England beers and ales, and the
indispensable Guiness Stout.  I don't recall that smoking was permitted in
the guest rooms, although there were no loud signs to that effect, but the
pub is a very pleasant place to idle away an evening, nursing a quiet
pipeful and slowly drawing on a Guiness.  In fact, that is where I was first
introduced to pipe-smoking.

I guess the Griswold is more of an "inn" than a B&amp;B, but the prices are
reasonable and I'd just as soon stay there, with the fine food, good ale,
and mellow company, than at a B&amp;B.

Hello Steve,

  When I opened my e-mail this morning and saw PD #200 waiting for me, I
thought, "Holy mackerel!  Has it been 3 weeks already?"  Checking back to
#199 I saw that indeed it has.  Where does the time go?

  Congratulations on your marriage!  I wish you both a life of joy and
contentment.

  Well, I'm feeling real accomplished.  It took me over 5 months to do so,
but I've finally read all the back issues of the Digest.  Do I get a gold
star or something?  (No, probably not--how would you send a gold star via
e-mail?)  I'm kind of sorry that I'm done, however, because now I don't
have anything to look forward to at the end of a long day when I just
hanging around waiting for my commuter shuttle to pick me up.  Oh well,
maybe I can start over or use the keyword search to read articles on the
same subject or something.

  September has been full of smoking adventures and I though I'd summarize
a couple.  First of all, I was in a local mall shop which consisted of 80
percent gift items (of the pewter, Harley-Davidson,
beautiful-Indian-maiden-with-her-pet-wolf variety) and 20 percent
tobacco-related items.  They had a small humidor and I was picking out a
few premium cigars for my enjoyment, when the sales person pointed out
bundles of Honduran hand-mades that were on sale for $14.95 claiming they
were very good cigars.  I decided to try them, and indeed they are pretty
good--especially when one considers they only cost 60 cents apiece.  I've
smoked $7 cigars that I didn't like as well.  Anyway, the moral of this
story is, I plan on trying bundles again.  Oh sure, the color of the
wrapper doesn't always exactly match, and yes, there may be a blemish on
the wrapper that doesn't show up in a premium, but they smoke well.  So, if
any of the PD readers are looking for an inexpensive, yet good cigar, they
might try buying a bundle from the country of their choice.

  A couple of weeks ago I went to the L.A. Pipe and Cigar Expo.  Steve
Johnson will, no doubt, provide the Digest with a full report.  But let me
just say that I was certainly impressed.  Just imagine a hotel ballroom
full of people from all walks of life coming together because of their
common interest and delight in tobacco and the various ways it can be
smoked.  Lots of pipes on display, lots of cigar manufacturers on hand,
lots of high grade Scotch and Irish whiskeys to be sampled, lots of
friendly people.  I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.  (As an aside, I
saw a play last Friday called 'I Hate Hamlet' in which John Barrymore comes
back from the dead to tutor our hero on playing Hamlet.  The young man asks
Barrymore if one can smoke in heaven.  Barrymore replies,  "Of
course...it's heaven!"  My sentiments exactly.)  I bought myself a couple
of Paul Perri pipes.  These are hand carved by Paul, a retired tobacconist
who still carves mainly as a hobby, out of very nice wood.  I bought 2
pipes for--get this--$92!  I told Paul I thought his prices criminally low
(of course, I said this after I safely tucked my purchases away).  They're
easily worth two to three times what he charges.  Oh well, if he wants to
sell me a hand-carved, straight-grained briar with no visible flaws for
$60, I guess I'll just have to put up with it.

  Anyway, I enjoyed the expo and was sorry I could only stay 5 hours.  I
even missed the banquet (sob).  I highly recommend to anyone in the
vicinity to stop in next year.

  Someone a couple of issues backed asked what the difference was between
'natural' and 'maduro' cigar wrappers.  Although one could quote at length
on the various shades of  wrappers (everything from claro claro to obscuro
maduro), suffice it to say that natural is light to medium brown, and
maduro is dark brown.  Maduro is fermented for a longer period of time
which imparts the darker color and also a more full-bodied flavor.  As a
result, maduro cigars have the reputation of being "strong."  However,
everything is relative, and I've smoked maduros that were quite mellow.

  I guess I've rambled on enough for now.  (My excuse is that I haven't
submitted in a while, so I thought I'd make up for lost time; however, in
all probability, the real reason is that I just like to babble.)  Again,
congrats on your marriage.

[ Thanks! After five weeks, it's still great. :-) -S. ]

Steve,

First, let me send a slightly belated congratulation to you and Jean.  May you 
have many, happy years together.

Next, are there any pipe clubs in the North / Northwest New Jersey or East 
Pennsylvania (i.e. Pocono Mt.) area?  I've seen several cigar clubs in Cigar 
Aficianado, but no Pipe clubs.  I work in central Jersey (Somerset/Piscataway) 
and live up by the Deleware Water Gap, so would like to find a club in that 
general area - New York City is a heck of drive home with no trains available 
:-(.  Please let me know if anyone knows of one.

Finally, I'd like to mention the latest addition to my collection, a Stanwell 
Hans Christian Anderson sandblast.  Purchased at John David, Ltd. in Menlo 
Park Mall, it is a beautiful straight (it actually has a slight curve to it) 
that comes with 2 bits - a smaller, "normal" bit and a churchwarden bit.  
I've always wanted to try a churchwarden, but figured it would not get a lot 
of use and didn't want to invest a lot of money in one since my collection is 
currently rather small.  This pipe solved my dilemma. It smokes wonderfully 
and comes with a special canister and a green Stanwell shopping bag (for the 
wife, as the owner suggested).  It is also available in a very attractive 
smooth, which IMHO looks better in the standard length than the sandblast, but 
the opposite is true as a churchwarden.  I'm looking forward to enjoying it by 
the fire once those winter snows hit.

Thanks for letting me gush...

Smoke in peace,

Jake

Steve, here's another article from the September Ohio Pipe Collectors
newsletter that I'd like to share with you and your subscribers.  Pipemaker
Steve Anderson of S&amp;R, who heard Doug deliver the speech, was the first to
alert me to it.  The OPC now stands at 90 members, but we're still actively
recruiting, and I welcome e-mail requests for information or complimentary
newsletters.
 
A NEW TAKE ON DR. GRABOW
 
     Doug Allen, OPC member and President of Sparta Industries, delivered
the following speech at the 1995 PCI show in St. Louis.  Hearing about it,
I prevailed upon Doug to let it appear in print first in the OPC
newsletter, and he graciously agreed. Reader comments and replies are
encouraged.
 
                     The Honorable Dr. Grabow
 
                            Doug Allen
 
     This evening, gathered with this large group of pipe lovers, I'd like
to honor the greatest of pipes--Dr. Grabow.  Surely, you're saying, I must
have taken leave of my senses to call Dr. Grabow the greatest of pipes.
Well, I've made a claim, so let me try to justify my outrageous statement.
 
     In our country, one measure of greatness has always been size: the
bigger, the better; the more, the merrier.  Dr. Grabow sells nearly one
million pipes a year.  But, you argue, certainly in this case more is not
necessarily merrier.  Simply because the masses smoke a Dr. Grabow doesn't
mean it should be classed as a great pipe. Certainly, you insist, a Dr.
Grabow cannot be judged as comparable to the Mastro de Paja that my good
friend Thomas Cristiano is showing this weekend.  Nor would anyone compare
the collectability of a Dr. Grabow to Steve Anderson's handmades.  Why then
am I standing here talking about Dr. Grabow?  Can it be the construction?
 
     Yes, in many ways the methods of making a Dr. Grabow are exactly the
same as those the fine Italian artisans employ.  Of course there are
differences.  We don't spend as much time sanding a Dr. Grabow as the
Lorenzetti Brothers might, for example.  Our bits, though we use some
lucite, may not be as fancy as Cesare Barontini produces for our
Mastercraft Aldo Velani line.  The most similar feature between a Dr.
Grabow and the exquisite pipes many of you are smoking tonight is the wood.
Every Dr. Grabow pre-smoked pipe starts with exactly the same block of
briar as does your favorite.  Yet this lowly block of wood is why I speak
about the greatness of Dr. Grabow.
 
     Before I finish that thought about Dr. Grabow, let me talk for a few
minutes about the wood.  The White Heather (Erica Arborea) grows in the
sandy soil of the mountains ringing the Mediterranean Sea.  After about
five hot summers and mild winters, a small fibrous growth starts forming
just above the roots.  After many years (even centuries) of growth, the
burl is ready to be harvested.  This harvest is a time-consuming,
back-breaking job.  During one trip to Greece, I clambered over the hills
to observe the workers (paid by the weight of their finds) dig these burls
using only a pick and lots of elbow grease.  Thansis, a typical worker,
uses his family burro to move his wood about 15 kilometers to his meeting
spot with George Siderakis, the mill owner. The burls are washed and then
kept wet, to avoid splitting, until the cutter is ready to change the burl
into briar blocks. Imagine sitting in a loft all day with your feet
dangling down and an 18-inch saw blade whirling at a couple thousand RPMs
near your crotch.  If that isn't enough, the wood they're cutting is wet
and still a little muddy.  Do you remember the last time you tried to cut a
slightly damp 2x4?  It's tough, dirty work and the workers get paid only
for the usable block they cut during the long day.  As the blocks are cut,
the cutter grades the wood based on visible grain and imperfections
showing.  During all this, the wood must be kept wet.
 
     When a fairly large amount of cut wood has been accumulated, it is
boiled in a large copper vat for 24 hours.  The boiling removes most of the
natural oils from the wood.  This is the beginning of the break-in process
for your new pipe.  Only after boiling can the wood-drying process begin.
At the saw mill, the cut blocks are allowed to dry for approximately 90
days.  After drying, the blocks are sorted by size and bagged for shipping
to a pipemaker.
 
     Once we receive a shipment of briar, we continue the drying in special
rooms for another 90 days minimum.  For the highest grade pipes, we dry the
wood for at least a year before turning and then another six months after
turning but before any sanding or other work.  This insures you the
easiest, most enjoyable break-in period and the most pleasurable smoking
experience overall.
 
     I know you think I've gotten off track by talking about how the wood
is harvested when I started talking about the greatness of Dr. Grabow
pre-smoked pipes.  The wood is the greatness of Dr. Grabow.  No, we don't
use all straight-grain, perfect blocks for Dr. Grabow.  Many of the more
perfect blocks are used in our production of the Alpha USA series and the
Blue Ridge Collection.  Because we buy almost all the world's production of
non-straight-grain and less-than-perfect briar blocks, the price of your
favorite Dunhill is only in the thousand-dollar neighborhood, or you only
have to pay several hundred dollars or more for that exquisite Mastro de
Paja.
 
     We buy slightly over half the world's total briar wood production.  If
it weren't for the Dr. Grabow drug-store pipe, the briar wood industry
along the Mediterranean sea would all but disappear.  This in turn would
drive up the price of wood far beyond what the market would allow, thus
ending the pipe business as we know it today.  We know this is true
because, eight years ago, Sparta Industries found itself vastly overstocked
with briar and quit buying for three years.  During that time, six of 21
small briar-processing factories--29% of the total--closed their doors, and
five of them did not re-open when we began buying briar again after three
years.
 
     So, as with many things in our world, our small, humble entry into the
market paves the way for the rest.  Richard Nixon coined a phrase that
perfectly describes Dr. Grabow--the silent majority.
 
     Don't misunderstand me.  Even though Dr. Grabow is a great pipe, I
still save my pennies in hopes of one day affording one of Tom's beautiful
Mastro de Paja pipes.  But I hope that, while you puff on your favorite,
you'll more fully appreciate the role Dr. Grabow plays in the world of
smoking pipes.

If you've got one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you've got more than
one, you're a pipe collector.

<a name="14">Subject: OPC Pipe Show</a>

Steve, while I'm still feeling on top of the world, I'd like to give you a
brief report on the OPC swap/sell pipe show that took place this past
Saturday on Sept. 23.  Bottom line is, it was terrific.  We rented all 40
available tables to dealers of various sorts, including Nikos and Marsh
Levin of NML Pipes Direct, Jack Ehrmantraut of PCI, Ken Layden of Sparta
Industries, pipemakers Steve and Roswitha Anderson, Steve Weiner and Tim
West and a host individual collectors.  Thousands of beautiful pipes were
spread out and hundreds were sold, bought and traded.  We estimate that as
many as 400 people came through the doors, and the OPC made enough money so
that, for the first time, I can quit worrying about the cost of printing
and mailing my newsletter, which just keeps getting bigger (and, I hope,
more interesting and information filled).  We also signed up 17 new
members, bringing our grand total to 90.  The smoking contest (won by Jim
Tedesco, who finished second at the PCI show in St. Louis) was a hit, as
was the raffle (50 cents a ticket and a free ticket for every pipe
purchased), which consisted of 43 distinct items with a retail value of
just under $2,000.
 
It was a hectic day for me as I scurried about like a mother hen trying to
ensure that everything went smoothly and also to sell a few of my own
pipes, but tremendously gratifying.  Everybody I talked to--dealers and
public--seemed to be having a great and rewarding time.
 
I was especially gratified to meet Neil Murray, publisher of the
Agricultural &amp; Mechanical Gazette (yes, it's a pipe magazine for those of
you who don't know), who drove down from Michigan and who isn't nearly as
strange in person as you might think from reading his mag.  Neil even
walked off with a can of McClelland tobacco raffle prize and seemed quite
pleased.
 
Everything went so well that we have already nailed down August 24, 1996,
as the date for our 1996 show--same place but with enough room this time to
hold 65 dealer tables.  I urge everyone to note this in their calendars and
make plans to attend.  We promise a bigger and better show next year, with
more dealers, pipe shops, pipe companies and individuals and with even more
raffle prizes.
 
Thanks for your help in publicizing this event and the Ohio Pipe Collectors
(which is not limited to people in Ohio--we have five members from out of
the States) over the past several months. All of us owe you a great debt of
gratitude for the job you're doing.  Remember that when your energies start
to
flag.

Hello Steve and all,

PD #200 had a listing of 20th  century US Pipemakers which included the Owl
Shop and two possible locations.

While I try to avoid Worcester, Mass., at all costs, I know that there is
indeed an  Owl Shop in New Haven, Conn. on College Street across from the
Shubert Theater. Unfortunately I don't have the exact street number. They
publish a catalog and mail order of their products is available. They offer
about a dozen varieties of tobacco under their own label. Having a
preference to English blends, I consume their Patterson's Mixture and
Harkness Tower. Never having gone there to acquire a pipe, I can't say
whether they offer briars bearing their own marque.

There is also a walk-in humidor which is a cigar smoker's paradise.

<a name="20">Subject: Nording and other things</a>

        I was lucky enough to catch a fine brace of Nording freehands at
the local Tinder Box (they're fairly hard to come by here in Columbus).  A
matched set for my wife and myself.  I know - how cute.  But here's how I
see it.  I am 24.  If I collect pipes for the next 50 years, and I have 20
pipes now, I will have a very, very nice collection.  If I have a fifty
year old set of signed Nording freehands that are _matched_ ... I will be a
very, very happy man.  Wouldn't we all?

        I was surprised to see the Don Juan cigars rate among the Cubans in
the last Cigar Aficionado (with, I believe, an 89).   Though my latest has
been the Hemingway Signature, I thought I'd give my checkbook a break and
try a few Don Juans.  I was pleasantly surprised with the powerful, spicy
flavor and the firm draw.  I smoked the Robusto, not the Churchill; I am
very anxious to try the Churchill.  It does seem to remind me of the one
Cuban I have smoked.  Ah well ... Let's all hope for the end of the
embargo!

        I was very pleased to see Old Cave back in the Ohio wine stores -
though the new bottle threw me for a loop.  I wonder how many times I have
missed it whilst digging through the wine racks of Columbus?  For those of
you who haven't tried Chateau Reynella's Fine Old Tawny, little is better
with a fine cigar or your favorite pipe.  In fact, I am enjoying Sherlock
in my new Nording with a glass of Old Cave right now.  Old Cave is a very
deep port, with several layers of fruit, raisin, plum and tobacco.  I am
not a wine expert (I'm not an anything expert) but this port is really fine
with tobacco.  Anytime you're in Columbus, look me up and we'll share a
glass.

        I feel fortunate to own a new Tim West churchwarden.  Really, a
fine pipe.  It is my first churchwarden.  I now can read and smoke a pipe
without having my TMJ act up!  The pipe is long enough and cool enough to
sit in the crook of my elbow while I smoke.  It smokes best with Dunhill's
early morning.  That wasn't surprising, until I met Tim at the Columbus
Pipe Swap put on by Regis and Bill's Ohio Pipe Collectors.  It seems that
many of his pipes smoke best with Early Morning.  In fact, that became
quite a topic of discussion amongst some of us and it was determined that
every pipe of his that we had smoked smokes best w=00=00=00=00=00=00=05=EAy =
Morning.
Coincidence?  I don't think so!!  Perhaps Tim has a deal with Dunhill ...

        I was very pleased with the Columbus Pipe Show held last week.
Having just paid tuition for myself and my wife, I didn't buy more than a
used pipe case for five bucks.  However, I finally met Regis, Bill and Neil
Murray who is the editor of the Agricultural &amp; Mechanical Gazette.  Anyone
who doesn't already subscribe to this fine publication, should.  You can
reach Neil at 47758 Hickory St. #22305 in Wixom, MI 48393.  It is a well
written and edited journal for all pipe smokers.  Similar to this one!

        I also participated in my first pipe smoking competition at the
show.  I learned one lesson - don't get to talking about any serious
subject.  My inattention led to a beatable record of 16 minutes.  Next
time, I guess.

        Well, I've taken enough time away from Propositional Calculus for
one night.  Has anyone noticed that the difficulty of the course is
inversely related to the number of credit hours it is worth?  Shouldn't it

Yes!  We stayed there too.  I probably sat in that same Adirondack chair

Hi Steve, Congrats on the wedding. This is my "alternate" address and I 
would appreciate it if yopu could change my subscription to the Digest 
from ???????@??? to ?????@????.???. Thanks. I finally got to use the 
resource guide on a recent business trip to Ohio and, I must say, it was 
a lifesaver (for a pipesmoker, anyway). Finding myself in Dayton and 
running low on a good English blend, I found the Tobacco Wharf listed 
and stopped by for a visit. I thought I'd gone to pipe smoker's heaven 
because there are no shops around here of this caliber B-{(. I looked a 
round for a bit and struck up a conversation with the owner (Ron Houck) 
and his son (also Ron) and told them how I found out about them (Central 
PA check told them I wasn't a regular). I left with a great Irish second 
and an ounce of English blend and a satisfied grin. Anyone in that neck 
of the woods is encouraged to stop by for a pleasant conversation and 
great smoke.

The telephone is (203)624-3250. Or, the area code may be changed to 860 - I

The shop's own blends actually number twenty-five, not a dozen as I said

I understand from a friend that yours is the address of a pipe smokers
E-mail . Well , if this is true....I am a pipe smoker ! I would be very
happy to get information from your mail . Living in Oslo  is  rather
frustrating when it comes to pipes and tobaccos . There is no pipe culture
in this town : only two decent shops where some tobaccoes and pipes can be
chosen . The only thing that helps is the vicinity of Denmark !
I am a dry English blend smoker at my 5th year of pipe smoking  ( never
smoked a cigarette in my life ), I have about 50 pipes , the best of them
are produced by Italian artisans .
I am looking forward to receive some information from you !
Thank you for your attention .

Just a note to let you know that the next issue is under way.  I have
some really great photos from the ohio pipe show.  That was one of the
Best shows that I have attended.  Just tons of fun.  I met more Gazette
subscribers there, Ohio is BIG A&amp;M Gazette country.  Too bad you missed
all of the fun, but then you did have to run off and get married.  I met
so many people, Michael Stanley, Bill Unger, Bill &amp; Gabriella Sempf just
to name a few.  The Sempf's are a nice young couple and is Gabriella
ever cute?

    You never commented on your photo in the Gazette from the Big Smoke
in Washington.  Was it that bad or are you running ragged at work like
me?

Anyway, I am certainly going to attend all future Ohio Pipe Shows.  Even
if it is in Ohio, right next OSU.  I just have to hide my Michigan
plates on my car.  Columbus is really one of my favorite cities.  And
not just because there are so many pipe carvers in the general area.
There is an area of the city called the "German Village" which is
essentially the original founding core of the city.  REALLY GREAT German
restaurants and BEER can be found there.  The down town of Columbus
itself is interesting from a design perspective.  The old buildings are
really beautiful.
    Well, Take care.

<a name="28">Subject: My favorite pipe shop</a>

Steve,

I have been very fortunate in life to visit some of the world's finest
pipe/tobacco shops.  Shops in London,  Amsterdam,  Geneva, Copenhagen,
Florence, Paris et al.  Some of these shops are overwhelming in terms of
their pipes, humidors, and accessories.  While visiting these shops,  my wife
holds on to my American Express card with both hands.  (She has this hangup
about financial solvency!)

I know that it's listed in the Resource Guide, but my favorite pipe shop is
Uhle's in Milwaukee.  The first time I entered Uhle's, I knew that I would
love it.  There were about a dozen customers inside.  Most of them were
smoking a pipe.  As I walked in, several of them either nodded in my
direction or murmured a greeting.  Store personnel bustled about; one of them
was smoking a maduro-wrapped churchill.  (I have been in an increasing number
of smoke shops that don't permit smoking in the store, not because of local
ordinances prohibiting it, but because non-smoking coffee-customers might be
offended.  Makes sense, huh?)

Uhle's has a plentiful supply of pipes and accessories.  They operate a small
tobacco factory, where they hand-blend their pipe tobaccos.  I have purchased
at least eight of their blends, aromatic and non-aromatic, and there wasn't a
beast in the bunch!  They offer over two dozen of their own blends.

Where I think that Uhle's Pipe Shop really shines is in their customer
service.  I'm the type of customer who places a premium on service before
price.  Though I have been in Uhle's a number of times, the fact that I live
in northern New England makes in-store visits an infrequent event.  Their
toll-free number (1-800-877-7024) makes ordering a cinch.  Readers should
keep in mind that each June, all pipes are 1/3 off the regular prices.  Last
June, I purchased a couple of pipes at Uhle's by phone.  The young lady who
took my call (I believe her name was Laurie) was patient and helpful.  She
steered me to a nifty Dunhill Dublin Tan Shell, and an E. Andrews Canadian.
 They are welcome additions to the quiver.  All of the personnel are
courteous and knowledgeable.  (I've done plenty of business with Peretti's of
Boston, for example.  They are certainly knowledgeable and expert blenders,
but a couple of them are a little grumpy and brusque.  As a result, I buy
less from Peretti's.)

There are great pipe shops in this country.  But IMHO, few can match Uhle's
for "smoking satisfaction."  Perhaps it's that Midwestern friendliness; I
don't know.  But Uhle's keeps my bowl lit just fine.

Congratulations, Steve, on your recent nuptials.  It appears that you have
far better taste (in a spouse) than your bride does.   ;)  Would you agree?
 I recall my own wedding night.  My beautiful bride complained to me that I
was a lousy lover.  I thought this was terribly unfair after only 30 seconds!

Dear Steve and dear PD readers !
I just received the first PD mail .....very good .
I become a passionate pipe smoker 5 years ago . Obviously I spent most of
these years learning the fine art . I'm sure I still have a long way to go ,
but the endless discovery is part of every passion . 
As Italian I feel like a strange animal living in Oslo far from the warmth
and in a country where pipe smoking is one of the few things not subsidized
by the State . 
I work for a Norwegian humanitarian organization , my job is often taking me
to East Africa and in particular to
 S. Sudan . 
The first time I went to this forgotten and war ridden part of the world , I
discovered with great pleasure that many people ( as many as to name it a
culture ) are pipe smokers , in particular one of the main tribe : the dinkas .
They produce beautiful pipes whose bowls are made out of ebony . The
peculiarity and...believe the beauty , of the pipes are the mouthpieces
which are made out of  brass obtained melting bullets( they are not
difficult to find in a country that has been in war for 40 years !) .
Another funny detail of the S. Sudanese pipes is the protection inside the
bowl : to avoid the fast burning of the wood a tin sheet is placed inside
the bowl , the tin is obtained by the big tin of cooking oil that the people
receive as food aid !
 If anybody has resisted to this description , I guess that he would have an
obvious question : "What do they smoke?" " Cow dung !"  is the answer  .
Infact they mix cow dung with locally grown ( very scarce ) tobacco . 
Well I think this is enough from me as first mail .
It has been a pleasure to read of you and from you !

My regards 

Claudio

Steve-

I'd like to ask you to consider the following item for inclusion in Pipes
Digest; it's our Net press release on the Smoker's Rights Phone Card (60% of
our net, i.e. 10% of retail price, goes to organisations fighting against
tobak prohibition).  

I understand there's always controversy about something "commercial" on the
Net, but about that I'd say this:  Raising money for smokers' rights is
good.  Doing it by selling something is better because it can raise a lot
more and get publicity as well; people who wouldn't write a check to a
lobbying group would buy a product, as sales of environmental group T-shirts
at rock concerts demonstrate amply.  My friends &amp; I are telecom
professionals in a worker-owned corporation.  Telecom is what we do for a
living, so it makes sense to find a way to put that to the service of our
cause (stopping the prohibitionists).  A project of this scale *can't* be
done with volunteer labor; it simply takes tooo much time.  Therefore the
people working on it have to be paid for their time in one way or another
(unless they're independently wealthy; which we're not).  

Now if we were a nonprofit organisation, we'd pay our costs of labor by
going out and soliciting grant money.  However, we're not a nonprofit, so we
can't get grants.  What we *can* do is sell a product on a commercially
viable basis, and make it commercially viable for retailers to carry it.  So
that's what we're doing; and we're donating 60% of our net to the cause.  

You may notice that Greg Pease has been heavily involved with this project.
He knows all of the details of what we're doing, including our spreadsheets,
and we've all gotten to know each other quite well over this time; the point
being that you can write to him (or Marty Pulvers, who also is aware of this
and strongly supports it) for references on the project and on my partners
and I personally.  If you check out all the details on us and what we're
doing, I'm sure you'll find it worth supporting.  

thanks-

-George Gleason  (enclosure follows)

(PS, feel free to include the 2nd and 3d paragraphs of this note in PD if
you think it necessary to explain the whole "commercial" thing.)

We have an announcement...

In order to help prevent tobacco prohibition, we've decided to call the
power of the free market to action. Use of the Smoker's Rights Phone Card
puts a percentage of your long-distance dollars toward fighting the campaign
currently being waged against tobacco and our freedom to enjoy it.

The Smoker's Rights Phone Card is produced by Liberty Telecom, a newly
formed subsidiary of IS&amp;N Inc., of Berkeley California.  Retail price is
competitive with other major carriers' long distance phonecards.
Appropriate discounts are available for tobacco distributors, retailers,
restaurateurs, and of course smokers' rights groups.

An oversight board including people in the trade will have full access to
our bookkeeping related to the phonecard, and will make decisions regarding
issues and organisations to fund.  Currently , the oversight board consists
of Marty Pulvers of Sherlock's Haven, Stephen Richman of Esoterica
Tobacciana and The Piedmont Tobacconist, and Dave Menache or Menache's, a
local restaurant / pub.  

The development team for the phonecard included Joel Sandler and I of IS&amp;N,
and Gregory Pease (a regular participant of this newsgroup) and Irwin
Friedman of Friedman &amp; Pease.  Jointly we developed the concept for the card
and the funding / oversight mechanism into a real product.  The first issue
of the card features a beautiful photograph of fine cigars.  Forthcoming
issues will feature other tobacco-related photos; we can also provide custom
photography and imprints for promotional use by tobacco shops etc.  

In light of the recent noise coming from Washington, it would seem that the
time is right for something that will generate funding and publicity for our
cause.  We believe that with good retail exposure and press coverage, this
card could prove that there is a significant demographic group of
aficionados of fine tobacco who are willing to stand up for our liberties.

(distributor and retailer pricing available; ditto for direct sale by
smokers' rights groups as a fund-raiser)

IS&amp;N / Liberty Tel can be reached at 510-644-8085, or send email to
???????@????????.???

===== end enclosure =====

Note: Steve, feel free to report this stuff any way you like, i.e. using our
text or not... the only thing I ask is, if there are any technical aspects
of this which aren't perfectly clear (e.g. how a debit phone card works),
I'd appreciate the opportunity to provide clear &amp; correct information.

[ No edits needed, George; I've placed it in the Resource Guide. Good
luck; sounds like a lot of good people are supporting this one! -S. ]

Dear Steve;

Could you please include me in your *Pipe Digest*?

Also, a brief story if I may. I found a cigar www site that seemed quite 
interesting. However, as I am often leery of products being sold via the 
Internet, I was cautious. Fortunately, they are here in Miami so I paid 
them a visit. Well, as it turns out, they are a quaint little cigar shop 
that I passed so many times before (since 1962) but never noticed. There 
are 3 very very old Cuban cigar makers doing everything by hand. It turns 
out that a close (much younger) family member did a web page for them and 
takes orders via email or by calling a 1800 number. They make the cigars 
then ship them.

When I got back to the office I ordered via the web and got the same 
cigars (I ordered a bundle of #1 maduros) that I saw them make at the 
shop. They are very very good and very inexpensive. I've been a customer 
every since. (I still have them shipped to me even though we are in the 
same city.) So a happy/positive story from people that are doing an 
honest business with a fine Cuban cigar via the Internet.

They are at <a href="http://www.webcom.com/~cubacigr">http://www.webcom.com/~cubacigr</a>

Thank you and I look forward to receiving the digest.

<a name="34">Subject: Introductory Posting</a>

Hi Steve; I have now "digested" enough of the back issues of the
digest to get a sense for the etiquette, etc. and thought that I'd
introduce myself. At the outset let me echo the sentiments of most
subscribers in saying that your efforts in establishing and moderating
the Pipe Digest are much appreciated. Not only is it interesting to
"meet" other pipe smokers, but it is also nice to have a repository
for the technical information the Digest contains.
		I have been a confirmed pipe smoker for over 35 years
now. Like many of us I started smoking a pipe in College and have
continued more or less uninterrupted until now. I think there must be
a natural progression for pipe smokers/collectors which begins with
buying the cheapest possible pipe - throwing it away and buying a
better grade mass-produced pipe. Then one moves on to collecting lots
of medium grade pipes with the odd good one thrown in.  Finally you
reach the point where fewer but MUCH better is best! Over the years I
suppose I've owned 300+/- pipes but I'm now down to about
50. Luckily,before I retired, my job not only provided a reasonable
amount of disposable income, it also required a good deal of
travelling which meant that I got the chance to buy pipes all over
Canada, the U.S. and Britain. I don't miss the job, but I do miss
these opportunities.

		For the last 2-3 years I've restricted my purchases to
one or two "High End" pipes annually and I've now given up buying the
major brands in favour of purchasing from individual pipemakers like
David Jones, Jim/Debbie Cooke, etc. I find it much more satisfying to
actually talk to the pipemaker before, (and sometimes during), the
process. Not only does that give me a chance to be pretty specific
about what I want, it also results in a pipe which is truly personal.

		Rather than go on at length about what pipes I have,
what tobaccos I smoke, etc, I'll leave it there. If I think I have
something to contribute from time to time I'll do so, other than that
I'll "lurk" faithfully. In closing there is one area that I'd be
interested in hearing from others on and that is the subject of
"antique" tobacco blends. A number of manufacturers - most notably
Germaine and Sons (Esoterica Tobacciana) claim to produce blends in
the "old" style. Not having been around that long I'm not sure how one
determines that the blends are, in fact, faithful reproductions of
Victorian or Edwardian blends. I would be interested in hearing
from/about other manufacturers who are re-creating "antique" blends or
from anyone who has information about sources for true antique
tobacco.

		Again, many thanks for your efforts, Kind regards, Bob
Holmes.

Steve,  Congratulations on your nuptials.  I'm sure you know that 
beautiful, intelligent and tolerant nonsmokers represent a woefully small 
segment of the American population.  I found one such person, married her 
twenty-one years ago, and have no intention of having to find another.  I 
congratulate you on your good fortune.
 
Wednesday, September 27th was an extremely hectic day.  The day's events 
at the office confirmed Graham's Law of Organizational Pseudo-dynamics -- 
The Urgent always drives out the Important.  Upon returning home, I 
thought my day had turned around when I discovered that my order of 
tobacco from Cornell and Diehl had been delivered.  As I prepared to open 
the package, several family-members reminded me of pressing household 
responsibilities.  My first choice would have been to continue with my 
tobacco shipment.  However, I was over-ruled and reminded of Graham's 
Observation of Household Pseudo-democracy  --  SOMETIMES YOU LOSE THE 
VOTE, ONE TO NOTHING.  After nearly two hours of attending to these 
unanticipated and unwelcome tasks, I returned to my package.  Inside the 
cardboard box several bags of Craig's blends waited patiently for me.  I 
went into the next room to fetch a briar and as I returned the scent of 
the fragrant herb was filling the house.  It was then that my beautiful, 
intelligent and tolerant nonsmoking spouse reminded me that I promised to 
take her to see the brilliant Italian film, Il Postino, The Postman.  
Being a man of my word, I set the package aside.  
 
Although I would have preferred being elsewhere, the movie was most 
enjoyable.  However, I found myself quite distracted during a scene in 
movie when the local fishermen gathered at their village movie house to 
see the latest newsreels and smoke their pipes.  There I sat, smoke-free 
and insanely jealous.  Despite this distraction, the film was a most 
soul-satisfying experience.
 
I finally returned to my package at about 11:00 pm.  I filled a favorite 
briar with the great anticipation that can only come from unfulfilled 
expectations and denied satisfaction.  I began the first satisfying 
puffs, and decided to check my e-mail with my new Macintosh computer.  
Previously, all of my electronic activities, including reading Pipe 
Digest, have occurred in a smoke-free office environment.  I was 
relishing the opportunity to catch up on my correspondence while enjoying 
the long denied smoke.  I put a new Pierre Bensusan compact disk in the 
drive and sat back leisurely puffing and basking in the warm glow of the 
CRT.  Low and behold, there waiting for me was Pipe Digest #200.  Take 
courage fellow followers of the sacred herb, it is possible to lose every 
battle, and still win the war.

There has been some some talk of hookah smoking in the digest lately, and

PS-"Happy puffin" would refer to my hope that your future smokes are good
ones,                           not a "pleased penguin."

From: ?????@???????.??? (RANDOLPH RUWE)

	I have been reading at random about 20 of your Pipes 
Digest Pages.  I like the forum?, area?, web site?, very much. 
I have been smoking pipes, cigars and cigarettes for 35 years. 
The cigs. are an early habit, the pipes and cigars are pure 
pleasure and two that I have been enjoying for over 30 years.  
I have about 100 pipes in my collection, and a homemade 
humidor of Vermillion (Paduk wood), that holds about 500 
cigars.  Some of them are 15 years old, that I have aged, 
babied, and pampered, and only share with special friends. 
Mainly those friends that I have had longer than the 
Cigars.The humidor is actually double walled, the interior 
walls made of 3/8's inch Spanish Cedar.  I haave read that 
some readers are trying to make their own humidors, and hope 
that they are not trying to use liners or wood other than 
Spanish Cedar, because they will end up with some odd tasting 
Cigars to say the least. Only Spanish Cedar will improve the 
taste of fine cigars, and allow them to improve with ageing.
I have to sign off for now, but I shall return.

<a name="2">Subject: Ghost Storyteller Secret</a>

The following pipe related story is excerpted from an article in the
Birmingham Post Herald of 10/20/95 titled "TANGLED WEBS: Ghost-story tellers
share their secrets", written by Rebecca Taylor.  The subject of the excerpt
is Kathryn Tucker Windham, an Alabama author with a wonderful series of
southern ghost story collections to her credit, and an accomplished
storyteller.
******************************************************************************

     Maybe some can do it better than others, but Mrs. Windham insists that
everyone is a storyteller.  When she is onstage, she says, she never uses
spooky voices or sound effects;  she just tries to be herself.
     "My father was a wonderful storyteller, and I grew up listening to him
tell stories and listening to other good storytellers on our front porch,"
she says.  "And they just told straightforward stories; they told things the
way they happened."
     "I hope I kind of do it the way he did.  It was natural for him."
     Mrs. Windham says she often pauses when she is telling a story - not for
dramatic effect, but because it seemed natural.
     "I never realized why I did that until a few months ago.  Somebody said
to me, 'You know why you pause?'  And I said, 'Well, no, not really.'
     They said, 'Well, it's because of your father, his timing.  He smoked a
pipe, and he paused to puff on his pipe, and you're pausing for exactly the
same length of time that it would take to puff on a pipe.'  It had never
occurred to me."

******************************************************************************
And she is a great storyteller, find one of her audio tapes or videos and
enjoy a bowl of your favorite tobacco with some good southern ghost stories
for Halloween!

[ What a wonderful idea! And, BTW, it is rumored that a good smoke
will help to keep at bay the ghosties and goblins and long-leggedy
beasties and and things that go bump in the night...-S. ]

From: Jason Vagner &lt;?????@???.???&gt;
<a name="3">Subject: An introduction</a>

	Hi Steve.

	I've been reading the digest for quite a while now, and I may have made
a hasty introduction before, but now I have the urge to send in something
longer with the excuse of re-introducing myself to the fellow Piper's.

	My name is Jason Vagner and I'm a 24-year old cigar fan living in Tempe
AZ (yes, home of the next SuperBowl, I can see the stadium from my house and
from the way this town is acting, it's as if the Big Game is next week). I'm a
writer with an English degree working as a system/network administrator for
Arizona State University. Along with my roommate Greg Nigh, we the founders of
AIDS Authority, a non-profit organization supporting those researching or
seeking more information on the scientific position that HIV is neither
sufficient nor necessary to cause that which is commonly referred to as "AIDS".
(No, we don't assert that people *aren't* suffering from some
immuno-suppressive condition, it's just something a little different, and not
entirely understood). For more information on this specifically, please check
<a href="http://www.aidsauthority.org.">http://www.aidsauthority.org.</a>

	There is a tie-in, though, to smoker's rights. We have three different
levels of discourse that we as AIDS Authority develop. The third and most
"academic" includes a concern that our current medical industrial complex has
gotten into the habit of "medicalizing" normal physical functions, mitigating
the state known as "healthy", and gaining jurisdiction over normal bodily
processes. This is then backed by legislative support.

	How this actually works with regards to tobacco is another matter,
though. Normally, our discourse applies to pharmaceuticals and the medical
system applying drugs and substances to bodies. This debate is different in
that those attacked are organizations manufacturing substances with ostensibly
adverse affects on the body. Personally, as a cigar smoker (with a desire to
get into pipes) I see this kind of tobacco as quite different from cigarettes
and chewing tobacco. The "organizations" that manufacture each product work in
very different ways. How many *major* tobacco organizations own hand-made cigar
manufacturers? (I actually don't know, so I don't mean this as a rhetorical
question).

	But, AIDS Authority doesn't concern itself with tobacco at all. I was
just rambling about the connection, politically speaking, between the efforts
of one of my concerns and this situation that smokers are dealing with.

	On a personal, puffing note: being a 24 year old cigar smoker has its
expected drawbacks. Even though I'm now a clean cut guy (and no longer the
long-hair I was up till the beginning of this summer), I still find it
difficult not to be eyed suspiciously in the more traditional smoke shops.
Perhaps it's just the local proprietors here in Phoenix, but I've unfortunately
found that the most welcome atmosphere to be the local "head shop" which
happens to have acquired a walk-in humidor from the neighboring liquor store
that it bought out. The novelty of fine cigars in such a store has created
quite a curiosity among shop keeper and customers alike. But I share the
disgust of my friend, who used to work there, at being in line with my cigars
with the same folks buying crack pipes and other hard paraphanelia.

	But, between my heavy work load and the scorching summer heat, it's
only now getting enjoyable to sit outside in the early evenings and enjoy a
cigar. My wife, the one handy with tools (give me a keyboard and her a
sledgehammer), built a wonderful pair of hammocks in our backyard. It makes an
absolutely delicious location in which to lay back and force a peaceful and
relaxing hour into my schedule.

	Up until very recently, though, the evening hours were still in the
80s, and the daytime temperatures in the (not so low) 100s. We're now enjoying
70 (and sometime 66ish) degree nights, and our little cold spell is going to be
broken with a 102 day on Thursday. As you can expect, we in Arizona *love* to
complain about the heat. It's a neverending topic of conversation. I eagerly
await the crisp mornings and chilly evenings that might, for such a brief time,
fall upon us.

	And so it has been difficult for me to find a *favorite* assortment of
cigars. I still collect wrappers and make notes, I still visit the cigar shops
each week to collect a new array of cigars, and I'm still waiting to purchase
my first full box (humidor, too).

	I've enjoyed the list very much since the beginning, more so than Cigar
Afficienado. I've found the editor's interviews with tobacco luminaries to be
quite painful (how many cigars did you make last year? how many did you ship to
America? how many do you think you'll make this year?) and not as enjoyable as
it had been in the beginning. The novelty of that period has worn off, but left
me a die-hard fan who's only dying for a little time to indulge further.

I simply want to know if there is anywhere where I may be able to 
purchase- more than likely order- a Cuban Cigar? I have never had one 
and at least once in my life I would like to be able to say that I 
have been able to smoke a Cuban Cigar.

From: ??????@??.??? (Ralph T. Webb)
<a name="5">Subject: A question or two, or three</a>

Thanks for signing me up for the digest.  I'm enjoying catching up on the
back issues.  If I'm not directing my questions or comments to the
appropriate address for you, please let me know.  

A couple of questions for your readers, please.

1.  I started pipe smoking when an undergrad at Florida State back in the
60's. Tallahassee had one of the classiest shopes I've ever seen, called
Jack Kirk's Smoker's World.  Jack started me off with a BBB straight-grain,
virgin apple.  Still one of my favorite pipes.  Jack blended his own pipe
tobaccos, and I still have pipe-dreams of one called Mocca.  Jack was
something of a character, and seemed to have dropped off the face of the
earth.  I would mail-order from him into the 80's, then one of my orders
came back "addressee unknown."  Over the years, I've often wondered what
happened to him.  With your wide readership, I wonder if anyone out there
ever knew of the shop or Jack's fate or if he's still lurking around the
Tallahassee area.

2.  In doing a keyword search on back issues, I see only one reference to
Kriswell pipes.  I know they are long out of business, but would like to ask
if any readers know where I could get my hands on any used ones.  I've still
got one, had a couple stolen while I was in Viet Nam, and would like to get
my hands on another--or two.

Thanks.

<a name="6">Subject: Tobacco Tavern</a>

I read the new digest and picked out the first submission about "A Little
Taste of Cuba."  I am a student at Penn State University's main campus in
State College, PA.   There is a similar place here called Tobacco Tavern.
The front of the shop has a conversation circle of 4 couches where anyone
who loves a  a peaceful smoke can sit anytime to escape the outside world.
Good coffee, good conversation, and of course, a good smoke are the norm.  A
wide selection of pipes, tobaccos,  and cigars span the rest of the shop.
Drop by and fill your pipe.  I highly recommend the Blackberry Brandy tobac.

Steve - I accidentally erased the second half of #201 from my server. 
Could I prevail upon you to ship it again? Thanks!  I really enjoyed 
my first issue (I'm a newbie).  

I'm doing a Ph.D. in Hospitality Management at Penn State.  I picked
PSU after I accidentally stumbled into the Tobacco Taverne, a State
College shop which does great, reasonably priced, unusual blends and
carries a good line of private label cigars. The owner just opened a
branch in Altoona.

I really enjoy the place; if I have to stay out here for three years, 
 this'll help.  Congrats on nups!

me with better contact information (full address &amp; phone number), I'll

<a name="8">Subject: My 1st Pipes Digest Reading</a>

Thank you for including me on your PD subscription list.  I enjoyed reading 
all of the postings and found one of special interest; that was the list of 
US pipemakers posted by ??????????@???.???.  As I purused the list, I 
noticed the name of a late friend, Charles Hollyday.
  Charles (Chuck) Hollyday, maker of CHP-X, Hollyday Pipes, Charles Hollyday 
Pipes, and probably others.. passed away on May 20, 1995, in Traverse City, 
Michigan. Chuck had spent the last years of his life operating a Graphics 
printing business here, making a very few pipes, and ably assisting me in 
hosting an annual trout camp for local fly fishermen. (the party and signage 
was great)  Chuck could be frequently found at Nolan's Cigar and Pipe Shop 
here in town. Mike Nolan still has a few CHP-X, and recent Hollyday 
creations; including a matched 7-day set with a Chuck-made display box.

The fellow who wrote from Utah in the last issue will find a GREAT 
homegrown pipe/cigar store in Salt Lake City: Jeanie's Smoke Shop.  
They have lots of pipes; every brand, and recently completed a very 
large reach-in humidor for cigars.  Their prices are lower than the 
mall's Tinderbox (in the interest of full disclosure, yes, we have a 
Tinderbox, but it should be avoided at all costs in favor of Jeanie's). 
 The store is right downtown on State Street between 100 South and 200 
South.  It's been here for many years, was started by Jeanie's husband, 
and is now owned by Gary, Jeanie's son.  Jeanie still works the 
counter.

It's a great place.

Dear steve, 
having read some of the entries regarding hard or nearly impossible to find
favorite tobaccos, I would like to share a tip for cutting down on the amount
of "best" tobacco used in filling your pipe.  
Like many others that I have observed in your digest, I have come up short of
my supply of favorite weed from time to time.  When this happens, I have on
hand a moderate supply of Straight White Burley.  I use the White Burley,
which has little flavor of it's own, to start filling my pipe.  Usually about
1/4 to 1/3 full, and then fill the rest of the pipe with the more expensive,
or hard to find blend.  
The White Burley will take on the flavor of the better tobacco that is packed
on top of it, and while it may not give you a full bowl of your "best", it
will let you smoke every bit of your favorite to the very end of your pouch.
 The White (unflavored) Burley will smoke fine at the bottom of the bowl, and
will actually pick-up flavor and aroma from the tobacco packed on top of it.
 When you are down to your last ounce of your "best" this will extend it to 2
ounces.
I hope this helps some of my fellow smokers.  It comes from a pipe smoker of
35 years experience smoking pipes and cigars.  Randolph Ruwe

Hello:

And in Toronto, visit Thomas Hinds on Cumberland near Yonge and Bloor. A fine 
parlour, tremendous selection of Cubans, and their own excellent Dominican 
private label line.

I like to cure my cigars in my own humidor, so I typically take my own
into the shop, buy a couple, and smoke the one I brought. They never
object if you bring your own, but I want to support the establishment.

Friday afternoon is an excellent time to drop in--the couches and chairs are 
overflowing with fellow smokers.

Well, one day, the shop stopped carrying them and I was out.  
Can't find them anywhere.  If anyone on the list might have

I've also been told that they've raised the prices something like 40-
50%.  Can't blame for that though with the demand they must be 
experiencing.  Secondly, has anyone had the problem of entering a

Steve, I'm writing to you because you seem to be the repository for
all pipe information!  I am 28 and have been smoking a pipe for a
whole 4 months now.  I got started mostly because I like the smell of
tobacco, hate cigarettes, and a pipe seemed to go well with my newly
grown beard!  I got started by checking out a number of tobacco shops
in the Hartford (CT) area.  I chose the smallest shop I found, where I
thought I could get some individual attention.  I walked in one sunny
afternoon and asked the owner if he could get me started pipe smoking.
He had me pick out a pipe first.  I chose a bent stem, mahogany
stained wood pipe for about $30.  He explained the benefits of a good
pipe, and commended my choice.  (I can't recall who made the pipe!)
He then got me the required accessories, and picked out a mellow blend
called "Nick's blend".  It smelled great.  He gave me a pamphlet on
how to light up, and I drove straight home to try it out.  I had some
trouble keeping it lit, but finally managed to puff steadily.  It
tasted great!  I had tried a few cigarettes before, and they were blah
compared to this!  My roommate said she didn't like the smell, but she
smoked up a storm from cigarettes, and those really don't smell right!
(She did admit later that she soon liked the smell of the tobacco.)
Anyway, I like to smoke a pipe every few nights or so.  I'm not
fanatic about it yet, but I do find it soothing and tasty.  I think
I'm ready to try a bolder blend.  Do you have any suggestions for a
popular blend?  I'm in Alabama now, so don't pick anything too exotic!
Thanks for your ear.

Sincerely,(smoke in peace!)

What do scientists say when they get *seriously* angry?  In the
case of

	Abelson, Philip H.
	1995	"Flaws in Risk Assessments", Science,
		volume 270, page 215 (13 October 1995)

he chooses this closing:

	When scientists plan experiments, they seek
	to control the important variables and to
	achieve time-invariant reproducible results.
	Those at EPA [the Environmental Protection
	Agency of the USA] with the responsibility
	for establishing protocols for risk assess-
	ment experiments have acted as if they did
	not share these goals.

Ouch!

Here's a bit of the background:  Abelson is a Deputy Editor,
and former Editor-in-Chief (or whatever the title was at that
time) of *Science*.  He still returns from time to time to
write guest editorials, like the one cited here.  His writing
is, for my money, consistently strides ahead of that of any
other editorialist for the journal:  he is precise, he writes
about subjects that are important and interesting, he is hu-
mane, and he makes it clear when there's a bad smell in the
air.  In this case, his topic is "[c]hemical risk assessment
studies conducted with rodents", the words he chose to begin
his article.  The USA has spent "more than a trillion dollars
over the past 20 years" on such research, "although it has not
been shown that such studies have substantially benefited human
health."  There are a number of reasons efficacy deserves
scrutiny.  In this week's editorial, his concern is with "gen-
etic drift in the test animals and ... a failure to control
their consumption of food."
My point:  I recommend the editorial not only for its content,
but also as a demonstration that civilized speech makes an
even better weapon than the vulgar language and undisciplined
thoughts that so pervade NetNews.

There's a place in Nags Head called Island Tobacco on Mile Post 14 in

Hi Steve and friends !
It is been a pleasure to receive the PD . I am calmly waiting for the next ,
and enjoying the idea of an electronic sitting- room for pipe smokers'
chit-chats .
I spent week 41 and 42 in Danmark , together with my beloved . I don't think
there is another place in the world with so many and so visible pipe smokers
! Although I do not like the danish pipe blends ( too sweet and wet ) , I
enormously enjoy just the vision of so many people walking , working ,
sitting and drinking with a pipe as companion . It is curious and lovely
that lot's of shops in Danmark have combined sale licence to sell tobacco
and wine . Can you imagine  the  paradise those shops are  for me.......an
italian pipe smoker ?

I would like to say a couple of words on the prohibition debate .  I will
probably be provocative but I do not feel comfortable in joining cigarette
smokers in the counter campaign against smoking . I don't have anything
against cigarette smokers,  but   their addiction makes them fundamentalists
as fundamentalist is the nature of their smoking and as fundamentalist are
the campaigner against smoking in public places . Finally : fundamentalism
is the wrongest answer to itself !
I might be too confident ( or just living in Europe ),  but I believe that a
reasonable solution will be found to the problem respectful of everybodies'
phisical and psicological health . I shall add that I can still feel a big
simpathy and curiosity around  pipe smokers ( and keep in mind that my
Balkan is not exactly the sweetest blend one can smell !) .
No hard feelings just a provocation for some more chit-chat !

[PIPES]
I'm finally getting around to posting a vacation trip report.  I picked up
some nice estate pipes and found a new pipe shop for the resource guide.

I went back to Arkansas and Oklahoma (visiting relatives).  While holed up
in Little Rock, watching the wife doing some Olympic class jewelry shopping,
I figured I might as well get into the act.  Hauled out the Yellow Pages;
let's see... pipes, no... try tobacco... aha, here we are.  Off I go to a
place called, oddly enough, The Pipe and Tobacco Shop.

Walked in and was promptly amazed by the selection.  The first shop I've
seen clay churchwardens out on display.  They also had a nice Caminetto
with gold windcap and chain (looks like the one pictured on page 262 of the
second edition of Hacker's book) for a mere US$ 6500 (yes, that's four
digits before you get to the change).  Nice pipe, but just a tad out of my
budget.  Let's look at some estate pipes.

There were a dozen or so estate pipes displayed, and at very reasonable
prices, at least compared to Atlanta.  As it turns out, the shop refurbs the
pipes on site and perform repairs.  After prowling through the pipes, I
purchased three of them:  1) A small, smooth GBD bent bulldog.  Grain not
outstanding, but a nice patina and nary a flaw anywhere.  Age unknown.  2) A
smooth Comoy Dublin.  Again, no flaws; age unknown, but the lettering is a
different style than the newer ones.  3)  A small (4.75 inches overall
length), smooth, silver banded Barling straight bulldog.  Bowl rim is some-
what rounded from wear, but otherwise in outstanding condition.  Age
unknown; no shape number, the silver band has two sets of initials and
some other stampings on it.  I can also recommend their tobacco blend
_Sherlock's_.  Enough Latakia to bring a strong man to his knees. Sum
total for this expedition was just under $100.  I had almost that much
fun picking out the pipes.

On a local note, for those of us who live in the northwest part of the
Atlanta metro area, a new shop recently opened in Marietta.  Data follows.
I am also informed that a Tinder Box has opened in Town Center Mall, but I
haven't investigated.

<a name="24">Subject: PD tidbits</a>

Steve --

A few tidbits for the PD........

1) McClelland does it again.  Many PDers are well-familiar with
McClelland tobaccos, either from their local tobacconist or from the
spelndid limited-production blends purveyed by Bob Hamlin and (the
late) Barry Levin.  Well, the original Ashton tobaccos are now being
produced by McClelland (and marketed by Holt's in Philadelphia).
IMHO, the McClelland versions are *much* better than the earlier
productions.  The "Celebrated Sovereign" (with Syrian latakia) is
especially good.

2) If ever there was any doubt about the value of "old" tobacco.......
While on a business trip last month in the UK, I visited a pipe/
tobacconist shop in Aberystwyth, Wales, and found a few tins of "old"
Rattray's.  I recognized it as "old" by virtue of two features: First,
the label was yellowed on one side, due to prolonged exposure to the
light -- having sat for a long time on the shelf.  Second (and more
importantly), thanks to the informative tutorial by Bob Hamlin, I
noted from the nomenclature on the label that it was at least 10 years
old. -- I just finished a tin of "Jocks Mixture" from the batch, and
it was a uniquely pleasing experience; such a nice Oriental taste,
nestled in a softly-rounded Virginia base.  Granted, "old" tobacco
is too expensive (when one can find it) for everyday smoking; but one
should treat one's self on occasion!

3) On that same trip to the UK (yes, I *did* get some business done
along the way!), I was in Liverpool for several days.  From a tip in
THE PIPE SMOKERS EPHEMERIS, I arranged a peronal tour of Ogden's/
Imperial Tobacco Co. -- What a fantastic experience!  BTW:  In 1996,
"St. Bruno Flake" turns 100 years old. (Look for something "special"
from Liverpool early in the year!)

(The trip to the UK ended in London -- with a pipe purchase from
Astley's [IMHO, the best pipe shop in London] and a slowly-embered
Cuban Hoyo de Monterrey Epicure #1 from James Fox/Robert Lewis.)

Puff, Puff,

Yo, Steve!

Just finished writing up the latest Southwest Pipe &amp; Cigar League
newsletter.  In it I included a reminder about the deadline for
submitting comments to the FDA re. their proposed tobacco regs.  I'm
passing that part of our newsletter along to you and all of our other
PD subscribers.  The below excerpt contains important info, so PLEASE
USE IT, EVERYONE!

BTW - just wanted to put in my vote of approval for the way the PDs are now
being distributed.  As an America OnHold user I find downloading the PD as a
file much easier (and faster) than the old e-mail method!

Later!

Steve J. (Briar Man)

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

In the last newsletter I told you about the public comment period for the
FDA's proposed tobacco regulations.  This is a reminder that this public
comment period ends on NOVEMBER 9TH.  I also want to once again give you the
address where you can send your letters.  That address is:

Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305)
Food &amp; Drug Administration, Room 1-23
12420 Parklawn Drive
Rockville, MD  20857

Last time, I mentioned a docket number that you need to reference at the top
of your letter.  There are actually two docket numbers, so please note the
following:  Docket #95N-0253-J refers to the proposal to regulate nicotine as
a drug and classify cigarettes as nicotine delivery devices for the purpose
of regulation.  Docket #95N-0253 refers to the FDA's proposed restrictions on
the sales, marketing and distribution of cigarettes.  I won't go into any
detail on what those proposed restrictions are, but if you've been following
this story in the news then you'll know that they're quite extreme.

There's something here that bears repeating.  Some of you may feel that the
FDA's actions are justified, and after all pipe tobacco and cigars are being
specifically exempted from the proposals - FOR NOW!  Regardless of whatever
feelings you may have about cigarettes, it would be naive to think that the
FDA will stop there.  David Kessler is a megalomaniac, and under his
leadership the FDA has expanded its power enormously.  Do they need any more?
 I don't think so, and when they level their sights on tobacco we had better
get very concerned regardless of whatever they happen to be going after
today.  To those of you who have not already written to the FDA I urge you to
do so RIGHT NOW!  Remember, the deadline is NOVEMBER 9TH!!  And don't forget
that you MUST reference the appropriate docket numbers at the top of your
letters.

Also - there's a congressman who wants to know what we have to say about the
FDA proposals.  His name is Bart Gordon (R - Tenn.), and through the American
Smokers' Alliance he has requested copies of public comment letters opposing
the FDA's proposals.  Congressman Gordon is vigorously opposed to what the
FDA wants to do, and we need to help him in his efforts.  If you have already
written to the FDA and you've kept a copy of your letter (or letters), or if
you haven't written yet, but are going to please be sure to send a photocopy
of your correspondence to :

the Hon. Bart Gordon
U.S. House of Representatives
2201 Rayburn HOB
Washington, D.C.  20515

While you're at it you should send a copy of your letters to our other friend
in congress, Tom Bliley.  His address is:

the Hon. Thomas J. Bliley, Jr.
U.S. House of Representatives
2125 Rayburn HOB
Washington, D.C.  20515

It is becoming apparent that should the proposals go through, the FDA will
face serious opposition from congress.  It is therefore VITAL for us to do
everything we can to stop the regulatory monster that threatens all of us, so
once again - WRITE TO THE FDA AND TELL THEM YOU OPPOSE THEIR REGULATION OF
TOBACCO, SEND COPIES OF YOUR LETTERS TO CONGRESSSMEN GORDON AND BLILEY, AND
DO IT NOW!!! 

[ Thanks for the reminder, Steve!  I have written the FDA, and will
mail copies to Gordon and Bliley, as well as to the one local

Steve, etc.:

Here are belated congratulations and a belated report on the first ever
Cigar Dinner at the Peabody Hotel in Memphis. The dinner was held in the
posh Chez Phillipe Restaurant and featured a six course dinner, cigars by
PGC Hajenius and wines by Clos du Val.

The food was exceptional and ranged from Roquefort Laced with Potato to
Blackened Escolar on Carmelized Vidalia Onion Sandwich with a Melange of
Southern Peas and Ginger Beurre blanc to Smoked Baby Beef Tenderloin Breaded
with Grilled Vegetables on Smoked Arkansas Risotto. Each course was
accompanied by two wines--an 80's vintage and a 90's vintage--and the
dessert (Carmelized Pear under Kirsch Marinated Plum Salad and Grapefruit
Sauce) featured a remarkable California Brandy.

The cigars were delivered after each course and were a mild disappointment.
I mean this literally. They were machine made, short filler panatellas of
various sizes. The were mildly flavored and mildly spiced with faint
undertones of mildness. Still, they weren't nasty, just bland. So bland, in
fact, that a first-timer was on his sixth before someone told him he wasn't
supposed to inhale the smoke. He claimed to be woozy, but never got sick.
The best cigar was the last: the Hajenius Grande Finale #1. Medium flavored,
medium spiced, a pleasant after-dinner smoke. As we left we were given a
three pack of these to take home.

All in all it was a great night, although the Peabody has a few
organizational quirks to work out--for example, not having the first cigar
ready when we  entered, and not stopping us from therefore pilfering cigars
from the large humidors they had apparently intended to give away in a
drawing. Still, I'm looking forward to the next dinner, which will hopefully
take place in December.

The Peabody, by the way, is cigar friendly all the time. I recommend
plopping down on one of the sofas in their lounge, ordering a
single-malt--or the aforementioned brandy--and lighting up a Churchill. No
one will even look at you funny.

Give 'em hell.

Steve:

Will you please run this in PD if it's not too commercial. Tnx. Will
understand if you don't.

The following blends are now offered in one pound pressed blocks (the way
tobacco was sold 100 years ago) at a $2 per pound premium: #414P, #531P,
#965P and #967P. Putting tobacco under high pressure mingles the oils and
flavors, making the smoke smoother and removing the sharp distinctions
between tobaccos.

In addition, we have a new blend in pressed form only, #967PV, Bromley's
Best. This is a combination of #967 with a small amount of #414 added to cut
the heavy Perique in #967. The blend was named in honor of Dr. Ray Bromley
who suggested it and who contributes so much to our discussions.

Cornell &amp; Diehl has been building a new "tobaccery" (and home) and we will
be moving in the middle of December. Therefore, we will be closed from
December 12 to December 26 inclusive. We will accept orders during this time
for shipment December 27 and later. Orders received before January 1 will be
honored at the current prices.

In addition, there will be a price increase January first to $14.75 per
pound. This is the first increase in 2 years and we just can't continue to
absorb our costs. Shipping may go up, but not unless UPS makes its usual
annual increase more than last year. We'll try to hold the line on that.

Best,

Craig

<a name="2">Subject: Escudo 50gm</a>

Dear Steve

	I noticed your comment in the last Pipe Digest which avers that 
Escudo is only unavailable in 100g tins, but is available in 50's.  I am 
unsure what to make of this.  I have it on excellent authority that 
Escudo is out of production, and unavailable from major suppliers who may 
still list it in their catalogs, but can no longer deliver.  Further, my 
original understanding was that the 50g tins were the first to be gone, 
and the 100's were the last.  If you have any knowledge of suppliers who 
have current stock of Escudo in any size, other than Bob Hamlin (who has 
10 year old 100g tins for $50), I would like to know about it.  I would 
not like to know about suppliers who still catalog Escudo, but have no 
stock; they are embarassing to contact.  Frankly, you need not even 
contact me personally about this matter, although I would be delighted to 
be first to know about any suppliers who haven't sold out weeks or months 
ago.  Rather, a clarification in the newsgroup or next P.D. would be 
excellent.  Thanks for reading this.

Steve,
        (Apologies to all.  I don't know why my message didn't appear after
my heading in Digest 202.  I was trying to cut and paste and apparently
didn't do it correctly.  Anyway, I'll type it out this time...)
        I read the following on NandoNet News on 10/26/95: (I hope the "free
market think tank" is pursuing this with tongue in cheek) -

Group to FDA: if tobacco is a drug, so is coffee

WASHINGTON - A free market think tank said Wednesday if the Food and
Drug Administration goes ahead with its drive to regulate tobacco as a
drug it should do the same for coffee and cola.  "FDA's tobacco
proposal sets out new criteria for classifying substances as drugs and
devices, and these criteria are as applicable to caffeine as they are
to nicotine," Competitive Enterprise Institute general counsel Sam
Kasman said in a news release.  "FDA has an obligation to apply these
criteria evenhandedly."  Hoping to "wake up" the FDA as it formulates
its policy on nicotine, the institute filed a petition saying
regulation of caffeine beverages would be the logical next step.  The
petition noted that the drive to treat nicotine as a drug was based on
arguments that it is addictive and affects the central nervous system,
that cigarette makers manipulate the level of nicotine to obtain these
effects, and that most regular smokers begin as minors.  "All the
arguments FDA uses against tobacco can also be used against caffeine,"
the news release said, adding that a wide range of soft drink
advertising campaigns show the industry deliberately markets these
products to young people.

        I guess there are those who won't be happy until we're all
existing (??) solely on bottled water and organically grown celery!
But as absurd as this story may sound (to me, anyway) I think it does
illustrate very well what could happen if we are not vigilant in
protecting our rights to choose to smoke (and drink caffeinated
beverages!!).

[ I also heard that there's another group that wants to ban
wood-burning fireplaces, on the grounds that wood smoke is "16 times
as bad as tobacco smoke."  Maybe the FDA will classify fireplaces as
drug delivery devices next... -S. ]

<a name="6">Subject:      partner question</a>

I have an interesting situation. I have been interested in pipe smoking for a
couple of years but had never done anything about it until recently. I decided
to go to a local shop, inquire about the hobby and the merchandise, and the
nice lady there sold me a good pipe and some mild tobacco. I went home, lit up
for the first time, and after figuring out how to keep it lit, proceeded to
actually enjoy the experience quite a bit. So whats the point of the story you
say? Well, I've always been an anti-smoking sort of person - to cigarettes that
is, I really have no use for them at all. My long term girlfriend knows this
and shares my view, disliking smoking herself and not going to places where it
would be prevalent. My problem is this, I've discovered I like pipe smoking
and wish to contuine but how do I broach this subject to my girlfriend, who
apparently hates all forms of smoking and thinks I do too.(because I actually
did until I tried it!) If I just pull out my pipe next time were together and
light up, she'll think I've gone insane! So, what's a newly "converted" pipe
puffer to do? Before you even start, finding a new girlfriend is NOT an option
under consideration!! ;)  Thanks for your help! ---- P.S. this same situation
applies to friends and associates, none of which have seen me smoke. -DDS

[ I guess a lot of new cigar smokers have had the same predicament.
I'd just tell her about your new-found pleasure, in a non-threatening
way, and ask her to be tolerant.  Maybe it'd be a good idea to offer
to switch to any kind of pipe tobacco whose aroma she particularly
enjoys.  A nice vanilla Cavendish works wonders.

Have other members dealt successfully with this problem? Best of luck! -S. ]

Matt here at State College,

        In response to the strange looks that Jason Vagner gets in the smoke
shops as a 24 year old cigar smokers, I can definitely relate, I'm an 18
year old pipe smoker.
        Also, another plug for that Tobacco Tavern in State College (I'm not
working for them, I promise).  Bill Pickering saw some clay churchwardens in
Arkansas, the Tavern's got them.  $12.95 each, and if you buy two, you get a
nice wooden stand with them.

From: Joel Bloch &lt;????@?????.??.??&gt;

Steve,

I've been receiving the PD since your return from your honeymoon, and would
like to start off by offering you and the Mrs. my heartiest congrats.

I've been smoking since I was 13 (am now 49), but, unfortunately, I started
out with cigarettes, and only discovered the pleasure of pipe smoking many
years later.

Living in Israel, as I have for the past 27 years, I find myself rather
limited in the selection of pipes available, and with a rather small pipe
smoking population (most Israelis are cigarette smokers). There also don't
seem to be many real tobacconists in business, and so I'm limited as to
what's available as far as what to put in my pipe and smoke it goes.

I have, however, been able to build up a small collection of reasonably good
pipes over the years, including some locally made Shalom pipes and some
Petersons, the pride and joy of my collection being the 3 Peterson
Meerschaums that I own.

I've gotten used to the fact that I usually have to smoke my pipe by myself,
although it's always been my feeling that a good pipe is best enjoyed in the
company of at least one other piper, as there is never a lack of a subject
for conversation. Once you've discussed the weather, the local politics,
financial and job situations, you can always go on to the important stuff,
like pipes and tobacco. (I've never heard cigarette smokers have a
discussion about various brands of cigarettes - have you?)

Anyway, those are my thoughts for the moment. I enjoy getting the PD, and
always look forward to it.

Bye for now - Joel

not persimmons) correct, but I've been getting reports of Osterized
results coming back when someone tries to finger my account.  I'd really
appreciate it if PD subscribers could give me some feedback on how my
account is returning "finger" inquiries.  Pals?  Some help?  (Oh, I will
suggest that piping to "more" [i.e. finger ??????@??????.??? | more] is
advisable, as the Smokelist is several screens long.)

	Now, on other matters...

[somebody, I neglected to save whom] quoth:
&gt; I know that it's listed in the Resource Guide, but my favorite pipe shop is
&gt; Uhle's in Milwaukee.  The first time I entered Uhle's, I knew that I would
&gt; love it.  There were about a dozen customers inside.  Most of them were
&gt; smoking a pipe.  As I walked in, several of them either nodded in my
&gt; direction or murmured a greeting.  Store personnel bustled about; one of them
&gt; was smoking a maduro-wrapped churchill.  (I have been in an increasing number
&gt; of smoke shops that don't permit smoking in the store, not because of local
&gt; ordinances prohibiting it, but because non-smoking coffee-customers might be
&gt; offended.  Makes sense, huh?)

	&lt;sigh.&gt; Uhle's is yet another of the reasons I regret ever having
left Milwaukee.  A swell lot, the whole crew of 'em.  I'd highly recommend
a trip to Uhle's (BTW, it's pronounced "YOU-lees") for anyone breezing
through Brewtown, especially if you can make it on a Thursday evening when
the shop stays open 'til 8pm for the clientele's weekly rite of tobacco-
stoked, after-work fraternization.  The place is downtown on the main
drag, Wisconsin Avenue, next to the Riverside Theatre and across from
Marshall Field's.  My favourite guys there are Jeff, who makes me think of
a former nine-to-fiver who made a wish for his dream-job and *got* it, and
Stan, the young, somewhat-anachronistic, jovial eccentric.  Tell 'em Tyson
(the guy with the cigaret list) sent ya.

	Check out the pipes in the display cases, especially the little
case in the middle of the floor -- bulldogs the size of a *billiard ball*;
an Ueliphant (sp?) pipe which has *no bend* from stem to bowl (!), just a
sweeping flare from bit to mouth, with a slight curve upward; an ancient
Dunhill trench lighter of ingeniously simple design; and then there's the
little silver box apparatus of indeterminate purpose (it has a trough-
shaped well under the top lid, and the side lid reveals a metal bottle
under the well with a wick kept under a tethered screw-top), which they
got as a freebie in a shipment, and which they've promised to give away to
anyone who can identify it authoritatively (no speculation; you've got to
*recognize* the blasted thing).  

&gt; Uhle's has a plentiful supply of pipes and accessories.  They operate a small
&gt; tobacco factory, where they hand-blend their pipe tobaccos.  I have purchased
&gt; at least eight of their blends, aromatic and non-aromatic, and there wasn't a
&gt; beast in the bunch!  They offer over two dozen of their own blends.

	Drop in anytime from about Thanksgiving to X-mas, when Uhle's has
their annual "Christmas Blend" available -- a "festively aromatic" blend,
different every year, sold only during that month-and-a-half or so (altho'
one of these proved so popular that it made it onto the regular menu; it
became their new "Brand X (Trapper's Treat)" after the old Brand X had to
be retired owing to the unavailability of a crucial ingredient).  Those of
us on Uhle's mailing list get a holiday postcard redeemable for a 1.5-oz.
pouch of the blend, gratis.  True, it may be mere test-marketing, but they
sure do it with class, no?

Dear Steve,

I have been enjoying the digest very much.  Thanks for your hard work.

I am going to Puerto Rico in January.  And, I have a few questions.  1.
 Where can I find a good cigar shop?  2.  I know of at least one cigar
manufacturer on the island (Consolidated).  Are there any others and do they
offer tours?  3.  Does anyone hand roll cigars in PR?

Thanks for the help.

I found the archive on Steve B page Thanxs . One day I d like to write some
sort of history on Am pipemakers before their stories are lost. Here s an
inquiry I wrote to Rex which I doubt  he ll be able to answer would you be
able to include this in some form for PD feel free to edit MT

Dear Rex
Just read thru the list . I didn t realize there were so many and I  didn t
realize there were so many I knew. But I  am saddened to read of the death
of Frank Augsbergerer of Champaign, IILL. Frank moved to West Caldwell NJ
at the tender age of 17 to learn how  to be a pipemaker under Jack
Weinberger, JHW pipe,who Curt and I had  were working for. Talk about wet
behind the ears. Frank was so funny it was unbelievable. But he sincerly
wanted to be a pipe maker in the worst way. I forget everything that
happened but he eventually moved back home as Jack broke him in slower than
he thought his potential deserved. But he did start making pipes on his
own. I m sorry to say over the years I lost track of him and  I would like
to hear some sort of epilouge. If anyone has any knowledger of  what
happenned to Frank , I d like to know. Mark Tinsky

I m going to send  a copy to Steve M  maybe he ll print it. Also I heard
George Allen of E. Stroudsburg died. I was friendly with him and then one
day I stopped in at his shop to see him and it was no more. Just recently I
heard he had  died.

Steve --

As you may recall, I recently e-mailed a contribution to PD #202
concerning "old" tobaccos.  I would be *very* interested in hearing
from pipesmokers who have tried various oldies.  I am "aging" a
growing cache of tobacco myself (ca. 75 tins -- and growing!).  As
you may know, Bob Hamlin (PCCA) sometimes obtains limited supplies
of oldies and makes them available to the membership.  Bob is a
repository of information on these tobaccos. -- Are there PDers out
there who have smoked oldies (&gt;10 years old)?  What was your reaction
to them?

Recently one of your readers asked, "Are there pipe clubs in Minnesota?"
 As all subscribers to the Agricultural &amp; Mechanical Gazette know ( this
is a shameless plug for my publication) The Grumblers Club meets each
saturday morning at the J.R. Fielding Tobacconist -- located on
Lexington Ave in St. Paul.  This is one of the better pipe shops -- they
do have cigars too, but who cares -- in Minnesota.  The Grumblers Club
is a pipe smoking club, of very irregular fellows, who sit around the
round table at the front of the shop and review Minnesota and national
problems.  As you may recognize, actually solving all or even some of
Minnesota's problems is probably beyond the capability of any group of
humans.
    Anyway, lot of interesting folks there including politicians,
airline pilots, 3M employees, university folks, police, retired guys,
and just about any other career field you might want to find.  And the
only requirement is that you have a pipe, cigar and an opinion.

I have to also pass along a pleasant surprise thanks to Bill Fink Jr.'s
generous offer to provide a free sample of tobacco (Pipe Digest #200) from

<a name="15">Subject: New C&amp;D Oferings</a>

Steve:  I tried some new blends (pressed) that Craig had at the CORPS show and
I thought your readers might be interested in my impressions.

Craig Tarler of Cornell and Diehl Tobacco has a new style of pipe tobacco: 
blends pressed under hydraulic pressure.  The result is a one pound brick. 
Just cut or break off a small amount, crumble to the desired texture and fill
your pipe.  This is not like a flake or disk such as Erinmore Flake or
Macbarren's Twist.  The blends Craig offered at the Richmond CORPS show (he
brought several for people to sample) were natural blends lacking the
additives or stickiness needed to form a hard mass.  Instead his brick
crumbles cleanly and easily.

The samples Craig brought were his Oriental Silk, Yale Mixture, and Exclusive
(the Escudo match) blends, all of which I have smoked before and enjoyed. 
The pressing process doesn't change the final texture or taste but it makes a
significant difference in the overall effect.  The flavors of the individual
tobaccos blend and marry to each other in the pressing process.  I found the
result in all of the offerings to be a smoother, more mellow smoke that did
not sacrifice the blend's unique character.  And that mellow effect actually
became more pronounced as I continued to smoke the bowl.  It was improvement
without change.  These are my impressions but several veteran smokers,
familiar with these blends, agreed with me.

Craig will not be offering all of his blends in this manner, but there will
be several.  Ask him about it when you place your next order.

On another matter, I tried a couple of C&amp;D blends which were new to me. 
(Yes, there are a few I haven't tried yet.)  I like the challenge of
describing a purely subjective impression (taste) in a way that others can
understand.  So here goes.

Trade Winds:  This is a blend of burley, Virginia and sweetened latakia.  It
is flavorful but not harsh or overpowering.  One of the appeals of this blend
for me is that it goes very well with sweet black tea, especially, for me,
Earl Gray.  I'll be enjoying this combination on cold winter evenings.

Scot's Pub:  This is a blend of Scandanavian style cavendish tobaccos, medium
cut, and lightly flavored with scotch whiskey.  This blend has plenty of
flavor but provided a mild smoke without a heavy aroma for those around me. 
(Scot's Pub would be a good "morning pipe" for those of us who indulge in a
bowl of tobacco before lunch.)  For fun of an evening, I tried it with
different scotches.  My preferred brand is Lagavulin (when I can afford it). 
It completely overwhelmed the taste of the tobacco but Lagavulin is one of
the most pungent of the single malts.  On the other hand, it complemented the
taste of lighter, blended scotches such as J&amp;B and Scoresby.  Scot's Pub also
went well with medium strength coffee and tea.  I'm not much for aromatics,
especially the heavy, sticky kind, but this blend is flavored lightly enough
to let the tobacco taste come though.  (Craig lays on the flavor by hand
instead of steaming them in, which results in a more elegant, less sticky
blend.)  I'll be getting some with my next order.

If others have tried these blends, I would be curious to know if you agree
with my impressions.  As usual, I have no connection with C&amp;D except as a
satisfied customer.  Happy Puffing!  The Bear.

<a name="16">Subject: Re: Hello...</a>

To Steve and Friends,

	 I read all your info. on the WWW and a few newsletters, and
finally decided to go out and confront the inevitable - I bought my first
pipe.  I recently turned 18, but have been enjoying the luxury of cigars
for a couple of years now.  I decided to branch off into the pipe smoking
realm, and to this point have not been disappointed.  It is rather
difficult to pinpoint the unique attraction to pipes, especially for a
young man such as myself, but I have concluded that such an inquiry is
irrelevant.  There is something about cradling a pipe in your hand on a
cold day looking outside a window at the franctic pace of others.  I
admire such simplicity.  

	I am currently enrolled in Eastern Illinois University, and 
originate from the St. Louis area.  There are app. 5 or so shops in the 
Metro area, but the vast plains of Illinois are not exactly a breeding 
ground for many tobacco shops.  The nearest location is Jon's Pipe Shop 
at the University of Illinois, which is an hour or so from here.  

	I felt confident as I strode into the establishment, armed with 
my newly acquired knowledge from your handy resources on the Internet.  
Such information was absolutely invaluable to the proper selection of a 
quality pipe.  I decided on a Canadian style GBD mainly because of the looks 
and affordable price.  It met the approval of a few connoiseurs who were 
present at the time which was an extra vote of confidence.  I don't have 
a lot of money right now, so I wanted to make sure I was getting the best 
purchase I could.  The proprietors were very friendly and threw in all 
the necessities with the original price of the pipe - which I greatly 
apprecitated.  Another gentlemen present at the time, was even kind 
enough to buy me an ounce and a half of his special blend to get me 
started.  Needless to say, with the treatment I recieved, I will 
certainly return.

	I did have some troubles keeping the pipe lit, though. I 
purchased the Canadian because I wanted to avoid the problems associated 
with moisture collecting in the bowl from my mouth.  Perhaps I will 
venture into such an investment as that in another time.  I have worked 
out some of the intial problems, and things are finally moving along.

	I am running out of time here; the lab closes in 15 min.  Just 
wanted to write and share a few details of my first experiences with the 
fine art of pipe smoking.  God bless you all.

				Sincerely,

					Paul B. Smith

Thank you for including me in your mailing list. I am already enjoying your

people on earth through the digest.

I am an oppressed pipe smoker struggling to pursue what I think is a very
healthy habit in a society which is becoming increasingly intolerant and
paternalistic towards minorities. My puffing friends have all been converted
by the health freak and anti-smokers; most were just too tired to resist.
What I need is a group which can give me the moral support to go on puffing;
a group which says that "you are not alone".

Quote of the Week: 

"It is not the critic who counts, not the one who points out how the
strong man stumbled or how the doer of deeds might have done them
better.  The credit belongs to the man who in actually in the arena,
whose face is marred with sweat and dust and blood; who strives
valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the
great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy
cause; who if he wins, knows the triumphs of high achievement; and
who, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his
place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither
victory nor defeat."

[KUDOS] Yr. Moderator is normally not one to blow his own horn.
However, now that Neil Murray has let the cat out of the bag in the
A&amp;M Gazette, it can (must!) be told.  At their annual convention in
Richmond last October, the Conclave of Richmond Pipe Smokers (CORPS)
has awarded Yr. Obdt. Servant with the acclaim of "Communicator of the
Year!"  Unfortunately, owing to previous committments, I was unable to
receive the award in person.  High praise indeed, considering that
their other two awards went to Craig Tarler (Tobacconist), Jim Cooke
(Pipe Maker), and Tom Christiano (Collector)! To Linwood, Valts, and
all the other CORPS crew, many thanks! 

(BTW, Neil, may I say that the Gazette is looking better with every
issue!)

And now, as Thanksgiving Day (in the U.S.) approaches, join us as we
settle back for a few puffs of something to complement the dinner, and
give thanks for the opportunity to live well, and to commune with our
brothers and sisters of the leaf...

<a name="2">Subject: No Pipes in Newark</a>

Hi Steve,

I recently flew into Newark and had a three hour layover.  I went to the
Presidents' Club, flashed my Platinum Card to the person at the desk, picked
up a newspaper and sat down.  After an hour or so, I walked over to the
smoking section to see if I could enjoy a bowlful.  (Of  the two Presidents'
Clubs at the Newark airport, I was at the larger, upstairs one that overlooks
the food court.  It can accomodate several hundred people, I would guess.)  I
was there in the late morning, on a weekday.  There were fewer than 12 people
in the entire Club.  There was no one in the smoking section, at the time.
 Under the "Smoking Section" sign was another sign: "No Pipes or Cigars
Please."  Rather than ignore the No Pipes sign, I went to the desk to request
if I may smoke in the deserted smoking section - no one would be bothered.
 Instead of a simple "yes" or "no", I received a lecture from the woman
saying that I should be grateful that smoking (of cigarettes) is allowed at
the Newark airport at all.  I told her that I have little to be grateful for,
in this instance, since I don't smoke cigarettes.  I then politely asked her
for the address of Continental Airlines' CEO.  (Continental runs the
Presidents' Clubs, along with Northwest - I believe.)  She dismissed me by
saying, "Get the address from the in-flight magazine on my next plane."

Normally I am not hesitate to write letters of complaint to companies.  I
fully intended to write Continental about their smoking policy and the curt
response from the woman.  But several days have gone by, and each time I
begin to write, I just get discouraged.  I'm resigned to the fact that since
I smoke a pipe, I'm  a second-class citizen in many eyes.  The opposition has
worn me down.

I hate feeling sorry for myself - it's like shoveling smoke.  But I do feel
that the freedom to smoke within reasonable limits was lost long ago in the
U.S.  I doubt that any of your readers will live to see the day when the
clock is turned back to more tolerant attitudes on this issue.

First, can you change my address from ????????@????.??? to ??????@???.??.???

At the last Pipe Collectors Internation meeting in St. Louis, there was a 
display of Japanes pipes.  Does someone happen to know more information 
about that pipe maker?  I am now living in Japan, and would love to visit 
his shop, and maybe pick up a new pipe.  I remember them being quite 
beautiful.

One of the regular problems I faced back in the states was finding a place 
to smoke in peace with my fellwo pipe and cigar smokers.  All that has 
changed here.  There are almost no non-smoking areas in the entire country. 
Although it is quite a shock to the locals when I pull out a cigar or pipe, 
I have always been alowed to smoke in peace.  Unfortunately, pipe and cigar 
smoking are almost unheard of in this country.  So, when I say I can smoke 
in peace, I mean just that, total peace.  One of the things I miss most 
about America is meeting with my friends and discussing all manor of things 
over a bowlfull.  To be honest, it is far better ot have smoking companions 
than a place to smoke.

Hi friends !
I' m on my way to Africa again . I' spend ther rest of November in South
Sudan , enjoying some good puffs of cow dung ( some says that it doesn't
make a big difference with my Balkan ) under the trees in the savannah .
This time I will stop over in Rome and try to visit my favourite pipe shop .
I take the chance to tip you on it : it's called Baker &amp; Musico' and it is
placed right behind the Fontana di Trevi . It is a beautiful pipe shop whit
a very relaxing and competent atmosphere .   B&amp;M and in particular Giorgio
Musico' do their best to make each of us at home; it is a place I would
suggest to any beginner because of their capacity to direct your choice
without making one feel like a "new comer" . I have learnt a lot in that
shop and , of course , I found there some of my best pipes . An example ? A
Castello , smoked twice by a customer  and cleaned by Paolo Baker ( who is
also an excellent...and expensive  pipe maker ) sold  for as much as USD 75
!!!! If any of you is passing by Rome I could send more details also on
other pipe shops , but if any of you is going straight to visit Baker &amp;
Musico' , please give them my regards , they remember me as the guy living
in Norway and often going to Africa !

[ BTW, Claudio, I wonder if it's possible to visit the Amorelli shop?
I've been very impressed with his work. -S. ]

Many thanks to Elliot Evans for his tip in issue 173 of using a
vacu-formed video cassette case for keeping cigars fresh while
traveling. I was recently in Texas for 1 week and it kept the cigars
beautifully. Coincidently, I also used a case from Disney's
Fantasia. Thanks again Elliot......

Hello Steve,

  I just finished PD #203 and, as always, I received a degree of comfort
reading the comments of fellow smokers and knowing that none of us are
alone even though it can feel that way sometimes.

  I've had the pleasure recently of introducing some friends of mine to the
joys of the pipe and cigar.  They've seen me sitting back and enjoying
myself so often, that, one by one, they've subcumbed to to allure of fine
tobaccos, processed and aged with care.  Although none of them are
prodigious smokers yet by any means, I've been able to share from my stock
of cigars and pipe tobaccos and impart whatever wisdom and knowledge I've
managed to accumulate over the past 18 years or so.  The process has been
rewarding for me too, because now I have some friends with whom I can share
a quiet smoke whenever our path manage to cross.

  Last night I was in my den sitting in a reclining leather chair in front
of a small fire, a wee drop of good Irish whiskey close to hand, and my
pipe burning nicely, and I was thankful once again for the simple pleasures
of life; and that old saying came to mind, "Living well is the best
revenge."  And living well doesn't necessarily mean living extravagantly.
A comfortable chair, a cheerie fire, if possible, and a pipe are all that's
needed sometimes to ward off-if only for a short while-a legion of demons.

  My wife and I are great fans of the late Jeremy Brett and his
interpretation of Sherlock Holmes.  For this reason, she's been urging me
to buy a churchwarden-such as Jeremy so often smoked throughout the
series-to add to my collection.  Last week I stopped in at the Claremont
Tobacco House to pick up a couple ounces of one their house blends and
there, on a rack behind the counter, were several churchwardens with
smallish bowls and graceful curved stems.  After examining several of them
and learning that they were reasonably priced, I selected one, and so now
am the proud owner of a churchwarden.  I must admit, it seems the perfect
pipe for said leather chair in front of the aforementioned fire.  I look
forward to becoming well acquainted with it during the coming winter
months.

[ Indeed, Ed; enjoy the fire and your churchwarden. The Sherlockians
might be able to provide us with a list of all the pipes Holmes smoked
(which don't include the calabash)... -S. ]

<a name="7">Subject: news for pipes list</a>

Dear Steve, your readers might like to know that Larry Weinfeld passed away
last week.  Larry was the president of Hollco-Rohr, probably the nation's
largest pipe and tobacco importer and wholesaler.   The entire industry
will miss him; not because he was one of the most important people in the
pipe business, but because he was a gentleman and, to most, a dear friend.
He is survived by his wife, Trudy Rohr Weinfield and his two sons: Brad and
Mark

Larry was originally a CPA who, in the 1960s, stepped into his
father-in-law, Max Rohr's, business to help out for "a year or two".   Max
was the US wholesaler for Savenelli pipes, some English brands, the
nostalgic old German "alter modish phifen" with staghorn bits and fancy
painted porcelain or carved wooden bowls, Decco wooden stands, humidors and
such.  It was a good solid, well respected in the industry, and Max himself
was well loved by everyone that knew him.  Larry and Trudy carried on that
tradition with the addition of their own style.  They were one of the few
businesses willing to take chances on both special people and unusual
merchandise.  They expanded the company lines and introduced new artists
such as Miccoli, whom they found carving freehands in the window of a pipe
shop in Long Beach.  They were one of the first to bring in pipes from St.
Cloud, France: first the carved heads, and then the myriad other fine pipes
to come out of that small city.   They brought in the Fantasia from
Belgium.  Its colorful exterior and meerschaum lining was an immediate hit
in the US and there were a wide variety of copies; but, it took someone,
to take the chance and try it first.

What Larry did not do was probably as important as what he did.  He was an
honest man who's ethics were beyond question and who was willing to give up
making money if he felt it was morally suspect.  For example, Max Rohr had
always carried a traditional hooka from the Middle East, but when illegal
drugs became a problem he no longer imported that item, and he no doubt
lost a great deal of money by refusing to carry any kind of dope
paraphernalia.

Unlike most business who claim to be, the Weinfeld's truly treated the
people who worked with them like family  members and unique individuals.
I have seen Larry listen to how a company car was wrecked by a UFO in the
middle of New Mexico and why someone HAD to be off work in order to watch a
bowling tournament on television.  They celebrated weddings and births,
they helped out when help was needed, and they kept in touch with the
families of those who retired or had passed away.

Larry was charming, personable,  and a great joker. Dealing with Larry, and
his wife Trudy, was always a joy.  If there was a problem, all it took was
a phone call.  No one ever worried about taking them at their word.

Larry was also extremely patient.  It took my husband, Geoffrey, three days
to place his first order when he opened his pipe shop in 1969.   Larry and
a salesman answered every question, helped start him on private label
pipes, and gave him sound, honest advice -- all for a one thousand dollar
order.   The company also became a resource we value a great deal and Larry
became a dear friend.  Our lives will be poorer for the loss of Larry
Wenfield.  And, I thought all of you should know something about a man that
has given so much to this industry and to the people in it.

[ Thanks for the news, Al, though it be sad. -S. ]

Hi Michael and other youthful pipe smokers,

I saw your note over the Pipes Digest and have a short response to 
your question about whether anyone approves or disapproves of your 
choice to smoke a pipe.

I should tell you a little about myself so that you know my 
perspective on the issue.  I am 48, will be 49 on 11 December.  Have 
been smoking a pipe very sporadically over the years since I was 
about 19.  I tend to smoke a bowlful of tobacco each day for a few 
days and then put my pipes away for months at a time.  I'm the same 
way with beer and wine.  I enjoy them as special treats for special 
occasions or feelings.  If I have one beer a week, that is a lot.  I 
definitely don't smoke or drink anything alcoholic if I am not 
feeling well and happy.  I have a moderate, nonjudgmental 
attitude about the pleasures of life.  Also, I am a performing 
and teaching musician and a teacher of yoga and meditation.

I believe that smoking pipe should be a treat, not something that 
nags at you.  It should be a relaxing activity that you can enjoy 
while you stop the world.  This is in contrast with the act of 
smoking cigarettes.  The people who make and sell cigarettes hope 
that you become addicted and that you never stop.  Pipe smoke is not 
inhaled and is meant to give a special pleasure to thinking, 
discriminating people.

If you can enjoy a pipe's taste and aroma and not become dependent 
upon it for the nicotine, then your pleasure will be much more than 
just burning vegetable matter.  You don't have to smoke a lot to 
enjoy it--maybe a bowlful every other day or so at most.  This is so 
that your taste buds will have a rest.  If you don't let your mouth 
rest it can lead to serious problems in the mouth: first 
numbness, later possibly cancer.  Also, you would not want the 
effects of the smoke to interfere with your enjoyment of food.  I 
believe that this is the way gentle people can enjoy a pipe in a 
reasonable way.

By the way, I also used to use recreational drugs, but I have stopped 
for many years.  I discovered that meditation can give me much more 
pleasure than _any_ drug ever could.

Wishing you much pleasure in all you do,
J.

Hello everybody-
   To all the young men who have written about feeling uncomfortable smoking
a pipe in public, I hear you brothers.  What I have done is bought the
smallest pipe I could find.  A smaller pipe seems to draw less attention to
itself.
   Also, I have tried a few different types of tobacco and I have found that
I like the very sweet, aromatic blends.  I would love to hear any
recommendations from other pipe smokers with a sweet tooth like myself.

                                                                         Tony

Dear Steve-
In regards to Derrick Stamos' post on the last issue...  Well, this can be
a sticky situation.  My girlfriend has bean very understanding about my
smoking, but doesn't really like the smell of the blends I like (English
style), so if I'm smoking around her, I make a compromise and smoke
something a little more accessible, like a honeydew cavendish.  Still, this
leaves a problem when taking into consideration the juxtapostioning of our
orbicular facial muscles.  She thinks it's icky to kiss a pipe mouth.
Needless to say, I don't smoke a lot around her.  If all this seems a
little off subject, just keep in mind that compromise can be a beau-te-ful
thing.  And why so secretive?  I'm sure she would be more upset to find you
dressed in her clothes than to discover you sneaking a smoke. Present your
position in a reasonable manner and roll with the punches.  We're rooting
for you.

Sincerely,
Patrick "Dr. Ruth" North

   Hey LT!  Have you tried smoking chiles in the pipe yet?  I've always kinda 
wondered about chile-flavored tobacco but never seriously :-)...

   Seriously on topic though:  I was in the exact same way.  My SO hates 
cigar smell but puts up with it because a&gt; I smoke outside (tough this time 
of year in MI) and b&gt; her father smokes cigars also so it's a "bonding 
thing"...  As for the pipe, she's more tolerant because I smoke aromatic 
blends in the bowl.  Cherry and vanilla tones seem to elicit the nicest 
comments.  If you do smoke inside, have some sort of smell abatement device 
for use: smoker's candle, ozium, exhaust fan, smell-be-gone, whatever...

Cheers!

[ Know what you mean about vanilla; having replaced the Craven
analogue with vanilla Cavendish (also by C&amp;D), all is well. -S. ]

	First as a new subscriber, I would like to say thank you for 
presenting a source of information on pipe and cigar smoking.  As someone 
who is fairly new to cigar smoking and researching and considering pipe 
smoking, I can simpathize with what Derrick Stamos  wrote and would like 
to respond.  For all my life I have been anti-smoke, cigarette that is.  
Recently while purchasing a gift of a few cigars for a freind, I ventured 
into cigar smoking myself.  I enjoyed the experience quite a bit and my 
interest and enjoyment continues to grow.  I too was concerned with the 
reaction of my then girlfreind, now fiance, who too is anti-cigarette.  
At first, her reactions to me smoking cigars was more a reaction to bad 
breath and stale smoke smell in my car.  To my surprise, while we were 
sharing our first apartment together, Jennifer's curiosity in cigar 
smoking got the best of her.  On Super Bowl Sunday, while I was at work, 
she decided to try a cigar of her own.  She proceded to take one of my 
cigars which I had bought the day before and attempt smoking it.  
Unfortunatly she cad difficulty cutting and lighting it and her attempt 
failed.  When I got home I was both mad that she had butchered a cigar, 
but happy that she was interested in sharing one of my interests.  I 
showed her how to correctly cut the end of the cigar and light it.  We 
both enjoyed the cigar together. Since then, we have shared a few other 
cigars, and she sometimes surprises me by asking if I have any cigars 
because she wants to smoke one.  I was also concerned with the reaction 
of family and freinds.  They all have been supportive and quite 
interested in my hobby.
	I would say that you should not hide this from her, but offer to 
share it with her.  If she does not want to share this pleasure with you, 
hopefully she will not mind if you continue to smoke your pipe, even if 
you have to refrain when you are with her.  Somethimes smoking alone is 
the greatest time of relaxation and enjoyment.

Good luck on sharing your pleasures in life with someone near and dear to 
you.

The Native Americans as well as other cultures have smoked a pipe as a 
sign of peace.  Maybe we can learn from this example.

&gt;Hi, Stan,
&gt;Do I take it correctly from your username that you do aerobatics?
&gt;~\U S.

I used to do them.  Just for fun.  Spins for grins you might say.
I owned a Cessna 150 Aerobat at one time and I would go up and
wring it out from time to time.  The snaprolls were my favorite.
Now I own non-aerobatic airplanes, a '68 C-150 and a '38 Aeronca.
The Cessna won't complain if I pull it up through an occasional
loop or roll but those snaprolls are taboo.  I'd be afraid of
twisting the tail feathers off.  Oh well, I just have to be 
satisfied to contemplate the rush and swirl of a snaproll as I
draw from a mellow bowl of Rattrays 7 Reserve.  Such are the affairs
of life.

Well, thanks for signing me up.  I look forward to reading the digest.

Hi Steve, thanks for the most recent issue.  I enjoy the digest and I'll 
have to agree with a comment by a fellow member:  It's nice to know there 
are others out there who enjoy the relaxing and contemplative experience 
that pipe-smoking offers.  Just wanted to throw in my two cents worth on 
Smokin' Joes.  I recently ordered two tobaccos from them.  Their Cherry 
Cavendish is nice, and there "Double Bourbon" blend is delightful.  And 
for those pipe-smokers here in southern California, specifically Orange 
County, everyone of you should check out "The Tobacco Barn."  Take care. 
I've been smoking my pipe now for almost three years.  While maybe it's true 
what the health nuts say, and tobacco isn't the healthiest thing in the 
world, but the way I see it is that the relaxation I feel from 
pipe-smoking in this crazy world of ours is extending my life by years.  
Anyway, to all my pipe-smoking bretheren out there, smoke in peace.

Smoke Signal #19
shead @ssd.fsi.com

In the two-hundredth issue of the Internet Pipes Digest, I noted a
comment that there had been no recent discussion of pipe cleaners. It
is odd how these things enter the collective consciousness.  Well, it
is true that not everybody is worrying about pipe cleaners, just me and
another fellow I have never met.

Pipe cleaners have been mildly bothersome to me, at least it is the
quality of cleaner that has perturbed my usual equanimity. On my
seven-day rack, I have several types of pipe: The bulldog and Marxman
Captain have short, straight stems; the remaining five have stems
quarter-bent.  That is to say: the Bjarne squat bulldog, the squat
bulldog from the own-brand of Ted's Pipe Shoppe, the Peterson Dublin,
the Savinelli Roma, and the Willmer Apple, all have stems with a slight
bend. In an effort to spare wear and tear on the mortice and tenons, I
rarely pull the pipes apart, preferring instead to run a couple of pipe
cleaners through the mouthpiece, into the bowl after each smoke.

Ted's Pipe Shoppe, my local tobacconist, sells three kinds of pipe
cleaner: ordinary, tapered, and ream &amp; clean. Bryco has these cleaners
made in China, distributed in this country by Bryn Mawr Smokers
Sundries, Inc. All work well on the straight stemmed pipes, but require
more tricky operation on the bent stems. With the bents, one needs to
know the location of the draft hole in the shank of the pipe. When
cleaning the bent stems, I have to put a slight curve in the end of the
cleaner. Run it into the shank, feeling for the draft hole by pushing
forward on the cleaner until it stops, pulling out, twisting, pushing
in, etcetera, until I get unobstructed movement into the bowl. It is an
annoying and tricky operation, made difficult by limp pipe cleaners,
cleaners made out of wire of insufficient stiffness that often buckle
in the pipe. It is my Peterson Dublin that is the real test of a pipe
cleaner, it has the typical steck bit with the small round hole through
which I can pass the 'ream &amp; clean' only, all other pipe cleaners buckle
under the pressure needed to insert them into the stem, except, that
is, the Parker conical cleaners made of better wire.

Some years ago, 1987 I think it was, I stopped in the town of Havant,
in the county of Hampshire, England, for the first time in many years.
My purpose was to visit Williams, the Pipemaster in North Street, on
the West side of the road, opposite the Electricity Board showrooms. He
was still there although getting ready to close the business, a small
tobacconist's shop. It was there that I bought one hundred of Parker's
Conical Cleaners. What a difference there is between these quality
cleaners and the poor stuff foisted on us these days. On the one hand,
the Parker's have a firm dense nap around good stiff wire. On the other
hand, Bryco cleaners are sickly, wide-awake and feverish, looking as
though they haven't had a nap in a long time, and what is there, will
moult, shedding fluff onto one's trousers and into one's pipe. They
make them with poor, tired wire that gives up at the first sign of
resistance in the pipe-stem.

I had been saving the Parker cleaners for special occasions, but now I
am down to a few remains, and writing to Parker's, in London, brought
no new supply. Lately, I wrote to my Dad in Axminster to see if he
could get me some. He sent me a half-dozen packets of "Big Ben"
"Quality Tapered Pipe Cleaners" made in England. Better than the Bryco
they are less than the Parker's. With the Big Ben came a letter:
"Unlike you, we haven't a good tobacconist in the town, although we do
have a small, old-fashioned shop which sells sweets by weight -- loose,
and tobacco loose too. She had tapered pipe cleaners which I use, but
no others. She had not heard of conical cleaners and there is no
mention of such items in her trade list. . . . Fewer and fewer people
are smoking here and there is great confict going on between those who
do and those who don't. Particularly in public places. Smoking is
banned on trains and most service vehicles. Only this morning I read of
a man [on a train] who, when asked to put out his cigarette, took out a
starting-pistol and threatened to shoot. Needless to say, he was
arrested at the next stop."

Big Ben pipe cleaners pass the Peterson steck-test, but only after a
modification to the bit enlarging the orifice slightly. Recently, the
post brought me another variety of pipe cleaner, samples from John
Turner of Quality Tobacco (UK), these are much more like the Parker
cleaners of old with a dense nap, they pass the steck-test too.

Soon we will be outlaws in a time when even a mediocre pipe cleaner
cannot be had. Slowly, the conduit of balsamic smoke will close, like
the hardening of an artery, and we will be forced to lay our favourite
pipes aside and mourn the passing of old friends.

[ Always enjoy the Smoke Signals, Andrew!  BTW, I'd add to avoid
Peterson's brand cleaners, which JR Cigar sells.  They're too bulky to
go through most stems, especially those with P (steck) bits. -S. ]

Hi fellow smokers!
Well I have finally got this e-mail thing down pat.  For a while I was unable
to figure out where my computer had put the issues of the digest it had
downloaded.  I finally found them in the download manager, coverted them to
microsoft word format resaved and printed them out.  Now how do I find the
issues I am missing?  Aren't they available on the web somewhere?  Please
tell we how to download them.  
I have had some wonderful and not so wonderful cigar smoking escapades
lately.  First the not so wonderful.  A Pleides.  YUCK!!!!  A friend gave me
a few in trade.  Now I know why he gave these overpriced Lawrence Welk (piece
of shit with a band around it) cigars to me.
Now for the better experiences.  I took a long weekend trip to visit a friend
in the Winston-Salem area of North Carolina a few weeks ago.  I had
anticipated this trip very much, knowing that the JR outlet store was close
by and ther there was a Tinderbox in the local mall.  The first day we went
to the Tinderbox and I purchased some Davidoffs which we were free to smoke
anywhere in the mall.  While shopping for a pair of shoes in the shoe
department of an anonymous department store a woman complained about the
aroma of my fine cigar (this was my first Davidoff, a Gran Cru #1), the
manager of the shoe department quickly explained to her that the neither the
store nor the mall had adopted a smoking policy.  She kindly stepped a few
feet back out of my halo of blue.  He privately explained to her that smokers
have the same rights that nonsmokers do.  I was in absolute heaven, a
combination of the flavor of my cigar and knowing that I was free to enjoy it
down to it's last centimeter.  
Now it was off to JR's wearing my new shoes.  There I smoked a few more
cigars while enjoying the coversation of the helpful and friendly staff.  I
had been there once before and was pleased to see that Brenda (I tink she is
the cigar store manager) was there that evening.  She is both friendly and
knowledgeable.  I share with her some of my stash of more prized cigars from
a recent trip to the Thomas Hinds shop in Toronto.  I was pleased to hand
over some of my hard-earned cash for a few boxes of cigars.
Back to the Tinderbox the next day.  Again more handing over.  They have a
great selection of Davidoffs, Avos, Zinos, Ashtons, La Glorias, etc...  I
boughta few more boxes.  At dinner that evening my friend and I, at the
reluctance of his new wife, lit up our                Double R's and were
asked to put them out by the restaurant manager.  After dinner at a cafe we
were allowed to indulge in our smoking pleasure.  The manager was very
friendly, allowing us to smoke.
A wonderful weekend!!

Rob.

Hi Steve....long time no speak....

Kathy Levin is long gone from the tobacco business, as of early last
Spring. The Personal Reserve Line is now offered by McClelland to all
retail tobacco shops across the USA (official as of RTDA in August,
actually as of the PCI Convention in late May). Keep in mind that
McClelland is selling only 50% of the original PR blends, the rest
have been discontinued.

The PCCA "Collector Reserve" tobaccos are produced by McClellend,
however they are not the same as PR blends. CR tobaccos are single
run, limited edition blends that are only produced once per blend. CR
tobacco is only available thru PCCA with various blends on hand at any
one time.

As far as PR blends, I have Dark Star in stock, but none of the others
right now. If you are unable to find these from a local shop, let me
know and I'll special order whatever you need from McClelland for
you. I do not expect to carry PR blends on a regular basis since they
are available throughout the country and I've got CR blends.

[ Thanks, Bob!  To other readers, this, and some later letters about
McClelland's, were responses to a search I'd done for Personal Reserve
sampler packs. Jorge in Princeton says he'll stock McClelland.  BTW,
please let us know when this year's CR issue becomes available. -S. ]

Strange coincidence.  Just this morning I was re-reading some back
issues of PD and ran across mention of the fact that Kathy offered
sampler packs.  I was considering placing a call myself.

Bob does carry *some* of the Personal Reserve series--I understand
he'll be adding more of the line next year.  (Side note:  call Bob and
order some of the Collector's Reserve Winter 95-96; mine hasn't
arrived yet, but I am sure it will be worth the wait.  It is to be a
medium-full Turkish/Virginia/latakia/perique blend.  The base has been
aged for several years, and the complete blend has been aged in the
tin for over a year.  Like others in this series, it is not to be
missed.  I presume your beloved doesn't mind the heady aroma of a good
English/Oriental blend &lt;g&gt;.)

Back on topic:  Nikos has announced that he is now carrying the
Personal Reserve series; perhaps he took over from Kathy.  If you
solve the mystery, I would like to know as well.

Look at the nomenclature.  Older Ye Olde Woods will have the BARLING in
block letters in a semi-circle.  Pre-trans YOW's have three digit shape
numbers, while transitional pipes have 4.  Post-transition pieces have
the Barling in script letters.  There are some examples of Barlings made
in Denmark, of all things.  Guinea Grains are a bit tougher, as they
started the script lettering in the pre-trans days, but the typeface is
a bit different.  Also, GGs have 4-digit shape numbers even in the
"olden days," thought they only start with 1 or 2, while later models
seem to start with a 4.  There are *old* Barlings around which are
simply stamped "BARLING"S MAKE" in a semi-circle; no other grading is
evident.  These pipes are generally from the early part of the century,
and ar ea low grade version of the YOW.  YOW's come in different
flavours, as well; Fossil is a sandblast, Special is, well, um, special,
Straight Grain is the closest thing Barling ever got to one, and I've
even seen Birdseye stamped on a particularly nice cross-cut.  I believe
this to be quite rare.

If yo have any questions, send me the nomenclature description of this
piece, and I'll try to shed whatever light I can on it.  I have to
admit, sometimes I just have to get a feel for whether or not the pipe
is old; old wood just has a certain quality about it that new wood
doesn't.  To date, this method hasn't failed me once!

finally add my voice to the community. I am 47 years old, have been smoking a
pipe for about thirty year, sometimes more regularly than other. Over the

time to sit out in my backyard, I tend to smoke more cigars. I've been part
of the ridiculous cigar-mania of the last few years. I live a few blocks from
Holt's in Philadelphia, and can enjoy a cigar after lunch with espresso, in
their smoker's lounge. I have been in Philadelphia for 7 years. I am the
Rabbi of a downtown Conservative Congregation. Before this I was in Seattle
Washington, but I grew up in New York and began my pipe hunting at places
like Wilke when the elderly Wilke women still worked there, Lane's, Wally
Frank, Dunhill, et.al. It was during that period that I became an early
subscriber to the Pipe Smoker's Ephemeris. Anyway, so much for introduction.
This summer I had the pleasure of introducing my 18 year old son to the art
of pipe smoking (at his request) and he is probably now reading this as he
too is a subscriber to Pipe Digest. Last month he and he drove to Lancaster
PA to visit Demuth's after reading about it in Cigar Afficianado. While there
I purchased a lovely little pipe that I've enjoyed ever since. It is
identified only by the letters HJR on the bottom of the shank. I am assuming
it is a local carver. Can anyone tell me whose it is? I am partial, nowadays,
to American artisans and their work. I smoke Boswells, Wileys, Wests etc.
Finally, I want to thank you not only for the Digest as a whole, but for
turning me on to Cornell &amp; Diehl. I have recently received a sample pack of
five of their blends and words can hardly do justice to my satisfaction. I
love the Exclusive, and the Crowley's Best most. Finally, congratulations,
belatedly, on your marriage, and keep up the good work.

Good Evening Steve and All ...
        Two items of interest for you tonite. I received a new catalogue 
from PIMO. It seems that Isidore and Maryana Alkalaj have retired and Al and 
Ginny Baier have taken over the company. I didn't check the resource guide 
but the address seems different. It's STEMCO-PIMO, Butternut Lane, 
PO Box 2043, Manchester Center, Vermont 05255-2043
        The next thing is an article that appeared in the Halifax Daily News 
on Tues Nov 14. 95  Hell.. maybe there's hope for us smokers yet. I don't 
feel quite so doomed :-)

The Doctor Game
Dr. W. Gifford-Jones

"Don't just blame tobacco"

What kills the majority of people who suffer from lung cancer?  Ask anyone 
this question and they quickly condemn the tobacco industry.  But are the 
cigarette manufacturers the only culprits responsible for the increase in 
the number of people dying from this disease?
Almost one-third of all cancer deaths in North America and other 
industrialized nations are due to lung cancer.  And for years the disease 
has been more prevalent in men.
But lung cancer deaths have dramatically increased in women during the last 
20 years.  It has overtaken cancer of the breast as the prime cancer killer. 
 It's generally believed the reason is increased smoking by women.  But 
there's been another change.  Doctors know heavy smokers often develop 
either squamous cell or small "oat" cell cancer of the lung.
In recent years adenocarcinoma, often referred to as the "non-smoker's" 
cancer, has been on the rise.  In 1965 this malignancy accounted for 12 per 
cent of lung cancers.  Today it's 40 per cent in both sexes.
Dr. Mark Green, professor of medicine at the University of California, 
claims bronchoalveolar cancer of the lung is more common.  It's also more 
likely to occur in non-smokers.
Green reports patients who develop this malignancy have lungs that have been 
scarred by recurrent bouts of pneumonia, tuberculosis and other illnesses.
Researchers at St. Louis University report another worrying finding in the 
January issue of "Cancer".  They found international studies indicate lung 
cancer in non-smokers could account for more deaths in the U.S. than any 
other cancers except cancer of the colon and breast in women and cancer of 
the colon and prostate in men.
No one wants to state the obvious too loud for fear the tobacco companies 
will say, "I told you so."  And that smokers will have less incentive to 
stop smoking.  but it appears there's more to the development of lung cancer 
than smoking.
What is responsible for the increase in non-smokers?  A Swedish study found 
an increase in lung cancer in those exposed to residential radon gas, a 
breakdown product of uranium.  However, other studies fail to show
this linkage. 
Other possible causes are genetics and environmental exposure to asbestos, 
arsenic, chromium, nickel and coke oven fumes.  recent studies also show 
smoking marijuana may increase risk.
Regrettably, the symptoms of lung cancer do not appear early.  They are most 
often discovered during an X-ray.  Or when patients spit up blood or develop 
a persistent cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain.  By this time the 
tumor has often spread.
There's still no easy way to diagnose this disease.  Doctors no longer 
consider routine chest X-rays as a useful screening tool.  Cancer normally 
shows up radiographically only at an advanced stage.
Patients who have suspicious symptoms can be examined with a bronchoscoe and 
biopsies.  Treatmentis surgical if the cancer is confined to the lung or has 
only spread to nearby lymph nodes.  For patients in whom cancer 
metastasized, radiation with or without chemotherapy may be of help.
I'm not providing support for the tobacco industry. The anti-smoking message 
is still right on. Nor do I want to give solace to smokers.  Smoking is 
still the major cause of lung cancer.
The message is still clear.  The sooner smokers toss out the habit the lower 
the chance of dying from the disease.
We also need more research on why non-smokers die of this disease.  But lung 
cancer gets less money for research than breast cancer.  One reasonis many 
people consider lung cancer a self-inflicted disease.

<a name="35">Subject: Assorted thoughts and ramblings</a>

Dear Steve,

It has been a while since I last posted to the PD, so let me start by 
offering my congratulations on your marriage.  That explains why I did 
not see you at the show/swap in Newark in early Septemeber. A group of 
us traveled down from the Boston area, all memebers of the illustrious 
Sherlock Holmes Pipe Collectors Club, organized by the peerless Allan 
Rosenfeld, master of Petersons.  It was my first show, although I had 
gone to Nikos Levin and Bob Hamlin's swap meet in Westborough Mass in 
June 94.  All of us had a great time.  Despite being a certified "non 
serious collector" -- an appellation I earned from Jack Ehrmantrout 
based on his assessment of my collection -- I earned the title within 
our group of gaining the most net new pipes from the show.

I had a chance to meet some of the names from the PD and buy a couple 
of pipes from John Eels of Virginia (an unsmoked Cooke and a Radice) as 
well as swapping for a couple of Ferndowns, a Nachwalter and a Personal 
Reserve made for Barry Levin.  The last is a spitting image of a 
Dunhill and smokes as well as a Dunhill for a fraction of the price.

The Sherlock Holmes Pipe Coollectors Club continues to gather strength. 
All PDers in the Boston, Worcester, Providence area are welcome to join 
us.  We meet the second Wednesday of each month in Mansfield Mass, near 
Foxboro, the home of the struggling New England Patriots.  Jon Cohen, 
Ron Lau, both PDers, have joined our ranks in the last year and we are 
glad to have them.  We would like to have more.

The Novemeber meeting was a high spot in this years's schedule.  Tom 
Cristiano, Tampa based carver of Calabrese pipes and importer of Mastro 
de Paja pipes, along with his wife and distributor, Mr. Topper, came to 
the meeting.  Michael from Brookline News in Brookline Massachusetts 
was the sponsor of their visit and arranged it for us.

A brief diversion.  Michael runs Brookline News.  Almost all members of 
the SHPCC know Mike and have for many years.  I sat next to a member 
who has known Mike for more than twenty years.  Others in the group 
have been shopping at Brookline News, a well hidden jewel in the Boston 
pipe community, for years, and none of us know Mike's last name. Ironic 
since we spend a good part of each meeting talking about finds we have 
made at his store and how much he adds to the pipe scene in Boston.

Back to the main story.  Mr. Cristiano brought around two hundred 
Mastros to show off and to allow us to buy at a discount from retail.  
They ranged from exquisite carved pipes in the $150 range to 
magnificent straight grained specimens at four significant digits to 
the left of the decimal point.  All works of art.  All pipes one would 
love to add to their collection.

He also showed a video of harveting briar, cutting the raw product into 
useable chunks, removing sap, and shaping into pipes at the Mastro 
factory. Next time I think a pipe is too expensive, I will rememeber 
the work which went into digging up the root and the care which went 
into shaping and finishing the pipe and be glad the price is as low as 
it is.  If any of you have a chance to see the video, which is in 
Italian, I urge that you do so.

Tom says he is readying a line of his own pipes, Calabrese, for 
distribution in the US.  He brought freehands with him, but says he is 
making traditional shapes to add to the line.  Beautiful grain, and 
terrific workmanship at very reasonable prices-- $150-250.  
Interestingly, he says the traditional shapes take more work than the 
freehands.

Turning to another subject, the fight being waged against smoking by 
the FDA and the government in general, I am starting to see signs that 
that arbitor of the American taste, television, may be swinging the 
pendulum back in our favor.  On two shows produced by David Kelly 
(Chicago Hope and Picket Fences) charecters are regularly smoking 
cigars and cigarettes.  Adam Arkin, in a made for TV movie, was seen 
smoking cigarettes, and he was the FBI guy, not the villian.  On 
Pursuit of Happiness, a third rate show, one of the main players smokes 
a pipe.

It may be too early to suggest this is a trend, but I am seeing more 
people on TV smoking and they are not the villians.  We probably are 
not going to return to the days of Twelve Angry Men or Casablanca where 
all the players smoked, but perhaps we are headed toward more tolerence 
of smoking by ordinay people.  Any thoughts from the rest of the group 
and have you seen the trend as well, if it is a trend?

Last a public message to Gregory Pease.  Greg any chance of your osting 
your collected essays some place for us to retrieve.

See you all soon.  In the meantime, smoke in peace.

Steve Wyman

[ Sorry I missed you at the Newark show, Steve!  And re the
trend... things may be loosening just the slightest little bit.  Too
early to tell.  Let us hope -- and keep on speaking out. -S. ]

Dear Steve;

	You are making my mouth water talking about fine cigars. 
Years ago when IU worked in a tobacconist shop I acquired a tast 
for Macanudos, Royal Jamaicans and my favorite, H. Upmans.  
However, I stopped buying them over five years ago when the price 
of good cigars reached the $4.00 each minimum level.  When I can 
buy enough pipe tobacco for several hours enjoyment for the price 
of one cigar, I just can't justify the expense.  Oh for the old 
days when cigars were affordable!

			Sad about cigars but happy with my pipe,

Hi Steve;

	Just to let you know, ther are two towns just to the east 
of Boulder, Louisville and Longmont where Bar patrons can still 
smoke which are specifically marketing to smokers now, and, from 
what I hear, are doing a bang up business.  I live about 40 miles 
away so I don;t know the bar names or I would post them so that 
our friends in alt,smokers.pipes could stop for one before 
entering the Peoples Republic of Boulder.

Hello Steve and all;
Hope everyone out there in internetland either has or will have a memorable
Thanksgiving(depending when this is posted)I am looking forward to
Thanksgiving for many reasons;I have a beautiful Wife who loves me and
doesn't yell about my pipes or cigars(except Bombay Extra)My two fantastic
sons,Paul 7&amp;Neal 4 who provide me with constant joy and a sense of what is
really important in life and finally,I am having Thanksgiving dinner in the
home of a pipe friendly Brother-in-law!In fact,he recently took up the pipe
as part of his hobby of historical re-enactments of the war of 1812(Fort
Meigs,Toledo).You see,people didn't smoke cigarettes in 1812,so if you want
to smoke during these re-enactments;you had better have a clay pipe.So,I'm
going to take a clay Churchwarden I recently bought and and a tin of
Nutcracker Flake from Levin pipes.This 1993-94 holiday issue tobacco is a
really nice dark stoved virginia mixture.That,combined with a great meal
and a bottle of Warre's 77 vintage port,should provide the start of a
truely memorable day.I think I'll take a briar along s well,I hear clays
tend to break easily :)maybe I'll even watch some football.Enjoy your
Holiday.

p.s.I'm still not sure what the status of Cope's Escudo is regarding its
future availability but I managed to pick up only two 50gr and four 100gr
tins total, in a search of all the pipe shops in the greater Cleveland

Please add to your Resource Guide the following establishment:

Phillip's "Bayou Humidor"
1152 Acadian Thruway
Baton Rouge, Louisana
(Tel: 504-343-1152)

This is one of those (nowadays) rare shops that still deals
exclusively with pipes, tobaccos, cigars, and smoking paraphernalia
(no gift junk!).  Phillip Eversburg, the proprietor, is a true
pipe/cigar aficionado and romantic.  In addition to the usual things,
there is a *large* pipe repair shop.  Phil is a wiz at pipe repairs
and restorations.  Very relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere!

<a name="2">Subject: What to drink while smoking</a>

First, a moment to praise the angel I married. I smoke cigars outside
because I can't stand the smell of a used cigar. She let me move her
favorite leather chair and a table into our covered entryway so I could
smoke dry during the eight months of rain we get every year. When it
got cold she dug up a mat to keep my feet off the chilly cement. She
prefers I smoke the pipes inside, she loves the smell of the English blends.

So on to the question. Sometimes she feels compelled to bring me a bit of
a tipple when I'm smoking (she doesn't drink herself, but she makes a
career out of spoiling me). What should I order? I don't like to drink
Scotch while smoking, I think it detracts from the peat. I generally like
port with cigars, but I don't know anything whatsoever about ports, does
anybody have any specific recommendations? and, what else do you think
goes with a good cigar or a bowlful of strong latakia blend?

<a name="3">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #204 -- November 21, 1995</a>

Hi Steve,

First let me thank you for this wonderful service. As a relatively new
subscriber I have not yet submitted a letter to the digest and it will be a
thrill to do so. 

My comments are in response to James Lawson's letter in Digest #204 in which
he describes an instance of discrimination in an airport lounge, and his
reaction to that treatment. 

Just last night I went to one of my favorite coffee shops, in Berkeley,
California. The shop has an extensive outdoor patio where smoking is
expressly prohibited. I sat down with a book I been meaning to finish and
lit my Pipe - nobody said anything. 

That incident, in and of itself, does not constitute what would normally be
referred to as news. The point is that in Berkeley, where smoking is illegal
in all public areas (this includes the sidewalk) I was able to finish not
one, but two bowls in addition to my book and a few lattes. I will add that
I have had similar successes all around the Bay Area, and not just with
pipes, but with cigars too.

What makes these victories so astounding is the fact that I remember hearing
comments a few years ago, that it was easier to get away with molesting a
child on the sidewalk in Berkeley than to smoke a cigar, my questions:
What's happening? Why is it that cigars and pipes are becoming acceptable
again? Is it that they do not subscribe to the interests of under-aged
smokers and thus, draw less "heat" from the usual sources? Is it that I am
particularly lucky in my quest for smoke inhalation? 

I would like to hear other stories of public-pipe-smoking escapades,
successes an failures. Also, I think it would be of interest to readers to
share geographically related knowledge of pipe-smoke-friendly bars,
restaurants and cafes.

Take care and thank you for your support,
-Adam.

<a name="4">Subject: Young Smokers of America </a>

&gt;        In response to the strange looks that Jason Vagner gets in the smoke
&gt;shops as a 24 year old cigar smokers, I can definitely relate, I'm an 18
&gt;year old pipe smoker.

Boy if you young guys think it is bad now try going into Rich's Cigars in
the early 70's with a 18 year old baby face that looks like not a day over
13 and clumsily trying to buy a first cigar. The place was at the time
populated by these ancient clerks and Mr. Rich himself. The guy who "waited"
on me had thick glasses, very stooped shoulders and black socks. I remember
the socks so well because I was for the most part staring at he floor.
Anyway he carded me! For a cigar! He thrust a glass tubed Bering at me, I
handed him 85 cents and that was that. 

You go in Rich's now and the kids waiting on you have goatees and piercings.
The other day I actually bought a cigar from a "girl"! She seemed like she
knew her stuff too. Yow! Part of me kind of likes the change, but still the
old place was magical and in many ways completely right. In retrospect that
right of passage was just about perfect. 

And now as then I think a cigar looks better sticking out of an older face,
mine finally fits which is both sad and a relief. So baby facers if you're
gonna smoke stogies you'll just have to go though the odd looks and
occasional titters. Rest assured you do look as silly as I did. And for God
sake take off the band. 

OK this brings up a couple of issues. 

1. Anybody else want to reminisce about their first cigars?
2. What do other long time cigar smokers make of all these new smokers and
what I call the "Cigar Aficionado Effect", (which translates basically to
"great review, now out of stock")?

<a name="6">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #204 -- November 21, 1995</a>

Just a quick note to ask a question.  As a pipe smoker in the DC area, 
I've been having a difficult time finding some of my favorite tobaccos.  
When I moved here 6 years ago, I must admit that Earthworks was something 
that I remember including in my list of "pros" for choosing Washington.  
However, since that time, it's moved, become Greybeard's and , as I've 
been told, stopped ordering most of its pipe tobaccos while looking for a 
buyer (over a year now).  Someone in the last issue indicated they had a 
"sweet tooth" when it came to pipe tobaccos and I definitely fit into 
that category.  I have found replacements for the chocolate, vanilla and 
even the raspberries-n-cream varieties Earthworks used to have but I am 
still trying to find one they called "Black Forest".  As you'd guess, it 
had an aroma that was a cross between chocolate and strawberry.  I used 
to get more compliments on that one (and more requests from friends who 
said they'd consider a pipe if it always smelled that good!).  Does 
anyone have any ideas where it can be found (I tried mixing the chocolate 
and raspberry but since I'm not a tobacconist, it didn't turn out quite 
right and it wasn't the same!).  Also, someone (I forget who) had 
mentioned to me that they had found a chocolate mint tobacco.  Has anyone 
heard of this?
Quick asides, 1)Steve Wyman is correct.  As a former (and native)Bostonian, 
I agree:  Mike and Brookline News should be declared national treasures!  
2) Steve, Thanks for all the wonderful work you have done keeping us in 
touch with the rest of the pipe-smoking world (and belated congratulations!)

Alright.  I have a question.  I go to college here in Souther California, 
(University of California, Irvine for anyone who cares.)  A pipe-smoking 
friend of mine from San Diego were out enjoying a fine smoke of a nifty 
plum and vanilla aromatic mix, and we started having a debate.  Is it 
typical for one to inhale pipe tobacco?  I'd always heard that you really 
didn't do that, but he insisted many people he knows do inhale pipe 
tobacco.  If one does that, I'd imagine that the risks are greater, but 
maybe not.  Is pipe tobacco as potent as cigaretts?  I smoke maybe twice 
a day, and I don't inhale, but I was just curious.  Thanks again for the 
great service you provide, Steve.  I now find myself looking forward 
every week to getting my PD and seeing what all the pipe/cigar smoking 
brothers have to say.  Hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving.  Take care!

[ Most pipe smokers don't inhale.  Pipe tobacco is (IMO) much stronger
than cigarette tobacco; perhaps that's the reason. -S. ]

Good day


As an RAF fighter pilot in WW11 I really enjoyed smoking my Dunhill Pipes.

One day in a pub (The Crown) a gentleman who was a fighter pilot in WW1
gave me his smoking pipe which I still treasure (although I no longer smoke).
I am trying to find out more information about this pipe.I wonder if you
can help me?
The pipe is made of meersham in about 1910 by Dunhill - it is a beautiful
orange colour from the juices of tobacco and has a solid silver cap and band
around the stem. I was advised by Dunhill (many years ago) that the meersham
was solidified foam from the base of Victoria Falls in Africa.
If you can help me to confirm the above or get any additional information
about this pipe, I would be very grateful.

Have a good day

Hi Steve; Today I received an unsolicited mailing from the Highlander
Tobacco Company, Ltd. located in Jackson Heights, N.Y. The letter was
signed by Eammon Fitzsimmons the company's "Subscription Manager" and
contained a 1.5oz tobacco sample.The letter solicited me to join the
Company's "Blend-of-the Month Club" and advised that for an annual fee
of $59.95 I would receive a 1.5 oz sample of a special blend each
month; quarterly price specials; finest blends available and
convenient delivery. Now, by my math the samples' cost equates to
about $40/lb which strikes me as pretty pricey. In addition, there was
no enclosed information about the range of products offered, cost of
tobacco, description of blends, etc. Naturally I am predisposed to
supporting firms which cater to pipe smokers, but I am hesitant to pop
off a cheque for U.S.$60, ($80+/- Can) on the "if-come". Do any of the
members know of this firm and its products? Thanks and kind regards,

Dear Steve,
			I'm a failry new pipe smoker that has been
getting the Pipes Digest for about 2 months now and I fully enjoy the
discussions.  This is certainly a refreshing group of intelligent and
interesting people.
			I live in Gainesville, Florida, home of the
University of Florida Fight'n Gators, soon-to-be national college
football champions if all goes well. Sorry this football thing has me
overwhelmed for the moment; we just beat FSU, our major nemesis, last
weekend.  Anyway, Gainesville, to my current knowledge, does not cater
to the pipe smoker and I've met very few pipe smokers with whom to
converse.  We have a tobacco store in our shopping mall named, quite
unoriginally, the Smoke Shop, but it is manned by some very young
people.  Now before anyone takes offense, I hold nothing against young
people, but these young people run a smoke shop and readily admit they
know very little about pipes and pipe tobacco, go figure!.  So, the
Digest has been a source of information and electronic brotherhood, if
you will, for me.
			There are two things I've been meaning to
write and have never taken the time, so here goes.  First, I use
Pegasus email software on a Power Macintosh.  When I receive the
Digest mailings, I do not receive the entire document, I get the
message "Pegasus can only show the first 30,000 characters."  Do other
subscribers have this problem?  Is there anything I can do about it?
Second, one of the only two pipe smokers I've met is quite an
interesting gentleman and professor I work with here at UF named
Dr. Verner Fischelsweiger.  He helped me with my pipe smoking
endeavors in the begining by instructing me on bowl filling, drawing
technique and tobacco and pipe selection.  It is the latter two items,
pipes and tobacco, I'd like to address.  Fisch, as we affectionately
call him, introduced me to the Carey's Tobacco Co., a mail order
tobacconist.  In all the mailings I've read to date, I have yet to see
Carey's name mentioned.  I find Carey's very helpful, polite and
knowledgeable with quite a good selection of pipes and tobacco, they
carry cigars, too.  I'm at work while writing this and I unfortunately
do not have their address/phone number, but if anyone responds to this
inquiry over the next few mailings, I'll be happy to post it (that is,
provided they appear before the first 30,000 characters or I figure
out how to get the entire Digest!).  I'd be interested to hear of the
experiences of other Carey's customers.
			Well, I've just written my inaugural address
to the Pipes Digest.  It feels good to have a place to express my
thoughts with fellow puffers.  Thanks for maintaining this forum.  If
there is anyone out there that lives or works near me, email me at
"??????@??????.???.???" and we'll get together for a smoke.

Thanks again,
			Jacob Burks 

[ Thanks, Jacob! Hope someone here can help you with Pegasus. We have
Carey's in North Canton, OH in the Resource Guide, so someone must
have mentioned it sometime along the line! -S. ]

Steve,
I am extremely happy I have not been dropped from the mailing list during my
105-day hiatus.  I can't believe I haven't written for such a long time...Here
goes...

1.  In September I started working as a Data Conversion Operator (please don't
ask :-P) for the US Postal Service, and, with my new career (hah!) I was able
to move into my own place (thankfully devoid of "roomhates") in the enormous
city of Minier, IL (population 1300)  Though not *technically* associated with
the University anymore, I still assist in the music department from time to
time...so I have not lost my email address.  The last few months have been
wonderful...though they came at the expense of missing the three pipe shows I
had been hoping to attend (Columbus, Richmond, Louisville)  In the meantime, my
club is still around...meeting once a week at Rosie's Pub in
Bloomington--hoping to travel to more shows next year (especially after my
personal disaster at Indianapolis in July...I can laugh about it now, really
;-{)&gt; ) starting with Jay Milton's show in February...
    Would you please update my new address/phone for the Resource Guide?

2.  Also...Charlie Barley can no longer be reached at the number I gave you
earlier this year...I have been unable to contact him recently...I would
appreciate any information anyone could give me and/or the Resource Guide.
Thanks!

3.  In the Spring, I receieved some back issues of TPSE which featured some
artwork by Thom France.  I was really impressed with the depiction of his
youthful pipe-smoking characters, so I wrote to him, and, much to my surprise,
he called me back two days later and we talked for nearly three hours.  He
explained that I was one of three people who has written to him since he first
submitted his work back in 1988.  We've been keeping in close contact since
then...he sent me a book which was written by George O'Belmito entitled "A
Brief History of Youthful Pipe Smoking" which, according to Thom, was never
published.  Thom worked for George at his pipe shop in Colorado until George's
death a few years ago...since then, Thom has been trying to find any articles
or other writings he has published...if anyone has any information, it would be
greatly appreciated.

YBB&amp;CCC   "Tom never did collect nothin' but big freehands

San Francisco and Rome. Fritz's pipes make up some of the best pieces in my
collection . Paulo also continued in  his father's footsteps and made some
excellent pipes as well. Another fine pipe shop close by is Novelli, on Via

is a true pipe afficionado and welcomes visitors warmly. I guess this, my

snowy weather, with no pipe damage.

Any information or help will be appreciated,

company that makes them was bought out by someone else, but that 
product will continue to be produced.  This information was 
submitted to a letter to the Pipe Smoker's Ephemeris, published 
by Tom Dunn, more information on this publication, I believe, has 
been put out elsewhere in the Pipes Digest.

<a name="18">Subject: Gallaher's Condor</a>

Hi!

I've just found out today that James Russell is no longer importing
Condor (or, more likely, Gallaher isn't exporting) from the U.K.  (The
reason: G. doesn't think it's worthwhile to add the legal fine print
versus its sales in the U.S.)

Do you have any suggestions of a way to buy it direct?  Via your
resource list, I wrote a quick note to one CIS address (Astley's, I
think), but in checking out the Digest, it seems that it's more likely
to sell pipes than tobacco.

I've been smoking Condor (ready rubbed or flake) for over 20 years,
and I just can't bear the idea of losing it!!  Of course, I could fly
to England, but that wouldn't be too cost-efficient (unfortunately).

Thanks for any suggestions!!

--Chet

P.S. I've just found your site today--I've been searching through the
web in the hope of coming across an English shop where I can buy
direct.  (My usual sources, J&amp;R as well as Arnold's Tobacco, are
already out of stock.)

Just as a little update to my previous post, I checked out the
A.I.T.S. tobacco index, and will probably fax the company with a
Condor request.

What a bother though!

How dangerous can tobacco be if the gov't can't even be bothered with
maintaining highway speed limits??

Dear Steve,
	Thank you for the subscription to your newsletter,it has a wealth of
imformation. I am 20, and go to unversity in Chicago and have been smoking for
a while now (cigars that is) and about six months ago was wondering about the
appeal of a pipe.
	So one day I went to Up Down Tobacco in Chicago and purchased a Chacom
pipe and a small pouch of their most popular cavendish (Queen Mary) and of
course the cleaning suplies. Upon buying I was told about how to take care of
as well as smoking the pipe by a member of their staff.
	Six months later and I have seemed to have lost the taste for cigars
and instead enjoy a good bowl of tobacco. I now go Iwan Ries because of the
better selection of pipes and I also enjoy their house tobaccos too.
	The only problem that I have found is that there is a big difference
between a 20 year old cigar smoker and a 20 year old pipe smoker probably
because cigar smoking is starting to become very popular. So it is great to get
your newsletter and hear that I am alone.
	Oh! Before I go could anyone tell me were I could get A Dunhill pipe
(not to expensive I am only a student) because I would love to add it to my
small, but ever growing collection. Till next time.

Steve, I have a question.  I just bought my first pipe and unfortunately 
I hadn't read your how-to letter yet and bought a cheap corncob pipe.  I 
was never able to get it lit.  It seemed that I could hardly get any air 
to come through it.  How large should the hole in the pipe stem at the 
bowl be.  This one was only about 2/10 of a centimeter in diameter.  Did 
I by a faulty pipe or was I doing something wrong?  I would appreciate 
any advice you could offer.

Thank you,

Hello, Steve,

  I just stumbled across something on the Web that other readers might find
useful:  a complete Yellow Pages of U.S. businesses.  It's at
<a href="http://www.niyp.com/">http://www.niyp.com/</a>

  The usefulness of this, of course, is that one can look up the address
and phone number of pipe shops all across the nation.  For example, I
discovered that there are 82 pipe shops in Southern California.  If I was
going to take a trip to, say, Colorado, I now know that there are 23 pipe
shops in the state.

  Might be handy for those with travel plans who would like to visit pipe
shops in the areas they'll be visiting.

Dear Sir,

I am preparing a study about the emigration from a region in Belgium to the
United States and Canada from 1830 - 1950.

Some of the emigrants around 1900 declared that they intended to settle in
Boston, Massachusetts as cigar maker.

I have been browsing various pages on the web, but haven't found any
related to the history of the cigar industry in the United States.

Could you guide me?

Hey Steve,

	I love the Digest!  Mashed potatoes and gravy, Steve.  I look forward
to getting every week.  I am a freshman (18 yrs. old) at Purdue University in
West Layfayette, IN.  Needless to say, there are not too many tobacco shops
around.  However, I am from Dallas, Texas and it was there that I started 
my pipe hobby.  This is the location:
			Edward's Pipe and Tobacco Shop
			1715 Promenade Center
			Richardson, TX  75080
			Tel: (214) 669-3087
	They are terrific!  Though I am only 18, the man who helped me
taught me everything about packing a bowl and selecting a nice
tobacco.  He treated me as his equal, not a precocious 18 year old
just starting out.  So, I selected a nice apple shaped pipe and a
GREAT Vanilla Cavindish and began my favorite hobby.  We sat and
talked about pipes and had a fabulous time.  I know many of you young
pipe smokers get strange looks from others out there, because believe
me I get them too.  I can empithise with you completely.  They choose
to berate and chastise you because they are too jealous and curious
about your distinguished hobby to accept their real feelings.  They
TOO want to smoke a pipe, and who wouldn't?, but they cannot let
themselves succome to such feelings for whatever reason.  It is this
same type of arcane, secrecy of TRUE feeling that leads people to hate
for no reason.  So, do not give up hope.  You and I know we like
smoking our collective pipes, so don't let them castigateyou.  You too
will find your own "Edward's" and fit in as I have.  Just don't give
up hope.

		Puff peacefully,

Steve,

For those pipe smokers who find themselves in the Montgomoery, AL area and are
in need of a good tobacco shop, there is The Tobacco Leaf, Delchamps Plaza,
Atlanta Highway (just east of Eastern Blvd overpass), Mongomery, AL.  They
have a fine assortment of pipe tobaccoes, accessories, and a huge selection
of cigars.  That's the only shop I've found in SE Alabama so far!

Spent a week on Thanksgiving vacation and neglected to bring my pipe with me.
By the end of the week I was showing physical signs of withdrawal!  Since I've
been back, I've smoked a bowl every night.  Does this mean I'm addicted?

Hi Steve,

[ Administrativa deleted. -S. ]

On another matter... tobacco... Have you ever tried Ogdens Walnut flake? It
used to be sold here years ago and I thought it had gone the way of all
things but I went downtown on saturday and there it was. OGdens W. Flake!
So I bought a pack and boy was that a mistake! This stuff is strictly for
the few. It left a sour taste in my mouth for the next 24 hours. Even strong
coffee and Peppermint didn't shift the taste. Yech! If thats what perique
tastes like I'll leave it alone. Very definately a matter of one mans
tobacco being another mans poison.

Looking forward to the next digest to cure the indigestion.

[WIFELY NOTE] Jean says to say hello to the pipeies (though she didn't
tell me how to spell it.)  So hello, pipeies!  

(However, she didn't tell me what to say to, or call, the cigar
enthusiasts here.  But then she has kind of an aversity to cigars, so
that's probably best anyway. :-)

This is going to be a pretty long issue; lots of new members and
enjoyable submissions since #205!  So, if you will, please allow me to
fill up a sandblast Nording with, lessee, Apricots &amp; Cream, put the
keyboard to the bits, and chew the stem with you for awhile.

Lest we forget: to all, a happy holiday season!  (And, if #207 doesn't
hit the Net until 1996, we wish you a New Year without a bitten tongue
or dry cigar in the whole house.)

<a name="2">Subject: PIPES_DIGEST: A continued thanks...</a>

I just wanted to share a happy "Thanks again" for the pipes 
digest.  I haven't picked up my pipe in about three months.  
I picked up on cigarettes again (it's an ongoing battle), 
and kept looking at my pipe, longlingly, waiting for it to 
speak... to say, "It's time to come back to me and start 
giving up those cigarettes again".

Tonight, reading the pipes digest, I glanced down at a pile 
of cigarette butts in the ashtray - too many to count.  
Halfway through the digest, I picked up the pipe, walked 
briskly to the store and picked up a very basic Cavendish 
(something interesting called "Amphora" - with a shredded 
tobacco... something I'm not used to), packed the pipe, lit 
up, and I was in heaven again!

Thanks again for the inspiration!  For a time, at least, I 
will be moving away from cigarettes.

God bless every one of ya!

Recently I acquired a special lighter, an old Zippo, that my grandfather used
for as long as I can remember and as long as my Dad can remember.  Along 
with this special keepsake, there was a bag of pipes which had screw on bowls.
Do you or anyone else know anything about these?  I would suspect that they 
aren't that rare or valuable, but I'm more interested in their history 
rather than their value.  Also in this bag is a still in the cellophane 
wrapper pouch of tobacco (Sir Raleigh I believe).  If I recall, the price 
was still on it--45 cents or so.

Thanks for the help and info.

[ Change of address deleted. -S. ]

Brothers (and sisters) in blue smoke,

I've only written once, and that was a while ago, so allow me to 
introduce myself again.  

I am 22 years old (but I won't be for long--apologies to Paul Simon) and 
have been an enlightened smoker of cigars for about a year.  I got 
introduced to cigar smoking at a Christmas party by a neighbor of mine.  
As we sat there (outside on the porch, natch) I realized the power that 
fine tobacco has--smoking cigars together means sharing more than 
second-hand smoke!

When I was in college at the University of Chicago, I loved to go to Iwan
Ries on Wabash Ave.  The aromas of the hallway leading to the store
reminded me that once I entered, all troubles would vanish.  The selection
at IR is wide, and the service is fantastic.  I developed a personal
rapport with one of the workers which always helped to impress friends. 
I'd walk in with a non-smoking friend, and Tony would say, "Hey, Matthew, 
how're you doing?"  This would stun my companion.  A pity that service 
like that used to be de rigeur and is now so hard to find.

I also joined a newly-formed club called the Chicago Cigar Internet 
GRoup (CCIGR).  It was started by Rick Devries, who simply e-mailed 
anyone who posted to alt.smokers.cigars from the Chicago area and asked 
them if they wanted to help form the group.  Although I was the youngest 
there by about 10 years, I had a great time at each meeting.  If there 
are PD readers in the Chicago area who are interested in joining, check 
out their WWW page, accessible from the Fuji Cigar Page

<a href="http://www.netins.net/showcase/fujicig">http://www.netins.net/showcase/fujicig</a>

Now I am in graduate school at Harvard, and I was pleased to find a fine 
cigar store right in Harvard Square, Leavitt and Peirce.  Spoiled as I 
am, though, I must admit this shop pales in comparison to IR.  However, 
they do have a good selection, along with beautiful lighters, humidors, 
and other "men's accessories" (or so I hear; one of these days I'm going 
to look at those, too, I guess).  I don't rue the smaller selection as 
much as I do the lack of good service.  Like Robin Willis said in PD 
#205, the salesclerks are goateed and pierced, which is irrelevant, but 
what gets me is that they know less about cigars than I do, so it's kind 
of hard to ask advice.  But I seem to manage.  I will be checking out 
other cigar shops in the Boston area soon, though.

One last thing--I am seriously thinking about attending the Boston Big 
Smoke on February 26, 1996.  Is anybody out there from the Boston area 
also thinking about going?  I'd really hate to go all by myself.

Okay, that's all.  I'd like to say "great job" to Steve for putting this 
together and thanks to all the posters who brighten my day once a month.  

Smoke in Peace,
Matt

<a name="5">Subject: Pipe Digest</a>

Steve, I have been reading the postings in Pipes Digest for about the
past five months, and have gained a great deal of information, Thanks
to all. I am looking for two things currently. First I am looking for
other Canadian Pipe Smokers that would like to join the Ohio Pipe
Collectors Canadian Chapter. If you are out there please get in touch
with myself and I will direct you to the right person/s. Also I am
looking for a good Dunhill lighter repair shop. One that is in North
America, as the last repair done for me by Dunhill of London was short
lived. Any help in these areas would be appreciated. Thanks
Again. Mike.

From: Miguel Llinas Jr &lt;mxlst5+@pitt.edu&gt;
<a name="6">Subject: Drum tobacco and pipe</a>

Steve,

I would like to ask my fellow pipe smokers...brought together by your 
wonderful work (we can't thank you enough)...whether anyone has tried 
smoking the famous Dutch handrolling tobacco DRUM in a pipe.  I was told 
to try this, as I am also an avid handrolled cigarette fiend (but only 
DRUM) and I enjoy the sensation of inhaling smoke.  It would seem like a 
good idea, as Drum is perhaps one of the best tasting (as it is naturally 
preserved beautifully cut Turkish tobacco) tobaccos readily available.

As I have already asked for opinions, I will now ask that people try 
this (only if you enjoy inhaling...this is not for just any pipe 
smoker).  The benefits are four (as far as I might deduce):  (1.)  
inexpensive...very  (2.)  tastes great...really  (3.)  no cigarette paper 
involved...thus no harshness...purely smoooooooooth  (4.)  INHALATION 
(well, for me, that's a biggy).

ok.  i'm not sure how many people will think i'm insane, or not, or 
whatever...but it really is great stuff, and everyone ought to try it 
once.  i did, and i truly thought it was great.  heck, you don't even 
HAVE to inhale, you can just puff away and not ingest a tiny little bit.  
ah...the pleasures of home cookin'.

no exit,

<a name="7">Subject: Ohio Pipe Collectors &amp; Reamers</a>

Steve, as the holidays draw nigh and we all begin hoping for a new pipe(s)
in our Christmas stocking, I'd like to give a short report on the Ohio Pipe
Collectors.  As I write, we stand at 103 dues-paying members, three of whom
are community-hungry individuals from British Columbia who have just formed
the Canadian chapter of the OPC.  We are, of course, just two months down
the road from our very successful Sept. swap/sell show, and we have already
scheduled bigger and better shows for Sept. 14, 1996, and Sept. 24, 1997.
 
Our (huge) Dec. newsletter will be hitting the mail about the time Digest
206 appears.  It will feature a profile of Ohio pipemaker Tim West (third
in a series), a new column on pipe repair by long-time professional Jeff
Walls, and much, much more. With it, as a Christmas bonus, I will be
mailing copies of the front cover (featuring the lovely and talented
Gabrielle Sempf smoking a nice Peterson) and the five inside pages of text
and pictures taken by Neil Murray at our show and published in the last
issue of the Agricultural &amp; Mechanical Gazette.  I invite all your readers
who think they might like to belong to the OPC (only $12 a year) to write
me for a complimentary copy of the newsletter and a membership form.  Don't
be fooled by our name-- we now have members from many states and foreign
countries.
 
On a different note, in #205, Ralph Webb asks about reamers.  The best tool
I've ever found is a tool consisting of a T-handle and four variously sized
4-sided carbon steel reamers that fit into it.  Many pipe shops carry this
tool, but I got mine from Carey's (they call it the Pipnet Reamer) for
$19.95.  Call Carey's at 1- 800-99BRIAR to order or get on their mailing
list.
 
As I sit here smoking my new Steve Weiner, obtained at his special show at
Barclay Pipe &amp; Tobacco last Saturday, and my McLelland 2015, I wish you,
your new bride, and all your pipe- smoking subscribers (well, OK, the cigar
smokers too) a very happy holiday season.  Even a whupping by the
Wolverines and the failure of the Buckeyes to make it to the Rose Bowl
shall not tarnish for me or lessen my good will toward pipe smokers
everywhere, even our brothers from Michigan, still known as "the state up
north" by some in these
parts.

If you've got one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you've got more than
one, you're a pipe collector.

<a name="8">Subject: cigar history</a>

Regarding Mr. Picavet's request for information about the
history of New England cigar makers, I would recommend
consulting ONCE A CIGAR MAKER: MEN, WOMEN, AND WORK CULTURE
IN AMERICAN CIGAR FACTORIES, 1900-1910 by Patricia A. Cooper
(Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1987).  It may be out
of print by now, but it should be readily available at a
university library or through interlibrary loan.
        Allow me to quote from the dust jacket for a
synopsis.  "Cooper charts the course of competition,
conflict, and camaraderie among American cigar makers during
the two decades that preceded the mechanization of their
work.  In the process, she reconstructs the work culture,
traditions, and daily lives of the male cigar makers, who
were members of the Cigar Makers' International Union of
America (CMIU) and of the nonunion women who made cigars
under a division of labor called the 'team system.'  But
Cooper not only examines the work lives of these men and
women, she also analyzes their relationship to each other
and to their employers during these critical years of the
industry's transition from hand craft to mass production."
        I found it an interesting, albeit at times tedious
book.  Labor history is not my forte, though, so I can't
comment much on how this book fits into the historiography
of the field.  Cooper does include a bibliographic essay
that might prove useful in guiding you to other sources.
        I hope this helps.  I'm always glad to mix history
with tobacco.

From: ????????@???.??? (Ed Berggren)
<a name="9">Subject: Whiskey, Cigars, Matches</a>

Hello, Steve,

  Just received and read PD #205 and thought, with your kind indulgence,
that I'd respond to some of the questions/comments made therein.

  Martin Golding (??????@?????.??.???.???) wrote regarding what to drink
while smoking:
"I don't like to drink Scotch while smoking...does anybody have any
specific recommendations?"
  May I humbly recommend an Irish whiskey which doesn't have the smoky
flavor that Scotch has.  Bushmills is my personal favorite.  Their basic
blended whiskey runs about $13 a bottle at the local supermarket (So.
California prices).  Harder to find and more expensive is their 10-year old
single malt called, surprisingly enough, Bushmills Single Malt (about $30 a
bottle).  Very smooth.  In the middle is Black Bush, their high-end blend
at around $23 a bottle.  I like this one a lot and drink it with either a
pipe or cigar.  It's also very smooth and has, IMHO, a richer flavor than
the single malt.  All three are worth drinking.

  Robin Willis (?????@?????????.???) asked:
"What do other long time cigar smokers make of all these new smokers and
what I call the 'Cigar Aficionado Effect' (which translates basically to
'great review, now out of stock')"
  I think it's great for a couple of reasons: 1) it's causing younger
people to pick up the gentle art of smoking which means that it won't die
out; and 2) it helps keep tobacconists in business which is good,
especially when I need to replenish my supplies.  The CA reviews don't
usually affect me because they tend to sing the praises of larger sizes.
The smaller sizes that I prefer are usually in stock.

  Mark Lathem (??????@???????.????.???) offered "three (albeit slight)
advantages of Swan Vestas over Diamonds and Blue Tips."  In friendly
rebuttal, I herewith offer two advantages of Rosebud matches (made, I
believe, by Diamond) over Swan Vestas:

1)  Rosebuds are cheaper.  I paid 35 cents for a box of 90 Vestas.  At the
grocery store I can get 320 Rosebuds for 70 cents.
2)  Rosebuds are about 1/8-inch longer.  Not much, I grant you, but useful
when you need just that extra second to get your pipe going nicely.

--Ed

[Personally, I don't think Rosebuds are made by Diamond though I
haven't checked); I've also had problems with the former coming apart
under the stress of being lit.  If you can't get Swans, Diamonds are
the best I've found. -S. ]

<a name="10">Subject:       Finest in Ports</a>

Dear Martin,

Having just finished our Winetasting Society's Port tasting (and as a 
passionate lover of Port myself) I feel quite qualified to 
recommendation a selection of fine Port for smoking with a pipe.  

In selecting a Port it is really necessary to decide how much you 
want to spend as Port prices can get quite high for older vintages.  
After deciding the price range you are comfortable with, here are 
some recommendations:

Dow's Crusted 10 Year-Old  ($20 - amazing quantity of sendiment) 
Graham's Malvedos ($26)
Graham's Six Grapes ($16 - personal preference)
Graham's Vintage 1985 ($65 - may be a little young)

<a name="11">Subject: What to drink while smoking</a>

Martin Goldman's entry about smoking and drinking
brouhgt forth fond memories from my reading of mysteries.

&gt;What should I order? I don't like to drink
&gt;Scotch while smoking, I think it detracts from the peat. I generally like
&gt;port with cigars, but I don't know anything whatsoever about ports, does
&gt;anybody have any specific recommendations? and, what else do you think
&gt;goes with a good cigar or a bowlful of strong latakia blend?

Are you aware of that drinking port while smoking a cigar
is liable to get you thrown out of  posh British clubs? 
According to authorities G. K. Chesterton and Dorothy 
Sayers, that is simply Not Done.

Sayers' Lord Peter Wimsey in the story 
"The Abominable History of the Man with the 
Copper Finger" condemns it absolutely,
while pipe and beer is accepted.

In Chesterton's story "The Crime of the Communist" 
the murderer's plan hinges upon that a certain radical 
Oxford don will not smoke untill the wine is finished.
To quote Father Brown in that story:
"Well hang it all, he was only an atheist. He only wanted to
abolish God. He only wanted to destroy the ten
Commandments and root up all the religion and
civilization that had made him, and wash out all
the common sense of ownership and honesty;
and let all his culture and his country be flattened
out by savages from the end of the earth. That is
all that he wanted. You have no right to accuse him
of anything else beyond that. Hang it, everybody 
draws the line somewhere! And you come here and 
suggest that a Mandeville man of the old generation
would have begyn to smoke - or even strike a match,
while he was still drinking the College Port of the 
vintage '08 - no,no; men are not so utterly without
law and limits as all that!"

You are warned!

As to my own taste - a beer and a pipe is 
sufficient. On special occasions a single Malt
sipped while smoking. Or a medium dry sherry.
Whatever it is, it must not be too sweet.

Smoke in piece - anything that tastes right 
is right.

BTW your wife is very much worthy of
the praise you give! Anymore like her out there?

<a name="12">Subject: Smoking calabash outside</a>

Dear Steve,

I read John Peter Giunta's query about smoking a calabash outside.
I have had a calabash for about 2 years now, and the only place I smoke the
thing is outside.  Although my wife loves the smell of fresh burning
tobacco, she is not fond of it the next day.  I must admit, stale smoke is
not my favorite either.  Living in So. California makes life very easy for
the out of doors smoker.  Anyway, I digress.  The pipe is indeed quite
healthy, and has not suffered one whit from it's out of doors adventures. I
do not smoke in windy conditions, but generally if it is windy, getting a
pipe lit is a hassle, and I would not enjoy a face full of burning embers
blowing out anyway! Given gentle handling and respect for the pipe, I do not
think that smoking the calabash outside will have any negative affect on it.
Your comment about the pipes being large and unwieldy are correct-  I would
not fancy mowing the lawn with the thing clamped in my teeth!  The calabash
is most suited for a nice lawn chair and a fine single malt scotch....
Besides, good leaf requires time to produce, and therefore requires proper
time and concentration to fully enjoy. Cigar or pipe, it matters not.
Either one is just as refined and civil as the other.  It is a matter of
whim and indulgence.
Thanks for the Digest.  It is a fine read on one of life's simple yet
elegant pleasures.

Sincerely yours,

Tim Sweeney

Hi Steve,
	As always, I enjoy your Digest very much but I have one 
observation/complaint/request (take it as you will): I only smoke 
cigars and are thus only interested in the cigar information.
I have smoked cigars for about 4 years now and have enjoyed 
reading about other people's experiences with them, but to be perfectly 
honest I am not really interested in the pipe information that comes 
with the Digest, I just can't relate.

I don't know how many people would be interested in receiving 
"dedicated" issues of the Digest, be it cigar, pipe, or both?

Would it be a possiblity if enough people are interested?

to edit, but that anyone else who cares to put out a cigar-only

long-term commitment to a lot of people.  Watch this space for further

     Re - Gallaher's Condor
     
     Steve,
     
     many thanks for my first few issues of the digest which I have found 
     very interesting, particularly since I am fairly new to pipe smoking 
     and have much to learn from the more experienced correspondents.
     
     I may be able to help regarding Chet Gottfried's request for a mail 
     order supplier of Condor. I found a small smoke shop while on holiday 
     this summer, they offer a wide range of quality cigars, pipes and 
     tobaccos (including some of Gawith and Hoggarth's range) and will mail 
     any order of UKP 10 or more within the UK. I'm afraid I don't know 
     whether they will mail order to the US but it's probably worth a try - 
     they were very helpful and knowledgable in the times I have dealt with 
     them. The address is :
     
     West Cornwall Cigar Company
     Captain Cutter House
     Chapel Street
     Penzance
     Cornwall
     England
     
     Best of luck obtaining supplies Chet, please let me know how you get 
     on.
     
     I wonder if anyone can offer me some advice on clay pipes ? I bought a 
     couple of clays from an antique shop recently for UKP 1 each. One of 
     them is shaped like the head of general de Gaulle and inscribed with 
     the legend "vive la France". The other is inscribed with the legend 
     "the shepherd" and has a picture of a bearded man smoking a pipe on 
     one side, and a shepherd's crook on the other side. The shop owner 
     said that they were probably reproductions and not really all that 
     old. Does anyone know how old these things are and whether they are 
     still made ?
     
     They had clearly never been smoked due to the spotless condition and 
     I've tried a couple of bowlfuls in one of them when the other pipes in 
     my limited collection were all needing a rest. It really wasn't bad, 
     quite cool and pleasant to begin with, although the bowl and the smoke 
     got pretty hot when more than half the bowl had been smoked. 
     
     One of my friends told me that I shouldn't smoke the pipes at all and 
     they were intended as decorative ornaments. Are some clay pipes 
     intended not to be smoked, and if so how can they be distinguished 
     from the more functional ones? I like to smoke all of my pipes if 
     possible, but don't want to ruin the pipes by smoking them if they're 
     not intended for this. Do clay pipes smoke better if a layer of cake 
     is allowed to build up as for briar?
     
     I'm also interested in why clay pipes went out of fashion, was it due 
     to the superior smoking qualities of briar and meerschaum, or due to 
     the fragile nature of the clays? At such a low cost they can be 
     treated almost as a disposable item - ideal for the throwaway society!
     
     Any advice would be very much appreciated,
     
     yours,

Hi Steve &amp; Friends !
It was nice to come back home after almost one month , switch my PC on and
find the PD there ! 
Thanks again for your service Steve !!
On my way back from Sudan I enjoyed a stop over in Rome where I visited ( as
I  promised to myself ) the  pipe shop of Backer &amp; Musico' . Sitting on
their sofa , we discussed if it was t time for me to buy my first Dunhill
pipe . I am resisting the idea of this purchase , although many of my fellow
pipe mates regard the possession  of a Dunhill as an upgrade in ones smoking
life .
 I am not very found of Dunhill pipes , first becouse of the awfully high
price and then because  the Dunhill shop in London is one of the coldest
pipe shop I have ever been in .They sell pipes together with shirts , ties ,
pens and other fancy items . This makes their pipes and their tobaccos just
as an accessory to some expensive dress . Often the guy behind the pipe
counter is the same that sold ties or shoes the day before  and he is not
always able to satisfy the endless curiosity of a pipe smoker in a pipe shop .
I hope to read  some more positive comments on Dunhill pipes on the next PD
issues .

Still sitting on the B&amp;M sofa , I smoked their blend : a mixture of White
Balkan and Black &amp; White . The Black &amp; White is meant to soften the taste of
the Balkan .
Being an english blend  smoker I have smoked Balkan ( white ) for 3 years
now , I have sometimes smoked Dunhill 695 ( too strong ) and J. Upshall (
green shield ) . Although I love the Balkan I am now  curious to try   new
english blends . 
I' m sure that the PD fellows will assist me on this matter with tips and
suggestions  !

Smoke in peace

Hey, Steve:

I'm a new subscriber gradually getting the hang of Pipes Digest. Took me
awhile to realize that it is best appreciated when day is done, feet are
up, wife's in bed and perique's in the air. So, now I save 'em and peruse
contentedly via laptop in the late evening. (Maybe you should include
instructions when you confirm new subscribers. PD goes particularly well
with Nightcap!)

Anyway, I've noticed your growing subscriber list, and I asssume that PD
will follow the path cut by Marvin Shanken and Cigar Aficianado. I want to
be first to volunteer to write for PD about driving racing Nissan's, buying
my own island, gambling at mob watering holes, looking at the breasts of
women I don't know, being an entertainer and all the other things which are
apparently integral to cigar smoking. What kind of salary can I expect from
PD, and how will you reproduce photos of the fabulous raw diamonds I expect
to buy and describe?

OK, sorry for shooting off my mouth, but I'm sort of wondering outloud
whether appreciation of fine tobacco must now go hand in hand with
unabashed exhaltation of wealth and sensuality. I just don't think so. Bet
there are a LOT of us who deeply enjoy a good smoke, whether cigar or pipe,
but find this recent hyped-up hedonism stuff slightly embarassing. I'm glad
for what CA's done for the cigar industry, but good grief, Marvin!

Tremendously appreciate your contribution of time for the benefit of all PD
subscribers of ALL grades and stripes. Keep up the great work Steve!

Dear Steve,

While I don't participate vocally in each debate, I certainly enjoy
receiving the Digest.  It is always a welcome respite in the day.  Now on to
the Cuban stories.

In the course of my business (custom picture framing) I meet alot of
interesting people.  
and, when the topic moves in that direction, chat about cigars.  One of the
people with whm I spoke, was going on her honeymoon to Aruba.  I jokingly
suggested that  if she were a cigar smoker I would ask her to bring me back
some Cubans.  Ha ha ha!  Well, you know what they say about being careful
about what you ask for - two weeks later she returns to my shop with a
genuine Cuban cigar.  Not my favorite shape - it was 4" x 38 and I prefer a
much larger size - but delicious none the less.  Now, of course was the
dilema of where to smoke this little baby.  I couldn't think of a better
place than at my local tobbaconist.  Boy was everybody jealous when they
noticed the band with yellow and black and white checks.  Alas, after 30 far
too short minutes it was gone.  Now I eagerly awaiting and expected
selection of Cubans from a friend who will be returning from travels
overseas next week.  His sole request when I asked him to bring me back
Cuban cigars - visit him in jail when he gets caught.  I told just tell the
customs officer that we realize the cigars are contraband and intend to
destroy them.  One at a time, slowly!

Greetings!  First let me say that I'm happy every week to receive the 
Digest.  I find it entertaining and informative.  Steve really provides a 
service for us all.  Now, I try to chime in weekly with a comment or a 
question for the readers out there.  I like to smoke many different kinds 
of pipe tobacco.  I live in Southern California, and therefore have 
available to me many places that sell pipe tobacco.  I enjoy the pleasant 
smelling aromatic tobaccos out there.  Right now, I'm smoking a fantastic 
plum and vanilla mixture from The Tinder Box.  My question, however, is 
this:  Has anyone out there ever heard of a cinnamon (or similarly 
flavored) based pipe tobacco?  I know it's a weird question, but cinnamon 
is one of my favorite tastes and I just wanted to ask.  I was in Virginia 
about 6 weeks ago and talked to a tobacconist there.  He said that he 
hadn't seen one, but felt that it would be pretty easy to make.  Anyway, 
I'll shut up.  Take care everybody.

<a name="20">Subject: Minneapolis shops and misc ramblings</a>

Steve, Thanks for the great service with Pipes Digest!  I came across
the PD while checking out the Fuji Cigar Page.  I thought PD might be
interesting, so I downloaded a couple.  Well, that simply whetted my
appetite.  I have since read all the back issues, and look forward to
each new update.  Great stuff, I must admit.  And the FAQ on Humidors
is spot on!  No more soggy smokes for me.

I have not yet fired up a pipe, but I enjoy a fine cigar.  My current
favorite is the A. Fuente Double Chateau, which comes wrapped in its
own cedar closet!  The cigar (when lit properly) has a lovely hint of
cedar when smoked because of this close proximity to the wrap, I would
assume.  It is a great complement to a pot of Twinings Russian Caravan
Tea, which also has a light, woodsy/smoky flavor.  I have not yet
found the perfect single malt scotch to accompany this cigar with, but
I have tried some of the lowlands which have that smoky peat flavor.
Laphroiag and Balvenie 12 year doublewood both seen too smoky for this
cigar.  Cardu and Dahlwhinnie, (not lowland scotch) are too quiet.
Any ideas, fellow readers?

This is my first year at _seriously_ trying cigars.  In the past, I
would occasionally have a (yuk) Swisher or King Edwards out on the
deck about once a year.  Last September I visited Morton's Steak House
in Minneapolis, and came across a full humidor and Cigar Aficionado
(Bill Cosby) at the coat check.  I selected a cigar, and the gal said
it would be twelve bucks.  Too rich for my tastes at that time, so for
about five bucks I picked up CA and thought I would read about these
spendy little items before blindly clunkning down my hard- earned
money.

Interesting rag it was!  It did not persuade me to part with twelve
bucks a smoke, but it did give me some additional knowledge for me to
make wise choices on my own.  Of course, using the I-Way to get cigar
and pipe info to my desk has been a real eye-opener.  Armed with a
small (and dangerous) amount of information, I went to the nearest
tobacconist.  I did not see him in your Guide, so you may wish to add
him:

Tobacco Road          Other Branches are located at:
3517 Hazelton Road     831 Marquette Ave      27 South 7 St.   
Edina, MN 554??        Minneapolis MN         Minneapolis MN
in the Yorktown Mall   612/333-1315          612/???-????
612/831-2991

I selected a few Macanudos, some in maduro wrappers, some in natural.
I believe they were the Prince Phillips.  With my wife out of town, I
savored the unwrapping of the first Maduro and the smells sent my mind
back thirty years to my grandfather's home.  These smelled just like
his den when I was five years old.  What a powerful image!  I couldn't
wait to light it!  The smell of the freshly lit cigar was wonderful.
After a short time, I started to become disappointed.  The cigar had
an awfully tight draw and it was difficult to get much smoke out of
it.  I was thoroughly disappointed by the end.  All that work to get
my first good smoke, and it was a flop!  The following evening I tried
some of the natural wrapped Macanudos, and while the smell of the
unlit cigar didn't sent me down memory lane, the smoke was divine.  I
was sold on cigars.  I tried other Macanudos, including the Caviar for
my commute, but some of the larger ones had uneven burns.

I tried another shop in town, just north of downtown Minneapolis,
which I heard had the largest walk-in humidor in town, again not in
the Digest's Guide.

Surdyk's Liquor                (612) 379-3232
303 East Hennepin Ave NE
Minneapolis, MN 55???

A much greater selection and a beautiful presentation.  The Humidor
was about the size of a two-butt kitchen, so with a few people inside,
it got tight.  One curious thing was the lighting.  Quartz-halogen
spotlights which kept the top row of 'gars warm to the touch!  The
room was cool, (70 degrees F), but I would worry about the worm
problem.  needless to say, I didn't buy any of the HOT items!  I did,
however, buy a VCentennial Churchill which was on sale.  They seemed a
bit dry to me, so I put a damp tissue in the ziplock bag for a few
days.  Dumb move!  Too much moisture, too fast, caused the wrap to
start to split at the end.  As I smoked it, the damn thing kept
splitting ahead of the burn.  Tasty smoke, but it was a disappointment
because of the split and subsequent weird burn.  I learned my lesson.
&gt;From that point I decided all my cigars would be properly stored.
Thus enter the Humidor FAQ.  This is a MUST READ for any cigar smoker!
I have purchased some propylene glycol, oasis foam, and made some
credo units which I am keeping in wood boxes I've lined with spanish
cedar.  Much better!

While at Surdyks, I saw an ad for a cigar and port dinner.  I signed
up with a friend and we had a great time!  Davidoff #3, 3000 and
Special T (torpedo) along with four ports, grouper and duck.  Great
time and good smokes!  The real eye- opener was the Davidoff _cedar_
matches.  Four inches of wood mean only one (sometimes two) match(s)
to light up.  I did some experimentation to see if the lighting method
really made a difference, as some people claimed (see Jack Nicklson's
interview in CA summer 95).  Yup, big difference in my book.  Makes
sense too, if you see the soot that gets on things in direct contact
with the flame.  I hold the cigar in front of me, not in my mouth, and
rotate it _above_ the flame.  (hold the match nearly vertical to keep
the flame concentrated to a point) It takes a while to get the gar
evenly lit, then put it to your lips and _blow out_ before taking any
drags.  This clears out the nasties from the flame.  Try it yourself
and I think you will agree.  Unfortunately, this is nearly impossible
to do outside if there is any breeze.  I have tried this technique
with a fluid style lighter, plain wood matches, and the cedar matches.
There is a noticeable difference between each.

I have found it very difficult to locate tobacconists in the
Minneapolis/St.Paul area, so I thought I would give you a few more to
add to The Guide.  One is a news stand/baseball card/fantasy book
store with a walk-in humidor.  The selection is fairly broad and the
prices low.  It is about a block west of Tobacco Road in Edina, which
puts it that much closer for me.  Just don't expect much from the help
(although a couple of the guys know their stuff, but they are not
always available).  They also give away cigar boxes, or charge a buck
for all wood numbers.

---------------------------------------------------
The Golden Leaf in the Calhoun Square shopping center is what I think an old-

cigars.  It is worth checking out if you are ever in the Uptown area.

Golden Leaf Tobacco
3001 Hennepin Ave So
Minneapolis MN 
612/824-1867
---------------------------------------------------
Across the Mississippi River in St.Paul, there is a shop called Tobak
and News which contains some pipes, tobacco and cigars in a large
walk-in humidor stuck way in the back.  Lots of gift stuff and cards
too (yuk).  The humidor is not well stocked in my opinion, but I stop
by every week on the way to my night school classes (MBA).  The stock
is the lower end of the cigar price spectrum, but eventually I may
find some gems. I try about one or two different types each week.  I
must admit they have some very reasonably priced humidors, and for
that fact alone are worth a visit!

Another spot in Minneapolis which I have not yet visited is Liquor

him a visit.  He must have a fun job!

Liquor Depot
1010 Washington Ave S
Minneapolis MN 
612/339-4040
-------------------------------------------------

I have seen some other postings from people in the Minneapolis/St.Paul
area.  Are you guys/gals willing to share other locations?  The yellow
pages in St.Paul do not even contain Tobacconist, and in Minneapolis
there are two listing.  Seems most places that sell cigars do it as a
sideline, so they aren't listed in the yellow pages as such.  Lets
help each other out.  (Also, any cigar-friendly resaurants around?)

In closing, I wish to add the address for Lewis Pipe and Cigar, 512
Nicollet Ave So, Minneapolis MN.  Rich Lewis is in the guide under the
repair section, but he has a full collection of Davidoffs I've been
told. :) I am sure his shop is well stocked.  I have looked for the
spot in the past, but without the address, it was impossible.  I plan
to visit there soon, as he co-sponsored a smoker this last week in
Minneapolis which I brought 7 buddies to.  Great smokes and fine
dining!

Until next time, Happy Holidays and enjoy a few puffs!

first.  Looks like we will have to conserve those few we have left &lt;G&gt;

To Jack Scheible,
        I must agree with you about the curchwardens, 13 is pretty salty
compared to three.  I was in Williamsburg earlier this year, June to be
exact, and I saw the pipes in the small "mercantile" type shops in
Williamsburg.  I was also at the Pottery Factory (it's imense) but didn't
see them there.  I wonder if you could mail order them?
        
            Thanks,
                            Matt.

Dear Steve,

I read your article about pipe initialization on the WWW.  The great
tips made it really easy to break in my first pipe this weekend.  I
hope that you can answer my questions quickly because I am living in
Germany and will be returning to the US in a few days for some needed
holidays at home in California where I won't be able to email.

My question concerns the pipes you mentioned.  Albeit shopping in Germany is
difficult because of the world's most archaic opening and closing hours, but
when I went looking at several shops, I could not find either Petersons or
GBDs--what does that stand for anyways??  No one seemed to have ever heard
Petersons, I did not ask about GBDs.  I am a Denmark nut, so I wanted to get a
Peterson.

Petersons I presume come from Denmark.  In the shops I went to which
are not by any means all of them in Frankfurt where I live I only saw
"WO Larsen" pipes and tobaccos--the "O" in Larsen has the funny slash
in it which is used in Danish.  So my question is, do you know what
the relationship between Larsen and Petersen is?  Do they use
different names in different countries, did one take over the other
etc.  WO Larsen also makes tobaccos; I purchased a mild blend of
theirs.

After a few practice smokes at home, I went to a coffee house where
two other people were smoking pipes and I could learn quite a bit by
watching them.  One guy actually had a carrying case about the size of
a large text book with about 12 pipes in it.  Then a friend joined me
and as we were talking so much I hardly smoked.  I realize now
comparing this with some of my later smokes that smoking slowly lets
the pipe cool and the smoking is more pleasent, at least for me, this
way.  Maybe it was just that the pipe I got for pretty cheap does not
cool very well.  The only two words on it are Spitfire and Vicenza, so
I don't know if it is Italian or British.  I'll have to try a rough
pipe to see if it smokes cooler like you mentioned which brings me to
my second question: do you know if Petersons also come with this rough
finish?  If so, maybe I can find one in California.

Thanks again for the wealth of information on the internet.

[ Petersons are from Ireland; Larsen is an old Danish firm run by the
same family for generations.  The addresses of both are in the Guide.
BTW, "Spitfire" may be the worst name I've ever heard of for a pipe --
except for "Reject," one of which I own. :-) -S. ]

Dear Steve :
Here's a follow up to my post on DC pipe Show.

I would like the couple of members of the Group who attended my pipe show
at John B Hayes Tob. on December 2cd in the DC area. It was  a pleasure
meeting poeple you ve just been writing too. Thanx to Charles Beard for
bringing up some Hogarth Tobaccos for all to sample. I liked some of the
flakes.

The smoker in the morning was well attended and lots of tobacco was burned
and coffee drunk, we even sold a few pipes while swapping stories. Later
the real customers meandered off as ladies with kids in baby carriages came
in looking for a pipe for grandpa. I wished I could have left then too.

There were a few Fairfax regulars that I looked foward to seeing. Ben
Rappaport sometimes has dropped by in years past, also Warren Blatz, and
some of the guys from Corps ( Richmond)  Capt. Bob and John Weinstien. I
wonder if any of them are on line.Anyway  I missed them. The great thing
about any pipe show is you get to reaquaint yourself with a friend or
colleague as if no time has passed since your last conversation or meeting.
Change is eternal, they say, but it seems to move much slower in the pipe
world where the past is appreciated. Mark Tinsky

<a name="27">Subject: First post</a>

Dear Steve,

I got the back issues that you sent me and spent a good part of this last 
weekend reading them. I guess it's time for my first post!

I've been smoking pipes off and on (mostly off) since I was 20 (seven 
years ago) although it wasn't until recently that I have really 
recognized pipe smoking as a hobby and as an art. Since then, I have 
worked to expand my collection and experiment with different blends. 
Being on a graduate student's budget means some really exasperating 
limits to what I can do, but I've still managed to make a few acquisitions 
lately. My most recent was a beautiful freehand made from what looks like 
a maker named Nording (it was made in Denmark). It follows my preference 
for very large pipes.  My favorite pipe is my Brebbia Iceberg (Italian). 
It's also very large, and was relatively inexpensive. As far as tobaccos 
go, I liked a blend called Wilshire for a long time, but then discovered 
a blend called Champaign, which I still like very much. Recently, though, 
I have discovered a blend called Black Cordial, which is the best tasting 
and smelling tobacco I have experienced to far. 

Pipes for me are a hobby, and not a habit. I rarely smoke more than three
bowls per week, and many times there are weeks (and occasionally months)
between smokes. My favorite time to smoke is when I am driving home from
college (St. Louis to St. Paul). Not like there is anything ELSE to do
during that ten hours, but It's still a very peaceful time for me. I drive
a VW fox, which means I have a HUGE quartz clock on the dashboard staring
me in the face for the entire voyage. This enable me to see how long I can
make a pipe full last. I haven't been at this seriously for that long, so
my record is only One hour and thirty five minutes. 

I view pipe smoking and cigarette smoking as two entirely different
things, with far more differences than similarities. For example, as a
pipe smoker, (like most all others I know) I am very respectful of what it
is that others appreciate as far as olfactory stimulation goes. I am proud
of my heightened awareness of other's reactions to my pipe. If someone
doesn't like it, or finds it offensive (which is very rare) I will simply
take it from my mouth until they are no longer around. As a one who finds 
cigarette smoke strongly objectionable, I can only dream of the day when 
cigarette smokers can mirror that type of respect. It was a surprise for 
me to discover the different "snappy comebacks" and such in response to 
unfavorable comments about pipes. I prefer a peaceful, gentle approach, 
which to me is what pipe smoking is all about. 

Well, enough for now. I wish all of the readers of the Digest a peaceful 
and restful holiday season-

From: Rick Berger &lt;?????@???.???&gt;
<a name="29">Subject: Pipe Digest</a>

Hi -

My name is Rick Berger and I'm new to the newsletter, somewhat new to
pipes/cigars (been into it for about a year).  Appreciate the information
I'm getting from this newsletter and especially the encouragement to
"educate" the prohibitionist prudes.  Yeesh, you'd think people would
have learned to leave each other alone by now ...

Anyway, first some general preferences just so you know where I'm
coming from:

   - Thus far, I've settled on the 'Bulldog' type of pipe, because
     it maintains a large mass of wood around the bowl, but is still
     carryable.  Seems to me, more wood acts like a heat sink and
     makes for a cooler smoke than the lighter pipes.  Also, a
     1/4 bend seems to reduce gurgling a bit.  A big, flat mouthpiece
     is very comfy.

   - Practically any of the blends with virginia or burley have too
     much bite for my palate.  I finally settled on Captain Black White
     Label as the best drugstore blend.

   - TinderBox has straight black cavendish that they market under
     the name "Midnight".  It's pretty great, but blending in a little
     latakia moderates the sweetness somewhat, gives it more body, and
     absorbs a *lot* of the moisture.

   - On tobaccos - a conclusion I'm coming to is I need to sample all
     the non-blended forms first - the "primary colors" if you will -
     to determine the base character of each.  That way, I can tell
     what I'm getting in the blends.  Otherwise, it's just a
     confusing hodge-podge.  I noticed that this was rather difficult
     with latakia.  All it did was swell up on heating and block the
     draw completely.  This too is informative ...

On to other things -

I just completed a couple of weeks in Europe, going from Venice to
Paris via Southern France.  Here are some "pipe/tobacco" observations
of that region from an American perspective:

   - The most ubiquitous drugstore brand available is Amphora.  It's
     absolutely *everywhere*.  In France, the next most available seems
     to be Gaullois (sp? - comes in a blue packet).  Didn't try it.

   - Although warnings to the contrary from my non-smoking friends,
     smoking in Europe doesn't seem to be as prevalent as it may have
     been in the past.  Trains have an even number of smoking and
     and non-smoking cars; there are a *lot* more no-smoking signs
     than you would think.  I *could* puff in more places than in the
     US - notably restaurants - but there were non-smoking sections in
     many (which is fine).  I almost got kicked out of a street market
     boulangerie for walking in with lighted pipe (not so fine).  I
     covered over the bowl, made a quick purchase and a quicker exit.

     Be aware.  I basically just looked around when I was in a store
     or public transport.  If people weren't smoking, I didn't either.

   - Picked up an interesting pipe in Venice, made out of olive-wood.
     Don't know if anyone has ever tried this, but it's different.
     It's not broken in yet, but thus far it imparts a distinct
     olive-ish taste at the end of the bowl.  Doesn't work with the
     sweetish black tobaccos I tend to lean towards, but might be
     interesting with other blends.

   - Pipes are available in many stores in Paris, and at reasonable
     prices.  The most outrageous store I found is a place called
     "Le Pipes De Cogolin".  They have three stores, one in Paris,
     one in Saint-Tropez and one in Cogolin, next to the fabricant
     (they feature pipes made by Courrieu).  Here are the
     addresses/phone nos:

	   Le Pipes De Cogolin 		

	   PARIS:			ST-TROPEZ:
           129 Rue St. Honore		25, Quai Gabriel Peri
           75001 Paris, France		83990 Saint-Tropez, France
           94.54.63.82			94.97.00.91

	   COGOLIN:
	   42 et 58, av. Clemencau
	   83310 Cogolin, France
	   94.54.63.82

     In Paris, the store is on Rue St. Honore, just off Rue De Louvre
     and one block north of Rue Rivoli (Rivoli borders the Louvre).

     It's awesome.  More pipes than I've ever seen in one place - big
     ones, little ones, long ones, short ones, meerschaums, meerschaum
     inserts, full bend, no bend, and on and on.  I was gazing at all
     the pipes on the racks and on all the walls, and then the sales
     lady came over and opened a longish drawer *below* the racks. 
     I almost fell over - drawers and drawers full of pipes, sorted
     by style and price.  The selection was truly overwhelming.

     The sales person (didn't get her name) was extremely helpful, and
     was very interested in helping me get the style I was looking for
     and in my price range.  That was one of the very nice things -
     if I liked a particular style, but it was too expensive,
     she worked very hard to find a similar style in a less expensive
     pipe.  I wound up picking up a big solid bulldog that is just
     supremely comfortable in my hand (first over $100 pipe I've owned).
     Also picked up a novelty piece: a suede wrapped canadian. This
     was around $35 (haven't looked at the conversion rate, yet).

     Interestingly enough, they do not sell tobacco.  Apparently the
     state requires them to sell a bunch of other sundry items if
     they're going to sell tobacco so, rather than get into all that,
     they just stick with the pipes.

     (A side question:  All of the european pipes seem to be sold with
     metal inserts projecting from the mouthpiece into the stem.
     These are various geometries and have varying slots in them to
     allow the smoke to come through.  Does anyone know what these are
     called and what is their purpose?  For my part, I think they cause
     the pipe to gurgle more quickly and mess up the draw.  I wind up
     taking them out.  Just curious.)

   - Nowhere could I find the equivalent of a good tobacco store in
     Paris.  There are plenty of places advertising "Tabac" - practically
     on every street corner - but they are limited to mostly cigarettes
     and packaged, "drug-store" pipe tobaccos (Amphora always available).
     The full service tobacco store with jars of interesting smelling
     stuff was nowhere to be found.  Maybe knowleable Gauls head for
     London for their pipe stuffings, or do mail order.

   - On the cigar side, there are a few humidors around with reasonable
     if not huge selections, almost all Cuban.  I tried a Cohiba corona
     size, but had quite a reaction to it.  Interestingly enough, it
     was fine until I stopped.  Then I got *extremely* sick.  Oh, well,
     back to Dominicans &amp; pipes for me :).

Hope readers of the newsletter find this interesting.  I'm not a
tremendously knowleable epicurean on pipes and tobaccos, but am always
interested in learning more and sharing observations.  Next project is to
try some of the Cornell and Diehl tobaccos and see what they're all about.

later,

        "One way to explain what graduate students undergo
in order to become professors is to say that no doctoral
candidate should be allowed to graduate until he has the
lenses in his glasses changed to a stronger prescription at
least three times, he grows a coffee-cup extension on one
hand, and his other hand becomes a cigarette holder.  There
is some truth to this statement inasmuch as graduate school
is hard on the eyes and the nerves.  But in order for such
changes to be good training for a professorship, the final
part of the expression should be changed from cigarette to
pipe.  A pipe can be a professor's good friend, for it is
one of the world's best defense mechanisms.
        "When a professor is asked a question that he cannot
answer or one that requires him to take a stand, he needs
time to think.  A pipe provides this.  You can always pause
to light it, for a pipe is constantly going out.  Or, if you
need more time, you can pour out the dottle, reload it, and
then light it.  And in extreme cases, you can do all that
and clean the pipe.  Perhaps it is this quality of the pipe
-- it's usefulness in gaining time to think -- that causes
so many professors to adopt them."

        About myself, I'm a 22 year old first year law student at the
University of Miami. I have been smoking cigarettes for a while, mostly
Drum. Tried to figure out how to smoke pipes when I was 18 and failed.
Recently I took a ten month hiatus from smoking until the stress of law
school got to me. Started to smoke pipes again a few weeks ago because
of all the odd stares I was getting for hand-rolling my own cigarettes.
This time I read *Weber's Guide to Pipes &amp; Pipe Smoking* by Carl Weber
and *The Gentle Art of Smoking* by Alfred Dunhill to figure how to care
for a pipe and keep it lit. Which leads to a few questions (I apologize
if I am asking FAQs.):
1. Should I tamp and relight every so often even if my pipe hasn't gone
   out? And, does the tobacco become bitter/bad when re-lit?
2. Should I take apart the pipe to clean it every time or just run a
   pipe cleaner done the stem after I'm finished?
3. After how many bowls will I build up a cake? And, how many until
   I need to trim the cake? I've been told I shouldn't worry about it.
4. How much should a meerschuam with a tracery pattern or head carving
   (2.5"Hx2"W) cost and what should I look for? Any mail order sources?
5. Anyone know of any pipe shows coming up in Miami?
6. Other than A&amp;M Gazette and The Pipe Smoker's Ephemeris should I 
   subcribe to or join anything else?
        I will try to review some of the local tobacconists in South
Florida. Also, if any PDers are at the University of Miami, as the
saying goes, "I'll smoke a pipe with you with pleasure."
        If I don't post sooner, happy holidays to all!

                Copyright 1995 by Andrew Donovan-Shead

In the year 1980 I returned to civilian life, after serving ten years
in the ranks of the Royal Air Force. At the time I was living in
barracks at RAF Uxbridge and thought of T.E.  Lawrence whom the RAF
stationed there too.  However, that is another story entirely.
Uxbridge was for me a halfway house between The Mob and my civilian
employment at the British Airways Training Centre, Cranebank. It was in
July of that year that I started work there, assigned to the
maintenance of the Boeing-737, the latest addition to the fleet of
flight simulators. Boasting a motion system with six-degrees of freedom
and a powerful VAX-11/780 computer made by Digital Equipment, the
American computer company, it was sophisticated equipment for the time.
Rather than indulge myself in a long harangue on the technical
intricacies of the full-flight simulator, let me "cut to the chase" as
they say in the moving picture trade: flight simulators give a good
representation of a flying aircraft.

By August, I was well settled in my new work, rubbing along with my
supervisor, Peter, and the other members of the team. We were working
the graveyard shift. Early one morning, around one o'clock, we had
finished our routine maintenance on the simulator and I was working on
some software in the computer room. As I worked, I heard some relays
energise, heard some activity from the disk-storage units, and, in the
distance, heard the whine of the hydraulic pumps starting. No, this is
usual. I assumed that Peter was taking the simulator for a test-flight.
Let into the door of the computer room was a panel of glass, yet I had
seen none go by down the corridor, however, I was working and could
have missed Peter on his way to the simulator. While I continued with
my work, I could hear the vigorous swish, swishing from the hydraulic
jacks that told me Peter was putting the machine through an extensive
set of evolutions. Some thirty minutes later, I heard clicking from
relays as they deenergised in the main interface and a sharp drop in
disc activity, which told me Peter had landed, repositioning the
machine at the end of our simulated runway at Heathrow.

Leaving the computer room, I walked down the corridor and out onto the
mezzanine of the high-bay, in time to see the simulator settle on its
jacks, with a huge sigh from the depleting pressure in the hydraulic
system. Once the simulator was at rest, the access ramp lowered itself
automatically, like a drawbridge, allowing me to walk across the gulf
to the mechanical island that was the simulator. On sliding open the
door, to my surprise I found the cockpit empty. Inside, I looked all
around -- nothing. Disconcerted, I went downstairs to the crew-room and
found Peter drinking tea while working on some papers.

"Peter, I heard the simulator start-up, run for thirty minutes, and
then shutdown. I thought you were flying, but when I went on board it
was empty. What's going on?"

"It's an intermittent fault we can't find," said Peter. "We used to
push the emergency-stop buttons, but we found the machine suffered no
damage. When it happens, we let it go unless we are standing within
reach of an emergency-stop."

"Haven't you tried to find out what is wrong?"

"Yes, Andy, we have, but like I said, it is intermittent, it's been
months since we last had a problem. Anyway, since it's started
acting-up again, why don't you look into it. You're new here and it
will give you an opportunity to learn more about the machine."

                                 ###

A few weeks later, I had an opportunity to look into this little
problem, about the 10th of September I think it was, by that time I
know I had left Uxbridge and moved to my cottage in Emsworth, on the
South Coast. Despite the long drive each day to work, a total of three
hours of commuting, I felt much easier living in my own abode. I had
settled down to the routine of working a rotating shift system. Again,
our team was on the graveyard shift, and again I was in the computer
room when I heard the simulator start, I was working on a programme to
make visual databases easier to construct. When I heard the activity of
the machine, I called the crew-room by telephone. Peter answered and
said that no one should be in the simulator. Taking this as my cue, I
began my investigation of this strange phenomenon.  I tried to log-in
to the computer from the master console, but found myself locked out.
Next, I went out onto the mezzanine and watched the evolutions of the
motion system, much more extravagant than what you see from a pilot
practicing ordinary Line Oriented Flight Training, the motion bucked
and twisted like an unbroken horse at a rodeo contest. Strange too was
the environmental sound system that had become incoherent, for instead
of the whine of turbines I could hear a staccato rattle that increased
and decreased in frequency with the movement of the motion system, or
like the sound of an overexcited bee. Not able to see what was
happening, I pushed the emergency-stop button. Once the drawbridge had
lowered, I walked across to the darkened simulator.

Inside the simulator, I found nothing, although the atmosphere was much
colder than I should have expected, and angry electrical static charged
the air, prickling the hairs on the nape of my neck, in me causing an
involuntary shudder. It was as though someone had stepped on my grave
and I shivered again and swallowed. I walked back to the computer room
in haste, with that uneasy feeling between the shoulder blades that
attends an unprotected back. Having gained the brightly illuminated
safety of the computer room, I tried again to log-in at the master
console, this time with success. Checking the error logs, I could find
nothing wrong.

During the next three days nothing happened, everything in the
simulator worked as normal, we had no unattended operation of the
machine. On the night of the 14th of September, I was standing on the
floor of the high-bay, next to the hydraulic control cabinet, wondering
why we had no further activity. When I noticed the gate onto the
drawbridge standing, open, as it had on the previous three nights, I
understood why we had not seen any activity. With the gate open the
safety interlocks would be incomplete and nothing would work. By now it
was too late to do anything further as our shift was at an end.

We were at work again on the 15th September, this time I made sure that
the gate was closed. I waited in the computer room. When I heard the
relays click, I looked at my watch and noted the time standing at one
o'clock. Walking down, and out onto the floor of the high-bay, I
watched the wild gyrations of the motion platform, and listened to the
maniac sound of the runaway sound system. Soon, the motion-system gave
a violent jerk and pitched forward, nose-down and the sound system
emitted harsh noise of increasing pitch, then silence, then the
depletion valves opened on the hydraulic pack. The motion platform
settled back on an even keel. The drawbridge lowered itself and I ran
up the stairs onto the mezzanine and across the bridge to the
simulator.

Pulling open the door, I recoiled at the smoke -- simulated smoke. Once
it had started to clear, I stepped inside and could smell something
other underlying the smell of hot glycol.  It was a smell out of place
that I am sure I would have identified in other circumstances. Once the
smoke had cleared, I found everything normal. I logged into the
computer from the onboard maintenance terminal and checked the error
logs, this time I found a crash condition caused by excessive G-forces
on the airframe.  Nevertheless, I was puzzled still, but we had no more
incidents. Strange activity of the simulator stopped on the 15th of
September. Some months later I came to a partial understanding that
completely unnerved me.

                                 ###

In June or July of the following year, I was visiting my brother at
Mareham-le-Fen. As chance would have it, they invited me to attend the
village fete on the Saturday afternoon.  Its official opening was at
noon on the village football pitch. We had locked the house and were
walking down the lane when I heard the rising note of a powerful engine
approaching.  Suddenly, that familiar staccato rattle was overhead and
gone, the lone aircraft disappeared behind the trees. My heart raced
and my face must have betrayed my emotion because they asked me if I
were feeling well.

"Yes. Yes," I replied and stood still.

Before long that aircraft returned at a very low altitude, the pilot
executing a slow roll as he passed over the fete, then climbed away.
Silhouetted against the flat grey of the high overcasting clouds, I had
a perfect view of the elegant, elliptical plan-form of the wings.
Within a minute or two, the pilot finished his exhibition, climbing to
pattern-altitude, in readiness for landing back at RAF Coningsby, home
to the Battle-of-Britain Flight. Now I understood the cause of the
problems with our simulator, but I could not admit this kind of
knowledge to anyone, not in this prosaic age. I kept quiet and walked
on to the fete, to the beer tent where I stood outside with a pint of
Bateman's Best Bitter in my hand, listening to the excellencies of the
Mareham-le-Fen Silver Band, and contemplating how I should handle this
problem in the coming months, because I was sure now that the simulator
would begin to act as before towards the end of August.

                                 ###

My work-shift arrangements did not coincide with the graveyard watch
for the entire month of August 1981, for the first week of September I
was too sick with influenza to be working. Luckily, my work schedule
showed me assigned to graveyards during those critical few days leading
up to the 15th of September. Having arranged to keep the safety-gate
open, on the drawbridge to the simulator, during the early hours of
Saturday the 12th and Sunday, 13 September, I prepared myself for the
early morning of Monday, 14 September. Let me say that I am no brave
heart, I was on tenterhooks and nearly talked myself out of this
curious adventure.

At half past the hour of midnight on the Monday morning, I walked
across the drawbridge to the simulator, closing the gate behind me.
Inside, I slid the cockpit door shut. I repositioned the simulation to
the beginning of runway two-seven-left at Heathrow, sat in the
co-pilot's seat on the right-hand side of the cockpit, and waited for
what I felt sure would arrive in force, having thwarted it with my
careful attention during the previous few days.

Since my visit to Mareham-le-Fen, I had looked into the events of 1940
and the Battle-of-Britain. Air Marshal Dowding conducted air operations
from RAF Bentley Priory, against the Luftwaffe under the command of
Reichs Marshal Go	ring. Dowding had about six-hundred aircraft at his
disposal, with aircrews inexperienced in aerial combat, unlike the
opposing forces of the Luftwaffe who had ample opportunity to gain
valuable training over Spain. Dowding's plan was to husband his forces,
to live to fight another day. He had issued standing orders for the
defenders to engage the bomber fleets of the Luftwaffe only, to leave
the fighter escorts well alone. Messerschmitt's BF109 fighters were
well-flown, but lack of fuel limited their engagement time over
England. Usually, the Spitfire could outmanoeuvre the BF109, but it did
not perform well at high altitudes and was subject to engine stoppage
when pulling negative G-force, which inhibited operation of the engine
carburettors.  Pressurized fuel injection kept the BF109 engine running
at all attitudes.

"All sections scramble! Seventy-plus bandits approaching, angels
one-five."

The cockpit of the simulator went dark, starting me from my reverie.
Suddenly, the atmosphere became very cold, accompanied by a dramatic
buildup in electrical static. I reached to grasp the control column, to
adjust myself in my seat, and received a startling static discharge
that produced a pink spark between the control-wheel and my hand, which
I withdrew in haste. On came the power to the cockpit and I felt the
motion-base rise from its settled position. Seized by an urge, I got
out of the co-pilot's seat and sat in the Captain's seat, on the port
side of the cockpit. After strapping myself in, I moved the seat
forward and looked out at the visual system. To my utter amazement we
were at Heathrow no longer. It was daylight and I was looking across
open grass from what looked like a dispersal point of a military
airfield. Odd too was the motion system of the simulator sitting lower
aft than forward, and the environmental sound system produced the sound
of a propeller driven by a reciprocating engine. And instead of the
Horizontal and Vertical Situation Indicators glowing in colour on the
multifunction displays, I saw a black and white reproduction of a
blind-flying panel, standard in aircraft of the late 1930s. Looking
across to my right, I saw that the buildup of electrical energy in the
co-pilot's seat, on the starboard side, had coalesced into the
unworldly blue aura of St. Elmo's Fire, it shimmered, fizzed, and
crackled around the seat, the control wheel, the throttle levers, and
the rudder pedals.

The throttles moved forward from idle and the brakes released. We
started to roll forward onto a concrete taxiway. Looking out forward, I
saw us turning left and right, snaking our way to the point where we
would begin our takeoff roll. At each jink to the right, I had a
glimpse of the way ahead. Very soon, we turned into wind and the
throttles moved all the way forward and the control column moved all
the way back. I heard the engine note rise to a full-throated roar.
Looking out of the cockpit to my left, I saw us moving rapidly past gun
emplacements, saw uniformed men working. We moved past aircraft hangers
of another age.  As we gained speed, the control column moved forward
enough to raise our tail off the ground, and I could see forward more
clearly. Within moments, the ground fell away, we were airborne. I felt
the thump of the undercarriage retract into the wings. We turned
Southeast, climbing the while as hard as we could, to gain the
advantage of height and the sun. I switched the cockpit loudspeakers to
the radio telephone channel and heard a woman's voice giving directions
to engagement with the enemy in calm, measured tones. I felt a shudder
run through the airframe and heard the sound of our eight machine-guns
firing, another short burst to test their mettle.

Looking down and to the left, I saw London spread out, but not the
London I know for there was no Post Office Tower and other high-rise
buildings. Palls of smoke were rising from the dockland area of the
East End. Barrage balloons floated serenely above the destruction on
the ground. We flew over Kent. As we crossed the coastline, I saw one
set of towers that comprised part of the Chain Home radar system, the
system that was giving us flying directions via the plotting room back
on the ground. Now we were out over the channel and below, far ahead, I
could see the enemy bomber fleet advancing to its target. We had gained
the advantage of height with the sun behind us, the aerial equivalent
of Nelson getting the weather-gauge of the enemy fleet.

"Tally Ho!"

Rolling into a dive onto the formation below, we dived through the
protective umbrella of fighters, onto the bombers. We chose a leader.
Our speed had increased to a dangerous level. I heard our engine
throttled back and watched us draw closer and closer, until I could see
the occupants of the bomber's cockpit. I felt and heard our
machine-guns fire and saw the enemy's canopy shatter, bits of Plexiglas
blew away in the slipstream. In the few seconds we had the bomber in
sight, we raked it from stem to stern. From then on the motion of the
cockpit was violent as we pulled up and joined the melee of fighting
aircraft, a dogfight of the most vicious kind.

Out of ammunition, we broke off the attack and returned the way we had
come, back to the airfield where we described a gentle curve into the
wind and executed a perfect three-point landing, taxing back to our
dispersal. We stopped. Dark went the cockpit. It grew warmer and the
power returned. When I looked in the direction of the co-pilot, the St.
Elmo's Fire was gone. Multifunction displays had returned to their
colourful graphics. Looking out, I saw we were sitting back at Heathrow
and the visual system had returned to its dusk-night display. In spite
of the warmth, I shivered and walked out of the machine onto the
drawbridge. I was drenched in a sweat. It was as though I had been
transported in time to the past of 1940. The clock on the wall said I
had been gone thirty minutes; it seemed a lot longer. Somewhat dazed
from my unusual experience, I went home about eight o'clock on the
Monday morning.

                                 ###

Early morning shift-work has never agreed with my constitution. When I
got home, I went to bed and was up and about again at one o'clock in
the afternoon, grilling some pork chops for my dinner. While waiting
for them to cook, I stepped into the garden of my house and fell to
wondering what I should do with the simulator early morning Tuesday, 15
September. Standing there, just outside the kitchen door, I remembered
again the strange smell I noted when last I found the simulator full of
smoke. An odd thing because it was quite palpable and getting stronger
by the moment. I turned into the kitchen and quickly grabbed the
grilling pan and carried my flaming chops out into the garden, my pork
burnt to inedible blackness. Well, I have heard of humans described by
cannibal tribesman as Long Pig, and understood what had happened on the
15th of September 1940, the temporal remains of that unquiet soul of a
pilot had crashed and burned in his Spitfire. What was I to do to lay
this poor fellow to rest?

What, too, was I to do about my lunch? Putting on my coat, I left my
house, locked the door behind me and walked across the fields to
Emsworth, down Queen Street, across the Square to the Coal Exchange
public house. Calling for a pint of Gale's HSB, I spoke for a hot pasty
with chips and peas, sat considering the facts as I saw them, but first
I gazed into the amber beer, mentally saluting the pilot, a pilot who,
having gone for a burton, got short measure and stuck between two
worlds. Much better than Burton's, the HSB slipped down to whet my
appetite already sharp from the brisk walk.

Something must have happened during the battle of the 15th to cause
this soul so much unrest. Also, I noted that the simulator had crashed
because of excessive G-forces acting on the airframe. Of course, an
aircraft out of control and falling from the sky would soon experience
such forces. Pilots had to bail-out directly before the uncontrolled
G-force became intolerable, making parachuting to safety difficult or
impossible. Elevated by a third pint of Gale's Horndean Special Bitter,
I wended my way home to sleep in readiness for my adventure.

                                 ###

Monday evening: I remember little of my drive up the A3 to London,
Heathrow and the Cranebank Training Centre. Early tomorrow morning
would be the anniversary of the Battle-of-Britain, the anniversary of
the demise of my pilot, the manifestation of whom would take over the
simulator in a desperate attempt to adjust its eternal fate. It would
not succeed, that spirit, not unless I gave it some help.

At half past midnight, I seated myself in the Boeing-737 simulator,
with the gate onto the drawbridge closed, but this time I seated myself
at the instructor's operating console, with my seat belt fastened
securely because I was sure I was in for a rough ride. After
repositioning the simulator to the approach end of runway
two-seven-left, and displaying the area map on the instructor's control
and display unit, I sat and waited, not without some trepidation.

As usual, a sharp drop in the temperature of the cockpit alerted me.
Again the prickle of static electricity caused an involuntary shudder
in me. All power to the cockpit was removed, to return some moments
later. I saw the motion system warning-light start to flash and felt
the motion-base rise and settle into that tail-down attitude. At the
co-pilot's station, I saw St. Elmo's Fire flicker an ethereal blue
around the seat, control column, throttle quadrant, and rudder pedals.
We received instructions from the plotting room at Bentley Priory.
Glancing at the area map on the instructor's console, I saw that we
were repositioned to an airfield a little to the South of London.
Looking out at the visual, I saw us taxi from our dispersal, taking-off
in haste.

We were late, no doubt because a link in the Chain Home radar was off
the air. This time we did not have the advantage of height or the sun.
We engaged the enemy closely, so close, less than the two hundred and
fifty yards at which our guns were harmonized, much less than the
official harmonization of six-hundred and fifty yards. We brought down
two of the attacking bombers before we ourselves were attacked by an
escorting fighter. I glimpsed the BF109 as we plunged, and soared,
twisted, and turned trying to gain the upper hand.

By making a near vertical dive for the ground, the Luftwaffe pilot
broke off the attack.  I sensed he was now short of fuel or out of
ammunition. Instead of turning again to the bombers, we dived in
pursuit. I felt my pulse race as we approached our crisis. Quickly, I
scanned the instructor's console and rapidly pressed the
"Crash-Inhibit" button, followed by the "Fuel-Freeze" button to
override the stress section of the flight dynamics programme and the
computer calculated consumption of fuel. Not a moment too soon. Our
quarry ahead executed the beginning of a deft Immelmann Turn and was on
our tail in an instant. I felt the impact of twenty millimetre cannon
shells on our airframe. My pilot was knocked unconscious for I saw the
controls go slack. We spun down through what remaining height we had
left and the cockpit started to fill with smoke. Immediately, I donned
the instructor's smoke mask, and just saw the green fields of England
in a whirling blur before the smoke in the cockpit obscured them. My
pilot recovered his senses. I heard the scream of the engine abate with
the throttles snapped back to idle. With a loud crackle of static, the
smoke parted, and I saw the control column and rudder pedals moving to
counteract the direction of spin.  Around the control column the blue
electrical charge glowed bright and the column moved aft. We pulled out
of our dive with not more than fifty feet to spare. As we did so, the
throttle moved forward and the engine picked up in its revolutions. We
climbed to one hundred feet above ground level before the engine
stopped dead, seized from overheating caused by the loss of its glycol
coolant. We made a wheels-up dead-stick landing; we pancaked in a
ploughed field.

In the sudden silence, I took a deep breath and relaxed the crushing
grip I had taken on the arms of my seat. Fans extracted the glycol
fumes from the cockpit. The St. Elmo's Fire detached itself from the
co-pilot's controls and coalesced into a plasma the size of a soccer
ball and moved across the cockpit to hang just in front of my face. I
was too numb to flinch away and sat there looking into its blue
luminescence, for some moments. I felt examined, noticed the ball
diminishing, smaller and smaller. Soon it was the size of a pea and
with a pop it was gone. My forearms tingled. My stomach was wound
tight. Waves of hot and cold swept over me. I had hyperventilated. Out
of the simulator, I rushed to the bathroom where I vomited copiously.

Back in the crew-room, I told Peter that I had to go home as I was
feeling ill.

"You look as though you have seen a ghost, Andy. Well, we'll see you
tomorrow if you are feeling any better."

<a name="33">Subject:  Obtaining Condor from England</a>

   Greetings to this Glorious Pipe Band!!

   In answer to some questions concerning the acquisition of
   Condor Flake (since it is no longer imported)
   the following might help.

   There are several Tobacco Shops in London, England which
   are allowed to EXPORT English Tobacco Products to
   individuals in the USA  
   (also known as "Her Majesty's Colonies in the Americas)  8=))

   The best way to order is BY Phone, with a Credit Card.
   These shops all accept American Express, Visa, Master Card.
   Your credit card company will xlate Pounds Sterling to 
   US $ on your statement.
   
   Also, you will NOT have to pay the Heavy VAT and Tobacco
   tax imposed on smokers in Great Britain.

   The only restriction I have experienced is that some
   shops may only sell in 1 Kg. lots.
   That would mean 20 50g tins or packets combined
   of various pipe tobaccos.
   But, what the heck, if it is something you like,
   get 20 tins. !! :-)

   Now follows the shops with which I have delt:

     1).  G. Smiths &amp; Sons
          74 Charing Cross Road
          London, WC2
          Tel:  0171-836-7422

     2).  James J Fox &amp; Robert Lewis
          19 St. James Street
          London, SW1
          Tel:  0171-493-9009

     3).  Harrods Dept. Store :
          run by James J. Fox
          Knightsbridge; London, SW1
          Tel: 0171-730-1234 Extension 3359

    Now, from these stores, you will be able to obtain
    Condor, Ogdens St. Julien, Ogdens Walnut Flake,
    Players Navy Flake (VERY GOOD!),
    Germain's Plum Cake, Digger Flake, Ogden's Best brown Flake,
    Murry's Mild Mixture (very good!), Murry's Yachtsman,
    and MANY, MANY, More English Mixtures!!!!   8=))))

     A 4th shop, Dunhills, is listed below. You will be suprised to
     discover that some of their OLD mixtures are still available,
     but ONLY from Dunhills in London!
  
     They will also ship directly to individuals in the USA.

     4).  Alfred Dunhill Ltd
          30 Duke Street, St James's
          London, SW1
          Tel: 0171-499-9566

     They will, if you give them your FAX #,
     send you a list of what is available.

     I have been able to obtain the following mixtures:
     
       Aperitife, Mr. Alfred's Own, Durbar, #27, 3 Year Matured,
       #72 ( contains &gt; 52% Latakia!), #10, Duke St. Mix, 
       etc. etc. etc.: These are all in Vacuum Sealed Tins.

          Note: I have no commercial affiliation with any shops
                in London.  I am an applied Mathematician and
                Computer Programmer.

          Happy holidays to all,  Happy Smoking!!!!!

Dear Steve
I m passing on a idea sort of from Pete Siegel. A lot of times people
answer posts with reasonably technical replies that I think are worthyof
being saved. Such as the thread on buffing wheel ste ups. Its not something
that needs to be in the FaQ but it something that seems to come up alot.
Would it be possible to organize and archive some of these subjects?

As presently I have no acess to a web server could this be done in
conjunction with P.D.? My brother is working in becoming a web site sever
it will probably be a few months. I hope to do a web page then and maybe
could get some space at tthat time . Let me know what you think of the
idea.
&gt;From Pete:

My e-mail address is:    ?????@?????.???.???

 ...and I have made contact with Mark.

There have been some questions about the quality of Alpha and Dr.
Grabow pipes.  I did a post about a week ago in which I discussed the
quality of briar which goes into pipes.  If anyone has a copy of that
post, you might want to re-post it for these folks.  If I get the chance
later I might do a chart corresponding to hat I mentioned in that post.

[ Yr. Moderator has been (and will likely continue to be) a bit lax in
the preparation of the FAQ.  I could suggest the search engine on the
Web page, in lieu of this.  If you'd like to do some organization,
please feel free, and I'll ask Steve Beaty to put in a hot link. -S. ]

My final request is that you would ask other Pipes Digest members to e-mail
me at ??????????@???.??? to let me know the specifics of their pipe clubs,
pipe shows and pipe dinners.
When responding, please tell me: a) the name of the club; b) if it's
affilitated with a tobacco shop; c) the city the club serves; d) how long the
club has been around, the number of members and, e) a contact person and how
I can get more information about the group via e-mail, snail mail and phone.
     I would like to compile something of a list for my magazines and,
unfortunately, haven't been able to determine  some of this data from the
resource guide. And if you have had experience with a pipe dinner, I would
like to hear from you as well.

     For those who would like more information about the new consumer
magazine and its subscription rates, just e-mail me. I don't want my first
posting to sound too much like a commercial. After all, with all this
jabbering, my pipe may go out!

<a name="40">Subject: PD - Clean Air?</a>

Here in Minnesota we are in the middle of winter (yes, I realize we
have not even had the Winter Solstice yet, but when the wind-chill
factor is -50F, you KNOW it's Winter!). This time of year is not
conducive to sitting outside for a smoke. I would like to smoke
inside, but the stale smoke smell inside the house is unacceptable to
both me and my wife. I have an electronic air filter on my furnace
already, and it still takes a couple of days to clear the smell.

What techniques have fellow Digest readers used to solve the stale
smoke issue?

I have seen _smokers candles_ in some of the smoke shops and they have a small 
green core of some material that must burn with the candle to either mask or 
eliminate the odors.  How do they work?

Has anyone added a special air filtration system to a room or exhaust fans?

On another note, My favorite smokes are the A. Fuente Chateau or
Double Chateau with the maduro wrapper.  Very nice flavor.  Much more
flavorful (but not real strong) than the natural wrapper cigars I have
had lately, such as the Davidoffs.  Another cigar with a hint of
spiciness that I was given for my birthday was a Cubita.  I have
looked around the Twin Cities for a few months and finally found a
smaller ring sized one at Surdyks Liquors.  Still good, but I like the
complex flavors the larger ring size allows.

Last weekend we went to a restaurant called Ciatti's in Eden Prairie
MN and they let us smoke cigars at the bar.  (the bartender was a
cigar smoker also!) Great time!  I don't know it they allow cigar
smoking all the time, or if it was because it was so damn cold that
nobody was out that night! I will try it again soon and report back.
Any other readers know of places in the Twin Cities &amp; suburbs which
support our relaxing pastime? Please tell!

[ Gee! I thought you knew _every_ pipe smoker around there! :-) -S. ]

Steve,

   I found this while I was reading, and I thought it would be appropriate for 
the digest.  It's a quote from _The_Devil's_Dictionary_ by Ambrose Bierce
(the version I have has no copyright date in it - so I figured that reprinting 
it would be ok)

MEERSCHAUM, noun: (Literally, seafoam, and by many erroneously
supposed to be made of it.)  A fine white clay, which for
convenience in colouring it brown is made into tobacco pipes and
smoked by the workmen engaged in that industry.  The purpose of
colouring it has not been disclosed by the manufacturers.

     There was a youth (you've heard before,
       This woful tale, may be),
     Who bought a meerschaum pipe and swore
       That colour it would be!

     He shut himself from the world away,
       Nor any soul he saw.
     He smoked by night, he smoked by day,
       As hard as ne could draw.

     His dog died moaning in the wrath
       Of winds that blew aloof;
     The weeds were in the gravel path,
       The owl was on the roof.

     "He's gone afar, he'll come no more,"
       The neighbors sadly say.
     And so they batter in the door
       To take his goods away.

     Dead, pipe in mouth, the youngster lay,
       Nut-brown in face and limb.
     "That pipe's a lovely white," they say,
       "But it has coloured him!"

     The moral there's small need to sing--
       'Tis plain as day to you;
     Don't play your game on any thing
       That is a gamester too.

                   Martin Bulstrode

in the Commercial section.  Would greatly appreciate it if you could 
change this to :

    <a href="http://www.intbc.com/smokin">http://www.intbc.com/smokin</a>

which is Smokin' Joes true Home Page.  The site you have listed is just

Any idea how I can direct-order Aldo Velani Pipes?  I like the pipes, but 
find the retail price somewhat discouraging.
