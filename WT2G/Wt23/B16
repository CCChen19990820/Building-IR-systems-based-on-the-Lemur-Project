<h2 align=center>May 1996 ECTC Status Report</h2>
<CENTER><EM><a href="http://www.asi.org/severy">Randall Severy</a>,
Chairman, Artemis ECTC<BR></CENTER>
<CENTER><a href="mailto:severy@asi.org">severy@asi.org</a></EM></CENTER>
<p>
    The <a href="/adb/09/01/ectc.html">Electronic Communications Technical
Committee</a> had another
productive, though not spectacular, month in May.  The move of the asi.org
domain to a new ISP continued to creep along at a snail's pace, but the
word at the end of the month was that significant progress had been made so
we hope to have some good news in this area in the near future.  Some major
progress has been acheived in the task of overhauling the ASI web server
home page, which will be detailed in the Web server status report below.
<p>
    The ECTC added several new members this past month, which should help
us make even more progress in several key areas.  Tom Chavez joined the
team and will be helping with the web server updates.  Miche Thompson
signed on to help out with some of the documents and guides the ECTC is
currently working on.  And Tim Cadell and Richard Fyfe brought the ECTC
membership to a grand total of 36 people!  This month, however, we also bid
goodbye to Mark Barbisan, who has left the ECTC to focus all of his
attentions on the busy Advanced Planning Technical Committee.  You can find
the complete ECTC membership listing on the ECTC web page at
<a href="/adb/09/01/ectc.html">http://www.asi.org/adb/09/01/ectc.html</a>.
<p>
    The ECTC task list grew this month with several new tasks.  Two
additional tasks were added to the Help Desk section to respond to entries
in the web site guestbook and newsgroup postings.  A web server task was
added to develop an automated Web Page Maintenance System to help reduce
the growing manual efforts needed to maintain the ASI web site.  And last,
but not least, Doug Cross has volunteered to lead up an effort to establish
a database of historical and statistical records about the Artemis
electronic communications infrastructure.  Even with the new influx of
members, however, the addition of these new tasks means that we are still
significantly understaffed to handle all of the work the ECTC has on the
drawing board.  If you would like to join the ECTC and help out, please
check the ECTC task list
(<a href="/adb/09/01/ectc_tasks.html">http://www.asi.org/adb/09/01/ectc_tasks.html</a>) and
sign up for anything that interests you, even those tasks that already have
people working on them.
<p>
    Here is the latest status information from the individual work areas
within the ECTC:

<a name="helpdesk"> </a>
<H3>Help Desk</H3>

    Nanci Brasket continued answering questions directed to the Comm and
Info Center.  Nanci also added thirty-nine new images to the ASI image
library and edited thirty-four new or updated ASI web pages.

<a name="mailinglists"> </a>
<H3>Listserver Mailing Lists</H3>

    Some glitches occurred with the new art-biz-cdrom mailing list that
were caused by bugs in the Listserver software, but the mailing list
configuration was quickly updated to avoid the problem and all of the new
mailing lists are up and running and becoming very active.  You can always
get the latest list of ASI mailing lists from the Mailing Lists web page at
<a href="/adb/09/03/mailing-lists.html">http://www.asi.org/adb/09/03/mailing-lists.html</a>.

<a name="webserver"> </a>
<H3>World Wide Web Server</H3>

    Simon Rowland continued his almost single-handed attempt at growing the
Artemis Data Book (ADB) exponentially each month, with a large number of
new updates added to the web site.  The concentrated design effort that was
started at the beginning of the month to develop a new ASI home page saw an
enormous amount of effort by a large portion of the ECTC during the month.
Randall Severy put together a strawman test page early in the month and the
entire ECTC pushed, prodded, and molded the page until by the end of the
month it met the approval of most of the people who worked on it.  The
exact textual content of the page and the images assigned to the "buttons"
on the page still need to be finalized, but that effort should be completed
in the next few weeks and soon afterwards you should see an announcement
about the new "facelift" for the ASI web site.
<p>
    The large number of updates that have been occurring on the ASI web
server has strained the abilities of the current web site maintenance staff
to keep up with the flood of changes.  Since all of the current updates
involve a very manual and labor-intensive process involving several people,
a discussion ensued in the ECTC about developing an automated Web Site
Maintenance System that could be used to reduce the workload needed to
maintain the web site.  This system would be based on some kind of database
on the web site that would keep track of updated pages as they moved
through the copyediting, technical approval, and style editing phases of
the web maintenance process.  Using web forms backed by Perl or C programs,
this system would elimate much of the duplicate, error-prone, and manual
updating that is currently done.  If you have any experience with systems
of that type, or would like to learn, let the ECTC know as soon as
possible.
<p>
    Simon Rowland set up a series of web forms to allow people to join and
volunteer for work in several new Technical Committees that are being
formed.  Randall Severy wrote the Perl scripts to support those forms.
Candace Dicks developed a group of web forms and Perl scripts to allow
people to join different project teams within the Office of Space Flight.

<a name="webconv"> </a>
<H3>WWW Conversation Pages</H3>

    No progress to report this month.

<a name="newsgroups"> </a>
<H3>Usenet newsgroups</H3>

    No progress to report this month.

<a name="online"> </a>
<H3>On-line services</H3>

    Vik Olliver passed on several discussions from the Spaceflight forum on
CompuServe to the artemis-list mailing list.  Chris Eason began classes to
learn the software used on America OnLine to manage objects in a forum in
preparation for maintaining an Artemis area in the OMNI Forum.

<a name="bbs"> </a>
<H3>Bulletin Boards</H3>

    No progress to report this month.

<a name="meetings"> </a>
<H3>Real-time Meetings</H3>

    No progress to report this month.

<a name="misc"> </a>
<H3>Miscellaneous</H3>

    A discussion took place within the ECTC early in the month about
collecting historical and statistical records about the Artemis Project
electronic communications infrastructure.  That discussion led to the
creation of a new ECTC task to establish a database for those records.
Doug Cross promptly volunteered to set up such a task and started a
follow-up discussion to identify exactly which pieces of information to
keep track of.

<h2 align=center>June 1996 ECTC Status Report</h2>
<CENTER><EM><a href="http://www.asi.org/severy">Randall Severy</a>,
Chairman, Artemis ECTC<BR></CENTER>
<CENTER><a href="mailto:severy@asi.org">severy@asi.org</a></EM></CENTER>
<p>
    The <a href="/adb/09/01/ectc.html">Electronic Communications Technical
Committee</a> had a busy month in
June, capped by a wild and wonderful weekend at Artemis '96 at the end of
June.  Several sessions at Artemis '96 involved ECTC-related matters, and a
variety of issues were resolved and many plans were made at the conference.
Dana Carson gave an update on the move of the asi.org domain to a new ISP
and it looks like the move will take place as soon as two issues, one
business-related and the other technical, have been taken care of.  With
many of the ECTC projects lined up waiting for the asi.org move, it looks
like the rest of 1996 will be extremely busy for this committee.
<p>
    The ECTC continued to expand this past month, with some of the new
faces filling some key new roles in the ECTC task list.  Marvin Ostrega
joined the team and will be helping Simon Rowland with updating and
maintaining the Artemis Data Book.  Marvin will also be working on
additional BBS interfaces for the Artemis mailing lists.  Brad Ackerman
signed on and immediately jumped into two key areas of the ECTC task list,
the Web conversation pages, and the Real-Time Meetings section (with the
help of Brian Cesar).  Two additional new members, Robert Corkum and Yosi
Brosh, round out the new faces in the team.  Although he never formally
left, Dale Amon resurfaced from several months of being busy with other
activities and became active in the ECTC once again.  Both Dale and Brian
Cesar joined the growing number of ECTC members who have gone through
e-mail address changes.  You can find the complete ECTC membership listing
at <a href="/adb/09/01/ectc.html">http://www.asi.org/adb/09/01/ectc.html</a>.
<p>
    There were no additions to the ECTC task list this month, but with the
increase in ECTC membership we had a few more names attached to the
existing task list.  Marvin Ostrega joined Simon Rowland in working on the
Artemis Data Book and linked up with David Brummel and Jim Nobles in
looking at connections to bulletin boards.  John Peel took on the task of
writing the Artemis web page procedure guide.  Randall Severy began working
on the ASI Web Page Maintenance System.  Brad Ackerman started working on
the Web conversation software, and with Brian Cesar started looking into
using IRC for real-time meetings.  And last but not least, Dale Amon
started working again on the Artemis newsgroups after a several month
sabbatical.  Even with all these new volunteers, however, there are still
large gaps in the ECTC task list.  If you would like to join the ECTC and
help out, please check the ECTC task list on the ASI web site at
<a href="/adb/09/01/ectc_tasks.html">http://www.asi.org/adb/09/01/ectc_tasks.html</a>
and sign up for anything
that interests you, even those tasks that already have people working on
them.
<p>
    Here is the latest status information from the individual work areas
within the ECTC:

<a name="helpdesk"> </a>
<H3>Help Desk</H3>

    Nanci Brasket continued answering questions directed to the Comm and
Info Center.  Nanci reorganized the Image Library index into separate
index files for each year.  She also added seventeen new images to the
image library and edited sixty-one new or updated ASI web pages.

<a name="mailinglists"> </a>
<H3>Listserver Mailing Lists</H3>

    A new list, <a href="mailto:asi-osf-leads@asi.org">asi-osf-leads</a>,
was added this month to provide a private
discussion group for the chairpersons of all of the OSF Technical
Committees and Project Teams.

<a name="webserver"> </a>
<H3>World Wide Web Server</H3>

    The Artemis Data Book (ADB) continued to grow at a rapid pace, thanks
to the undaunted efforts of Simon Rowland (now that school is out for the
summer, we may *really* be in trouble!).  The new ASI home page is almost
completed and is waiting for Greg to recover from Artemis '96 to put the
finishing touches on it.  Randall Severy put together a prototype of the
ASI Web Management System and the overall design of the system was
discussed at Artemis '96.  John Peel started an outline of the Web Page
procedure guide, which should show up on the web site in the near future.
Dale Amon set up an account and web space on his server in Ireland in
preparation for becoming a mirror site of the ASI web server.

<a name="webconv"> </a>
<H3>WWW Conversation Pages</H3>

    Brad Ackerman started researching potential tools for implementing Web
conversation pages and decided on the HyperNews system from NCSA.  Brad is
now waiting for the upcoming move of the asi.org domain to begin installing
and configuring the web conversation environment.

<a name="newsgroups"> </a>
<H3>Usenet newsgroups</H3>

    Dale Amon restarted his efforts in planning the Artemis newsgroups.

<a name="online"> </a>
<H3>On-line services</H3>

    Vik Olliver found several newsletters on CompuServe that could be good
places to put references to the Artemis Project when our publicity campaign
gets going.

<a name="bbs"> </a>
<H3>Bulletin Boards</H3>

    Marvin Ostrega volunteered to look into additional connections to
bulletin board systems.

<a name="meetings"> </a>
<H3>Real-time Meetings</H3>

    Brian Cesar and Brad Ackerman did some research on various options for
holding Artemis real-time meetings and settled on IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
as the most promising environment to start with.  A discussion in the ECTC
mailing list about public vs. private IRC servers led to the plan to first
set up Artemis "channels" on existing IRC networks, with the future option
of setting up our own IRC server on asi.org's new home.  Brian and Brad are
working on a Real-Time Meetings procedure guide that will include
instructions on getting set up to access an IRC server and how to join
real-time Artemis discussions.

<a name="misc"> </a>
<H3>Miscellaneous</H3>

    Doug Cross started collecting usage data from the ASI web site for a
database that will be able to provide historical and statistical records
about the Artemis Project electronic communications infrastructure.

<h3>Help Desk</h3>

The Artemis Help Desk currently consists of
<a href="mailto:artemis@asi.org">Nanci Brasket</a>, the Artemis
Communications and Information Center.  As the volume of questions and
requests to Nanci grows over time, we will need to set up a more formalized
help desk that can be staffed by multiple people, with an automated method
of tracking questions and answers.  The following messages from Steve
Jackson and Greg Bennett provide more detail about what's needed in this
area:
<p>
<font size=-1><i><b>
From: sj@io.com (Steve Jackson)<br>
Date: Sun, 14 Jan 1996 00:36:41 -0500
</b></i><p>
Managing "help desk" stuff is non-trivial when you have lots of
questions and more than one answerer. Just grabbing a question from the
pool and sending a note to everyone else "I got this one" breaks down
really fast at high volumes of questions (trust me, I've been there).
<p>
The only way to make sure huge numbers of questions really get answered is
to have a process in which
<OL TYPE=a>
<li>        all questions go to a single supervisor;
<li>        that supervisor assigns them appropriately;
<li>        that supervisor checks SOON to make sure they have really been
                answered, and reassigns them if necessary. (If one of your
                answerers queues his stuff by "easy or interesting" first
                rather than strict FIFO - and who doesn't? - then the hard
                or boring ones get older and older at the bottom of the stack.)
                You can achieve this by having all answerers send a copy of
                the answerer to the supervisor, who then deletes the question
                from his queue entirely.
</OL><p>
Sounds like a pain, doesn't it? It is!!!
<p>
Some of this can be automated. In fact, there is a whole industry geared to
writing help-desk management software. None of which IO has, DAMMIT!!!
Maybe someday.
<p><i><b>
From: grb@asi.org (Gregory R. Bennett)<br>
Date: Sun, 14 Jan 1996 12:52:26 -0500
</b></i><p>
This is another one for the ECTC's job jar.  My guess is that it won't be a
problem for many months at least, though.  The last time I asked Nanci she
said she was not having problems keeping up with mail to artemis.
<p>
When the traffic going to general mailboxes like artemis@asi.org or
webmaster@asi.org gets too heavy, we'll need the email equivalent of a
rotary phone line -- an email router that routes each incoming message to a
different person on a list in a rotary fashion.  It would work the same as
a phone tank ("boiler room") used for PBS beg-a-thons and large government
installations.
<p>
The mail-router program should keep a log of the incoming mail, who it was
routed to, and what action was taken.  This would look like a transaction
processor used to handle mail-order requests or 1-800 order lines for
mail-order companies.  It should also keep track of how long a message has
been ripening in someone's IN box and send it to someone else if it gets
too old; that will accommodate the cases where someone's electronic
connectivity goes haywire, unplanned absence, or whatever.
<p>
The program should be able to deal with temporarily putting one of the
official correspondents on 'inactive' status.  That takes care of planned
vacations, heavy workload periods, illness, burnout.  It should accept a
command from its list of correspondents to do this without other human
intervention.  These commands must be controlled by passwords to prevent
mischief.  Only the lead for a given activity would be able to add a name
to the list of correspondents.
<p>
If this program were able to do all these things and be user-friendly, it
would be marketable.  I suspect such software already exists for handling
email sent to the White House and to Bill Gates's "ask-bill" address, but
I've never heard of someone marketing it.
<p><i><b>
From: grb@asi.org (Gregory R. Bennett)<br>
Date: Sun, 14 Jan 1996 14:51:12 -0500
</b></i><p>
     Yeah, what Steve said!  Help desk email must always have an individual
human's signature.
<p>
     The program I described in my previous post would be an electronic
implementation of that human supervisor at IO, assigning action to a pool
of individuals and tracking responses.
<p>
     Tracking responses is vital.  One of the major problems Nanci has as
the Comm & Info Center is lack of feedback; she often doesn't know if the
person she forward mail to even received the mail.
<p>
     Add some more features to the wish list:
<p>
<OL>
<li>    When someone writes a response, it probably should go onto the
        web.  Then the official correspondent can give an appropriate
        response by referring to a URL.
<p>
<li>    Develop some autobots to mail help and faq files for those who
        don't want to (or can't) access the web for an answer.
<p>
<li>    Tracking who answered which person's questions, and assigning
        that person as a "client" to the official correspondent's list.
        If someone asks another question, give preference to having him
        correspond with the same ASI representative.
<p>
<li>    Add flexibility to reassign a client to a different representative
        if the need arises.
</OL><p>
     Working the help desks is an art form, requiring some special personal
communication skills.  For an excellent description of that job, check out
the help-wanted advertisement from IO in the io.admin newsgroup.  (You'll
also see why IO is so popular with their customers.)

<h3>Listserver Mailing Lists</h3>

<h4>Mailing List Software</h4>
<p>
An excellent review of most of the Listservers that are available can be
found in the <a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/news.answers/mail/list-admin/software-faq">
Mailing list management software FAQ</a>.
<p>
CREN ListProc and LISTSERV, though they seem to be the most capable
listservers available, were not considered since they are
commercial products with fairly hefty price tags.
<p>
A review of the three most promising listservers, 
<a href="ftp://cs-ftp.bu.edu/pub/listserv">
ListProc v6.0c</a>,
<a href="http://www.math.psu.edu/barr/majordomo-faq.html">
Majordomo v1.93</a>, and
<a href="ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail">
SmartList v3.10</a>, measuring each of them in several key areas that are
important to the Artemis mailing lists, can be found in the
<a href="/adb/09/03/listserver-comparison.html">Mailing List Server
Comparison</a> web page.
<p>
One key task in the Listserver Mailing Lists area is to set up and maintain
archives of all mailing list traffic that are accessible both from
anonymous ftp and from e-mail requests.  Some listserver packages have
built-in archive access capabilities, two (ListProc and SmartList) even have
an archive
search capability built in.  If we use a listserver that doesn't support
e-mail archive access, or the existing access is limited, we will need to
install an external archive service.  An excellent summary of archive
access software can be found in the
<a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/news.answers/mail/archive-servers/faq">
Mail Archive Server Software List</a>.  One external archive package is
<a href="ftp://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/packages/ftpmail">FTPMAIL</a>.
<p>
There are also several tools available that allow basic administration of
mailing lists (adding and removing users, getting information about the lists)
through web pages.  Two such tools are
<a href="http://iquest.com/~fitz/www/mailserv/">MailServ</a> and
<a href="http://www.netspace.org/users/dwb/lwgate.html">LWGate</a>.

<h4>Conversation Guidelines for electronic discussions</h4>
<p>
With the large numbers of people participating in the Artemis Project, and
the variety of different discussions that will be going on in the different
mailing lists, it will be helpful to have a set of guidelines for
conducting the ongoing discussions.  The following messages from Dale Amon
and Greg Bennett provide some background information:
<p>
<font size=-1><i><b>
From: amon@walt.music.qub.ac.uk (Dale Amon)<br>
Date: Sat, 14 Oct 95 15:39:12 GMT
</b></i><p>
I am as qualified as anyone to discuss the use of news, mail lists
and web sites for problem solving - I've been at it since the dawn
of time (well, the dawn of cyberspace at least)
<p>
There are a number of problems (and advantages) with most
forms of internet communications when they are related to
real problem solving.
<p>
<UL>
<li>Growth - The net is growing so fast that there is an eternal
         supply of newbies ready willing and able to tell us
         all about the New Ideas and Startling Tidbits they
         have. All of which were last discussed with the
         batch of newbies 3 months ago... And thus it has
         been for 15 years...
<p>
         This may change when the net reaches a market
         saturation level. When that happens, newbies
         will be real children instead of cyberspace
         children.
<p>
<li>Focus -  It is very difficult to solve problems unless there
         is direction, focus, goal-seeking, problem space
         pruning and an identifiable "deliverable" as an
         end point. None of these exist in the typical
         unmoderated (or moderated for the matter) groups.
<p>
<li>Creativity - The net comes up with high marks because even off
         the wall ideas are discussed. There are few mechanisms
         of brainstorming that can match the freewheeling
         nature of the net.
<p>
<li>Globalization - As human knowledge explodes, individuals specializations
         have become narrower and narrower by necessity. The
         downside is that it becomes more and more difficult for
         the researchers in a narrow area to communicate with each
         other. Fields stagnate without the intellectual ferment
         caused by bull sessions and esoteric argumentation between
         peers. In the internet world we can have a few specialists
         sharing a narrow interest act as a virtual institute on that
         subject.
<p>
<li>Synthesis - Specialization has also had a down side. The narrower the
         areas of research, the more there is that falls in the cracks.
         And the number of cracks is probably more like a polynomial
         explosion than a linear one. But the ease of access to discussions
         on the net means that it is easy for cross fertilization to
         happen. If a statement is made by a researcher in a physics
         speciality, it may end up being cross posted and mailed to
         hundreds or thousands of others in different specialties. This
         can and does spark debates and new research.
</UL><p>
How do we structure information systems so that real work can be accomplished?
Lets start with idea generation and progress through to a definable product.
<p>
<b>Virtual Pub / Dorm Lounge / Student Union snack Bar</b> -
        This is the open maillist or news group. "This is Liberty Hall... spit
        on the mat and call the cat a bastard". People come and go, dip into
        discussion as they feel like. Little real work gets done here, but
        new ideas are generated and old truths demolished.
<p>
Ideas start from bull sessions. The ideas might pop up spontaneously, or they
might be tossed into the the shark tank by a "moderator" from LRC. In the
former case the ASI is feeding ideas to LRC; in the later LRC has a problem
for which it needs ideas or an answer.
<p>
But bull sessions do not a product make. Something further has to happen. My
suggestion is that an LRC or ASI bull session monitor watch the open
discussions, and when an interesting idea comes up, that idea be assigned
virtual office space. At this point we stop being democratic and start working.
One individual is assigned as the team leader. Others who are interested in
developing the idea are given the option of being a part of the team. For
better or worse the team leader is boss and may fire those who are disruptive,
fail to complete assigned tasks, or who continuously stray from goal directed
behavior.
<p>
In turn, the team leader is assigned a deadline and milestones by LRC. The
deliverable is a technical report, possibly with a minority report attached.
A team that fails to meet its deadlines can be disbanded by the management.
Teams are disbanded and members reassigned when they complete their projects.
<p>
<b>Virtual Office</b> -
        A place where a group with an interest in a particular topic works
        in a structured environment with responsibilities and accountability
        enforced.
<p>
When a draft report has been completed, it is then thrown open to general
debate in an open "peer group" forum. This could consist of making it available
to the members of the bull session and to relevant news groups.
<p>
<b>Virtual Conference Hall</b> -
        A place where reports are presented and open debate held on their
        content. Off topic debate is forbidden. Only matters relating to
        critique of the report are allowed.
<p>
A specific time limit is placed on the comment period. When that period
is ended, the team filters through the comments and generates a final report.
The final report is published as part of a body of high quality *reviewed*
design and research on which LRC can base its plans.
<p>
<b>Virtual Library</b> -
        A place where final reports are available for search and reference.
<p>
Now how do we go about creating a structure like this? We certainly don't want
to go out and write new tools. That would delay any such efforts by years. It
is also probably unnecessary. Most of it can be accomplished within the
framework of existing tools, <i>given that LRC has a professional manager to
create teams and monitor results</i>. At some point this should be a full time
professional position. If I use LRC rather than ASI it is because I see
possibilities here for real work that needs real management.
<p>
Now the mechanisms:
<p>
<OL>
<li>The Pub is simply the Artemis list as it exists. Noisy, high volume, some
gems and a fair amount of BS.
<p>
<li>The Office is a small mail list with a limited group of people on it. LRC
    assigns the leaders and sets the goals and deadlines. The team leader has
    rights to hire and fire his volunteers as necessary to complete the job.
    When the job is done, the mail list is disbanded. Some groups might be
    longer lived if they are really good at producing results on an ongoing
    basis. It is even concievable that the best of the best might one day
    become a real set of employees with LRC.
<p>
    But the watch word is "Only Results Count". And LRC defines what Results
    means.
<p>
<li>The Virtual Conference Hall could be based on the Web site recently created
    by the MIT Media Lab for their 1010.org discussion. It has all the right
    properties. We would place the draft report(s) up on the web site and
    all comers could read them and make comments. The comments are stored
    and the team leader could collect them on a given "end of comment period"
    date. The Team then discussed the comments and writes the final report.
<p>
<li>The Virtual Library is simply the existing LRC or Artemis web site. Final
    Reports are put on line when they have been approved. There might be a need
    for two areas: one which is reports that deal with "official" LRC positions
    and plans; and one which is more speculative or not directly related to
    primary goals of the corporation.
<p>
    As technologies (or more honestly, time and people and resources to
    impliment existing technologies) become available, search engines and the
    like can be added to make topics more easily accessible.
</OL><p>
Nothing is static. There must always be feedback and continued debate. With
this procedure we end up with quality information. Then, when a newbie debate
begins, or when wizards rehash an old truth with new facts, a starting point
can be pointed out which is accessible to all. With some luck that will
raise the overall level of debate even in "the Pub".
<p><i><b>
From: grb@asi.org (Greg Bennett)<br>
Date: Mon, 8 Jan 1996 21:23:40 -0600
</b></i><p>
     Jeffrey Weiss <jmweiss@ix.netcom.com>  brought this subject up in a
private email posted while he was looking at the web site, but I think it's
an important question for the whole Artemis Project community to consider.
Jeff cited the example of a political listserver where they use a variation
on Robert's Rules of Order to guide the conversation.
<p>
     I hadn't really thought about having rules for the on-line
discussions, but I don't think it's necessary to establish rules for every
forum in the Artemis Project.  Still, we could benefit from having some
guidelines posted with the list of lists on the web site as we launch these
things.
<p>
     Using a variation on Robert's Rules might be appropriate for a
political discussion where there are twice as many opinions as participants
and a lot of diametrically opposed opinions.  In that kind of environment,
it's often important to level the field and assure that no single
personality dominates the deliberation.
<p>
     In the engineering world, when working together in person, we're more
likely to select a leader for a team and then rely on that team to define
rules that will work for them.  Each leader's style is a little bit
different, and the people who make up each time bring their individual
talents and skills.
<p>
     There's a difference between engineering and politics.  Especially in
the Artemis Project, we're looking for the most creative problem-solving
solutions people can contribute.  That's not just in technical areas,
either.  We need creative solutions to all sorts of business and political
issues as well.  Politics involves a lot of problem-solving, too, but often
the greatest difficulty is getting people to agree on what the problem is.
<p>
     In the Artemis Project we at least pretty much agree on what our goals
are, and what the problems are that we have to solve.  (It shouldn't be
surprising that the most disagreement and puzzlement involves defining what
the political problems are, and how to deal with them.)  So in this
environment we should be able to leave it up to each team to adopt whatever
rules will help them solve the problems.
<p>
      That brings me back to posting guidelines.  Rather than trying to
come up with those at the beginning, let's ask each participant who is
interesting in developing techniques for using the electronic forum to
share learning from the sundry groups.  The appropriate forum for that
would be the Electronic Communication Technical Committee; though I'm
getting a feeling that the ECTC might want to subdivide the ectc@asi.org
mailing list as the project grows.
</font><p>
<h4>ADB Location Information</h4>
<p>
Listserver web pages and related files should be placed in section 9.3 of
the Artemis Data Book in the /adb/09/03 directory of asi.org.

<p><hr>
<a name="webserver"> </a>
<h3>World Wide Web Server</h3>

<a href="mailto:dcarson@access.digex.net">Dana Carson</a> is the Artemis
<a href="mailto:webmaster@asi.org">Webmaster</a>.  Maintenance of the
Artemis Web Site is done by the <a href="mailto:asi-web@asi.org">Web
Maintenance Team</a>, which handles the responsibility for World Wide Web
Server task #4 in the ECTC Task List.  Anyone who has something that they
want to put on the Artemis web site should send text or HTML documents or
graphics to the Web Maintenance Team, who will update the documents to
match the style and format of the ASI web site and put it on the web
server.
<p>
<h4>Web Server Style Guide</h4>
<p>
With a group of people maintaining the Artemis web site, it is important to
maintain a common style among all of the web pages on the site.  To do this
successfully, we need a Web style guide that will be used for all ASI web
pages.  The following messages from Greg Bennett, Dana Carson, and Simon
Rowland provide some of the initial ideas for the web style guide:
<p>
<font size=-1><i><b>
From: grb@asi.org (Gregory R. Bennett)<br>
Date: Sat, 23 Dec 1995 14:52:42 -0600
</b></i><p>
     The procedure for server-side includes and definition of the Artemis
Project's style for using them should go into the Internet Site Design
Document, in section 9.4 of the Artemis Data Book. We want to get into the
habit of recommending changes to the Data Book, and answering questions
with updates to the Data Book whenever we can.  Notes should at least
include a reference to the document section we're talking about.
<p>
     Besides making our work more efficient -- we can answer questions just
by giving someone a URL -- this will make it possible for us to access the
information wherever we are.  For instance, I did a dumb thing: most of the
email notes I recently written are in my machine at the office, and now I'm
off for more than a week for the Christmas holidays and have access only to
my machine at home.  I neglected to send my electronic address book home,
too.  Silly me; but I know several other folks have the same problem.
<p>
     The Data Book ought to have a page of reference links where folks can
go to learn how to do html coding in general, as well as our own tutorials
specifically telling how to do a document for the Artemis Project web site.
Dana's note about the UIUC tutorial on server-side processing is an
example.
<p>
     Is John on the ectc list?  When last we spake on that subject, he
volunteered to download the Internet Site Design document and code it in
html; so he'd be interested in this.  I don't know where he is in reworking
the outline, so for the nonce I'll try to divide these comments by subject
without attempting to figure out the section numbers they'd affect.
<p>
Now for some questions and comments about the WWW site design . . .
<p>
<b>     Server-side processing</b>
<p>
     I take it the "s" in ".shtml" is a flag to the server to process a
file.  If we include the Nav Bar in every page, then every file would have
to be .shtml, right?  Will that significantly slow down delivery of a
document?
<p>
<b>     What to include and what to leave out</b>
<p>
     We want pages from the Artemis Data Book to be delivered fast, keeping
overhead to a minimum.  So as a rule we should avoid sending decorations
and peripheral information.  Document titles and text headers are
sufficient for what we're doing; though I suppose a tiny .gif of the
half-moon logo in a header would be acceptable.  It would at least provide
a bit of continuing inspiration.
<p>
     Access counters do not add anything to the value of the information
delivered; but of course access statistics are important to acquiring
sponsors for parts of the data book.  Don't we have a program that counts
access to each resource without having to include a counter in the document
delivered to the user?  If so, we should leave the access counter off the
standard pages we deliver.
<p>
     Backgrounds are pretty, but really slow down delivery of a document.
Let's avoid them and stick with setting the background to white.
<p>
<b>     Index-building technique</b>
<p>
     If server processing is significantly slower and more cpu-intensive
than just sending an html document, would we be better off having an
off-line program build a bunch of plain html index files?  I'm thinking we
could run a program whenever we know there are changes.  That's a trade-off
between fully automating the index-building vs. the overhead of rebuilding
the index every time someone accesses a section of the Data Book.  I don't
know exactly how all this works, so I don't know what to recommend.  This
is one for the experts.
<p>
<b>     Footers</b>
<p>
     We might want to have two versions of the Nav Bar -- one to use in
general documents and one to use specifically for files in the Artemis Data
Book.  Code that generates links to previous section indexes and such won't
make sense outside the Artemis Data Book structure.  Of course, the Nav Bar
might be in a file by itself, called from yet another file like
"adb-footer.shtml" which automatically includes it.  Can we do recursive
includes?  Would that slow down processing even more?
<p>
     I sent a note with a design scheme for this a few days ago.  Here's a
small update to that thinking.  Besides the index-builder, this is where
server-side processing really comes into its own.  The footer should look
something like this . . .
<pre><font size=+0>     This page maintained by [name] [&lt;address&gt;]

     [Index for this section: (x.y.z.a title)]
     [Previous section: (x.y.z title)]
     =====================================================================
     +-----------+-----------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------+
     |  Artemis  |  Artemis  |  Artemis  |   FAQ   | Reference | Catalog |
     |  Project  |  Society  | Data Book |         |  Mission  |         |
     +-----------+-----------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------+
     =====================================================================
     Artemis Data Book Section Boss: [name] [&lt;address&gt;]
     Last update: (mod date)
     Copyright and trademark notices
</font></pre><p>
. . . with everything below the Nav Bar in small type.  Note that I put the
author's name above the footer, because the author (or maintainer) would be
hard-coded into each document.  The rest of the footer comes from external
information with an include.
<p>
     The link to the local index is just a link to whatever index.html (or
index.shtml) resides in the current directory.  The previous section
reference is parsed from the directory tree.  For example, if the document
is in section 4.3.2.1, it would be in directory /adb/04/03/02/01.  The
previous section would be /adb/04/03/02, which of course parses to 4.3.2.
<p>
     The title for each section is read from a file, "title.txt", which
resides in each directory.  So the title for section 4.3.2 will be found in
file "/adb/04/03/02/title.txt".
<p>
     Similarly, the name and email address of the section boss are found in
file "section-boss.txt".
<p>
     Of course, the mod date comes from that parser Dana wrote for
"test.shtml", and the copyright and trademark notices are standardized.
<p>
<b>      Fun with search engines</b>
<p>
      I've noticed people are beginning to include a
<tt><font size=+0>&lt;!--Keywords...&gt;</font></tt>
declaration in their html code.  We should do that, so that search engines
will find our site if someone is search for cool space stuff.  How about
including some general key words in every document:
<pre><font size=+0>       &lt;!-- Keywords: manned space moon private space ventures future
                      luna lunar space travel spacecraft moon mining
                      lunar resources artemis project artemis society
                      international adventure tourism arcology ecology
                      science technology space business entertainment
                      movies television publications merchandise
                      ephemeris commercial lunar base moon base moonbase &gt;
</font></pre><p>
      The repetition of common key words will cause a search engine to give
our pages higher priority on the list of search results.
<p>
      Of course, if we _really_ want to attract people to the site, we need
to get someone to work up essays on zero-g and low-gravity sex, and put in
some crass commercialism by building the calendar of the "Girls of Mare
Nubium" or whatever.  As long as there's something entertaining, folks
searching for key words like "sex" or "bikini" will forgive us for
attracting them to our site.  And what the the heck -- they're searching
for adventure, so we just might provide them some interesting adventure if
not the sort of entertainment they had in mind.
<p>
      As best I can tell, search engines like Lycos find web pages by
following links, so the more inter-linked our site is, the more likely that
someone will find us.  Lycos even has my personal bio page linked now.
<p>
<b>      Status of the Artemis Data Book Directory Structure</b>
<p>
      Except for section 7.0 "Artemis Society Local Chapters and Contacts"
and the appendices, I've completed building the directory structure for the
whole Artemis Data Book.  I got that done last night.
<p>
      Each directory has a little 1K file in it giving the section number
and abbreviated section title as its file name.  These little files are
just navigation aids for accessing the site with ftp or telnet; they show
up in the filename listing so you'll know where you are.  The content of
those little files is just a chunk of html that explains why it's there and
links back to the main index for the Artemis Data Book.

     The idea I was discussing with Dana about a month ago was to have
every directory in the Artemis Data Book contain things like:
<p>
<UL>
<li>Subject -- text file readable by cgi script
<li>Key words -- text file
<li>Introduction to subject -- text file
<li>Responsible person -- text file
<li>Guestbook form for comments, questions
<li>Form for volunteering to help
<li>'Mailto' form for joining related listserver
<li>Form for submitting an article to this section of data book
<li>Some other stuff that doesn't come to mind right now -- maybe
        Dana can unearth my previous wish list
</UL><p>
     The libraries would especially benefit from having a script that
allows someone to submit new articles.   It would automate assigning image
or document numbers and automatically update the index files.
<p>
     Most of the information in those little text files would also be used
by the data book index-generator script to build index files for each
directory in the tree.

<b>     Nav Bar . . .</b>
<p>
     The "Nav Bar" is that little table at the end of each page with
standard pointers to the Artemis Project, Artemis Society, etc.  A couple
months ago I started replacing The Lunar Resources Company link with a link
to the Artemis Data Book index.  There are a couple reasons for doing this.
<p>
     The practical reason is to make it easy for folks to find the Data
Book index, which is a window to all the details of the project.
<p>
     The political reason is to let The Lunar Resources Company's presence
fade into the background; that makes it easier to maintain ASI's
independence and non-profit status, and let's LRC concentrate on building a
business while ASI builds the organization.  It does not mean LRC is taking
a less active role in the Artemis Project.  Quite the opposite, in fact: by
separating the volunteer side of the project from the commercial side of
it, we can move forward in both arenas with fewer inhibitions to progress.
<p>
<b>     Web site design thought: automated processing, the sequel . . .</b>
<p>
     If you like this one, it ought to be incorporated into the site design
document and tutorials for building and maintaining the site.
<p>
     Dana and Randall, when we set up that gizmo that reads little text
files, we should have a field for the author of each page, and a separate
one for the maintainer, with appropriate pointers to grab each individual's
email address from the /bios directory.  The idea of getting the email from
the /bios directory is that then we only have to update it once when
someone's address changes.
<p>
     Here's an idea: perhaps instead of having a cgi scripts that runs
every time someone accesses a URL, it would be better to have a script that
builds the html file and updates the indexes when things change:
<p>
<OL>
<li>    When a document is added or changed, update indexes from that
        point on up the directory tree.
<p>
<li>    When a person's address changes, scan the whole site for
        references; or just rebuild all the pages and indexes.
</OL><p>
     The idea here is to reduce server-side processing time.  There's no
need to assemble a page each time it's delivered, if that page will only
change once a year.  At the cost of a few KB to store duplicate copies of
the Nav Bar all over the site, we can eliminate the need for processing
every page with a script.
<p>
     The tricky part will be make the pages maintainable.  We might want to
split it out so that each html document has three parts: header, footer,
and body.  The body is the part maintained by humans, while the header and
footer are maintained the machine.
<p>
     We could have separate text files named "foobar.body", which get
incorporated into "foobar.html" files.  The indexer would only list the
"foobar.html" files it finds in a given directory.

     To make this work, we need to establish a standard format for telling
the indexer the name of each document.  That could be a separate file
listing all the foobar.body files and the document name for each, or it
could be a standard-format comment field contained in each foobar.body
file.  I think it would be easiest to maintain the documents if we
established a standard form for putting comments in the foobar.body
documents.
<p>
     The standard format for tags in a .body document might be:
<pre><font size=+0>     &lt;!-- asidocname="Subject of this essay" --&gt;
     &lt;!-- asidocsection="4.6.5.3.1" --&gt;
     &lt;!-- asiauthor="H. W. Wrotethis --&gt;
     &lt;!-- asimaintainer="I. M. Aitchtiemell" --&gt;
     &lt;!-- asicopyright="Mark Territory, Inc." --&gt;
     &lt;!-- asiorigdate="mm-dd-yyyy" --&gt;
</font></pre><p>
     I added "asi" to the tag names because future version of html might
add some keywords, but it's unlikely they'll use "asi" in any of them.
These comments need to be in the foobar.body files, but do not need to be
the foobar.html file that the indexing engine assembles.
<p>
     Including the ADB section number allows us to do some interesting things:
<p>
<OL>
<li>    Indexer adds the document section number to the titles at the
        top of the page, and picks up section title (not to be confused
        with the name of the document it's processing)
<p>
<li>    New documents submitted via anonymous ftp could remain in a
        holding tank until authorized webmaster's apprentice tells a
        script to add it to the Artemis Data Book.  That script could
        parse the docsection to determine the correct destination
        directory, mv the file there, add the new filename and asidocname
        to the list of active documents in that directory, and tell the
        indexer that it just added a new document.
</OL><p>
     I really like this idea because it means the guys maintaining the
documents only need to worry about making the actual document content work.
If we decide to change the style of headers and footers, they'll change
consistently throughout the whole web site.
<p>
     It also makes it easy for someone to submit a new document -- just
anonymous ftp it to a holding tank, and then the ECTC webbers take over.
That gives us the same control as the sysops do on GEnie.  If the
webmaster's apprentice isn't sure, he'll know the section boss for that
part of the Data Book, and can easily ask if the document should be added
(or updated) by emailing a URL pointing to the file in the holding tank.

<h3>WWW Conversation Pages</h3>

One of the more popular Web conversation packages is
<a href="http://union.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HyperNews/get/hypernews.html">
HyperNews</a>, with its companion program,
<a href="http://www.eit.com/software/hypermail/hypermail.html">
HyperMail</a>.  HyperNews apparently does not yet support bi-directional
gateways to mailing lists, but such a feature is supposedly under
development.  Another web conversation package is a Perl program that
allows a BBS style dialog to take place on a web page.  An example of this
program can be found at
<a href="http://www.42.com/talkto/steve/wwwboard.html">
http://www.42.com/talkto/steve/wwwboard.html</a>.
<p>
In addition to the Web conversation environment, we also will need to
implement a web interface to the mailing list archives, using some kind of
search engine.  We also need to implement a search engine for the entire
Web site, which may or may not be the same as the archive search
capability.  Two potential web search engines are
<a href="http://glimpse.cs.arizona.edu:1994/ghttp">Glimpse</a>
and <a href="http://www.clever.net/self/htgrep.htm">Htgrep</a>.
Three other tools that allow access to mailing list archives from web pages are
<a href="http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/mhonarc.html">MHonArc</a>,
<a href="http://www.netspace.org/users/dwb/lwgate.html">LWGate</a> and
<a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/staff/morgan/about-listwebber2.html">
ListWebber</a>.

<a name="newsgroups"> </a>
<h3>Usenet newsgroups</h3>

Dale Amon is currently working on setting up a hierarchy of newsgroups for
the Artemis project, most likely a top-level artemis.* hierarchy.  Once the
newsgroups have been established, however, they will be difficult to use
without an automated gateway to the mailing lists, since any discussions
would be separated between the two communication environments.
Consequently, establishing an automated newsgroup to mailing list gateway
environment is one of the top priorities of the ECTC.
<p>
There are several potential methods of establishing a newsgroup to mailing
list gateway.  The first, and easiest, is to use a listserver, such as
ListProc 6.0c, that has a built-in gateway to newsgroup feature.  If we
are using a different listserver, however, we will need to implement an
external gateway service.  One such service is the software that is used to
gateway the sci.space hierarchy to the Space Digest mailing list.  This
software is available from
<a href="ftp://vacation.venari.cs.cmu.edu/usr0/anon/dig.tar.Z">
ftp://vacation.venari.cs.cmu.edu/usr0/anon/dig.tar.Z</a>.
Another package is called Newsgate.  It is only available on request, but
we have made the request and have obtained a copy of the software.
<p>
Newsgroup web pages and related files should be placed in section 9.5 of
the Artemis Data Book in the /adb/09/05 directory of asi.org.

<p><hr>
<a name="online"> </a>
<h3>Online Services</h3>

The overall plan for this area of the ECTC task list is to establish an
Artemis "presence" on all of the major online services.  The exact nature
of that presence will vary from service to service, but hopefully will
contain at least a link to the Artemis web site and a copy of the FAQ and FRO
files.  The ideal form of presence is a dedicated "forum" that is
automatically gatewayed to the Artemis mailing lists, similar to what is
currently being implemented on GEnie.
<p>
The GEnie gateway software was developed by Randall Severy and uses TTY
dial-up connections to GEnie twice a day to upload all mailing list traffic
to GEnie and download most forum traffic from GEnie.  The GEnie gateway
software consists of three Unix 'C' programs.  The first program downloads
any new messages from GEnie and sends them out as a mail message to the
appropriate mailing list.  A second program captures incoming messages from
the mailing lists and saves them in special directories.  The third program
takes all of the files from those special directories and uploads them to
GEnie in the appropriate topics.  Some basic filter routines are built in
to check to make sure messages from GEnie don't get re-uploaded to GEnie
and messages from the mailing lists don't get sent back to the mailing
lists.  These filters handle basic mail loop problems, but do not check for
user-generated errors.  If someone sends multiple copies of a message, as
has happened from time to time, they are all uploaded to GEnie, unless
Randall sees them and deletes them manually before the upload program runs.
<p>
That gateway software could be readily converted to support other online
services, but only if the exact nature of the protocol used for uploading
and downloading online forum traffic is defined and documented.
<p>
In the short term, we need to set up information on the ASI web site that
identifies where on each online service to find information about the
Artemis Project and who to contact on each online service for more
information.  This information should be available from individual web
pages, one for each service, modeled after the
<a href="/adb/09/06/01/genie.html">GEnie page</a> written by Nanci Brasket.
The GEnie page describes where to find Artemis information on GEnie, how it
is organized, and how to sign up for access to GEnie.
<p>
One key issue in establishing automated gateways between on-line services
and Artemis mailing lists is that many on-line services have what is known
as a "compilation copyright" on all material that is posted on their
service.  The following message from Greg Bennett describes the issue in
more detail:
<p>
<font size=-1><i><b>
From: grb@io.com (Gregory R. Bennett)<br>
Date: Fri, 2 Feb 1996 17:38:24 -0500
</b></i><p>
     In those topics where GEnie allows us to pipeline Artemis Project
messages into and out of the service, they're essentially waiving the
compilation copyright.  If AOL or MSN, or anybody, would like to join GEnie
in participating in the project, they would also have to waive compilation
copyrights to any information moving through the pipeline.
<p>
     There's more to this than me being a curmudgeon.  The Project won't
work if we can't freely archive and use the information generated by its
participants.
<p>
     So, when contacting commercial services about this, make sure to
include in your description of the proposed service that they cannot claim
compilation copyright to any Artemis Project material.

<h3>Real-time Meetings</h3>

Several real-time meetings of the LRC board of directors have taken place
using the GEnie RTC (Real-Time Chat) "meeting rooms".  This ability to hold
real-time meetings from remote locations will be extremely useful for many
of the Artemis technical committees, but since most meeting attendees will
not have GEnie access, a more common form of real-time communication is
needed.  One suggestion that has been raised several times is the use of a
"MOO" or "Mud" (Multi-user domain) for real-time meetings, but Muds and
MOOs are high-maintenance projects that consume a lot of computing
resources.  A more easily implemented solution is to either use the
existing IRC (Internet Relay Chat) services or to set up a chat server on
asi.org.  An excellent resource for information about IRC and chat servers
is Yahoo's
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Internet/Chatting/">
Internet Chatting</a> pages.  The following messages from Simon Rowland,
Randall Severy, Greg Bennett, Steve Jackson, and Mark Barbisan contain
excerpts from some of the discussions that have been going on about
real-time meetings:
<p>
<font size=-1><i><b>
From: simon@eagle.ca (Simon Rowland)<br>
Date: Thu, 23 Nov 1995 16:52:03 -0500
</b></i><p>
  I'd been thinking about the problem of communications between members of
tech committees who happen to be spread around the globe. So, I suggest we
install some Mlti User Dungeon (or at least chat) software on the lunacity
server. But leave out the monsters which have a tendancy to kill you.
<p>
  That way, there can be real-time meetings that can be _specific_ without
boring the rest of Artemis about the turbopump cabling layout. Logs can
still be kept and archived, and each commttee can have a seperate meeting
zone--type "enter the LTV" and you're in the alternate LTV missions room.
<p>
  Also, a link from the WWW site could lead to the "Houston lobby", where
there is always a member explaining the project to curious space people,
*interactivly*. Obviously, it would have to be manned in shifts, but it
would be fun to do. And Vik can do it while we Canadians are sleeping. :-)
<p>
  Some boring ideas of mine: have objects like paper/computers/billboards
containing Artemis propoganda, which can be read by exploring newbies.
Also, monsters (aliens?) who instead of killing you, explain the mission
scenario when provoked (worse then death :). Boardrooms could be "rented"
by some committee or group when it's not worth the trouble of programming
in an new area. And the Lunacity, where people engage in meandering
discussions about how great it'd be to live on the moon....

     At work I've run a MOO based on Xerox's LambaMOO core for several years
now as a virtual meeting place for field offices scattered around the
world that we work with on a regular basis.  Based on my experiences using
such an environment for business-related activity (we cleaned up most
"game"-related references in the MOO, i.e changed "players" to "users", etc.),
such an environment would be very useful for real-time meetings and
conferences for the Artemis technical committees and the Artemis Society as a
whole.  One of the problems we ran into in our MOO was dealing with time-zone
differences (it was a real pain setting up US and Australia conferences
simultaneously, for instance), but in our case the Artemis society is not
(yet) as widely spread out as the field organization at work is.
<p><i><b>

 FWIW, we've had good success with on-line meetings of the LRC board of
 directors, using the RTC area on GEnie.  That was with about a dozen people
 on line.  The difference between our experience and Steve's, besides using
 different software (I've never seen Metaverse), is the type of meeting.  We
 had an agenda mailed out ahead of time, and about 90% of the business was
 things we could prepare for by having largish text files ready to dump.
<p>
Another difference might be that everybody on line was either a writer or a
 computer wizard; hence, fast typists.
<p><i><b>
From: sj@io.com (Steve Jackson)<br>
Date: Wed, 13 Dec 1995 23:42:10 -0600 (CST)
</b></i><p>
The Metaverse runs on MOO, which enables a lot more than chat. However,
much of what it enables is distracting...
<p>
Note that if all the attendees happen to be on
multitasking machines, and if they all have access to Web pages, then all
text files can be placed on the Web before the meeting, and everyone can
"chat" in one window while looking at the appropriate files in another. (I
actually work across two Mac screens, but lots of people have single
screens plenty big enough for this to work.)
<p>
Getting everybody to stop backspacing to fix the
little typos when the meening is clear :-) will be a big help.
<p>
So yes, I agree, done your way a meeting would be more likely to run
efficiently.
<p><i><b>
From: severy@is.ge.com (Randall Severy)<br>

</b></i><p>
     I would definitely agree with all of your comments.  From my experience
with holding meetings in our MOO (as well as the occasional RTC on GEnie), it
helps a huge amount if an agenda is passed out in advance, and it goes a lot
more smoothly if everyone is a fast typist.  To Steve's earlier comment, I
also found that I would work on something else while waiting for replies in
the conversation, especially when slow typists were involved.  The idea of
using Web pages as a "shared handout" is a great one, I looked into doing that
for our MOO meetings but since most of the remote sites were accessing the MOO
through a dial-up TTY link they didn't have access to our Web server.  If we
do starting using such environments for Artemis meetings, we will definitely
want to plan on enhancements such as using Web documents as part of the
meetings.

Okay, I would think IRC would be the best way to go (easiest for everybody to
pickup)...MOO and MUSEs are more gaming things, however, it is possible...If
we did want to do a MOO, MARE, MUD or MUSE, I think MUSE would be the best way
to go...MUSE is probably the most advanced, and we could have some really fun
things on it...However, I don't really know how to code in MUSE (I started to
learn how to code on a MUSE. Apparently its a lot like "C" (I used to play on
one, but it started taking up too much of my time and people were taking it
TOO seriously, so I quit) The other thing with a MUSE is that you have to have
a "character" (I'm not saying we have to role play, but you still have to
setup some sort of "person"), and it can take a while for everybody to catch
onto a MUSE (while IRC is pretty easy)...So I still think IRC would be the
best thing to setup...
<p>
Also, once we get on MSN, we can have a chat forum on there
too...(Unfortuanatly, only MSN members can get onto it..)

     I've run a MOO for several years now at work that we have used from
time to time for online meetings between work groups that are scattered around
the world.  There are various things you need to do differently in that sort
of environment, but it has worked reasonably well.  Most of the MOOs and MUSEs
are set up as gaming environments, but that is not necessarily a fundamental
part of them.  We use Xerox's LambdaMOO software, which was developed
initially to provide the foundation for their "AstroVR" astronomer
collaboration and meeting system, so if you don't add all of the gaming stuff
on to it there isn't much problem using it for business-type stuff.  The only
thing we did was change all references to "player" to "user" in the database
to eliminate any vestige of the gaming connotations.
<p>
     Given all that, however, I agree that IRC is simpler to use for
chat-style meetings.  I've been having a lot of trouble recently, however,
trying to find a decent way to get to IRC through a simple telnet connection
(because I'm sitting behind a firewall at work, I can't use the normal IRC
clients).  Most of the IRC telnet servers I've found have gone commercial and
now charge for access.  That's why one of the first things somebody will need
to do is write up some simple instructions for getting to IRC from our various
environments to be able to attend Artemis meetings.
<p>
     We definitely want to be able to hold chats on MSN, but unless a lot of
the Artemis crowd signs up for MSN they may not happen too often...

I agree with Randall. IRC is the lowest common denominator, but easy to
use. There are a lot of neat things that can be done with MOO/MUSH/MUD,
but they all plaec a somewhat greater demand on users and a MUCH greater
demand on someone who is going to have to keep the cranky system running.
Unless we have a volunteer who is truly competent at M* wizardry AND
really wants to do it AND is no good for anything else :-)  I think we
should stick with IRC.
<p>
If that's the case, we need someone already conversant with IRC to grab a
brief set of instructions off the net, translate them to English, and keep
them available to participants.

[In the EC FAQ,] I would
certainly include something on joining the artemis-list mailing list,
switching to digest mode, that kind of thing.  Also pointers to where to find
the Artemis Project on the various online services would also be helpful.
Various references to the new ECTC web pages I'm currently setting up will
probably be useful as well, especially the task list for when people ask what
they can do to help.  I guess at this point it would be safer to include
details on only those areas we currently support, which is basically the
mailing lists, Web site, and GEnie.  You may want to include some references
to planned future additions, including Usenet newsgroups, other online
services, FTP server and archives, and real-time electronic meetings.  And I
almost forgot, definitely include a reference to sending general questions to
Nanci.

<h3>January 1996</h3>

    Nanci Brasket is currently the sole member of the Artemis Help Desk,
manning the Artemis Comm & Info Center.  Several discussions took place
during the month about putting in place an automated help desk environment
to handle an increased volume of questions in the future.  Those design
ideas were put on the <a href="taskinfo.html#helpdesk">ASI web site</a>,
but we are still looking for volunteers to research this area further.

<h3>February 1996</h3>

    Nanci Brasket answered numerous questions directed to the Comm and Info
Center.

<h3>March 1996</h3>

    Nanci Brasket answered numerous questions directed to the Comm and Info
Center.  Nanci also added five new images to the ASI image library and
edited a large number of new ADB web pages.

<h3>April 1996</h3>

    Nanci Brasket continued answering questions directed to the Comm and
Info Center.  Nanci also added eight new images to the ASI image library
and edited several hundred ASI web pages.

<h3>May 1996</h3>

    Nanci Brasket continued answering questions directed to the Comm and
Info Center.  Nanci also added thirty-nine new images to the ASI image
library and edited thirty-four new or updated ASI web pages.

<h3>June 1996</h3>

    Nanci Brasket continued answering questions directed to the Comm and
Info Center.  Nanci reorganized the Image Library index into separate
index files for each year.  She also added seventeen new images to the
image library and edited sixty-one new or updated ASI web pages.

<h2 align=center>Mailing List Server Comparison</h2>

The backbone of the Artemis Electronic Communications infrastructure is a
collection of topic-oriented mailing lists.  With the number of mailing lists
expected to grow to 80 to 100 and the membership of some of the lists expected
to be in the hundreds of addresses, the choice of mailing list server software
is critical to the efficient operation of the Artemis mailing lists.  With the
additional requirements for gateways to various other communication areas,
archive capability, digests, and other capabilities, the features provided by
the mailing list server software are extremely important.
<p>
To select the best mailing list server package for the Artemis mailing lists,
this document presents the results of an in-depth survey of the three leading
freely available mailing list servers:
<a href="ftp://cs-ftp.bu.edu/pub/listserv">
ListProc v6.0c</a>,
<a href="http://www.math.psu.edu/barr/majordomo-faq.html">
Majordomo v1.93</a>, and
<a href="ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail">
SmartList v3.10</a>.
Those three packages were selected from a much larger pool
of packages that were described in an excellent review of Listservers, called
the
<a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/news.answers/mail/list-admin/software-faq">
Mailing list management software FAQ</a>.  The software currently in use for
several Artemis mailing lists, MReply, was eliminated early due to it's lack
of several basic features needed for the Artemis environment, notably digest
and moderated list support and performance.  Two other highly-capable packages
reviewed in the Mailing list FAQ, CREN's ListProc and ListServ, were ruled out
because they are commercial products with fairly hefty annual license fees.
Both packages, however, have more features than the freely available software,
especially for supporting large or busy lists, so once the Artemis Project has
sufficient revenue it may be worth reconsidering those two packages.
<p>
The criteria that the listservers are judged on were those features provided
by one or more of the packages that are important to the nature of the lists
we will be running and the planned Artemis communications infrastructure.
Ideas for some of the criteria and some of the data came from the Mailing list
FAQ, the rest of the data came from the individual documentation files, FAQs,
and web pages for the individual listservers.  You can find those files
through the links for each package in the previous paragraph.  Here are the
results of the survey:

<p>
As described in the Mailing list FAQ, there are two philosophies behind
mailing list software: "big is beautiful" or "small is beautiful".  Majordomo
is a classic example of the "small is beautiful" type of program, relegating
much of it's functionality to external programs.  For that reason, at the
simplest level Majordomo does not support many of the features listed in the
comparison above, but with the addition of a collection of supporting tools,
it manages to get close to the other two packages in available features.
Assuming the use of Majordomo's companion programs, and if we were to use
Majordomo for the Artemis mailing lists, that would be virtually a
requirement, all three listservers are very close when comparing the
individual features, with a few notable exceptions.
<p>
Due to the plans for a large number of mailing lists (there are currently 80+
lists defined in the <a href="listserver-rqts.html">Listserver Requirements</a>
document) and the expected growth of several of the lists to several hundred
users (as artemis-list currently has), one of the key criteria for listservers
is how well they perform with large and busy lists.  An excellent in-depth
discussion of how each listserver handles mail queuing and incoming mail can
be found in the Mailing list FAQ.  I would strongly recommend that anyone who
is interested in this area read that part of the FAQ closely.  This is the
functional area where the three listservers differ the most.  Majordomo is
designed for handling a few small mailing lists, and apparently suffers from
major performance problems with large or busy lists.  Some of the performance
problems with large lists can be improved with an additional utility called
bulk_mailer, but the fact that Majordomo is an interpreted Perl script and
requires that Perl be started each time a message arrives is not easily
overcome.  There are rumors that future versions of Majordomo will
significantly improve the performance problems, but until that happens it
appears that Majordomo may not be able to handle the requirements of the
Artemis mailing lists.
<p>
Most of the other differences between the three listservers are minor.  One
potential problem with SmartList is that although it technically supports
remote list administration, a critical feature for the Artemis lists, the
commands to maintain a list apparently must be included in the message header,
something which many mail clients don't support.  SmartList has several
advantages, notably a very smart bounce handler, support for multiple
moderators, and what the authors of SmartList call "Natural language command
processing".  SmartList does incur a performance penalty for busy lists,
however, as a new copy of SmartList is started each time a mail message is
received.  Majordomo has no built-in mail loop checks, which could be an issue
when the listserver runs unattended for days at a time.
<p>
From a simple feature-by-feature comparison, ListProc seems to come out as the
best solution, with SmartList a very close second.  One potential issue with
ListProc is that the current version, 6.0c, is the last freely available
version, ListProc will no longer be updated except for bug fixes.  Over time,
other packages may surpass ListProc's features, although the commercial version
of ListProc, CREN's ListProc, seems to be leading the pack for now.

<h2 align=center>ECTC Listserver Mailing Lists Status Reports</h2>
<p>
<h3>January 1996</h3>

    Greg Bennett wrote up the <a href="/adb/09/03/listserver-rqts.html">
master list</a> of mailing lists and newsgroups
for all Artemis activities, which is now posted on the ASI web site.  Dana
Carson set up a new mailing list for the new Web maintenance team and
changed the name of the ECTC mailing list.  Randall Severy began research
into mailing list server software to select which one would be best for
the Artemis mailing lists.

<h3>February 1996</h3>

    A new mailing list,
<a href="mailto:asi-org-local@asi.org">asi-org-local</a>,
was created to support the local
Artemis chapters.  Randall Severy wrote the first draft of the
"<a href="/adb/09/01/ec-procguide.html">Electronic
Communication Procedure Guide for Artemis Technical Committees</a>", which
provides a set of instructions for setting up and using the different parts
of the ASI electronic communications infrastructure.  The draft document
can be found on the ASI web site from a link in the
<a href="/adb/09/01/ectc_tasks.html">ECTC task list</a>.  The
<a href="/adb/09/03/listserver-rqts.html">master list</a>
of mailing lists was updated with several additional planned
mailing lists.  Randall Severy completed the
<a href="/adb/09/03/listserver-comparison.html">review of mailing list server
software</a> (the review can be found on the ASI web site from a link in the
<a href="/adb/09/01/ectc_tasks.html">ECTC task list</a>),
which concludes that the Unix ListProc software would be
the best package to use for the Artemis mailing lists.

<h3>March 1996</h3>

    Three new mailing lists have been requested, one to handle
business-related discussions, another to handle the CD-ROM business
discussions that have been going on recently, and a third to support the
new Lunar Outpost Advance Planning Technical Committee.  If the ASI Domain
move takes place soon, those three lists will be set up on the new site,
otherwise they will be set up on the current site in the near future.

<h3>April 1996</h3>

    Since the ASI domain move has not yet taken place, we decided not to
wait on setting up several new mailing lists this month.  The
<a href="mailto:art-biz@asi.org">art-biz
mailing list</a> was set up to handle general business discussions about the
Artemis Project.  The <a href="mailto:art-biz-cdrom@asi.org">art-biz-cdrom list</a>
will handle those discussions
relating to the new CD-ROM project.  The Lunar Outpost Advanced Planning
Technical Committee now has their own mailing list,
<a href="mailto:art-moonbase@asi.org">art-moonbase</a>.  A new
mailing list, <a href="mailto:art-prop@asi.org">art-prop</a>,
is also now available for the Propulsion Technical
Committee.  The newly formed SSTO Concept Design Team can use the new list
<a href="mailto:art-ssto@asi.org">art-ssto</a> for their team discussions.
Information about joining any of
these mailing lists is available from the Mailing Lists web page at
<a href="/adb/09/03/mailing-lists.html">http://www.asi.org/adb/09/03/mailing-lists.html</a>.

<h3>May 1996</h3>

    Some glitches occurred with the new art-biz-cdrom mailing list that
were caused by bugs in the Listserver software, but the mailing list
configuration was quickly updated to avoid the problem and all of the new
mailing lists are up and running and becoming very active.  You can always
get the latest list of ASI mailing lists from the Mailing Lists web page at
<a href="/adb/09/03/mailing-lists.html">http://www.asi.org/adb/09/03/mailing-lists.html</a>.

<h3>June 1996</h3>

    A new list, <a href="mailto:asi-osf-leads@asi.org">asi-osf-leads</a>,
was added this month to provide a private
discussion group for the chairpersons of all of the OSF Technical
Committees and Project Teams.

Summary of Internet Site Organization</h1><p>Presentation of the Artemis Project's World Wide Web site is the majorconcern of this document; however since the data files to be used on WWWare part of the overall on-line presence of the Artemis Project, the scopeof discussion here includes other uses of the ASI domain on the Internet.</p><p>The primary criteria for design of the Artemis Project Internet sites are:</p><ul>  <li> 1. Provide the new visitor with an exciting overview of the project  <li> 2. Provide links to lead the visitor to get involved  <li> 3. Organize the site to make it easy to maintain and contribute</ul><p><a href="#top">Contents</a></p><a name="0101"></a><h2>1.1 Major Topics for the World Wide Web Site</h2><p>When someone first visits the site, we want to show what the project isall about, and get the visitor excited about the Artemis Project.  Think of it as atraining session.  Instead of lumping it all together in a mass ofentangled organizations and new ideas, we present it logically.  Thesite is arranged into major subject areas:</p><pre>                       Artemis Project                        Main Entrance                             |         --------------------------------------        |                    |                 |  Artemis Project     Artemis Society       Sponsors        |                    |                 |    Artemis            Organization          Sponsor   Data Book           Information         Information</pre><p><a href="#top">Contents</a></p><a name="010101"></a><h3>1.1.1  Artemis Project Main Entrance</h3><p>  The character of this page is tutorial and navigation.  It gives avery brief description of what the project is about and links to the othermajor subject areas.</p><p><a href="#top">Contents</a></p><a name="010102"></a><h3>1.1.2  Artemis Project</h3><p>  The character of these pages is tutorial and entertainment.  Here wefind the reference mission, the money story, and news about the ArtemisProject and the Lunar Base Development Fund.  If we have nifty littleprogram on line, such as one that shows what the Earth looks like from theproposed landing sites, they go here.  Descriptions of the promise of thefuture -- long-range space development -- go here.</p><p>  We don't talk about the Artemis Society or The Lunar ResourcesCompany here, except where we provide appropriate links for more in-depthinformation and how to get involved.</p><p><a href="#top">Contents</a></p><a name="010103"></a><h3>1.1.3  Artemis Society</h3><p>  The character of these pages is organizational and informational.These pages include the organizational structure, membership directory,techical committees, project teams, local chapters, Artemis SocietyInternational headquarters information, and all the other administrativeinformation needed to operate the Society.</p><p><a href="#top">Contents</a></p><a name="010104"></a><h3>1.1.4  Sponsors</h3><p>  The character of these pages is corporate and commercial.  Theinformation is a list of Artemis Project sponsors and links to thesecompanies' web sites.<p><a href="#top">Contents</a></p><a name="0102"></a><h2>1.2  Artemis Project Site</h2><p>Present an overview of the project.  The information presented here isdesigned to:</p><ol>  <li>Change the new visitor's impression that space travel is onlyfor big government programs<br><br>The most important issue here is cost and revenues, with technical and political issues being important secondary considerations.  Present a summary of the money story up front, with spacecraft illustrations as decorations.  <li>Excite the visitor's sense of wonder and sense of adventure, and  get him interested in thinking about space travel and space  development.<br><br>  Do this with lots of pictures of the moon and lunar bases, some  old Apollo pictures, and pictures of the Artemis Project  spacecraft.<br>  <li>Convince him that he can take control over his own destiny and fly in space himself.<br></ol><p><a href="#top">Contents</a></p><a name="02"></a><h1>2. Mechanics of Web Site Design</h1><p><a href="#top">Contents</a></p><a name="0201"></a><h2>2.1  Style</h2><p>The web site should be laid out in a series of short pages, each pagepresenting a major concept and advancing the plot.  Only the rawinformation pages such as personnel listings should be lengthy blocks oftext.</p><p><a href="#top">Contents</a></p><a name="020101"></a><h3>2.1.1  Presentation</h3><p>All tutorial pages are presented using a graphical banner depicting the small image of the Artemis Project half-moon logo.  Avoid use of embellishing graphics in the <a href="/adb/index.html">Artemis Data Book</a>, since these pages will be loaded frequently by people contributing to the project.</p><ul><li>We need a smaller version of the logo.  The gifs we have now take up too much space on the page to use as the header for each web page.<br></ul><p>At the bottom of each page is a navigation bar with links to the mainArtemis Project index, the catalog, etc.  The navbar also includes links tothe previous page.</p><p><a href="#top">Contents</a></p><a name="020102"></a><h3>2.1.2  Accommodation for Various Web Browsers and Slow Nodes</h3><p>WWW pages should be designed in general for an effective presentationof the information in text form, using graphics where necessary toillustrate the story we're telling.  Use a white background in the body ofthe document unless a specific set of web pages are designed to use othercolors for their entertainment effect.</p><p>Don't use background graphics unless the specific page requires it forentertainment effect.</p><p>Always provide a text alternative to images.</p><ul><li> Should we consider having an image-intensive and parallel image-light version of the web pages?  If so, we need to set up completely independent paths and page hiearchies.  We could use the same filenames in whole different set  of directories, and use links for pages that work in  either environment.<br></ul><p>Graphics are cool and really impress some folks, but until everybodyis communicating with the net faster than 28.8, we should show somesympathy for modem users.</p><p><a href="#top">Contents</a></p><a name="0202"></a><h2>2.2  Filenaming Conventions</h2><p>Consistently applied conventions for naming files will make it mucheasier to maintain the web site, especially as we expand the responsiblityfor various parts of it to include people all over the world.</p><p><a href="#top">Contents</a></p><a name="020201"></a><h3>2.2.1  Exclusive Use of Lowercase in File Names</h3><p>All directory and file names use lowercase exclusively; no uppercaseallowed.  This makes it easier for many people to work on maintaining andupdating the site.</p><p><a href="#top">Contents</a></p><a name="020202"></a><h3>2.2.2  Data Base of Images and Information</h3><p>Image and information files will be named according to their indexnumbers in the <a href="/images/index.html>Artemis Project Imagery library</a>.  Documents will be namedaccording to their document numbers in the Artemis Project DocumentationLibrary.  This makes filenames a bit unintelligible by themselves, but withlibrary indices will make it far easier to keep the documents organized inthe long run.</p><p>Electronic image files are stored on line in a common <a href="/images/index.html>/images directory</a>.  The file names reflect the image numbers like this:</p><pre>   asi199500043.gif       -- the original image   asi199500043r01.gif    -- a revision replacing the orginal   asi199500043r01.jpg    -- exact same image, different file format</pre><p>. . . where . . .</p><pre>     asi = designation for Artemis Society International    1995 = year the image was created   00043 = 5-digit serial number     r01 = indicates a revision serial number    .gif = file format</pre><p>The first time an image is stored, do not include the revision number in the file name.  Documents referencing an image will be coded to link to the basic file name, without a revision number.  </p><p>If the image is revised, the revised image will replace the original image in all documents which reference that image, according to the following steps:</p><ol>  <li>Rename the original image file as "...r00"  <li>Install the new image file as "...r01"   <li>Create a link from the original file name (no rev number) to the new revised file.</ol><p>Note that any variation on an image, whether it is cropped, resized, has color changes, or contains changes to the original image modified, counts as a revision.  Presentation of exactly the same image in different formats as gif, jpeg, or whatever, does not count as a revision.</p><p>Allowable formats for files are:<ul>  <li> .canv - Macintosh Canvas file format  <li> .cgi  - cgi scripts  <li> .cgm  - computer graphics method (vector graphics)  <li> .dxf  - another graphics exchange format  <li> .gif  - CompuServe graphics interchange format  <li> .html - html code  <li> .igs  - IGES international graphics exchange standard  <li> .jpg  - jpeg, jfif  <li> .mpg  - mpeg movie format  <li> .msw  - Microsoft Word format (generally, text files)  <li> .pict - Macintosh picture file format (vector + raster graphics)  <li> .ps   - Postscript document  <li> .qt   - Quicktime movies  <li> .sla  - stereolithographic format  <li> .rgb  - red-green-blue, or "raw" image format  <li> .tiff - raster graphics format (these are generally huge)  <li> .txt  - plain text files</ul><p>We will add to this list with future updates as required.</p><p>9 Jan 1996 Note: I changed the convention for the ".ps" extension to mean a Postscript document rather than an Adobe Photoshop document because this seems to be the convention I've encountered in all the NASA web pages.  We don't have any Photoshop documents in the library yet anyway; but it's likely we'll eventually have to add filenaming convention for Photoshop, too.</p><p><a href="#top">Contents</a></p><a name="020203"></a><h3>2.2.3  Date References in File Names</h3><p>Time-dependent files have dates appended to their file names in theform YYYYMMDD (that's year, month, day).  This forces them to be sorted indate order in a directory listing.</p><p> { TBD: There's probably a lot more to say about file names. }</p><p><a href="#top">Contents</a></p><a name="020204"></a><h3>2.2.4  Document Numbers in File Names</h3><p>Like the image library, the document library consists of seriallynumbered documents.  The standard for document numbers is "ASI cyynnnnrxx",where c is an organizaiton code, yy is the near, nnnn is a four-digitserial number assigned by the library, and rxx is a two-digit integerrevision number.</p><p>Note that each html file is itself an ASI document, and should haveits document number noted in a comment at the top of the document.</p><p>Filenames for documents are simply the document number with theappropriate extension added.  A hypen replaces the space in the documentnumber:</p><p align="center">asi-a950001r00.txt</p><p>To reference a library document in an html script, use a file namewithout a revision letter (a950001.txt).  That file is a link which pointsthe latest revision to the document.  This avoids having to rewrite otherscripts each time a document is changed; you only have to store the new revof the document and update the link to that file.  All html scripts whichreference the document will automatically follow the link to the updatedfile.</p><p><a href="#top">Contents</a></p><a name="03"></a><h1>3.0  Directory and File Organization</h1><p><a href="#top">Contents</a></p><a name="0301"></a><h2>3.1  Directory Organization</h2><p>All information on the ASI site is organized into subdirectories tomake it easier for many people to work on updating the information.  Thisalso allows for easily switching to a major update by switching links inthe main index pages.</p><p>Breaking out information into many subdirectories allows for access control on a topic-by-topic basis.  This accommodates having many people adding files while reducing opportunities for blunders and mischief.</p><p>Here's the basic directory tree.  Most of the information is stored in the <a href="/adb/index.html">Artemis Data Book</a>'s massive directory structure, but there are a few common library areas and other places that don't fit within the Artemis Data Book.</p><p>In all cases, "/" is the home directory for the web site.  This directory tree includes areas used for information exchange and libraries in addition to the World Wide Web files.</p><pre>     /                  -- main entry point     /adb               -- <a href="/adb/index.html">Artemis Data Book</a>     /adb/01/...        -- <a href="/adb/index.html">Artemis Data Book</a> sections     /artemis-list      -- archive of listserver messages     /asi               -- Artemis Society Top Index     /asi/board         -- Private area for Artemis Society BoD     /asi/docs          -- Artemis Society documentation library     /asi/tc            -- Artemis Society Technical Committees     /asi/tc/prop       -- Propulsion Sytems Technical Committee     /asi/tc/sim        -- Simulation Technical Committee     /asi/hq            -- ASI Headquarters     /asi/policy        -- Artemis Society official policies      /asi/pt            -- Artemis Society Project Teams     /asi/pt/hab        -- Lunar Base Habitat Project Team     /asi/pt/ltv        -- Lunar Transfer Vehicle Project Team     /bio               -- biographies of key personnel     /disc              -- discussion group archives (such as GEnie)     /forms             -- response forms     /images            -- Artemis Project Imagery Library     /infoex            -- Information Exchange directory (pass-through area)     /mov               -- movie library     /newgroups         -- newsgroup discussion archives     /snd               -- sound files (might as well plan ahead)     /sponsors          -- Sponsorship information and sponsor index     /sw                -- computer software library     /news              -- Artemis Project news and announcements     /usr               -- top-level directory for individual users</pre><p><a href="#top">Contents</a></p><a name="0302"></a><h2>3.2  Access Control</h2><p>All areas of the site have controlled access.  The Artemis Societywebmaster acts as site administrator for controlling access.</p><p>Generally, the web directories are set up for public read access only,and of course the personal directories are accessible only to theindividual owner and the site administrator.  Technical committeedirectories are accessible by the TC chairman, libraries by the designatedlibrarian, etc.</p><p>The only fully open directory is /infoex.  Its purpose is to be aconvenient way for Artemis Project participants to exchange binary files.Files submitted for the libraries would reside here until the librarianmoves them.</p><ul>  <li>Can we set up the /infoex directory so that there is public read and write access, but no privilege to get a listing of the files in the directory?  That way people would have to know the specific name of a file to retrieve it, which would help us control browsing and snooping.<br><li> I'm assuming we can recruit some librarians<br><li>Note that I'm assuming we can create individual access accounts for the librarians, technical committee chairmen, officers, etc.<br></ul><p><a href="#top">Contents</a></p><a name="0303"></a><h2>3.3  Sponsor Pages</h2><p>We don't normally provide a full web site for the sponsors.  Normallywe'd just provide links to their sites.</p><p>However, we should offer this service to sponsors if they are willingto pay the marginal cost of extra space, hits, and site maintenance.  Thisservice probably will be the least expensive way for a small company to geton the World Wide Web, which might increase the attractiveness ofsponsoring the project.</p><p>Note that we're working on providing a full-up commerce server on theTLRC domain, rather than the ASI domain.  Companies might want to use thatcommerce server.  The logic here is that the commerce server will requiregoing out for a large capital investment, so we'll have to do it as acommercial business.</p><p><a href="#top">Contents</a></p><a name="04"></a><h1>4.  World Wide Web Site Content</h1><p>The ASI domain web site is all about the Artemis Project and thetechnical, financial, and political challenges of making it happen.  Itencompasses all information about the Artemis Project except for the actualcommercial business that funds the project; we link over to the TLRC sitefor those things.</p><p>LRC will offer a tutorial on how to write business plans and discusscommercial business opportunities, so that we can keep the commercialbusiness separate from the Artemis Society's work.</p><p><a href="#top">Contents</a></p><a name="0401"></a><h2>4.1  Artemis Project Main Entrance</h2><p>The main index is at http://www.asi.org/index.html.  This is frontdoor to the whole project.</p><p>This page gives a very brief introduction, designed to pique thereader's interest.  It includes no reference to any commercial company,except in the navigation bar.</p><p>This file includes an index to the rest of the Artemis Project web site.</p><p>This is a single page with a flashy image of the moon and a sloganthat encompasses the project.  It's designed to fit onto a single screenwithout scrolling, which means the total information must fit into a box485 pixels wide by 320 pixels high, including the header graphics and thenavigation bar.</p><p> This is our chance to grab the visitor's attention.  It should loadfast, present some interesting text to read while the graphics are comingup, and make the visitor want to keep looking.</p><p> Design:</p><pre>      ------------------------------------------------------------------     |              [image: Artemis Project web logo]                   |     |                                                                  |     |               Welcome to the Artemis Project!                    |     |                                                                  |     |  Join our world-wide team's efforts to break open the frontiers  |     |  of space for everyone.

<H1>Web Pages Procedure Guide for Artemis Technical Committees
</H1>

<P>
This procedure guide explains how to create, review, modify, and
publish web pages. The procedures listed here apply to <I>all</I>
parts of the Artemis Project. This includes the Artemis Data Book,
all committees (technical and non-technical), all other committee
procedure guides, and any other information published on the Artemis
Project web site. It also includes a basic style guide for you
to follow when creating web pages for the Artemis Project. The
style guide is meant mainly to provide general guidelines for
publishing web pages. You don't need to use every single style
specified. The idea is to provide a consistent look and feel for
Artemis Project web pages.
<P>
Members of the Artemis <A href="/adb/09/01/ectc.html">Electronic Communications Technical Committee</A>
(ECTC) will handle the job of setting up the communications services
for individual committees and discussion groups, but once those
services are in place each committee or discussion group will
be responsible for managing and maintaining their use of the services.
This includes web pages.
<P>
Since the Artemis communications environment is still &quot;under
construction&quot;, this procedure guide will be updated from
time to time. So it's a good idea to check it regularly.
<H2>Web Pages - An Introduction</H2>

<P>
The Artemis Web Site is the primary source of information about
the Artemis Project and the Artemis Society. Each technical committee
or discussion group should have web pages on the Artemis web site
that describes that committee or discussion group, provides information
about joining the committee or discussion group, and shares completed
and in-progress work being done. To make it easy for people to
join a committee or volunteer for specific tasks, you can set
up web forms to automatically send e-mail to someone on the committee.
Committees can also include current membership information and
current project information on the web pages as well. For an example
of some committee web pages, look at the <A href="/adb/09/01/ectc.html">ECTC web pages</A>.
<H2>The Web Page Publishing Process</H2>

<P>
Publishing web pages includes the following steps:
<UL>
<LI>setting up/Writing the web page
<LI>submitting the web page for a technical and editorial review
<LI>formatting the web page, if this isn't already done
<LI>submitting the web page for <B>final </B>review by the ASI
Board of Directors
<LI>publishing the web page in the Artemis Data Book
</UL>

<H3>Setting Up Web Pages</H3>

<P>
Setting up a web page involves designing, writing, inserting links,
and submitting the web page, or web pages, to the web team for
review. When creating a web page, use the style guide listed later
in this procedure guide. You can either send ASCII text documents
about your web page to the ASI Web Team at <A href="mailto:asi-web@asi.org">asi-web@asi.org</A>,
or you can create the actual web page yourself using an HTML editor,
them submit it to the ASI web team. If you create your own web
page, make sure it conforms to the ASI style guide as much as
possible.
<P>
If you send ASCII text documents, include the following information
about your web page:
<UL>
<LI>links to your new web pages - People browsing the web site
will only find your web pages by following links from other pages.
You should specify one or more existing web pages containing links
to your new pages.
<LI>links to the appropriate technical committee directory, which
can include:
<LI>a description and Purpose of the Committee or Discussion group.
<LI>the current membership list (if you want that information
published).
<LI>graphics, in either .GIF or .JPG format. If you plan on using
any Artemis-approved graphics, such as the &quot;Artemis&quot;
moon on the Artemis Project home page, you should get those graphics
from the Artemis graphics directory. Contact the ASI Web Team
for more details.
<LI>project information, such as which tasks are completed and
which are in progress
<LI>task lists, so viewers can see what tasks need to be done
<LI>information for web forms to join the committee and/or volunteer
for tasks:
<UL>
<LI>specify the e-mail address to send form submissions
<LI>if using a volunteer form, specify a list of tasks to use
for a choice list
</UL>

</UL>

<H3>Submitting the Web Page for Review</H3>

<P>
Once you complete your web page, submit the web page to the head
of your task committee, who reviews it along with someone from
the ASI Web Team. The person(s) reviewing your web page varies,
depending on which committee you're on and the content of your
web page. The review time can also vary for the same reasons.
If there is no task committee, or if the task committee chairperson
is not yet selected, just submit your web page to to the ASI Web
Team at <A href="mailto:asi-web@asi.org">asi-web@asi.org</A>.
<P>
After you make the technical corrections to your web page, the
ASI Editorial Staff does an editorial review. In this review,
our copyeditors &quot;markup&quot; your web page, send back style/formatting
changes to you, then review your corrections. The copyeditors
make sure that your web page meets the general web page styles
outlined in this procedure guide. This verifies that the web page's
original intent and logical flow has been preserved through the
editing process.
<H3>Formatting the Web Page</H3>

<P>
This step involves creating the HTML version of your web page.
Once your web page is reviewed and corrected, the ASI Web Team
converts the web page content to HTML format for final review
by the ASI Board of Directors. This may take some time, depending
on your web page's content and work schedules of the ASI Web Team
members building your web page.
<P>
If you've already created the HTML version of your page, it goes
to the ASI Board of Directors for final approval.
<H3>Submitting the Web Page for FINAL Review</H3>

<P>
The ASI Board of Directors has the FINAL say on all web pages
published at the ASI Web Site. At ths point, a Board of Directors
member reviews your web page with its final corrections. Or the
Board of Directors delegates someone on the appropriate committee
to do the final review and make his/her recommendations to the
Board. Once the board makes its decision, the ASI Web Team contacts
you to let you know whether or not the Board approved your web
page.
<H3>Publishing the Web Page</H3>

<P>
The ASI Web Team publishes your just-approved web page to the
ASI Web Site in the appropriate directory. For example, if you're
on the ECTC and your page deals with ECTC issues, your web page
is published in the ECTC directory.
<H2>Web Page Publishing Style Guide</H2>

<P>
This section lists the styles you should use in creating a web
page for the ASI Web Site. Keep in mind that this style guide
is meant to provide general guidelines. You need not use every
single style listed here since every web page's content may vary.
Using this style guide:
<UL>
<LI>makes the ASI Web Team's job easier (and yours!) for reviewing
and updating your web page.
<LI>gives the ASI web pages a consistent look and feel.
</UL>

<P>
This style guide will change as different situations arise, so
be sure to check this page regularly for style guide updates.
If you have any questions or concerns, drop a line to the ASI
Web Team at <A href="mailto:asi-web@asi.org">asi-web@asi.org</A>.
<P>
When developing your web page with the styles listed here, keep
these tips in mind:
<UL>
<LI>Follow a normal essay or technical paper format.
<LI>Use an Artemis Data Book (ADB) page as a format guideline.
<LI>Use active voice in your writing with simple words. If a 5-cent
word does the job, don't use a 10-dollar word! You don't want
to come across as talking down to web page visitors.  Nor do you
want web page readers to scratch their heads wondering what you're
saying.
</UL>

<H3>Title</H3>

<P>
Use the Heading1 style found in Word's Internet Assistant. This
text is 18pt, bold, Times New Roman font.
<H3>Header Styles</H3>

<P>
Use Heading2, Heading3, and Heading4 styles for subheadings in
documents. The style descriptions are:
<UL>
<LI>Heading2 - 16 pt, Times New Roman, no bold or italic, left
justified.
<LI>Heading3 - 14 pt, Times New Roman, no bold or italic, left
justified.
<LI>Heading4 - 12 pt, Times New Roman, no bold or italic, left
justified.
</UL>

<H3>Body Text Styles</H3>

<P>
Keep paragraph text in Times New Roman font, 10pt, left-justified.
Use ACTIVE voice in writing your text, and include as many links
within your text as you can. Don't just list a special section
for web page links; make it easier for readers to link to information
by putting links in your document. If you want to emphasize something
in text, avoid using all caps. Using Bold or Italic (or both)
is just as effective.
<P>
Also, remember to keep the page background white to keep it consistent
with the rest of the Artemis Project pages.
<P>
For link text, make the colors BLUE for links, PURPLE/MAGENTA
for visited links, and RED for active links.
<P>
If listing members of the Artemis Project, include:
<UL>
<LI>the person's name.
<LI>the committee he/she serves on OR his/her title. If you're
listing the committee, include a link to that committee's web
page, or to that committee's task list.
<LI>the e-mail address in parentheses. This should be linked.
<LI>the web page address (if available). This should also be linked.
</UL>

<P>
For example,
<P>
Gregory Bennett - Director, Office of Space Flight (grb@asi.org)
<P>
John Peel - member, ECTC Technical Committee (jpeel@netcom.com)
<H3>Graphics</H3>

<P>
Use .GIF or ..JPG format files. They can either be linked or unlinked.
<H3>Lists (Numbered and Bulleted)</H3>

<P>
Use numbered lists if you're describing a particular procedure,
such as how to contact the Artemis Society, how to join a particular
task committee. You can also use numbered lists to indicate order
of importance. For example, if you're describing the five most
important features of a spacecraft system and wish to list them
in order of importance (1=most important, 5=least important),
a numbered list is the way to go.
<P>
Use bulleted lists if the order of items in a list does not matter.
Also, when using bulleted lists, don't use initial caps. Items
listed in bulleted lists tend to be phrases instead of complete
sentences, so using initial caps would be gramatically incorrect.
<H3>Footers</H3>

<P>
The page footer should contain links to other Artemis pages, as
shown at the bottom of this page. The footer should also contain:
<UL>
<LI>copyright symbol and date, such as Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis
Society International. You should also include the trademark statement:
</UL>

<P>
<A href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">The Artemis Project</A>,
is a trademark of <A HREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar Resources Company</A>.
<UL>
<LI>the web page author - this is you.
<LI>update date -- the date the page was last updated
</UL>

<H3>Information File Contents</H3>

<P>
You should create an information file (.info) for your own records.
You can also send the ASI Web Team a copy of this file for their
benefit, but it's mostly for your records. The file can be an
ASCII text file and should list the following information:
<UL>
<LI>author -- the author of the web page
<LI>description -- a 50-word description of the web page.
<LI>maintainer -- who maintains the web page
<LI>update date -- lists dates and descriptions of revisions
<LI>responsible technical committee -- the technical committee
or technical committee representative that will review your page
<LI>copyright info -- if any is listed. Include the standard ASI
Copyright, which appears at the bottom of this page. It's also
a good idea to include a copyrght statement with the name of the
web page author.
</UL>

<P>
***** CURRENTLY THIS SECTION IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. MORE DETAILS
WILL FOLLOW SOON! THANKS FOR YOUR PATIENCE. *****
<H2>World Wide Web Conversation Pages</H2>

<P>
The Artemis World Wide Web Conversation Pages are not yet implemented.
Once they are, the conversation pages will be a set of web pages
that provide full access to the discussions going on in the various
mailing lists of the Artemis Project. You will be able to read
previous mailing list messages from these web pages and you will
be able to submit new messages to the mailing lists from the convenience
of a web form. We're also currently evaluating IRC on the web
for realtime online conversations/meetings. We'll keep you posted
of the latest changes.
<P>
To find out what's going on and how you can help implement this
capability, check out the <A href="/adb/09/01/ectc_tasks.html#webserver">Web Server section</A>
of the <A href="/adb/09/01/ectc_tasks.html">ECTC Task List</A>.

<h2 align=center>ECTC World Wide Web Server Status Reports</h2>
<p>
<h3>January 1996</h3>

    Greg Bennett updated the draft copy of the ASI
<a href="/adb/09/04/02/asi-site-design.html">Internet Site Design
document</a>, which is available on the ASI web site.  Greg Bennett, Randall
Severy, Simon Rowland, Nanci Brasket, Dana Carson, and several others have
updated and created numerous web pages on the ASI web site.  A new team,
the Artemis Web Maintenance Team, was formed to handle updating and
maintaining the Artemis web site.  Led by Dana Carson, the Artemis
Webmaster, the team is responsible for receiving web page updates and new
contributions from other Artemis members, reformatting the documents to
match the style of the ASI web site, and updating the web server with the
new documents.  If you have updates to any ASI web pages, or have some new
documents that should be put on the web server, either as text or HTML
documents, send them to the Web team at
&lt;<a href="mailto:asi-web@asi.org">asi-web@asi.org</a>&gt; and they will be
put on the web server.

<h3>February 1996</h3>

    Russ Myrick took on the daunting task of organizing and updating the
<a href="/adb/09/04/02/asi-site-design.html">ASI Internet Site Design</a>
document.
Numerous additions to the ASI web site
were made this past month, with a variety of new ADB pages contributed by
Simon Rowland.  Nanci Brasket started compiling a list of ASI web pages and
began the difficult task of tracking down who is responsible for each page.

<h3>March 1996</h3>

    The
<a href="/adb/outline.html">Artemis Data Book</a>
(ADB) on the ASI web server had a large amount of
new content added this month.  Simon Rowland has spent the last few months
digging through the archives of the artemis-list mailing list and many of
the past discussions are now summarized on ADB web pages, thanks to Simon.
Simon has also started an effort to gather more ADB material from the
Artemis community, so the ADB should continue to grow at a fast rate in the
near future.
<p>
    Two new tasks were added to the
<a href="/adb/09/01/ectc_tasks.html#webserver">Web Server section</a> of the
<a href="/adb/09/01/ectc_tasks.html">ECTC task list</a>
this month.  The first task is a result of some recent private
discussions on overhauling the ASI web server
<a href="/">home page</a> to provide a better
"front door" to the project that attracts and retains visitors to the site.
No one has stepped forward yet to volunteer for this task, so if you have
some good graphics and layout design skills, please step forward!  The
second task is for someone to coordinate the layout and content of the
Artemis Data Book on the ASI web site.  As a major contributor to the ADB,
Simon Rowland was a natural fit for the role, and fortunately he
volunteered for the task immediately.

<h3>April 1996</h3>

    The Artemis Data Book (ADB) on the ASI web server has grown by an
exponential amount this month, thanks to the almost single-handed efforts
of Simon Rowland, the ADB "book boss".  Simon has finished going through
the artemis-list mail archives for material for the ADB, and has just
started on the GEnie archives, which should provide lots of new material
for the ADB.
<p>
    The task that was started last month to overhaul the ASI web server
home page saw a lot of activity this past month as an extremely active
discussion about the home page occurred on the ECTC mailing list.  To focus
the discussion on a specific target, the team has agreed on the end of May
as the target date for completing the design of the new "front door".  If
you have any ideas or suggestions in this area, please don't hesitate in
passing them on to the ECTC at
<a href="mailto:asi-ecomm@asi.org">asi-ecomm@asi.org</a>.
We are still looking for
a volunteer to coordinate the brainstorming and design efforts for the home
page, so if you are interested (you don't even have to know anything about
HTML) let the ECTC know as soon as possible.

<h3>May 1996</h3>

    Simon Rowland continued his almost single-handed attempt at growing the
Artemis Data Book (ADB) exponentially each month, with a large number of
new updates added to the web site.  The concentrated design effort that was
started at the beginning of the month to develop a new ASI home page saw an
enormous amount of effort by a large portion of the ECTC during the month.
Randall Severy put together a strawman test page early in the month and the
entire ECTC pushed, prodded, and molded the page until by the end of the
month it met the approval of most of the people who worked on it.  The
exact textual content of the page and the images assigned to the "buttons"
on the page still need to be finalized, but that effort should be completed
in the next few weeks and soon afterwards you should see an announcement
about the new "facelift" for the ASI web site.
<p>
    The large number of updates that have been occurring on the ASI web
server has strained the abilities of the current web site maintenance staff
to keep up with the flood of changes.  Since all of the current updates
involve a very manual and labor-intensive process involving several people,
a discussion ensued in the ECTC about developing an automated Web Site
Maintenance System that could be used to reduce the workload needed to
maintain the web site.  This system would be based on some kind of database
on the web site that would keep track of updated pages as they moved
through the copyediting, technical approval, and style editing phases of
the web maintenance process.  Using web forms backed by Perl or C programs,
this system would elimate much of the duplicate, error-prone, and manual
updating that is currently done.  If you have any experience with systems
of that type, or would like to learn, let the ECTC know as soon as
possible.
<p>
    Simon Rowland set up a series of web forms to allow people to join and
volunteer for work in several new Technical Committees that are being
formed.  Randall Severy wrote the Perl scripts to support those forms.
Candace Dicks developed a group of web forms and Perl scripts to allow
people to join different project teams within the Office of Space Flight.

<h3>June 1996</h3>

    The Artemis Data Book (ADB) continued to grow at a rapid pace, thanks
to the undaunted efforts of Simon Rowland (now that school is out for the
summer, we may *really* be in trouble!).  The new ASI home page is almost
completed and is waiting for Greg to recover from Artemis '96 to put the
finishing touches on it.  Randall Severy put together a prototype of the
ASI Web Management System and the overall design of the system was
discussed at Artemis '96.  John Peel started an outline of the Web Page
procedure guide, which should show up on the web site in the near future.
Dale Amon set up an account and web space on his server in Ireland in
preparation for becoming a mirror site of the ASI web server.

<h2 align=center>ECTC WWW Conversation Pages Status Reports</h2>
<p>
<h3>January 1996</h3>

    Some initial research into software that will support WWW conversation
pages was done, and is available on the
<a href="taskinfo.html#webconv">ASI web site</a>, but no further work
has yet been done in this area.

<h3>February 1996</h3>

    No progress to report this month.

<h3>March 1996</h3>

    No progress to report this month.

<h3>April 1996</h3>

    Randall Severy has done some additional research into available tools
to support web conversation pages.  Despite the lack of an integrated
mailing-list interface, HyperNews seems to be the best candidate for our
needs and appears to be the most popular non-commercial solution currently
available on the web.  The actual implementation of this capability is
currently waiting for the ASI domain move.

<h3>May 1996</h3>

    No progress to report this month.

<h3>June 1996</h3>

    Brad Ackerman started researching potential tools for implementing Web
conversation pages and decided on the HyperNews system from NCSA.  Brad is
now waiting for the upcoming move of the asi.org domain to begin installing
and configuring the web conversation environment.

<h3>January 1996</h3>

    Dale Amon has begun research into creating a new newsgroup hierarchy
for the Artemis project.  The latest consensus is that putting the artemis
newsgroups under sci.space would be too unwieldly for what we need, so the
latest plan is to create a new artemis.* hierarchy.  Dale has begun talking
to several news administrators about carrying the new hierarchy and has put
together a draft structure of the new hierarchy.  Randall Severy did some
initial research into software that will support automated mailing list to
newsgroup gateways, and the results are available on the
<a href="taskinfo.html#newsgroups">ASI web site</a>, but
a lot more work still needs to be done in that area.

<h3>February 1996</h3>

    No progress to report this month.

<h3>March 1996</h3>

    No progress to report this month.

<h3>April 1996</h3>

    No progress to report this month.

<h3>May 1996</h3>

    No progress to report this month.

<h3>June 1996</h3>

    Dale Amon restarted his efforts in planning the Artemis newsgroups.

<p>
<h3>January 1996</h3>

    Nanci Brasket created a <a href="/adb/09/06/01/genie.html">web page</a>
on the ASI web site that describes the
Artemis presence on GEnie.  We hope to have similar pages for the other
on-line services soon.  Candace Dicks talked to some sysops on America
OnLine about setting up an Artemis "message board".  Mark Barbisan talked
to some people on MSN about setting up an Artemis presence there.  Since
Mark is leaving MSN, he has turned over the information he gathered to the
new Artemis rep on MSN, Doug Cross.

<h3>February 1996</h3>

    The Artemis presence on GEnie took a major hit with the recent major
change in pricing under GEnie's new ownership.  Greg Bennett and several
other Artemis members decided GEnie's new pricing was too much now that the
Artemis Project has essentially moved to the Internet and have cancelled
their GEnie accounts.  Attempts are being made to work out an arrangement
with GEnie's new owners to keep the official Artemis account active on
GEnie so that the Artemis presence can continue.  On CompuServe, Vik
Olliver recently received information on starting a new forum for the
Artemis Project.  On MSN, a request to add an Artemis icon to the Astronomy
and Space Forum was denied.  Efforts are underway to identify what options
exist for an Artemis presence on MSN.

<h3>March 1996</h3>

    Vik Olliver received some information from the local contact for
CompuServe about establishing a forum for the Artemis Project on
CompuServe.  A discussion about those options then occurred on the ECTC
mailing list, but no plans were finalized so there has been little progress
beyond the initial discussion.  Candace Dicks has asked for someone else to
take over the role of coordinating the Artemis presence on America OnLine
now that she is very busy as the Administrator of the Office of Space
Flight Technical Council.  If any of you have access to AOL and would be
interested in coordinating our efforts to provide Artemis Project
information on AOL, let me know.

<h3>April 1996</h3>

    Chris Eason, in his new role as Artemis AOL contact, contacted the
OMNI Magazine Online Editor about setting up an Artemis area in the OMNI
forum on America OnLine.  If that plan is approved, and it looks promising,
several key Artemis documents will be made available in that forum and a
direct link will be established to the ASI web server.

<h3>May 1996</h3>

    Vik Olliver passed on several discussions from the Spaceflight forum on
CompuServe to the artemis-list mailing list.  Chris Eason began classes to
learn the software used on America OnLine to manage objects in a forum in
preparation for maintaining an Artemis area in the OMNI Forum.

<h3>June 1996</h3>

    Vik Olliver found several newsletters on CompuServe that could be good
places to put references to the Artemis Project when our publicity campaign
gets going.

<h3>January 1996</h3>

    David Brummel is working on putting together an overview of how his
mailing list to BBS system works and how FidoNet and BBSs work as well.
That document will be posted on the ASI web site as soon as it is
available.

<h3>February 1996</h3>

    No progress to report this month.

<h3>March 1996</h3>

    No progress to report this month.

<h3>April 1996</h3>

    David Brummel wrote up a description of the gateway he runs between
several Artemis mailing lists and the FidoNet BBS network.  The
<a href="/adb/09/07/fidonet-info.html">description</a>
is available on the ASI web site.  Jim Nobles began exploring the
possibility of setting up a link between the Artemis mailing lists and the
RIME BBS network.  His <a href="/adb/09/07/rime-info.html">description</a>
of the proposed gateway is also
available on the ASI web site.

<h3>May 1996</h3>

    No progress to report this month.

<h3>June 1996</h3>

    Marvin Ostrega volunteered to look into additional connections to
bulletin board systems.

<h3>January 1996</h3>

    Some discussions took place early in the month about the different
environments available for real-time meetings, and those discussions are
posted on the ASI web site.  Beyond that, nothing has been done in this
area, and we are still looking for volunteers to do additional research.

<h3>February 1996</h3>

    No progress to report this month.

<h3>March 1996</h3>

    No progress to report this month.

<h3>April 1996</h3>

    No progress to report this month.

<h3>May 1996</h3>

    No progress to report this month.

<h3>June 1996</h3>

    Brian Cesar and Brad Ackerman did some research on various options for
holding Artemis real-time meetings and settled on IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
as the most promising environment to start with.  A discussion in the ECTC
mailing list about public vs. private IRC servers led to the plan to first
set up Artemis "channels" on existing IRC networks, with the future option
of setting up our own IRC server on asi.org's new home.  Brian and Brad are
working on a Real-Time Meetings procedure guide that will include
instructions on getting set up to access an IRC server and how to join
real-time Artemis discussions.

<p>
<h3>January 1996</h3>

    Tom Hopper is working on an Electronic Communication FAQ, and that
document will be posted on the ASI web site as soon as it is ready.

<h3>February 1996</h3>

    Joe Strout put together a
<a href="http://www-acs.ucsd.edu/~jstrout/asi-news/">first draft</a>
of a "What's going on in ASI" web
page, but is still waiting for submissions to put on the page.  He sent an
initial request for contributions to the artemis-list mailing list, but the
responses were underwhelming (Come on, folks, doesn't *anyone* have any
news to report?).

<h3>March 1996</h3>

    No progress to report this month.

<h3>April 1996</h3>

    Tom Hopper worked on a basic outline for the EC FAQ.

<h3>May 1996</h3>

    A discussion took place within the ECTC early in the month about
collecting historical and statistical records about the Artemis Project
electronic communications infrastructure.  That discussion led to the
creation of a new ECTC task to establish a database for those records.
Doug Cross promptly volunteered to set up such a task and started a
follow-up discussion to identify exactly which pieces of information to
keep track of.

<h3>June 1996</h3>

    Doug Cross started collecting usage data from the ASI web site for a
database that will be able to provide historical and statistical records
about the Artemis Project electronic communications infrastructure.

<P>These propellants might actually freeze (freezing point is 261K for
N<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>O<FONT SIZE=1>4</FONT>, 220.7K for MMH), but
a tiny heating coil would be a trivial addition. Other than that, they
are much easier to store than the LH<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>/LOX propellant,
and their tankage will occupy a smaller volume.</P>

<H3>Further Work Needed:</H3>

<ul>
<li>Detail hypergolic engine<br>
Should work with cryogenics as well, for use in the descent stage
<li>Calculate cryogenics boiloff, total fuel required
<li>Calculate <a href="/adb/04/03/09/composite-tanks.html">tankage</a> masses
<li>Determine <a href="/adb/04/01/01/mission-timeline.html">storage</a>

Such as insulation, heating, leak control, etc.
<li>Determine approximate risk for both systems
<li>Determine overall cost for both systems<br>
Such as cost of materials, cost of getting the extra mass to the lunar

<h2 align="center">1. Project Overview</H2>
<h2 align="center">Basic Overview of the Artemis Project</H2>
<I><P ALIGN=CENTER>Greg Bennett</P></I>
<P><HR><P>

<P><a href="/asi_index.html">Artemis Society International</a>, a
non-profit foundation managing a project to
establish a permanent,
self-supporting lunar base as a private venture, needs
your help.  To learn what this is about, explore the WWW site at:</p>

<P align=center><a href="http://www.asi.org/">http://www.asi.org</a><BR>
and speak to our Comm and Info Center,<BR><a
href="mailto:artemis@asi.org">&lt;artemis@asi.org&gt;</a></P>


<H3>Very brief overview of the Artemis Project:</H3>

<P>The initial stages of the <a href="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a>,
up through establishing the
permanent lunar
base, are funded by <a href="/adb/03/04/">revenues</a> derived <a
href="/adb/03/04/revenue-breakdown.html">mostly</a> from the entertainment value of
space flight.  The spacecraft are built using commercial aircraft standards and
procedures to reduce the cost.  This provides a modest <a
href="/adb/04/02/03/">habitat</a> on the moon and
leaves the <a href="/adb/04/02/01/ltv-notes.html">transportation system</a>
in orbit.</P>

<P>At that point, the project is in the black.
We've learned that it's not a question of <a href="/adb/j/too-risky-for-investors.html">whether this approach will work</a>, but how long it will take.  The more effective we are in building a <a href="/asi_index.html">participating team</a>, the faster we get
there.  If everything goes right (it won't), we could land the first permanent <a href="/adb/04/02/03/">habitat</a> within eight years.</P>

<P>Anticipated growth paths from the <a href="/adb/04/">initial lunar
base</a> include supporting
scientific investigations and exploration, <a
href="/adb/04/03/10/04/oxygen-extraction.html">lunar industries</a> (and their support to other space industries), and  tourism.  The largest <a href="/adb/03/04/long-term-funding.html">revenue producer</a>
among these probably will be <a href="/adb/02/07/02/01/lunacity-hotel.html">tourism</a>.</P>


<H3>What's going on:</H3>

<P><a href="/asi_index.html">Artemis Society International</a> is a <a
href="/asi_member.html">membership</a> organization with <a
href="/adb/07/local-chapters.html">local chapters
and representatives</a> in  
Australia, Canada, France, Great Britain, Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden,  
and the United States.</P>

<P>At the leading edge of this effort is the Society's <a
href="/adb/09/01/ectc.html">Electronic Communication
Technical Committee</a>.  They are just now developing <a
href="/adb/09/overview.html">communication tools</a> toenable a team spread out around the world to work together productively.</P>

<P>On the <a href="/index.html">WWW site</a> you'll find the outline for
the <a href="/adb/">Artemis Data Book</a>, which
organizes all the plans and information related to all aspects of the program.
The Artemis Society's <a href="/adb/06/07/">technical committees</a> and <a
href="/adb/06/08/">project teams</a> are working on the
sundry parts of the program.</P>


<H3>How you can help:</H3>

<P>You'll find a rather long list of "<a
href="/Things_You_Can_Do.html">things you can do</a>" online.  A very
broad range of skills, talents, and resources are needed to make the project
happen; it's a lot more than building and flying
spaceships.  I suspect most interested parties would be interested in
helping fill in the technical blanks in
the <a href="/adb/">Artemis Data Book</a>.  You might also want to help with the organizational work, or participate in the <a href="/adb/03/04/">revenue-producing</a>
side of the project.</P><H3>Why you want to help:</H3>

<P>If the project is successful, it will establish an economic environment where
commercial interests are able to conduct business profitably on the moon and
elsewhere in cislunar space.  That provides a stable <a
href="/adb/03/03/building-financial-base.html">economic foundation</a> for
the resources needed to do whatever you want to do on the moon at the least
possible cost.  Steady continuous development in space is assured, independent
of changing <a href="/adb/03/05/">political</a> environments.</P>

<P>Since the success of the program depends on an <a
href="/adb/07/local-chapters.html">international team</a> to get things
started in many different arenas, several <a
href="/adb/03/royalties-for-volunteers.html">inducements</a> are designed into the program to reward early participation.  For example, all else being equal, priority for use of the available resources will be assigned to indviduals in numerical order by <a href="/asi_index.html">Artemis Society</a> membership
number.  In other words, it won't work to wait and show up eight years from now to help us take the cookies out of the oven.</P>


<H3>What the Artemis Project is not:</H3>

<P>The Artemis Project is not a government program.  Like any corporate entity, governments may be <a href="/adb/10/">program participants</a>, suppliers, or customers;
however, some restrictions on government participation are necessary to maintain the basic character of the project.</P>

<P>The Artemis Project should not be confused with the Common Lunar Lander project that NASA conducted for the Space Exploration Initiative a few years ago, or the European Space Agency's standard satellite program.  It is also not affiliated with the companies who make watches, intimate apparel, medical equipment, or program scheduling software, or several thousand Greek restaurants and other <a href="/adb/03/05/trademark-artemis.html">"Artemis" businesses</a> around the world.</P>

<P>Finally, the <a href="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a> is not a forum for social engineering.  The project is focused on the single goal of establishing a self-supporting, permanent lunar base.  Social causes and politics are kept out of the program, except as necessary to achieve the moon base goal.</P>

The major changewas to move the paragdigm shift to the very beginning, even before theArtemis Project title slide.</P><P>The flow went like this:</P><ol><li><B>Government space to commercial space</B><BLOCKQUOTE>Start with this because you have to deal with concept shock.People think of space as a big, expensive government thing.<P>Graphic: NASA's historical budget, from 1962 to 1996.<P><img src="/images/asi199600026.gif"><P>Discussion: "If they can land a man on the moon, why can't theyland a man on the moon?"  NASA budget looks like a going-out-of-business curve.  U.S. government is bankrupt; it's not going tostart any major new space development programs within our lifetimes.  Official NASA policy (see the NASA web sites) is thatthe public concept of the glory of Apollo is a dilemma (their word)to be solved; it was a one-time political situation not likely torecur.  A socialized space program isn't going to work any betterthan any other attempt at establishing a socialist economy; thisdecade has taught us how effective socialism works.  In short,government ain't gonna do it, and there's no reason to believethey will.  If it's going to get done, we have to do it ourselves;and for the program to continue, it has to be done as commercialenterprise.</BLOCKQUOTE><li><B>The Moon is the Front Door to the Universe</B><BLOCKQUOTE>Graphic: Shopping list of how the moon is the place to start,no matter where you want to go.</BLOCKQUOTE><li><B>"Moonbase Artemis" title slide</B><img src="/Gifs/artlogob.gif" align=right><BLOCKQUOTE>Given that situation, we put this program together.</BLOCKQUOTE><li><B>Reference Mission</B><BLOCKQUOTE>This is what we're doing.</BLOCKQUOTE><li><B>You can go, too.</B><BLOCKQUOTE>. . . and this is where we're going.<P>Graphic: Commercial SSTO.<P><img src="/images/asi199600031.gif"><P>Discussion: Overview of Your Vacation on the Moon.</BLOCKQUOTE><li><B>How Much it Will Cost</B><BLOCKQUOTE>At Norwescon, I used the convention as an example of the amountof effort required.

can! We'll show you how!</B></P>

<P>[An illustration of the lunar landscape as seen from your room at the <a
href="/adv/02/07/02/01/">Luna City Hotel</a> is just what we need here. We
explain later what the viewer is looking at by repeating the image.]</P>

<P>Hit 'em right up front with the number one concept shock:</P>

<P align=CENTER><B>YOU CAN GO, TOO!</B></P>

<P><LI><B>The government isn't going to do it</B> [NASA budget image],
but...</P>

<P align="CENTER"><img src="/images/asi199600026.gif" width=230 height=165
alt="NASA Budget Graph"><P>

<P>The risk here is that seeing NASA's budget is very threatening to NASA
fans, and especially to NASA personnel. It's also very unpopular with NSS
leadership because it shows rather dramatically how effective they've been
in stumping for an expanded government space program.</P>

<P><LI><B>We can do it ourselves!</B></P>

<P>And you can be a part of it! (This, in story-telling parlance, is
called "foreshadowing the plot." Just make the claim and leave it at 
that. You'll deliver on the promise later.)</P>

<P><LI><B>The moon is the front door to the universe.</B></P>

<P>No matter what you want to do in space, the best place to start is the
moon. So we're making that first step.</P>

<P><LI><B>This is what we're doing.</B> [Reference mission]</P>

<P><li><B>This is how we pay for it.</B> [Money story]</P>

<P>Don't hit them too early with the economics. They get bored. Once they
have a solid vision in mind, then they'll be interested in how we're going
to pay for it.</P>

<P><LI><B>This is how the Artemis Project leads to YOU traveling to the
moon.</B></p>

<P align="CENTER"><img src="/images/asi199600032.gif" width=384 height=256

<P>(The rockets-to-the-moon story, with the economics of <a

<P><img align=right src="/Gifs/artlogob.gif" alt="Artemis Project

Artemis Society, commercial companies, and spaceship builders]</P>

<P>I don't mention <a href="http://www.tlrc.com/">The Lunar Resources
Company</a> until I get to this point. A company is "something somebody
else does" while the Artemis Society is something everyone in the audience
can do.</P>

Bennett</I></P><P><HR><P><P>There are a couple of unique aspects to the <ahref="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a> that make this projectdifferent from what we, the body of space activism, have done before.</P><P>For one, the Artemis Project is designed to be a <ahref="/adb/03/01/revenue-breakdown.html">profit-making</a> enterprise fromthe <a href="/adb/04/01/01/01/">first launch</a>.  For two decades we'vetried wheedling the government to do it, and we've tried the beggingapproach.  That didn't work.  But we've never really tried to use theeconomic power of the entertainment industry and do it as show business.(Which is all space travel means to Joe Sixpack anyhow; and Joe is our mainaudience.)  We've even flirted with the megaprofits-in-the-long-runapproach, but business isn't set up for that kind of long run.</P><P>The other difference is that we can pump current spacecraft designexperience into the project.  Folks often leap into designing spaceshipsonly to be daunted by the detailed design work.</P><P>And finally, we have people with experience in both the commercialaerospace industry and the way the government does it.  Without experiencein both arenas, people just don't realize that spacecraft don't need to beas expensive as they are today.  All the cost models are based on thehistorical costs of space programs instead of looking at how much of thatmoney is spent on maintaining the fixed assets and infrastructure inherentin a government operation.</P><P>For emphasis: I'm not NASA-bashing.  After almost 20 years at JSC Istill don't have any great ideas how any government agency could avoidthose costs.</P><P>Actually, the Artemis Project is benefitting greatly from the work theReturn to the Moon campaign is doing.  They're knocking down politicalroadblocks that a year ago really worried us.</P><P>Incidentally, lots of times folks have suggested to me we should all gettogether behind one space project, but I disagree.  Artemis fills in aniche between the Space Access Society and Return to the Moon's lunarprospectors, and the Mars and space colonies enthusiasts.  (These are allprojects I enthusiastically support.)  I don't see any gain in spendinganother two decades trying to get organized when we're actually doing greatthe way we are.  We're finally <I>doing</i>&nbsp;something instead of justtalking about it!</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sat, Apr 15, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

<H2 ALIGN="center">1.2 Vision of the Artemis Project</H2>
<H2 ALIGN="center">Missions to the Asteroids</H2>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P>


</P>
<P>While an asteroid mission is outside the scope of the Artemis Project's goal
of establishing of a self-supporting lunar base, it does fit within the
long-term vision.  Among the themes we've developed to explain what the
<A HREF="/index.html">Artemis Project</A> is all about is: &quot;The moon is
the front door to the universe.&quot;  This brief essay helps explain what we
mean by that.</P>
<P>Can asteroid missions be made financially viable?  The Artemis Project might
be the key to balancing that equation.  Consider:</P>
<H4 ALIGN="center">LTV for Asteroid Rendezvous Spacecraft</H4>
<P>With some modification for a months-long flight, the Lunar Transfer Vehicle
would be well-suited to an asteroid rendezvous.  The modifications would involve
reliable life support for a long-duration mission, addition of an airlock for
EVA sorties on the asteroid's surface, and radiation protection for the
crew.</P>

<H4 ALIGN="center">Spacecraft Launch from the Moon</H4>
<P>If we can launch oxygen tanks on an electromagnetic launcher from the moon,
we can send them to asteroids.  Other planets, too.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="center">Lunar Resources to Support the Mission</H4>
<P><A HREF="/adb/04/03/10/04/">Oxgyen</A> for rocket fuel is an obvious start.
 If we get a metals industry going on the moon, we can build the heavy structure
needed for an asteroid recovery mission.  Besides fuel tanks, asteroid recovery
will require a long trusswork with heavy magnets to support an electromagnetic
accelerator.  (That assumes we want to move the asteroid by using its material
as reaction mass for an electrically powered rocket.)  The lunar community can
get into full-scale production of solar cells (lots of silicon up there) and
mirrors, which will be used to power these electric rockets.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="center">Consumer of Asteroidal Materials</H4>
<P>Carbonaceous chondritic and water-ice asteroids add a lot of missing
ingredients to the recipe for life of the moon.  If we find that metals can be
mined more cost-effectively from asteroids than from lunar sources, lunar mining
companies would be an eager customer.</P>
<P>Bringing asteroidal material to Earth's surface could be tricky, if not
impossible.  We would have to use the material in space or figure out a way to
control the flight of an asteroid through Earth's atmosphere without making a
mess.  Crash-landing an asteroid on the moon, in contrast, would have a trivial
environmental impact.</P>
<P>A gravity field and local resources make the surface of the moon a much more
attractive site for heavy industry than free space.  So, if we have customers
for these heavy industries, the moon will be a major manufacturing power in the
next century; and hence a customer for these materials.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="center">Proving Ground for Spacecraft and Crew</H4>
<P>If you want to test out an asteroid-bound manned spacecraft, the place to do
it is on the moon, with nice, safe habitats nearby if something goes wrong.
Shuttling crews between the surface of the moon and a lunar-orbiting deep-space
craft is far easier than getting to LEO from Earth's surface.</P>
<P>In conquering the moon, we will develop most of the systems needed for
missions to asteroids and beyond.</P>

<P></P>
<HR>
<P>

</P>
<P>People frequently wonder what our facilities might look like in the  future.
How far in the future shall we look? Picture this, about 100  years hence, give
or take a few decades...</P>
<P>On Earth, we'd have a group of 50-story office buildings; rather dramatic
architecture with atrium lobbies; lots of arches in the decor to reflect the
geometry one sees in crescent moons and circular craters. Six floors of this
office complex are dedicated to spacecraft development and operation; the others
are the home of the supporting industries.</P>
<P>Surround the office buildings with a large parking lot -- perhaps covered
parking and lots of trees. Out back we have an enormous industrial facility,
connected to the office buildings with enclosed walkways or underground tunnels.
Maybe three classic high-bay buildings built together, with a smaller office
building attached. Big doors roll up at each end of the high bays. Has to be
near transportation routes, clear access to the Interstate highway system, and
to a major airport we can fly a Superguppy into.</P>
<P>There's an <A HREF="/adb/04/05/02/01/">antenna farm</A> somewhere around
here, some big, fixed dishes pointed to geosynch but at least three 20+  foot
diameter dishes on maneuverable mounts, pointing at the moon and our  spacecraft
in transit.</P>
<P>On the moon we have a collection of pressure vessels mostly covered with
moon dirt. Some of them -- the biolabs -- are in a sunburst pattern like the
spokes of a wheel linked to a circular node. The wheel is a series of concentric
rings, each ring half transparent and half opaque.</P>
<P>All these things are connected on the surface by a system of pressurized
tunnels, and underground by a few more tunnels. Not too many tunnels
underground; tunnelling through the lunar rock is going to be a chore so we'll
probably opt for surface tunnels protected by piles of moon dust. Maybe a few
domed gardens, and some domes that look like a  hemisphere on top of a cylinder.
Those domes are actually full spheres, with garlands of regolith bags hanging
over the side.</P>
<P>A mile or so away is the spaceport: several circular pads distinctly marked
with circles and cross-hatches to make the target very visible to pilots when
they land. These are connected by roadways, a uniform dark gray color made from
the regolith.</P>
<P>The lunar community is separated from the spaceport by a shield wall made of
concreted regolith. Some control towers poke their heads over the top of the
shield wall, and next to the wall are storage facilities -- warehouses, y'know;
big airlock doors with tracks leading up to them.</P>
<P>Vehicles, lots of vehicles: cylinders with hemispherical ends on big, big
wheels; some <A HREF="/adb/04/02/05/04/">robots</A> and unpressurized rovers.
Some of the vehicles are involved in exploring the moon, and  others in
<A HREF="/adb/02/03/">mining the regolith</A>; but at the  moment the majority
are devoted to the construction of the first mass-driver <A
HREF="/adb/02/10/">launcher</A>.</P>
<P>Opposite the spaceport, hidden around the edge of a natural mountain range
formed by the remnants of an ancient crater, is the
<A HREF="/adb/04/03/03/power-source-comparison.html">power station</A>. This
is a collection of solar panels, with solar dynamic engines surrounded by
fields of mirrors that reflect sunlight to a central heat engine. Power lines
run from the generator stations into an artificial cave where we've hidden the
power storage facility. Inside that cave we find rows of large spherical tanks
filled with hydrogen and oxygen. The gasses cycle back and forth through fuel
cells that charge and discharge each lunar day and night.</P>
<P>Now for the good part: somewhere in the lunar community with lots of tunnels
leading into it is a large transparent dome. A maneuverable sun-following mirror
dominates the interior of this dome. A 40-foot-wide circular shaft descends
vertically from that dome, down more than half a mile where it abruptly ends in
the roof of a huge cave. The shaft is a bit off center where it contacts the
roof of the cave; we missed.</P>
<P>That big mirror reflects sunlight down into the shaft. Long rectangular
mirrors, arranged in a wedge, disperse the raw sunlight where it enters the cave
at the bottom end of the shaft.</P>
<P>More shafts are under construction up and down the tube.</P>
<P>The cave is a bit irregular, a long snaking cylinder averaging 350 feet in
diameter. Its roof and walls undulate a bit, and have lots of  tiny little pits
in them, but the floor is quite flat. Instead of being spherical, its cross
section has a bit of a tear-drop shape. Unlike Earth caves, there's hardly any
dust in this lava tube; nothing to make dust. Some stalactites have formed,
hanging from the ceiling. Water tends to drip from them.</P>
<P>The cave isn't quite horizontal; its floor slopes gently away. There are
lots of fissures leading away from it. The low end of the cave is plugged by a
wall of cold lunar lava; the high end breaks up into a labyrinth of smaller
caves and fissures. We've filled the low end with water, forming a large
underground lake. There are other lakes here and there, where water has gathered
in depressions in the cave floor. Little streams run down from the sides and
high end of the cave.</P>
<P>Electric light fixtures, rank after rank of flourescent tubes, hang from the
ceiling.</P>
<P>The landscape is mostly irrigated fields and a few wild forests growing in
clumps here and there. Trees are huge, oaks a couple hundred feet tall. Some
folks have chosen to live in tree houses, and fly to work and play from their
balconies. The main underground city is just beneath the first shaft. The
buildings are light, airy structures made from lunar concrete and metal. The
city is mature enough that we're beginning to see some variation in
architecture. A few single-family dwellings dot the landscape.</P>
<P>Everywhere you look, you see plants, even downtown. Each building is
designed to support terraces of planters. Rooftops are cultivated into gardens
and savannahs. There are lots of citrus trees; we have a somewhat tempered
subtropical climate going in here.</P>
<P>Traffic is mostly small pedal-powered or electric aircraft, with some roads
for electric cars and foot traffic. People get around with a skippity-hop
motion, gliding along the roads and pathways.</P>
<P>And somewhere in all this, either in the surface community or down in the
underground city, or in one of those vehicles out exploring the moon, is your
place.</P>

Folks in the back of the room are so excited that they do noteven realize they are jumping from one foot to the other.  They have beenstanding for the past two hours, ever since the crew moved into the landingstack to take her down.</P><P>     The spacecraft is just around the limb of the moon over the far side.Abruptly, mission control picks up a relay through the Lunar TransferVehicle as it orbits just ahead of the landing stack.</P><P>     "Hey Earth!  We're back with ya through the LTV," the missioncommander says.  His voice is startlingly clear through the radio link."Coming down right in the groove.  You should be getting some video ofLobachevsky Crater right about . . . now!"</P><P>     The main viewing screen springs to life.  A huge crater dominates thelunar landscape.  In the black sky above the crater are the words: LIVEFROM THE MOON.  Other monitors flash scenes from around the world.  Yourealize that billions of people from all corners of the earth are sharingthe experience with you.  They crowd into mission support centers like theone you are in, and into theaters, malls, parks, auditoriums, andclassrooms.  You can spare just enough of your attention to marvel at somany human minds directed toward this one goal: the return of human beingsto the moon for the first time in nearly forty years.</P><P>     And this time, we're going back to stay.</P><P>     "Here we go," the commander says.  "Hetz Crater.  That's the one inthe middle of the chain.  We'll get back out here to explore that area nextyear."</P><P>     A skinny red-haired girl quietly slips onto the step beside your seat.You don't even notice her until she nudges your elbow and whispers, "Howlong?"</p><P>     She couldn't be more than twelve, just about ready to start thinkingseriously about puberty.  From the stains and worn spots, you get thefeeling that her Moonbase Artemis T-shirt is her favorite garment.</P><P>     "About ten minutes.  Watch the TGO display.  That's 'time to go'."Your own whisper sounds too loud in the hushed room.  Nobody is talking.Their eyes never wander from the big monitors hanging overhead.</p><P>     When you look toward the girl next to you, you notice she is not theonly person sneaking a seat in the aisles of the auditorium.  You shoot anervous glance toward the fire marshall, worried that he'll be shooingpeople to the back of the room to keep the aisles clear, but even he isunable to spare any thoughts for the crowd.</P><P>     On the monitors, the vast, dark plains of Mare Marginis unfold beforeyou.</P><P>     "Wave at Mr. Goddard as we fly past, folks!"  The commander isreferring to Robert Goddard, the father of American rocketry.  Images ofGoddard and his early gasoline-powered rockets flash onto the informationscreens.  A large crater on the northern rim of Mare Marginis honors hismemory.</P><P>     You are one of the Veterans, one of the few who have been with theproject since the beginning.  Perhaps later you will feel guilty abouthaving a front row seat while all those people have to stand, but for now,there is only the moon.  Your hard work and diligence earned you this seat.</P><P>     The dark basaltic plains of Mare Marginis slip out of view, to bereplaced by rolling hills.</P><P>     "There's Cannon Crater, right on time," the commander says.  "We'regoing to roll for the final approach.  Hey, there's a great view from theinside cameras now.  Take a look through the porthole!"</P><P>     It looks like a short boot; dark soil surrounded by the silver gray ofthe surrounding hills.  Mare Anguus, and Angus Bay.  The goal.  Home.Beyond, the ragged rim of Mare Crisium.  The dark terminator cuts acrossthe shining, sable carpet of the Sea of Crises, hiding her secrets for daysto come.  It is just past sunrise at Angus Bay.  In the sky above, MotherEarth.  You are seeing yourself, from a viewpoint a quarter million milesaway.</P><P>     The commander stops his chatty narrative.  He is feeding information tothe pilot.  "Looks like we're headed right for the central peak of thatcrater there.  Veer just a bit to the right.  Yeah, head for the rim.  OK,bring her down.  Fifty feet.  Hey, there's some dust, just like Buzz saidthere'd be!</P><P>     "OK, Earth, we picked our spot and we're hovering at twenty feet toyaw into position."</P><P>     As the spacecraft turns, the porthole camera sweeps the landscape.  Itcomes to rest showing a path of dark, smooth terrain leading out into thevast reaches of Mare Crisium.  Soon people will be following that path,seeking out the treasures lurking in the soil of the dusty plain.</P><P>     "Spot on," the commander says.  "Earth is perfectly centered in theframe.  Let her down.  Ten feet . . . five . . . contact light!</P><P>     "Earth, Angus Bay here!  Artemis has landed."</P><P>     You strain to hear what clever bon mot he will have to say about thereturn to the moon, but his voice is drowned out by a fusillade ofchampagne corks.  No worry, you will hear it again and again on the newsand in the documentaries.</P><P>A fellow comes by with a rack of glasses and bottles to fill them --champagne and soda pop, both festooned with the labels of Proud Sponsors ofthe Artemis Project.  When you reach for a glass, you realize your hand isstill captive in both of the red-haired girl's hands.  The realization hitsher at the same time and she snatches her hands away.  You smile, and liftyour glass to her in a toast: a toast to new beginnings.</P><P>It has begun.  This time, for keeps.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sat, Oct 12, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

<P></P>
<HR>
<P>

</P>
<P>As seen from a given point on the moon, Earth will wobble in a box that
measures plus or minus 7.7 degrees east to west (longitudinal libration), and
6.7 degrees north to south. The longitudinal libration is due to the elliptical
orbit of the moon about the earth, and the latitudinal libration is due to the
inclination of the moon's axis to the plane of its orbit.</P>
<PRE>      Lunar equator is tilted 1 deg 32 min from the ecliptic
      Lunar equator is tilted 6 deg 41 min from its orbital plane
      Orbital plane is titled 5 deg  9 min from ecliptic

                  (these figures add up to make the first numbers)

</PRE>
<P>To put this into perspective: Earth subtends an angle of about 2 degrees in
the lunar sky, so it's moving roughly 3 times its diameter away from a mean
point.</P>
<PRE>
                       -7.7    North   +7.7
                          -------+-------   -- +6.7 deg
                      W  |           ()  |  E
                      e  |     mean      |  a
                      s  +       +       +  s
                      t  |     Earth     |  t
                         |               |
                          -------+-------   -- -6.7 deg
                               South</PRE>
<P>Earth subtends an angle of about 1.9 degrees, as seen from the moon.  So if
you imagine a circle formed by the parentheses in the diagram above, it's
approximately to scale.  Earth will slowly move within this box over a 28-day
cycle.  The box will be tilted depending on your latitude on the moon.  At the
equator, it's rolled over 90 degrees.  At the poles, it's as I've shown it here.
 At other lunar latitudes, the angle of tilt will be ( 90 - latitude )
degrees.</P>
<P>To keep an antenna bore-sighted on Earth, it would have to slew the rate of
about 1/2 degree per day.  We'd want the antenna to cover the whole 2 degrees of
Earth to allow for continuous coverage from horizon to horizon.  Of course,
people at a given location on Earth would be able to receive the signal for half
of each Earth day.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Reception Times</H3>
<P>Sometimes we'd get prime time in a given city; sometimes not. Programming
could be adjusted for the cities along the strip of longitudes that will receive
the signal in prime time.  Advertisers in Chicago would pay more for a
commercial spot at 7 PM than at 3 AM.  That's OK; when it's 3 AM in Chicago it's
7 PM in Sydney, so our programming will be about what's up at the Opera House
instead of how well the Cubs could play baseball on the moon even though people
in both of those cities would be receiving the signal.</P>
<P>Note that this situation, with the moon halfway between Sydney and Chicago
when it's 7 PM in Sydney, occurs at a specfic phase of the moon.  Moon
aficianados on Earth will learn to tell the phase of the moon based on what kind
of programming is coming to them, and vice versa.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Earth-tracking Techniques</H3>
<P>The easiest solution to tracking Earth would probably be to calculate its
position, but if we want a stand-alone antenna guidance system to point an
antenna, we could use a radio direction finder.  Earth is radio-noisy across all
the bands, so it should be very easy to close the guidance loop on radio
signals.</P>
<P>Infrared should work, too.  Earth is a very hot body against a very cold sky
except during a terrestrial eclipse.</P>
<P>During an eclipse, it would be easy to find the limb of the Earth occulting
the disk of the sun up to totality.  During totality, use the camera to find the
body occulting the solar corona.  I'll bet Earth looks really pretty during a
total eclipse, with the sunlight refracting around the atmosphere to form a ring
of fire.  The <A HREF="/adb/02/07/lunacity-hotel.html">Luna City Hotel</A> will
likely be booked up decades in advance for those events.</P>

<HR>
<P>

</P>
<P>Little has been said about the future politics of the moon colony because it
is rather like picking the kitchen curtains before we've built the house.
However, it has been brought up, so here goes...</P>
<P>Frankly, treating the lunar colony as an independent state is the only way
it will work.</P>
<P>Citizens of <A HREF="/adb/07/local-chapters.html">many countries</A> are
already participating in this project to some extent: Australia, Canada,
Ireland, England, France, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Russia, Japan, New Zealand,
and the United States.  The only sovereign claim the U.S. could make is that
most of the commercial firms involved are U.S. corporations, but not all --
don't forget that from the very beginning Manticore Productions leaped in with
both feet to sponsor <A HREF="/adb/07/local-chapters.html#Canada">Artemis
Canada</A>.  We plan to expand to a world-wide market long before we launch the
first spacecraft, so you can bet we will have corporate participants in all
those countries and many others.</P>
<P>Among the viable options for how we accomplish the project is to launch
spacecraft whose structure was built in Italy, electronics in Japan, cameras in
Germany, and rockets and other systems in the United States, on a booster from
Russia lifting up out of Brazil or Australia.</P>
<P>The Lunar Resources Company is incorporated in Texas, which by treaty is one
of the United States; but Lunar Resources is only the project integrator.  If
for some reason the state or federal government were to do things that inhibit
our corporation from participating in the project (and I don't see any reason
why they'd want to), there are people in other states and other countries who
can leap in to fill the void.</P>
<P>How could any terrestrial nation claim sovereignty over the lunar
community?</P>
<P>Nations can tax businesses within their territorial boundaries and to some
extent regulate the behavior of their citizens no matter where those people are
with threats of punishment when then get home.  But picture this: a few years
from now I sit down to lunch at the Luna City Hotel's bistro with Eric-Axel
Zimmer and Kurt Gunter.  What country can claim ownership of that territory?
The U.S., because I was born in Kansas?  But Kurt is from Australia, and _three_
countries can take credit for Eric -- U.S., Canada, and Belgium!  Okay, so we go
for countries of residence, in which France grabs a piece of the table, too;
Eric lives in Paris.</P>
<P>Now, Ecuador might claim ownership of the moon (since it passes over their
territorial boundaries) and because of that claim forbid the sale of any lunar
resources, but all they'd accomplish is to deny their citizens the bounty of
extraterrestrial resources.</P>
<P>As has been quoted before: &quot;It is useless for sheep to pass resolutions
in favor of vegetarianism while wolves remain of a different opinion.&quot;</P>

<h2 align="center">Artemis Data Book</H2>
<h2 align="center">1.2 Vision of the Artemis Project</H2>
<h2 align="center">Purpose of the First Mission</H2>
<P><HR><P>

<P>The goals of the first mission are to:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Establish a permanent habitat
<LI>Leave the transportation system in space
<LI>Demonstrate that private enterprise can do manned space flight
</OL>
<P>We're hoping we'll also be able to have the crew assay the site and do
some exploring on the first mission, so the next crew will know what to bring
with them.  If we have some weight margin, a small pilot plant for processing
lunar soil to <a href="/adb/04/03/10/04/oxygen-extraction.html">extract its
oxygen</a> is a high priority.  Processing other
volatiles and even smelting metal using solar power are also high priorities,
even if these are only tiny little experiments no bigger than a briefcase.</P>

<P>Very high on the priority list is to leave the <a
href="/adb/04/02/05/04/">telerobotic capability</a> in
place so that the mission can continue after the first crew has come home.
The crew might have to do some refurbishment work on the robot, replace
batteries or solar panels, clean off dust (if they can), or erect a shelter
for the robot.</P>

<P>Of course, if the science community would like to sponsor scientific
goals for the mission, we'd be more than eager to accommodate their desires.</P>

<P>The permanent habitat becomes the exploration base and construction
shack for the next flight, where we get down to serious work.  Since the
second crew will already have a habitat waiting for them, they can carry more
industrial and exploration equipment.  Mining, materials processing, and
finding lava tubes are all urgent.</P>

<P>It's not inconceivable that the first flight could earn enough money to
pay for one or more subsequent flights, but the entertainment value of this
venture will diminish until both the lunar base and LEO transportation systems
reach the point where <a href="/adb/02/07/lunacity-hotel.html">lunar
tourism</a> is economically viable.  So we need to
demonstrate as early as we can that we are able to build habitats on the moon
and fly people there using commercial aerospace standards and practices.</P>

<P>If we can do that, and the LEO transportation system comes together, we
should be in a position to seek real capital to fully develop <a
href="/adb/02/07/lunacity-hotel.html">lunar tourism</a> as
an industry.  That reduces the cost for everybody, and planetary scientists
will find that a field trip to the moon is reasonable.  A stable business --
any stable business -- will open the floodgates; it's all uphill from there.</P>

<P>Ultimately we want to see a thriving spacefaring community.  Besides
<A HREF="/adb/04/02/05/04/">digging up moon dirt</A> and <A
HREF="/adb/02/02/">separating</A>
out the good stuff, that includes <A HREF="/adb/02/06/">people living</A> on
the <A HREF="/adb/02/01">moon</A>, in <A HREF="/adb/02/06/">space</A>, on
space stations (or colonies, if they're feasible), building powersats (if
they're feasible), <A HREF="/adb/01/02/asteroid-mission-notes.html">mining
asteroids</A>, building communities on Mars, <A HREF="/adb/02/05/">exploring
the outer planets</A>, conducting exploration and scientific research in all
these environments, and doing whatever it is people want to do.</P>
<P>There are a host of options from which to choose.  The path we take in
development of a lunar base to achieve that grand vision is not well-defined.
However, we don't have to narrow down that field right now. We have sufficient
information to define the basic requirements for the core of a lunar base.  No
matter what path we take, the initial lunar base must:

<P></P>
<HR>
<P>

</P>
<P>A lot of manned space development studies have been read in research for the
<A HREF="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</A>, but as far as we know, this is the
first time anyone has put together a cogent story with a solid business plan
that doesn't depend on the government or a sugar daddy bankrolling the space
flight.</P>
<P>It is true that we will be seeking investors for the entertainment
industries, but even that might be less than we expect as we bring on board
existing entertainment companies as participants in the project. Incidentally,
we're open to proposals in any arena; always will be.</P>
<P>Several major factors distinguish the Artemis Project from all those
previous ideas:</P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<LI>Current state of technology has advanced to the point that we can get the
initial lunar base on the moon without investing a lot in new technology
development
</LI>
<LI>Treating the project as completely private enterprise, including use of
commercial aerospace engineering practices instead of modeling it after a
government program
</LI>
<LI>The promise of opening space travel to the general public makes it relevant
to nearly everyone's life
</LI>
<LI>Directly addressing the fact that space travel is nothing more than a form
of entertainment for most people; and realizing that the economic power of the
entertainment industry far exceeds the aerospace industry
</LI>
<LI>Willingness to set aside altruism in favor of shameless commercialism to
get the job done
</LI>
<LI>Willingness to start small and grow, instead of planning a program that
leaps from where we are today to a huge research facility on the moon
</LI>
<LI>Opening the project itself for everyone who wants to help, and developing a
way to apply skills and talents besides just spacecraft engineering and
political lobbying to getting it done
</LI>
<LI>Incorporating all industries in our business plan, rather than
concentrating on just one segment or new technology idea
</LI>
<LI>Establishing up front that no social causes of any kind will be allowed to
be part of the program
</LI>
<LI>Inviting the whole worldwide space community to participate
</LI>
<LI>Actively avoiding building the project around a central personality
</LI>
<LI>The Internet

Scenarios for Manned Space Development</H2><h2 align="center">The Carousel Farm</H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Gregory R. Bennett</I></P><P><HR><P><P> Our exploration base will need a bioregenerative life support system,which leads to farming on the moon. Initally, we will build our farm onthe surface. Here we explore a concept for such a farm.</P><P> </P><H2>The Farm</H2><P><IMG SRC="/images/asi199600129.gif" ALT="Top View of Carousel Farm"HEIGHT=269 WIDTH=289 ALIGN=LEFT>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thegeneral layout of the pilot farm is a torus, with the farm built on <B>floatingbarges</B>. Part of the inflatable torus is transparent to sunlight, andthe rest is shaded to provide a night cycle. <B>Water pumps</B> slowlymove the barges in a circle, so that each plant is exposed to sunlightfor 12 or more hours at a time.</P><P>The illustration shows the farm divided evenly between day and night,but the transparent window could cover more than half of the torus. Northernplants, at the latitude of Washington State for example, are used to only5 hours of night in the middle of the summer. That's when they do mostof their growing. <B>Wheat</B> thrives in that kind of growing season,while <B>corn</B> does better in the middle of the temperate zone wherethe summer nights are about 6 hours long.</P><P>The cross-section shows the day side of the farm. The pool serves asa <B>water reservoir</B> for the whole moon base. We float the farm onbarges, which move along with a lazy current of water from submerged electricpumps. <B>Sprinklers </B>overhead water the plants.<IMG SRC="/images/asi199600130.gif" ALT="Cross Section of Carousel Farm"HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 HEIGHT=264 WIDTH=272 ALIGN=RIGHT></P><P>During the lunar night, <B>electric lamps</B> provide partial sunlightto keep the plants going. The lamps don't have to be powerful enough toprovide the full intensity of sunlight because earth plants are used tocloudy days, and these plants will experience very direct sunlight duringthe lunar day. We will cover the exposed section during the lunar nightto prevent heat loss.</P><P>We can <B>tend the plants telerobotically</B> from the earth with afew robot manipulators. The manipulators need not be mobile because wecan wait for the plants to rotate within range of the manipulators. Thateliminates a lot of mechanical complexity in the system, hence eliminatingmany failure modes for the machinery.</P><P><B>Floating the farms</B> gives us the most power-efficient system wecould have for moving the farm beneath the sunlit (and electrically lit)section of the farm. The only moving parts we need to worry about are thepumps, telerobot manipulators, mechanism for covering the farm at night,and valves for water and nutrients. We might also use some large, steerablemylar reflectors to reflect sunlight into the windows when the sun is lowon the lunar horizon.</P><P>I used a <B>toroidal shape for this inflatable pressure vessel </B>toreduce the weight of the water. We could fill the bottom of a sphere anduse essentially the same design, but that would require a much larger volumeof water. Alternatively, we could build a circular barge canal inside agiant sphere, but that requires a lot more construction for the structureof the canal. With a torus, we can use our dirt-mover robot to shape acircular trough and then lay the inflatable directly into that trough.The underlying regolith provides all the structural support we need anddistributes the load evenly. This allows for a lot of tolerance in theconstruction of the system, which will be important for systems which willbe operated and maintained telerobotically.</P><H2>Animals in the Ecosystem</H2><P>We could add some animals to establish a complete ecosystem, but I'mnot so sure about controlling the population of animals until the baseis permanently manned. Getting a <B>balance of herbivores and predatorsin a an ecosystem</B> this small could be really tricky, perhaps not evenpossible, unless the predator is intelligent enough to know when the timehas come to cull the herbivore population. If we just let a couple rabbitsor small deer loose in there, they would over-populate the farm, eat allthe plants, and die off within three or four generations. Farming on thisscale will be much more difficult, and much more risky, than it will bewhen we can find one of those gigantic lava tubes and fill it with a terrestrialatmosphere.</P><P>We might be able to do it with <B>fish </B>in the water tank, though.Perhaps, as with the evolution of life on earth, we should start our littleecosystem with an aquarium and add land animals as the whole system expands.</P><H2>Transportation </H2><P>The amount of mass we will have to ship up from earth would be non-trivial,even for a relatively small farm. The pressure vessel will not weight much,but the farm also will need <B>carbon dioxide</B> for the carbon cycle,<B>anhydrous ammonia</B> for nitrogen to feed the plants, and of course<B>hydrogen</B> to make the water. All these elements exist in the lunarregolith, but only in scarce quantities. We would have to move a lot ofmoon dirt to get enough trace volatiles to run this farm, so we probablywill have to ship up most of these elements from Earth.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Mon, Nov 11, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

Scenarios for Manned Space Development</H2><h2 align="center">Life on Luna for the Disabled</H2><P><HR><P><P>One spinoff industry of the Artemis Project and lunar development isallowing a significant fraction of the population in first-world countriesto liquidate their terrestrial assets for transportation and permanentaccommodations on the Moon. In other words, colonization.</P><P>The benefit of lunar living for the handicapped is a strong argument fordoing this. Life would be so much easier in 1/6-g for those afflicted bymuscular dystrophy or polio, or physical injuries that paralyze the legs.</P><P>Imagine what it would be like to live in a house where you can't reachthe upper kitchen cabinets from your wheelchair. Now think of how muchnicer life would be if you could just pull yourself up there withyour hands and use all the space around you.</P><P>1/6-g will be better than zero-g, especially for someone with adisease like cerebral palsy. It won't hurt if you fall down and stairs areno longer a nightmare.  Another bonus is that in 1/6-g, objects remainstationary instead of floating away.</P><P>Despite the strain of a multiple-g launch, people would undoubtedly livelonger in a low-gravity environment. Those with a lifetime of accumulatedwealth to dispose of may very well spring for a home on the moon, completewith an extra decade of life.</P><P>It's a bit of a social cause, but if we can create a niceliving environment and provide a way where one can get there at reasonableexpense, this one benefit would make the whole project worth doing.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Mon, March 11, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

<P>Building satellites on the moon and put them into Earth orbit from there,
rather than launching them from the ground, is a possibility for lunar
manufacturing being considered. This could be a significant revenue source
for the lunar base in the long term.</P>

<P>From the standpoint of energy, it's much cheaper to get a satellite
from the moon to Earth orbit than from the ground. One promising near-term
in-situ launcher technology is an aluminum-oxygen hybrid system.</p>

<P>Whether the money required is greater or less depends on where we are on 
the timeline for lunar development. If we're already in the <a
href="/adb/04/03/10/04/oxygen-extraction.html">oxygen business</a> then
providing fuel for the satellite would be considerably less expensive, and
we'd already have a launch system in place to get those oxygen bottles to 
Earth orbit.</P>

<P>Building the satellites themselves is still another question. That can 
be a labor-intensive operation. Except for <a
href="/adb/m/08/08/hydrogen.html">hydrogen</a>, which is scarce on the moon
and too valuable to export, the materials we need are all available in the
lunar regolith, but we'd have to establish the manufacturing processes and
tools. It's mostly a question of how many man-hours it takes to build a
reliable satellite, and how much it costs to support the necessary labor on
the moon.</P>

<P>To make a high-tech manufacturing industry work, we'd have to set up
shops to build practically 100% of the parts on the moon. That means
computer chips, gyroscopes, rocket engines, metal extrusions and milled
pieces, photovoltaic cells, image sensing arrays, test rigs... everything 
needed to produce a satellite.</P>

<P>There are a couple of alternative scenarios that would get the lunar
base into the satellite business faster. (1) We could do the final
integration and assembly at a space station in LEO, or (2) ship the small,
high tech parts from Earth to the moon. In both scenarios, we'd make the
heavy stuff [oxydizer, tanks, structure] on the moon.</P>

<P>Eventually, though, we'll want our lunar civilization to build the
whole thing even if they have to import some of the raw materials.</P>

Mission Options</H2><h2 align="center">Moon Guns & Other Mysteries</H2><P><HR><P><P>The idea of building a chemical gun to launch propellants isintriguing  We'refaced with its own interesting technology challenges.  We might need all the industries required tosupport an electromagnetic launcher, plus a lot more.  The following is the concept as we see it; correct us if we're wrong.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Propellants</H3><P>The first issue is making the propellants from lunar material.  There is a lack of nitrogen on the Moon.  Some nitrogen is mixed in withthe regolith, but exporting scarce, life-critical elements from the Moonwould be a self-defeating business.</P><P>Ditto for the idea of exporting hydrogen.  Using hothydrogen has been mentioned as a working fluid, but If we start a business that wastes hydrogen on the Moon, it will lastjust as long as it takes other lunans to wreck it.  The stuff is tooprecious.</P><P>The good news is that there are lots of ways to make propellants fromlunar material.  You need a fuel, <ahref="/adb/04/03/10/05/oxygen-extraction.html">oxydizer</a>, and perhapssome other elements to control the burning rate.  Any mixture that givesyou gasses which will support a supersonic burning wave front (aChapman-Jouget wave) will work.</P><P>The hard part is getting that mixture.  We'll have to disassemble Moonrock to do this.  <a href="/adb/04/03/10/05/oxygen-extraction.html">To getthe oxygen</a> we're exporting, we'll need essentially the same processes.Chemically the function of the gun is to reassemble the compounds we tookapart.  But making propellants for a chemical gun means additional chemicalprocesses, all new technology that will have to be developed at somenon-zero cost.</P><P>Once we make the propellants, we'll need containers, for storage,logistics, and getting the propellants into the gun.  That means moremanufacturing processes, more machining, more technology to develop.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Gun Structure</H3><P>Here it gets really complicated.  We need a precisely machined barrel,able to contain some pretty high chamber pressures.  It'll be miles longunless you're willing to build your payload to withstand thousands ofg's.</P><P>A fuel tank robust enough to take that kind of acceleration is a wholenew engineering challenge.  It wouldn't be useful as a container for rocketpropellants and in this scenario won't be recoverable, so it might not be the best approach.</P><P>That leaves us with the metallurgical challenge of making the materialfor the barrel, and then machining it.  Now we're into really heavyindustry on the Moon.  We haven't estimated the initial capitalrequired to get that much heavy machinery to the Moon, but just the thoughtof it is mind-boggling.  The alternative is building up heavy industry onthe Moon one step at a time, which adds a few decades to the programschedule.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Conclusions</H3><P>Based on the technology challenges and capital required to develop thatbig chemical gun on the Moon, our best guess is that electromagneticpropulsion would be considerably betterfastercheaper to implement.  Linearinduction motors are fairly straightforward so the technology isn't scary.The important structural components -- supports for the magnets andpayloads -- are massive but don't need to be as precise as a chemical gun'sbarrel; we're not building a giant pressure-containing cylinder.</P><P>The basic industries supporting either operation involve miningmoondirt, separating the chemicals, and making metal; and both need a goodpower supply.  For electromagnetic propulsion we're ready to go when we canmake aluminum wire and machine the fiddly bits that keep the partstogether.  We'll even need wire to support control of the chemical gun,too. The chemical gun needs much lower power levels for its operation, butthe fundamental industry is the same; we're still smelting aluminum andextruding it through a die to make wire.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Nevertheless</H3><P>All that said, we can still think of an economic argument for the gun:it looks neat.  The muzzle flash against a dark sky would be awesome; you'd<I>know</I> something is happening when that behemoth fires!  It might evensound neat if the ground shock gets transmitted to a nearby habitat.  Soeven if it takes more industry development to do it, a big chemical gunmight be economically worth doing because its entertainment value might addenough to make up for the cost of developing the additional machiningcapability.  In comparison, an electromagnetic launcher would be boring.Think of it as an attraction at the Great Theme Park In The Sky.</P><P>One more argument in favor of doing this: These days we flinch at theword "spinoff", but the additional industrial capability we'd get frombeing able to do all that heavy machining should spark your imagination. Ifwe can make a cannon barrel on the Moon, we'll be able to make just aboutanything.</p><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><P><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Tue, Mar 5, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

Scenarios for Manned Space Development</H2><h2 align="center">Exposure to Laser Signal Beams from Close Range</H2><P><HR><P><P>It has been proposed to have a laser on the moon point at Earth to sendmessages in the visible or invisible spectrum, or simply to mark thelocation of and draw attention to the moonbase.</P><P>Such a laser, by its very nature, is pointed  upward at the angle abovethe horizon necessary to intersect the Earth. This angle varies a little,but for our purposes can be considered constant. Now, given that it hasenough energy to be detectable as a red dot in atelescope placed somewhere on the disk of the earth, then it is obviousthat there is some distance less than d = 4E05 at which the energy depositedon a retina is damaging.</P><P>Now, what are the chances of such an action occurring? It is not from <AHREF="/adb/e/abbreviatons.html#LEO">LEO</a> or <AHREF="/adb/e/abbreviatons.html#LEO">GEO</a>because for our purposes they are nearly the d above. There is nowhereon the lunar surface that such is possible, so it is not possible for d ~=0; that leaves a cone from thebeacon out through near lunar space. What might be in that cone? A low lunarsatellite might pass through it a few times a year, if that often, because thedispersion will still be so low that it will not be highly likely that anygiven orbit will pass through it. And even then, the transit speed will be sohigh that the integrated energy deposition will be very low.</P><P>The third case is a ship in transit. It is conceivable that some orbitalpaths might intersect the beam at sufficient distances that they couldremain in the beam for seconds or minutes. Let us make a truly grossassumption, that ithappens on every trip out and back. An outward-travelling craft rendezvousingwith the moon does not follow a radius out from the Earth - in fact it isn'teven close. So it would only be at predictable times and intervals duringthe Earth-Moon transit. Low G/High ISP craft will spiral outwards and mightactually pass through it several times, depending on the orbital plane. Spacecraftlike Apollo only come close once per trip.</P><P>Now the orbit planes can't be ignored, and are in fact the reason whythere are windows for lunar trips, particular if they leave from a LEOstation. One must  travel such that the lines of nodes line up at arrival,otherwise you willpass well above or below the moon when you reach 4E05 km. What this means isthat even if your craft passes between the Earth and Moon at a dangerousdistance, it is highly likely that your orbital plane will be well above orbelow the radius line and associated conic beam.</P><P>And if one does pass through the beam, stewards can easily make sure that allthe passengers they are responsible for are kept away from the windows atthe time of possible intersection.</P><P>This leaves local aerial transport. If a lunar "hopper" were to do asuborbital hop such that it went directly over the beacon early in theflight, it is very unlikely there would be someone looking directlydownward for the fraction of second that it passed through the pencil thinbeam, especially if it was known the hopper's trajectory would intersectthe beam.</P><P>For all intents and purposes, the danger of a message laser beingdamaging is negligible. The low probability of intersection and the lowexposure times to vehicles in the path of the laser makes the problem ofaccidental exposure to the laser a very minor one.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Fri, Mar 15, 1996<br>Content by Dale Amon <ahref="mailto:amon@walt.music.qub.ac.uk">&lt;amon@walt.music.qub.ac.uk&gt;</a>, maintained by <AHREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar Resources Company</a>.</font></body></html>

<P>The idea of lunar traffic is one of safe operation. We need to get ships
from Earth to their final destination on the moon in a safe and timely
manner.</P>

<P>Space traffic control is independent from vehicle control and in the
past it has been accomplished through the mission control office. While
this has worked for dedicated missions, it is not the best model for
regular flight operations. A better model is the U.S. air traffic control
system.</P>

<P>Borrowing the basic outline yields:</P>

<ol>
<lI>Certain areas and flight paths are Controlled.
<li>Human or automated Traffic Controllers monitor and maintain these areas.
<lI>All pilots behave themselves and fly according to the rules.
<lI>Anything else is considered an emergency and react teams are alerted.</ul>

<P>Like lane markers and traffic lights, control areas are used to promote good
traffic flow. Navigational markers used to designate flight lanes might be
as simple as an extended version of the GPS system allowing ships to get a
very accurate location fix quickly. This, in turn, will decrease excess
correction burns and improve flight efficiency. Landing zones will be well
marked and sport good radars, removing the guesswork from this difficult and
dangerous aspect of the flight. Flight rules, required equipment, good
facility design, and so on, will be created, and then changed, as we learn
better ways to do them. Specifics will have to be defined and enforced by
some sort of on-going regulatory body (preferably a volunteer
organization).</P>

If one looks at thebalance of payments or our balance of trade, it is the world's largestdebtor nation.</P><P>Then what does self-sufficiency mean?  Is it true that no man is anisland?  Thus,none of us are truly self-sufficient.</P><P>There is obviously an implication that the Moon will be more thansomewhat dependent on resources from Earth.  I wonder, however, if that is true.The Moon is large enough to be considered an 8th continent of Earth.  The Apollomissions surveyed 6 widely separated sites on the near side, and Russiareturned samples from another two near side sites.  Hardly a basis for aglobal analysis of resource dependency.</P><P>If there is water-ice near the poles and if significant carbonaceouschondriteimpact sites can be identified, there is no reason the "necessities" couldn't besupplied from indigenous resources.  Not right away, but quite soon.  Clearlythere is oxygen, aluminum, iron, and silicon for all our needs.  If water iceand carbonaceous chondrites are scarce, these can be found in Earth-crossingasteroids and a variety of other sites in the Solar System.  The ability toreach the Moon and settle there implies the ability to reach Earth crossingasteroids and most other places in the Solar System.</P><P>Will the Moon be dependent on trade?  Yes, forever.  Trade with theUS? No.  Trade with Earth?  Probably.  Trade with other places in the SolarSystem? Certainly.  Will the Moon have anything that it can trade?Yes, or we wouldn't go there.  Tourism, mineral wealth, free banking,information industries, farside radio astronomy, and perhaps low gravity orvacuum-related industries are among the possibilities.  It wouldn't besurprisingif agricultural products were eventually exported to other spacesettlements.</P><P>Meanwhile, the Moon will always be uphill from the Earth to a much greaterextent (20:1 in terms of energy) than the Earth is uphill from the Moon.  Theability to launch items from the surface of the Moon is an essential element ofeconomic infrastructure.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Thu, Apr 4, 1996<br>Content by Jim Davidson <ahref="mailto:73370.3046@compuserve.com">&lt;73370.3046@compuserve.com&gt;</a>, maintained by <AHREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar Resources Company</a>.</font></body></html>

<h2 align="center">2.1 Expanding the Lunar Base</H2>
<h2 align="center">Inflatable Study Comments</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Mike Eckardt</I></P>
<P><HR><P>


<P>The use of inflatable habitats may not be as simple as Mr. Mook
indicated in <a href="/adb/02/01/inflatable-study-1.html">his study</a>.</P>

<P>Accepting the structural properties of polyester film (25,000 psi
yield), a wall or floor section composed of two layers of 12.5 mil film,
separated by polystyrene (negligible strength), will accept a structural
bending moment of 625 ft-lb/ft. If we assume a floor loading of 10
lb/ft<FONT SIZE=1><SUP>2</SUP></FONT> (Earthly design standards are 100
lb/ft<FONT SIZE=1><SUP>2</SUP></FONT> +), the maximum span we could bridge
with this material would be about 22 feet. This maximum can only be
attained if we stress our materials to the yield point, which is very poor
engineering practice.</P>

<P>Similarly, the bubble structure of the habitat will be subject not
only to internal pressure loading, but also to a significant dead load
resulting from the cover of lunar soil over the structure. If we assume a
weight of 150pcf (Earth) for typical regolith, a two-foot cover over the
dome would weight approximately 50psf. As described, the Inflatable would
fail.</P>

<P>A modified design of the inflatable bubble could be used, however, that
would avoid these flaws, as well as the problems that Mr. Bennett 
mentioned in his critique. To support a bending moment of 15,000 ft-lbs</P>
<ol><P><LI>we could use a bubble section as shown in figure 1. Here, the
sphere is composed of a multiple layer shell. The outer layer is as
described in Mr. Mook's study. A second, inner shell of two more layers
of polyester with 2" of polystyrene filler is placed inside the first
shell. Between the two layers is a 24" free space (vacuum is acceptable). 
Kevlar reinforced webbing of film/foam can be added every 3 - 4 feet. The
resulting structure is similar to a standard I-beam, as used in
construction here on Earth.</P>

<P>The loading on floor elements is much less than the bubble. Here, we
could get by with about 4,500 ft-lb in bending (2), which can be easily
supported by a double layer structure as described above, except with a
flange spacing of only 12".</P>

<P>The empty space provided by this method of construction is typically
used on Earth for utility services. Presumably similar uses could be made
of it in a lunar habitat.</P>

<P>Using the above method of construction, the habitat weights that Mr.
Mook provided would be changed to the following:</P>

<pre>
                      3.75 psi        14.7 psi
     ------------------------------------------
     Shell            3,187 lb       12,750 lb (3)
     Air              2,225 lb        8,900 lb
     Flooring         3,000 lb        3,000 lb
     Vertical Boom      280 lb          280 lb
     Horizontal Boom    150 lb          150 lb
     3 Airlock Doors  1,440 lb        1,440 lb
     Airlock Tube       360 lb          360 lb
     ------------------------------------------
     SUBTOTAL        10,642 lb       26,880 lb</pre>

<P>While these figures are substantially higher than those Mr. Mook
provided, they probably represent a more stucturally sound habitat.
Other factors not included in this summary are materials required to
make the habitant livable (utilities, dividing walls, etc.).</P>


<P><LI>This figure assumes a dead load weight of 50psf for soil cover on
the habitat. Moment calculated at peak of bubble calculated as
follows:</P>

<pre>     Mb = 50psf * 30ft * 30ft / 2
          - 50psf * 30ft * 20ft / 2 (approximately triangular section)
        = 7,500 ft-lb
          *   2 (S.F.)
         ----------
         15,000 ft-lb</pre>

<P><LI>Using a floor loading of 20psf (allowing for dynamic live-loads), a
1ft section of floor spanning 30' would have a peak moment:</P>

<pre>     Mf = 20lb/ft * 30ft * 30ft / 4

        = 4,500 ft-lb</pre>


<P>NOTE: Neither calculation has considered shear loading on structural
memeber.</P>

<P><LI>The 50 mil film used for the higher pressure envelope does not
require the same structural section used for the 12.5 mil variation. These
figures are based on the same structure, with the heavier material
used.</P>

<h2 align="center">Lavatube Access Equipment Option</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Tom Billings</I></P>
<P><HR><P>


<P>The research team at Oregon L-5 Society (Lunar Base Research Team, 
LBRT) has looked into lavatube lunar bases somewhat. The method I would 
propose for opening a lavatube with minimal lifted mass, expense, risk 
and time would be a "mucker."</P>

<P>Go to the end of the lavatube that abuts a sinuous rille, (almost all
should, at some point), then put three posts in the regolith at 
appropriate points, with pulleys attached to the posts. Run cables 
through the pulleys and attach a scraper bucket of appropriate size and 
shape to the cables. Use an electric motor to pull the cables, and thus 
the bucket, back and forth across the front of the regolith plug at the 
TOP of the lavatube's entrance. The lavatube entrance will, I believe, be 
plugged by a combination of large breakdown boulders, at the bottom, and 
regolith at the top.</P>

<P>It is the, relatively, looser regolith material that thus forms your point
of attack, not hard basalt, much less large broken blocks of it. The 
resulting cut in the regolith slope at the top of the entrance plug 
should give an access space of ten meters, more or less, into the TOP of 
a large lavatube that might easily be 500 meters in diameter. The base 
can thus be suspended from the lavatube roof, instead of being 500 meters 
from the surface, which is more than the height of the Empire State 
Building.</P>

<P>The advantages of this method are low initial mass lifted and strategic
positioning of the base inside the lavatube, near the surface. The
disadvantage could be that too much of the entrance plug might be large
blocks of basalt. I would consider this unlikely, since the entrnace plug
would have been subjected to the same regolith generating processes over the
last 3.5 billion years that the rest of the surface has been.</P>

Remember that lunar lavatubes probably can be far larger thanthe (approximately) 25 meter diameter limit here on Earth. In addition, anynon-metallic native coating material can be expected to crack as it cools.Measurements of collapse trenches believed to be associated with lunarlavatubes indicate diameters of several hundreds of meters.  Given thissituaution, they evolved several ways to use lunar lavatubes.</P><P>First, it would make sense just to use them as shelter from radiation,temperature changes, dust, etc. for rigid or inflatable habitats broughtfrom Earth.  This alone could mean large cost reductions by reducing the"emplacement costs" otherwise neccessary for such shelter requirements.</P><P>Second, it was noted that lunar glass fibers might be combined with nativemeteoritic iron-nickel particles to produce larger habitats from resourceson the moon.  Dr. Goldsworthy showed the possibility of making very strongglass fibers on the Moon during the 1980s.  Native meteoritic metal couldbe refined by the "carbonyl" method, and the metal carbonyls used toproduce a thin, tough, airtight metal layer on the inside of a habitatwoven from lunar glass fibers.  These habitats, inside lavatubes, wouldincrease the available sheltered cubic volume greatly, and do it with cheapnative materials.</P><P>Finally, if it is required to have an entire town inside one of thesevery largetubes, with the entire tube sealed, then the meteoriticnickel-iron could be used again.  First use the carbonyl process to producethe puremetals in powdered form (micron-sized particles), as is done at Sudbury,Canada in producing much of the Earth's nickel supply.  Then, chill thepowder with <a href="/adb/04/03/10/04/oxygen-extraction.html">LunarLOX</a>.  Now, put it through a modified (bucketless) massdriver some tensof meters long and shoot it at the walls of the lavatube at a 90-degreeimpact.  With a velocity of about 2-3kilometers/sec., the powder particles will splatter/self-forge to the wallof the tube, building up a layer of metal that seals all but the smallestcracks.  To make sure that no leaks remain, we may now introduce gaseouscarbonyls into the tube, and use Laser Chemical Vapor Deposition with asolar powered laser's beam to get a final continuous film producing anairtight seal.</P><P>The advantage to these methods is in limiting the amount of molten materialthat is handled in any bulk, especially in the open, especially around anyhumans.  Either molten metal or molten rock/glass/lava are very corrosive.They require large amounts of energy to produce.  In the case of moltenaluminum, this means large amounts of electrical energy, which is already amajor bottleneck in space operations.  Carbonyls are non-corrosive liquidsat room temperatures and are reduced to metal and CO at about 200&#176;C at lowpressures.  The iron and nickel carbonyls require only carbon monoxide gaspassed over the native material at 160&#176;C to generate the carbonyl.  In thevacuum of space they should be much safer and cheaper to handle.</P><P>This should allow significant cost reductions to lunar base activitiesfairly soon after the first outpost is in place, or with sufficienttelerobotic preparation, at the first outpost itself.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sat, Mar 16, 1996<br>Content by Tom Billings <AHREF="MAILTO:itsd1@teleport.com">&lt;itsd1@teleport.com&gt;</A>, maintainedby <A HREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar Resources Company</a>.</font></body></html>

Bennett</I></P><P><HR><P><P>One of the focus points of the Artemis Project's long-range vision is aself-supporting lunar community, where people can emigrate and visit. Asignificant fraction of the population would be able to liquidate theirterrestrial assets, move to the Moon, and buy an apartment built with lunarmaterials.<P>The <a href="/adb/06/07/02/01/01/">Advanced Planning TechnicalCommittee</a> has just begun work on an economic model for the lunarcommunity.  The lunar community -- that is, the permanent residents -- willearn their living either by exploiting the resources of the moon (includingtourism) or through occupations which can telecommute to do business onEarth.</P><P>On the ASI website, there's a <a href="/adb/02/07/02/01/">description</a> ofthe size of the staff and supporting industries required for lunar tourismto happen.  Presumably, those people are permanent or at least long-termresidents.  In addition to that, the lunar resources industries -- <ahref="/adb/04/03/10/04/oxygen-extraction.html">oxygen</a>, <ahref="/adb/02/02/">metals</a>, volatiles -- will need a lot ofemployees.</P><P>In addition to directly exploiting the moon's resources, however, thelunar community can enjoy a significant advantage from people who want tolive there just because it's a nifty place to live.  Many occupations whichexist on Earth today could be done from the moon -- if you can do it on theInternet, you can do it on the moon.</P><P>We should enthusiastically encourage telecommuting from the moonbecause those permanent residents will be creating wealth on Earth owned bypermanent residents of the moon.  That significantly enhances the economyof the lunar community by creating a positive balance of payments.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Fri, July 19, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Simon Rowland</I></P>
<P><HR><P>

<P>In 1988, a paper titled "Enabling Lunar and Space Missions by Laser Power
Transmission" was published by R.J. DeYoung, J.E.N ealy, D.H. Humes, and
W.E. Meador of NASA's Langely Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. Among
the proposals from DeYoung, et al., is to use a high-intensity laser beam
to heat the lunar surface to the melting point, presumably from orbit.
When it cools, we'll have a hard, glassy surface for roadways and launch
pads.</P>

<P>A 1 megawatt laser heating a 1-meter diameter spot for 10 minutes will
melt the regolith to a depth of 2 cm.</P>

<P>Although superficially this concept seems unfeasible by the level of
infrastructure required to laser-sinter the roads, a simple inflatable
reflector could serve a similar purpose. With solar radiation at 1.4 KW per
square meter, a 13-meter radius inflatable reflector could be driven along
at 3.8 m/h, and make a road 1.5 meters wide as it goes. This could make 4
km of roads near the lunar habitat in four months before the second misson,
and a 40 meter square landing pad to boot.</P>

<P>Sintering roads and walkways will be important for increasing the
efficiency of ground transportation, and reducing <a
href="/adb/m/03/04/">problems with fines</a> (moondust), which are
anticipated to be a major issue for a permanent lunar habitat.</P>

Burkhead</I></P><P><HR><P><P>Aluminum is an abundant material on the Moon, and can be used in avariety of applications. Rocket propellant and export to LEO may be twolarge applications.</P><P>Hydrogen/Oxygen engines are very efficient. However, if you're on theMoon, then you may very well not want hydrogenat all, not until you have an extraterrestrial source.  The penalty inlifting that hydrogen from Earth's surface (including lifting very largetanks) may be higher than the penalty of using a lower Isp rocket that usesindigenous fuels.  Aluminum/oxygen is one possibility.  The figures usuallypublished give it an Isp of about 270.  That's on the low side, but it's adense fuel, so you can get pretty high mass ratios.  Also the delta-vrequirements of most missions are much lower than that of launch fromEarth's surface to orbit.</P><P>On the production side of the equation, thanks to the US Bureau of Mineswe already have techniques to extract aluminum from feldspars (which areplentiful on the moon).  Perhaps the most adaptable to lunarconditions is the <ahref="/adb/02/02/aluminum-esxtraction.html">melt-quench-crush-leachprocess</a>.  Melt the rock (bigsolar furnace, only runs during the lunar day), and quench it to glass,then crush it.  This breaks up the crystalline structure so that acids canleach out the aluminum oxide.  Precipitate the aluminum oxide and the restis identical to Earth-based processes.</P><P>In terms of exports, I did some economic type numbers onjust that kind of operation for my article "The Economics of Lunar Mining"which appeared in the August/September '93 issue of High TechnologyCareers. The upshot is that lunar aluminum, delivered to Earth orbit, andusing current launch prices, will cost about $52,000 a ton.  Compare thatwith Terrestrial materials also delivered to Earth orbit at more than $4million a ton.  I didn't include the use of lunar aluminum as a propellantin the figures, or low thrust/high efficiency engines such as ion drives,but it's pretty clear that either would drive down the cost of the lunaraluminum, as would closing the life support system (I assumed a completelyopen cycle life support system, with everything but oxygen lifted fromEarth).  Likewise, lower launch costs would drive down the cost of bothlunar and terrestrial aluminum.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Mon, Aug 26, 1996<br>Content by David L.

<h2 align="center">Melt-Quench-Leech Aluminum Extraction</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>David Burkhead</I></P>
<P><HR><P>

<P>The main drivers of the mass of a melt-quench-leech aluminum extraction
cycle are how much you have to process how fast (it takes more mass to
process more material) and how concentrated the regolith is in desired
minerals. Assuming you need to produce 1 tonne of aluminum a day and the
regolith runs 3% aluminum by weight, that means you need to process 30
tonnes of regolith every 24 hours. A group of <a
href="/adb/04/02/05/04/">robots</a> capable of moving 1.25 tonnes of
regolith per hour might mass 2 tonnes.</P>

<P>To melt the rock, you'll need about (to a fairly loose approximation)
100 kJ per kg. That's 830 kW hours of energy for the entire day's load (or
35 kW source operating for the entire day). A solar furnace (solar energy
to heat) is on the order of 70% efficient, and during the lunar day the
solar energy available is 1360 watts per square meter of collection area.
That leads to a collector area of 37 square meters, or a 7-meter diameter
solar reflector. The mass of such an inflatable reflector would be
negligible.</P>

<P>The next step is the quench. If the melt can be poured in a thin 
stream (high surface to volume ratio) you can get the "quench" from
radiation alone--no need for special equipment. That requires a vacuum
environment though, to prevent contamination and oxidation of the melt
(which is exactly the opposite of the effect you want). The moon, of
course, has plenty of vacuum, so that's to the good. Another advantage of
this method is that it leaves the glass produced in a nice, handleable
form, with the high surface area-to-volume ratio you want for the next
phase.</P>

<P>Next is the leech process, which requires vats of hot acid. A lot
depends on the leech time and how much acid is required for a given amount
of lunar glass. Let's say the leech time is six hours and the total 
volume is twice the glass volume. 30 metric tons of glass is about 10
cubic meters. You'll need the same amount of acid but you can use the
volume 4 times a day, so that's about 4 metric tons. Of the H<FONT
SIZE=1>2</FONT>SO<FONT SIZE=1>4</FONT>, 65% can be <a
href="/adb/04/03/10/04/oxygen-extraction.html">lunar oxygen</a>, leading to
1.4 tonnes of sulphuric acid components which must come from Earth. The
vats themselves are pretty big, probably another tonne, but it would
probably be possible to use solar heat to melt vats out of lunar rock or
glass, saving the shipping weight.</P>

<P>From leech, you have to recover the alumina from the acid. That will
require more vats to carry cooling acid--cooling the acid should be
sufficient since the solubility of alumina is highly temperature-dependent.
For this we double acid and vat weights. This gives us a total to this
point of about 12 metric tons, 5 of which must come from Earth.</P>

<P>The next step is standard aluminum production. The alumina is 
dissolved in molten cryolyte and electrolyzed. A facility to do this might
mass 3 tonnes.</P>

<P>This gives us a total of 8 metric tons on the moon. Much of the mass,
perhaps 7 metric tons, can be avoided by the use of lunar materials. The 8
tonnes will have to come from Earth. It will probably require a crew of 5
to operate.</P>

<P>The result will be a plant capable of producing a metric ton of
aluminum every day, but only during the lunar daylight periods (the solar
furnace). This means about 180 tonnes per year, and 5300 tonnes of 
tailings enriched in other elements, ready for <a
href="/adb/04/03/10/04/oxygen-extraction.html">oxygen extraction</a> (which
further enriches ilmenite to TiO<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT> and FeO). Processing
that quantity of regolith would also free several tonnes of volatiles per
year, which would be essential for <a
href="/adb/04/03/05/consumable-reduction.html">life support
resupply</a>.</P>

Landis</I></P><P><HR><P><P>Aluminum is a byproduct of <a href="silicon-production.html#1f">step1F</a> of a <a href="silicon-production.html">silicon extractionprocess</a>, but not in pure form.  If the titaniumfluoride is not returned to the reduction after separation in vapor form atthe initial fluoridation stage, then the product from step 1F will be analuminum/iron mixture.  There are roughly 2 atoms of iron for every threeatoms of aluminum in the lunar soil.  Since the lowest temperature liquidphase of metallic aluminum and iron mixtures is liquid aluminum plus ironaluminide (Al<font size=1>3</font>Fe), the aluminum/iron resultant phasewill be ironaluminides, primarily Al<font size=1>3</font>Fe.  If the feed material is ahigh-aluminum/low-iron soil such as the Apollo 16 soil (27% Al<fontsize=1>2</font>O<font size=1>3</font>, 5% FeO),metallic aluminum will be formed.</P><P>Purifying the aluminum can be done by a number of processes, either byseparating the aluminum fluoride by chemical means, by making analuminum-enriched alloy and removing aluminum by melting, or by other meansof removing the aluminum at the alloy stage.</P><P>A simple physical method for separating out the aluminum is by vacuumdistillation.  This process exploits the higher vapor pressure of aluminumover iron; it is a convenient method for lunar application since itrequires only heat and vacuum.  This requires heating the alloy mixture toa temperature at which aluminum vapor is evolved, and then exposing acooled surface for the vapor to condense upon.  The relatively pure film ofaluminum produced is then removed for use by heating the condensing surfaceto melt the aluminum.</P><P>Vacuum distillation could also be used to separate the aluminum fluoridefrom the fluoride salt mixture in the same way, first subliming aluminumsalt AlF<font size=1>3</font> away from the iron salt at 1291 &#176;C.This has the disadvantagethat, since the fluorine must be recovered to be reused as reactant, thedistillation cannot allow any wasted material.  Loss of aluminum metal, onthe other hand, is of little concern, since aluminum is abundant on themoon.  Thus, if high-aluminum soil cannot be easily found to use asfeedstock, vacuum distillation will be used to separate the aluminum fromthe alloy mix.</P><P>An alternative material for electrical conduction is metallic calcium.This is not used on the Earth because of the extremely high reactivity ofcalcium in an oxygen atmosphere, but this may not be a problem on the moon.</P><P>Calcium has the property of having one of the highest conductivity todensity ratios of any easily-available metal, that is, metallic calciummakes the lightest wires.  However, aluminum is adequate for wire use, andaluminum technology is well developed.  Therefore I have not baselinedcalcium for use in the production sequence discussed.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.

The penalty inlifting that hydrogen from Earth's surface (including lifting very largetanks) may be higher than the penalty of using a lower Isp rocket that usesindigenous fuels.  Aluminum/oxygen is one possibility.  The figures usuallypublished give it an Isp of about 270.  That's on the low side, but it's adense fuel, so you can get pretty high mass ratios.  Also the delta-vrequirements of most missions are much lower than that of launch fromEarth's surface to orbit.</P><P>On the production side of the equation, thanks to the US Bureau of Mineswe already have techniques to extract aluminum from feldspars (such as arefound in plenty on the moon).  Perhaps the most adaptable to lunarconditions is the melt-quench-crush-leach process.  Melt the rock (bigsolar furnace, only runs during the lunar day), and quench it to glass,then crush it.  This breaks up the crystalline structure so that acids canleach out the aluminum oxide.  Precipitate the aluminum oxide and the restis identical to Earth based processes.  I did some economic type numbers onjust that kind of operation for my article "The Economics of Lunar Mining"which appeared in the August/September '93 issue of High TechnologyCareers. The upshot is that lunar aluminum, delivered to Earth orbit, andusing current launch prices, will cost about $52,000 a ton.  Compare thatwith Terrestrial materials also delivered to Earth orbit at more than $4million a ton.  I didn't include the use of lunar aluminum as a propellantin the figures, or low thrust/high efficiency engines such as ion drives,but it's pretty clear that either would drive down the cost of the lunaraluminum, as would closing the life support system (I assumed a completelyopen cycle life support system, with everything but oxygen lifted fromEarth).  Likewise, lower launch costs would drive down the cost of bothlunar and terrestrial aluminum.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Wed, May 15, 1996<br>Content by David L.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>2.2 Glassmaking on the Moon</H2</TITLE></HEAD><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><!-- Artemis Data Book --><!-- ADB section 2.2 Lunar Mining --><!-- file: /adb/02/02/glass-production.html --><!-- v 1.0 --><h2 align="center">Artemis Data Book</H2><h2 align="center">2.2 Lunar Mining</H2><h2 align="center">Glassmaking on the Moon</H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Geoffrey A. Landis</I></P><P><HR><P><P>Glass is a very useful material for the Moon. However, it is consideredsuch a low-technology, bulk thermal process thatit is hard to realize that it may be difficult on the moon.  It isdesirable to design a process that can use un-beneficiated regolith.</P><P>Glass is an amorphous mixture of silicon dioxide with typically alkalineand alkaline-earth oxides.  The silicon dioxide forms the structuralnetwork of the glass; the other oxides modify the properties to thedesirable form.  On earth, the most commonly produced glass is soda-limeglass.  "Soda" indicates sodium, in the form of Na<font size=1>2</font>O;lime indicatedcalcium oxide, in the form CaO.  The typical proportions are SiO<fontsize=1>2</font> 75%, Na<font size=1>2</FONT>O 15% and CaO 10%, plus 2-3percent other materials.  Soda lime glass isproduced in large amounts on Earth because its low melt temperature makesit easy to work with.  Unfortunately, sodium is not a common material onthe moon, comprising 0.1% to 1% of the bulk lunar regolith.  A seconddisadvantage of soda-lime glass is that it has a veryhigh thermal expansion coefficient, making it vulnerable to the temperatureexcursion of the lunar day-night cycle.</P><P>An alternative glass is pure fused silica, which consists of silicondioxide plus trace components.  While silicon is abundant on the moon, themelt temperature of fused silica makes it extremely difficult to work with.Typically laboratory silica is mixed with other components to lower theworking temperature.</P><P>A useful laboratory glass is borosilicate glass, such as pyrex, where boronoxide B<font size=1>2</font>O<font size=1>3</font> is the primary additive,however, boron is also not a commonlyavailable material on the moon (1-50 parts per million).</P><P>For this reason, I have selected aluminosilicate glass as the baseline forlunar glass.   A typical aluminosilicate glass formula isSiO<font size=1>2</font> 57%, Al<font size=1>2</font>O<font size=1>3</font>20%, MgO 12%, CaO 5%, B<font size=1>2</font>O<font size=1>3</font> 4%,Na<font size=1>2</font>O 1%, trace oxides 1%.</P><P>Of these constituents, silicon, aluminum, magnesium and calcium are commonon the moon (in fact, calcium-magnesium aluminosilicate is virtually thedefinition of the anorthositic material that is the primary constituant ofthe moon, with some iron substituting for magnesium).   I will assume herethat the boron and sodium oxides can be left out.  This will have theunfortunate effect of raising the softening temperature of the glass, butwill allow it to be made from lunar material.</P><P>Aluminosilicate glasses have an intermediate melt temperature, typically ca1130 &#176;C, which is well above the 860 &#176;C melt temperature of soda-limeglass, but well below the almost unworkable 1710 &#176;C of fused silica.  Interms of working temperature, it has an annealing temperature of typically715 &#176;C, and softening temperature 915 &#176;C (although note that theboron-freeformulation discussed here will probably have a slightly highertemperature).  It also has a low thermal expansion coefficient, comparableto borosilicates.</P><P>The second difficulty, after choosing a glass composition, is that for mostuses our glass will have to be transparent.  This turns out to be asignificant difficulty.  Glass darkening is typically due to transitionmetal oxides, in particular, iron oxide (FeO).  FeO is a significantcomponent of lunar rock, ranging from roughly 3% to 23% of the rock weightfraction.  This is why lunar rock is black.  Producing a transparent glasswill require reducing the iron content to essentially zero.  On Earth, thisis done by selecting iron-free source materials; however, this is notlikely to be an option on the moon, and removal of the iron will probablyhave to be done by chemical or physico-chemical means.  Another step usedon Earth is to add manganese dioxide to neutralize some of the green colorof the iron; however, on the moon, manganese is a low abundance mineral(&lt;0.25%), and is found typically in exactly the same rocks that contain Fe,with a Fe:Mn ratio of ~80:1.  Thus, this is not a good option.</P><P>In principle, in the procedure outlined here, most (if not all) of the ironis segregated in the form of an iron/aluminum/titanium mixture by potassiumreduction.  Of this, only the aluminum component is needed as a rawmaterial for the glassmaking.  Thus, the question of removal of the iron isequivalent to the problem of purifying the aluminum, discussed in thealuminum section.</P><P>Thus, there seems to be no real barrier to production of glass from lunarmaterials.  Once the raw oxides have been refined, the glassmaking processrequires melting the component materials, producing the required form(plate, cast ingots, etc), and, for stress-free glass, holding the glass atthe annealing temperature for an extended period to allow internal thermalstress to relax.  Conventional glass plate produced by the "float glass"method is done by spreading the melt on a bed of liquid tin; this may notbe the optimum process for lunar production.  The melting temperature forthe aluminosilicate glass, on the order of 1130 &#176;C, is significantly higherthan the temperatures required in any other parts of the solar cellproduction process.  This is an incentive for refining of boron, sodium,and lithium oxides despite the relatively low mass fraction of thesematerials in lunar soil, to lower the glass melting temperature.</P><P>An alternative approach to glassmaking, discussed by Mackenzie and Claridge[1], is to form glass out of anorthite purified from the lunarplagioclase.  They note that anorthite (calcium aluminosilicate) isnaturally low in iron, and hence can be used as a material to form atransparent glass.  Their approach requires purification of the feedstockto separate out essentially pure anorthite, then melting this to makeglass.  The melting point of anorthite, approximately 1550 &#176;C, isrelatively high, making it difficult to work with.  They suggest additionof calcium oxide, to form a composition of roughly 46% CaO,42% SiO<fontsize=1>2</font>, 11%Al<font size=1>2</font>O<font size=1>3</font>, and 1% trace, to reduce themelting point to 1350 &#176;C, and sketch adesign for an electric furnace for processing the glass into both sheet andfiber.  Even this modified composition results in a very high melttemperature of the glass, though, which will make it difficult to work.Nevertheless, if beneficiation of the input material to purify anorthositeproves to be easy, this may be a good approach.</P><h4>References:</h4><FONT SIZE=2><P>1.

Bennett</I></P><P><HR><P><P>There has been debate concerning the alledged ice at the Lunar SouthPole.  The conclusion is that, if that ice is really there, it just isn'tenough to be commercially exploitable.</P><P>First, it must be determined how much the ice is really worth. Dependingon your source, there is about 15,000 cubic feet (425 m<FONTSIZE=1><sup>3</SUP></FONT>).  It's about the amount of water in the fishpond on my grandfather's farm in Martinsville, Indiana, or roughly thevolume of water contained at thisvery moment in the new Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at NASA.</P><P>That's about 128,000 lbs (58,000 kg) of <ahref="/adb/m/08/08/hydrogen.html">hydrogen</a>, or about how much isimbedded in  the top 10 cm of a square kilometer of regolith at 1 part in10,000. To extract that hydrogen, however, one would have to process 580kilotons of regolith. In that regolith, one would also find very roughly60 tons of <a href="/adb/m/08/08/nitrogen.html">nitrogen</a>, 120 tonsof <a href="/adb/m/08/08/carbon.html">carbon</a>, 10 tons of helium, 2.5kilograms of <a href="/adb/02/09/he3-intro.html">helium-3</a>, and 500 kgeach of neon, argon, krypton, and xenon.</P><P>Assuming chemical rockets are used to deliver this much hydrogen to themoon from <a href="/adb/e/abbreviations.html#LEO">LEO</a> with an Isp of460, we'd need 3.76 times as much mass in LEOas we deliver to the moon's surface.  Add in 4% for the weight of thetanks, do some arithmetic, and we need 500,000 lbs (225,000 kg) in LEO toget that much hydrogen to the moon.</P><P>That's about 8 <a href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/titan-4.html">Titan IV</a>launches, which we could get for $125 million eachif we could talk the US Air Force into putting our payloads into LEO.  So,assuming that the cost of obtaining and processing lunar ice into tanks ofliquid hydrogen is negligible (a very unreasonable assumption), the streetvalue in downtown Luna City of that much hydrogen in that theoretical lunarice is about US$1 billion.</P><P>That's $1 billion using 1996 technology.  When the moon fleet gets running,the cost of delivering that much hydrogen to the moon will drop by abouttwo orders of magnitude, so let's guess $10 million.</P><P>I'm not exactly overwhelmed by that much hydrogen.</P><P>Can't say I'm underwhelmed, either.  It's just about the amount of water weneed to support our little city in the moon; not enough to really do thingsin a big way, but nothing to be scoffed at, either.</P><P>It has been suggested that we should consider doing whatever ittakes to get the lunar community started; even if that means using in-situhydrogen for propellant.  However, it doesn't seem like this theoreticalpuddle of ice at Artemis Antarctica will be worth the bother to go get it.It just doesn't make a big impact on the overall balance sheet.</P><P>Further, the scientific value of the stuff is thought by some to be aboutequal to its intrinsic commercial value, assuming there's a lunar communitywho would want to buy it.  Also, whatever today's selenologists could learnfrom studying this stuff, one couldn't guess what the lunar scientists twogenerations hence might be able to learn.  However, this ice is ananomalous condition on the surface of the moon; so I'd guess that it isscientifically important.  I can't champion the cause of doing anythingthat would forever destroy the data.</P><P>Therefore, it would not make sense to use this resource for either <ahref="/adb/04/03/05/consumable-reduction.html">life support</a> or rocketfuel. Let's let the geologists have first crack at it, and leave itscommercial value for our grandchildren to exploit after they have learnedall there is to learn.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sun, Dec 8, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

Rocks are silicates, oxides of silicon, plus other elements,usually also expressible as oxides of metals.  The lunar crust is 46%oxygen by weight.</P><P>Hydrogen enjoys no similar essential relationship at all. There is onlyabout 1 ton of hydrogen per 10,000 tons of lunar "top soil" or regolith.(This compares with 4,600 tons of oxygen.) Accummulatively, that's enough,if gathered, to produce a nice-sized lake. Yet 1 part in 10,000 is a lotdrier than the driest desert on Earth.</P><P>There is good news in this, however. Unlike the oxygen which ischemically bound and can only be released by chemical processing or a gooddeal of heat, the hydrogen exists proton by proton loosely absorbed to thesurfaces of the fine lunar dust particles. Unlike <ahref="/adb/04/03/10/04/">lunar oxygen</a>, it is not native to the Moon,but a gift of 4 billion years of incessant buffeting of the lunar surfaceby the Solar Wind. So it is a gift of the Sun. Accompanying the hydrogen isa much lesser endowment of <a href="/adb/02/carbon.html">carbon</a>,nitrogen, and helium, all valuable. A tiny fraction of the helium is <Ahref="/adb/02/09/he3-intro.html">helium-3</a>, a strategic isotope that isthe ideal fuel for still-to-be-engineered fusion reactors. (One <ahref="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/">shuttle</a> external tankful of liquid He-3would be enough, if there were the fusion plants to burn it, to supply allthe electrical power the US uses in a year.)</P><P>All of these Solar Wind gasses, hydrogen being the bulk of it, can beeasily harvested. We just have to run over the surface with a combine whichpicks up the top layer, heats it to 600 degrees F and then lays the soilright back down. The heat will have driven off the Solar Wind gasses whichcan be collected and separated.</P><P>This can be done as a separate harvesting operation. But it makes moresense to design all regolith-moving equipment to do the job in the processof site preparation, grading and building roads, excavations, pilingshielding on top of habitats, and mining. Even if we don't need or are notprepared to use all these gasses right away, stockpiling them in a tankfarm, separated or not, will place us in a much better positionstrategically to enter the Moon's industrial age.</P><P>The solar wind hydrogen will give us some, but almost certainly notenough fast enough to meet settlement needs, unless a full-scale helium-3harvesting operation is in effect. There remains the slim chance we willfind economically mineable water-ice fields in permashade areas at thepoles. Clementine hinted at this at the south pole, but that probe reallydid not have the needed instrumentation to give a definite answer. LunarProspector will have that instrumentation.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sun, Mar 31, 1996<br>Content by Peter Kokh <ahref="mailto:kokhmmm@execpc.com">&lt;kokhmmm@execpc.com&gt;</a>, maintainedby <A HREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar Resources Company</a>.</font></body></html>

Calculations show that if recyclingefficiency is good, transportation of these materials from Earth will notbe a limiting factor.</P><P>The most common soil material is anorthite, CaAl<fontsize=1>2</font>Si<font size=1>2</font>O<font size=1>8</font>, which can beconsidered to be a mixture of calcium, aluminum, and silicon oxides: CaO +Al<font size=1>2</font>O<font size=1>3</font> + 2SiO<fontsize=1>2</font>.In the literature several methods are proposed to processextraterrestrial ores, but none have been tested in situ.  The primarycriteria for the process selection are low power requirement and lowrequirement for  non-lunar materials.  Other important criteria include theend products provided, the process complexity, and suitability formanufacturing under 1/6 G.</P><P>Processes considered include fluoroacid leaching, vapor phase pyrolysis<a href="#references">[1]</a>, carbothermal processing, and slagelectrolysis.  For the candidateprocess we considered aluminum reduction followed by electrolysis torecover the aluminum, as shown by the following reaction:</P><pre>        3 SiO<fontsize=1>2</font> + 4 Al  -->  3 Si + 2 Al<fontsize=1>2</font>O<fontsize=1>3</font>,        2 Al<fontsize=1>2</font>O<fontsize=1>3</font> (electrolysis)  -->  4 Al + 3 O<fontsize=1>2</font></pre><P>This process has been developed and demonstrated by Keller and co-workersat EMEC corporation <a href="#references">[2]</a>.  The aluminum actssimultaneously as a reducingagent for the silicon dioxide and as a solvent for the silicon that hasbeen formed, which can subsequently be crystallized out of the solution ina nearly pure form by cooling.  Because the reduction is exothermic, thereaction vessel needs to be heated externally only during the initial phaseof melting of the slag and the beginning of the reaction.</P><P>An alternative process is electroreduction from an alkaline-earth oxidemelt, which has been demonstrated by DeMattei, Elwell, and Feigelson atStanford <a href="#references">[3]</a>, as shown in the reaction:</P><pre>        3 BaSiO<fontsize=1>3</font> (electrolysis)  ->  Si + 3 BaO + 2 SiO<fontsize=1>2</font> + O<fontsize=1>2</font></pre><P>This has the disadvantage that the flux metal, barium, is not available onthe moon.  It is possible that other metals can be used.  This is not aproblem as long as the material recycling efficiency is high.</P><P>The silicon obtained must be purified for use in semiconductor devices.  Acandidate process for purification is by float-zone recrystallization,where the silicon rod is melted in a zone that passes along the length ofthe rod.  Impurities are segregated to the end of the material.  Thisprocess is slow, but has the advantage of zero materials consumption.</P><a name="references"><h4>References</h4></a><font size=2>(10) D.L.

Landis</I></P><P><HR><P><h3>Refining of Regolith</h3><P>Silicon cannot be manufactured by the industrial processes used on Earth,of course, if for no other reason than silicon production on Earthuses as a raw material high-silica sand, while lunar regolith is primarilyigneous silicates such as anorthosites.  Also, production of one mole ofsilicon on Earth uses one mole of carbon in the form of coal, not availableon the moon.  Any production process for the moon must use no reactantsthat cannot be completely recycled.</P><P>Unbeneficiated lunar soil ("regolith") is powdered igneous rock.  Itconsists of a mixture of primarily iron, calcium, aluminum, and magnesiumsilicates, with a few percent titanium, plus small amounts of manganese,sodium, potassium, chromium, and rare-earth oxides.  The exact compositionvaries from site to site, and possibly from sample to sample at a givensite; regolith composition is discussed in detail in the Lunar Sourcebook<a href="#references">[2]</a>.</P><P>Several different production processes were examined.  Good reviews arefound in References <a href="#references">[3,4]</a>, and so a review willnot be done here.  Manyof the commonly proposed processes for production of oxygen from lunarresources (e.g., <a href="/adb/04/03/10/04/oxygen-extraction.html">ilmenitereduction</a>) were not applicable, since they didnot produce silicon.  Others were discarded because silicon, although abyproduct, was not produced in pure form.  The process follows (but is notquite identical to) that suggested by Seboldt and co-workers from GermanAerospace <a href="#references">[5]</a>.  It has the advantage that thesilicon is produced in theform of fluorosilane, which can be easily purified of contamination of theother metals.  In fact, the process can be adapted in a straightforwardmanner to production of other relatively pure products, including titanium,aluminum, and iron.</P><P>The basic silicon reduction process is to heat the regolith in the presenceof fluorine.  The fluorine will displace the oxygen, which is collected asa useful byproduct.  Silicon is produced in the form of fluorosilane(silicon tetrafluoride).  The silicon is recovered from the flurosilane byplasma decomposition.  The metal fluorides ("fluorine salts") are thenreduced with potassium to recycle the fluorine.</P><P>Existing processes to produce silicon do not use fluorosilane, but insteaduse silane (SiH<font size=1>4</font>).  Both plasma deposition processes(to produce amorphoussilicon) and chemical vapor deposition processes (direct thermaldecomposition, to produce either amorphous or polycrystalline Si) arecommonly used in the solar cell industry to reduce silane to silicon.  I amassuming here that it is possible to produce silicon of acceptable qualityby plasma decomposition of tetra-fluorosilane instead of silane, but thiswill have to be demonstrated on the ground.  If not, the process willrequire successive disproportionation of fluorosilane to silane.  This is amulti-step chemical replacement of fluorine with hydrogen at high pressureand temperature.</P><P>Note that this process is different from that suggested in earlier work<a href="#references">[1]</a>, which suggested a fluxed aluminothermicreduction.  The processsuggested here is much less sensitive to the composition of the regolithsource material, and thus a better one for a lander which has to do ademonstration without extensive prospecting to find "good" rock types, andwithout extensive beneficiation processing to isolate the desirable type ofsource material.  The only significant beneficiation desired is to separatethe smallest particle size fraction for use as feedstock.  This has noeffect on the ultimate reaction endpoint, but use of small particle sizeswill increase the reaction rate, since small particles have the highestsurface area to mass ratio.</P><P>An additional advantage of this process sequence is that it produces oxygenfrom the lunar regolith with high yield, and that it produces byproductmetals such as aluminum, titanium, and iron, and byproduct magnesium andcalcium oxide, which are either already purified or are relatively easy toseparate in pure form.  These byproducts are expected to be useful forother manufacturing processes.</P><P>Fluorine is brought to the moon in the form of potassium fluoride (KF).The KF is then electrolyzed to produce the required reactants, potassiumand fluorine.  Potassium fluoride has a higher affinity for fluorine thanany of the other elements except magnesium, calcium, sodium, and lithium.Thus, once the lunar regolith is reacted with fluorine to produce oxygen,metallic potassium can be added to the fluoride salt.  This will directlyreduce the iron, aluminum, and titanium fluorides to metallic iron,aluminum, and titanium.</P><P>Potassium will also reduce fluorosilane to silicon, but this step is notemployed, since it is in general undesirable to contaminate electronicsilicon with alkali ions.  Unless solar cell tests show that this isacceptable, potassium should not be allowed contact with the silicon.Potassium has a higher chemical exchange potential for the oxygen/fluorinesubstitution reaction than any of the remaining metals magnesium, calcium,sodium, and lithium.  This nominal temperature of this reaction is 520 &#176;C.Therefore, if potassium is oxidized to K<font size=1>2</font>O, by addingK<font size=1>2</font>O to theremaining metal fluorides, the metal fluorides are returned to the metaloxide and the potassium converted to potassium fluoride.  (This canprobably be done in a single step of adding oxygen to the mixture ofmetallic potassium with magnesium and calcium fluoride).  At the end of thisstep, all of the fluorine is in the form of potassium fluoride, therefore,only a single salt needs to be electrolyzed to recover the initialreactants, instead of a mixture of salts.  The potassium fluoride ismelted, at a temperature of 858 &#176;C, and the molten salt electrolyzed backinto the reactants potassium and fluorine.</P><P>This potassium reduction is a significant improvement over the alternativeof direct electrolysis of the salts to recover the fluorine, since directelectrolysis will require an electrolysis temperature as high as thecalcium fluoride melt temperature of 1423 &#176;C, which presents a difficultmaterials problem.</P><P>It is desirable to lower the electrolysis temperature even further, sincethe lower the temperature, the less corrosion of the electrodes will beexpected, and it is desirable to avoid the need for frequent replacement ofelectrodes.  The electrolysis temperature can be lowered by performing theelectrolysis in a eutectic salt with a lower melt temperature.  Because Kis extremely low on the electromotive series, very few choices areavailable which will reduce potassium at the cathode.  According toAlabyshev, Lantratov and Morachevskii <a href="#references">[6]</a>, Na,Ca, Sr, and Ba are lower onthe electromotive series at 700 &#176;C, and will not be reduced from the salt.Since fluorine is the most electronegative element on the electromotiveseries, that there is no choice available to replace fluorine as thecation.</P><P>Na, Ca, Sr, and Ba fluorides all form eutectics with KF.  The NaF/KFeutectic salt mixture at a molar ratio 60:40 NaF:KF, with a melttemperature of 710 &#176;C, seems to be the best choice.  An admixture of LiFwill lower the temperature further, although a significant Li component willresult in lithium instead of potassium electrolysis.  It is reasonable toexpect that a 5 percent (molar) admixture of LiF, which will lower thetemperature to 700 &#176;C, should be possible.</P><P>Ternary eutectics have even lower melt tempertures.  Apotassium/sodium/calcium fluoride eutectic mixture, with molar ratioapproximately 0.6:0.3:0.1 KF:NaF:CaF<font size=1>2</font>, will have a melttemperature as lowas 676 &#176;C.</P><P>The electromotive series in molten salts has a dependence on temperatureand on the composition of the salt <a href="#references">[6]</a>.  Furtherresearch may make itpossible to find a temperature and a salt mixture with a lower electrolysistemperature.</P><P>The process sequence has the disadvantage that magnesium, calcium, sodium,and lithium are not reduced to the metal by this process, but returned totheir original condition as oxides.  Sodium and lithium are only minorcomponents of the lunar soil.  Calcium and magnesium oxides makes up about20% of typical lunar soil, and leaving these unreduced would result inabout 15% reduction in oxygen production.</P><P>Except for the lost oxygen production if the calcium and magnesium oxidesare not reduced, it is not clear that these oxides are valuable in reducedform.  Calcium will be required in oxide form for glass manufacture(discussed in a <a href="glass-production.html">another document</a>).  Ithas also been proposed to make concreteout of lunar material; this also requires calcium oxide.  Thus, it is notof great significance that the process does not reduce calcium andmagnesium.</P><P>An alternative reduction strategy is to use lithium fluoride.  Lithium canbe separated from fluorine by electrolysis in a KF/LiF eutectic saltmixture at a temperature of only 492 &#176;C.  Lithium metal will reducemagnesium, sodium, and potassium fluoride to metal, leaving only calciumfluoride unreacted.  By use of lithium fluoride, the molten saltelectrolysis could be reduced from many elements to only two, lithium andcalcium.  If lithium oxide is then used to drive the reaction<nobr>CaF<font size=1>2</font> + Li<font size=1>2</font>O--> CaO + 2LiF</nobr>, this can be reduced to a single electrolysis.  However,this reaction exploits only a small difference in chemical potential,instead of the large difference exploited in the potassium substitutionreaction.  It is worth exploring to see whether the calcium/lithium oxideexchange occurs at a fast enough rate, and with a high enough recovery oflithium fluoride, for use as a production reaction.</P><P>It might be argued that fluorine is extremely reactive, and it will bedifficult to find materials in which to do the electrolysis.  However,electrolysis of molten fluoride salts is a high-throughput industrialprocess, used in the production of many materials.  The most well-knownfluoride electrolysis process is the Hall process for production ofaluminum, in which molten sodium-aluminum silicate ("cryolite") iselectrolyzed at 1000 &#176;C.  Seyboldt, et al, discuss some of the materialsissues involved.</P><h3>Silicon Production on the Moon</h3><P>A block diagram of the basic mass flow process for the silicon productionis shown in <a href="/adb/02/08/array-materials-refining.html#fig2">figure2</a>.  The power requirements listed are for ademonstration-sized system to produce a few grams of silicon.The process selected for this is to use fluorine extraction to segregatesilicon in the form of gaseous tetra-fluorosilane (SiF<fontsize=1>4</font>).</P><P><img src=/images/asi199600091.gif" alt"Figure 2: Block diagram ofsilicon and oxygen production steps" width=550 height=705><br><I>Figure2</I><P><ul><li>1A.

Thus, only a single solar furnace is required; therequired reaction chamber is simply rotated into the hot zone when it isrequired.  The solar dynamic ground-test demonstration, based on a powersystem originally designed for the Space Station Freedom, demonstratesmelting a LiF/CaF<font size=1>2</font> eutectic salt as well aslong-duration operation at 800&#176;C under simulated space conditions <a href="#references">[7]</a>.This design could easily beadapted to serve as the solar furnace required to produce the temperaturesrequired for this process.</P><P>The heating process will also evolve volatiles (primarily materialsimplanted from the solar wind) from the regolith.  These will includehydrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide, water, etc.  These may be valuable, andcan be captured after the heating but before the fluorine reaction isinitiated by use of condensors.</P><P>For the fluorination step, there may be some unreacted oxide if thereaction is not done in very high temperatures.  As long as these do notcontain fluorine, these can be considered slag and discarded.</P><P>The condensor must also separate the fluorosilane from the oxygen evolvedfrom the sample, and must also recover any unreacted fluorine.  This isprobably best done by fractional liquifaction (distillation).  Fluorosilanewill liquify at -86 &#176;C, oxygen at -183 &#176;C, and fluorine at -188&#176;C.  Sinceany manufacturing sequence to produce silicon for solar cells wouldundoubtedly also manufacture liquid oxygen for rocket fuel and otherapplications, liquifaction equipment will be present in any case, and it isonly necessary to adapt the equipment to allow progressive liquifaction ofthe individual gasses.  Since the boiling points of fluorine and oxygen areclose, it may be necessary to repeat the distillation process to adequatelypurify the product gasses and recover the fluorine reactant.</P><P>TiF<font size=1>4</font>, with a sublimation point of 284 &#176;C, alsosublimates at the reactiontemperatures of interest.  The TiF<font size=1>4</font> vapor must becondensed on a coldfinger before the vapors enter the main condensor.  If it is desirable toseparate the titanium out, this would be easy to do.  The titanium fluoridewill also include trace amounts of other volatile fluorides, as discussedlater; if it is necessary to produce titanium free of even tracecontaminents, it may have to be purified further, probably by additionalfractional distillation.</P><a name="references"><h3>References</h3></a><P>1.

For the purposes of clarification, as this is an issue directlyrelated the Aremis Project, water <I>has not</i> been proven to exist onthe moon. For many years, especially following  the science data returnedby the <a href="/adb/m/02/09/">Clementine probe</a>, scientists havehypothesised that ice may have frozen onto the areas of the Moon especiallyin the sourth polar basin, which were in permanent shadow. Evidence hasbeen inconclusive, although encouraging. There are several points to makewith regards to this issue:</P><ul type=circle><P><LI>There is no "lake" of water ice at the lunar south poleOnly a small portion of the umbra surrounding the lunar south pole isestimated to be composed of ices.  Scientists theorize that this iceis found as small, individual crystals in the interstices of regolithgrains spread over 15,500 square kilometers. If these ice crystalswere gathered together in one region, they are estimated to have thevolume of a small lake on Earth (60-120 thousand cubic meters or fourfootball fields sixteen feet deep).  Not an easily obtained resourceto say the least.</P><P><LI>The evidence is still pretty shaky.  The instrument (seenext bullet point) and technique used to detect the ice is not a finelycalibrated feat of engineering (it took a year to tease the data out). The ice could be primarily composed of a frozen substance other thanwater, or it might also be sulfur given the lack of clearidentification provided by the observational technique. Moreimportantly, Clementine employed the technique in question four times(twice over each lunar pole).  Only one pass over the lunar south poleprovided evidence of ice; the other pass over the lunar south pole didnot and neither did the two north pole passes.</P><P><LI> Clementine did not use any of its advanced Strategic DefenceInitiative Office/Ballistic Missile Defense Officetechnologies to make this particular discovery (except in a supportingrole for <a href="/adb/e/abbeviations.html#GNC">GNC</a> or computing). The"instrument" in question wasClementine's own communications antenna which "probed" the polarregions to a depth of roughly 50 feet.  The reflected X-bandtransmissions were received by the Deep Space Network.  Researcherswere able to make the ice claim because dry rock bounces radio wavesback with a 180 degree change in polarization whereas radio waves thathit ices or sulfur have their polarization changed by amountssignificantly smaller or greater than 180 degrees.  (Theterm "bi-static radar" is used to describe this technique, which refers tothe fact that the radio transmitter and receiver were physically removedfrom each other by some distance.)  The experimentas a whole was an afterthought once other mission objectives wereachieved and was probably made possible by <ahref="/adb/m/02/09/">Clementine 's</a> adaptablearchitecture.  There's an important lesson here about adaptabilityversus using the latest, specialized technologies.</P><P><LI>It is unlikely that this Clementine "I" discovery will bodewell for Clementine II funding because Clementine I was an SDIO/BMDOproject whereas Clementine II is USAF's baby.  A reporter asked thisquestion directly and this was the answer from Stu Nozette,Clementine's Deputy Mission Director.</P><P><LI>Although most of the region surrounding the lunar southpole is covered by shadow, a small region (maybe tens of squarekilometers in area) directly on top of the lunar south pole is not inthe umbra (the so-called Mt. Clementine).  Presumably, this regionwould be an ideal spot for collecting solar energy to mine and processthe lunar ice into hydrogen for shipping to other stations (such as <ahref="/adb/04/01/01/03/angus-bay.html">Angus Bay</a>) to be used for lifesupport.</P><P><LI>The lunar ice, if it exists, is probably not indigenous tothe Moon since Apollo samples indicate that the Moon never outgassedany volatiles like water. The origin of the theorized water would be cometsdepositing volatiles on cold traps, such as the permanently shaded regionsof the south polar basin and lava tubes.</P><P><LI>It has often been reported in the media that a possible use for icewould be electrolysing it into return propellant. However, the ArtemisProject has an official policy that rare and nonrenewable resources such as<a href="/adb/m/08/08/hydrogen.html">hydrogen</a> and <ahref="/adb/m/08/08/">other volatiles are too valuable to shoot out of arocket engine when there are other in-situ propellant combinationsavailable.</P></ul><P>In summary, the claim of ice is made on the assumption that someradio waves from an antenna during one pass over the lunar south polecame back with polarizations different from the 180 degrees typical ofdry rock. Although it's an indication of possible water ice on thelunar south pole, the evidence is far from conclusive (we still don'thave spectra of the lunar south pole) and the water ice, if it exists,is not waiting in a readily usable form. Confirmation will have towait until Lunar Prospector is launched.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Thu, Dec 5, 1996<br>Content by Brant Sponberg<ahref="mailto:blspon@gwis2.circ.gwu.edu">&lt;blspon@gwis2.circ.gwu.edu&gt;</a>, maintained by <AHREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>" is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar ResourcesCompany</a>.</font></body></html>

They have beendeveloped for minerals found in a oxygen- and water-rich atmosphere.They seem to fall into two broad categories, electrolytic methodsand chemical methods.  Chemical methods typically use large amountsof materials other than ore for processing, for example the use of limeand coal in the processing of iron.  These methods would requireimportation of these materials, unless an appropriate exo-LEOsubstitute can be found.  Electrolytic methods, on the other hand,use large amounts of electricity to force a chemical reaction.  Theytypically require large water baths, filled with noxious chemicals.But once the initial water is transported to the Moon, these techniqueswill likely be the best choice.</P><P>For each metal, I have summarized the important Terran methods, andsuggested modifications for the Lunar environment.  In mysuggestions, I have tried to limit the use of non-Lunar resources,most notably, hydrogen/water and carbon.  I have also assumed anabundance of energy (what do you expect?  The Moon has to havesomething to offer).  I have further assumed no special miningtechniques and no motherlode veins.  Just scoop up some regolith,and dump it in.</P><P>As an aside, as I studied the composition of the Lunar regolith,I discovered it was some nasty stuff.  As table 1 shows, the Moonis made of a very basic mixture of materials.  This brings to minda problem I have not run across before.  As these materials absorbwater, from small leaks in habitats as is inevitable, or if broughtinto a habitat, by construction design or accident, they will absorbwater at one molecule of water  per molecule of oxide.  Thesubsequent reactions will make a caustic solution, posing a dangerto the long term survival of some metals, plastics and fabrics.Imagine a slow drip from a not-quite perfect weld, just below acondenser.  Over the years, regolith that has been piled upon theshelter as shielding absorbs the water, and starts an electrolyticreaction (this is how salt causes cars to rust).  This will definitelyattack steel, and will eventually corrode aluminum.</P><P>Table 11:  Estimated Composition of  Moon Compared with Other Objects<table cellspacing=2 cellpadding=3><tr><td><B>Oxide</B></td><td><B>Bulk Moon</B></td><td><B>Terracrust</B></td><td><B>Mare basalts</B></td><td><B>Cl Meteorite</B></td></tr><tr><td>SiO<FONTSIZE=1>2</FONT></td><td>43.3-48.7%</td><td>45.0%</td><td>37.8-48.8%</td><td>33.3%</td></tr><tr><td>TiO<FONTSIZE=1>2</FONT></td><td>0.2-0.4</td><td>0.6</td><td>0.4-13.0</td><td>0.1</td></tr><tr><td>Al<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>O<FONTSIZE=1>3</FONT></td><td>3.7-7</td><td>24.6</td><td>5.3-14.4</td><td>2.4</td></tr><tr><td>FeO</td><td>11.3-13.9</td><td>6.6</td><td>10.7-22.3</td><td>34.0</td></tr><tr><td>MgO</td><td>25.3-33.4</td><td>6.8</td><td>5.7-20.0</td><td>23.4</td></tr><tr><td>CaO</td><td>3.4-6.1</td><td>15.8</td><td>6.3-12.5</td><td>1.9</td></tr><tr><td>Na<FONTSIZE=1>2</FONT>O</td><td>0.01-0.15</td><td>0.5</td><td>trace-1.0</td><td>1.1</td></tr><tr><td>K<FONTSIZE=1>2</FONT>O</td><td>~0.01</td><td>0.1</td><td>trace-0.3</td><td>0.1</td></tr><tr><td>Cr<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>O<FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT></td><td>0.3-0.4</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.2-0.9</td><td>0.5</td></tr></table><H3>Silicon (Si)</H3><P>I suspect that glass-blowing will become a big hobby on the Moon.All you need is sand (a.k.a. SiO<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>), heat and sparetime.  There are some important uses for silicon (grease, fiberglass), butI can'tthink of any that require large amounts of pure silicon, so I willignore this element.  Dumping of waste SiO<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>  from smeltingprocesses will be a problem on a Lunar colony. </P><H3>Iron (Fe)</H3><P>On Earth, iron is without question the most important metal.It holds up our buildings and transports oxygen to our brains.  But,unfortunately, translating iron smelting to the Moon will be difficult.The Terran process uses carbon monoxide to reduce iron oxides(mostly hydrated Fe<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>O<FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT> and Fe<FONTSIZE=1>3</FONT>O<FONT SIZE=1>4</FONT>) to the metal and carbon dioxide.Unfortunately, blast furnaces use coal as their CO source.  Carbondioxide can be converted to CO by reaction with hydrogen gas (wateris the other product), but humans will not produce enough CO<FONTSIZE=1>2</FONT> tosupport a large-scale smelting process (this may be a way to recyclewaste vegetable matter).</p><P>The next step in the process is the removal of silicon.  The Terranmethod uses lime (CaO).  While CaO is available in the regolith, it isabout 10% by mass of the amount needed.  Additionally, the resultant"calcium silicate slag" will be difficult to recycle.  Did I mention thatthe smelting process occurs at 500-1000&#176; F?  Anyway, the result ofthis process is pig iron.</P><P>While I intend for this treatise to cover only the metal extraction,not processing, I must point out that steel contains 0.05 to 2.0 % carbon.This means about 20 kg per metric ton of steel produced.  We may wantto take a step back to wrought iron.  All oxygen produced by this method(about 300 kg per metric ton of iron) ends up as carbon dioxide.  I haveyet to find reference to any electrolytic methods for the production ofiron.</P><H3>Aluminum (Al)</H3><P>Where iron is disappointing, aluminum is promising.  The standardmethod for production of aluminum is electrolysis, and it may be directlyconvertible to a Lunar environment.  First the bauxite (Al<FONTSIZE=1>2</FONT>O<FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT>) is dissolved in sodium hydroxide.Pure Al(OH)<FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT> is precipitated by bubbling CO<FONTSIZE=1>2</FONT> through the solution.  Purification at this step isconsidered easier than purification of the metal.</P><P>The Hall process is carried out in large iron pots, lined with carbon(used as cathodes).  In these are placed carbon anodes.  NaAlF<FONTSIZE=1>6</FONT> is addedand melted.  To this is added Al<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>O<FONTSIZE=1>3</FONT>.  The current reduces the oxide tothe metal, liberating oxygen.  The procedure is carried out at 1000&#176;C,and since Al melts at 660&#176;C, it collects as a liquid on the bottom of thecrucible.</P><P>I suspect that the direct addition of aluminum hydroxide would be fine,aside from the large plume of steam (and corresponding loss of energy)you would get.  I am not sure why cryolite (NaAlF<FONT SIZE=1>6</FONT>) isused along withthe oxide.  It may improve the conductivity of the solution.</P><H3>Sodium (Na), Potassium (K) and Calcium (Ca)</H3><P>The basic nature of the oxides of these metals, delinated above,suggests a method for removing these less-useful metals from theregolith.  Suspending the regolith in water will readily dissolve Na2O,K2O, and to a lesser degree MgO and CaO (lime) via the equations below:</P><table cellspacing=3 cellpadding=2><tr><td>CaO + H<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>O =Ca(OH)<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></td><td> </td><td>Na<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>O +H<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>O = 2 NaOH</td></tr><tr><td>K<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>O + H<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>O = 2 KOH</td><td></td><td>MgO + H<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>O = Mg(OH)<FONTSIZE=1>2</FONT></td></tr></table><P>The bound hydrogen could then be released by electrolysis of themelted hydroxide.  This was the commercial preparation for sodiumfor many years and should be applicable to the other hydroxides withvarying degrees of difficulty.  The oxides also readily absorb carbondioxide, and are used in </P><P>The metals themselves are near-useless in a oxygen- and water-filledenvironment, and are extremely soft, as well.  However, inthe near-vacuum of the Moon, new alloys or other uses may presentthemselves.</P><H3>Some additional points</H3><P>While it would be useful to have some regolith to experiment on,an approximation can be made.  I would volunteer, but I do not haveaccess to the refractory equipment required for these experiments.The chemicals are relatively cheap.</P><P>I am still trying to track down some NASA documents that mayprovide other suggestions for seporations techniques.  This is awork very much in progress.</P><P><br><B>References</B><FONT SIZE=2><ul><li>Reference Book of Inorganic Chemistry,  3rd ed.Latimer, W. M.;     Hildebrand, J. H.

NASDA came up with a system of lightweight trusses and a glass makingplant.  The glass plant operates in a vacuum.  It uses lunar soil to makeglass.  The plant is solar powered with a concentrating reflector and highlyautomated.  It can be operated from earth by telecherics (VR).</P><P>Fused silica trusses are also formed by the plant are 30 m. The trussesare mounted into the lunar surface.  The glass panels are hexagons about 20m in diameter.  The hexagons are pinned to the trusses.</P><P>Foamed ceramic is blown into the joints.  The closed cell foam is airtight.</P><H3>Construction</H3><P>Dust is scooped off the lunar plain and fed into the glass makingfacility.  Truss anchors are inserted into the underlayment. and a layerof foam is laid down on the evened surface.  Then, waste soil isdeposited on top of the foam.  Next, trusses are inserted into theiranchors, pinned there mechanically, and welded by laser (ceramic toceramic).  Finally glass is laid on the roof, mechanically fastened andwelded.  Then airtight ceramic foam is blown into the joints.</P><P>Walls are added last, but these are mobile and there are two layers.This allows continuous construction of the lunar city to occur, with theoutermost walls being removed and placed a little further out once newroofing is added.  Then the innermost walls are placed where the outerwalls were, forming an airlock.</P><P>The entire process occurs on a roving factory continuously.  The 'glasshead' once it completes an initial 'dot' then circles the dot in anarchimedes spiral... like a nautilus shell, building the city everlarger.</P><P>An entire species of microbes, plants, and animals are custom bred andused to seed the enclosed space.  Air and water are extracted from thelayer of 'waste' soil left after silica is extracted.  First, microbesbreak down the soil chemically.  Then fungi and simple unicellularorganisims specially bred for low pressure existence create a lowdensity high carbon dioxide atmosphere.</P><P>Once this is achieved, higher order plants then germinate and suck in theCO2, creating free oxygen and water vapor.  Just as there are weatherpatterns in the superdome, there are weather patterns here.</P><P>Eventually, after about 8 to 10 years, the place is ready for people.</P><P>The roof is very heavy duty silica.  It absorbs most radiation.  Thereare two panes and each pane is about 10 cm thick.  Occasionally the glassfactory installs a prebuilt airlock, brought from earth along with therest of the factory.  So spacecraft arriving from earth actually landon the roof of the 'moonbase' and descend through these airlocks.</P><P>The glass factory would also, as it continued its outward spiral, haveattachments to produce glass fiber and finished roadways.  Spreadthroughout the 'moonbase' would be raw materials and infrastructure thatcould sustain arriving settlers.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Thu, March 14, 1996<br>Content by William H.

<h2 align="center">2.6 Development of Space Habitats</H2>
<h2 align="center">Study on Inflatable Lunar Habitats</H2>
<P><HR><P>

<P>William Mook has prepared a number of studies on space development, some
of which relate directly to the <a href="/artemis.html">Artemis
Project</a>'s goals. This concept of an inflatable habitat could be a
possibility for expanding the pressurized space of Moonbase Artemis for
increased crew, or for <a href="/adb/02/07/lunacity-hotel.html">lunar
tourism</a>. He has posted a brief summary of his study:</P>

<P><HR><P>

<P>Polyester film has a yield strength of about 25,000 psi.  So a
reinforced polyester film blown to form a 60 foot diameter sphere would
need to be about 1/80 inch thick to sustain a 3.75 psi pressure.  You
would need about 1/20 inch thick film to sustain 14.70 psi pressure.</P>

<P>Assume an outer shell 1/80 inch thick, and an inner shell 1/80 inch
thick, separated by 2 inches.  The film is bonded together every 2 inches
or so by kevlar netting.  The space between the two films is filled with
lightweight polystyrene.</P>

<P>The whole sphere would inflate from a small pillbox type container.
Assuming 3.75 psi working pressure, the sphere would weigh about 1,275
lb.  The oxygen would weigh 2,225 lbs!  More than the container!</P>

<P>Five floors would be formed the same way, and deployed along with the
inflation of the spherical shell.  They would consist of 2 sheets of
polyester film separated by a kevlar reinforced polystyrene filler.</P>

<P>The poles of the sphere would be connected by a lanyard-deployed
continuous longeron coilable boom.  This would interconnect the five
floors.</P>

<P>Starting at the south pole of the 60 ft diameter sphere, the first floor
is 5 ft above the pole.  It is a circle 46 ft in diameter containing 1668
square ft of space.  The second floor is 15 ft above the south pole.  It
is a cirle 53.6 ft in diameter and 2262 sq. ft. in area.  The third floor
is largest, with an area of 2,750 sq. ft. and a diameter of 59.2 ft.  We
then repeat the same sequence in reverse.  The sixth panel is actually
the ceiling of the fifth floor.  The mass of these floors is 1,200 lbs.</P>

<P>The mass of the vertical shaft is 280 lb.</P>

<P>Assume the sphere is inflated on the lunar surface, from the nose of a
landing craft.  The craft is a cylinder 12 ft in diameter and 18 ft tall.</P>

<img WIDTH=480 HEIGHT=266 src="inflatable-study-1.jpg" alt="Diagram of
Inflatable Habitat">

<P>From the side of this cylinder is a 30 ft long, 10 ft diameter tube cut
into two sections.  The end of each section has attached to it an airlock
door made of diffusion bonded/superplastically deformed titanium.  The
weight of each airlock is 480 lb.  The weight of the outer tube, made of
polystyrene foam inflated polyester film is 360 lb.  Another
lanyard-deployed continuous longeron coilable boom connects each of the
airlock doors.  The innermost door is attached to the airframe of the
pillbox/spacecraft.  This spacecraft contains all the environmental
control systems as well as consumables.  It is airtight, and forms a link
between the airlocks and the station above.  It also is a control center
from which to control the station.  The longeron coilable boom weighs 150
lb.</P>

<P>So, the total station weighs:

<PRE>    1,275 lb. Shell
    2,225 lb. Air
    1,200 lb. Flooring
      280 lb. Vertical Boom
      150 lb. Horizontal Boom (walkways)
      480 lb. Titanium Airlock Door
      480 lb. Titanium Airlock Door
      480 lb. Titanium Airlock Door (attached to S/C)
      360 lb. Horizontal Airlock Tube
   ---------
    6,930 lb. SUB-TOTAL

    4,620 lb. Deploying Spacecraft & ECS Equipment
   ----------
   11,550 lb. TOTAL
</PRE>

<P>Once the balloon was inflated 24 tethers bonded to the outer surface
around the equator of the sphere would drop down.  These would be
anchored into the lunar surface.  Netting would be attached between these
tethers.  Lunar soil would then be piled up around the netting, forming
a radiation-proof area in vacuum under the sphere.  As the soil is piled
up it eventually covers the sphere, creating a pressurized radiation proof
area within.  Access is by the 30-ft tunnel connecting the outer terrain
with the central column.</P>

<P>There is a total of 10,610 usable square feet within the sphere.
Illumination is via fiber optics.  An inflatable parabolic mirror 1516 sq
ft. in area (44 ft diam.) concentrates sunlight into an optical fiber.
This fiber makes its way into centerline of the sphere and up the central
column.  There light is projected through diffusers to illuminate the
interior of the habitat.</P>

<P>The mirror is part of the equipment mass budget (it weighs less than
50 lb.) and is inflated upon arrival. The system provides illumination
during the 2-week long lunar day, and a high intensity bulb provides
illumination at night via the same optical fiber setup.</P>

<P>Power can be supplied by a small PV array operating at 1000 solar
intensity - at the focus of another 44 ft diameter mirror.  This provides
energy during the lunar day.  Propellants are used in fuel cells to power
the station during the lunar night.</P>

<P>Early inhabitants will occupy the station only 2 weeks every month.  Up
to 30 people may use the station at one time.  Only a 3-person skeleton
crew maintains watch at night.  All others depart to minimize energy
usage.</P>
<P><HR><P>

<H3>Critique</H3>
<I>Greg Bennett</I>

<P>I think William Mook made an error in calculating the diamter of the
first floor of the habitat.  It ought to be 33.2 feet in diamter instead of 46
feet.  (Looks like he used the diameter instead of the radius of the 60-foot
sphere.)  But nevertheless his description of this habitat shows quite well
how much habitable volume we can get from a simple inflatable.</P>

<P> The thickness he chose for the habitat pressure shell, and the reasons
for it, are abit worrisome.  If we're to have a bioregenerative life support
system based on terrestrial plant life, we'll want an atmosphere pretty close
to Earth normal; and using a pure oxygen atmosphere, even at low pressure, for
extended habitation is more of a cavalier risk than I'd be willing to take.
 The mass of the pressure shell will mostly likely be sized for impact loads
more than retaining pressure.  With nothing but that shell between you and
oblivion, you wouldn't want it to be so flimy that you'll puncture it if you
drop a screwdriver.  The real value of an inflatble pressure shell comes from
its packaging efficiency rather than its mass compared to, for example, an
aluminum tank.  This translate into launch mass because the parasitic weight
of packaging material will be less for a given volume.</P>

Remember that lunar lavatubes probably can be far larger thanthe (approximately) 25 meter diameter limit here on Earth. In addition, anynon-metallic native coating material can be expected to crack as it cools.Measurements of collapse trenches believed to be associated with lunarlavatubes indicate diameters of several hundreds of meters.  Given thissituaution, they evolved several ways to use lunar lavatubes.</P><P>First, it would make sense just to use them as shelter from radiation,temperature changes, dust, etc. for rigid or inflatable habitats broughtfrom Earth.  This alone could mean large cost reductions by reducing the"emplacement costs" otherwise neccessary for such shelter requirements.</P><P>Second, it was noted that lunar glass fibers might be combined with nativemeteoritic iron-nickel particles to produce larger habitats from resourceson the moon.  Dr. Goldsworthy showed the possibility of making very strongglass fibers on the Moon during the 1980s.  Native meteoritic metal couldbe refined by the "carbonyl" method, and the metal carbonyls used toproduce a thin, tough, airtight metal layer on the inside of a habitatwoven from lunar glass fibers.  These habitats, inside lavatubes, wouldincrease the available sheltered cubic volume greatly, and do it with cheapnative materials.</P><P>Finally, if it is required to have an entire town inside one of thesevery largetubes, with the entire tube sealed, then the meteoriticnickel-iron could be used again.  First use the carbonyl process to producethe puremetals in powdered form (micron-sized particles), as is done at Sudbury,Canada in producing much of the Earth's nickel supply.  Then, chill thepowder with <a href="/adb/04/03/10/04/oxygen-extraction.html">LunarLOX</a>.  Now, put it through a modified (bucketless) massdriver some tensof meters long and shoot it at the walls of the lavatube at a 90-degreeimpact.  With a velocity of about 2-3kilometers/sec., the powder particles will splatter/self-forge to the wallof the tube, building up a layer of metal that seals all but the smallestcracks.  To make sure that no leaks remain, we may now introduce gaseouscarbonyls into the tube, and use Laser Chemical Vapor Deposition with asolar powered laser's beam to get a final continuous film producing anairtight seal.</P><P>The advantage to these methods is in limiting the amount of molten materialthat is handled in any bulk, especially in the open, especially around anyhumans.  Either molten metal or molten rock/glass/lava are very corrosive.They require large amounts of energy to produce.  In the case of moltenaluminum, this means large amounts of electrical energy, which is already amajor bottleneck in space operations.  Carbonyls are non-corrosive liquidsat room temperatures and are reduced to metal and CO at about 200&#176;C at lowpressures.  The iron and nickel carbonyls require only carbon monoxide gaspassed over the native material at 160&#176;C to generate the carbonyl.  In thevacuum of space they should be much safer and cheaper to handle.</P><P>This should allow significant cost reductions to lunar base activitiesfairly soon after the first outpost is in place, or with sufficienttelerobotic preparation, at the first outpost itself.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sat, Mar 16, 1996<br>Content by Tom Billings <AHREF="MAILTO:itsd1@teleport.com">&lt;itsd1@teleport.com&gt;</A>, maintainedby <A HREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar Resources Company</a>.</font></body></html>

<P>A total solar eclipse seen from the moon should be an awesome sight.
Although the Earth is much larger than the primary disc of the sun, we'll
still be able to see sunlight transmitted through the atmosphere as a
prismatic sunrise encircling the entire globe; and the solar corona will
appear as prominences emanating from this rainbow ring. The footage of such
an event would be very valuable, if anyone was in the right place at the
right time.</P>

<P>One of the most fascinating phenomena of a total solar eclipse seen on
Earth is the shadowbands which occur just before totality.  These are
interference patterns from rays of sunlight peeking through the mountains
on the limb of the moon. They show up as moving diamonds of light on the
surface of the Earth.</P>

<P>I don't know if there will be a similar phenomenon during a total eclipse
viewed from the moon. I would think not, since Earth's atmosphere filters
and scatters the sunlight; however, focussing sunlight through the thin
bubble of atmosphere might cause other fascinating effects.</P>

Bennett</I></P><P><HR><P><P>A quarantine program is one occasionally suggested, both for the outwardand inward trip. While there are advantages and disadvantages to such aprogram, it is an area that merits further study.</P><P>Although for Apollo, NASA briefly had an inward-bound quarantine, theprogram was stopped after Apollo 12.  Atthat point they had learned that there was no detectable risk of importingnasty microbes from the moon.  Upon inspection of the Apollo samples, theydidn't find any life forms or viruses on the moon, not even much in the wayof organic molecules.  Carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen -- the stuff of life-- are very scarce in the lunar regolith.</P><P>On the other hand, we might need to consider a quarantine for theout-bound side of the trip, to avoid importing microbes from Earth to themoon.  The local population will have weakened immune systems from theirstay in isolation, and a local epidemic could wreak havoc on productivity.Also, in the closed environment of a spacecraft, the risk of contagion ishigh, and a virus could ruin the trip for many of the passengers. Finally,a quarantine would provide the perfect opportunity to carry out trainingand safety instruction, as well as preparation for any useful scientificwork the tourists might be able to do.</P><P>Despite its advantages, a quarantine would be difficult and tedious.We'd need to quarantine anentire shipload of people together for four straight weeks prior to theflight.  That allows for two weeks to share and incubate microbes amongthat small population, and then another two weeks for their bodies todestroy the microbes so that no live viruses or bacteria would be importedinto the lunar community.</P><P>Four weeks of quarantine would probably cut way down on touristtraffic, so it may be a bad idea. While there will probably be enoughdemand to fill the seats even with the quarantine, it will become more andmore unacceptable as space travel becomes more routine and frequent.</P><P>However, we can at least controlimporting vermin into the lunar environment.  Australia has been fairlysuccessful at this just by spraying airline cabins for bugs and checking onpassengers' behavior before the flight.  We could use even more effectivemeasures by inspecting and disinfecting baggage and cargo, and evenexposing cargo to zero pressure during the flight to the moon.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sat, Apr 15, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

<h2 align="center">SSTO Program Balance Sheet</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Gregory R. Bennett</I></P>
<P><HR><P>

<P>About that SSTO a consortium of Japanese companies is proposing:
They're talking about a 2-orbit flight for $20,000. This table is from one
of their papers on the subject:</P>

<pre>
    Number of vehicles produced                  50
    Price per vehicle                   $ 1 billion
    Trips per year                              300
    Useful lifetime of spacecraft                10

    Per vehicle, per trip:
       Amortization cost                  $ 430,000
       Fuel                                 160,000
       Miscellaneous costs                  200,000
                                            -------
           Total                          $ 790,000 per flight

       Passengers per flight                     50
       Cost per passenger                 $  15,800
       Passengers per year                  750,000
       Gross revenues per year         $ 12 billion</pre>

<P>The money figures were translated from Yen to Dollars using a factor of
100 Yen to the dollar. Amortization cost is based on 5% per year cost of
capital in Japan; which is reasonable in their market. These numbers
assume a fleet of 50 vehicles, each making a 2-orbit trip (about 2 hours in
orbit), 300 days a year. In other words, a typical small airline operation
in terms of operations. Each vehicle would make 3,000 trips in its design
lifetime; this is typical for big airplanes.</P>

<P>The titles at the end of the chart are a bit confusing. They're talking
about a ticket price of $20,000, so let's look at it again with that in
mind:</P>

<pre>       Price per passenger                $  20,000
       Cost per passenger                 $  15,800
       Profit per passenger                   4,200
       Passengers per year                  750,000
       Gross revenues per year         $ 15 billion
       Total cost per year               12 billion
       Net profit per year                3 billion</pre>

<P>Give an initial investment of $50 billion and an income of $15 billion
per year for 10 years, IRR = 27%. Not too shabby, if you happen to have
$50 billion lying around.</P>

<P>According to Tom Rogers, the Japanese companies involved are:</P>

<ul type=circle>
<li>Japanese Rocket Society
<li>All Nippon Airways
<li>Fuji Heavy Industries
<li>Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries
<li>Kawasaki Heavy Industries
<li>Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
<li>Nisson Moto
<li>Shimizu
<li>Teisan K. K.
<li>Tokyo Broadcasting System
<li>Japan Aircraft Development Company</ul>

<h2 align="center">LEO Stockpiling of Lunar Voyage Fuel</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Gregory R. Bennett</I></P>
<P><HR><P>

<P>The primary drawback to using many SSTO rockets to stockpile fuel in
Earth orbit is the number of flights required.</P>

<P>Suppose the useful load of an SSTO is 5% of its gross lift-off weight,
and its mass ratio is 90%. (That's optimistic, but it demonstrates the 
point.) Then, to completely refuel the rocket in LEO, we would need 18
flights to carry fuel tanks to orbit, and then one more to launch the one
we're going to send to the moon.</P>

<P>Now, using the preliminary numbers for the proposed <a
href="/adb/04/02/07/01/02/business-plan.html">commercial SSTO</a>, each
launch costs us about $4 million. So those 19 launches would cost $76
million. That means our cost per passenger (assuming 50 paying passengers)
would be $1.52 million, which is a tad higher than the $96,000 we were
shooting for.</P>

<P>Hence, the argument that we should develop the <a
href="/adb/04/03/10/04/oxygen-extraction.html">lunar fuels</a> industry
first, and then open a gas station in LEO. We're using lunar resources as
a leveraging technology, and its a really useful lever!</P>

<h2 align="center">Artemis Data Book</H2>
<h2 align="center">2.7.1.1 Multiple-Vehicles Scenario</H2>
<h2 align="center">Economics and Efficiency of SSTO to the Moon</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Gregory R. Bennett</I></P>
<P><HR><P>

<P>The idea of sending an <a href="/adb/02/07/ssto-business-plan.html">SSTO
to the moon</a> is reduce the program cost.
Two vehicles would be far more efficient from an engineering standpoint.
Three would be even better.  Five, with space stations in Earth orbit and
lunar orbit, would almost be the epitome of engineering efficiency, but we
could do even better with multi-stage rockets at each end with fly-back
boosters; perhaps 10 vehicles total.</P>

<P>Now think about the development and operating costs.  That leads us to
the SSTO, which from an engineering standpoint is horrendously inefficient.
The same approach leads us to landing an atmospheric vehicle on the moon,
complete with wings and heat shields and ghu knows what else we don't need
on the moon.</P>

<P>The most energy-efficient intercontinental passenger transport
aircraft would be a superduper 747 that never lands, maintained and
refueled in flight.  Launching a Boeing 747 isn't quite as inefficient as
launching a rocket, but it's close; we'd be far better off accelerating and
lifting all that mass only one time.  We could even leave off the landing
gear and all those heavy flaps, too.  We'd get passengers there by flying
them up in smaller aircraft that shuttle between the big airplane and the
airport.  Conceivably, this could be done; but imagine the cost those
vehicles and their supporting systems.  Imagine the problems of
transferring passengers and baggage from one airplane to the other.</P>

<P>Back to technical thoughts.  We can worry about the weight of the heat
shield when we have some real numbers to deal with.  A large team of
Japanese companies are working on a vehicle very similar to the one
envisioned, and we can assume they've done their homework.  Before we
abandon
the initial concept, let's crank some numbers and find out out where we
are.  Once that is done, we can worry about refining the concept.</P>

<P>But always, always, always close the loop on cost.  It doesn't matter if we
burn 1,000 times as much oxygen as we could with the best engineering
approach.  Liquid oxygen is cheap; incredibly cheap to buy today (less than
half the cost of gasoline, certified for hospital use), and mind-bogglingly
cheap if make and store it ourselves.  The only problem with Earth's oxygen
is that it's inconveniently located at the bottom of a gravity well.  Tanks
and sheet metal are cheap, too.  So the size of the vehicle does not drive
cost nearly as much as you'd think.  The number of vehicles and the number
of unique parts is by far the biggest factor.</P>

<P>The size of vehicle, however, is why we picked a nice, relatively
isolated place like Groote Eylandt, Australia, as a launch site.  A floating
dry-dock launch facility sounds to me like the least expensive way to get
these things into orbit.  After the flight they land back in the water and
we move the dry-dock under them for the next launch.</p>

<P>Having put a few years of thought into this one, we still haven't found
a less costly way of getting lots of passengers to the moon and back, and
by putting it all in one vehicle, we can do it in comfort and style.</P>


<h3>Why don't we do something like this for the reference mission?</h3>

<P>The mission objectives and the basic assumptions are different.  For
the initial flights, we want to land a heavy exploration base, as heavy as
we can get it, on the moon and leave it there.  Each subsequent development
flight will be different, so at first we can't take advantage of the
economies of scale in producing our spacecraft.  We'll get way ahead using
off-the-shelf modular components like the <a
href="/adb/04/03/06/01/">SPACEHAB module</a>, but there will
be some new design work for each mission.</P>

<P>With the commercial SSTO, we want to carry as many passengers to the
moon and bring them back, do it repeatedly, and offer each passenger the
same level of comfort.  Most important, we assume we've developed the
infrastructure on the moon so we can refuel the SSTO in Earth orbit without
having to make 25 more flights from Earth just to fill the tanks.  That
<a href="/adb/04/03/10/04/">lunar oxygen</a> business is the leveraging
factor that makes the cost-effective transportation system work.</P>

<P>Once the lunar community is ready to get into heavy manufacturing,
then we can start thinking about spacecraft that stay on orbit and huge
Earth-orbiting <a href="/adb/02/07/lunacity-hotel.html">hotels</a>.</P>

<P>We've heard the argument many times before that we should first
develop the Earth-orbit facilities, and then worry about going on the moon.
But that's doing it backwards!  We need to go to the mines and dig out the
metal first, and the least expensive way to get that material to Earth
orbit is to start on the moon.</P>

<P>In the orginal scenario, the mass to moon was the entire dry mass of the
vehicle plus passengers and other payload and external tanks. This may turn
out to be infeasible. I submit that it will be infeasible as long as we
attempt to bring the tanks and engines required for the Earth-to-LEO trip
along for the ride. Thus I think some kind of staging in LEO is
necessary.</P>

<P>The mission scenario I envision is as follows:</P>

<H3>Option 1: One SSTO</H3>

<P>A very large SSTO launches to LEO and rendezvouses with tank farm. Once
there, its payload (a fueled LEO-LS vehicle) separates and mates with
required O2 tanks. It TLIs and lands on Moon. Passengers disembark (or stay
on board, if it's nice enough and a <a
href="/adb/02/07/lunacity-hotel.html">Lunar Hotel</a> doesn't exist yet).
Eventually it refuels and lifts off, TEIs and then EOIs where it drops off
O2 for next mission at tank farm, and re-mates with its massive SSTO tanks
and engines and reenters and lands.</P>

<H3>Option 2: Two (or n) SSTOs:</H3>

<P>The SSTO is basically a Earth LEO workhorse. It can either launch the
LEO-LS vehicle with some fuel, or just fuel. H2 is stockpiled with the O2
at the LEO tank farm, and whenever a LEO-LS vehicle comes up, it grabs fuel
it needs and heads for the moon. When it returns to the tank farm, it drops 
of O2 tanks, and gets back into its (or a waiting) big SSTO shell and 
reenters and lands.</P>
<br>

<P>The SSTO in option one would be about 2 (or n) times as big as that in
option two. However, in option 1, you could put most to all brains,
power, etc., in the LEO-LS vehicle, so what was left in LEO was really a big
shell. It could perhaps get whatever residual power to keep itself warm,
etc., while it waited from solar arrays on the tank farm, or from within
itself. Eventually, with once-per-day operations, the big beast that
went up in the morning could bring back the LEO-LS vehicle that was
coming back that afternoon, and you could actually reduce the number of
really big SSTOs you have to build, as the turn-around time wouldn't be
the 4-5 days or round trip to the moon, but one day of round trip to LEO.
Conceivablly you would only need a fleet of a few big SSTOs, albeit with
more, smaller LEO-LS vehicles.</P>

<P>Are you designing two vehicles? Yes, which is certainly a problem
(<NOBR>= expense</NOBR>), but at least the space one comes back to Earth
each time for maintenance. I think the integration issues are easier than 
a two stage to orbit, since separation while in orbit is simpler than 
while in the atmosphere. In addition, I think this is feasible, while I 
think the one vehicle solution is not.</P>

<P>Also, you get a big LEO booster for free. You can put pretty large
things into LEO with such a beast.</P>

<P>Imagine the passenger experience:</P>

<P>You get into this cylinder thing in Australia. Lots of shaking, a bit of
extra gravity, then none. A few hours later you rendezvous with the tank
farm. You watch out the window (perhaps from a lounge on the farm) [yeah, 
I know I just threw another space station into the picture... but maybe 
it's the LEO staging base that we were talking about on art-list expanded 
somewhat, and you can look at pictures of the contruction of the original 
Artemis vehicle while your personal moon vehicle is being mated to its 
tanks.] You reboard (or maybe you never left) and move slowly away from 
the tank farm, dwarfed by the huge hulk of a ship you just came up from 
Earth on. A bit of acceleration and you're on your way to the moon. A 
couple weeks later, you're back, and again watch your little LEO-LS 
cruiser being docked to a waiting big ol' thing to transport you back to 
Earth.</P>

<P>I think that would work on the "looks neat" criteria...</P>

<P><HR><P>

<P>About that SSTO a consortium of Japanese companies is proposing:  They're talking about a 2-orbit flight for $20,000.  This table is from one of their papers on the subject:</P>

<pre>    Number of vehicles produced                  50
    Price per vehicle                   $ 1 billion
    Trips per year                              300
    Useful lifetime of spacecraft                10

    Per vehicle, per trip:
       Amortization cost                  $ 430,000
       Fuel                                 160,000
       Miscellaneous costs                  200,000
                                            -------
           Total                          $ 790,000 per flight

       Passengers per flight                     50
       Cost per passenger                 $  15,800
       Passengers per year                  750,000
       Gross revenues per year         $ 12 billion</pre>

<P>The money figures were translated from Yen to Dollars using a factor of 100 Yen to the dollar.  Amortization cost is based on 5% per year cost of capital in Japan; which is reasonable in their market.  These numbers assume a fleet of 50 vehicles, each making a 2-orbit trip (about 2 hours in orbit), 300 days a year. In other words, a typical small airline operation in terms of operations.  Each vehicle would make 3,000 trips in its design lifetime; this is typical for big airplanes.</P>

<P>The titles at the end of the chart are a bit confusing.  They're talking about a ticket price of $20,000, so let's look at it again with that in mind:</P>

<pre>       Price per passenger                $  20,000
       Cost per passenger                 $  15,800
       Profit per passenger                   4,200
       Passengers per year                  750,000
       Gross revenues per year         $ 15 billion
       Total cost per year               12 billion
       Net profit per year                3 billion</pre>

<P>Give an initial investment of $50 billion and an income of $15 billion per year for 10 years, IRR = 27%.  Not too shabby, if you happen to have $50 billion lying around.</P>

<P>According to Tom Rogers, the Japanese companies involved are:</P>

<ul type=circle>
<li>Japanese Rocket Society
<li>All Nippon Airways
<li>Fuji Heavy Industries
<li>Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries
<li>Kawasaki Heavy Industries
<li>Mitsubishi Heavey Industries
<li>Nisson Moto
<li>Shimizu
<li>Teisan K. K.
<li>Tokyo Broadcasting System
<li>Japan Aircraft Development Company</ul>

Weneed a more accurate analysis of this concept to firm up the extendedfinancial forecast.  (If the finances work, the rest of the program willwork.)</P><P>If you're interested in helping with the technical work for theconceptual design, contact Adam London, email <Ahref="mailto:aplondon@mit.edu">&lt;aplondon@mit.edu&gt;</a>.<H3>Commercial Flight Concept</H3><P><img src="http://www.asi.org/images/asi199600022.gif" align="left" width="173" height="108">We assume someone has developed a passenger-carrying SSTO rocket capable of achieving low Earth orbit.  This vehicle is also designed to support its crew and passengers for up to 3 days before returning to Earth.  This is the nominal mission that several companies around the world are considering.  On a regular flight the passengers would get two orbits of the Earth, three hours in space, for a ticket price of about US$20,000.  Our goal is to change that to a full two-week vacation on the moon while keeping the price of the tour package down to a point that is commercially viable.</P><P><img src="http://www.asi.org/images/asi199600023.gif" align="right" width="173" height="108">About 85% of the weight of this vehicle at launch is oxygen used for propulsion.  By refueling the vehicle in Earth orbit with oxygen mined from the moon, we extend its range so that it can fly all the way to the moon and land.  On the moon, the rocket's passengers disembark for their vacation at the <a href="/adb/02/07/lunacity-hotel.html">Luna City Hotel</a>.  Those passengers will take a later flight back.  The rocket is again refueled on the moon and picks up returning passengers for the flight back to Earth.</P><P>You can see from the scale of the passenger deck that this is a very large rocket, perhaps 250 feet high.  Its shape is driven by reentry aerodyamics.  Although this type of vehicle would be notoriously inefficient in the eyes of a rocket scientist, their development costs and simplicity of operation are pure beauty to the accountant who has to watch the bottom line.</P> <P><img src="http://www.asi.org/images/asi199600021.gif" width="364" height="245"></P><P>Launch from Groote Eylandt in Australia, as shown in the business plan below, is part whimsy and part logic.  Groote Eylandt is near the equator, which reduces the delta-V required to achieve orbit.  It is near a good-sized city which can handle passenger accommodation before and after the flight, and provide a cultural center for people working at the space port.  The island itself has some facilities, for the Australian armed forces.  And it is in a body of water large enough to allow this behemoth to take off and land without severe environmental impact.  </P><P>Many other places on Earth fit these same criteria; for now we just need one place that will work.</P><H3>Commercial Flight Business Plan</H3><P>Here are some preliminary assumptions to get things started. Nitpickingthe assumptions isn't as important as setting up the methods for analyzing the problem.  First we need to set up the financial model for theoperation.

<HTML><HEAD> <TITLE>2.7  What is the Luna City Hotel like?</TITLE> </HEAD><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><!-- Artemis Data Book section 2.7 Recreation and Tourism --><!-- file: /adb/02/07/lunacity-hotel.html --><!-- Keywords: mass marketing money payment funds  --><h2 align="center">Artemis Data Book</H2><h2 align="center">2.7 Recreation and Tourism</H2><h2 align="center"> What is the Luna City Hotel like?</H2><P><HR><P><P> Go forward in time to the point where we're manufacturing living quartersfrom lunar materials and can build a large tourist hotel.  A 50-passenger SSTOlaunches from Earth with its crew of 4 (two pilots, two flight attendants).The SSTO gets refueled in LEO and flies on to the moon.  There it exchangesits passengers for folks coming home after a week of fun and play.</P><P> Rethinking the amortization cost of the SSTO vehicles, the cost of the one-week trip goes up to $96,000.  That's amortizing it on Japanese terms, wherethe cost of money is about 5% per year.  A group of Japaense companies isalready working on this vehicle, so it has a chance of happening.  They'retalking about a fleet of 50 vehicles, each making one 2-orbit flight 300 daysa year.  In other words, airline-style operations.</P><P> To house all those tourists, we'll need a 350-bed hotel, plus perhapsanother12 beds for the transient flight crews.  We'll need racks of space suits sofolks can play outside, and a fleet of pressurized buses to take them ontours of the sights.</P><P> Assuming a packing rate of 2 people per room, we need 175 rooms for thetourists and maybe another 12 for the support troops; 187 guest rooms total.</P><P> Let's go luxury class.  On Earth, maids are expected to do 20 rooms aday, sowe need 10 maids.  How many maintenance folks?  5 sounds right.  3 managers, 3desk clerks, 1 general manager.  32 folks working food service. 12 working thebars.  2 working the souvenir counter.  18 tour guides.  Total staff: 86.</P><P> Making some assumptions about how the staff shares rooms, we're up to 230rooms.</P><P> The staff doubles as security.  Who's gonna break into a hotel on the<I>moon</I>?And if folks steal our towels for souvenirs, they'd better leave an equal massof good Earth stuff behind or they won't make their weigh-in for the returntrip.</P><P> To feed all these people, we'll need quite an agriculture industry;trees andbees and plants and ants and worms and birds because they're pretty; cattleand chickens and a flock of smelly sheep.  Tours of the lunar farms areincluded in the package.</P><P> By the time we're done, we'll be up to a total population of 500, and that'sjust for the hotel.</P><P> The average staff member stays a year and costs us $200,000 a year, dividedevenly between transportation costs and burdened labor rate.  We're spending$82,000 a day for staff, or $234 per paying guest per day.

Landis</I></P><P><HR><P><h3>Abstract</h3><P>Silicon, aluminum, and glass are the primary raw materials which will berequired for production of solar arrays on the moon.  A process sequence isproposed for producing these materials from lunar regolith,consisting of separating the required materials from lunar rock withfluorine.  The fluorine is brought to the moon in the form of potassiumfluoride, and is liberated from the salt by electrolysis in a eutectic saltmelt.  Fluorosilane produced by this process is reduced to silicon by aplasma reduction stage; the fluorine salts are reduced to metals byreaction with metallic potassium.  Fluorine is recovered from residual MgFand CaF<font size=1>2</font> by reaction with K<font size=1>2</font>O.</P><h3>Background</h3><P>Solar arrays produced on the moon would have many uses for spaceindustrialization.  First, it would allow expansion of power production forlunar facilities with a minimum of material required from the Earth.  Thiscould be useful in the ramping up of production of lunar resources (forexample <a href="/adb/04/03/10/04/oxygen-extraction.html">oxygen</a>) orfor other industrial-scale operations, such as poweringa mass-driver to deliver resources.  Lunar production could also be usefulfor manufacture of solar arrays for other space applications, includingsatellites and solar-electric propulsion vehicles, since the Delta-V oflaunching from the lunar surface is considerably less than that oflaunching from the surface of the Earth, and hence lunar-produced solararrays could be lower in cost than Earth produced arrays.  <ahref="#fig1">Figure 1</a> showsnear-term applications of lunar-produced solar arrays <ahref="#references"><a href="#references">[1]</a>.</P><img src="/images/asi199600090.gif" alt"Figure 1: Near-term uses oflunar-derived solar arrays" width=450 height=227 align=right><!-- Can you fix the image number for this? --><P>In the longer term, lunar produced solar arrays would be useful for theproposed production of solar power satellites which produce power in orbitfor transmission to other users in space, or ultimately for transmission tothe Earth's surface.  An alternate version of the orbital power concept isto produce the electricity by solar arrays directly on the lunar surface,using the moon itself as a large-area platform for beaming the power to theEarth.</P><P>These applications have been widely discussed elsewhere.  The details ofthe process of lunar production of solar cells, on the other hand, have notbeen widely addressed.</P><P>Earlier work on this subject is in references <ahref="#references">[1-3]</a></P><h3>Solar Cell Production</h3><P>Of the many materials used to make solar cells, only silicon is found inabundance on the moon.  Fortunately, silicon solar cells have the largestmanufacturing base of any of the solar cell materials.  For a demonstrationlander, the first requirement would be to demonstrate manufacture ofrelatively pure silicon from lunar resources.  Since this is the major masscomponent of a solar cell, Si production would be the first step to showingsolar cell manufacture is possible.  In addition, it would be necessary toproduce aluminum and glass from lunar materials.</P><P>Silicon could be used to produce any of several kinds of solar cells:Amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cells.  These are normally produced by aplasma deposition process exactly like the one proposed.  This will requirea small amount of hydrogen to make the electrical properties acceptable (infact, the material is more accurately labelled amorphous silicon:hydrogen).This will also require a substrate or superstrate for deposition, discussedlater.  Efficiency will be in the range of 5 to 10%.</P><P>Amorphous silicon has the advantage of being highly radiation tolerantcompared to other cell technologies <a href="#references">[4]</a> (althoughsensitive to degradationby low-energy electrons and by ultraviolet light).  It may also be possibleto make extremely lightweight a-Si arrays, although this will require alightweight substrate, which is not produced by the process sequencesdiscussed here <a href="#references">[5]</a>.</P><P>The hydrogen incorporation in amorphous silicon solar cells is typically inthe range of 5 to 10 atomic percent.  5 atomic percent of hydrogencorresponds to about 0.2% composition by mass, so this is not a largefraction.  The average mass fraction of hydrogen in Apollo lunar soilsamples is 50 micrograms per gram, representing a hydrogen to silicon ratioof 0.02 percent by mass.  Since the primary silicon usage in manufacturinga-Si:H cells will probably be for the glass superstrates, the hydrogencontent of the soil is probably sufficient for solar cell production, ifthe entire hydrogen content of the soil can be conserved for use.Alternately, the required amounts of hydrogen are so small that it isprobably feasible to bring the hydrogen from Earth, or to scavange wastehydrogen, for example, from residual propellants left in the tanks oftransfer vehicles after landing on the moon.</P><P>Polycrystalline thin-film silicon solar cells on a foreign substrate.  Thiswill be either a plasma deposition process, or by a thermally-activatedchemical-vapor deposition, but in this case the silicon is recrystallizedafter deposition <a href="#references">[6]</a>.  Using a solar furnace at1500 suns,recrystallization has been demonstrated with a time required of 5 seconds<a href="#references">[7]</a>.  No hydrogen is needed, but to date very fewthin-film silicon cellson foreign substrate cells have very high efficiencies.  Severalresearchers have produced 10% efficiencies (by a somewhat differentprocess), and the best efficiencies reported are about 12% AM0, for cellsdeposited on a proprietary ceramic substrate <a href="#references">[8]</a>.</P><P>Theoretical models <a href="#references">[9]</a> indicate that thinsilicon solar cells have thepotential for both extremely high efficiency, and for extremely goodradiation tolerance.  However, because of the material quality ofrecrystallized polycrystalline silicon, it is unlikely that efficienciesanywhere near the theoretical limit of 24% could be achieved.  10%efficiency is a more reasonable goal.</P><P>Conventional crystal silicon solar cells (or macro-polycrystalline solarcells)  This will require an additonal step to produce wafers.  The vacuumfloat-zone process produces single crystal material of the highest quality.This requires producing the initial silicon in the form of a rod.  Thiscan be done by plasma decomposition onto a thin wire in the conventionalSiemens process.  The rod is then melted in a travelling zone from one endto the other.  This recrystalized rod is then sliced into wafers.  Thedisadvantage of this process is that the crystal growth, wafering, andpolishing are difficult, energy intensive steps which require heavymachinery and also result in significant wastage of material.</P><P>Terrestrial production of solar cells often uses polycrystalline siliconwith large crystal grains.  This is also sometimes (inaccurately) called"semi-crystalline;" I will use the term macrocrystalline here todistinguish the material from the thin-film polycrystalline materialdiscussed earlier.  Macrocrystalline material is produced by allowingmolten silicon to cool under controlled conditions in a mold.  This is alower cost and faster process than single crystal growth, but neverthelessis energy intensive and requires slicing and polishing of wafers, whichresults in waste.  For these reasons, it is suggested that amorphous orpolycrystalline Si on a foreign substrate will be preferable technologies.<h3>Solar array production</h3><P>Once silicon has been refined, it is necessary to make the additionalmaterials required to make solar cells and to form these solar cells intoarrays.  Solar array production will require:</P><ol><lI>Substrate or superstrate.<P>The substrate or superstrate provides structural support for the array.For a substrate, some sort of lunar glass will probably do.  For asuperstrate, the glass will have to be transparent.  Note that it is asignificantly more difficult task to produce transparent glass than it isto simply produce glass; this is discussed later.</P><P>a-Si solar cells have also been made with a stainless-steel substrate; thismay be relatively simple to make on the moon.</P><lI>Ohmic contact material:<P>p-type contact:<br>Aluminum, which is a p-type dopant, will work as a p-typecontact.</P><P>n-type contact:<br>A conductor is required which will make ohmic contact to the silicon.  Forcrystalline silicon, aluminum works as an ohmic contact, but the processsequence must keep the cell below the 577 &#176;C Al-Si eutectic point at alltimes after contact deposition.  A better alternative may be use oftitanium silicide.  The classic space solar cell contact for silicon solarcells is titanium/palladium/silver.  The titanium forms titanium silicide,which contacts the cell, the palladium forms a humidity barrier thatprevents oxidation of the titanium, and the silver serves as a solderableconductor.  In space, the palladium would be unnecessary.  Any conductivemetal should be usable as the conductor.  Titanium silicide is proposedhere as a substitute for pure titanium as the conductor, since the Ti/Sireaction, if unimpeded by depletion of the titanium, will eat through thethin emitter of the cell.</P><lI>Doping Materials<P>To produce a solar cell, it is necessary to be able to dope thesemiconductor to both p and n type conductivity.</P><P>P-type doping uses elements from group III of the periodic table.  Boron ismost commonly used.  Of the p-dopants choices from lunar materials, Al isthe most abundant.  Since this is also used for other portions of theprocess, this will be assumed here.</P><P>N type doping requires a group V element, which may be difficult to producefrom lunar material.  The n-type dopants for silicon are P, As, and Sb, allof which are relatively uncommon on the moon.  Phosphorus is a "minor"constituant of the lunar surface, present in greatest concentration inKREEP materials, where concentration of 0.1% to 0.3% is typical .  Smallfragments of material have up to 2% concentration.  Fortunately, thephosphorus requirement as a silicon dopant is very small.  P doping istypically on the order of 1E<font size=1><sup>19</sup></font> per cm<fontsize=1><sup>3</sup></font>, or about 0.02 atomic percent.  Itis needed only in the emitter layer of a silicon solar cell, typically only0.1 to at most 1 micrometer thick.  For a silicon cell of 100 micrometerthickness, this makes the phosphorus requirement only a millionth of thesilicon requirement.  This is low enough that for small production, it isprobably worth bringing the P from Earth.</P><P>An alternative is to make a Schottky-barrier cell, although Schottky cellshave not demonstrated the high efficiency possible with pn junctions.</P><li>Front surface radiation protection <a href="#references">[can be sameas superstrate]</a><P>Even radiation-tolerant a-Si cells will require at least a thin protectionlayer to keep low-energy electrons and protons away.  Glass is the bestchoice.  SiO<font size=1>2</font>, TiO<font size=1>2</font> and/or Al<fontsize=1>2</font>O<font size=1>3</font>, are possible alternativechoices.</P><li value="4a">For an amorphous silicon cell, a front transparent conductor istypically used.  ZnO, SnO<font size=1>2</font>, In<fontsize=1>2</font>O<font size=1>3</font> and CdS are typical choices.  None ofthese are abundant on the moon.  If a-Si is chosen, I will suggest use of amicrocrystalline silicon front layer, with an Al or TiSi contact layer.</P><lI>Interconnects<P>Interconnects are used to connect one cell to the next in series, forprocesses using separate cells.  (Interconnection integral with the cellcontacts for a-Si technologies.)  Space solar arrays typically usesilver-coated molybdenum interconnects, with either silver or copper usedas alternate choices.  For lunar production, aluminum is again the mostlikely choice, or metallic calcium.</P><li>Wiring.<P>Solar arrays require wires to conduct the power to the user.  In someapplications, a considerable length of transmission wire may be required.Aluminum is again the most likely choice, with an alternate suggestionbeing metallic calcium.</P><P>Thus, other than silicon, the two main components needed for solar cellproduction will be aluminum and glass.  Aluminum will also be useful forstructural elements of a solar array.</P><h3>Silicon Production: Refining of Regolith</h3><P>Silicon cannot be manufactured by the industrial processes used on Earth,of course, if for no other reason than silicon production on Earthuses as a raw material high-silica sand, while lunar regolith is primarilyigneous silicates such as anorthosites.  Also, production of one mole ofsilicon on Earth uses one mole of carbon in the form of coal, not availableon the moon.  Any production process for the moon must use no reactantsthat cannot be completely recycled.</P><P>Unbeneficiated lunar soil ("regolith") is powdered igneous rock.  Itconsists of a mixture of primarily iron, calcium, aluminum, and magnesiumsilicates, with a few percent titanium, plus small amounts of manganese,sodium, potassium, chromium, and rare-earth oxides.  The exact compositionvaries from site to site, and possibly from sample to sample at a givensite; regolith composition is discussed in detail in the Lunar Sourcebook<a href="#references">[10]</a>.</P><P>Several different production processes were examined.  Good reviews arefound in References <a href="#references">[11,12]</a>, and so a review willnot be done here.  Manyof the commonly proposed processes for production of oxygen from lunarresources (e.g., <a href="/adb/04/03/10/04/oxygen-extraction.html">ilmenitereduction</a>) were not applicable, since they didnot produce silicon.  Others were discarded because silicon, although abyproduct, was not produced in pure form.  The process follows (but is notquite identical to) that suggested by Seboldt and co-workers from GermanAerospace <a href="#references">[13]</a>.  It has the advantage that thesilicon is produced in theform of fluorosilane, which can be easily purified of contamination of theother metals.  In fact, the process can be adapted in a straightforwardmanner to production of other relatively pure products, including titanium,aluminum, and iron.</P><P>The basic silicon reduction process is to heat the regolith in the presenceof fluorine.  The fluorine will displace the oxygen, which is collected asa useful byproduct.  Silicon is produced in the form of fluorosilane(silicon tetrafluoride).  The silicon is recovered from the flurosilane byplasma decomposition.  The metal fluorides ("fluorine salts") are thenreduced with potassium to recycle the fluorine.</P><P>Existing processes to produce silicon do not use fluorosilane, but insteaduse silane (SiH<font size=1>4</font>).  Both plasma deposition processes(to produce amorphoussilicon) and chemical vapor deposition processes (direct thermaldecomposition, to produce either amorphous or polycrystalline Si) arecommonly used in the solar cell industry to reduce silane to silicon.  I amassuming here that it is possible to produce silicon of acceptable qualityby plasma decomposition of tetra-fluorosilane instead of silane, but thiswill have to be demonstrated on the ground.  If not, the process willrequire successive disproportionation of fluorosilane to silane.  This is amulti-step chemical replacement of fluorine with hydrogen at high pressureand temperature.</P><P>Note that this process is different from that suggested in earlier work<a href="#references">[1]</a>, which suggested a fluxed aluminothermicreduction.  The processsuggested here is much less sensitive to the composition of the regolithsource material, and thus a better one for a lander which has to do ademonstration without extensive prospecting to find "good" rock types, andwithout extensive beneficiation processing to isolate the desirable type ofsource material.  The only significant beneficiation desired is to separatethe smallest particle size fraction for use as feedstock.  This has noeffect on the ultimate reaction endpoint, but use of small particle sizeswill increase the reaction rate, since small particles have the highestsurface area to mass ratio.</P><P>An additional advantage of this process sequence is that it produces oxygenfrom the lunar regolith with high yield, and that it produces byproductmetals such as aluminum, titanium, and iron, and byproduct magnesium andcalcium oxide, which are either already purified or are relatively easy toseparate in pure form.  These byproducts are expected to be useful forother manufacturing processes.</P><P>Fluorine is brought to the moon in the form of potassium fluoride (KF).The KF is then electrolyzed to produce the required reactants, potassiumand fluorine.  Potassium fluoride has a higher affinity for fluorine thanany of the other elements except magnesium, calcium, sodium, and lithium.Thus, once the lunar regolith is reacted with fluorine to produce oxygen,metallic potassium can be added to the fluoride salt.  This will directlyreduce the iron, aluminum, and titanium fluorides to metallic iron,aluminum, and titanium.</P><P>Potassium will also reduce fluorosilane to silicon, but this step is notemployed, since it is in general undesirable to contaminate electronicsilicon with alkali ions.  Unless solar cell tests show that this isacceptable, potassium should not be allowed contact with the silicon.Potassium has a higher chemical exchange potential for the oxygen/fluorinesubstitution reaction than any of the remaining metals magnesium, calcium,sodium, and lithium.  This nominal temperature of this reaction is 520 &#176;C.Therefore, if potassium is oxidized to K<font size=1>2</font>O, by addingK<font size=1>2</font>O to theremaining metal fluorides, the metal fluorides are returned to the metaloxide and the potassium converted to potassium fluoride.  (This canprobably be done in a single step of adding oxygen to the mixture ofmetallic potassium with magnesium and calcium fluoride).  At the end of thisstep, all of the fluorine is in the form of potassium fluoride, therefore,only a single salt needs to be electrolyzed to recover the initialreactants, instead of a mixture of salts.  The potassium fluoride ismelted, at a temperature of 858 &#176;C, and the molten salt electrolyzed backinto the reactants potassium and fluorine.</P><P>This potassium reduction is a significant improvement over the alternativeof direct electrolysis of the salts to recover the fluorine, since directelectrolysis will require an electrolysis temperature as high as thecalcium fluoride melt temperature of 1423 &#176;C, which presents a difficultmaterials problem.</P><P>It is desirable to lower the electrolysis temperature even further, sincethe lower the temperature, the less corrosion of the electrodes will beexpected, and it is desirable to avoid the need for frequent replacement ofelectrodes.  The electrolysis temperature can be lowered by performing theelectrolysis in a eutectic salt with a lower melt temperature.  Because Kis extremely low on the electromotive series, very few choices areavailable which will reduce potassium at the cathode.  According toAlabyshev, Lantratov and Morachevskii <a href="#references">[14]</a>, Na,Ca, Sr, and Ba are lower onthe electromotive series at 700 &#176;C, and will not be reduced from the salt.Since fluorine is the most electronegative element on the electromotiveseries, that there is no choice available to replace fluorine as thecation.</P><P>Na, Ca, Sr, and Ba fluorides all form eutectics with KF.  The NaF/KFeutectic salt mixture at a molar ratio 60:40 NaF:KF, with a melttemperature of 710 &#176;C, seems to be the best choice.  An admixture of LiFwill lower the temperature further, although a significant Li component willresult in lithium instead of potassium electrolysis.  It is reasonable toexpect that a 5 percent (molar) admixture of LiF, which will lower thetemperature to 700 &#176;C, should be possible.</P><P>Ternary eutectics have even lower melt tempertures.  Apotassium/sodium/calcium fluoride eutectic mixture, with molar ratioapproximately 0.6:0.3:0.1 KF:NaF:CaF<font size=1>2</font>, will have a melttemperature as lowas 676 &#176;C.</P><P>The electromotive series in molten salts has a dependence on temperatureand on the composition of the salt <a href="#references">[14]</a>.  Furtherresearch may make itpossible to find a temperature and a salt mixture with a lower electrolysistemperature.</P><P>The process sequence has the disadvantage that magnesium, calcium, sodium,and lithium are not reduced to the metal by this process, but returned totheir original condition as oxides.  Sodium and lithium are only minorcomponents of the lunar soil.  Calcium and magnesium oxides make up about20% of typical lunar soil, and leaving these unreduced would result inabout 15% reduction in oxygen production.</P><P>Except for the lost oxygen production if the calcium and magnesium oxidesare not reduced, it is not clear that these oxides are valuable in reducedform.  Calcium will be required in oxide form for glass manufacture(discussed in a <a href="#glass">later section</a>).  It has also beenproposed to make concreteout of lunar material; this also requires calcium oxide.  Thus, it is notof great significance that the process does not reduce calcium andmagnesium.</P><P>An alternative reduction strategy is to use lithium fluoride.  Lithium canbe separated from fluorine by electrolysis in a KF/LiF eutectic saltmixture at a temperature of only 492 &#176;C.  Lithium metal will reducemagnesium, sodium, and potassium fluoride to metal, leaving only calciumfluoride unreacted.  By use of lithium fluoride, the molten saltelectrolysis could be reduced from many elements to only two, lithium andcalcium.  If lithium oxide is then used to drive the reaction<nobr>CaF<font size=1>2</font> + Li<font size=1>2</font>O--> CaO + 2LiF</nobr>, this can be reduced to a single electrolysis.  However,this reaction exploits only a small difference in chemical potential,instead of the large difference exploited in the potassium substitutionreaction.  It is worth exploring to see whether the calcium/lithium oxideexchange occurs at a fast enough rate, and with a high enough recovery oflithium fluoride, for use as a production reaction.</P><P>It might be argued that fluorine is extremely reactive, and it will bedifficult to find materials in which to do the electrolysis.  However,electrolysis of molten fluoride salts is a high-throughput industrialprocess, used in the production of many materials.  The most well-knownfluoride electrolysis process is the Hall process for production ofaluminum, in which molten sodium-aluminum silicate ("cryolite") iselectrolyzed at 1000 &#176;C.  Seyboldt et al. discuss some of the materialsissues involved.</P><h3>Silicon Production on the Moon</h3><P>A block diagram of the basic mass flow process for the silicon productionis shown in <a href="#fig2">figure 2</a>.  The power requirements listedare for ademonstration-sized system to produce a few grams of silicon.The process selected for this is to use fluorine extraction to segregatesilicon in the form of gaseous tetra-fluorosilane (SiF<fontsize=1>4</font>).</P><P><img src=/images/asi199600091.gif" alt"Figure 2: Block diagram ofsilicon and oxygen production steps" width=550 height=705><br><I>Figure2</I><P><ul><li>1A.

Thus, only a single solar furnace is required; therequired reaction chamber is simply rotated into the hot zone when it isrequired.  The solar dynamic ground-test demonstration, based on a powersystem originally designed for the Space Station Freedom, demonstratesmelting a LiF/CaF<font size=1>2</font> eutectic salt as well aslong-duration operation at 800&#176;C under simulated space conditions <a href="#references">[15]</a>.This design could easily beadapted to serve as the solar furnace required to produce the temperaturesrequired for this process.</P><P>The heating process will also evolve volatiles (primarily materialsimplanted from the solar wind) from the regolith.  These will includehydrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide, water, etc.  These may be valuable, andcan be captured after the heating but before the fluorine reaction isinitiated by use of condensors.</P><P>For the fluorination step, there may be some unreacted oxide if thereaction is not done in very high temperatures.  As long as these do notcontain fluorine, these can be considered slag and discarded.</P><P>The condensor must also separate the fluorosilane from the oxygen evolvedfrom the sample, and must also recover any unreacted fluorine.  This isprobably best done by fractional liquifaction (distillation).  Fluorosilanewill liquify at -86 &#176;C, oxygen at -183 &#176;C, and fluorine at -188&#176;C.  Sinceany manufacturing sequence to produce silicon for solar cells wouldundoubtedly also manufacture liquid oxygen for rocket fuel and otherapplications, liquifaction equipment will be present in any case, and it isonly necessary to adapt the equipment to allow progressive liquifaction ofthe individual gasses.  Since the boiling points of fluorine and oxygen areclose, it may be necessary to repeat the distillation process to adequatelypurify the product gasses and recover the fluorine reactant.</P><P>TiF<font size=1>4</font>, with a sublimation point of 284 &#176;C, alsosublimates at the reactiontemperatures of interest.  The TiF<font size=1>4</font> vapor must becondensed on a coldfinger before the vapors enter the main condensor.  If it is desirable toseparate the titanium out, this would be easy to do.  The titanium fluoridewill also include trace amounts of other volatile fluorides, as discussedlater; if it is necessary to produce titanium free of even tracecontaminents, it may have to be purified further, probably by additionalfractional distillation.</P><h3>Aluminum Production on the Moon</h3><P>Aluminum is a byproduct of <a href="#1f">step 1F</a>, but not in pureform.  If the titaniumfluoride is not returned to the reduction after separation in vapor form atthe initial fluoridation stage, then the product from step 1F will be analuminum/iron mixture.  There are roughly 2 atoms of iron for every threeatoms of aluminum in the lunar soil.  Since the lowest temperature liquidphase of metallic aluminum and iron mixtures is liquid aluminum plus ironaluminide (Al<font size=1>3</font>Fe), the aluminum/iron resultant phasewill be ironaluminides, primarily Al<font size=1>3</font>Fe.  If the feed material is ahigh-aluminum/low-iron soil such as the Apollo 16 soil (27% Al<fontsize=1>2</font>O<font size=1>3</font>, 5% FeO),metallic aluminum will be formed.</P><P>Purifying the aluminum can be done by a number of processes, either byseparating the aluminum fluoride by chemical means, by making analuminum-enriched alloy and removing aluminum by melting, or by other meansof removing the aluminum at the alloy stage.</P><P>A simple physical method for separating out the aluminum is by vacuumdistillation.  This process exploits the higher vapor pressure of aluminumover iron; it is a convenient method for lunar application since itrequires only heat and vacuum.  This requires heating the alloy mixture toa temperature at which aluminum vapor is evolved, and then exposing acooled surface for the vapor to condense upon.  The relatively pure film ofaluminum produced is then removed for use by heating the condensing surfaceto melt the aluminum.</P><P>Vacuum distillation could also be used to separate the aluminum fluoridefrom the fluoride salt mixture in the same way, first subliming aluminumsalt AlF<font size=1>3</font> away from the iron salt at 1291 &#176;C.This has the disadvantagethat, since the fluorine must be recovered to be reused as reactant, thedistillation cannot allow any wasted material.  Loss of aluminum metal, onthe other hand, is of little concern, since aluminum is abundant on themoon.  Thus, if high-aluminum soil cannot be easily found to use asfeedstock, vacuum distillation will be used to separate the aluminum fromthe alloy mix.</P><P>An alternative material for electrical conduction is metallic calcium.This is not used on the Earth because of the extremely high reactivity ofcalcium in an oxygen atmosphere, but this may not be a problem on the moon.</P><P>Calcium has the property of having one of the highest conductivity todensity ratios of any easily-available metal, that is, metallic calciummakes the lightest wires.  However, aluminum is adequate for wire use, andaluminum technology is well developed.  Therefore I have not baselinedcalcium for use in the production sequence discussed.</P><h3>Glassmaking on the Moon</h3><P>After silicon, the next most useful material for formation of a solar arrayon the moon will be glass.  This can be used as a structural substrate (fora-Si or poly-Si cells), as a structural superstrate (for a-Si cells), andas a radiation protection layer for all cell types.  It may also be usableto make fresnel lenses or to make mirrors, if a concentration system isrequired.  Finally, glass could be used as fiberglass for structuralelements.  It is also, of course, has many uses other than solar cells.</P><P>Glassmaking is considered such a low-technology, bulk thermal process thatit is hard to realize that it may be difficult on the moon.  It isdesirable to design a process that can use un-beneficiated regolith.</P><P>Glass is an amorphous mixture of silicon dioxide with typically alkalineand alkaline-earth oxides.  The silicon dioxide forms the structuralnetwork of the glass; the other oxides modify the properties to thedesirable form.  On earth, the most commonly produced glass is soda-limeglass.  "Soda" indicates sodium, in the form of Na<font size=1>2</font>O;lime indicatedcalcium oxide, in the form CaO.  The typical proportions are SiO<fontsize=1>2</font> 75%, Na<font size=1>2</FONT>O 15% and CaO 10%, plus 2-3percent other materials.  Soda lime glass isproduced in large amounts on Earth because its low melt temperature makesit easy to work with.  Unfortunately, sodium is not a common material onthe moon, comprising 0.1% to 1% of the bulk lunar regolith.  A seconddisadvantage of soda-lime glass is that it has a veryhigh thermal expansion coefficient, making it vulnerable to the temperatureexcursion of the lunar day-night cycle.</P><P>An alternative glass is pure fused silica, which consists of silicondioxide plus trace components.  While silicon is abundant on the moon, themelt temperature of fused silica makes it extremely difficult to work with.Typically laboratory silica is mixed with other components to lower theworking temperature.</P><P>A useful laboratory glass is borosilicate glass, such as pyrex, where boronoxide B<font size=1>2</font>O<font size=1>3</font> is the primary additive,however, boron is also not a commonlyavailable material on the moon (1-50 parts per million).</P><P>For this reason, I have selected aluminosilicate glass as the baseline forlunar glass.  (Similar considerations led to choice of aluminosilicateglass by Tillotson et al <a href="#references">[3]</a>.)  A typicalaluminosilicate glass formula isSiO<font size=1>2</font> 57%, Al<font size=1>2</font>O<font size=1>3</font>20%, MgO 12%, CaO 5%, B<font size=1>2</font>O<font size=1>3</font> 4%,Na<font size=1>2</font>O 1%, trace oxides 1%.</P><P>Of these constituents, silicon, aluminum, magnesium and calcium are commonon the moon (in fact, calcium-magnesium aluminosilicate is virtually thedefinition of the anorthositic material that is the primary constituant ofthe moon, with some iron substituting for magnesium).   I will assume herethat the boron and sodium oxides can be left out.  This will have theunfortunate effect of raising the softening temperature of the glass, butwill allow it to be made from lunar material.</P><P>Aluminosilicate glasses have an intermediate melt temperature, typically ca1130 &#176;C, which is well above the 860 &#176;C melt temperature of soda-limeglass, but well below the almost unworkable 1710 &#176;C of fused silica.  Interms of working temperature, it has an annealing temperature of typically715 &#176;C, and softening temperature 915 &#176;C (although note that theboron-freeformulation discussed here will probably have a slightly highertemperature).  It also has a low thermal expansion coefficient, comparableto borosilicates.</P><P>The second difficulty, after choosing a glass composition, is that for mostuses our glass will have to be transparent.  This turns out to be asignificant difficulty.  Glass darkening is typically due to transitionmetal oxides, in particular, iron oxide (FeO).  FeO is a significantcomponent of lunar rock, ranging from roughly 3% to 23% of the rock weightfraction.  This is why lunar rock is black.  Producing a transparent glasswill require reducing the iron content to essentially zero.  On Earth, thisis done by selecting iron-free source materials; however, this is notlikely to be an option on the moon, and removal of the iron will probablyhave to be done by chemical or physico-chemical means.  Another step usedon Earth is to add manganese dioxide to neutralize some of the green colorof the iron; however, on the moon, manganese is a low abundance mineral(&lt;0.25%), and is found typically in exactly the same rocks that contain Fe,with a Fe:Mn ratio of ~80:1.  Thus, this is not a good option.</P><P>In principle, in the procedure outlined here, most (if not all) of the ironis segregated in the form of an iron/aluminum/titanium mixture by potassiumreduction.  Of this, only the aluminum component is needed as a rawmaterial for the glassmaking.  Thus, the question of removal of the iron isequivalent to the problem of purifying the aluminum, discussed in thealuminum section.</P><P>Thus, there seems to be no real barrier to production of glass from lunarmaterials.  Once the raw oxides have been refined, the glassmaking processrequires melting the component materials, producing the required form(plate, cast ingots, etc), and, for stress-free glass, holding the glass atthe annealing temperature for an extended period to allow internal thermalstress to relax.  Conventional glass plate produced by the "float glass"method is done by spreading the melt on a bed of liquid tin; this may notbe the optimum process for lunar production.  The melting temperature forthe aluminosilicate glass, on the order of 1130 &#176;C, is significantly higherthan the temperatures required in any other parts of the solar cellproduction process.  This is an incentive for refining of boron, sodium,and lithium oxides despite the relatively low mass fraction of thesematerials in lunar soil, to lower the glass melting temperature.</P><h3>Other Products</h3><P>An additional advantage of this process sequence is that it produces oxygenfrom the lunar regolith with high yield.  Oxygen, of course, is probablythe most important material which can be manufactured on the moon,important both as breathing oxygen, and also as the major component ofrocket fuel.  The process also produces byproduct metals such as aluminum,titanium, and iron, and byproduct magnesium and calcium oxide, which areeither already purified or are relatively easy to separate in pure form.These byproducts are expected to be useful for other manufacturingprocesses.  The silicon or light metals may also be used as fuel for afully lunar-derived rocket propellant <a href="#references">[12]</a>.</P><P>Hydrogen, nitrogen, fluorine, sulfur, carbon monoxide, helium, and othervolatiles will be produced from the lunar soil in small quantities on theinitial heating  The hydrogen will be useful for solar cell production, andthe evolved fluorine (which will be released as hydrogen fluoride, HF) maybe useful for replacement of process losses.  The other evolved volatilesmay also be valuable, and can be captured from the soil by use ofcondensors.</P><P>The fluorine processing of regolith may produce some quantities of othervolatile fluorides, including fluorides of hydrogen, phosphorus, boron,arsenic, germanium, carbon, some platinum group elements, sulfur, tungsten,antimony, bromine, iodine, vanadium, uranium, niobium, and others.  All ofthese boil (at 1 bar) below the processing temperature for the fluoridationstep.  While the abundances of these elements are rather low (&lt;&lt;0.01% forall except sulfur, ~0.07%, and carbon, 0.01%), production of rare-elementfluorides must be taken into account for three reasons: the volatilefluorides will clog the plumbing or contaminate the product output if theprocess sequence is not designed to account for their production, they willrepresent a sink for fluorine if not recycled, and finally, many of theserepresent important resources which are in scant supply, and may have otherprocessing uses.</P><h3>Conclusions</h3><P>There seems to be no unsurmountable barriers to producing the main rawmaterials required for solar array manufacture on the moon.  Materials toproduce silicon, aluminum, and glass can be refined directly from theregolith using fluorine, and a multi-stage reduction process can separateout and purify the required materials.  This refining process, as abyproduct, also produces oxygen, and many other refined materials ofpossible economic value.</P><a name="references"><h3>References</h3></a><P>1.

A second product for such a facilitycould be solar arrays.  While the primary user of lunar- produced solarcells would undoubtably be the lunar base itself, there would be manymarkets.  Figure 1 shows some of these possible uses of lunar producedphotovoltaics, including solar- electric propulsion for orbital transfervehicles and for solar system exploration, and power systems forgeosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites.</P><P>Use of lunar-manufactured solar cells for high-power solar-electricpropulsion is an especially attractive option.  Recent proposals for amanned Mars mission [2], for example, propose an unmanned,electric-propulsion cargo vehicle to ferry supplies to Mars orbit inadvance of the crew on a low-thrust orbit.  The power system for theelectric propulsion is a 5 MW nuclear generator, which could be replacedwith lunar-manufactured thin-film solar cells for a considerable savings inrequired weight to orbit.  For a "sprint" mission, a high-power electricpropulsion vehicles of 200 MW power and a specific impulse of 20,000 seccould make the round-trip to Mars as short as 7.5 months [2].</P><P>Solar-electric transport vehicles would also greatly reduce the requiredmass for servicing the lunar base itself.  B.G. Logan [3], for example,proposes a 6 MW Manned Lunar Shuttle powered by a pulsed plasma gun,estimating that this could halve the transport costs, even for relativelymodest specific power solar arrays.</P><P>Use of lunar material has also been widely proposed for manufacture ofsolar cells for satellite solar power stations [4].</P><P>The cost of transportation from the Earth's surface to orbit and beyond canbe quite high.  Figure 2, for example, shows the cost of deliveringconventional and advanced power systems to orbit, the moon, and Mars, usingcost estimates typical of current technology space boosters.  For example,a one-megawatt power system delivered to Mars could have transportationcosts alone in the ten to hundred billion dollar range.  While these costsare likely to be decreased with advanced transportation, they are likely toremain high.</P><P>The advantage of lunar manufacture is that the escape velocity is only 22%that of the Earth.  Table 1-A shows the Delta-V (velocity increment) needed toachieve various destinations from the Earth's surface and from the moon.</P><P>The payload fraction decreases exponentially with the delta-V, and a muchhigher fraction of the lift-off mass can be useful payload, as shown intable 1-B, which shows the theoretical maximum fraction of lift-off masswhich can achieve the listed orbit if launched from the Earth's surface,compared to launched from the moon.  (Actual rockets never achieve thesevalues; typically only 1-2% of the mass of a rocket launched from the Earthis useful payload.)  Even to low Earth orbit, five times the payload can bedelivered if launched from the moon than if launched from the Earth'ssurface.  For the commercially valuable geosynchronous orbit, almost ninetimes the payload can be delivered.  This is a strong leverage factor forlunar manufacture.</P><P>The design criteria for lunar manufactured solar cells depends on themission.  The most important criteria for most missions are maximumpower/weight ratio (specific power) and minimum usage of materialstransported from Earth.  For use on the lunar surface, specific power isnot an important criterion.</P><a name="references"><h4>References</h4></a><font size=2>(1) Lunar Bases and Space Activities in the 21st CenturySymposium, 5-7April 1988, Houston, TX.<P>(2) NASA Office of Exploration, Exploration Studies Technical Report FY1988, Vol. 1, NASA Technical Memorandum 4075, 21-22 (Dec. 1988).<P>(3) B.G.

Landis</I></P><P><HR><P><h3>Abstract</h3><P>The feasibility of manufacturing solar cells on the moon for spacecraftapplications is examined.  Because of the much lower escape velocity, thereis a great advantage in lunar manufacture of solar cells compared to Earthmanufacture.  Silicon is abundant on the moon, and new refining methodsallow it to be reduced and purified without extensive reliance on materialsunavailable on the moon.  Silicon and amorphous silicon solar cells couldbe manufactured on the moon for use in space.  Concepts for production of abaseline amorphous silicon cell is discussed, and specific power levelscalculated for cells designed for both lunar and Earth manufacture.</P><h3>1. Introduction</h3><P>A first step toward realization of a lunar manufacturing base is toidentify near-term products that could be manufactured on the moon forcost-effective use on-site and elsewhere.  In this paper we discussmanufacture of photovoltaic solar arrays as one such product.</P><P>A lunar base is projected to require 100 kW to 1 MW or more of power, and amining and manufacturing facility considerably more.  It is a naturalassumption to require that a manufacturing facility produce from locallyavailable materials the solar arrays for its own expansion in a "bootstrap"process.  Once it is accepted that a lunar base may manufacture its ownpower source, it is a straightforward extrapolation to the lunar productionof solar arrays for other uses, taking advantage of the greatly reducedtransportation costs due to the lower escape velocity of the moon.</P><P>The widely discussed manned Mars mission, for example, could require 1 MWor more.  Transportation costs alone for a Mars power source could be onthe order of a billion dollars.  While these costs can be projected todecrease with the future availability of advanced launch systems and use ofin-situ propellant production, the possible economic gains are neverthelessextremely large.  This is a strong incentive for seeking ways of loweringtransportation costs for the solar arrays.  One route to doing this is toincrease the array (and storage system) power to weight ratio ("specificpower").  Another possibility is to manufacture the arrays in space.</P><h3>2. Lunar Photovoltaic Arrays</h3><P>Most current plans for a lunar base assume that the base will include anindustrial facility, primarily to produce oxygen for propulsion systems byreduction of the lunar soil <a href="#references">[1]</a>.

For a "sprint" mission, a high-power electricpropulsion vehicles of 200 MW power and a specific impulse of 20,000 seccould make the round-trip to Mars as short as 7.5 months <ahref="#references">[2]</a>.</P><P>Solar-electric transport vehicles would also greatly reduce the requiredmass for servicing the lunar base itself.  B.G. Logan <ahref="#references">[3]</a>, for example,proposes a 6 MW Manned Lunar Shuttle powered by a pulsed plasma gun,estimating that this could halve the transport costs, even for relativelymodest specific power solar arrays.</P><P>Use of lunar material has also been widely proposed for manufacture ofsolar cells for satellite solar power stations <ahref="#references">[4]</a>.</P><P>The cost of transportation from the Earth's surface to orbit and beyond canbe quite high.  Figure 2, for example, shows the cost of deliveringconventional and advanced power systems to orbit, the moon, and Mars, usingcost estimates typical of current technology space boosters.  For example,a one-megawatt power system delivered to Mars could have transportationcosts alone in the ten to hundred billion dollar range.  While these costsare likely to be decreased with advanced transportation, they are likely toremain high.</P><P>The advantage of lunar manufacture is that the escape velocity is only 22%that of the Earth.  Table 1-A shows the Delta-V (velocity increment) needed toachieve various destinations from the Earth's surface and from the moon.</P><P>The payload fraction decreases exponentially with the delta-V, and a muchhigher fraction of the lift-off mass can be useful payload, as shown intable 1-B, which shows the theoretical maximum fraction of lift-off masswhich can achieve the listed orbit if launched from the Earth's surface,compared to launch from the moon.  (Actual rockets never achieve thesevalues; typically only 1-2% of the mass of a rocket launched from the Earthis useful payload.)  Even to low Earth orbit, five times the payload can bedelivered if launched from the moon than if launched from the Earth'ssurface.  For the commercially valuable geosynchronous orbit, almost ninetimes the payload can be delivered.  This is a strong leverage factor forlunar manufacture.</P><P>The design criteria for lunar manufactured solar cells depends on themission.  The most important criteria for most missions are maximumpower/weight ratio (specific power) and minimum usage of materialstransported from Earth.  For use on the lunar surface, specific power isnot an important criterion.</P><h3>3. Lunar Materials</h3><h3>3.1 Materials Availability</h3><P>Silicon is not only one of the most abundant elements on the Earth, it isalso present in great quantity in the lunar soil.</P><P>Table 2 shows the lunar abundance of materials important for production ofsolar cells <a href="#references">[5]</a>.  While high-efficiency solarcells can be made from a widevariety of semiconductors, lunar material scarcity rules out production ofindium phosphide, gallium arsenide, copper indium selenide, or cadmiumteluride solar cells.  (Note, however, that the lunar surface has to dateonly been superficially examined, and that the possibility exists ofmineral deposits with much greater concentrations than those listed here).The available semiconductor material is clearly silicon.  Candidate solarcell types are crystalline silicon and amorphous silicon.</P><P>Production of the structural elements of the array is also important, andin fact contributes more than half of the total mass of the finished array.Materials for producing structural elements are available on the moon<a href="#references">[4,6]</a>.  Aluminum is a major constituent of thelunar soil, and titanium isalso available in varying amounts depending on location.  Nearly purenickel-iron can be obtained by magnetic separation of the small (1-2%)amounts of meteoric material from the soil.  Glass fiber can bemanufactured from readily available lunar silica for use in composites<a href="#references">[7,8]</a>.</P><P>We further note that for a solar-powered moonbase it may also be importantto manufacture from locally available materials a storage system to providepower for the 14-day lunar night.  This is discussed in more detail inreference <a href="#references">[9]</a>.</P><h3>3.2 Silicon Production</h3><P>Although silicon is abundant (second most abundant element, after oxygen,in the lunar crust), typically hydrogen, carbon, and halogens are requiredfor existing technologies of refining and purification, although it isreasonable to expect that a process sequence adapted to lunar conditionsmay minimize usage of these materials. Calculations show that if recyclingefficiency is good, transportation of these materials from Earth will notbe a limiting factor.</P><P>The most common soil material is anorthite, CaAl<fontsize=1>2</font>Si<font size=1>2</font>O<font size=1>8</font>, which can beconsidered to be a mixture of calcium, aluminum, and silicon oxides: CaO +Al<font size=1>2</font>O<font size=1>3</font> + 2SiO<font size=1>2</font>.In the literature several methods are proposed to processextraterrestrial ores, but none have been tested in situ.  The primarycriteria for the process selection are low power requirement and lowrequirement for  non-lunar materials.  Other important criteria include theend products provided, the process complexity, and suitability formanufacturing under 1/6 G.</P><P>Processes considered include fluoroacid leaching, vapor phase pyrolysis<a href="#references">[10]</a>, carbothermal processing, and slagelectrolysis.  For the candidateprocess we considered aluminum reduction followed by electrolysis torecover the aluminum, as shown by the following reaction:</P><pre>        3 SiO<font size=1>2</font> + 4 Al  -->  3 Si + 2 Al<fontsize=1>2</font>O<font size=1>3</font>,        2 Al<font size=1>2</font>O<font size=1>3</font> (electrolysis)  -->4 Al + 3 O<font size=1>2</font></pre><P>This process has been developed and demonstrated by Keller and co-workersat EMEC corporation <a href="#references">[11]</a>.  The aluminum actssimultaneously as a reducingagent for the silicon dioxide and as a solvent for the silicon that hasbeen formed, which can subsequently be crystallized out of the solution ina nearly pure form by cooling.  Because the reduction is exothermic, thereaction vessel needs to be heated externally only during the initial phaseof melting of the slag and the beginning of the reaction.</P><P>An alternative process is electroreduction from an alkaline-earth oxidemelt, which has been demonstrated by DeMattei, Elwell, and Feigelson atStanford <a href="#references">[12]</a>, as shown in the reaction:</P><pre>        3 BaSiO<font size=1>3</font> (electrolysis)  ->  Si + 3 BaO +2 SiO<font size=1>2</font> + O<font size=1>2</font></pre><P>This has the disadvantage that the flux metal, barium, is not available onthe moon.  It is possible that other metals can be used.  This is not aproblem as long as the material recycling efficiency is high.</P><P>The silicon obtained must be purified for use in semiconductor devices.  Acandidate process for purification is by float-zone recrystallization,where the silicon rod is melted in a zone that passes along the length ofthe rod.  Impurities are segregated to the end of the material.  Thisprocess is slow, but has the advantage of zero materials consumption.</P><P>For crystalline silicon, assuming 17.5% efficiency, 65 micron thickcells, and65% utilization of the silicon refined,  1000 kg/yr of silicon is requiredfor a production rate of 1 MW/year.  This is small amount compared to theprocessing of 12,000 metric tons/yr of lunar soil required for the 1,000ton/yr lunar oxygen production envisioned in the lunar base/Mars evolutionscenario <a href="#references">[2]</a>.  We thus conclude that it is indeedreasonable to expect thateven large-scale photovoltaic manufacturing can be considered to require noadditional mining facilities.</P><h3>3.3 Synthesis of Silane</h3><P>If the solar cells are to be amorphous silicon cells made by the standardplasma deposition process, the silicon must be manufactured into silane(SiH<font size=1>4</font>) gas.  There are many different process sequencescurrently used formanufacture of silane <a href="#references">[13]</a>.  We need to evaluatethese methods consideringavailability of materials on the moon.  All of the reactions involvematerials which are not available on the moon.  It is therefore importantthat the recycling efficiency of the process be high.  The largest scaleprocess, developed by Union Carbide <a href="#references">[14,15]</a>,converts powdered, 98%metallurgical grade silicons to trichlorosilane at 500 C in a fluid-bedreactor and then successively disproportionates the trichlorosilane to anend product of silane according to the following sequence of reactions:</P><pre>                Si + 2 H<font size=1>2</font> + 3 SiCl<fontsize=1>4</font>  -->  4 HSiCl<font size=1>3</font>                6 HSiCl<font size=1>3</font>  -->  3 SiCl<fontsize=1>4</font> + 3 H<font size=1>2</font>SiCl<font size=1>2</font>                4 H<font size=1>2</font>SiCl<font size=1>2</font>  -->  2HSiCl<font size=1>3</font>  + 2 H<font size=1>3</font>SiCl                2 H<font size=1>3</font> SiCl  -->  H<fontsize=1>2</font>SiCl<font size=1>2</font> + SiH<font size=1>4</font>overall reaction:       Si + 2 H<font size=1>2</font>  -->  SiH<fontsize=1>4</font></pre><P>The intermediate reaction products are recycled.  Metallic impurities inthe initial metallurgical grade silicon are converted to chlorides andsettle out in the first distillation step.  For maximum recyclingefficiency, these should be electrolyzed to recover the chlorine for reuse.</P><P>It should be noted that the actual mass of material to be manufactured isnot very large.  If the cell manufacturing line is to produce amorphoussilicon cells, for example, at 10% efficiency, the actual silane used inproducing the two micron thick active layer is only 25 kg per year for aone megawatt/yr production line.  If the production line capacity isincreased to ten megawatts/year to produce panels for base expansion,solar-electric propulsion for a Mars mission, and for powering satellitesin GEO, the requirement for silane, including waste, could be around 300kg/year.  By Earth production standards, this would be considered alaboratory-scale production level--there are at least 14 silanemanufacturing plants worldwide with production rates over one ton/year<a href="#references">[13]</a>.</P><h3>4. Solar Cells</h3><P>Primary considerations for the choice of a production process are (1) Lowuse of Earth-supplied materials, including reactants, etchant, andreplacement parts; (2) low labor requirements, (3) energy efficiency, and(4) low mass equipment.  As part of consideration (3), it is important tominimize the amount of silicon required, since the major part of the energyexpenditure needed in manufacture comes from the silicon refining process.It is also useful to distinguish processes requiring only heat, which canbe obtained by a relatively simple solar furnace, from processes requiringelectrical power.</P><h3>4.1 Crystalline Silicon</h3><P>Typical crystalline silicon solar cells have an efficiency of about 15%under the space illumination of 1.35 kW/m<font size=1><sup>2</sup></font>.The best cells made have anefficiency of 19%.  The main problem with conventional crystalline siliconis the low power to weight ratio due to the thickness of the siliconsubstrate.  This may be solved by use of ultra-thin cells usinglight-trapping techniques to increase the effective optical absorption<a href="#references">[16]</a>.  Calculations indicate that such cells alsohave greatly improvedradiation tolerance.</P><P>Another possibility for increasing specific power is to use light-weightconcentrator elements.  For space use, a concentrator system does notrequire great structural strength.  A low concentration system made from1.5 micron thick aluminized plastic with a support structure of equally lowmass could improve specific power by a factor of nearly ten.  The designhas an advantage of a large acceptance angle compared to high-concentrationsystems, thus not requiring high-precision pointing, andallowing one-axis tracking. For Mars operation, where winds can reachspeeds imposing dynamic loading roughly the same as a 25 MPH terrestrialwind, either stiffer arrays, or ones which could be stowed in high windconditions, would be required.</P><P>The candidate process sequence is designed to take maximum advantage of thelunar environment.  Silicon purification by (chloro)- silane distillationas discussed above should be avoided in the interest of simplifying theprocess and minimizing dependence on imported materials.  Instead, therequired purification process could be done by multiple vacuum float-zonerefining.  This step would be followed by single-crystal growth, also bythe float-zone process. Since float-zone processing is done in a solaroven, the process is not energy intensive.  The boule is then sawed to thedesired cross-section followed by wafer slicing, thinning, and surfaceetching to form the substrate silicon wafers.  Silicon removed during thesawing and slicing operations would be re-melted and reused; nevertheless,a considerable amount of silicon is likely to be wasted.  While the assumedutilization of 65% may be optimistic by current practice, it is likely thata process designed to minimize waste could do considerably better.</P><P>Solar cells would be formed on the substrate wafers by ion-implantationusing a non-mass analyzed, solid source implanter <ahref="#references">[17]</a>, followed byannealing in a solar furnace, back-surface deposition of aluminum for aback-surface field and back contact; deposition of Al front contacts; andfinally by vacuum evaporation of the TiO<font size=1>2</font> AR coating.The cellmanufacturing process is followed by bonding the cells to alunar-manufactured coverglass with silicone adhesive (which may have to beimported) and interconnection of the cells into an array.</P><P>Major disadvantages of crystalline silicon for lunar manufacture are thecomplexity of the process, the mass of the processing equipment needed, andthe comparatively high usage of refined silicon.<h3>4.2 Amorphous Si:H</h3><P>Amorphous silicon solar cells have efficiencies of 5-6% AMO, with ~10%likely for the near term <a href="#references">[18]</a>.  The advantage ofamorphous silicon cells isthat the active thickness may be as low as 1-2 microns, thus requiring verylittle use of refined silicon.  The disadvantage is the comparatively lowefficiencies and the yet-unsolved problem of light-induced degradation.</P><P>Preliminary studies suggest that amorphous silicon cells are more radiationtolerant than single crystal silicon, by a factor of 3 for electronirradiation, and by as much as a factor of 50 for proton irradiation<a href="#references">[18,19]</a>.  Further, it may be possible to removeradiation damage byannealing at temperatures of 200 C or less <a href="#references">[20]</a>.</P><P>An advantage of amorphous silicon is that, in principle, the processsequence can be made extremely simple.</P><P>While the silicon is readily available, hydrogen would have to be importedfrom earth.  As 2-10 atomic percent of the composition of amorphoussilicon, it is a negligible weight percentage, so this will not be a majorproblem. Dopants for a-Si typically are boron (diborane) and phosphorus(phosphine).  The boron would have to be imported; this is also a smallcomponent.  It also may be possible to dope the material with aluminum.</P><P>Current technology amorphous silicon cells use indium-tin oxide, tin oxide,or cadmium sulfide for a transparent conductive surface layer.  If materialis not to be imported for the front contact, a possible substitute is zincoxide, a highly transparent semiconductor.  This would require refiningzinc from the low (0.03%) concentration present.  If this is not possible,it would be possible to use a very thin layer of aluminum.</P><P>Most projected high power/weight amorphous silicon arrays use polymer films(e.g., Kapton, Tedlar) as substrates. The absence of hydrogen and carbon onthe moon will require these to be brought from Earth.  If specific power isnot an issue (e.g., if the arrays are to be used on the moon), cells couldbe fabricated on glass (possibly silica or alumina), which is easilyavailable from lunar material.</P><P>For uses where specific power is important (e.g., arrays which will be usedelsewhere, for example for SEPS missions or for a Mars base), a likelysubstrate would be a thin metal foil.  Production of amorphous siliconcells has been demonstrated on 7.5 to 25 micron electroformed nickelsheets, or stainless-steel sheets thinned by etching <ahref="#references">[20]</a>.  Iron is a majorcomponent of the lunar crust; very thin steel sheets (density 7.9gr/cm<font size=1><sup>3</sup></font>)would be an available substrate.  Nickel is not easily available in thebulk soil, but can probably be refined from meteoric material magneticallyseparated from the soil.</P><P>A much better substrate would be thin aluminum or titanium, since thedensity is much lower (2.7 and 4.5 gr/cm<font size=1><sup>3</sup></font>respectively).  Use of suchsubstrates is unproven.</P><P>One advantage to the moon as a location for an amorphous siliconmanufacturing site is the presence of a good vacuum.  Ambient pressure onthe moon is in the range of 106 molecules/cm<fontsize=1><sup>3</sup></font>.  While exhaust from thetransport spacecraft and leakage from the habitat will degrade the ambienthigh-vacuum environment somewhat, the pressure is still expected to be atmost in the range of 10-9 torr <a href="#references">[21]</a>.  Sinceexisting amorphous siliconprocesses have base pressures in the mid- to low- 10-6 torr range, this isan excellent production environment.</P><h3>4.3 a-Si Cell Production</h3><P>An advantage of amorphous silicon is the base of production experience inlarge-scale, semi-automated factories.  The world output of amorphoussilicon solar cells is 10-15 MW/yr, with additional production facilitiesunder construction.</P><P>Amorphous silicon cells are currently made by a plasma process at 0.1 to 1torr.  Glow-discharge processing seems to give the best results.  Typicaldeposition conditions are sumarized in table 3 <ahref="#references">[22]</a>.  Three a-Si depositionchambers, a chamber for the deposition of the transparent conductor and onefor deposition of the metal contacts, plus a loading chamber and anunloading chamber are required.  In the roll-to-roll process <ahref="#references">[23]</a>, aflexible substrate is passed sequentially through chambers which depositthe p, i, and n amorphous silicon layers and the transparent conductor.  Inthe continuous multichamber in-line system, the solar cell is deposited ona substrate, e.g., glass, which need not be flexible.</P><P>For a typical production output of 1.5 MW per year, the productionequipment for such a line on Earth would occupy about 750 m<fontsize=1><sup>2</sup></font> of floorspace, with a volume of about 230 m<font size=1><sup>3</sup></font> and atotal mass of 45,000 kg <a href="#references">[24]</a>.</P><P>However, it must be noted that typical production processes are notoptimized to minimize the equipment mass.</P><P>The lunar vacuum ambient will simplify the production process, since thevacuum chamber can be omitted.  The process will require an enclosure toprevent the gas from leaking out into the lunar vacuum, but this can belight, since the pressure is negligible.  It will also be necessary tocollect and compress the "waste" gas to recycle the hydrogen.  This is donewith vacuum pumps acting as compressors.  The reaction chamber itself canbe made extremely light in weight.  The irreducable mass elements are thethree RF generators, 50 kg each, the seven vacuum turbopumps, 30 kg each(450 l/min), and a primary pump to back the turbopumps, 250 kg (200 m<fontsize=1><sup>3</sup></font>/hr).</P><P>The total mass for this is about 600 kg.  Likely other elements couldincrease this total by a factor of two or three.  Provision of automatedmachinery would be likely to increase this yet further.</P><P>We also note that an alternative process sequence for lunar manufacture ofamorphous silicon cells, based on vacuum evaporation using solarconcentrators followed by hydrogenation of the material as a separate step,has been proposed by Fang <a href="#references">[25]</a>.  While thisprocess to date has onlyproduced cells of comparatively low efficiency <ahref="#references">[26]</a>, there are no knownmechanisms that prevent efficiencies from advancing to levels comparable toother technologies. If higher efficiencies can be obtained, the processproposed by Fang has an advantage over the plasma process discussed abovein that the silane manufacturing process is unnecessary.</P><h3>4.4 a-Si Mass and Specific Power</h3><P>Amorphous Si cells are not yet proven in space.  In the near term, a-Siwill likely not reach efficiencies high enough to be competitive in lowEarth orbit, where drag is an important factor.  For cells to be used onthe moon, weight is not a particular issue.  For this application amorphoussilicon is very likely the best technology.  For other uses, it isworthwhile to make an approximate calculation to determine whether highspecific power can be reached despite comparatively low efficiency.</P><P>The baseline cell considered was that of Mrig and Jackson <ahref="#references">[27]</a>, modifiedfor lunar materials by replacing tin oxide by zinc oxide, and assumed to bedeposited on a 25 micron thick Kapton substrate.  It has been suggested<a href="#references">[12,13]</a> that an amorphous silicon array mayrequire little or nocoverglass, since the radiation damage is low, especially if the array isperiodically annealed.  This is likely optimistic, and applications such asMars surface power will certainly require some protection to avoid abrasionby dust.  Silica covers could easily be manufactured from materialsavailable on the moon.  The array weight, shown in table 4-A, is calculatedboth with and without a silica cover.</P><P>If the cell has an efficiency of 5%, a very conservative assumption, thistranslates to a uncovered cell specific power of 1700 W/kg.  Since theEarth-manufactured substrate is 88% of the total cell mass; clearly thereis no significant weight advantage to manufacturing such a cell on themoon.  Addition of the cover reduces the specific power by a factor offour.</P><P>For a cell manufactured from all lunar materials, a lunar-manufacturedsteel substrate is substituted for the Kapton.  This greatly increases themass.  A 25 micron steel substrate weighs 200 gr/m<fontsize=1><sup>2</sup></font>, leading to a specific power (again assuming 5%efficiency) at the cell level of 350 W/kg without cover, or 220 with.</p><P>Despite the low efficiency assumed, even with the glass covers the cellspecific power is competative with baseline single crystal silicon cells.Cell specific power is only one factor in the overall array specific power,and the structural mass of the array is also a consideration.  In generalthis should be expected to scale with the cell mass.</P><P>Table 4B shows cell-level mass for a more  advanced cell.  Here we assumeda thinner substrate can be used, as well as slight reductions in the cellthickness (primarily the back contact).  The thinnest Kapton currentlyavailable from Dupont is 7 micron.  Tensile strength is 30,000 PSI, morethan adequate for stretching out the array.</P><P>For this case the substrate is 80% of the total mass.  For the advancedcell we assume a lower-mass and an efficiency increase to 10%, which istypical of the best single-junction cells currently made in the laboratory.Considerably higher performance is predicted for advanced structures.  Thecell-level specific power is 9880 W/kg without cover, or 1900 W/kg with athin (25 micron) cover.  For a cell from all lunar materials, a 7.5 micronsteel substrate weighs 60 gr/m<font size=1><sup>2</sup></font>, leading toa cell specific power of 2200 W/kg without cover or 1100 W/kg with the 25micron cover.</P><h3>5. Conclusions</h3><P>Solar cells manufactured on the moon could significantly reduce the cost oftransportation of power systems to space destinations, including the moon,Mars, Earth orbit, and transfer orbits.  Silicon is abundant on the moon,and refining processes have been demonstrated which do not depend onextensive use of reactants imported from Earth.  Because of the lowerrequirements for refined silicon, the amorphous silicon process ispreferred, despite lower efficiencies.  Calculations show that specificpower of amorphous silicon cells can be adequate for most uses.</P><P>Production of structural elements for the arrays, such as struts, frames,beams, etc., is also an important part of the array manufacturing process,although not discussed in depth here, as is production of the substrates.</P><P>Assuming mining operations already in place on the moon for other purposes,such as oxygen extraction, production of silicon for lunar photovoltaicarrays is not a major difficulty.  Lunar-produced photovoltaics are likelyto be a practical product only if the predicted demand for power in spaceis large, at a minimum several megawatts per year.  Such requirements arelikely if there is a vigorous human presence in space, if solar-electricpropulsion vehicles become a significant fraction of the in-spacetransportation system, or if satellite solar power systems become a powersource for terrestrial power.</P><a name="references"><h3>6.

Without getting too technicalabout it: the theory of fusion power says thathelium-3 will work in a nuclear power plant and would yield a much saferand more reliable power source thanalternative methods of producing power with nuclear reactions.</P><P>Until experimental fusion power plants are successfully constructed, wereally won't know if helium-3 will work,either technically or financially. If it does work, the economic impact onlunar development would be tremendous,overshadowing everything else. This leads to another question, whether wewould really want to shift all emphasison lunar development into a race to gain control of the power source of the21st century.</P><P>To answer these questions, it's important to understand the basicconcept. Here is an <a href="he3-intro.html">introduction to helium-3</a>,describing what it is, what it might do, and its potential for economicimpact on lunar development.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Thus, July 8, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

Rocks are silicates, oxides of silicon, plus other elements,usually also expressible as oxides of metals.  The lunar crust is 46%oxygen by weight.</P><P>Hydrogen enjoys no similar essential relationship at all. There is onlyabout 1 ton of hydrogen per 10,000 tons of lunar "top soil" or regolith.(This compares with 4,600 tons of oxygen.) Accummulatively, that's enough,if gathered, to produce a nice-sized lake. Yet 1 part in 10,000 is a lotdrier than the driest desert on Earth.</P><P>There is good news in this, however. Unlike the oxygen which ischemically bound and can only be released by chemical processing or a gooddeal of heat, the hydrogen exists proton by proton loosely absorbed to thesurfaces of the fine lunar dust particles. Unlike <ahref="/adb/04/03/10/04/">lunar oxygen</a>, it is not native to the Moon,but a gift of 4 billion years of incessant buffeting of the lunar surfaceby the Solar Wind. So it is a gift of the Sun. Accompanying the hydrogen isa much lesser endowment of <a href="/adb/02/carbon.html">carbon</a>,nitrogen, and helium, all valuable. A tiny fraction of the helium is <Ahref="/adb/02/09/he3-intro.html">helium-3</a>, a strategic isotope that isthe ideal fuel for still-to-be-engineered fusion reactors. (One <ahref="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/">shuttle</a> external tankful of liquid He-3would be enough, if there were the fusion plants to burn it, to supply allthe electrical power the US uses in a year.)</P><P>All of these Solar Wind gasses, hydrogen being the bulk of it, can beeasily harvested. We just have to run over the surface with a combine whichpicks up the top layer, heats it to 600 degrees F and then lays the soilright back down. The heat will have driven off the Solar Wind gasses whichcan be collected and separated.</P><P>This can be done as a separate harvesting operation. But it makes moresense to design all regolith-moving equipment to do the job in the processof site preparation, grading and building roads, excavations, pilingshielding on top of habitats, and mining. Even if we don't need or are notprepared to use all these gasses right away, stockpiling them in a tankfarm, separated or not, will place us in a much better positionstrategically to enter the Moon's industrial age.</P><P>The solar wind hydrogen will give us some, but almost certainly notenough fast enough to meet settlement needs, unless a full-scale helium-3harvesting operation is in effect. There remains the slim chance we willfind economically mineable water-ice fields in permashade areas at thepoles. Clementine hinted at this at the south pole, but that probe reallydid not have the needed instrumentation to give a definite answer. LunarProspector will have that instrumentation.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sun, Mar 31, 1996<br>Content by Peter Kokh <ahref="mailto:kokhmmm@execpc.com">&lt;kokhmmm@execpc.com&gt;</a>, maintainedby <A HREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar Resources Company</a>.</font></body></html>

<h2 align="center">Use of Hydrogen as a Rocket Fuel</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Peter Kokh</I></P>
<P><HR><P>

<P>One of the biggest problems with in-situ fuel production on the moon is
the lack of hydrogen. LH2/LOX gives one of the highest Isps of chemical
rockets, but it must be imported from Earth, which basically defeats its
purpose.</P>

<P>However, there may in fact be signigficant quantities of hydrogen on the
moon:</P>
<ol type=a>
<lI>Clementine preliminary results offer teasing indications of ice
 (possibly in economically minable quantities) at south lunar pole.
<lI>If we mine <A href="/adb/02/09/he3-intro.html">Helium-3</a>, we will
produce plenty of H<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT> as a by-product. It
 is present, thanks to eons of solar wind buffetting, in 1 part per 10,000 (1
 ton per 10,000 tons).</ol>

<P>Apart from the above, there is the optional strategy of using a "hydrogen
extender." There have been promising studies of methods of using hydrogen
from Earth in combination with lunar dust to produce Silane, SiH<FONT
SIZE=1>4</FONT>, a near-analog of methane, and this would give us
several times more propulsion for the same amount of hydrogen imported or
extracted.</P>

<P>There are strong reasons to extend what hydrogen we import
or extract from the regolith: we will also need it for our
<a href="/adb/04/03/05/consumable-reduction.html">mini-biospheres</a> and
as an <a href="/adb/04/03/10/04/oxygen-extraction.html">industrial
reagent</a>. Burning it is really a crime in that respect.</P>

<P>There are alternatives to hydrogen: powdered metals. Chemically, the
attraction for oxygen of iron, aluminum, magnesium, and calcium -- all
abundant enough on the moon -- is sufficient to warrant development of the 
engines to burn such combinations. Attractively, the exhaust is not a gas 
that would degrade the scientifically and industrially priceless lunar 
vacuum, but powder, analogous to the moondust from which it was derived, 
that will fall back to the surface in an environmentally benign way.</P>

The Surveyor 3 visited by theApollo 12 crew was sandblasted on the side facing the distant LEM.</P><P>Even with a regolith shield, there will be some exposed equipment.After the first landing, we'd be better off having a wall between the lunarbase and the landing site.  The trajectories of the ejecta from a rocketlanding on the moon appear to be mostly horizontal (although some disagreewith this) so a low wall or crater rim should be an adequate shield.</P><P>We were thinking of trucks, actually; big mesh-wheeled trailers draggedaround by that little robot.  Or a big frame of I-beams with large poweredwheels than can pick up the modules and deposit them where we want.</P><P>If we're hauling around 12,000-lbm modules (those triple <ahref="/adb/04/03/06/01/">SPACEHAB modules</a>, with outfitting) and aren'tin a big hurry, we should be able to get by with a reasonable amount ofpower and structure in the surface transport vehicle.  The modules willweigh less than 2,000 lbs on the moon.  The idea of the surface transportvehicle came out of the realization that we might decide to move ouroriginal <a href="/adb/04/02/03/">habitat</a> once we find out what'sthere.</P><P>An alternative to landing around the corner so we don't sandblast thelunar base would be to pull some tarps over the exposed parts when weanticipate another landing.  Even on the first flight, the crew could dothat as their last task before they come home.</P><P>One concept we were exploring was building a tent over the <ahref="/adb/04/02/03/">habitat</a> and piling up the regolith on that,rather than having the moon dust in direct contact with the exterior skinof the habitat.  Or building a shield wall around the hab and roofing itover.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Mon, Apr 1, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

Business of the Artemis Project</H2><h2 align="center">About The Lunar Resources Company</H2><I><P ALIGN=CENTER>Gregory Bennett</P></I><P><HR><P><P>We've received several inquiries about investing in <ahref="http://www.tlrc.com/">The Lunar ResourcesCompany</a>.</P><P>Right now we're puzzling out detailed business plans so we can figure out howmuch capital we'll need, and when.  Based on that information, we'll be ableto write private offering letters, offering stock to get things going in allthese different industries.  We plan separate offerings in each major field ofthe entertainment industry because that will make it more clear to potentialinvestors what we're planning.  Some folks are experts in <ahref="http://www.tlrc.com/artemis_mag.hmtl">publications</a>, othersin merchandising, etc., so we'll set it up so someone can invest in just onearea if he prefers.</P><P>At the same time we're developing the background scripts ("the bible") forstories set in the <a href="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a> milieu.  Wehave to do that to provide a consistent set of entertainment products andstories to go with them.  We want to make sure we're doing top quality workin sharing this adventure.</P><P>Emphasis: This is not a stock offering or a solicitation to sell stock. SECregulations are strict.  For a private offering, stock can only be sold viapersonal contact to individuals who are personally familiar with the principalofficers of the company.  Investors also must be in a financial position tolose whatever they invest.  We also need to make sure we comply with the lawsof each investor's home state or province.  The rules require a bit ofpaperwork and some lawyers' time.  There will be non-disclosure agreements andinvestor suitability forms to sign.  It's still lots less expensive thanspending a million dollars on an initial public offering.  If you are thinkingof investing in The Lunar Resources Company, please do wait for the offeringletter and study it thoroughly before making a decision.</P><P>The regulations are vague about what it means to know someone personally.  Iwould interpret this to mean you're familiar enough with the individuals onthe board of directors to know whether to trust their judgment and evaluatetheir ability to run the business. We don't think you can make that kind ofjudgment based solely on meeting someone in the electronic world or seeingone of our television interviews.  You'd need to meet at least one of themembers of the board of directors close enough to shake his hand and find outwhat he's really made of.</P><P>Incidentally, the Lunar Resources board of directors currently consistsof:</P><UL type=circle><LI>Gregory Bennett (League City, Texas)<LI>Dana Carson (Pasadena, Maryland)<LI>Kevin O'Donnell (Campbell, California)<LI>Howard Slade (Friendswood, Texas)<LI>Ian Randal Strock (Brooklyn, New York)</UL><P>Our best guess is that we're still a couple months away from an offering.This is a <I>very</I> complex business, and growing more complex each day.</P><P>In the meantime, we could use some feedback.  If you might be interested ininvesting in this business, would you want to buy stock in one area of thecompany, or the whole thing?  Folks reading Artemis-list are familiar with theconcept and space travel in general, but other investors are not; so we willoffer stock in several individual business units.  That shopping list, in theorder in which we expect we'll be doing offerings:</P><ul type=square><LI>Publishing<li>Software<LI>Merchandising<LI>Games<LI>Retailing (including an Internet store and mail-order catalog)<LI>Simulations and Virtual Reality<LI>Motion Pictures and Television (which might be separated)<LI>Space Flight</UL><P>The order of that list gives you some insight into our approach -- thecommercial businesses will earn the income to finance the initial spaceflight.  If the lunar base pays off as it should, it will become theoverwhelming producer of income; but remember that from a business standpoint,we are sailing into unknown seas.</P><P>We also could use names for each of these business units.  Ideas are mostwelcome!  There are many businesses out there already using the <ahref="/adb/03/05/trademark-artemis.html">name "Artemis"</a>so we'll probably avoid using that moniker for anything except the Project asa whole, and of course the <a href="/asi_index.html">Artemis Society</a>.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Mon, Aug 26, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

Business of the Artemis Project --><!-- file: /adb/03/artemis-venture.html --><!-- Keywords: revenue cost profit merchandising money story moviemerchanding sponsor affiliate --><h2 align="center">Artemis Data Book</H2><h2 align="center">3. Business of the Artemis Project</H2><h2 align="center">The Artemis Project as a Commercial Venture</H2><P><HR><P><P>Here's the point: Artemis is not a company.</P><P>It's a project -- a goal with a means of accomplishing that goal --named after the Greek <a href="/bios/artemis-bio.html">goddess of themoon</a>.   The Artemis Project is the only venture we'veseen, private or government, for-profit or non, that will get anyone but fewcivil servants living and working in space within our lifetimes.</P><P>It will take the combined efforts of many <a href="/adb/10/">commercialcompanies</a> and manynonprofit <a href="/adb/08/">organizations</a> all over the world to makethis program work.  We'retrying to create an environment where anyone who wants to can participate, as avolunteer, as an entrepreneur, or both.  Anyone who wants to meet the qualitystandards of the program is welcome to <a href="/asi_member.html">join theproject</a>, to <a href="/adb/10/sponsorship.html">license use of thetrademark</a>, and to earn some really nice profits while contributing to thefuture of every human being on Earth.</P><P>The Artemis Project must emphasize financial success as a privateenterprise because that is the only way we will have sustained growth inspace.  A program supported only by tax money and operated in response to thewinds of politics will not endure.  That means people have to earn a profitfrom it, and they have to continue to earn profits as far into the future aswe can foresee.</P><P>That's why we started <a href="http://www.tlrc.com/">The Lunar ResourcesCompany</a>, but there's too muchemphasis on that one company in the way we've been presenting the project.We're working on fixing that.  LRC isn't planning to build the spaceshipsitself; we're looking to aerospace companies with a long track record to dothat.  The <a href="/adb/02/05/04/">robots</a> will come from companies andorganizations who havedemonstrated they know what they're doing, as will the <ahref="/adb/04/01/01/01/launcher-requirements.html">launchers</a> andpropulsion stages.  And, most of all, those entertainment products will comefrom folks who know what they're doing in a host of different industries.</P><P>A few people have asked why we aren't concentrating on schmoozing withaerospace companies.  It's because we're not ready for that stage of theproject yet.  That part of the feasibility was easy: we asked a few keycompanies if they'd do it, if we can come up with the money, and if theythought our cost estimates were good.  Everyone said yes, they want to dothis, and everyone also said our cost estimates were a little high.  So we'reconfident that we have competent spaceship builders who can do the job, willdo the job, and will get it done under budget.  (Launch to LEO is still a bigquestion mark.  It'll cost less than the $800 million we're showing, but howmuch less?)</P><P>Having done that, the next step is demonstrate the feasibility of theincome side of the project.  This will take lots more work because we have to(a) build a market, (b) find businesses and organizations who want toparticipate, and (c) do all this in a manner that will cause a portion of therevenues to go into the spaceship fund.  To do that, we have to get thosebusiness plans together in lots of industries.

The business plan is a living document;you use it to manage the business long after you've got production going.It ought to reviewed and updated at least once a year once a business hasreached a stable operational stage; much more often until then.</P><P>An example of developing the business plan: consider advertising.It's not enough to say "We'll advertise in magazines."  That's an idea, nota plan.  You need to say which magazines, when the ads will be placed, whatsort of ads they'll be (size, color, message of the advertisement, conceptfor content).  With that information in hand, you can fully develop the proforma financials, estimate your costs and sales, and determine whatresources you need to create those advertisements.</P><P>Footnote about advertising: Within our experience to date, advertisinga <a href="http://www.tlrc.com/">commercial product on the World WideWeb</a> produces near-zero sales.  Thismight change in the future, but as yet the WWW is not an effectivemarketing tool.  It might be more effective when we have photographs of theactual products, so people can see what they're buying.  The best outletfor sales, in terms of volume, is retail stores where the buyer can see andtouch the merchandise.</P><P>For many months I've been meaning to make up a totally fictitiousbusiness plan to serve as an example, complete with what the illustrationsshould look like.  Usually someone evaluating your business plan will readthe Introduction and skip immediately to the Pro Forma Income Statement tosee what the money looks like.  Whether they look at the rest of it dependson how well the Introduction and the Money Story grab them.</P><P>We're using this standard outline for all levels of the program, fromthe overall program plan to the most detailed individual product plan.That way the detailed plans should percolate up easily into the top-levelplan, and we can determine how sensitive the overall program plan is tochanges in the assumptions at the detailed level.</P><P>So, for a detailed product plan, some of the sections will be veryshort.  For instance, if we had "business offices" under facilities for anindividual product, it would probably just be a sentence saying we'll usethe business offices of XYZ Company, which produces the product.</P><P>This will be more helpful when we have a full example business plan online, where people can see the language and style these things are writtenin.  We could even have some templates for financial spreadsheets thatfolks could download and stuff into their favorite spreadsheet programs.In fact, if we can get people to use a standard format for spreadsheets, itwill be easier for us to integrate sundry business plans into higher-leveldocuments until we get to the top document.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sat, Apr 15, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

Business of the Artemis Project</H2><h2 align="center">Business Plan of the Artemis Project</H2><P><HR><P><OL><P><LI>We split the project up into sundry business units: space flight,merchandising, publications, retailing, motion pictures, etc.</P><P><LI>We develop individual business plans for each business unit,leading to a private offering of equity investments in each area.</P><P>This is where we are right now: developing the detailed business plans.It's not going fast enough for some folks, but this business must last along time; it must have a solid foundation and all the activities must becoordinated when they happen.  Getting together the team of existingcompanies and starting new ones where we need to takes a lot of carefulplanning; the project is too precious to do a slipshod job at thispoint.</P><PRE>            Spacecraft Design      2.68 %            Software               2.17 %            Operations             1.75 %            Test                   4.62 %            Launch Integration     0.26 %            Marketing              1.45 %            Hardware              24.68 %            Launch & Recovery     56.28 %  (ouch!)</PRE><P>That's from the latest and worst estimate of the costs.  Revisiting thenumbers to see how pessimistic we could force ourselves to be, we came upwith a total cost for the flight of US$1.421 billion. We got a bit lavishwith manpower for design, test, and verification, and assumed no net helpfrom volunteer effort.</P><P>The important point here is that costs up to the point we're ready tostart acquiring the expensive hardware are only about 25% of the total costof the flight.  We can go a long way with just the money from preflightsales.</P><P><LI>People find the project attractive both for the adventure that hasalways been part of manned space flight, and because suddenly space flightcan be a relevant part of their lives.  There's a lot of concept shock todeal with; folks aren't used to thinking of space flight as privateenterprise, and the idea they they, too, might be able to go there hasn'tbeen part of NASA's story since 1959.</P><P>We offer fun and adventure, and outright tell people that if they buyour stuff, the profit funds the space flight.</P><P><LI>After demonstrating the initial viability of the project, debtfinancing becomes reasonable for growth in the entertainment industries.Bankers understand merchandising industries, even when space flight seemslike a long shot risk.</P><P><LI>Profit from these ventures is used to fund development of the moonbase.</P><P>The important point here is that costs up to the point we're ready tostart acquiring the expensive hardware are only about 25% of the total costof the flight. We can go a long way with just the money from preflightsales.</P><P>Incidentally, "corporate management" is so high because it includesthings like lawyers, business managers, liaison with NASA, etc.</P><P><LI> If the appeal is there but the market isn't big enough to makethings move as fast as we'd like, we go out with a public offering to fundthe real moon shot; or maybe corporate bonds. </P><P><LI>We do the flight, make the movies and television shows, and sell themerchandise.  Estimated net profit through this point is over $5billion.</P></OL><P>There's an important point hiding in here: That $1.4 billion is not thetotal capital required to do the project. We can do a rough estimate ofthat now by making some assumptions. Suppose the average profit returnedfrom the supporting businesses is 5%. (It really varies all over thescale.)  Then to raise $1.4 billion, we have to do $28 billion in totalsales over a period of about 10 years, or an average of $2.8 billion peryear.  That's a business roughly 1/3 the size of Disney.</P><P>This doesn't mean <a href="http://www.tlrc.com/">The Lunar ResourcesCompany</a> needs to be that big; but the total team of all participatingcompanies does.  Now, suppose to generate that $28 billion in sales we need20% of that number in capital.  (Another number that varies a lot.)  Thatmeans we, plus our business partners in other companies, need to burn up$5.6 billion in total capital over the same period of time.</P><P>These estimates are very imprecise, but it gives you an idea of thebusiness challenge we're facing.  It also might help explain why we'reputting a lot of effort into bring established entertainment companies onboard instead of trying to grow The Lunar Resources Company from the groundup.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sun, Apr 7, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

Business of the Artemis Project</H2><h2 align="center">Artemis Society International and The Lunar ResourcesCompany</H2><P><HR><P><P><a href="/asi_index.html">ASI</a> and <ahref="http://www.tlrc.com/">LRC</a> are two independent organizations, withdifferent goals and motivations.  They have separate officers, separatebank accounts, and their corporate headquarters are a thousand milesapart.</P><P>Obviously, everyone involved in both organizations is devoted tobuilding this lunar base, and many of the people involved in <ahref="/asi_index.html">Artemis Society International</a> are also part of<a href="http://www.tlrc.com/">The Lunar Resources Company</a>.<P>Artemis Society International is a non-profit scientific and educationalfoundation incorporated in the state of Alabama, headquartered in Huntsville.President and Chairman of the Board of the Artemis Society is J. BoisePearson, who has no affliation with LRC, and doesn't even own stock inLRC. The role of ASI in the Artemis Project is to make the lunar basehappen.</P><P>The Lunar Resources Company is a privately held Texas corporation, and<a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Greg Bennett</a> is its President andChairman of the Board.  LRC started the <a href="/artemis.html">ArtemisProject</a> and underwrote ASI's debts until ASI got on its feetindependently.  LRC's role in the Artemis Project, like every other companyparticipating in this program, is to conduct commercial business which willresult in revenues flowing into the Artemis Society's Lunar BaseDevelopment Fund.  We do that through donations as well as producinglicensed products.  Currently the only products we have on the market arethe "<a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Moonbase Artemis</a>" lineof <a href="http://www.tlrc.com/moonbase.logo.html">coffee mugs</a>, <ahref="http://www.tlrc.com/moonbase.logo.html">T-shirts</a>, and such.  Inthe long run, we plan to develop commercial enterprises on the moon.</P><P>The whole point of starting The Lunar Resources Company was to provide away to demonstrate that commercial business can earn a profit while providingfinancial support to the lunar development project.  The role of privateenterprise in this project is vital -- without it, we cannot garner theeconomic power needed to do it.  We don't hide the fact that we formed thiscompany because we want a moon base, but we also acknowledge that we have toprovide a good return to the stockholders -- better than they'd get frominvesting in other ventures -- or we haven't succeeded.</P><P>The Artemis Society is where donations and volunteer effort go, so thatpeople know their labors will go to developing the moon rather than lining thepockets of a for-profit company.  That's an important distinction: if you dothings for the Artemis Society, it should be donated volunteer effort; butif youdo work for The Lunar Resources Company or any of the other commercial firmsparticipating in the project, you should get paid for it.</P><P>LRC does not anticipate being the company who actually builds thespacecraft.  That's a job better done by an established aerospace company,someone with all the expertise on board and processes in place to do it rightthe first time.</P><P>The Lunar Resources Company has 13 stockholders, of whom three (<ahref="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Greg Bennett</a>, <ahref="/bios/strock.ian.html">Ian Strock</a>, and <ahref="http://www.acess.digex.het/~dcarson/">Dana Carson</a>, among others)volunteered to serve on the ASI Board of Directors.  Greg Bennett is alsochairman of ASI's Board of Advisors, tasked with building an advisory boardwhich can represent the best knowledge not only in space flight, but alsoin many areas of the entertainment industry.  Remember that financial andbusiness research is as important to the success of the Artemis Project asdesigning a good spaceship.</P><P>None of the <a href="/adb/03/04/">revenues</a> of the Artemis Society goto The Lunar Resources Company, though LRC does provide -- at cost -- someof the Society's material. LRC also wrote the check for ASI's world wideweb site, for which we were reimbursed by the Society.</P><P>LRC has also offered to provide fund-raising goods (T-shirts, coffeecups, etc.) to the Society at discounted wholesale prices.  When LRC sellsthese things at retail, a portion of the retail price goes to ASI.  (It'sactually a rather larger portion than ASI would ask of other companies, butLRC is rather paternal about ASI.)</P><P>There are no secrets here.  Many other <a href="/adb/10/">commercialcompanies</A>, which may earn profits from the Artemis Project, are activelyinvolved in support of the Artemis Society.  Duncan Graphics, a Californiacorporation, also donates material to the Society.  Steve Jackson, of SteveJackson Games, is a founding member of the Society.  Space ResearchAssociates have donated a great deal of research and articles to theSociety.  It would be the same if Musicians Contact Service elected tobecome a sponsor of the Artemis Project.</P><P>Right now you'll see the phrase "The Artemis Project is a trademark ofThe Lunar Resources Company" on a lot of literature.  That's a fact; LRCestablished that trademark long before we started the Artemis Society.  Rightnow we're working out the details of transferring ownership of the trademarksand copyrights to the literature to the Artemis Society.  The issues arecomplicated, but we'll get it all figured out.  The number one most importantissue is making sure that the Artemis Project continues, regardless of whathappens to any of the organizations or companies involved.</P><P>The reason we have this problem with trademarks is that initially wethought the best way to make the <a href="/artemis.html">ArtemisProject</a> happen was by first demonstrating with a regular for-profitcompany that there are profits to be earned in this business, and therebyattracting other commercial enterprises to it.  The idea of a non-profitmembership organization to provide a means for people to participatedirectly in the project came later.</P><P>As the Society developed, it became obvious that the non-profitfoundation is the best vehicle to carry out the Artemis Project.  People aremuch happier about donating their time and talents to it; it enjoysconsiderable tax advantages; and we think that other commercial businesseswill be more willing to support the project if they're not worried aboutsomeone else's profit motive.</P><P>You might be wondering why Greg Bennett isn't President of the ArtemisSociety, since he started this whole thing.  Besides the obvious fact thathe's already overworked, the primary reason is to avoid any potentialconflictof interest, or semblance of a conflict of interest.  He had to choose betweenLRC and ASI. He's done non-profit foundations and big aerospace projects, soLRC seemed like the bigger challenge and growth opportunity.  There's yetanother strong reason -- Boise Pearson is a very wise and patient man, andhe's just as dedicated to carrying out this lunar base project as thefounder.</P><P>We enthusiastically encourage open public discussion of this wholeprocess. We're well aware that leaves us open to all sorts of criticism, andsome of that criticism isn't exactly top-quality advice.  If anyone has goodideas about how to organize this project, how to attract capital to it, how topublicize it, please do <a href="mailto:artemis@asi.org">speak up</a>.(And if you see someone venture what appears to be a silly idea, cut himsome slack!)</P><P>If anyone else has questions about this, please do <ahref="mailto:artemis@asi.org">ask</a>.  Our one goal is to make that moonbase happen.  We need your wisdom as much as your time and talent.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Wed, March 13, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

<h2 align="center">3. Business of the Artemis Project</H2>
<h2 align="center">Employment in the Artemis Project</H2>
<P><HR><P>

<P>It will be a few months before <a href="http://www.tlrc.com/">The Lunar
Resources Company</a> has any
openings; we need to raise the capital first.  Employment for spaceship
designers is even further downstream because we won't bring folks on board
until we're confident we can continue to pay their salaries.  It's likely that
the actual spacecraft design and development work will be accomplished by a
team of established aerospace companies.  In the mean time, we're getting
stuff done with volunteer help.</P>

<P>Of course, we can't promise future employment to anyone, however there are
things one might do to leverage a position working in the project.  Remember
that The Lunar Resources Company is only one small part of it; several other
companies are already involved and more will be.  If you run out all the
numbers in all areas of the project, including the entertainment business, the
total economic impact of the Artemis Project worldwide is about 56,000 jobs up
through the first flight or so.  Of those, only about 360 are direct
employment in spacecraft development.</P>

<P>In the long run there should be lots and lots of companies doing nifty space
stuff.</P>

<P>Now, all that aside, the best way to get a job with any company is to
get the attention of someone within that company.  That is, get your name
and face known to people who make or influence the hiring decisions.</P>

<P>The <a href="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a> has a built-in way to
get that sort of recognition: a
track record of helping make the project happen can't hurt!  That means things
like helping in the growth of the <a href="/asi_index.html">Artemis
Society</a> and keeping it focused on
the lunar base, participating on the Society's technical committees, writing
articles for <a href="/mmm">Pleiades</a> and <a
href="http://www.tlrc.com/artemis_mag.html">Artemis Magazine</a>, helping
with the research and design projects, helping organize the WWW site,
helping organize a conference or an Artemis effort at a conference.  In
other words, surf into the WWW site and check out the list of neat stuff
you can do, or write to the Artemis Project at Artemis Society International, PO Box 4878, Huntsville, AL 35815 USA, and ask for a copy of the "Job Jar" fact sheet.</P>

<P>If you'd like to build moonships, or be a flight attendant on one, or be the
breakfast chef flipping pancakes at the <a
href="/adb/02/07/lunacity-hotel.html">Luna City Hotel</a>, it certainly
can't
hurt to be able to show that you already know all about the moon and the
spacecraft!</P>

<P><HR><P>

<P>A common criticism of the Artemis Project is that it would be possible
to take a billion dollars off the cost by simply doing the whole project as a
computerized special effect instead of in reality.</P>

<P>If our goal was to make a movie about travelling to the moon we could do
it a lot faster, better, cheaper using special effects labs.  Star Wars
special effects are certainly more visually exciting than anything from
actual spaceflight to date.  Even if you were to look at a NASA film clip
and analyze how it could have been better (admittedly true of almost any
real space film clip), the special effects artists would still be able to
blow you away.</P>

<P>But after you've seen a special effects movie, that's all you've got.
There's no residual hope that you, too, might be able to do those things.
No hope for your children or any progeny who will remember who you are.
The appeal of the Artemis project is that it's real.</P>

<P>People are often worried about the kids.  When we were growing up, we
dreamed that we'd get to fly in space ourselves, but for kids today some
think the fantasy itself was sufficient.  I disagreed with his conclusion
that kids had changed.  Kids today embrace the fantasy because that's all
they have!  In 1972 the government changed the rules; space travel became
something only government employees could do.</P>

<P>By opening space for private enterprise, we're changing the rules back.
The appeal of once again being able to dream that space is open to
everyone, not just to the government's manufactured heroes, is what makes
people want to embrace the experience and to be a part of making it
happen.</P>

<P>It'll take one heck of a marketing scheme on all levels to get the mass
appeal needed to make the balance sheet work.  Fortunately, manned space
flight gets a heck of a lot of media attention, and a private company
audaciously attempting something that has heretofore been the sole province
of big government is Really Really Big News.</P>

<h2 align="center">3. Business of the Artemis Project</H2>
<h2 align="center">Lunar Rover Initiative Notes</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Gregory R. Bennett</I></P>
<P><HR><P>

<P>For a couple of years we've been talking with CMU about providing the 
robotic element for the <a href="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a>. CMU will
have the technology for keeping those machines alive and sending
high-resolution video back to Earth. They will have worked out all the
problems of navigating on the moon and teleoperating the machines.
<a href="http://www.lunacorp.com/">LunaCorp</a> and CMU are partners in
this thing, so if they succeed, we all succeed.</P>

<P>We're depending on their success as much as we are on other folks in
the industry to develop other key elements of the Artemis Project. For
instance, we're hoping that somewhere among all the research on DC-X, X-33,
Black Horse, SpaceCub, and all those others, we'll get the commercial
passenger rockets we need to make the <a
href="/adb/02/07/lunacity-hotel.html">Luna City Hotel</a> a reality in our
lifetimes.</P>

<P>We've also been tossing ideas back and forth about LunaCorp using
their expertise in other areas to advance the Artemis Project. One obvious
possibility is handling production and distribution of the CD-ROMs we've been
talking about. They have a proven track record in that line, while we (the
membership base of the <a href="/asi_index.html">Artemis Society</A>) are
in a position to provide some great content for new CD-ROMs. If we can
put something together, it will be a win-win scenario.</P>


<h3>Telerobot Control Issues</h3>

<P>Selling a virtual reality experience isn't even in the same ballpark
with actually being there. But until we can go there ourselves, it's all
we have. Even if everything in the <a href="/artemis.html">Artemis 
Project</a> is 100% successful, it will be a very long time before
we can get the costs as cheap as a flight from Seattle to Sydney. So for
most people alive today, that virtual reality is all they'll have.</P>

<P>If you visit the LunaCorp web site at <a
href="http://www.lunacorp.com/">http://www.lunacorp.com/</a>, you'll
see they're planning mostly to record the robot's adventure and present it
as a ridefilm. I'm second-guessing LunaCorp here, but for all the skull
sweat I've put into similar business plans, they should be able to turn
over a nice profit on that kind of attraction.</P>

<P>Controlling the robot in real time might be an after-hours attraction.
We talked with David Gump about that some time ago, but we haven't yet
figured out how to make it balance with an acceptable return on investment.</P>

<P>Of course, controlling a moving vehicle with a full second of
data lag would be sporting, and would really not give you an impression of
being there. The actual lag, due to transport delays in the data stream,
might be several seconds. For example, transport lag in the <a
href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/shuttle.html">Shuttle</a> data
stream can be as long as five minutes. As for being there, in the
simulators, astronauts experience negative training if the visual display
gets as much as 1/4 second behind the actual control response.</P>

<P>The rover will have to be mostly autonomous; and to accomplish
its mission, it will move very slowly.</P>

<P>Long-distance control is not impossible. A couple of years ago, McDonnell
Douglas built a Lunar-Mars rover prototype in a partnership
with the Russians. The test team operated the robot remotely, from all the
way around the Earth, and inserted transport lag to accommodate
teleoperation of a robot on Mars. It worked. The trick is to take your
time, planning each move as you go.</P>

<P>Based on all that, my guess is that directly commanding the rover
would not be a thrill-ride experience. Some people would get a real kick
out of it (many enjoy the space station mobile transporter simulation with its
neck-snapping acceleration of about 1/100 g), but for most folks, it would
get boring to watch the little robot crawl along. But again, that's not
what they're selling. The ridefilm environment can give you a much better
feeling of what it will be like to drive your own rover across the moon.</P>

<h3>Technical Issues</h3>

<P>Regarding the technical issues, we can assume the engineers have
answered questions about the life of the robot and probability of failure
to the satisfaction of the businessmen involved. Mitsubishi is no babe in
the woods; this is the company resonsible for the Japanese Experiment
Module on the International Space Station. We can also assume they didn't
become a giant among the Japanese giants of heavy industry by being
financially naive.</P>

<P>The life of the robot is a real concern, of course. The Lunakhod
rover froze to death in the dark because its power supply couldn't keep it
warm enough. CMU is looking at a more robust power supply, and from the
pictures on the LunaCorp web site we can conclude the <a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/lri-3/www/moon-bug.html">latest
design</a>
addresses the need for insulation and heat conservation better than
previous concepts. Similarly, we've learned a lot about issues like
vacuum welding since the days of Apollo and Lunakhod. (A coating of
molybdemum disulfide is the prescription for that particular problem.)</P>

<P>CMU looked at extending the life of the LunarTrek rover to accommodate
the needs of the Artemis Project. It might work if we can get one of the
rovers to our landing site, and then have our crew refurbish it; but it
probably will be less expensive to just fly a new rover to support the
Artemis Project mission.</P>

<P>In any case, if we can get people to those Lunar Rover Initiative
robots and fix their ailments, we could extend their life; so this new
consortium could turn out to be an important customer for the lunar
community. I expect that manufacturing explorer robots from lunar material
will be a significant industry on the moon for a long time.</P>

<h3>In summation....</h3>

<P>When it comes to building <I>manned</I> spacecraft, however, we'll need a
team of real experts in that field. A team of LunaCorp, Mitsubishi, and 
CMU could probably not tackle the human element. But that just means
the team will grow as the need arises.</P>

<P>If it turns out that the only thing <a
href="http://www.lunacorp.com/">LunaCorp</a> ever does is telerobot
missions, that's still great news for the <a href="/artemis.html">Artemis
Project</A>. They will have developed the pathfinder for commercial 
enterprise on the moon, and all the technologies mentioned earlier. The 
worst-case scenario is that somehow they flub the job and scare people 
away from private space ventures. My guess is that the business expertise 
of the key players is too strong for that to happen; but if it does, 
we'll all just keep plugging away until we get there.</P>

<P>In short: This is good. It gets us all closer to the moon.</P>

<h2 align="center">Artemis Data Book</H2>
<h2 align="center">3. Business of the Artemis Project</H2>
<h2 align="center">Information on Marketing Surveys</H2>
<P><HR><P>

<P>The types of surveys available are extremely wide ranging. One type of
survey consists of the registration cards you get any time you buy a
large-ticket item (like some new computer software). All of those
questions: age, salary, where did you purchase this product, why did you
purchase this product, etc. - that is a marketing survey.</P>

<P>Some surveys (or, more precisely, data-collection techniques) are subtle.
A company will buy a mailing list from, say, a magazine and send out a
mass mailing. That mailing will use a unique product code that signals
whether a respondent is answering this mailing or some other (built from
some other magazine's mailing list). As the company processes the orders,
it records the purchases - comparing the numbers and types of units sold
to the demographic profile of the magazine's subscribers. This is just an
example. But you are communicating a lot of information about you,
depending on the product code you use - which depends on how you got the
product code - which depends on facts about you.</P>

<P>There is also the "drop your business card in the fish bowl for a drawing"
type of customer survey. The company notes the name, rank, and occupation
of its primary customers - so it knows where to target advertising (or
where it needs to change its image).</P>

<P>Sales are a marketing survey of sorts. "If we lower our price X%, what
will be the change in volume? Does it justify lowering the price
permanently?"</P>

<P>The types of surveys I'm most familiar with involve, as I said, drawing up
a list of huge list of questions concerning customer preference (with
questions added aimed at discovering the reliability of answers to other
questions and the degrees that free-ridership or free-drivership have
influenced the answers. These are used for really big issues (including,
in some cases, whether or not to call it quits, close the company, and try
to get the best deal on its assets - or whether or not to buy a company
and start expanding in a whole new direction.).</P>

<P>Reasonable accuracy requires getting a hold off around a thousand people,
carefully picked so as to be willing to spend a half hour or so answering
questions. They are heavily labor-intensive, and should be done only by a
trained expert (which means paying an expert's salary, unless somebody
wants to volunteer). These surveys cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
It's the type of survey I would recommend having before deciding whether
the first trip should be lunar-orbit, manned landing, or habitat-landing.</P>

<P>And there are surveys that involve bringing certain types of customers in
for a very detailed discussion of some product. These survey participants
are generally paid - $15 to $30 per hour - for their time, and walk away
(often) with about $50 in their pocket. These surveys often involve
100-500 people.</P>

<P>This is just a really quick overview of some of the types of market survey
techniques used. Some are, obviously, far more expensive than others.</P>

Business of the Artemis Project</h2><h2 align="center">Private Enterprise in Space</h2><HR><p>Although it's not directly related to getting the initial lunar basegoing, business operations in cislunar space are important to thelong-range financial forecast for a lunar community. That's why thecislunar space traffic model is so important to the Artemis Project. Tohave a thriving community on the moon, we'll need customers for lunarmaterials (<a href="/adb/04/03/10/04/oxygen-extraction.html">oxygen</a>, <ahref="/adb/02/09/he3-intro.html">helium-3</a>, etc.).</p><p>One of the major goals of the Artemis Project is to "bootstrap privateindustry into manned space operations". Satellite servicing is one example.Today, satellites aren't really designed to be refueled or upgraded inorbit, but when that service is available, they will be.</p><p>Our goal is to create the environment that makes all this possible, notto try to do it all ourselves. Having one big corporation that doeseverything is not a good idea.</p><p>It's difficult enough for the human mind to encompass the scope of therole <a href="http://www.tlrc.com/">The Lunar Resources Company</a> playsin the Artemis Project. We can understand and appreciate all the othereconomic opportunities, but to handle the details of all those businessplans and organizations would require a huge, lethargic bureacracy withmanagers reporting to managers reporting to managers, ad infinitum. Itwould make Exxon look like a mom & pop shop. (Exxon is huge, but they focuson one business and do it extremely well.)</p><p>We don't know what the optimum size for a corporate organization is,which is why we're already talking with other companies about makingspacecraft and robots. They'll do what they do best so we can go to themoon and play in the sand.</p><p>There could be a technical problem with using manned spacecraft forservicing or retrieving communications satellites. Geostationary orbit isinside Earth's radiation belts, a place where humans would not want toloiter. However, we might send a lunar-fueled robotic craft into theradiation zone to retrieve the satellite, and use human hands service at aspace station in a higher orbit.</p><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><P><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Fri, March 8, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

Bennett</I></P><P><HR><P><P>Our lawyers have suggested we consider offering non-voting preferredstock.  That is certainly an option, and would be a better way to financethe project if there are enough potential investors who want to buypreferred stock.  The effect of preferred stock is that the holders ofcommon stock give up profit and insurance against risk in exchange forretaining control of the company.</P><P>We could reserve the sale of voting stock to people we do knowpersonally.  In fact, by SEC regulations we can only do a private offeringto people with whom we've made personal contact.  The regulations are toprotect the investor; he must know the company's principal officers wellenough to judge their ability to do the job.  However, that requirementworks in reverse, too.</P><P>Beyond that, there are two sound business reasons for carrying throughwith the space flight:</P><H3>1. Space flight is the foundation of our business</H3><P>The basis of the project is advertising our intent and ability toconduct the flight and establish the lunar base.  If the company violatesthe public's trust by deciding not to do the flight, they'd be out ofbusiness forever.  This is not in the best interest of the stockholders,who would then forego all the downstream profit potential of theenterprise.</P><P>There is one, and only one, scenario where it would make good businesssense to abandon the plans for conducting the space flight: if we discoverthat it just ain't gonna work.  The time value of money could conceivablypreclude profitably conducting the flight; I've said before that it's a nota question of whether it will work, but rather how long it will take.  Wemight find that it takes so long that we are unable to sustain a profitablebusiness based on the promise of space flight.</P><P>We have no indication that this will happen, but if it does, we'll knowlong before we have invested huge amounts of money in the flight.</P><H3>2. The big bucks come from the flight</H3><P>While there is considerable entertainment value in promising to do it --probably enough to get us there and then some -- the big payoff comes afterwe've done the flight.</P><P>We might rethink the spaceship tax we're levying on the for-profitdivisions prior to the flight in our business plans.  An alternative toconsider: prior to the flight, we could invest 100% of the profit fromthese activities in the space flight, minus the portion retained for growthin each division's particular industry.</P><P>That means the company will not pay dividends to stockholders untilafter realizing the profit made from actually conducting the flight.Stockholders' profit comes solely from growth of equity per share in thecompany, and the anticipation of future dividends.  This is how most newcompanies do business.</P><P>Actually, I don't know of any new company that started paying dividendsin their first few years of operation.  What we're puzzling over here ishow to balance investment in advertising -- by investing in the spaceflight vs. investment in capital to build a specific part of the overallbusiness.

Business of the Artemis Project</H2><h2 align="center">Spaceship Building Credentials</H2><P><HR><P><P>In addition to the considerable professional talent volunteering theirtime to get the project off top dead center, our plan is to contract detaileddevelopment of the spacecraft to an experienced spaceship builder, a company with aproven track record which has the expertise and processes in place to do thejob right.  We can't announce publicly which aerospace companies are doingwhat because those decisions haven't been made yet; each one will take acorporate commitment from the top down.</P><P>There are no secrets about who we've been talking to about these things,though, as long as we emphasize that it's in the talking-about stage and notin the contract-negotiating stage.  First off the block is Carnegie-MellonUniversity and the <ahref="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/lri-3/www/moon-bug.html">rovingrobots</a>.  We've also discussed the rovers and where wemight go with this project with David Gump of <ahref="http://www.lunacorp.com/">LunaCorp</a>.  We're talking to<a href="http://hvsun4.mdc.com/SPACEHAB/SPACEHAB.html">Spacehab</a>, Inc.and McDonnell Douglas (Huntsville) about the pressurizedelements.  We're talking to VIGA Tech, formed from a group of fellows atSandia National Laboratories, about VR simulations.  At McDonnell Douglas inHouston, the Lunar Base Development Team has just started looking at themission design and spacecraft architecture.  Rocket engine data are comingfrom several aerospace companies.  The key officers of <ahref="/asi_index.html">Artemis Society International</a> are NASA engineersat the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville.</P><P>We've also talked to spacecraft engineers from Lockheed-Martin, Grumman,Rockwell Space Operations, Boeing Huntsville, Boeing Seattle, RocketdyneCanoga Park, McDonnell Douglas Huntington Beach, and of course NASA-JSC andthe astronaut corps.  Don't let us over-sell that point, however; it's by nomeans a coordinated effort and we can't claim to have corporate commitmentfrom any of those companies.  We'll get there, but we're not there yet.</P><P>This will take time.  For some experienced spaceship builders, theswitch to private manned space flight is severe concept shock.  Socializedspace flight is the only paradigm they know.  Don't underestimate theimportance of this barrier to entry into the field: there has been only onesuccessful pioneer in this area so far, and that's Spacehab.</P><P>Here's what's up.  While you're working on putting the project togetherand building the team (and an audience), I'm putting together the part of theproject where we need to bring in the seasoned professionals.  Within a coupleof years we're going to get to the point where we need the guys with the bigstructural analysis models and the milling machines and the bookshelves fullof data on fasteners and metals and industrial processes.  Even before then,we need the advice of the spaceship builders to avoid following fruitlesspaths, and we need their commitment to make the whole program credible.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sun, March 31, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

Business of the Artemis Project</H2><h2 align="center">Long-term TLRC Financing</H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Gregory R. Bennett</I></P><P><HR><P><P>It is difficult to make a straightforward way to guarantee that thestockholders willnever abandon the project before the lunar flight, or that they won't abandonthe project after the first flight.  The best defense we know is assure thatcontrolling interest in the company is held by people whose primary motivationis the altruistic desire to conduct manned space flight.</P><P>However, there are two important reasons that we need to consider thefinancialmotivation for continuing the space flight:</P><ol><LI>As a publicly held company, we are bound to do what is in the bestfinancial interest of the stockholders.<P><LI>There is the risk that in the future controlling interest could fallinto the hands of people whose primary motivation is financial gain, regardlessof the means.  This could happen through a corporate take-over, despite ourbest efforts to ensure against it; or it could happen through inheritance.(Suppose, for instance, a plane crashed with a majority of our board ofdirectors, and our relatives saw only dollar signs when they inherited thestock.)</ol><P>The way the project is set up, it's in the best financial interest of thestockholders to continue development of manned spaceflight, both for the shortterm and the long term.</P><P>In the short term, the big publicity comes from the manned flight, maximizingprofit on sales of movie tickets and sundry hard goods.  The project needs verypositive publicity to succeed, and that means continuing to demonstrate that<a href="http://www.tlrc.com">The Lunar Resources Company</a> is activelypursing the dream of space development and space flight for everyone whowants to go.</P><P>Entertainment relies on volume sales, and volume sales come from publicity.The potential revenues go up by at least an order of magnitude for the firstcouple years after the flight, and will be sustained at a high level if lunardevelopment continues.  If at any time the company abandons the project, theydrop back to being just another movie-and-marketing firm, with a tremendousamount of negative publicity.</P><P.In the long term, the total profit from the projects ephemeral entertainmentvalue is trivial compared to the economic value of:</P><ul type=square><li><a href="/adb/04/03/10/04/oxygen-extraction.html">lunar oxygen</a> forrocket oxydizer above low Earth orbit<li><a href="/adb/02/09/he3-intro.html">helium 3</a> for energy productionon Earth<li>solar energy transmitted from the moon<li><a href="/adb/03/03/">scientific data</a>, both lunar and astronomical<li>lunar material for spacecraft construction<li><a href="/adb/02/07/lunacity-hotel.html">space tourism</a>, includingzero-g facilities in Earth orbit and habitations on the moon<li>use of the moon as a <a href="/adb/02/10/">launching</a> platform for<a href="/adb/02/05/">interplanetary flight</a><li>extraterrestrial real estate for permanent emigrants from Earth</ul><P>Furthermore, the economics of this business encourage continuous, vigorousdevelopment and exploitation of lunar resources.  If the stockholdersdecide to slow things down, the company will lose its market advantage.Already, several Japanese companies are poised and ready to leap into thegap.  It's important toremember that although nobody is doing it exactly the way we have proposed andthe only U.S. firm engaged in similar business is LunaCorp (the folks with theLunarTrek Rover), we are not completely free of competition.</P><P>Slowing down also means loss of public interest.  This is what happened toApollo.  When it became obvious that the program was dead-ended and that therewas no path to the average person being able to go into space, people lostinterest in the program.  We can blame the news media for dropping the ball,but they were just the carriers of the bad news.  Apollo wasn't promisinganything new after the first landing, just repetitions of the same.  The newsmedia might be condemned for their laziness and ignorance of theimportance of subsequent Apollo flights, but the real blame lies solely on theshoulders of the government officials who lead them into that situation.</P><P>All of which adds up to a conviction that <ahref="http://www.tlrc.com/">The Lunar Resources Company</a> willnever abandon manned space flight simply because it's in the company's bestinterest to continue.  The challenge to us is to document this carefully andmake sure every director of the corporation understands and agrees with it.  Aslong as I'm the boss, there is no way anyone will be employed by thecompany, either as a direct employee or contract labor, unless he understandsand agrees with what we're doing.</P><P>That even includes our lawyers and accountants.  Right now there is nobodyworking on The Artemis Project who hasn't personally expressed to me a stronginterest in developing the moon, and an understanding and belief in the projectand the way we're approaching it.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sat, Apr 15, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

Here's a great example:</P><P>In the days of yore, McDonnell Douglas built an engineering simulator of theGemini electrical system.  Each Gemini spacecraft was a little different, sothey had to make a math model of each ship, and keep the math model updated. That meant lots of changes.</P><P>The math models were stored on punched paper tape.  (The hottest storagedevicearound back then was the magnetic drum.)  Engineers would work out the mathmodel and fill out a form, and a team of keypunch operators would punch thetapes.  They didn't have a way to duplicate or edit these tapes; to make achange, they had to start all over with a new tape, keypunching every bite byhand.  When a tape was done, the operator would make a printout, and theengineers would painstakingly go through the whole thing looking for errors. If they found an error, the operator had to start all over again.</P><P>The great joyous moment for the electrical system simulator team was the daythey finally convinced NASA to let them acquire a teletype machine that couldnot only punch paper tapes, but also duplicate them.</P><P>Imagine the amount of human effort that went into the function youperform today every time you smack that backspace key.  And remember that 100%of the cost of everything is human effort.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sun, Apr 14, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

<h2 align="center">Revenue Advantage from a Broad Consumer Base</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Gregory R. Bennett</I></P>
<P><HR><P>

<P>It is essential for the Artemis Project to appeal to a world-wide
audience, and not only a smaller group of space activists.</P>

<P>As an example, if the only audience we ever attract is 25,000 space
activists (approximately the number of NSS members), we won't be able to pull
this thing off within our lifetimes.


<pre>         Amount needed for first flight:     $      1.5 billion
         % of sales that goes to the flight:        5 %
         Total sales:                        $     30.0 billion
         Avg sales per capita, NSS members:  $    100.0 per year
         Total annual sales to NSS members:  $ 25,000.00
         Interest rate earned on LBDF:              5 %
         Years to build up the LBDF:              131 years</pre>


<P>Now, assuming our audience is 1% of the entire world's population, and
we can maintain the same level of sales per capita:</P>

<pre>         Amount needed for first flight:     $      1.5 billion
         % of sales that goes to the flight:        5 %
         Total sales:                        $     30.0 billion
         Avg sales per capita, 1% world   :  $    100.0 per year
         Total annual sales:          $ 5,000,000,000
         Interest rate earned on LBDF:              5 %
         Years to build up the LBDF:                5.38 years</pre>

<P>These figures are very sensitive to the assumptions you make for how
much of total sales can be applied to the space flight, and what interest
rate we might earn on the Lunar Base Development Fund while we're saving up
to buy spaceships. However, this pretty well shows the point that we want 
a world-wide audience.</P>

<h2 align="center">Direct Investment in Manned Space</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Gregory R. Bennett</I></P>
<P><HR><P>

<P>We've structured the <a href="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a> to
avoid having to ask people to
<a href="/adb/03/03/direct-investment-chunnel.html">invest directly</a> in
the space flight because attempts to get private funding
for manned space flight have not been successful in the past.  Twenty years
(since 1976) of zero success provides a pretty strong body of empirical
data.  That doesn't mean it's impossible; but it does indicate that the
chances of success are very small.</P>

<P>Until we have an operational lunar base which has proved out the habitation
systems, lunar mining, and basic feasibility of the transportation system,
we won't know enough about the risks to even begin to assess them.  Once
those things have happened, we will be able to show a long-range business
plan that shows how <a href="/adb/03/03/long-term-resources.html">lunar
resources can be profitably exploited.  In the
long run, the strongest source of income for a lunar community will
probably be <a href="/adb/02/07/lunacity-hotel.html">tourism</a>.  Second
would be <a href="/adb/04/03/10/04/">lunar oxygen</a> for <a
href="/adb/02/07/ssto-business-plan.html">rocket fuel</a>.  (This
assumes the <a href="/adb/02/09/">helium-3</a> scenario doesn't happen.
We're ambivalent about that
one.)</P>

<P>We have two main problems with getting to the point where we can ask people
to invest directly in manned space flight: (1) concept of manned space as
an unprofitable government venture, and (2) level of risk vs. the time it
takes to break even.</P>

<P>Because of the Apollo Program and successors, people have developed a
mind-set that manned space must be so large and complex that only a huge
government body could do it; and that the only reason it's worth doing is
to pull off a political stunt.  This is clearly not true of you, or you
wouldn't be reading this; however it is certainly true of the great
majority of the world's population.</P>

<P>It's also true of the great majority of people working on space programs
today.  If you survey the web sites, especially the NASA, NSS, and SEDS
sites, you'll see that nearly all the activity is geared toward convincing
the U.S. government to do something.  (It ain't gonna happen.  For
evidence, review the history of NASA's budget, appearing soon on a web site
near you.)<P>

<P>Manned space as commercial enterprise is too speculative an idea for most
large investors.  The length of time between the initial investment and
assurance of return on that investment is too great to justify the risks.
Investors need some data upon which to base an investment decision.  When we
wrote the <a href="/artemis.html">Artemis Project goal</A> "to bootstrap
private enterprise into manned
space flight," that's exactly what we had in mind.  Establish a proven track
record, and the world will beat a path to the moon.</P>

<P><hr width=30%><P>

<P>As to about whether <a href="http://www.tlrc.com/">LRC</a> would accept
a deal from a large
company wanting to investing directly in the manned space flight:  All
caveats and concerns aside, of course we would.</P>

<P>Specifically whether we'd accept that deal from Mitsubishi: I dunno.  We
don't know the details of what MHI and LunaCorp have agreed to.  However,
the folks we've met from both these corporations are really sharp, so we can
assume they've worked out a win-win situation; and if they succeed, we all
win.  Of course, LRC isn't looking at the same product lines as <a
href="http://www.lunacorp.com/">LunaCorp</a>.</P>

<P>We haven't even considered a robotic rover as a <a
href="http://www.tlrc.com/">Lunar Resources Company</a>
product line.  That's not because we wouldn't want to do this, but because
there are at least three strong candidates for suppliers: LunaCorp (with
Carnegie-Mellon), International Space Enterprises, and McDonnell Douglas.
The same is true of the manned element for the
reference mission, but if LRC were to bid against MDC for the manned
element, it'd make sense stick with MDC.  And MDC isn't the only spaceship
builder on the
block.<a href="#note">*</a>  In business parlance, there are significant
barriers to entry in
those two fields.</P>

<P>Similarly, when the question of producing CD-ROMs came up, my first
thought was to contact LunaCorp.  That's an easy make-or-buy decision: they
know this business; we (LRC) don't.  This might be a better example in
going out for investors.  It will be lots easier to develop a business plan
with an experienced producer and marketer of CD-ROMs.  We can show
investors the track record that LunaCorp has built.  On the other hand, the
<a href="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a> can provide some cool content
and market appeal which would
otherwise not be available to <a
href="http://www.lunacorp.com/">LunaCorp</a>'s CD-ROM product line.  Again,
everybody wins.</P>

<P><hr width=30%><P>

<P>The proposed robotic <a href="/adb/05/05/">lunar sample return
mission</a> is a different story.  
We're talking about a much lower level of capital, earlier return on
investment, and less risk.  If <a
href="http://www.lunacorp.com/">LunaCorp+CMU</a> succeed, there will be an
established precedent for missions like this.  That gives us a solid basis
for an offering to investors.  The big unknown will be returning the
material to Earth.  It has been done, but never as private enterprise.  We'd
feel much more comfortable asking people to invest directly in the lunar
sample return than we would with the manned lunar base.</P>

<P>Now, all that said, if there appears to be sufficient interest, we will go
ahead with an offering which allows people to invest directly in the lunar
community.  We might not be able to raise enough capital to do the whole
program that way, but if enough people want to do this, we'll get there
that much faster.  There's always the chance that we'll be pleasantly
surprised!</P>

Bennett</I></P><P><HR><P><P>Another example of how we could turn parts of the spacecraft into amarketable product comes from my experience this past week in getting theInternational Space Station ready for the test in the water tank.</P><P>We needed a mechanism to attach some big utility trays to thespacecraft.  These trays bridge the gap between the main truss and thenode, hab module, and laboratory.  The solution was a custom design for anelegant arrangement of a clevis pin and a capture latch.  Uh, somethinglike this . . .</P><pre>   ---        ----  |   |      |    | button  |    -------------------  |                       \  |          latch    +   /  |       ----------------        ----  |      /         |    |       /      \  |     |         /    /  <--- |  pin   |  |      \       /____/         \      /  |       ----------------        ----  |                       \  |                       /  |    -------------------  |   |   ---</pre><P>There's a lot more to it than I can show with text graphics, but you getthe basic idea.  On my computer, the text graphics are pretty close to fullscale, so you can get an idea of the size of the gizmo.  There are twoparallel latches for each tray.  That little hook in the latch isspring-loaded, so you just push the pin (which is attached to a hugemonster of a utility tray) into the latch and it stays put.  A tethered pippin goes in at the "+" to secure the hook.  The button opens the latch ifthe pip pin is removed.</P><P>("Pip pin" is an archaic term for a ball-detent device.  We are usingzillions of them to secure things on our spacecraft because they can beoperated with EVA gloves.  Another amusing spin-off: my key chain is heldtogether by pip pin from Avibank, the same manufacturer who supplies thepins for our spacecraft.)</P><P>While assembling and disassembling the spacecraft parts, I kept gettingideas for dozens of other places we could use this thingie: attachingequipment in my pickup bed, hanging the lawnmover and bicycles in thegarage, latching doors, joining heavy furniture subassemblies, holding carand boat seats in place, berthing a sailboat mast, holding gun barrels in arack, mounting a light fixture on the ceiling, mounting the pull-downladder to the attic, securing tools in the workshop... you get thepicture.</P><P>To make our spaceship work, we hand-built a half dozen of these latches;but they could be mass-produced for a tiny price using the hand-built itemsas prototypes.  There is only one moving part, and only about a half dozentotal parts; manufacturing cost would be cheap and the parts could be madefrom a variety of materials -- from soft plastic to hardened steel --depending on the application.  They'd probably retail at your localhardware store for less than $10.00 for the cast steel version.  Plasticones would cost about 30 cents from the manufacturer and retail for$4.00.</P><P>I could use dozens of these things, so I'd assume a few million othertinkers out there could, too.</P><P>The point here isn't to sell this particular latch, but that in theprocess of designing a spaceship we have to invent thousands of marketableproducts.  With a commercial mind-set, we'll market them.  That way we canprofit from our inventiveness and at the same time reduce everyone's costof building spaceships (and attic stairs) by providing the parts asmass-produced off-the-shelf products.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sat, Apr 15, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

That's great; all these things are important andthe project lives on publicity.  But the technical question of whether we cando the moon base is not the key issue for potential investors.</P><P>Suppose, for example, you are a venture capitalist considering investing inthe publications business unit.  We're seeking financing to launch our line of<a href="http://www.tlrc.com/artemis_mag.html">magazines</a>, books, and <ahref="/adb/03/04/">calendars</a>.  Your question is whether thosepublicationsare going to sell.  Is the market big enough?  What's the return on investment? Do you have a way to take your cash out of the business?</P><P>You ask about our ability to do spaceships; we show you the corporate teammembers who do have a track record in building and flying spaceships.  But whenyou ask about our ability to create, market, and distribute publications, well,duh . . . we have one of the top editors in the business, a team ofaward-winning hard-sf writers, some of the best popular space writers; but therest is still up in the air.</P><P>And <a href="http://www.tlrc.com/artmeis_mag.html">publications</a> areour strong suit.</P><P>Then you ask about predicting public interest in this audacious project, andour ability to generate and exploit that public interest.  Nay-sayers will citea few dramatic cases of failures to do this ("The Last Action Hero"), andoptimists will cite hundreds of successes.  The only way to know for sure is tohop into a time machine.</P><P>Quoting myself: There's no question that the Artemis Project will work; ita question of how long it will take.  Given a thousand years, we could fund amoon base from the proceeds of a lemonade stand in Alice Springs.</P><P>In a similar vein, <a href="http://www.lunacorp.com/">LunaCorp</a> coulddo their lunar rover solely by saving abit of profit from the sale of each CD, and saving up until David Gump'sgreat-great-grandchildren finally are able to fly the lunar rover.  (We donot recommending this approach.)</P><P>The challenge is to balance the required capital against the time it takes,and the level of public interest the project generates.  More initial capitalmeans higher business risk, but it also means a higher level of public interestbecause it makes it relevant to the lives of people who want to go<I>now</I>.  Thisis the complex equation we are working to solve.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Fri, Apr 11, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

Bennett</I></P><P><HR><P><P>Anyone interested in investing in <a href="http://www.tlrc.com/">TheLunar Resources Comapny</a> should also be aware that the first offering isonly the first of several.  We anticipate a series of public offerings,each timed to provide the capital required for each stage of the operation,and your ownership per share will be diluted with each subsequentoffering.</P><P>In the cash-flow analysis of the <a href="/srtemis.html">ArtemisProject</a>, most of the time is spent in the black. That would work fineif we were content to exploit the project's entertainment value at somepoint and fold; however, to realize the Big Bucks profits, we have toaccomplish our goal of establishing a permanent lunar base.  From abusiness standpoint, we're selling a promise, and we have to continue towork toward fulfilling that promise or all we have to sell is just anotherspace fantasy.</P><P>Get the picture?  This thing is set up to drive the Board of Directorstoward the goal of establishing a thriving lunar base, because only bydoing that will they be able to serve the best financial interests of thestockholders.  This is how the power of private enterprise will get us intospace.</P><P>We need to assure that the interests of the initial stockholders areprotected and that folks are rewarded for investing early.  To do this, wedo not intend to have subsequent offerings until we can make the nextoffering at a higher price against reasonably anticipated revenues.  Afterthe initial offering, this becomes a balancing skill -- the anticipatedannualized return from purchasing a share of stock will decline over time,but if we program it right even the last public offering will have anattractive predicted return on investment.</P><P>Let me emphasize "predicted" return on investment.  Obviously we can'tpromise anything; we are venturing into uncharted territory both in spaceand in business.  Nobody has ever tried a private manned space venturebefore, and nobody has ever tried to marry space travel with show business.(Unless you count science fiction, which the Artemis Project isn't.)</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sat, Apr 15, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

(Note: Mitsubishi, the company which sponsored <ahref="/adb/04/03/06/01/">Spacehab</a>, recently <ahref="/adb/10/18/nw-mitsubishi-contract.html">signed</a> with Lunacorp.) Agood deal of the revenues from the lunar explorer would come from <ahref="/adb/10/sponsorship.html">sponsors</a>; and there's a huge amount ofconcept shock to be overcome when you start talking about the advertisingvalue of having your name on a robot that goes across the moon.</P><P>Prognostication about private lunar ventures is quite premature.  We allhave a lot of research to do, and some education for the internationalbusiness community to get used to the idea.</P><P>There's a very fundamental point about the business approach we're usingin the <a href="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a>: it's not a question ofwhether it will work, but rather how long it will take.  Given enoughpatience, we could save up the money we needby running a lemonade stand in Alice Springs.  That's one pole of thereductio ad absurdum of the approach; the other pole being some rich spaceactivist showing up and donating $10 billion.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>3.3. Investment in Financing the Project</TITLE></HEAD><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><!-- Artemis Data Book --><!-- ADB section 3.3 Financing the Project --><!-- file: /adb/03/03/investment.html --><!-- v 1.0 --><h2 align="center">Artemis Data Book</H2><h2 align="center">3.3 Financing the Project</H2><h2 align="center">Investment in Financing the Project</H2><I><P ALIGN=CENTER>Jim Davidson</P></I><P><HR><P><P>Some critics have stated that due to the nature of this project, anyprivate sector fundingwould have to come from equity investors. In order to convince them toinvest their moneyfor this venture, some sort of commercially viable enterprise must befeasible or noneof us will get to the moon or even get to <ahref="/adb/04/01/01/01/">launch</a> the <ahref="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/">rockets</a>.</P><P>Although my MBA was in marketing and entrepreneurship, not finance oraccounting,I have quite a bit of education and real-world experience where finance isconcerned.  I should state categorically that the statement "any private sectorfunding would have to come from equity investors" is false.</P><P>Debt financing plays a reasonable and vital role in space projects.Some projectshave such great certainty that bank financing is available.  Typically,debt financing looksfor reasonable, measurable risk and adequate hedge mechanisms.</P><P>For example, a building may be necessary to house <ahref="/adb/04/05/02/01/jpl-ground-comm-stations.html">Earth-sidecommunications</a> and controlequipment.  That building will sit on real property.  It represents animprovement to thatproperty.  It is collateral against the funds lent to build it.  Althoughthe venture building thefacility may go under, the market for real property and buildings is suchthat thereis adequate salvage value for the loan.</P><P>Capital equipment to build things can alsobe debt financed.  Even highly specializedmachine tools often have multiple applicationsand hence represent collateral security fordebt.  Aircraft for weightless training can alsobe debt financed since they have other uses.Office equipment can be debt financed.Copiers, computers, monitors, printers, faxes,phones, furniture...all these things can befinanced with debt.<P>I'm not recommending that debt be undertaken,and I'm perfectly aware of the many concernswith an overburden of debt.  But there are evenways to finance the most risky portions of aspace venture with debt.  There is a specialclass of debt called convertible debt.  The debtis issued so that it can be converted to warrantswhich can be exchanged for stock at a specifiedprice.  In this manner, if the <a href="/adb/artemis.html">ArtemisProject</a> succeeds,the debt is converted and the investor reaps avery large upside return.  If the project fails, thedebt is still owed. If the failure is so deep, thecompany operating the project may declarebankruptcy, and thus the creditor loses it all.But the upside potential of the warrants is oftenadequate to entice investors who wouldotherwise shy away from the risk.</P><P>It has also been stated thatcommercially viable ventures must exist orwe won't go to the Moon or even <a href="/adb/04/01/01/01/">launch rockets</A>.However, commercially viable ventures alreadydo exist.  Communications satellites are amulti-billion dollar industry, and growing.  Thenew interest in low orbit comm-sats means avery large demand for launching rockets inthe next decade.</P><P>With regard to manufacturing, there is still agreat deal of <a href="/adb/02/03/">research</a> interest in the uniqueproperties of the <a href="/adb/m/03/">space environment</a>.  Noneof it has proven an immediate potential, butboth vacuum and weightlessness show strongsigns of being the bases for a new era ofindustrialization.  Even if these aspects ofspace are only ever exploited for theirresearch potential, they represent a multi-milliondollar industry.  Again, privatization andderegulation would be good, especially theelimination of the bizarre subsidies whichentice researchers to wait years for a "cheap"<a href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/shuttle.html">shuttle</a> flight rather thanincur the expense of a capsule return mission (eg, Photon orComet).  Such subsidies radically distortthe market for <a href="/adb/02/07/ssto-business-plan.html">spacetransportation</a> andwould, if done by another nation, bechallenged under the "dumping" provisionsof the 1974 Trade Act.</P><P>But what is commercially viable right now?Can we get funds together in the nextfour years to finance a lunar base to becomplete within 10 years?  I think it will takeat least 4 years to raise the kind of <a href="/adb/03/03/">money</a> weneed.  From my experience, the more funds youwant, the longer it takes to get them.  Also, whenyou are talking about 100's of millions of dollars,it is necessary to demonstrate during the timewhen you are raising the money that you canproduce <a href="/adb/03/02/">revenues</A> and profits from your activities.Thus, if we are going to raise the funds for a lunarbase, it would be wise to start selling <a href="/adb/03/04/">products</a> thisyear that can show revenues on the books, andmuch better if we can sell enough to generate profitswithin the first half of 1996.</P><P>Investors and bankers are alike.  They are menwho will happily lend you an umbrella when thesun is shining, but want it back at the first signof rain.  By producing profits, even at a verysmall scale, <a href="http://www.tlrc.com/">Lunar Resources</a> can demonstratethat it knows how to keep the rain off.</P><P>But what can we sell now and what can wesell within 5 to 10 years?  Two things haveproven markets:  <a href="/adb/03/04/">entertainment</a> and <ahref="/adb/02/07/">tourism</a>.</P><P>There can be no question of the entertainmentpotential of spaceflight.  <ahref="/adb/03/04/movie-revenues.html">Movies</a> with spacethemes which have been box office smash hitsare numerous.  <a href="/adb/03/04/">Toys, souvenirs, and collectibles</a>with space themes are legion.  Since the 1890s,books on space travel, both fiction and nonfiction,have been best sellers.  Since the 1930s, a numberof magazines have done very well using spaceliterature as a major element.</P><P>And <a href="/adb/03/04/theme-parks.html">tourism of spacefacilities</a> on Earth is also a proven market.  Moreover, there are somevery well-documented market surveys on thepotential for <a href="/adb/02/07/lunacity-hotel.html">space flighttourism</a> which detail a very large market, over 80 million in the US andan equal number outside the US.</P><P>Serving those markets is something <a href="http://www.tlrc.com/">The LunarResources Comapny</a> can do right now.  And, indeed,the company has produced products including<a href="http://www.tlrc.com/moonbase.logo.html">shirts</a>, <ahref="http://www.tlrc.com/moonbase.logo.html">mugs</a>, <ahref="http://www.tlrc.com/buttondesc.html">buttons</a>, and <ahref="http://www.tlrc.com/poster.html">posters</a> which it isselling right now.  The company is working ona magazine, <a href="http://www.tlrc.com/artemis_mag.html">ArtemisMagazine</a>, which will include fiction and fact on lunar activities.  Andthe companyis developing plans for other entertainmentproducts and services.</P><P>Meanwhile, Lunar Resources is in contact withsome <a href="/adb/10/">other companies</a>.  Notable examples include RandSimberg's Interglobal Spacelines, <ahref="http://www.lunacorp.com/">Lunacorp</a>, and of <ahref="http://www.io.com/sjgames/">Steve Jackson Games</a>.    Both of thesecompanies have space-related products availabletoday.</P><P>We can't pay for a lunar base by only selling <ahref="http://www.tlrc.com/moonbase.logo.html">T-shirts</a>,but we won't be able to raise the funds for itunless we sell everything we can think of, and more.</P><P>Investors want to put their money in successfulfirms with a proven profit record.  They want tosee people who are credible and success-orientedrunning those firms.  They are most concernedwith whether the people in charge can be trustedto make good decisions.  And they want to seea business plan that is well-conceived.</P><P>Before concluding this essay, let me dispel afew myths.  You don't have to have moneyto make money. Someone else has to have it.Nor do you have to spend money to make money.Again, someone else has to spend it.  With thesetwo simple principles in mind, you can start anybusiness down the road to success.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sat, Apr 13, 1996<br>Content by Jim Davidson <ahref="mailto:73370.3046@compuserve.com">&lt;73370.3046@compuserve.com&gt;</a>, maintained by <AHREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar Resources Company</a>.</font></body></html>

Bennett</I></P><P><HR><P><P>It is often pointed out that it would be very easy to allow our ownenthusiasm for space travel to cloud our ability to judge the marketabilityof the Artemis Project among the general populace of the world.  Thesereminders are vital to developing a sound business foundation for theproject.</P><P>We're answering that concern several ways.</P><P>First, caution is built into the business plan and our approach to theproject.  Rather than risking capital, we will develop the spacecraft withrevenues earned from the other parts of the business.  If we are unable todo that, then the philosophy behind the project -- that manned space flightis sufficiently entertaining to fund itself -- has not proved out.  (Or atleast we will have demonstrated that we have to date been unable toimplement that philosophy.)</p><P>Second, we have good reason to expect the Artemis Project's approach tospace flight will be more appealing that historical government programs,even without a race to beat 'the godless commies'. Government programs havebeen lackluster for two reasons:</P<ol><li>They're portrayed as being about machines; even the crew have beencast as machines.</P><P>Artemis is the story of people, and we will present as a story aboutpeople.  Our success here depends on the ability of we science fiction writers to comethrough with characters that people will care about, and give them aninteresting environment in which to do interesting things.</P><P><LI>The things the government has done in space are not relevant to mostpeople's lives.</P><P>This has to do with the playground.  Some of us can vicariously enjoythe adventures of NASA astronauts, and even Russian cosmonauts; but mostpeople do not identify at all with the professional astronauts.  Thegovernment space program is the domain of very highly trained and educatedpeople, hand-picked to go into an environment forbidden to anyone else.Everyone else is shut out of that playground.</P><P>Our goal is to open up the playground to everyone, to create an economicenvironment where the moon and all the solar system is open to anyone whowants to go.  That's why we chose a lunar base as our primary goal -- it'sthe seed that gets the whole business engine growing.</P><P>All the requirements for the lunar base stem from this.  It must bepermanent, manned, and ultimately self-supporting. Permanence doesn't meanwe won't consider moving it, but it does mean we will always work toward ascenario that avoids abandoning our presence on the moon.</P></ol><P>Third, space travel is more popular than you might imagine, even withthe drawbacks of the current government space program.  The majority of theU.S. populace want the government to do what they're doing, and mostbelieve that NASA is doing a lot more than it actually is.  Space toys andmemorabilia have been a steady seller since the early Fifties, and todayare a large segment of the toy industry.  I've found in my travels thatpublic interest in space is much greater in areas away from the NASAcities.  I've found more space enthusiasts among the general populaceoutside the United States than within our national boundaries.</P><P>Fourth, we're playing to a world-wide market.  Limiting our thinking todomestic sales has a profound effect on the bottom line.  U.S. citizens arevery wealthy and probably will account for nearly 50% of total sales, butthat's only half.  We're already expanding the Artemis Project to all theanglophone countries, plus the Scandinavian countries, where the majorityread English as part of their daily lives, and Russia; and now France.Others will follow as we develop the resources to support them in theirlocal languages.</P><P>This all adds up to a scenario where we aren't risking much of a loss.Assuming we don't foul up the entertainment business completely, we mightreach the point where we have learned that it's just not going to work.  Idon't think that will happen, but if it does, we will have a neatinternational organization of space enthusiasts and an entertainmentbusiness built up.  With those resources, maybe we'll think of somethingelse.</P><P>The other failure scenario isn't a failure scenario at all.  Supposesomeone with lots of expertise and capital sees what we're doing and leapsin to do it faster and better.

<h2 align="center">Commercial Sponsors for Artemis Project Merchandising</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Simon Rowland, Richard Alonzo Fyfe</I></P>
<P><HR><P>

<P>To leverage mass-mailings of <a href="/asi_index.html">Artemis Society
International</a> material, calender production, and many
other things in the production queue like the <a href="/adb/">Artemis Data
Book</a> CD-ROM, it makes sense to solicit sponsors and advertisers who
would pay for inserts. This would greatly reduce the threshold for entry
into a market, and raise profits (which go into the Lunar Base Development
Fund) at the same time for basically no penalty.</P>

<P>So, if anyone wants to go hunting for advertisers for the aforementioned
material, some points to keep in mind:</P>

<P>It makes sense to look for companies that are not rooted in one place,
that would receive revenues from someone near Toronto, even if the company is
based in Orlando. This rules out convenience stores and such that have a
local "footprint". So we need to find companies that specialize and look
for revenues from distant customers. The only store in the world that sells
lunar regolith simulants (as an example) might be a good candidate, or if
there are only a few stores in the country, so the footprint would be huge.
Even an antique store that sells old doorknobs would be an example.</P>

<P>Another class of company to solicit advertising money from is one which
ships its products all over the country or globe. Coca-Cola, mail-order
companies, electronics manufacturers, etc. Obviously, it makes sense to
target small-to-medium sized businesses rather than giants which spend
millions on advertising campaigns like Coca-Cola.</P>

<P>Internet and computer companies are a real group to target. This
organization is heavily internet-based, so nearly all the recipients of the
mailings would be potential customers. Web site design firms, computer
software, etc. would all be good candidates. We are also a
science/technology/science fiction target market. Companies like Analog, SF
book club, Lunar Sourcebook publishers, telescopes, Edmund's scientific,
etc. would be good places to look.</P>

<P>Finally, we represent a group with an interest in space. A company like
Lunacorp that manufactures space CDs might want an insert in a calender if
it's going to people that their CD is targeting. A group like the NSS or
the Planetary Society might want to solicit memberships from the customers
of a <a href="/adb/03/07/cdrom-tasks.html">CD-ROM</a> or <a
href="/adb/03/04/calenders.html">calendar</a>. On the other hand, a
sponsorship from a political group like the SSF or NSS might have to be
weighed against its disadvantages, such as
distracting from the <a href="/asi_index.html">Artemis Society</a>, and
possible conflicts with the "No Social Causes" policy.</P>

<P>Of course, the <a href="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a> will stick
fliers and fact sheets in at every opportunity, as it is, in effect, the
principle sponsor of all merchandise.</P>


<P>Many projects underway are designed to promote this
method of funding; a section of the trifold has been set aside for
promotional considerations. However, for some of the material at least, it
is not necessary to look at the international market.  For example, assume
that a local chapter wants to distribute the trifold on a local college.
It is possible (and much easier) to get a local sponsor. It is possible to
put their
material ("Eat at Joe's") in the promotions corner and return a master
in 2 days that can photocopied for distribution. We would have to
weigh the increased cost of smaller production runs with the increased
benefit of obtaining funding from small, local businesses. Sometimes it
will pay off (particularly in these early years).</P>

Implementing a survey among a representative sampleof the population of consumers is far more tedious and time consuming.Especially when the population of consumers is not domestic to the US butvery international, the time required to implement such a survey can be large.Taking appropriate care to make sure the results of the survey aren'ttainted by self-selection errors or other forms of poor sample selection isvital, but also tedious.  Analyzing the data from surveys is the most fun ofall, but involves some very esoteric statistical mathematics which areclearly not enjoyed by everyone.  However, it is necessary.</P><P>It is clear that "hundreds of dollars" will be a price for an attractively<a href="/adb/03/04/moonrock-plaques.html">mounted piece of the Moon</a>that many will find difficult to pay.  And tens of dollars for a <ahref="/adb/03/04/moonrock-products.html">piece of dust</a> encapsulated ina small sphere of plastic will be a price that will cause many to questionthe value of the purchase.</P><P>But let's talk about some actual data.  Four accurate surveys indicatethat about 80 million Americans and about 80 million from other nationsaround the world have a strong personal desire to fly in space.  Let uslimit our further discussion to these 160 million consumers.</P><P>Let's say that only one-tenth of those "space-interested" folks have themoneyto buy a $200 piece of artwork or lunar rock conversation piece.  Of the 16million who can afford it, let's say that only one-tenth are willing to pay forthe product.  We thus have 1.6 million customers, and a potential revenue streamof $320 million.  We can safely say that this market is not smaller than $3.2million in revenues and not larger than $32 billion in revenues.  Only aspecific market survey will tell us more accurately.</P><P>If the market for a $200 item of lunar origin represents $320 million inrevenues, what about the market for a $50 item?  Let's assume that theelasticity of demand is linear, so at 1/4 the price some 4 times as many canafford it.  Thus, 64 million can afford it, 6.4 million actually buy, and weagain have a market worth $320 million in revenues.</P><P>With many products considered luxuries, the elasticity of demand is actuallyinverse, since a more expensive piece of artwork is considered more likely toappreciate in value.  So, just for grins, if the number of space-interestedfolks who can afford to pay $1,000 for a piece of lunar rock artwork is only 3.2million but 50% of them would actually buy it, we have another market worth $1.6billion.</P><P>What is interesting about the way market economics actually work is that withall three products on the market, one can tap a total revenue stream that is atleast as large as the sum of its parts.  While many who buy the $50 item won'tbuy the $200 item, many others will buy both.  While many who will buy the $1Kitem won't buy the other items, there are still some who buy all three.  And, ofcourse, for every ten people who each buy one of an item, there is usually onewho buys two or more.</P><P>I would say that the initial market for lunar artifacts is roughly $1 billionplus or minus $500 million.  Having made my prediction, I am even more eager forreal market data.  I am also eager to see whether that stream of revenues can beserved profitably.  As the only source of revenues for a human lunar settlement,it isn't likely to be profitable.  As a secondary source of revenues it mightstill be unprofitable.  Both the market data and the engineering details must beexamined before the choice will be clear.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Thu, Apr 4, 1996<br>Content by Jim Davidson <ahref="mailto:73370.3046@compuserve.com">&lt;73370.3046@compuserve.com&gt;</a>, maintained by <AHREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar Resources Company</a>.</font></body></html>

Financing the Project</H2><h2 align="center">Moonrock Marketing Strategy</H2><I><P ALIGN=CENTER>R. Alonzo Fyfe</P></I><P><HR><P><P>It may be a little early to create a marketing survey for moonrockproducts. What I would like to offer at this point is a potential marketingstrategy and some tasks associated with that strategy.</P><H3>I. Use Established Companies</H3><P>Just as there is good reason to use established aerospace companies forspace hardware, there is good reason to go with professional companieswith respect to marketing the final products.  The idea is to sell lunarmaterial wholesale, in large blocks, to companies who would, then, breakit down and sell it on the market. For example, 500kg of material can besold to a company that supplies research institutes, 150kg to a companythat supplies museums, 500kg can be sold to governments, etc. ASI shouldpurchase (at discount prices) a block from LRC and contract with companiesthat specialize in collectables for creating Artemis Project collectables.Precisely what to offer should be worked out in negotiations with theseprofessionals and will depend on their relevant experience and expertise.</P><P>Selling bulk lunar material wholesale means giving up some of thepotential profits. However, doing so would allow taking advantage ofmarketing systems already in existence rather than inventing and buildinga whole new system. It's like the difference between using an <ahref="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/">existinglauncher</a> or building a new launcher. By building a new launcher, theproject would not have to pay the costs that would be profit to thebuilder. But it is worth it to pay this extra money to be dealing withsomebody who has experience in the field.</P><P>Task (1): Identify existing companies that may be interested in marketingmoonrocks and contact them. If none of them are immediately interested inthe concept, find out their concerns (what would it take to get theminterested). Once these concerns are known, future tasks will be developedto try to address these concerns. This, I think, needs to be done bysomebody at an executive level who has intimate knowledge of the entireproject and who has the authority to speak for the company.</P><H3> II. Legal Status of Moonrock Ownership</H3><P>One of the concerns businesses are likely to have is the legal status ofowning moonrocks. If there are any legitimate concerns to be had here,then professional legal council must be sought in order to answer thesequestions. Hopefully, it will be possible to find a licensed professionalwho is interested enough in space travel to do the work for free. If not,then I see no way to avoid the costs of hiring a professional; this is nota job that can be done by an amateur.</P><P>Task (2): A licensed lawyer needs to research the status of moonrockownership. Depending on the results of this research, legal action mayrequired in order to resolve ambiguities in the law.</P><P>Note 1: The legal status of this mission may be able to find precedent inthe legal status of whaling - which, I believe, is done on the high seas.Is there any relevant legal difference between capturing and harvesting awhale on the high seas and capturing and harvesting an asteroid in space?</P><P>Note 2: I think the bulk of the political concerns can be bestillustrated by means of the following hypothetical example: Assume theLunar Prospector discovers a single pocket of water ice. Private ownershipof this resource would be like private ownership of the only oasis in adesert. Under a private ownership scheme, the owner would have the abilityto reap "monopoly prices." The potential income would inevitably lead to afight over who owns it. On earth, these disputes have gotten peoplekilled. If the only way to own it is to take it, then the resource islikely to be squandered and wasted (like the American Buffalo and whales).If nobody can own it - period - then this would be no different than ifthe resource didn't exist at all. It is this type of case, I believe,which will determine the principles governing ownership of items in space.Political agencies should be able to recognize a difference between thisand plain, ordinary moondirt.</P><H3> III. Selling Moonrocks</H3><P>Chances are that companies will need evidence that being involved in thistype of project would be worth the cost. This means stepping into theretail business. With luck, an experienced company would see our fumblingefforts and the money we are receiving in spite of our mistakes andnegotiate a contract to take over the project.</P><P>I would suggest collecting the market for lunar-material collectables inthe following way:</p>.<P>Task (3) Create a small product catalogue. Several ideas have alreadybeen proposed. This, itself, has several small tasks. The display case foreach sample will have to be laid out and designed. Some detailed drawingswould be useful.  Each potential product would need to be researched forcost of production and time involved. Counterfeiting prevention may figurehighly in the costs.</P><P>Task (4) Create prototypes for the material. This is scissors and paper,workbench kind of work using regular earth dirt.</P><P>Task (5) These prototypes should then be "tested." They are shown tofriends, taken to conventions, pictures are posted on the web, and thelike. Input is received which is then used to modify the layout. Newprototypes are then created and tested. The catalogue would have to beupdated as well.</P><P>Task (6) Advance sales. As Greg has argued, a marketing survey is best ifit measures actual behavior. Using the prototypes and the catalogue,marketers should start to collect advance sales. The money received fromthese advance sales should be banked in an interest-bearing account, witha promise to return the money with interest (money-back guarantee) if thegoods can not be delivered. As this account grows, this should attract theinterest of people willing to make a direct investment.</P><P>Important:  This money is not touched until the goods are delivered.Spending the money in advance could be a short road to financial ruin -not to mention the lawsuits generated from people who come to believe thatthe whole thing was a scam. Putting the money in such an account willgo a long way to convincing people that this is serious, and thus likely to contribute to greater sales.</P><P>Still, without touching the money in this account, we can show it topeople and say, "This is what we have already sold. Invest in the project,and after we deliver the product to these people a percentage (to benegotiated) of this and all the other money we make will be yours." Thiscould attract some potential direct investment.  (It could also be used ascollateral for a loan, but this is worse than spending the money.)</P><P>It will be important to listen to the salespeople; who, in turn, have afinancial stake in listening to their customers. They will say what theyneed to sell the material. Give it to them.</P><P>Option: Create two different lines of products; a risk-free product linedescribed above (if we fail, you get your money back with interest), and arisk-taker/investor product line (your money goes into the LunarDevelopment Fund and will be used to finance the mission, or split, withsomething like 20% of the money going into the ASI General Fund and 80%into the Lunar Development Fund. We make no guarantee that the missionwill succeed and you may not get your money back if we fail). The productsshould be different - and risk takers should be allowed to pay somewhatless (say 75%) for comparable products.</P><P>I think it would be a good idea to take advantage of the incentivescreated by commissioned sales. People who are allowed to take 5%-10% offthe top for everything they sell end up selling a whole lot more thanthose who do not. There is a reason why they are so widely used. However,with a "money-back guarantee" it is not possible to pay commissionedsalespeople for their success and still be able to pay back all those whowould be owed money if the mission failed. Proposed solution: Salespeoplecan keep 5% to 10% of the value of everything they sell in the investmentline (since there is no money-back guarantee). This will give thesalespeople an incentive to push the investment line of products.However, salespeople will not get their commission on the risk-free lineuntil the products are delivered and the money is received from thisaccount.

Both markets are capable of providingsignificant income.</P><P>In his same message, there is a wide ranging discussion of the value of lunarrocks as a product.  Pieces of lunar dust encapsulated in plasticspheres and incorporated into jewelry have been called a "fad jewelry" product.The use of the term is not meant to be pejorative, but descriptive.  Thepopularity of newthings is often temporary, and it would be foolish to configure ourbusiness plansto have a steady stream of millions of dollars in sales of Moon dust for yearsand years.</P><P>Several key points to consider:</P><OL><P><LI>If the intrigue with Mount St. Helens dust was short-lived on alarge scale,Moon dust cannot be expected to last more than twice as long as a major market.<P><LI>A small amount of income is probably still generated by artisansusing MSHdust in their artwork, but more for the artistic merit of their creations thanfor the MSH dust. So we can expect the initial bloom of a fad product and alower level of sales that lasts a long time.<P><LI>Fads make millions for those who market fad products and some fadsdon't goout of fashion.  For example, the hula hoop lasted about 10 years, the frisbeeat least 30 years.  Quite a few products that were very popular in the early'60s made strong comebacks in the late '80s as parents looked for the productsthey enjoyed as children.<P><LI>If the fad does produce steady income for a long period of time,that willlikely motivate competitors.

Alonzo Fyfe</P></I><P><HR><P><P>It may be a little early to create a marketing survey for moonrockproducts. What I would like to offer at this point is a potential marketingstrategy and some tasks associated with that strategy.</P><H3>I. Use Established Companies</H3><P>Just as there is good reason to use established aerospace companies forspace hardware, there is good reason to go with professional companieswith respect to marketing the final products.  The idea is to sell lunarmaterial wholesale, in large blocks, to companies who would, then, breakit down and sell it on the market. For example, 500kg of material can besold to a company that supplies research institutes, 150kg to a companythat supplies museums, 500kg can be sold to governments, etc. ASI shouldpurchase (at discount prices) a block from LRC and contract with companiesthat specialize in collectibles for creating Artemis Project collectibles.Precisely what to offer should be worked out in negotiations with theseprofessionals and will depend on their relevant experience and expertise.</P><P>Selling bulk lunar material wholesale means giving up some of thepotential profits. However, doing so would allow taking advantage ofmarketing systems already in existence rather than inventing and buildinga whole new system. It's like the difference between using an <ahref="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/">existinglauncher</a> or building a new launcher. By building a new launcher, theproject would not have to pay the costs that would be profit to thebuilder. But it is worth it to pay this extra money to be dealing withsomebody who has experience in the field.</P><P>Task (1): Identify existing companies that may be interested in marketingmoonrocks and contact them. If none of them are immediately interested inthe concept, find out their concerns (what would it take to get theminterested). Once these concerns are known, future tasks will be developedto try to address these concerns. This needs to be done bysomebody at an executive level who has intimate knowledge of the entireproject and who has the authority to make speak for the company.</P><H3> II. Legal Status of Moonrock Ownership</H3><P>One of the concerns businesses are likely to have is the legal status ofowning moonrocks. If there are any legitimate concerns to be had here,then professional legal council must be sought in order to answer thesequestions. Hopefully, it will be possible to find a licensed professionalwho is interested enough in space travel to do the work for free. If not,then there is no way to avoid the costs of hiring a professional; this is nota job that can be done by an amateur.</P><P>Task (2): A licensed lawyer needs to research the status of moonrockownership. Depending on the results of this research, legal action mayrequired in order to resolve ambiguities in the law.</P><P>Note 1: The legal status of this mission may be able to find precedent inthe legal status of whaling - which, I believe, is done on the high seas.Is there any relevant legal difference between capturing and harvesting awhale on the high seas and capturing and harvesting an asteroid in space?</P><P>Note 2: The bulk of the political concerns can be bestillustrated by means of the following hypothetical example: Assume theLunar Prospector discovers a single pocket of water ice. Private ownershipof this resource would be like private ownership of the only oasis in adesert. Under a private ownership scheme, the owner would have the abilityto reap "monopoly prices." The potential income would inevitably lead to afight over who owns it. On earth, these disputes have gotten peoplekilled. If the only way to own it is to take it, then the resource islikely to be squandered and wasted (like the American Buffalo and whales).If nobody can own it - period - then this would be no different than ifthe resource didn't exist at all. It is this type of case which will determine the principles governing ownership of items in space.Political agencies should be able to recognize a difference between thisand plain, ordinary moondirt.</P><H3> III. Selling Moonrocks</H3><P>Chances are that companies will need evidence that being involved in thistype of project would be worth the cost. This means stepping into theretail business. With luck, an experienced company would see our fumblingefforts and the money we are receiving in spite of our mistakes andnegotiate a contract to take over the project.</P><P>I would suggest collecting the market for lunar-material collectables inthe following way:</p><P>Task (3): Create a small product catalogue. Several ideas have alreadybeen proposed. This, itself, has several small tasks. The display case foreach sample will have to be laid out and designed. Some detailed drawingswould be useful.  Each potential product would need to be researched forcost of production and time involved. Counterfeiting prevention may figurehighly in the costs.</P><P>Task (4): Create prototypes for the material. This is scissors and paper,workbench kind of work using regular earthdirt.</P><P>Task (5): These prototypes should then be "tested." They are shown tofriends, taken to conventions, pictures are posted on the web, and thelike. Input is received which is then used to modify the layout. Newprototypes are then created and tested. The catalogue would have to beupdated as well.</P><P>Task (6): Advance sales. As Greg has argued, a marketing survey is best ifit measures actual behavior. Using the prototypes and the catalogue,marketers should start to collect advance sales. The money received fromthese advance sales should be banked in an interest-bearing account, witha promise to return the money with interest (money-back guarantee) if thegoods cannot be delivered. As this account grows, this should attract theinterest of people willing to make a direct investment.</P><P>Important:  This money is not touched until the goods are delivered.Spending the money in advance could be a short road to financial ruin -not to mention the lawsuits generated from people who come to believe thatthe whole thing was a scam. Putting the money in such an account willgo a long way to convincing people that this is serious, thus likely to contribute to greater sales.</P><P>Still, without touching the money in this account, we can show it topeople and say, "This is what we have already sold. Invest in the project,and after we deliver the product to these people a percentage (to benegotiated) of this and all the other money we make will be yours." Thiscould attract some potential direct investment.  (It could also be used ascollateral for a loan, but this is worse than spending the money.)</P><P>It will be important to listen to the salespeople; who, in turn, have afinancial stake in listening to their customers. They will say what theyneed to sell the material. Give it to them.</P><P>Option: Create two different lines of products; a risk-free product linedescribed above (if we fail, you get your money back with interest), and arisk-taker/investor product line (your money goes into the LunarDevelopment Fund and will be used to finance the mission, or split, withsomething like 20% of the money going into the ASI General Fund and 80%into the Lunar Development Fund. We make no guarantee that the missionwill succeed and you may not get your money back if we fail). The productsshould be different - and risk takers should be allowed to pay somewhatless (say 75%) for comparable products.</P><P>I think it would be a good idea to take advantage of the incentivescreated by commissioned sales. People who are allowed to take 5%-10% offthe top for everything they sell end up selling a whole lot more thanthose who do not. There is a reason why they are so widely used. However,with a "money-back guarantee" it is not possible to pay commissionedsalespeople for their success and still be able to pay back all those whowould be owed money if the mission failed. Proposed solution: Salespeoplecan keep 5% to 10% of the value of everything they sell in the investmentline (since there is no money-back guarantee). This will give thesalespeople an incentive to push the investment line of products.However, salespeople will not get their commission on the risk-free lineuntil the products are delivered and the money is received from thisaccount. Salespeople will then receive their commission plus interest. Ifthis enterprise turns out to be successful enough, we won't need othercompanies.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Tue, Apr 16, 1996<br>Content by R.

People complained about the highshipping charges.  Never mind that those are the real and accurate costs ofgetting an item into the mail; what matters is how people perceive thesituation.</P><P>After studying all those catalogs, it was obvious that successfulmail-order companies base their shipping costs on the total of merchandiseordered.  We took that as empirical evidence that it works (all those folkshave been in business for a long time) and decided to do the same thingwith our shipping costs.</P><P>We ran many sample cases based on the small selection of merchandise wehave in our current catalog.  Suppose someone ordered just one coffee cupor T-shirt; suppose someone ordered a dozen:  how much would we lose onshipping costs?  How much would we be over-charging for shipping?  Why dothe big guys set up their shipping-cost tables the way they do?</P><P>We learned a few really important lessons from this analysis:</P><ol><P><LI>The bigger the company, the more they discourage small orders.</P><P>Look at Company B, the entertainment giant.  They've been marketingtrademark toys since before we were born.  If you order less than $10 ofmerchandise from them, they'll hit you for an additional 50% to send thatone item to you.  (They don't really have many items priced less than $10anyway.)</P><P><LI>The larger the order, the more willing they are to absorb some ofthe shipping cost in reduced profit.</P><P>That makes sense.  If you order one coffee cup, we can't afford toabsorb any of the cost.  But if you order $100 worth of stuff, we can lose$2 in shipping costs without worrying about it.</P><P><LI>Breakpoints in the shipping costs tables are set up to encourage youto add that one more small item to a larger order.</P><P>This shows up in our table a little bit.  If you want a T-shirt (pricedat $12.50), it won't cost you additional shipping to put one of thosemagnet-backed "Artemis" buttons ($1.25) on your refrigerator.  But if allyou want is one of those magnets and that's all you order, the time ittakes for a clerk to fill your order will eat you alive.</P><P><LI>Companies typically have 6 or 7 breakpoints in the shipping-costtable.  We followed the same rule.  It makes for a tidy littletable.</P></ol><P><HR><P><H3>The Lunar Resources Company Catalog</H3><P><h4>Prices and Ordering Information</h4></P><BLOCKQUOTE><table cellpadding = 1 cellspacing=1><tr><thalign=center>Merchandise<th align=center>Price<thalign=center>Notes<br></tr><tr><td><AHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Analog9501.html">January 1995 Analog</a> <tdalign=right>$ 3.95<br></tr><tr><td><AHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Poster.html">Artemis Project OverviewPoster</a><td align=right>$ 2.50<br></tr><tr><td><AHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/moonbase.logo.html">Moonbase Artemis Mug </a><tdalign=right>$ 7.50<br></tr><tr><td><AHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/buttondesc.html">Refrigerator Magnet</a><td align=right>$ 1.25<br></tr><tr><td><AHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/buttondesc.html">Artemis Button</A><tdalign=right>$ 1.00<br></tr><tr><td><AHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/moonbase.logo.html">Tote Bag </a><tdalign=right>$ 9.95<br></tr><tr><td><AHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/moonbase.logo.html">T-Shirt </a><tdalign=right>$12.50<br></tr><tr><td><AHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/ltvcat.html">Lunar Transfer Vehicle</a><tdalign=right>$ 949,999,999.95  <td>(F.O.B.

Bennett</I></P><P><HR><P><P>When people ask "why haven't they" about Paramount Pictures filming aStar Trek movie on the Moon or why Lunar Prospector could raise the milliondollars they needed, they have the question backwards.  It's not "becausespace supporters are doing something very badly wrong and don't know whatthat something is", but rather "because <I>they</I> are doing somethingwrong and we <I>do</I> know what that something is."</P><P>Each case of past and current failure is a bit different.</P><P>Paramount isn't planning on filming a movie on the Moon because theyhaven't thought of it.  If someone did propose it, the executives wouldlook at the only model they have for the cost of manned space flight --NASA -- and immediately drop the idea.  That's undoubtedly why very fewpeople have, in the past, even considered a privately funded spacemission.</P><P>What they don't know <I>can</i> hurt us.  We've demonstrated that NASAat its best is never more than 10% efficient in developing and flyingspacecraft.  Depending on the program and the specific time you check, thatefficiency factor sometimes drops below 1%.  I'm not bashing NASA here;from what I've seen they are the most efficient agency in the U. S. federalgovernment.  There's just no way around it; inefficiency is endemic to allgovernment operations.  Unfortunately, the history of absurdly high cost ofspace endeavors puts almost anyone looking at private space endeavors intoconcept shock.  That is the single most difficult obstacle to overcome.</P><P>The Lunar Prospector is a case in point.  The project got stymied whenit fell into bureacracy and the estimated cost went up from one million toten million dollars.  Their fund-raising efforts were thwarted mostlybecause they went to the wrong investors.  Big aerospace companies are usedto doing things the government way, and the government is their biggestcustomer.  Even if their executives could overcome concept shock, investingin private space projects would only undermine their current businessbase.</P><P>Now, don't go into concept shock about the real cost of a privatelyfinanced moon shot.  We've been digging as deep as we can into ourestimates for The Artemis Project and still haven't found anything thatwould drive the cost over four million man-hours. We might discover a lotof things hiding under the rocks when we break it down to more detailedcost estimates.  That's one of the reasons I used the very high burdenedlabor rate of $75 an hour (in 1994 dollars).</P><P>Don't underestimate the impact of the "space is astronomicallyexpensive" message that gets drubbed into our brains every time the nightlynews covers a space program.  We all know that NASA's budget is trivialcompared to total federal outlays, but that doesn't stop politicians andill-informed talking heads.  All they see is that space is big and flashy,so it <I>must</I> be expensive!</P><P>I'm not the only one who has figured out that even NASA's trivialexpenditure for space flight is still absurdly high.  There must be a dozenprojects in the talking stage that just started in the last year or so.People are beginning to realize the truth about the promise of spacetravel.</P><P>There's a good reason why it took so long for people to figure it allout.  Consider the type of individual needed to put it all together.  Todoubt a fundamental paradigm like "how much does it cost to build aspacecraft" one has to be in a position to see it all happening.  Therearen't a lot of guys around who have spent 20 years in the aerospaceindustry, worked in both the private and government environments, managedmultimillion dollar NASA projects to develop hardware, lived throughdevelopment efforts in both those environments from concept through flight,and on top of it all have the open mind and inquisitive nature to figureout what's going on.  He needs extensive experience in running differentkinds of business organizations to be able to build the mental modelnecessary.</P><P>To see the commercial possiblities, that same rare individual needsvisibility into the magnitude of costs of others things so he'll havebenchmarks of comparison.  That's where potato chips and movies come in.He has to be an observer of human behavior to realize that to the averageman space travel is entertainment and nothing more.  He has to have a largeenough world view to cope with the concept that homo sapiens is indeedheaded for the disaster Mr. Malthus predicted and the Club of Rome provedso long ago.</P><P>Most folks would really prefer to just collect their paychecks and gohome to watch football.  It's a lot of work to keep digging after the bighand hits five o'clock, to keep looking for ways to drain the swamp whileleaping from the latest snapping alligator.  Our individual has to besomeone who lets the alligators take care of themselves while he surveysthe entire landscape.</P><P>To make the project work, he has to have a good track record as a Leader.  We're looking for someone who can build and maintain astrong organization rather than an ephemeral charismatic cult leader.  Hemust be able to cut through the red tape of organizational politics to findthe root of problems as they arise, and be immune to the cries of Chicken Littlewhile looking for the stimulus that caused them.</P><P>Most of all, he has to be someone who habitually puts aside his ownself-interest to get the project done; not a martyr, but a realist with amotivation that goes well beyond even the project at hand.  A stronginstinct for damsel-rescuing would work well as a motivation; how oftendoes El Quixote get to rescue three billion damsels at the same time?</P><P>There just aren't a lot of people who fit those criteria.</P><P>Unfortunately, I've left out the two very most important characteristicsour rare individual must have for a project like Artemis to succeed: theability to communicate the real facts to enough interested people so theywill believe it, and the time to do it all.  Only history will tell if suchan individual really exists.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Wed, May 15, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

The primary complaint around here (nearthe Johnson Space Center in Houston) is that Space Center Houston chargestoo much money for a disappointing product.</P><P>     It's mostly a matter of improper planning and design, coupled with aseries of unfortunate business decisions made after Space Center Houstonwas built.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>A Theme Park That Isn't a Theme Park</H3><P>     They contracted with Disney Imageering to design the complex, so whatthey got was a system set up to be run and maintained like one of the bigDisney theme parks.  Apparently the philosophy behind the design was that,like the Magic Kingdom, it would be a place where people would arrive earlyand spend the entire day.</P><P>     Designing an all-day attraction led them to design a facility thatrequires an enormous staff to run it.  If you tour the place, you'll seemost of the staff standing idle nearly all the time, but you'll also noticethat it would be difficult to eliminate any of those staff positionswithout redesigning the function.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Facility Design</H3><P>     Unfortunately, the facility does not provide an environment wherepeople want to spend a whole day.  It's at most a four-hour Saturdaystop.  There isn't sufficient variety of entertainment to keep theminterested.  Instead of offering a large selection of vistas andadventures, Space Center Houston shuffles its audience repeatedly throughthe huge atrium where exhibits get worn out without ever being visited.</P><P>     If we want people to spend an entire day at our facility, we mustprovide a variety of environments and lots of entertaining places to restbetween adventures.</P><P>     People need to be comfortable, too.  Bathrooms should be obvious,clean, and plentiful; never a long hike away.  Although only 25% of theU.S. adult population smokes tobacco, each of those smokers is a member ofa family.  Space Center Houston is a huge facility all under one roof,where there is a long walk through the crowded, cluttered food servicefacility if someone wants to step outside and enrich the atmosphere; so bymaking smokers uncomfortable they lose repeat business from entirefamilies.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Food Service</H3><P>     Food service is not adequate for an all-day stay, either.  Originallythey had a nice up-scale restaurant, but it was too up-scale for theaudience.  Several smaller versions, like the Blue Bayou at Disneyland,would have worked; but the Silver Moon Cafe didn't make it.  The food andenvironment didn't match the price, and despite having a large staff,service was often slow.</P><P>     Nevertheless, closing the Silver Moon Cafe was probably a fatally baddecision because it was the only thing that would attract repeated visitsfrom the local audience.  Now the only food service available at SpaceCenter Houston is the rather severely over-priced fast-food servicecounters.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Location</H3><P>     Houston is not a tourist town.  Perhaps a dozen days a year theweather is pleasant enough to spend some time outdoors, but the rest of thetime it's only marginally able to support human life.  Although Houston isthe fourth largest city in the United States (behind New York, Chicago, andLos Angeles, in that order), there are few tourist attractions.  Few peoplewould travel from afar just to spend four hours at Space Center Houston, sothey should have built the facility with the local audience in mind orthey should have planned the facility to be a huge theme park like theMagic Kingdom or the Six Flags theme parks.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Attractions</H3><P>     They do offer a couple of tours of the Johnson Space Center -- thefacilities tour and the mission control tour -- where open trams drivearound the site and make a few interesting stops.  However, since most ofthe local population work at JSC, these tours are primarily populated byschool children from the Houston elementary schools.</P><P>     Inside the building, you can stand in line for hours waiting your turnat a little Space Shuttle landing simulator.  These are kind of fun, butmore entertaining Shuttle simulators are available for home computers; andthe software cost is about equal to what you'd pay for a single visit toSpace Center Houston.</P><P>     The star of the show at Space Center Houston is the museum of realspacecraft, all of which are national treasures owned by the U.S.government.  Unfortunately, to visit these you have to pay to get in andthen wait in line to watch a 10-minute movie.  After the movie, you areherded through a guantlet of poorly lit corridors to view from afar thepoorly lit displays.  The presentation throughout echoes a theme of howgreat the U.S. space program used to be, with a little bit of how wonderfulit would have been.</P><P>     For a couple decades, those same national treasures were exhibited forfree at the Building 2 Visitors Center at the Johnson Space Center.Engineers would cruise by on their lunch hour to gawk at them close up,perhaps to learn a bit and to pick up inspiration about what we could do inthe future.  Moving them to an environment where people have to pay anexhorbitant fee has raised a lot of resentment toward Space Center Houstonwhich, of course, drives the audience away.</P><P>     A few live shows are conducted in the open-sided space station module,where the audience is forced to sit on uncomfortable bleachers and wonderwhat the actors are saying.  The poor sound system is just as well becausethe script is mostly pop-culture social engineering, with not much to belearned about space flight and none of the sense of wonder inherent in thesubject matter.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Souvenir Shop</H3><P>     This is probably a reflection on the quality of space-relatedmerchandise available, but the souvenir shop at Space Center Houston offersa limited selection of junk at incredible prices.  The souvenir shops inHuntsville and Spaceport USA, as well as the souvenirs shops at most everyplanetarium in the country, knock its socks off.  Besides reducing theiroverall revenues by having so many walk-away customers, the souvenir shopalienates the audience by reinforcing the facility's image as a tacky,greedy, money-grubbing bureaucracy.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Price</H3><P>     When you add it all up, a visit to Space Center Houston costs about$100 for a family of three.  For the same investment of entertainmentdollars, one can take one's son to the park, buy him some fun toys, go to amovie, eat in a nice restaurant, raid the local bookstore, do a tourthrough Discovery Zone (where he has lots more fun without the stress ofall those waiting lines), and rent a movie from Blockbuster Video.  Wehaven't been back to Space Center Houston since they started charging forparking.</P><P>     They've priced the experience well past the peak of thesupply-and-demand curve.  Over the few years since it was built, managersat Space Center Houston have responded to small audiences by raising theprice, and then raising it again.  This of course drives away even morecustomers, so their audience and revenues are even smaller.</P><P>     If they want to earn a profit from Space Center Houston, they shoulddo a bit of redesign, lay off 75% of the staff (or use their talents toimprove the place), and drop the price to about $4.00 per person.  And forpity's sake, don't charge for parking.  They might even just open thedoors, ask for a volunteer staff like most of the museums do, and put adonation bucket out front; at least they'd get their costs and revenuescloser to the break-even point.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Quality and Competition</H3><P>     The only logic behind raising the price when your price is already sohigh that you're driving away your audience only fits if your facility issaturated, and if you have no competition.  However, even those of us who'dlike to enjoy space flight and want our children to learn about it avoidthe place.  Despite their hope that people would come from all over theworld for a unique experience, Space Center Houston has lots of competitionfor everything they offer.</P><P>     Every child will learn more about space flight from watching television,reading books, and playing video games.  These alternative sources deliverthe education without the stress of crowds and waiting lines, and withouta barrage of social engineering propoganda.  </P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Advertising</H3><P>     Space Center Houston's advertising is its own worst enemy.  Bypromising more than they deliver, they create a growing audience ofdisappointed visitors.  Those visitors will never be back, but even worsefor the revenue picture, they tell their friends about it.  No facilitywith a popular impression of being "over-priced and disappointing" has achance to survive as a business enterprise.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>How we can do it better</H3><P>     We've talked about doing theme parks and theme park attractions forthe Artemis Project.  The experience from Space Center Houston makes itobvious how not to do it.  Now we have to figure out the right way to doit.</P><P>     The keystones to a space-related theme park are variety and adventure,especially adventure, delivered at a reasonable price.  That meansridefilms, restaurants, hands-on museum attractions, and a dedication toquality education reinforcing the entire experience.</P><P>     And above all, we have to make sure the audience realizes that just byenjoying themselves at our theme park, they are contributing to the programthat will allow each of them to travel in space and experience it for real.</p><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><P><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Mon, Mar 4, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

Bennett</I></P><P><HR><P><P>Let me explain why you want to work with <ahref="http://www.tlrc.com/">The Lunar Resources Company</a> to make thisproject happen.</P><P>The Lunar Resources Company's Role in the Artemis Project: The folkswho formed The Lunar Resources Company have taken the personal risk, interms of money, personal reputation, and all of their free time, for yearsto get the Artemis Project going.  To date, all of the people participatingin The Lunar Resources Company have done so with no financial reward atall; some of us forgoing considerable amounts of money to nurture thisprogram.</P><P>For example, my participation in this project continues to cost memany thousands of dollars, both in personal expenses and in earnings I'vehad to forgo because I'm doing Artemis Project things instead of writingstories and doing consulting.</P><P>Without LRC's effort, there would be no Artemis Project.  And withoutthe Artemis Project, the most you could hope for in your lifetime would beone or two commercial robot rovers and just maybe a politically motivatedscientific mission.</P><P>The Lunar Resources Company created <a href="/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety International</a> and used its own capital to get the organizationgoing.  Without LRC, there would be no Artemis Society, and no way for youto participate in a spaceflight program.  The company continues to underwrite ASI at its own risk.Without The Lunar Resources Company, the Artemis Society is just anotherclub for space fans.</P><P>The Lunar Resources Company has established an international networkof business resources that can take anything created for the ArtemisProject milieu to market more cost-effectively than any other method youmight choose.</P><P>The Lunar Resources Company is the only company committed to investingall its net earnings in the lunar community.  This is LRC's reason forexistence.  We can hope there will be others; indeed others are being setup.</P><H3>About Other Business Ventures</H3><P>Now, having written a sales pitch about The Lunar Resources Company,I have to point out that this can't be a one-company project.</p><P>People are always encouraged to start their own businessventures to participate in the Artemis Project.  That's not a joke;  I'mserious.  We don't have the resources to create every business venture thatit will take to get this thing done.  Besides, the more products andservices are available, the more fun it will be.</P><P>Some folks are tuned to this business stuff; some aren't.  If youcan, please do it.  Those with business talent can create employment forthose with other talents and interests, but <I>somebody</I> has to do thebusiness work.</P><P>If your business can do things with LRC to everyone's benefit, that'sgreat.  But if not, do it anyway; it's still great.  You can conduct yourown business -- be it a corporation, partnership, or sole proprietorship --and have your own Lunar Base Development Fund.  You can use that fund topurchase stock in the moon base, independent of ASI or LRC or anybody else.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Tue, Sep 3, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

<!-- v 1.0 -->
<h2 align="center">Artemis Data Book</H2>
<h2 align="center">3.7 Work Breakdown Structure</H2>
<h2 align="center">Labor Pool Proposal</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>R. Alonzo Fyfe</I></P>
<P><HR><P>

<P>I would like to propose that a "call for resumes" be sent out
for those who wish to volunteer their technical knowledge and expertise to
the Artemis Project. These resumes are to be stored in a file which Task
Force leaders can access in order to evaluate and to pick personnel whose
knowledge and expertise can be used to complete the tasks assigned to
them.</P>

<P>Before a call for resumes can be made, it is important to have the
necessary infrastructure established in order to efficiently process these
resumes. But because this infrastructure is needed to handle the task,
determining the nature of this infrastructure is dependent on (and best
discussed after) the identification of the task it is to be designed to
accomplish.</P>

<P>Once the infrastructure for managing the input from a call for resumes
is set up, a message is sent out on the mailing list, perhaps to the
newsgroup sci.space.policy and attached to the web page, asking those
interested in volunteering time and talents to the Artemis Project to
submit resumes that identify their fields of interests and the talents,
expertise, and other resources that they can contribute to fulfilling the
Artemis Project's goals.</P>

<P>The type of message I am thinking of would look something like this:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The Artemis organization is entering a new phase. We have
sat for a while discussing what we are going to do. We have even sketched 
out a few ideas on electronic napkins and pieces of scrap paper scattered 
around the dining room table. We are now ready to roll up our sleeves and 
head on out to the shop to start converting ideas into something real.</P>

<P>"Many people have volunteered to contribute their expertise, the benefits
of their experience, and their time to this project. We would like, at
this time, to take stock of the resources that you have offered. We would
like to ask those of you interested in contributing to the project to
submit two documents:</P>

<ol type="1">
<P><LI>A short resume (1,000 word limit) listing:
<ol type=A>
<li>The type of work you are interested in doing.
<li>The amount of time that you are willing to contribute. A listing of
specific hours that you are willing to work, if possible, will be a plus.
<li>Your recent employment history.
<li>Your educational history
<li>Relevant honors and professional associations
<li>Recent relevant work experience and/or educational training. This
should highlight specific projects that you have been involved in and/or
classes you have taken that you think make you uniquely qualified to
perform the tasks you are asking to perform.</ol>

<P><lI>An even shorter (150 word limit) cameo - a short paragraph
highlighting the key points that can be found in your resume.</P></ol>

<P>We want to stress that we are NOT yet asking for applications for
employment. We are not yet at a stage where we can start offering people
jobs. But we have heard from quite a few people who share our enthusiasm
and interest in adventuring into this final frontier and who, like us, are
eager to get to work now. Some of us are already getting our hands dirty.
We are eager to do as much as possible as quickly as possible, so we want
to know exactly what resources, in terms of time, talent, and training, we
can draw upon.</P>

<P> Naturally, when we do get to the stage where start hiring people, we will
look first at those who helped us the most in getting to that stage.</p>

<P> We seek to make these cameos and resumes available to our task leaders.
The cameos should contain a list of key words, so that when a task force
leader needs somebody with particular skills he can search the directory 
for the relevant key words and get a list of those with the relevant 
expertise. The cameos will allow the task leader to narrow his search. 
They can then call up the most promising resumes and contact the
volunteers.</P>

<P>Please be assured that the resumes and cameos will be kept confidential;
access to this information will be limited to Artemis executives and
authorized task leaders</P>

<P>Also, please note that we are seeking not only engineers and scientists.
We have a ton of administrative work that needs to be done, from answering
mail, database maintenance, electronic filing, and web page maintenance, to
accounting and legal work. There is room in Artemis for everyone.</P>

<P>If you are among those of us too anxious to see the final frontier opened
up to wait, please send your resumes and cameos to
Volunteer@.............</P></BLOCKQUOTE>


<H4>Resources needed:</H4>

<P>For the sake of efficiency, I suggest that a separate e-mail address be
set up for receiving resumes. Furthermore, I recommend the name 
"volunteer" in this address or something similar as a means of reinforcing
the fact that those who send in resumes are not applying for employment.</P>

<P>Computer directory space needs to be set aside for these directories
(with appropriate backup - the time and talents people will be offering
are too valuable to risk losing to a computer crash).</p>

<P>A team should be established to manage these resumes. This department 
should be staffed in advance with enough people to receive the resumes and to
place them in the appropriate directory. Also, they should acknowledge the
receipt of all resumes and cameos, and request clarification (or reject)
those that are too long, missing a list of key words, indicate that the
volunteer is mentally unstable, and the like.</P>

<P>Also, this Department of Personnel will be responsible for handling the
search requests submitted by task force leaders and in transmitting the
results of the search, and in transmitting resumes to those requesting
them, and maintaining the security of this database. The department will
need to keep this resume file updated by noting such things as: who is
already working on a task, removing applicants who no longer want to
volunteer their time or who want to take a leave of absence, and making
changes in such things as level of training, professional experience,
e-mail address, and areas of interest.</p>

<P>Task force managers should be required to fill out a performance
evaluation on each member of their task force at regular periods (six
months, recommended) which are also to be attached to volunteer's file.
However, these files should be secured, and only the department
administrator should have access to them.</P>


<H4>Example:</H4>

<P>For the work that I have been assigned, I would like to have the input of
individuals who have experience in sales and marketing. I would send an
e-mail to whomever maintains the labor pool with this request. They would
run the name through the system and generate a short list of people with
those skills and mail me the cameos of those people. I would read through
those and pick 4 or 5 resumes I would like to look at. Once I get the
resumes, I can then make my choice and e-mail those who seem the best
qualified.</P>

Some folks just liketo show everybody how smart they are, and the easiest way to do that is totake an adversarial position.</P><H3>Business Competition</H3><P>A few people perceive the <a href="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a> ascompetition for their own lunar projects.  That worries us because it meanswe're not getting the point across that we're doing our best to provide amechanism to create demand for those projects.</P><P>Frankly, we made a mistake in starting out with a commercial companybefore we put the <a href="/asi_index.html">Artemis Society</a> together,and now we're working hard to correct that.  For this thing to work, wehave to make it attractive to many companies all over the world -- it notonly has to make good business sense, but has to be palatable in terms ofbusiness ego, too.  People justifiably have great pride in the work they'vedone to build a business, and however we tailor the <ahref="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a> it has to let each company retainits own individual identity.</P><P>Right now it's a question of which business leaders have the guts tostep up and support the project, putting their corporate reputation on theline <I>before</I> "the Artemis Project" becomes a household word.</P><H3>Prefer Government Programs</H3><P>A few people (maybe two or three) have intensely disliked the ideabecause it would weaken their efforts to get the U.S. government to do amanned lunar base.  We can sympathize with those feelings, but after poundingon the government for the past 20 years to return to moon, we're convinced thatit's just not going to happen.  And if the U.S. government did do a lunarbase, it would really be a setback for opening the space frontier; a governmentfacility would be just that, not a program to get folks like us to the moon.</P><P>A couple of the vocal opponents do have a vested financial interest inthe government having a monopoly on manned space flight -- when your day jobdepends on advising the government, it's not fun to watch NASA's budgetdwindling while a bunch of upstarts start talking about commercial aerospace.(Admittedly, at the core of those upstarts are veterans of the U.S. spaceprograms; but we're upstarts in the commercial world.)<P>We're happy to report, however, that <I>none</I> of those vocalopponents has a NASA civil service badge; NASA went on record in favor ofthis thing as soonas they heard about it (there has not, however, been a policy statementmade).  And we have spoken to the most experienced NASA aerospacecontractors, who are all for it, too.</P><H3>Fear</H3><P>Among the general population we've told about the <ahref="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a>,though, you'll find a reaction you might not expect: fear.  Fear of gettingtheir hopes up.  Fear of being told they can go, too; and then finding outit's not going to happen (again).  Fear of failure.  Fear of success.  It's areal human emotion, and one we have to deal with.</P><H3>Concept Shock</H3><P>The whole idea is so big and so complex that it defies the ability ofthe human mind to encompass the whole program in a single thought.  And it'sso different from their experience, many people who are currently working inthe U.S. government's space programs just can't believe it.</P><P>Here's an example of concept shock at work: Some of the team who did theengineering integration work for SpaceLab -- the European Space Agency's<a href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/shuttle.html">Shuttle</a>-based laboratory --couldn't believe that <a href="/adb/04/03/06/01/">SPACEHAB</a> couldpossibly be done for the amount of money they had budgeted.  Keep in mindthat SpaceLab and SPACEHAB were done by the same company in the same city.But when the SpaceLab engineers transferred to the SPACEHAB program, theylearned that indeed a commercially developed manned laboratory could bebuilt for much less than 10% of the cost of a government laboratory,matching function for function, specification for specification.</P><P>The point here is that people whose entire career is in governmentaerospace have a terrible time understanding commercial aerospace.  Those ofus who started in commercial and then moved to government projects after afew years have had a similar hard time adjusting -- sometimes it is a matterofdeveloping a whole new level of stoicism.  It's just plain the nature ofgovernment programs, and has been since the days of ancient Rome.</P><H3>Legitimate Concerns</H3><P>Now, all that said, many people have raised very legitimate issues.This is a great goodness -- it forces us to be more rigorous in our researchand analysis. When this happens, we devote manpower and fix it.</P><P>We'll admit we've grown weary of answering the same <ahref="FRO.html">issues</a> we've addressed many times before; but we knewthat would be a factor from the first day. There's value even to thatweariness, though: it drives us to write it down and continuously improvethe way we relate the answers until we have a succinct, understandablestory for every one of those concerns.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Fri, March 15, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

Bennett</I></P><P><HR><P><P>Some of the discussion here concerned what would happen if our first mannedlunar mission suffered a catastropic failure.  Not surprisingly, thisquestion has come up several times before, and probably will come up again.</P><P>I don't like to talk about (or think about) a disaster scenario, but if itdoes happen, we won't pack our bags and give up.  Once we've recovered fromthe shock, we'll press on with even more determination.  This I know frompersonal experience.</P><P>From a grisly, gruesome, purely financial standpoint <nobr>. . . well . ..</nobr>consider that the only two real space missions which have had full-length<a href="/adb/03/04/movie-revenues.html">feature films</a> made about themwere STS 51L and Apollo XIII.  I don't wantto dwell on this, but after such a disaster, it would be even easier toraise money for another shot.</P><P>The cost of a reflight depends upon the disaster scenario and why ithappened.  If it's a <a href="/adb/04/01/01/01/">launch</a> failure, we'llprobably get a reflight at noadditional cost.  The <a href="/adb/04/">spacecraft</a> will be (must be,by U.S. law) be insuredfor its replacement cost, so the only additional cost would be anotherinsurance premium plus some recurring cost from the operations team.</P><P>If we somehow failed to do our homework so that a major flaw in one of ourvehicles or software lead to disaster, we would be forced into a majorredesign to correct the flaw.  That could be expensive, perhaps doublingthe vehicle cost because we'd be even more timid about the next shot.  We'dwant to do a lot more testing before committing to another manned flight.If the problem was a human error during the flight, we'd want to invest alot more in training the crew (including the flight controllers) andchecking everyone's work.</P><P>No matter what, we won't stop; not even after we're there.</P><PRE>     "Never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never give up!"                                             -- Winston Churchill</PRE><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Wed, Apr 17, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

The licensewould also have to enhance the image of any artists involved.</P><P>At this time such benefit would likely be gained only by new artistslaunching their careers due to the fact that Artemis does not yet have muchpenetration in the market place.</P><h3>Artemis / Celebrity Associations</h3><P>Established artists could, by association with Artemis, increase marketawareness of Artemis. Due to the fact that most of the benefit would likelyflow to ASI it is probably ASI that would pay for such endorsements and notthe other way around.</P><P>There might be an exception in the case of long established artists whohave been absent from the market for some considerable time, such aswhen a celebrity from the 70's or 80's wishes to re-launch theircareer.</p><P>The most likely scenario I have been able to devise is for Artemis to gosearching for partly forgotten celebrities and take on the management oftheir career for the purpose of re-launching it. As this would involve someup-front investment it would probably need to be done in conjunction withan established artist management business.</p><h3>Selection of Songs / Artists</h3><P>There has been some comment on which songs or artists would be mostsuited to Artemis, and some of these comments have been based on personalpreferences.</P><P>As with any entertainment product, all judgments should be made purelyconsidering commercial viability.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sat, Apr 15, 1996<br>Content by Jason Horton <ahref="mailto:mcontact@gil.com.au">&lt;mcontact@gil.com.au&gt;</a>,maintained by <AHREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar ResourcesCompany</a>.</font></body></html>

<P>The spacecraft will be bristling with external cameras.  Most would be
fixed on some part of the external surface of the spacecraft, but one or
two would be on long, skinny booms to photograph the spacecraft in
flight.</P>

<P>The lights required would look a bit like the typical floodlights you
see around big buildings.  Imagine a 1 inch diameter tube, 4 inches long,
in a reflector 6" x 8"; and some sort of box around it with mounting
bracketry to fasten it to the spacecraft. These too would be scattered
around the external surface of the spacecraft, illuminating both it and
either the space station or the lunar surface.</P>

<P>The cameras would look like little cans; we can fit even a
high-resolution video camera into a box 3"x3"x8". These would be mounted on
mechanical bases which can tilt and pan by remote control.</P>

<P>Thermal insulation on the outside of the camera, because of the harsh
sunlight and freezing shadow in space, means only the lens would show on
the camera. There would probably be a need for a moveable sun shade on the
camera.</P>

Through new compression techniques, the bandwidth consumed by evendozens of the cameras could be very small and easily manageable in comparisonto the several real-time productions-quality video channels which would becollecting internal video of both scripted scenes and stock footage.</P><P>These cameras would be very useful. Their primary task would be to getsome really neat footage of the spacecraft, space, nearby celestialobjects, and footage of EVAs and assembly. This video would beindispensable, and would be valued at many times the cost of the videosetup.</P><P>These systems have several other applications, such as science. ImagingEarth and Moon would be useful, and could have scientific value. Dependingon the design of the cameras, it would be possible to do imaging of theMoon and Earth, and possibly the solar corona using careful application ofthe camera's movable sunshield, with a variety of wavelengths and filters.Resolution is an unknown and important factor; however, a scientificapplication is a possibility.</P><P>Also, using the various cameras for star tracking is anotherpossibility. Either as a redundant backup system, or to reduce some or mostof the need for special guidence star-trackers, the cameras would have ause.</P><P>With careful design, the electronics and computing power involved in thecameras, for their recording and transmission to mission control, couldfind other applications in non-peak use times. Having extra processingpower for compression would allow more channels of video to be transmitted,increasing the quantity of footage produced by the mission.</P><P>However, these cameras have another important spin-off: monitoring thespacecraft. When not collecting any new or useful footage, the cameras cango into low-bandwidth mode (higher compression, low frame rate, lessresolution) and image the external spacecraft. This includes assembly,docking, and engine burns, as well as possible contingencies.</P><P>These cameras would be extremely useful in contingency situation. As anexample, imagine how valuable external video would have been on Apollo 13.Having these cameras would provide much more information for the groundsupport team and crew alike, and would lead to a faster, better analysis fothe situation and course of action.</P><P>External video equipment would be very valuable even in its primaryfunction of capturing footage of the flight; however, they are madeindispensable by the secondary applications of the video systems.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Mon, Aug 26, 1996<br>Maintained by <AHREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar ResourcesCompany</a>.</font></body></html>

<P><HR><P>

<P>In a brainstorming session among some Artemis Society members, the idea
to have a solar sail race around the moon came up. Unfortunately, the third
party which pursued the idea was unable to secure corporate sponsorhip.
Part of the problem was the nature of the program -- a solar sail race
would be a slow-motion event as seen on television -- but it seems the
major problem was that they didn't find the Right Person to handle
marketing the program.</P>

<P>There's a paperback book out chock full of nifty solar sail stories,
with a blurb in the back about the proposed project. It is entitled
<I>Project Solar Sail</i>.</P>

<P>Perhaps because of the lack of interest from corporate sponsors, they
are really big on the idea of getting government funding for this.
However, it may be a good idea to look again at private enterprise,
specifically professional sports and events like the America's Cup sailboat
race, to determine why these things have such widespread appeal.  The
answer is:</P>

<oL>
<LI>Home Team as a substitute for war heroes in human psychology
<LI>Stories (games) based on familiar characters and setting
<LI>Ability for sports fan to be an expert on the subject
<LI>Familiarity with the setting because most of these sports are things
anyone can do, on a personal scale
<LI>Wagering</OL>

<P>From an economic standpoint, wagering is probably the strongest
appeal. However, a successful solar sail race would need to address all
these elements. On the last round, the presentation of the race was too
impersonal. To sell entertainment, ya gotta have people in the picture.</P>

<P>Building a spacecraft for a race like this is not a killer effort.
Almost any college engineering department could handle it, with the
students providing the slave labor and the profs providing the technical
guidance. Obviously ASI has the expertise needed to design such a
spacecraft, though we're currently too spread out to build it. Ditto for
the National Space Society.</P>

<P>How to do this, one step at a time:</P>

<ul type=circle>
<LI>Get the teams signed up, assuming the funding will come
<LI>Get an expert on the gambling industry to handle the gambling
concessions all over the world; wherever it's legal
<LI>Develop a plan for television specials and news coverage; emphasize the
people on the teams, not the spacecraft
<LI>Build a detailed business plan with all those elements
<LI>Get commitment for launch services, assuming funding available
<LI>If the business plan is financially viable, go out for investors
<LI>Then, and only then, press the START button on the program
</UL>

<P>The key is finding someone to organize and lead the effort. The
leader would need skills in management and marketing; and it would be much
better if he were <I>not</I> a rocket scientist. Technically-oriented managers
tend to concentrate too much on the hardware instead of the people who make it
happen.</P>

<h2 align="center">5. Mission Options</H2> 
<h2 align="center">Precursor Missions in the Business Plan</H2> <P><HR><P>

<P>Although our business plan is attractive even without it, it has been
suggested that we do some smaller projects to convince potential investors that
we know what we're doing. If our current discussions with existing space
companies go as well as they should, no one will doubt the project has the
required technical expertise on board.</P>

<P>However, we <I>are</I> considering some smaller missions on the path to the
moon. First, there are scenarios for operating the lunar transfer vehicle as a
manned free-flyer in Earth orbit, and even sending it on a trip around the moon
similar to the Apollo 8 adventure. We're also looking at landing some very small
payloads on the moon consisting of nothing more than a television camera with a
transmitter or recorder.</P>

<P>Although the business plan doesn't require these missions, there are still
compelling reasons to do them.</P>

<P>We might not need to convince investors, but we do need to convince our
audience and continuously demonstrate that we are making progress toward the day
when You, too, can fly to the moon. We'll have to prove that expertise, and keep
proving throughout the life of the project.</P>

<P>Even more important, a couple decades have gone by since anything has landed
on the moon; and Clementine has been the only lunar orbiter. We need to prove to
ourselves that we know how to do this. The small television probes are intended
to be a pathfinder to serve that purpose. They'll also scout landing sites, and
serve as navigational beacons for our manned spacecraft.</P>

Mission Options</H2><h2 align="center">Using a Shuttle to fly to the Moon</H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Gregory R. Bennett</I></P><P><HR><P><P>It is occasionally suggested we consider using a <ahref="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/shuttle.html">SpaceShuttle</a> Orbiter as a <a href="/adb/04/02/01/">Lunar TransferVehicle</a>.  We'd fly it to lunar orbit,drop off our goodies, and fly it home.<P>It's an intriguing idea.  The Shuttle Orbiter has all the <ahref="/adb/04/03/05/">habitabilityequipment</a> we need, all nicely designed, debugged, and demonstrated; and thepayload bay with its robot arm and payload retention latches has everythingwe need to deploy the moon lander.</P><P>However . . .</P><H4>Vehicle Mass</H4><P>Dry weight of Shuttle Orbiter is about 250,000 lbs, compared to thespace-only <a href="/adb/04/02/spacecraft-mass.html">LTV's weight</a> ofperhaps 7500 lbs.  We'd be accelerating a lot ofmass that we don't really need in lunar orbit.</P><H4>Refueling the Orbiter</H4><P>Since the <a href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/shuttle.html">Shuttle Orbiter</a>gets to <a href="/adb/e/abbreviations.html#LEO">LEO</a> with near-zeroextra fuel, we'dhave to use other launches to get the fuel up there.  You can work out themath.  Use Isp=460 sec, delta-V=Isp*g*ln(Mo/Mf).  The delta-V requirementsare in the <a href="/adb/04/01/01/mission-timeline.html">MissionTimeline</a>.  It's a lot of <a href="/adb/04/01/01/01/">launches</a>.</P><P>The Orbiter isn't designed to be refueled in orbit.  We couldconceivably build a fixture that would enable us to attach an External Tankor two, and use the famous scenario of carrying ETs all the way to orbit.But we'd still have to get that fuel up there somehow, and we'd have tolaunch some sort of servicing fixture.  (That sounds like a really complexspace facility; not quite like the International Space Station, but close.)</P><H4>Heat Shield</H4><P>The Orbiter's heat shield is designed for entry from low Earth orbit,about 25,000 ft/sec.  Coming home from the moon, we'd hit the atmosphere atabout 36,000 ft/sec.  Whether the Shuttle could take that increasein kinetic energy is an unknown.</P><H4>Atmospheric Entry Loads</H4><P>The Orbiter is designed for 3 g's max operational load.  Assuming wedidn't use rockets to decelerate while coming home from the moon, we'd hitup to 6 g's; even up to 12 if the piloting is just a bit off.</P><P>We could use the rocket-braking scenario -- that's the way we put the<a href="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a> <a href="/adb/04/">referencemission</a> together -- but the fuel required todecelerate a 250,000-lb Orbiter is bodaciously more than what we need forthat little <a href="/adb/04/02/01/">LTV</a>.</p><H4>Radiation, Vehicle Reliability, Operational Flexibility</H4><P>Shuttle wins all those issues.  It has a proven track record.  If wegot to LEO and the Orbiter was fully operational (fuel cells and auxiliarypower units all in the green), it would probably be as reliable for therest of the mission as anything else we could design.</P><P>There's also a huge inventory of cool stuff already on the shelf thatwould enhance this mission: surface-mapping cameras, payload-baylaboratories, EVA equipment, payload deployment mechanisms.</P><H4>Long-Range Concepts</H4><P>OK, so this isn't a viable <a href="/adb/04/01/01/">first-mission</a>scenario.However, add some more ingredients and stir well, and you have a scenariovery similar to the argument for <ahref="/adb/02/07/ssto-business-plan.html">that SSTO</a>: one vehicle allthe way to themoon.</P><P>The ingredients to add are <a href="/adb/04/03/10/04/">lunar oxygen</a>to refuel the <a href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/shuttle.html">Shuttle</a>, and aservicing facility launched from the moon.  The key to those is an<a href="/adb/02/10/moon-guns.html">electromagnetic launcher</a> on themoon to keep the <a href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/">launch costs</a> down.  Thefuel tank could be designed to interface directly with the Shuttle'sattachments for the ET.</P><P>While we're fantasizing, add in a scenario where NASA approves theoriginal SPACEHAB scenario.  SPACEHAB was orginally designed to be apassenger compartment for commercial Shuttle flights.  Put a couple of <a href="/adb/04/03/06/01/">SPACEHAB modules</a> full of happy passengersin the payload bay, and we'rerunning <a href="/adb/02/07/">tourist flights</a> to lunar orbit!</P><P>It would be very difficult to modify the Shuttle Orbiter system sothat we could actually land it on the moon.  The landing gear is in thewrong place, with a big fuel tank in the way.  So we'd need anothervehicle, perhaps a carrier for those SPACEHAB passenger compartments, toget between lunar orbit and the lobby of the <ahref="/adb/02/07/lunacity-hotel.html">Luna City Hotel</a>.</P><BR><P>Since the Shuttle's design is so specific to its original mission, myguess is that we'd be way ahead with a <a href="/adb/04/02/01/">newdesign</a>; but this is certainly amind-expanding scenario.  It's certainly an interesting mental image of aspace shuttle in orbit around the moon!</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Thu, Apr 18, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

Its interioroutfitting will accommodate standard space station payload racks, and itswindows provide opportunities for Earth observation. </P><H4>LEO free-flyer</H4><P> The LTV can also fly free in low Earth orbit, supporting itscrew for a week or more of Earth observation. During these missions it canalsobe used in conjunction with NASA's manned maneuvering unit to recover or repairsatellites in low Earth orbit with no modification. </P><H4>Geosynchronous satellite servicing</H4><P> Geosynchronous orbit is that circular orbit around the Earth where we parkmost of our communications satellites. Flying a crew to and fromgeosynchronousorbit is certainly within the propulsion capabilities of the LTV; however thereis a problem: Earth's radiation belts. In its reference mission, the LTVpassesthrough the radiation belts very quickly, exposing the crew to a maximum doseof1 REM of radiation. To put that into perspective, NASA's 30-day exposure limitis 25 REM. Workers on Earth are limited to 5 REM/year, and the median lethaldose is 450 REM.</P><P>To remain for any length of time inside the radiation belts,the crew will have to be heavily shielded. Even their space suits will requireextra shielding. This doesn't make it impossible to service communicationssatellites in geosynchronous orbit, but it does mean additional development andexperimentation will be required before we can commit the LTV to this kind ofmission.</P><H4><a href="/adb/05/04/01/asteroid-mission-notes.html">Near-EarthAsteroids</a></H4><P> Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of metal-rich asteroids orbit the Sun near theEarth. An article in the Journal of Geophysical Research estimated that akilometer-sized metal bearing Near-Earth Asteroid contains up to 400,000 metrictons of platinum-group metals. Those metals would command a price of 5trilliondollars at current U.S. market prices; however, the article points out thatflooding the market with this much metal would reduce the market value to 320billion dollars.</P><P>That's still an incredible economic incentive to explore theseasteroids. The DV required to rendezvous with and explore a near-Earth asteroidis actually less than that required to land on the moon. The mission would belonger -- perhaps as long as nine months -- so the logistics of providing lifesupport for the crew become more complex. We would want to add closed-loopsystems for water and atmosphere. The total vehicle weight grows, and with it thefuel requirements. The additional fuel can be accommodated in strap-on tanks,located over the crew compartment to provide additional radiationshielding.</P><P>In contrast to the geosynchronous orbit mission, radiation is less of aproblem for an asteroid exploration flight. The primary radiation concernis the Galactic Cosmic Radiation dose the crew will receive, with theadditional likelihood of an anomalously large solar flare event. The crewcan be protected from a solar flare by providing a region of massiveshielding -- most likely the main engine compartment with all its tanks andplumbing -- which can be oriented toward the incoming proton flux.</P><H4>Circumlunar flight</H4><P> Finally, one proposed mission for the LTV can be carried out with nomodification at all to the vehicle: a trip to lunar orbit similar to that ofApollo 8. While it has been done before, it hasn't been done for a long time,and we will be able to make this exciting flight even before the other Artemisvehicles are completed. In addition to generating a tremendous amount ofpublicity for the project, such a flight would be a shake-down cruise for theLTV, the crew, and the flight support team here on Earth.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sat, Mar 23, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.Bennett</a> <a href="mailto:grb@asi.org">&lt;grb@asi.org&gt;</a>,maintained by <AHREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar Resources Company</a>.</font></body></html>

Thereis a significant revenue source to be had, but the typical roadblocks forcommerical space development (high development costs, percieved risk, longterm before realising a profit) have hampered previous efforts.</P><P>The Artemis Project <a href="/adb/04/02/01/">Lunar Transfer Vehicle</a>might make a nice fit. It has the capability, engines, DV capacity,sensors, computers, data links, and all the amenities that an OTV shouldhave. It is even manned.</P><P>However, GEO is where all the action is, and that happens to be in themost hazardous part of the Val-Allen belts. So the crew, in all likelihood,should not go on the satellite retrieval missions.</P><P>So now what good is our <ahref="/adb/04/03/06/01/spacehab-overview.html">pressure vessel</a> andsupporting systems? They triple the <ahref="/adb/04/01/01/spacecraft-mass.html">mass of the spacecraft</a>, andhave little benefit. It forces us to loft more fuel to perform the samemission in GEO, because of the deadweight. in fact, it blows the wholescenario.</P><P>So, an ideal vehicle would simple by a LTV without a pressure vessel.But we <I>do</i> need one, for some OTV missions and, of course, <ahref="/adb/04/">the moonshot</a>.</P><P>The proposal: engineer the LTV in such a way that the pressure vessel isa modular attachment to the engines/data/computer/service module section.This would add a trivial amount of mass and complexity (read cost), andexpand the LTV's capabilities (read: revenues) enormously.</P><P>This would let us loft a number of modules of several types. Perhaps anexpanded CM to allow the LTV base unit to take a crew to a <ahref="/adb/05/04/01/">Near Earth Asteroid</a>? Or a robotic manipulator toallow on-orbit GEO servicing, rather then lugging the satellite out of theVan-Allen belts ot be repaired or refueled.</P><P>Making the LTV modular would expand its capabilities andrevenue-producing potential, getting us into space faster.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sat, Apr 15, 1996<br>Maintained by <AHREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar ResourcesCompany</a>.</font></body></html>

I cansee now that there are some errors in some assumptions, but the flavor ofit is still nice.</P><P>This is obviously adaptable to Artemis Project infrastructure, and couldbe much cheaper if leveraged with <ahref="/adb/04/03/10/04/oxygen-extraction.html">lunar oxygen</a> and usedexisting spacecraft.</P><P>With revenues from the first few missions to fund a project similar tothis, it is a possible example of reinvesting revenues in space.</P><P><HR><P><P>A BEGINNING FOR SPACE RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT<BR>By Gregory Nemitz</P><P>Here is a possible mission that investment capital might be found for. Themission is to capture an Earth-crossing asteroid and bring it into lunarorbit or to the L-5 between the Earth & Moon.  A prime objective of thismission is to establish a precedent for property rights to resources inspace.</P><P>The capture of an asteroid would put megatons of mass in a situationwhere it would be relatively easy for industry to make a profit.</P><P>It is a three-phase mission.  The first is an initial survey mission onan Earth-crossing asteroid with a 2-4 year period.  The second phase wouldestablish a "beachhead" volatile gas collection facility.  The third phasewould  install the propulsion system and begin trajectory diversion tolunar orbit, or the L-5.</P><P>The initial survey mission can be done today with existing Russianflight hardware.  Two launches, a Soyuz and a Proton KM cargo transport,can be bought for around $60 million. The two-person crew will have as longas two weeks to explore and sample the asteroid.</P><P>To pay for the estimated $70 million cost for the survey mission'scompletion, we would approach those  who would  invest in the corporation,planning to realize a profit on the survey mission alone. The cable TVnetworks, the movie industry, the advertising industry, the miningindustry, aerospace companies, and others, are possibilites.</P><P>One of the survey mission goals is to lay claim and establish ownership rights ofthe asteroid's resources. The corporation would be the owner. This issuemust be resolved in the World Court.  For space development to take place,property rights must be secure. This test case can open the doors to therapid development of resources in space and define, by example, howenterprises may fairly hold just claims.</P><P>The second phase occurs when the asteroid returns to the Earth'svicinity 2-4 years later. A maximum stay time at the asteroid is desired,maybe 3-4 weeks. The crew will install a gas collection facility, customdesigned from the information learned in the survey mission. A powersupply, vacuum pumps, a gas liquefaction and separation plant, and storagetankage (empty booster casings?) are installed. The entire asteroid isenveloped in a plastic bag, and 1/4 psi of CO<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT> is usedto inflate and pressurize the bag.  The CO<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT> causes amini-greenhouse effect to warm the asteroid as it journeys sunward, andcauses the release of frozen gasses.  These gasses are automaticallypumped, liquefied, separated, and stored for use during the thirdphase.</P><P>Again, Russian flight hardware may be the most economical choice, butmaybe by then, (1998?) the Delta Clipper, SSTO will be on-line.</P><P>A prime mission of the second phase is to reinforce the claim made 2-4years previously by tangibly improving the property.  By this time thelegal world will have to come to a consensus in regard to property rightsin space.  Nothing will be resolved until some enterprise makes a claim.The law deals in realities, not conjecture. If we present the world a FaitAccompli, the issue will be resolved.</P><P>The third phase is the actual recovery of the asteroid.  We launch aself-contained habitat for 6-8 men and women, a supply shed, an equipmentgarage, and a three or four Topaz fission reactors, to rendezvous with thereturning asteroid.  The crew will have a 2-4 year mission.</P><P>A possible use for the stored gasses collected by the second phase isreaction mass for a nuclear Nerva engine.  For the event of a emergencyreturn flight to Earth,  when the third phase crew is riding the asteroidfor 2-4 years.</P><P>The asteroid trajectory diversion would be done with electrostatic dustaccelerators.  The asteroid's material is mined and then pulverized in arock-crushing mill to face powder fineness.  Any valuable elements(determined by the initial survey mission) are refined out. The waste dustis given a strong electrostatic charge. The dust is then accelerated down atube and away as fast as possible, for reaction mass.  The dust is fineenough for the solar wind to blow it out of the solar system, reducing thepollution problem inherent in pellet guns, as O'Neil proposed.  Electricityis provided by the 3 or 4 Russian Topaz nuclear reactors.</P><P>The crew takes along 6 dust engines, mounting trusses, appropriate toolsand machines to do the work of installing the engines, and mining andrefining the dust efficiently.  The excavation for the dust would be thetunnels and galleries for leased habitation, when the rock arrives at theL-5.</P><P>A simplified timeline shows the sequence:</P><PRE> Mar 1993 -  Jul 1993                   Jul 1993 - Dec 1993 Proposal developed                     Initial funding sought G.Nemitz & SD L-5                      $100k for salaries & expns. 1994                                   1995 Commitments for $70M                   Initial survey mission acquired, Asteroid identified          succeeds.

The article goes into detailsproposed by Dr. Jeffery Kargel of the US Geological Survey's branch ofastrogeology in Flagstaff, Arizona.</p><P>Kargel's recently published analysis in the "Journal of GeophysicalResearch", focuses on the platinum group metals found in asteroids.These metals are platinum, iridium, osmium, palladium, rhenium, andrubidium.  Dr. Kargel calculates a one kilometer diameter, platinum-rich metallic asteroid, contains 400,000 tons of precious metals.  At the1990 prices he estimated, that's $5 trillion-worth.</P><P>If that 1 km asteroid was mined and the metals brought to Earth, overa 20 year period, the world's supply of those metals would increaseten-fold.  The production/price relationship would cause a drasticslump in the price of those metals.  An example would be the 87,000tons of rubidium in the asteroid, worth $171 billion today, would fall to$5 billion.</P><P>Even after the price crash, the asteroid would be worth $323 billion.to recover these resources there are four identified problems: gettingto the asteroid, processing the ore, refining the ore, and bringing ithome to Earth.</P><P>The article characterizes getting there to be relatively easy, as it canbe easier to get to an Earth crossing asteroid than it is to go to themoon.  To return the metal the article suggests an electro-magneticcatapult to fling super-ingots (20 tons) at the Earth. (Yikes!!)  It doesmention that there could be political problems associated with thatplan.  To transport 400,000 tons over 20 years would mean launchingthree 20 ton projectiles every day.  It mentions that the energyimparted for delivery could be as little as a kw-h per kg of metaldelivered.</P><P>As to processing, it suggests either warming or cooling the asteroid.Warming it to molten allows working with handy-sized blobs of metal,or one could place the solar power collector between the sun and theasteroid and allow it to cool so that it becomes brittle and be moreeasily shattered into workable pieces.</P><P>The article says that the process could be mostly automated, but that"humans are good fixers and improvisers, and may be worth theirweight in rocket fuel."  Refining the metal is seen as a trivial problemthat process engineers can readily solve.</P><P>Given the current estimates of near-earth asteroids, about 60 of themare likely to be both metal and 1 km across.  The platinum content willvary but about one in ten should be at least as rich as the hypotheticalasteroid Dr. Kargel examples.</P><P>The article closes by suggesting that there may never be a companywith sufficient resources and tolerance for risk to mine an asteroidpurely on commercial grounds.  It then suggests that an Earth-colliding asteroid might be diverted by mining the metal and flinging itaway to divert the asteroid's catastrophic course, thus making a buckand saving the world.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Mon, Apr 1, 1996<br>Content by Gregory Nemitz<a href="mailto:G.NEMITZ@genie.com">&lt;g.nemitz@genie.com&gt;</a>,maintained by<A HREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar Resources Company</a>.</font></body></html>

<I><P ALIGN=CENTER>Geoffrey Landis</P></I>
<P><HR><P>

<P>Can we get enough money from grabbing dead communications satellites to pay for the
expenses? A typical older-generation commsat may have 24 transponders.
Transponders on a fully-functioning, up-to-date commsat rent for about two
million dollars per year per channel. That means that the revenue for
repairing a commsat comes to about 50 million dollars per year.  A commsat
lifetime is nominally 15 years.  Amortizing at 10% (a wild guess), fifteen
years of income equals exactly eight times the per-year income, so fifteen
years of $50 million per year gives us a net present value of $400 million
for a repaired commsat.  This is close enough to the actual cost of a
commsat that it's comfortably in the right ballpark.</P>

<P>Now, the downside.  We have to spend this money as
<I>risk</I>&nbsp;capital. Risk
capital costs a <I>minimum</I>&nbsp;of 50% more than non-risk capital. (Why
don't I
multiply the cost of money by a factor of 1.5, instead of dividing the net
present value?  Because, once the mission is done, in year 1, the risk is
gone.  The risk premium comes only in year one; after that the commsat is an
asset of known worth.) That means, roughly, if we could do the mission for
about $250 million costs, that it would about break even. But breaking even
would be <I>great</I>.  We prove out the company, prove commercial manned
space flight works, space-test equipment, and attract attention.  But can
we do it for $250 M?</p>

<P>If we can't, can we do two or three commsats in one mission for $250 M?
Possibly not, on this latter question. Geosynchronous orbit slots are hugely
valuable. It's quite possible that we could talk people into letting us fly to
one commsat, but possible that the intervening owners would not let us wander
around geosynch.</P>

<P>Can we repair dead commsats, though?  And, can we
<I>guarantee</I>&nbsp;to a bank that we can repair them, in space, the
first time?</P>

<H3>Repairing satellites in the shop</H3>

<P>Based on NASA's experience with the two satellites they brought
home, it's probably not viable to return satellites to Earth for
repair; however, with a bit of Kentucky windage,
the idea is tenable.</P>

<P>The issue with bringing a comsat back to Earth is that it costs more to
recertify the old satellite than to buy a new one.  However, dead comsats
repaired on the moon and redeployed using less expensive launch systems
would prove their worth.</P>


<h3>Servicing satellites in space</h3>

<P>Most comsats go out of service because they have run out of fuel.  If we
can refuel them in orbit, we can extend their lives for decades.  That
forces the next question: keeping the satellite electronics from becoming
obsolescent.</P>

<P>Currently comsats aren't designed to be repaired or refurbished in space.
However, if the service were available, they would be.  The heavy parts of
a communications satellite are its fuel, tanks, plumbing, rocket motors,
solar power arrays, electric motors, and antennas.  Most of this equipment
would not become obsolete unless there were a revolution in known physics.
So the parts that need to be designed for in-situ servicing are the
electronics boxes and software, low-noise amplifiers, and anything with
moving parts that is likely to wear out.</P>

<P>Satellite designers would also need to add handholds and grapple fixtures
to make it easier to recover the satellite and work on its components.
None of this is a massive design change, and some of the servicing
equipment (handholds and grapple fixtures) might be added to existing
satellites.  So altogether this looks like a viable business for a
satellite repair company operating from the moon or a spaceborne habitat
(built from lunar material, of course) situated outside Earth's radiation
belts.</P>

<h2 align="center">5.5.2 Contribution to Long-Range Plans</H2>
<h2 align="center">Effect on the Artemis Project</H2>
<P><HR><P>

<P>Most of the non-recurring costs expended for this mission will <a
href="reduce-manned-flight-cost.html">reduce
the cost</A> of the first manned Artemis Project mission accordingly.  We have
to develop the same capabilities and infrastructure to accomplish this
fight as we will when we send people and lunar base hardware to the moon.
So, in addition to producing some early revenues, this mission will also
reduce the cost of the <a href="/adb/04/">reference mission</a>. See also
<a href="reduce-manned-flight-cost.html">another essay</a> which expands on
this.</P>

<P>It is difficult to evaluate the effect this mission will have on
<a href="/adb/03/02/">revenues</a> to be earned from the <a
href="/adb/04/">manned missions</a>.  It nibbles away at part of
the market, but at the same time promises a very significant marketing
value, adding public exposure and credibility to the whole program.</P>

<P>So we can conclude that like the <a
href="http://www.lunacorp.com/">LunaCorp</a> and ISE robotic
rover
missions, a program of robotic missions to return lunar samples would be a
logical and very important step toward the Artemis
Project's goal of
establishing a permanent, self-supporting lunar community.</P>

<H3><a name="1">1. Launcher</a></H3>

<P>This hardware is not transferable to the Artemis Project, as we will be
renting other peoples' facilities and craft. This will, however, train 20
people, previously worth $50/hour, to be worth the equivalent of a
consultant at $100/hour. For 3 years of employment until the launch of the
manned mission, this amounts to, assuming 20% raise over the period leading
to launch, an increased value of personnel of $4.8 million dollars.</P>

<H3><a name="2">2. Carrier Spacecraft</a></H3>

<P>40% of this category is production cost. As we will farm the spacecraft
construction work out to McDonnell Douglas or some other aerospace company,
there would be no direct benefit to the Artemis Project.</P>

<P>The other 60% of the Carrier Spacecraft category is development. Assume
80% of the cost is skilled labour, the other 20% being workstations,
models, software, etc. If 10% of the engineering work is transferrable to
the manned project, $3 million dollars would be saved.</P>

<P>The rest of the development cost, being computer workstations and
expensive engineering software, is mostly reusable. The models and such
would not be, but at least 70% of the non-labor expenditures should be
reusable. This represents $4.5 million.</P>

<PRE>        Development Labor       $3.0M
        Development Equipment   $7.2M
       --------------------------------
        Total                   $7.2M</PRE>


<H3><a name="3">3. Robotic Element</a></H3>

<P>As the development cost of the robotic element is $50 million, with 70%
of the telerobot development engineering transferable to the nearly
identical <a href="/adb/04/02/05/04/">lunar base telerobots</a>, $35
million worth of work and experience can be reused.</P>

<P>Here, because the tasks are nearly identical, 30% of the non-labor
production costs are reusable. This makes $3 million worth of computers, 
telerobot models, battery mockups, etc. No parts are reused from the 
contractor.</P>

<P>Finally, there is no reason not to land the robots at the site of the <a
href="/adb/04/">manned landing</a>. This would leave two perfectly good
telerobots for use at lunar base, with each having a value of $20 million,
plus launch to the moon valued at about $10 million.</P>

<PRE>        Development Equipment   $3.0M
        Development Engineering $35M
        Reusable Telerobots     $30M
       -------------------------------
        Total                   $68M</PRE>


<H3><a name="4">4. Mission Control Equipment</a></H3>

<P>The ground communications stations, sample processing, and computer
equipment would all be reusable. There is nearly nothing of the one-time
cost which can't be used for the manned flight (save upgrades). Assuming
95% of the equipment can be adapted for the manned flight, $33.3M of
equipment is usable.</P>

<P>The recurring cost is assumed to be manpower to operate the machinery,
and having operated the same machinery under similar conditions is
excellent training for tracking station operators, etc. Assuming it raises
their hourly rate from $40 to $70, and 80% of the recurring cost is labor,
$2.7M of training is received.</P>

<PRE>        Training                $2.7M
        Equipment               $33.3M
       --------------------------------
        Total                   $36.0M</PRE>


<H3><a name="5">5. Recovery</a></H3>

<P>No money is assumed saved from recovery.</P>


<H3><a name="6">6. Marketing</a></H3>

<P>Although the marketing expenditures would probably be specifically for
the Lunar Sample Return project, it is likely that the simple space
awareness and concept-shock reduction will be valuable for any
space-related marketing. This might be valued at 10% the cost of the Lunar
Sample Return marketing budget, or $5 million.</P>

<P>Also, marketing plans can blow up just like rockets can, and do far more
financial damage. The Sample Return Mission will provide valuable
experience that will make later efforts much more popular. This will
directly increase the profitability of the Reference Mission, as with
experience the next marketing campaign wil undoubtedly be more safe,
effective and efficient. What we don't know about this market could cost
us, both in terms of marketing mistakes and missed opportunities.</P>


<H3><a name="7">7. Project Wraps</a></H3>

<P>Since the Project Wraps are mostly labor, no money is assumed saved
from this section.</P>


<h3>Finally...</h3>

<P>The Sample Return Mission will generate a list of contacts that, 
itself, will be of great value. More importantly, efficient business dealings 
depend on accurate information. Many businesses these days are spending a 
great deal of effort learning as much as they can about their customers
(particularly their larger customers) so that they can better meet their
customers' needs (and keep the competition at a distance). The Reference
Mission will obtain benefits both as a customer whose suppliers will have
obtained better information about it, and as a supplier who will learn a
great deal about its customers (video production companies, retail
outlets, etc.). No doubt, some of this education will result in changes
in the Reference Mission, will are likely to increase its profitability.</P>

<H3>Pro Forma Financial Statement</H3>

<P>We're not quite ready to do a complete pro forma financial statement,
but based on the <a href="business-concept.html">cost analysis</a> above,
we can get started with it.</p>


<H3>Program Cost</H3>

<P>The bottom line is that we need initial capital of $420 million to get
those samples home, plus $231 million for subsequent missions. Profit from
the first mission ought to pay for subsequent missions, so let's assume
total capital required is $420 million.</P>

<P>The next step is to figure out how much moon stuff we get for this
much money, and whether proceeds from the sale of that moon stuff yields
investors a good return on investment.</P>

<P>Let's schedule out the capital requirement, based on taking four years
to get to launch with a program start of January 1, 1997. Assumptions
made about when we need the capital should be obvious from the way the
numbers are spread.</P>

<H3>Program Revenues</H3>

<P>TBD.</P>

<P>We'll need to model the whole program in more detail to even begin to
guess at revenues. Although the <a
href="/adb/05/05/03/moonrock-marketing-strat.html">marketing
analysis</a> deems it premature, we'll need to do some <a
href="/adb/03/marketing-survey-info.html">market surveys</a> later on.
Perhaps local chapters of the <a href="/asi_index.html">Artemis Society</a>
would be willing to
distribute a questionnaire, interview folks at the local shopping centers,
or contact dealers of jewelry and collectables? How about contacting folks
who might want lunar samples for scientific or public display purposes --
planetariums, museums, universities, all those planetologists who attend
the Lunar and Planetary Science Conferences?</P>

Thisis very commonly done to raise money, and we don't have to worry aboutpeople having vested interests other than space development in thisproject, unlike with the parent organizations, ASI and LRC.</P><P>Although selling equity in the venture dilutes the profit available,it is often the only way to raise capital for a venture like this. For the<a href="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a> it also has a great deal ofappeal becuase it gets more people involved for a very long time. Ifpeople see that the stockholders of our company are well-rewarded for theirinvestment, then the boards of existing companies are more likely to bewilling to invest their own stockholders' money.</P><H3>Corporate Sponsorships:</H3><P>This involves allowing companies to associate with a much-publicizedmission, thereby drawing attention to themselves. It can be done byadvertising announcements, putting decals on the fuselage, putting our logoon their products, providing advertising on our documentation, etc.</P><P>If we play our marketing cards well, we might get a 5% margin (ofretail) from companies having our logo on their products, and announcing inadvertising "Official sponsor of the Lunar Sample Return Mission." Thiswould only work if the mission was highly-promoted, but this would benecessary to sell the lunar rock in any event, so piggybacking corporatesponsorships on a marketing campaign is an easy way to gather extrarevenues.</P><P>For decals on the flight hardware, the advertising value of putting,say, Coca-Cola's trademark on a piece of equipment that will appear oncamera is calculated by counting "impressions." For example, if you lookat a Coke billboard one time, that's one impression. If you see thatbillboard every morning on the way to work for 200 days a year, you'veracked up 200 impressions. If 100,000 people see that same billboard, thatone advertising element has earned 20,000,000 impressions. That's whythere are so many billboards.</P><P>We'd have to make some broad assumptions about camera work andtelevision coverage to calculate the number of impressions we'd get fromthat one Coca-Cola logo. It's likely that the logo would get more exposurefrom the news conferences where Coke announced they were one of thesponsors of the project. The earlier sponsors will enjoy this more.</P><P>How much is an impression worth? There doesn't seem to a consistentformula. We need an advertising expert to help us with this.</P><P>The only money we have to spend in this approach is for an advertisingblitz, but the money spent on that goes towards the main project, and spacedevelopment in general; it is well spent.</P><H3>Debt Financing:</H3><P>Borrowing money from banks to pay for items which have value, puttingthe item on the line as collateral, is used very commonly. Startup companiesoften borrow from the bank, however, you have to pay for compound interest.This can be a major drawback.</P><P>Debt financing plays a reasonable and vital role in space projects. Someprojects have such great certainty that bank financing is available.Typically, debt financing looks for reasonable, measurable risk andadequate hedge mechanisms.</P><P>For example, a building may be necessary to house Earth-sidecommunications and control equipment. That building will sit on realproperty. It represents an improvement to that property. It is collateralagainst the funds lent to build it. Although the venture building thefacility may go under, the market for real property and buildings is suchthat there is adequate salvage value for the loan.</P><P>Capital equipment to build things can also be debt financed. Even highlyspecialized machine tools often have multiple applications and hencerepresent collateral security for debt. Aircraft for weightless trainingcan also be debt financed since they have other uses. Office equipment canbe debt financed. Copiers, computers, monitors, printers, faxes, phones,furniture... all these things can be financed with debt.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><table cellpadding=2><th><td> <B>Section</B> </td><td> <B>Cost</B> </td><td> <B>DebtFinancable</B> </td></tr><tr><td> Launcher </td><td> $110 M </td><td> Yes (with insurance @15%)</td></th><tr><td> Carrier Spacecraft </td><td> $50 M </td><td> No </td></tr><tr><td> Robotic Element </td><td> $70 M </td><td> No </td></tr><tr><td> Mission Control Element </td><td> $40 M </td><td> Yes </td></tr><tr><td> Recovery Operations </td><td> $30 M </td><td> N/A </td></tr><tr><td> Marketing </td><td> $50 M </td><td> 90% (post-mission marketingonly) </td></tr><tr><td> Program Wraps </td><td> $70 M </td><td> No </td></tr><Tr> </tr><tr><td> <B>Total Debt Financed</B> </td><td> $195 M </td><td> of $420 M</td></tr></table></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Some parts of the Sample Return Project can be debt financed, such asresellable items. These include radar tracking dishes, generic spaceshipparts, buildings, office furniture, etc.</P><P>Also, endeavors sure of success can be debt financed. Launches, forexample, assuming they are insured at a typical fee of 15% can be debtfinanced; the bank will be paid, even if the launcher explodes, by theinsurance company. Cash is needed up front, so the bank doesn't have toworry except for between payment and launch about the program dissolving,and by that time we'll have a proven track record.</P><P>The flight equipment will probably not be able to be debt-financed. Ifthe program dissolves before launch, the components (all beingoff-the-shelf) will be able to be sold to another spacecraft company. Ifthe spacecraft malfunctions in flight, however, the bank would not gettheir money back. It is uncertain if a bank would fund the spacecraftparts, dependent highly upon the perceived risk. Two parallel missions wouldincrease the chances of funding.</P><P>The Program Wraps will not be able to be financed by debt because mostof that is spent on labor, with nothing to show as collateral. Thespacecraft, robotic element, mission control element, and recoveryoperations also don't sound like good candidates for debt financing unlesswe can get the service provider to carry the loan. For instance, recoveryoperations won't be needed unless the mission successfully returns thelunar samples, so would could probably retain a service provider for 10% upfront and a promise of cash once the goods are sold.</P><P>We might be able to borrow money for Marketing after the samples arehome. If we have the samples in the vault at the North Carolina NationalBank, there would be no problem in asking that same bank to lend us a fewmillion to launch a massive marketing campaign to sell them. About 90% ofthe marketing money would be spent after the samples have returned.</P><H3>Investment with Moon Rock as payback</H3><P>Companies buy rock in advance, to be paid back after the mission.Incentives such as guaranteed access at full price, or a reduced advanceprice, can be used. This is open not only to resellers, but to privatecitizens who want more rock for their money (albeit at a risk) or if supplyis predicted to be low (i.e., making sure you'll be able to get some after splashdown.)</P><P>There may be substantial sentimential motivations to purchase rock fromthe first mission, rather than from some subsequent mission, not only for theobvious reasons, but also to help along the lunar base, which would not haveflown yet. Intereest in subsequent missions will likely fall after the first mission is complete, and there will be a large fall-off in the motivation of helping to fund the return to the moon.</P><P>On the other hand, buyers might hold off until a later flight, when theprice of lunar rock would drop due to supply and demand. However, we areselling more then just specks of dirt; we're selling a chance to contributeto manned space flight and space development. A second sample returnmission will not increase the supply of moonrock associated withfundraising one bit. Because this is moonrock, presumably from where thelunar base will be constructed, both the psychological and physical linksto the <a href="/adb/04/">Reference Mission</a> will be strong enough togenerate additional impetus to pay.</P><P>For investors, and ignoring sentimental values, assuming 90% percievedchance of success, a 20% advance sale discount would be in order, assuming there will be enough rock to go around at the targeted price.Perhaps more of a reduction will be needed to lure actual investors, as theROI in this instance is only 10% spread over a number of years. At a smallprice reduction, the takers will mostly be people wanting to stake outtheir claim or get more rock for their money.</P><P>Thus, to make this work the rock must be made inaccessible, so advanceorders will be more-or-less required to ensure rock is avaliable for yourwife, museum, university, etc. The best way to do this would be to sell itoff very slowly, after a large marketing campaign to drive up demand. Thecost would be raised accordingly.</P><Br><P>Or, one could simply require advance orders for sale of all$ 3 billionworth of rock returned (or some similar sum), and fund the spaceship development with that. Debt financing could get the project to the point where advance sales would be credible, or an 86% refund offer could be made in case the spaceship explodes at translunar insertion (assuming 1:6 cost:revenue ratio, or about $3 billion of rock sales).</P><h3>Science:</h3><P>Aside from the obvious opportunity to study more lunar rock, the SampleReturn Mission has many scientific possibilities. There is a fair potentialfor exploitation of the mission's serious scientific value.</P><P>With this mission, there is an opportunity to sample rock from a classof site never before explored. Of the nine sites sampled by robotic probes,the Mare Anguus site has never been explored. One of the largest problemsfor lunar science is the lack of data--so few sites have been detailed for such a diverse planetoid. Data and rock from this site would beinvaluable to scientists.</P><P>Also, this gives data for the manned mission planning. The sample returnvehicle will likely land at the manned project's <ahref="/adb/04/01/01/03/">slated landing site</a>, so advanceexperimentation and data collection for resources and resource extractionwould be essential before committing to a specific site. Also, thetelerobot's visual data and opportunity to explore the site early on wouldprove very useful both for the Artemis Project and science in general.</P><P>There is also the opportunity for scientific research at the landingsite. Carrying scientific payloads to the moon, such as sounding explosivesfor examining subselene structure, would be able to fill in gaps inscientific knowledge, and provide information for the Artemis Project'smanned mission planning staff. There is now the opportunity to performexperiments that were not available for earlier missions to the moon at amission-enabling cost for the researchers.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Wed, May 29, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

Financing the Project</H2><h2 align="center">Moonrock Marketing Strategy</H2><I><P ALIGN=CENTER>R. Alonzo Fyfe</P></I><P><HR><P><P>It may be a little early to create a marketing survey for moonrockproducts. What I would like to offer at this point is a potential marketingstrategy and some tasks associated with that strategy.</P><H3>I. Use Established Companies</H3><P>Just as there is good reason to use established aerospace companies forspace hardware, there is good reason to go with professional companieswith respect to marketing the final products.  The idea is to sell lunarmaterial wholesale, in large blocks, to companies who would, then, breakit down and sell it on the market. For example, 500kg of material can besold to a company that supplies research institutes, 150kg to a companythat supplies museums, 500kg can be sold to governments, etc. ASI shouldpurchase (at discount prices) a block from LRC and contract with companiesthat specialize in collectables for creating Artemis Project collectables.Precisely what to offer should be worked out in negotiations with theseprofessionals and will depend on their relevant experience and expertise.</P><P>Selling bulk lunar material wholesale means giving up some of thepotential profits. However, doing so would allow taking advantage ofmarketing systems already in existence rather than inventing and buildinga whole new system. It's like the difference between using an <ahref="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/">existinglauncher</a> or building a new launcher. By building a new launcher, theproject would not have to pay the costs that would be profit to thebuilder. But it is worth it to pay this extra money to be dealing withsomebody who has experience in the field.</P><P>Task (1): Identify existing companies that may be interested in marketingmoonrocks and contact them. If none of them are immediately interested inthe concept, find out their concerns (what would it take to get theminterested). Once these concerns are known, future tasks will be developedto try to address these concerns. This, I think, needs to be done bysomebody at an executive level who has intimate knowledge of the entireproject and who has the authority to speak for the company.</P><H3> II. Legal Status of Moonrock Ownership</H3><P>One of the concerns businesses are likely to have is the legal status ofowning moonrocks. If there are any legitimate concerns to be had here,then professional legal council must be sought in order to answer thesequestions. Hopefully, it will be possible to find a licensed professionalwho is interested enough in space travel to do the work for free. If not,then I see no way to avoid the costs of hiring a professional; this is nota job that can be done by an amateur.</P><P>Task (2): A licensed lawyer needs to research the status of moonrockownership. Depending on the results of this research, legal action mayrequired in order to resolve ambiguities in the law.</P><P>Note 1: The legal status of this mission may be able to find precedent inthe legal status of whaling - which, I believe, is done on the high seas.Is there any relevant legal difference between capturing and harvesting awhale on the high seas and capturing and harvesting an asteroid in space?</P><P>Note 2: I think the bulk of the political concerns can be bestillustrated by means of the following hypothetical example: Assume theLunar Prospector discovers a single pocket of water ice. Private ownershipof this resource would be like private ownership of the only oasis in adesert. Under a private ownership scheme, the owner would have the abilityto reap "monopoly prices." The potential income would inevitably lead to afight over who owns it. On earth, these disputes have gotten peoplekilled. If the only way to own it is to take it, then the resource islikely to be squandered and wasted (like the American Buffalo and whales).If nobody can own it - period - then this would be no different than ifthe resource didn't exist at all. It is this type of case, I believe,which will determine the principles governing ownership of items in space.Political agencies should be able to recognize a difference between thisand plain, ordinary moondirt.</P><H3> III. Selling Moonrocks</H3><P>Chances are that companies will need evidence that being involved in thistype of project would be worth the cost. This means stepping into theretail business. With luck, an experienced company would see our fumblingefforts and the money we are receiving in spite of our mistakes andnegotiate a contract to take over the project.</P><P>I would suggest collecting the market for lunar-material collectables inthe following way:</p>.<P>Task (3) Create a small product catalogue. Several ideas have alreadybeen proposed. This, itself, has several small tasks. The display case foreach sample will have to be laid out and designed. Some detailed drawingswould be useful.  Each potential product would need to be researched forcost of production and time involved. Counterfeiting prevention may figurehighly in the costs.</P><P>Task (4) Create prototypes for the material. This is scissors and paper,workbench kind of work using regular earth dirt.</P><P>Task (5) These prototypes should then be "tested." They are shown tofriends, taken to conventions, pictures are posted on the web, and thelike. Input is received which is then used to modify the layout. Newprototypes are then created and tested. The catalogue would have to beupdated as well.</P><P>Task (6) Advance sales. As Greg has argued, a marketing survey is best ifit measures actual behavior. Using the prototypes and the catalogue,marketers should start to collect advance sales. The money received fromthese advance sales should be banked in an interest-bearing account, witha promise to return the money with interest (money-back guarantee) if thegoods can not be delivered. As this account grows, this should attract theinterest of people willing to make a direct investment.</P><P>Important:  This money is not touched until the goods are delivered.Spending the money in advance could be a short road to financial ruin -not to mention the lawsuits generated from people who come to believe thatthe whole thing was a scam. Putting the money in such an account willgo a long way to convincing people that this is serious, and thus likely to contribute to greater sales.</P><P>Still, without touching the money in this account, we can show it topeople and say, "This is what we have already sold. Invest in the project,and after we deliver the product to these people a percentage (to benegotiated) of this and all the other money we make will be yours." Thiscould attract some potential direct investment.  (It could also be used ascollateral for a loan, but this is worse than spending the money.)</P><P>It will be important to listen to the salespeople; who, in turn, have afinancial stake in listening to their customers. They will say what theyneed to sell the material. Give it to them.</P><P>Option: Create two different lines of products; a risk-free product linedescribed above (if we fail, you get your money back with interest), and arisk-taker/investor product line (your money goes into the LunarDevelopment Fund and will be used to finance the mission, or split, withsomething like 20% of the money going into the ASI General Fund and 80%into the Lunar Development Fund. We make no guarantee that the missionwill succeed and you may not get your money back if we fail). The productsshould be different - and risk takers should be allowed to pay somewhatless (say 75%) for comparable products.</P><P>I think it would be a good idea to take advantage of the incentivescreated by commissioned sales. People who are allowed to take 5%-10% offthe top for everything they sell end up selling a whole lot more thanthose who do not. There is a reason why they are so widely used. However,with a "money-back guarantee" it is not possible to pay commissionedsalespeople for their success and still be able to pay back all those whowould be owed money if the mission failed. Proposed solution: Salespeoplecan keep 5% to 10% of the value of everything they sell in the investmentline (since there is no money-back guarantee). This will give thesalespeople an incentive to push the investment line of products.However, salespeople will not get their commission on the risk-free lineuntil the products are delivered and the money is received from thisaccount. Salespeople will then receive their commission plus interest. Ifthis enterprise turns out to be successful enough, we won't need othercompanies.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Tue, Apr 16, 1996<br>Content by R.

<P><a name="1">[1]</a> <B>Launch costs</B>: I got that launch cost from the
<a href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/comparison-table.html">launcher data</a> we
have on
line. That's the cost for a Titan 3 launch.  We're assuming we'll want a fairly
heavy payload in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).</P>

<P>A Titan 3 will put 26,000 lbs (11,700 kg) into LEO.  Determining how
much lunar sample payload we can return to Earth with that launch mass
depends on what we assume about our spacecraft.  The big drivers are the
type of rocket we use (hypergolic vs cryogenic propellants) and what
assumptions we make about the weight of a heat shield.  We can assume a
direct entry on return from the moon, since our payload (rocks) doesn't
care if we accelerate it to 14 g's to bring it home through Earth's
atmosphere.</P>

<P><a href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/delta-series.html">Delta III</a>, <a href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/proton-data.html">Proton</a>,
or <a href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/ariane-series-data.html">Arianne 5</a> might save us a bundle on <a
href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/">launch costs</a>,
but at least this gives us a number to start with. We need to research alternative launchers, like the Delta III especially.</P>

<P>About units: That comparison-table document breaks a
rule since it only gives payload mass in French Revolution <a
href="/adb/04/units.html">units</a>.  The
conversion factor is 2.2046226 lbs/kg.  This is another plea for everyone to follow the program's convention of <a href="/adb/04/units.html">quoting units</a> first in the English
system, then in the metric system.  A couple of minutes of your time with a calculator when you produce a document will save thousands of hours for everyone using your data.  In this case, it would have taken only 30 seconds in a spreadsheet to fix it.</P>

<P><a name="2">[2]</a> <B>Carrier Spacecraft</B>: This is the vehicle that carries the surface equipment to the moon and then home again.  I guessed about 20% of development costs for the Artemis spacecraft.  It sounds about right, based on no human element, very relaxed safety requirements, commercial approach. About 60% of total cost would be for engineering, which we only have to do once; so those are  non-recurring costs if we want to do this more than once.</P>


<P><a name="3">[3]</a> <B>Robotic Element</B>: About the cost of two
rovers, FOB Carnegie-Mellon University.  A machine that can run around and pick up rocks, and then ship them home, seems to be about twice as complex as as the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/lri-3/www/moon-bug.html">Lunar Rover Initiative</a> robot.  I assumed we'd be able to reuse most of the robotic element for subsequent sample return flights.</P>


<P><a name="4">[4] </a> <B>Mission Control Element</B>: This is a rather complex facility, with tracking and <a href="/adb/04/05/02/">communication stations</a> all around the world as well as a central mission control facility.  People will have to plan and execute the
mission.  We'll need an environmentally controlled laboratory for sample
processing.</P>


<P><a name="5">[5]</a> <B>Recovery Operations</B>: This is a really wild guess.  This assumes a water
recovery, where we lease a small ocean craft to snag the package out of the
water and then lease an aircraft to carry it home.</P>


<P><a name="6">[6]</a> <B>Marketing costs</B>: Another wild guess.  We'd do
some direct mail, but mostly
this is for television advertising.  Assume subsequent missions would only
need about 20% more marketing to have the same impact once the initial
messages were developed and the public familiarized with the product. Microsoft spent about $200 million on Win95's marketing campaign, so this seems about right.</P>

<P>Let's also assume we'll photograph each sample and put a note on the
web site about who owns it in an on-line Registry of Lunar Samples.  (Of
course, buyers will have the right to privacy, if they prefer.)</P>


<P><a name="7">[7]</a> <b>Program Wraps</b>: I added a 20% factor to
account for management, lawyers,
business office, paper clips, and all those fiddly things.</P>

<P><a name="8">[8]</a> <B> Totals</B>: So, for a total investment of $420
million, we could have a
nice pile of rocks and dust in an environmentally controlled warehouse, and
a stack of orders which presumably equals our stock of trade goods.</P>

<P>Let's assume that packaging and shipping of the samples is negligible,
since we could break it up into 10,000 samples with $500 each for packaging
($5 million total) and still be well within the noise level of these
estimates.</P>

<P>Note that the recurring cost estimate says we could do it again for an
additional $231 million.</P>


<P><a name="9">[9]</a> <B> Initial Cost</B>: This is what it will cost for
the first mission.</P>


<P><a name="10">[10]</a> <B> Non-recurring cost</B>: This is how much of
the initial cost represents a
permanent investment.  This value is carried over if we do more than one
lunar sample recovery mission.</P>


<P><a name="11">[11]</a> <B> Recurring cost</B>: This is how much it will
cost us to do it again, once
we've done it the first time.</P>

<h2 align="center">Artemis Data Book</H2>
<h2 align="center">5.5.3.1 Lunar Sample Return Summary</H2>
<h2 align="center">Business Plan Summary</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Candace Dicks</I></P>
<P><HR><P>

<P>The goal of the Lunar Sample Return Project is to land a probe on the moon
which returns a quantity of moon rocks to Earth to be sold for a profit.
The revenues will be used to fund further sample return missions, and be
invested in the Lunar Base Development Fund to help pay for the manned
exploration base.  This project is also an opportunity to gain credibility
for commercial planetary space flight, especially for the Artemis Project,
to gain additional hands-on experience with space missions for the Artemis
Project team, and to establish infrastructure which can be reused for
subsequent missions.</P>

<P>The Lunar Sample Return Project is an exciting venture to return to the
moon, for profit.  A rocket would place a small spacecraft in Earth Orbit,
from where it would fire its engines to travel to and land on the moon.  A
small telerobot would then explore the landing site and collect lunar rocks
and moon dust, which would then be sent back through space to an ocean
splashdown with about 4 tons of lunar regolith.</P>

<P>The program cost is estimated to be about US$420 million.  Such a low
program cost is possible by using technologies established by previous
government space ventures, by building to commercial aerospace standards,
and the lack of a large government bureaucracy.  Funding comes from a
combination of direct investment through sale of stock, advance sales, and
debt financing.</P>

<P>The program revenues are to be determined; however, there is a high
probability that the program will generate substantial profit.  As an
example.  for about 5 cents worth of lunar rock it is possible to make a 1
cm square slide, which could be mounted on a marble plaque and sold for
substantially more then the cost of the rock and casing.  Other uses for
the lunar material include jewelry, enhancement to more mundane products,
and of course scientific samples.  Estimates of the revenues this mission
are usually over a billion dollars.  There is currently an effort underway
to determine approximate revenues in more detail.</P>

<P>These first financial estimates are simply calculations using reasonable
assumptions, and gathering marketing data by carefully grilling coworkers.
A formal market survey would provide confidence in the basis of estimate,
but a low-cost survey would be worthless because concept shock would mar
the results.  Plans for a full, more accurate, market survey are being
developed based on first introducing the concept through the Artemis
Project.</P>

Business of the Artemis Project</H2><h2 align="center">Artemis Society International and The Lunar ResourcesCompany</H2><P><HR><P><P><a href="/asi_index.html">ASI</a> and <ahref="http://www.tlrc.com/">LRC</a> are two independent organizations, withdifferent goals and motivations.  They have separate officers, separatebank accounts, and their corporate headquarters are a thousand milesapart.</P><P>Obviously, everyone involved in both organizations is devoted tobuilding this lunar base, and many of the people involved in <ahref="/asi_index.html">Artemis Society International</a> are also part of<a href="http://www.tlrc.com/">The Lunar Resources Company</a>.<P>Artemis Society International is a non-profit scientific and educationalfoundation incorporated in the state of Alabama, headquartered in Huntsville.President and Chairman of the Board of the Artemis Society is J. BoisePearson, who has no affliation with LRC, and doesn't even own stock inLRC. The role of ASI in the Artemis Project is to make the lunar basehappen.</P><P>The Lunar Resources Company is a privately held Texas corporation, and<a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Greg Bennett</a> is its President andChairman of the Board.  LRC started the <a href="/artemis.html">ArtemisProject</a> and underwrote ASI's debts until ASI got on its feetindependently.  LRC's role in the Artemis Project, like every other companyparticipating in this program, is to conduct commercial business which willresult in revenues flowing into the Artemis Society's Lunar BaseDevelopment Fund.  We do that through donations as well as producinglicensed products.  Currently the only products we have on the market arethe "<a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Moonbase Artemis</a>" lineof <a href="http://www.tlrc.com/moonbase.logo.html">coffee mugs</a>, <ahref="http://www.tlrc.com/moonbase.logo.html">T-shirts</a>, and such.  Inthe long run, we plan to develop commercial enterprises on the moon.</P><P>The whole point of starting The Lunar Resources Company was to provide away to demonstrate that commercial business can earn a profit while providingfinancial support to the lunar development project.  The role of privateenterprise in this project is vital -- without it, we cannot garner theeconomic power needed to do it.  We don't hide the fact that we formed thiscompany because we want a moon base, but we also acknowledge that we have toprovide a good return to the stockholders -- better than they'd get frominvesting in other ventures -- or we haven't succeeded.</P><P>The Artemis Society is where donations and volunteer effort go, so thatpeople know their labors will go to developing the moon rather than lining thepockets of a for-profit company.  That's an important distinction: if you dothings for the Artemis Society, it should be donated volunteer effort; butif youdo work for The Lunar Resources Company or any of the other commercial firmsparticipating in the project, you should get paid for it.</P><P>LRC does not anticipate being the company who actually builds thespacecraft.  That's a job better done by an established aerospace company,someone with all the expertise on board and processes in place to do it rightthe first time.</P><P>The Lunar Resources Company has 13 stockholders, of whom three (<ahref="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Greg Bennett</a>, <ahref="/bios/strock.ian.html">Ian Strock</a>, and <ahref="http://www.acess.digex.het/~dcarson/">Dana Carson</a>, among others)volunteered to serve on the ASI Board of Directors.  Greg Bennett is alsochairman of ASI's Board of Advisors, tasked with building an advisory boardwhich can represent the best knowledge not only in space flight, but alsoin many areas of the entertainment industry.  Remember that financial andbusiness research is as important to the success of the Artemis Project asdesigning a good spaceship.</P><P>None of the <a href="/adb/03/04/">revenues</a> of the Artemis Society goto The Lunar Resources Company, though LRC does provide -- at cost -- someof the Society's material. LRC also wrote the check for ASI's world wideweb site, for which we were reimbursed by the Society.</P><P>LRC has also offered to provide fund-raising goods (T-shirts, coffeecups, etc.) to the Society at discounted wholesale prices.  When LRC sellsthese things at retail, a portion of the retail price goes to ASI.  (It'sactually a rather larger portion than ASI would ask of other companies, butLRC is rather paternal about ASI.)</P><P>There are no secrets here.  Many other <a href="/adb/10/">commercialcompanies</A>, which may earn profits from the Artemis Project, are activelyinvolved in support of the Artemis Society.  Duncan Graphics, a Californiacorporation, also donates material to the Society.  Steve Jackson, of SteveJackson Games, is a founding member of the Society.  Space ResearchAssociates have donated a great deal of research and articles to theSociety.  It would be the same if Musicians Contact Service elected tobecome a sponsor of the Artemis Project.</P><P>Right now you'll see the phrase "The Artemis Project is a trademark ofThe Lunar Resources Company" on a lot of literature.  That's a fact; LRCestablished that trademark long before we started the Artemis Society.  Rightnow we're working out the details of transferring ownership of the trademarksand copyrights to the literature to the Artemis Society.  The issues arecomplicated, but we'll get it all figured out.  The number one most importantissue is making sure that the Artemis Project continues, regardless of whathappens to any of the organizations or companies involved.</P><P>The reason we have this problem with trademarks is that initially wethought the best way to make the <a href="/artemis.html">ArtemisProject</a> happen was by first demonstrating with a regular for-profitcompany that there are profits to be earned in this business, and therebyattracting other commercial enterprises to it.  The idea of a non-profitmembership organization to provide a means for people to participatedirectly in the project came later.</P><P>As the Society developed, it became obvious that the non-profitfoundation is the best vehicle to carry out the Artemis Project.  People aremuch happier about donating their time and talents to it; it enjoysconsiderable tax advantages; and we think that other commercial businesseswill be more willing to support the project if they're not worried aboutsomeone else's profit motive.</P><P>You might be wondering why Greg Bennett isn't President of the ArtemisSociety, since he started this whole thing.  Besides the obvious fact thathe's already overworked, the primary reason is to avoid any potentialconflictof interest, or semblance of a conflict of interest.  He had to choose betweenLRC and ASI. He's done non-profit foundations and big aerospace projects, soLRC seemed like the bigger challenge and growth opportunity.  There's yetanother strong reason -- Boise Pearson is a very wise and patient man, andhe's just as dedicated to carrying out this lunar base project as thefounder.</P><P>We enthusiastically encourage open public discussion of this wholeprocess. We're well aware that leaves us open to all sorts of criticism, andsome of that criticism isn't exactly top-quality advice.  If anyone has goodideas about how to organize this project, how to attract capital to it, how topublicize it, please do <a href="mailto:artemis@asi.org">speak up</a>.(And if you see someone venture what appears to be a silly idea, cut himsome slack!)</P><P>If anyone else has questions about this, please do <ahref="mailto:artemis@asi.org">ask</a>.  Our one goal is to make that moonbase happen.  We need your wisdom as much as your time and talent.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Wed, March 13, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

<HTML> <HEAD> <TITLE>6. Royalties for Volunteer Labor</TITLE> </HEAD><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><!-- Artemis Data Book section 6. Artemis Society International --><!-- file: /adb/06/royalties-for-volunteers.html --><!-- Keywords: volunteer products altruism revenues simulations technicalcommittee team --><h2 align="center">Artemis Data Book</H2><h2 align="center">6. Artemis Society International</H2><h2 align="center">Royalties for Volunteer Labor</H2><P><HR><P><P>One concept we're puzzling over is how to assure that contributorsare rewarded if their work is used to earn a profit.  One cannot patent anidea, and we can't sell it to buy spaceship parts, but real products<I>can</I> besold.</P><P>One example that came up in the Huntsville conference was the idea ofmembers of the <a href="/adb/06/07/simulations-tc.html">SimulationTechnical Committee</a> writing a full-up sim forengineering development and crew and flight controller training.  The projectreally, really needs that, and a fully verified simulator would save theproject big bucks.  But a full-up sim is just a couple steps away from a reallyfun computer game, and maybe even a virtual reality experience; it hascommercial as well as technical value.</P><P>The idea is to have the Simulation Technical Committee chairmankeep track of who contributes how much code to that project.  Then,if the Artemis Society is able to license use of the code in commercialproducts, the original authors could share in the royalties.  Some folksprefer that their volunteer work be purely pro bono publico, so they can signall royalty rights back to the <a href="/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a> to go into the spacecraft development fund.  Others can'tafford that luxury, so they would earnroyalties from their work, and be very welcome to do so.</P><P>Another example would be the case of an artist who contributes work toillustrate the mission for the Society's outreach programs.  That same artmight be used on a calendar based on the Artemis Project.  For preparing anifty briefing or decorating the web site, it's clearly pro bono work; but ifsomeone is going to earn a profit, then the artist should at least have theopportunity to earn royalties from the work.</P><P>This idea is a good one because everybody wins.  In addition to thealtrusiticmotivation, there is a financial motivation for contributing to the project.The important, and most difficult, part is keeping track of who contributedwhat; and perhaps dealing with the fact that not all Society activities arethings that produce potentially marketable products.  On top of all that, itreduces  capital required for the Artemis Project to develop some of theproducts, which of course gets us to the moon all that much faster.</P><P>The financial situation gets a bit complex because the <ahref="/asi_index.html">Artemis Society</a> is anon-profit educational and scientific foundation.  "Non-profit" means proceedsof the Society's business cannot inure to the benefit of the members (orstockholders, but the Society has no stockholders, just a board of directors).All proceeds go toward furthering the Society's goals.  However, it does<I>not</I>mean the Society cannot pay reasonable royalties, wages to paid employees(currently there aren't any of these, either), or fees for services.  Theimportant word there is "reasonable."</P><P>And of course any such payments would be taxable income for theindividual, which means the governments win, too.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Fri, March 15, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

The idea is to have amembership organization that accommodates all the types of members.  Here arethebasic ideas behind it all:</P><ul type=square><LI><P>Only one kind of <a href="/asi_member.html">membership</a>.  Thereisn't a separate membership    for ASI and the <a href="/adb/07/local-chapters.html">localchapters</A>.  To be a member of the local    chapter, you must be a member of ASI.  What we hope to avoid is    a two-tiered membership with only a small portion of the local    membership belonging to the <ahref="/adb/06/">international organization</a>.</P><LI><P>Chapter membership is voluntary.  A member of ASI need never    join a local chapter.  If their interest in joining ASI is just    to belong, then that is what we want them to do.  There is    nothing wrong with that style of membership, and the people    who adopt it are important to ASI for many reasons.</P><LI><P>Chapters with a focus.  When enough members in a local area    get the fever to "do something" to help get us to the moon,    then we would encourage them to form a Local Chapter to focus    their efforts.  People in the area who wanted to be active    participants could join the group (or start their own, with    some other focus in mind) to participate.  It seems that    the most successful local chapters of organizations like    NSS are organized around a specific project or goal (Oregon    L5 studies and promotes lavatubes for lunar bases; Huntsville,    Alabama L5 is building a balloon launched sub-orbital rocket).    We'd like to add a little focus to the local ASI activists    efforts, and encourage the adoption of a project for local    chapters.</P><LI><P>Focus of a Chapter.  Not every local chapter has to design    rockets or moonbases.  ASI-Milwaukee has adopted the publication    of <a href="/mmm">MMM-Pleiades</a>.  Some chapters may want to recruit<a href="/asi_member.html">new members</a>,    handle organizational chores, <a href="artemis96.html">organizeconferences</a>, do publicity,    make displays, design and produce <ahref="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">ASI merchandise</a>, etc.    Whatever reason they had for getting "active" will do.</P></UL><P>So, is this approach reasonable?  Will it help us to appeal to all types of<a href="/asi_member.html">members</a>?  Hopefully we can drive out anyconcerns or problems withthe chapter structure now, so we can start out with the best base possible.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Fri, Apr 19, 1996<br>Content by Boise Pearson <ahref="mailto:boise@asi.org">&lt;boise@asi.org&gt;</a>, maintained by <AHREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar Resources Company</a>.</font></body></html>

<P><H1>Office of Space Flight</H1>
<P><H2>Technical Committees</H2>
<P><H2>Duties for Chairman</H2>


<P>
In general, the chairman of a technical committee does the things listed
below.  Keep in mind that you can -- and should -- delegate just about
everything; your primary function is to make decisions and be the
committee's interface with the Artemis Society's Office of Space Flight.
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Define a work plan <BR>
      The work plan defines what the committee will do, and what
      products it create.  It's a living document, updated when
      something new comes up.  Its purpose is to keep track of what
      needs to be done and who's doing what.  Since we'll always
      want to do more than available resources allow, expect there
      to be a backlog.  That backlog is very useful because you'll
      have a ready answer when someone joins the group and asks,
      "What can I do now?"<BR>
      The best way to define the work plan is to ask your team for
      inputs.  Other committees will add to it by asking questions
      related to your committee's responsibility.<BR>
      The work plan should include a schedule, at least for any
      products that people are working on.  That lets other people
      know when something will be available.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Recruiting<BR>
      Recruiting new participants in each technical committee is usually
      a continuous operation.  All members of the committee can help.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Training<BR>
      Include some tasks to set up tutorials that would allow a new
      committee member to get up to speed in your discipline.
      Your goal is to create a cadre of experts in the committee's
      technical area.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Staffing Project Teams<BR>
      As the Artemis Project grows, it defines major products that must
      be designed.  This is done by the project teams.  Each project
      team will need people from several technical committees.<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Keep track of who's working on what.  Get periodic feedback on
      progress.  Make sure the quiet guy in the corner who's doing all
      the work isn't ignored.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Keep track of who contributed to the creation of a product.  If
      the committee creates a marketable product, something that
      generates royalties from commercial business, we want to make
      sure the folks who put the work into it receive the royalties.
      ASI can't pay people directly to do these things, but the Society
      can assist in making contacts with commercial business participants
      in the Artemis Project.<BR>
</LI>
<BR>
<LI>NOTE: If someone doesn't want to receive royalties for work on Artemis
      Society projects, he has the option of donating that back to
      the Society; but nobody should feel pressured to do this.<BR>
</LI>
</UL>
<LI>Draft a charter for your technical committee.<BR>
      The charter defines the committee's scope -- reponsibility and
      authority.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Maintain committee administrative information in the committee's
      organizational section of the Artemis Data Book.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Under section 6.7 of the ADB, each committee has its own designated
      area for keeping work plans, lists of committee members, procedures
      and processes, and any other administrative information that
      everyone needs to share.<BR>
</LI>
<LI> If it's a new committee that doesn't have a section of the book,
      contact the Book Boss for the ADB.  That's Simon Rowland
      (simon@eagle.ca).<BR>
</LI>
<LI>The Administrator for the Office of Space Flight can help keep the
      committee lists and get stuff into the on-line data book for you.
      That's Candace Dicks (cddicks@asi.org).<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Maintain the committee's technical products in the appropriate
      sections of the Artemis Data Book.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>While the committee's internal administrative information goes
      under section 6.7 (or 6.8 for project teams), documents which
      plan the space flight should be up front in the book under one
      of these sections:<BR>

1.  Project Overview<BR>
2.  Scenarios for Manned Space Development<BR>
4.  Reference Mission Development<BR>
5.  Mission Options<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Scientific data about the moon go into Appenix M.  That's the
      reference section where you can look up information about what the 
      moon is made of and its physical properties.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>A good way to start collecting information applicable to the
      technical committee's work is to do a World Wide Web search for
      related documents elsewhere on the web.  Ask one of the committee
      members to organize these references into a web document.
</LI>
</UL>
<LI>Provide an interface with the Electronic Communications Technical
      Committee(ECTC).<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Our office is in cyberspace, and the ECTC is our facilities
      department.  They provide the listservers, newsgroups, web sites,
      computer analysis engines, standard formats ... the electronic
      version of all those support services any organization needs.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Ask the ECTC to set up a listserver for your committee.  When
      they get the issues worked out for newgroups, they'll set up a
      newsgroup to run in parallel with each listserver.  The ECTC
      takes care of archiving and web chat groups for you; all you
      need to do is ask.  Currently (5/30/96) the only communication
      engines available are the listservers and the web site.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>The ECTC will also help with getting your documents onto the web,
      converted to html, illustrations and photos scanned and put into
      imagery library, artwork converted to standard formats.  You'll
      find them to be a very valuable resource.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Designate a representative from your committee to interface with
      each of the other technical committees.  The OSF administrator can
      keep a table of who talks to whom.  That keeps the communication
      flowing.  If you've decided there's no logical interface between
      your committee and one of the others, let's put a note to that
      effect in the table so we know it's not something we overlooked or
      accidently duplicated.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Encourage committee members to put a little biographical page
      on the web site, so everyone will know who everyone else is.<BR>

Bennett</I></P><P><HR><P><P>Each technical committee needs a definition of what it's for (why it existsand what it does), how it organizes what it does and how this fits into thelarger scope of the project, and a list of specific tasks that individualscan do.</P><P>So we need 3 documents defining the committee's work:</P><table cellpadding=2><tr><td> Charter </td><td>  Defines what the committeeis for.  It tells what the committee is responsible for doing, and whatauthority it has.</td></tr><tr><td>  Work Breakdown Structure </td><td>  This might be the "logictree." It starts at the top and breaks down the committee's work intoever-more-detailed chunks.  When we get all these put together, anyoneworking on the program will see how what he's doing fits into the grandscheme of things.</P><P>Each top-level item in the WBS ought to align to a statement in thecommittee's charter.</P><tr><td>   Task List </td><td> The detailed list of tasks, aligned underthe WBS.  These tasks are defined at the level we will ask an individual todo something.  It is essentially the lowest tier of theWBS.</td></tr></table><P>The task list should include defining the WBS and the Task List, and evendeveloping the organization's charter.  Just figuring out what needs to bedone is half the job, so the committee chairmen should use all thebrainpower and talent available to them.</P><P>Some folks are good at this; many are not.  Don't worry if you're in aleadership role but working out these task plans isn't your bag.  Outthere in big business, the President of the company doesn't do thesethings.  He has a staff of folks to do it; and if they're smart, they gothrough the whole organization chart so that the real experts arecontributing to the definition of work for their team.</P><P>At McDonnell Douglas there is an unofficial group of guys who are reallygood at this.  They wander from project to project, getting it all set up.After that it's much easier for the individual organizations to keep theirtask plans updated.</P><P>That's the essence of leadership and team participation: Use the besttalent you have available to get the job done.  Your role as a team leaderis to:</P><ul type=square><P><LI>- recruit folks to do the job</P><P><LI>- assign the tasks to individuals and teams</P><P><LI>- get feedback on what folks are doing</P><P><LI>- provide guidance if you don't think it's going in the rightdirection, and if it <I>is</I> going in the right direction</P><P><LI>- accept and approve the team's products</P><P><LI>- recognize exemplary achievement by individuals and teams</P></ul><P>If everyone on your team is completely befuddled by the idea of writingcharters and work breakdown structures and task definitions, it's alwaysfair game to go recruiting for help among the larger population.  Just posta note here, or even on <ahref="/adb/09/03/artemis-list.html">artemis-list</a>, asking for help, suchas:</P><BLOCKQUOTE> <P>"I need help defining the work breakdown structure for thePropulsion Systems Technical committee."</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Don't forget to include your name and email address in the body of yourmessage, because the mailing lists (especially artemis-list) sometimes hidethat information.</P><P>I expect that people will be delighted to help out with this.  If enough ofthe team leads ask, we might even see a team of task-planning expertscoalesce among those who are not currently participating.</P><P>Also, if you need administrative support to keep track of all these things,don't hesitate to post a note asking for volunteers. Let me encourage youto ask for administrative support; besides making your life easier, itcreates a position for folks who aren't into the nitty-gritty technicaldetails.  We've written some detailed descriptions of responsibility andauthority for existing administrative support positions which you might useas a guide.</p><P>If there are tools and resources you need besides the general forums likeartemis-list and asi-osf-leads, don't hesitate to ask.  The <ahref="/adb/09/01/ectc.html">ECTC</a> is alreadyworking on a whole bunch of nifty tools that will make the job easier, soyou might be delighted with the answer you get.  And the worst answer youcan get is that we don't yet have the resources you need.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Mon, Dec 9, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

They create tutorials and train new members of thecommittee on how to do analysis in their discipline.  They establish standardsand guidelines for design, development, test, and evaluation of all systems intheir area.</P><P>The products of a technical committee are a data base of knowledge inthat particular field, documented standards, and a team of confidentindividuals who are qualified to participate in the Product Teams.  This is anon-going effort, and will be for as long the Artemis Project continues.</P><P>For example, the Simulation Technical committee might select Ada as thecomputer language to be used for all simulations.  They assure that everyoneworking on the simulations has a working knowledge of Ada or access toadequate training.  They establish an overall architecture for the simulationsand define guidelines for what level of simulations models are required foreach application.  They decide on standards such as: all our simulations willbe digitial; for the spacecraft we will develop 3 levels of system models;real-time simulation is applicable to these things and non-real-timesimulation is applicable to those things.  The Sim Tech Comm also might haveinfluence of the standards of quality for related commercial products -- ifthey say all our computer games will have an accurate starfield in thebackground and demonstrate this is a cost-effective approach, then by gumwe'll have an accurate starfield.</P><P>Note that one of the great benefits of the Artemis Project is education.Everyone participating in the project has a chance to learn something new andexciting, and to apply those skills to a very important program.  These skillsare applicable well beyond the development of the lunar base, so both theindividuals and everybody else on the planet will benefit from the increasedskill base.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Project Teams</H3><P>Project Teams (or Product Teams) produce the products specificallyrelated to the Artemis Project's primary goal of establishing a permanent,self-supporting manned lunar base.  They have a more hiearchical structure thanthe Technical Committees because they have to produce an integratedspacecraft.</P><P>The products of the project teams are designs for the spacecraft andtheir missions, and eventually the actual hardware.  Initially, our goal is todevelop conceptual designs with sufficient detail to identify and solve allthe technical problems, identify costs, determine who suppliers for off-the-shelf equipment are, develop a preliminary manufacturing plan, develop apreliminary logistics plan (for getting the spaceship parts to the launchsite), develop mission plans for each flight, and develop ground support planswith estimates of the required mission support facilities on Earth.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Putting the Technical Committees and Project TeamsTogether</H3><P>You can see these two organizational functions matrix into each other.The Technical Committees provide the expert staff for the Project Teams, andthe Project Teams provide feedback to the Technical Committees.  This assures aconsistent, compatible design across all the spaceraft we build, and assuresthat lessons learned from one spacecraft are incorporated into the design ofthe other spacecraft.</P><P>A poignant example of what we avoid with this approach is the lithiumhydroxide cannisters in the Apollo command module and lunar module.  (I'massuming you've seen the Apollo 13 movie, or read Andrew Chaikin's book.)Individually the engineers at North American and Grumman did an outstandingjob on those spacecraft, but together they would have been even better.</P><P>The organizational matrix looks like the chart below.  For simplicity inthis memo, we've lumped everything except the reference mission into "OtherSpacecraft" and then happily ignored it.  However, we expect to take a lookat a lot of other spacecraft before we're all done; one that comes to mind isthe concept of landing a series of very lightweight spacecraft with just acamera, a nav beacon, and a transmitter.  These advance explorers might weighno more than 20 pounds each when they reach the surface, but they'll provide awealth of information about candidate landing sites, teach us a lot aboutgetting a spacecraft to the moon, and be lots of fun in the process.</P><PRE>  Technical                    Space Flight Project Teams  Committees                                Spacecraft Design Team                                         |                           |-----------------------------|                         Other                   Reference Mission                       Spacecraft                   Design Team                                                         |                                ---------------------------------                               |      |      |       |           |                           Mission   LTV    Hab    Descent    Ascent                           Design                  Stage      Vehicle  GN&C                         X       X             X           X  Electrical Power             X       X     X       X           X  Life Support                 X       X     X                   X  Thermal                      X       X     X       X           X  Pressure Vessels             X       X     X  Structures & Mechanisms      X       X     X       X           X  EVA Systems                  X       X     X                   X  Propulsion                   X       X             X           X  Mission Equipment            X       X     X                   X  Software                     X       X     X       X           X  Simulation                   X       X     X       X           X  Test & Verification                  X     X       X           X  Manufacturing                        X     X       X           X  Logistics                            X     X       X           X</PRE><P>An 'X' indicates where members of the technical committees will beneeded to participate in each project team.  (Don't pick on this example toohard; the whole subject of costs andother business issues aren't represented here.)  We'll need a chairman foreach technical committee and a team lead for each project team.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Now That We Have It, What Do We Do With It?</H3><P>To move the Artemis Project to the next step, we need to get eachTechnical Committee and Project Team functioning.  Communication and planningare vital to the success of any project, but with a team literally spread outall over the globe, that's especially true for us.</P><P>Everybody needs to know what he's supposed to be doing, what everyoneelse is doing, and how to get it all done.

The outline of         the Artemis Data Book is a good starting         point for a WBS; it breaks the whole project down to the level         where technical committees and project teams start.</P><LI><P>Write a WBS dictionary.  This is a short paragraph or two for         each header in the WBS that defines what this work really is.         It defines the products produced by the work done under a given         item.</P><P>For example: Somewhere in the tree will be a WBS entry to develop         propulsion systems for the sundry vehicles.  The Propulsion         Systems Technical Committee would participate in the project         team for each spacecraft which needs rockets; specifically the         Lunar Transfer Vehicle, the Descent Stage, and the Ascent         Vehicle.  So we'd have an entry like . . .</P><blockquote><P>         x.x.x.x Develop Lunar Transfer Vehicle PropulsionSystems</P><P>      Develop a conceptual design for the main propulsion system and         maneuvering thrusters for the Lunar Transfer Vehicle.  Determine         system requirements based on mission inputs from the Mission         Design Project Team.  Survey available off-the-shelf hardware         and compare to system requirements.  Select propulsion systems         for the LTV and publish weight, cost, volumetric, and CADdata.</P></blockquote><LI><P>Write charters for each technical committee and project team.        The charter tells what products each team will produce in         sufficient detail so that everyone else can see who is producing         the products they need.  It lists who the suppiers are for that         team (that is, who is generating information the team needs),         and who their customers are (who needs the products this team is         producing).</P><P>         So list the things you'll need to know to make some progress on         doing the tasks listed in the WBS dictionary, and as the WBS         dictionary develops, see if you can figure out which other teams         are producing what you need.</P><P>         The first thing you'll need is a list of who ison your        team and contact information for everybody.  Don't forget         to parcel up the work among the team, schedule IRC conferences         if need be, think up ways for your team to communicate.  You         might write memos in the form of Coordination Sheets to keep         everybody informed.  We can set up a place for you to store your         information on ASI domain so everybody has convenient access to         it.</P><LI><P>Develop a schedule for producing these projects.  Publish the         schedule, but don't worship it as if it were handed to use by         Divine Providence.  The reason for the schedule is to give people         an idea of when they can expect the inputs they'll need so they         can plan their work, and to show others what inputs you need so         you can plan your work.</P><P>         If your team falls behind schedule for any reason, just tell         everyone else about it.  We're a volunteer workforce, so we have         an extra need to accommodate individuals' lives while we're         doing this.  If it's something that other folks can work on to         fill in the gap, we'll stay on schedule.  (There's really no         reason why an Ada programmer can't look up stuff in a         manufacturing planning handbook.)  If not, we'll adjust the         schedule as appropriate.  This is supposed to be <I>fun</I>; never         mind any lofty goal.</P><P>         To kick-start the scheduling process, here are the top-level         milestones in the briefing charts I've been using:</P></OL><PRE>             Feasibility Study Complete           30 Jun 1995             Conceptual Design Complete           31 Dec 1996             Preliminary Design Complete          31 Dec 1998             Spacecraft Development Complete      31 Dec 2002          <B>   First Launch                          1 Jan 2003</B>             LTV Space Trials Complete            31 Mar 2003             Second Launch                         1 Apr 2003             Integration and Checkout Complete    31 May 2003             Translunar Injection                  1 Jun 2003</PRE><P> So for the first shot at a task plan, see if it's reasonable to         lay out a detailed task plan that gets a first look at costs and         schedules by the end of June next year, and a pretty solid         design concept done by the end of the year.  It might turn out         then when you start making lists of all the information you need         and when you need it, your schedule won't synch with other teams'         schedules.  That's no big deal; we'll just work out the details.</P><P>         As this goes along, if you find you're falling behind or working         ahead, that list of products will tell you who you need to tell         about it.  If you start to feel undue pressure to get something         done so that the project becomes stressful, that's a clue that         you need to relax your schedule a bit.  Take time to play with         the kids; maybe they'll become inspired to carry on this work for         generations to come!</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><P><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Fri, March 8, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

<BR>
<P><H1>Office of Space Flight</H1>
<P><H2>Technical Committees</H2>
<P><H2>Duties for Chairman</H2>



<P>
In general, the chairman of a technical committee does the things listed
below. Keep in mind that you can--and should--delegate just about 
everything; your primary function is to make decisions and be the
committee's interface with the Artemis Society's Office of Space Flight.
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Define a work plan <BR>
      The work plan defines what the committee will do, and what
      products it create. It's a living document, updated when
      something new comes up. Its purpose is to keep track of what
      needs to be done and who's doing what. Since we'll always
      want to do more than available resources allow, expect there
      to be a backlog. That backlog is very useful because you'll
      have a ready answer when someone joins the group and asks,
      "What can I do now?"<BR>
      The best way to define the work plan is to ask your team for
      inputs. Other committees will add to it by asking questions
      related to your committee's responsibility.<BR>
      The work plan should include a schedule, at least for any
      products that people are working on. That lets other people
      know when something will be available.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Recruiting<BR>
      Recruiting new participants in each technical committee is usually
      a continuous operation. All members of the committee can help.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Training<BR>
      Include some tasks to set up tutorials that would allow a new
      committee member to get up to speed in your discipline.
      Your goal is to create a cadre of experts in the committee's
      technical area.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Staffing Project Teams<BR>
      As the Artemis Project grows, it defines major products that must
      be designed. This is done by the project teams. Each project
      team will need people from several technical committees.<BR>


<UL>
<LI>Keep track of who's working on what. Get periodic feedback on
      progress. Make sure the quiet guy in the corner who's doing all
      the work isn't ignored.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Keep track of who contributed to the creation of a product. If
      the committee creates a marketable product, something that
      generates royalties from commercial business, we want to make
      sure the folks who put the work into it receive the royalties.
      ASI can't pay people directly to do these things, but the Society
      can assist in making contacts with commercial business participants
      in the Artemis Project.<BR>
</LI>
<BR>
<LI>NOTE: If someone doesn't want to receive royalties for work on Artemis
      Society projects, he has the option of donating that back to
      the Society; but nobody should feel pressured to do this.<BR>
</LI>
</UL>
<LI>Draft a charter for your technical committee.<BR>
      The charter defines the committee's scope--reponsibility and
      authority.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Maintain committee administrative information in the committee's
      organizational section of the Artemis Data Book.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Under section 6.7 of the ADB, each committee has its own designated
      area for keeping work plans, lists of committee members, procedures
      and processes, and any other administrative information that
      everyone needs to share.<BR>
</LI>
<LI> If it's a new committee that doesn't have a section of the book,
      contact the Book Boss for the ADB. That's Simon Rowland
      (simon@eagle.ca).<BR>
</LI>
<LI>The Administrator for the Office of Space Flight can help keep the
      committee lists and get stuff into the on-line data book for you.
      That's Candace Dicks (osf-admin@asi.org).<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Maintain the committee's technical products in the appropriate
      sections of the Artemis Data Book.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>While the committee's internal administrative information goes
      under section 6.7 (or 6.8 for project teams), documents which
      plan the space flight should be up front in the book under one
      of these sections:<BR>


1.  Project Overview<BR>
2.  Scenarios for Manned Space Development<BR>
4.  Reference Mission Development<BR>
5.  Mission Options<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Scientific data about the moon go into Appenix M. That's the
      reference section where you can look up information about what the 
      moon is made of and its physical properties.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>A good way to start collecting information applicable to the
      technical committee's work is to do a World Wide Web search for
      related documents elsewhere on the web. Ask one of the committee
      members to organize these references into a web document.
</LI>
</UL>
<LI>Provide an interface with the Electronic Communications Technical
      Committee (ECTC).<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Our office is in cyberspace, and the ECTC is our facilities
      department. They provide the listservers, newsgroups, web sites,
      computer analysis engines, standard formats... the electronic
      version of all those support services any organization needs.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Ask the ECTC to set up a listserver for your committee. When
      they get the issues worked out for newgroups, they'll set up a
      newsgroup to run in parallel with each listserver. The ECTC
      takes care of archiving and web chat groups for you; all you
      need to do is ask. Currently (5/30/96) the only communication
      engines available are the listservers and the web site.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>The ECTC will also help with getting your documents onto the web,
      converted to html, illustrations and photos scanned and put into an
      imagery library, artwork converted to standard formats. You'll
      find them to be a very valuable resource.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Designate a representative from your committee to interface with
      each of the other technical committees. The OSF administrator can
      keep a table of who talks to whom. That keeps the communication
      flowing. If you've decided there's no logical interface between
      your committee and one of the others, let's put a note to that
      effect in the table so we know it's not something we overlooked or
      accidently duplicated.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Encourage committee members to put a little biographical page
      on the web site, so everyone will know who everyone else is.<BR>
</LI>

Basically, it works like this:</P><OL><LI><P><B>Brainstorming stage</B>.  The problem is stated and defined, andproposalsrequested.  Any and all ideas are recorded for consideration at thisstage, no matter how hairbrained.</P><LI><P><B>Categorization</B>:  More-or-less arbitrary categories are setup, simplyfor the purpose of forcing some minimal order on the chaos resulting instage 1.  Each idea is recorded in only one category.</P><LI><P><B>Funneling</B>:  Each category is evaluated by the team as awhole, and thetotally unworkable ideas are tossed.</P><LI><P><B>Elimination</B>: The survivors of stage 3 are arranged into amatrix for comparison.The vertical axis is the list of criteria (cost, useability, utility,etc.), and each concept is given a column.  Each concept is compared tothe existing method (referred to as the 'datum') on a '+', '-', or 'S'basis.</P><LI><P><B>Further Elimination</B>: The top scorers of stage 4 are placed ina matrix of their own, usingthe top scorer from stage 4 as the new datum.  New criteria to addressquestions neglected in the previous stages are added.</P></OL><P>Stages 4 and 5 are looped through until the design team decides that theoptimum concept has been filtered out.</P><P>The main mailing list is very good for this method, as it gives theideas to a large body of people which fairly accurately find the best onesby discussions. Committees produce more accurate results then peopleworking alone, and the mailing list has more people working on problems thenthe largest committees.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Fri, March 15, 1996<br>Content by W.

It basically watches the long-term forcastof the moonbase to avoid the <a href="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a>making short-sighted descisions.</P><P>This technical committee's primary product is the the Artemis ProjectLong-Range Plan. Much of the information currently avaliable is in the "<ahref="/adb/01/02/">Vision</a>" section of the <ahref="/adb/outline.html">Artemis Data Book</a>.</P><P>A good way to approach this issue is to use the same method we're using foreverything else in the program:</P><OL><LI>Develop a strawman plan, identifying a baseline and options;<LI>Get reliable inputs to correct the long-range plan;<LI>Iterate back to Step 1.</OL><P>The number one question is money. How will the lunar community <ahref="/adb/03/04/long-term-funding.html">support itself in the longrun?</a></P><P>The committee's work can be planned around that one question.  We need along-range economic model.  There are many associated questions:</P><OL><LI><P>How much will it cost to support the lunar community?</P><P>See the <a href="/adb/02/07/lunacity-hotel.html">study on lunartourism</a> for some notes about the economics of running a touristbusiness on the moon.</P><LI><P>What <a href="/adb/03/04/long-term-resources.html">resources</a>does the community need vs. size of population?</P><LI><P>What businesses would be on the moon other than tourism?</P><P>We will leave <a href="/adb/02/09/he3-intro.html">helium-3</A> out ofthe picture, or at least keep it separate from the rest of the analysis.Compared to the economic impact of helium-3, everything else shrinks toinsignificance.  Since we don't know if He3 will even work, that's too muchof a long shot to bet on.</p><P>A lunar observatory complex supporting radio and visual spectrumastronomical work is one possiblity.  Even if a researcher cost $100,000for a stay on the moon, it would be worth it compared to the total cost of,for example, observing time on the Hubble Space Telescope.</P><P>Permanent residents -- people who want to live on the moon for the sakeof living on the moon -- are another example.  Think of the moon likeHawaii.  Besides people employed in the tourism or agriculturalindustries, who lives there?</P><LI><P>What are the technological issues associated with each revenuesource, and how much will it cost to solve them?</P><P>Capital is the big issue here.  Break-even won't do it; lunar industryhas to compete with Earth business for capital.  That means Return OnInvestment has to be weighed against risk.</P><LI><P>How much of the lunar economy will be internal, and how muchrequires trade with Earth?  In the really long range, what's the impact of<a href="/adb/01/02/asteroid-mission-notes.html">asteroid mining</a>?Mars?  Space colonies?</P><P>There is a lot of discussion regarding the technology involved in providinglife support, but there's more to the lunar economy than chemical elementsand potatoes.  A tour through the Yellow Pages index will give you ashopping list of goods and services people want.  We have to provide allthose things, whatever they are; or in a few cases, the lunarequivalent.</P><P>We'll probably find that a big lava tube or two, with moon farms and ametals industry, brings the lunar economy to more than 90% self-sufficient.That means that only 10% of the "Gross Lunar Product" would need to beinvested in goods from Earth.</P><LI><P>What's the lunar community's balance of payments over time?</P><P>The goal, of course, is to have a positive cash flow.  In estimatingbalance of payments, don't forget that many (perhaps most, perhaps all)lunar industry will be owned by stockholders on Earth.  So profit earned onthe moon will not necessarily stay on the moon.</P></OL><P>The Artemis Project Long-Range Plan might also include sections ontechnology and political issues.  Those are less important because if thefinancials work, the rest will take care of themselves.  Avoidingdiscussions of political structures on the moon would probably be a goodidea.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><P><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Fri, March 8, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

The breakdown is then posted on the ASI web, so others can useit.</P><P><lI>Develop costs, revenues, resource requirements, and transferequations for each part of the economic process. Use Fortran 77 conventionsfor writing the <a href="word-equations.html">transfer equations</a>;that's the easiest thing to read and to translate into other languages.</P><P><LI>Review the breakdowns others have created to see what names they areusing for the variables in their transfer equations.</P><blockquote><P>          Note: Be careful here, and be clever in naming your variables. For          instance, somebody might be using 'oxygen-quantity' to mean the          amount of oxygen used in a detailed industrial process. That's a bad          move, because someone else might use 'oxygen-quantity' to mean the          amount of oxygen needed for people to breathe per day. It's better to          use a variable name like 'oxygen-ls-rate-lb-pppd'.</P><P><blockquote>Nomenclature: "ls" is life support. "lb-pppd" is short-handfor "pounds per person per day". We use "rate" because this is a flow ratethrough the system, not a static quantity (use "quan").</P></blockqoute><P>       For dollars, use "d" rather than "$" since the dollar sign will make          most compilers choke. Calculate all money transactions in          constant-year 1994 U.S. dollars.</P><P>       We'll agree on other standard nomenclature and variable-naming          conventions as we build up the model. Keep an eye on the 'Standard          Variable Names Dictionary', which the APTC chairmen will maintain on          the ASI web.</P><P>       Use a standard time interval of one day where you can. We could write          a simulation control executive which can handle slower or faster          iteration intervals, but it will increase the complexity of the task.          If the model depends upon an event, such as arrival of a commercial          space liner, make sure that's obvious.</P></blockquote><P><LI>Send a list of the variable names you're using, with definitions, to the  committee chairmen so they can add it to the Standard Variable Names  Dictionary posted on the ASI web.</P><P><LI>Put the transfer equations together to form an economic model for this  segment of the lunar economy.</P><P><blockquote>If it's really complex, consider developing a simplified model in          parallel with the detailed one to speed up processing time. For          example, to figure out the economic viability of the tourist          transportation industry, we'll need a detailed model of the ship's          operation.

Bennett</I></P><P><HR><P><P>An economic model of a lunar community would include a list of all thethings that people need to live and thrive on the moon.  We'd express it asa series of equations, but it starts with brainstorming a list of whatpeople want.  For instance, the average person in the lunar community mightconsume, per year:</P><pre>       150 pounds of vegetables      1,000 hours of television watching        60 pounds of meat              200 hours of telephone conversations        30 pounds of fish                2 pairs of shoes         3 pairs of trousers            10 sets of underwear         4 shirts                       25 pints of beer       100 pounds of paper           5,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity     1,000 pounds of water           4,000 pounds of oxygen        30 whatevers of cosmetics       40 ounces of deodorant         2 toothbrushes                 24 ounces of toothpaste</Pre><P>(Don't believe those numbers.  I'm just making up this example off thetop of my head.)</P><P>We keep adding to that list until we've identified everything theaverage person would like to have available.  We might skimp here and therecompared to what we'd have on Earth.</P><P>The next step is to figure out how much industry is needed to supplyall those things: so many acres of cotton, of corn, of wheat, ofpineapples; so many head of cattle, pigs, chickens; so many tons of iron,aluminum; so many board-feet of wood and tons of wood pulp, hence so manyacres of forest.</P><P>While adding up what we're consuming, we also add up what we'reproducing.  That average person is cranking out so many tons of humanwaste, waste paper, expired water and carbon dioxide, waste water, fishbones, empty glass bottles, glass jars, and so on.</P><P>When all that is put together, we look at how to get those industriesstarted.  What's the minimum amount of stuff we can import from Earth andstill have the community thrive and grow at a reasonable rate?  At whatrate do we have to import it?  Do we ship hydrogen and carbon as methane(CH<FONT SIZE=1>4</FONT>)?  Or do we ship it in some other form?  How fastdoes trash pile up?How much of the trash is recyclable, and what piles up because althoughit's recyclable we don't use it fast enough to consume it all?</P><P>When we know all those numbers, we can estimate how many man-hours ittakes to produce each thing the people need.  I suspect they'll be busy,but if the lunar community can survive at all without working its people todeath, it will thrive.  We can convert man-hours to people, and with anestimate of the cost of operating that fleet of rockets that Adam London'stechnical committee is working on, we can calculate the cost of importingthe stuff we need from Earth.</P><P>The cost of imports and the number of man-hours needed to producethe goods and services the lunar community wants are the most importantfactors.  We want to keep the cost of imports to a minimum because thelunar community has to produce goods they can sell on Earth for an equalamount of money.</P><P>That's a key point.  I've hundred hundreds of papers about lunarbases, but not one that assumed the lunar community would be mostlyinternally self-sufficient.  Our goal is to design a lunar community whichwill have a positive balance of payments.  That is, they sell more topeople on Earth than they buy from them.</P><P>Tourism will probably be the key industry.  Every time someone fromEarth spends a dollar in the casino on the moon, that dollar becomes a debtthat Earth owes to the moon.  The moon can use that dollar to import thethings they need from Earth.  The tourist industry will probably also paylanding fees for the commercial rockets and an atmosphere fee per personper day; those will be hidden in the price of the ticket.  The economy ofHawaii would probably be an excellent example.</P><P>Ideally, we'll minimize the capital investment required, so that thelunar community operates near break-even for its first several years.</P><P>As the equations get set up, we turn them over to the programmers.This model could be set up as a spreadsheet or as a series of linearequations operating in the time domain.  That's how it becomes a "model".I'm an old veteran of writing simulators, so I tend to think in terms ofsimulator models even when we're pushing money and goods around instead ofpushing airplanes through the air and spacecraft through the cosmos.</P><h3>Lunar Transportation System Economic Model</h3><P>An economic model of the lunar transportation industry is a bit morestraightforward because it only needs to concern itself with the logisticsof getting the passengers to the moon.  I believe Adam's committee has apretty good handle on that one, but we still need to set up the equationsand run out some cashflow projections.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sat, Apr 15, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Mark Barbisan</I></P>
<P><HR><P>


<P>After reading the <a href="economic-model-tasks.html">Task List</a> for
the <a href="aptc.html">APTC</A>, you may have several
questions in your mind about 'Transfer Equations.' To put is simply, the
word equations are ingredients in a recipe.
Put them all together, and you've got your cake!</P>

<P>Basically, we want a 'state matrix' which shows how everything relates
to everything else. For example, in the production and selling of strawberries
you must account for several variables. You must first think of the initial
cost,
needed chemicals, land, how many people needed, etc. So an equation in a model
for strawberries could look something like this:</P>

<pre>           n_humans_reqd = 0.32 * live_plnts +
                           0.25 * n_pkd_strbr +
                           0.26 * n_strb_produced_per_square_meter + etc. +
etc.</pre>

<P>This list could go on and on. However, take a look at the first line:
live_plnts. This could be broken down to:</P>

<pre>           live_plnts = 0.37 * n_km_land +
                        0.25 * n_plnts_bought +
                        0.13 * n_ltrs_pesticide +
                        0.10 * n_plnts_planted + etc. + etc. + etc.</pre>

<P>And some of the above variables could be broken down further as well.
Anything can be a variable. And, when making models for the moon, you got to
be careful to remember non-human organisms when calculating things like
oxygen needed. For example, say if we setup some sort of arboretum on Luna,
not only will "tons_of_oxygen_needed" depend on "n_humans_total", but it will
also have to take into account "n_plnts_total" (Plus anything else needing
oxygen on the moon)</P>


<P>Some other things to keep in mind, when using dollars, use "d" rather
than "$" seeing that the dollar sign will make most compilers choke.
Calculate all money transactions in constant-year 1994 U.S. dollars. Use
a standard time interval of one day when possible. </P>

<P>Once we finish the economic model, and we launch and start our Lunar
Community, we can use the model to see if the community is successful or not.
If the work is done in less than 1/4 of the adult human population's time, we
know that the people up there have free time. However, if it's more than
2/3 the adult human's time, we can conclude that they aren't getting enough
rest and the community will collapse.</P>

<H3>Naming Variables</H3>

<P>When naming variables for the model, it's a good idea to follow the
following system:</P>

<pre>           System - Item - Level of Derivative - Units</pre>

<P>Example: "beef-ls-lbs-pppd" which translates to: "ls" which is life
support, and, as noted in the Task List, "lbs-pppd" is short hand for pounds
per person per day.</P>

<P>Another important note, the chairmen will be maintaining a list in the
APTC web space for variables other people are using. When making variables,
please send them into the chairmen so we can post them. Plus, before making
variables you should check this list to make sure there are not duplicates.
If there are (e.g. "ls-oxygen-lbs-pppd"), you may wish to talk to the other
people using those variables to find out what they are doing. You may be
able to incorporate each other's variables.</P>

<P> One last note, this can be a hard concept to grasp, if you need any
further help, please don't hesitate to <a

We candefine the requirements from that:</P><ol><lI>Industries that earn a profit on Earth so we can import what we must<P><ul type=circle><lI>Profitable industries, such as tourism, exporting lunar material, andsupporting scientific investigations (radio astronomy, etc.) fithere</P></ul><LI>Industries that close the life support loop on the moon as much as we can<P><ul type=circle><LI>Lunar-based manufacturing and agriculture fit here</ul></ol><P>But we won't know for sure what branches of science apply to each ofthose two basic requirements until we've done all the studies.</P><P>So, instead of trying to break things down into their utilitariancategories at the top level, I'd do it at the lowest level.  We create aform for the Lunar Science community to use, a "Proposed Investigation"form, perhaps.  That form describes the investigation to be done; whatfacilities (housing, equipment) and resources (man-hours, indvidualexpertise, power, data, heat rejection, material) are required to do thejob; scientific disciplines affected; applicability to each chunk of thelunar community's habitat systems (including entertainment); potentialcustomers for the results.  There are probably more things to keep in thedata base that I haven't thought of.</P><P>As we build the data base, we have the expanding-the-lunar-base folksworking on a model of what resources will be available, and when.  Mergingthe two tells us what we can do, and when we can do it.  It will be up tothe program managers to decide which ones get done first.  I expect thecriterion they will apply for the decision is that priority goes toinvestigations which increase the lunar community's economic position.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sat, Apr 15, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

<h2 align="center">6.7.4.1. 3-D Modeling Technical Committee</H2>
<h2 align="center">Function, Goals and Tasks for the 3DTC</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Gregory R. Bennett</I></P>
<P><HR><P>

<P>The way the relationship between the <a href="/adb/06/07/04/01/">3-D
Modeling Technical Committee</a> and <A href="/adb/06/08/">Project
Teams</a> was originally concieved is that we'd have product teams to do
conceptual design for each of the major spacecraft.  The 3D committee would
be rendering the ideas the design teams came up with.  3D would provide
feedback to the design teams about what works and what doesn't, as well as
coming up with the pretty pictures and models for movies and such.</P>

<P>The way it's working out, however, is that a few people are giving the
technical details instead of all of those
product teams and lots of folks are doing the renderings.  So far this is
working out pretty well for getting a rather detailed conceptual design
together.</P>

<P>It is anyone's guess how far we can go with this informal
organizational process.  A lot depends on how far the 3D committee
members want to take it.  We might even get down to the detailed bracketry,
as long as the primary informants still get information from experienced
spacecraft
designers to make sure we're not following a blind alley.  To do serious
structural design, we'll need some hands-on experts on spacecraft
structures, thermal analysis, materials and processes, electrical systems,
manufacturing, and lots of other topics.  We might
luck out and find folks to volunteer to do these things; or we might have
to wait until we've got the money to pay for it.</P>

<P>So who knows?  Maybe we can hand over a 90% complete design to a
spaceship factory, and just have them do the final check, fix the fiddly
details, and start cutting metal.  That would be great.  The farther
we can take this the way we're doing it, the more we lower our up-front
cost for the space mission and the faster we get there.</P>

<P>Sooner or later we'll need to pay some folks to take care of final
design.  Think of all the wires running around inside the spaceships --
besides needing to know the type and size of wire needed, we need experts
on what materials are acceptable to use in the environment (outgassing from
insulation is an issue inside; tolerance to temperature, ultraviolet, and
meteroids are issues outside).  We'll probably run out of the man-hours we
could expect from volunteers to do this kind of work, especially since it's
difficult to turn that kind of analysis into a commercial
product, to pay the volunteers with.  People have to eat, including
engineers.</P>

<P>Another thing that could push the design effort into paid work is the
need to use a common modeling system.  Unigraphics is the best there is,
but not many of us home hobbyists can afford the workstations, much less a
license for the UG software.</P>

<P>So, once we have nice models of the conceptual design for the
reference mission, it might be better use of the 3D committee's time to go
on to designing concepts for the lunar base at various stages of its
growth, the <a href="/adb/02/07/02/01/">Luna City Hotel</a>, the Overmyer
Aerodrome, Mars missions launched
from the moon, the <a href="/adb/04/02/05/">robotic precursor missions</a>,
<a href="/adb/02/08/">power stations on the moon</a>,
<a href="/adb/02/02/">mining equipment</a>, <a href="/adb/02/10/">mass
launchers</a>, and even <a href="/adb/02/06/">space colonies</a>.</P>

<P>In essence, the 3D modeling technical committee provides a forum for everyone
working on nifty
renderings to share information and data. One important job is to keep
track of what's <I>not</I> being worked on, for assignments to
volunteers.</P>

They are used to predict or explore capabilities andlimitations.  With simulations, we can train pilots without leaving theground, or test parts or components which haven't even been developed yet.Throughout the <a href="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a>, simulationswill be developed and used to verify designs, analyze mission parameters,provide training for astronauts, educate the public, and generaterevenue.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Mission Statement</H4><P>The objective of the Simulation Technical Team of the <ahref="/asi_index.html">Artemis Society International</a> is to support allphases of the Artemis Project with accurate, timely, and cost-effectivesimulations.  The types of simulations fall into four basic categories:<UL type=square><LI><P><B>Unit engineering simulations</B> -- accurate simulations of asingle part of an Artemis vehicle.  These simulations are most usefulduring the design process, and allow the development team to analyzenumerous options before committing to a final design.</P><LI><P><B>Multi-unit engineering simulations</B> --  simulations whichanalyze the interaction of two or more systems.  These simulations are alsoused during the design process, to find possible problems due tointeraction of systems which, taken separately, function adequately.  Anexample would be discovering that a fuel pump could not provide sufficientfuel to the engine to permit operation at maximum thrust.</P><LI><P><B>Training Simulators </B>-- used to familiarize personnel with theoperation of complex equipment. Training systems are highly dependent uponthe final design of the equipment.  For the Artemis Project, the trainingsimulators will utilize inputs from engineering simulations to mini-mizesystem development costs.</P><LI><P><B>Entertainment simulations</B> -- simulations which provideentertainment value, whether passive or interactive.  These include virtualreality, ridefilms, video games, and flight simulators.</UL><P>The Artemis Project provides a unique opportunity for simulationdevelopment. By applying the best techniques of software engineering now,at the beginning, we will be able to minimize development costs in thefuture without sacrificing accuracy.</P><P>By maintaining a consistent approach over the development of allsimulations during the project, we will reduce the amount of redevelopmentwhich commonly occurs on similar projects.  We will find it easy to reuse"parts" of previously written programs for the training devices which wedevelop.</P><P>Inputs to simulations from technical groups will provide the tools tomodel the complex systems of the Artemis Project, from mission trajectoriesto <a href="/adb/04/02/01/ltv-notes.html">LTV design parameters</a>. Inreturn, the Simulation Technical Committee will provide the analyses whichenable the engineers to improve their designs. We will teach the astronautsto fly, to ensure that they are safe and confident. Our simulations willhelp create the entertainment necessary to fund the <ahref="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a>, through virtual reality "tours",ridefilms, video games and flight simulators, all based on the realspacecraft under development.  Through all this, we will help to inspirethe public, and open their eyes to the endless possibilities.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Wed, March 20, 1996<br>Content by Michael H.

Interactions between the spacecraft and the plasma includearcing, current collection, and system and material charging.</P><P>Arcing removes surface dielectic or insulating material, exposingunderlying conductors to the plasma and providing sites for currentcollection with power loss and electromagnetic noise. Arcs may also causelogic upsets which result in operational anomalies. Arcing also removesportions of atomic oxygen protective layers, exposing surfaces toerrosion. When a defect occurs, atomic oxygen undercuts the remainingsurface protection resulting in damaged areas larger than that of thedefect alone.</P><P>Plasmas and/or Gaseous Products resulting from spacecraft operationsinterfere with scientific instruments by altering optical properties,producing optical interference or EMI (Electromagnetic Interference),altering spacecraft protentials, all of which compromise data.</P><P>Ion sputtering removes surface atomic or molecular species by ionbombardment, The species removed by sputtering may be redeposited atother sites producing unwanted contamination, or altering surfaceelectrical/optical properties.</P><P>The Neutral Environment present at Low Earth Orbit also presents someeffects such as atomic oxygen degredation that may harmfully impact aspacecraft. Atomic Oxygen Degredation is a chemical interaction betweenatomic oxygen and certain materials that can cause changes in thematerial's surface properties and/or physical degredation of the material.</P><P>Surface contamination created by outgassing materials or deposition ofspacecraft effluents can coat sensitive surfaces such as optical sensors.</P><P>The Radiation Environment may cause Single Event Upset and degrade solararray surfaces and cells, electronic components and sensors anddielectric materials. It can also deposit charge inside dielectricmaterials and on surfaces internal to the spacecraft. Such chargedeposition can result in dielectic breakdown and EMI electrical upsets.</P><P>The Micrometeoroid or man-made Orbital Debris Environments can impactand physically damage a spacecraft. These impacts can also stimulate arcdischarges in regions of electrical stress.</P><P>These interactions are important to spacecraft designers. They are acause of spacecraft system and subsystem damage and/or degredation,electrical power loss, material property degredation, payloadinterference, and electrostatically enhanced contamination.</P><P>Mitigation strategies in spacecraft design include selection of propermaterials, design of payload and power system geometries to minimizeexposure to high voltage surface areas, choice of operating voltages toremain below arc thresholds, design of spacecraft grounding to keepsensitive spacecraft structures near the plasma electrical potential, andusing plasma contractors to maintain spacecraft potential.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Wed, June 26, 1996<br>Content by Marvin Ostrega <ahref="mailto:OSTRMA91@SNYONEVA.CC.ONEONTA.EDU">&lt;OSTRMA91@SNYONEVA.CC.ONEONTA.EDU&gt;</a>, maintained by <AHREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar ResourcesCompany</a>.</font></body></html>

Bennett</I></P><P><HR><P><P>Structures and mechanisms are two of the labor-intensive parts of design.</P><P>Mechanisms design is the art of mechanical engineering, where youdesign the moving parts -- door hinges, latches, axles, landing gear,mechanical attachments, bracketry, and all those fiddly bits that make aspaceship go.</P><P>The structures are the backbone of the spacecraft.  Besides theobvious design of structural elements designed to carry mechanical loadsfrom one place to another, the structures guys analyze the structuralrequirements of the integrated spacecraft.  For example, that design I didshowing 6 hydrogen tanks is not the lowest mass you could use if your onlygoal is to contain a pressurized liquid; but there's a strong argument forhaving those skinny tanks around the outside because of their contributionto the structural integrity of the whole vehicle.</P><P>We group them together because the structures and mechanisms have towork together.  Every moving part has to have something to react its forcesagainst, and those forces have to be carried by the structure.  Mechanismsare to structures as software is to computer hardware.</P><P>Whenever it's feasible, you want to survey the world of existingstructures and mechanisms, and use things that are available off the shelf.Around NASA the most popular places to look for odd mechanisms are boatshops and hardware stores.  You'd be surprised how many sailboat parts windup in a spaceship!</P><P>Now to lay out a general task plan for the Structures and MechanismsTechnical Committee:</P><ol><P><LI>Survey the spacecraft to make a list of all the structures andmechanisms that have to be designed.</P><P>It makes sense to start at one end and work the way to the other.  Fromthe moon up, we have ...</P><BLOCKQUOTE>the landing gear pads,<br>the main gear struts,<br>the attachment between the pads and the struts,<br>the attachment to supporting struts,<br>the supporting struts,<br>attachment of supporting struts to descent stage primary structure,<br>descent stage primary structure,<br>and so on...</BLOCKQUOTE><P><lI>Once you've got started on a list, organize it into a Job DrawingList.  (Sometimes called a Generation Breakdown List, though I'mnot sure why.)</P><P>This is just an indented list showing which parts go into whichassemblies, which in turn make up larger assemblies, and so on until we'vegot to the top configuration drawing for the whole, integrated spacecraft.</P><P>It looks something like:</P><pre>       Drawing Number  Item       1C10000000      Reference Mission Spacecraft       1C11000000         Lunar Transfer Vehicle       1C11100000            LTV Command Module       1C11200000            LTV Service Module       1C12000000        Airlock       1C13000000        Exploration Base Habitat       1C14000000        Descent Propulsion Stage       1C15000000        Ascent Stage</pre><P>It's a whole lot like figuring out what parts you need to puttogether to make a rendering of the spacecraft, except that you just keepgoing to identify even the parts you can't see.</P><P>I used "1C" drawing numbers to identify conceptual design.  Wecould use 1T for test configurations, and 1F for flight.  I swiped thatsystem from McDonnell Douglas.  Every aerospace company does it a littledifferently; but what the heck, MDC has managed to get a few airplanes andspaceships off the ground so we know the system works.</P><lI>Once it's organized into that sort of hierarchy, get folks todesign stuff.  The list will keep growing as people get to thinkingabout the design and discover the fiddly bits they overlooked onthe first pass.</P><P>At first designing the fiddly bits might seem easy.  In many cases,it is; but it still has to get done so that we know what we'll have toeither buy or make.  As the designs come together, we can start adding upthe weight of this thing.  Most of the dry weight of the spacecraft will bestructures and mechanisms.  Interestingly, you'll find that fasteners canweigh as much as the structures they fasten.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Mon, Sept 9, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

<h2 align=center>Artemis Data Book</h2>
<h2 align=center>6.7.4.11 Spacecraft Propulsion Technical Committee</h2>
<h2 align=center>Propulsion Tech Committee Membership</h2>
<P><HR><P>

<P>The Spacecraft Propulsion Technical Committee (SPTC) is responsible for
various aspects of rocket science for the Artemis Project. This includes
detailing the <a href="/adb/04/">Reference Mission</a>'s Propulsion needs,
assisting other <a href="/adb/06/07/">Tech Committees</a> and <a
href="/adb/06/08/">Project Teams</a>with propulsion, and working with other
discussion groups. However, working on propulsion aspects of the Reference
Misison is the main focus of the Prop TC.</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Members</B> - These are people who are actively involved in the
various tasks of the SPTC. They are doing the actual work of the
Propulsion TC itself.
<p>
<LI><B>Reps</B> - Because the activities of the Propulsion Technical
Committee impact many other areas of the <a href="/asi_index.html">Artemis
Society</a>, it is important that strong lines of communication exist
between all Technical Committees. To provide those lines of communication,
we hope to have at least one person from every other Technical Committee
belong to the Propulsion TC as a Rep of that Technical Committee. Reps are
responsible for keeping their Technical Committee informed of activities in
the Propulsion TC and relay requests from their Technical Committee to the
SPTC. Reps may also be active Members of the SPTC if they are active in
both committees.
<p>
<LI><B>Observers</B> - Not considered official members of the SPTC,
observers are people who want to stay informed of what goes on in the
Propulsion TC, usually by being included in the SPTC mailing list or
related information feeds.
</UL>

<p>If you would like to join the Propulsion TC, fill out and submit the
form at the bottom of this page. To see what activities are currently 
going on in the SPTC, look at the <a 
href="propulsion-tc-tasks.html">Propulsion TC Task List</a>. To volunteer 
for one of those tasks, fill out and submit the form on the <a
href="propulsion-tc-tasks.html">Task List</a> page. The current membership
of the SPTC is as follows:</P>

They create tutorials and train new members of thecommittee on how to do analysis in their discipline.  They establish standardsand guidelines for design, development, test, and evaluation of all systems intheir area.</P><P>The products of a technical committee are a data base of knowledge inthat particular field, documented standards, and a team of confidentindividuals who are qualified to participate in the Product Teams.  This is anon-going effort, and will be for as long the Artemis Project continues.</P><P>For example, the Simulation Technical committee might select Ada as thecomputer language to be used for all simulations.  They assure that everyoneworking on the simulations has a working knowledge of Ada or access toadequate training.  They establish an overall architecture for the simulationsand define guidelines for what level of simulations models are required foreach application.  They decide on standards such as: all our simulations willbe digitial; for the spacecraft we will develop 3 levels of system models;real-time simulation is applicable to these things and non-real-timesimulation is applicable to those things.  The Sim Tech Comm also might haveinfluence of the standards of quality for related commercial products -- ifthey say all our computer games will have an accurate starfield in thebackground and demonstrate this is a cost-effective approach, then by gumwe'll have an accurate starfield.</P><P>Note that one of the great benefits of the Artemis Project is education.Everyone participating in the project has a chance to learn something new andexciting, and to apply those skills to a very important program.  These skillsare applicable well beyond the development of the lunar base, so both theindividuals and everybody else on the planet will benefit from the increasedskill base.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Project Teams</H3><P>Project Teams (or Product Teams) produce the products specificallyrelated to the Artemis Project's primary goal of establishing a permanent,self-supporting manned lunar base.  They have a more hiearchical structure thanthe Technical Committees because they have to produce an integratedspacecraft.</P><P>The products of the project teams are designs for the spacecraft andtheir missions, and eventually the actual hardware.  Initially, our goal is todevelop conceptual designs with sufficient detail to identify and solve allthe technical problems, identify costs, determine who suppliers for off-the-shelf equipment are, develop a preliminary manufacturing plan, develop apreliminary logistics plan (for getting the spaceship parts to the launchsite), develop mission plans for each flight, and develop ground support planswith estimates of the required mission support facilities on Earth.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Putting the Technical Committees and Project TeamsTogether</H3><P>You can see these two organizational functions matrix into each other.The Technical Committees provide the expert staff for the Project Teams, andthe Project Teams provide feedback to the Technical Committees.  This assures aconsistent, compatible design across all the spaceraft we build, and assuresthat lessons learned from one spacecraft are incorporated into the design ofthe other spacecraft.</P><P>A poignant example of what we avoid with this approach is the lithiumhydroxide cannisters in the Apollo command module and lunar module.  (I'massuming you've seen the Apollo 13 movie, or read Andrew Chaikin's book.)Individually the engineers at North American and Grumman did an outstandingjob on those spacecraft, but together they would have been even better.</P><P>The organizational matrix looks like the chart below.  For simplicity inthis memo, we've lumped everything except the reference mission into "OtherSpacecraft" and then happily ignored it.  However, we expect to take a lookat a lot of other spacecraft before we're all done; one that comes to mind isthe concept of landing a series of very lightweight spacecraft with just acamera, a nav beacon, and a transmitter.  These advance explorers might weighno more than 20 pounds each when they reach the surface, but they'll provide awealth of information about candidate landing sites, teach us a lot aboutgetting a spacecraft to the moon, and be lots of fun in the process.</P><PRE>  Technical                    Space Flight Project Teams  Committees                                Spacecraft Design Team                                         |                           |-----------------------------|                         Other                   Reference Mission                       Spacecraft                   Design Team                                                         |                                ---------------------------------                               |      |      |       |           |                           Mission   LTV    Hab    Descent    Ascent                           Design                  Stage      Vehicle  GN&C                         X       X             X           X  Electrical Power             X       X     X       X           X  Life Support                 X       X     X                   X  Thermal                      X       X     X       X           X  Pressure Vessels             X       X     X  Structures & Mechanisms      X       X     X       X           X  EVA Systems                  X       X     X                   X  Propulsion                   X       X             X           X  Mission Equipment            X       X     X                   X  Software                     X       X     X       X           X  Simulation                   X       X     X       X           X  Test & Verification                  X     X       X           X  Manufacturing                        X     X       X           X  Logistics                            X     X       X           X</PRE><P>An 'X' indicates where members of the technical committees will beneeded to participate in each project team.  (Don't pick on this example toohard; the whole subject of costs andother business issues aren't represented here.)  We'll need a chairman foreach technical committee and a team lead for each project team.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Now That We Have It, What Do We Do With It?</H3><P>To move the Artemis Project to the next step, we need to get eachTechnical Committee and Project Team functioning.  Communication and planningare vital to the success of any project, but with a team literally spread outall over the globe, that's especially true for us.</P><P>Everybody needs to know what he's supposed to be doing, what everyoneelse is doing, and how to get it all done.  Here's how we develop and sharethat information:</P><OL><LI><P>Write a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the part of the project         encompassing the scope of these committees.  The outline of         the Artemis Data Book is a good starting         point for a WBS; it breaks the whole project down to the level         where technical committees and project teams start.</P><LI><P>Write a WBS dictionary.  This is a short paragraph or two for         each header in the WBS that defines what this work really is.         It defines the products produced by the work done under a given         item.</P><P>For example: Somewhere in the tree will be a WBS entry to develop         propulsion systems for the sundry vehicles.  The Propulsion         Systems Technical Committee would participate in the project         team for each spacecraft which needs rockets; specifically the         Lunar Transfer Vehicle, the Descent Stage, and the Ascent         Vehicle.  So we'd have an entry like . . .</P><blockquote><P>         x.x.x.x Develop Lunar Transfer Vehicle PropulsionSystems</P><P>      Develop a conceptual design for the main propulsion system and         maneuvering thrusters for the Lunar Transfer Vehicle.  Determine         system requirements based on mission inputs from the Mission         Design Project Team.  Survey available off-the-shelf hardware         and compare to system requirements.  Select propulsion systems         for the LTV and publish weight, cost, volumetric, and CADdata.</P></blockquote><LI><P>Write charters for each technical committee and project team.        The charter tells what products each team will produce in         sufficient detail so that everyone else can see who is producing         the products they need.  It lists who the suppiers are for that         team (that is, who is generating information the team needs),         and who their customers are (who needs the products this team is         producing).</P><P>         So list the things you'll need to know to make some progress on         doing the tasks listed in the WBS dictionary, and as the WBS         dictionary develops, see if you can figure out which other teams         are producing what you need.</P><P>         The first thing you'll need is a list of who ison your        team and contact information for everybody.  Don't forget         to parcel up the work among the team, schedule IRC conferences         if need be, think up ways for your team to communicate.  You         might write memos in the form of Coordination Sheets to keep         everybody informed.  We can set up a place for you to store your         information on ASI domain so everybody has convenient access to         it.</P><LI><P>Develop a schedule for producing these projects.  Publish the         schedule, but don't worship it as if it were handed to use by         Divine Providence.  The reason for the schedule is to give people         an idea of when they can expect the inputs they'll need so they         can plan their work, and to show others what inputs you need so         you can plan your work.</P><P>         If your team falls behind schedule for any reason, just tell         everyone else about it.  We're a volunteer workforce, so we have         an extra need to accommodate individuals' lives while we're         doing this.  If it's something that other folks can work on to         fill in the gap, we'll stay on schedule.  (There's really no         reason why an Ada programmer can't look up stuff in a         manufacturing planning handbook.)  If not, we'll adjust the         schedule as appropriate.  This is supposed to be <I>fun</I>; never         mind any lofty goal.</P><P>         To kick-start the scheduling process, here are the top-level         milestones in the briefing charts I've been using:</P></OL><PRE>             Feasibility Study Complete           30 Jun 1995             Conceptual Design Complete           31 Dec 1996             Preliminary Design Complete          31 Dec 1998             Spacecraft Development Complete      31 Dec 2002          <B>   First Launch                          1 Jan 2003</B>             LTV Space Trials Complete            31 Mar 2003             Second Launch                         1 Apr 2003             Integration and Checkout Complete    31 May 2003             Translunar Injection                  1 Jun 2003</PRE><P> So for the first shot at a task plan, see if it's reasonable to         lay out a detailed task plan that gets a first look at costs and         schedules by the end of June next year, and a pretty solid         design concept done by the end of the year.  It might turn out         then when you start making lists of all the information you need         and when you need it, your schedule won't synch with other teams'         schedules.  That's no big deal; we'll just work out the details.</P><P>         As this goes along, if you find you're falling behind or working         ahead, that list of products will tell you who you need to tell         about it.  If you start to feel undue pressure to get something         done so that the project becomes stressful, that's a clue that         you need to relax your schedule a bit.  Take time to play with         the kids; maybe they'll become inspired to carry on this work for         generations to come!</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><P><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Fri, March 8, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

Basically, it works like this:</P><OL><LI><P><B>Brainstorming stage</B>.  The problem is stated and defined, andproposalsrequested.  Any and all ideas are recorded for consideration at thisstage, no matter how hairbrained.</P><LI><P><B>Categorization</B>:  More-or-less arbitrary categories are setup, simplyfor the purpose of forcing some minimal order on the chaos resulting instage 1.  Each idea is recorded in only one category.</P><LI><P><B>Funneling</B>:  Each category is evaluated by the team as awhole, and thetotally unworkable ideas are tossed.</P><LI><P><B>Elimination</B>: The survivors of stage 3 are arranged into amatrix for comparison.The vertical axis is the list of criteria (cost, useability, utility,etc.), and each concept is given a column.  Each concept is compared tothe existing method (referred to as the 'datum') on a '+', '-', or 'S'basis.</P><LI><P><B>Further Elimination</B>: The top scorers of stage 4 are placed ina matrix of their own, usingthe top scorer from stage 4 as the new datum.  New criteria to addressquestions neglected in the previous stages are added.</P></OL><P>Stages 4 and 5 are looped through until the design team decides that theoptimum concept has been filtered out.</P><P>The main mailing list is very good for this method, as it gives theideas to a large body of people which fairly accurately find the best onesby discussions. Committees produce more accurate results then peopleworking alone, and the mailing list has more people working on problems thenthe largest committees.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Fri, March 15, 1996<br>Content by W.

The first shot at a horizontal landing configuration wasrejected about four years ago because the rocket motors were at thecorners; that gave us four failure-critical engines where if any one ofthem cut out we lost the spacecraft and crew.</P><P><CENTER><img src="/images/asi199600105.gif" width=641 height=410alt="Horizontal Landing Option Diagram"></CENTER></P><P>This image shows a horizontal option that might work.  Pinktanks are hydrogen; blue ones are oxygen.  The tanks are really close toscale in this depiction, whereas the tanks in the picture you sent werepurely notional.  It eliminates the whole question of how we do thatleveling mechanism.  Does that inspire any design thoughts?  We'd have toget creative with launch packaging and assembly in earth orbit, but itmight be an improvement.</P><P>Originally, the idea of saving weight by using one of the descentengines for ascent drove the design to that leveling contraption.  When welearned we could use cryogenic fuel for landing, but still wantedhypergolics for ascent, that obviated the option to reuse one of thelanding engines.  So we're back to the drawing board.</P><P>Don't be disappointed if we keep the vertical landing with its extramechanisms around for quite a while, though.  That contraption has quite abit of market appeal, as well as being a viable option.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Tue, Sept 24, 1996<br>Maintained by <AHREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar ResourcesCompany</a>.</font></body></html>

The following tablepresents the mass of H2 that needs to be lifted from earth for each unitmass of the vehicle that makes the trip to and from moon:</P><table cellpadding=2><tr><td> Full Aerobraking </td><td> 2/3 Aerobraking </td><td> RocketBraking </td></tr><tr><td>EOI deltaV: </td><td> 230 m/s </td><td> 1000 m/s </td><td> 3225 m/s</td></tr><tr><td>refuel in LEO only </td><td> 1.02 </td><td> 1.44 </td><td> 6.67</td></tr><tr><td>refuel in LEO & LLO (keep H2)*</td><td> 0.70 </td><td> 0.89</td><td> 2.00 </td></tr><tr><td>refuel in  LEO & LLO (keep H2)+</td><td>  0.67 </td><td> 0.84</td><td> 1.74 </td></tr></table><P><FONT SIZE=2>* keep H2 for TEI and EOI with you for lunar landing andascent<br>+ leave H2 for TEI and EOI in LLO while you do lunar landing and ascent  (pick it up when you drop off landing LOX in LLO on way out)</FONT></P><P>I didn't use another vehicle to provide the dropping off of fuel invarious places, since I think we want to keep this overall system assimple as possible, and I really like the idea of being able to maintaineverything on earth.</P><P>In the best case (lower left), using a single stage for whole trip, thefuel mass ratio on earth would have to be 93.92%, leaving about 6% forstructure, payload, engines, TPS, etc. with T/W of engines at 50, and aninitial acceleration of 1.2g, the engines need to be 2.4% of GLOW,leaving 3.6% for everything else. This may be just feasible, but I doubtit. I think that in order to make this with forseeable technology itwould not the be workhorse we require. The margins are just too small.</P><P>On the other hand, if you stage in LEO, I think any of these options arefeasible, with larger H2 numbers meaning you need a larger SSTO todeliver the whole thing to orbit. If we assume some kind of aerobraking,the difference between refueling in LEO only and refueling in LLO alsois not very much. For a given moon vehicle size and aerobraking case,the mass that the SSTO has to deliver to LEO (referenced to the minimumsize in each aerobraking case) goes as follows:</P><table cellpadding=2><tr><td> Full Aerobraking </td><td> 2/3 Aerobraking </td><td> RocketBraking </td></tr><tr><td>EOI deltaV: </td><td> 230 m/s </td><td> 1000 m/s </td><td> 3225 m/s</td></tr><tr><td> refuel in LEO only </td><td> 1.21 </td><td> 1.33 </td><td> 2.80</td></tr><tr><td> refuel in LEO & LLO (keep H2)* </td><td> 1.02 </td><td> 1.03</td><td> 1.09 </td></tr><tr><td> refuel in LEO & LLO (keep H2)+ </td><td> 1.00 </td><td> 1.00</td><td> 1.00 </td></tr></table><P>So the SSTO required to not have a LLO refueling post would only need tobe 21% bigger if full aerobraking was used, and 33% bigger if 2/3aerobraking was used.</P><P>It may make sense to design the vehicle for this option, and then oncewe are far along, and it makes sense to have a LLO refueling station,the passenger capability can be increased.</P><P>Therefore, I propose we investigate a staged in LEO system thatinitially only refuels in LEO, but is designed with the eventual goal ofrefueling in LLO orbit as well, which would then increase passengercapability significantly.</P><P>I'd like to pick an option for us to explore, and stick with it for awhile, so that we can actually crunch some numbers and get a better idea ofwhat we are looking at.</P><P>So if I don't hear any resounding "nay" votes, lets start with a SSTOdelivering a moonship that only refuels its LOX in LEO. Throughout wewill attempt to build in an expandability to add additional passengersper flight once a LLO refueling station is in existence.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sat, Apr 15, 1996<br>Maintained by <AHREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar ResourcesCompany</a>.</font></body></html>

<P>A 150-passenger airliner has 3 flight attendants, a ratio of 1:50. So
it's not unreasonable to assume 4 flight attendants for 50 people. That
lets the attendants work in shifts (it's a long flight) at a ratio of 
1:25, plus the two pilots. We have to assume our passengers will have a 
bit of horse sense and enough training to survive the trip.</P>

<P>So, with 56 people and the above requirements, the total mass is:</P>

<P>To determine the question of aerodynamic efficiency of the gumdrop
shape on ascent, we'll need to propogate the entire trajectory using a
digital simulation that includes atmospheric drag. Total delta-V won't
tell us much about aero drag because that's the speed we're going at the
end of the flight.</P>

<P>Since drag will slow us down, we also would want to include the change
in engine thrust.</P>

<P>The trick is to guesstimate a drag coefficient for a 41-degree cone and
push that gumpdrop through the soup (of the atmosphere). I'd assume a 
trajectory with mostly a vertical component until you're up around 
300,000 feet. Air density at that altitude is only about 4x10<FONT 
SIZE=1><SUP>-9</SUP></FONT> slugs/ft<FONT SIZE=1><SUP>3</SUP></FONT>, so 
aerodynamic drag up there is almost negligible. Then pitch over and 
start the downrange acceleration.</P>

<P>The <a href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/shuttle.html">Shuttle</a>
actually lofts its trajectory, peaking higher than its final orbit, to 
avoid air drag. I'll be quick to point out that ugly as it is, the 
gumdrop is a more aerodynamically efficient shape than all that
claptrap hanging on the Shuttle stack. We don't have struts, wings, and
tail hanging in the breeze. The vehicle doesn't have abrupt changes in
cross-sectional area or stagnation points like the pilots' windows. And it
doesn't have that venturi between four different main bodies looking like
an enormous flat plate.</P>

<P>If you start streamlining the body you'll find skin friction drag
along a long cylinder will exceed the flat plate drag. My guess is that
it's not worth it to worry too much about streamlining on an otherwise
aerodynamically clean vehicle that will spend only three minutes in the
atmosphere during ascent, and those are at its lowest velocity. 
Essentially what we've done is to take a typical rocket shape and leave
off the big cylinder at the back end.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Gregory R. Bennett</I></P>
<P><HR><P>


<P>Here's a variation on defining the task ahead and identifying options
for the program architecture. Breaking down the major functions of the
transportation system to identify the solution space seems to be the best
apporach.</P>

<P>1. Introduction</P>

<P>This study defines a plausible program architecture for regularly
scheduled commercial passenger flights between Earth and the moon. The
baseline mission is daily flights leaving a single spaceport on Earth, with
a single spaceport on the moon supporting traffic at the other end.</P>

<P>2. Assumptions and Guidelines</P>

<ul>
<P><li>2.1. All scenarios include use of lunar oxygen as the oxidizer in
chemical rockets between Earth and the moon.</P>

<P><li>2.2. Lunar hydrogen will not be used for fuel for any mission phase.</P>

<P><li>2.3. Primary mission is to provide round-trip passenger traffic
between Earth and the moon.</P>

<P><li>2.4. Returning passenger load is equal to arriving passenger load.</P>

<P><li>2.5. Vehicle design for passenger comfort similar to 
intercontinental first-class airplane flight with additional accommodation
for privacy and sleep periods.</P>

<P><li>2.6. Maximum acceleration for passengers is 3 g. Cargo flights are
limited only by structural design and vehicle performance.</P>
</ul>

<P>3. Mission Architecture Options</P>
<ul>
<P><li>3.1. Transport passengers and hydrogen fuel to LEO

<P>The solution space encompasses:
<ul>
<P><lI>number of passengers transported to and from the moon</P>

<P>options: 10 to 1000<br>
baseline: 50</P>

<P><LI>number of vehicles
<ul>
<P><li>number of stages for each vehicle<br>
options: 1, 1.5, 2<br>
baseline: 1</P>

<P><li>payload for each vehicle<br>
options: passengers, fuel, passengers + fuel<br>
baseline: passengers + fuel</P>
</ul></ul>

<lI>3.2. Transport passengers, LEO to Moon

<P>The solution space encompasses:</P>

<uL>
<li>Vehicle Type
<ul>
<li>one passenger vehicle, Earth to Moon to Earth
<li>dedicated <a href="/adb/e/abbreviations.html#LEO">LEO</a>-to-<a
href="/adb/e/abbreviations.html#LLO">LS</a> vehicle
<li>dedicated LEO-to-LLO vehicle + dedicated LLO-to-LS vehicle
</ul>

<P><LI>Fueling Options
<ul>
<li>refuel in LEO
<li>refuel in LLO
<li>refuel on the moon
</ul>

<P>Applicability Table for Fueling Options</P>

<table cellpadding=2>
<tr><td> </td><td> LEO </td><td> LLO </td><td> LS </td></tr>
<tr><td> Single vehicle </td><td> Required </td><td> ? </td><td> Yes </td></tr>
<tr><td> Dedicated LEO-to-LS vehicle </td><td> No </td><td> ? </td><td> Yes
</td></tr>
<tr><td> LEO-to-LLO vehicle </td><td> No </td><td> Required </td><td> No
</td></tr>
<tr><td> LLO-to-LS vehicle </td><td> No </td><td> No </td><td> Yes
</td></tr></table>
</ul><P>

<li>3.3. Accommodations on the Moon

<P>The solution space includes:</P>
<ul>
<li>Permanent facilities on the moon (the <a href="/adb/02/07/02/01/">Luna
City Hotel</a>)
<li>Living accommodations in the transportation vehicle
</ul>

<P>Depending on the state of lunar development, it might be economically
feasible to start out with tourists using the transportation vehicle as
living quarters until permanent facilities are built on the moon. This
ties up the capital resource for a longer time per flight, but it would
allow the lunar tourism industry to commence operations sooner.</P>

<P>If lunar tourism can start several years earlier using this scenario,
for many people it will mean the difference between having the opportunity
to go to the moon, and never going there at all. It is likely that the 
ship would fly with all seats filled, even at $500,000 per ticket.</P>


<lI>3.4. Transport passengers, Moon to Low Earth Orbit

<P>The solution space for this mission phase is identical to the trip
from LEO to the moon.</P>

<li>3.5. Braking to Low Earth Orbit

<P>The solution space includes:</P>

<ul>
<li>Rocket braking to LEO
<li>Aerodynamic braking to LEO
<li>Aerodynamic braking to Earth's surface
</UL>

<P>We need another applicability table here. Obviously, if we're
carrying fuel back from the moon for the next flight out, we don't have an
option of heading straight down to the surface.</P>

<lI>3.6. Transport passengers, LEO to Earth's Surface

<P>The solution space includes:</P>

<ul>
<li>Rocket braking to the surface
<li>Aerodynamic braking to the surface
<li>Rockets + aero braking to the surface
</ul>
<P>In all cases, we assume the vehicle returns to its original launch
site on Earth, and is immediately readied for another trip.</P>

</ul>

<h2 align=center>Artemis Data Book</h2>
<h2 align=center>6.8.7 SSTO Concept Design Project Team</h2>
<h2 align=center>SSTO Concept Design PT Membership</h2>
<P><HR><P>

<P>The SSTO Concept Design Project Team is responsible for determining 
and detailing a passenger SSTO conceptual design. This entails designing 
mission architecture, cost, detailed specifications and requirements, and 
other related tasks. Also, it is important to convey the status and 
results of the SSTO Concept Design Project Team to other Technical 
Committees working on related issues, like the Cislunar Space Traffic 
Model, Lunar Tourism, etc.</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Members</B> - These are people who are actively involved in the
various tasks of the SSTO PT. They are doing the actual work of the
Project Team itself.
<p>
<LI><B>Reps</B> - Because the activities of the SSTO Project Team impact
many other areas of the <a href="/asi_index.html">Artemis Project</a>, it
is important that strong lines of communication exist between all groups.
To provide those lines of communication, we hope to have at least one
person from every relevant Technical Committee belong to the SSTO Project
Team as a Representative of that Technical Committee. Reps are responsible
for keeping their Technical Committee informed of activities in the SSTO
Concept Design Project Team and relay requests from their Technical
Committee to the SSTO team. Reps may also be active Members of the SSTO
Projct Team if they are active in both committees.
<p>
<LI><B>Observers</B> - Not considered official members of the SSTO team,
observers are people who want to stay informed of what goes on in the SSTO
Concept Design Project Team, usually by being included in the SPTC mailing
list or related information feeds.
</UL>

<p>If you would like to join the SSTO Concept Design Project Team, fill out
and submit the form at the bottom of this page. To see what activities are
currently going on in the SSTO Project Team, look at the <a
href="ssto-pt-tasks.html">SSTO PT Task List</a>. To volunteer for one of 
those tasks, fill out and submit the form on the <a
href="ssto-pt-tasks.html">Task List</a> page. The current membership of

<P>For this conceptual design, we want to be realistic, but
optimistic, when it comes to estimating the weight of materials. If we
used the <a href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/shuttle.html">Space Shuttle</a> as
our data base, we'd be way off. Just switching from riveted and welded 
components to machined components turned out on an NC mill will reduce 
the structural weight by 30%. Tuning the structure to just what's 
required to carry the loads can knock off 50% of what's left.</P>


<P>With GLOW being about 500 tonnes, the mass breakdown is:</P>

<table>
<tr><td>Fuel</td><td>92%</td><td>460 tonnes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Structure</td><td>6%</td><td>30 tonnes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cargo</td><td>2%</td><td>10 tonnes</td></tr>
</table>

<P>These are reasonable assumptions because the cost of manufacturing using
NC milled components is much lower than parts assembled from little pieces.
As long as you're going to mill the structure, you might as well tune it.
The difference is only software, and the software is already in the systems
we'll use. The example I'm using is a Unigraphics CAD system used for 
design, feeding directly into the milling machines. Unigraphics is very
happy to adjust the shape of a structural component using any complex
equation you can feed it for structural performance. It works
(examples: C-17, <a href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/delta-3.html">Delta III</a>,
F/A-18.)</P>

<H3 align=center><A NAME="D_ticket">A &quot;D&quot; Ticket?</a></H3>
<P>Over the years, the Delta series of launch vehicles from McDonnell
Douglas have been one of the most reliable tickets for both commercial and
government flights. A new generation of Delta vehicles may provide another
<a href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/comparison-table.html">potential vehicle</a> for Artemis.</P>

<P> The Delta III more than doubles the capacity of its predecessor.  Where a
Delta II could deliver 4,100 lbs. to geosynch, the Delta III should be able to
place 8,400 lbs in geosynchronous orbit.  This brings it into the range of
vehicles that could deliver Artemis crews and vehicles to space.</P>

<P> But will the new vehicle be man-rated?  Maybe not for NASA, but McDonnell's
Sr. Vice President for Space, Dr. Bill Olsen, sees no reason that the Delta III
could not be used in manned launches.  According to Dr. Olsen, the Delta family
is the most reliable launcher in the world, with 49 successful launches in a row
and over 250 successful launches overall.  The Delta II has a perfect, 100%
launch record.</P>

<P> Hughes has signed on to use the Delta III in future satellite launches, and
McDonnell sees more and more of their business coming from private launches with decreasing revenues from NASA.</P>

<P> Though the shuttle is still the star of most Artemis plans, the availability
of other launchers provides a great deal of flexibility.  The Delta III is only
one of several potential vehicles which could play a role if the shuttle proves
unsuited or unavailable for all the necessary tasks.</P>

<P><HR><P> 
<H3 align=center><A NAME="Artemis_95">Artemis '95</A></H3>

<P>No, it's not some long-delayed software program.  It's a conference and get
together for everyone involved in or interested in the <a href="/index.html">Artemis Project</a>.</P>

<P> This July, <a href="/asi_index.html">Artemis Society</a> members, along with interested non-members, from
all over the country will gather in Huntsville, Alabama for a conference to
discuss all aspects of the Artemis Project. </P>

<P> Dates for the conference are set as:</P>
 
<P>   <EM>20-23 July 1995</EM></P>
 
<P> Huntsville is the &quot;birthplace of manned spaceflight.&quot; With some of
the best space oriented museums and exhibits in the world within a few miles, and
all conference attendees should have plenty to see and do. Take this opportunity
to put a face with the names you hear from this newsletter or email.  For more
information on the conference,  <A HREF="huntsville.html">get all the details
from Artemis '95</A>.</P>

<P><HR><P>
<H3 align=center><A NAME="documentary">Lights! Camera! Nonfiction!</A></H2>

<H4 align=center>(Can we really make money from a documentary?)</H4>
 
<P> Perhaps the most unique feature of the Artemis plan is the idea of <a href="/adb/03/04">making
money</a> from the entertainment value of space travel and lunar exploration.  While
much of this revenue will be generated by fictional drama based around the actual
activities of Artemis, nonfiction documentaries have always been intended to play
a part in boosting the total return.</P>

<P> The 1994 film <I>Hoop Dreams</I> has shown that there continues to be
an interest in Documentaries on the big screen.  But how much money can we expect to bring in from these nonfiction films?  With a handful of statistics from a recent issue of the industry publication Variety and a little research, it's
possible to get a pretty good picture of documentaries' money-making ability.</P>

<P> The news is definitely mixed.  On the one hand, documentaries account for
less than 1/3 of 1% of film revenue over the years.  But films make a lot of
money. Within that tiny fraction of total revenues, there is still room for
considerable income.</P>

<P> One of the surprises is how much of a &quot;layer cake&quot; the results
show.  With amazing consistency, documentaries can be slotted into broad
categories that have a direct relationship to their take.</P>

<P> Such quirky fare as <I>Roger and Me</I>, a highly self referential film
about attempts to interview the chairman of GM, pulled down $6.7 million over a
decade ago. There are a number of such off the wall films in the $5-10 million
dollar range.</P>

<P> The middle ranks of the documentary money makers are filled with films with
an outdoor setting.  Remember a man, a beach, and the search for the perfect
wave? <I>Endless Summer</I> brought in $10 million at the box office, and has since made more on TV.  It's also spurred a sequel.</P>

<P> More traditional nature documentaries have also done well.  Before these
shows became a staple of television, big budget nature shows were common on the
big screen.  <I>The Vanishing Wilderness</I> cleared $17 million, and is
the champion of this division.</P>

<P> The next chunk of documentaries have something to do with space travel, but a
lot more to do with quackery.  In the wake of the best-selling book, a film
version of <I>Chariots of the Gods</I> pulled down $25 million.  Right on
its heels was another film about the Bermuda Triangle.  These films were released
while the subject of these books were still &quot;hot,&quot; and show how
documentaries can be effective when played in combination with other media.</P>

<P> Though it only missed being a 70's event by only a couple of months,
<I>Woodstock</I> is still considered by many as the defining moment of 60's
culture. It's not surprising that the film version of this event did good
business in theaters, bringing in $34 million.  Inspired in part by this film's
success, other documentaries on the Beatles, Rolling Stones, and other groups
have brought in similar amounts.</P>

<P> To go much above this level, to reach the top of the charts, a documentary
needs a gimmick.  And the best gimmick of all for luring people into the theater
is to give the viewer something that goes beyond the normal cinema experience. 
Just as 3D glasses bumped up the income for <I>Creature from the Black Lagoon</I>, and rigged seating brought audiences to <I>The Tingler</I>, gimmicks have helped documentaries break out of the pack.</P>

<P> The king of gimmick theater is the 50's hit <I>This Is Cinearama</I>. 
The film was produced at a point when movies were first starting to be shown on
television, and theater owners were perceiving TV as a threat to their existence.
 In response, they tried to show that TV was limited, presenting a tiny, black
and white image that could never match movies.  To play up the difference between
the home and theater experience, this film was shot using special techniques and
played back on oversized, extra-wide screens.  Audiences found the first person
footage of Cinearama exhilarating -- a fact not lost on the designers of modern
interactive cinema and rides like Universal's <I>Back to the Future</I>. 
Even in theaters not equipped with the special screens, and in a time when the
average ticket price was fifty cents, Cinearama raked in $41 million, making it
the biggest grossing picture of the year, and arguably the most successful
documentary ever shown in theaters.</P>

<P> So is that the limit?  Adjusted for inflation, Cinearama's income would
represent a sizable amount of money.  But to find the real champ of documentary
dollars, you need to turn to another gimmick -- IMAX.</P>

<P> For those that have never been to an IMAX theater, the experience is far
different from that found at the local 12-plex.  IMAX film is several times
larger than normal film, and of higher resolution.  It's projected by an extra
bright bulb.  It runs through the projector at a much higher speed.  The result
of all this is a much clearer, more detailed picture.  The higher speed also
helps to make motion more effective, and allows some shots that scream
&quot;fake&quot; when done with normal movie gear.</P>

<P> In older IMAX theaters, the screen is 2-4x the usual theater screen, and
slightly warped to preserve the perspective of the optics in the IMAX system. 
Newer IMAX theaters have screens as much as six stories tall that are warped
around more than 180 degrees both vertically and horizontally.  They are also
equipped with 3D sound systems and speakers of tremendous power.</P>

<P> If you never made it to Kennedy for the launch of a shuttle, experiencing
that launch through IMAX -- with the bass pounding your stomach and making your
teeth vibrate -- is the next best thing.</P>

<P> It's not surprising that audiences have been flocking to IMAX ever since it's
premiere 20 years ago.  There are now 120 IMAX theaters in the United States. 
Many of them are associated with museums, science centers, or parks.  While a
few, like the screen at the Grand Canyon IMAX, play the same bill day after day,
most screens rotate through the slowly growing selection of IMAX films, changing
titles every few months.</P>

<P> The result gives IMAX films two important boosts in the monetary arena:
audiences come just to see the process, and IMAX films stay around year after
year.  With this is mind, it's not surprising that the champion IMAX film is also
the overall top documentary money maker.</P>

<P> <I>To Fly</I>, introduced 19 years ago, is only 27 minute long.  But it's take is
$83 million strong.  Several IMAX films using footage from the shuttle are also
in the upper ranks, earning over $50 million.</P>

<P> The strong performance of IMAX films in general and space-related films in
particular, make a good argument for producing Artemis in this format.  But
things might be changing in IMAX-land.  A new IMAX theater in New York is now
screening the first drama scripted especially for this format.  More IMAX fiction
pieces are in production, and these theaters may soon be less tied to nonfiction
material.  Besides, to get the kind of audience we want, it may be that IMAX is
too old.  Artemis should keep a look out for emerging technologies that might be
the next advance in film viewing.</P>

<P> And if all of these numbers look a bit low, keep in mind that these are
strictly the box office numbers.  Video and broadcast rights can easily raise the
value of the documentaries over $100 million. </P>

<H3 align=center><A NAME="alt_missions">Alternative Missions for the Lunar Transfer Vehicle</A></H3>
   
<font size=2>by  Gregory Bennett</font>
 
<H4>Lunar Transfer Vehicle Requirements</H4>
<P> The primary mission of the Artemis Project's <a href="/adb/04/02/01/ltv-notes.html">Lunar Transfer Vehicle</a> (LTV) is to move the crew and their
spacecraft between low Earth orbit and lunar orbit.  We must be able to reuse the
LTV for several missions, and for a variety of crew sizes from two to six people. 
This mission sets the basic requirements for the LTV.</P>

<P> In the reference mission, the LTV is based on the <a href="/adb/04/03/06/01/">Spacehab module</a>.  By removing all the module of the node that we
didn't need for the mission, we got rid of the great majority of the node's dry
weight.  (Dry weight is the mass of the vehicle when you leave out all the
fuel.)</P>

<P> Then we added some rockets for the main propulsion system and maneuvering,
and additional systems for propulsion, electrical power, thermal control, and
life support.  The node already has the internal equipment needed for controlling
all these systems, but external sensors and antennas have to be added for
guidance, navigation, and communication.</P>
 
<P> <IMG SRC="/Gifs/ltv_m_01.GIF">  <EM>Lunar Transfer Vehicle</EM></P>

<P> This simplified diagram from the reference mission shows the basic concept.
The actual reference vehicle looks more like a cylinder with a rocket nozzle at
one end.  The body-mounted solar power cells and radiators, antennas, and
maneuvering rockets are mounted on ring-shaped service modules attached fore and aft of the pressurized crew compartment.  The LTV is about 15 feet in overall
diameter.</P>

<P> The performance of a rocket system is measured in how much it can accelerate
a given payload.  In engineering terms, we refer to the change in velocity as
delta D.  Engineering shorthand for as delta V is DV, using the Greek letter
delta (D) as the symbol for change.  (In fact, D is the universal symbol for
engineering. Remember what Scotty said in the first Star Trek movie: &quot;I know
engineers; they love to change things!&quot;)</P>

<P> If you add up all the rocket burns needed to get from Earth orbit to an orbit
60 nautical miles above the moon, you get about 13,500 feet per second.  That
defines the LTV's propulsion requirements: it must be able to impart a DV of
13,500 ft/sec to the entire Artemis stack (about 80,000 pounds of spacecraft and
crew when it starts out from Earth orbit, about the weight of two railroad
engines). Then, after the crew has done their work on the moon, it must again
handle a DV of 13,500 ft/sec to get itself, the crew, and the Ascent Stage
vehicle (about 7,000 pounds total dry weight, a couple of mid-sized automobiles)
back from lunar orbit to an orbit around the Earth. </P>

<P> The LTV must be able to keep the crew alive and comfortable for at least six
days (three days out, three days back) of active use, and remain unattended in
lunar orbit for several weeks while the crew works on the surface of the moon. 
Because of the nature of the Artemis Project, the LTV has to support very high
data rates with its communications systems' two channels of compressed
high-resolution video.  So it has the radio power of a small communications
satellite.</P>

<P> The basic concept for refueling the LTV is to replace its empty fuel tanks
with full ones in low Earth orbit.  For the first few missions at least, the
spacecraft will be refueled with full tanks brought up from earth's surface.  The
empty tanks will be stored in Earth orbit so they can be reused later, refilled
with hydrogen from Earth and <a href="/adb/04/03/10/04/oxygen-exraction.html">oxygen</a> shipped in from the moon.</P>
 
<P><HR><P>
<H3 align=center>Other Missions for the LTV</H3>

<P> Given all that the LTV can do, it begs the question, what else might we do
with it?</P>

<H4> Earth orbit research laboratory.</H4>
<P> Since the LTV's docking mechanisms are
compatible with those used on the International Space Station, it can be attached
to the space station for use as additional laboratory space.  Its interior
outfitting will accommodate standard space station payload racks, and its windows provide opportunities for Earth observation. </P>

<H4>LEO free-flyer.</H4>
<P> The LTV can also fly free in low Earth orbit, supporting its
crew for a week or more of Earth observation.  During these missions it can also
be used in conjunction with NASA's manned maneuvering unit to recover or repair
satellites in low Earth orbit with no modification. </P>
 
<H4>Geosynchronous satellite servicing</H4>
<P> Geosynchronous orbit is that circular orbit around the Earth where we park
most of our communications satellites.  Flying a crew to and from geosynchronous
orbit is certainly within the propulsion capabilities of the LTV; however there
is a problem: Earth's radiation belts.  In its reference mission, the LTV passes
through the radiation belts very quickly, exposing the crew to a maximum dose of
1 REM of radiation.  To put that into perspective, NASA's 30-day exposure limit
is 25 REM.  Workers on Earth are limited to 5 REM/year, and the median lethal
dose is 450 REM.  To remain for any length of time inside the radiation belts,
the crew will have to be heavily shielded.  Even their space suits will require
extra shielding. This doesn't make it impossible to service communications
satellites in geosynchronous orbit, but it does mean additional development and
experimentation will be required before we can commit the LTV this kind of
mission.</P>
 
<H4> Near-Earth Asteroids</H4>
<P> Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of metal-rich asteroids orbit the sun near the
Earth.  An article in  the Journal of Geophysical Research estimated that a
kilometer-sized metal bearing Near-Earth Asteroid contains up to 400,000 metric
tons of platinum-group metals.  Those metals would command a price of 5 trillion
dollars at current U. S. market prices; however, the article points out that
flooding the market with this much metal would reduce the market value to 320
billion dollars.  That's still an incredible economic incentive to explore these
asteroids. The DV required to rendezvous with and explore a near-Earth asteroid
is actually less than that required to land on the moon. The mission would be
longer -- perhaps as long as nine months -- so the logistics of providing life
support for the crew become more complex.  We would want to add closed-loop
systems for water and atmosphere.  The total vehicle weight grows, and with the
fuel requirements.  The additional fuel can be accommodated in strap-on tanks,
located over the crew compartment to provide additional radiation shielding. In
contrast to the geosynchronous orbit mission, radiation is less of a problem for
an asteroid exploration flight.  The primary radiation concern is the Galactic
Cosmic Radiation dose the crew will receive, with the additional likelihood of an
anomalously large solar flare event.  The crew can be protected from a solar
flare by providing a region of massive shielding -- most likely the main engine
compartment with all its tanks and plumbing -- which can be oriented toward the
incoming proton flux.</P>
 
<H4>Circumlunar flight</H4>
<P> Finally, one proposed mission for the LTV can be carried out with no
modification at all to the vehicle: a trip to lunar orbit similar to that of
Apollo 8.  While it has been done before, it hasn't been done for a long time,
and we will be able to make this exciting flight even before the other Artemis
vehicles are completed.  In addition to generating a tremendous amount of
publicity for the project, such a flight would be a shake-down cruise for the
LTV, the crew, and the flight support team here on Earth.</P>

<P><HR><P>
<H3 align=center><A NAME="ltv">Changes to the LTV?</A></H3>

<P>Like all the rest of the vehicles that make up the Artemis &quot;stack,&quot;
the LTV is a long way from its final version.  Recently, a lot of number
crunching has been going on that indicates some changes might have to be made in
the design and operation of the LTV.</P>

<P>Current plans call for the LTV to act as the delivery vehicle that will bring
the lunar habit to lunar orbit during our first mission.  However, this places
extraordinary requirements on the LTV in its first mission as it has to transport
a mass much greater than it will in ordinary earth to moon shuttle service.</P>

<P>One possibility would be to trim the functionality of the LTV back to a
simple ferry, and provide some seperate, perhaps expendable, booster to carry the
habitat core into place.  The LTV could then make do with smaller engines and
fuel tanks, and would be less expensive to build and launch.</P>

<P>However, if the LTV was trimmed back to the minimum requirements for crew
transport, it would no longer be capable of some of the extended missions
discussed in the previous article.  And it would be unable to deliver a second
habitat module when needed.</P>

<P>Stay tuned, and feel free to send your comments and discussion on the
subject. </P>

<H3 align=center><A NAME="news">News Cruise</A></H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>News of Interest to Artemis Society Members</H4>
<P><font size=2>compiled by Cynthia Griffin of Space Research Associates in
Houston</font></P>

<H4>European Community in Space</H4>
<P> Later this year the European Space Agency will further consider their lunar
exploration initiative. ESA representatives have been &quot;enthusiastic about
the rich opportunities offered by the exploration and utilization of the
Moon&quot; and have proposed a &quot;phased approach&quot; for such a plan.  In
contrast to NASA's &quot;faster-cheaper-better&quot; mode, European engineers
were directed to inject more up-front cost and technology discipline to their
lunar lander program.  At this time it is not certain whether the phased approach
of the lunar initiative will include manned mission in later phases.</P>
 
<H4>The way it used to be</H4>
<P>After the Apollo 11 lunar landing, Wernher von Braun's plan was to have a
six-person station orbiting the Moon by 1975. This would be followed in five
years by a six-person lunar surface base.  By 1990 von Braun had hoped to have 24
people in lunar orbit and 48 people living on the surface of the Moon engaged in
mining, astronomy, biology, selenology (lunar geology), seismology, regional
exploration, and planetary quarantine.  The planetary quarantine facility would
be used for martian samples from the semipermanent Mars base that von Braun hoped would be operational at the same time as the more permanent lunar base.</P>
 
<H4>Great Haul of China</H4>
<P>China's space plan for the next five years includes a satellite to orbit the
Moon near the year 2000.  &quot;China's space technology now has the capacity to
probe the Moon,&quot; said Jiang Jingshan, director of the Space Centre of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences.  Studies are underway to determine the scope of the
lunar mission after preliminary optical and microwave remote sensing satellites
are placed in Earth orbit.  China earlier announced it planned to place its first
astronaut in orbit around 2000.</P>

<H4>Who you gonna call?</H4>
<P> Scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory have linked the levels of
high-energy electrons encircling Earth to the solar cycle and are offering their
data to help satellite designers.  According to Richard Belian of Los Alamos, the
biggest threat to spacecraft is not during the Sun's most intensely active part
of its 11-year cycle (solar maximum) as many had believed, but about one year
before solar minimum.  Since the next solar minimum will occur in 1996, the
threat of solar radiation trapped in the Earth's magnetosphere is now high.  As
more electronics are added to satellites, the issue of shielding from damaging
radiation is growing in importance.</P>
 
<H4>An Oscar-winning name</H4>
<P> Actor Tom Hanks, awarded an Oscar for <I>Forrest Gump</I> and now portraying
astronaut Jim Lovell in the movie <I>Apollo 13</I>, has his own production company in
Century City, California.  It's not unusual for actors to get into the movie
production side of the business, but what is unusual is the name of Hanks'
company:  Cla Vius Base.  Asked to explain, Hanks was quoted in Daily Variety: 
&quot;It's from <I>2001: A Space Odyssey</I>.  When that came out in 1968, I couldn't
sleep the night before.  It was the first time I was moved in a different way by
a movie. The character in the movie was going to Cla Vius Base in a moon bus. 
It's also the name of the biggest crater on the moon.  Also, it's a goofy name I
had come up with to name my production company.&quot;</P>
 
<H4>Coming to an Earth theater near you</H4>
<P>&quot;Space&quot; seems to be the word for movies nowadays as the production
company Lion's Share Inc. continues working on its project called <I>Helium 3,
Power to Rule the World</I>.  The story takes place in 2025 when people live
in a violent society where poverty prevails, the ozone layer is gone, and fossil
fuels are completely depleted.  <a href="/adb/02/09/he3-intro.html">Helium 3</a> from the Moon is believed to be the only
chance of saving Earth.  The reluctant hero Steven Webb has to battle the evil
Megatech, the world's largest corporation, which is monopolizing the Helium 3
market and holding the world hostage.  The movie began production last year.</P>
 
<H4>Home down under</H4>
<P> A group called Oregon Moonbase is running lunar-base simulations in lava
caves located around Bend, Oregon.  The idea is to test the feasibility of using
lunar lava flow tubes to place habitat modules below the surface of the Moon. 
First suggested by NASA scientist Friedrich Horz in 1985, using lunar lava tubes
for moon bases would help shield residents from cosmic and solar flare radiation.
The group proposes using light, inflatable habitation modules that would fit into
the long narrow tunnels.  Good news for homemakers:  researchers believe the
lunar lava tubes won't be as dusty as the Oregon caves.</P>
 
<H4>Mister, can you paradigm?</H4>
<P> Richard Hoagland, former space consultant to NBC and CBS News, is probably
more well known today as the guy who believes in the &quot;Face on Mars.&quot; 
For over 11 years, Hoagland has been campaigning across the country trying to get
scientists to seriously consider that an advanced civilization once lived on
Mars.  In his book <I>The Monuments of Mars</I>,  he describes his belief
that intelligence-built structures on Mars and the Moon are linked to structures
on Earth and that they are all tied together by an advanced new physics he
describes as &quot;hyperdimensional.&quot;  Hoagland's campaign has led him to
even address the United Nations, but to no avail.  What does Hoagland do in his
spare time?  He raises funds for private missions to the moon or Mars with the
hope of proving his theories.</P>
 
<H4>Here comes the Sun</H4>
<P> The Suntracker program tracks the Sun from a given position on the Moon. 
Computer programmers Warren Woods and Dustin Spires of NASA's Marshall Space
Flight Center developed the Suntracker program which computes the selenographic
(moon-centered) position of the Sun at a given Julian date, then converts the
selenographic position of the Sun into azimuth and elevation at the given
position on the Moon based on the lunar equatorial plane.  The program has its
limits, however.  The orbital elements used do not account for nutation,
aberration, and precession.  And the selenographic coordinates computed by the
program are based on 1961 algorithms which have since been updated.  Yet when
compared with computations based on newer values, the programmers report average deviations in selenographic longitude and latitude computed by Suntracker were less than 0.02 deg.</P>
 
<H4>Now in print</H4>
<P> The new book <I>Free Space!  Real Alternatives for Reaching Outer
Space</I> is a good read for the person interested in space but who may
believe NASA is the only ball game in town.  The book introduces the growing
alternative to government-sponsored space exploration - the private commercial
space movement. Written by B. Alexander Howerton, the book includes a general

Here's our "generic" answer:</P><H3>What Oregon Moonbase isn't -- and is</H3><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether there's anything to see at our experimental sitedepends on what you're looking for. There are no improvements at the site(other than fences), no facilities or experiments currently in place.  (Norestrooms, no water)</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;What we do have is a set of lava tube caves, basalt terrain,and sand mixed with volcanic dust, a useful analog to dusty lunar regolith.Our site can be made available for experimenters wishing to bring their ownequipment into a primitive site and test it.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past we have brought in Young Astronauts and adultsand equipment, built a small operational base, and conducted Moon Baseexercises. After each trip we dismantled the equipment and returned it toits sponsoring institution, the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry(OMSI). A Rockwell engineer also tested a prototype "lunar cart" at thesite, and we performed under NASA contract to characterize the site andplan a full-service experimental facility there.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We prefer some other season than midwinter to visit oursite, because it is east of the Cascade mountains in Oregon's high desert(3700' elevation) country. Although the site is usually (not always) clear,the roads to the site from our homes in the Willamette Valley cross highmountain passes that are frequently and often unpredictably covered withsnow and ice. Visits are more conveniently scheduled between mid-April tomid-October, although we will be happy to try anytime anyone is interestedand available.</P><H3>IF you are interested in visiting lava tube caves</H3><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are caves on public lands open year-round if you canget there. Ape Cave on the southern slopes of Mt. St. Helens is open evenif its little visitor's office is closed, and other caves exist west ofTrout Lake (town) in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in southernWashington. In Oregon, Lava River Cave is open right next to highway U.S.97 south of Bend, for a small fee, and lanterns are available there forrent. This is a large cave easily accessible just a few hundred yards off amain thoroughfare.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Other large caves are scattered on the north and southslopes of Newberry Mountain south of Bend, marked on USGS and ForestService maps (Deschutes National Forest; Newberry Volcanic Monument). Notethat Newberry is a large shield volcano similar to those seen on Mars (butnot as big).  All of  the Bend-area caves are in lavasassociated with Newberry (the City of Bend is built on Newberry lavas).</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Another shield volcano is Medicine Lake volcano east of Mt.Shasta in northern California. A world-class collection of dramatic lavatube caves exists on the far northern flank of Medicine Lake, set aside asLava Beds National Monument. It is probably the best place to study lavatube caves in the continental U.S. The nearest significant town is KlamathFalls in southern Oregon. We highly recommend Lava Beds for lava tubestudies. Winter is not the best time to visit this area.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a volcanic field with some lava tubes in NewMexico's El Malpais / Bandera Volcano wilderness, west of Albuquerque.These are not quite as large as the northwest caves, and tend to be moreeroded, rockfall choked, and possibly older.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We also recommend Hawaii for lava tube caves. They are stillbeing made there today. Best place is the Big Island (Hawaii), but cavesalso exist on Oahu, Kauai, and probably the other islands as well. We'veheard about large lava tube caves in Korea, Australia, and the CanaryIslands.</P><H3>Getting in touch</H3><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're interested in meeting and talking to our LunarBase Research Team, we have an office space available in Portland and arealways glad to get together to talk about our research and other spaceissues. Since we have other, paying jobs, it would be easiest to meet on aweekend.</P><P>Let us know if you want to get together sometime.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>Bryce Walden, Chair, Oregon L5 Research Team<br>Oregon L5 Society<br>P.O.

Electronic Communication --><!-- file: /adb/09/document-revision-format.html --><!-- Keywords: document paper essay updates current up-to-date numberingsystem format conventions --><!-- v 1.0 --><h2 align="center">Artemis Data Book</H2><h2 align="center">9. Electronic Communication</H2><h2 align="center">Document Revision Numbering System</H2><P><HR><P><P>Our current document numbering systemassumes we publish paper, and only paper.  Meanwhile, 99.99% of what we'republishing is electronic.</P><P>By the very nature of the internet, all files are subject to revision,unlike paper editions. Adding a revision letter when we make editorialchanges to a givenformat for a document, and updating the rev number when we make asubstantial change in the content appears to be the best approach toorganising inevitable updates.</P><P>Let's design this with the mission in mind: Why track revisions todocuments?</P><ol><LI><P>So someone using a document can determine if this is the       latest version.</P><LI><P>So the book boss can determine what changes were made for       what reason, and go back to old revisions if necessary.</P><LI><P>So people contributing information to the document will see      what changes others have made, and determine if their work is       affected by other changes.  That is, page change notices (or       perhaps section change notices) highlight changes so that       everyone using that information will be notified that a change       has occurred.</P><LI><P>So we can do an impact assessment.  If a change looks like       it will affect others' work, we should distribute a proposed       change before accepting it.  This allows others to determine how       the change will affect what they're doing; and then the sundry       product teams and managers can decide whether this change is       worth implementing.</P></OL><P>So there should be a common identifier that changes when the <I>content</I>of a document changes, as well as an identifier for editorial changes thatdon't affect the content.  For instance, in a <ahref="/adb/j/">document</a> defining the<a href="/adb/04/">Reference Mission</a>, switching from space stationmodules to <a href="/adb/04/03/06/01/">SPACEHAB modules</a>is a significant change; while changing the spelling from "Spacehab" to"SPACEHAB" is an editorial change.</P><P>If a user picks up rev 20 of a given document, he should know thatregardless of the format, the information contained in that document is thesame in the rev 20 he'll see on the web or in an electronic Word Perfectfile.  Formatting and editorial nits may vary, but the basic information isthe same.  An important part of that information is the outline -- anychange to the outline constitutes a major change to a document because whenuser refers to section 5.3.6, he should not be sending someone to an essayon farming when he's talking about hypergolic propellants.</P><P>Mostly, we can track these through the filename extensions: '.wp' forWord Perfect, '.msw' for Microsoft Word, '.txt' for plain text, '.html' forHTML.  To accommodate older operating systems, we probably do not want togo to a decimal system of tracking editorial changes such as "r20.1.msw".That leaves us with your original suggestion: add a letter for editorialchanges specific to a given format.</P><P>Each document should have a book boss who tells everyone when asubstantial change is made, as well as a designated maintainer for eachformat who updates the document in his format when the book boss approves amajor change.  If the maintainer fixes some editorial nits, he'll incrementthe revision letter without worrying about what other folks are doing.  Sor20a.msw might not be exactly the same as r20a.wp or r20a.html, but atleast all those r20's contain the same information.</P><P>In the printed documents and electronic files, we can track revnumbers on the title page, lists of active pages, revision history, andwhatnot.  But for the web documents, this sounds like yet another item toput in small type in the footer.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Tue, Apr 16, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

<HTML> <HEAD> <TITLE>9. Using the Internet to Get Work Done</TITLE> </HEAD><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><!-- Artemis Data Book section 9. Electronic Communication --><!-- file: /adb/09/internet-use.html --><!-- Keywords: internet team work volunteer labour email mailing list taskproductivity --><h2 align="center">Artemis Data Book</H2><h2 align="center">9. Electronic Communication</H2><h2 align="center">Using the Internet to Get Work Done</H2><P><HR><P><P>There are a number of problems (and advantages) with mostforms of internet communications when they are related toreal problem-solving.</P><OL><LI><P><B>Growth</B> - The net is growing so fast that there is an eternalsupply of newbies ready, willing, and able to tell us all about the New Ideasand Startling Tidbits they have. All of which were last discussed with thebatch of newbies 3 months ago... And thus it has been for 15 years...</P><P>This may change when the net reaches a market saturation level. Whenthat happens, newbies will be real children instead of cyberspacechildren.</P><LI><P><B>Focus</B> -  It is very difficult to solve problems unless thereis direction, focus, goal-seeking, problem space pruning and anidentifiable "deliverable" as an end point. None of these exist in thetypical unmoderated (or moderated, for the matter) groups.</P><LI><P><B>Creativity</b> - The net comes up with high marks because evenoff-the-wall ideas are discussed. There are few mechanisms of brainstormingthat can match the freewheeling nature of the net.</P><LI><P><B>Globalization</B> - As human knowledge explodes, individualspecializations  have become narrower and narrower by necessity. Thedownside is that it becomes more and more difficult for the researchers ina narrow area to communicate with each other. Fields stagnate without theintellectual ferment caused by bull sessions and esoteric argumentationbetween peers. In the internet world we can have a few specialists sharinga narrow interest act as a virtual institute on that subject.</P><LI><P><B>Synthesis</B> - Specialization has also had a down side. Thenarrower the areas of research, the more there is that falls in the cracks.And the number of cracks is probably more like a polynomial explosion thana linear one. But the ease of access to discussions on the net means thatit is easy for cross-fertilization to happen. If a statement is made by aresearcher in a physics speciality, it may end up being cross-posted andmailed to hundreds or thousands of others in different specialties. Thiscan and does spark debates and new research.</P></OL><P>How do we structure information systems so that real work can beaccomplished?  Let's start with idea generation and progress through to adefinable product.</P><H3>Structure</H3><OL><LI><P><B>Virtual Pub / Dorm Lounge / Student Union Snack Bar</B></P><P>This is the open mail list or newsgroup. People come and go, dip intodiscussion as they feel like it. Little real work gets done here, but newideas are generated and old truths demolished.</P><P>Ideas start from bull sessions. The ideas might pop up spontaneously, ortheymight be tossed into the the shark tank by a "moderator" from LRC. In theformer case, ASI is feeding ideas to LRC; in the latter, LRC has a problemfor which it needs ideas or an answer.</P><P>But bull sessions do not a product make. Something further has to happen. Onesuggestion is that an LRC or ASI bull-session monitor watch the opendiscussions and when an interesting idea comes up, that idea be assignedvirtual office space. At this point we stop being democratic and start working.One individual is assigned as the team leader. Others who are interested indeveloping the idea are given the option of being a part of the team. Forbetter or worse the team leader is boss and may fire those who are disruptive,fail to complete assigned tasks, or who continuously stray from goal directedbehavior.</P><P>In turn, the team leader is assigned a deadline and milestones by LRC. Thedeliverable is a technical report, possibly with a minority report attached.A team that fails to meet its deadlines can be disbanded by the management.Teams are disbanded and members reassigned when they complete theirprojects.</P><LI><P><B>Virtual Office</B></P><P>A place where a group with an interest in a particular topic works  in astructured environment with responsibilities and accountabilityenforced.</P><P>When a draft report has been completed, it is then thrown open to generaldebate in an open "peer group" forum. This could consist of making it availableto the members of the bull session and to relevant newsgroups.</P><LI><P><B>Virtual Conference Hall</B></P><P>A place where reports are presented and open debate held on theircontent. Off-topic debate is forbidden. Only matters relating to critiqueof the report are allowed.</P><P>A specific time limit is placed on the comment period. When that periodis ended, the team filters through the comments and generates a final report.The final report is published as part of a body of high quality *reviewed*design and research on which LRC can base its plans.</P><LI><P><B>Virtual Library</P></B><P>A place where final reports are available for search and reference.Now how do we go about creating a structure like this? We certainly don't wantto go out and write new tools. That would delay any such efforts by years. Itis also probably unnecessary. Most of it can be accomplished within theframework of existing tools, <i>given that LRC has a professional manager tocreate teams and monitor results</i>. At some point this should be a full timeprofessional position.  LRC is used rather than ASI, as there arepossibilities here for real work that needs real management.</P></OL><H3>Now the mechanisms:</H3><OL><LI><P>The Pub is simply the <a href="/adb/09/03/artemis-list.html">Artemislist</a> as it exists. Noisy, high volume, some gems and a fair amount ofchaff.</P><LI><P>The Office is a set of <ahref="/adb/09/03/listserver-rqts.html">small mail lists</a> with a limitedgroup of people on it. LRC assigns the leaders and sets the goals anddeadlines. The team leader has rights to hire and fire his volunteers asnecessary to complete the job. When the job is done, the mail list isdisbanded. Some groups might be longer-lived if they are really good atproducing results on an ongoing basis. It is even conceivable that the bestof the best might one day become a real set of employees with LRC.</P><P>But the watch word is "Only Results Count". And LRC defines what Resultsmeans.</P><LI><P>The Virtual Conference Hall could be based on the Web site recentlycreated by the MIT Media Lab for their <ahref="http://1010.org">1010.org</a> discussion. It has all the rightproperties. We would place the draft report(s) up on the web site and allcomers could read them and make comments. The comments are stored and theteam leader could collect them on a given "end of comment period" date. TheTeam then discussed the comments and writes the final report.</P><LI><P>The Virtual Library is simply the <ahref="/adb/outline.html">Artemis Data Book</a>. Final Reports are put on-line when they have been approved. There might be a need for two areas: onewhich is reports that deal with "official" LRC positions and plans; and onewhich is more speculative or not directly related to primary goals of thecorporation.</P><P>As technologies (or more honestly, time and people and resources toimplement existing technologies) become available, search engines and thelike can be added to make topics more easily accessible.</P></OL><P>Nothing is static. There must always be feedback and continued debate. Withthis procedure we end up with quality information. Then, when a newbie debatebegins, or when wizards rehash an old truth with new facts, a starting pointcan be pointed out which is accessible to all. With some luck that willraise the overall level of debate even in "the Pub".</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Fri, March 15, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/amon.dale.html">Dale Amon</a> <ahref="mailto:amon@walt.music.qub.ac.uk">&lt;amon@walt.music.qub.ac.uk&gt;</a>, maintained by <AHREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">The Artemis Project</a>is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar Resources Company</a>.</font></body></html>

<h2 align="center">Web Site Access Statistics Notes</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Gregory R. Bennett</I></P>
<P><HR><P>

<P>It is important to track web site access statistics so we can assemble a
historical graph. These metrics would be very valuable. Besides provding
fodder for charts to impress the visitor to the ASI site, those historical
data will provide the Artemis Project with valuable management data:</P>

<ul type=circle>
 <li>whether we're growing or stagnating, or even driving people away
 <li>which articles are most popular (good marketing data)
 <li>number of impressions each article gets (for selling advertising
       and attracting big sponsors to the Artemis Project)
 <li>effectiveness of sundry advertising campaigns
 <li>how much the technical teams are using the on-line resources
       (so we can decide if they're worth doing)
 <li>whether users can find the information they're looking for (an
       important common reference page that doesn't get very many hits
       when lots of folks should be looking it up is probably too hidden)
 <li>effectiveness of getting listed in sundry search engines
 <li>effectiveness of links from other web sites
 <li>frequency of hits from non-Anglophone countries (to decide whether
       we need to invest resources in translating the pages into Japanese
       or Sanskrit; and whether we should emphasize the international
       nature of the project or downplay it)
 <li>Relative number of hits from ISP's who cater to the home user vs.
       business, government, and educational users
<li>Number of accesses from organizations that run related programs,
       such as ESA, NASA, NASDA, RSA, universities</ul>

<P>For example, given a large enough body of information, we can decide
whether it's really true that the greatest appeal of the project is "you
can go, too." If folks visit pretty pictures of the lunar community but
very few visit the "how you get to go" parts, we'll get a hint that the
adventure story is more important than the reality of being able to go
there yourself.</P>

<P>One graph I'd like to see: historical growth in number of hits vs. 
time since we started the web site. Perhaps another curve normalizing that
information by dividing by the number of households with web site access. 
Both the growth trend and the bumps on the curve would be very telling. 
For instance, AOL recently upgraded their browser big time, and of course
we had the release of Windows 95 with the new Microsoft browser. Did those
have any effect on the number of people visiting our site?</P>

<P>The really significant point here is that all those tour pages would
have the same format as the main entrance. Note that the body of those
tour pages really should be part of the <a href="/adb/">Artemis Data
Book</a>. There is no reason why the Tour can't access pages stored in the
Data Book's structure; and lots of reasons why it should do so. All this
will be transparent to the visitor, unless he likes to study URL's as he
surfs the waves through the site.</P>

<P>Each tour page will necessarily be very short to avoid scrolling,
making just one or two major points about the project. Graphics on these
pages will be small, with limited screen real estate available.</P>

<P>One recommendation for the graphical design for the Tour: put forward 
and backward buttons, obviously arrows, centered on the bottom of the 
screen, with no other clutter near them. Set up the tour so that a 
visitor can click through the whole tour without even moving his mouse.</P>

So here is a little overview of creating your own forms so that manyof you can add them to new web pages, and make our <ahref="/index.html">cool site</a> even cooler!</P><P>Web page forms are not difficult to do.  There is a lot of referencematerial available on the web to show and demonstrate all of the differentaspects of creating and using forms.  Some of the most helpful resourcesused for setting up the initial ECTC forms were links from a "<ahref="http://www2.ncsu.edu/bae/people/faculty/walker/hotlist/forms.html">Howtodo forms</a>" page at NC State University, and it is highly recommended foranyone interested in web forms.  Another usefulreference for the syntax of the HTML form tags is the "<ahref="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/fill-out-forms/overview.html">Mosiac for X version 2.0 Fill-Out Form Support</a>".  Anexcellent tutorial for setting up forms is Brian Exelbierd's "<ahref="http://www.catt.ncsu.edu/users/bex/www/tutor/index.html">Learn toWrite CGI-Forms</a>" tutorial, especially the"Sending mail from a cgi-bin script" lesson.  And last but not least, forspecifics about the CGI configuration on the current <ahref="/index.html">Artemis Project web site</a> at<a href="http://clever.net">Clever.net</a>, you should read <ahref="http://clever.net/self/faq/cgi.html">CleverNet's CGI Scripts FAQ</a>.If the CGI setup environment is different when <ahref="http://asi.org/">asi.org</a>moves to its new home, the changes will be posted.</P><P>The basic part of every form is a block of text and HTML tags in a webpage that is surrounded by the <TT>&lt;form&gt;</TT> and<TT>&lt;/form&gt;</TT> HTML tags.  Here is the form section of the "<ahref="/adb/09/01/ectc.html">join the ECTC</a>" form:</P><PRE>&lt;form method="POST" action="http://www.asi.org/bin/ectc-join.cgi"&gt;&lt;table border=0 rowspan=4 colspan=2 cellspacing=5&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Member Type:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;select name="Type"&gt;&lt;option&gt; Member&lt;option&gt; Representative&lt;option&gt; Observer&lt;/select&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your Name:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type="text" size=60 name="Name"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;E-mail Address:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type="text" size=60 name="Email"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr align=top&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comments:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;textarea name="Comments" rows=10cols=60&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;input type=submit value=" Join "&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/form&gt;</PRE><P>As you can see, there isn't that much to it.  In fact, much of the aboveHTML is the table formatting used to line up the form fields, which isunrelated to the form processing itself.  The key part of the form tag is the"action" keyword, which identifies the CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scriptthat is run on the web server when the user presses the submit button(labeled Join in this form).  CGI scripts are discussed a little later on.The different form fields used in this example are the "select" field type,which presents a list of choices, the input field for regular data input andthe button, and the text area field for free-form text input.  There are twotypes of input fields used here, the "text" type for normal text input, andthe "submit" type used for the Join button. The "select" field type includes alist of possible choices, each one on its own line preceeded by the "option"HTML tag.</P><P>Now on to the CGI scripting part of this process.  This form, like manyother web forms, simply generates an e-mail message with the data from theform that is sent to a specified address.  The CGI script that is executed bythis form simply reads the data sent from the form, formats it into a mailmessage, and executes the system command to mail the message.  Because it iswell suited for text data processing, most web forms use Perl as the scriptlanguage for CGI processing.  Here is the Perl script used for the "<ahref="/adb/09/01/ectc.html">Join the ECTC</a>" form:</P><PRE>#!/usr/bin/perl# Define constants$recipient = 'severy@asi.org';#Print out what we needprint "Content-type: text/html\n\n";print "&lt;Head&gt;&lt;Title&gt;Thank you&lt;/Title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt;";print "&lt;Body&gt;&lt;H1&gt;Thank you&lt;/H1&gt;";#Get the inputread(STDIN, $buffer, $ENV{'CONTENT_LENGTH'});#Split the name-value pairs@pairs = split(/&/, $buffer);foreach $pair (@pairs){    ($name, $value) = split(/=/, $pair);    $value =~ tr/+/ /;    $value =~ s/%([a-fA-F0-9][a-fA-F0-9])/pack("C", hex($1))/eg;    # Stop people from using subshells to execute commands    $value =~ s/~!/ ~!/g;    $FORM{$name} = $value;}# Now send mail to $recipientif ($FORM{'Email'} eq "") {$FORM{'Email'} = 'unknown';}open (MAIL, "|/usr/lib/sendmail -t");print MAIL "To: $recipient\n";print MAIL "From: $FORM{'Email'}\n";print MAIL "Reply-To: $FORM{'Email'}\n";print MAIL "Subject: New ECTC Member\n\n";print MAIL "$FORM{'Name'} at $FORM{'Email'} has joined the ECTC as a$FORM{'Type'}\n\n";print MAIL  "-------------------------< Comments >-----------------------\n";print MAIL "$FORM{'Comments'}";print MAIL "\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n";print MAIL "\nRemote host: $ENV{'REMOTE_HOST'}\n";print MAIL "Remote IP address: $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'}\n";close (MAIL);print "Thank you for joining the ECTC!&lt;P&gt;";</PRE><P>Once again you can see that there isn't that much to this CGI script.Even without knowing Perl, one caneasily figure out what most of the script is doing.  At the beginning of thescript we set up a variable that contains the destination address of the mailmessage.  This will make it easier to change that address as needed in thefuture.  After that the script generates the initial response that is sentback to the user.  One key thing to remember is that all output from a CGIscript is sent back to the user as if it was a requested web page.Consequently, anything "printed" by the CGI script (as is done by the "print"statements above) needs to be true HTML as if it was a static web page.That's why the output from a CGI script always has to start with the"Content-type" tag to tell the Web browser what type of document it'sreceiving.  The "foreach" block of the CGI script parses the form data (whichis passed as a command-line parameter to the CGI script) into a set of variablesthat we later use in building the mail message.  The script then opens aconnection to the "sendmail" program, which is used to mail the message, andgenerates the text that is the body of the mail message.  The last printstatement is the last part of the web page that is returned to the user as theresult of the CGI script.</A><P>The current ASI web server requires that all CGIscripts end in the extension ".cgi", so make sure any scripts you createfollow that naming convention.  Currently, most CGI scripts on the ASI webserver are stored in the /bin directory, which only the webmaster (<ahref="mailto:webmaster@asi.org">Dana Carson</a>) can access, so ifyou want to have a new CGI script put on the web server, send it to <AHREF="MAILTO:webmaster@asi.org">&lt;webmaster@asi.org&gt;</A> andhe'll put it in the right place.  If you have any problems using the aboveguidelines, <a href="mailto:severy@asi.org">let me know</a> and I'll behappy to help.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sun, Mar 31, 1996<br>Content by Randall Severy <ahref="mailto:severy@asi.org">&lt;severy@asi.org&gt;</a>, maintained by <AHREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar Resources Company</a>.</font></body></html>

Having a cgi script piece together pages outof master lists of email addresses and common header/footer code would saveenormous amounts of labour -- time which can be spent getting us to themoon.</P><P>We could have separate text files named "foobar.body", which getincorporated into "foobar.html" files.  The indexer would only list the"foobar.html" files it finds in a given directory.</P><PRE>     +--------------------------------------------------------+     |                         Header                         | added     |  Tags: html, doctype, keyword comments, head, body     | by     |  Output: page title, doc section number, doc name      | machine     |          author, standard decorations                  |     +--------------------------------------------------------+     +--------------------------------------------------------+     |                          Body                          |     |  Tags: author, maintainer, title, doc name, etc.       | maintained     |  Output: body of document, in-lined images, internal   | by     |          navigation links                              | human     |                                                        |     |  Note: Info tags don't need to be .html file, only in  |     |        .body file                                      |     +--------------------------------------------------------+     +--------------------------------------------------------+     |                         Footer                         |     | Tags: /body, /html                                     | added     | Output: navbar, author link, maintainer link, mod date | by     |         copyright declaration, link to local index     | machine     |                                                        |     +--------------------------------------------------------+</PRE><P>To make this work, we need to establish a standard format for tellingthe indexer the name of each document.  That could be a separate filelisting all the foobar.body files and the document name for each, or itcould be a standard-format comment field contained in each foobar.bodyfile.  I think it would be easiest to maintain the documents if weestablished a standard form for putting comments in the foobar.bodydocuments.</P><P>The standard format for tags in a .body document might be:</P><PRE>     &lt;!-- asidocname="Subject of this essay" --&gt;     &lt;!-- asidocsection="4.6.5.3.1" --&gt;     &lt;!-- asiauthor="H. W. Wrotethis --&gt;     &lt;!-- asimaintainer="I. M. Aitchtiemell" --&gt;     &lt;!-- asicopyright="Mark Territory, Inc." --&gt;     &lt;!-- asiorigdate="mm-dd-yyyy" --&gt;</PRE><P>The text "asi" is added to the tag names because future version of html mightadd some keywords, but it's unlikely they'll use "asi" in any of them.These comments need to be in the foobar.body files, but do not need to bethe foobar.html file that the indexing engine assembles.</P><P>Including the ADB section number allows us to do some interesting things:</P><OL><LI><P>Indexer adds the document section number to the titles at the        top of the page, and picks up section title (not to be confused        with the name of the document it's processing);</P><LI><P>New documents submitted via anonymous ftp could remain in a        holding tank until authorized webmaster's apprentice tells a        script to add it to the <a href="/adb/outline.html">Artemis DataBook</a>.  That script could        parse the docsection to determine the correct destination        directory, move the file there, add the new filename and asidocname        to the list of active documents in that directory, and tell the        indexer that it just added a new document.</P></OL><P>This means the guys maintaining thedocuments only need to worry about making the actual document content work.If we decide to change the style of headers and footers, they'll changeconsistently throughout the whole web site.</P><P>Also, if the *.body documents contained a 50 word abstract of thedocument, it wold allow us far more flexibility in file lists, searchengines, and updates on the <a href="/adb/outline.html">Artemis DataBook</a>, like the <a href="/whatsnew.html">whatsnew.html</a> file.</P><P>It also makes it easy for someone to submit a new document -- justanonymous ftp it to a holding tank, and then the <ahref="/adb/09/overview.html">ECTC</a> webbers take over.That gives us the same control as the sysops do on <ahref="/adb/09/06/01/">GEnie</a>.  If thewebmaster's apprentice isn't sure, he'll know the section boss for thatpart of the Data Book, and can easily ask if the document should be added(or updated) by emailing a URL pointing to the file in the holding tank.</P><P>To make it really easy to get data into the web, the script might evencheck to see if the *.body file contains html tags.  If not, it couldassume it's plain text and automatically surround it with<TT>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</TT>.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Server Time</H3><P>Perhaps instead of having a cgi script that runsevery time someone accesses a URL, it would be better to have a script thatbuilds the html file and updates the indexes when things change:</P><OL><LI><P>When a document is added or changed, update indexes from that        point on up the directory tree.</P><LI><P>When a person's address changes, scan the whole site for        references; or just rebuild all the pages and indexes.</P></OL><P>The idea here is to reduce server-side processing time.  There's noneed to assemble a page each time it's delivered, if that page will onlychange once a year.  At the cost of a few KB to store duplicate copies ofthe Nav Bar all over the site, we can eliminate the need for processingevery page with a script.</P><P>The tricky part will be making the pages maintainable.  We might want tosplit it out so that each html document has three parts: header, footer,and body.  The body is the part maintained by humans, while the header andfooter are maintained by machine.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>An Example</H3><P>In file dihydrogen-monoxide-acquisition.body we have the following code:</P><PRE>     &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:&lt;asilookupemailaddress="hillclimber.john"&gt;&gt;     &lt;asilookup nickname="hillclimber.jack"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;     and     &lt;a href="mailto:&lt;asilookup emailaddress="hillclimber.gillian"&gt;&gt;     &lt;asilookup nickname="hillclimber.jill"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;     went up the hill to fetch a pail of water.&lt;/p&gt;</PRE><P>Now, the script that's building dihydrogen-oxide-acquisition.bodyknows to watch out for <TT><NOBR>"&lt;asilookup ...&gt;"</NOBR></TT> tags.It also knows that thestandard format for files in the personnel directory is:</P><PRE>                        Jack's file              Jill's file       Item             hillclimber.john.data    hillclimber.gillian.data       ------------     ---------------------    ------------------------       filename         hillclimber.john         hillclimber.gillian       formalname       John Q.

It outputs file dihydrogen-monoxide-acquisition.htmlcontaining the following code:</P><PRE>     &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:jack@waterfall.net&gt;     Jack&lt;/a&gt;     and     &lt;a href="mailto:gillian@bucket.com&gt;     Jill&lt;/a&gt;     went up the hill to fetch a pail of water.&lt;/p&gt;</PRE><P>When this is read by a browser it comes out with the "mailto" linksembedded in the displayed text, thus:</P><PRE>     <a href="mailto:jack@waterfall.net">Jack</a> and <ahref="mailto:gillian@bucket.com">Jill</a> went up the hill to fetch a pailof water.     ----     ----</PRE><P>If we wanted to add a link to Jack's biography and also the full textof Jack's email address, we'd look up the address twice, thusly:</P><PRE>     &lt;p&gt;This page is maintained by     &lt;a href="/bios/hillclimber.john.html&gt;     &lt;asilookup formalname="hillclimber.john"&gt;     &lt;/a&gt;     &lt;a href="mailto:&lt;asilookup emailaddress="hillclimber.jack"&gt;&gt;     & lt;&lt;asilookup emailaddress="hillclimber.jack"&gt;& gt;     &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p>&gt;</PRE><P>The page-builder would output:</P><PRE>     &lt;p&gt;This page is maintained by     &lt;a href="/bios/hillclimber.john.html&gt;     John Q. Hillclimber     &lt;/a&gt;     &lt;a href="mailto:jack@waterfall.net&gt;     & lt;jack@waterfall.net& gt;     &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</PRE><P>So the browser would display:</P><PRE>     This page is maintained by <a href="">John Q.

He has his own ISDN line at home, and wantsto move to the moon in a few years.  He loves to do this web stuff, sohelping with the ASI web site is his main hobby.  He's such a ubiquitouspresence throughout the web site that he's the designated maintainer of acouple of hundred pages.  (He can keep up with that because once they'redeveloped most of the pages don't change very often.)  Of course Jack isalso actively involved in designing life support systems and long-rangeplanning for the lunar community's water works.  (He is particularlyinterested in personnel safety.)</P><P>The trouble is, Jack's email address changed when he had thatindustrial accident; had to shift to an ISP instead of using his companyaddress.  Then his ISP went bankrupt, so he started his own ISP company(Waterfall.net), and his email address changed again.</P><P>The good news is that since someone spent a few hours coding up thescript that builds the *.html files and handles the "asilookup" tags, weonly had to update Jack's email address in one place, and then run thescript to rebuild the *.html files.  That saved thousands of hours, whichotherwise would have been invested in manually updating all those emaillinks in all the files Jack maintains and then finding all the bugsintroduced by human error.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>A Step Farther</H3><P>Another time-saving possibility is to establish a standard format forreferring to a person and have the html-builder insert all the stuff weneed whenver we refer to a person.  That would include the person's name,nickname, a link to the personal bio page, and a mailto reference.</P><P>For instance, suppose someone wanted to include a reference to ahypothetical person called "Greg Bennett".  Inthis specific application, the output we want is ...</P><PRE>     Director, Office of Space Flight         <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory Bennett</a> (Greg)&lt;<a href="mailto:grb@asi.org">grb@asi.org</a>&gt;         ---------------          -----------</PRE><P>The "Gregory Bennett" link points to <ahref="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">/bios/bennett.gregory.html</a>.  Theother one is obviously a mailto link.  The nickname, in parenthesis, isinserted so folks know what to call Greg in a personal greeting.  (Thatknowledge really enhances communication, like name tags at a convention.)</P><P>To make this happen, in the *.body file, the html writer would just usea flag in the "asilookup" tag to tell the html-builder routine to include afull personal reference.  So, in the *.body file, the code would look likethis:</P><PRE>     &lt;ul&gt;       &lt;li&gt;Director, Office of Space Flight       &lt;ul&gt;          &lt;li&gt;&lt;asilookup personal-ref="bennett.gregory"&gt;       &lt;/ul&gt;     &lt;/ul&gt;</PRE><P>When it sees that "asilookup" tag, the html-builder goes out and grabsthe formal name, nickname, and email address from file/personnel/bennett.gregory and assembles the data in a standard outputformat for a personal reference.</P><P>Note that text formatting -- paragraphs, indentations, text style --are the responsibility of the person coding up the *.body file.  All we'reproviding here is a standard-format personal reference.  The html-builderprogram doesn't care if it finds the asilookup tag in the middle of aparagraph, in a table, or even hiding in the footer.  (There will be lotsof these in footers, in small type.  The html-builder program itself canuse this block of code for standard personal reference.)</P><P>We'll probably still want to be able to look up invidual items likenames, email address, and so on, but a single specification that outputs apersonal reference in a standard format will make life lots easier as timegoes on.</P><P>The idea of including a nickname came from lots of companies who use the convention of putting a nickname inparentheses on badges, so we can file the serial numbers off and claim thatconvention as our own.  The html-builder would check to see if nickname =firstname when it grabs the data from the /personnel directory, and insertthe nickname in parentheses if they're not the same.</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Strategic thinking</H3><P>If the <a href="/adb/09/overview.html">ECTC</a> can set this up, it will makemaintaining the pages that contain any list of people's names much easier.As we get the <a href="/adb/06/03/">organization charts</a> on-line, we'llhave lots of lists ofnames in each committee and organizational element.</P><P>The personnel directory files don't have to be people, either.  Wecould include <a href="/adb/10/">companies</a>, <ahref="/adb/08/">organizations</a>, and <a href="/adb/09/03/">mailinglists</a> as well.  Theimportant thing is to be able to write one of those *.body files knowingthe html builder will look up the most current data.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><P><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Fri, Mar 8, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

href="/adb/09/03/">mail lists</a>.  It is now up to each
region, net, or even individual board to provide such a gateway.  (I had my
gateway up and running before this happened, though, primarily for reasons of
convenience and vanity.)</P>

<P>So, here's how my setup works.</P>

<P>The key ingredients, beyond those required for the BBS itself, are:</P>

<ul type=circle>
<LI>a UUCP account,
<LI>a UUCICO package
<LI>a UUCP-to-Fido gateway package
</ul>

<P>UUCP = Unix-to-Unix Copy Protocol; a protocol used to copy files between Unix
machines. Some Internet Providers offer such accounts, but most don't. The
UUCICO package is software that will execute UUCP between a PC and a Unix host
over a modem connection.  The UUCP-to-Fido gateway is software that converts
files from UUCP format to one recognized by the Fido BBS software.</P>

<P>So, at predefined times during the day, my BBS polls my UUCP provider to
exchange mail and newsgroup packets as follows:</P>

<ul tpye=square>
<LI>BBS calls provider with UUCICO program.
<LI>UUCICO handles logon protocol to establish a UUCP session.
<LI>UUCICO uploads mail and newgroup packets from BBS users.
<LI>UUCICO downloads mail and newsgroup packets from Internet.
<LI>UUCICO logs off and closes connection.
<LI>Gateway program reads through UUCP files downloaded by UUCICO and translates
the headers from Internet ro Fidonet format.  One of the Gateway's
configuration files tells it how to map newsgroups to Fido echoes.  Mail is
targeted to the Fido Netmail area.
<LI>Normal Fido BBS processing now ensues.  My Fido mail tosser reads the
packets
converted by the Gateway and tosses them into the appropriate echoes on the BBS
and reworks the message links.</ul>

<P>Part of the "magic" involved in the Gateway's operation is my having assigned
it a fake Fido address and having told the Fido tosser that mail and echoes
destined for the Internet should be sent to that fake address.  This serves to
separate the Internet bound items from the normal Fido items.</P>

<P>Whenever a user posts to one of the echoes that is gated to the Internet, the
following happens:</P>
<ul type=square>
<LI>Normal Fido processing: the Fido tosser tosses the posts to the area
that the
Fido mailer has set up for traffic to the fake address.
<LI>The Gateway is run to convert the packets for the fake Fido address
into UUCP
packets.
<LI>The next time the BBS run the UUCICO, the waiting files are uploaded to the
UUCP provider.
</UL>
<P>Mail lists follow the same basic scheme.  One of the Gateway's configuration
files defines how to map mail to echoes:  Incoming mail addressed to X goes to
echo Y; posts in echo Y are mailed to Z. I choose a unique X for each mail list
I want to gate and subscribe to the mail list using that username.  Z is the
same address any "normal" subscriber would use: for a public mail list, the
mail list "machine"; for a private mail list, the moderator.  It also helps that
I have my own domain registered and DNS for it provided by my UUCP provider
(but I don't think this is absolutely necessary).</P>

<P>And, of course, once I have a mail list or newsgroup gated into a Fido echo, I
can use the standard Fido protocols to exchange the echo with other Fido BBSs.
When their users post updates to their copies of the echo, those posts would be
sent to my BBS and from there gated out to the Internet.</P>

<P>I don't know how RIME works, but I would bet the major difference
between RIME
and Fido is the scheme for addressing nodes in the net.  So, a similar process
should work for RIME boards, provided someone has written a RIME-compatible
gateway package.</P>

<P>A side bonus with the particular gateway package I'm using is that it
includes
utilities that allow me to <I>host</I> a mail list from the BBS.  Users send
subscribe messages to a listserv address on my domain and then their posts are
echoed to the other subscribers <I>and</I> are available on the BBS for dial-up
callers.  I'm hosting a couple of mail lists for the local
<a href="/adb/07/local-chapters.html">Artemis chapter</a>.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Jim Nobles</I></P>
<P><HR><P>

<P>RIME is whole different animal than Fido.   All the messages (in
every conference or echo) go to <I>one</i> main RIME BBS and then are
sent out from there back to all the RIME nodes.  It's very Big Brotherish
in nature but it's useful because a lot of filtering is done (most were
designed from the beginning to be "family oriented" and a lot of crude
material is deleted before it reaches the nodes back down the line).
Most of the filtering (obscentity blocking) is done at the sender's home
node before the message ever leaves.   Of course, this is not the only way
to run a net.</P>

<P>RIME's organization causes its Internet email conference
to work like this:   One of the four hundred or so RIME channels
(conference) is named EMAIL.  You enter that conference on your
RIME BBS and type in an email message to send to someone on
the internet.   The first line of the TEXT of your message must be:</P>

<blockquote>TO: their.name@whereever.they.are</blockquote>

<P>Then when that BBS does its daily (or twice daily) mail run, all the
new mail in all the RIME conferences (including the messages in
the EMAIL channel) begin their journey to the main RIME BBS in
Maryland.   How long this takes is determined by how many hubs
all the messages get routed through before reaching the Main
RIME board.   Once they arrive there the TO: line in the text of
the message is deciphered and the message is routed on to the
internet addressed to the person listed. </P>

<P>There are some obvious disadvantages: This whole thing can
be very slow.   Depending on how may hubs your message is routed
through, it may take 5 or 6 DAYS for it to reach the internet. The hub also
makes two mail runs a day.  It calls the Main board at
3:00 a.m.and gets all the new mail.  The local server calls the hub
at 4:00 a.m., gets the new mail and deposits the outgoing mail.
At 5:00 a.m. the hub calls the Main board again and hands off all the new
outgoing mail.   Most RIME BBSs aren't so direct, however.</P>

<P>One major advantage - the cost is zero.  The BBS doesn't have to be
hooked up to the internet or contracted for a service.   This is fortunate
since most wouldn't be able to justify the cost while running a free BBS (as
many of them are).</P>

<P>The idea for bringing Artemis to WaterShip is very simple.  One would
subscribe to (probably) the Artemis Digest for starters, using an email
address on WaterShip.   The Digest will then be made into
a public bulletin.   Anyone wishing to send to the <a
href="/adb/09/03/artemis-list.html">Artemis-List</A> can edit
their reply and send it on the EMAIL channel.  Of course, it needs to be
made perfectly clear that any parts of the Digest not directly related to
the reply must be edited out when quoting.</P>

<P>
Basically, the term &quot;IRC client software&quot; simply refers
to the particular software package that enables your system to connect to and
use an IRC network. If you are not familiar with IRC, please see the <a
href="http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/altircfaq.txt">Alternative IRC FAQ
page</A>.
<BR><BR>Each piece of client software has several common features and
enable a user to :
<BR>
</P>
<OL type="A">
<LI>Connect to an existing IRC network
<LI>Chat with other IRC users by typing conversations on your computer
screen
<LI>Perform file transfers to other IRC users
</OL>
<P>Other common features are nickname changing, private (DCC) chat, and
others too numerous to mention here. Please see the <a
href="http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/altircfaq.txt">Alternative IRC FAQ</A>
page or your software's help files for further information.
<BR>
</P>
<P>
<b>Installation:</b><BR>
Each package installs differently, so no attempt will be made to list
these instructions on this page. PLEASE NOTE: installation and help  files are
available for each software package at the site listed. Please download both the
program itself and any help files along  with it! The system administrator of
ASI IRC cannot possibly keep up  with it all, so please be an informed user and
read your help files !

<h2 align=center>September 1996 ECTC IRC Meeting Transcript</h2>

On Sunday, September 1, 1996 at 7:00 pm EST the Artemis Electronic Communications Technical Committee held their first Internet Relay Chat (IRC) meeting.  The meeting was held on the ASI IRC server on atlantis.io.com using channel #ectc.  The meeting was attended by the following people:
<p>
Randall Severy (Severy)<br>
Tim Cadell (TimCadell)<br>
David Brummel (dbrummel)<br>
Candace Dicks (cdb-home)<br>
Brad Ackerman (Ackerman)<br>
<p>
The following is a transcript of the conversation that occurred during the meeting.  There were some occasional dropped network connections that disconnected some participants from time to time during the meeting.  References to the network disconnects and some personal conversation not related to the business of the meeting have been edited out of the transcript.
<p>
<b><i>Session Start: Sun Sep 01 18:31:33 1996</i></b>
<br><b><i>*** TimCadell (~tmp@206.149.221.68) has joined #ectc</i></b>
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Hey, I'm here.  You all there?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hi, Tim!
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Perfect timing.  I walked into the 
Internet Lounge here at World Con...
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> and it's the right time.
<br><b><i>*** dbrummel (me@dialup-01-001.houston.io.com) has joined #ectc</i></b>
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hi, David!
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Hi, David.
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Hi, Randall, Tim
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Welcome to our little gathering!
<br><b><i>*** cdb-home (~cdb@tam-fl1-14.ix.netcom.com) has joined #ectc</i></b>
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> This is Candace...I have a couple of 
questions about 3D mailing list  Should I ask 
now?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hi, Candace!
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Hi, Candace.  Nice to meet you.
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> I'm trying to figure out what the 3D 
Tech Comm mailing list name is supposed to be. 
Greg suggested art-biz-graphics?
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Tim..  I'd like to ask questions for a 
few min after the meeting.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Candace, that name sounds fine with me
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Great, Candace.  As long as they let me 
sit here.  I'm at the WorldCon and there's a 
one-hour limit, but unless they /kick me, that's 
great.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Officially, it's up to Greg to establish 
the list names and which section in the ADB they 
go in
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> About Help Desk Task #6, Randall...maybe 
you can stay too?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yep, I'm planning to stick around until 9 
pm EST
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> In any case, in the interests of keeping 
to the schedule, I had planned to spend the first 
fifteen minutes or so in welcoming everyone and 
making sure everyone knew their way around the 
IRC environment
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Does everyone here know everyone else?
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Randall, I'll need to be the mailing 
list person for the 3D til the end of 96, or 
Craig finds someone else. That's my limit for 
3D.
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> At least by reading email.  Hi, 
everyone.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, Candace, it's easy enough to change 
the ownership of a list
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> I *think* I've seen most of these names 
in .sigs :)
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Hi..This is Candace...I'm the Office of Space 
Flight Tech Council Administrator.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> If anyone doesn't know someone else, don't hesitate 
to ask!
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Did anyone have any trouble finding this place?
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Nope, just read my email.
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Not once I remembered the port number (a bit 
non-standard, that) :)
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> No trouble at all this time. It payed to be a 
little familiar from last weekend's artemis chat.
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> No more trouble than downloading an IRC client -- 
the public labs here don't have one installed.  (just typed 
in the URL to d/l one.)
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Kindof, I used that port because that's the one they 
used on DALnet for the BBC IRC conference
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Hmmm.  Strange, I too had to change the default in 
mIRC, wrong port.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I went back and forth between 6667 and 7000 and ended 
up with 7000 for that reason
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> 7000 does give us a bit more security from 
wandering strangers
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> If it makes extra work for people we might want to 
switch back to 6667 for future meetings
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hmm, good point, David, that's something to keep in 
mind
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Is everyone here comfortable with the IRC 
environment?  Any questions about it?
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Of course, you can always just close the meeting 
without invitations, right?  But 7000's fine with me.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yeah, if I had stayed Op I could have made this a 
private channel
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> My only problem was getting access to service 
provider itself...It took about 15 min to log in.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ouch!
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> comfy-cozy here
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Not a problem today.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, well, I'll give things another few minutes to see 
if anyone else shows up and then we'll get started
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, as it is now 15 minutes into the meeting, I guess 
it's time to get started
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I had hoped to have a few more people show up, but 
five isn't bad for our first time
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Ready.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I had planned to give an update on the ASI domain 
move at this point, but I think I covered most of that in 
recent posts to artemis-list
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Basically, the web site and mailing lists are back in 
operation
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> But the web site is on autopilot as it seems that 
Dana is the only one with permissions to update the files
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> With Dana away at Worldcon, we haven't been able to 
make much progress in that area
<br><i>* TimCadell chuckles</i>
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> I've had trouble with ssdgwy.mdc.com members being 
undeliverable for asi-osf-leads!!!
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> The mailing lists are running, but the new digest 
features are giving us some problems
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hmm, are those address with pound signs in them, 
Candace?
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> yes they have # signs
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yep, we ran into that with the board-list list as 
well
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Software doesn't like that?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> It seems that Majordomo treats everything after a # 
sign as a comment and strips off the rest of the address!
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Have you tried escaping the #?  Something like \#  
?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> We've tried everything we can think of to work around 
that and even the Majordomo expert at IO is baffled
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hmm, haven't tried \#, I'll give that a try later
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I've asked Greg to ask some folks at MDC because they 
all use # signs and they must have run into this before
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> It also hiccups on the & sign in Dave Anderson's 
email.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> But I haven't heard back from him yet on this issue
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> An "&" sign in an e-mail address?  I'm not surprised 
it hiccups!
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Is Majordomo a shell program?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, I'll look into that as well
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I believe Majordomo passes the addresses as 
parameters to sendmail
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> That may be why this is happening
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> I talked to greg once...It seems he never has 
problems when he is a work,  but I always have problems!
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Yup.  You should be able to escape them, even the 
'&'.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Majordomo itself is a Perl program, but lets other 
programs do most of the work
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Good idea, I'll try the shell escapes
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> You might have to try multiples.  I'm not sure at 
what point it'll apply the escapes.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ouch, that could be a pain because it often takes 
Majordomo several hours to respond to requests!
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> I tried escaping the & sign when we were on other 
server . It didn't work. Should I try again , or wait til 
you check it out.
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Randall -> Try sending different letters to 
different addresses; work the problem in paralle.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> The other server had a completely different mail 
program, so it probably would have handled it completely 
differently
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Ah ...O.K.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yep, I'll try that Tim, I have a test mailing list 
for just that purpose
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Candace, if you can give me the address, I'll test it 
out at the same time I work on the # sign problem
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> I'll email them to you right after meeting...that 
O.K?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yep, that's fine
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> So the remaining action items from the ASI domain 
move are:
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> 1) Fix the permissions on the web site (owner=Dana)
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> 2) Solve the problems with # and & characters in 
mailing list addresses (owner=Randall)
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> and 3) fix archive and digest issues with mailing 
lists (owner=Randal)
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Oh...the & problem. Here is the given address :  
anderson#d#dave_#l#gn&c#r#@ssdgwy.mdc.com    that is an l 
after dave_#
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Sheesh, they have complicated addresses at MDC!
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> You're kidding! Wow, what an address.
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Dave's *is* the worst.
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> McDonnell Douglas?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yep
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> Do they put the whole thing on business cards?
<br><i>* TimCadell chuckles.</i>
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I sometimes wonder the same thing!
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Actually, I've seen longer at Taco Bell, but 
still...  Oi.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I'm starting to see a lot of MDC people set up 
aliases that don't include the # signs
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Don't even get me started about my old UUCP 
addresses!
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Greg set up...or Randall did... an asi.org address 
for some of them. But since it still goes to MDC.....Well, 
you get the idea. It Poofs!
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> I remember.  Lots of bangs.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, unless there are any questions about the ASI 
domain move, let's move on to the status of ECTC projects
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yeah, I set up a couple of asi.org aliases for folks 
at MDC
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yep, Tim, at one point I think I had 5 or 6 bangs in 
my address!
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> O.K. I'm ready for next topic (grin)
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Since it's first on the list, we might as well start 
with Help Desk task #6 ;-)
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> what list?
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Top of the list, huh?  Where to begin.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Candace, I need to first apologize about not getting 
back to you earlier about the sample interview you put 
together
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> What's the URL for the list?
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> apology accepted.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> With the asi.org move and starting up this new 
company, those messages ended up at the bottom of the pile
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> The ECTC task list is at http://www.asi.org/adb/09/01/
ectc_tasks.html
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> One thing I've been hoping to do about that interview 
is to track down who first suggested it
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> It was suggested at Artemis '96 and I think it was 
either Nanci or Ian who first mentioned it
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Actually, David, you might remember, I think you were 
in on that discussion, if I remember correctly?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Whoever suggested it had some good ideas for the 
types of questions to ask
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Oh,  O.K. Did I come close?
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Remember what?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Well, not quite, and that was why I was trying to 
find out the original suggestions
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Your list was more of a general biographical and 
categorical list
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> David, were you around when either Nanci or Ian and I 
discussed the new volunteer interview pages?
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> I'll still volunteer to do the HTML of the pages.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> The ideas either Nanci or Ian proposed revolved 
around more of a real "interview" as opposed to 
"census-type" stuff
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> I read your pages, Candace.  Better HTML, or at 
least higher, than what I can write so far.
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Randall, sorry, can't recall too many specific 
discussions from that weekend (overload)
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Sure, Candace, you can do whatever parts of it you 
want!
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> So, the program would start somewhere and go 
different directions depending on answers?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Not really, since you can't easily change HTML forms 
dynamically as you go along
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Just send me the questions....and the flowchart.
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> If I understand the comments in earlier mail, the 
problem is the lack of a flowchart, yes?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> But after asking all of the questions, a CGI script 
would look up matches to those answers in a table somewhere 
and come up with recommendations for areas of the Artemis 
Project to volunteer
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I don't have the questions, Candace, that's part of 
the problem! ;-)
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> General ideas...I could work on wording.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Some of the suggestions I remember from Artemis '96 
were things like "what interests you about space?", "how 
much do you know about the Internet?"
<br><i>* Severy racks his memory trying to dredge up these things</i>
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> "How much time would you be interested in devoting to 
the Artemis Project?"
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Are they going to answer in English?  Tricky 
programming for a CGI script!
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Is it like Planetary Society Mailing?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> "Are you interested in leading a team of people?"  -- 
which might steer people to be a committee chair
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> No, Tim, what we had in mind was a multiple-choice 
answer
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> For some of the answers, there might be a multiple 
choice based on ranges
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Hmmm.  So each committee would submit something 
that described someone they'd want working with them...
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> and we'd make a program that steered people that 
match to the committees looking for them?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Something like that, Tim, I definitely did not expect 
a single person to come up with the entire list of questions
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> I can do Ranges....I've been learning
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> This would be a committee effort, with lots of people 
contributing suggested questions
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yep, Tim, based on the answers, some kind of table 
lookup would match people with a certain number of 
appropriate committees or other parts of the project
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> If someone expressed interest in some of the ASI 
headquarters stuff, the system would put them in touch with 
Boise, that kind of thing
<br><i>* TimCadell nods.</i>
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Candace, I guess the main thing I had in mind for the 
"leader" of this task was to coordinate a "group discussion" 
about what kinds of questions should be on this interview
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> How about a time-sensitive question to the Artemis 
digest....requesting questions be sent to someone.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> It might be best to use both the asi-ecomm list and 
the asi-osf-leads list since we need the perspective of all 
of the committees
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I don't think the submissions of questions should be 
private, sending them to the whole list could spark other 
ideas by other people
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> There is a lot of good feedback involved in a "group 
think" atmosphere on an active mailing list
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Just look at the art-biz list right now, for example!
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> I'll take care of recieving Q&A from asi-osf-leads.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, I guess I had in mind that you would put together 
an official request message that outline what we are looking 
for and some suggested ideas
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> And you would collect response and suggest other 
ideas as the discussion went on (basically to keep the 
discussion going) until we reach some kind of consensus on 
the right set of questions
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> So a time limited discussion....say one 
month....like we did for ASI Homepage?  (I'll list the 
questions you've already given here as prompts.)
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> You may want to drop a note to Nanci and Ian to see 
if they remember anything about this area that could help in 
the discussion
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yep, one month sounds about right, we don't to drag 
it on for many months
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> don't to = don't want to
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> I'll do that...I've got lots more time than most of 
you folks.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> You got *that* right!
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> I just take alot of cat naps ;>)
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, are we finished with the Help Desk section?
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Fine for me, so far.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, moving on to the Mailing List section
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Only problem I see is the cross-reference table, 
should we talk private about that?
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Basically, the table that controls the routing of 
answers?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> My thoughts were that we wouldn't even *start* 
thinking about the cross-reference table until we get a set 
of questions identified and approved
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Fine by me...anything I could read up on to help 
me?
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Well, why not work in parallel?  The questions 
shouldn't control the shape of the table too much...
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Once we have the questions set, we can then go 
through them and map out how they would end up directing 
people
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Tim - Huh?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hmm, I'm not sure I follow, Tim
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Sorry, I got interrupted a little here.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> The table would be a simple cross-reference between 
every possible answer and parts of the Artemis Project to 
volunteer for
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Until we know the possible answers it would be a 
little difficult to set up the table!
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> That works.
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Well, setting up the actual table, yes, but not 
the design of the table and a program to handle the data.
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> ("simple" he says...)
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Maybe with a few dummy questions to test with.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> True, now I see what you are getting at, Tim
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yeah, it would make sense to start working on the 
mechanics of how the table would work
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Yea...so I can learn/help once my part is done.
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> I was envisioning just a score system.  Whatever 
committee's questions score highest, the "answerer" would 
be pointed that way.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I'm not sure it would be that simple, unfortunately
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> But maybe not.  It will need talking, but maybe 
during the private time.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I can imagine many of the questions might direct 
people to different committees depending on the answers
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Why should there be only one answer?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> There wouldn't likely be a one-to-one mapping between 
each question and a specific committee
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Right.
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Food break! Back in a moment...gotta grab another 
sandwich.
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Let's say you asked this question:
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I don't think we'll really know exactly how that will 
all work out until we get the questions figured out
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Bring me one, too! :)
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> "Do you like leading other people?"
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Me too!
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> For one committee, yes would be a high answer, for 
another a low answer.
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Ham/cheese? Liverwurst or chicken?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hmm, that question wouldn't be tied to a specific 
committee, in my opinion
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> A high score over all would point towards one 
committee, but there would also need to be prerequisites.
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Right, I was just throwing one out.
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Let'
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Sorry got carried away,  Off-topic.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> If I were coding the script, I would have that 
question set a flag that recommended someone for the chair 
of whatever committee(s) the other questions pointed them to
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Let's say "Liverwurst" points you towards ECTC.
<br><i>* Severy grins</i>
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> That's the idea, Randall.
<br><i>* dbrummel shudders</i>
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> I think the trick is making it able to be easily 
modified when we figure out what questions work better.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> But other questions might have one answer that would 
point them towards the ECTC and a different answer might 
point them towards the Moonbase committee
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> The implementation of this scheme would be very 
intricate.  MSQL, mabye?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I think it depends on the preferences of whoever 
builds the script, Brad
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Someone with a lot of Perl experience could probably 
code it up in Perl using flat files pretty easily
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Since I don't know Perl very well I would probably 
use something like mSQL
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> I, however...don't know a *thing* about SQL
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Do you know much about Perl?
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Yeah, well.  I don't know if it's that or 
somewhere else.  They have 4 ISDN connections here.  
256Kbits.
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> I program stuff for my own projects in Perl.  Not 
Perl 5 yet, though.
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> Three DS3 connections here -- 135 Mbits.
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> yeah, but this is free!
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> I've got a book on it -- will have to learn perl 
one of these days.
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Randall -> Why did you ask about Perl?
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> I've got a book called "Oracle the complete 
reference" and another book called Perl 5. What should I 
look up? I haven't read either yet.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> We were talking about how to code up the table 
processing, Tim
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Memory refreshed.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Brad mentioned mSQL, and I said it would depend on 
the preferences of whoever writes the program
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Candace, I guess you'll have to decide whether you 
want to write the table lookup piece or to find someone else 
to do it
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> <- has no preferences
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> My guess is to do it yourself will take a fair amount 
of time learning Perl
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> If that's something you are interested in doing, feel 
free, but it would be a significant amount of effort
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Programming is my life.  What do you need?
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> I can't do table lookup without help. However...I 
might be able to figure out Perl 5 given a few months. Are 
we in a hurry?
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> That's rhetorical, by the way.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Not any more than we are for anything else!
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Candace, did you say Perl 5 does SQL built in?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> If Tim wants to help out in the programming part, he 
might be able to handle the table processing while you 
concentrate on the interview and the HTML stuff
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> O.K. I'll let you know if I can figure it out 
...Tim, will you check my work as I learn?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I know there's a Perl interface for mSQL if you want 
to try that route
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Sure will, Candace.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> We will be using mSQL for the Web Management System 
and several other ASI systems, so it will be available on 
asi.org
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> SQL's not bad, you'll like it.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yeah, I'm just starting to learn it myself
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Anyway, have we wrapped up the discussion on the Help 
Desk stuff?
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Please point me to a good book for this Perl/SQL 
stuff.
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> I'm done now.
<br><i>* TimCadell nods.</i>
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> If there is more stuff we need to discuss on the 
volunteer system, why don't we do that after the rest of the 
meeting
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Candace agrees.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I'm worried some people here might need to leave 
soon, and I have to go over some other things that involve 
Brad
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Anyway, no one here but me is directly involved in 
the Mailing List tasks, and I think I summarized what needs 
to be done there in the Domain move status update
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> The same thing is mostly true for the Web Server 
section of the task list
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> If Dana or Nanci or Simon were here there would be 
some things to discuss in that area, but they're not, so we 
might as well move on
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Time to move on to "WWW Conversation Pages", Brad, 
are you still with us?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hmm, maybe we'll need to come back to that section
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Are you up to talking about the Web conversation 
pages, Brad?
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> Sure.  Haven't been doing much with that for a 
while, since we've been working on moving the server.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yep, that's been the case with a lot of things!
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> But now that the move is finished, we should be ready 
to get moving on that soon
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> There are a couple of key issues we need to resolve 
in that area to be able to get started
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> I need Brad's email for my personnel ASI email list 
I'm keeping (on paper) Please send later to cdb@ix.netcom.com
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Brad, I was about to talk about the web conversation 
pages when these disconnects occurred
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> There are two main issues we need to resolve to be 
able to move ahead with installing HyperNew
<br><i>* TimCadell laughs out loud.</i>
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> HyperNew = HyperNews
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> The first is accounts on IO
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> The sponsorship deal with IO for providing the 
asi.org domain only includes one IO login account, which is 
being used for maintaining the web site
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Any other accounts are either paid for by ASI or 
paid for by individuals
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> We are in the process of deciding which ECTC tasks 
absolutely require an individual IO account to accomplish 
that task
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> I've got an IO account, as does Greg...
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> We don't want to use "group" accounts that multiple 
people have access to, for security reasons
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yep, David, and so does Nanci, Dana, and now myself
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> From what I've seen of HyperNews, you need a login 
account to at least install the darn thing
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> There are several options to providing access to the 
asi.org site
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> The first, but most expensive, is to provide a 
dedicated account on IO for a specific task, such as the 
web conversation pages
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> That would be needed if we needed continuing login 
access to maintain the service
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> If login access is only needed when the service is 
first being set up, that could be handled by someone who 
already has an account, such as myself or Dana
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> If there is only occasional updates needed to files 
on the site, we could set up a web form to provide such 
access
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Either that, or a program on IO could poll 
another location every so often, looking for changes.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> So, the key question to decide on for HyperNews is: 
how much effort is involved in installing it on IO and what 
kind of access is needed to maintain it
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Tim, we're already doing web pages that upload files 
to the site as part of the Web Management System I'm 
building, so that would probably be the simplest approach
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Okay.
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Randall, what features does HypreNews give us?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> But that approach wouldn't handle compiling programs 
or other such things that would need login access
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> HyperNews handles most of the features we need in a 
web conversation system
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Including interfaces to mailing lists in the latest 
version
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Brad, I need you to figure out what kind of access 
to asi.org is needed to install and maintain HyperNews
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> The key question in my mind is how much customizing 
we would need to do to it to implement a bi-directional 
interface to our mailing lists
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> Gotcha.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, the second issue is likely to fall in my lap, 
but with some help from you, Brad
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> The second issue involves how the interfaces to the 
mailing lists work
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> The mailing lists on IO are run on a separate 
machine that we don't have direct access to right now
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> We are still planning on feeding the mailling 
lists into/outof the newsgroups, yes?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Since HyperNews didn't have a built-in interface to 
mailing lists when I last installed it, I don't know 
anything about how they implemented that
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I need you to investigate how HyperNews implements 
such an interface
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> And then based on that info, I need to find out how 
we would support that interface in the mailing list 
environment on IO
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yes, David, newsgroups is the next section in the 
task list, we'll talk about that in a minute
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Any questions, Brad?
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> I'll look into it.  There should be a way to do 
that part without an account...
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> No questions for now.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, don't hesitate to ask when you run into 
something you have questions about
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> Hopefully I'll be able to settle down in one of 
Cornell's Unix labs tommorow -- that should help me get 
straightened out while I'm waiting for my monitor to come 
back from being serviced.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I'd like to identify the issues we need to resolve 
with IO as soon as possible, since they are still actively 
supporting us in finishing the move
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, are we ready to move on to newsgroups?
<br><i>* TimCadell nods.</i>
<br><i>* Ackerman nods</i>
<br><i>* dbrummel nods</i>
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, with the completion of the asi.org move, we are 
also ready to move forward on setting up the Artemis 
newsgroups
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> To your question, David, we have always planned on 
linking them directly to the mailing lists
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> As we are doing with every part of the ecomm 
architecture, since having separate discussions would ruin 
the whole idea of what we're trying to put together
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Just checking that that hadn't changed
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> As all of you may have heard, Dale Amon had been 
looking into designing and setting up the newsgroups
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> But he's been so tied up with his new venture over 
there that he hasn't made any progress in almost 8 months 
now
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> There are questions of propagaation and hierarchy 
to be answered.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yeah, we need to talk to IO about exactly what type 
of environment they are willing to provide for us
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> And I was planning on doing that in the next week or 
so
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I think we had settled on the "artemis.*" hierarchy 
in the original discussions back in January
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Sounds reasonable.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> But the issues of propogation still remain
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> David, how much do you know about newsgroups?
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> At least, if I translate as "What's up?"
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Randall, from the Unix side - nada
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I think we had settled on the "artemis.*" hiearchy 
way back in January
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> I've set up a news connection, but it was about 8 
years ago.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> But the issues of propogation still need to be 
resolved, and that's one area of news I know nothing about
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I'll bug Dale once again, but if he can't get to it 
anytime soon, is there anyone here who would be willing to 
look into the newsgroups area?
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Randall, what issues are those?  Propogation 
between the newsgroups and the maillists?
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> I could check that, if you wish.
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> I'm leaving....too many losses of channel! Looks 
like 4 max on channel. Bye for now.
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Bye, Candace.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Bye, Candace!
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> 'night, candace
<br><b><i>*** cdb-home has quit IRC (Leaving)</i></b>
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Anyway, I think the issues involving newsgroups are 
as follows:
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> 1) IO would probably take care of setting up the 
newsgroups for us, but I need to check with them on what 
they can and can not do in that area
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> 2) We need to figure out how widely we want to 
propogate the newsgroups and how things are configured to 
make that happen
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> 3) Majordomo supports an interface between mailing 
lists and newsgroups called "newsgate".  I have that 
software, but we need to figure out what interfaces are 
needed to both the mailing lists and the newsgroups to make 
that happen
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I'm sure there are other issues, but that's all I 
can think of for the moment
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Anyone here able to tackle any of those?
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Hmmm...
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> I can research propogation, if you like.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> That would help a lot, Tim, as that's the one area I 
don't know anything about!
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> I think there are only two options there, local to 
IO or global to the world.
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Writing this down.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I had a feeling it was something like that, David
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> If this is going to be worthwhile, it would have 
to be global.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> That's true, I guess one of the questions I'll have 
to ask IO is whether they would support propogating the 
Artemis newsgroups to the world
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> I don't think there's anything about that that 
they wouldn't want to do.  It's pretty normal.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I hope so, but we've already running into some 
"normal" things that they are strangely reluctant to do
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> You have propogation questions about particular 
articles, but newsgroups themselves are global or very 
local.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Another big issue we need to think about is private 
vs. public lists
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Well, but they don't really host a newsgroup, you 
just need someone to send out the command the create the 
group.
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> Question:  do we need to get other systems to 
explicitly carry a new hierarchy?
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Then, you need to convince other services (like 
CTS that I use) to carry those newsgroups.
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Some services automatically add newsgroups they 
find, but others don't.
<br><i>* TimCadell shuts up.</i>
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> <grin>
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yeah, from browsing IO's news server, it looks like 
they automatically carry *every* newsgroup
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Tim, but they *will* be hosting the groups, just 
like they host (some of) the io.* hierarchy (others of 
which are hosted by io.org, and ISP in Canada).
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, there are obviously a lot of issues about 
newsgroups that we aren't likely to resolve tonight
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Randall, no, they don't.  E.g., the claris groups, 
which cost $$.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I think we have enough things to start working on 
and we'll review where we stand this time next month
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> True, David, I had forgotten about those groups
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Okay, I'll look into propogation.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> We probably should move on to the rest of the tasks 
as I would like to wrap things up by the end of the hour
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Which hour?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Next task section is Online Services
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Just kidding.
<br><i>* Severy grins</i>
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> My guess is there isn't much to discuss here about 
online services
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Most of them seem to be dying off and no one here 
other than myself is involved in those tasks
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Ah, those services.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> So, let's move on to Bulletin Boards
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> AOL's *routers* are dying off... 
<br><i>* Severy laughes</i>
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Randall,  all the services worth spit give users 
full inet access, so I don't see any need for special 
areas on them.
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> A lot of BBS's are doing that, too, aren't they?
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> But many have active space discussion forums 
anyhow.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yeah, there are still some efforts to post Artemis 
material in specific places, but the efforts to establish 
links with the mailing lists have definitely faded away
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Tim, those that can afford a full-time connection. 
(which I can't :(  )
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> The mailing list link to GEnie is about to die when 
my GEnie account gets cancelled
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> David, any news to report on the BBS front?
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Well, for just newsgroups, you could supply a 
partial connection without full-time, couldn't you?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> You had some questions a few months back about UUCP 
connections, are there still issues there?
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Tim, yes, but I can't support much traffic.
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Randall, last I talked with IO, they were 
unwilling to setup UUCP due to lack of demand.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hmm, sounds like IO!
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Hmmm...
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> I have been investigating other means of gating 
news into my BBS and have found acouple of ways to do this 
over a PPP link.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Are you still doing your link part-time?
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> NNTP.
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> I'm gating mail via my UUCP link w/Holonet and 
news via PPP from IO
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Should work.  I've read news that way, once with 
a Perl script.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> How is that working, David?
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Holonet still serves my domain, so they will 
continue to do my mail until I move the domain elsewhere.
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> News I'm bringing down with a pgm called souper, 
and have other s/w which can gate it into the BBS.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, David, are there any issues that need resolved 
or any action items left around?
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> I need to get going.  They need the computer I'm 
on.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Oops, can we wrap this up quickly?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> How much time do you have left, Tim?
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> About a minute, i told him.
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> The only issues for me are 1) how much traffic 
will there be and 2) how much interest from Fido?
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> They have a line.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I can imagine, Tim!
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> It's not long, but it's impatient.  And they've 
been very nice to setup this free service.  20 computers 
over ISDN.
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> Lines have been on and off here, but I haven't 
drawn much attention.  (Lines a mile long in the cafeteria 
upstairs. :( )
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, when you next get a chance, I'd be interested in 
any feedback you have on this meeting
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> So far, I haven't found any Fido echoes where we 
might troll for interest :(
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> i.e., what worked and what didn't work, and 
suggestings for improving future meetings
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> Randall -> Okay, otherwise, I consider it pretty 
good excepting IRC's problems.
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> You got it.
<br><b>&lt;TimCadell&gt;</b> See you all later!
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yeah, I'll drop IO a line about the disconnections 
and see if they know anything about them
<br><i>* Severy waves goodbye to Tim</i>
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> Same opinions as Tim.
<br><b><i>*** TimCadell has quit IRC (Leaving)</i></b>
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> David, what do you mean by that?
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Randall, mean by which?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> By not finding any Fido echos
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Is there no interest in propogating the Artemis 
mailing lists through Fido?
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Ah.  Last I checked the Fido echo list, there did 
not seem to be any echoes on space-ralted topics, other 
than specific sci-fi echoes (Trek, Star Wars, et al).
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hmm, is it worth proposing an Artemis echo?
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> I've never had *any* inquiries about picking up 
the maillists.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hmm, do other people even know about them?
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> If there aren't any space echoes, then how about 
starting SPACE?
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> We'd need to generate enough interest to get 
several Fido regions to request an echo, after having a 
thriving echo in the local region.
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> It might be doen, but more and more people are 
moving to the i'net...
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I was wondering about that aspect of it...
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, in the interest of wrapping this meeting up, 
let's move on to the next section
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> The local region has been bleeding nodes like a 
major artery had been cut.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Which is, appropriately enough, "Real-time Meetings"
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Brad, how much have you been helping Brian with the 
IRC stuff?
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> We haven't gotten together in a few weeks -- he 
pretty much took care of the IRC procedure guide.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, we've definitely made a lot of progress on the 
IRC stuff this month!
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I think the next phase there is to refine the 
procedure guide based on the experiences we are starting to 
have, both with the BBC IRC conference and this meeting
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> We may want to start investigating a few related 
things
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> The subject of web interfaces to IRC came up in the 
BBC conference
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> It might be worth exploring setting up a web page on 
the ASI site that allows people to participate in these 
meetings
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Since some people might have trouble setting up an 
IRC client
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> There are also non-IRC chat servers that we might 
want to investigate
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Especially if the IRC environment remains as 
unstable as we've seen the two times we've used it
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Do you have a candidate list?
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> The best way to interface WWW with IRC would 
probably be a Java-based IRC client.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Nope, I printed some web pages on some when I 
stumbled on them months ago but they are buried under large 
piles of paper ;-)
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yeah, a Java applet version of an IRC client was 
mentioned in the BBC conference, I have a URL for one 
floating around here somewhere
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> If you find those pages, I could investigate some 
of the other chatware.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ahh, here it is:
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> http://webx.best.com/~kbs/irctst/jirc.html
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> For basic chat servers, I found most of them off the 
Yahoo "Chatting" pages
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> For basic chat servers, I found most of them off the 
Yahoo "Chatting" pages
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Go to Yahoo, select the Internet link and go into 
the "Chatting" area
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Gotcha
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> There is a subpage for IRC, but there is also a list 
of lots of other chat servers
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Most of them are commercial and so would cost too 
much for us, but there were a couple of freeware ones
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b>mel> OK.  I'll see what I can find out.  Due date?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Brad, would you be interested in investigating the 
Java client?
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> Sure.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hmm, I don't know, David, end of the month?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> We might want to use IRC some more to see how it 
works before we make any major moves towards something else
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> Esp. if we can get those netsplits down.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> But it would be worth experimenting with other 
options, if they look intriguing
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Agreed
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> Just make sure that whatever we do can be accessed 
via telnet.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hmm, many of the chat servers seemed to be 
web-based, so I have a feeling telnet wouldn't work
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Is telnet access an important requirement?
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> Web-based would probably be OK.  My primary 
concern is that the chat can be accessed without 
proprietary (and possibly platform-specific) software.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> That's true, we've seen enough platform arguments 
around here to know we can't stick with a single platform!
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Anyway, it sounds like we have enough to work on in 
this area, ready for the next section?
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Hey! I resemble that remark!  :)  :)
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> The last section is aptly named "Miscellaneous"
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> There's more?!?!?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I think the only item in that section that involves 
any of us is the credit card stuff
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Brad, I've been thinking a bit about that area in 
light of some of the recent discussions in the ASI board
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> There seems to be a general plan to leave the sales 
activities to LRC and leave ASI out of the sales business
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> If that's the case, I'm not sure there would be any 
use for a credit card ordering system for ASI
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> There definitely is such a need for LRC, so it's not 
like the work doesn't need to be done
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> But I'm thinking we may need to move those efforts 
under the LRC umbrella
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> I think IO just installed a secure server (check 
the IO Revealed page)
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Brad, you may want to contact Greg and Dana about 
this area
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I know that Dana was planning to look into credit 
card ordering stuff for the LRC catalog, so there's no 
reason to duplicate efforts in that area
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> David, yeah, I saw that note as well, I'm not sure 
how that will impact us
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> Agreed.  I'll have to get in touch with them.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I'll drop Greg a note as well to see what he things 
should be done in this area
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> things = thinks
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> And on that note, I believe we have finally finished 
the ECTC task list!
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> Credit card processing is one of the trickier 
bits, especially if we handle the whole arrangement 
ourselves.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yep, they are definitely going to have to figure all 
of that out for the LRC catalog, so they could probably use 
the help
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> So, any closing thoughts before we wrap up this 
meeting?
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> none here
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Are there ways in which this meeting should have 
been organized differently?
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> Probably off-topic, but I can't wait until this 
computer lab is upgraded to PowerPC. :)
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> So as to better adapt to the IRC environment?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> What's the lab running now?
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> Mac IIci's.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ouch, those probably seem pretty slow these days!
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> The RevRdist hard drive virginization takes 5-10 
minutes.
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Was the agenda posted on the Web?  I'm running 
Win95 right now, but my dobharchu.org e-mail is under OS/2 
and unaccessable. :(
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> The agenda was posted in an e-mail message yesterday
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I should have posted it earlier, and that's probably 
why the attendence wasn't larger
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Right.  And I can't get to it.  A copy on the Web 
would be nice.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I'll make sure I give more advance notice next time, 
things just got too busy the last few days...
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Good idea, I'll make sure future info is available 
on the web
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Speaking of the web, there was some discussion last 
week about making edited transcripts of these sessions 
available for those who couldn't make it
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Do either of you feel strongly either way about 
publishing what we've said here?
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> Were you able to log all of this through all the 
drops?
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> Nope -- what I've said is ok for publication.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yep, I believe so, I'll have to double-check but I 
have logging turned on automatically
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> I have no problems with posting this, assuming you 
got it all :)
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> and I think mIRC just appends to the log files
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> The multiple netsplits might merit some clipping.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, I should have made a public statement in the 
beginning about publishing a transcript
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> OK.  I just d/l'd mIRC this afternoon, so I 
haven't wrung out all the features, yet :)
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> and I'll have to remember that for next time, so I 
won't have to get permissions retroactively
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> So noted.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yeah, I'm going to edit out the netsplits and other 
chit-chat
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yep, I just checked the log file and everything's in 
there
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> kewl
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, anything else to discuss or are we all talked 
out?
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> my fingers are worn to nubs <g>
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> We've covered just about everything -- I've got 
about 20 minutes to grab dinner before the cafeteria 
closes.
<br><i>* Severy grins</i>
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> That's the best reason to wrap this up that I've 
heard so far!
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Well, it's been great talking to you both!
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> 'til next time...
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> And I'm looking forward to next month's meeting, 
hopefully we'll get more people here then
<br><b>&lt;Ackerman&gt;</b> aufwiedersehen...
<br><b>&lt;dbrummel&gt;</b> slan!
<br><i>* Severy waves goodbye to Brad and David</i>
<br><i>* Ackerman waves</i>
<br><i>* dbrummel ducks out the door, with a wave</i>
<br><b><i>*** Ackerman has quit IRC (So long, and thanks for all the 
fish.)</i></b>
<br><b><i>*** dbrummel has quit IRC (Leaving)</i></b>

<h2 align=center>October 1996 ECTC IRC Meeting Transcript</h2>

On Sunday, October 6, 1996 at 7:00 pm EST the Artemis Electronic Communications Technical Committee held their second Internet Relay Chat (IRC) meeting.  The meeting was held on the ASI IRC server on atlantis.io.com using channel #ectc.  The meeting was attended by the following people:
<p>
Randall Severy (Severy)<br>
Candace Dicks (cdb-home)<br>
Brad Ackerman (BradA)<br>
David Brummel (DavidB)<br>
Brian Cesar (Brian_C)<br>
<p>
The following is a transcript of the conversation that occurred during the meeting.  There were some occasional dropped network connections that disconnected some participants from time to time during the meeting.  References to the network disconnects and some personal conversation not related to the business of the meeting have been edited out of the transcript.

<b><i>Session Start: Sun Oct 06 19:00:11 1996</i></b>
<br><b><i>*** cdb-home (~cdb@206.214.117.80) has joined #ectc</i></b>
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> I got here after all!
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hi, Candace!
<br><b><i>*** BradA (bsa3@SBY10.CIT.CORNELL.EDU) has joined #ectc</i></b>
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hi, Brad!
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Hello again!
<br><i>* Severy waves to Candace</i>
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> `allo.
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Hiya
<br><b><i>*** DavidB (~dbrummel@dialup-01-012.houston.io.com) has joined #ectc</i></b>
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hi, David!
<br><b>&lt;DavidB&gt;</b> hello
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Hi
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> Hello DavidB, welcome to #ectc
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> I forgot to get in touch with Morris M. My netcom 
mailbox server hiccuped again.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Well, Morris received the announcement of this 
meeting, so he might show up
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Hope so.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Although so far it looks like just us regulars!
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> You said you were out of the email loop for a few 
days. Did ya see my "Artemis Convention Carole"?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yep, I saw your carole!
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Actually, I don't think I was out of the email loop, 
just that strange things are going on with the asi.org 
mailing lists
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I got a message from art-biz this afternoon, but 
that was the first message I saw from any of the asi.org 
lists since Thursday
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I sent out the announcement for this meeting to 
asi-ecomm three times and I never saw the message come back
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> That's why I ended up sending it individually to 
everyone subscribed to the asi-ecomm list
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Did any of you see any of the announcements to 
asi-ecomm, or did you only get the one message I sent to 
the individual addresses?
<br><b>&lt;DavidB&gt;</b> I only got the announcement you sent on Sat.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I was afraid of that, I'm starting to wonder if it 
was only the asi-ecomm list that is goofed up
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Only the one sent to individual members (sat) and 
the preview on Sept 29.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Did anyone here send any messages to any of the 
lists since this past Thursday?
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> I think only the individual member one got to me.
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> I'm checking my mailbox...be right back.
<br><b>&lt;DavidB&gt;</b> ecomm is the only asi.org list i'm on - nothing 
between thurs. & sat.
<br><b><i>*** Brian_C (~bcesar@dial-alb1-7.surfsouth.com) has joined #ectc</i></b>
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hi, Brian!
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Tried checking my mailbox...If I had mailing list 
postings, I deleted them. Hmmmm. P.S. Hi Brian.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Does anyone need introductions around here?
<br><b>&lt;Brian_C&gt;</b> good evening all! May be in&out... connecting on 
the sly from worw :)
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, I guess that's enough time to collect any late 
arrivals, I guess it's time to start...
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I think all of you know me, BradA is Brad Ackerman, 
Brian_C is Brian Cesar,...
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> cdb-home is Candace Dicks Bartleson, and DavidB is 
David Brummel
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Does everyone know their way around IRC?  Any 
initial questions on how this all works?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Since everyone here except Brian was here last 
month, Brian, let me give you a few warnings about what 
might happen
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Last month we had a recurring problem with dropped 
Internet connections that disconnected various people from 
time to time
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Yes I'm ok.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> So far tonight things look good
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> If I'm dropped, I'll lose the Op priveleges, but 
since this is a private meeting I'm not too worried about that
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> If anyone is dropped, just reconnect as soon as you 
can and we'll pick up where we left off
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> So, on that note, let's move on to the third item on 
the agenda: Review current project status
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Just like last month I'm a little tardy on finishing 
the monthly status report
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I promised myself I'd have it out before this 
meeting so I wouldn't have to waste time reviewing the current status
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> But as often happens, events did not quite work out 
that way...
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> So, starting with the first section of the ECTC task 
list: Help Desk
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I think the only task in that section that involves 
people here is the volunteer interview
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Candace, did I get a status report from you this 
month?
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> On that note...I'm waiting for Morris' submission 
of a page so I can do HTML for it. The short list was 
posted to asi-osf-leads mailing list...no responses. :>(
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> My status report was a little early this month, 
I'll resend if you need me to.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, yeah, I saw that list, and the lack of responses 
:-(
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Oh, that's right, you sent it a while ago, Ok, let 
me go back and dig it up
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Thanks for reminding me
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> What is Morris putting together?
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Ummmm...I'm not sure. I gave him the short list 
and put him in touch with Ian.
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> That's the last I heard. Should I do a status 
check?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, let's see how things go over the next few weeks
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> BTW sorry about the OSF mailing list "status 
report" fiasco.
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Is the webpage /adb/09/internet_use.html in need 
of updating?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Don't worry about it, Candace, those things will 
happen from time to time
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hmm, probably not, I'll take a look at it sometime
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> If there is some progress on the volunteer interview 
over the next few weeks...
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> We might want to make special arrangements to get 
the whole team for that task together in next month's meeting
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> And have a private session for that task
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, let's move on to ECTC task list section #2: 
Listserver Mailing Lists
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> As I think I'm the only one here involved in that 
section, there isn't much to talk about
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Still getting bounces from MDC.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> There are currently five new mailing lists in the 
works
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Mostly from OSF mailing list.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I'm waiting for list name confirmations for two of 
the lists from Greg
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> And I'm waiting for list setup information from 
three of them
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Are those bounces due to the # characters in their 
addresses?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I still haven't had a chance to try that stuff that 
we talked about last month
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I should be able to get to that within the next week
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> So far, it still happens. Whether or not I use the 
asi.org alternates for them
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hmm, so the asi.org aliases are also not working?
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Ok thanks.
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> I'll keep trying the aliases. If they ever 
work...you'll know the same day!
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, I'll work on the escape options and we'll get 
something figured out on those addresses in the near future
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Right toe :>)
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, moving on to task list section #3: Web Server
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Do web chat rooms belong in this discussion?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Other than updating web pages, I don't think anyone 
here besides myself is involved in that section
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Nope, there is the separate "Real-time meetings" 
section for that stuff
<br><b>&lt;DavidB&gt;</b> what ever happened to the site re-design?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I was afraid someone would ask that, David!
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I'm afraid we're back at square one on that one
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Greg was going to finalize the new home page, but he 
recently decided he didn't have enough time to do any of that
<br><b>&lt;Brian_C&gt;</b> Any news on the search engine?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> And asked that I find someone else to work on that
<br><b>&lt;DavidB&gt;</b> is there a summary somewhere of what had been agreed 
to re design (frames/no frames, level of graphics, flow, etc.)
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> We appeared to have reached a consensus on at least 
the overall style of the new page
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Based on a strawman page that I had put together 
(it's at http://www.asi.org/testhome/frontdoor.htm)
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Greg recently suggested that Duncan Delp take a 
crack at the new home page
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Duncan recently put together his own suggested home 
page for the ASI server and made it available on his site
<br><b>&lt;DavidB&gt;</b> do you have the url fro Duncan?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I'll try to revisit that whole area in the next few 
weeks
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> And we may need to have another round of discussion 
in the ECTC about that task
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Since Greg has basically delegated the task back to 
the ECTC to finish
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Here's the URL from Greg's recent message: 
http://www.duncangraphics.com/~lch/asi.html
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Brian, there hasn't been any recent news on the 
search engine
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Kaylon Daniels was researching possible search 
engines
<br><b>&lt;DavidB&gt;</b> if you can find a summary of the agreed to design 
points, i might give it a whack - i'm redesiging my own pages now.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> But the one he selected was more of a database 
development system and was a commercial product that ASI probably couldn't afford
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I replied to him that we needed something more like 
a generic search engine and that we would probably need a freeware product
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I haven't heard from him since, so I'm not sure 
what's happening
<br><b>&lt;Brian_C&gt;</b> just curious. was looking at one today, freeware 
engine, same enine the Excite database uses
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> David, let me reopen the issue in the ECTC and we 
can bring up all of those design points
<br><b>&lt;DavidB&gt;</b> ok
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I would certainly be interested in any comments you 
might have
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Brian, yep, I have seen references to the Excite 
engine as well, I think I mentioned that one to Kaylon at the time
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> Apparantly, www.duncangraphics.com doesn't exist.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hmm, I know his ISP had some DNS problems two weeks 
ago because I had the same problem
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> It's a new domain, so it not be cached everywhere yet
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> Definitely has problems.  athena.mit.edu, 
ns1.sprintlink.net and my own agree it doesn't exist.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> it not = it may not
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hmm, IO seems to be having trouble finding it as well
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I think his ISP is having problems yet again
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> You may want to just try it again in a few days
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> I'll try from netcom too!
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Brian, if you are looking into search engines 
yourself, feel free to post any results to the asi-ecomm list
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I'm not sure if Kaylon has given up on the task 
since I didn't agree with his first choice, so we could 
likely use some additional research into that area
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Any more questions about the Web Server section?
<br><b>&lt;Brian_C&gt;</b> Randall, do you have Kaylon's address handy ? I'd 
like to help with the search engine.
<br><b>&lt;Brian_C&gt;</b> I think we need one... been having problems finding 
stuff lately. :(
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hmm, that's strange, I can't find Kaylon in the 
asi-ecomm mailing list...
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Let me dig it up from my archives
<br><b>&lt;Brian_C&gt;</b> thanks.. sorry for the interruption.
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Do the OSF pages (being only listings of 
committees) need a search engine ability?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, try this one for Kaylon: canis1@delphi.com
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yep, there have been more and more comments recently 
about troubles finding things on the ASI web site
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I think the search engine will become very important 
rather soon
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Brian, I'll be happy to add you to that task on the 
task list ;-)
<br><b>&lt;Brian_C&gt;</b> ok. I have a hundred prelim questions, but will 
save for email later.
<br><b>&lt;DavidB&gt;</b> Any idea how much $$ we can spend on an engine?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I think ASI would prefer to spend $0, if at all 
possible
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> If I remember right, we have something like $400 in 
the bank, but that's probably changed with the recent membership renewals
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> But since at this point any money spent on the 
search engine is money that won't be available for other things
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> we need to make sure we can't use one of the 
freeware ones before we start looking at commercial products
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Thanks, Brian!
<br><b>&lt;Brian_C&gt;</b> that excite engine looks promising. I'll download a 
copy and try it out. Freeware :) gotta love it for the price !
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yep, I seem to remember it looked pretty impressive!
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> The two other freeware search engines I heard about 
before were Glimpse and HtGrep
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Glimpse has apparently been used in a lot of places, 
so it is probably worth looking at
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, let's move on to the next task list section: WWW 
Conversation Pages
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Brad, I guess you're the one here who is involved in 
that area
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> Yup.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I saw your status report on that task, what do you 
need to happen in that area?
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> Well, we need to decide if not being able to have 
threads work, we should stick with hn or go with something else.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I should have reread the transcript from last 
month's meeting, what did we decide was the next step?
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> Last meeting I was going to find out what the 
permissions requirements for HyperNews are. (in the report).
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> The issue with threading was the "In-Reply-To" 
headers?
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> Exactly.  Which not too many email programs generate.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I have a feeling that would be more important when 
we start dealing with newsgroup gateways
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> As threading is important in the newsgroup activity
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Can we live with unthreaded HyperNews sessions?
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> We could default the display to sort-by-subject.  It 
might get a bit unruly when people start replying via Hypernews, but nothing serious.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, let me check with Dana on the permissions issue 
(I believe he has access to the access.conf file)
<br><b>&lt;DavidB&gt;</b> maybe we should set up a test system and let the 
ECTC play with it for a while...
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yeah, David, that's definitely worth trying
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> Sounds like a good idea.  I've got Linux on my 
machine.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Well, we should be able to set it up on asi.org
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> That will give us a chance to work through the 
problems involved in getting it going there
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> So, basically testing it in place on the final 
destination.
<br><b>&lt;DavidB&gt;</b> unless Brad's gonna set up ppp accounts for us on 
his linux machine... :)
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Sure, we don't have to publicize it to the world 
until we are comfortable with the way it works
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> What I was just getting to -- my Mac isn't always in 
Linux.
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> But there shouldn't be any problems testing on 
asi.org.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, let me check on the what steps we need to do to 
get the software put on asi.org
<br><b>&lt;Brian_C&gt;</b> Good idea either way. Gives us a chance to work out 
the bugs. Maybe mirror the ectc posts through it?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ironically, I need to install HyperNews on a machine 
at work in the next few weeks anyway
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> !
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> So when I grab the latest version for that project, 
I'll stick it on asi.org as well
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Yep, we can use the asi-ecomm list as the first test 
bed for the direct email to HyperNews links
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> Brian:  That's the idea.  The HyperNews forums and 
mailing lists will have exactly the same messages -- just 
a difference in retrival method.
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Let me know when it's ready... and I'll help you 
test it out.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, Brad, I'll take the action item to get the HN 
software and put it on asi.org
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Once it's there, I'll let you know the URLs and you 
can go in and do the admin configuration stuff
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> Sounds like a good plan.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Brad, are the access.conf changes detailed in the 
installation instructions?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I don't remember having to change that file when I 
last set up HyperNews
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> But that was an older version, so things may have 
changed
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> Yes, the instructions are there for both access.conf 
and sendmail.cf.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Sendmail too?  Ouch, that's going to be painful, 
I'll have to see what IO can do in that area because I can 
guarantee we don't have access to IOs sendmail.cf file!
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, I'll look through those instructions sometime in 
the next few weeks
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> We need to give HyperNews an email alias so that we 
can subscribe it to the email lists.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, that part should be easy, we have a bunch of 
email aliases on IO already
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Are we ready to move on to the next section of the 
task list?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, on to the next section: Usenet newsgroups
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I don't think anyone here is involved in this area, 
so I don't think there's much to cover
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Tim Cadell was looking into some of the issues 
involved in setting up newsgroups
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> And Dale Amon has done some work in this area as 
well
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> But I think there is still some more research to do 
before we have any significant change in this area
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> So without any further ado, let's move on to the 
next section: Online Services
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Once again, there isn't much to report in this area
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Mark Styles has joined the ECTC and will be helping 
out on MSN
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> But he has reported that MSN is going through a 
major overhaul as it moves to a web based environment
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> So it's not likely that anything will happen 
regarding an Artemis presence there for a while
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> So, on that note, let's move on to: Bulletin Boards
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Anything new since last month, David?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I think you're the only one here involved in that 
task area
<br><b>&lt;DavidB&gt;</b> nothing new.  the local net in Fido is still 
bleeding nodes :(
<br><b>&lt;DavidB&gt;</b> in fact - it got a front page article in last 
sunday's business section
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> As Ivanova put it, "everything is going straight to 
Hell."
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hmm, from what you said last month, not much of that 
surprises me anymore
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> It sounds like Fido may not be around for very much 
longer
<br><b>&lt;Brian_C&gt;</b> our Fidonet in GA is disappearing as well... end of 
an age, I think.
<br><b>&lt;DavidB&gt;</b> yeah.  if there's ever any interest, i'm willing to 
help sysops set up access to the mail-lists or newsgroups, 
but i ain't holdin' my breath
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Oh well, I think both the Online Services and 
Bulletin Board connections of the electronic communications 
infrastructure will soon become rather archaic
<br><b>&lt;DavidB&gt;</b> kinda like the USPO :)
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, let's move on to the next section: Real-time 
Meetings
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Brian, you mentioned something a few weeks ago about 
updating the IRC guide
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> And Brad, it sounds like Java IRC clients are not 
quite ready for prime time
<br><b>&lt;Brian_C&gt;</b> correct. adding a few things pertaining to 
archiving meeting minutes, etc. Generally dressing it up 
and adding the little details.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, you saw my comments about the ECTC meeting 
times?
<br><b>&lt;Brian_C&gt;</b> must have missed that
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hmm, I mentioned adding a section to the guide that 
listed the planned times for meetings
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> The only one currently planned is the monthly ECTC 
meeting that seems to be settling in at 7pm EST on the 
first Sunday of every month
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> Well, let's just say the ones I've been able to try 
aren't there yet.  There are a few others left, but on www 
servers that haven't been responding.
<br><b>&lt;Brian_C&gt;</b> ah, memory returns :) it's already in the notes
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Give the success of the first two ECTC meetings, I'm 
thinking about rolling this out to the other ASI committees
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Give=Given
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> So I hope to see several ASI committees using IRC in 
the near future for regular or occasional meetings
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Brad, my guess is that's an area we'll just have to 
keep our eyes on
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Eventually, I expect we will see useable Java IRC 
clients, but it may be a little while
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Brian, just let me know when you have an update to 
the IRC web pages and I'll put them on the site
<br><b>&lt;Brian_C&gt;</b> will do.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, let's move on to the last section: Miscellaneous
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hmm, Brad, I think you're the only person doing 
anything in this section
<br><b>&lt;cdb-home&gt;</b> Bye...Talk to ya later Randall.
<br><b><i>*** cdb-home (~cdb@tam-fl8-16.ix.netcom.com) has left #ectc</i></b>
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Brad, anything to report on the credit card area?
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> Ouch -- still need to get in touch with Greg on that 
one.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, I don't think anyone else has done anything in 
that area so no one is waiting on you for anything specifically
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, I guess that wraps up the task list items
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Is there anything else that we didn't discuss that 
anyone wants to bring up?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> If not, are there any questions about the priorities 
of individual tasks?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Ok, I guess we can move into the wrapup phase
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Any suggestions on how to improve future IRC 
meetings? (besides getting rid of the netsplits!)
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I didn't exactly follow the official agenda, but I 
think we covered everything that needed to be covered
<br><b>&lt;DavidB&gt;</b> an action item summary at the end (or in the ecomm 
list shortly afterwards)
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Hmm, good point, I was just trying to remember what 
the action items were
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I figured I could go back through the transcript of 
this session to build that list
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Is it worth reviewing here, or should I just put 
something together and send to the ecomm list?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I'll try to get this transcript posted on the web 
site sooner than last months
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Since we got some good comments last time from 
people who weren't able to attend the meeting
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> On that note, do all of you give the permission to 
post your portion of the transcript on the web site?
<br><b><i>*** Brian_C has quit IRC (Leaving)</i></b>
<br><b>&lt;DavidB&gt;</b> could you also e-mail the transcript?
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Sure, e-mail to you privately or to the ecomm list?
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> Sure.
<br><b>&lt;DavidB&gt;</b> whichever.  you might ask the list if they're 
interested in it being posted there or if the web page is sufficient.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> If this transcript is like last month's, it's 
probably going to be pretty long
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Some people may not like seeing all of it on the 
mailing list, so I think it would be safer to just post it on the web site
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I'll send you a copy of the original, unedited, 
version in the next few days
<br><b>&lt;DavidB&gt;</b> ok
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Anything else, or are we finished for the evening?
<br><b>&lt;BradA&gt;</b> That's all, folks.
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> Thank you both for taking the time to join this 
meeting, I think it was very productive
<br><b>&lt;DavidB&gt;</b> 'til next month
<br><b>&lt;Severy&gt;</b> I look forward to talking to you again next month
<br><i>* Severy waves goodbye to Brad and David</i>
<br><b>&lt;DavidB&gt;</b> slan!
<br><i>* BradA waves</i>
<br><b><i>*** BradA has quit IRC (I have always been here...)</i></b>
<br><b><i>*** DavidB (dbrummel@dialup-01-012.houston.io.com) has left #ectc</i></b>
<br><b><i>Session Close: Sun Oct 06 21:00:55 1996</i></b>

<HTML><HEAD> <TITLE>4. Units of Measure</TITLE> </HEAD><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><!-- Artemis Data Book section 4. Reference Mission --><!-- file: /adb/04/units.html --><!-- Keywords: metric SI imperial british units measurement measureinternational units of measure flames are annoying --><h2 align="center">Artemis Data Book</H2><h2 align="center">4. Reference Mission</H2><h2 align="center">Units of Measure</H2><P><HR><P><P>    It's not a matter of U. S. chauvism, or any other pejoratives onemight apply in promoting the metric system; it's a matter of money.  Youshould work in whatever units you're comfortable with.  We mix units betweenthe two systems all the time, and once in a while make jokes about it inscience fiction stories.  For most applications, the whole issue wasovercome decades ago by the invention of the $3.00 four-functioncalculator.  But when it comes to writing certain chunks of software andacquiring certain bits of hardware, we're going to have to use Englishunits.</P><P>     Let's get real here.  We're not going to redesign and recertifyavionics just because the existing boxes happen to fit a rack built toround numbers of English units.  We're not going to custom-manufactureevery bolt to have metric threads and an English head.  We're not going torewrite, debug, and recertify ten million lines of code.</P><P>     If someone feels so strongly about the metric system that he iswilling to donate several billion dollars to the cause so that we canredesign and retool and reprogram the world's industrial base, then let'stalk about it.  If not, we'll put the whole issue on the shelf with all theother social engineering campaigns and get on with the space flightprogram.</P><P>     The most important issue about systems of units for the ArtemisProject is to establish the units we'll use to express length, force, mass,and so on.  We can list tables in both metric and English units, but wedefinitely do not want to have to list half a dozen different metricsystems.  For example, if we're going to talk about mass in metric units,let's use kilograms.  The beauty of the metric system is its consistency;its worst fault is the lack of consistency in how people use it.</P><P>     For instance, when engineers report pressure in the English system,they use pounds per square inch; but when you read reports from ESA, CSA,NASDA, and RSA you never know <I>what</I> you're going to get.  There's no wayto get a feel for the numbers.  It varies among groups within organizationswithin companies within agencies within countries.  What shall we use forpressure?  Pascals (newtons per square meter), or dynes per squarecentimeter, or BAR (which BAR?), or kilograms per square millimeter,atmospheres, or what?  The most useful measurement would be kg/m^2; itconverts directly to the units that matter for designing the system, eventhough talking about kilograms of force drives some folks crazy.</P><P>     When it comes to communication, our crew will be familiar enough withthe numbers and with each other that it doesn't matter.  They'll developtheir own language anyway.  Our job as reporters of these events is tocommunicate with and entertain our audience.  If we have to talk about thesize of a crater we'll tell them in whatever language they speak,regardless of what the government thinks, perhaps with a bit of foreignunits thrown in to maintain the exotic flavor of the adventure.</P><P>     None of this means we don't have sympathy for people who worship themetric system.  We've done time at that alter, too.  We used the metricsystem all through college, in every science course and in most engineeringcourses; everything we knew about science and engineering was calibrated inmetric units.  However, the day we graduated from college we were in for amajor learning experience.  In the real engineering world, where peopleactually make things instead of just doing theoretical calculations, theyuse the English sytem unless coerced by their government to use the metricsystem.</P><P>     Incidentally, the official U. S. government policy of forcing peopleto use the metric system ended with President Carter's administration.Ever since then it has been a matter of personal choice, except ongovernment contracts.  The social engineers still force us to spend a hugepotful of your money studying the question with every contract, but theanswer always comes out the same.</p><P>     Even with participation from the European Space Agency, the CanadianSpace Agency, the National Space Development Agency of Japan, and theRussians, we have not been able to identify any real advantage forswitching to the metric system.  The disadvantage is the horrendous cost.</P><P>     Footnote 1: "potful" is from the gregocentric system of units <FONTSIZE=2>[note: Content by Gregory Bennett]</FONT>, or GSU.One potful = 1 bag = 2 gadzillion = more than you can afford.</P><P>     Now, about that tempest in a teapot: actually, we're installinghardware designed in both systems into the International Space Station.Standard racks are measured in inches, but some of the fasteners aremetric.  For new hardware, computer-controlled milling machines don't givea flip, so we design it in the English system and label it in the metricsystem.  EVA bolts on the Japanese Experiment Module are metric-threadedbolts (because the Japanese government forces its industry to use metric)with 7/16-inch hex heads.  Custom- manufacturing all those bolts is pricey,but what the heck, the Japanese taxpayers won't know the difference.</P><P>     What we really need is for the General Conference on Weights andMeasures to give up their arrogant ways and just add all the units peopleuse to the International System of Units.</P><P>     All that said, I suspect that decades from now people will still stopoff for a pint at the Blue Earth Pub on their way home from a hard day'swork of putting up cubic whatevers of regolith; and they really won't worryabout whether it's an Imperial pint or a U. S. pint.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><P><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Fri, Mar 8, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

The spacecraft is carrying three instruments to    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the Earth's. The closest    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for    a Japanese spacecraft.</P><P>    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail    passages will be scheduled in some years hence.

US PLANETARY MISSIONS


    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)

    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed
    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground
    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the
    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in
    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the
    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed
    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a
    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted
    from the expression "R-dot-bar sub n" (nth smoothed value of derivative
    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations
    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.

    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December
    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a
    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world
    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide
    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).

    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective
    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary
    space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar
    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in
    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.

    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and
    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it
    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere
    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from
    this preliminary scan that Mars was a "dead" world in both the
    geological and biological sense.

    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that
    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information
    that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times
    that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface
    of an ocean.

    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work
    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away
    the concept of Mars as a "dead" planet, first made from the basic
    measurements of MARINER 4.

    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket
    launcher autopilot failed.

    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to
    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no
    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian
    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once
    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup
    images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.

    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe
    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in
    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,
    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four
    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974
    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed
    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than
    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which
    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.


    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)

    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph
    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide
    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new
    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft
    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on
    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.

    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first
    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally
    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead
    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to
    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6
    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,
    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would
    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.

    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER
    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to
    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through
    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever
    to do so.

    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER
    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made
    the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus
    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere
    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the
    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the
    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day
    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before
    its batteries failed.


    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)

    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They
    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems
    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.

    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an
    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the
    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.
    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the
    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.

    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but
    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,
    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.

    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost
    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon
    and drifted off into solar orbit.

    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send
    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact
    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras
    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first
    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.


    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)

    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image
    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO
    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our
    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.
    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were
    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.
    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar
    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.


    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)

    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar
    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the
    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered
    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing
    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was
    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.

    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the
    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images
    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from
    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,
    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored
    the Tycho crater region in 1968.


    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)

    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on
    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June
    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse
    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for
    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes
    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of
    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was
    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is
    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the
    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and
    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.

    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran
    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a
    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep
    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command
    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until
    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the
    engineers' efforts through May of 1983.

    An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the
    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the
    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,
    DC is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until
    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.

    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit
    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in
    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its
    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording
    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in
    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut
    down on April 12, 1980.

    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.


    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)

    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March
    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched
    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,
    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and
    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare
    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to
    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,
    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.

    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their
    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered
    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and
    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major
    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous
    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.

    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets
    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep
    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive
    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle
    is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was
    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.
    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,
    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.

    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,
    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly
    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was
    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational
    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on
    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10
    satellites and one more ring were discovered.

    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,
    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright
    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were
    discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a
    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)

    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their
    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets
    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the
    location of the heliopause. Low-frequency radio emissions believed to
    originate at the heliopause have been detected by both VOYAGERs.
SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS

    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and
    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:


    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES

    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first
             craft in solar orbit.
    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.
    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.
    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was
             also a test for future Mars missions.
    LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images
             from surface.
    LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.
    LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.
    ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8
             accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were
             unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.
    LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil
              to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in
              1972.
    LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's
              surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished
              with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.
    LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in
              1976.


    SOVIET VENUS PROBES

    VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions
               lost enroute in 1961.
    VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with
               VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in
               February of 1966. No images were returned.
    VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.
               Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe
               became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.
    VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending
               through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before
               reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles
               similar in 1969.
    VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet
               in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in
               1972.
    VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the
               first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar
               mission.
    VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.
                VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.
    VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of
                planet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.
    VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian
             atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on
             to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in
             March of 1986.


    SOVIET MARS PROBES

    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased
             enroute the following year.
    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian
             surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.
    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian
             surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red
             Planet in 1971.
    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander
             signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.
    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to
             fire, probe went on into solar orbit.
    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in
             1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.
             probe MARINER 9.
    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.
    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit
             with its flyby bus.
    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest
               moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to
               human/computer error.
    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did
               enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week
               before scheduled Phobos landing.

    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even
    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have
    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,
    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a
    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been
    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now
    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their
    space program remains to be seen.


EUROPEAN PLANETARY MISSIONS

    GIOTTO was launched by an Ariane-1 by ESA on July 2 1985, and approached
    within 540 km +/- 40 km of the nucleus of comet Halley on March 13,
    1986. The spacecraft carried 10 instruments including a multicolor
    camera, and returned data until shortly before closest approach, when
    the downlink was temporarily lost. Giotto was severely damaged by
    high-speed dust encounters during the flyby and was placed into
    hibernation shortly afterwards.

    In April, 1990, Giotto was reactivated. 3 of the instruments proved
    fully operational, 4 partially damaged but usable, and the remainder,
    including the camera, were unusable. On July 2, 1990, Giotto made a
    close encounter with Earth and was retargeted to a successful flyby of
    comet Grigg-Skjellerup on July 10, 1992.

    A much more complete description of the Giotto Extended Mission is in

        <a

r.arc.nasa.gov/pub/SPACE/FAQ/GiottoHistory</a>


JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS

    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on
    January 8, 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km
    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instruments to
    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of
    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on
    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the Earth's. The closest
    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The
    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for
    a Japanese spacecraft.

    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail
    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby
    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third
    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).


    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,
    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten
    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first
    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget
    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to
    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.

    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An
    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists
    to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March
    19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The
    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt
    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.

    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and
    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten
    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,
    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and
    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into
    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the
    approach:

        Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km
        Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km
        Inclination     : 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)
        Period          : 4.7 days


PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES

    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three
    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,
    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means
    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your
    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can
    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.

    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it
    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in
    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in
    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date
    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra
    background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good
    public and university library. Some of the more recently published works
    can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market
    bookstore.

       as well as the probes and planetary mission objectives
       themselves.)

    Other works and periodicals:

    NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space
    probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry
    these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission
    you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study
    some of the books listed above.

    Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL
    GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's
    Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,
    SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER
    missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the
    VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

    More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions
    can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and
    SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major
    newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,
    but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events
    were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are
    affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you
    probably know.

    Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you
    might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space
    groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their
    periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe
    missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,
    Pasadena, California 91106 USA.

    Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I
    personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas
    in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from
    it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

<P>None of the moon probes hit near the poles. In fact, the farthest
from the equator was Surveyor 7, which soft-landed at about 41 deg S
latitude, 10 deg W longitude in January 1968.</P>

<P>The Russians tended to shoot for the areas nearest the limbs. Some
candidate sites for the <a href="/adb/m/02/02/">Luna program</a>, in order
of the elevation of Earth above the horizon:</P>

Data from 1 to 3 year mission will allow constructionof a detailed, map of the surface composition of the Moon, and willimprove our understanding of the origin, evolution, current state, andresources of the Moon. The spacecraft will be graphite-epoxy drum, 1.4meters in diameter and 1.22 meters high with three radial instrumentbooms. It will be spin-stabilized and controlled by 6 hydrazinemonopropellant 22-Newton thrusters. Communications are through twoS-band transponders and slotted, phased-array medium gain antenna andomnidirectional low-gain antenna. There will be no on-board computer,ground command will be through a 3.6 kbps telemetry link. Total missioncost will be $51 million (in 1992 dollars). After launch, the LunarProspector will have a 110 hour cruise to the Moon, followed by insertioninto a 100 km alttitude circular lunar polar orbit with a period of 118minutes.</P><H3>Scientific Investigations</H3><P><B>Gamma Ray Spectrometer</B> (GRS) - G.

The NS will also locate any significant quantities of waterwhcih may exist in the permanently shadowed areas near the lunar poles.</P><P><B>Magnetometer</B> (MAG) - Mario Acuna, NASA Goddard; Lon Hood, Univ. ofArizona LPLElectron Reflectometer (ER) - Robert Lin, UC Berkley SSLThe MAG/ER experiments will return data on the lunar crustal magneticfield and the lunar induced magnetic dipole. These data will help providean understanding of the origin of lunar paleomagnetism and the Degree towhich impacts can produce paleomagnetism, and allow constrains on thesize and composition of the (possible) lunar core.</P><P><B>Alpha Particle Spectrometer</B> (APS) - Alan Binder, Lockheed - The APS instrument will be used to find radon outgassing events on thelunar surface by detecting alpha particles from the radon gas itself andits decay product, polonium. Observations of the frequency and locationsof the gas release events will help characterize one possible source ofthe tenuous lunar atmosphere. Determination of the relationship ofoutgassing sites with crater age and tectonic features may be possible.This may in turn be used to characterize the current level of lunartectonic activity.</P><P><B>Doppler Gravity Experiment</B> (DGE) - Alex Konopliv, NASA JPL - This investigation will use Doppler tracking of S-band radio signals tocharacterize the spacecraft orbit and determine the lunar gravity field.This data will provide information on the lunar interior and, combinedwith lunar topographic data, will allow modelling of the global crustalasymmetry, crustal structure, and subsurface basin structure. It can alsobe used for planning future lunar missions.</P><H3>Lunar Prospector Project Management</H3><P>Principal Investigator - Alan Binder, Lockheed<BR>Project Manager - D.J.

All three craft    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.</P><P>PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.</P><P>PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever    to do so.</P><P>PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made    the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before    its batteries failed.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Fri, Apr 19, 1996<br>From <a href="mailto:LKlaes@aol.com">Larry Klaes</a>'s Planetary ProbeHistory section of the sci.space FAQ, with permission.<br>Content by Larry Klaes <ahref="mailto:LKlaes@aol.com">&lt;LKlaes@aol.com&gt;</a>, maintained by <AHREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar ResourcesCompany</a>.</font></body></html>

The image at the top of the page is a false color imageof the Moon created by combining 53 images taken from three differentfilters on Galileo during the 1992 fly-by. (Picture contact:http://NSSDC.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/planetary_home.html) Pink representshighlands, blue-to-orange denote volcanic flows. The primary mission ofthe Galileo orbiter and probe is to explore Jupiter and its satellites.(More information on the spacecraft and mission to Jupiter is givenbelow.) Due to the great distance to Jupiter of over 600 millionkilometers, and the onboard fuel limitations, a series of planetaryfly-bys have taken place in order to give Galileo a gravity assist to Jupiter:</p><PRE>Launch             18 Oct 1989Venus              10 Feb 1990Earth/Moon 1       08 Dec 1990Gaspra             29 Oct 1991Earth/Moon 2       08 Dec 1992Ida                28 Aug 1993Jupiter arrival    07 Dec 1995</PRE><P>These fly-bys gave Galileo an opportunity to image the Moon atvarious wavelengths with the Solid State Imaging (SSI) camera. The camerauses a high-resolution, 800 x 800 charge-coupled device (CCD) array witha field of view of ).46 degrees. Multi-spectral coverage is provided byan eight-position filter wheel on the camera, consisting of threebroad-band filters: violet (404 nm), green (559 nm) and red (671 nm);four near-infrared filters: 727nm, 756 nm, 889 nm, and 986 nm; and oneclear filter 611 nm with a very broad (440 nm) passband.</P><P>This Galileo image shows the north pole of the Moon:(Again if you want the picture it is at the above http address.)</P><H3>Physical Information</H3><H4>Orbiter</H4><P>Launch Date: 12 October 1989<BR>Launch Vehicle: Shuttle/ Inertial Upper Stage<BR>On-orbit mass: 2380 kg<BR>Power System: Radioisotope Thermal Generators (RTGs) of 570 W</P><H4>Probe</H4><p>Release Date 13 July 1995 at 05:30 UTC<BR>Entry Date: 07 December 1995 at 22:04 UTC (d:04 p.m. EST)<BR>Launch Vehicle: Shuttle/Inertial Upper Stage<BR>On-orbit mass: 335 Kg<BR>Power System: Storage batteries of 580 W</p><H3>Mission Overview</H3><P>The Galileo Mission consists of two spacecrafts: an orbiter and anatmospheric probe. Launched during the STS 34 flight of the AtlantisOrbiter, the two spacecraft were kicked out of Earth orbit by an internalupper stage (IOU) rocket, sending them careening through the inner solarsystem. The trajectory which the spacecraft followed was called a VEEGA(Venus-Earth- Earth Gravity Assist) traveling first in toward the sunfor a gravity assist from Venus before encountering the Earth two times(spaced two years apart). These encounters with Venus and Earth allowedGalileo to gain enough velocity to get it out to Jupiter.</P><P>During the fly-bys of Venus and Earth, Galileo scientists took theopportunity to study these two planets as well as the Moon, making someunprecedented observations as a result. In addition, following each Earthfly-by, Galileo made excursions as far out in the solar system as theasteroid belt, enabling scientists to make the first close-up studies oftwo asteroids, Gaspra and Ida. As if this were not sufficient, Galileoscientists were fortunate to be the only ones with a direct view of theComet Shoemaker-Levy 9 fragment impacts on Jupiter. All of this was priorto the primary missions of sending an atmospheric probe into Jupiter'satmosphere and studying Jupiter, its satellites, and its magnetospherefor two years with the orbiter.</P><P>Interplanetary studies were also made sporadically by some of theother Galileo instruments, including the dust detector, magnetometer, andvarious plasma and particles detectors, during its six-year journey toJupiter.</P><P>The probe was released from the orbiter 147 days prior to itsentry into the Jovian atmosphere on 7 December 1995</P><P>(Galileo is now returning data on Jupiter and its Moons.)</P><H3>Scientific firsts of the Galileo mission</H3><ul type=square><lI>First mission to make a close fly-by of an asteroid (Gaspra).<li>First mission to discover a satellite of an asteroid (Ida's satelliteDactyl).<li>First multispectral study of the Moon.<li>First atmospheric probe to enter Jupiter's atmosphere.<lI>First spacecraft to go into orbit around Jupiter.<lI>First direct observations of a comet impacting a planet (Shoemaker-Levy 9)></ul><H3>Scientific results of the Galileo mission (so far)</H3><P>A comprehensive list of the scientific results of Galileo would be longerthan space permits.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>M.2.9. Clementine Mission Notes</TITLE></HEAD><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><!-- Artemis Data Book --><!-- ADB section M.2.9. Clementine --><!-- file: /adb/m/02/09/mission-notes.html --><!-- v 1.0 --><h2 align="center">Artemis Data Book</H2><h2 align="center">M.2.9. Clementine</H2><h2 align="center">Clementine Mission Notes</H2><P><HR><P><P>All data quoted from NSSDC, National Space Science Data Center.</P><P><HR><P><H3>The Clementine Spacecraft</H3><P>The Clementine spacecraft was built at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratoryin Washington, DC and carried sensors, attitude control systems andsoftware designed and built by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory(LLNL). The USAF supplied advanced lightweight composite structures andthe launch vehicle, a Titan II B refurbished ICBM. Several otherorganizations were involved, especially NASA with communications support,through the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL) Deep Space Network, andorbit determination and operations support from both the Goddard SpaceFlight Center and JPL. Supporting these laboratories were scores ofindustrial contractors, both large and small.</P><P>The spacecraft consists of an octagonal prism about 2 meters high. A110-pound thruster for delta-V maneuvers is on one end of the prism and ahigh-grain fixed dish antenna is on the other end. The spacecraftpropulsion system consists of a nonpropellant hydrazine system forattitude control and a biptopellant nitrogen tetraoxide and monomenthylhydrazine system for the maneuvers in space. The bipropellant system hada total capability of about 1.9 km/s with about 550 m/s required forlunar insertion and 540 m/s for lunar departure. The power systemconsisted of a gimbled, single axis, GaAs/Ge solar array providing atotal spacecraft power of 360 watts at 30 Vdc, with a special power of 240w/kg, based on lightweight construction. Two arrays of the rotating solarpanels protrude from oposite sides; by rolling the spacecraft and rotatingthe panels, full solar illumination of the panels would be achieved. Thesolar array was used to charge a 15 A-h, 47-w hr/kg, Nihau commonpressure vessel battery. The total mass of the spacecraft in the launchconfiguration was 1690 kg, with most of the weight in the solar rocketmotor required for translunar insertion. The spacecraft dry mass is about227 kg, with a roughly equal mass for liquid fuel. This weight wasachieved by incorporating many of the lightweight technologies developedthrough the research and development activities of the Strategic DefenseInitiative (SDI).</P><P>The spacecraft data processing was performed by 3 computingsystems. A MIL-STD-1750A computer with a capacity of 1.7 millioninstructions per second was used for save mode, attitude control system,and housekeeping operations. A reduced instruction set computer (RISC)32-bit processor with 18 million instructions per second was used forimage processing and autonomous operations. The Clementine missionrepresents the first long duration flight of a 32-bit RISC processor.Also incorporated is a state-of-the-art image compression system providedby French Space Agency CNES. A data handling unit with its ownmicrocontroller sequenced the cameras, operated the image compressionsystem, and directed the data flow. During imaging operations, the datawere stored in a 3 kg, 2 Gbit dynamic solid state data recorder and latertransferred to the ground stations using a 128 kb/downlink. The spacecraftwas commanded from the ground using a 1 kb/s uplink from the NASA DeepSpace Network and DoD stations. Demonstration of autonomous navigationincluding autonomous orbit determination was a major goal of theClementine  mission. Autonomous operations were conducted in lunar orbit.</P><P>Clementine was launched on January 25, 1994, from Vandenburg AirForce Base aboard a Titan IIG rocket. After two Earth fly-bys, lunarinsertion was achieved on February 19th. Lunar mapping took place overapproximately 2 months in two systematic mapping passes over the Moon.After successfully completing the Lunar mapping phase of the mission,Clementine suffered an on-board malfunction at 9:39 AM EST, Saturday, May7, 1994. The result of the malfunction prevented Clementine fromperforming the planned close fly-by of the near-Earth asteroid Geographosscheduled for August 1994. Preliminary analysis traced the cause of themalfunction to the on-board computer which controls most of thesatellite's systems, including the attitude control thrusters. Thecomputer activated several thrusters during a 20 minute telemetryinterruption with the ground station, thus depleting all the fuel in theAttitude Control System (ACS) tanks. With the depletion of the ACS tanks,the spacecraft was left spinning at 80 revolutions per minute with noremaining fuel to despin the spacecraft.</P><H3>Clementine Spacecraft Sensors</H3><P>The main instrumentation on Clementine consists of four cameras, one witha laser-ranging system. The cameras include an ultraviolet-visual (UVVIS)camera, a long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) camera, the laser-ranger(LIDAR) high-resolution (HIRES) camera, and a near-infrared (NIR) camera.The spacecraft also has two star tracker cameras (A-STAR, B-STAR), usedmainly for attittude determination, but they also serve as wide-fieldcameras for various scientific and operational purposes. The sensorpackage has a mass of 8 kg and represents the state-of-the-art at theinclination of the Clementine program. The sensors are all located on oneside, 90 degrees away from the solar panels. Clementine has 12 smallattitude control jets that were used to orient the spacecraft to pointthe cameras toward desired targets. The attitude control system includes thetwo star tracker cameras and two lightweight inertial measurement units,based on a ring laser gyro and an interferometric fiber optic gyro.During initial  deployment at low-earth-orbit, the full size spacecraftwas 3-axis stabilized. The spacecraft was 3-axis stabilized in lunarorbit via reaction wheels, with precision of 0.05 Deg. control and 0.03in knowledge.</p><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Fri, Jun 21, 1996<br>Content by Marvin Ostrega <ahref="mailto:OSTRMA91@SNYONEVA.CC.ONEONTA.EDU">&lt;OSTRMA91@SNYONEVA.CC.ONEONTA.EDU&gt;</a>, maintained by <AHREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar ResourcesCompany</a>.</font></body></html>

It offersan excellent discussion of the findings of new evidence for <ahref="/adb/02/02/south-pole-ice.html">ice on the lunar southpole</a>.</P><BR><BR><P><HR><P><glockquote><pre>               Clementine Team Confirms Lunar Ice Discovery        A team of scientists from the <a href="/adb/m.02/09/">Clementinelunar mission</a> haveconfirmed the discovery of what they believe to be deposits of water icein the permanent shadows of craters at the Moon's south pole.        In an article in the November 29 issue of Science, a team led byStewart Nozette of the Air Force Phillips Laboratory discussed theresults of a bistatic radar experiment conducted while the Clementinespacecraft was in orbit around the Moon in 1994. In the experiment,radar waves sent by Clementine bounced off the Moon wand were recoveredby 70-meter antennas of NASA's Deep Space Network.        The Clementine team found an enhancement in the signals inpermanently shadowed created in the Moon's south pole regions butnowhere else on the surface. The enhancement can be best explained by abody of water ice hidden in the crater.        The paper confirms rumors floating in the space community over thelast two and a half years about the possible discovery of ice on theMoon. Such a discovery is seen as a big boost for efforts to return tothe Moon, since the ice there could be used to provide water and oxygenfor a manned settlement there.        The discovery of ice on the Moon "suddenly changes the wholecalculus of going to the Moon," said Eugene Shoemaker, one of the co-authors of the paper.        The source of the ice has been hypothesized to be remnants ofcomets which crashed into the lunar surface over billions ofyears.</PRE></bockquote><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Fri, Dec 6, 1996<br>Maintained by <AHREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar ResourcesCompany</a>.</font></body></html>

The Lunar Environment</H2><h2 align="center">Why the Moon Loses Gasses</H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Gregory R. Bennett</I></P><P><HR><P><P>A gas is a collection of particles bouncing around.  The hotter the gasis, thefaster the particles move.  Also, the lighter the gas particles are, the fasterthey move at a given temperature.</P><P>On the earth, the gravity field is relatively high, and the range of surfacetemperatures isn't hot enough to cause the gas particles to reach escapevelocity.  So lightweight gasses stay in the atmosphere.</P><P>On the moon, surface temperatures reach 200 degrees, causing molecules of thelighter gasses (such as <a href="/adb/m/08/08/hydrogen.html">hydrogen</a>)to move faster to lunar escape velocity.  So theyescape into free space.</P><h3>Why this leads to water in special places on the lunar surface ...</h3><P>For lightweight substances to stick to the surface of the moon, they have tostay in a solid or liquid state.  In regions of extreme cold, these substancescan remain frozen in a solid state.  The only such region on the surface of themoon is in double-shadowed craters near the south pole.  (The antarctic regionof the moon starts at latitude 83 degrees South.)</P><P>Double-shadowed craters are craters whose rims are shadowed by other craters,100% of time.  This has allowed these surface regions to remain very, very coldfor a few billion years.  Anything that lands there, stays there,especially if it ends up covered with a layer of regolith for protectionagainst solar wind and cosmic ray sputtering, and the Moon's slight, butnot insignificant, inclination of 1 20'.</P><h3>What about beneath the surface ...</h3><P>A foot or two beneath the surface, the moon is a constant temperature, a fewdegrees below the freezing point of water.  Except for transient impacts, thesetemperature conditions have existed for 3 or 4 billion years.</P><P>We have no data about whether volatiles are trapped in the lunar refrigeratorthroughout the surface of the moon.  We probably won't know for sure until weget there and start digging.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Mon, Dec 9, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

Colorson the moon represent the full range of Earth tones, from deepest black towhite, with a vast range of browns, tans, and grays in between. Dependingon the sun angle it can have a silvery sheen or sparkle in the sunlight orbe completely washed out. There are a few shades of purple and rustyreds, but these are usually filtered out by the dusty coating.

Maria, mountains, rilles andclefts are all major landforms on the Moon. <ahref="/adb/m/04/01/crater-notes.html">Craters</a> are not discussed.</P><P>The marias are smooth plains with very few mountains and solid lavaflows. Unlike the more prevalent highland terrain, the maria is loaded withbasaltic lavas which contain iron, titanium, and magnesium. These materialsflowed from the Moon's interior and filled mare basins over 3 billion yearsago, as a result of meteorite bombardment and readiosotope decay. Thefarside of the Moon is covered by only 2.6% of maria but on the nearsidethe maria covers 31.2% of the Moon's surface.</P><P>The terrae, or highlands, are covered with craters of all sizes, andcontain large quantities of aluminum and calcium. They are the oldest partsof the Moon, not having been resurfaced by mare lava flows.<P>Mountains are very few on the Moon and are far outnumbered by largecraters. Because of the Moon's lack of terrestrial land-forming devices,lunar mountains are quite dissimilar to terrestrial ones. It is possiblethat Lunar mountains are actually the remains of crater walls because theyfollow the remnants of gigantic craters.</P><P>Lunar montains have a gradual slope of 15-20 degrees compared to 30-35degrees on Earth. This is in spite of the lower lunar gravity and thushigher stable angles of repose.</P><P>Faults and depressions on the Moon are called rilles and clefts.Previously thought to be dry river beds, sinuous rilles are lava channnelswhich were probably active during the maria formation. There are likelysimilar formations, lava tubes, which carried lava during the same periodof mare basin flooding. These lava tubes may be hundreds of metresacross.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Thu, July 25, 1996<br>Content by Marvin Ostrega <ahref="mailto:ostrega@asi.org">&lt;ostrega@asi.org&gt;</a>, maintained by <AHREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar ResourcesCompany</a>.</font></body></html>

Dueto the lack of plate tectonics, Lunar seismic activity is about a 100millionth of Earth's, or ~2 x 10<FONT SIZE=1><SUP>10</SUP></FONT> J/yr(excluding impacts). In eight years of monitoring, a large-but-raremoonquake has not been recorded, but it is possible to have up to 1 x10<FONT SIZE=1><SUP>14</SUP></FONT> J/yr if such events were recorded. Thelargest recorded seismic activities are approximately equivalent to a 4 onthe richter scale, with 1-2 being typical.</P><P>The lunar seismic activity is usually caused from tidal forces andsecondary effects from impacts. Secondary effects includes fresh craterejecta cracking due to thermal stresses and disruption of slopes with highangles of repose. Other, non-seismic activity includes astronaut activityand impacts (both meteorite and artificial).</P><P>The Moon has very low elastic wave propagation losses, and seismicactivity is thus clearly registered over long distances.  This lowattenuation also results in a long half-lives of seismic energy, in thetens of minutes, and the phrase "rang like a bell" after an Saturn upperstage lunar impact. Incidently, this long seismic signature suggests itselfas a possible communication device, albeit with bandwidth issues.</P><P>There are secondary effects from lunar seismic activity that can createhazards to a presence on the Moon. Because of the excellent wavepropagation, seismic activity can create widespread secondary activity,such as crater wall slumping and landslides.

Radiation kills in four basicways:</P><OL><LI>Direct brain hemorrhage and brain cell destruction<LI>Diarrhea-induced dehydration<LI>Damage to the immune system<LI>Long term cancer</OL><P>The first is immediately lethal and can't be treated. It is also themain causeof death for radiation victims. The second sets in early and is the maincause of death from doses around 100-400 rem.  The cells lining theintestinal tract die off and their cell walls become permeable to bloodfluids. Water, blood sugars, and salts flow through the dead cells anddrain through the intestinal tractresulting in rapid dehydration and salt deficiencies. Nausea prevents theintake of fluids from being matched to the losses. Anti-nausea drugs existas do intravenous rehydration solutions. These can keep the radiation victimalive long enough for the lining of the intestines to regrow.</P><P>The immune system effects are delayed by about a week because there is areserve of unused immune cells in the human body. Treating this effectinvolves stored a large white blood cell sample from each astronaut beforelaunch. Over a few months the astronaut donates blood, the white cells areremoved, and the rest is transfused back into his/her body. Some of thestored blood is sent into space with the astronaut housed in a lead fridge,the rest being stored on Earth. If a radiation dose is received some of thewhite cells are transfused back into the donor astronaut. Because this ishis/her own blood there would be no compatibility problems. The old immunecells keep the immune system going until the bone marrow makes a batch ofnew white blood cells. A bone marrow sample  may also be taken before aflight to allow damaged marrow to be replaced.</P><P>By taking samples of a crew members' white blood cells and bone marrowbefore he/she goes into space, we create a stock of samples that can beused torepair the immune system quickly after chemotherapy. Thus the long termcancer problems are partly solved. Using white blood and marrow taken fromwell before the injury avoids the problems of compatibility and rejectionmaking strong chemotherapy safer.</P><P>Samples of sperm, eggs and even a small skin sample may allow damage tothe reproductive organs and burns to be repaired. This allows relativelysafeinvetro-reproduction after a heavy dose of radiation.</P><P>No medical technique will replace careful shielding design, but with astock of cells from the crews' own bodies we have the resources to fight thedamage from radiation and win a large percentage of the time. It might alsobe a good idea for one of <a href="/adb/04/06/01/">the crew</a> to havemedical training.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Wed, Apr 24, 1996<br>Content by Wesley Ian Bruce <ahref="mailto:wesleyb@cin.gov.au">&lt;wesleyb@cin.gov.au&gt;</a>, maintainedby <AHREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar ResourcesCompany</a>.</font></body></html>

      Lunar equator is tilted 1 deg 32 min from the ecliptic
      Lunar equator is tilted 6 deg 41 min from its orbital plane
      Orbital plane is titled 5 deg  9 min from ecliptic
</PRe>
<img src="/images/asi199600028.gif" alt="Diagram of Orbit and Inclinations"
height=290 width=470>
<P>Longitudinal libration, due to elliptical orbit of the moon about the
Earth, is 7.7 deg. From the point of view of an observer on the moon, that
makes Earth rock back and forth in the sky, east to west.</P>
<P>Latitudinal libration, due to the tilt of the moon's axis with respect
to the ecliptic, will cause the Earth to oscillate north and south by 6.7
deg each way.</P>
<P>So, from a point on the moon, the Earth will always be found somewhere
in a box 15.4 deg wide and 13.4 deg high. Earth's diameter subtends about 2
deg.</P>
<P>Lunar libration does have implications regarding antenna beam spread and
transmission efficiency for beaming information to Earth over long periods
of time. At the very least, it means the equipment moving an
Earth-tracking antenna could be fairly simple (no rotating electrical or
fluid joints, just flex cables), and the antenna's slew rate would be very
slow.</P>
<P>From the point of view of someone on Earth, longitudinal libration means
we get a peek at the lunar farside 7.7 deg past 90 deg east and west longitude
as it goes through its 29-day orbit about the Earth. This means Mare Crisium
will sometimes be rather prominent in the northeastern quadrant, and sometimes
turned away from us more.</P>
<P>Diurnal libration, as seen from Earth due to rotation of the Earth, is 1
deg at western edge when moon is rising and 1 deg at eastern edge when moon is
setting. (That's because of the diameter of the Earth; doesn't contribute to
Earth wobbling in lunar sky.)</P>
<P>Actually, the average lunar month in time it takes to go around Earth
is 29.531 days, plus or minus 13 hours depending on the moon goddess's mood.
Now, this is tricky. The period of the moon's orbit with respect to the stars
is 27.322 days; that's a sidereal month.</P>
<P>For completeness: the moon's orbit has a perigee of 356,410 km and an
apogee of 406,697 km. Its mean radius is 1,738 km (and very round, albeit
bumpy; flattening is only 0.0005 compared to Earth's 0.0034; that's the price
our home planet pays for being such a dervish), mass 7.353E22 kg, escape
velocity at the surface at the equator 2.38 km/sec, gravity at the equator
1.62 m/sec^2.</P>

<P>Plane change is very important for the return rendezvous. Your absolutely
minimal ascent vehicle won't have enough delta-V to do a plane change into
lunar orbit. If the <a href="/adb/04/01/01/03/">landing site</a> is not in
the plane of the waiting <a href="/adb/04/02/01/">Lunar Transfer
Vehicle</a>, then it will have to plane change to meet the launch vehicle.
This is difficult.</P>

<P>The moon rotates, of course, once every 28 days. So if your landing site
is in the plane of the orbit at day X, it will rotate out of that plane and
not be back in that plane until day X+28. This is a bad situation; you
want the option to leave the surface at any time in the mission in case you
get into a situation where you can't survive until a launch window half a
month away.</P>

<P>There are two choices for landing sites which do not rotate out from
under the Lunar Transfer Vehicle's orbital plane. These are equatorial
sites [which is the reason that the early Apollos landed at near 
equatorial sites], and polar sites.</P>

<P>However, polar orbit has a different orbital phasing difficulty. The
transfer orbit from LMO to Trans-Earth coast uses least delta-V if the
impulse is perpendicular to the Earth-moon line. For an equatorial orbit,
this condition happens once every orbit. For a polar orbit, this happens
twice a month. Further, if you return to LEO instead of to direct Earth
surface (as Apollo did), the trans-Earth Hohmann from a minimum delta-V LMO
injection is out of plane. A three-impulse transfer solves that problem
(and lowers the delta-v), but at the price of longer trip time.</P>

<P>Conclusion: if your landing site is not equatorial, you must budget either
extra delta-v or extra time.</P>

Thismethod requires precise timing of the launch, with some variability inlaunch time (launch window) if the launch azimuth and the launch vehicle'spitch profile can be varied through the launch window of perhaps severalminutes or tens of minutes.</P><P>Launching to a parking orbit gives the launch segment an easier job becausethe requirement to vary the pitch profile goes away.  Instead, a variabletime in parking orbit is required to absorb launch timing variation.Variable launch azimuth is still needed, as with the direct launch, to havea launch window.</P><P>If the vehicle can last an extended period of time in parking orbit, it canwait for either of the two times per month that the moon passes through theparking orbit plane, to perform the injection burn into translunar orbit.The parking orbit's inclination can be anything; however, an inclinationequal to the moon orbit's (28.5 deg on the average) will require slightlyless orbit transfer fuel.  If the parking orbit's plane is not the same asthe moon's, the translunar trajectory will be inclined to the moon's orbitbut this is no problem.  No plane change is required, and the only reasonthe fuel requirement increases slightly is that there is a slightlydifferent cumulative perturbation from the moon's gravity acting on thetrajectory.</P><P>A couple of interesting approaches should be mentioned.  One is the GetAwaySpecial (GAS) proposed by the Iowa State University Aerospace Engineeringclass several years ago for a Shuttle flight.  It was to fly from theShuttle bay to lunar orbit without expending fuel at all.  The propulsionwas the reactive effect of solar pressure impinging on solar sails whichwere to be held at carefully guided angles so as to always be increasingthe orbital energy on the way to the libration point, then decreasingtrajectory energy from there to lunar orbit.  This approach needs to belaunch to a parking orbit and the flight time is long (months or years).</P><P>Another approach uses extended periods of time in the zones of roughlyequal gravitation (fuzzy boundary) between earth and sun and between earthand moon to achieve the trajectory energy change equivalent to orbittransfers.  This also requires long flight time (months or years) andinvolves a close flyby of the trailing face of the moon.  It ends in a verylarge orbit about the moon, near libration point distance.</P><P>Conventional orbit transfer burn flights require three of four days forthe translunar portion.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Fri, Jun 7, 1996<br>Content by Ted Hansen <ahref="mailto:thansen@smtp.prostar.com">&lt;thansen@smtp.prostar.com&gt;</a>,maintained by <AHREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar ResourcesCompany</a>.</font></body></html>

This period resurfacedthe Mare basins, and changed the look of the Moon dramatically. It alsobrought a different group of minerals to the Moon's surface, increasing thediversity of resources available.</P><P>Over the last 3 billion years, since the nearside's lava resurfacingended,  the Moon's surface has been pitted with craters, which is how wefind it today.

Craters aregiven different names to indicate their type and size. For example, walled plains are 60 to 300 km wide and have craterwalls that are massive and disturbed by other smaller craters, landslidesand valleys. Ring mountains are summetrical craters that have a diameterof 20 to 100 km and have close quarters, terraced inner slopes andcircular walls with well defined summits.

<h2 align="center">Lava Tubes</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Peter Kokh</I></P>
<P><HR><P>


<P>I am afraid I have to disagree with those who feel the existence of
lava tubes is uncertain and can't be counted on. It is as close to certain
as can be that rilles like Hadley (Apollo 15) represent collapsed lava
tubes. We have found some rilles that have "bridge-like interruptions,"
which can only be uncollapsed lava tube sections. Look at Hyginus rille
in a good photographic atlas of the moon and you can pick these sections
out one after the other. To me, this is absolute demonstration, and every
lunar geologist I know agrees.</P>

<P>Where there are some, there are more. Lava tubes seem to be a natural
aspect of the way the mare basins filled with sheets of lava. They (and
the rilles degenerated from them) run gently downhill from the high points
of the lava sheets, radiating outwards from the points of eruption or
upwelling.</P>

<P>These things, to judge from the size of the sinuous rilles, are of 
enormous size and volume. Unlike terrestrial lava tubes, which are a few 
tens of meters wide at best and a few kilometers long at most, rilles are 
typically hundreds of meters in cross section and can run for hundreds of 
kilometers.</P>

<P>Thus, sealing one up -- even a shorter uncollapsed section -- can be a 
tall order. Sputtering a coating of metal on the inside surfaces may be one
possibility, but it will take a lot of metal. The elements to make
epoxy-like or other synthetic coatings are not present on the moon except
as traces. Foamed metal is a possible development, but whether it can 
withstand the forces of pressurization is debatable.</P>

<P>The main benefits a lava tube offers is shelter from cosmic rays, solar
flares, ultraviolet, and micrometeorite bombardment. Those still intact
have withstood the onslaught of over 3.5 billion years of various kinds of
assault. The way to proceed may be to place inflatable structures inside, 
even large ones, with individual flimsier "buildings" inside. Who knows what
the future will bring? Near term, however, they can only be counted on to
provide the shelter I have just described. This will be especially 
valuable for volume- and surface-intensive needs of industry, warehousing,
and agriculture.</P>

<P>As the maria have all filled with more than one episode of magma 
outwelling (i.e., the maria are comprised of layers of lava sheets), each 
layer may have associated lava tubes. Those in deeper layers may contain 
more intact tubes than the surface sheet exposed to eons of bombardment. 
But they will also be harder to find and access.</P>

<P>Of the lava tubes in Oregon, many have "natural entrances" only
partially filled and obstructed with removable talus collapse debris. I
would expect to find the same opportunities to enter at the uncollapsed
"bridges" of the Hyginus rille.</P>

The Lunar Environment</H2><h2 align="center">Top Ten Scientific Discoveries Made During ApolloExploration of the Moon</H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Marvin Ostrega</I></P><P><HR><P><P>All information rewritten from NASA files.</P><ol><P><LI>The Moon is not a primordial object; it is an evolved terrestrialplanet with internal zoning similar to that of the Earth.</P><P>Before Apollo, the state of the Moon was a subject of almost unlimitedspeculation. We now know that the Moon is made of rocky material that hasbeen variously melted, erupted through volcanoes, and crushed bymeteorite impacts. The Moon possesses a thick crust (^0 km), a fairlyuniform lithosphere (60-1000 km), and a partly liquid asthenoshphere(1000-1740 Km): a small iron core at the bottom of the asthenosphere ispossible but unconfirmed. Some rocks give hints for ancient magneticfields although no planetary field exists today.</P><P><LI>The Moon is ancient and still preserves an early history (the firstbillion years) that must be common to all terrestial planets.</P><P>The extensive record of meteorite craters on the Moon, when calibratedusing absolute ages of rock samples, provides a key for unraveling timescales for the geologic evolution of Mercury, Venus, and Mars based ontheir individual crater records. Photogeological interpretation of otherplanets is based largely on lessons learned from the Moon. Before Apollo,however, the origin of lunar impact craters was not fully understood andthe origin of similar craters on Earth was highly debated.</P><P><LI>The youngest Moon rocks are virtually as old as the oldest Earthrocks. The earliest processes and events that probably affected bothplanetary bodies can now only be found on the Moon.</P><P>Moon rock ages range from about 3.2 billion years in the maria (dark,low basins) to nearly 4.6 billion years in the terra (light, ruggedhighlands). Active geologic forces, including plate techtonics anderosion, continuously repave the oldest surfaces on Earth wheras oldsurfaces persist with little disturbance on the Moon.</P><P><LI>The Moon and earth are genetically related and were formed from differentproportions of a common resevoir of materials. </P><P>The distinctively similar oxygen isotopic compositions of Moon rocksand Earth rocks clearly show common ancestry. Relative to Earth, however,the Moon was highly depleted in iron and in volatile elements that areneeded to form atmospheric gases and water.</P><P><LI>The Moon is lifeless; it contains no living organisms, fossils, ornative organic compounds.</P><P>Extensive testing revealed no evidence for life, past or present,among the lunar samples. Even non-biological organic compounds areamazingly absent; traces can be attributed to contamination by meteorites.</P><P><LI>All Moon rocks originated through high-temperature processes withlittle or no involvement with water. They are roughly divisible intothree types: basalts, anorthosites, and breccias.</P><P><LI>Basalts are dark lava rocks that fill mare basins; they generallyresemble, but are much older than, lavas that comprise the oceanic crustof Earth. Anorthosites are light rocks that form the ancient highlands;they generally resemble, but are much older than, the most ancient rockson Earth. Breccias are composite rocks formed from all other rock typesthrough crushing, mixing, and sintering, during meteorite impacts. TheMoon has no sandstones, shales, or limestones such as testify to theimportance of water-borne processes on Earth.</P><P><LI>Early in its history, the Moon was melted to great depths to form a"magma ocean." The lunar highlands contain the remnants of early, lowdensity rocks that floated to the surface of the magma ocean.</P><P>The lunar highlands were formed about 4.4-4.6 billion years ago byflotation of an early, feldspar-rich crust on a magma ocean that coveredthe Moon to a depth of many tens of kilometers or more. Innumerablemeteorite impacts through geologic time reduced much of the ancient crustto arcane mountain ranges between basins.</P><P><LI>The lunar magma ocean was followed by a series of huge asteroid impactsthat created basins which were later filled by lava flows.</P><P>The large, dark basins such as Mare Imbrium are gigantic impactcraters, formed early in lunar history, that were later filled by lavaflows about 3.2-3.9 billion years ago. Lunar volcanism occurred mostly aslava floods that spread horizontally; volcanic fire fountains produceddeposits of orange and emerald-green glass beads.</P><LI><P>The Moon is slightly asymmetrical in bulk form, possibly as aconsequence of its evolution under Earth's gravitational influence. Itscrust is thicker on the far side, while most volcanic basins -- andunusual mass concentrations -- occur on the near side.</P><P>Mass is not distributed uniformly inside the Moon. Large massconcentrations ("Mascons") lie beneath the surface of many large lunarbasins and probably represent thick accumulations of dense lava. Relativeto its geometric center, the Moon's center of mass is displaced towardEarth by several kilometers.</P><P><lI>The surface of the Moon is covered by a rubble pile of rock fragmentsand dust, called the lunar regolith, that contains a unique radiationhistory of the Sun which is of importance to understanding climatechanges on Earth.</P></ol><P>The regolith was produced by innumerable meteorite impacts throughgeologic time. Surface rocks and mineral grains are distinctivelyenriched in chemical elements and isotopes implanted by solar radiation.As such, the Moon has recorded four billion years of the Sun's history toa degree of completeness that we are unlikely to find elsewhere.</P><H3>The Lunar Quest Continues</H3><P>In 1993, more than 60 research laboratories throughout the worldcontinue studies on the Apollo Lunar samples. Many new analyticaltechnologies, which did not exist in 1969-72 when the Apollo missionswere returning lunar samples, are now being applied by the thirdgeneration scientists. The deepest secrets of the Moon remain to berevealed.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sat, Apr 15, 1996<br>Content by Marvin Ostrega <ahref="mailto:OSTRMA91@SNYONEVA.CC.ONEONTA.EDU">&lt;OSTRMA91@SNYONEVA.CC.ONEONTA.EDU&gt;</a>, maintained by <AHREF="MAILTO:simon@eagle.ca">&lt;simon@eagle.ca&gt;</A>.<br>"<a href="/Artemis.html">The Artemis Project</a>"is a trademark of <aHREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Lrc.html">The Lunar ResourcesCompany</a>.</font></body></html>

<h2 align="center">Lunar Regolith Structural Properties</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Gregory R. Bennett</I></P>
<P><HR><P>

<P>Lunar Regolith has many unique properties. The most obvious one is that
the particles of dirt are very jagged, which causes them to interlock and
have inconvenient, or even harmful, effects.</P>

<P>The particles of Lunar regolith don't flow over each other. Unlike Earth
sands, lunar dust hasn't been weathered, so the grains are very jagged.
Subjected to pressure, such as the edge of a core-sampling instrument or
the blade of a shovel, they jam against each other and resist the invader 
almost like solid rock.</P>

<P>Andrew Chaikan mentioned in his book A MAN ON THE MOON that the dust
even caused hay fever in some of the astronauts. The jagged edges irritate
the sinuses the same way pollen grains do. We'll need top-notch air
filters to cope with that.</P>

<P>The essay in THE LUNAR SOURCEBOOK, section 9.1.6, discusses
compressibility of the soil. Generally, the stuff (from Luna 16 and Luna
20 samples) seems to resist compression by pressures up to 1.2 kPa, and
then yield dramatically to pressures up to 50 kPa. After that, it won't
budge. The impression I get is that at 1.2 kPa, the edges on the grains
start to break, allowing them to slip. At 50 kPa, you've crunched it as
much as you can and you're into trying to break down the crystalline
lattice of each individual grain.</P>

<P>I'm imagining that in a funnel-like device, the jagged edges on the
grains would make them resist slipping past each other to sift through the
funnel. We might be able to get around this by vibrating the soil so the
individual grains bounce off each other.</P>

<P>Incidentally, Russian engineers used a clever technique in building the
Aswan Dam that might serve us somewhere along the line. By vibrating the
sand at one frequency, they got the sand to flow freely, and at a different
frequency the sand compacted so that edges on individual grains fit
together. That made it easy for them to move the sand into place, and 
then lock plain sand together to form a wall strong enough to compete
with a similar mass of concrete.</P>

<P>A mechanism to experiment with vibrating moon sand, even a tiny little
thing, might be a very useful addition to our manifest for the first
flight. We'd need a way to dig up the stuff, dump it into a Oedometer
(compression tester), vibrate it, and then dump it out again. A microscope
to inspect the grains would be useful, too; easy to add to a television 
camera. (Mr. Wizard does it, after all.) The crew could deploy a
remote-controlled test rig like this and then we could use our robots to
test sail samples from all around the lunar base.</P>

Bennett</I></P><P><HR><P><P>The questions of organic molecules and life on the moon might keep theArtemisSociety's Lunar Science Technical Committee debating for years.  Here's somebrain fodder on that subject.</P><P>We seem to be overlooking some important facts:</P><ol><P><LI>Organic molecules are a necessary but not sufficient indicator of life   as we know it.  (Life as we know it consists of self-replicating   molecules based on long-chain hydrocarbon proteins.)</P><P><LI>Organic molecules can be created by non-living chemical processes.</P><P><LI>All we know about the moon below the surface layer of dust comes from   a few widely spaced core samples, some seismological readings, a little   bit of penetrating radar, and extrapolation of geological data based on   observations of the earth.</P><P><LI>The moon as we know it is geologically inactive and, except for the very   top surface of dust, maintains a constant, cool temperature.  However,   the moon has a long history, and we have barely glimpsed the record of   that history.</P><P><LI>Even today, lunar transient events indicate that the moon is not   completely quiescent.  Expulsion of volatiles from the moon is very   rare, but not zero.</P><P><LI>We think of the moon in terms of geological time scales.  However, the   time scale of life is measured in milliseconds rather than millenia.</P><P><LI>Life, once it gets started, is very tenacious.  As long as local   conditions will support the chemical reations, these molecules continue   to replicate themselves with a ferocity otherwise unobserved in the   universe.</P><P><LI>Terrestrial life exists in a very large range of temperatures,   pressures, and chemical environments.</P></OL><P>So, I don't think we can say with certainty that there are no organicmoleculeson the moon.  Or rather, I should say "in" the moon.  Luna has been pummeledwith all sorts of amusing chunks of stuff since the beginning of the solarsystem.  Among those chunks are carbonaceous chondrites and water-icemeteorites.</P><P>With no other data to go on, my best guess is that the conditions forcreatingforms of life have existed on the moon in many (perhaps millions) of littlepockets of time and location over the past few billion years.</P><P>As to whether any of those events resulted in self-replicatingmolecules, I mustremain firmly agnostic; at least until we get there and do some serious digging. The most we can say is that, as best we can tell, it is unlikely thatlife-supporting conditions exist today anywhere on the surface of the moon.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Fri, Dec 13, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

<font size=2>     From: D. Vaniman, D. Pettit, and G. Heiken, "Uses of
Lunar Sulfur,"
     2nd Conference on Lunar Bases, p. 429; 1988</font></pre>

<P>Vaniman, et al., suggest that sulfur may also occur as metal sulfates
that are readily volatized to produce sulfur dioxide, SO2.</P>

<P>Heating experiments by E. K. Gibson, Jr. and G. W. Moore ("Carbon and
sulfur distributions and abundances in lunar fines," Proceedings of the 4th
Lunar Science Conference, 1973) on Apollo 15 and 16 samples show that if you
heat the lunar soil under vacuum conditions, you get:</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><table><tr><td>  <B>Temperature (<font
size=+1>&#176;</font>C)</B>  </td><td> <B>Sulfur Extracted (%)</B></td></tr>
<tr><td> 750  </td><td> 12-30 % </td></tr>
<tr><td>  950  </td><td>  50-70 % </td></tr>
<tr><td> 1100  </td><td> 95 % </td></tr></table></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The sulfur is given off mainly as SO2 or H2S. Heating the soil also
gives you lots of <a href="/adb/m/08/05/volatile-table.html">other neat
stuff</a>.</P>

<P><HR><P>

<P>Incidentally, there are lots of other useful things we can do with
sulfur besides making sulfuric acid. Vaniman, et al., suggest sulfur
concrete, sealants, liquid sulfur dioxide as a working fluid, solar energy
conversion, <a href="/adb/04/03/03/power-source-comparison.html">electrical
energy storage</a> (batteries produced on the moon), sulfuric acid for 
destruction of organic waste, thermochemical water-splitting, a fluxing 
agent to reduce the melting point of glass, and as a rocket fuel.</P>

<P>Sulfur has an <a
href="/adb/04/03/05/consumable-reduction.html">important role</a> in the
biochemical processes of plant and animal life, too.</P>

<P>These guys hint that subsurface mining might find richer deposits of
the stuff, since the way it got deposited on the surface was that sulfur
was probably the driver behind pyroclastic explosions while the moon was
forming.</P>

<H2 align=center>Site Management</H2><P><HR WIDTH=80%><P>

<FONT SIZE=2>by <A HREF="MAILTO:kokhMMM@execpc.com">Peter Kokh</a></FONT>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;It's simple, really. We just plop down a basic habitat
module and throw some moondust over it for good luck, add some solar panels
or a small nuke, a radiator, an antenna, and a rover - and, <I>voila</I>,
we have a Moonbase! Whoa! Doesn't that leave a lot of unanswered questions?
How will our little baby develop? Are we going to be so quick to show
around the latest snapshots of our offspring a few years down the road?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will future growth and development of our little bundle show
that it had "good genes," or "bad" ones? A well-thought-out site management
philosophy with a full deck of guideline zoning protocols, in place from
day one, will help guarantee that we will be proud parents, not just
shortly after birth, but well down the road. That's adding "good genes." If
we fail to do this, or put it off as unimportant, the future of our
creation will be "amorphous," and since corrective and reactive measures
are never as effective as proactive ones (and always too late), an unhappy
McMurdo-style mess is sure to result if we don't care enough now - while we
are planning.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If a definite site, mapped from orbit down to 
near-meter-scale detail, has been predetermined, then our site management
plan can be quite specific in its initial design, with zoning of the 
immediate vicinity well thought out. One would hope this is the case.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If, however, we have only a general location in mind, we'll
leave picking the actual site up to the good judgment of the pilot of the
lunar descent vehicle bringing in the first load, then all we can have
prepared is a manual on the "General Principles of Lunar Base Site
Management." This is how the Apollo landing sites were picked: neighborhood
by NASA, block and lot by the LM pilot. It's unlikely that this will be the
case the next time around, when we go to the moon, not for a science
picnic, but to start (hopefully) a settlement.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll probably even have ready a name for the host site, our
new neighborhood, as distinct from the name of the outpost itself, e.g.
Pioneer Flats, Artemis Beach, New World Plain, Dawn Valley, etc. Perhaps
some of the names will reflect who donated how much cash to the
project.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing to remember is that no matter how much
individual pioneers and scouts may care, without a pre-agreed-upon and then
religiously pursued game of site management, chaos will inexorably insert
itself. Once allowed a chance to rule, chaos takes on a powerful life of
its own. Witness McMurdo Sound in Antarctica, before Greenpeace
photographers shamed us before ourselves and all the world. Compare cities
that have grown up with a reference master plan and those (Third World
villages-become-infrastructureless-megacities, and, to be fair, many a
European medieval city as well) that suddenly mushroomed like cancerous
weed patches. </P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Basic Principles</H4>

 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;An outpost is more than an architectural complex that we
are going to put there, snap its picture, and then leave as a monument. It
is presumably a nucleus from which long term "operations" will flow. These
operations will impact the site. We need to give as much thought to fitting
operations to site as we do to the design of the bent metal of the outpost
itself.</P>

 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it would be naive to assume we can
accurately pre-glimpse the full range of activities that will characterize
our lunar presence down the road, as base becomes outpost and outpost
becomes village and village becomes a settlement town. Our site management
philosophy and game plan must necessarily be amendable. What we need is
something to start from, a handbook of "how not to paint ourselves into a
corner." And that is not that tall an order.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps others will have something to add to this recipe for
a lunar beachhead site management masterplan, but at least a first stab at
it would seem to indicate we need to make room for the following: (a)
terrain to be left relatively undisturbed, for scenic and esthetic reasons;
(b) roadway approach corridors; (c) sites for auxiliary equipment (electric
power generation, heat rejection radiators, communications equipment,
spaceport, garaging of vehicles, etc.); (d) storage and warehousing of
surplus equipment, wastes and potentially recyclable trash, cannibalizable
packing & shipping materials; (e) areas where the regolith can be "mined"
for useful elements; (f) initial industrial park setaside; last but not
least, (g) vectors for expansion of the residential and other structural
parts of the outpost itself.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;As/if our presence expands by orders of magnitude, the site
plan for the perimeter of the base will have to give way to newer plans
that embrace ever larger and larger peripheral areas. No problem - if the
original plan has good genes.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Esthetic Zoning Protocols</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;While many a technician or scientist or engineer lucky
enough to be part of the original short-term crews may not care, the morale
both of those who will come for longer stays, and of the millions of
supporters at home who will peer over their shoulders electronically,
vistas out the windows of the outpost observation domes (or whatever) ought
to show both human (thoughtfully) transformed areas as well as broad
expanses of "magnificent desolation" that are minimally disturbed (or
restored). In planning the site, we need to be aware of what areas are in
sight from outpost "windows" and what areas will be within the horizons of
those coming and going between spaceport and outpost. We need to know which
areas of high ground will be broadly visible, as well as which areas will
be hidden from view of the window ports of either outpost or spaceport
coach. Some of this can hopefully be left in its undisturbed state,
visitable from sinter-paved walks or trails. Other parts of the perimeter,
necessarily disturbed in the base erection and deployment process, or in
base expansion, can be "restored," regraded and raked. Additional handsome
areas can be Japanese style sand and rock gardens, or sculpture gardens -
the start of uniquely lunan urban/rural "landscaping."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Scenic "easements" cannot be left for afterthought, even in
later expansion of the site. Making provision for them will not make
setting up our base or outpost any more expensive. It will simply require a
bit of timely patience.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;As mining operations begin, the availability of large
volumes of tailings for the creation of man-made hillocks or embankments to
shield storage and equipment areas from casual view will create new
options. That we are fairly certain such activities and opportunities will
develop, we can take the availability of tailings into consideration in
devising the scenic provisions and easements of our overall site plan and
its subsequent revision as the base-to-settlement unfolds itself.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus we will have both natural and human-landscaped areas.
For either, the availability of cleared boulders, shards and other debris
becomes so many opportunities for the lunar landscape architect. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunar "parklands" and scenic preserves need to be part of
every expansion of the radius of operations. With such a philosophy,
travelers, visitors, and vacationers will never need to be assaulted with
the ugly exposed entrails of our industrializing impact on our adoptive new
home world.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Storage and warehousing areas, mining and industrial can be
out of sight behind scarps, crater walls, ridges (natural or manmade),
hills, berms, in lava tubes, under ramada sheds, etc. The same goes for power
generation, heat rejection, and other necessary systems, <I>unless
architecturally complementary</I> to the moonscape. After all, we will needto be <I>visually reassured</I> of the presence of both the technical and
biospheric support eco-systems for maintenance of our presence on this, of
itself, alien world. We need to see both the undisturbed beauty, and
evidence that we are supported in our needs. The point is that the latter
need not be presented chaotically and in disordered fashion. A basic set of
esthetic zoning protocols will do the trick. The up-front cost will be
minimal. Down the road, such foresight may become a definite economic
plus.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of lunar "landscaping" should be taken seriously by
Earthside supporters with ready creative instincts and experience. We can't
go around planting "evergreens" or other trees, bushes, and flower beds.
But we can do something analogous, assist in the "blooming" of the lunar
soil, by bringing into being various human-midwived extrusions of surface
materials. This is not so unlike what Nature does as it brings out various
life-midwived extrusions of the geological elements on our own planet. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;With mining tailings and other material leftover from road
grading, cutting passes through ridges or crater walls, etc. it will not be
impossible to create what until now have only been fantasy mountainscapes
of craggy peaks, etc. In lieu of flower beds, we can boulevard or
"tree-line" our main settlement approaches with crystal glass snowflakes,
ceramic stalagmites, and other roadside sculptures meant to be panned in
passing. Roads can also be curbed with split and possibly polished breccias
and other lunar "rocks" displaced in the grading process. Nor are we stuck
with a palette of grays. We can whitewash with lime (Calcium Oxide) or with
Titanium Dioxide, even Aluminum Oxide. We can collect the iron-rich orange
soil found first at Shorty Crater, and more recently all over the place by
Clementine, and use it in concentrated form to give areas various tints
from rust to orange to cantaloupe. And a sprinkling of sulfur could
provide a yellow.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sculpture forests can be planned so that they take on whole
new aspects as the Sun slowly marches across the lunar dayspan skies.
Trees? Why we have already made trees of aluminum and aluminum foil for
Christmas time. Why not sculpture "trees" which are outgrowths not of life,
but of the inner potential of aluminum, iron, magnesium, and glass? They
could be made stiff and immutable, but why not also with fairy gossamer
"leafage" to flutter in the "breeze" of changing sunlight angles and mutual
shading interference. "Trees" and "bushes" can be modular in construction
using controlled "natural" randomization to vary size and branching
patterns and nature-like deviations from symmetry. They could be laden with
glass prism fruit to cast an everchanging pattern of rainbow colors. Let
your imagination soar. This won't happen all at once, but give it time!</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, UV and neon lighting will eventually be lunar
supportable options. Even passive electrofluorescent lighting, driven by
the sun angle and/or occasional solar flares - to give an ever changing
ambiance - is a possibility.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Road embankments can be dressed with cast basalt or ceramic
tiles with various textures and designs. "Pebbledash" panels are also a
simple option.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In short the resources of the future lunar "landscaper" know
few bounds. The point is leaving thoughtfully saved zones and sectors for
him or her to give creative expression.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Other Zoning Protocols</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, in our article on "Dust Control" [MMM #89 pp.
5-6] we discussed the wisdom of sintering (lightly fusing the surface
grains to a load-appropriate depth) aprons around airlocks, and of
sinter-paving areas of regular traffic (roads) and areas of regular,
routine activity such as areas where exterior systems are placed, or
exposed or sheltered "lee" space storage areas for items needed on a
frequent basis - the purpose being simply dust control. This can be
guaranteed by carefully drawn up zoning protocols and guidelines.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Storage and Warehousing Protocols</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We will discuss this topic at length in the article that
follows. The old adage, "a place for everything and everything in its
place" is the guiding philosophy we must devotedly pursue if we are to keep
chaos at bay. Do not provide each category with a storage place of its own
and voila, you have instant unrecoverable disaster, a good example of which
is the Manifesto office where this is being written.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Growth Vectors - the Site Plan</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;While surely we will add new modules to the original outpost
complex, it is unlikely that, as we move from outpost to pre-settlement
village, and then on to settlement town, that we will just keep adding on.
We may want to identify areas of the surrounding moonscape for starting
afresh, for example, once we are able to use made-on-site building
materials to take care of the bulk of our expansion needs. In time the
original imported outpost transplanted from factories on Earth may be
decommissioned and transferred to other uses: a spartan "hotel" for early
visitors, or preserved "as is" as an "historic park."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Any new "village" or "town" needs to have a plan for
expanding residential, agricultural, commercial, industrial, service,
educational, administrative and other zones, properly separated, properly
intertwined and interspersed, neighborhood after neighborhood, as we grow.
We certainly do not need to set out from Earth with such a City Plan
already brainstormed in detail. We simply need to be armed with a plenary
set of principles, if even in library form.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Exclave Concessions</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not think of the moonbase site as encompassing a
single contiguous area of set radius from our starter outpost. Depending on
the legal regime(s) that may apply, our "concession" or "charter" may
designate a fairly generous radius, more and more of which we will occupy
and transform as time goes on.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But if we are to move in the direction of providing for an
ever larger portion of our material needs as well as export potential
through the use of resources indigenous to the moon, then we may want/need
to range further afield to access special deposits of minerals not found
within the original site radius.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If we pick a "coastal" site, astride a boundary between
highland and mare terrain, this will give us immediate access to the two
major regolith soil groups. But we will still need to have access to KREEP
(potassium, rare earth elements, and phosphorus) deposits such as those<P>


represented in the splash-out from the formation of the Mare Imbrium (Sea
of Rains) basin over three billion years ago. Central peaks of larger
craters represent a fourth suite of minerals. And then we may find 
Sudbury-like astroblemes rich in asteroid-impact-donated lodes of iron, 
nickel, and more importantly, copper.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus we will need to set up "Exclave Concessions" as welland provide and maintain traffic corridors to such out-sources as well as
to other destinations like additional (rival or secondary supportive or
dependent) outposts and settlements. Each will need its own Site Management
Plan.</P>

Warehousing</H2><P align=center>
Avoiding Chaos takes a Strategic Master Plan
</P><HR WIDTH=80%>

<H3><FONT SIZE=2>by <A HREF="MAILTO:kokhMMM@execpc.com">Peter Kokh</a></FONT></H3>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Inbound Storage</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;From the very outset, in the first days when the lunar
outpost is little more than a very elite group home, it will make rewarding
sense to have in place a system of keeping track of everything. Pressurized
storage space will be at a premium, woefully inadequate. It will be
necessary even from day one to begin using the seemingly endless outvac as
closet, attic, basement, shed, garage, and warehouse.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be stuff coming in from Earth, hopefully faster
than it can be used - reserves. Reserve hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon
(possibly in the easier to store form of methane, CH<FONT SIZE=1>4</FONT>,
and ammonia, NH<FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT>). Other volatiles and industrial
reagents where necessary in the various processing operations. Volatiles,
gasses and liquids, will be stored in tanks, and the beachhead site will
sport a growing "tank farm" from the first or second landing onwards.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be co-imports: packing / crating materials,
hopefully strategically made from cannibalizable materials that will become
essential as lunar industry gets started in earnest and begins
diversifying: copper and brass; stainless steel; polyethylene and
polyurethane and other easy-to-remold polymer materials. ("Stowaway
Imports," Back Issues reference <a href="#warehouse">above</a>).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be equipment, lots of it. Capital machinery to
carry on early mining, materials processing, manufacturing and fabrication
operations; equipment needed to set up electric <a href="/adb/04/03/03/">power generation</a> and
thermal equilibrium maintenance; equipment needed for <a href="/adb/04/03/05/consumable-reduction.html">recycling wastes</A>.</P>

 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many an item on ship manifests will need at least temporary
storage outside. Where? First, of course, there will be an off-loading area
at the humble spaceport. From there, it will be logical to move items to
staging areas near where they will be used in industry, agriculture,
construction, etc.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Byproduct Storage</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The next broad classification of items needing storage will
be that of byproducts of human activities on the moon. Mining and
processing operations will produce veritable mountains of "tailings." As
these may be enriched sources of yet other elements, not yet processed, it
make strategic sense not to lump all tailings together but keep separate
those from each separate type of processing and ore beneficiation
operation. Those tailings not especially enriched in anything, can, along
with regolith moving surplus loads be used in landscaping operations as
suggested above.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturing byproducts and quality control rejects should
be carefully sorted each kind from the rest, against the day when they will
become valuable feedstocks for industrial processes and entrepreneurial
endeavors not yet begun, even not yet imagined.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Canisters of human fecal wastes can be stored in permashade
where they will remain frozen and inert, against the day when they may be
an invaluable source of fertilizer in food production and agriculture in
general. Prior to storage, these wastes could spend some time in quartz
covered trays in full dayspan sunlight, allowing solar ultraviolet to
sterilize them thoroughly and effectively.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, "miscellaneous" garbage and trash need to be stored
in sorted form according to the nature of their primary and secondary
recyclable content. If there has to be some residual Miscellaneous Storage
Area, a catch-all for everything we cannot yet see a need for, then,
nonetheless, each item needs description, qualification, and recording. As
a master computer program senses a building accumulation of a particular
type of material or stuff not yet separately stored, a new distinct storage
area can be set aside, and we will know just where to get everything that
can be moved thereto.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;How? We use the Double Entry Barcoding Inventory system
devised for Mir by John Voigt of Lakeshore Computers in Cleveland, WI. Each
item is given a barcode, as is each storage location. As an item is stored,
its barcode and that of its location are read as a pair. Nothing ever gets
lost anymore.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Production inventory - Items awaiting export</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Early export products will include liquid lunar oxygen, LOX
or LUNOX for short, and possibly other fuels such as Silane, SiH<FONT
SIZE=1>4</FONT>, both mainly for rocket fuel. These can be stored in the
tank farms. If we practice "primage" (every time we move regolith, in road
building or construction we heat the soil to extract the precious
volatiles), we will begin accumulating gasses that may be useful someday:
hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen; garden variety helium and helium-3; neon,
argon, krypton, and xenon. Someday these gasses will be the feedstocks of
new industries, the springboard for a second wave of lunar
industrialization and diversification. If need be, the primage extract can
be stored as an undifferentiated brew, leaving separation of the various
gasses for a later effort.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Maintaining Quality of Stored Product</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be wise to protect some of these stored materials
under ramparts or shed-canopies, to protect them, not from the vacuum, but
from attack from the lunar skies: UV, cosmic rays and solar flares,
micrometeorites, and bi-monthly shock of alternating thermal extremes.
Periodic tests should show if any degradation is operating, and accordingly
if some items should be depreciated with storage age. Conversely, economic
conditions and new entrepreneurial, industrial, and export opportunities,
as well as import difficulties could work to appreciate the value of many
items.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some stores we may want out of sight. Yet an orderly storage
yard in full sight, as an eloquent testimony of thoughtful
self-providence, may be very reassuring, In contrast, the sight of a
storage area in helter skelter chaos would be rather disquieting, let alone
an eyesore. The yardmaster's job will be important. It is a job that must
be filled, filled with the best.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>A Lavatube - the ultimate warehouse</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lavatubes, of whose existence we are confident from indirect
evidence (rilles with natural bridges, strings of rimless collapse pits,
analogy from terrestrial shield volcanoes made of similarly non-viscous
lava), and whose likely scale and size dwarfs known Earthside analogs,
present themselves as ideal warehouses. They keep everything out of sight
and out of harm's way from the celestial elements.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;They may not be used for that capacity right away, however,
because it would seem that access could present some initially discouraging
obstacles. We may need to either erect industrial elevators or grade
negotiable access ramps down rough and rugged talus slopes from cave-in
entrances. Yet certainly, their great volume and its weather-free character
will guarantee their use for storage as soon as they can be found and
access provided.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"A place for everything, and everything in its place." It's
not just for closets and desks anymore! It's a philosophy that will bode
well for our future on the moon, if we abide by it, providing an eventual
industrial and entrepreneurial bonanza. Equally it is a philosophy which
will spell out our sentence, if we give it but lip service. We can look at
it as a sort of "Real Accounts" ledgers, in which we are dealing with real
items, not just financial values.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the operative condition is that we start such
housekeeping practices from day one, for, as we have warned, chaos, once it
has its foot in the door, takes on a life of its own, setting up conditions
from which it will be extremely difficult to recover.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;For sake of best long-shadow lighting conditions as well as
heat management, all the Apollo missions landed shortly after local
sunrise, and as if subconsciously frightened senseless of nightfall, left
well before local noon. We haven't come close to experiencing a whole lunar
dayspan/nightspan cycle! Here are the figures for each mission.</P>

<P align="center">Sunrise to Sunset is 354.367 hrs or 14.7653 days<BR>Full Sunth (local

<P ALIGN=center><IMG WIDTH=244 HEIGHT=181  ALT="Apollo Landing Time Comparison Chart"
SRC="090land.gif"></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a pattern similar to early sorties to Antarctica.
There, we came after the spring pack-ice breakup and left well before the
fall freezeup - for the first two decades. It wasn't until Byrd set up
Little America in 1929 [a site abandoned 30 years later in '59 as U.S.
Antarctic operations concentrated on McMurdo Sound] that we took the plunge
and "overwintered." That was quite some hurdle, mentally and emotionally,
as well as operationally and logistically. Now we face the same hurdle on
the moon. But until we do it, all our talk of "permanent presence" is just
so much empty macho bravado.</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Little America, the major hurdles to be
overcome were the need to build up during the summer months enough fuel
(heat, power, and vehicles) and food reserves to last the long cold winter
night months when resupply would be impossible. Rescue would also be
impossible, meaning medical supplies and kits had to be more adequate, and
medical personnel more fully trained. On the moon the challenge will be
similar although the nightspan is only a twelfth as long.</p>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Thermal management</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Surface temperatures drop drastically and quickly after
lunar sunset. But, these are surface effects only. The powdery soil is a
poor conductor, and a poor reservoir, of either heat or cold. A couple of
meters down, below the blanket of shielding soil, temperatures remain about
-4&#176; F or -20&#176; C all the time.</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Most expect a heat buildup within the buried habitat, heat
from living, heat from operations, that will not be drawn off by the
surrounding soil as fast as it is generated - even at night. If an equation
of heat inputs and losses shows a net heat rise even during nightspan, a
system of external heat-shedding radiators will be necessary.</p> <IMG
WIDTH=242 HEIGHT=97 ALT="Heat Sink Diagram"ALIGN=RIGHT
SRC="090heatsink.gif"> <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If, however, because available power
during nightspan means powered down operations, and if that in turn means a
thermal deficit during nightspan, then some sort of thermal heat sink
accessed by a heat pump might not be a bad idea. We'll have, or should
have, the former - in the form of water reserves. A large reserve tank can
be buried in the soil not far from the habitat. Heat from the water would
be pumped into the habitat by nightspan, the direction reversed for dayspan
cooling. A net heat excess over the whole dayspan/nightspan cycle would
then be shed by external radiators. </p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If we don't bring along, find, or generate (i.e. adding
hydrogen to locally produced oxygen, probably in fuel cells to produce
night power and water both), enough water to make such a heat-pump
accessible water reservoir work, then our plans to make our presence
"permanent" are in big trouble.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful thermal management will depend largely on how
much care is taken to isolate major heat-producing activities from the
habitat areas. This means automated unpressurized processing and
manufacturing plants, saving low temperature aspects of production
(finishing, assembly, etc.) for occupied areas.</p>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Nightspan Power</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many suggest solving the nightspan power problem by bringing
along a small nuclear power unit. Even if the legal and political hurdles
can be overcome (e.g. by having the Russians contribute this system), the
point is missed. No matter how big the nuke, there will still be less power
available during nightspan than during dayspan for the simple reason that
during the latter, the Sun also shines, its heat ready to do work - simply
and cheaply.</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sun can provide nightspan power in these ways:</p><OL Type=a>

<li><P>Solar heat can be used via several processes to produce oxygen from
moon rock by dayspan. During nightspan this oxygen is combined with
hydrogen brought from Earth, in fuel cells, to produce power - with pure
potable water as the byproduct.</P>

<li><P>If necessary, solar power can also be used during dayspan to
electrolyze a portion of the water reserves back into hydrogen and oxygen
for nightspan fuel cell fuel. (In addition, the Sun's raw ultra-violet rays
can help purify the remaining water reserves under cover of UV-transparent
quartz.)</P>

<LI><P>If there is an early cast basalt industry to provide paving blocks
and other low performance items useful to the expanding base, possibly as a
sideline to oxygen production through heating the moon rock, this would
open another road for Sun and water to work synergistically to provide
nightspan power. If during dayspan, when the solar concentrators power
these industries, there builds up an excess residual pool of molten rock
and this is kept shielded from the heat-sucking night sky in an underground
reservoir, the residual heat of this "magma pool" can be tapped to produce
steam to run the base's nightspan generators. This is the idea of LUNAX
director David Dunlop. A refractory lining of aluminum oxide would make
such a magma-pool reservoir more efficient, but might not be absolutely
necessary.</P></OL>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Reiff of General Space Corporation suggests another
form of lunar heat pump. If vibro-accoustic testing locates a relatively
small underground void (cavern) near the surface (less than 100 feet), this
can be accessed by drilling. The natural reservoir can then be filled with
a thermally conductive material (he suggests smelting regolith into molten
aluminum). The thermal properties of the available material should drive
the purity requirements. The material would be allowed to reach an
equilibrium (cool). Next you would set up a thermal dynamic generator
(Sterling cycle would work good) with your heat source on one end and the
newly created heat sink connected to the other. You could shade the
generator and the top of the heat sink to even provide power by dayspan
too. [Smelting aluminum, however, is not likely to be an early outpost
technology - Ed.]</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sun and water, then, seem to be the simple and elegantbasic ingredients for a nightspan power system (as well as maintaining
thermal equilibrium). Elaborate and expensive plans for providing nightspan
power (or maintaining thermal equilibrium) by other higher tech means seem
foolish.</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The division of labor into hot in-vacuum and cool in-habitat
chores (see above) in order to assist in thermal management will also work
neatly to separate man-hours into energy-intensive dayspan aspects and
labor-intensive nightspan aspects of the total production and operations
cycles.</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have suggested that this fortnightly change of pace will
become a well-liked feature of lunar life. Some have seen it as a burden to
be avoided. Do not forget that on the moon there are no seasons, no daily
changes of weather, both of which add spice and interest and renewal to
living on Earth. If this nightspan power "deficit" were ever to be
effectively eliminated, the biggest source of rhythm and change of pace
would be gone with it. Productivity gains would be temporary as morale
slowly plummeted from routine, boredom, ennui.</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Other nightspan power solutions frequently proposed are well
down the road, something for later generation advanced settlements to
consider. These include solar power satellites, lunar solar array networks
(one over the nearest pole makes the most sense as it would be in sunlight
whenever the outpost is experiencing nightspan), <a target="_top"
href="/adb/02/09/he3-intro.html">helium-3</a> fusion plants, and, oh yes,
lunar hydroelectric.</p>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Air/water/waste management</H4>

 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overnighting will also require much more capable recycling
systems than did missions only intended to spend a couple of days on the
morning Sun lit surface. Some water recycling chores can be solar-operated,
as suggested above. By nightspan, used water could simply accumulate; or,
freezing (by sky exposure) could work to separate out some impurities.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Human solid wastes could be stored out-vac, left to freeze
in shaded sanitary containers. Rather than be a problem for eventual
disposal, such compostable organics-rich material will become a banked
resource of great value for the eventual commencement of regolith-soil
based agriculture, once creation of significantly cheaper pressurized
expansion volume becomes possible using on-site produced building
materials.</p>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Other "Overnighting" Needs</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan as we will to stock up by dayspan for a dayspan-only
logistics operation of resupply and manpower relief from Earth, we will be
prudent to allow for the possibility of night landings and launches. Once
we can land on a dime using signal clues rather than visual ones, this
should be no big deal. It does mean, however, that the outpost's
"spaceport" be more than a simple designated circle in the sand. It will
need to be equipped with beacons and lights and radio.</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;For this and who knows how many other contingencies, a
service vehicle that can operate at night is also a must. This means more
than headlights. It means power supplies, motive systems, and lubricants
that can withstand temperatures of -200&#176; F or -130&#176; C with no
problem.</p>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Overnighting Measures, a Test of Outpost Design</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Any approach to lunar outpost design, NASA/International or
commercial, in which every aspect does not reflect the needs of
"overnighting" begs to fail. If you are honest, you will realize that some
of the above capacities are not self-obvious if you conveniently ignore the
fact that some time after your base setup landing, the Sun will set, and
stay set for almost fifteen days, over and over again every sunth,
forever.</p>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:boise@asi.org">Boise Pearson</a>, President,
Artemis Society International</Font>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning with the issue you hold in your hands, members of the
Artemis Society are in for a real treat. In order to provide our members with
news and information on a regular basis, and to increase the quality and quantity
of lunar colonization material that lands in your mailbox, we have decided to
offer Moon Miners' Manifesto as a membership benefit. Our newsletter, Pleiades,
has become the Artemis section of MMM.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me apologize for the intermittent nature of Pleiades in the
past. The excitement of a project to put men (and perhaps you, one day soon) on
the moon helped the Society membership to grow faster than we could keep up with.
One of the areas we had the most trouble with was regular publication of a
newsletter to keep our members updated and supplied with information on the
Project. This arrangement with the publishers of MMM will ensure that we can
handle our current membership, and provide for our future growth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantages of this new arrangement to everyone involved are
numerous. Members of <a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html" target="_top">Artemis Society International</a> will receive this publication regularly,
something we have had trouble with in the past. The Lunar Reclamation Society,
publishers of MMM, will begin their tenth year of continuous publication this
December. This issue represents nine years of insightful articles and editorials
on a multitude of subjects related to successful colonization of our nearest
neighbor. ASI members will now become a part of this ongoing effort. I think you
will be pleased at the quality and insightfulness that has been the hallmark of
MMM over the past nine years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We are excited to be combining forces with organizations whose
goals are similar to ours. This exposure to ideas from many corners of the Lunar
community can only help to stimulate the creativity and action that is needed to
put us back on the moon, this time to stay.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We welcome your comments and suggestions and submissions as we
start off with this new publication. <a Href="mailto:boise@asi.org">Let us
know</a> what you would like to see in future issues. We will be handling the
editing for the ASI section of each issue here at ASI. Send your comments to MMM,
c/o ASI, PO Box 4878, Huntsville, AL 35815.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Enjoy the rest of the issue!!</P>

About the Artemis Society
</H2><P><font size=2><P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>NOTE: This has been modified from its origional form to reflect changes in membership structure.</font></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Artemis Society is a non-profit organization dedicated to
conducting educational, technical, legal, and financial activities to encourage
the establishment of a self-supporting permanent human presence on the moon. The
primary focus of the Artemis Society is the <a href="/index.html" target="_top">Artemis Project</a>, a lunar base project described in the following
article.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're serious about wanting to live on the moon, you want to
<a href="/asi_member.html" target="_top">join the Artemis Society</a>. The
Society was formed in August 1994 to provide a way for everyone to participate
directly in building the lunar base project. Less than 5% of the work needs to be
done by rocket scientists, so you can make a significant contribution to your
future in space even if you don't have a PhD in astronautics. There are thousands
of things you can do to help, so whatever your interests are, the project has a
fun way you can contribute your time and talent to making it happen.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently in the process of forming various Technical
Committees to start organizing and coordinating all of the fun people have been
having with the project for the last year. These Committees will be groups of
Artemis Society members and members of similarly focused organizations actively
working to put this project together. We encourage all of our members to contact
one of the Committees (or look into starting one yourself) to have fun lending
their time and talents to putting us back on the moon. Look for more information
on the Committees in this and future issues.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Several <a href="/adb/07/local-chapters.html"
target="_top">local groups</a> are forming to provide members in local areas an
opportunity to get together and work on some aspect of the project, or just meet
other people who are working toward the same goals. Those of you interested in
joining or starting a local chapter of the Artemis Society should contact ASI at
PO Box 4878, Huntsville, AL 35815.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a look at the <a href="/asi_member.html" target="_top">membership</a> that ASI currently offers. Send membership correspondence
to ASI at PO Box 4878, Huntsville, AL 35815; please make checks payable to

About the Artemis Project
</H2><P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>


<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>The Project</H4>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Artemis Project is a privately financed commercial
venture to establish a permanent, manned lunar base and to exploit the
resources of the moon for future development of space travel. The first
Artemis flight places a habitat on the moon for permanent occupation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The goals of the project are to build a permanent manned
base on the moon, to exploit lunar resources for profit, to demonstrate
that manned space flight is within the reach of private enterprise, and to
bootstrap private industry into manned space flight. Artemis is unique
among proposals for developing a moon base because it is a 100% privately
financed commercial venture which will place the first element of the lunar
base on the moon within the next decade, and because it will show a profit
from the first flight to the moon.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Costs, Revenues, and Financing</H4>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous moon base studies have based their cost models on
the performance of government projects and assumed revenues would come only
after decades of development. The resulting high capital costs and long
term before realizing any profit made it impossible for private enterprise
to finance a manned space venture; but by using standard commercial
business practices, costs can be reduced to less than 10% of a similar
government-sponsored program. Additionally, Artemis reduces its costs by
using technology and resources already developed in previous manned space
flight programs.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current estimate for the cost of the first flight is
about $1.3 billion. This level of investment is quite common in the
business world. For example, one new deep-water oil rig typically costs
about one billion dollars.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Artemis will pay for its initial development by exploiting
the <a target="_top" href="/adb/03/04/">entertainment value</a> of the first flights. We
estimate the market value of the first flight from all sources to be
significantly higher than its cost.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the first mission must be manned; the
entertainment value of a robotic flight is not sufficient to pay the bills.
The estimated revenues are based on comparisons to similar mass-marketing
ventures which tie movies or television shows in with associated products.
The Apollo program was run with engineering precision, its drama hidden by
the need for a government agency to present an unflagging image of
confidence to the world. In contrast, The Artemis Project is designed to
be entertaining from the start. With half a dozen science fiction writers
already working on the project, we should be able to attain that goal and
still retain the appeal which sets the project apart from science fiction
productions - the Artemis Project is real.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, we plan to pay for the initial stages of the
project through shameless commercialism.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Reference Mission</H4>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The reference mission is being used in the current
feasibility study to determine costs, revenues, and technical and political
issues. Two <a target="_top" href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/shuttle.html">Space Shuttle</a>
launches put the Artemis hardware into low Earth orbit, where the moon
vehicle is assembled. Our crew goes up on the second Shuttle flight. The
space station is used as a staging base in the reference mission. If it is
not available, we launch the first element on one flight and then
rendezvous with it on the next flight. In that case our crew uses the
Shuttle as a staging base for assembling the Artemis spacecraft.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a target="_top" href="/adb/04/02/01/ltv-notes.html">lunar transfer
vehicle</a> is a small spaceborne habitat with propulsion systems and
support for the crew during flight between Earth and Lunar orbits. Its
rockets are used to fly to lunar orbit. The reference mission uses a
trajectory almost identical to the Apollo flights.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Lunar Transfer Vehicle</H4>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon arrival in lunar orbit, the lunar base core module with
its descent rockets separates from the lunar transfer vehicle and lands on
the surface of the moon using a propulsion package attached to the core
module's pressurized habitat. The lunar transfer vehicle remains in lunar
orbit, unmanned, while the crew descends to the surface.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target="_top" href="/adb/04/01/01/04/day-01.html">On the moon</a>, the
crew levels the lunar base habitat and reconfigures the lunar base for
permanent operation. The crew conducts extravehicular activity to assay the
site and gather samples of the lunar regolith (moon dirt). They film
activities throughout the flight, both stock footage and scripted scenes
for later use in movies and documentaries.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Ascent Stage</H4>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;When surface activities are complete, the crew boards the
ascent stage and makes the two-hour flight to rendezvous with the orbiting
lunar transfer vehicle. The ascent stage is a simple, open vehicle, so crew
members depend on their space suits for life support. Except for not being
able to quickly return to base in an emergency, the hazards to the crew
during ascent are no greater than two hours outside on the moon's
surface.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;After docking the ascent stage to the LTV, the crew returns
to Earth, where they use their rockets to enter Earth orbit for a
rendezvous with the space station. They leave the transportation system in
orbit for use on later flights to lower the cost of future development. The
lunar transfer vehicle may be used at the space station for additional
laboratory space between flights, or it may be leased for other operations
in Earth orbit. After the Artemis vehicles have been secured at the space
station, the crew returns to Earth on the next available Shuttle
flight.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the crew goes home, a <a
target="_top" href="/adb/04/02/05/">telerobot</a> is used to bury the core module in moon
dirt for thermal insulation as well as protection from radiation and
meteoroids. The robot may also be able to get camera footage of the Artemis
stack's initial descent to the lunar surface. This will be first time any
vehicle has been recorded landing on the moon.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>"Artemis"</H4>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in the project, we decided to go back to the tradition
of using names from ancient mythology for manned space flight programs.
Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo carried human beings to the moon in less than
ten years, but manned space programs lost sight of their exploratory nature
and fell into lethargic bureaucracy when they adopted more pedestrian names
like Skylab, the Space Shuttle, and the Space Station.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target="_top" href="/Bio/artemis-bio.html">Artemis</a> is the twin
sister of Apollo in Greek mythology. She is the moon, and Apollo is the
Sun. Artemis is also the goddess of the hunt, a constant reminder that our
project is a voyage of exploration, a venture which will live off the land
in its travels and return products of great value to our home on Earth.</P>

<H2 align=center>Revisiting the Moon Buggy</H2><p align="center">Would lunar rovers left on the moon still be in working
condition when we return?</p><P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:bwaldin@aol.com">Bryce Walden</a><BR>
[response to a screenwriter's question on America OnLine, reprinted in MMM with
permission]<BR></FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;General contractor for the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) was Boeing;
GM Delco made the electronics. The LRV was first used on Apollo 15 at Hadley
Rille, and in all subsequent missions. The chassis was aluminum. The essential
"buggy" massed 400-600 lbsm (pounds-mass) (180-270 kilograms) depending on
equipment. It could carry equipment, astronauts, and payload up to 1100 lbsm (499
kilograms), more than twice its own weight. Yet it was not strong enough to hold
the astronauts on Earth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Top speed mentioned by my source was 14 kph (8.7 mph); the
speedometer was calibrated 0-20 kph (0-12.4 mph). Average speed on all three
missions using the LRV was 5.17 mph (9.1 kph). Average for Apollo 17 was 5.0 mph
(8.0 kph), total distance travelled was 22.3 miles (35.9 kilometers), and total
time driving was 4:26 hours.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Power was supplied by 2 silver-zinc batteries, each 36v, 121
amp-hours per battery, encased in magnesium, then enclosed by thermal blankets
and dust covers. Each battery had a relief valve for protection against excessive
internal pressure. Thermal control was critical: the batteries had to be
maintained between 40&#176; F (4&#176; Celsius) and 125&#176; F (52&#176;
Celsius). The only practical method of heat rejection in the vacuum was by
thermal radiation. Unfortunatly, the slightest amount of lunar dust on the
radiators (essentially mirrors) would "effectively destroy" their ability to
perform. For this reason the radiators were kept closed during activities, to be
opened manually by astronauts after "parking" for the "night." "During operation,
heat generated was stored in heat sinks consisting of two LRV batteries and tanks
containing wax-like phase change material." According to Gene Cernan and Jack
Schmitt, "If you take a couple more batteries up there, that thing would just
keep going...."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these guys aren't Moon Buggy Mechanics. Other astronauts
have been known to say the buggy had used up all warrantees by the end of the
mission (5 days or 250,000 miles....). Besides the batteries, the flexible spline
inside each wheel hub, part of the kinetic power transmission system, may have
degraded. Countless thermal cycles of the vehicle between lunar day (+250&#176;
F, 121&#176; Celsius) and lunar night (-250&#176; F, -157&#176; Celsius) will
take their toll on structural elements, electronics, and other system parts.
There is also the possibility of radiation damage to the control electronics. Of
course, it might work, for a little while -- perhaps a heroic last gasp. With
fresh batteries, of course. That overpressure release probably let vital elements
escape as the batteries heated to lunar daytime temperatures.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;One other interesting note is that the LRV had an inertial
navigation device that always pointed toward the LEM (bearing and distance), so
the astronauts would not have to guess, in the austere and misleading lunar
environment (ever taken a walk in the desert?), the quickest way back to the
base. They also did not have to stay in sight of the LEM.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunar rover data and quotes are from "The Lunar Roving Vehicle: A
Historical Perspective" by Saverio F. Morea, Director, Research and Technology
Office, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Alabama, where the LRV was tested. The
paper was presented at the second Lunar Bases and Space Activities of the 21st
Century conference, April 5-7 1988, Houston TX. Contribution No. LBS-88-203.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, I don't think we should depend on or plan to use
any of the one-shot equipment sent up with Apollo. I prefer the idea of fencing
it off and preserving these first explorations as well as possible. We should be
sensitive to other sites of interest, as well.</p>

Mir-20 (call sign 'Uran') Cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko, Sergei Avdeyev and Thomas
(DF4TR / DP0MIR) Reiter will be appearing in the midwest evening skies Oct. 15th
to Nov. 6th, '95, returning to morning skies Nov. 19th to Dec. 6th.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Amateur radio operators can log into the Mir 'Packet' (R0MIR-1)
BBS on 145.550MHz simplex or 435.775MHz uplink / 437.775 downlink MHz. The
cosmonauts also use the freq. 145.200MHz up, 145.800MHz down or 435.725MHz up,
437.925MHz down or 145.550Mhz simplex to talk with amateur radio operators on the
ground during their off-hours.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;For exact times and locations to see the space station over your
backyard call MN MIRWATCH Coordinator Ben Huset at (612) 639-9109. Look for more

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>"Greetings from 400 km above the Earth."</H4> 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's hard to find words for this incredible view. I mean - it's
like ... it's indescribable. We are in the moment over the ocean. The view is
magnificent. The station is oriented now perpendicular to the Earth's
surface.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first EVA of an ESA Astronaut falls together nicely with the
Ministerial Conference. It is an excellent sign for the future and I really hope,
in the middle of Earth and Sky, that there lots of European Astronauts will
follow to lead to our participation in the international Space Station
Program.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many greetings from here."<BR> [Thomas Reiter after leaving the
MIR Station for his first space walk on Friday October 20th, '95 (flight day
48)]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Though not a first for Europe, this was the first space sortie by
an ESA astronaut (Jean-Loup Chretien of the French national space agency, CNES,
had already taken a spacewalk outside Mir, back in 1988).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The two space walkers, Avdeyev and Reiter exited the station
through the airlock hatch in the KVANT-2 module at 12:55 CET. Thomas was almost
overwhelmed by the impression of the free space. He said a few sentences in
English to document this remarkable event. The two crew members then moved over
to SPEKTR module of the station, where the ESEF facility is located. Four
experiment cassettes were installed on the facility and tested before the two
workers left the site to "walk" to a site with Russian experiments, where they
had to exchange some experiment cassettes. Sergei had a small video camcorder
mounted to his belly which took breathtaking pictures, played back to us after
they had returned to the interior of the station at 18:06 CET. The crew was
always ahead of their schedule and while rest periods had been planned for them
during the shadow phases (which occur once on every orbit) they worked and acted
almost all the time - the full moon gave them enough light to see.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Asked how they feel, by ground personnel after they had returned,
they replied they feel just fine - the only one that's tired would be Yuri
(Gidzhenko, the crew commander who remained inside, chasing around the station to
support them. The crew is in a very good mood and in excellent condition and
looking forward to "meet" their families on Saturday and of course will need
their "free" weekend.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas was a "guest" in the ministerial conference at Toulouse,
France, deciding about the future of Europe's Manned Space Flight - Involvement
in Space Station Alpha. He addressed the Ministers and spoke with them and a
press team. The conference has decided to participate in the Space Stationprogram - as you most likely have already got from the media. Needless to say,
that we are all very happy about that.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Spin Control: Recent production delays at the booster plant that
builds the Soyuz rockets have forced the launch delay of the Mir-21 crew and
nobody wants to pay the over time work required to meet the original launch date
of January 16, '96, yet nobody wants to say that. The European space agency (ESA)
released this statement: ESA Astronaut Thomas Reiter, on board the space station
MIR since 5 September 1995 for ESA's EUROMIR 95 mission, might have his record
breaking stay of 135 days extended by another 44 days. ESA and Russia are
currently negotiating this extension which would serve the interest of both
partners. For Russia, it would optimize the use of onboard resources, while it
would enable ESA at the same time to intensify and enlarge the scientific program
of EUROMIR 95. A final decision about the extension is expected for the end of
this month. (October)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;To clarify some points related to the extension: 
<OL>
<LI><P>The mission extension has been a possibility for some time, and was
discussed with Thomas Reiter before launch.</P>
<LI><P>The current crew will return to Earth in the SOYUZ capsule in which they
were launched. This can be done at any time. For instance in an emergency
immediate evacuation of the MIR station is possible.</P>
<LI><P>Upload of equipment and consumables to MIR is planned with a Progress
capsule in December '95.</P>
<LI><P>The extension to the science program is under investigation, and the
upload of additional equipment and consumables to support this program on the
December Progress flight is one of the topics of discussion to be held in Moscow
next week.</P>
</ol>

<h2><font size=2>

Director, Space Access Society</font></h2>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Space Access Update is Space Access Society's
when-there's-news publication. Space Access Society's goal is to promote
affordable access to space for all, period. We believe in concentrating our
limited resources at whatever point looks like yielding maximum progress
toward this goal.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, we think this means working our tails off trying
to get the government to build and fly a high-speed reusable rocket
demonstrator, one  or more "X-rockets", in the next three years, in order
to quickly build up  both experience with and confidence in reusable
Single-Stage To Orbit (SSTO)  technology.  The idea is to reduce SSTO
technical uncertainty (and thus  development risk and cost) while at the
same time increasing investor  confidence, to the point where SSTO will
make sense as a private commercial  investment.  We have reason to believe
we're not far from that point now.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our major current focus is on supporting the govern-ment's
fully reusable single-stage rocket technology programs, the low-speed DC-X,
and its high-speed followon the X-33 NASA/DOD/industry cooperative
project.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;With luck and hard work, we should see fully-reusable rocket
testbeds flying  into space repeatedly later this decade, and practical
orbital transport projects getting underway.  Join us, and help us make
this happen.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;To join Space Access Society or buy the SSTO/DC-X V 3.0
video we have for sale (Two hours, includes all eight DC-X flights, X-33,
DC-X and SSTO backgrounders, aerospike engine test-stand footage, plus
White Sands Missile Range DC-X pre and post flight footage) mail a check
to:</P>

<H2 align="center"><font size=5>Alternative Engines for X-33</font><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>[Space Access Update #55, cont'd]
</FONT></h2>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;[The severe drawbacks old SSMEs (Space Shuttle Main Engines)
and the powerful vested interests that work to favor their use nonetheless]
would [not] matter if alternatives to SSME weren't available, alternatives
possibly more suitable to the overall purposes of the X-33. We're
reasonably well-aquainted with two such liquid-oxygen/liquid-hydrogen (LOX/
LH2) engines.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Russian D-57</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;	The D-57 was designed as a high-energy upper stage engine.
Sea-level thrust is ~70,000 lbs, vacuum thrust ~90,000 lbs, reports onthrottleability vary. Engine weight is ~2100 lbs, giving a relatively poor
takeoff thrust-to-weight of 33:1 (SSME sea-level T:W is ~50:1) but
reportedly engine weight could be relatively easily shaved to yield takeoff
T:W of ~45:1.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Over thirty D-57s were built; reports on the number
currently available vary widely, but the Russians never throw anything
away...  Between six and eight D-57's could power an X-33 in the size range
currently contemplated.  Over 150 test-stand firings took place, with total
run time near ten hours. We've seen claims that D-57 is too prone to
explosive failure for X-33 use; we haven't seen the data on which those
claims are based.  We note that just about all rocket engines blow up a few
tests stands early in their test programs; such teething problems aren't
necessarily relevant to flight safety.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We don't assume D-57 is certain to be suitable for X-33; we
do recommend strongly that its suitability be thor-oughly explored as soon
as possible.  </P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Pratt & Whitney RL-10 Upgrade</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous sources indicate that the P&W RL-10 (a version of
which powers DC-X) can be relatively easily upgraded to 26,000 lbs thrust
sea-level, 35,000 lbs thrust vacuum, with total engine weight staying ~400
lbs, possibly less.  This would yield a sea-level T:W of 65:1, actually
better than SSME, though we should note both that this would be at
lower-than-SSME specific impulse ("Isp", effectively a measure of
fuel-efficiency) and that the more complex plumbing required for a
multi-RL-10 installation would offset some part of the weight saved.
Between 16 and 20 such upgraded RL-10's could power an X- 33 of the size
currently being contemplated.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The various modifications required for SSTO suitabi-lity
(increased chamber pressure, deep throttling, extendable nozzle) have
already been tested separately.  One option for an RL-10 powered X-33 in
the event of delays in upgraded RL-10 delivery could be initial flight test
using existing RL-10 versions and a reduced propellant load.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We recommend strongly that work on such an enhanced RL-10
begin ASAP. Even absent SSTO applications, numerous upper-stage
applications exist for a very similar (no deep throt-tling needed) engine.
We further recommend that DC-X style lean management, lean budget, and
tight schedule be applied to this effort.  There is neither time nor money
for business as usual.</P>

<H2 align="center"><font size=5>Not-Quite-Final DOD Appropriation<BR>
Has $25M For Reusable Rocket Work</font><BR><FONT SIZE=2>
[Space Access Update #59]</FONT></P></h2>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The House-Senate conference on the FY'96 Department of
Defense (DOD) Appropriation bill finished last week with $25 million for
reusable rocket work in support of X-33 at USAF Phillips Labs.  This is
less than we'd hoped for, given the late surge of support we've been seeing
in the Senate, but still $25 million more than the Administration
originally asked for.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The House had voted to authorize $100 M and appropriate $50
M, while the Senate version DOD funding bills had no reusable rocket
funding coming into the conference.  The new Senate support we've seen came
too late to add anything to the Senate versions, so we likely ended up with
$25 million by a straight splitting of the difference between the House's
$50 million and the Senate's zero. Chances are we'll do better here next
year. We've built some foundations.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;	Meanwhile, the House, in a surprising but not
unpre-cedented move, voted to reject this conference committee's overall
results at the end of last week. The rejection was over a variety of issues
-- Bosnia provisions, abortions in DOD hospitals, funding of additional
production for both the B-2 bomber and Seawolf attack subs -- none of these
issues SSTO related.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Likely what will happen is that a new conference will take
place, limited strictly to the controversies that sank this version.
Chances of our either gaining or losing anything from the current $25
million funding for DOD reusable rocket work are small.  We'll be keeping
an eye on things, of course.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Congress and the White House thrashed out a
six-week "Continuing Resolution", legal authority for the government to go
on spending more or less at the current rate until mid-November, despite
the start of Federal Fiscal Year 1996 on October 1st without a new budget
signed into law yet.  This is nothing unusual in recent years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The HUD, VA, and Independent Agencies (NASA) Appropriation
bill will be the second to last of over a dozen major appropriations bills
dealt with.  (The only appropriation after it on the list is for running
the District of Columbia.)  The critical-to-X-33 HUD, VA and IA conference,
last we heard, was scheduled for October 16th.  We'd guess this will slip a
bit more before everything's taken care of.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The main issue in this conference, as far as we're
concerned, is still getting the Senate's $63 million for X-33 accepted over
the House's $43 million.  The previous alerts on this matter still stand;
if you have a Senator or Representative on the HUD, VA, IA Appropriations
subcommittees and you haven't yet contacted them per recent Alerts, please
do so.  Just because the formal conference is delayed doesn't mean the
staffs aren't quietly working on the issues.		HV/SAS</P>

<H3>Unmentioned advantage of shelter hangars</H3> <P align=center>10/2/95</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;One advantage of sheds or hangars as described in your recent
article, "Shelter on the Moon" [MMM #88, page 4] is that they would seem ideal
for inflatables. Think of it.</P>

<UL type=circle>
<LI>no thermal stress;
<LI>no exposure to UV or cosmic rays
<LI>no exposure to solar flares
<LI>no exposure to micrometeorites
<LI>no shielding emplacement pressure surges or trauma dangers 
<LI>lee environment for deployment
<LI>easy maintenance and access to exterior surfaces of inflatables 
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem I see for not-directly-shielded inflatables is a
slow buildup of corrosive atomic oxygen; but this seems unlikely in a "lee"
environment.</P>

<H2 align=center>Expanding the Outpost</H2><P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:kokhmmm@execpc.com">Peter
Kokh</a></P></font>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The provident architect, in designing a building - be it a
residence, a factory, a school, an office, or a corporate headquarters -
will take into consideration the possible downrange need to expand. For if
the tenant of the premises prospers, the structured interior space of the
original construction may soon be outgrown. If no provision has been made
for easy and orderly expansion, the original site may have to be abandoned,
and a new facility built on adjoining or distant property.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much like the would-be architect using Lincoln Logs or Lego
blocks, and even more like the think-ahead Scrabble player, the architect
of the original lunar outpost will want to leave a number of opportunities
for expansion. His grounded options must provide for changing needs in a
flexible way. "Expand EZ" features will mean minimum disruption and
disturbance of, and other inconvenience to, ongoing operations.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the philosophy behind using multi-port nodes as
air-lock modules, for example. We don't have to give up a point of access
to expand. Spacing of such expansion/access nodes must also be considered.
The module or other pressurized space to be added may or may not be of
comparable size to the starter module or modules. If connecting ports are
arranged at angles to one another, as for example in a cross-T, hex,
octagonal or other radial pattern, this provides more sizing flexibility
than does an initial configuration with expansion ports arrayed side by
side.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Expansion ports should be indifferent to the nature of the
added space: hard-hulled payload bay sized modules brought up from Earth;
"telescoping" or otherwise unfolding hard-hull modules which allow more
usable volume; or inflatable structures. Of these, the cylinder can offer
the same or greater volume than the sphere for the same or lower height.
And the torus offers a more stable footprint as well as room for built-in
features in its "donut-hole" [cf. MMM #50, NOV '91, pp.6-8, "HOSTELS:
Lowering the Threshold to Lunar Occupancy: Part IV, Hostel-Appropriate
Architectures"]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We have recently touched on another topic which will greatly
affect the ease or difficulty of outpost expansion: the manner in which we
apply shielding mass made of regolith. If we apply it directly, a certain
amount of tedious, gingerly delicate, and messy excavation may be necessary
to expose the expansion point decided upon. If we apply our shielding
indirectly, as in a hangar shed arch roof over the outpost site, then this
shielding will not be in our way when we need to expand, and, as a bonus,
the workers effecting the expansion can work in a safer, radiation- and
micrometeorite-free "lee" vacuum under the hangar shed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The layout of the site must also be considered, and we won't
want to pick a site that unduly constricts opportunities for expansion with
too close scenic but in-the-way features like crater walls, rille
shoulders, scarps, etc.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Expansion for what?</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We will want to expand our outpost in a timely fashion to
provide together both more living space and more operations space. In
expanded living space will be additional private quarters for more crew,
more and better furnished common space, more recreational and leisure
space, more space for added life support and food production, even garden
space.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Expanded operations will include: exploration and
in-the-field prospecting, mining, material production, manufacturing,
expanded sample and product testing laboratory, product fabrication
facilities, inside storage, etc. Obviously, reason exists for considerable
expansion, stage by stage.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning for expansion must be flexible. Some of the things
we think we can do and do well enough on the moon may not work out or
present engineering and prerequisite difficulties may mandate putting them
off until later. Other unsuspected opportunities for useful and profitable
activity that can be supported early on will emerge. The exact sequence of
diversification into iron and steel, glass and glass composites, ceramics
and cast basalt, and lunar concrete, should be kept provisional and open to
unfolding realities of need and ability. Expansion must then be both
flexibly preplanned and opportunistic. This is in fact how things unfold on
Earth. It will be no different on the moon.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Addition of "Out-Facilities"</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially, the outpost will be quite compact and integral
with the only peripheral installations being solar arrays and radiators,
antennae, tank storage farms, the space pad, power generation and storage,
etc. But the time will soon come when we will want to move industrial
operations that have passed their field trials out of the 'incubator' space
within the original outpost complex into new, more spacious, and more
rationally designed industrial quarters more or less nearby. Such
industrial space may be connected to the outpost by a pressurized corridor
tube or "cunnicula" of some sort, or it may be accessed, also in shirt
sleeves, by a docking personnel transport coach. However, if the facility
uses a lot of raw materials "mined" at some distance, the whole industrial
operation might better be placed at a suitable site handier to the
source.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Another unconnected complex likely to arise early on is a
"Port Operations" facility at the moon base spacepad site, as the pace of
expansion increases and with it the amount and frequency of traffic between
base and Earth and/or Earth orbit. Additional "exclaves" may be at an
astronomical observatory installation within logistical support range of
the outpost, and even a sort of getaway recreational retreat, say on the
scenic rim of a large not-too-hard-to-reach crater or rille. 'Androgynous'
dock-locks will make such actually separate installations functionally
contiguous allowing easy, safe, and comfortable passage from one to the
other. Keeping pace with all this will be an expanding road network,
reworked as need be to handle more frequent and heavier traffic loads.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Room for Visitors</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, there will be no room or provision for
"non-working" visitors. As the outpost expands, spare quarters for guests
may be set aside (possibly the original, now outmoded crew quarters). Only
as the outpost expands to the point where potential income from visitors
outweighs the "bother" that looking out for them will cause, will a real
ticket-purchasing visitor influx begin. The outpost will then have a
dedicated hotel, a tourist excursion coach, and an itinerary of visitable
sites. And outpost population will have grown quite a bit.</P>

<H2 align=center>Personnel</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>From Scout Crews to Pioneer Settlers</P><P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:kokhmmm@execpc.com">Peter
Kokh</a></P></font>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Expectations from our long-running experiences on Mir should
give us confidence for similar manning and crew rotation patterns on the
moon. In its one-sixth Earth-normal gravity ("sixthweight"), any
physiological deterioration should both proceed more slowly and be
accumulatively less severe than in ambient zero-G. In following this
pattern, we might expect some lunar base personnel to have longer tours of
duty, while other visiting "mission specialists" who have come to oversee
relatively short tests of pilot demonstration processing equipment, for
example, may return to Earth in short order.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several reasons why personnel may rotate at a
slower rate than the rhythm of Earth-moon support and resupply flights
might seem to allow:
<OL>
<LI><P>not bringing replacement personnel frees up allowable net payload
mass for extra badly needed equipment.</P>
<LI><P>not returning personnel makes room for extra "export" cargo from the
moon:</P>
<OL type="a">
<LI><P>lunar liquid oxygen for delivery to LEO to refuel the Earth-moon
ferry</P>
<LI><P>loads of regolith samples for delivery to Earth's surface where
ongoing processing experiments can be done more cheaply and more
thoroughly, i.e. with lower gross man-hour support costs and in better
equipped laboratories.</P>
</OL>

<LI><P>if the lunar descent vehicle is built as we've suggested, with the
crew cabin underslung and equipped with a surface locomotion chassis that
can be winched to the surface and taxi to the outpost, every descent module
that returns crewless means an extra surface vehicle at the disposal of the
outpost.</P>

<LI><P>In general, average on-the-moon labor support costs will come down
as the amount of productive man-hours per ticket of passage goes up.</P>
</OL>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;With all these forces operating to encourage extension of
lunar surface duty times, outpost managers, both on site and on Earth, will
be motivated to provide perks and incentives for voluntary extension of
planned tours of duty. Moon duty will be exciting and prestigious at first,
with no shortage of volunteers. But as duty time wears on, the view out
the window less dominated by Earth, more by sterile, barren, unforgiving,
and lonely moonscapes of colorless grays, lunar base personnel will be glad
to get out of their sardine can quarters, be relieved of their cabin fever,
and return "home."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;From this humble beginning to an era when men and women will
come intent upon staying the rest of their lives is one tremendous jump.
But the long road from limited mission scouts to pioneer settlers starts
right here, with the need on the several counts mentioned above to
encourage voluntary, but still not indefinite, extensions of contracted
duty time.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;People put up with what they have to. If the next
opportunity to "get out of here" is some time off, one grins and bears the
restrictions, the confinement, and the sacrifices with or without a smile.
But if ships are returning to Earth on a regular basis and one's "moon
duty" has already "worn thin," then the desire to be aboard the next ship
home will begin to interfere with one's effectiveness. Perks, extra
amenities, and other incentives to make continued surface duty more
bearable will be absolutely necessary.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay: we start with the obvious: money, the
worthwhile-maker. As duty extensions are cheaper than crew replacement,
some of the "savings" realized are properly shared with those agreeing to
stay on, in terms of higher wage rates. Wages can be sent to one's
Earthside family, or accumulate in a terrestrial bank account. But there
are other forms of compensation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The "re-upper" can be rewarded with "import credits" e.g.
the right to request added momentos, pasttime materials, or favorite food
delicacies to be on the next ship up. One can acquire seniority for bidding
on desireable assignments. One can be admitted to the decision making
councils. One can be granted more "flextime," leeway in personally
scheduling worktime and freetime.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Time off</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical week "vacations" would be a very special perk,
one that the "re-upper" can use to explore in greater depth any hobbies or
interests - experimenting with lunar art/craft materials, dance forms that
go with the grain of sixthweight, exploring and developing confined space
sixthweight sports ideas; music, poetry, literature, and writing articles
for hire reporting on life on the moon. It is important to realize that all
such activity can be indirectly productive for the basehold as a whole if
and in so far as it opens up more possibilities for other personnel to
enjoy their stays.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Attention to ambience</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all the perks should be reserved for those who agree to
duty extensions. By then the psychological damage from unnecessarily
spartan conditions may be irreversible. The outpost can be made both
ergonomic and functionally pleasant at little or no extra weight penalty or
cost simply by thoughtful design. Crew quarters can be individually
decorated, and easily redecorable to suit the tastes of new occupants.
There should be varied and redoable decor in the common areas. There should
be cubbyholes other than one's own cramped berthspace in which to retreat.
Attention should be paid to acoustics so that one has the choice of
background music or silence or his/her own favorite blends.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Rotation of assignments</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what one's specialty, there should be the
opportunity for shot-in-the-arm routine-busting assignments. Those
regularly in the field can be given inside duty for relief. Vice versa,
those stuck in labs and workstations can be given periodic field duty.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Leisure time opportunities</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The outpost should have a good audiovisual and literature
library, in the lightest weight storage form, of course. There should also
be some traditional art and craft media and the opportunity to explore
working with on-site materials. Requests should be honored when feasible
for "time off together" for those wanting to explore dance or sport or
other "exercise" options. There should be "real" opportunities as well for
continuing self-education, personal or occupational, for credit when
desirable.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>A bit of Earth</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Relief duty in the outpost farm, even if nothing but a
compact hydroponics closet operation, will be welcome to most. In addition,
an abundance of well-chosen "house plants" will not only help keep the air
"fresh and sweet," but provide a psychological filter against the barren
and sterile surroundings outvac - especially if arranged in the foreground
of any window or viewing port. Available nooks and crannies can be the
opportunity for "pocket parks," even "forests" of bonsai evergreens.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Water reserves can be put to work as well. Fountains and
wallside waterfalls add both soothing white noise to help drown out the
non-symphonic hums of assorted equipment, and to keep the air comfortable
and rain-fresh. Aquaria can add the further comfort of "wildlife," color,
and visual relief. Another opportunity for "wildlife" will arise once the
outpost "farm" reaches the stage where natural pollination would be
helpful. Bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds are candidates.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarcely anything, however, is more important for morale,
day in and day out, than menu diversity and good tasting food. Bland
nutritional balance is hardly enough - not out of the ivory tower. The
outpost pantry should be kept well-stocked with herbs, spices, and
peppers.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Toward "Social Normalcy"</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The desire of outpost mission planners to control and
otherwise restrict the range of "permissible" social activities will be
strong. On the one hand there is the legitimate desire to have things run
smoothly and discourage behavior that can be disruptive. On the other hand
there is the illegitimate pressure that comes from having the rest of the
world looking over your shoulder with their assorted hangups. The solution
to both has to be a very real degree of privacy with limited and scheduled
public "telepresence" along with a degree of discretion given to on-site
authority. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;While the variety of social interactions will become
measurably more satisfying as basehold population increases from shy of a
dozen towards a hundred or more, nothing should be done to control or
restrict spontaneous sexual liaisons, romances, and relationships so long
as they do not begin to interfere with work or with the morale of the rest
of the personnel. That said, it remains a pretty good truism that
fraternization "at work" is a bad game plan, full of pitfalls and well
documented by horror stories. Nevertheless it happens.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pregnancies will be strongly discouraged at first (cf. the
ABC movie "Plymouth"), and perhaps be reason for early termination of tour.
Yet sooner or later this is a plunge that must be taken. We cannot know for
sure that the moon is a potential long term new home for man until the
second generation of native-born turns out healthy and fertile.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;A more serious potential problem is the development of a
medical condition that would make survival of a trip back to Earth
problematic. It may never happen. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;What to do with someone who has done something unforgiveably
antisocial or outright criminal is an eventuality more likely to occur.
"Out the airlock without a spacesuit" is not an option. Confinement to
quarters (makeshift brig) means a loss of productivity. The alternative may
be to assign the person to undesirable but necessary duties, inside or
outvac. Menu and free time restrictions might be effective penalties. No
amount of prior screening can prevent trouble altogether.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sooner or later someone will die on the moon either by
accident, by sudden illness, or by foul play. Shipment of the remains to
Earth should not be authomatic. The person in question will have signed a
living will which states his or her preferences. Interment on the moon
should be an option. Nor need this mean "burial." If the outpost has a
furnace that can serve as a crematorium, one can specify his/her ashes to
spread inside in the outpost "flower garden" or "pocket park" or outvac in
some chosen or favorite spot. If not, another option is simple surface
interment, under UV-proof glass, otherwise exposed to the vacuum, and the
stars. More than any flag, a burial site makes a place, however desolate,
forever human.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Longer term</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for beginnings. Our humble lunar outpost will have
to number more than a hundred before there is enough diversity of talent,
occupation, opportunity, and social interaction to make indefinite stays
tolerable even for the hearty few.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The mini offspring biosphere with which the frontier
community reencradles itself will have had to become much more massive,
self-regulating, and forgiving before all but the most determined will be
willing to give up ever returning to the lush green hills of Earth. We will
have had to have progressed from outpost-with-houseplants to
biosphere-with-farm-and-farm-village, and a tad of compatible or insulated
industry on the side.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Economically, we will have to be manufacturing on location a
visibly large portion of our needs, particularly expansion shelter and
furnishings. Thriving indigenous arts and crafts will begin to endear
pioneers to their new would-be home and start to add to the list of things
they would have to "give up" were they to return to Earth. When this list
becomes personally more cogent than the list of still missed things they
gave up to come to the moon, the balance will be tipped.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have had to make the commitment to the less direct
productivity of child rearing and retirement. And perhaps these two needs
can take care of each other. Parents can work while retiree "grandparent"
volunteers (with enough energy) can teach and raise the young. In general,
there must be programs to keep all citizens as productive as possible. In
this light, retirement becomes more of a shifting of gears, of switching to
less stressful, more relaxed, less demanding "half-time" assignments.
Besides teaching, administrative paper-pushing duties come to mind. There
will be other things. Everyone must, and must be given a full range of
opportunities to, pull his or her weight in the forever upward struggling
pioneer frontier community.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Population will have to grow too before their will be enough
of a gene pool upon which to base a stable permanent population, if, for
some reason, the traffic from Earth should be cut off, forcing the infant
community to go it alone, hopefully in economic interdependence with other
similarly stranded off-Earth pockets of humanity. While this seems far off,
it is a scenario which has long motivated space supporters. The
journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step. We've tried here to
outline some of these first steps, as well as some other forks in the road
a bit farther along. If it is going to all happen, we will have to
consciously take these steps in a timely fashion.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>R&D Report: #4 - 11/05/95</P>
<P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:kokhmmm@execpc.com">Peter Kokh</a>,
amateur artist</P></font>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;RECAP: This is a "Lunar Arts/Craft" R&D Project aimed at
determining if "paints" suitable for use by artists in a pioneer settlement
can be made entirely from elements recoverable from lunar regolith soil.
The idea is based on the fact that sodium silicate, commonly known as
"waterglass" and a liquid at room temperatures, is the only known inorganic
adhesive. It can be produced from lunar soil, and the basic experiment is
to see if adhesive-based (rather than solvent-based) "paints" can be made
by mixing in colored metal oxide pigments.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The first painting, Moon Garden #1, was produced 9/29/'94
using sodium silicate, titanium dioxide (white), manganese dioxide (black),
ferric iron oxide (rust), chromium oxide (green), and sulfur (yellow) and
combinations of these to produce gray, orange, and pink. The "canvas,"
again picked because it could be produced locally in a lunar settlement,
was glass, painting, foreground first, on the backside.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;An article about the project appeared in the Jan/Feb '95
issue of Ad Astra, pp. 46-7. Since then other pigments have been tried, not
all successfully. The most notable (and costly) addition to the palette
being cobalt aluminate blue.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>The Aging Problem - Worst fears allayed </H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few months, the first two paintings had begun to show
patchy delamination from the back surface of the glass. The prime suspected
culprits were low winter indoor humidity, a film of windex on the glass,
or, worse, a temporary aspect to the adhesive quality of the medium. The
third painting, done in mid-May addressed both the first two concerns. The
pane was baked after cleaning to remove residual windex film. And the air
was now more humid. Six months later, this painting looks much as it did
the day it was produced.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;While this allays the worst fears, that waterglass painting
may turn out to be suitable only for "temporary art," we are not ready to
claim that the problem is solved. This is an experiment, and it is the
nature of experiments that sometimes the desired result is not, even cannot
be, produced. Time alone will tell whether or not this "aging" will
continue, whether or not it can only be postponed, etc. We will not resort
to organic additive "fixatives" because this would invalidate the
experiment.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>New Pigments, methods tried </H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past several months, some new pigments have been
purchased. Iron Sulfide, FeS2 (fool's gold), yielded disappointing results.
Vanadium Pentoxide, which promised a bright golden orange joined the ranks
of three previous "failing" pigments in immediately reacting with the
waterglass and gumming up. Chemicals that had not worked now represented an
investment of well over $200. However, a somewhat crude "work around"
application method promises to recoup some of this investment and expand
the palette. We have succeeded in "flocking" one of these four powders on
glass wet with plain waterglass. Potassium chromate gives us a brighter,
more vivid yellow than the pastel sulfur we've been using so far.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>New paintings, sales, gifts, donations </H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This fall saw three more paintings. "Out the Window"
depicted an oval window in a lunar habitat, looking out on the moonscape
(painted on the reverse side of an 8"x10" pane) with the peripheral
foreground inside the habitat painted on the front side of the glass. It
was donated to Greg Bennett, CEO of the Lunar Resources Company and chief
architect of the Artemis Project - after hanging "NFS" [not for sale] in
the First Contact II art show.  Also in the show, up for bid, was "Earth in
Space" painted on the reverse side of the 8"x10" glass, with however, the
clouds on the front side of the glass to create depth and show that they
were not Earth surface features. This went for $60. A small 5"x7"
demonstration piece, "Moonscape" was donated to the charity auction and
went for $12. The following week, the second painting produced (mid-October
'94) called "Greening the Gray" was donated to the MSDC seed money raffle.
Meanwhile, membership in L.A.A.M.P./subscriptions to semi-annual Moonbow,
crept up to just ten.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Commissions Accepted </H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;To generate more income with which to pay for continued
experimentation, commissions will be accepted for "Earth in Space"
originals painted on backside of 8"x10" glass (clouds front side): black,
white, blues, greens, tans - no two alike, metal frame. $50 includes
explanation of art form, "paints" used, shipping/handling, two issues of
Moonbow. Make payable to the artist and send to the L.A.A.M.P. address
listed at the bottom of the opposite page. Allow 3-4 weeks.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Waterglass-aided Stained Glass Experiment </H4>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope to soon begin diversifying work with waterglass.
Stained glass (art glass) is certainly a viable lunar art-form, materials
wise, with one exception: the "leading" that separtes/joins the individual
colored glass cartoon pieces. What we want to try is cementing these
colored glass pieces, using waterglass as an adhesive, to a host
transparent pane, filling the gaps with a thick paste made of waterglass
and common regolith simulant. The look should be similar enough, and the
heavier pieces will be lighter in lunar gravity. PK

<H2 align=center>Commercial Moonbase Brainstorming Workshop</H2>

<P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:kokhmmm@execpc.com">Peter Kokh</a>, First
Contact II Co-chair</font></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 7th, 1995, at a Science/Science Fiction Convention in
Milwaukee called First Contact II, LRS hosted a three-hour brainstorming workshop
on the "Design Requirements for a Commercial Moon Base." The Lunar Reclamation
Society (NSS-Milwaukee) and Milwaukee Science Fiction Services are joint partners
in this new hybrid convention. Leading the workshop was the special LRS "Doer"
Guest of Honor, Greg Bennett, CEO of The Lunar Resources Company in Houston, and
chief architect of "The Artemis Project." Co-directing the session were Mark
Kaehny and Peter Kokh of LRS. David Burkhead of Spacecub fame also participated.
There were eleven of us altogether.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few general remarks about what we were going to attempt to
do, identify things a first lunar outpost could do to make money, we broke up
into two brainstorming groups (larger groups are unwieldy).</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Group A</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Greg Bennett, Mark Kaehny (group secretary), David Burkhead, Edwin
Reck, and Mark Roth-Whitworth - came up with the suggestions below.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The numbering reflects only the order in which the suggestion was
made - given the limited time, there was no attempt to put these ideas in a
logical order, much less to come up with them in a logical order - brainstorming,
by its very nature, has to be free-ranging and unfettered. The inevitable chaff
can be separated out from the wheat later. The dynamics of group brainstorming is
such that an idea presented "half-baked" by one person, can then be "fully baked"
by others in the group. It is an exciting process.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The contents in square brackets, [ ], are added by the MMM editor,
a non-participant in Group A, and may or may not accurately qualify or reflect
the intent of the suggester.</P>

<LI><P>Space-wear and moon-wear clothing for Ken, Barbie dolls.</P>

</OL>


<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Group B</H3>
<P>Peter Kokh (group secretary), Fred Oesau, David Crawford, Doug Seitz, Jim
Plaxco, and Kevin Crowley.</P>

<P>Whereas Group A concentrated (not exclusively) on money-generating ideas to
get the Artemis Project "on the way," Group B chose to concentrate (again not
exclusively) on money-generating ideas that would apply "once a permanent
occupiable outpost was set up."</P>

<OL>
<LI><P>Testing/tending of prototype feasibility demonstration equipment for
mining operations, beneficiation processes, other processing: e.g. lunar oxygen
production, silane [silicon-based analog of methane] fuel production; iron fine
extraction and sintered iron product manufacturing; i.e. Artemis crew-members
serve as time-share mission specialists for companies hoping to do industrial
business on the Moon.</P> <P>Money would be earned not only from providing
time-share trained labor. Income would also be generated by carrying along
equipment to the Moon, shipping back various processed and manufactured samples,
etc. i.e. renting payload space and mass aboard the Lunar Transfer Vehicle, and
descent/ ascent vehicles.</P>

<LI><P>On-site advertising. More elaborate possibilities than in # 21 above
because of the availability of crew for non-electronic changeouts, as well as
part-time models, actors, etc. The availability of crew also permits greater
latitude in changing the all-important background setting, i.e. in total picture
composition. It allows moving "commercials" as well.</P>

<LI><P>Setting up and tending telescopes and other astronomical installations
(changeout of instrumentation) for university-consortia, etc. This would involve
trained time-share crew as mission specialists, and fees for payload bay space
and weight as in # 1, above.</P>

<LI><P>Teleoperated "working" robot-rovers - Artemis sells minutes/hours for the
right to teleoperate mobile equipment that (a) emplaces regolith shielding over
the habitat complex; (b) grades approaches and aprons, improves landing pad,
etc.; (c) collects dust and rock samples.</P>

<P>Time could be purchased directly, or, seeing that it would be expensive and
eliminate all but the best-heeled of individuals, corporate sponsors (or Artemis
itself) could raffle off the right to teleoperate such equipment, after a minimum
number of hours of simulation training, of course, this included in the package,
so that the actual time would be well spent, both to reward the lucky individual
teleoperator, and to maximize for Artemis the efficiency and safety with which
the needed work gets done. </P>

<P>This concept would not be unlike going on a paid "teleoperated" archeological
or paleontological dig.</P>

<LI><P>We noted that many income opportunities will presuppose that Artemis
planners had picked a visually exciting site with its surroundings, not just a
scientifically exciting one.</P>

<LI><P>Photographic panoramas deserving of being rendered as wall murals
(wallpaper, see Group A, above). This will include one of the Artemis Moonbase
itself, either/both as under construction or/and as completed (phase 1), as well
as various untransformed scenic vistas in the area.</P> <P>Some of these murals
could be available for open reproduction, others sold in limited sets of 100 to
generate high individual auction/bid prices.</P>

<LI><P>Telerobotic lessons sold separately to qualify winners of teleoperation
time. See # 4, above.</P>

<LI><P>$100 million lottery - winner to be trained as time-share mission
specialist along on the first, or second mission.</P>

<LI><P>Teleoperable manufacturing equipment to be engineered by rival competing
engineering teams pro bono - the carrot reward being the right to get a
percentage return or royalty on income generated by the teleoperated device for
the its operational lifetime.</P>

<LI><P>Entertainment pay-per-view TV produced on site, capitalizing on eerie
effects of 1/6th gravity: one or two person ballet performances (doable on a
small set); midget sumo wrestling (our apologies to the Little People or those of
Japanese descent to whom our fun suggestion is offensive); once a bigger "gym" is
available, Lunar Jai Alai.</P>

<LI><P>Made, or hand-selected on Moon artifacts, coins, jewelry. Cut and polished
breccia broaches or ring stones. Sintered iron coins to be polymer coated against
rust on arrival on Earth. Items made of glass spherules. Necklace glass capsules
half-filed with common regolith moon dust.</P>

<P>Weightier and thus much more expensive: sinter-cast block which bears your own
footprints, made on the Moon with a casting or your very own foot/feet or
shoe(s)/boot(s). Sinter-cast blocks with custom Valentine-type message.</P>

<LI><P>Selling Names: of modules and parts of modules of the outpost and lunar
descent vehicle. e.g. the John Doe porthole, the Jane Doe Hall (meetings, TV
studio, dance hall, gym, Jai Alai court, etc. multi-use larger volume hard hull
module or inflatable.</P>

<P>Also getting corporations to pay for additional mods or upgraded interiors of
planned modules - all for the ad value = e.g. "furnished by Apollo interiors, of
city, state."</P>

<LI><P>Repository for cremation ashes. This can be under the open star-spangled
sky, UV-protected by a glass pane.</P>

<LI><P>Biological Quarantine Facility for sample all-but-extinct pathogens and
toxins too dangerous to be kept indefinitely at the Contagious Disease Control
Center in Atlanta. An associated lab could be a follow-on.</P>

<LI><P>3D computer-controlled variable mold stamping device which will render
your footprints/handprints and a photo of same on the Moon, in an area to be set
aside not ever to be re-disturbed. Different from # 11 (second paragraph)
above.</P>

<LI><P>Lunar Spaceport Beacon which can flash messages (commercial ad or personal
[monitored] for a high fee) in Morse code when visible from Earth during local
Moonbase nightspan.</P>

<LI><P>Along the same line, experiments in local nigthtspan fireworks and light
shows to be paid for by sponsors on Earth for very large terrestrial audiences on
special occasions.</P>

<LI><P>Afterthought on # 11 jewelry ideas above. For necklaces, glass spheres
with actual lunar vacuum (glass is stronger under compression)</P>

<LI><P>Actual Signatures on the Moon: Artemis would sell the right (and small
space) to write/engrave your signature on various pieces of structural or
operating hardware</P>

<OL type="a"> 

<LI>to land temporarily on the Moon = cheaper

<LI>be part of the permanent outpost installation. This idea is attractive
because it does not add to the weight or cost of the hardware to be landed on the

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Reflections on the Workshop</H4> 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;As I had guaranteed Greg Bennett as we were about to start, this
process was sure to come up with many ideas that have already been thought of in
previous Artemis Project brainstorming sessions, but also certain to come up with
some new ideas previous groups had not thought of, or at least new variations.
Afterwards, Greg assured me that the Workshop had delivered as promised. All
participants found the exercise very stimulating and the high point of their
convention.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In Houston and in Huntsville, the ideas outlined above will be
merged with the results of previous marketing and income generating brainstorm
sessions.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional ideas? Please send them to "Marketing & Income Ideas",
ASI, PO Box 4878, Huntsville, AL 35815.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the fourth in a series of Mission Control Workshops
hosted by the Lunar Reclamation Society. The first, at the ISDC '93 in
Huntsville, dealt with three diverse Asteroid Base scenarios. The following ISDC
'94 in Toronto, we hosted a four-group workshop on Tourism in Space. At the
maiden First Contact Science/Science Fiction Convention in Milwaukee in 1994, our
workshop dealt with Seafloor analogs of Lunar and Space Outposts (with special
"Doer" Guest of Honor Dennis Chamberland of the League of New Worlds).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workshop topic for next year's First Contact has been narrowed
down to two topics ("The Use of Lavatubes"; "Mini Lunar Biospheres") with the
final selection dependent on the availability of potential "Doer" GoHs.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;For the chance to contribute to this ongoing process, the pleasure
was all ours. PK</P>

Letter From the President

<P><FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:boise@asi.org">Boise Pearson</a>,
President, Artemis Society International</Font></P>


<font size=2><P>NOTE: Candace Dicks <A href="mailto:cddicks@aol.com">&lt;CDDicks@aol.com&gt;</a> is now organizing Technical Committees</P></font><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target="_top" href="../090/how-you-can-help.html">Last month</a> we
heard from Pat Bennett about her efforts to organize the membership of <a
target="_top"  href="/asi_index.html">Artemis Society International</a> into Technical
Committees. She has received quite a response to her request for
volunteers, and the Technical Committees are starting to take shape. This
month we feature an article about the first Committee to be organized, the
Simulation Technical Committee. Look for future articles about the fun
projects these Committees are taking on to make the <a
target="_top" href="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a> happen.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Participating Online</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We are finding that one of the toughest challenges we face
is efficiently communicating about the Artemis Project. The <a target="_top" href="/adb/09/03/artemis-list.html">artemis-list</a> email discussion group
has grown so large that we're working on a breakup of the discussion group
by topic, possibly in Usenet News format. For the time being, we've added
a daily digest service, concatenating all of the day's messages into a
single email message. This should help alleviate mailbox clutter,
reducing the number of mail messages to one per day.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;To join the email discussion group, send an email message to
<a href="mailto:server@LunaCity.com">&lt;server@LunaCity.com&gt;</a>, with
the body of your message being, "join artemis-list".</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;To receive the email discussion in digest form, send an
email message to <a
href="mailto:server@LunaCity.com">&lt;server@LunaCity.com&gt;</a>, with the
body of your message being, "join artemis-digest".</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the communications challenges is presenting the
Artemis Project to people who are interested, without overwhelming them.
The Project encompasses so many ideas and disciplines, it is hard for a
newcomer to grasp it all at once. To help address this concern, we are
redesigning the WWW site to provide a more orderly introduction to the
Project for newcomers, and easy access to information for those already
involved. The new web site will include information on the technical
committees and how to join in on the fun, local and international chapters,
and current projects. Keep an eye out for the changes, and let us know
what you think.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Dual Entitlements to MMM and ASI dues</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there has been some question about subscription
and membership rates from people who are members of ASI, but already
receive MMM from another source. For those who already receive MMM, ASI
team <a target="_top" href="/asi_member.html">membership</a> dues are reduced from
$25/year to $15/year.</P>

Simulation for the Artemis Project
</h2><P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:m.bennett30@genie.com">by Michael H.
Bennett</a>, Simulation Technical Committee Chairman</P></font>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Simulations are computer programs which model or mimic the
behavior of physical systems. They are used to predict or explore capabilities
and limitations. With simulations, we can train pilots without leaving the
ground, or test parts or components which haven't even been developed yet.
Throughout the Artemis Project, simulations will be developed and used to verify
designs, analyze mission parameters, provide training for astronauts, educate the
public, and generate revenue.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Mission Statement</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of the Simulation Technical Team of the Artemis
Society International is to support all phases of the Artemis Project with
accurate, timely, and cost-effective simulations. The types of simulations fall
into four basic categories:

<UL type=square> 
<LI><P><B>Unit engineering simulations</B> -- accurate
simulations of a single part of an Artemis vehicle. These simulations are most
useful during the design process, and allow the development team to analyze
numerous options before committing to a final design.</P>

<LI><P><B>Multi-unit engineering simulations</B> -- simulations which analyze the
interaction of two or more systems. These simulations are also used during the
design process, to find possible problems due to interaction of systems which,
taken separately, function adequately. An example would be discovering that a
fuel pump could not provide sufficient fuel to the engine to permit operation at
maximum thrust.</P>

<LI><P><B>Training Simulators </B>-- used to familiarize personnel with the
operation of complex equipment. Training systems are highly dependent upon the
final design of the equipment. For the Artemis Project, the training simulators
will utilize inputs from engineering simulations to minimize system development
costs.</P>

<LI><P><B>Entertainment simulations</B> -- simulations which provide
entertainment value, whether passive or interactive. These include virtual
reality, ridefilms, video games, and flight simulators. 
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a target="_top" href="/artemis.html">Artemis Project</a> provides a unique opportunity for simulation
development. As a systems engineer, I relish the chance to work on a project like
this from the very beginning. By applying the best techniques of software
engineering now, at the beginning, we will be able to minimize development costs
in the future without sacrificing accuracy.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;By maintaining a consistent approach over the development of all
simulations during the project, we will reduce the amount of redevelopment which
commonly occurs on similar projects. We will find it easy to reuse "parts" of
previously written programs for the training devices which we develop.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Inputs to simulations from technical groups will provide the tools
to model the complex systems of the Artemis Project, from mission trajectories to
LTV [<a href="/adb/04/02/01/" target="_top">Lunar Transfer Vehicle</a>] design parameters. In return, the Simulation
Technical Committee will provide the analyses which enable the engineers to
improve their designs. We will teach the astronauts to fly, to ensure that they
are safe and confident. Our simulations will help create the entertainment
necessary to fund the Artemis Project, through virtual reality "tours,"
ridefilms, video games and flight simulators, all based on the real spacecraft
under development. Through all this, we will help to inspire the public, and open
their eyes to the endless possibilities.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;David Brummel demonstrated the <a target="_top"

Artemis Society of Houston. It will be installed in the ASI domain with links
from the introductory Artemis Society material. The main entry point to the
Artemis Project on the World Wide Web is <a
href="http://www.asi.org/">http://www.asi.org/</a>.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We reviewed copies of the new fact sheets and membership cards
from Duncan Graphics. The fact sheets are hard to reproduce -- high-quality
printing is needed to reproduce the backgrounds properly -- but the result is
very readable and impressive. The text of the <a href="/adb/j/index.html" target="_top">Frequently Asked Questions</a> and
<a target="_top" href="/adb/j/fro_index.html">Frequently Raised Objections</a> fact sheets needs to be better organized before
doing massive print runs</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The membership ID was not well-received; it's too large and looks
like an ID badge instead of a membership card. The concensus at ASH was that the
membership card should be the size of a credit card. Separate photo ID badges
would have lots of uses, but should be a bit smaller and the person's name should
be printed much larger.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave a briefing on where Angus Bay is, and how it got its name.
This was essentially a presentation of the story I posted to artemis-list a few
days ago. Larry Friesen objected to changing the name of Mare Anguis ("Sea of
Snakes"), but no one could present an argument for preserving silly names of
places just to appease a bureaucracy.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The main question before the Artemis Society of Houston now,
besides working with ASI HQ to establish the paperwork for chartering local
groups, is to select a project or two on which we can concentrate our
efforts.</P>

<h3 align=center>Thanks, Artemis!</h3>
<P align=center>9/29/95</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember, as a kid, watching "Space: 1999" and dreaming of someday living and working on the moon. I could conveniently forget that they were blasted out of orbit by a nuclear explosion on the lunar surface. I would someday be an engineer or a scientist and help to develop the moon into a habitable place for humans to live. The planets call out to us, and in my childhood innocence, I believed that the moon was the perfect connecting node en route to our solar neighbors.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, like a lot of my friends, I grew up and found out that colonizing the moon was just a pipe dream to encourage kids to learn science and math. So, I settled for just becoming a plain, vanilla, moon-walking-wanna-be, engineer/scientist.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But lo, just when I thought all hope was lost for access to the moon, what should I come across, but a home page for the Artemis Project. I want to thank you guys for making a dent in my attitude about living on the moon. I have actually changed the direction of my life because of your project.</P>

<H2 align=center>Rethinking the Moon Buggy</H2><P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Reflections from <a
href="mailto:amon@walt.music.qub.ac.uk">Dale Amon</a></FONT>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would want to [build new lunar rovers from the old
Apollo era plans]??? By today's standards the electronics on that thing are
a science fair project....</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Replace the frame with composites from Scaled Composites.
The electric motors will be a fraction of the size and weight because
magnet materials have improved vastly since then. Storage technology has
not improved by as great a degree but still, it has advanced. We'll have
commercial micro-machine accelerometers on the market soon, so the
navigation hardware will be built right onto the chip with the electronic
interface. The comm gear has shrunk to nearly nothing. Compare a walkie
talkie in a '60s' era Edmund Scientific catalog with what you can pick up
down at your local Tandy Radio Shack. R/C toys have better radio equipment
than some of those '60s' comm units....</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, most importantly of all - we know the environment
it is to work in and have those old rovers, their problems and performance
as an initial data point. And that data point is basically that it is no
big deal building one. They are a piece of kit that a hobbyist could
successfully build. It doesn't take an aerospace company to build an
electric dune buggy.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a bit of caution on vacuum, a bit of thought on rad
hardening, a bit of care on temperature range...  And you needn't bother
about outgassing of your materials. They'll never be inside your breathing
space so who cares? That makes it a lot easier.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and some care in packaging may be required to ensure it
isn't damaged by the vibration. I remember ruining a tire on my DT400 by
not tying the tire down when hauling it in a trailer behind my car. Tire
spun from the vibration and wore the nobbies bald...</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>From Rovers to Cycles - Human Power</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;While walking home recently one night I remembered some
thoughts I had on lunar rovers a number of years back. There will be a need
for different sorts of vehicles, and undoubtedly large hauling vehicles,
whenever they are required, will need a good power source. Whether that be
fuel cell, battery, solar power, beamed power or some mix I won't go into
here. But the type of vehicle needed for a small, relatively self-sufficient
group should have a number of characteristics that few of the designs in
the literature ever consider.</P>

<UL type=square>
<LI><P>The motive source should be 100% field repairable preferably with
only a few tools and simple spare parts.</P>

<LI><P>Spare parts should be such that they can be manufactured locally
from small amounts of raw materials.</P>

<LI><P>The vehicle should have a fail safe criteria that it can bring the
driver home under almost any circumstances in which the driver is still
capable of driving.</P>

<LI><P>It must use indigenous energy supplies.</P>
</UL>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now if you look at these requirements through the 
old-fashioned NASA eyes, you will come up with a billion dollar project. If you
look at it with the eyes of an engineer, you immediately come to the
conclusion that a human powered vehicle is just the ticket.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Research backs this up. In a Scientific American issue on
Human Powered Vehicles a number of years ago, an article on bicycles had an
extra data point for the performance of a vehicle on the moon. A racing
biker, with no air resistance and 1/6 g could break 1000km/h in sprints. A
normal, healthy person could cruise at over 100km/h all day, and could
easily pull a trailer load at the equivalent of typical Earth-bound auto
driving speeds.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The form of the vehicle is the recumbent bicycle like that
used by Stephen K. Roberts (Computing Across America). And in fact, he would
probably be the best person to speak to on the design of a lunar rover. He
crossed the USA from end to end several times on his recumbent, traveling
up and down through the Rockies, keeping up reasonable highway speeds -
and all the while with a trailer that included solar power gathering and a
satellite uplink so he could type on the keyboard in front of him (while
peddling) and submit articles to magazines that funded his journeys. He
also had navigation and maps built into his console processor. I don't
think there is anything that a lunar rover built for days of unsupported
prospecting would need that he didn't do 5-6 years ago.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, that is not to say there aren't issues unique to the
moon. There is the issue of traction and off-road travel, which will drive
the gearing ratios, axle loading, weight and balance, and wheel design.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Braking will have to be dynamic, feeding the energy back
into a dynamo. Normal friction brakes are a bad idea for two reasons - 1)
The abrasiveness of the regolith. 2) Brake cooling is purely by radiation
to the background and conduction through the frame. Radiators are a problem
as has been suggested before; and since I expect the frame to be
composites, conduction is not very good either.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Gears and chains and deraileurs will have to be very robust
and spares will be required. A design that can be field welded would be a
good idea. Better to trade off a bit of elegance and performance for field
maintainability. These parts can be built very ruggedly (I'm not talking
about racing bikes here!!) and would need to be able to withstand the
rigours of large temperature swings and abrasive particles. One could seal
them, but then it is more difficult to field strip. And not to mention
which, without herculean efforts the lunar grit will get in anyway. If
anyone out there was in Desert Storm... </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area of concern is space suit cooling. The loads
will not be excessive under normal cruising since the peddling is only
enough to replace frictional losses.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of a small motor like that in a minibike could solve a
number of problems (if they don't add too much complexity on their own).
The motor could be the means by which braking returns energy to storage.
Energy can be recovered on downhill stretches and used to ease uphill
travel. It also can reduce the heat loading on the space suit during
acceleration from a standing start, or indeed any acceleration under load.
The motor would, of course, need to be built such that it can be
disconnected from the system entirely if it fails. The overall system
would have to be able to get the lunan back home regardless. So think of it
only as a luxury item on the bike.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The suit would be a live-in suit, so that puts some extra
design load on it. You might have to do better than a diaper if you're
going to be out for a week.... But this is a problem that needs to be solved
anyway. The Stars Wars rovers that some NASA scenarios show us are not
going to be feasible on any realistic budget, and in any case you'd only be
able to afford one of them for the same price as giving every lunan their
own personal lunabike.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems wholly superior to any rover concept I've yet to
see. Just about anyone out there could have run circles around the Lunar
Rover and been out 20 km and back before it was barely out of sight of the
LEM...</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, you say, bikes are good on highways, but off-road you're
going to want a trike! The lunar surface has huge areas that are much like
beaches and dunes. Covered with hardpacked fine regolith that follows the
contours of the land in a very smooth and gentlly rolling fashion. This is
not to say that crater rims and such are quite the same - but large tracts
of the moon should be easily negotiable.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;As to bike vs. trike, there is no inference above, of a two
wheel design - in fact I believe the recumbents are usually trikes. At
least the Robertson one that I saw in 1989 was... DA</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Out-vac trike-suits are a challenge</H3>
<FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:kohkmmm@expc.com">Peter Kokh</a></FONT>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds delightfully low-tech, doesn't it? Tired and stressed
out after a long day's work in your lunar office, mine, or factory? Just
don your out-vac trike suit and head for the airlock and get some heal-all
unwinding exercise! Reminds me of an Arthur C. Clarke story where the
hero does a kangaroo-lope to safety 600 km across Mare Imbrium in just a
spacesuit.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The question arises: without an open air heat sink, where
does all the body heat generated by such exertion go? An out-vac triking
suit needs not only to be self-contained (in RV-camper-trailer talk that
means "with toilet"), but able to handle/shed internally-generated heat,
and perspiration as well. That also means being able to keep the wearer
from getting a chill soaked in his/her own sweat once the exertion is over.
Perhaps the suit's insulation material could be an eutectic salt in a quilt
of pocket cells, melting to absorb internally-generated heat, solidifying
to release it - automatically, on demand. PK</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Or Perhaps a "Buppet" Bike</H3>
<FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:pchapman@bix.com">Phil Chapman</a><BR>
[* Buppet: etym. from Body Puppet, on the analogy of Muppet from Mitten
Puppet.<BR>
Note: "buppet" is the editor's word, not the writer's]</font>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Having tried both [an EVA suit and a diver's dry suit], let
me tell you that a pressurized conventional spacesuit is much more
restricting than a drysuit.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Spacesuit design has been hampered by thinking of it only as
a garment. It is also a small space vehicle. A conventional suit is no
place to be for more than a few hours. For longer durations, you need to be
able to pull your arms in so that you can scratch, or eat, or sleep, or
void. This suggests that the lunabike should be integrated with the suit --
in other words, the suit would be a light-weight pressurized canister with
wheels (4, for stability), with a shirt-sleeve internal environment for
pedaling and living. The canister would be equipped with pressurized
gloves, waldoes or other attached tools for manipulating the external
environment.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be necessary to carry a conventional suit, donnable
inside the canister, so that you could get out and get under if something
broke, or go climb that cliff over there (where, as Arthur Clarke has told
us, The Sentinel is waiting), or, in extremis, walk home. For routine use,
(such as getting from one pressurized dome to another) the mobile canister
alone might be sufficient. The real safety reason for carrying a
conventional suit is to avoid potentially fatal single-point failure modes,
an objective that might be met by careful design of the canister/bike
alone. PC

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>No, what we need is a Volkscycle!</H3>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Response from <a
href="mailto:amon@walt.music.qub.ac.uk">Dale Amon</a> to <a
href="mailto:pchapman@bix.com">Chapman</a>'s suggestion</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;[What I have in mind is an outvac cycle that fits every
lunan's budget. So] the bike must be mostly buildable from local materials
with simple tools and basic stock materials; all systems required for it to
function as transport must be field repairable. Simplicity. Something a
back yard mechanic can build and repair - exclusive of the electronics, of
course - but there should be no electronics that are absolutely required
for the bike to operate. Electronics must be something that is bolted on
and if necessary unbolted and tossed into a crater to lighten the
load.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The minute part of the design requires a special tool or
material, my design criteria demands that that element be discarded from
consideration. Simple. Indigenous. Independent.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Human-Powered Moon Trike<BR>
Call for a Technology Demo
for ISDC '98 - Milwaukee</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the more ambitious goals outlined in the plan for
ISDC '98 - Milwaukee is to present a number of low budget ($100-$5,000)
technology demonstrations of tidbits of technology that will be needed, or
useful on the space frontier, and which should not take that much money to
demonstrate.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;A human-powered Moon Trike is such a possibility. Because
gravity is only 1/6th Earth-normal, but momentum remains full Earth-normal,
to prevent tipping, the vehicle should have a very wide track, wheels that
lean into turns, and a low center of gravity (hence a recumbent rider
position seems ideal). Any interested group should attempt to find its own
industrial and corporate sponsors, advisors, project managers, etc. and
register their effort with

<BLOCKQUOTE>ISDC '98 - Milwaukee,<BR>
P.O. Box 2102,<BR>
Milwaukee WI 53201</BLOCKQUOTE>
 which will attempt to provide advice and assistance.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Introduction to Space:<BR> the Science of Spaceflight</H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>By Thomas D. Damon, 2nd Edition 1995<BR> 278 pp., Paper, $29.50,
Krieger Publishing Co.<BR> PO Box 9542, Melbourne, FL 32902<BR> ISBN
0-89464-053-5</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most frustrating problems for space advocates not
technically oriented is understanding some of the more sophisticated scientific
and mathematical principles underlying the efforts we are promoting. Many space
advocates, like myself, are liberal arts majors who took some basic math and
science courses but are not familiar with many topics whose understanding is
needed to fully comprehend the technical aspects of our space program.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas D. Damon was associated with Pike's Peak Community College
in Colorado Springs when it was decided that it would be appropriate to offer a
general space education course for liberal arts students. A search was made for
an appropriate text book and, having found none, a decision was made to produce
such a volume. According to the author, materials for the text book were
assembled from a collection of NASA pamphlets, contractor reports, government
publications, and sections from other basic science books.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The resulting work is now in its second edition and has become a
book of real substance. The most difficult subject for most, mathematics, is
dealt with in a novel and helpful way. Throughout the book, a series of twenty
separate sections (Math Boxes) are included at appropriate points. The Math Boxes
are written at a basic algebra level and are used to introduce mathematical
concepts to the nonmathematical text. This arrangement is for those who wish to
pursue a more technical understanding of the scientific concepts contained in the
book. These Math Boxes present the most fundamental space mechanics and space
science concepts at a level that is quite easily understood by a liberal arts
college graduate.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The book begins with a chapter briefly summarizing the history of
the space program from the first Chinese rockets through the flights of the space
shuttle. Following are three chapters devoted to the science of propulsion,
orbital mechanics, and the problems of functioning in the space environment. The
space environment chapter discusses those issues which must be dealt with if man
is to survive in an environment beyond the protection of the Earth's
atmosphere.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth through seventh chapters discuss the satellites commonly
used in Earth orbit. Covered are communication, remote sensing, weather, space
power, and military reconnaissance satellites. One of the major organizational
changes in the second edition is the incorporation of the space ballistic missile
defense chapter into the application satellites section. This obviously reflects
a decreased emphasis on the ballistic threat from the [former] Soviet Union.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Also included in the application satellite section is a thorough
discussion of astronomy from space. The Apollo program is described as are the
unmanned planetary probes that have provided us with so much new information on
the planets and moons of our solar system. The space telescope and the other
Earth orbiting observatories are also briefly discussed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapters eight to ten are devoted to discussions of the manned
space program. An entire chapter covers the design and operations of the space
shuttle. Following that are two chapters discussing the subjects of living and
working in Earth orbit. A substantial amount of detail is provided concerning the
questions arising from man's long-term exposure to micro-gravity. Also covered in
detail are the possible practical applications of the micro-gravity near vacuum
conditions available in lower orbit.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapters eleven and twelve include the issues relating to the
operations of Earth-orbiting space stations and the potential for colonies on
other worlds. There is a final chapter on the possibilities of extraterrestrial
life and the efforts to determine whether such life exists.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The book is a valuable contribution to the literature of space
flight. It succeeds, in that it brings together in one volume, at a level that is
easily comprehended by the intelligent layman, all the scientific topics that are
of significance to space advocates. It certainly is not a book that one is likely
to sit down and read, cover to cover. However, as issues arise with which there
is a need to become more familiar, the book will always be available to provide
the required information. It is the only volume of which I am aware that fulfills
such a role. It certainly deserves a place on every space advocate's book shelf.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>December 1995 - Mir Watching, and Listening</H4>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The C.I.S. manned space station Mir with Mir-20 (call sign
'Uran') Cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko, Sergei Avdeyev and Thomas (DF4TR /
DP0MIR) Reiter and will be appearing in the mid west morning skies November
19th to December 6th and return to the evening skies December 15th to Jan.
6th.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Amateur radio operators can log into the Mir 'Packet'
(R0MIR-1) BBS on 145.550MHz simplex or 435.775MHz uplink / 437.775 downlink
MHz. The cosmonauts also use the freq. 145.200MHz up and 145.800MHz down
or 435.725MHz up / 437.925MHz down or 145.550Mhz simplex to talk with
amateur radio operators on the ground during their off-hours.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;For exact times and locations to see the space station over
your backyard call MN MIRWATCH Coordinator Ben Huset at (612) 639-9109.
Look for MIRWATCH and other great space stuff on my web page at <a
href="http://www.skypoint.com/~benhuset/">http://www.skypoint.com/~benhuset/

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Onboard Mir - EUROMIR '95 Mission</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is an automatic recording from the Crew of the Mir
Space Station and the STS-74. The U.S. shuttle Atlantis, the STS-74 has
docked on time, around 09:30 onboard time. It was an excellent docking. We
almost didn't feel anything on the station, Ken Cameron was piloting the
Aircraft excellent and we are now waiting for the hatch opening and to
welcome the crew. Bye Bye." --- DP0MIR Thomas Reiter.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to Dave, N1PPP for this report.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas Reiter has spent some of his time looking for amateur
radio parts, connectors, adaptors, manuals and cables aboard Mir. He has
soldered some makeshift cables after concluding that the cables were not
to be found. STS-74 brought up the rest of the 'missing' parts. He hopes
to have the 'new' 440 MHz radios working soon.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Extra days and Extra walk</B>: An agreement has been
reached between ESA and the Russian RSC-Energia, that the EUROMIR 95
mission will now last until February 29, 1996. To make use of this extra
time up to 70 kg of payload will be uploaded in the next Progress flight,
now scheduled for December 15th, 1995 and Thomas Reiter will conduct a
second "Space Walk" around mid February 1996.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Problem</B>: Sometime on November 1st, the Mir
experienced a leak in an internal cooling loop. This loop is part of the
Kvant/Core module core system cooling loop. Approximately 1.8 liters of
37% solution Ethylene glycol leaked internal to the Mir volume. Loss of
the use of this loop disabled the regenerative CO<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>
removal system and one of the oxygen replenishing systems. The Mir then
used a backup scrubber similar to the shuttle LiOH system for CO<FONT
SIZE=1>2</FONT> removal. The leak was found and repaired a few days later
with 'a putty like substance'. STS-74 brought up 30 shuttle LiOH canisters
and a rapidly developed adaptor (just like Apollo 13) to convert shuttle
canisters to the Mir system. I haven't heard WHY we didn't just bring up
more RUSSIAN-made LiOH canisters.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;STS-74 was launched at 6:30:43 CST on '95 Nov 12. Atlantis
left pad 39A on the second attempt; the Nov 11 attempt was scrubbed at
T-5 min due to bad weather at the transAtlantic abort sites. Atlantis
docked with Mir at 00:27:39 CST on Nov 15. By 00:36 the latches on the APDS
docking system were closed and the Docking Module was firmly attached to
Kristall. The hatches to Mir were opened at about 3 am CST.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>They all look alike in those blue jumpsuits</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The STS-74 welcoming ceremony on Mir was high-lighted by
NASA HQ representative Wil Trafton (head of the ISS program) congratulating
the wrong Russian cosmonaut! As he greeted them, he gave best wishes to
"Ken Cameron, as commander of the Atlantis, and cosmonaut Solovyev, as
com-ander of the Mir". Solovyev, of course, had returned to Earth two
months earlier and the current commander is Gidzenko.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many gifts were exchanged by the Mir-20 and STS-74 crews.
The one I liked the most was the folding electronic guitar from the STS-74
crew to all future Mir and Alpha residents.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Story Updates</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop! Thief!! A report of a burglary at the home of
astronaut Bonnie Dunbar was filed in October. Here is a short list of the
items taken: All four of her Space Flight medals with her name engraved 
on the back. A Seiko watch flown on all four of her flights with her name 
and the first three flight numbers engraved on the back. A watch 
presented to her aboard the Mir Space Station by the crew of Mir-18. It 
is from the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. Very, very rare. Ron 
Sega's Space Flight medal. She also mentioned that the thieves took 
anything and everything that looked like jewelry along with. She fears 
that most of it may have been melted down by now.</P>

<P>&nbsp;From: Dunbar, Bonnie<BR>
&nbsp;RE: Lost Mementos<BR>
&nbsp;Thursday, October 26, 1995 3:36PM</P>
<P><I>&nbsp;Thank you very much for your help. Please feel free to contact
me or Detective Barton at 713-474-4471 if you need information or find
anything. There is a $1000 reward from crime fighters (?) and a $500 reward
from myself for information leading to an arrest and conviction. Again,
thank you.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie Dunbar </I></P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Missed it by that much?</H4>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;NASA astronaut Scott Parazynski had been forced to quit 
his training for a MIR mission because he does not fit the
'standard' Soyuz seat. Now an 'Izvestiya' article Oct 18, '95, pp 1-2 by
Sergey Leskov, reported Russian space officials 'unofficially' saying,
'the Americans, who are paying for the joint project, have recently started
talking to us in a bass voice, in a commandeering tone. We took umbrage,
decided to show our character, and punished our partner, who forgot
himself, for his disrespectful attitude. If there had been friendship,
there would not have been anthropometry'.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I've heard rumors of this type of behavior by previous
astronauts in Moscow but didn't mention it here and had hoped that the
'problems' had been worked out. Hey guys, Straighten up and fly right!!!</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Congratulations to Jennifer L. Green and Friends and
Partners in Space Organization on their Memorandum of Understanding with
the Aerospace College of Moscow State Aviation Institute on joint Internet
web pages and workshop projects. BH</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>"Space Activist"</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anyone who uses his or her talents to the best of his or her
ability to promote and hasten the realization of an open space frontier."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This means anything! - as a writer of general or textbook
non-fiction, or of hard science fiction, screen plays, poetry, even "filk" songs;
as an editor, publisher, book-seller; as a speaker or event organizer or
exhibitor; as a teacher or curriculum planner; as an artist or model maker; as an
actor, director, or producer; as a merchant; as an engineer, chemist, researcher
in biospherics or experimental agriculture or as a space architect; as an
entrepreneur or venture capitalist; as a lawyer. All these roles, and many more
faceless support tasks, are the essence of either of public outreach in depth, or
of laying concrete foundations, or both.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are far more menu options than those amongst us concerned
only with political action would have us believe. We are more than letter and
check writers, more than phone dialers. We are the people who would move off
planet out onto the space frontier. We do it best by each doing our own thing as
well as we can, not by doing solely what someone else would have us do to pursue
some smaller vision.</P>


<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>"Open" Space Frontier</H3> 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"A future in which people of all walks of life have access to, and
live, work, and play in various settings off Earth."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The NSS Mission Statement reads: "to promote change in social,
technical, economic, and political conditions to advance the day when people will
live and work in space, through public education, political and local chapter
activism, and the publication of the bi-monthly Ad Astra Magazine."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The NSS "Mission-centered goal: by 2010: human settlement in space
with 25 people, launch costs under $50/lb to orbit, and space-generated revenues
of $60 billion."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This reflects crucial influence of former L5 Society members who
chose to stay on board at the time of the L5 - National Space Institute merger in
1987 which created NSS.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;As NSS seems overtly preoccupied with reacting to one crisis after
another in which political pressures would erode the current socialized space
program (in the direction of no program at all) it might seem to the unfamiliar
outside observer that NSS' sole purpose is to promote the continuance of the
government's "closed" frontier policy ("astronauts only, government outposts
only, scientific activities only") in effect since the dawn of the Space Age with
Sputnik in 1957. The NSS Board, however, is firmly on record in support of an
"open" frontier. Given its preoccupation, however, it is clear that the rest of
us must work that much harder at strategies that Open the Frontier - outside NSS,
if need be.</P>


<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>"Commercial Space"</H3> 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"any for-profit endeavor or enterprise which increases the amount,
scope, feasibility, and/or sustainable economic viability of robotic and/or human
presence in Earth orbit and beyond."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;One might get the idea from many space activists that commercial
space means private launch companies and small satellite manufacturers - only!
Even if this is qualified with an "at this stage of the game" this short list
betrays a troubling lack of imagination, coming as it does, from people who say
they want to live somewhere other than on Earth!</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;While it may be easier, and safer, to restrict one's ambitions to
the "toy space" of microsats and small launchers, our goal is to create a
self-sustaining human economy beyond Earth's atmosphere. This clearly requires
commercial entry into man-rated rockets and habitat hardware. This has already
begun. The for-profit SpaceHab shuttle payload bay module is already a reality,
but has faced a rocky road.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Early plans for commercial tourist modules were ill-fated because
they depended either on paper study spacecraft, or upon the government owned
shuttle. Any effort to piggyback commercial for-profit activity on
profit-be-damned agency programs is at the mercy of political pressures and
bureaucratic procedures - hardly a place to put dearly acquired capital.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many put all their hopes on the X-33 program. But the dream of
Cheap Access from NASA seems troublingly self-deceptive. Meanwhile, would-be
commercial players stall.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We clearly need commercial manned access to space. Yet the very
presence of the shuttle system works in a highly preemptive manner to prevent
such access from materializing. What is needed is to tie in with a commercial
manned destination: a commercial space station. With the adoption for the
International Space Station Alpha of the high inclination orbit favored by the
Russians, there has never been more reason than now for an alternative, a
commercial station-depot in a low inclination orbit vastly superior as a staging
and refueling place for deep space missions. Alpha would serve moon and Mars
missions at a severe handicap in comparison. There will also be need in orbit for
more lab space at commercial disposal than ISSA can or will provide.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to dust off the "Space Cartage Act" proposed many
years ago whereby anything once in orbit and without its own motive power, could
be moved to another space location or orbit only by a commercial vehicle.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet there is another kind of entrepreneurial activity which has
the potential to accelerate the realization of an open space frontier. It is not
at the mercy of bureaucratic, administrative, or congressional whim. Why not?
Simply because it is a path that does not threaten powerful vested interests. We
are talking about "spin up" research & development.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Spin up" works like this. The entrepreneur considers the many and
varied technologies that will someday be needed on the space frontier. Next
he/she considers what profitable terrestrial applications there may be for each
of these. There follows a business plan, and ultimately a for-profit terrestrial
enterprise which has the happy effect of pre-developing and de-bugging and
putting "on the shelf" a technology which will one day help open the frontier -
sooner and at less cost.</P>

<H3 align=center>Space Oases</H3>
<P align=center>8/24/'95</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was glad to read your article in the July MMM about Space
Oases and see your emphasis on modularity. This is a concept I've long
advocated for both space development and the development of a powerful
space advocate community. I think the space enthusiast community is going
to come around on the issue of modular space infrastructure development, to
some degree and eventually. But I wonder how much good it will do most
people without a similar approach toward building a politico-economic power
base.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, with regard to modular oases -- whether in space or
on a planetary surface:</P>

<OL>
<LI><P>It is feasible to build a large sphere modularly. One must merely
divide the sphere into appropriately sized and shaped sector volumes. There
are a number of ways to do that. Latitudinal slicing and geodesic
segmenting are the easiest two for me to think of off the top of my head.
Regardless of the particular geometry used one must merely begin with a
balanced rotational system (since we are talking artificial G systems). In
the design cycle the "sectors" (habitable volumes) would be sized as
dictated by economics, required crew size, and various other factors. The
two initial masses (whether both were living spaces or one were merely a
counter weight) would be either hard or soft tethered with further tethers
added
(if necessary) as more modules are added. As an example, for the
longitudinal slicing method, the first modules would be equatorial, as
would all further modules until a torus was completed. Then additional
modules could be added at "higher" latitudes (requiring careful balancing)
or nearer the center of rotation (only requiring equal masses on evenly
spaced sides).</P>

<LI><P>As regards workers shifts: I would propose (if three shifts is the
case) that the factories be located in modules between the living modules
(one to three modules in addition to the living modules). My thoughts are
that factories tend to be noisy, they would pose an unnecessary risk of
pollution to the general population's environment, they pose an unnecessary
risk of catastrophic damage to the living area's life support functions,
and they could be in a constant state of "day time" without affecting any
living volume's schedule.</P>
</OL>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with you regarding modern America's risk aversion
and the nonsensicalness of 1 G bias. But where it is inexpensive enough
economically and logistically I wouldn't rule out lowering risk or raising
gravity levels.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Torus [Helix?] is an elegant solution. I like it! The
most exiting future would see many different options developed and
used.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Modularity both in architecture and in
development/construction schedule would be useful on planetary surfaces as
well. For instance, if a small robotic/remote control digger/hauler were at
work now, how ready could it have an area on the moon for an oasis in ten
or fifteen years? And if every year or two another robot some with similar
some with other capabilities were also sent then how far along could an
oasis be when it finally became feasible to send humans? And as
construction progressed there would be greater and greater incentive to
send humans and less and less of an infrastructure hurdle to overcome.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Triple Helix Space Colony seems ungainly</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature doesn't use the triple helix very much. Myoglobin
molecules, which somewhat resemble triple helices, are crosss-braced. Even
Watson amd Crick's abortive initial attempt at modeling DNA as a triple
helix had an internal backbone holding everything together. It's a rather
ungainly structure.</P>
<P> - Jeff Sanburg,     Skokie, Illinois</P>

<P>EDITOR'S REPLY: Just as the torus space colony has a hub, the helix,
double or single has a hub-shaft. And just as the torus has supporting
spokes connecting it concentrically to the hub, so will the helix, double
or triple, have rhythmically spaced spokes to the central shaft. I was
incapable of illustrating this structural feature in my crude MacPaint
graphics program and hoped that the reader would assume it.</P>

<P>Whether nature uses the triple helix or not is immaterial. The design is
structurally stable from an engineering point of view, and if growth from
all three end points is kept apace, dynamic equilibrium will be maintained.
Nature does use the radial plan (starfish, octopus, flowers, etc.) and the
triple helix can be seen as a radial derivative.  PK</p>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER> Dust Control, Space Suits, Terrestrial Uses</H3>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>11/02/'95</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dust Control" [MMM #89, pp. 5-7] was an execllent article.
There is a way that we could get some of this hardware developed prior to
returning to the moon. The universal door-lock and the turtle-back suit
would appear to have real application in the area of radioactive waste
management and other hazardous environments. The concepts of keeping the
nasties out, shielding, and working at a positive pressure with respect to
your environment are common to both the radioactive waste problem and the
moon.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is becoming increasingly clear that there is an enormous
clean-up effort that must be done in the wake of weapons production and
nuclear power generation both in this country and elsewere. If we could
steer some of the design concepts in this area, the result would be
technologies highly adaptable to the moon.</P>

<P> - <a href="mailto:wollym@aol.com">David Graham</a></P>

<P>EDITOR'S REPLY: Your suggestion is a perfect example of what I've dubbed
"spin-up," pre-developing a technology that will be needed eventually on
the space frontier, now, here on Earth for for-profit terrestrial
applications. The ulterior result is relatively free technology, ready to
go or apply, when we need it in space.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Shielding with Bricks?</H3>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>[posting to artemis-list]<BR>
11/19/'95</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;With walls made of bricks or sandbags of lunar soil, and a
roof made of &lt;mumble&gt; supporting more lunar soil, we can provide the
same protection and still have access to the exterior surface of the
habitat.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some questions: How quickly does the habitat need to be
shielded? Does it have to be accomplished during the initial manned mission
or can it be done telerobotically after the first team leaves?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as brickmaking is concerned, do we know how to make
bricks at the Moonbase using equipment that will fit into the first
mission's mass budget? I thought brickmaking would involve producing a
glass base product, melting it and using it as a bonding agent in the
bricks. Is there another way? Maybe using the regolith's natural clinging
properties and a gas operated pressurized ram mold?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar concerns for "sandbagging" lunar soil. Several
hundred lightweight plastic and fiber reinforced plastic bags wouldn't
weigh that much. But it would probably take a little time to fill them up
by hand. The process could be automated but that means the machinery
would have to be there to do it. Maybe a simple frame holding an electric
vibrating hopper with a bag changer/end-closure device at the outfeed.
Still have to have some sort of lunar earth mover to keep adding material
to the hopper as well as a mechanism to remove and stack the bags as they
are completed. Sounds like a system that would work best if there were
people around to clear any malfunctions. Supervising it might be a full
time job.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply piling dirt on top of the compound with a
teleoperated scooper may be the best way to go at first. Although taking
a brickmaking outfit and setting up business might do a lot to make people
understand that we are serious about building a full fledged moonbase and
that we are there to stay. You don't start a brick factory if you aren't
serious about construction!</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If it's essential to have external access to the first
habitat then I suppose an aluminum frame could be set up like a spindly
greenhouse (without the glazing) covering the habitat. The center "roof"
supports could be attached to the habitat itself. A reinforced tarp or
blanket draped over the frame and the whole thing buried using the scooper.
Won't be beautiful.</P>
 - <a href="mailto:jnobles@sneezy.midtenn.net">Jim Nobles</a>

<P>EDITOR'S REPLY: Given the angularity of lunar regolith particles,
tamping soil into a mold and lightly sintering it with solar heat or
microwaves should produce serviceable bricks or blocks. Fiberglass
reinforcement should not be necessary for most low performance
applications.</P>

<P>If the first setup crew stays only a week or so, the amount of radiation
they receive will be tolerable. So the shielding could be put in place
telerobotically after the first crew departs and before the next
arrives.</P>

<P>Your automated bagging process suggestion has merit. It will have to
compete, in terms of equipment mass to be imported from Earth, with
sinter-block making.</P>

<P>While simply bulldozing regolith is far the simplest method, it backs
the moonbase operation into a corner so far as future expansion options are
concerned. It may be wiser, as you suggest, to build a shed hanger and
place modules underneath where they can be hooked up to one another in a
growing complex with much less complication. See MMM #89 OCT '95
"Shielding on the Moon: Digging in for longer stays."</P>

<P>EDITOR'S REPLY: While most space activists rejoiced and sang Hallelujah
when NASA agreed to take the single stage rocket technology program under
its wing, we shuddered, seeing in the move the probable death knell for
"Cheap Access." That NASA could do such a program right is so
counterintuitive as to be a textbook case of an oxymoron.</P>

<P>Nonetheless, I'd be delighted to have my fears and suspicions proven
groundless. It is with this hope that I am wrong that MMM regularly carries
the Space Access Update column of Henry Vanderbilt (which we did not
receive this month in time for inclusion) - PK</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER> No pity on those who stole the future!</H3>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>9/23/95</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I finally got to see "Apollo 13" and it was a strange
emotional experience. I was probably the only person in the theatre who
has actually ever met any of the people involved. So it was a lonely,
personal event. I understood virtually every line of dialogue and knew so
much about other events that were going on that weren't mentioned - the
pogo, the problems convincing the computers that they really should do a
sep with the LEM still attached - that I was <I>there</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron Howard brought it alive and my own knowledge and my
private memories from my days as a CMU Sophomore made it 1970 again.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;And afterwards - blind rage. I left the theatre and stopped
for a pint on the way back. With every sip I cursed the political wanks who
killed Apollo. May their souls be damned to eternal torment in the deepest
foulest pits that hell has to offer. May dogs piss on their graves.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no smiley to this. I have no pity on those who
stole my future.</P>

<H2 align=center>Editorial</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>SSF's "Alpha Town" proposal hits all the right notes</P>
<P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>by <A HREF="mailto:kohkmmm@execpc.com">Peter Kokh</A></P></font>

<P>After having for years opposed both the Space Station Freedom program
and the successor International Space Station Alpha project, the Space
Frontier Foundation has found a better alternative than "if you can't 
beat them, join them."; "If you can't beat them, get them to join you!"; 
better sums up SFF's recent (11/10/95) "Alpha Town"; proposal.</P>

<P>By this plan, Alpha would become the kernel of the first economically
self-sustaining town in orbit. "Alpha Town encompasses the concept of the
station as the financial and institutional hub of a business park." As
described by SFF Senior Advisor Tom Rogers, the important actions called
for are:</P>

<ol>
<LI>Handing over the operation of the US portion of the station to an
innovative commercial contractor as soon as possible, with the
understanding that the facility be operated in an entrepreneurial, 
profit-oriented and cost-reducing manner.
<LI>Competitively bidding all payloads and passenger flights to and from 
the US portion of the station amongst US launch firms.
<LI>Requiring that all expansion of the US portion of the station beyond
the current design be leased from US commercial firms.
<LI>Assuring that all domestic and international laws, treaties and
agreements involving Alpha Town create a level playing field for US firms
and act to encourage private investment in space.
</ol>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Converting the civil Space Station program into an
economically viable outpost in orbit -- the heart of "Alpha Town," achieves
the Chairman's vision -- it makes the project relevant, gives it an easily
understandable rationale for the taxpayers and will eventually make human
space flight as important to the American public as airline travel is
today."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Proponents of the concept see "Alpha Town" as the
"federal heart of a bustling free-enterprise based community, carrying
on all types of activities from science to new product development and <a
target="_top" href="/adb/02/07/ssto-business-plan.html">tourism</a>".</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This concept is a great start in the right direction. The
MMM editor and the Lunar Reclamation Society are happy to endorse it. There
will be considerable resistance to letting commercial and for-profit
interests play in this multi-governmental sandbox. Still, we need to aim
yet higher to hit even that mark. We think the above provisions offer a
basic core and can benefit from further embellishment and offer the
following additional suggested improvements: </P>
<OL>
<li value=5>We need to dust off the late 1970s' "Space Cartage Act" 
proposal, by which only commercial operators could carry equipment or 
personnel between space locations (between orbits). This would put an 
effective limit on NASA's operational "career." We'll need a commercial 
tug marina.
<li value=6>Commercial refueling depot, cryogenic scavenging, etc. as 
proposed in the SSI '88/89 Systems Study
<li value=7>Bid for a Commercially operated "hotel" module.
<li value=8>Derelict satellite salvage and refurbishment and sales -- i.e., a
commercially operated hangar with pressurized bays.
<li value=9>Draft legislation requiring that additional stations with U.S.
involvement in other orbits be wholly commercial</OL>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;SFF has shown considerable and vocal annoyance at the often
poor signal-to-noise ratio within NSS, but that often and unfortunately
paralyzing chatter is what one must expect of any organization which
attempts to run itself democratically. Yet we hope the NSS Policy
Committee and Spacecause will adopt and agree to cosoponsor the Alpha Town
proposal. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;All this may be for naught, however. The Russians, beset by
continuing political and economic upheaval, may yet pull out of the Space
Station Alpha deal, preferring to continue to grow and update the present
Mir I, an option most U.S. observers find unworkable, or "not worth our 
bother."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We won't be in suspense for long. Construction on S.S. 
Alpha is due to begin late next year. Meanwhile, any legislative efforts
along the lines sketched above won't be wasted. It will be in place for
successor efforts, if needed. Regardless of the flux of this international
drama, NSS policy makers ought to give serious, favorable attention to this
SFF proposal.</P>

<H2 align=center>ARS AD ASTRA</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>1st Art Exhibition in Earth Orbit on EUROMIR 95</P>
<P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Press Release: 12/3/'95, sent to MMM by <a
href="mailto:benhuset@skypoint.com">Ben Huset</a>, MNSFS<br>
Copyright &copy; 1995 The OURS Foundation</P></font>


<p align=center>The Ars ad Astra Winner is:</P>
<h3 align=center>Elisabeth Carroll Smith</h3>
<br><br>
<H4 align=center>The Cosmonaut Art Jury</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 3, 1995, twenty works of art on the theme 
"Space & Humanity" that were selected through an international competition
accompanied European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Thomas Reiter to the Mir
space station on his 180 day EUROMIR 95 mission. Picture of Mir Space
Station Ars ad Astra represents the first time in histroy that artists have
been invited to have their art works included in the world's space program
-- in space.</P>


<H4 align=center>The Announcement: Live From Space</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas Reiter and his two Russians colleagues -- Sergei Avdeev
and Yuri Ghidzenko -- had the task of deciding which of the twenty art works
best fulfilled the theme of the project. After more than one week of
deliberations the cosmonauts made their difficult decision. They first
narrowed down their choice to ten works, then to just three. The painting
they liked the best was "When Dreams Are Born" by American artist Elisabeth
Carroll Smith.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision was announced during a live 20-minute video
link-up with the Mir station on November 30 at 17.00 in the afternoon as a
part of ESA's "Art & Space" event which was hosted by the Euro Space Center
in Transinne, Belgium.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas Reiter said that the crew took this task very
seriously and that having art in their environmant was a welcome and
important addition to the strenuous scientific activities that must be
carried out by all astronauts.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The astro-jury showed how they displayed the art exhibition
in the Mir by attaching the pictures to the station walls. 81 pictures
including digitized versions of the 20 originals were stored in an
electronic archive in the ESA on-board portable computer.</P>

<H4 align=center>The Awards</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The winner, a professional pilot, had to make special
arrangements with her employer to be present for this once-in-a-lifetime
event. She received a special Omega Speedmaster Professional Chronograph
that was on the Mir for one year and which is valued at more than $10,000.
The prize was sponsored by the Swiss watch company OMEGA SA. ESA astronaut
Ulf Merbold presented the artist with an art print that had flown with him
on his EUROMIR 94 mission. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Her work will stay on the Mir space station to entertain
future crews and as a symbolic statement about adding a cultural dimension
to humanity's space activities. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirteen of the twenty space artists were present to hear
the live announcement from space. Although most artists came from Europe,
some travelled from as far away as Mexico and the United States to be there
to hear the result.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;They were: Alessandro Bartolozzi from Italy; Marcy Burt
Butz, Peter Binz and Andrea Thueler from Switzerland; Chris Couvee from The
Netherlands; Peter Eickmeyer, Karl Draeger, and Rudolf Hanke from Germany;
Claudine Varesi from Mexico; Marilynn Flynn from the United Arab Emirates;
and Ruth Trapane, Elisabeth Carroll Smith and Amy Zofko from the United
States. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of these artists received a prize of LASCAUX artists'
paints donated by the Swiss producer of fine art materials LASCAUX - Alois
Diethelm AG. The paints sets were valued at $250 each.</P>


<H4 align=center>Art & Education: Space & Humanity </H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately one hundred art students from different
European schools were also present at the Euro Space Center to participate
in the event. They were introduced to European space activities by ESA
representatives, had a chance to use the center's facilities, and got to
meet European astronaut Ulf Merbold. Five students were picked to ask the
Mir crew questions about their experiences in space. Some students brought
with them a piece of art that they have made on the same theme -- Space &
Humanity. Reproductions of the 20 paintings in space and the student
artworks were put on display at the center. A "Cosmic" fashion show and a
"vernissage" of the art exhibition taking place on both Earth and in space
capped the events of this exciting day.</P>


<H4 align=center>The International Exhibition Tour</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the original art works except for the one chosen to
stay on the Mir station will be returned to Earth at the end of the EUROMIR
95 mission. The Ars ad Astra art works will become a part of the "Art to
the Stars" exhibition of space art which is currently on an international
exhibition tour including stops in Oslo, Berlin, Turin, New York and
Beijing.</P>


<H4 align=center>The OURS Foundation</H4>

<P><B>Ars ad Astra:</B> The 1st Art Exhibition in Earth Orbit and the "Art

<P><FONT SIZE=2>by <A HREF="mailto:kohkmmm@execpc.com">Peter Kokh</A></P></font>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;While "new traditions" (as oxymoronic as it sounds) are 
being made all the time, there is little doubt that those that command
our observance most deeply are those which are oldest, rooted in our
collective gitgo times. So it is with Holidays: Christmas, Easter, New
Years go back millennia (two at least). Thanksgiving goes back nearly four
centuries. The 4th of July will be 220 years old next time around.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We can expect that as the lunar frontier becomes fully
established with the coming of age of the first native born generation of
Lunans, the holidays and festivals they will most cherish will include
those observed by those establishing the first beachhead.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Apollo 11 landing (July 20th) is sure to be observed, as
is the "infamous" day of retreat, the liftoff of the Apollo 17 crew 
(December 10th). But neither of these "trivia" dates will rival the 
enthused celebration of the "Day of the Return" when humans come back to 
the moon intent on setting up an open-ended "permanent" presence leading 
to genuine settlement.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The first crew may only set up camp and then return to
Earth, to be followed by the first crew intent on staying a full day-night
cycle (the lunar "sunth") or more. So closely connected with the 
observance of the Day of the Return will be the celebration of that first
successful "overnighting" and the greeting of that first "sunrise" -- 
"First Night's End."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, "Ever Since Day" will mark commencement of 
uninterrupted human presence on the moon. If I were to put a friendly
wager on which of these will be the most honored in Lunan settlement
tradition, it would be on "First Night's End." There will be a special 
flavor to this holiday, the shared mutual congratulations at having 
survived this "initiation" imposed by the moon itself. And for all 
non-native born Lunans, there will be a special personal resonance
with memories of their very own "First Night" and "First Night's End."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Other history-rooted anniversaries may mark the birth of the
first native born Lunan. And later, the first native born grandchild (i.e.,
second generation, whose health will be the final test of whether or not
humans can stay on the moon indefinitely) [See MMM #47 JUL '91, p.5 
"Native Born"]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all Lunan Holidays and festivities will take root in
such historic occurrences. Some are sure to be bound up with the moon's 
natural rhythms, much as a growing minority of us terrestrials observe 
the equinoxes and solstices. Local sunset and local sunrise will be big 
deals, something to mark with a special meal or wine or friends --
simply because they occur on a 28+ day cycle, not a 24 hour one.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If a particularly appropriate Lunan Calendar is adopted [see
MMM #7 JUL '87, "Moon Calendar"], with "sunths" of 28.5 (24 hr.) days 
instead of 30.5 day calendar months, with the discrepancy with Earth 
reckoning made up with occasional "leap" ("intercalary") "sunths" or 
weeks, Lunar New Years may only approximate the fall of New Years on 
Earth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a case, the observance of religious feasts and holy
days may also vary with that on Earth, without spiritual harm to those who
honor them. This will be much to the chagrin and resistance of religious
fundamentalists (those who give major importance to the minor, and minor
importance to what really matters, and call every one else heretic and
infidel.)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Solar Eclipses on the moon are the flip side of Lunar
Eclipses on Earth. They will be much more of an experience for Lunan
pioneers and settlers than any eclipse on Earth (even total Solar). They
will last several hours locally, and possibly may occasion the morning or
afternoon "off" (work or school) as the case may be. And it will be the 
most favorable time for looking for city lights on Earth's nighttime 
face.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In time, other "political" milestones will come to be 
honored in settlement tradition -- the day when home rule is won, or
independence declared, for example.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Historic and festive holidays will not be the only
early-rooted traditions. Pioneering songs and ballads, even candidate
settlement anthems, are sure to be written, sung, performed, and loved.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There may arise too special festive foods with historic
significance. We have pretzels and crossover buns associated with Lent,
unleavened bread associated with Passover. Eggnog, Christmas cookies,
Easter Eggs, and Pumpkin Pie are among many foods especially popular at
specific festive times. On the moon, many long-loved foods and recipe
delights will not be available early on. Special early frontier substitute
food and menu items, beverages too, even if in time the need to make such
substitutions eases, may be prepared and consumed with relish on
commemorative occasions. Associated with such holiday tradition meals may
be time-revered toasts, blessings, and mutual greetings.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain plants are associated with various observances on
Earth; poinsettias and mistletoe with Christmas, for example. And plants
grown successfully in the early outpost days may come to be associated with
various Lunan observances in like fashion.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The first humans to return to the moon may think that all
they are doing is erecting, deploying, setting up, demonstrating, testing,
etc. But even the little incidental things they do may in time take on
special meaning and color not at all obvious at first, to become ritually
repeated. This will all occur sometimes spontaneously, other times with
alertness, if not deliberateness, as a part of fulfilling the very human
need to impose on nature's own rhythms, a festive and commemorative
cultural rhythm of our own. Such cultural rhythms are a major element of
the social glue that binds generations together. In this way they will bind
future Lunan generations, much as similar traditions have always served in
terrestrial communities throughout the globe, and throughout historic and
pre-historic times.</P>

Moon Guns & Other Mysteries

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;About Moon guns... As it happens, I even have some 
thoughts about the subject at hand.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of building a chemical gun to launch propellants
from the moon is intriguing, but I'd shy away from comparing it to an 
electric gun. We're faced with its own interesting technology challenges. 
As best I can tell, to make a chemical gun work we'd need all the industries
required to support an electromagnetic launcher, plus a lot more. Here's
what I'm thinking. Correct my concept of this thing if I got it wrong.</P>

<H4>Propellants...</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue is making the propellants from lunar
material. You mentioned the lack of nitrogen on the moon. Some nitrogen 
is mixed in with the regolith, but exporting scarce, life-critical elements
from the moon would be a self-defeating business.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ditto for the idea of exporting hydrogen. You mention using
hot hydrogen as a working fluid in one of your posts, but I'd advise
against it. If you start a business that wastes hydrogen on the moon, it
will last just as long as it takes other loonies to wreck it. The stuff is
too precious.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The good news is that there are lots of ways to make
propellants from lunar material. You need a fuel, <a
href="/adb/04/03/10/04/oxygen-extraction.html" target="_top">oxydizer</a>,
and perhaps some other elements to control the burning rate. Any mixture
that gives you gasses which will support a supersonic burning wave front (a
Chapman-Jouget wave) will work.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The hard part is getting that mixture. We'll have to
disassemble moon rock to do this. To get the oxygen we're exporting, we'll
need essentially the same processes. Chemically the function of the gun 
is to reassemble the compounds we took apart. But making propellants for a
chemical gun means additional chemical processes, all new technology that
will have to be developed at some non-zero cost.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we make the propellants, we'll need containers, for 
storage, logistics, and getting the propellants into the gun. That means 
more manufacturing processes, more machining, more technology to develop.</P>

<h4>Gun Structure...</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Here it gets really complicated. We need a precisely 
machined barrel, able to contain some pretty high chamber pressures. It'll
be miles long unless you're willing to build your payload to withstand
thousands of g's.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;A fuel tank robust enough to take that kind of acceleration
is a whole new engineering challenge. It wouldn't be useful as a container
for rocket propellants and in this scenario won't be recoverable, so I
assume you don't want to do this.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;That leaves us with the metallurgical challenge of making
the material for the barrell, and then machining it. Now we're into really
heavy industry on the moon. I don't have time to estimate the initial
capital required to get that much heavy machinery to the moon, but just the
thought of it boggles my mind. The alternative is building up heavy
industry on the moon one step at a time, which adds a few decades to the
program schedule.</P>

<h4>Conclusions...</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the technology challenges and capital required to
develop that big chemical gun on the moon, my best guess is that
electromagnetic propulsion would be considerably betterfastercheaper to
implement. Linear induction motors are fairly straightforward so the
technology isn't scary. The important structural components -- supports for
the magnets and payloads -- are massive but don't need to be as precise as
a chemical gun's barrel; we're not building a giant pressure-containing
cylinder.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic industries supporting either operation involve
mining moondirt, separating the chemicals, and making metal; and both need
a good <a target="_top"
href="/adb/04/03/03/power-source-comparison.html">power supply</a>. For
electromagnetic propulsion we're ready to go when we can make aluminum wire
and machine the fiddly bits that keep the parts together. We'll even need
wire to support control of the chemical gun, too. The chemical gun needs
much lower power levels for its operation, but the fundamental industry is
the same; we're still smelting aluminum and extruding it through a die to
make wire.</P>

<h4>Nevertheless...</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;All that said, I can still think of an economic argument for
the gun: it looks neat. The muzzle flash against a dark sky would be
awesome; you'd know something is happening when that behemoth fires! It
might even sound neat if the ground shock gets transmitted to a nearby
habitat. So even if it takes more industry development to do it, a big
chemical gun might be economically Worth Doing because its entertainment
value might add enough to make up for the cost of developing the additional
machining capability. In comparison, an electromagnetic launcher would be
boring. Think of it as an attraction at the Great Theme Park In The Sky.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;One more argument in favor of doing this: These days we
flinch at the word "spinoff", but the additional industrial capability we'd
get from being able to do all that heavy machining should spark your
imagination. If we can make a cannon barrel on the moon, we'll be able to
make just about anything.</P>

<H2 align=center>Arthur C. Clarke Nominated for Nobel Peace Prize</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>Communications Satellite Inventor Honored for Promoting
World Understanding as<BR>"The Philosopher of the Global Village"</P>
<P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>info: <A HREF="mailto:prospace@aol.com">David
Brandt</A></P></font>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Science fiction and science writer Arthur C. Clarke is
receiving an unusual birthday present. Clarke, who has just turned 78, is
being nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Clarke is probably best known as the author of
<CITE>2001: A Space Odyssey</CITE>, the nomination, authored by National Space Society
Director Glenn H. Reynolds, a law professor at the University of Tennessee,
cites Clarke's invention of the geosynchronous communications satellite.
Clarke proposed the technology in an October 1945 article in the magazine
<CITE>Wireless World</CITE>. The first such satellite was launched less than twenty
years later, and they are now commonplace, mainstays of everything from
international telephony to CNN.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Reynolds, this invention has gone a long way
toward promoting world peace. In his nominating letter he writes: </P>
<blockquote>
<P>"I do not believe it to be an exaggeration when I say that the global 
communications revolution made possible by satellite communications has 
been the most powerful single force for world peace in the post-World War 
Two era. Worldwide television reportage, made possible by satellites, has 
been instrumental in preventing bloodshed on many occasions. It has
prompted the dispatch of U.N. Peacekeeping forces (themselves Nobel Peace
Prize awardees) on many occasions; it has caused combatants to draw back
from the brink of hostilities on others; it has produced strong pressures
to avoid civilian casualties; and it has discouraged governments from using
force against dissident elements in their own civilian populations. It may
well have been responsible for the change in consciousness that resulted in
the end of the Cold War and the first steps toward freedom in the former
Soviet Union."</P></blockquote>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Clarke has also served as (in the <CITE>Washington Post's</CITE> own
words) "the philosopher of the Global Village," offering important
observations and cautions on topics ranging from the threat to the world's
oceans posed by pollution, to the danger to astronauts posed by "space
junk." He has also supported numerous humanitarian efforts in his adopted
home of Sri Lanka.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will science fiction fans around the globe rally in support
of Clarke? "He deserves it," says Reynolds.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Why most planets and asteroids have Clarke orbits, and most
moons do not</P>
<P><HR WIDTH=80%></P>

<P>The location of, even the very existence of, surface-synchronous 
orbits depends on three factors:</P>
<ul type=circle>
<li>The mass of the planet, moon, or asteroid in question
<LI>Its rotation period
<LI>Its proximity to deeper gravity wells
</ul>


<P>The more massive the body in question, the farther out will be any
surface-synchronous orbit, all else being equal and the periods of the
compared bodies being closely similar.</P>

<P>Earth and Mars have similar periods or days of 24 hours and 24 hrs. 37
minutes respectively. Earth's geosynchronous orbit lies some 23,000 miles 
above the surface. The synchronous orbit for Mars, with only a tenth of 
Earth's mass, lies 10,500 miles above the surface. In contrast, a 24 hr. 
orbit above Saturn (95 times more massive than Earth) would lie about 
160,000 miles above its cloudtops.</P>

<P>The slower a body rotates, the farther out will be any
surface-synchronous orbit.</P>

<P>If Earth rotated in 48 hrs rather than 24, its synchronous orbit would 
lie nearly 39,000 miles above the surface [period^2= distance^3 (from 
planet center)]. Conversely, if Earth rotated in just 12 hours, its 
geosynchronous orbit would lie just 13,000 miles above the equator.</P>

<P>If the theoretical surface-synchronous orbit lies beyond the closest
Lagrange point of a more massive body, a synchronous orbit will not exist
as any object following such an orbit would fall into the dominant gravity
well of the larger object.</P>

<P>The moon's rotation period, locked to the period of its orbit about
Earth, is a lazy 28.53 days. If the moon were an isolated body off by
itself, i.e., not a satellite of Earth or some other close and more massive
dominant body, its surface synchronous orbit, i.e., one with a period of
28.53 days, would lie about 55,000 miles out. In actuality, such an orbit
would run over the shoulder of the moon's gravity well into Earth's 
gravity well on the side facing Earth.</P>

<P>Most natural planetary satellites or moons have had their original
rotations slowed, or speeded up, by overwhelming tidal forces until their
rotation is locked to their orbital period, so that they always keep the
same face turned toward their planet. Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto
always keep the same face turned toward Jupiter, Titan and its siblings,
the same face towards Saturn, etc. Likewise, their would-be
surface-synchronous orbits run over the lip of the gravity well interfaces
with their host planet.</P>

<P>For communications on tidally locked planetary moons, there are three
solutions:</P>

<ul type=square>
<li>a constellation of satellites in swift close-in orbits;
<LI>fewer satellites in very eccentric "Molniya" type orbits with their 
apogee (at which they move slowest and near which they spend by far the 
most time each orbit) above the place needing communications;
<LI>relay satellites at planet-moon L4 and L5 co-orbital Lagrange points,
respectively centered some 60&#176; ahead of and behind the moon in its
orbit about its planet at the same distance from the moon as the planet.
</ul>

<P>For the moon, L4 and L5 lie 238,000 miles out, fully ten times farther
out than Earth's geosynchronous orbit, meaning longer lag times and
requiring more broadcast power. </P>

<P>On the other hand, as small as asteroids are, their shallow gravity
wells are far enough removed from those of more massive planets, that they
can enjoy surface-synchronous orbits. Ceres, with a period of 9.08 hrs. has
a Clarke orbit just 486 miles above its equator.</P>

<P><B>February, 1996</B> -- The C.I.S. manned space station Mir with Mir-20
(call sign 'Uran') Cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko, Sergei Avdeyev and Thomas
(DF4TR / DP0MIR) Reiter and will be appearing in the mid west US morning
skies Jan 11th to Feb 7th, and return to evening skies Feb 11th to March
3rd.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Amateur radio operators can log into the Mir 'Packet'
(R0MIR-1) BBS on 145.550MHz simplex -- and soon on 435.775MHz uplink /
437.975 downlink MHz. The cosmonauts also use the freq. 145.200MHz, up and
145.800MHz down or 435.725MHz up / 437.925MHz down or 145.550Mhz simplex 
to talk or send SSTV video with amateur radio operators on the ground 
during their off-hours.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Messages from Mir:</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello you people on Earth. This is not Santa Claus here, 
this is the Russian Space Station Mir calling, crew 20. As you are on
Earth, we are celebrating Christmas Eve today, here in Earth Orbit, and 
we wish you all a Merry Christmas, a Peaceful and Happy New Year and I will
hand over now to Yuri who will also direct some words to you."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello folks. This is your space station calling with a
recorded TGIF Message. I guess this will be the last TGIF message for this
year, so we all wish you an especially nice Friday Evening, and hope you
have some especially nice drinks, please don't forget to have some drinks
for us, for Yuri, Serge and myself. Many Greetings, 73 and Bye Bye."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roma-zero-MIR Roma-zero-MIR Russian Mir Space Station
wishing you a Happy New Year! This is Crew Number 20 of Space Station Mir
here working. Yuri Gidzenko Board commander, Board Engineer Thomas Reiter,
and myself Sergei Avdeyev Board Engineer #1. We wish you hello and A Very
Happy Next Year!!! This is Mir Space Station."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"MIR-station, 1/1/1996. Hello Ladies and Gentlemen, First 
of all we want to wish you a happy, healthy, peaceful and successful new 
year! In case some of you tried to contact us yesterday afternoon or
during the night might have recognized, that there was some interruption
from our side. We are very sorry for that, but the power-supply for our two
radios had failed. So we installed the old power supply and reset
everything. Unfortunately, we will not be able to run the TM733 with this
old power-supply, as it doesn't provide enough current. So let's see, what
we can do about this. In the meantime the 'old' ICOM-station and the 'old'
TNC are running. Once again, all the best for the new year, 73's from 
Yuri, Sergei, Thomas."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Russian cosmonauts and a German saw the New Year on
the Mir space station with brandy because it is hard to sip champagne in
zero gravity, Itar-Tass news agency said. One of the three men dressed up
as Santa Claus, or Father Frost as he is known in Russia. A cargo craft
recently brought small artificial fir trees, food and gifts for the
cosmonauts.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Next Russian Launch:</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;February 21, 1996 Soyuz TM-23 / EO-21. Primary crew: Yuri
Onufrienko, Yuri Usachev. The crew of Mir EO-20 is scheduled to return on
Feb. 29th.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shuttle Amateur Radio EXperiment, or SAREX will fly
again on Shuttle Mission STS-76 which will dock again with Mir. Launch is
set for March 21, 1996 at 08:34 UTC (2:34 AM CST) from the Kennedy Space
Center, Cape Canaveral, Florida. Landing is scheduled for March 30, 1996 at
17:07 UTC (11:07 AM CST) at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. It will be a
9-day mission.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Among those in the crew who hold amateur licenses are,
Astronaut Richard A. Searfoss KC5CKM who will serve as the Shuttle's Pilot,
Mission Specialist Linda M. Godwin, N5RAX and Ronald M. Sega, KC5ETH. The
remaining crew members include Commander Kevin P. Chilton, and Mission
Specialists Shannon W. Lucid (who is expected to have her amateur license
by that time) and Michael R. Clifford. Shannon will stay aboard Mir for 5
months.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Astronaut Thagard leaves NASA, returns to Alma Mater:</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Space Shuttle Astronaut Dr. Norman E. Thagard has retired
from NASA and returned to his alma mater, Florida State University. He
leaves the space agency following five space missions, STS-7, 51-B, 30, 42,
Mir-18/STS-71, including a U.S. record four-month stay aboard Russia's
space station Mir. Thagard has spent over 140 days in space -- more than
any other American.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thagard accepted the position of Visiting Professor and
Director of External Relations for the Florida A&M University -- Florida
State University College of Engineering, Tallahassee. His initial
assignment, effective Jan. 5, is teaching electronics, an area that has
been a long-time hobby. Thagard has published several articles on digital
and analog electronics design.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;To join Space Access Society or buy the SSTO/DC-X V 3.0
video we have for sale (Two hours, includes all eight DC-X flights, X-33,
DC-X and SSTO backgrounders, aero-spike engine test-stand footage, plus
White Sands Missile Range DC-X pre and post flight footage) mail a check
to:</P>

<p align=center>SAS, 4855 E Warner Rd #24-150, Phoenix AZ 85044</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;SAS membership with direct email of Space Access Updates is
$30 US per year; the SSTO V 3.0 video is $25, $5 off for SAS members, $8
extra for shipping outside the US and Canada, VHS NTSC only.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We've been hearing questions lately, wondering if we'd left
the planet ahead of everyone else. We've been very busy with some
long-term payoff work, and there's been no one earthshaking development in
the affordable access field, so we let the next Update slide "for a week 
or two..." And now it's over ten weeks, and the little things happening a 
bit at a time have begun to add up to some interesting trends. It's 
Update time again -- but for now, the condensed holiday version.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of you waiting for video tapes, all the back-ordered
version 2.0 DC-X/SSTO tapes went into the mail December 22nd. Our 
apologies for the massive delay. You will find in them a discount
certificate for the 3.0 video by way of amends. The long-overdue version
3.0 X-33/DC-X/SSTO video now looks like it will be ready to go to the
duplicators the first week of January; backorders will be in the mail
immediately thereafter. Yes, we most likely got your order; we've been
holding off cashing the checks out of the remnants of a sense of decency
and fair play. We hope you'll think the footage we've found is worth the
wait. We hope you won't march on SAS HQ with tar and feathers in the
meantime...</P>

<center><font size=5>Space Access '96 Confernece</font></P></center>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;And it's getting toward that time of year again. Our next
annual conference, Space Access '96, will be happening April 26-28 1996,
Friday evening through Sunday afternoon, once again in Phoenix, Arizona.
We're going to go bigtime aerospace one of these years, do it during the
working week at a posh resort at a thousand bucks a head, but not yet --
SA'96 registration is still only $80 if postmarked before January 15th,
when it goes up to $90, higher at the door. SA'96 will again be at a hotel
within easy shuttle-bus distance of the Phoenix airport; we're currently
negotiating with several and should have one nailed down shortly. Previous
attendees, tell 'em -- this really is worth the trouble to attend. Phoenix
is a hub for Southwest and America West, and also served by Western
Pacific, Continental, United, Delta, American, etc. There's no lack of
cheap airfares if you plan ahead -- so be here!</P>

<center><font size=5>Reusable Launch News Summary</font></P></center>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The capsule version of the news: DC-XA is coming along OK,
albeit the minor delays are piling up to the point where we'd guess it'll
be a few weeks late flying, late spring rather than early.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;NASA tried to cancel X-34 at the start of November, but
there was no wooden stake handy (actually the White House intervened), so
it lives still, more or less -- development cost is climbing, performance
dropping, schedule slipping, and we hear that projected ops costs are
rising to more or less the same as Pegasus. Which makes sense, since X-34
now has as many stages as a Pegasus -- carrier aircraft, winged booster, two
upper stages -- and will likely be at least as complex to integrate and
operate.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;X-33 is doing OK; the picture is beginning to firm up as to
what might actually fly and how much it'll cost. Much more on this next
Update.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The X-33 draft Phase 2 CAN (phase 2 is the actual
construction and flight test of one or more X-33's, starting this summer)
can be found at
<a  target="_top" href="http://www.space-access.org">
http://www.space-access.org</a>, our new under-construction web page.
(Please, no critiques until we've actually had time to do something with
the site!)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Comments on the draft CAN are due January 22nd; email any
comments you have to us at <a href="mailto:space.access@space-access.org">
space.access@space-access.org</a> at least one week before that, and we'll
run the interesting ones past our advisory board before finalizing SAS's
formal comments. After a once-over, we think it looks pretty good; the
only "gotcha" we've spotted so far is the clause linking an X-33 go-ahead
next summer to continued existance of X-34. Tsk, tsk, naughty naughty, we
say -- that's a pretty raw attempt to hold X-33 hostage to the highly
dubious X-34 project on someone's part.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;X-33 funding for FY'96 looks fairly assured over on the NASA
side, if the HUD/VA/Independent Agencies appropriation ever gets clear of
the [government shut-down] "train wreck." In theory, there's $25M for
reusable rocket work actually appropriated now over in DOD, but the DOD
bill was signed only because the White House has to pay for the Bosnia
expedition somehow. Look for a major, multi-billion DOD rescissions list
in the coming months, and look for an attempt to put our $25M on it. And
once we beat that, look for months of delay in releasing the money. This
is getting to be a familiar fight, but it's one we've won every time so
far.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;And both McDonnell-Douglas and Lockheed-Martin are investing
around $300 million each of private money in upgraded expendable commercial
launch vehicles (<a  target="_top"
href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/delta-3.html">Delta 3</a> and Atlas 2AR
respectively), and both Kistler Aerospace and Kelly Space & Technology have
money and are going ahead with their private reusable space launch 
ventures. We just might get to the point where government funding is
irrelevant to a thriving cheap launch industry sooner than anyone expects.

<H3 align=center>Frontier Musings</H3>
<P align=center>[cf. MMM #91 DEC '95, p.6 "Personnel"]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, when I'm musing about the mechanics of lunar
settlement, I wonder if we can avoid the "lawless" element that was so much
a part of Earthly frontiers. On Earth, while life on the frontier was not
easy, one generally could live off the land in isolation from others. On
the moon, the frontier physically is much more deadly. I would hope that
this very real danger would cause a much more highly developed sence of
teamwork, partnering, brotherhood, or, in a word, family amoung those that
would dare to venture out from mother Earth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The physical constraints of early lunar settlements will
require a constant monitoring and vigilance by each team member of the
others supporting technology to ensure survival. Most all endeavors,
especially those related to "outside" will have to be two or more person
team efforts for safety reasons. Hopefully a culture will develop from
this where each member's behaviour is guided by a sensitivity and concern
for the welfare of each member of the community at large. Crime, at least
the personal, violent types of crime should be realitively rare. Not
because of some rigid, police-state mentality, but because we recognize
that we are individually weak against a powerful and hostile nature. Our
only hope of survival is in viewing each other as part of ourselves and
caring for each other as we care for our own flesh.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>[cf. MMM #87 JUL '95 p.10, "The Brass Spittoon"]<br>
[from a post ll/19/95 to artemis-list@lunacity.com]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the Artemis Ireland reunions we can sit around the
turf fire screen saver and sing old songs like The Rising of the Earth? And
declare it a bohdran free zone?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a serious side to this. In the earliest days it
will be more like a wartime military post. But as it grows into a frontier
outpost, a good pub will be important to sanity. And thought will have to
go into the design of it so that a good tension-releasing bar brawl will
not leave anything damaged that is either irreplaceable nor will it risk
the integrity of life support.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;A frontier settlement has a psychology to it. And although I
don't want a bunch of social engineers trying to apply academic theories to
"designing" the people and society there, I do think it is necessary to
apply common sense that any expedition head, military leader or old time US
sheriff would have. People who go to frontiers have cut a lot of ties and
will have a burden of memories of things left behind; they will be in an
unforgiving environment in which a slip on their part or that of another,
or a random failure in equipment or procedure can maim or kill; there will
be little to do but work and it will seem like there is so much to be done
that it is a hopeless task; people you have grown to despise can not be
avoided; relationships that failed can never be completely left behind...
in general it will be a high stress environment. This is not to say that
people will be going around frowning. Frontiers are also exciting and fun.
But the invisible stress still builds and there must be socially acceptable
outlets for it. Otherwise we'll end up with a town full of coronaries,
neurotics and axe murderers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;So when I said "a good tension-relieving bar brawl," I meant
just that. Anyone who has ever lived in a seriously tense situation will
understand all. People in Northern Ireland are particularly familiar with
the both coping strategies and the results of failure to do so.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Moon Miners' Manifesto Issue #93</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><!-- /093/hardier-pioneer.html --><H2 align=center>Mars will Require a Hardier Breed of Pioneer</H2><P><HR WIDTH=80%></P><FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:kokhmmm@execpc.com">Peter Kokh</a></FONT><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people envision with enthusiasm an eventual wholesale settlement and colonization of Mars, and I number myself among them. In doing so, we carry forward what has become a radical dream of our species throughout this century. And we have done so, stubbornly, through revolution after revolution in our perceptions about the Red Planet. Banished to the realm of myth are the Mars of Edgar Rice Burroughs, populated by green men and princesses and thoats, and the Mars of Percival Lowell, crisscrossed with canals feeding green strips of irrigated vegetation, defying the creeping desication of the Planet. But gone, too, is the glimpse of a moon-like Mars that we read into the first photos from early Mariner orbiters.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We know now that Mars was once warmer, wet with ocean, rains, and rivers, and lakes, and possibly in early stages of greening. We are all but certain that much of that watery endowment yet remains, locked up in permafrost layers of soil in lower lying basinlands. There may even be liquid subterranean lakes if there are near-surface geothermal pockets still simmering here and there, but we do not know. As to the polar caps, we now know that under a few inches of carbon dioxide frost seasonally chilled out of the atmosphere, there are vast polar ice sheets hundreds of meters thick, at least in the north.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;How much water is there? That is, how extensive and patchy are the permafrost deposits? How thick are they? How fresh or brinish? All these questions must be answered to a first approximation accurate to an order of magnitude before any brainstorming schemes of "terraforming" (or, as we would prefer, of "rejuvenaissance" i.e. not making Mars like Earth, but bringing it back to the more encradling Mars-state it once enjoyed) can be much more than an exercise in "garbage in, garbage out." Which is why MMM has never gotten into such schemes. It is far too premature an exercise.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;What does remain is the promise of a world that is more thoroughly endowed with prerequisites to support human and Earth life than is our own bondsworld, the Moon. Mars would seem to have far more appeal as a homesteading destination for those with enough of the right stuff to be willing to forever forsake the Green Hills of Earth.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But we can indulge in these fantasies, these declarations of willingness to go, only because the need to take a second look has not been thrust upon us by any imminent opportunity to open this frontier. That point of truth is still over the time horizon by an unknown number of years.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;When that time does come and those who've thought themselves ready to go are faced with the decision to "put up or shut up", we think that many, even most, will get cold feet.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;For despite Mars' life-supportive endowments, the challenges and obstacles to the establishment of a long-term human population capable of first enduring, then of thrivingly coming into its own, are daunting. And they are daunting from many points of view: engineering, logistical, biospheric, but above all and most critically, personal.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this last but ultimately most make-or-break class of challenges that we want to discuss here.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;POINT: Mars is farther from Earth than the Moon, much farther. And the implications are compounded.</P><img align=right alt="Comparison Table of the Moon and Mars" src="/images/asi199600051.gif" width=250 height=124><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Resupply, reinforcement, relief, and rescue are always from 6 months to 25 months away. This will mean a reliance on a strategic "egg yolk" policy, as opposed to maintenance of "umbilical" style logistics. On site repair and fabrication shops as well as hospitals, both as to equipment and personnel expertise will need to be very much more complete.  Triage in medical emergencies will have to be accepted by all as a potential personal consequence before leaving Earth.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;It will mean that the personal commitment to the Mars frontier of each pioneer recruit must be individually that much deeper, more "final", that much less open to reconsideration down the line. It will be much more expensive to return to Earth, and the delay time before such a repatriation can be affected will be much, much longer. Only the hardiest, most self-reliant, and resilient personalities should tempt such odds.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense of isolation from the mainstream of human civilization will be much deeper. Electronic communication with Earth will involve response delays of 6 to 44 minutes, not the 2 and a half seconds Lunans will experience. While, in all but live radio communications, those delays can be edited out, the edited conversations will flow jerkily and clumsily. The new "Martians" will tend to turn inward culturally and socially, and go their own way.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;POINT: The Sun not only is further, dimmer, and much less warming, it is noticeably so to the naked eye. Not all of that is bad, of course. On Earth, full sunlight is uncomfortably intense. On Mars the softer light will be still plenty bright enough, and welcome, much as the softly sunny November skies in the northern United States and Canada.</P><table><tr><td>LEFT: On Earth, the Sun shines bright and warm. Our generous oceans act as a thermal sink for that heat, providing an additional mean boost of some 50&#176; F (28&#176;C) over where we'd be without them. Solar collectors do not have to be overly large to tap this energy further.</td><td>RIGHT: On Mars, the Sun is noticeably smaller, less brilliant. The radiant heat it sheds is not enough to warm living things, or people. With no ocean heat sink, it is far colder than its greater distance from the Sun would indicate. Solar collectors have to be much larger in size.</td></tr></table><table><tr><td><img align=right alt="Solar Energy to Earth and Mars" src="/images/asi199600057.gif" height=113 width=220></td></tr></table><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But the smaller Sun will be a constant reminder of the reliefless cycle of very cool and bitterly cold seasons. Martian summers are but caricatures of our own temperate zone warm seasons, not even quite on a thermal par with the patchy thaws of our Antarctic summers.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Martians will learn to cope, to be sure, and grow to find much pleasure and satisfaction in the accommodations they will have to make to acculturate themselves to this new world. But only those with the inner strength and drive to do get over the enormous adjustment hurdles had better set out on such a venture.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;It can best be summed up so. Only a tiny fraction of the numbers who say they would go to Mars had they but the chance to do so, would also be as willing to commit to pioneering the relatively far friendlier fringes of our own Antarctica, with its vast fresh water supplies, breathable sweet air, and surrounding oceans teeming with life and food. That has to tell us something. We are all too romantic about Mars!</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet as long as the moment of truth, the time for a reality check is yet far off, we can afford to indulge our Martian illusions. And perhaps that is good in the long run. For it carries forth the dream, and with it the ongoing brainstorming exercises that will one day overcome the daunting odds.</P><font size=2><a href="index.html" target="_top">Back to MMM #93</a></font>&nbsp;&lt;-&nbsp;<a href="mmm-mars-platform.html">-&gt;</a></BODY></HTML>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Moon Miners' Manifesto Issue #93</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><!-- /093/redhousing.html --><H2 align=center>Redhousing</H2><P ALIGN=CENTER>Breeding "Mars Hardy" plants in Compressed Mars Air</P><P><HR WIDTH=80%></P><FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:kokhmmm@execpc.com">Peter Kokh</a></FONT><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the previous "Mars Theme" issue, MMM # 83 MAR '95, on pp. 7-8 "Searching for OLD LIFE on Mars" (P. Kokh), we broke the topic down into two separate questions:</P><ul type=square><lI>Question 1: What kinds of life forms may have had time to evolve on Mars before irreversible climactic decay, and could any fossil traces still endure?<li>Question 2: Could some anemic relic of a once far richer Martian Biosphere still subsist in "oases" here and there?</ul><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We concluded with a discussion of the implications for Martian settlement dreams, pointing out that the Romanti-cists who hope against hope that we will find some primitive (at least!) life forms still extant life on Mars, had better hope that they are wrong. It is incomprehensibly naive to think that should we find life on Mars of any sort, that the political / rabbleocracy powers-that-be would allow humans (us!) to settle there. The Fourth Planet would forthwith be declared a quaran-tined biological preserve for the rest of time. "Humans and all Earth Life keep out!" We could hardly disagree more with the sentiments expressed by editor Jeff Liss in the recent issue of Inside NSS. He had called "disappointing" the recent finding that the Viking "No-Life-On-Mars" experiment results were not flawed after all.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If all we find are fossil relics and perhaps a few incomplete strands of DNA (we should rejoice at finding that much!) Jurassic Park type reconstructions of native life form populations are most unlikely.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If an eco-system does survive, we could not hope to see any significant further evolution (beyond anecdotal differen-tational radiation of surviving species into new niches in a restored or rejuvenated more benign climate) within the lifetime of humanity, even if it be a million years - and not even if we succeeded in restoring, permanently, the former more life-accommodating climate with a stabilized all-Martian biosphere and biota. Romantic ideas to the contrary should not be entertained. We would be left with only pre-metazoan life, one-celled plants and animals - nothing we could see with the naked eye!   So rather rejoice that Mars is empty of life!</P><font size=+1 color="#AA1515"><CENTER>It is not precise to say that Mars is "barren", only that it is "virginal"</center></font><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not the end of the story. That Mars has no life, and quite possibly never spawned life even in earlier wetter and warmer times does not make the planet "barren". It only makes the planet "virginal". That conditions may have never been special to allow life to rise on its own, does not mean that life, originated elsewhere, and then bioengineered to fit Martian conditions, could not be successfully transplanted to Martian soil, with intelligent guidance, corrections, and compensations. That is a tall challenge, however, but we hope to sketch how it might be accomplished. Or at least, the first steps one intending to green the planet might take.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The biological side of Greening Mars would have to be brought about "pari passu" i.e. step by step together with the geological rejuvenescence of the planet. Rather than "terraforming" Mars by making it a copy of Earth, rejuvenais-sance looks not at Earth, but the early Mars itself, for its standard of achievement. The planet does need to be warmed, first to the point where a third of the atmosphere no longer freezes out over the poles each winter (twice a Martian year, during northern and southern winters, i.e. paradoxically during southern and northern summers, i.e. atmospheric pressure is at its height only during spring alias fall). Warming it still further will free up additional carbon dioxide bound up at the poles or in permafrost year around. Both temperature and pressure have to be increased to the point that liquid water can exist in the open, even if only as seasonal dews.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But in this article, we want to look at the biological part of the equation. Obviously we want to, have to, use genetic material from sundry terrestrial plants (possibly animals too) and arrive at species hardy enough to survive and breed on a rejuvenated Mars.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have to start with is, species after species, a long ways from being remotely Mars-hardy. The harshest most demanding habitats on Earth are all much friendlier than the friendliest place on Mars, even possibly on the wetter, warmer Mars of yestereon. Where do we start? How do we proceed?</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The most severe habitats on Earth are the deserts, the Andean altiplano of Peru and Bolivia, the tundra of northern Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Scandinavia, and Russia-Siberia, and the Antarctic islands, shores, and "dry valleys." No trees grow in these areas, not even the stunted, wind-grotesqued caricatures we find at the tree line on mountain slopes and at the tundra limits. Animals fare better, thriving on seafood, other animals and very lowly plants.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Animals, however, need an oxygen-rich atmosphere, which we don't have, have never had, on Mars. Plants, in contrast, thrive on carbon dioxide - it has been shown that most plants can be grown successfully in an artificial atmosphere of reduced pressure (e.g. 1/10th normal) of just carbon dioxide, the major component of Mars air. That is to say, that plants and crops can be grown on Mars in greenhouses pressurized with warmed Martian atmosphere, simply compressed tenfold - nothing else added, besides water, of course. That we could gradually lower temperature and pressure to meet the improving Mars climate halfway with bioengineered species that could be planted outdoors either to be tended and cultivated or left to grow wild is the general idea.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We call this redhousing, rather than greenhousing. We are using the air of the red planet Mars and an improved but still Martian climate - not the air of Earth and an idealized terrestrial climate. This is not to say we shouldn't have traditional greenhouses on Mars. We do have to eat and clothe ourselves and provide for pharmaceuticals and other needs, day in and day out - while we are busy in the redhouses preparing to mate a rejuvenated red planet with a blanket of life bred and engineered to go native there.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will there someday be forests on Mars, with real trees even if they look unearthly. That's a possibility beyond our vision. Our starting point will likely be the lichen, a moss-like plant that is basically a fungus able to survive thanks to a symbiotic relationship with green algae. That this feat is cooperative is discouraging, that we have to start with a very specialized complex - compound creature. The best place to start in any plan to evolve a radiant family of diverse species is with something very generalized, able to survive in a wide range of habitats. But thankfully, we have many species of lichens in the northern hemisphere and a few in the southern.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But are lichens the only starting point? Not necessarily. Many plants handle annual freezing in stride, but the much longer, much deeper freezes of Mars would likely be to much for them. Witness the tree line!</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some antarctic organisms in the animal kingdom, come equipped with an intra-cellular antifreeze - glycol. But plant cells have protoplasm as well. If the gene responsible for the ability to produce glycol can be transferred successfully to some plants, that might give us additional breeding stock for Mars. The more starting points, the more diverse the ultimate possibilities, the more niches on Mars that can be greened.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But hard long freezes are not the only challenges Mars poses. Severe desication is another. Desert plants, like cacti and other "succulents" withstand prolonged very arid stretches well. On Mars the dessicating capacity of the cold parched winds is extremely intense. What the cacti and other desert plants have to offer, will not be enough. But it is a start. Nor is there any reason why the glycol gene cannot be added to the genetic consist of desication-hardy plants, and vice versa. Chile's Atacama, California's Death Valley, NW China's Takla Maklan are among the most challenging niches for desert life. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;And then there is the untempered ultraviolet of the more distant, cooler, Martian "Sun". Mars tenuous atmosphere without free oxygen (O<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>) or ozone (O<FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT>) is transparent to this tissue-killing radiation. Here on Earth, the most UV-resistant species are those that live at very high altitudes. The nearer to the equator, the higher up the maintain slopes does life thrive. Plants growing wild in various niches of the Peruvian-Bolivian altiplano (high altitude 13,000-15,000 ft. intermountain basin-plateau between the Western and Eastern Cordillera) may yield genetic contributors to this resistance. - a third ingredient.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We must add one more characteristic. On Earth many plants are pollinated by insects and birds. Bioengineering animals to breath a carbon dioxide atmosphere seems science-fantastic, not merely science-fictional. So we may want to end up with plants that are wind-pollinated or use some other assist than the help of sweet air breathing animal species. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The list of favorable attributes doesn't end here. We could select also for abrasion resistance to wind-borne dust, low reproductive rates, interruptable life cycles, etc.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;What plant forms will be most receptive to such diverse genetic additions? Your guess is as good as mine. It is not impossible that the best Mars-hardy hybrids will have as ancestors plants that boast none of the assets mentioned, but  will have proven  receptive to all of them.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor do we have to wait until we are on Mars to begin the experimenting. There are so many candidate plants to start with, so many recombinant genetic combinations to be tried. The sooner we begin, and the more the facilities we set up, the sooner are we likely to have our optimism and enthusiasm rewarded - or discouraged.</P><table cellpadding=3><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mars, as we pointed out, all we will need is a shelter that holds compressed, warmed Martian air.</td><td><img src="/images/asi199600052.gif" alt="Diagram of Mars Greenhouse" height=83 width=243></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;On Earth it will be a little trickier. Unbuffered, the facility would be subject to inexorable leaks from the higher pressure, vastly more oxygen-sweet air of the host planet:</td><td><img src="/images/asi199600047.gif" alt="Diagram of Earth Redhouse 1" height=83 width=243></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;One way we can buffer the facility and prevent hasty degradation of the special atmosphere within, is to use a surround chamber with either Earth air or Mars air at relatively low pressure. Air would tend to leak out of the red house chamber, preserving quality, with makeup quantities from special tanks. If pressure in the surround got to high (too close in value to that of the inner chamber) the excess could be pump- exhausted to the outside terrestrial atmosphere.</td><td><img src="/images/asi199600048.gif" alt="Diagram of Earth Redhouse 2" height=83 width=243></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the redhouse could be covered and buffered by water in a host lake or pool or tank. This would also tend to prevent atmospheric contamination. A wet porch could not be used for entry, however, as oxygen dissolved in the water would outgas into the carbon dioxide atmosphere within, polluting it.</td><td><img src="/images/asi199600048.gif" alt="Diagram of Earth Redhouse 3" height=83 width=243></td></tr></table><H4 align=center>An Art of the Possible</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The strategy is one of convergence, breeding ever more cold, drought, and UV hardy species for ever more Mars-like conditions in Mars redhouses Meanwhile, outside the actual Mars climate is improved by human activity and inter-vention. In fact, the degree to which these experiments are successful, will co-determine the goals set for rejuvenescence of the planet. Like politics, the greening of Mars will unfold as the art of the possible. As politics should be (but isn't) it will also be the art of co-promise, not compromise - what can be achieved in improving the climate, temperature, pressure, and wetness of the planet - and what can be achieved by recom-binant DNA biological engineering and breeding for Mars-hardiness. We can only speculate at the results.</P><H4 align=center>The Role of Intervention</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;On Earth, and most likely on all life-bearing planets, evolution has not been smoothed. Each outburst of new species origination slows into a self-stabilizing rut, impeding further progress. It is the periodic decimation of existing species by comet and asteroid impacts that has cleared the way for new evolutionary growth. The future of redhousing will include man-made catastrophes to severely purge prematurely stabilizing indoor ecosystems and clear the way for new rounds of the game of survival of the most (man-determined) fittest.</P><H4 align=center>Redhousing and the Plan for Mars</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;As progress allows us to preview the eventual results, we will know better what areas of Mars to set aside as future areozoic parks and preserves. Low-elevation basins and canyons will have the highest atmospheric pressure, the warmest temperatures (latitude for latitude) and be the first to experience dews and eventually free standing and/or flowing  open water. The Mars Orbital Laser Altimeter aboard the Mars Global Surveyor (November '96 launch, September '97 arrival) will give us a good idea of where these oases-to-be are located. We will then even be able to speculate about setting aside right-of-ways for future parkways.</P><H4 align=center>Redhousing in the Grand Design of Things</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;To return to the point we made at the outset, if Mars is devoid of life, that makes is a virgin world, not a barren one. The cosmic vocation of humanity, unsuspected by all the world's pretentious scriptural traditions, may indeed be to bring life to places where it can survive, but never originate on its own. Only an intelligent species can serve this function. Humanity then becomes "the" reproductive organ of Gaia (meant as the name of Earth-Life in aggregate, not as some mythic meta-individual).</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, through interstellar flight, even if it only be of ships bearing nothing more than seeds, spores, and fertilized eggs, this particular human vocation takes on a more general Cosmic significance, in the Solar neighborhood (probe-reachable limits to be determined!) beyond this nursery womb-world nano-turf we call Earth.</P><font size=2><a href="index.html" target="_top">Back to MMM #93</a></font>&nbsp;<a href="mmm-mars-platform.html">&lt;-</a>&nbsp;<a href="shifting-climate.html">-&gt;</a></BODY></HTML>

("back of envelope") calculations of the material and energy inputs and relocations needed to bring about such changes.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the goal is "terraforming" (making the planet another "Earth") or "Lowellification" (making the planet at least as friendly as we thought it was fifty years ago), or "rejuvenescence" ("restoring" Mars to its wettest and warmest former state of about three billion years ago), the equations are hard to work without good data about the present.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In point of fact, despite all the revelations of the Mariner and Viking missions, we know much less about the Mars of today, than most writers will admit.</P><ol><li><P>We don't know within two or even three orders of magnitude how much water remains on Mars, locked up in the polar caps, in subterranean aquifers and lakes, or chemically bound up in hydrates, or frozen in the interstices of soil particles as permafrost.

By comparison, a mere 2&#176; rise in terrestrial temperatures worldwide, would cause environmentalists and meteorologists and climatologists to reach for the panic button.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment,we have no idea how long-lasting this cooling will be, nor even if the downward swing has bottomed out, nor on what time frame such meta-seasonal changes take place. Given that, brainstorming pathways to a friendly future are interesting fantasies and no more. As they say, "garbage in, garbage out." Yet carefully designed future missions could tackle each of these points of our ignorance quite well.</P><font size=2><a href="index.html" target="_top">Back to MMM #93</a></font>&nbsp;<a href="redhousing.html">&lt;-</a>&nbsp;<a href="mars-lavatubes.html">-&gt;</a></BODY></HTML>

Mineralogical assets will also count, of course. And happily, the Tharsis region impinges on the head of the great Valles Marineris canyonland complex where many strata of rock will lay revealed for prospecting ease. Pavonis Mons, a great shield volcano already cited as possibly the most strategic mountain massif in the entire Solar System, its western flank the ideal site for a launch track complex, neighbors this canyonland head region on its eastern flank.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But all this is little more than reasoned speculation. We do know what kind of terrain sports lavatubes on Earth and we do see analogous terrain on Mars. But that's it. On the Moon we have the added advantage of seeing actual examples of partially and wholly collapsed lavatubes (e.g. Hyginus and Hadley Rilles, respectively). Surveying such features on the ground will take generations. If we can search for them with orbiting instruments, our pre-settlement "treasure" maps of Mars will be enormously more helpful and propitious.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;While many, if not most tubes may lie within lava sheet layers that have been subsequently buried by later flows and thus be well below the surface, those in the uppermost flows should lie near enough to the surface to be detectable by appropriately tuned radar.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Given our experience with the quixotic results of some of the Viking lander experiments, it only makes sense to fly such instruments first in low Earth orbit. We can then compare the findings with known "ground truth" and check the verisimilitude of the readings and better correct the calibration. Finding unsuspected tubes in various regions on Earth may be reward enough to merit such a precursor mission.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This being done, a second such orbiter mission could do its tricks in orbit above the Moon, adding enormously to the practical knowledge necessary for intelligent planning of lunar development scenarios. The third tubefinder mission would head for Mars polar orbit. Lessons learned at Earth and at the Moon would allow mission planners to fly the leanest and lightest and least expensive probe to Mars capable of doing the job usefully well.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Would permafrost deposits interfere with the readings and conclusions. Not likely, as the radar wavelengths for the former are LONGER - SHORTER by a factor of X. However the radar instrumentation needed for the two global searches would seem to make made-in-heaven bus mates - a "tundra and tube" mapper. If we did find permafrost and tubes in the same region, and we may not, that would mark the location as especially attractive for settlement development.</P><img align=right src="/images/asi199600050.gif" width=247 height=141 alt="Diagram of Lavatube with Habitat Benefits Noted"><H4>Lavatubes and their Uses:</H4><P>On Earth, these features are typically a few tens of meters wide and high and hundreds to a few thousands of meters long. On the much less gravid Moon, and with the scale of Hadley Rille as evidence, we expect to find lavatubes hundreds of meters wide, and many tens of kilometers long. On Mars, with its in between 3/8ths normal gravity, we might expect such features to be in between in size, say 50- 100 meters wide and a few kilometers long. On both the Moon and Mars, "tubing" will be a major outdoor hobby, akin to limestone cave spelunking on Earth.</P><font size=2><a href="index.html" target="_top">Back to MMM #93</a></font>&nbsp;<a href="mars-lavatubes.html">&lt;-</a>&nbsp;<a href="permafrost.html">-&gt;</a></BODY></HTML>

Also called pergelisol.</P><H4>Where do we find permafrost (on Earth)?</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We find permafrost mostly in circum arctic lands of Alaska, Canada (Northwest Territories, northern Quebec, northern Labrador), Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia (Norway, especially), and Russia-Siberia. Permafrost is the soil condition that manifests itself in "tundra" type no-root or shallow-root vegetation.</P><H4>How does permafrost form?</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Permafrost forms in ground water areas through gradual transition to ever more severe winters and ever shorter and cooler summers. The deeper the ground water penetrates, and the greater the water content per volume of soil, the thicker and richer the permafrost layer.</P><H4>Why do we think there may be extensive permafrost deposits on Mars?</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is abundant evidence from high resolution Viking photos of landforms for which the  only plausible explanation is that they were formed by water: tear drop shaped islands in the middle of large valleys, relic beaches and ancient shorelines, wave-sculpted dry lake and sea shore bottoms, deltas and estuaries, flood-carved channels. From such evidence, it has become clear that Mars even sported a respectable northern hemisphere ocean that once covered more than a third of the planet to respectable depths. Not all of this water could have evaporated or sublimated into space. Archaic water-saturated lake and sea bottoms should have retained their water content as the climate got colder and the ground froze to deeper and deeper levels.</P><H4>Where on Mars is permafrost most likely to be found?</H4><P><img src="/images/asi199600053.gif" align=right width=191 height=177 alt="Globe of Mars Showing Permafrost Deposits">&nbsp;&nbsp;The likeliest areas of significant permafrost deposits are the ancient northern ocean bottomlands, deep major impact basin bottoms like Hellas and Argyre, and canyon bottoms (especially the outflow areas like the Ares Valley landing site for the Mars Pathfinder lander. Unfortunately, this lander is not providentially equipped to test for permafrost underfoot. It is typical that the kind of knowledge most needed to assess settlement feasibilities is low on the priority list of planetary scientists interested primarily in scratching the itches of their own narrow scientific curiosities. Both Vikings likewise landed in areas in which we might expect to find substantial permafrost deposits, a condition that went untested.)</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Permafrost could have formed in adjacent areas not covered by standing water through the lateral spread of ground water, and in still other areas if subject to seasonal rainfall.</P><H4>What, if any, would be the significance of permafrost on Mars for future settlement / development?</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>On Earth</B>, (a) permafrost renders the land agriculturally unproductive, although tundra lichens and other vegetation is sufficient to maintain a large wildlife population of caribou, rabbits, and other hardy arctic fauna. (b) Buildings must be set on bedrock or thermally isolated from the ground, commonly by use of stilts made of materials with low heat conductivity, along with effective use of insulation to prevent heat radiating from the bottom of the building to the frozen soil below. The stilts should raise the underside of the building high enough above the ground to allow free air and wind circulation. (c) Road building creates special problems, witness the special measures that had to be taken during the construction of the Alaska Pipeline.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>On Mars</B>, seasonal thaws may not be a problem at first, but may become less and less rare as human activities, planned and unplanned, lead to a significant warming of the Martian climate. (a) For this reason, outposts in permafrost areas will be especially challenging to build and maintain. Settlement may be limited to areas of patchy permafrost, with construction held to frigid but not ice-saturated soil and rock areas. (b) Only those areas where the 'topsoil' is 'active', i.e. thawing seasonally, will be colonizaible by bioengineered Mars-hardy plant varieties developed through an aggressive redhousing program.</P><table><tr><td>Mars outpost on stilts- insulated</td><td><img src="/images/asi199600054.gif" width=250 height=144 alt="Image of Raised Outpost"></td></tr><tr><td>Mars subsurface outpost - insulated</td><td><img src="/images/asi199600055.gif" width=245 height=189 alt="Image of Buried Outpost"></td></tr><tr><td>Mars subsurface outpost in "patchy" area</td><td><img src="/images/asi199600056.gif" width=247 height=114 alt="Image of Underground Outpost"></td></tr></table><H4>How can we tap permafrost water assets?</H4><OL><P><LI>We could strip mine the permafrost layers and then run them through melting ovens on conveyors, redepositing the dried soil back in place, all in one operation. This could be more mechanically difficult than it sounds, with lots of equipment breakdowns, given the hardness of the soil/ice aggregate.</P><P><LI>We could heat the deposits in situ (in place) and then pumping out the freed and liquefied water if excess waste heat at a high enough temperature is available. This requires drilling holes for heat conducting rods or super-heated steam pipes. Such waste heat would be available if the outpost had a small nuclear plant both for heat, power and for extraction of various atmospheric gasses.<P><li>We can cover the frozen ground with an "infrared-black" plastic tarp and apply concentrated solar heating.</P></ol><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whichever method we use to extract the ice-melt, it may be necessary, if the water proves to be saline, to distill the melt to purify it of salts (and possibly heavy metals). A few "ground truth" cores taken by rover drilling probes would soon establish just how fresh or how brackish the permafrost ice is, and whether it varies in quality from place to place.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Excess water produced by an outpost's local permafrost tap may then be trucked, or air-lifted, or eventually pipelined to other less advantaged settlements and outposts. Thus, water could well be the first real intra-Mars trade commodity. (A futures market, anyone?)</P><H4>What alternative sources of water are there?</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Other most options for providing water needed for drinking and hygiene, agriculture and life support, processing and manufacturing do exist:</P><OL><P><LI>Nuclear powered atmospheric hydro-extraction plants are certainly feasible. In 10,000 tons of Mars air, there are 3 tons of water vapor, i.e. 0.03%, along with 7 tons of oxygen and 270 tons of nitrogen, both of which would also be extracted as byproducts. Each outpost or settlement is likely to have such a plant anyway, to produce carbon monoxide and methane fuels as well as fresh oxygen and nitrogen. The question is, will such a plant produce enough water in the process to meet demands, or will this "air-water" need to be supplemented?</P><P><LI>A much bolder and higher cost option would be to mine ice from the edge of the north polar cap (the southern cap may be mostly carbon dioxide frost). Melted, this glacial melt could then be trucked (requiring roads or ground effect vehicles) or (especially later as population on Mars and demand grows) a network of aqueducts would follow the paths imagined by Schiaparelli and Lowell from the north polar cap southwards.</P></oL><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;One or both of these options can serve "ice-dry" areas of Mars.</P><H4>Putting together a Mars Permafrost Map - Now</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because extensive permafrost zones are found here on Earth (some continuous, some discontinuous, some patchy), we have an ideal opportunity to fly the needed radar instrument package in polar Earth orbit to both test how well it can detect permafrost and to properly calibrate the instruments by checking their readings with actual data on the ground, so we will have greater confidence in interpreting the readings we get in flying an identical instrument package around Mars. We need to determine how well depth of the layer below the surface, ice content percentage, and thickness of the deposits are indicated in the readings, and whether differences in salinity or other factors affect the data points we get.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If flown alone (not with lavatube radar) as co-op U.S.-Russian mission, Bering (Russian-born explorer of Alaska, Vitus Bering) might be a good name for the probe. Mars Permafrost Mapper would be an alternate choice.</P><font size=2><a href="index.html" target="_top">Back to MMM #93</a></font>&nbsp;<a href="mars-lavatubes.html">&lt;-</a>&nbsp;<a href="pres-letter.html">-&gt;</a></BODY></HTML>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We're finally getting the Technical Committees organized!
This month we collected all the information on who has volunteered for
which committee, and set up a structure for managing the work.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Space Flight Technical Council is the core of this
organization, responsible for both the technical committees and the project
teams. NOTE: Where we haven't formally established agreements with the
supporting organizations, we're still listing Greg Bennett as acting in
those roles.[*]</P>

<H4>Technical Council Administrator</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:cddicks@aol.com">Candace Dicks</a>, the
Technical Council Administrator, maintains the records of each committee's
membership, charter, and any other adminsitrative information the OSF
needs.  She also maintains this information on Artemis Society
International's world wide web site.  Soon you'll be able to look up each
technical committee and project team on the web.  The main index is at <a
target="_top" href="/adb/06/07/">http://www.asi.org/adb/06/07/</a>.</P>

<H4>Configuration Management Data Base Administrator: </H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Doug Cross is Administrator for the Configuration Management
Data Base, and leader of the configuration management team.  We're still
working out the best tools to define and maintain the reference
configuration. When you come up with a configuration option that changes
the weight, cost, or whatever for a part of the spacecraft, Doug will
update the data base.</P>

<P>&nbsp;We're (literally) a <a href="/adb/07/local-chapters.html"
target="_top">world-wide</a> organization, so we can generate a lot of
chaos.  To keep the chaos under control, we'll establish a system where the
reference configuration gets updated when the update is approved by the
project team leader who is reponsible for that part of the spacecraft.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each member of the Technical Council is reponsible for
managing the work of the organizations within each discipline.  The
following tables list which committees and project teams report to each
member of the Technical Council.</P>

It's not unusual for actors to get into the movie production side of the business, but what is unusual is the name of Hanks' company:  Clavius Base.  Asked to explain, Hanks was quoted in Daily Variety:  "It's from 2001: A Space Odyssey.  When that came out in 1968, I couldn't sleep the night before.  It was the first time I was moved in a different way by a movie. The character in the movie was going to Clavus Base in a moon bus.  It's also the name of the biggest crater on the Moon.

Here's our "generic" answer:</P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>What Oregon Moonbase isn't -- and is</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether there's anything to see at our experimental site depends on what you're looking for. There are no improvements at the site (other than fences), no facilities or experiments currently in place. (No restrooms, no water ...)</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;What we do have is a set of lava tube caves, basalt terrain, and sand mixed with volcanic dust, a useful analog to dusty lunar regolith. Our site can be made available for experimenters wishing to bring their own equipment into a primitive site and test it.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past we have brought in Young Astronauts and adults and equipment, built a small operational base, and conducted Moon Base exercises. After each trip we dismantled the equipment and returned it to its sponsoring institution, the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI). A Rockwell engineer also tested a prototype "lunar cart" at the site, and we performed under NASA contract to characterize the site and plan a full-service experimental facility there.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We prefer some other season than midwinter to visit our site, because it is east of the Cascade mountains in Oregon's high desert (3700' elevation) country. Although the site is usually (not always) clear, the roads to the site from our homes in the Willamette Valley cross high mountain passes that are frequently and often unpredictably covered with snow and ice. Visits are more conveniently scheduled between mid-April to mid-October, although we will be happy to try anytime anyone is interested and available.</P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>IF you are interested in visiting lava tube caves</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are caves on public lands open year-round if you can get there. Ape Cave on the southern slopes of Mt. St. Helens is open even if its little visitor's office is closed, and other caves exist west of Trout Lake (town) in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in southern Washington. In Oregon, Lava River Cave is open right next to highway U.S. 97 south of Bend, for a small fee, and lanterns are available there for rent. This is a large cave easily accessible just a few hundred yards off a main thoroughfare.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Other large caves are scattered on the north and south slopes of Newberry Mountain south of Bend, marked on USGS and Forest Service maps (Deschutes National Forest; Newberry Volcanic Monument). Note that Newberry is a large shield volcano similar to those seen on Mars (but not as big as they are!). All of  the Bend-area caves are in lavas associated with Newberry (the City of Bend is built on Newberry lavas).</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Another shield volcano is Medicine Lake volcano east of Mt. Shasta in northern California. A world-class collection of dramatic lava tube caves exists on the far northern flank of Medicine Lake, set aside as Lava Beds National Monument. It is probably the best place to study lava tube caves in the continental U.S. The nearest significant town is Klamath Falls in southern Oregon. We highly recommend Lava Beds for lava tube studies. Winter is not the best time to visit this area.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a volcanic field with some lava tubes in New Mexico's El Malpais / Bandera Volcano wilderness, west of Albuquerque. These are not quite as large as the northwest caves, and tend to be more eroded, rockfall choked, and are possibly older.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We also recommend Hawaii for lava tube caves. They are still being made there today. Best place is the Big Island (Hawaii), but caves also exist on Oahu, Kauai, and probably the other islands as well. We've heard about large lava tube caves in Korea, Australia, and the Canary Islands.</P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Getting in touch</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're interested in meeting and talking to our Lunar Base Research Team, we have an office space available in Portland and are always glad to get together to talk about our research and other space issues. Since we have other, paying jobs, it would be easiest to meet on a weekend.</P><P>Let us know if you want to get together sometime.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>Bryce Walden, Chair, Oregon L5 Research Team<br>Oregon L5 Society<br>P.O.

Schultz</FONT><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently read a very interesting book, which I believe is very helpful in explaining the decline of zeal for space exploration and colonization.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><tt><B>The Sixties Spiritual Awakening: </B>American Religion Moving From Modern to Postmodern, by Robert S. Ellwood, 1994 Rutgers University Press</tt></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellwood is a sociology of religion scholar, and his book contains one of the best discussions I have ever seen of the multifarious impact which the Sixties have had on our society. The result of this impact is the now predominating post-modernist spirit - a spirit which differs radically from the modernism which preceded it.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Ellwood's discussion of what this post-modernism means for America's space activities is quite brief, it gets to the heart of the matter. Here is what he says concerning the first manned lunar landing:</P><BLOCKQUOTE>"In the 1990s as one watches videos of the epochal event, one vicariously participates in an adventure inherently gripping yet oddly dated in mentality and means, like a tale from Homer. Despite the 1969 talk of the heroic venture of Michael Collins, Neil Armstrong, and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin as only the first step in a great human exploration of the universe, one feels intuitively [that] it was rather the last great moment in an era now closed. ... The Apollo-Saturn missions were isolated adventures, like Odysseus's, not new Columbian voyages. ... the Moon landing was a supreme and last expression of the American modernist spirit, ... invincibly confident in its technological skill and its righteous use thereof, believing in progress forever." (pp. 305, 306)</BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the spirit which generated the American space program and carried it into its glory days, culminating in the Apollo lunar missions, is no longer the ruling and guiding spirit in America, according to Ellwood. That spirit - the "modernist" spirit - has now been supplanted by the "post-modernist" spirit, which is antipathetical to the optimism, heroism, dynamism, and objectivism of the modernist era.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If Ellwood's analysis is correct, and I believe it is, then it explains why space activists are having to fight an "uphill" battle. The real obstacle we face is not a lack of funds or technology, but the postmodernist spirit, which does not share our vision. The reason we have to fight to "take back the dream" and "recover the vision" of Apollo is that the postmodernist spirit has repudiated the vision and dream of space. This cynical postmodernism scoffs at the conquest of space as a grandiose notion. The postmodernist hegemony began in the early 1970s. This is why, instead of becoming the springboard to the colonization of space, the lunar landing became instead "the last great moment in an era now closed". That in a nutshell is Ellwood's diagnosis of the contemporary malaise.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that Ellwood's interpretation is correct, as far as it goes. But I think that it needs to be supplemented with an accurate understanding of the modernist spirit, without which, one may be misled into the common misconception of supposing that the nature of modernism was totally at odds with the preceding medieval era. This is far from true. The modernist era incorporated (via secularization) many ideas from the medieval mind. One of the most important of these earlier ideas is what David A. Dunlop calls "The Value of the Grand Vision and the Long Trajectory" in his essay "An Appropriate Environment for Man" on pages 9-11 of the October '95 issue of Moon Miners' Manifesto (issue # 89).</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example of this Grand Vision/Long Trajectory idea, Dunlop refers to the construction of the great European cathedrals, and then contrasts this with "The Tyranny of the Short Term Standard", which is the currently accepted outlook:</P><BLOCKQUOTE>"We seem to have lost culturally the capacity that existed during the middle ages which concerned itself with 'meeting the requirements of God' even if it took generations to fulfill such requirements. The constructions of the great cathedrals of Europe were the work of centuries spanning many generations. <I>No such clear sense of over arching necessity of purpose exists today for any national or international project </I>...We don't aspire to visions of new worlds. The output of enormous effort in the here and now that will not see completion in one's lifetime is a very alien and even humorous idea in an era which is increasingly conditioned to short term expectations of accomplishment and maximized individual consumption." (p. 10, emphasis his)</BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dunlop then cites two examples of the "Grand Vision / Long Trajectory" from the modernist era in America, namely the purchases of the Louisiana Territory and of Alaska.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>"When the opportunity arose for the purchase of the Louisiana Territory from the French, the amount represented a substantial portion of the entire budget of the United States in 1805. Yet Jefferson, looking ahead over the course of a century or two, realized that the purchase price was an infinitesimal portion of the true value of what was being offered. Against opposition, he persuaded Congress to take the plunge. On a smaller scale, 'Seward's folly' of purchasing Alaska for 67 million dollars in the mid 1860s was another such uncommon example of the long term view prevailing. The economic wisdom of Jefferson and Seward is now clearly apparent after well over a century has passed, but the territorial gain and economic gain of other planets, the Moon, and Mars has eluded every President and Congress since Nixon!" (p. 10, emphasis his).</BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I firmly believe, as I have stated in previous articles, and as most other space activists believe, that we must strive to radically reduce the <a href="/adb/02/07/01/02/">costs of getting to</a> and living in space. But this is not enough. It is even more important that we fight against the prevailing cynical myopic post-modernist spirit, and seek to restore the greatness which Western Culture had during its  medieval and modernist eras, when the then predominant Grand Vision & Long Trajectory idea inspired men to dream great dreams and accomplish great works. Let's face it: even with Cheap Access to Space (CATS) and Cheap Utilization of the Resources of Space (CURS) [Ed. an unfortunate acronym!], it is still going to take an enormous amount of money, materials, and manpower to create a spacefaring civilization. People will not be inclined to make this kind of investment in the future until they have been liberated from the postmodernist slough of despondency and set free to once again dream the great dream of fulfilling the next great step in the Dominion Mandate - building the "cathedrals" of the next millennium: human settlements in space.</P><P><FONT SIZE=2>Forrest W.

With the encouragement of NSS VP Glenn Wilson and the Executive Committee and financial pledges from numerous Governors, the Governors proceeded to arrange for a re-study of the data [Inside NSS, Dec. 94/Jan 95] Downs' report to the Governors follows:</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have further information on the matter of the Viking tests for Martian life. You may recall that the negative findings obtained with the instrument known as the GCMS were brought into question by seemingly contradictory results obtained some years ago by John Lavoie as a part of his PhD dissertation at MIT. As you recall, the GCMS [Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer] was deposited  on the Martian surface and tested the Martian soil for molecules of biological origin. It found none within its threshold of detection, implying no Martian life.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lavoie, however, tested a sample of Antarctic soil with a laboratory replica of the GCMS and reported that while the Viking instrument gave a negative result - i.e., no biological molecules in the sample - another lab test [Labeled Release experiment], for organic carbon, showed a relatively large amount of organic carbon. Organic carbon usually means carbon of biological origin.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, taken at face value, the implication in Lavoie's results was that the GCMS was relatively insensitive to biological molecules. Therefore, there could be such molecules, and life, on Mars after all.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Before proceeding further to resolve this apparent contradiction, it seemed prudent to test the reproducibility of Lavoie's results. On recommendation of Dr. Sam Epstein, eminent Cal Tech biochemist, Dr. Jastrow consulted Professor John Cronin of Arizona State University, who specialized in testing for organic matter in meteorites. Dr. Jastrow asked for his help in re-doing Lavoie's experiments on the same sample of Antarctic soil Lavoie had used (kept in a freezer at NASA's Ames Center all these years), to see if he would get the same results as Lavoie.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Cronin has now reported to us that he has found that this Antarctic soil sample does contain carbon, as Lavoie reported, but it appears to be carbon in the form of coal dust rather than carbon in the form of biological molecules (there are large coal deposits in the Antarctic).</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This result would appear to eliminate the contradiction between Lavoie's finding of carbon in that Antarctic soil sample and the GCMS result that there were no detec-table biological molecules in this sample.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Cronin is tidying up his experiments with a view to publishing a research note. However, in view of his findings, it appears at this time that thee is no reason to pursue that line or revisionist inquiry further. In the view of Dr. Jastrow and others - which I share - the question of Martian life is still open and will only be settled when we can take subsurface samples in a variety of Martian environments. But we will have to wait for a Mars landing before we obtain a definitive answer by that route.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to bringing you up to date, in the meantime, I want to thank those who contributed to the new research that has brought these results. While they don't, of course, offer proof that no life exists on Mars, they do indicate closure for the investigation we helped fund.</P><P>With best wishes,<BR>Hugh Downs<BR>Chairman, NSS Board of Governors</P><P><HR><P><P>[Letter]</P><H3>Mars: Labeled Release Experiment; raising the temperature of Mars; a billion years of aridity; life's responses to stress.</H3><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The romantic spirit lives! For only a romantic fool looks at the Viking Labeled Release data set and discerns in that mess a "clear and positive indication" of some earthly phenomenon. One lander pushed aside a stone to get a sample from underneath it.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The residual polar cap radiates thermal infrared at 160&#176;K [-113&#176;C, -171&#176;F]. To sublime it, [the frozen carbon dioxide component, anyway] we must raise its temperature to 213&#176;k [-60&#176;C, -76&#176;F]. Adding 1012 metric tons of CFCs to Mars' atmos-phere raises the global mean temperature almost exactly 53&#176; [K or C, 95&#176; F]. Now, where do we get a trillion tons of CFCs? And how do we transport them to Mars?</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Life copes well with  extremes of temperature, pressure, pH [acidity - alkalinity], and radiation, but not with extreme dryness. A billion arid years without rain or running water will kill anything.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;On Earth, recognizable paleomicrofossils appear in shales, cherts, and limestones, tough rocks that resist weathering yet preserve the evidence. Outcrops of these rock types on Mars would be of great interest to explorers. We need a geochemical map of the planet.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Lynn Margulis, microbial sex fiend and co-creator of the Gaia religion, has presented evidence that cells created viruses, viroids, prions, and the like, as packets to salvage genetic information under environmental stress: i.e. when the water wasn't boiling, where deadly free oxygen was present, or where unfiltered UV poured down from the skies.</P><P>-- Jeff Sanburg, Skokie, Illinois</P><font size=2><a href="index.html" target="_top">Back to MMM #93</a></font>&nbsp;<a href="book-review.html">&lt;-</a>&nbsp;<a href="isdc-ideas.html">-&gt;</a></BODY></HTML>

Two fuel combinations are possible:  "Carmonox" engines will burn carbon monoxide (2 CO +O<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>); "Methanox" or "Oochie" engines will burn methane (O<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT> + CH<FONT SIZE=1>4</FONT>). Methane is the more powerful fuel and will be the fuel of choice if reasonably salt-free water can easily be produced from permafrost taps.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The GOAL of this tech demo is not a vehicle chassis suitable for Martian terrain, but an engine that can be used in any such vehicle: car, truck, coach, caterpillar, etc.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;START: There are now any number of experimental methane burning vehicles already on the road. REPLACE the carburetor with bottled oxygen and combine with the methane in an INTERNAL COMBUSTION cycle, not a rocket motor.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;AND DEBUG. DEMO at ISDC '98 Milwaukee.</P><H4>A Mars Airplane</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The density of Martian air at average surface levels is equivalent to the atmospheric pressure on Earth at 125,000 ft., an altitude that can be reached by a balloon-mounted platform. DESIGN, BUILD, and FLY an unpiloted airplane to and from such a platform - at or during ISDC '98 Milwaukee.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul Swift of the Ontario Space Society (ISDC '94 Toronto) has expressed an interest in taking up this challenge.</P><H4>Mars Meteorburst Experiment</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Meteorburst communications which bounce messages off the electronic debris trails of incoming meteors high in the atmosphere have been used successfully for over-the-horizon communications by long distance trucking companies. The devices never have to wait more than a second or two before finding a suitable placed meteorburst.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because these events occur high up, this system also should work well on Mars, as a reliable backup to a more expensive to deploy and maintain satellite communications system. DESIGN, BUILD, and FLY such a system, again aboard a balloon-hung platform at an altitude of 125,000 feet.</P><H4>Igloo shielding sebatier reactor</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can shielding be manufactured by a sebatier reactor from atmospheric components on Mars? If so, a small nuclear thermal power plant could enshield a telerobotically landed Mars habitat module or complex without disturbing the boulder-strewn and possibly permafrost-hardened soil all around the campsite.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;One possibility, in theory, is DiNitrogen Pentoxide, N<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>0<FONT SIZE=1>5</FONT>, which is a white powder throughout the whole range of Martian ambient temperatures. It is dangerously chemically unstable, however. A much safer product would be simple carbon (graphite) dust, powder, or crystals.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;DESIGN, BUILD, and DEBUG a sebatier reactor device to start with a Mars-like atmospheric mix and end up with such an inert thermal shielding powder. Make note of any potentially useful atmospheric byproducts produced in the process. DEMO at ISDC '98 Milwaukee.</P><H4>Mars Hovercraft or Skimmer</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Traversing Mars boulder-cluttered strewn-fields will be slow going and impede easy, frequent, and timely travel between outpost sites on Mars by wheeled vehicles or legged walkers. A hovercraft which could skim over such routine obstacles at speed would open up the planet like nothing else could. Mars' low atmospheric density, however, makes a traditionally designed hovercraft infeasible. If the weight of such a vehicle, with cargo and fuel, could be partially (say 90%?) compensated by hydrogen aerodynamically-styled buoyancy bags, perhaps such vehicles could work. Hydrogen is safe to handle on Mars where there is no free oxygen to speak of.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;DESIGN, BUILD, TEST, and DEBUG a scale model Mars Skimmer. DEMO at ISDC '98 Milwaukee.</P><H4>A Mars "Redhouse"</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike a "greenhouse" which maintains terrestrial plants under Earth-normal ideal growing conditions in less than ideal climates, a "redhouse" would be pressurized with relatively pure Carbon Dioxide, CO<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>. BEGIN with the hardiest plants known on Earth, lichens and other tundra plants; plants that thrive in the high altiplano of the Andes, and at the tree line of other high altitude areas; plants that thrive in desert conditions; plants which survive intense cold.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The eventual goal of "redhousing" will be to breed ever hardier and hardier hybrids which someday may take hold and survive outdoors on a Mars where human intervention has succeeded in meeting them halfway by raising the carbon dioxide atmospheric pressure and ambient temperatures.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;For ISDC '98 Milwaukee, the goal is simply to DEMO a redhouse chamber with controls capable of varying the pressure and temperature.</P><H4>HOW TO PROCEED:</H4><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Game Plan:</B> Gather a group with the right mix of expertise, brainstorm a design, proice the materials and tools you will need, and make a presentation to potential corporate sponsors.</P><font size=2><a href="index.html" target="_top">Back to MMM #93</a></font>&nbsp;<a href="viking-restudy.html">&lt;-</a>&nbsp;<a href="nss-platform.html">-&gt;</a></BODY></HTML>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Moon Miners' Manifesto Issue #93</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><!-- /093/nss-fax-tree.html --><H2 align=center>NSS Media FAX Tree FAQ</H2><P><HR WIDTH=80%></P><FONT SIZE=2>by <a href="mailto:cew@acm.org">Craig E. Ward</a>, NSS VP for Chapter Affairs</FONT><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>What is a Media FAX Tree?</H4><P>The FAX Tree is a distributed publicity and media outreach tool. The Chapters of NSS, in cooperation with and independently of, the national leadership, operate FAX Tree hubs.  Each hub is comprised of one or more chapters, depending on the density of chapters, and available volunteer resources.</p><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Cooperative operation of the FAX Tree entails:</H4><P>Retransmission of NSS generated press release material. Independent operation by the chapter for publicity for local chapter events. Other material the chapter finds useful to the promotion of space development. The costs associated with operating a hub of the FAX Tree will be born by the chapter.</P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Why a Media FAX Tree?</H4><P>A media FAX Tree can raise the level of visibility of those organizing it.  The San Diego L5 chapter has been, more-or-less consistently, sending the local San Diego media announcements of their events and policy views for the last two years.  At first, their efforts seemed to fall into some gigantic Black Hole, but, by keeping it up, they have started getting significant attention.  Last September, a local San Diego news program sent a reporter and crew to cover a normal, regular SDL5 lecture at the Ruben H. Fleet Space Museum and Theater.  The SDL5 chapter made the 11 p.m. news!</P><P>Although local media singly do not have the same audience numbers as national networks or big city newspapers, together they approach or exceed those numbers. The Los Angeles Times may be the only newspaper you can find in every part of Southern California, but the circulations of the Daily Breeze, Long Beach Press-Telegram, Orange County Register and Los Angeles Daily News are definitely non-trivial.  A local chapter Media FAX Tree can enhance the ability of NSS to get its message out to literally millions of people.</P><P>With additional effort, the success of SDL5 could be translated to other NSS chapters in the U.S. giving chapters greater local media presence and enhancing the visibility of NSS beyond the national networks. A cooperative effort of local chapters and national leaders could enhance the effects and reduce the time needed to attract the attention of local media.</P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>What does the NSS do for the FAX Tree?</H4><P>The National organization provides the following:</P><ul><li>Press Releases and Background Material for distribution to the administrators of each hub.<li>The electronic mail list for distributing Press Release text.<li>Review of copies of NSS releases sent by chapters for quality control and audit.</ul><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>What does the Chapter need to do?</H4><P>A chapter will need to provide the volunteers to:</P><ul><li>Administer the fax device (usually a PC or Macintosh). <li>Receive fax materials from both NSS and the local chapter.<li>Perform quality control.<li>Find one or more volunteers to respond to any inquiries from the media.</ul><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>What are the likely costs to the Chapter?</H4><P>That will depend on the equipment you use and your telephone company rates. In Southern California, the first activations for OASIS and OCSS cost a bit more than $10 for approximately 60 FAX calls.  Costs can be kept to a minimum by letting the computer make the FAX calls during late night or early morning hours when phone rates are lowest.</P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Where can we get the FAX numbers?</H4><P>The best place is the local public library.  Look for:</P><BLOCKQUOTE>Karen Troshynski-Thomas, Ed., Gale Directory of Publica-tions and Broadcast Media, Gale Research, Inc., 1995. ISBN 0-8103-5655-4.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>You can also try the telephone book. One resource that did not prove useful was the ProCD FAX Book CD-ROM.  None of the major outlets in Los Angeles were included in its listings.  It probably would not include many in your area either.</P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>How should the local FAX Tree list be organized?</H4><P>Organize the list around the kinds of press releases you will be doing.  Roughly, there are three kinds of releases and your list should be able to access the proper targets for each kind.</P><ul><li>A Community Calendar release gives details of an upcoming event.  You are asking the publication or station to list your event in their calendars.<li>Press releases informing the media of your opinions on an issue or providing some background material to help someone understand an issue better. Media Advisories for newsworthy events that a reporter may wish to cover.</UL><P>Sometimes an event can use more than one of the above.  For example, a meeting notice would be sent to the Community Calendar portion of the list 2- to 3-weeks in advance and a Media Advisory sent to the news editor portion 2- or 3-days before the same event describing why the event should be covered.</P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Who should receive a FAX?</H4><P>Unless you have established a relationship with a particular person in a media organization, address event notices to the Community Calendar Editor and the other two to the News Editor. The people internal to the media organization should route the FAX to the correct person.
