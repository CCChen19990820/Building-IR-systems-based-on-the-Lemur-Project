		Pipes Digest #109 - September 3, 1993

Welcome to a new member:

	Neil Flatter   		(???????@???.???????????.???)

And the big news is that the RFD for the tobacco newsgroups has gone
out to news.groups. See Colin Crist's message (the last one in this
Digest.) And join us there for the fun!

BTW, Norm posts an urgent appeal for postings NOT relating to the
fine-tobacco newsgroup :-) Can anyone help him out? 

With that in mind, I'd suggest that we take discussion of the f-t
newsgroup to news.groups itself, reserving the Pipes Mailgroup and
Colin's list for discussions of tactics. Or to just light up your
favorite Dunhill (gee, it can be a cigar OR a pipe, so I'm safe! :-),
relax, and chew the rag in a friendly, if somewhat visible,
atmosphere. -S.

<a name="2">Subject: Re: Yep, The Newsgroup</a>

Steve,

Concerning the newsgroup proposal, you said:

&gt; [ Don't be down, Martin. Yes, it'll be an uphill struggle, but one
&gt; worth struggling for. -S. ]

I wonder.  You've done a superb job with this mailgroup, and the
level of discussion on it is far beyond anything I've seen on
Usenet.  A newsgroup is just too accessible to the idiot fringe.  I
suspect the folks who say "ignore them;  they'll go away" haven't
seen really determined bigots in action, and aren't paying for their
newsfeeds (neither am I, but some folks are).  As I learned in the
case of Homebrew Digest, wider circulation is a mixed blessing, at
best.

I hope you plan to keep the Digest going, whatever the fate of the
Newsgroup? 

	- Martin

[ I think moderating the group will remove the idiot fringe, Martin.
But I will indeed keep the Pipes Mailgroup running, regardless of the
vote. And thanks. -S. ]

<a name="3">Subject: So Ya wanna be a newsgroup :-&gt;</a>

Hi all,

Just my $0.02 on this newsgroup thing.  It's okay and I'll support
it come vote time,  but it will never replace the mail group in
my opinion.  Can you imagine 16 followups to one of Bill Thacker's
stories of pipes lore?  All the anti-smokers and historians will
flame forever -- who needs the hassle.

The only good that may come of it is that we will have an avenue to
advertise the mailgroup and continue to enjoy a growing membership
of serious pipe people.

&gt;From my point of view,  when I light up a pipe it is a time to
reflect,  to think,  to quietly drift off in a world of my own.
I don't want to cloud this most peaceful time with questions about
the ill effects of tobacco.  I already know all of this,  and most
everything else that the media jumps on to tell us is unhealthy.
I want to know how to keep the moisture out of my pipe,  what 
blends I should try,  the advantadges of a good meersheim (sp), et. al.

Like I said,  I'll support the group in the vote and see what happens,
but I'll probably flake out of it in a while.  If you are really
interested in getting the newsgroup going,  I would suggest a very
vague euphanism for smoking be used as the group name.  Something
like rec.churchil (Famous smoking statesm and and also the name of
a cigar).   This way,  the occasional zealot who roams through the
newsgroup file won't find smoke or tobacco and will not make the
connection.  Hey,  how about rec.light-up?  rec.SwanVestas?

Where the hell is Bill anyway,  I'm getting bored with this discussion
(although I must admit it's nice to have this much traffic in the
newletter lately).  I've been wondering if he knows how the discovery
of Briar came about,  and who first introduced this material to the
world.

For you more serious types;  tell me how to keep the moisture out of
my pipe (short of sticking cotton balls in my mouth)?

Till later (let me know where I vote)

Norm

[ At the risk of boring you still further, Norm, I think what happens
in the next two months might give Bill some material for his war
stories :-) See my comments at the top of the Digest. -S. ]

<a name="4">Subject: Here we go...</a>

All,

As promised, I shall today be starting an attempt to form two newsgroups.

1.	rec.fine-tobacco: lightly moderated - mainly automatic with a
	group of moderators (Andy, Steve and myself at present) who
	shall be forwarded possibly unsuitable articles.

2.	talk.politics.smoking: unmoderated group. Hopefully it will
	take most of the flames during formation and give some cover
	for the main group !!

Thanks for everyones support and ideas so far, if you would inform
colleagues who have expressed an interest to watch out for the
discussion and votes (I'll let you all know when) and participate
(positively please!).

I'll keep you informed of what's going on....

Colin.

(Andy - this is my first newsgroup forming attempt, as you said that
 you were involved in one before, could you send me any info and perhaps
 some help ? Cheers - Colin.)

From: ????????@????????.??????

It is a bit difficult for me to understand the discussions you have
about the new mailgroup.  Do you have to apply through a certain
procedure to start a group?  Are the names/addresses of the mailgroups
`posted' somewhere so the `antis' can poke in?

I am interested in subscribing to a few magazines about pipes, since it
is not easy to get any info about pipes here in Taiwan.  Can anyone
kindly help me out?  Thanks.

[ See the Resource Guide; you should have received a copy. If not, let
me know. -S. ]

???????@?????.??? (James Taranto) wrote requesting people interested
in starting a discussion or a newsgroup on cigars to respond to this
address.  I have been smoking a pipe for almost ten years and would
be interested in joining your pipe mail group.  As far as the cigars
go, I smoke a cigar about once a month so my tastes are still crude.
Being able to gather information about pipes, cigars, and related
tobaccoo hobbies would be of interest to me.

<a name="6">Subject: Current situation</a>

All,

I have posted a CFD to the powers that be for rec.fine-tobacco and 
talk.politics.tobacco. When/if they approve then the discussion will
follow-up on news.groups. I also copied the CFD to rec.food.drink as
quite a lot of interest has stemmed from there.

I'll let you all know when I hear anything - when I do could Steve
send the information to his mail group ?

I suggest that we be prepared for a fair amount of flames - although
in the propsed charter I explicitly stated that rec.fine-tobacco is
for the discussion of enjoying tobacco by enlightened people in 
moderation !! I think I'm right in saying that long discussions about
Marlboro or rolling non-tobacco consumables would not be welcome - 
there are other newgroups for such things !

Cheers,
	Colin.

Steve,

I figured that if I make *very* clear that the group is for more
enlightened smokers - those that take enjoyment of it and are
aware of the dangers, not really for the 40 a day Marlboro man, 
then the flames should be minimised and our chances of the
group becoming a reality are increased.

There are plenty of alcohol related groups - why not a tobacco
related one ?

Colin.

Oh - a warning to anyone traveling to the Czech Republic. Don't
attempt the local tobacco or cigarettes, they are quite incredibly
disgusting ! Even worse than Russian ones !

[ Thanks for the warning, Colin! I think we have one .cz address in
the newsgroup now, though... -S. ]

<a name="8">Subject: Re: Current situation</a>

&gt; I figured that if I make *very* clear that the group is for more
&gt; enlightened smokers - those that take enjoyment of it and are
&gt; aware of the dangers, not really for the 40 a day Marlboro man, 
&gt; then the flames should be minimised and our chances of the
&gt; group becoming a reality are increased.

True, but then again, remember the wars around Mazur's proposal for
rec.pipes. That one clearly was aimed at pipe smokers and not the
two-pack-a-day cowboy, but it still went down in flames.

Perhaps we should set up a strategy? I think there's a great danger of
getting bogged down in flame wars. I've tried to draw up a list of
points to reiterate when the flames come. Perhaps we can use the
"broken record" approach to resist the flamage.

- rec.fine-tobacco is aimed at enlightened smokers who:

	* Enjoy the moderate and considerate use of fine tobacco;
	* Smoke to appreciate fine tobacco, rather than out of
	  addiction; 
	* Recognize that tobacco smoking carries potential danger to
	  themselves and others;
	* Respect the rights of others who do not wish to be exposed
	  to tobacco smoke.

- Other newsgroups already exist within the rec. hierarchy which are
dedicated to controversial and/or dangerous activities. These groups
include, but are not limited to, the following:

	* rec.hunting:		Posession and use of deadly weapons.
	* rec.guns:

	* rec.pyrotechnics:	Construction and use of rockets,
	* rec.models.rockets:	firecrackers, and the like.

	* rec.food.drink: 	Consumption of alcohol.

	* rec.gambling:		Gambling.

	* rec.motorcycles:	Potentially dangerous sports.
	* rec.autos.sport:
	* rec.aviation.homebuilt:
	* rec.skydiving:
	* rec.scuba:
	* etc.

	* rec.nude		Prurient interest.

	* rec.arts.bodyart:	Social stigmata and bloodborne disease
				risks. 

These groups have a right to exist, as demonstrated by the fact that
they were created and now do exist. If these groups have a right to
exist, then so does rec.fine-tobacco.

- Nonsmokers who disapprove of smoking can post their disapproval
almost anywhere on the net without fear of harassment. The existence
of rec.fine-tobacco will not prevent them from continuing to do so.

- Nonsmokers have the right not to subscribe to rec.fine-tobacco if
they feel the group would offend them.

- However, _enlightened_ nonsmokers acknowledge that:

	* Other adults have a right to make their own informed
	  decisions regarding whether they will be smokers or
	  nonsmokers;  
	* Other adults have a right to enjoy fine tobacco as long as
	  they are considerate of others and obey the law;
	* Other adults have a right to engage in free speech among
	  themselves, free from harassment;
	* The acknowledgement of the above rights of adults does not
	  detract from their own rights.


How does this look? Complete enough? Too complete? Will it do any
good? Do you have any other tactical ideas?

&gt; Oh - a warning to anyone traveling to the Czech Republic. Don't
&gt; attempt the local tobacco or cigarettes, they are quite incredibly
&gt; disgusting ! Even worse than Russian ones !

I'll make sure to avoid them! (Actually, I haven't smoked a cigarette
in the past ten years, so no danger! :-)

<a name="9">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #108 - August 31, 1993</a>

Steve et al.,

I say (IMHO) let's go ahead with the proposed newsgroup.  Yes, the 
flames will be fierce.  It will probably take more than one try.
But --  how many times are we told "The Internet is for the Free
Discussion of Ideas" etc. etc. etc. and so forth?  Free speech does
include letting those you disagree with have their say, and it seems
like the flamers could be met with that point.  After all, we're not
asking them to light up a Butera or a Partagas (although it might 
help 'em if they did!) -- we just want a newsgroup!

From: ??????@?????.??? (David Chesler)
<a name="2">Subject: Better Nat Sherman's address</a>

  While vacationing this week, and enjoying Nat Sherman's Mint (beaches, and
cottages with ashtrays and without flammable clutter, and nightclubs, are
more condusive to smoking, especially cigarettes, than is the firetrap I call
home), I found a better address than the one I hurriedly sent out last week.
(Who's this Chris character anyway? :-) )

      "If your favorite Nat Sherman cigarettes are not available at your
            local tobacco counter, please mail this order form to:
           Nat Sherman, Inc.  500 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10110
 
         Call toll-free: 800-221-1690 or fax your order: 212-246-8639"
 
 Although they do have a full catalog, the order form referenced mentions only
their cigarettes, which are generally $30 per carton of 200 cigarettes,
$4 postage and handling for the first three cartons.
 
 And speaking of Marlboro-bashing, it's not such a bad cigarette (just like
a Big Mac isn't such a bad hamburger) and it is readily available.  On the
other hand, I tried the Menthol (my wife likes mint) and found it unsmokably
harsh.

           - David Chesler (??????@?????.???), not only an enjoyer of fine
                  tobacco, but also lately a non-addicted nicotine savorer.


[ Thanks, David! I'll modify the Resource Guide to include the new
address for Sherman's, and also try to avoid bashing Marlboros. We
didn't do that, did we? -S. ]

<a name="3">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #109 - September 3, 1993</a>

Steve,

Your mention of lighting up a Dunhill brings to mind a question I was
pondering recently.

Dunhill have cigars by sold by year of making, now I was wondering that 
except for the time for the tobacco to mature and mellow, is this anything
more that a sales gimmick ?

Can anyone really notice the difference in a 1988 and 1989 because of
better growing conditions ?

My strong suspicion is that of a sales ploy - anyone know for sure ?

Cheers,
	Colin.

[ I'm 100% certain that someone, somewhere, does. :-) Non-smart-alecks
who know the real answer are urged to follow up. -S. ]

Greetings;
 This is my first message to this list as I just recently joined and I thought
I would just ask a quick question. I usually buy different boxes of cigar for
variety, these get split three ways as two of my friends and myself have a
'cigar consortium' and thus we get to buy cigars more often and try different
ones than we otherwise would if one person had to smoke the whole box. At any
rate my absolute favorite cigar which I sporadically go back to is the before
mentioned Fuente Hemingway. the problem is that my usual source (Famous in NY)
has been out of these now for about 4 months. Can anyone tell me where else I
might purchase these.??
thanks

&gt;

&gt;case of Homebrew Digest, wider circulation is a mixed blessing, at
&gt;best.

As I see it, a newsgroup's accessability is a huge advantage.  Many
people subscribe to Homebrew Digest and/or read rec.crafts.brewing
before that actually make the investment to start brewing on their
own.  This gives them security in knowning that good advice is close
at hand.

When I first started smoking a pipe, I did like so many other people:
I bought a filtered Dr. Graybo and some Apple tobaccoo that had been
sitting on the drug store shelf for three million years.  [Reflective
pause to light my Ben Wade.]  Had it not been for a patient staff at
the local pipe shop, I'd probably be one of those anti-smoking freak
you're concerned about.  A newsgroup has the visibility to help these
neophites enjoy the pleasures of a good pipe.  It might also help
present an acurate representation of the risks involved in contrast
to the media lumping pipe smokers in with smokeless tobaccoo and
cigarette smokers.

Please add me to the Pipes Mailgroup routing list.  I smoke "fine" cigars
and occasionally my pipe, but I despise cigarettes.  Good luck with the
newsgroup.  I'm one of the many who've previously searched for such a
newsgroup with obviously no luck.  It's news to me that there was a
mailing list.  I hope that my inclusion not only satisfies my interest,
but also adds support in numbers to the newsgroup effort.

Wade.

[ Thanks for your interest, Wade. I must say that, regardless of
anything else, the discussion has netted us a lot of fresh blood. -S. ]

Re Sixto Gonzalez' request for cigar resources, don't forget JR's in Salem
NC (1800-jr-cigar) which bills itself as the world's largest cigar retailer
(and from my experience, one of the cheapest as they supply my Macunudo
Portofinos at about $16/box under local cost).

In response to the inquiry from a list member for a source of
Arturo Fuente Hemingway Signatures, I wanted to mention that I
have bought boxes of that (excellent) cigar, from JR Cigar in
Selma, NC.
The price is excellent too (only $54 for a box of 25).
One can call them to order or request a catalog at 1-800-JR-CIGAR.

Hope this helps,

Hello Colin,

I never smoked a vintage year cigar (is perhaps expensive and not
available in Holland), but according to the Cigar Aficionado articles
there seem to be cigars with a year on it (called vintage cigars, like
for vintage wines).

I certainly can imagine that these things are around and that they
will certainly have different tastes over the years. It is a product
of nature and the sun, water, wind, see, etc. have influence on it.

But perhaps somebody has the oppertunity of smoking such a cigar? Let
us know the results.

Beside this reaction, perhaps we could place an article in Cigar
Aficionado to get even more new memebers. I will think on this and try
to put something on the list, but perhaps a real American writing
person can do the job better;-)

All the best,

Victor

[ Not sure about that last assertion, Victor, but we could give it a
shot! I'm sure they'd be interested.  -S. ]

thanks for your prompt response to my request to join the group. i have
been smoking a pipe for about 15 years after having smoked cigarettes for
many years before. at the present time, i smoke "brigham" pipes made here
in canada. my favourite tobacco is amphora brown and occassionally i use
the red, blue and green. one of our problems in canada is the price of
tobacco. with all the taxes we have to pay, a 10 oz can of amphora that
can be purchased at the duty free store at the border in buffalo or
detroit, costs about $10.00 us will cost about $70.00 canadian. as you can
see, i try to pick one up whenever i'm in the usa. well, thats all for
now. i think i need a smoke.

[ Don't blame you a bit for buying the Amphora on this side of the
border, Duane! My apologies for thinking you were a novice, and thanks
for your interest. -S. ]

From:         Charles Huttar &lt;??????@????.??????&gt;
<a name="7">Subject:      tobacco</a>

This has to do with an earlier fantasist (?), Sir John Beaumont
(1583?-1627), who as an obviously gifted youth produced in 1602 a
mock-Ovidian poem of 1056 lines, "The Metamorphosis of Tabacco".  Earlier
English Ovidiuan writers (they were quite in vogue as John was growing up)
had tended to rewrite myths found in Ovid and to be quite serious,
sometimes moralizing (I can hear you shuddering).  Beaumont was playful,
satiric, ironic--and he concocted his own myth.  Two of them in fact. Which
of the gods, he asks, was so "bounteous to the humane race" as to create
tobacco ? (This was while Elizabeth still reigned and a couple of years
before the new king, James published his "A Counter-blaste to Tobacco"; thus
praising tobacco was still politically correct.)  Beaumont is saddled, of
course, with the historical fact that tobacco was only recently introduced
into Europe (where many seriously promoted it as a medical panacea), but
that doesn't stop him from incorporating it in narratives of much more
ancient times.

FIRST MYTH: Prometheus was caught stealing fire and punished, but to avenge
him, Earth brings forth an herb that makes the theft of fire worthwhile.
This takes place in Atlantis (which for Beaumont = America).  But Jove,
still angry, hides it from Europe.  The Graces, in their travels, happen
across it and refuse ever to go back to so-called civilization; Europeans,
desperate to recover Grace, eventually discover America.

SECOND MYTH: There is a beautiful nymph in Virginia whom Jove sees and
falls in love with; Juno finds out and transforms her into a plant, but Jove
endows this plant with healing and pleasure-giving virtues, and this is the
beginning of "the famous golden age"!  Then Proserpina destroys it, and the
world rapidly becomes more and more corrupt.  Finally Aesculapius reveals
tobacco "to our new golden age" (a typical Elizabethan theme) and invents a
smoking pipe.

                                   ***

BTW, C.Huttar's article on Sir John Beaumont appeared in full in the
DICTIONARY OF LITERARY BIOGRAPHY, Vol. 121, 1992.

<a name="8">Subject: On the Group Front</a>

In Pipes Digest #110, Neil Flatter reacted to an enigmatic remark I'd
made in Pipes Digest #109:

&gt; &gt;     ....  As I learned in the
&gt; &gt;case of Homebrew Digest, wider circulation is a mixed blessing, at
&gt; &gt;best.
&gt; 
&gt; As I see it, a newsgroup's accessability is a huge advantage.  Many
&gt; people subscribe to Homebrew Digest and/or read rec.crafts.brewing
&gt; before that actually make the investment to start brewing on their
&gt; own.  This gives them security in knowning that good advice is close
&gt; at hand.

It's a question of the balance between the number of those benefitted,
and the extent of the benefit.  For much of its history, HBD was a
mailgroup with a superb signal:noise ratio.  Its members were mutually
supportive, its discussions had a distinctly civilized and adult tone
to them, "flaming" was altogether unknown.  Its excellence, often
cited by its delighted readers, attracted more and more subscribers.
"Critical mass" was reached in the autumn of '91.  One new subscriber
proved to be a dyed-in-the-wool flame-monger, the boorishness of his
discourse exceeded only by the unsoundness of his opinions.  This
appeared to be a signal to many others who had been on their best
behavior, conforming to the group norm, and the value of the discussion
crumbled rapidly.  Many of the most valuable contributors of years
past either read but don't post, or have left altogether, feeling
they have better things to do with their time than defend themselves
from aggressive swine.  This could just as easily happen to us.  Bigger
is by no means always better.

On another subject altogether, I must say I've been pleasantly surprised
by the discussions so far concerning the possible new newsgroups.  The
anticipated flamefest hasn't materialized, and even the handful of folks
who seemed to look for any specious argument they could club us with,
seems to have calmed down.  The potential for a "rec.connoisseur.*"
hierarchy seems promising.  Onward!

providing matches and butane. I also think that the discussion on

<a name="2">Subject: The History of Briar</a>

Norm asks the eternal question:

&gt; Where the hell is Bill anyway...

&gt; I've been wondering if he knows how the discovery
&gt; of Briar came about,  and who first introduced this material to the
&gt; world.

I'll defer the latter question to philosphers and the clergy.  But oddly
enough, I've just finished researching the question of the discovery of
briar.

Traditional has it that briar pipes were introduced in the early 1800's by
one of Napoleon's officers.  At the time clay pipes were the norm (er, no 
relation), but apparently this chap took a nasty spill from his horse and
his pipe bravely threw itself between him and the ground, cushioning his 
fall but with tragic consequences.  

As no gentleman of the day would be caught without a pipe, the officer
began searching for a replacement in nearby villages.  He happened upon a
woodcarver who offered to construct a pipe from a particularly hard and
durable wood he knew of.  The officer, in desperation, consented, and soon
realized the superiority of his new pipe over clay; the briar pipe was 
born.  

Well, that's certainly romantic, and perhaps even true, yet this Frenchman
can hardly be credited with the discovery of the briar pipe.  At best, he
deserves recognition for reintroducing this bastion of smokingdom to
Europe.

Nor do I put any stock in Greek legend.  Their mythology has is that Athena
(goddess of wisdom and battle) and Poseidon (god of the sea) had a contest
to gain the loyalty of the city of Athens. Poseidon created the horse; 
Athena responded with the briar tree; and the citizens of Athens chose 
Athena's gift as the more useful and took her as their patron goddess.  
Poseidon was naturally jealous, and to this day no pipe will remain lit 
underwater.  While this myth serves to explain the abundance of briar in 
the Mediterranean region, the complete absence of pipes in Greek lore 
reveals that something is amiss in this account.  

The truth lies shrouded in the mists of history.  The Calumets (or "peace
pipes") used by the native Americans,for instance,show evidence of common
lineage to the ceremonial pipes used by the natives of Kamchatka and 
Irkutsk,indicating that smoking and wooden pipes must have migrated to 
North America before the loss of the Siberia-Alaska land bridge.  It 
appears that these Siberian pipes were themselves crude copies of the 
ornate ceramic pipes enjoyed by the Chinese rulers in the Forbidden City 
during the Han dynasty.  Similar degenerate pipes are found in the ruins of
ancient civilizations throughout Asia.

At this point the evidence becomes sparse, but it seems clear that
pipes, like so many other things, were introduced to Europe by the Mongol
tribes.  These horse nomads traveled from Asia throughout eastern Europe,
bringing with them exotic customs, goods, and diseases.

The Mongols, of course, had no artisans who could work with ceramics, and
were forced to improvise pipes from the materials they had on hand.
Fragmented accounts indicate that early experiments with dung pipes were
failures (these same accounts, incidentally, provide us with evidence of
both ritual gift-giving to the Khan and detailed descriptions of capital 
punishment under Mongol law).  

Eventually, the mongols found in their travels a suitable material.  The 
discovery came during their westward migration/invasion. Genghis Khan, then
chieftain of all the tribes, had broken his last ceramic pipe (looted from
China) and was inconsolable.  His advisors, fearing the wrath of Khan, sent
scouts in all directions to find a replacement.  Two of the scouts, 
brothers named St'yek and St'yon, were sent into the high passes of the 
Ural Mountains. It being the dead of winter, simply surviving these frigid
heights was a severe test, and a quest such as this was practically a 
suicide mission.    

The full details of their ordeal have not survived in the oral tradition of
the mongols' descendants.  We do know that during their first night above
5,000 feet, their rations froze solid; it was so cold, in fact, that they
couldn't make a spark from their flint fly far enough to light a fire with
which to cook or even thaw their food.  St'yon, we learn, soon died of 
exposure and malnutrition; but St'yek, a more resourceful man, found that
his horse was so numb from the cold that he could carve a chunk of raw meat
from its flank without causing so much as a flinch, and thus he gained 
nourishment to continue his search.  

(I know this is starting to get pretty boring; stick with me, we're almost
there. 8-)

Three weeks later, St'yek's horse bore him back to the tribesmen.  He was
near death; his hands and feet were completely frostbitten, his skin was 
blue, his hair a mass of solid ice.  (His horse, needless to say, wasn't
in particularly good shape itself. )  But in a pouch on his belt was found
a small block of an unusual wood; tight-grained, dense, and strong, the 
pipe-making material the Khan's advisors had sought.  Asked the name of 
this fabulous wood, the shivering St'yek would only respond, "Brrrr.Br'rrr."  

The best woodcarvers were called, and a pipe was fashioned.  The Great Khan
was well pleased!  He described his wooden pipe as, "more pleasurable than
driving your enemies before you, seeing their severed heads lying at your
feet, and hearing the lamentations of their women.  " High praise,indeed.
He ordered that more of this Br'r wood be found, and naturally the lesser
khans soon demanded Br'r pipes of their own.  St'yek had by this time 
recovered consciousness and was able to describe in detail the location of
this vital wood.  Other riders were sent, bringing back supplies of Br'r 
wood and young seedlings, which the mongols took with them and planted at
intervals along their way.  (Nearly two thousand years later this would 
serve as the inspiration for a young Jonathan Wilson, better known as 
"Johnny Appleseed."  ) And of course, the years have transmogrified the 
word "Br'r" into Briar. 

The importance of St'yek's discovery cannot be overstated.  St'yek, as a 
result of his frostbite, lost both hands and both feet.  A man in this 
condition, unable to ride a horse, would normally be abandoned by the 
mongol tribesmen.  But Genghis was so thankful for the young man's 
discovery that he granted him the lands of the south Ukraine and Crimea for
the perpetual use of his family, and gave him the the honorary title, 
"Tartar", meaning "Wood Finder".   Though his contribution to smoking is
nearly forgotten today, the gourmets of the world are more grateful;
St'yek Tartar's name is celebrated on restaurant menus world-wide in honor
of his culinary innovation.

Just a note on the discussion of vintage cigars...Macanudo makes
a range of Vintage Cabinet Selection cigars.  Two years ago I smoked
a box of five vintage 1988.  I'd say that the price--$5 a
cigar--is justified; they are considerably better than your
average 2 or 3 dollar cigar.  But the price is still prohibitive
for me most of the time.

I think aging may have something to do with the quality, but the
main thing is the vintage year.  The box says that in 1988 Macanudo 
acquired an especially good crop of cigar tobacco. 

I'd recommend trying one of them, if you've got 5 bucks you don't
especially need.

Thank you for such a speedy response.  As it happens, I am a Graduate student
at Marquette University, and I have been smoking pipes for about four years
now.  A friend of mine and I decided that because we were studying Philosophy,
it was imperative that we begin smoking pipes.  I have come to see that this
was a wise decision.
	Here in Milwaukee there are two tobacco stores that I enjoy going to:
	1)Uhle's - famous in Milwaukee, for pipes and tobacco.  The tobacco
they sell tends to be dry.
	2)Edward's - up and coming.  The blending they do here is unmatched in
Milwaukee, as far as I know.  Their tobacco tends to be sweeter.  They have an
outstanding variety.

The winner is: rec.tobacco

Here's how the votes came in:

	                        1st	2nd	3rd
rec.conoisseur.tobacco   	2	  4	  0
rec.tobacco.X             	0  	  2  	  0
rec.fine-tobacco         	0  	  1	  5
rec.tobacco	              	5  	  0	  1
rec.matchstrikers        	1	  0  	  0
rec.conoisseur.X	        1	  0  	  0

...Where X is an initial split of cigar/pipe subgroups. In nearly all
weightings, rec.tobacco won. Rec.conoisseur.tobacco comes in second.
(Since you were about to start calculating: a weighting of 6/5/1 gives
rec.conoisseur.tobacco the edge.)
    As was always the case, the group will be moderated. We still need a
site that can do the moderating. (Steve, Colin and I will moderate.) I
assume that this will work by setting up a common account that the three
of us have access to, and allowing us to telnet to a machine with that
account. I understand that moderating software is available. If anyone
on the list is able to set up such an account, let me know. It should be
on a site that will be around for a while.

P.S.: We haven't actually discussed our favorite topic in a while, and
I'd like to give a smoke report: Yesterday I had a perfectly humidified
La Gloria Cubana Soberano. It was almost a cross between a Hoyo de
Monterray Excalibur, and some of the cuban cigars I've had: considerably
more harsh that the Hoyo, but even richer, more complex flavors. This is
the second time I've tried a La Gloria Cubana, and each time I was
impressed. I've been told that the cuban cigars that I've had (and that
I considered _very_ full bodied) are actually mild by cuban standards.
I'm still waiting to try a large, blockbuster cuban smoke.

		 Pipes Digest #114 - October 5, 1993

SPECIAL: REC.TOBACCO NEWSGROUP VOTING INFO IN THIS ISSUE!

Welcome to new members:

	Tom Zweng, M.D.		(??????@??????.???.???)
	Michael Wolff		(????????@???????.???????.???)

And you may have noticed that there is no Pipes Digest #113. This is
to avoid bad luck on the rec.tobacco newsgroup call for votes, which
follows immediately. We've also got a shaggy-dog story from David
Urbanski, and a cigar report from Wade Corbett.

Wish us luck, and please don't forget to vote!

<a name="2">Subject: CFV: rec.tobacco</a>

                      1st CALL FOR VOTES (of 2)
 
                     Moderated group rec.tobacco
 

Newsgroups line:
rec.tobacco		Fine tobaccos, cigars, pipes, collecting. (Moderated)

Votes must be received by 23:59:59 UTC, 26 Oct 1993.

This vote is being conducted by a neutral third party.  For voting
questions only, contact Mark James &lt;??????@????????.???&gt;.  For questions
about the proposed group, contact any of the proposed moderators.

This CFV is also being sent to the Pipes mailing list 
&lt;?????@????.???????.???&gt;.


MODERATORS
----------

The group would be moderated on a rotating basis by the following
persons:

Colin Crist		(???@??????.??.??.??)
Steve Masticola		(????????@???.???????.???)
Andrew Tepper		(at15+@andrew.cmu.edu)


CHARTER:  The following statement is taken from the proposers.
-------

The rec.tobacco newsgroup provides a forum for discussing the moderate
use and appreciation of fine tobacco, including cigars, pipes, quality
cigarettes, pipe making and carving, snuff, collectible tobacciana,
publications, and related topics. The group is lightly moderated to
prevent flame (except for the purpose of lighting up.)


1.  Etiquette and Moderation Policy

The readers of, and submitters to, rec.tobacco are assumed by this
charter to be mature adults, who can make their own informed choices
regarding tobacco, who are aware of the potential risks of excessive
tobacco use, and who respect the wishes and rights of others, whether
they are smokers or nonsmokers.  Other readers and submitters should
also make the same assumptions.

Rec.tobacco is specifically _not_ a forum for the debate of smoking
versus antismoking issues, bashing, flamage, morality lectures, etc.
Submitters wishing to initiate such discussions will be directed by
the moderators to whatever other newsgroup they deem appropriate.

The purpose of rec.tobacco is to facilitate communication among
fine-tobacco aficionados, not to deny it to others. The moderators
will periodically post a "Frequently Asked Questions" (FAQ) message to
the group, to inform the readers (among other things) of the
newsgroups to which the submitters of bounced messages are suggested
to repost.


2.  Rationale

In brief, there is currently no newsgroup in which those who
appreciate fine tobaccos can gather to discuss their hobby, and
significant demand has been demonstrated for such a group. The
100-plus members of the moderated Pipes Mailgroup
(?????@????.???????.???), and discussions on rec.food.drink and in
news.groups, show that the demand exists for a fine-tobacco newsgroup.

The rec.food.drink discussions, and Elias Mazur's earlier discussions
on news.groups (in 1989, regarding a "rec.pipes" proposal), further
demonstrated that moderation of the group would be needed to prevent
excessive flamage.

The name "rec.tobacco" was chosen after considering many alternative
proposals, in detailed discussion on news.groups and off-line.
Extensive efforts to find a third-level name for the group, and many
suggestions for a third-level name, did not produce a completely
satisfactory result. The name we propose also permits splits, should
the need arise. While "rec.tobacco" is a compromise, we feel that it
is a necessary, and a satisfactory, one.


3.  Special Notes

The following is information for voters, and is not part of the
permanent charter.

Smoking is a controversial, hot-button issue, about which many people
have strong opinions. Many nonsmokers have valid objections to smokers
who do not consider their rights. They are perfectly correct in
objecting to rude behavior. We support their right to object; we also
support mature, considerate behavior on the part of smokers.

However, regardless of one's personal stance on smoking, we believe
that thoughtful people should not vote against this (or any other)
newsgroup simply because they personally disapprove of the subject
matter.  Rather, we hope that the voters will remember the two basic
issues behind newsgroup creation: (a) whether the charter is
well-formed, and (b) whether sufficient interest exists in the subject
of the group.  (The latter is discussed later in the Rationale.) We
hope that you will judge the group on this basis, and on no other.

Along with the proposal for rec.tobacco, we are simultaneously
proposing an unmoderated group, "talk.politics.smoking," for
discussion of the political, legal, health, and social issues
surrounding smoking. The CFV for talk.politics.smoking should also be
posted in the group in which you are reading this. Regardless of
whether talk.politics.smoking passes, there are other (if somewhat
less appropriate) places on the Net for such discussion.  We do not
wish to, and in fact can not, deny anyone their right to speak their
mind on smoking issues.

We simply wish our own place to enjoy and discuss our hobby, in
moderation, and in peace.


STANDARD VOTING INFO
--------------------

You should send E-MAIL (posts to a group are invalid) to:

      ??????@????????.???

(just replying by MAIL to this message should work).  Your mail
message should contain one and only one of the following statements:

      I vote YES on rec.tobacco
or
      I vote NO on rec.tobacco

You may add a comment, or use other wording, but anything other than 
a definite, unconditional, unambiguous statement for or against the
creation of rec.tobacco will be rejected.

If you later change your mind you may vote again; only your last valid
vote will count.  You may also send in an "abstain" vote in the same 
manner, using "abstain" in place of "yes" or "no".  This will cancel
any previous vote.

All votes will be acknowledged by E-mail.  If you don't receive an
acknowledgment within a few days of your vote, vote again.  A list of
any acknowledgment messages that bounce back to me will be posted in a
second Call for Votes article.  (CFV articles will *not* otherwise
contain mass vote acknowledgments.)  The complete vote list will be
posted with the vote result.

Standard Guidelines for voting apply: no more than one vote per person,
no more than one vote per account.  The requirements for group creation
are 100 more YES votes than NO votes, and 2/3 of all votes being YES.

CHARTER

  The talk.politics.smoking newsgroup provides an open forum for
  discussing the political, legal, health, and ethical issues related to
  tobacco smoking. This charter specifically remains neutral on these
  issues.

  Etiquette
  ---------

  The readers of, and submitters to, talk.politics.smoking are assumed by
  this charter to be mature adults, who can make their own informed
  choices regarding smoking, and who respect the wishes and rights of
  others, whether they are smokers or nonsmokers. Other readers and
  submitters should also make the same assumptions. Ad hominem attacks,
  bashing, flamage, morality lectures, etc. are specifically discouraged
  by this charter.


RATIONALE

  In brief, there is currently no newsgroup which is specifically
  dedicated to the issues surrounding tobacco smoking. Discussions on
  this topic periodically appear in almost every newsgroup on the Net,
  and are, for the most part, inappropriate to the group in which they
  appear. A specific, designated place for discussions on
  smoking/nonsmoking issues is badly needed on the Net. Discussion in
  news.groups on the creation of talk.politics.smoking has been mostly
  favorable.

STANDARD VOTING INFO

You should send MAIL (posts to a group are invalid) to

      ?????@????????.??? 

(just replying by MAIL to this posting should work, *if* your
newsreader honors the "Reply-To" line in the article header). Votes
sent to other addresses will be discarded.  Your mail message should
contain one and only one of the following statements:

      I vote YES on talk.politics.smoking
      I vote NO on talk.politics.smoking
      I vote ABSTAIN talk.politics.smoking

You may add a comment, but anything other than a definite statement
involving the group name and "yes", "no", "for", or "against" on a
single line may be rejected by the automatic vote counting program.
If you later change your mind you may send in another vote, which will
automatically supercede all previous votes. "ABSTAIN" votes serve to
cancel previous votes.

Standard Guidelines for voting apply.  For the group to be created,
100 more YES votes than NO votes must be cast, and 2/3 of all valid
votes must be YES votes. "ABSTAIN" votes are not counted in either
calculation; their only role is to cancel previous votes. A single
user may send no more than one vote, no matter how many accounts he or
she might have. Furthermore, a single account may cast only one vote,
no matter how many users may share that account.

Every vote will be acknowledged by EMail. The CFV will be repeated
once; the 2d CFV will contain a "bounce-ack", i.e. a list of people
whose ACK messages bounced when I sent them.

<a name="4">Subject: A story.</a>

	Greetings from Milwaukee.

	You know, you can always tell which way the wind is blowing
downtown, because of the smell in the air.  Actually, it's hard to
tell now if it's coming out of the North, since they took down the
chocolate factory.  When it's out of the East, we can smell the river
- and anything floating therein.  When it's out of the South, we have
the good fortune of catching wind of the progress that they're making
at the tanneries.  (I try to go on a short retreat - anywhere - when
it's out of the South.)  Out of the Southwest we've got a smell that
the people of Milwaukee are divided on - yeast.  Some people like it,
some people don't.  I kind of like it, but it's a lot like listening
to my mother talk: too much makes my head hurt.  (Don't get me wrong -
I love my mother.  If it weren't for her, I never would have tasted a
Guinness or smoked a pipe.)

	Now then, I've got a story to tell, so buckle down and loosen
up.  I have this friend.  Iggy.  His full name is Ignatious Podowa.
No one knows what nationality he is, and most of us are afraid to ask.
He looks a little like an iguana, but he certainly doesn't act like
one, so we just leave his appearances alone, if you know what I mean.
Children are afraid to touch him.  We're not sure why.  He always has
a cigar in his mouth.  I've tried to get him to try a pipe, but he
can't take the cigars out long enough to light a pipe.  That's okay by
me, because I don't want anybody smoking a pipe who doesn't want to,
who can't appreciate it to the fullest.

	Well, now sure enough Iggy wanted to get a dog.  He's not
married, so we all thought it would do him some good.  If children
won't touch him, maybe a dog will.  Or so we thought.  He and I and
Bob Stillman, who can never go ten minutes before he's got to find
toilet, went out in search of a dog for Iggy.  We tried all of the pet
stores.  This didn't work too well, because whenever he went into the
store, all of the birds would start shouting.  I think I even heard
one of the talking birds shout a curse to God.  I assumed it was
cursing God for the life of Iggy.  I was a bit scandalized.  There was
a second problem too.  Whenever Iggy went to pick up one of the dogs,
if there were children in the store, which there almost always were,
they'd cry, as if Iggy were there to rip the little puppies apart.  I
don't think that was ever his intention, although I never asked him.

	Well, we got to the end of our list of places to look at dogs,
when there was only one left.  Iggy had gone through the whole list,
going from place to place with us, never finding a suitable dog.
Either he didn't like the dog, or, more frequently, the dog didn't
like him.  Some of the last few were private homes.  Many of the
people didn't want to let us in once they got a look at Iggy.  This
was sort of a problem, because Bob Stillman had to use a water-closet
pretty badly by the second of third house.  We had a plan to let Bob
go to the door first, petition for the use of the bathroom, whereafter
Iggy and I would stroll up to check out the dog.  But Iggy would have
none of it, because he thought it would seem strange to just knock on
somebody's door, asking to relieve yourself.  Iggy thought it would
lower his chances of getting the dog.

	By the sixth house, nobody was happy.  There was Iggy,
dogless, there was Bob Stillman, holding his crotch, and there I was,
listening to the both of them whine.  Finally, the last house we came
to was owned by a sixty-three year old blind woman.  Her seeing-eye
dog, an AKC Golden Retriever, had apparently been raped by the Chi Tzu
next-door, leaving her with a truly ugly litter that she could barely
find, let alone sustain.  Iggy was thrilled to see that she was blind,
and almost gave out a "Coo!" when he figured it out.  Without waisting
any time, he went over to one of the newborn pups, decided that it
liked him well enough, handed her the money - and did not cheat her
one dollar, I might add, which might be the temptation when dealing
with the blind - and we got out of there in a hurry with Iggy's new
dog.
	What we didn't realize was that Bob Stillman, having reached a
kind of plateau of pain, had also taken advantage of the fact that the
woman was blind by sneaking into her bathroom.  Iggy was so happy to
find a dog, and I was so relieved that I could go home, and Bob
Stillman took such a long time, that we left without him.

	Iggy is fairly happy now that he has a dog.  It's the ugliest
thing I've ever seen in my life.  Iggy doesn't care though, because
the dog likes him too.  Iggy named it "Donaldson," since it kept
sticking its nose in places that it shouldn't be stuck.  Bob Stillman
has not yet told us what happened after we left, but he did have two
bruises on his face the next day.  Maybe someday he'll tell us.

From: "Wade D. Corbett" &lt;???????@??.???.???&gt;
<a name="5">Subject: Havanas - Benchmarking Cigars</a>

Well, folks - I just got back from Toronto where I finally found out
for myself about the Havana Hype.  My purchases included the Montecristo #2,
Romeo y Julieta Churchill, Cohiba Robusto &amp; Esplendido, Simon Bolivar
Corona Gigantes, Partagas Lusitania &amp; Series D #4, and Hoyo de Monterrey
Double Corona - and a few others.  Each cigar that I smoked was quite
different:  I thought the Monty #2 was harsh and overrated.  However,
the Cohiba was without question the very best cigar that I've ever smoked;
it is like smoking creamy chocolate - and it is gorgeous.

To make a long story short, the best place in Toronto to buy cigars is
the Havana House.  They import and distribute Cuban tobacco for all of
Canada.  Ask for Peter Dobbs at the Cumberland St. location, or give him
a call at 416-927-7703.  He may be able to help you plan a tasting.

Please send me e-mail if you have any questions.

Also, to qualify my taste - my favorite house cigar is the Arturo Fuene 8-5-8,
and it's available in claro, natural, and maduro.  All three are quite
different in taste, but have characteristics of coffee with sweet spiciness.
I haven't tried the A. Fuente Canyones, but I think it's similar tobacco,
only in a larger size.  I personally don't like the Hemingways as well -
they burn too quickly being losely rolled, and they have like a nutmeg
spice flavor which is alright, but not as much to my liking as their
Connecticut Shade wrapped smokes.  So, I'd guess you'd say I like a
chocolate coffee cigar that is not harsh or have a bite, has a sweet
spiciness and burns cool, and is a joy to watch burn with a silky wrapper.
IMHO, the 8-5-8 is gorgeous. 

And last night I smoked an Aliados Piramide which was almost like a
torpedo-shaped Cohiba...

[ Great info, Wade! -S. ]

And, as many of you commented, the Digest hasn't been sent out in some
time. I'd been holding off until the voting was complete on the
proposed Big 7 newsgroups, rec.tobacco and talk.politics.smoking.
Unfortunately, neither of them passed. I've excerpted the final
results below.

However, those of you who can receive it should check out alt.smokers.
Although it's an unmoderated group with low distribution, there are
still discussions of a fine-tobacco nature to be joined. I'll be
posting a call for participation in the Pipes Mailgroup there every
month or so.

And don't forget: Election Day in the U.S. is tomorrow, so don't
forget to vote! And enjoy your favorite tobak afterward. As always,

				Smoke in peace,

(Yes, I'm still ???????@???.???????????.???, but I'm trying out a

I was asked about making an armchair pipe, but I've never heard of  
such a specimen.  Is it simply another name for the long,

<a name="3">Subject: Traveling and Some Notes</a>

Hello all,

I just wanted to introduce myself to the group, and drop a few notes about 
my recent travels.
First of all I'm a 32 year old computer consultant, from Suburban Detroit 
and have been happily smoking a pipe and
little else since I was 15.   Over that time I've garnered a collection of 
well over 100 high-grades
to seconds, that I rotate through as the mood strikes.  In my job, I travel 
about quite a bit and
want to report on some pipe shops I've visited:

Cut 'N Puff - Fifth Street, Moline, IL
Visiting my sister in Davenport, I've stopped by this store several times.  
The proprietor keeps an excellent selection
of high-grades and mid-priced pipes as well a good selection of 
accessories.  I'm happy to report that here I purchased
my first Charatan.  It's a medium-sized canadian, and smokes EXCEPTIONALLY 
well.  I'm very, very pleased.  

The atmosphere of this shop is extremely friendly.  Local folk are always 
popping in filling up their pipes, or selecting
among a large cigar assortment and swapping stories of the local trade.  
The only thing that's a bit different about this
shop is that it accepts no credit cards of any kind.  That can be a bit 
daunting for the traveler, since I rarely carry cash.
Fortunately, there's a money-machine located conveniently across the 
street.

Up In Smoke - Galleria Mall, Dallas TX
This is a nice little store with a friendly staff and an exceptional 
selection of Peterson's and a number of Tim West pipes.
They've got a nice selection of accessories, and good tobacco selection.  
Again, I picked up a nice prize, a Peterson Oom-Paul without
a metal band. (I'm not fond of the metal fittings on most Petersons, and 
when I find one that doesn't have one, it is usually a keeper).
I also picked up a pouch of their Vanilla Supreme which proved to be very 
satisfying.

AA Tobacco Barn - El Toro Rd, El Toro, CA
While visiting my other sibling in LA, I stopped at this nice little shop.  
They've recently moved from an older location and the
renovations are quite nice, although the shop is much smaller.  Their 
specialty is in fine high-grades.  They've got a number
of Savinelli signatures as well as Dunhills.  A little pricey for my 
tastes, but always nice to look.  If you stop by, be sure to
see the Giant Full-Bent Peterson that was made for Alfred Hitchcock.  Its 
an amazing piece of work.

As always, I'm eager to hear about places to visit when I travel, so please 
drop a line when you find a special place.

<a name="4">Subject: Smoke Report: Nat Sherman Cigars</a>

I went to NYC 2 weeks ago and stopped at Nat Sherman. After hearing good
things about their cigars on the net I bought a sampling in sizes from
Robusto to Churchill. (I skipped the thinner shapes.) So far I have
tried three, and overall have been a bit disappointed.

Let me first describe their store: I could not imagine a more pleasant
place to buy fine cigars and accessories. Downstairs is a small room
staffed by several people who know their products perfectly. After
selecting a half dozen smokes from their cabinet humidors the
salesperson suggested I look into some of their vintage cigars upstairs.
The upper level was a beautiful smoking lounge with additional display
cases of accessories. It contained a large walk-in humidor, and we
headed inside. The smell was fantastic, and the selection enormous. I
was told that some customers buy boxes of a favorite vintage of cigar (5
box minimum) and keep them inside the humidor to be removed as needed. I
selected another 3 cigars and was on my way.

That evening after dinner I headed to the '21' Club for cognac and a
cigar. I had a Nat Sherman Gotham Selection (and splurged for a glass of
Louis XIII cognac!) The cigar had only a bit of harshness, but certainly
not as light as a Macanudo. Maybe my expectations were too high, but
there was just nothing distinctive about it. My score:75

A few days later I tried a Nat Sherman Landmark Selection. This cigar
was the best of the three I've had. It had a much richer, more aromatic
flavor. Again, very little harshness for such a flavorful smoke. My
score:85

Tonight I tried a Nat Sherman Manhatten Selection. This seemed like a
spicy version of the first, and did have some distinctive character.
Still, the "ash" flavor (I've never heard that term used before to
describe cigars!) predominated. It got quite harsh toward the end. My
score:81

I'm still looking forward to the vintage cigars I bought from their
upstairs humidor, but overall I was expecting better, more distinctive
tobaccos. Guess I'll have to go to Canada for those. :)

 My name is Zoltan Farkas, I'm a junior student of Computer Engineering &amp;
 Science at the University of Veszprem, Hungary.For my grandfather is 
 (among others) a carver, pipes and other carvings have always been a part
 of my life, though I didn't smoke until the age of 18.
  Pipe smoking has rich traditions in Hungary, the habit originates from
 the 17th century,when, due to Habsburg influence, the Nobility began to 
 smoke. They've always preferred Western European (especially French) pipes
 and tobaccoes, while the poorer classes smoked claypipes and used terrible
 home-grown weeds.As with tobacco, situation remained the same;we smoke 
 imported Dutch and Swedish tobaccoes, while most of the pipes available
 here are Hungarian. Some words about the prices:a simple pipe costs $6-12,
 price of quality pipes range from $80 to infinity, Hungarian tobacco costs
 $0.70-$1,while imported ones cost $2.20-$5.
   As with my interests, I love history, especially pre-history, and 
 literature. My favourite writers are Hemingway, Robert Merle, and above all,
 J.R.R.Tolkien.I'm a pipe carver also (though beginner, very enthusiastic) who
 would like to learn more about different techniques and designs.

Hello Steve- I received Pipes Digest #114 yesterday, and thoroughly
enjoyed it- thanks for adding me on.

I have already voted for the tobacco newsgroup- I am keeping my
fingers crossed.

Are there any FAQs for Pipes Digest?  What is in/out of bounds as far
as this group?

Is there a way to access pass issues of PD?  Are they stored in a
computer I can get access to?

I appreciate your help.

Oh- one more question- are you the editor of PD?  Are you the one I
contact for questions?

Thanks for your help.  

Go Rec. Tobacco!!!

[ Sorry, Zoltan, there's no formal FAQ, though we do have a Resource
Guide and a "How-to" guide for the beginning pipe smoker. Does anyone
feel energetic enough to help get a full FAQ together? -S. ]

 Hi Steve- thanks for getting back to me so quickly.


- I can mail you the past issues; just let me know how far back you want
to go.
- I'm the moderator of the Pipes Digest.

I don't want to create too much of a burden.  I would be interested in
the past year if possible.

My interests focus mainly on cigars.  How about yourself?

Do you know if the Cigar Aficionado magazine has an E-mail address?
There are a couple of suggestions/questions I have and I would love to
fire them off- snail mail is just too much of a hassle.

Thanks for your help Steve.

Hey Steve, I haven't received a digest since #114 on october 5!!

I just wanted to comment on how personal cigar preferences really are
and why I dislike the ratings in the cigar aficionado magazine. I've
been smoking a lot of different cigars for the last few months since
fuente hemingway's became unavailable. These BTW are my favorites but
in a previous pipe digest someone mentioned that they prefered regular
fuentes to hemingways, the same thing happened when I called Famous in
NY, art suggested I buy regular fuentes as they were very similar,
however I can tell the difference just by the aroma if someone else is
smoking across the room.

Similarly I bought Pleidaes (overpriced and overrated, in the next issue
they fell more than ten points), Hoyo de Monterey excalibur (very nice,
strong coffee and nutmeg flavor), some Punch which i also enjoyed very
much and finally the Aliados piramide which I also considered to be 
overpriced, they had a very strange flavor, harsh but flavorless if
you know what I mean but I may just have received a bad box because
the last tasted better than the first ones, certainly not like
cohibas though.

I have resorted to my fallback of smoking Upmanns, my second favorite
and of which I consider their petit coronas to be probably the finest
examples of that size at any price. One comment I have is that after
moving to the tropics from Utah the flavors are quite a bit different,
I don't know it is the humidity, the altitude or what but I find any
cigar here has a much richer taste, more personality and much more
complex flavor profile, maybe my cigars where just drying out in
Utah???

A lot of membership activity this week! Welcome, all! I took the
liberty of mailing to all the people who'd voted "Yes" for
rec.tobacco, but who weren't already members of the mailgroup. And
therein lies the Tale of the Compunerd.

When I do mass mailings, I usually use a blind carbon copy. Well, this
time, the mailer here hung, and retried every hour to send the
invitation to someone. And every time it retried, it sent not to just
that Special Someone, but to a lot of other people... had people on
two continents mad. Ah, nothing like coming in in the morning to face
an intercontinental technodiplomatic crisis...

Well, that's over, and I'm sorry for deluging the unfortunate people
on the list with mail. If you're having any problems, please let me
know. BTW, I'm converting from a BCC to individual mailings per
person. Lots less potential for horrible disaster... :-)

In any case, light one up, kick back, and enjoy! -S.

Steve,

Ah well, we failed !

Thanks to you (and if you pop this in the next digest) to all who had
a hand in the attempt to for the smoking newsgroup. The closeness of
the vote shows that we are doing something right !

Anyway, now that all this discussion and campaigning is over I think
I shall have my last Nat Sherman Carpe Diem tonight and perhaps
a glass (or maybe two ;-) of port. I suppose the best thing that has 
come out of all this is that the pipes newsgroup has lots more members!

Thanks again !

Colin.

so if any mail bounces is a few weeks then I've moved and I'll 
email you with my new address as soon as possible)

[ Path changed, Colin... and we didn't exactly fail, in a larger
sense. The Mailgroup increased its size by about 60% as a result of
the newsgroup proposal. Hope you enjoyed the cigar. -S. ]

<a name="3">Subject: Tobacco tax increases</a>

Hello everybody-

My name is Tom Zweng.  I just signed on to the Pipes Digest this past issue.

I smoke cigars, but I enjoy reading about pipes/tobacco as well.

I came across an interesting article in the NY Times Newspaper from Saturday, 
Oct 30th.

It discussed the proposed tax increases on both cigar and pipe tobacco that the 
Clinton administration is suggesting.

Presently, the Federal "large cigar" tax is 3 cents.  That will increase to 12 
cents a cigar.  The Fed pipe tobacco tax will increase 1,852% for a total of 
$13/lb!!!  The article didn't mention the present pipe tobacco tax, but those 
of you with a good math base will be able to figure it out from the numbers I 
just gave you.

The article goes on to talk about other issues related to cigar smokers and 
includes a short interview with Lew Rothman, president of  J.R. Rothman, the 
nation's largest cigar catalog dealer.  According to Rothman, our Prez smokes 
Arturo Fuente 19-12s.  He has a box shipped every 4-5 weeks.  To quote Mr 
Rothman: "Somebody else pays, or his wife gets mad."  No surprisde there!!!

I'm glad to be aboard- I've enjoyed what I have read so far.

[ $13/lb?!?!?! Addresses of Congresscritters are available upon
request. Grrrr! -S. ]

Steve:

All cigar smokers on the mailing list should read an article in the
Saturday, Oct. 30, New York Times on taxes and cigars.  It was really a
chance to get some great cigar stuff in there, while the tax stuff
convinced the editors to run it. :)

&lt;drum roll please&gt;  Here are the brands President Clinton likes: Arturo
Fuente 19-12s ($1.75 each) and Trafalgar 4 ($5 each).  The latter being
too expensive for me, has anyone tried the former?

And, BTW, George Burns smokes El Productos, which he gets for free,
because he's on stage, talking most of the time, his agent says.  "A good
cigar, you have to keep smoking it so it doesn't go out," he says.  "Cheap
cigars keep burning."

Ah, the wisdom one must accumulate by 97...

Hi everyone.

Here's a little bit about me.  I'm a 23 year old electrical engineering
student (fourth year at Waterloo).  I've loved the smell of a pipe being
smoked for as long as I can remember.  I tried smoking a pipe when I was
16 and liked it, but wondered where I could enjoy such a "mature" habit as
a highschool student.  I haven't really smoked a pipe since then but am
interested in starting up again.  I think I've seen one other person on
campus smoking a pipe at one of the bars.  Are there any younger pipe
smokers out there?

Steve, could you send me the "How-to" guide and a few (10) back issues
of the digest?

Thanks.

Dave

&gt;However, those of you who can receive it should check out alt.smokers.
&gt;Although it's an unmoderated group with low distribution, there are
&gt;still discussions of a fine-tobacco nature to be joined. I'll be
&gt;posting a call for participation in the Pipes Mailgroup there every
&gt;month or so.
        As the creator of alt.smokers, I'd like to thank you for encouraging 
your readers to read (and also hopefully to contribute to) the group. I have 
been disappointed at the amount of flame traffic going on lately (although I 
should have known this would happen), and have even been thinking of closing it 
down if things do not improve. But now that I've seen this measure of support 
from you, I will keep it open. I look forward to seeing posts from your readers

called here and it no longer exists.  I tried to go find it, but it's
gone.

Greetings..

Another new subscriber!  Glad to be here..

A quick rundown on who I am..the computer sys admin at a small
manufacturing firm in one of Milwaukee's northwestern suburbs;
previously a programmer/consultant at the University of Wisconsin-
Milwaukee.

I quit smoking cigarettes around 6 years ago and I'm glad I did.
Since then I have an occasional cigar, usually something *real*
cheap.  I dabbled a bit in smoking a pipe, but at the time, never
had much peace of mind at home to spend the time to do it right
(I'm divorced now, thank goodness :) ).  Also tried the "pinch
between cheek and gum" approach to using tobacco - but it gave 
me nasty hiccups. 

This past June I spent two weeks vacationing in the Florida Keys,
and while visiting Key West stumbled (literally) into the Key
West Cigar Factory.  What the hell, I'll buy a couple..well,
they were so fresh and such a joy to smoke that I bought a few
more, asking for "the freshest, longest and fattest you have my 
friend".

I settled into a 1 cigar-a-day pattern and started reading CA (I'm
a wine collector so I was already curious from reading about CA
in the Wine Spectator).  There are a couple of places in Milwaukee
which have a good selection of cigars.  Unfortunately, they're a
long way from where I live (across town).  It turns out that one
of the tobacconists, Uhle's, distribute to grocery and drug
stores, of which, one is 5 minutes from my home so I'm able to find
nearly everything I need there.  

But when I happen to be on the east side of town, I always stop in at 
Edward's, a very nice shop (mentioned previously in Digest #110 or #111) 
since they stock Fuente Hemingways which my nearby drug store does not.

My favorite cigars?

Fuente is the producer that I've been most impressed with for being
consistently good and reasonably priced.  I've tried quite a number
of different styles and have enjoyed them all.  Their 8-5-8 is my
usual day-to-day cigar with the larger Hemingway being my favorite
cigar, hands-down. 

I like Hoya de Monterey Excalibers, and Ashton Churchills are always a
delight.  Partegas are pretty good, but I've had a couple that were
nasty.  Macanudo (sp?) are ok, but I've had a few where the draw was
tough as nails.  Dunno if my snipping technique is flawed or the cigar
was wound up too tight.  An 8 1/2" Punch Churchill is a great wake-me-
upper - what a blast.

Recently, I've been trying H. Uppman's and have been favorably impressed.
Also waiting anxiously for the 12 Churchills that are being shipped
to me.  In the September 20 (or thereabouts) issue of the Wine Spectator,
H. Uppman had what sounded like a great promotional offer: 12 Churchills
in a nice case for $10.  Well, they've cashed the check according to my
bank statement, so they should be here any day now - heh, heh, heh. 

Have never had the opportunity to try Cohibas, Cuban Uppman's, 
Montechristo's, or any of the other Cuban cigars.  It's not keeping
me up nights, so...

Ok, I guess I've droned on enough.  

regards,

-mm

Hi everyone!

I'm lucky enough to live near a fine tobacco shop in State College, PA
called Tobacco Tavern.  They cook up some very fine flavors here, let me
tell you!  Also available is a large selection of pipes.  Cigars and fine
cigarettes are also sold.  In the 10 or so years since I've been smoking a
pipe, my favorite it my Jefapip with my Hilson Fantasia coming in close
behind.  I think the two are totally different because the Jefapip is French
and Briar; it's fairly light to hold with the teeth, too.  The Hilson, on
the other hand, is meerschaum lined and very heavy.  Too heavy for the
teeth!  So it sits on my desk a lot.

My favorite tabacs are Tobacco Tavern's Blackberry Brandy (!), Vanilla,
Smoker's Delight, Olde Cherry, and Sugar and Spice.  Call or write Tobacco
Tavern; they mail stuff out daily, I think.  814-237-8252 or 256 Calder Way,
State College, PA 16801.

May your lighter always work,

Scottie

<a name="13">Subject: Re:  Invitation to join the Pipes Mailgroup</a>

	
Hello, Steve, thanks for putting me on the mailing list.  I've been
smoking pipes for about twelve years, and I've been smoking the odd
cigar since I joined the army (troops apparently don't take kindly
to officers who smoke pipes -- they think it's stuck-up, so the pipe
smokers in the mess smoke cigarettes or cigars around the troops).
Because tobacco taxes are so high in Canada (over 50%) I buy most
of my tobacco products in the States or in duty-free, which is why
I talk about buying stuff in so many different places.  The shops
I refer to are all about one day's drive from the border along
various major interstate highways.
	
	For starters, why not take a few minutes and tell us
	about yourself by return mail? We'd like to hear about your
	preferences in 

	pipes, 

Right now, I'm chewing on a graceful little hook made by Connaisseur
in New York.  Beautiful briar, great shape, draws poorly.  My two 
favourites are a Canadian made by Charatan, and a hook by Ben Wade.
I also have, somewhere, a late '60's Dunhill, very slender and unlike
their later stuff, that I slide into my hosetop right beside my
sgian dubh for formal Scottish events.

I do a lot of historical re-creation, and I smoke clays there.  My
favourite was bought at Plimoth Plantation; but it went the way of
all clays.  I still have the pieces somewhere...

	tobacco, 

I'm an English fan.  I smoke Balkan Sobranie by preference, Dunhill's
standard mild as well.  I can also reccommend Scott Ziegler of 
Kalamazoo Michigan, who makes a Sobranie knockoff called Balkan Shag,
which isn't shag, but is very nice.  Right now I am working on a kilo
of medium English I bought at Tobaccoland in Mill Creek Mall, Erie,
Pennsylvania, two years ago and lost.  I found it a couple of months
ago, still in ziplocs and only a little bit dried out.  A bit of 
water from a spray bottle, and it's nearly good as new.  

Recently, while making a connection through Copenhagen airport (which
has a great Peterman shop) a stunning young lady sold me a tin of 
Danish stuff (which I hate), but ... well ... she was just so pretty.
And she gave me a nice little Tokai pipe lighter and a pipe tool;
so I can recommend Denmark highly for one thing.

	shops, 

I mentioned Ziegler's in Kalamazoo, and Tobaccoland in Erie.  There's
also Briar Route in Rochester (Marketplace Mall), which has sadly 
gone way downhill; and my favourite of all time, Continental on 
Murray Ave. in Pittsburgh.  Ivan, the owner, is very good at blending
his own knockoffs of name brands, and customising them to individual
customers.  I owe him some Cuban cigars next time I'm down there.
In Toronto there's Havana House, which is great for cigars, but no
longer very good for pipe tobacco or pipes; and Winston and Holmes,
which is too expensive.

If you ever have time and money, the basement of the Royal York Hotel
in Toronto is home to Julius Vesz, who makes gorgeous pipes.  His
address there is 100 Front St. W., Toronto.

Cheers,

Aryk Nusbacher

and appreciation of fine tobacco, including cigars, pipes, quality
cigarettes, pipe making and carving, snuff, collectible tobacciana,
publications, and related topics. The mailgroup is lightly moderated
to prevent flame (except for the purpose of lighting up. :-)"

As one of the first to post cigar-related material to this list, I
must say, I don't see the need.  Unlike some fora I could name,
no one here as ever made me feel unwelcome for being so eccentric
as to actually prefer cigars.  While the name doesn't explicitly
say so, the ambience here is definitely tolerant and accepting,
and new subscribers never seem to be long in seeing that the subject
is really fine tobaccos, whatever the form.

&gt;[ Any thoughts on this? -S. ]

Vulcanite (hard rubber) mouthpieces discolour from of the sulpher,
used as an anti-oxidant, leaching to the surface.  It is possible to
polish it off, using successively finer buffing compounds and a good,
soft buffing wheel, but the potential for rounding off the sharp edges
is great.  Better is to use 400 and 600 grit wet-or-dry paper to get 
the stem clean, taking off as little material as necessary, and then 
use the wheel for final buffing, being cautious not to damage the edges.

For the past couple of years, I have been using household bleach for this 
task.  This is only advisable on some stems, as dicussed later.  The bleach 
restores the colour, but leaves the surface quite rouch, so requiring 
polishing.  Again, a wheel with very fine compound is the best tool.  
(I don't have the patience to use the Dunhill mouthpiece polish for this!)

Dunhill stems respond very well to the bleach, as do many old stems.  I
have found, howver, that Saseini dots tend to dissolve, and the cement
which adheres GBD and (old) BBB logos will not stand the test of bleach,
and the older Comoy "C", which is actually made from white and black rod-
stock, doesn't take kindly to the process, either.  Obviously, painted 
logos and insigniae (later Comoy, Charatan, Stanwell, &amp;c) should be kept
away from the bleach.  For all stems apart from Dunhill, I simply stand 
them upright in the bleach with the logo out of harm's (bleach's ;) way!
Overnight, they turn dull black and are ready for the final polish.  THe
bleach also has the advantage of removing any built up residues inside the
stem!

The best treatment is prevention.  Keep your pipes out of the light as
much as possible, and use a good polish, like the Dunhill, frequently.
If your body chemistry is particularly acidic, you'll have to try to 
keep the mouthpieces dry as well.  I find that making a good stem rubdown
with a paper towel part of my apre' smoke cleaning ritual, I can, for the
most part, avoid the oxidation before it becomes problem.  

Cheers,
Gregory

Hi, Steve:

Why not call it the Pipes and Cigars Digest?

Also, I have two questions:

-- Does anyone know if the United States is the only nation with a ban on
Cuban cigars?  I understand you can legally buy them in Canada.  Is it
then illegal to bring them back into the U.S.?  Is it illegal for a
Canadian business to send Cuban cigars to individuals in the U.S.?

-- Could the gentleman who mentioned the $10 offer for Churchills give
us the address and other details so we can take advantage of this?  :)

must _want_ you to bring them back... Also, re the name change, I

Hi Steve. 

Let me introduce myself. My name is Henry Lai and despite my
email address, I live in Montreal, not San Diego. I am basically
a cigarette smoker but I occassionally indulge in cigars. I have
never tried a pipe, though my father and grandfather both used to
smoke pipes so I've very accustomed to the aroma. I'm not a connisseur
of cigars and know very little about them except what I like. The ones
I like most were made by Uppman, though I don't recall what the exact
cigar was. I had a Davidoff cigar about ten years ago that I really
enjoyed (...and enjoyed, it lasted quite a while). Again, I don't recall what
cigar, except that it was very long, about 10-12" (perhaps called the
"Imperial" or something like that???).

I get the impression that cigarette smoking is somewhat of a taboo subject
here and a no-no for pipe afficiandos.

Steve- I would love to have whatever back issues of the pipe digest you
can forward- yes, all of them if possible!

Now, my self-introduction ( I assume that you are cutting and pasting on
this for the digest.)

I'm delighted to join the list, which I would never have found out about had
it not been for the ill-fated attempt to establish the new tobacco list on
usenet.  I started out as a pipe smoker, although in recent years I have
tended to smoke cigars more than pipes.  I would never give up any of my
little wooden prizes, however.  I'm sure that others on the list share my
consternation about the impending enormous tax hikes.  My advice is stock
up now- under the right conditions, both smoking tobacco and cigars will
keep for a long time.

Personal preferences- for pipe tobacco, blends that either play down or
avoid the strong latakias, and NO fruit flavored syrupy additives thank
you!  The McClelland blends are about the best packaged blends I have
found produced in this country.

As for cigars, I have tried most everything except for some of the rare
pre-revolution cubans allegedly squirreled away by the greatest of
afficianados.  From my purchases in Europe, I must contend that
even present day cuban brands are superior to anything else, even if they
are sometimes rolled miserably.  Personally, I would put a large Cuban
Montecristo up against anything.  Since we can't get them in the U.S., I
would suggest that fanciers consider the product coming out of the Canary
Islands.  Sure, it is terribly uneven, but overall these cigars have
gotten a bad rap.  They are somewhat tame for inveterate cuban or honduras
fans, but have a subtlety lacking in most brands available in the U.S. 
The Dunhills produced in the Canary Islands (If you can find them) are
excellent.

American Science &amp; Surplus is selling Carve Your Own Pipe Kits
(#10635) in their October 1993 catalog for $4.75 each.  We have
purchased kits from them before, and they are of moderate quality.
The kit includes a block of Corsican briar 1.5" x 1.5 " x 1.75" with
about a 1 1/16" bowl that tapers to the hole on the bottom.  This
hole leads outside where a 5.5" black vulcanite stem may be inserted.
Be aware that this stem is inserted directly into the pipe w/o space
between the newly carved heel and the joint for the mouthpiece.  It
just makes the bowl seem even larger when stuck to the straw-like
mouthpiece.  The article also warns that some of these square edges
may have been beveled off.  I didn't want to invest in an expensive
pipe carving kit until my wife (the family carver) saw that it was
something she could do.  (Her comment was that she never realized
briar was really that hard, and she wanted to know if her church-
wardens were made of the same kind of rock.)  ASci&amp;Surp (watch the
abrev.) can be reached by mail or in person at 3605 Howard Street in
Skokie, IL 60076; by phone at (708) 982-0870; or FAX (800) 934-0722.
They have a $10 minimum order and will accept MC, Visa, Money Order,
Checks, and quantities of unique toys, gizzmos, and young children.
They buy a fixed quantity so supply is not guarenteed.

       &gt;I have a question for the membership...Even though I've been smoking
       &gt;and collecting pipes for twenty years I have'nt figured out a 
       &gt;satisfactory way to clean and polish mouthpieces.  I have tried
       &gt;Dunhill mouthpiece polish and often it means I have shiny but still 
       &gt;discolored stems.  I was thinking about trying siome automotive type
       &gt;rubbing compound.  I would appreciate any suggestions or advice.
       &gt;???????@???????.?????.??? 717 291-3843  Thanks

When I worked in the trade (Wally Frank shop in Paramus, NJ in the late '70's)
we had a double buffing wheel set up in the shop which we used to polish
bakelite stems. We used Cannuba (sp?) wax on one wheel and kept the other clean
to buff with. This wax is similar to jeweler's rouge in that it is a mild
abrasive like rubbing compound. I found that some discoloration could be
removed with this set-up but severe cases would retain that olive drab tone
after the best workout. I also found that the stems which were allowed to
oxidize the most were the hardest to keep polished. There must be some
cascading effect on the breakdown of the stem material.

Moral: keep those stems well polished. Once they start to get a crystalline
appearance they will need to be replaced because they won't retain their retain
their color or finish any longer.

Greetings Steve and Group, 

I'm a system software specialist at the University of Pittsburgh.  
I quit smoking cig's back in 1975.  I'll ocasionally smoke a "good"
cigar, but haven't really settled into any discernable pattern.  
The world is still my oyster when it comes to choice, except for
Cuban :^).  I've noticed that Fuente is one brand that keeps being
mentioned on the list.  Interestingly, this was the first brand in-
troduced to me.  The tobacconist offered it as a good mild cigar.
For an all tobacco smoke, the $0.75 Fuente "throw-aways" are a great
buy.  Although these are mixed short and long cut filler I've never
had a bad one.  If I've got the time then I'll light up and savor a 
Dunhill.  

Does anyone have any tips on making your own (cigar) humidor?  I'd
like to build my own, cedar lined, of course.  Any info is helpful.

Unfortunately, not everyone can receive the Usenet alt.smokers news-
group.  There are some very interesting threads of conversation there.
BTW, how soon will rec.tobacco have another chance at creation? 

If any readers in the Pittsburgh area have the time, I recommend a 
visit to Jernigan's Tobacco Village in the South Hills Village Mall. 
Stop by and see Rich for some interesting conversation and a few 
great smokes.  They carry a complete line of accessories and have a
walk-in humidor.  Ahhh, the aroma...

&gt; We'd like to hear from you, and hope you'll help us to keep the
&gt; mailgroup going. For starters, why not take a few minutes and tell us
&gt; about yourself by return mail?

Surely.  I enjoyed the latest edition you sent me, and I hope that the
volume does not become so much that I can't handle it.  It's not like
I have a whole lot of spare time for yet another mailing list/newsgroup.

To my surprise, I find yet another list/group I share with this fellow ...
&gt; Bill Thacker             AT&amp;T Network Systems       attmail!att!cbemf!wbt
Considering his company will soon own my company, I should drop him a
line.

I'm 30-something, and have been smoking since I was 21, when a friend
who was a clerk at a smoke shop brought me a few free samples, cut some
of them open, and explained to me the nuances of different cigars, and
what differentiates a good cigar from a bad one.  Since that time, I've
been a regular cigar smoker, an occasional pipe smoker, and a cigarette
smoker at work.

I generally smoke one Romeo&amp;Julieta a day, in the evening after dinner
along with a suitable beverage.  I'll occasionally smoke Dunhill Juniors,
as well.  For social situations where a larger cigar is not appropriate,
but I still want to enjoy a good smoke, I'll bring along a tin of
Danneman Imperials, a cigarillo.  They have the added advantage of being
a dry cigar, not requiring humidor-storage.  Perhaps someone can explain
that to me, as I never understood it.

I order cigars (by phone) from the following shop in Scottsdale, AZ :

Ford &amp; Haig Tobacconist
7076 E. 5th Ave
Scottsdale, Arizona
(602)-946-0608

I enjoy browsing through the humidor, but unfortunately this shop is
many miles from my house, and I've seen the cigar shops in this city
gradually close down over the last several years, so I think this is
the only 'full featured' tobacco shop left in the county.  I'm open
to trying new cigars, and perhaps this list will give me some ideas.
But so far, I haven't found any better combination of flavor and price
than the Romeo's.

Greetings!

First of all I'd like to thank you for the invitation to join this mail
list.  While I am NOT a cigarette smoker, I do enjoy the occasional cigar.
And this seems like a great way to learn about the wide variety.  I am
more interested in personal reviews, hence I don't get C.A.

Since I only smoke a few dozen per year, I am really interested in the
top quality cigars.  Also, I prefer "Churchill" size.  Hey, I'm a big
guy and it fits well.  So I'm looking forward to trying the Arturo Fuente
Hemingway this week.

The vast majority of my cigar smoking is on the golf course.  I'm always
aware of the wind direction.  It provides a distraction so that I don't
"over-think" about the game.  And it's a superior method of bug repellant,
certainly more pleasure than spraying DEET on my face!

But the problem I have is: What kind of lighter can be tossed around in
the bag (all orientations) and not leak, yet be reliable in breezy or even
down-right windy conditions?

Dear Steve and others in the group,

yes, I'd be happy to join the mailgroup.

To present myself, I'm a 25 year old mathematician from Denmark, just
about to finish my PhD in Tokyo, Japan. My life as a pipesmoker began
in highschool when I was 16. In Denmark, it is not unusual at all to
smoke (pipe) at that age, and to tell the truth I never had anything
but pleasure from smoking until I stayed in the USA for six months
last year. To me as a foreigner, all this antismoking hysteria seems
a little out of proportion with the problems I thought to see in the
american society. - As a contrast, here in Japan, you can smoke just
about anywhere, but pipe tobacco is hard to find and very expensive.
	
I'd like to ask a question to all you experienced pipe smokers. Any
hints on how to avoid swallowing (small amounts of) acid due to humid
pipe smoke? I don't think this is linked to be tobacco brand, since
all fresh tobacco contain a certain amount of humidity, but maybe to 
the pipe?

					Best regards, 
					Carl Winsl\ow.

The alt.smokers postings are generating quite a bit of interest!
However, we still got mailer problems with some of our Bitnet members.
If there's someone who knows whether the cunyvm.cuny.edu gateway or
Bitnet itself has changed in the last month or so, could you please
drop me a note?

For our U.S. members, here's wishing you a happy Thanksgiving, and
remember not to drop your tobak in the turkey!  And, after dinner's
done and the dishes are clean, why not retire to the smoking room,
light up, and sort through the mail...

info on H. Uppman's cigar offer.  I've also gotten some mail regarding
this offer.  I must apologize for not posting the info; takes time to
hone that "netsense"  :)

Here's the facts:
$10 gets you 12 Churchills in a nice (plastic) case.  I have gotten
them and I'm quite impressed with their freshness, decent draw, and
taste. 

Here's the address:

Allow 6-8 weeks for delivery..

CUBAN CIGARS

&gt; Does anyone know if the United States is the only nation with a ban on
&gt; Cuban cigars? 

I believe so.

&gt; I understand you can legally buy them in Canada.  Is it
&gt; then illegal to bring them back into the U.S.? 

Yes.  The importation of any Cuban products/services into the U.S.
via any means is strictly forbidden, as is the export of products
from the U.S. to Cuba, via any route.

&gt; Is it illegal for a
&gt; Canadian business to send Cuban cigars to individuals in the U.S.?

Yes.

Cuban cigars in Canadian duty-free shops are intended to be taken out
of Cuba, but not into the U.S.  However, with the Cold War ending and
with recent and impending events in Cuba, I do not expect this ban to
last into the next century.  I look forward to the day when I will be
able to sample Cuban cigars.  In my semi-frequent trips to Mexico, I
have been unable to find any.  I'm sure I'm just going to the wrong
places (tourist areas), so if anyone has any tips on where Cubans can
be had in the more popular Mexican destinations, please let me know!

TAXES/STOCKPILING

Unlike wine or scotch, I have not found that cigars store well for
any period of time.  Someone mentioned, though, that under the 
proper conditions they can last quite a while.  Short of building
my own fully-enclosed hermetically-sealed walk-in humidor, what 
conditions will keep a cigar fresh for more than a month?  It had
been my impression that all tobacco products were best used fresh.

I question the value of stockpiling tobacco products to avoid
taxes anyway.  I don't think the per-unit taxes on cigars or pipe
tobaccos are going to go up much; does anyone have actual figures?
Even the 75c tax on a pack of cigarettes (watered down from the
originally proposed $2) is in jeopardy, as Clinton may cut a deal
with congressmen from tobacco-growing states to get votes on NAFTA.

<a name="4">Subject: Re: Moderated mailgroup for cigars, pipes, fine tobacco</a>

Sirs:

     Thank you for putting me on your list.  I originally got on to
alt.smokers because I wanted to hear how other people rated different
cigars.  It seems that 75% of the posts to alt.smokers are pro/con
flames on the act of smoking itself.  I just want posts of new
cigar/pipe/tobac. accessories.

     Now that you are going to post a moderated pipe mailgroup, I
would like to know how pipe tobacco is processed.  In the past 2 years
I have learned what it takes to process cigar tobacco.  This would
greatly expand my knowledge.  Also I want to know about the quality of
the mega expensive pipes like Charatan, Davidoff, and Duhill.

     At my fraternity in West Lafayette, Indiana we sit around at the
Midwest Farm Management Center and debate the finer points of pipe
tobacco smoked in briar vs corn cob pipes.  We now have a private
stock of cigars in a humidor at the center.  Someday some of the
fraternity brothers are going to take some Southern Indiana tobacco
and try to make it into long filler cigars, the way the Dominicans do
it.

     Once again, thanks for the post.  Please direct the posts to:

[ I'd recommend a trip to your favorite (well-stocked) library to
check out Carl Ehwa's _The Book of Pipes and Tobacco._ It has one of
the most comprehensive sections on pipe tobacco I've seen. And, IMHO,
improvements in pipe quality level off fairly rapidly with price above
$100. (Your mileage may vary.) Thanks for the note, and welcome!  -S. ]

To my fellow tobacco affectionados:

A very close friend once gave me a lighter which he had treasured for
many years.  I used it for several years and then gave it to a friend
to enjoy.  It was unfortunately lost several years later.  Although
that particular lighter has sentimental value to myself and my two
friends, I was wondering if it is still availble to purchase.  Perhaps
you can help me locate one...or three.

It is a Calibri (I think that's how it's spelled) flip top butane
model with a red light that comes on when you pop the lid.  If you
break the beam of light it ignites.  The case was gold with turtoise
inlays.  Like other lighters from the Calibri company, it was good
quality.  It is this particular model I'm interested in.  If other
finishes were made, I would be interested in them as well.  Thanks in
advance.

[ OK, Scottie! You might also want to check Levin Pipes, from the
Resource Guide, which occasionally has lighters. -S. ]

Hi,

My name is Kam Kashani, and I'm a technical writer working for Silicon
Graphics. I live in Santa Cruz, CA and commute to Mountain View, CA
(about 45 miles, one-way), so I visit tobacco stores from Santa Cruz
to Redwood City.

I am a cigar smoker migrating to a pipe. It's amazing how much less
expensive a good pipe smoke is than a comparable cigar ;-) The only
problem I'm having with the pipe is finding out what all the tobacco
varieties are and how they contribute to aroma and taste.

Can anyone recommend a good book on the subject of tobacco in general,
or on pipe tobacco in particular?  It would be nice to have a
reference to varieties, where in the world they are grown, curing
techniques, and so forth.

Thanks,

<a name="2">Subject: Cigars and getting sick</a>

First off, let me say that I love this mailing list.  I was
disappointed that the tobacco group didn't pass (next time, though).
Now for my problem.  A few weeks ago, I sat down with a book and a Te
Amo Meditation.  After about an hour, I had finished the cigar and
went to go do some school work.  When I got up, I felt as if I were
drunk (physically, not mentally).  I thought this was a bad sign so I
[went?] to go lay down.  While on myway to the bedroom, I felt very
ill and went into the bathroom and threw up.  Has this happened to
anyone else (or is it just me)?  This is the first time it has
happened to me and has made me somewhat hesitant to smoke again.  Any
help would be appreciated.  Thanks

Jeff

[Sounds like you might have swallowed a bit of cigar juice, Jeff! My
advice is to try to keep your mouth dry and avoid chewing on your
cigar. Any other comments? -S.]

I had posted this to alt.smokers and forgotten to also send it to the
Pipes group... (Is everyone else getting as annoyed as I am about the
content of that group? Steve, I've got to admit that you were 100% right
about rec.tobacco being moderated.)

I finally got to try a famous Cohiba Robusto, the so-called benchmark
for the Robusto size. For the money ($20 each), I was a disappointed:
construction was uneven, with soft spots along the cigar. It was
certainly a powerful smoke (this was, afterall, a Cuban cigar), but not
particularly distinctive. I certainly didn't get any "chocolate" flavors
as were mentioned in CA, but did get rather intense leather and spice.
Don't get me wrong: if this had been a $3 (or $5) Dominican Republic
cigar I would have been blown away, but I expected more from a Cuban.
(See my previous smoke report of the fantastic Romeo &amp; Julietta
Churchills!)

&gt;Unlike wine or scotch, I have not found that cigars store well for
&gt;any period of time.  Someone mentioned, though, that under the 
&gt;proper conditions they can last quite a while.  Short of building
&gt;my own fully-enclosed hermetically-sealed walk-in humidor, what 
&gt;conditions will keep a cigar fresh for more than a month?  It had
&gt;been my impression that all tobacco products were best used fresh.

Cigars and pipe-tobacco age beautifully, but must be kept under proper
conditions; for cigars, this is at a temperature of about 70F and a
relative humidity of about 68%.  One of the finest smokes I've ever 
had was a pre-embargo Bolivar!  Another cigar of note was a Royal
Jamaica Park Lane, which had been carefully aged for 11 years.  I can
still almost taste that beauty...and the aroma!  Sublime!

Unless you have purchased a cigar from the chap who rolled it, you have
likely never had a "fresh" cigar.  Cigars are rolled quite wet, and after 
manufacture, they must be aged for a minimum of 6 weeks to allow the 
moisture level to come down to the correct level for smoking, and to 
allow the flavours of the various tobaccos in the blend to "marry."  
A truly "fresh" ("green" in the trade) cigar can be quite dreadful.  
Though some rollers know how to make a "green" cigar that can taste 
quite good, these are not the cigars you would buy by the box.  A friend
who represents one of the major Dominican manufacturers once brought me
a few "green" cigars of a quality brand I routinely smoke.  They were
HORRID!  Harsh, difficult to draw, and just plain nasty.  I put the rest
away for a few weeks, and voila!  

&gt;From the time a cigar is normally purchased, assuming good inventory
turnover at the retailer, it will undergo its most significant change 
in the first 8-15 months, going through a sort of "growing pain" period 
at somewhere between 6 and 10 months, and then mellowing.  After a couple 
of years, the change is much more gradual.  The spice of some tobaccos 
becomes more tightly integrated with the other flavours, and the overall 
complexity increases, though the cigars often become more subtle.  Cigars
with darker wrappers, as a rule of thumb, age better than cigars with 
claro wrappers, as do cigars with more oily wrappers.  In order for them
to age well, they should be removed from their cello sleeves, and packed
loosely in cedar boxes, and kept in the proper temperature/humidity.

***

I have built a most cost-effective humidor.  Some years ago, my mum was
getting rid of her old freezer, which had been out of sorts.  When I
discovered that the cost of parts to repair was nearly that of a new
freezer, I opted to put it to *better* use!  A few cedar sheets from the
inside of cigar boxes, a small hygrometer and a sponge allowed me to 
convert a scrap into a first-rate humidor!  Each time I go for a cigar,
I am rewarded by a magnificent aroma, and the joy of knowing that I 
can smoke any one of a variety of cigars, at any one of a variety of
ages!  I now can have the "right" cigar available for almost any occasion!

***

As an aside, my favourite pipe tobacco hasn't even been made for over
twenty years.  I was able to acquire about 100 tins of it when the shop
which had it commissioned went out of business.  (I was barely out of
diapers when this stuff was made!)  Anyone with whom I have shared this
delight has commenced aging their tobaccos!  Virginias and Turkish
tobaccos age gracefully.  Latakia loses some of its piquancy, but develops
a richness that is indescribable!

Cuban cigars are still unequalled.  Though there are excellent cigars
made in the Dominican Republic, the Honduras, the Canary Islands and
even Miami, *nothing* tastes like a Cuban cigar!  The quality largely
depends upon which factory they come from; even a Montecristo isn't 
always a Montecristo, as they come out of several different factories!
The best ones are shipped to the markets which the Cuban government deems
most worthy, so you can always find the best ones in Switzerland and Spain.
&gt;From other markets, they are quite inconsistent.  It really is sad that
politics and pleasure are so inextricably linked when it comes to cigars!

I`ve had some unbelieveable Montecristos, Romeo &amp; Juliettas, H. Upmanns,
Cohibas and Hoyo de Monterreys lately; as good as ever.  It all depends 
uoon where they were made (which factory) and how they were stored.

Happy smoking!

[ Thanks, Gregory! BTW, your message got me interested in how to build
a cost-effective humidor. The fridge seems like a novel idea, though
I'm sure that a one could build a more elegant one... perhaps a
veteran woodsmith could provide a reference to a plan?  (Or, as Norm
Abram says, a "measured drawring and a materials list" :-)

BTW, I think one could make a very inexpensive humidor for a few
cigars or just a little tobak, from a Rubbermaid or similar box, a
sponge-type humidifier, and a hygrometer. The hygrometer is available
from:

		Edmund Scientific
		101 E. Gloucester Pike 			
		Barrington NJ 08007-1380
		609-573-6250 		(orders)
		609-573-6858/6859 	(catalog requests)

I've ordered their catalog and will probably try this in the near
future. If anyone else has built their own humidor, please write in! -S. ]

A few comments on digest 118:	
	
	Yes.  The importation of any Cuban products/services into the U.S.
	via any means is strictly forbidden, as is the export of products
	from the U.S. to Cuba, via any route.
	
I, as a Canadian, can bring Cuban cigars into the United States for my
own personal use.  It is only illegal if I sell them or give them to
somebody else.  That's why they sell them in the Duty Free.
	
	     Now that you are going to post a moderated pipe mailgroup, I
	would like to know how pipe tobacco is processed.  

According to my old tobacconist in Pittsburgh (Ivan at Continental), 
Latakia is processed over fires of dried camel dung.  Any tobacco
experts out there care to comment?

	Also I want to know about the quality of
	the mega expensive pipes like Charatan, Davidoff, and Duhill.

I am told that the only difference between a $100 GBD and a $300
Dunhill is the label:  they come from the same factory.  I have 
seen some recent Dunhills that make my flesh crawl _before_ looking
at the price tag.  It's not like the old days, when Dunhill pipes
were notably light and graceful right down to the bottom of the 
line.

Charatan makes some excellent pipes that are realtively inexpensive.
Right now I'm smoking a Charatan (3102DC) for which I paid C$60 on
sale.  Not in the same league as Dunhill (which, last time I was in
their New York blazer shoppe and pipe showroom, started at $250 for
a cheesy clunker).  Buying a pipe from an excellent cigar roller
like Davidoff seems pointless.

If you're going to blow lots of oof on a pipe, you might consider
a decent Stanwell, Comoy, Ben Wade or Charatan -- you could buy two
for the price of one Dunhill dental appliance.

	...  Someday some of the
	fraternity brothers are going to take some Southern Indiana tobacco
	and try to make it into long filler cigars, the way the Dominicans do
	it.
	
This weekend past, I had the opportunity to pull some Virginia leaf
off of a drying rack, rub it up, and smoke it; both in a clay pipe
and in my big Ben Wade.  It was really quite nice -- I might start 
keeping some plain Virginia around the apartment to match the plain
Latakia I occasionally buy for outdoors smoking.

Later,

Aryk Nusbacher

[ Plain Latakia? You're a stronger man than I am, Aryk! :-) And thanks
for the info on Dunhill vs. GBD; I agree that Dunhills aren't really
worth the price difference. -S. ]

&gt; 
While I've heard the same thing, I'd say that the quality of Cuban
cigars is inconsistant. I have had _3_ different Cuban cigars over the
last few weeks (a little bragging here :) and of those, one was
absolutely fantastic (Romeo &amp; Julietta Churchill), one was better than
any non-Cuban I've ever had (La Flor del Fino Short Churchill; actually
a Robusto size), and one was good but disappointing given it's
reputation (Cohiba Robusto). I've had other Cubans over the last year
that were strong/harsh, but not particularly interesting: Partagas
(Corona size?), Montecristo (Corona size?). I have tried a handfull of
others, but those were before I had smoked a wide enough variety to know
what my tastes are. If you're inclined to spend alot of money you can
buy pre-embargo and even pre-Castro Cubans. CA had a fascinating article
on this subject in the last issue. From what I could gather, these
cigars go for $50+ each. A friend went to an auction recently and bought
one for $120 and smoked it immediately; He said it was the best cigar
he's ever had.

&gt; 	Yes.  The importation of any Cuban products/services into the U.S.
&gt; 	via any means is strictly forbidden, as is the export of products
&gt; 	from the U.S. to Cuba, via any route.

There's an exception: You can bring in a limited amount (I believe it's
the standard amount allowed for personal use) if you're returning from Cuba.

Unfortunately, you can't legally have _been_ in Cuba without the permission
of the US government.

If you happen to be among (or know) the rare legal visitors, the custom's
service publishes a brochure with all the details, most travel agents and
international airlines have copies.

&gt; I, as a Canadian, can bring Cuban cigars into the United States for my

Dung is a traditional fuel throughout most of the world. I've read that
it's over a fire of herbs; I much prefer to believe that :-)

&gt;Latakia is processed over fires of dried camel dung.  Any tobacco
&gt;experts out there care to comment?

Latakia was "discovered" when a bumper crop resulted in surplus,
and the excess tobacco was stored in the rafters.  The  village farmers
traditionally used camel dung (or other dung, I suspect) as a source 
of fuel, and the smoke cured tobacco was revealed the following season.  
Today, Latakia is smoked over a smouldering fire of aromatic herbs.  The
camel no longer has to process the herbs first!

&gt;	Also I want to know about the quality of
&gt;	the mega expensive pipes like Charatan, Davidoff, and Duhill.
&gt;
&gt;I am told that the only difference between a $100 GBD and a $300
&gt;Dunhill is the label:  they come from the same factory.  

Dunhill and GBD are *not* made in the same factory.  GBDs and Comoys
are both made in France, where they actually have quite a strong
tradition.  Dunhills are still made in England by Dunhill.  Many of the 
GBD and Comoy pipes  are stemmed and finished in England, last I knew, 
but the bowls are turned in St. Claude.

There have been times in Dunhill's history when bowls were purchased and
then cured, stemmed and finshed.  This practise has not been done in decades.
The Dunhill curing process is what makes the Dunhill pipes distinctive.
When William Ashton Taylor left Dunhill's employ to establish the Ashton
factory, he cured his pipes using very similar methods.  Ashtons are now
cured differently, and no longer taste like Dunhills.  I believe there
was a bit of trouble with Dunhill's ownership of the patents, even though
Mr. Taylor originated some of the methods...

&gt;I have 
&gt;seen some recent Dunhills that make my flesh crawl _before_ looking
&gt;at the price tag.  It's not like the old days, when Dunhill pipes
&gt;were notably light and graceful right down to the bottom of the 
&gt;line.

The "old days" are a much lauded myth.  Dunhill pipes are no better or
no worse today than ever, but the poor quality ones of olde have long
since been discarded, while the better ones have been cherished.  Dunhill
has had some periods during which certain models were not up to scratch,
but overall, they have retained their traditional curing and manufacturing
methods despite increasing costs of doing so.  The same can not be said of 
Comoy, GBD, Saseini, Barling, BBB, Charatan (now made in France and imported 
by J. B. Russell), all of which made wonderful pipes at one time, and all of
which make an inferior product today.  I have a significant number of
Dunhills in my collection, made between 1912 and 1986.  They are all 
superb smoking pipes.  I have had poor quality, heavy, flavourless Dunhills
from the 1980's *and* from the 1930's.  The most beautiful pipe set
I have ever seen is a set of Dunhill Shells, group 1 through ODA in a 
straight billiard shape.  Each pipe is sxtraordinary, and the impact
of all seven pipes, presented in a beautifully crafted chest is
breathtaking. 

I'm not defending Dunhill prices; I think they are ridiculous, but
everything has its perspective.  I have to applaud Dunhill for retaining
traditional methods and materials.  (They don't make movies like they
did in the good old days, either.  Or cars.  Remember the Edsel?)

&gt;Charatan makes some excellent pipes that are realtively inexpensive.
&gt;Right now I'm smoking a Charatan (3102DC) for which I paid C$60 on
&gt;sale.  Not in the same league as Dunhill (which, last time I was in
&gt;their New York blazer shoppe and pipe showroom, started at $250 for
&gt;a cheesy clunker).  Buying a pipe from an excellent cigar roller
&gt;like Davidoff seems pointless.
&gt;
&gt;If you're going to blow lots of oof on a pipe, you might consider
&gt;a decent Stanwell, Comoy, Ben Wade or Charatan -- you could buy two
&gt;for the price of one Dunhill dental appliance.

As I mentioned, Charatan is not the pipe it once was.  Really.  They
were once independent, then Lane Limited (the same chaps who own Dunhill)
bought them.  About a year or two ago, the rights to the name and shape
chart were purchased by James B. Russell, and the pipes are now made
in St. Claude, France.  I've had great pipes from St. Claude, so this 
might not be all bad, but the Charatans I have seen lately have been
piss-poor counterfeits of the "real" ones.  

GBD and Comoy are now one and the same.  The only difference between 
the pipes is the finishing and the logo.  Barling has been a different
product since the father/son transition in the (i think) 1960s.  Ditto
Saseini. 

For reasonable prices, Peterson makes a nice smoking, though not always
pretty pipe.  Because of a glut on the market, Castellos can be had for
a decent price (relative to Dunhill!), and the lesser priced Larsens
are a real bargain.  The upscale Danish pipes are truly wonderful, and
some of the less know Italian marques are worth searching out; Fiamma
di Rey, Mastro de Paja, il Ceppo, Ser Jacopo and Grenci come to mind.  
Some of the finest pipes being made today come from small American makers, 
Butera, Frey, Rausch.  These are hard to find, but well worth the search.  I
don't know if he's still around, but Julius Vesz, somewhere in Canada
was making superb pipes a few years ago.  I haven't seen one in a while,
so I can't say much about availability.

On Cigars:

If you can find them, the Private Stock (a second from a *major* Dominican 
maker) cigars are the best bang-for-the-buck going.  The Number 11 is a 
robusto with a lot of character and taste.  It's full bodied without being
overwhelming, and quite complex. (Quite similar to the Davidoff Special R.)

I've prattled on long enough.

<a name="6">Subject: A great Thanksgiving</a>

Several of my friends feel sorry for me because I'm spending Thanksgiving
alone, as my family lives in California and I live in New York.  They
don't know what a good Thanksgiving is.  I'm sitting here watching the
Dallas-Miami game with the sound down, I've got a Beethoven symphony going
on the stereo, and... I'm enjoying my first Cuban Cohiba.

Actually, it's a Canadian Cohiba, one of several I purchased on a trip to
Toronto three months ago.  The Havana House on Cumberland was having some
sort of charity benefit, and had a Cuban roller making Cohibas on the
premises, which were being sold for bargain prices: C$5 (about $4) for a
corona, C$10 for a robusto, C$15 for a Churchill.  I bought four of the
coronas and one robusto, which have been sitting in my humidor since.

I'm smoking a corona (actually a nonstandard size, 38x6", half an inch
short of what they call a Corona Especial).  It's very tasty and
full-bodied, but not harsh like some cheaper Cuban cigars.  It's a
wonderful accompaniment to a Canadian beer (LaBatt Blue, purchased at the
duty-free shop on the same trip).

My father has severe asthma and doesn't allow smoking in his house, so
it's a real treat for me *not* to spend Thanksgiving with the family.

By the way, there's a Dominican Cohiba on the market now, available at
Dunhill shops among other places.  Like the Dominican Montecristo that was
recently introduced, it's a pale imitation of the real thing from Havana.

Cheers,
James Taranto  ???????@?????.???

<a name="8">Subject: Pipes, Tobacco and AD&amp;D2nd</a>


Hi pipers,

I would like to ask you for some information on making pipes and
tobacco. Sure I could read a book or look it up in an encyclopedia.
But I think I need the knowledge of people who have actual expereince
in doing these crafts.

if you know AD&amp;D2nd, I would like to ask you for some help (you can
skip the next paragraph).  If you don't know what AD&amp;D2nd is, please
read on, you may even be of more help, since you apparently dont waste
time with it and spend more time with pipes...

AD&amp;D2nd is short for Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition.  It is a
rule system for fantasy role playing games. The system allows to set
up a very detailed personality and abilities of a player/character.
The setting of the play is often a civilisation like the roman empire
or medival times (f.i. Tolkien). In these worlds live lots of
interesting and dangerous creatures. Our group is very story oriented
and very often invent a new skill/proficiency which is not in the
official rule book. Recently, my bard started to learn the trade of
crafting tobacco pipes. Since in ancient times the trades of craftsman
were highly specialiced, one can not simply make a pipe if one already
had 'crafting wooden shoes' before. (cf. the different types of
smiths...).

Now I want to do a write up for 'Crafting Tobacco Pipes'.  (If you'd
know a better title, please let me know. But 'Crafting Pipes' might by
confusing with flutes.)

Since I almost know nothing about crafting pipes or production of
tobacco (I just use it) I would like to ask you for some input. Please
bear in mind that 1000 or 2000 years ago the trade of pipe making may
have been different from to day.

'Crafting Tobacco Pipes'

Points of interest are:

What do you need to make a pipe.  (Tools, woods, workshop or 'on the
road')

How long does it take to make a pipe.  (Experience, tools, wisdom,
dexterity, patient wife...)

What is the _relative_ value of the pipe when it is finished.
(a formula based on wood quality, time of labour, artistic abilites,
final quality of the pipe...)  Please, dont put the final value in
terms of US$.  The fantasy world has a price system that is based on
relative values, like 100 eggs is about one goose, or rather more
dependend on the time and knowlege it requires to produce something.

How long will pipes last. (quality, usage,..... ) [My first one,
though of good quality, lasted one year, then the neck broke due to
heat damage]

Anything else to know ?  (If you have some historical knowledge, it
would be very welcome.)


'Tobacco manufacturing'
Points of interest are:

The growing and harvest of tobacco plants would be in the domain of
the farmer's trade, I think.  Here I am looking more for the steps
from after harvest until the tobacco is ready to smoke.  If I recall
corectly, tobacco was available in Europe only after the Spaniards
brought it back from America.  Of course, in our fantasy world tobacco
is available at all times.  To make it short, points of interest are
similar to those listed above under Pipe making.

that's it, finally.  Ah, of course, when you mail me something, I take
it that I can use it in the Net.Bards.Book that I am writing.
Certainly this will be done under the no-profit ettiquette and you get
your acknowledgement.

Sorry Steve, maybe this long mail should go into the Pipes Digest
Supplement...

thanks to all 
Martin

[ A tall order, Martin! But it sounds like fun! I'll attempt a few
preliminary answers. Hope someone else will help me out!

A crude pipe can be made by an eight-year-old with a pocket knife. (I
know from personal experience. :-) But it takes a fair amount of
woodworking skill to make a good one.  Depending on the tools you're
using, and the effects you're trying for, it can take from an
afternoon to a week.

Briar is a _very_ hard wood, so briar pipes will be the toughest to
carve. Meerschaum is much softer, hence easier to work, but you'd
still have to make some hard fitments, so it would last. And
meerschaum carvers go in for fancy artwork and fitted lined hard
leather cases. A corncob can be made by anyone in minutes, including
an eight-year-old with a pocket knife.

Materials: Block briar root, sandpaper, rouge, walnut or similar
stains, carnauba wax. Possibly bone or amber for the stem. (I guess
vulcanite, or any other plastic, is out for AD&amp;D purposes...)

Tools: At the minimum, leather gloves and apron, a drill and bits
(metal bits, not wood augers), fine-tooth saw, sharp carving knife,
vise, small paintbrush for the stain, rags for buffing. A lathe would
help, for turning the pipe, as well as sanding or buffing it; so would
some sort of a grinder. I'd love to have a flex-shaft, especially if I
was trying to carve complicated artwork on the pipe. (Which I can't,
personally...) As the number and power of the tools increases, the
time to make the pipe decreases.

The value of the pipe depends on the quality of the wood. There's a
large chance factor, because you can hit grains of sand and other
defects that you can't see, as you carve. I'd say the effort is about
equivalent to making a good wooden chair.

Pipes can last forever if they're well-designed and well-cared for.
Stems will typically be the first thing to break, usually in about
five years, by sheer chewing.

Don't have the history handy, but I can check it. I'll send you Bill's
write-up on tobacco growing by separate mail. No problem with using
this, and if you do put in an acknowledgement, please mention the
Mailgroup. And please let us see, too! -S. ]

So many of you subscribed to mini-JIR that you rendered it,
very temporarily, irreproducible. We had planned to send out
this first issue early in the week of November 15. But with
this number of subscribers, that would have overwhelmed the
MIT computer system, and possibly slowed down other portions
of the net. Rather than do that, we made arrangements to
have a number of sites redistribute mini-JIR.

We apologize for the delay, and thank you for your patience.

1993-01-02  Purpose of the Mini-Journal (*)

The Mini-Journal of Irreproducible Results publishes news
about overly stimulating research and ideas. Specifically:

A) Haphazardly selected superficial (but advanced!) extracts
of research news and satire from the Journal of
Irreproducible Results (JIR).

B) News about the annual Ig Nobel Prize ceremony. Ig Nobel
Prizes honor "achievements that cannot or should not be
reproduced." A public ceremony is held at MIT, in Cambridge
Massachusetts, every autumn. The ceremony is sponsored
jointly by JIR and by the MIT Museum.

C) News about other science humor activities conducted by
the MIT Museum and JIR.

1993-01-03  Abstracts from JIR, vol. 38, no. 5, Sep/Oct 93

This section contains abstracts of articles that appear in
volume 38, number 5 (the September/October 1993 issue) of
The Journal of Irreproducible Results.

"Teeth Pulled by Peter the Great," by Rosamond Wolff Purcell
and Stephen J. Gould.
A photograph documents 24 teeth, all personally pulled by
Peter the Great of Russia, who fancied himself a dentist,
and who often would demand this sacrifice of a member of his
retinue or even of an idle passerby.

"Selecting a College: The Squirrel Index," by Bruce McAfee.
In recommending a college to attend, experts traditionally
rely on innacurate assumptions: that prospective students
can read, etc. The author proposes and tests a new approach
for selecting a college: examining the number and
friendliness of a college's resident squirrel population.

"What's in a Name? (Middle) Name-Dropping and Postwar
American Politics" by William J. Tompson
There is a marked trend toward shorter names for American
politicians and statesmen. This study uses a number of
highly sophisticated quantitative tests to draw a link
between this phenomenon and the influence of the Bolshevik
Revolution on American intellectual life.

"The Coffee Strength Gauge," by Stephen Drew.
A new wristwatch-shaped device assesses the quality of a cup
of coffee. It provides house guests and restaurant patrons
with a polite way to tell before drinking the coffee whether
it is too strong, too weak, or just right.

"A Phenomenon Caused by Excess Gravity," by J. William
Taylor.
Photographic evidence supports the author's theory of how
two wine glasses came to be of differing heights.

"The Phantom Research Grant Phenomenon," by George
Englebretsen and Genevieve Boulet.
The authors contend that, just as victims of limb loss are
often forced phsychologically to continue to behave as if
their phantom limbs still exist, victims of research grant
loss are often forced to continue to behave as if their
grants still exist.

"The Therapeutic Value of Whimpering," by Roma Lark.
The author, a nursing student, finds that the length of a
hospital patient's stay can be predicted by the quality and
frequency of the patient's whimpering.

"Measuring Effects of Space Flight Without Space Flight," by
Mark Shelhamer.
A simple mathematical method predicts human physical
performance under weightless conditions. It is based on
measuring the difference in performance, under normal
gravity, between subjects weighing (for example) X and 2X.

Interview with Nobel Physics laureate (1979) Allan Cormack.
Cormack developed the mathematical and physical foundations
of  computerized axial tomography (CAT) imaging. In this
interview, he explains his secrets for staying awake during
a dull lecture, and suggests candidates for the Ig Nobel
Prize.

"An Important but Neglected Function of Nitric Oxide (NO),"
by X. Perry Mental.
A historical context is given for the recent discovery,
published in the research journal "Science," that nitric
oxide (NO) may play a role in penile erections. A non-
seminal event was the 1965 discovery of the contraceptive
NO-acetol, the chemical structure of which has nitric oxide
(NO) in every position.

"Nitric Oxide (NO): Don't Confuse Cause With Effect," by
Benjamin J. Luberoff.
The author contends that recent research on nitric oxide
(NO) leaves it unclear whether: (a) NO conveys a message
that causes penile erection; or (b) the erection elicits the
NO.

"Comedic Cosmology," by Howard Zaharoff.
The publication of this article was made possible by a
generous donation from the author's family.

"A Cool Analysis of the Heat Pump," by Mark Lipsman.
The classical heat pump is analyzed in terms of the spaces
between molecules, Planck's constant, and moving trains.

"Elegant Results" (regular column) by Alice Shirell Kaswell.
Styles, trends, and tidbits, culled from leading research
journals. In this issue: findings from the research journals
"Skin Art Encyclopedia," " Outlaw Biker Review," and
"Tattoo."

"Scientific Gossip" (regular column) by Stephen Drew.
Contains 100% gossip from concentrate. In this issue:
Recycled House Wine; Disorder for Doctors; Patch People;
Fungus Factory; There's a Song in My Stomach; Gas for
interested Viewers; The Passing of Things Remembered;
Borderline Therapy; The Omni-Drug Revolution.

1993-01-04  List of 1993 Ig Nobel Prize Winners

The winners of the 1993 Ig Nobel Prizes were announced in a
ceremony held on October 7 at MIT. The Prizes honor
individuals whose achievements cannot or should not be
reproduced.

Eleven Ig Nobel Prizes were given this year. The winners
come from 16 different countries: Australia; Belgium;
Canada; England; France; Germany; Ireland; Israel;
Luxembourg; the Netherlands; New Zealand; the Philippines;
Poland; Spain; Switzerland; and the United States.

A number of dignitaries participated in the ceremony,
including: Nobel Laureates William Lipscomb (chemistry,
1976), Sheldon Glashow (physics, 1979), Jerome Friedman
(physics, 1990), Mel Schwartz, (physics, 1985) and Dudley
Herschbach (chemistry, 1986); Russell Johnson, professor
emeritus from Gilligan's Island; Alan Lightman, author of
"Einstein's Dreams;" jazz harpist Deborah Henson-Conant, MIT
economist Paul Krugman; "New England Journal of Medicine"
executive editor Marcia Angell; past president of the
American Bar association John J. Curtin; and Tufts
University Dental School's Philip Molloy, who has performed
more than 10,000 root canal procedures.

The new winners:

Psychology
John Mack of Harvard Medical School and David Jacobs of
Temple University, mental visionaries, for their leaping
conclusion that people who believe they were kidnapped by
aliens from outer space, probably were -- and especially for
their conclusion that, in Professor Jacobs's words, "the
focus of the abduction is the production of children."
[Both Mack and Jacobs have written and spoken extensively on
the subject. A good introduction is the book "Secret Life,"
by David Jacobs with an introduction by John Mack, Simon and
Schuster, New York, 1992.]

Consumer Engineering
Ron Popeil, incessant inventor and perpetual pitchman of
late night television, for redefining the industrial
revolution with such devices as the Veg-O-Matic, the Pocket
Fisherman, the Cap Snaffler, Mr. Microphone, and the Inside-
the-Shell Egg Scrambler.

Biology
Paul Williams, Jr. of the Oregon State Health Division and
Kenneth W. Newell of the Liverpool School of Tropical
Medicine, bold biological detectives, for their pioneering
study, "Salmonella Excretion in Joy-Riding Pigs."  [The
study was published in "The American Journal of Public
Health," vol. 60, no. 5, May, 1970. Kenneth Newell died in
March, 1990.]

Economics
Ravi Batra of Southern Methodist University, shrewd
economist and best-selling author of "The Great Depression
of 1990" ($17.95) and "Surviving the Great Depression of
1990" ($18.95), for selling enough copies of his books to
single-handedly prevent worldwide economic collapse.

Peace
The Pepsi-Cola Company of the Phillipines, suppliers of
sugary hopes and dreams, for sponsoring a contest to create
a millionaire, and then announcing the wrong winning number,
thereby inciting and uniting 800,000 riotously expectant
winners, and bringing many warring factions together for the
first time in their nation's history.

Visionary Technology
Presented jointly to Jay Schiffman of Farmington Hills,
Michigan, crack inventor of AutoVision, an image projection
device that makes it possible to drive a car and watch
television at the same time, and to the Michigan state
legislature, for making it legal to do so.  [Michigan House
Bill 4530, Public Act #55 was signed into law by the
Governor on June 6, 1991.]

Chemistry
James Campbell and Gaines Campbell of Lookout Mountain,
Tennessee, dedicated deliverers of fragrance, for inventing
scent strips, the odious method by which perfume is applied
to magazine pages.  [Additional historical information about
the invention of scent strips can be obtained from the
Campbells' former colleague, Ronald Versic, President of the
Ronald P. Dodge Company in Dayton, OH.]

Literature
Awarded jointly to E. Topol, R. Califf, F. Van de Werf, P.
W. Armstrong, and their 972 co-authors, for publishing a
medical research paper which has one hundred times as many
authors as pages. [Source "An International Randomized Trial
Comparing Four Thrombolytic Strategies for Acute Myocardial
Infarction," "The New England Journal of Medicine," volume
329, number 10, September 2, 1993, pages 673-682.
The co-authors come from 15 different nations: Australia;
Belgium; Canada; England; France; Germany; Ireland; Israel;
Luxembourg; the Netherlands; New Zealand; Poland; Spain;
Switzerland; and the United States.]

Mathematics
Robert Faid of Greenville, South Carolina, farsighted and
faithful seer of statistics, for calculating the exact odds
(8,606,091,751,882:1) that Mikhail Gorbachev is the
Antichrist. [Faid's complete calculation is contained in the
book "Gorbachev! Has the Real Antichrist Come?" published by
Victory House, Tulsa, Oklahoma. The pertinent section of the
book was reprinted in the January, 1989 issue of Harper's
Magazine.]

Physics
Louis Kervran of France, ardent admirer of alchemy, for his
conclusion that the calcium in chickens' eggshells is
created by a process of cold fusion. [For an English
language version of Kervran's research see the book
"Biological Transmutations, and their applications in
chemistry, physics, biology, ecology, medicine, nutrition,
agriculture, geology," by Louis Kervran, Swan House
Publishing Co., 1972.]

Medicine
James F. Nolan, Thomas J. Stillwell, and John P. Sands, Jr.,
medical men of mercy, for their painstaking research report,
"Acute Management of the Zipper-Entrapped Penis."  [Nolan is
Associate in Urology at the Guthrie Clinic in Sayre, PA.
Stillwell is in private practice at North Urology, Ltd., in
Robbinsdale, MN. Sands is Chairman of the Department of
Urology, Naval Hospital, San Diego, CA. Their report was
published in "The Journal of Emergency Medicine," vol. 8,
1990.]

1993-01-05  NAFTA Update

Until very recently, the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) was the subject of fierce debate among economists.
The remarkable sudden arrival at concensus within the
profession was due largely to a concept articulated by Paul
Krugman. Krugman delivered his remarks on October 7 at the
Ig Noble Prize Ceremony, in the form of a Heisenberg
Certainty Lecture.

Heisenberg Certainty Lecture #4.
Paul Krugman, Professor of Economics, MIT.
"The MIT Economics Department has now solved the riddle of
world economic crisis. It turns out that if you add up last
year's reported imports and exports for all of the countries
in the world, world imports exceeded world exports by more
than one hundred billion dollars. You know what that means.
It means that we are running a huge global deficit in our
interplanetary trade. So Ross Perot has it wrong. That great
sucking sound isn't coming from Mexico -- it's coming from
outer space. Space aliens are stealing American jobs."


--------------------------
1993-01-06  JIR Recommends

Research reports that merit a trip to the library:

"Surgical Management of an Epidemic of Penile Amputations in
Siam," by Kasian Bhanganada, Tu Chayavatana, Chumporn
Pongnumkul, Anunt Tonmukayakul, Piyasakol Sakolsatayadorn,
Krit Komaratal, and Henry Wilde, "The American Journal of
Surgery," 1983, no. 146, pp. 376-382. The report reads in
part: "It became fashionable in the decade after 1970 for
the humiliated Thai wife to wait until her [philandering]
husband fell asleep so that she could quickly sever his
penis with a kitchen knife. A traditional Thai home is
elevated on pilings and the windows are open to allow for
ventilation. The area under the house is the home of the
family pigs, chickens, and ducks. Thus, it is quite usual
that an amputated penis is tossed out of an open window,
where it may be captured by a duck."

"Protein, cDNA, and Genomic DNA Sequences of the Towel Gourd
Trypsin Inhibitor, A Squash Family Inhibitor," "The Journal
of Biological Chemistry," vol. 268, no. 2, January 15, 1993,
pp. 810-814. (Thanks to Thomas Michel for bringing this to
our attention.)

"Establishment of Cattle-Human Relationships," by X. Boivin,
P. Le Neindre, and J. M. Chupin, "Applied Animal Behavior
Science," vol. 32, 1992, pp. 325-335. (Thanks to Earle
Spamer for bringing this to our attention.)

While on vacation over the last week, I bought a seventy cent cigar;
a manduro Arthur Fuente.  It was one of the best I've tried.  It was
mellow with a pleasant aroma.  Even my wife didn't complain as much.
It burned evenly all the way down.  I've been smoking what I thought
were inexpensive Dominican cigars from the local chain store.  This
was cheaper; but a much, much more enjoyable smoke.  The Dominicans
tend to burn faster on one side than the other and get so bitey near
the end that I frequently let them go out and finish them after my
taste buds have recovered.  If you haven't tried one yet, it's worth
the effort!

Bulk tobacco source

I recently found one I am quite fond of named "341". This is not a private
label, rather a order number from the manufacture. It comes in bulk 5 pound
bags, and is quite good. It is a balanced English blend, with a very small 
amount of virginia. This makes it burn very cool. 

341 was available from a PCI, but they have dropped it. I would like to find
a source for the blend and stock up before taxs hit the roof. 

Mr Levin, of Levin pipes guesses it's put out by World Tobac. I have no idea
how to find out for sure, or how to find World Tobac.

Thanks all.

&gt; I was looking for some information about cigar smoking and was hoping you

  You _definitely_ should subscribe to the pipes mailing list. (I CC'ed
this letter to Steve, the moderator of the list.) Don't be fooled by the
name; there are just as many cigar lovers as pipe enthusiasts
participating. As for forming a tobacco newsgroup... that has sort of a
checkered past: A couple years ago, Steve tried (unsuccessfully) to
start one. Two months ago, Steve, Colin Crist, and I attempted to form a
moderated rec.tobacco. Again it failed, this time due to a huge number
of "no" votes from the anti-smoking crowd. If you've been reading
alt.smoking you can see that they're pretty rabid in their attacks. The
good news is that all the publicity has caused Steve's list to
dramaticaly increase it's distribution.
  As for cigars to try: go to a good tobacconist and tell him you're
just learning about cigars. Select 2 or 3 cigars in the $2-$5 range. Be
sure to get one Dominican Republic cigar with a light colored wrapper,
and one Honduras cigar with a dark brown wrapper. (I'd recommend a Hoyo
de Monterray Excalibur #1, #2, or Banquet for the later...a personal
favorite). Dominican Republic cigars tend to be a lighter style.
Honduras are more full bodied. If you find you like the full bodied
variety then the ultimate treasure is a Cuban cigar. They're illegal to
bring into the US, but not impossible to find. It's best to know what
you like before spending $15-$35 (or more) on a single cigar. Have fun!

<a name="12">Subject: Buttons, buttons, who's got the buttons?</a>

Hi, all,

For some time, I've been meaning to tell you all about Nancy
Lebovitz's calligraphic button catalog. If you've been to computer
shows or science-fiction conventions in the general Middle Atlantic
area, you may have noticed her tables, laden with all kinds of
hand-drawn slogans, and thronged by the largest crowds at the show.
There are _thousands_ of them, in all colors (buttons, not the crowd
:-) and nicely done, too! To get her catalog, write her at:

	Nancy Lebovitz
	400 Wollaston Ave, C6
	Newark DE  19711

	Email: ?????@?????.????.????.???


The email catalog has three advantages: it's machine-searchable,
it's suitable for a cookie file, and it's free. :-)

So why am I plugging her buttons? Because there are a few of
special interest to fine-tobacco aficionados, some of which I'll
reproduce here:

     I've read so much about the dangers of sex, smoking, and drinking
     that I've given up reading   (I'VE:dangers/reading)

     Thank you for not lecturing me about smoking   (THA:not lecturing)

     Mobile Smoking area   (MOB:smoking)

     There is no heaven or hell--only smoking or non-smoking
     (THE:heaven/smoking)

In fairness, there are about as many non-smoking buttons, and a
_lot_ of others. Some good ones at random:

     Think "HONK" if you're a telepath   (THI:think honk)

     Avoid cliches like the plague--they're a dime a dozen   (AVO:$0.10)

     Campus Crusade for Cthulhu--It found me   (CAM:campus crusade)

     Hail to the Sun God! He is the Fun God! Ra! Ra! Ra! (HAI:ra!)

     Migratory lifeform with a tropism for bookstores   
     (MIG:tropism/bookstores)

     Invertebrate Punster--Spinelessly unable to resist a pun--So slug me!
     (INV:invertebrate punster) 

     Back off, man--I'm a scientist   (BAC:Back off/scientist)

     Hail to the Sun God! He is the Fun God! Ra! Ra! Ra!   (HAI:ra!)

     Student of the Harry Tuttle school of Revolutionary Plumbing
     (STU:tuttle/plumbing) 

     Seppuku button(tm)--to use, fold back pin   (SEP:seppuku)

And, especially for Bill Thacker,

     Humpty Dumpty was pushed   (HUM:dumpty)


And she also does custom ones. I noticed, though, that her stock
has a Serious Shortcoming - no pipe or cigar buttons. Would anyone
be interested in inventing a slogan or two, and getting a custom
button made? Let's talk!

Until Digest #122, then,

<a name="2">Subject: Pipes Digest #121 - December 3, 1993</a>

&gt;   &gt; I, as a Canadian, can bring Cuban cigars into the United States for my
&gt;   &gt; own personal use.  It is only illegal if I sell them or give them to
&gt;   &gt; somebody else.  That's why they sell them in the Duty Free.
&gt;
&gt;   Damn. A Canadian just came down to visit, and all I ordered was a haggis.

That's news to me - It was definately NOT true in the 70s. 
Cuban products are BANNED in the United States - it matters not who owns
them. (The trick is to get them into an embassy via diplomatic pouch.)
Cuban cigars would be confiscated (or destroyed, depending on the agent) at
the border. Canadians had the option of returning to Canada and keeping
their cigars or "destroying them". Americans simply had them confiscated.
Occasionally, a "liberal" agent would allow the "distruction" by smoking on
the spot. I have heard stories of this happening as recently as August of
1993. (By the way, "personal use" is a formal customs term, which
translates into 4 cigars - per trip - they don't consider duration - if I
remember correctly. 2 packs of cigaretts and 4oz of pipe tobacco.)

And as for the Haggis - they are easily enough acquired here in the states.
However, given the recent tax increases, a request for a bottle of Laphroaig
might be considered a reasonable compromise.

&gt;   &gt; According to my old tobacconist in Pittsburgh (Ivan at Continental), 
&gt;   &gt; Latakia is processed over fires of dried camel dung.  Any tobacco
&gt;   &gt; experts out there care to comment?
&gt;
&gt;   Dung is a traditional fuel throughout most of the world. I've read that
&gt;   it's over a fire of herbs; I much prefer to believe that :-)

This must explain why I and many other latakia fans have always described
the "scent" (and had it described to us) as "buring camel dung."

However, I don't believe that ANY tobacco is "dried" over a fire. Although I 
could see the already "dired and aged" leaves "smoked" to provide a flavor.
But then, all the references I can find to Latakia call it either an
"oriental spice" tobacco, or simply "Turkish Latakia." Hmm, I'll have to
see if I can find any other references to its "curing."

&gt;   From: ???????@??????????.???.?? (Martin Ott)
&gt;   Subject: Pipes, Tobacco and AD&amp;D2nd
&gt;
&gt;   I would like to ask you for some information on making pipes and
&gt;   tobacco. Sure I could read a book or look it up in an encyclopedia.
&gt;   But I think I need the knowledge of people who have actual expereince
&gt;   in doing these crafts.
&gt;
&gt;   AD&amp;D2nd is short for Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition.  .....
&gt;   ... Our group is very story oriented
&gt;   and very often invent a new skill/proficiency which is not in the
&gt;   official rule book. Recently, my bard started to learn the trade of
&gt;   crafting tobacco pipes. 

Danger Will Robinson, Danger.... (Steve, you may not believe this but...)
Axler, Otto and I are still playing together - although we "retired" Axler's
world (1980-88) and moved to Otto's world (1984-current). But we never
spent the money on the 2nd edition (except for Wild Magic.) We have been
known to spend as long describing the "dinner" we were ordering from the
local Inn as we did dispatching monsters. However, I must say that recently
(since we all grew up) we have taken to "tasting wine" along with our D&amp;D
to the point where we are running something like 2-3 game sessions
(typically a 6 hour Saturday about every 6 weeks) per hour of game time.

At any rate, the most logical type of pipe for the period (ignoring the
Hobbits) is the "tavern pipe". This was a "clay pipe." It typically had a
very long stem, when new. This was because the pipes were EXPENSIVE,
probably in the 50-100 GP range (assuming "fine dinner with ale" at the
Inn costs 5GP - you'll have to shift and shuffle to match the economy of
your world. Fine ale is typically 1gp/tankard. Cheap beer 2-3 sp. Wine is
VERY expenisve as viticulture is "reserved" to the clerical folks - a glass
of wine might go for 10-15GP if you can get it. Similarly distilled
spirits, are in the 10-15GP range PER gill! Again, typically restricted to
"sacramental" uses... but if you have a cleric of Thor!!! Fine dinner would
be a hank of meat and potatoes, carrots and onions. Normal dinner would be
"stone soup" - a thin stew (or maybe gruel) which had the bones left from
the "fine diners" tossed in for flavor.

Back to the "tavern pipe." A tavern owner kept a rack of pipes on the wall
which he "rented" to customers for an after dinner smoke. His "regulars"
might have a marked pipe kept aside for them. All other would "share" a
pipe. This sharing was accomplished by breaking off about 2 inches of the
pipe for each new customer. Hence a "tavern pipe" with a 2 foot long stem
would eventually shorten itself down to a "billiard" shape with a 6 inch
stem after a number of customers.

&gt;   What do you need to make a pipe.  (Tools, woods, workshop or 'on the
&gt;   road')
&gt;
&gt;   How long does it take to make a pipe.  (Experience, tools, wisdom,
&gt;   dexterity, patient wife...)
&gt;
Hmmm. Since we are essentailly talking about "pottery" here. A good source
of "firing clay," a mould would most likely work better than a "wheel".
(the 2 halves are created separately and then stuck together in a
"finishing" step. That's how you get the hole in the stem since you can't
"pour" clay, only force it in a mold.) The mold would be "hand carved" and
probably good for some arbitrary number of "castings." Then it would break,
wear out, etc - probably a D12's worth. Now you could add "high tech" to
this mould by making it of 3 pieces. Piece 1 is the outside shape of the
pipe (bowl and stem). This would be "filled" with clay. Then the "inside" 
pressed into this - half the bowl and smoke hole. Then the Flat back of the
mold "scraped accross the front and attached so as to make the whole ready
for firing. Hmm... what would you make the mold out of that wouldn't burn.
Or maybe it would, in which case 1 mould = 1 pipe.

&gt;   Anything else to know ?  (If you have some historical knowledge, it
&gt;   would be very welcome.)
&gt;
A "Missouri Meershaum" (croncob pipe) can last a long or short time, mostly
depending upon the care with which the "cake" is burned on and how
frequenly it is used "and abused."

"Obviously?" A "traveling man" would need something in which to carry his
or her pipe which would protect it against pummelling and the like. So an
obvious "side line" would be the crafting of a carying case for the pipe.

&gt;   A crude pipe can be made by an eight-year-old with a pocket knife. (I
&gt;   know from personal experience. :-) But it takes a fair amount of
&gt;   woodworking skill to make a good one.  Depending on the tools you're
&gt;   using, and the effects you're trying for, it can take from an
&gt;   afternoon to a week.

I used to make pipes out of acorns and nails. They didn't smoke very well,
but they looked the part. Yeah, it was probably around eight years old.
About the time that one got the first pocket knife from Cub Scouts or 
whatever.

Hi Steve.
Greetings to all.

	I'm about to bring up a subject that may be wholly unpopular,
but what the hell. I'm not looking for arguments, only for
information.
	How many people that smoke pipes are really concerned about
mouth cancer?  I'm one who doesn't really care.  (i.e. we're all going
to die...)  I want to know what the level of concern is here, whether
there's any good material to read on the fallicies/truths involved in
the cancer issue, etc.  I've spoken to people about it, but I would
sooner trust a group like this to know the truths about the subject.
Answer with care, please.  I'm not looking for offhanded remarks.
	Thanks.
	Also, regarding the subject of How to Smoke a Pipe, I know
there are some who would say, "Just smoke the damn thing."  Others,
however, would give small tips about what should &amp; shouldn't be done
when smoking a pipe to make it most enjoyable.  I'm looking for a
handful of these little tips, so I can compare it to how I smoke.
Excellence is a matter of habits, so tell me how you might achieve
excellence in the minor habits of smoking a pipe.

[ Well, personally, I'm concerned to the point that I'm really trying
to avoid tongue bite these days. It's more pleasurable that way, too.
BTW, I'd like the other readers here to feel OK about discussing
health issues here; I'll post concerns, but not flames. Glad you felt
comfortable enough to bring it up, David!

And that also brings up something on the "How To" topic: lately, I've
been smoking only half-bowls, because the full ones get pretty gamey
toward the end, and have more tendency to bite. Does anyone else do
this? -S. ]

At any rate, discussion earlier touched on Philadelphia tobacco shops
and I'd like to plug a good one, The Tobacco Village in the Roosevelt Mall.
Yes, a Mall tobacco shop worthy of the name.

The proprieter is Louise Hood and her hysband Irv.  
Louise is probably more knowledgable about 
tobacco than most of the men that enter her shop.

The stock is wide ranging, including pipes from some local (PA) carvers
plus most of the best Italian and English pipes, signed meerchaums 
and all of the major pipe tobaccos, including the Levin/McClellen line
Bengal Slices, et al.
(Holt's shop long ago moved the pipe tobacco to the rear of the store and the
expensive pens to the front -- this was a business consideration to be sure,
but it's a shame the place is not what it was, at least for pipes, cigars
are still their forte)

I'm not trying to be an ad for Louise, or anything, it's just one of the best
shops I've been in.  And a friendly place, too, as most tobacco shops are.

If you're in the area, the number is (215) 331-0216
The Roosevelt Mall is on Roosevelt Blvd, which is US route 1 north through
Phila.

If you're a great fan of wearing buttons, but you're disappointed
because you can't find the slogans you want, here's a tip:

Go to a local craft store and ask for "Kelly's Fun Buttons". The front
of "Fun Button" pops right off, so anything you can print on a small
circle of paper can instantly be made into a button. 

I print up pages of buttons all the time using DTP programs.

<a name="12">Subject: Re: alt.cigars/rec.tobacco</a>

  IMHO, we can endure the flamage in alt.smokers (and a two-entry
twit filter would take care of most if it.)
  With the goal of having a real, moderated, rec.tobacco next
summer, I'd rather keep all the good high-signal stuff in one
place (alt.smokers.)

  If there were alt.cigars, I would ask again what I asked on
alt.smokers, and if there were any answers I missed them:
  What with so many people enjoying cigars, I thought I'd give
them a try.  I like Turkish Special cigarettes, and their Pipo
tobacco, or something sweet like Mango Cavendish.
  So far I've tried the following:
    Canaria d'oro (baby 65c) -- harsh, nothing good about it
    Juan Clemente (Demitasse $2.10) -- Nicely strong, but more bitter than sweet
    Royal Jamaican (Pirate $1.80) -- Too Weak taste, what little there was
             was mainly metallic or sour, possible hint of sweetness
 And today I picked up:
    Danneman Menor Sumatra small cigars
    Henry Clay
    Petrus
 and Cake Box Connecticut Valley

  (Tonight I'm going to a Hanukah Party at the home of a friend who
smokes a lot and well -- what better way to celebrate the Festival
of Lighting Up?)

 Any suggestions for other varieties I might enjoy?

[ While not as dedicated a cigar buff as others on the mailgroup, I
seem to like Upmanns, and I tried a Pleaides the other night that I
enjoyed. In small cigars, Panters and Henri Winterman spring to mind.
I'd also appreciate other what-to-try ideas! -S. ]

From: ??????@?????.??? (David Chesler)
<a name="2">Subject: Home-made pipes</a>

  I vaguely recall from childhood trips to historic villages (which were
Dutch in greater New York) that clay pipes were built not with two pieces,
but with a "lost wax" method.  (I'd guess any world advanced enough to
have fine clay, and that with which to light their pipes, would have
some form of wax -- bees or tallow.)  The wax is formed into where the
hole goes, the clay is formed around the hole, and then when the clay is
fired the wax runs out.

  Now two folks have posted that it's easy to make corn cob pipes:  Although
the season for fresh sweet corn is departed in New England, please tell!

  I did bring two Cuban cigars home from Canada in 1978 (before I knew what
to do with them, and it was a high school bus trip, so I didn't actually 
declare anything through customs.)  Considering what other intoxicants we 
had on board, commie tobacco was probably the least thing to worry about.
(My impression, not based on hard sources, is that US citizens and businesses
may not do business with Cuba, but not that Cuban products were always
forbidden [as is the case now with ivory] although I could well be wrong,
especially if things changed in the last decade.)

     - David Chesler (??????@?????.???)


[ Well, I wouldn't recommend using a wet ear of sweet corn for this,
David! What you need are: one dry corncob (you can usually find these
around farms, or use an Indian-corn Thanksgiving decoration), one dry
hollow milkweed stem (the kind with the long thin seed pods), and a
pocket knife. Cut the milkweed stem to about six inches and break a
two-inch length off the corncob. Hollow out the cob to within about
1/4 inch from the bottom, and drill a hole in the side with the knife.
The stem should fit snugly in the hole and should come in just above
the cob insides you left at the bottom of the bowl. Fill with tobacco
and enjoy! 

BTW, the tobak that smokes best with this procedure is the kind you
steal from your dad.  For complete authenticity, sneak out into the
woods to light up. :-) -S. ]

<a name="3">Subject: Cigars</a>

This is my first posting to the group.

I am a Macanudo and Hoyo fan.  Been smoking Macanudos for over 15
years now.  I particularly love a smoke accompanied by a good Island
Malt Whisky (like Lagavulin or Laphroaig).  I prefer the ring sizes
around 50 and 6-8 inch in length.

I have purchased Cuban cigars (Upmann, Los Statos, and Cohiba all
Havanas), and brought them into the US with impunity. Most recently at
the duty-free shop right at the Los Cabos airport in Baja.  Private
citizens were not prohibited from buying them outside the US and
bringing them in in limited numbers for their own use.  As I
understand it, direct trade with Cuba is the issue - not cigars.  I
have also had friends ship them to me from Guantanamo Bay!  I have
noticed that Havanas have gone down in quality considerably in the
last 5 years.  My last batch of Cohibas were nothing special at all,
and when I heard that Davidoff has stopped making Cubans, that did it
for me.

I recently purchased a couple of 18 inch (! that's right !) Generals
(ring size 60).  Has anyone dared to try one of these yet.  I'm
waiting for a 5-6 hour stretch when I can sit down and light that
model up!  Another new one I've been trying, along the milder side
like Macanudo, is Avo.  Anyone tried them?

I have had a problem with a large percentage of my Hoyo Excaliburs
lately.  They do not burn evenly, and frequently unravel!  Is anyone
else experincing this difficulty?  Great flavor, but the construction
seems to be poor lately.

Well, happy smoking,

Ron Nadel

[ Thanks for the word, Ron! BTW, Cigar Aficionado had an article in a
recent issue about single-malt whiskys, including the unpronouncable
kinds. -S. ]

        Address for Holt's is 114 S. 16th street  Philadelphia, PA 19102
        800-523-1641.  I agree the store is not what it used to be for pipes
        or anyone interested in talking about pipes or tobacco.  They do have 
        several good blends...Burlington Arcade is an old blend Holt's took 
        over, a flake cut easy to pack with nice flavor and aroma.Their blend
        101 is mild but very aromatic...a good beginners smoke.  Concerning 
        Tobacco shop blends it has been my experience that they are often too 
        moist, I tend to leave several ounces spread out on newspaper or in
        old baking tins to dry out, this gets some curious looks in my office 
        and we won't go in to what my wife has to say about it at home.  I'm
        wondering if anyone out there has tried drying out tobacco in an oven
        or if they would suggest or discourage such an activity.  I prefer
        a dry tobacco I think it burns better and makes for a more relaxed
        smoke. Thoughts on cancer.  Moderation.  If I'm going out to 
        spend a night drinking beer and talking I'll switch to cigaretts or 
        a H. Upmann 2000, I try to limit pipes to 2 bowls a day.  I am of the
        ilk that believes there is a strong genetic component to cancer so I
        would suggest a good look at the family tree.

I have two suggestions for you: 1) Try some of the Honduran handmades;
they are generally more robust in taste, and closer to the old style
havanas.  Some of the best values right now IMHO, are the "Hoyo de
Monterrey" and "Punch" (actually made by the same factory) brands.
2) Try some of the higher quality, more complex, but still not very
heavy, Dominican handmades.  Two of the best lines in the world right
now (again IMHO), are the "Arturo Fuente" and the "Partagas" brands.
Try any of the thicker than 45 ring Fuentes, or the Partagas #10.
Sublime!!!

From: James Taranto &lt;???????@?????.???&gt;
<a name="7">Subject: Importing Cuban cigars</a>

There are, in fact, two ways to import Cuban cigars legally in the
United States:

1. If you are a U.S. citizen and you visit Cuba itself, you are
allowed to bring back up to 100 Cuban cigars, worth up to $400, for
personal use.  The catch is that the only U.S. citizens allowed to
travel to Cuba are people who have relatives there, and scholars,
journalists, and diplomats traveling on business.

2. If you are not a U.S. citizen, you may bring in Cuban cigars for
personal use.  I'm not sure how many you're allowed to bring, but I
imagine the rules are the same as for U.S. citizens returning from
Canada.  I stopped at a duty-free shop along the Quebec-Vermont border
a few months ago, and they were selling Montecristos and Bances from
Havana, but only to non-Americans.  The only place to go when you
leave the parking lot of this shop is over the bridge to the U.S.

Someone said earlier that "personal use" meant you can't sell or give
them away; I doubt, however, that giving them as a gift violates the
law.  Selling them probably would, however.

Cheers,
James Taranto  ???????@?????.???

[ Well, the "journalist" thing is easy to use... a friend of mine
travels there routinely and just writes a samizdat article when she
comes back. But... you can bring them back from Cuba, but not from
Canada????? -S. ]

Thanks for the welcome. I'm a pipe smoker of many years standing,
having started in 1962 or thereabouts. I quit for a number of years in
between, then picked it up again around 1980. I not that you listed
Pipeworks in NYC; I have dealt with them from time to time. Their own
pipes, made by Elliot Nachwalter, are excellent.

My favorite pipemaker is not currently listed, so here it is:

   S&amp;R WoodCrafts
   4244 East Main Street
   Colombus, OH 43213
   800-828-2535
   614-235-6422

"S" and "R" are Steve and Roswitha Anderson. Both are pipemakers. Steve does
primarily high quality classic pipes, and Rose makes mostly freehands, also
of very high quailty. Their regular pipes range from $65 to $300, and they
have some specials that run into several thousand (such as a 7 day set, all
straight grain with curved smokeholes).

They also have an excellent set of tobacco blends which they ship anywhere.
They offer an automatic delivery program.

They appear at a few craft shows during the summer.

That's all I have for now--I'll probably send more after I read the digest
thoroughly.

[ Thanks for the word, Larry! Don't own any S&amp;R pipes, but I had a

Hi.  Thanks for putting me on your list.  You asked for some info about
myself so... I am 40 years old, teach philosophy, married with children,
have smoked pipes off and on for 15 years.  Used to live in New York, 
now in California, but I still get my pipe supplies from Connoisseur
Pipe Shop in NY.  They are the best I've found.  Make their own pipes, 
mix their own tobaccos.  I do not have an elaborate pipe collection -
only three briars of comfortable if not magnificent quality.  And I 
agree that pipe smoking is the king of smoking pleasures.

cigar buffs and the single-malt and brandy aficionados... Welcome! -S.]

Welcome to new members:

	Ted Clark		(Edward. ?.?????.???.@?????????.???)
	Jim Richmond		(????????@???.???.???.???)
	Vichu Tanta-Nanta	(????????@???.??.???)

And welcome to the Holiday Issue of the Pipes Digest! The guy in the
red suit has left me the Comeback of the Week:

	"Is it the smoke that bothers you, or the sight of someone
	 enjoying himself?"

				- From "101 Ways to Answer the
				  Question, 'Would You Please Put Out
				  that #(!&amp;*!$ Cigar'," Hague et. al.,
				  1987. 

He also left a cookie file of the shortest and best of the 101 Ways,
which I'll put in the header every now and then. The file should be
suitable for use with fortune(6), perhaps with minor tweeking
necessary. If anyone wants a copy for their own personal use, please
send mail and we'll ship it out Reindeer Express.

In the meantime, we'll continue the Cuban Debates, indulge in some
hamming activities, review some fine cigars, and of course have plenty
of good smokes for the holidays. Enjoy! -S.

<a name="3">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #123 - December 17, 1993</a>

Steve- ran across a few questions in digest #123 that I can respond to. 
Cuban cigars in Mexico?  Good luck folks!  I looked high and low during at
least three different trips in the 1980s.  On one of these trips I spent a
lot of time in Mexico city and even there could not turn up a single
Havana.  Personally, I am not at all fond of the Mexican brands sold in
the U.S., but I tried a few down there which are not available here that
were remarkably good.  By the way, there is one way that most any American
citizen can get to Cuba- that way being directly from Mexico.  You get the
visa for Cuba in Mexico, and from what friends have told me, neither the
Mexican nor the Cuban authorities  cause any problem.  Of course, if one
somehow ended up with a Cuban stamp in a U.S. passport, the U.S.
authorities might not be amused upon one's return from Mexico.  I tried a
large Avo cigar recently and thought it was excellent- they do seem
awfully expensive however.  As for the Hoyo's burning unevenly, I have
always had that problem with them.  I think it may have to do with their
wrappers- at least in the maduro.  Has anybody tried the new Rey del Mundo
line just out from the Dominican Republic?  Happy Holidays.

<a name="4">Subject: Another ham</a>

QRZ de N8JYV - QTH Columbus, OH - nm hr is Steve!
   
   Yes, another pipe-smoking ham here.  After 15 years of cigarettes, I
took up the pipe in order to give my idle hands something to do.  For the
past 8 years or so, I have enjoyed my pipe.  My favorite pipe is my trusty
little Dr. Grabow Bucko - a small bowl, and half-bowls are enough to make
me happy during my breaks at my "smoke-free environment" workplace (however
recently the outside temps here in the Midwest make me hurry thru them a
lot quicker than I would like!)

   My favorite blend is called Cade's Cove Cavendish from the Gatlin-Burlier
in Gatlinburg, TN - it's a nice aromatic with a pleasant taste - not the wet
taste one finds with the commercial domestic aromatics!  It smells so nice
I can usually get away with puffing it in no-smoking zones such as department
stores without criticism - usually someone will go out of their way to say
how nice it smells!

   The big advantage is while at the keyboard (I am sysop for a packet BBS
here) I can set the pipe down while I type, and when I need a moment to get
my thoughts on the right track I can light it back up again, take a few puffs,
and continue - not like letting a cigarette burn away in the ashtray!  And no
longer do I have to smell the harsh chemicals the cigarette manufacturers use
to keep the paper from burning faster than the tobac - no formaldehyde or
other nasal irritants!  Just a nice, natural burning smell.

   I was a bit miffed when I went to a nice restaurant in the area recently
and found printed on the front of their menu that cigarette smoking was ok,
but pipes and cigars were not allowed!  Of course, we all have smelled some
rank cigars, and some pipe tobaccos aren't real pleasing either (I personally
can't stand Latakia - smells and tastes like soap to me!) - but I was real
tempted to fire up my cavendish to see if anyone would complain!  I didn't,
but I can almost bet I would have gotten more compliments on the smell than
complaints!

   Ham radio is both my hobby and my business (which I don't want to go into
right now), and interfacing my radios to my computers gives me long (and late)
hours of entertainment!  I don't do much HF, and VHF/UHF repeaters are a turn-
off to me for the most part.  I do participate in some ham/computer nets in
the area on a regular basis, and spend most of my time on 2-meter simplex -
occasionally some SSB, but not very often.  My interest is digital communica-
tions (PACKET RACKET!!!) on VHF, and am currently experimenting with TCP/IP
gateways from ax.25 packet to the Internet.  The major drawback is that any-
thing going from Internet to the airwaves MUST be read and approved before
transmission so as not to jeopardize my license - but we have the gateway
free-running from the airwaves to the Internet, so who knows?  We may see
some more hams using their radios to access lists like this one!

   Surely there are some more pipe-smoking hams out there - CQ CQ CQ?

   73 to all, and best wishes for a great holiday season!

I can't remember who makes it, but I saw a distinctly right-handed
pipe a few days ago.  Also it's left-hand counterpart.  If you use the
wrong hand, you'll cook yourself practically.  It ran about $400.00 or
so.  Had a deep bowl, and a nice grain, but seemed awfully heavy;
however, it looked like a nice "outdoor" pipe.

<a name="6">Subject: Pipe tobaccos</a>

        I just recently aquired a used pipe, a very interesting one to say
the least. Its got a leather "coating?" around the whole thing except the
inside and the part you put in your mouth (I know NO terminology, sorry!).
Does anyone have any ideas on how I can identify this pipe?

        Since this is my first pipe I am shopping around for some pipe
packing that I might like. I have no idea what to try and am looking for
some suggestions. I've seen at stores large bags of tobacco (rum smoked?
that one caught my eye) at Fred Myers and such but I didn't want to commit
to a large bag of the stuff especially if I found it especially repulsive.
Does anyone know where I can get some sampler tobaccos for the pipe? It
would be nice to have like several little baggies of say a pipe full that
you could experiment. This sort of thing probably does't exist however...
:)

Any suggestions on some good ones to try?

Micah

[ Well, I'd say try a nice mild aromatic cavendish to start... you're
definitely right not to buy a huge amount of tobak until you know your
own tastes. Most smokeshops would be happy to make up a sampler for
you. Among national brands, Amphora Blue, Sail, or Skandinavik would
all be good bets. And, re terms, I think "cover," "tobacco hole," and
"stem" are the coating, the inside, and the part you put in your
mouth, respectively. Though others might have a different preference

<a name="8">Subject: Greetings / Cigars / Handrolling?</a>

First off, my belated introduction to the list.  I've been reading for
a while now but never got around to introducing myself.  Anyhow, I'm a
student at the University of Texas.  I joined this list after hearing
about it during the rec.tobacco CFV.

I must confess that I was primarily interested in discussing quality
cigarettes rather than the more upscale stuff like pipes and cigars.
However, much of the talk on here has got me interested (see below).
Does anyone here roll cigarettes?  If so, what type of tobacco do you
like to use?  I am extremely fond of American Spirit.  It's amazingly
smooth, a handrolled AS goes down smoother than some "light" big-name
cigarettes.  Three Castles is nice, but expensive.  Very tasty, to
boot.

With all this talk about cigars floating by me, I decided to head down
to the tobacconist and see what it's all about.  I bought three
cigars: a Partagas (very small around, I think it was called "No. 1"
but not sure), a Arturo Fuente (I think this one was called "Gaucho",
it was bigger than the Partagas with a dark wrapper), and a generic
Jamaican with a light wrapper. The Jamaican was OK, but I liked the
darker cigars better.  The Partagas and the AF were both great.  I
tried these two based on the reccomendations I'd read here.  I don't
know what it's worth from a virgin cigar smoker, but I would heartily
second the reccomendation.  The AF was big, tasty, and cost only
$0.85.  It was a little hard to smoke, though, and toward the end it
was running rather badly and getting hot.  The Partagas was great too.
Tasted even better than the AF and didn't have any of the burning
problems.

So, I'm hooked.  My cigar-smoking experiment was thoroughly enjoyable.
Can anybody tell me what the cigars "representative" of the various
styles of tobacco are, so I can check them out too?

And sorry to the pipe smokers, but I don't think I'm quite ready to
have a go at that yet.  I have all the equipment I need for a stogie
(mouth) but I'd have to go buy a pipe to try pipe-smoking.

Hello All,

I have recently began enjoying the fascinating world of fine cigars.
What an incredible hobby! I am beginning to see that one can truly
enjoy and respect fine tobacco without abusing it, like I did for so
many years with cigarettes. I am truly enjoying all the good pipe and
cigar reports from you who are more seasoned in this world! Keep 'em
coming.

I've tried three good ones at this point. The first was an Arturo
Fuente. I believe it was Churchill sized. It was from the cheaper
Fuente line, in a natural wrapper, and it was a good, mild smoke.
Cost about $.70 as I remember. I then tried a Montesino, with natural
wrapper. At about $2.75 it was well worth the money...a mild and
flavorful smoke. The best yet, was an Arturo Fuente Flora Fina 8-7-8
in a maduro wrapper. This cigar was nothing short of delicious! Its
burn was completely even, and it held up all the way. I enjoyed it
down to about two inches, but I could have gone further with more
time. This is without a doubt the finest cigar I have smoked to date.
At $1.60, it is *well* worth twice that, IMHO.  It is the first one
that I have considered buying a full box of. Anyone else have any
experience with this cigar? If it gets any better than this, I cant
wait to smoke 'em!

Happy Holidays....a box of good cigars would make a wonderful
Christmas present....!

   Thanks for the prompt action on adding me to the group. I'm 39 yrs

I'm a system engineer but NOT a computer geek. Consider myself a

kick lately. Reading Cigar Aficionada really gets me in the mood. At
this time I'm fond of Onyx 750s or 650s and I just tried a Dunhill
that I loved but know little about. It was 6" with approx. 50 ring and
a natural wrapper. It was great. Looks like I should try Pauls in
Flint if its legendary since I live in the area. thanks again.

&gt;several good blends...Burlington Arcade is an old blend Holt's took
&gt;over, a flake cut easy to pack with nice flavor and aroma.Their
&gt;blend 101 is mild but very aromatic...a good beginners smoke.
&gt;Concerning Tobacco shop blends it has been my experience that they
&gt;are often too moist, I tend to leave several ounces spread out on
&gt;newspaper or in old baking tins to dry out, this gets some curious
&gt;looks in my office and we won't go in to what my wife has to say
&gt;about it at home.  I'm wondering if anyone out there has tried
&gt;drying out tobacco in an oven or if they would suggest or discourage
&gt;such an activity.  I prefer a dry tobacco I think it burns better
&gt;and makes for a more relaxed smoke.

At work we use a large oven to dry beakers, powders, etc.  When I
started here, the manager would empty his fresh tobacco into a large
size beaker and put it in the oven for ~10 min.  He then would add
alcohol to re-moisten it for smoking.  This process didn't remove
much of the flavorings he liked, it was still moist so it was easy to
fill a pipe, and the ethanol made it burn faster.

Another coworker kept peach brandy on the submarine he was stationed
on to moisten his tobacco.  At least once a week, the captain would
stop by to "see what we were smoking tonight."  After a chat, the
captain would go on with his rounds.  And who says you can't have
your whiskey and smoke it too?

Hi Everyone

	I'm just getting started on this newsletter, this is going to
be wonderful.  Well lets see a little about me.  Well I'm a chemistry
student at Boston University and just started smoking last year (both
pipes and cigars).  It started from curiosity (how can people like
burning a plant so much) and now I just plain love it.  I like larger
cigars ~50 ring and 7+ inches is nice (Avo, Glorias, Punch, Griffin,
are some of my favorite).  As for pipes I haven't quite developed and
attachements (for pipes or tobacco) yet and would love any
suggestions.

	Hey thanks a bunch :)

Hello Steve, et.al...

Enjoyed digest #123, and thought I would make some comments, and
also review some of the cigars I've tried lately.

But first..

Ron Nadel (?????@????.????????.???) says:

&gt;I am a Macanudo and Hoyo fan.  Been smoking Macanudos for over 15
&gt;years now.  I particularly love a smoke accompanied by a good Island
&gt;Malt Whisky (like Lagavulin or Laphroaig).  I prefer the ring sizes
&gt;around 50 and 6-8 inch in length.

I haven't really tried Macanudos, but Hoyas are a favorite; never
a dull smoke with them, that's for sure.  My SO thought Lagavulin
tasted like a dentist's office; I love Lagavulin - gofigure :)
I also love a fine cigar with a great bourbon.  I still have a
small bit of Maker's Mark Gold Top 101 left.  Too bad it's not
being made for American consuption anymore :( .  Maker's Mark
Red Top will have to do (it's excellent too).  I also prefer
larger ring sizes and 5-8" length.

&gt;I recently purchased a couple of 18 inch (! that's right !) Generals
&gt;(ring size 60).  Has anyone dared to try one of these yet.  I'm
&gt;waiting for a 5-6 hour stretch when I can sit down and light that
&gt;model up! 

Oh my lord..I have read about these and thought it was a misprint..
seems like one of these battleships would be an exercise in staying
power.  I have to admit that it would be *fun* though.

&gt;I have had a problem with a large percentage of my Hoyo Excaliburs
&gt;lately.  They do not burn evenly, and frequently unravel!  Is anyone
&gt;else experincing this difficulty?  Great flavor, but the construction
&gt;seems to be poor lately.

Hmmm, I haven't noticed this, but it has been a while since I've had
one.  I'm due for more soon; I'll be curious to see how they are.

----

David Chesler (???????@????.???????.???) wrote that he picked
up some Henry Clays...
I would be interested in knowing how you liked them (Henry Clay 
is one of the cigars that I'll be reviewing later in this tome).

&gt;And Marios H. Agrotes &lt;?????@??????.??????.???&gt; in response to: 
&gt;&gt;Any suggestions for other varieties I might enjoy?

&gt;says,

&gt;I have two suggestions for you: 1) Try some of the Honduran handmades;
&gt;they are generally more robust in taste, and closer to the old style
&gt;havanas.  Some of the best values right now IMHO, are the "Hoyo de
&gt;Monterrey" and "Punch" (actually made by the same factory) brands.

Powerful cigars that pack enormous flavor.

&gt;2) Try some of the higher quality, more complex, but still not very
&gt;heavy, Dominican handmades.  Two of the best lines in the world right
&gt;now (again IMHO), are the "Arturo Fuente" and the "Partagas" brands.
&gt;Try any of the thicker than 45 ring Fuentes, or the Partagas #10.
&gt;Sublime!!!

I agree completely!  I have not smoked a Fuente yet that I didn't 
thoroughly enjoy. 

----

I recently enjoyed some time off from the "how many lines of code can
one write per day" rat-race and spent a very relaxing long weekend in
Chicago.  Spent way too much on fine food, wine, jazz, cigars, and other 
decadent pleasures. (Any Mose Allison fans out there?)

A number of friends recommended that I check out the legendary Iwan
Ries &amp; Co. tobacconists.  Had a hell of a time finding the place (as
an out-of-towner, it's bad form to crane your neck up at the buildings,
so I don't - maybe if I had, I would've found the shop easier. They're
on the second floor of a tall building.)   Was worth it though.  Here
are the particulars (forgive me if this is old news):

Reviews:
[Disclaimer: Richness, flavor, and smoothness do it for me.  I'm   ]
[not necessarily looking for a "mild" smoke. Your mileage may vary.]

H. Uppman Churchill : 46 x 5.5" 
Thought I would say a few words about these; I had posted an address
a while back to get a nice box of them for cheap.  After smoking all
ten that I received, I must say that overall, an excellent cigar.  
Moist almost to the point of softness, they were flavorful and rich
with a draw that was at times perhaps too free.  A good firm ash (only
Fuente Hemingways are firmer in my experience).  My only criticism
was an occasional uneven burn. It's sometimes said that a soft cigar 
with a loose draw is an example of poor construction; I tend to
believe that it's more an example of freshness.  They certainly were
not "mushy".

Don Diego Conn. #300 : 44 x 5.5"
Very nice, not particularly special.  Got a bit harsh too early.

Henry Clay Breavas Conserva : 46 x 5.5"
A very pleasant surprise. Enormously smooth, but not wimpy either.
Tasty, tasty, tasty..I had to remove the label to finish it :) 
One of my more "relaxing" smokes..

Cabanas : 44 x 5.5"
A good solid, very rich cigar wrapped in blackened Mexican maduro with
Java, Dominican and Mexican binder (is it common to have a "blended"
binder like this?) Even burn and a free draw. Tasted great with port..

Davidoff Gran Cru #2 : 43 x 6" ($7.85 each!)
I've found it impossible to find Davidoffs in Milwaukee, so when I
saw these at Iwan Ries, I thought, "why not?".  A fabulous smoke - 
rich with lots of power and intense flavor.  While this was objectively
as good as I've ever smoked, it wasn't worth $3-4 more than anything
I've ever smoked either.  Ash was nicely firm, nearly snowy white,
but for some reason, at about the 2-3 inch mark, it began burning
very unevenly and continued to for quite some time.  A bit disapointing.

A final note..I've been finding it very difficult to find Fuente
Hemingway Classics lately - Edward's here in Milwaukee has been out
for a couple of months now, and it looked like they were running
low at Iwan Ries.  Is this happening all over?

Thanks for listening,

regards,

Hi, all,

Just a few holiday notes. Last weekend, I bought myself the Annual
Presents: A large Peterson sandblast Dublin with nickel shank, an
eight-pipe teakwood rack, the "`#(!&amp;*!$ Cigar'" book, and three
cigars.  This purchase was made at the smoke shop near Somerville
Circle, which was surprisingly well-stocked. If I can remember the
name, I'll throw it into the next Digest.

One of the three cigars was an Ashton maduro, which was a surprising
disappointment. _Very_ hard draw. But a different Ashton with a
lighter wrapper smoked fine.  Well, maybe it was a Bad Stogie Day...
The third is still waiting in my desk.

Also contacted a couple of the local organizations listed in the
Autumn Cigar Aficionado about cigar get-togethers. CCC had an
interesting idea - a casual Saturday afternoon meeting rather than the
formal dinner. Not being a tuxedo type, I appreciate that approach!
More info as it becomes available.

I'm off until January 3. Hope you and yours have a happy holiday, and
may your cigars draw easy, your pipes burn cool, and the smoke
encircle your head like a wreath. And if anyone should be so rude as
to demand that you put out your #(!&amp;*!$ Uppmann, just lean back, puff
thoughtfully, and let loose a merry reply:

	"No, and all God's blessings this holiday season."

					Smoke in peace,

<a name="2">Subject: Hello!</a>

Hello to all!  I was happy to see a list that was devoted to one of my 
favorite seductions.  I have been smoking cigars for 15 years and am 
always on the lookout for a reasonably priced quality cigar.  One 
thing I've noticed over the years is that the price of a good 
cigar has been going up quickly.  I remember buying good-sized 
Royal Jamaicans (when the were made in Jamaica!) for less than $1. 
 Those days are sure gone now.  I've been trying the new cigars: 
AVO, PG, Credo, Temple Hall, Oscar, PG, etc, and except for the Temple 
Hall, I don't think they're worth it, IMHO.  Most of them are too 
mild and characterless. I freely admit that I tend to like the 
bigger, heavy cigars.  Lately, I've been smoking Las Cabrillas, 
Troya (kinda mild 'tho), Canaria D'Oro, bundled Punch, Te Amos, and most 
recently Henry Clay.  After I smoked a Henry Clay, I went back and bought 
a bundle!  Good cigar.

After finishing the faq, I noticed that my favorite cigar store isn't on 
the list!  I'm not sure if they do mail order, but I've gotten excellent 
service from Duke and Josh at Draper's Tobacco here in DC.  I work downtown 
and after buying a cigar at Drapers, I sometimes walk a few blocks to 
Lafayette Park across from the White House and smoke my purchase after 
lunch. I could swear I once saw Bill wave at me from the window with a big 
Cohiba in his hand!  ;-)

Hi Steve
  de K3JSZ.  Picked up my Novice back in June of 59.  I may have
smoked a pipe or two by then.  I am a cw man, although I don't get on
now.
 
My first tobacco was good old Half &amp; Half.  I did not like it.
Smelled wonderful when others smoked it.  I went through various
brands always looking for something missing.  Flying Dutchman was
about the best I had tried back then.
 
Later, much later, I got into other tabacco.  A shop not too far away
in Allentown had various blends.  I guess my favorite type is Black
Cavendish.  Smokes cool, smellls great, and has no bite at all.
 
Many a bowl was smoked, poring over the bands with my Heathkit SB102,
looking for DX.  With a simple setup, bare rig, simple wire antenna,
not even a dipole, I got DXCC, WAS on 75 meters, I was into traffic
work, was a TCC 3rn rep, and ran a training net for awhile.  Field
day, and other contests were exciting for me.  My interest in cw
carried over into the service, I was in the US Army Security Agency,
as a morse intercept operator, from 1965 to 1968.  Served in Vietnam
and Japan.  Vietnam has no tobacco anyone would want to smoke as far
as I could see.  People used to give the houseboys, and other
labrorers, American ciggys, to keep them from smoking the water
buffalo dung they normally smoked.  It was bad.
 
I don't have any big name pipes, only two handmade ones, from the
fellow in Allentown.  Don't remember his name, his shop was in the
Whitehall Mall.
 
Herm

[ TNX FER QSL, Herm! WAS and DXCC on 75 with an end-fed wire? I'm
impressed!  Never got all the way to WAS myself, much less DXCC,
though my primary hamming was in the early seventies after things had
gotten a bit noisier. Ran a 40-meter dipole and later a Hustler 4-BTV
vertical. The rig was a Heathkit HW-101, barefoot. K3JSZ DE KF2IO K ]

<a name="5">Subject: Pipe Tobaks tried</a>

        Well in my never ending search for the most excellent pipe tobacco
(Ok, I just started...) I've tried the following and would like list
members to comment on their experiences and possibly make suggestions on
further venues to explore.

        The first package I picked up was Captain Black Royal, which comes
in a blue pouch and claims on the front, "America's #1 pipe tobacco." which
I beg to differ with. It is described on the front of the package as,
"aromatic black and golden cavendish, exceptionally mild, delightfully
aromatic." I will agree with the delightfully aromatic part - although it
had a horrible taste. I wouldn't mind burning it as inscense, but smoking
it is a chore. I believe that there was another "kind" of Captain Black at
the store which I claimed this one, I am not sure if I want to venture to
try that one right off.

        The second was much more pleasant. I am sorry that I don't have the
package with me, but I believe the name of the tobacco was, "Danish" it
came in a red pouch and was VERY smooth and relaxing. I found myself
wanting to pack a few more bowls of this fine brew after I'd finished.
Again I wish I had the package with me so I could give more details - I
hope to find this kind again, I had purchased it in California and am
afraid that my trip to the shop today will not unearth the golden leaves up
here... We shall see.

Has anyone else tried these types? Based on what I thought of the Captain
Black which types of tobacco should I avoid?

Much thanks,

Micah

[ I have to concur on the Captain Black. Danish? Maybe the "Danish" is
Skandinavik? -S. ]

For X-mas my wife got me a sampler box of Don Diegos, Uppmann, Henry Clays and 
Cabanas which sounds like what Martin Miller was trying also. All of them were
5.5" and approx. 45 ring. I agreed with him about the Henry Clay but I hated 
the Uppmann. It had a terribly tight draw and the wrapper was coming unraveled.
I am pleased to hear he had alot better experience and I'm going to try the
second one with an open mind. 
  I also tried a couple Arturo Fuente, double chauteau Fuente and they were
excellent. A full 50 ring with a great flavor and nice draw. Along with the 
sampler box, my wife also got me a Dow vintage port, 91. She was slightly put 
out that I couldn't drink it until at least the turn of the century but I'm 
looking forward to it. I think I'll crack it open when the first grand-child 
arrives.
  Hope everybody has a safe and enjoyable New Year.

Well, it's about two weeks late in coming, but I thought I'd introduce
myself to the group.  I'm a 23 year-old student at the University of
Texas at Austin.  From what I understand, my age and economic status
(i.e. young and poor) establishes me as not your typical cigar fan...but
that matters little.  I purchased my first pipe about 5 yrs. ago, and
have been smoking only occasionally ever since.  About 6 months back,
while in the tobacco shop for more "bourbon-vanilla", I ventured into
the humidor...my love affair with cigars began, and I have virtually
abondoned my pipe (a decent little Peterson)--sorry pipe fans :)

I have since rigged my own humidor (remember, I'm on a budget), and favor
Churchill-sized smokes.  Partagas No. 10 and Fonseca 10-10's are a staple
for me.  Both are very attractive, smooth, yet rich and flavorful.  I
occasionally have trouble with hard-draw and uneven burning in the 
Fonsecas though.  When money's tight or I want a little more "punch", I'm
also fond of several makes of Hoyo de Monterrey.

In addition to economic limitations, I must also adhere to a strict routine
of showers and mouth rinsing after smokes, which only take place outside
on an often windswept balcony.  I do these things to maintain peace in the
household--my wife has not yet come to admire the pleasure of a fine cigar
as I do.  I know, I know, I can hear the sad violins even now.

I saw some mention of Cubans in Mexico, or their scarcity.  While honeymooning
in Cabo San Lucas this summer, I smoked my only Cuban to date.  After
dragging my new bride around the dusty streets for a couple of hours searching,
we returned to the hotel where I found one in the gift shop.  It was
a small Romeo and Julieta (pettite?), and extremely dry--I steamed it while
in the shower (yes, I was desperate), but, needless to say, the expirience
was nothing special, although it did impove a little about halfway through.
As we waited in the small, hot airport for the return flight, I had my eye
on a box of R&amp;J Corona's in the duty-free shop--sadly, the owner must have
been on Mexican time as the shop never opened.  Of course, we breezed
through customs at home...what could have been :)

Okay, I've rambled enough...happy smoking all.

Hi!	Merry Christmass &amp; Joyeux Noel a tous!!

I've had the pleasure of having my first cigar on monday, the beginning of
an enjoyable hobby, I'm sure! Now.. I tried a $ 6.00 Cuban Troyo cigar, which
was very disappointing.. It left a pot aftertaste in my mouth, it simply
awfull. I tried as well a cigarillo (??), a small cigarette like cigar, from
davidoff. Now that was a pleasure and a half! It tasted fine and smelt smooth
and refined. At $2.25 (and considerably smaller than the vile Troyo) I imagine
a full size Davidoff would run me a few bucks more.. An investment well worth
indulging in...

I purchased my tobacco at a Montreal area store named H.Poupart, I'm not sure
if they have locations in the other two Canadian cities , it was a real treat
to see such a large quantite of cigars, pipe's and tobacco. I am beginning
to realize the potential expense of fine Cubans, has anyone experimented with
Manila products?? (Can't help thinking of marcos (and shoes))

If I can assist anyone with

opps.. Darn editor... 

If i can assist anyone in obtaining Cubans (via post or FedEx etc..) it would
be my pleasure. My only experience has been with a friend importing yeast for
his homemade beer (yeast and tobacco both being agricultural products). He
encountered some difficulty in the customs/

Greetings!  I'm glad to find this publication--it's great to hear from fellow
pipe smokers.  I am currently a seminary student at Gordon-Conwell Seminary
studying for the pastorate (Pipe smokers do come in all varities!), and am
really a novice at pipe smoking.  I would really like some help with one
issue:  How do I keep my pipe lit?  Am I supposed to keep lighting it every
two seconds, or is there a way to just puf and relax without having to
re-light?  I find that I have to smoke really hurridly in order to keep it
lit, which takes away from the enjoyment.  Any suggestions?

smokers with religious connections... witness Bing Crosby :-) Welcome!

I recently acquired America Online and remember your listing from one of the
pipe publications.

I have been smoking, collecting, for 10 years and have a collection of
Dunhills and Charatans.  Enjoy trading, although I've found this difficult to
find other willing to do so.

If you can help, please respond.

  I hope that my youthful excitement can be forgiven, but a freind of mine
and I received a wonderful gift from Bermuda over the Holidays-some Cuban
Upmann's to ring in the New Year.  The novelty of Cubans (my first) may have
added to my pleasure, but these were GREAT!  Certainly the finest I've ever
had.  If these were any indication of the quality produced there, the embargo
cannot end soon enough (IMHO).

Also, if I may add my two cents to the "Cuban debate".  I attempted to bring
a box of Cubans back from Gibraltar a few years ago and got snagged in
Customs.  While pleading my case, the officer said that the only ways to
bring Cubans into the U.S. was, not if they were for personal use, but if you
were a diplomat or if you were bringing them in "for a Cuban citizen" (nudge,
nudge, wink, wink).

Lastly, has anyone ever tried this??  Knowing tobacco's penchant for
absorbing outside odors, I began to put rum on the humidity element in my
humidor every now and again instead a moistening with water.  The cigars do
pick up the aroma and it doesn't seem to affect flavor (that I can notice
anyway).  I quite like it.  I use Goslings "Black Seal" rum, which has a real
gingery scent and taste.  Has anyone else ever tried to do smething like
this?

Hi, Steve!

I've left my position at OSSI to pursue a full time photography career.
It won't likely pay as well in the beginning, but my soul will be the
better for it, and my studio partner smokes, so the occasional pipe 
will be enjoyed between shoots!

I have established the netcom account from which you are receiving this

Hello Steve,
Well, Thanks for all of the good stuff.  I have been really overwhelmed.
 Hope you enjoyed the
Christmas issue of the A&amp;M Gazette.  I suppose I will have to start
thinking about the February 1994 issue soon.  Actually I have a new 256
grey scale scnnner which will result in a dramatic increase in the
number of photos in future issues.  I am also converting over from
express publisher to MS Publisher which is much better.  What did you
think of the latest Dirigible Pirates episode?  I note that in your
listing the A&amp;M Gazette is described as "different"  which probably
compares to the Hitchikers Guide to the Universe's description of Earth
as "Mostly Harmless."  BTW I have been reading a whole lot of William
Gibson (Differenc Engine, Mona Lisa Overdrive, and also Neal Steaphanson
- SnowCrash)  Which probably all indicates that I am off in some
cyberpunk phase -- hopefully not to some negative impactto the beloved
Pirates.
    Take care, Hope your new year is off to a good start with your new
Peterson.

<a name="15">Subject: composition of cigar tabacco</a>

Hello all of you,

In a message of in Pipes Digest 124, someone asked about the
composition of the tabacco in cigars. In most Cuban cigars and
some Mexican cigars this is only from one country (puros), but most
other cigars have tabacco from more than one country. The Dutch
cigars (and almost all European cigars) are perhaps different
(if not, please let me know).
These cigars are short fillers (so the tabacco is cut in
small peaces [2 - 12 mm long and no stems or vein]), and the 
tabacco comes from up to 15 regions (normally from some 5
regions/countries). The countries of tabacco used in Dutch cigars are:
Indonesia (Java, Sumatra), Brazil, Cuba, South Africa, Italy,
Columbia, Greece and US. 
In some of the cheaper cigars one uses the hominized tabacco
paper (this is paper made of cranulated tabacco, called HTL). 
But remember this is only in cheap cigars (and I think in a lot
of export-cigars;-)!!!

You can imagine that by using this much of different tabaccos
it is easy to blend the cigars in such a way that they are
smooth and mild. I think that is the stength of the Dutch
(European) cigar, the blending.

The humidity for smoking a Dutch cigars is in my opinion the
same as for Havana cigars (60 - 70%). The lower recommended humity
by manufacturers in Holland (50 - 60%), is in my opinion to
low, so that the cigars becomes more harsh.

I wonder if it is easy to get good cigars in other parts of the
world. Good Dutch cigars in Holland are: Huifkar, Balmoral,
Schimmelpenninck, De Olifant, Justus van Maurik, De Heeren van
Ruysdael, Oud Kampen, Hajenius, van der Donk (handmade)
(perhaps I have forgotten some;-).

If people are once travellig to Holland, and have some time,
perhaps I can enjoy with them some good Dutch cigars (if you of course
bring some good once from your own country).

All the best,

Victor

[ If ever in Holland, we'll make a point of stopping in with some
Amurrican cigars. Some nice White Owls, Phillies, or Hav-A-Tampas...
OUCH! Seriously, though, thanks for the note. I've tried
Schimmelpenninck and can confirm that they make a good small cigar.

Continuing Conundrum of Captain Black and his Lost Planet Pirates...

<a name="2">Subject: Cuban Connection</a>

On a Christmas trip to Edmonton, Alberta, I bought two
things that Canadians enjoy which we Californians do not:
good ice skates at a reasonable price and Cuban cigars.

It was a hurried trip, but after visiting four tobacconists
(damn there are a lot of them in Edmonton!) I found some
Monticristo coronas. They needed a few days to rehydrate,
but the first one I've tried was very nice. It drew well,
had a full, smooth flavor, and was a nice smoke.

However, at least for this batch of Montecristos, I'd have
to say they are a novelty smoke. Soon afterwards I had an
Arturo Fuentes that knocked my socks off. At least
I can now say I've tried those Commernist Seegars.

P.S.: The skates are nice ;-)

<a name="3">Subject: Re:  Pipes Digest #125 - January 10, 1994</a>
	
	The first package I picked up was Captain Black Royal ...

I don't want to sound like a snob.  I really don't.  But think about it
this way:  would you expect much of a cigar that is sold in 7-11?  A
wine? Would you buy a match rifle at K-Mart?

Captain Black is the Taylor California Cellars of pipe tobacco.  Smells
pretty, and so loaded with artificial preservatives that it will be 
around with the Twinkies long after we're all gone.

When the pockets are empty, or when you're stuck away from a tobacconist,
you might find yourself buying grocery store brands.  But they're just
not the same as the real thing.  They're also frequently very bad at
depositing thick layers of tar in your pipe -- fine if your pipe is
also from the 7-11, with a filtre to keep it from  drawing right up 
into your mouth, but a cruel thing to do to a good pipe.

Maybe it's a bit of missionary spirit, but I think you might really 
enjoy picking up a bit of English -- Balkan Sobranie, Dunhill Standard
Mild, or a good clone -- and give it a try.  It can be harsh if you
smoke it too quickly, but it can be really worthwhile.
	
	...  About 6 months back,
	while in the tobacco shop for more "bourbon-vanilla", I ventured into
	the humidor...my love affair with cigars began, and I have virtually
	abondoned my pipe (a decent little Peterson)--sorry pipe fans :)
	
Once again, my flesh creeps a bit.  Bourbon-vanilla tobacco is like
General Foods Cafe Irish Creme -- an interesting confection, but not the
real thing.  There are a lot of very good natural tobaccos out there,
so don't give up on your pipe.

And natural pipe tobacco might not smell as sweet and pretty as the 
flavoured stuff, but it is easier for a non-smoker to take than 
cigar leaf.	
	
	[ Manilas? Now there's a thought... any other experiences? -S. ]
	
A lot of good cigars have just too much nicotine for my system, and
for my pipe-smoker puffing habits.  I have found that there are a lot
of good Filipino cigars which are very delicate in flavour and in
smell, and without the same nicotine shock of, say a Cuban.
	
Reminiscent in some ways of a Villiger, without the square-cut 
regimentation.

Cheers,

Aryk Nusbacher

[ Editorial extrusion: Your mileage, and tastes, will probably vary.
Personally, I have nothing against the cased Cavendishes, especially
if they smell nice to the non-smokers. See Neil Flatter's letter
below. Others? -S. ]

I must respond to Edward Clark III's suggestion to moisten a humidor
with rum.  An excellent idea!  I frequently moisten myself with
Gosling's Black Label, and the effects are quite encouraging -
combined with a decent stogie and something old and mellow on the CD
player.

On another subject, please reveal more on the "Agricultural &amp;
Mechanical Gazette". Is this an on-line publication, or a veritable,
published publi- cation?  I ask, because as a specialist in the
history of lighter than air flight at the National Air and Space
Museum, I'm strangely moved by the sound of the Dirigible Pirates - I
yearn to hear more!

From: Steve Masticola (????????@??.???????.???)
<a name="6">Subject: Agriculture, Mechanics, and the Dirigible Pirates</a>

Well, the story goes like this. Norm Carpenter was in NYC on business
for a couple of days, so I met him for dinner and a pipe at La Bonne
Soupe. (It wasn't the night the NY Pipe Club meets, so we had to do
the smoking outside of the restaurant, along with a little
exploration.) For some reason or another, I mentioned a slightly
strange-of-center bimonthly pipe lore magazine called "The
Agricultural and Mechanical Gazette", in which the Internet Pipes
Mailgroup has been listed for the last two issues. It's edited by Neil
Murray, and well worth the price of $15/year for club and convention
news, as well as the, er, "different" Dirigible Pirates stories.

Norm asked me, quite reasonably, why a pipe journal would have a name
like "The Agricultural and Mechanical Gazette." Rather than
paraphrase, I'll repeat the whole story, from Vol. 2 Issue 4, December
1990, p. 2.

"Many of our readers have written in asking questions. Questions such
as, "Where is the 'Great North Woods?', 'Who are these Dirigible
Pirates?', and 'What does it all really mean?'

"Various explanations have been offered from time to time, both by the
informed and also by the uninformed. At long last, this is an attempt
to set the record straight. Consider it a sort of Christmas present,
from us, to you.

"The story of the Dirigible Pirates, which has been accepted by most
people as a work of fiction, is in fact an historical account of
future events. That is to say, when the future becomes the past, and
the present becomes irrelevant, the story of our Pirates will become
an accepted part of our cultural and historical baggage. Suffice it to
say that when the Clean Air Police grab our society by the throat,
wrenching our pipes from between our clenched teeth, a few brave men
and women will take refuge in a place which will become known as, 'The
Great North Woods.' Anticipating their (the Pirates') need for a camp
newsletter, _The Agricultural and Mechanical Literary Gazette_ was
founded -- well in advance of their actual need! (The word 'Literary'
was eventually dropped from the title for reasons which are no longer
of interest - and we can't remember anyway.) As the title implies, the
objective of the _Gazette_ is to inform and entertain the readers
since anything of interest to a Dirigible Pirate - being folks of
simple needs - can be categorized as either agricultural or
mechanical. We initially envisioned that the _Gazette_ would be packed
with informative articles about pipes, tobaccos, the social news of
our cohort, the historical chronicle of the pirates, the husbandry of
small cereal grains and their conversion through fermentation into a
more transportable form, horticulture, the repairs of old pipe
friends, practical machine tools and material sciences. Much of this
has been accomplished and much remains ahead of us.

"And, finally, what does it all mean? We don't know. If we did, maybe
we would be writing for the _Harvard Business Review_ instead."

Hi there.

You might remember me from my earlier addres at the "andrew.cmu.edu"
site.  I've now moved to working full time here in Pittsburgh, so
please add me to the list at this new address. Thanks.

I mostly smoke cigarettes (Nat Sherman's "Virginia Circles", "Three
Caftles" handrolling), but when I get a chance I like to pack my briar
and sit around lounging.

While I was home for the holidays, I had occasion to be in New York
city for about a half an hour as I walked from Penn Station to Grand
Central. As I walked, I window shopped absent mindedly. Eventually, I
passeda rather nice looked shop with pipes in the window. I looked up
to the marquee and realized that I was *there*. It was the Nat
Sherman's *store* on Fifth Avenue in New York.

Walking in was an experience to remember. I assume that this store is
approximately 60 years old, and it's still run like a 1930's
gentleman's shop. Lot's of wood cabinets and glass. In addition to the
full line of cigarettes, there was a wonderful selection of pipe
tobacco and a large selection of acoutrements like walking sticks,
cigar and cigarette cases, and flasks. Also, all of the three salesmen
was dressed in suits! The place really radiates the kind of class
that tobacco *used* to have in this country before the advent of
Marlboro and Camel indutrial commercialism. The humidor (which I
unfortunately did not have time to browse) was *upstairs* on the
second floor.

Since I already had a box of cigarettes in my pocket, I just bought a
bag of Golden Virginian pipe tobacco so that I could get *something*
in this wonderful store. I'm not sure why I was so impressed, but
since I didn't expect to see anything of value during that short time
in the city, I guess it's just a pleasant suprise that I'll remember
for a while.

A little bit more for a future digest.  My name is Barry Schenker and
I live in Buffalo, yes the home of the Bills.  I've already read the
back issues you sent and I would like to compliment you and everyone
on the job they do.

I saw you listed in Tom Dunn's 1992 listing of pipe collectors.

About tobacco - there have been alot of questions about various
tobaccos.  For all your subsribers, I stongly recommend getting a
listing of Barry Levin's Personal Reserve tobaccos and trying some.
Although some may consider them expensive, they're well worth it.
Also, Brebbia (yes the pipe manufacturer), just introduced a line of
tobaccos as well as Butera, another pipemaker. They are all an
excellent line of Virginia or English type tobaccos.  Levin also
carries a line of aromatics.

I smoked English for years, but got tired of all the complaints, so
smoke them at home.  Virginias are my choice when I'm in the office or
out.  i have found several which are close enough to English that they
serve well in crowds.

Reading about all the cigars makes me want to go over to Canada and
pick up some Cuban cigars although last time I tried some, they seem
to have lost quite a bit in quality.

Kepp up the good work.

Edwards store.  Caution - can be difficult to work with sometimes.

[ Some of these are in the Resource Guide already, but I'll include
the ones that aren't. -S. ]

  Cubans in Windsor, Ontario?
With all of the cigar discussion lately (and I thought this was a Pipes
list :-}  ), I was wondering if any of you around Detroit or Windsor can
recommend a good shop in Windsor that carries a selection of Cuban cigars
that won't cost me an arm and leg and...?  I get to Detroit on business
quite a bit, and Windsor is just across the tunnel.
    Thanks,

   In #124, J. Mark Jones mentioned that he smoked an Arturo Fuente 8-7-8 and
loved it. He was looking for some other opinions on it and since I had my 
first 8-7-8 last night I though I'd toss in my two cents. I also liked it very
much and for $1.50 ea. it was a real bargain. It was quite firm with a nice 
even burn. It wasn't hot at all and I too smoked it down to the last. I prefer 
larger cigars but for a nice quick smoke, I highly recommend it.

Hello All,
enjoyed a decent Arturo Fuente Numero One today at lunch. I think the
guy at the smoke shop called it a "longsdale". The wrapper was dark
brown maduro (my favorite). It was a decent smoke. Not as good as the
8-5-8 (wonderful!). I noticed that the ash didn't burn nearly as
white as the 8-5-8. Is a good white ash the sign of a good wrapper,
possibly? It was a bit harsh until a little better than halfway, and
it smoothed out. I believe I will stay with the 8-5-8 (they were out
of them :-( ). Smoke shop guy has more 8-5-8's on the way, and also
some Fuente Hemingways. Now here's one I can't wait to try. Martin
Miller likes 'em and that's good enough for me! The smoke shop guy
highly recommends them. The guy tells me he is selling a ton of
good cigars, and the guy tells me he will soon install a walk-in-
humidor. Its funny, I don't *see* that many people smoking cigars...
but their seems to be almost Renaissance of cigars and pipes
happening.

Read an article the other day about life on the road with one of my
favorite singer song-writers-Billy Joel. Said he carries boxes of
Palmas cigars on the road. I didn't figure the Piano Man for a stogie
smoker. Anyone ever heard of/tried these?

Rush Limbaugh stated on his show a couple of days ago that he thinks
the Hoyo De Monterrey Double Corona (Cuban) is the finest cigar on
the face of the earth. Anyone know about this cigar? I'd love to try
it.

Question: Give me some hints on cutting the cigar. Smoke shop dude
sold me a $2 gizmo that looks like a little guillotine. Doesn't do a
very clean cut. Are you supposed to go for a small, neat drawing hole
while maintining the rounded end of the cigar? He said "I just cut
the end off...." But I like that rounded end, it seems the cigar
could get messy if you tear up the end very much. Also Steve, I hear
that there is a FAQ and a How-to-Guide. Would you be so kind as to
send them to me?

Thanks! May Good Cigars and Pipes come your way!

<a name="16">Subject: Misc</a>

RE: poor student not a typical cigar fan

I first started smoking cigars while in college, when a friend of mine
who worked in a tobacco shop introduced me to a few free samples.  I've
been enjoying fine cigars ever since.  Most of my friends in college
also enjoyed the occasional cigar, so I do not believe you are a rarity.

RE: composition of cigars

This same friend dissected several cigars for me, some good and some not 
so good, to show me how they are constructed and how to identify the better 
cigars.  It was my understanding that most good Caribbean cigars are composed 
of tobacco from a single plantation, not blends (as are many or most of the 
European's).  The finest ones will have no stems or seeds, and an all-natural 
tobacco wrapper.

Bad cigars, from the US, will have an abundance of stems of seeds; I 
think sometimes that they just uproot the whole plant, run through a
grinder/mulcher, and call it tobaccey.  They are wrapped in paper, which
burns hot, unevenly, and tastes lousy.  Typically, but not universally,
'hand made' or 'hecho a mano' is synonymous with an all-tobacco wrapper.
If there are non-tobacco elements, it is usually a machine made cigar.

An anomaly is Backwoods smokes (please don't shoot me for mentioning
them!), which are indeed all tobacco, including the wrapper, but have
an abundance of stems and seeds and are machine made.  They are the
best cigar you will find in grocery/dime stores, but that isn't saying
much.

RE: Lingering odors, domestic tranquility

I was grandfathered.  I smoked cigars before I met my SO, and there was
never any mention of stopping.  She does not mind the aroma of a good
cigar.  This is a serious consideration when choosing to take on smoking,
or an SO, as I know some people for which this has been a very divisive issue.

RE: Humidors

Whilst poor students in college, I know of some folks who used old
non-defrosting refrigerators as makeshift humidors.  If the seal is intact,
the ability to 'chill' is irrelevant.  Such items can frequently be had
at bargain prices, if you're on a budget.  Else, a good small-to-medium
hardwood humidor should be had for around $50.  You can pay much more,
for much larger, if you like.  Be careful that whatever humidifying
element you insert, that there is no loose moisture on it.  If it's a
strip, after wetting the element, pat the outsides dry.  If it's one of
those little cylindrical gizmos (?), make sure it's not dripping, and
the exterior is dry.  I made this mistake early on, and it resulted in 
a slight warpage of the top of my humidor, revealing about a 1/16" space.
It isn't totally ruined, but it definitely degrades the ability to keep
the contents moist.

RE: High prices for Cuban's in Canada

I suspect much of this is due to the exhorbitant tobacco taxes in Canada.
We'll catch up to your prices, probably soon. :-(

Since you have a large subscriber network, you might want to find out if
anyone would like to send pictures of pipes across the network.

I have many that I've scanned.  I have a Mac and would like to try sending
someone a picture(s) if anyone's interested.

Just have them send an E-Mail and let me know what format it should be sent
in.  I will reduce the pictures so the files are small, so they'll need a way
to enlarge them.  I think I can translate them into IBM format(s) if one of

&gt; the Hoyo De Monterrey Double Corona (Cuban) is the finest cigar on

I kind of think he said that because Cigar Aficianado said it. Two weeks
ago I was amazed that a tobacconist I visited had one for sale. He got
it from a company that I _know_ had sold out of them before CA's review.
These would therefore be from a new shippment from Cuba. It was an
excelent cigar - rich, sort of a more stylish version of an Arturo
Fuente Hemmingway (which I just had last night, BTW... _really_ good.)
but not the best cigar I've ever had; That would be the Romeo &amp; Julieta
Churchill. I wonder if my taste just dosen't match CA's, or if some
producers compromise quality for quantity once a good review comes out.
Remember, these producers are all owned by the Cuban government; they
don't have quite the incentive to maintain a reputation the way a
Chateau Petrus does. If other readers have tried this cigar I'd be
interested in their opinions.

Hey Steve!

I just caught #124-#126 all in one shot (they all came to my mailbox while I
was on vacation), and I think it's about time I introduce myself.  My name is
Bruce Morris, I'm a student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York,
and I am a four-year veteran cigarette/cigar smoker who has just recently
ventured into the world of pipe smoking.  (In fact, I must confess, I just did
my first bowl about an hour ago!)

While I'm sure as hell not a veteran, I want to agree with Micah in Pipes
Digest #125, who complained about the taste of Captain Black Royal.  Micah,
let me tell you: Captain Black Gold is no prize either!  My tongue felt numb
after about ninety seconds with that blend (and I am a regular Camel smoker
who enjoys occasional Dunhills and even more occasional Phillies!), and I
couldn't taste the cup of coffee I drank after that!  Someone, please suggest
a better brand!  (And tell me if this problem might have something to do with
the fact that this pipe is far from broken in! (They do mellow, right?)

Also, I think my first choice of pipe might not have been the greatest.  I'm
currently using a Dr. Grabow Omega, a filtered pipe which I'm afraid to clench
in my teeth because the stem has an annoying habit of separating from the bowl
(which is how you change the filter, of course).  Will that get better over
time?  And how often do you change the filters?

Thanks in advance, all!

Well, it's starting to look like Esoterica Tobacciana has gone
out of business.  None of my local pipe shops in Columbus, Ohio
has any of their tobacco left in stock, and the guy who imports
the stuff isn't returning calls.  I've managed to put aside a
small stock of these, but I'd like to get more before these
blends disappear from everywhere in the country.

The Esoterica Tobacciana blends are pricey (but worth it)
English blends in tins (and half-pound packages) with a white
label.  Has anyone seen these blends in your local smoke shop?
If you've seen them, I'd greatly appreciate if you'd give me the
name of the shop, and (if possible) their phone number.

Many people on the list have probably experienced this before: a
favorite blend goes the way of the mastodon, and you've only got
a tin or two to last you the rest of your life.  I'd like to grab
as many of these as I can before it's too late.  Please reply by

Steve - 

Just got your intro and first issue of the diges, really enjoyed it!

I'm 28 and run an insurance office in St. Petersburg, FL.  I've been enjoying
cigars for about three years.  Until Cigar Aficionado, and now Pipes Digest,
I thought the only people smoking cigars were old Cuban gentlemen in Ybor
City (Tampa), new fathers, and myself.  Maybe it is a vestige of herd
mentality, but it's great to know you are not alone.

J. Mark Jones asked about cutters.  Edward's Pipe &amp; Tobacco in Tampa, (813)
872-0723, offer a cutter they have made locally.  It's called an El Toro and
is a combination of a bullet cutter and a sharpened, spring loaded, drill bit
which acts as a piercer.  I know it sounds strange, but it works great. 
Gives a nice clean hole, with a good draw and it is easy to clean.  The whole
thing is in a two piece wood tube that is about three inches, so it is easy
to carry in your pocket.  Sells for about twenty bucks.  (No, I don't own
stock)  I used a V cut for a while, but I tend to chew on the end of the
cigar and would loose my draw with the V.

Cigar Aficionado has given great ratings to La Gloria Cubana,  made in Miami.
 I wasn't able to find any in tobacco stores and all the mail order houses
were "out of stock."  Finally, a friend was able to pick some up at the
factory, while in Miami on business.  Boy was it worth the wait!!

Upon arrival they were very "green" , but after a month or so in the humidor
they were fantastic.  Snow white ash, even burn, and spicy flavor that makes
you want to smoke two at a sitting.  I've tried the Coronas, Churchills,
Robustos, Double Coronas, and Torpedos and they have all been excellent. 
Question is, has anyone else tried them?  I'm wondering if they are really as
good as I think or if it is simply the trouble I went throught to get them
that is playing tricks on my head.

Also, does anyone smoke Cuba Aliados?  If so, how about a review.

Thanks for the digest, hope to hear from you soon.

<a name="8">Subject:      Smoke, if you got 'em</a>

Hello All,
Just a couple of short shots....

Both of these came from Rush Limbaugh (I confess I am a ditto-head).
Rush is quite knowledgable about cigars and discusses them, and Cigar
Aficiado quite frequently on his show.

President John F. Kennedy was a cigar man. On the eve of the Cuban
embargo, he sent his top aide out to buy up as many Cuban cigars as
he could find. Rush says he brought some 1200 to the Pres.

Winston Churchill usually smoked about 10 cigars a *day*! Of course,
the churchill size (which I suppose is a bit subjective) comes from
those big suckers he smoked. I can't imagine smoking 10 a day. 'Course
its hard to believe I used to do two packs of Marlboro or Winston
regulars, and more if I stayed up late. Give me a good cigar once or
twice a week, and I will be a happy camper!

BTW-Pipes List is fantastic....I've come to really look forward to it
each week. Thank you very much Steve, you are a gentleman and a
scholar!

Hi,
     As I have just come in to work after a visit to "The Smoker" in
Albany, NY and then found the latest digest waiting for me, I thought
it would be a great time to relate some of my recent experiences and
thoughts on matters relating to lady nicotine.

"THE SMOKER"
I have been a customer of Mel Feldman, "The Smoker" proprietor, since
1980, when I started college in Albany.  He moved to his current
location at 136 Washington Avenue (a block and a half from the Capitol)
soon afterwards, and I continued frequenting his store since then.

He is not only a master blender of pipe tobacco and an all-around expert
on all pipe-related things, but also a very good conversationalist with
many interests, (every time I go there, I stay two-three hours) and stocks
an excellent collection of new and estate pipes at very fair prices, in
all ranges.  His walk-in humidor is not very big, and neither is his
cigar selection, (even though he has a few sizes each of the "major" brands)
but that is more than made up for by his thousands of excellent pipes.

I usually buy an estate pipe from him around new year's (this year I
was late) and on my birthday.  Today I bought an excellent "Ben Wade"
Danish freehand from the "Autumn" series.  Nice amber stem.  Can't wait to
go home to fire it up.
This is the fourth or fifth "Ben Wade" Danish freehand I bought in a row
from him.  They have all been excellent.  Almost as good as my Dunhill
"Shell" in smoking quality, and vastly more beautiful!

He is also always looking to buy used pipes, so if you wanna get rid of
anything...

"The Smoker's" hours are 8:00 AM-5:30 PM Mon.-Fri. and 9:00 AM-1:00 PM Sat.

"THE ULTIMATE CIGAR BOOK"
A week ago I finished reading Richard Carleton Hacker's "The Ultimate
Cigar Book."   Although much shorter than his "Ultimate Pipe Book,"
(around 250 pages versus 400), it is very informative and very well
written.  It talks about the history of cigars, the process that takes
tobacco from seed to finished cigar, how to choose and how to smoke a
good cigar, accessories like lighters, humidors, cutters, cases, etc.
and which spirits are good with which cigars. His last chapter is a
list of all of the world's cigar brands/factories that he could get
information on.

He does not rate individual cigars, using only his own "HPH" (Highly
Prejudicial Hackerscale from 1 to 3) rating, for cigars' intensity of
flavor.
I think he is a little too "diplomatic," as if he doesn't want to offend
anyone (like "Stereo Review's" approach to reviewing equipment).
He even finds merit to many mass-produced, homogenized leaf cigars.
(Or at least that's the implication, since he does not slam those
foul- looking, tasting, and smelling cardboard contraptions.)
I would have much preferred a blind-tasting rating system a-la "Cigar
Aficionado," or even a personal preference scale like the one
Michael Jackson uses in his excellent "Guide to Single Malt Scotch!"
(Both scales go to 100.)  Oh, well..

So, even though the book didn't tell me anything I didn't know already
(or seen someplace else in the past), it was still appreciated for its
nice style, good pictures and the gathering of all that interesting
information in one place.  A "Must Have," for beginner and veteran alike.

CUBAN CIGARS
Coming originally from Europe, and visiting there frequently, I have had
the good fortune to experience Cuban cigars since the age of sixteen.
(I quit smoking cigarettes at age twelve, after a brief experiment;
I knew even at that age, (lack of) quality. :-} I still drink wine though,
which I liked a lot since I was six.)

In general, I am of the opinion (that I wasn't the first to express, I'm
sure) that even with the relatively recent (last ten years or so) consistency
problems of the Cuban cigars, THE BEST CUBAN CIGAR IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE
BEST NON-CUBAN CIGAR.  Of course, there is a great spectrum of different
qualities among Cuban handmades, and except for the top 10%, for every Cuban
handmade, you can find a better non-Cuban cigar for one fifth to one tenth
the price.  (For example, IMHO, you'd have to spend $8 to $15 on a Cuban cigar
to beat the quality of the Arturo Fuente 8-5-8, $1.20 mail-order, and my
current price/quality champion.)  So, if you are going to buy a Cuban cigar,
it's worth it to buy only the best.  A "Cohiba," or a big "Hoyo," "Romeo Y
Julieta," "Partagas," "Punch," or "Montecristo," even at $30 to $50 MAY
be worth it to some people, because you can't get an equal quality for
less.  But don't waste your money on the cheaper Cubans.  Buy 5 to 10
Dominican "Arturo Fuentes" or  Honduran "Hoyos" for the same money
instead!

"ARTURO FUENTES 8-5-8"
I've decided that I consider the "Arturo Fuente 8-5-8" my favorite
all-around cigar.  Oh, sure, a "Partagas #10" or "Excalibur #1" or
"JR Ultimate Double Corona" or "Arturo Fuente Hemingway" will give me much
more pleasure after a rich dinner or a specific Single Malt.  But on other
occasions those cigars can feel heavy and even a little harsh.
Not the "8-5-8!" It pleases me much more consistently (much less
variability in the pleasure I derive from it) than any other cigar. If the
above premium cigars let's say, ranged in pleasure from a 80 to a 97,
depending on the circumstances of the smoke, the "8-5-8" ranges only
from 87 to 92.
Make of that what you may!  That's my way of conceptualizing my
preferences in cigars.  Your milage may vary.

Smoke in peace,

Marios H. Agrotes

P.S.  Mel Feldman of "The Smoker" told me that some publisher in Buffalo
      is preparing a "cigar" magazine for publication, to compete with
      the "Cigar Aficionado!"  This new magazine, will reportedly be much
      more amenable to including articles about pipes than Shanken's "CA" is.

[ Wow! What a lot of great information! Thanks, Marios! -S. ]

I thought I'd share this with the Pipes list

If the tobacco in my pouch starts to feel a little
dry, I sprinkle a few of drops of water directly onto
the tobacco, then mix it up. This seems to keep the
tobacco  properly moist and doesn't seem to damage it.

Hello Steve,
    Once again, thanks for promoting the Agricultural and Mechanical
Gazette.  If Allan Janus will email me his address, I will send him a
sample copy.  The number of subscribers has been steadily increasing
over the years, five years in publication now, and it has been a long
strange trip for our pirates.  Yes Allan, as an Air &amp; Space guy, you
might find the story interesting.  I must warn everyone that the story
has "some" satire and does tend toward the Richard Brautigan/Douglas
Adams/John Barth kind of strangeness.  The dirigible's computer by the
way uses magnetic core memory for ballast, which being ferrite works
quite well except when they dump ballast for altitude, which causes some
memory problems, but perhaps not unfamiliar to those who lived in PDP-11
land, or have tried tacking an OS/2 machine to a Novelle network.
    BTW we do cover a fair bit of the pipe news from the Hungarian pipe
clubs (and there is a lot of it) - we have a virtual monopoly in this
area.
   Captain Black, by the way is a Lane Limited tobacco and is the most
popular of commercial blends.  They, Lane also sell it in bulk as BCA
which most pipe shops carry under various names.
    take care,  Neil

<a name="13">Subject: Clippers and such</a>

Perhaps I am stressing on the little things in life-grad students tend to do
that-but, I've always taken the clip of my cigar quite seriously.  One of my
leading critria for enjoyment is a cigar's draw.  If a cigar is not drawing
well it can almost be a chore to smoke, and a cigar's clip plays a big role
in draw.  My experiences with clipping began as Mark's did, with a small
$2.00 clipper that left a very ragged cut on one side of the cigar which
tended to flake apart as time went by and generally promoted unravelling of
the cigar.  I then moved up to a more expensive but, more effective clipper
that cut from but sides and left a very nice edge.  The beauty here is that,
unlike the $2.00 clipper, this one had a much larger opening, and could clip
even the largest ring gauges, and the clean edge didn't encourage
unravelling.  I, then, thought I'd seen everything when, on my first visit to
Leavitt and Peirce, they had a desk-top clipper at the register that gave a
very nice V-shaped cut.  The theory here is that it doesn't compromise the
wrapper and there is almost no chance for unravelling to occur.  It also
leaves "the rounded end" rounded.  At Leavitt's, they had hand clippers that
would make these V-shaped clips, but I didn't pusue this afterwards because I
really prefer the "customizing" you can get with the two-bladed hand clipper. 
There are a number of cigars, Avo's "Pyramide" and "Belicoso's", that put a
taper on the end to allow for different clips. But if you're careful you can
change the draw of almost any cigar to your preference.

Also, keep the snappy come-backs coming.  I had recent occasion to use one
while relaxing with close friends and a Machanudo "Portfino" at The Capital
Grille in Providence.  Not only did I have to withstand the hatpin jokes of
my friends ("Portos" are long and thin).  But the woman behind me just
wouldn't stop with the glancing comments.  So, since The Grille is listed in
Afficianado as "cigar friendly" I felt I had the green light to reply with
the "sight of someone enjoying themself" line. It was quite effective and I
certainly want to reference to proper sources.

  Was in my local smoke shop last night and noticed they are now carrying 
a brand called Zina. They look like a Davidoff (even the band looked the same).
I thought I saw the name Davidoff on the box and they certainly had the same 
price range; up to 7.50 ea. Can you or someone tell me something about them.
In the winter issue of CA, there was an ad for them but not much was said. If 
they are worth the money, can anyone suggest which of the numerous one that 
I should try? I ended up getting an Arturo Fuente numero2. I've never seen 
this one before but so far I haven't had an AF that disappointed me.

Yes, that's right, it's down from 214 last issue. The circulation does
drop sometimes, as Digests bounce with "User unknown" errors, and we
had no new members this week. And the weather on the East Coast
continues to be, ah, suboptimal, unless you're a road-salt salesman.
(Good for a quiet smoke and a good book, though.)

But take heart -- this time, we do have a significant amount of news
on the subject of -- yes, Norm -- pipes!

Wow:  A pipe smoking question.  (Feigned look of shock as our hero
wades through 2000 messages about cigars. :-)  )  

Anyway,  I've found the best way to deal with tobacco dry out in the
pouch is to buy a button himidfier.  This is similar to what you would
put in your humidor when storing the tobacco, but is small enough to
stay in your pouch.

Now,  back to cigars.  Not to offend any of you guys but -- well --
Sheesh!  What are you guys?  Maschochicts  uh? Massochists um? Machss-
Crazy?  I was lulled in to a false sense of security by all your wonderful
messages on the list and went out and bought myself a few stogies.  Sheesh!
I had one on the way home and kept wondering why the car was spinning whilst
I didn't even turn the wheel?!?!  Good lord,  I think I like my pipe better.
I do find cigars good --- for when I've run out of pipe tobacco and am 
stranded without money and no one is around to borrow off of and a major
flood has hit and we've just had another earthquake.  Yes,  that's a good
time to start a cigar.  I did notice that the cigar was a bit on the dry
side (leaf flakes coming off during the smoke).  How do I go about 
putting life back into the leaf?  Also,  I never cut the end off the cigar,
I just put a hole in the end to allow for a draw (Is this why they made 
me want to kiss the ground).)?  

Where's Thacker been through all this cigar talk anyhow?  I'm going to have
to order that crazy magazine just to get some decent tobacco stories to
pass around at the campfire.

Smoking safely with a stem....

    (Bruce Michael Morris) let me tell you: Captain Black Gold is no

Balkan Sobranie.  Worth every penny.

	(And tell me if this problem might have something to do with
	the fact that this pipe is far from broken in! (They do
	mellow, right?) 

A tobacconist once suggested to me that I mix some honey and some 
cigarette ash, and coat the inside of a non-carbonised bowl; then 
bake the pipe (without the stem) in a hot oven until the stuff caramelizes.
So I've done that with a few pipes, and I can't complain.  Also, a
trick I learned from my dad is to alternate full and half bowls with
a new pipe.

	Also, I think my first choice of pipe might not have been the
	greatest. I'm currently using a Dr. Grabow Omega...

So there you are in Troy, NY.  First thing you do is go down to the Smoker
in downtown Albany and get a good, inexpensive pipe.  If you are willing
to pony up a few dollars, you can get a piece of good briar that might
have a few fills in it here and there; but will smoke decently well.
Ask the guy about tobacco, and sample a few.  Get some little packets to
take home and decide what you like.  Stick with the house blends -- 
an honest tobacconist sells his own blends (and custom blends) for less
than the mass-market equivalent.  And ask the guy there for advice.

And save the Dr. Grabow for a backup emergency pipe in case of earthquake.

Re moistening a humidor element with rum:  I seem to recall that alcohol
is a dessicant, and that while half (or so) of the rum is water and sugar;
the rest might be damaging your cigar.  Take the rum in the way God

there's a lot less of me than there was of Winnie.  Given sufficient
cash, sufficient availability of tobacco, and sufficient freedom; I could
probably go through an equivalent weight of pipe tobacco in a working 
day to Winnie's 20 cigars.

It is extremely frustrating to find a tobacco one really likes and then 
see it suddenly disappear.  In Washington D.C. a couple of years ago I 
picked up a couple small (one oz.) tins of something called Coral Flake 
at the D.C. JR Tobacco shop.  It was made by the firm of W.T. Davies and 
Sons of Great Britain.  I have never seen it since.  I really loved this 
stuff- it was almost black in color, but quite mild- sort of like a 
slightly spicier St. Bruno flake.  If anyone has spotted Coral Flake 
(mine was in a cute little circular tin, bright green with a red stripe) 
I would GREATLY appreciate hearing about it.

[ If you still have a sample, you might consider getting it
duplicated... BTW, has anyone seen any L. L. Bean's pipe tobacco in
recent years? I'd like to get some for the same purpose. -S. ]

Has anybody bothered to call customs yet?  I've tried a couple of

I did think of a way to get themin, though.  Just take off the bands

bring an empty non-Cuban box with you to put them in.  Fool customs,

My solution is a variation of yours: after loading the
pibe with dry tobacco, add _one_ drop of water directly
into the pibe. While smoking, the humidity seems to 
spread in an appropriate way. This is of course an 
emergency act but not as terrible in practice as in theory.

  Cigars, and pipes too....
Hi - 
   I haven't written for a while, but have been following the current
discussion on cigars - and I thought this was a "Pipes" list!    :-}  
   Actually, though, all of the cigar info has been great.  I've started
going to the cigar store with a list of recommended cigars - it's been
Very Interesting.  In particular, I like the Arturo Fuento 8-5-8, which
Marios Agrotes just gave a glowing report on.  I've got to ask a dumb
question though - where can I mail order these for $1.20?  Here in
Cincinnati (not the best market I'm afraid), they cost about $2.50 each!

   Since I'm actually a pipe smoker, I thought I'd ask a pipe question too
- I have a very nice pipe my wife gave me several years ago (can't
remember the name) with a Lexan stem.  The stem has grown loose over the
years.  When I raised this question some time ago, I was told how to
tighten a rubber or vulcanite (?) stem (heat slightly with a match, press
against something to swell it, then sand to fit).  Does this work with
Lexan?  I'm afraid to screw it up!

   Thanks,

Greetings to all:
	I find that if my tobacco is getting too dry, there is a
*quick* technique for making it moist again.  Simply place a damp
chunk of paper towel, napkin, etc., in the container where the tobacco
is stored.  It only needs to be mildly damp.  The tobacco should soak
up the water within 24 hours like mad, leaving the paper towel dry as
bone.  As with other similar techniques, it is difficult to regulate
moistness, and might just take some experimentation.  When I have
tried it, it has made ten month old tobac seem like new.
	I know someone who likewise puts a slightly damp napkin in his
cigar box sometimes - when he first gets the box.  He never
replenishes it if it gets dry.

Hi NET Smokers,

It was a great surprise to find the monthly letter in alt.smokers.
Let me introduce myself -

My name is Ib FAGERLUND, 37 years of age and i've been smoking the
pipe since my teenage years.

During the last 10 years i have spend a lot of time arranging the
annual Danish Championship in Pipesmoking. Every year we form a group
of about 10 people, who will use about 6 month's to knit this show
together.

We usualy have around 400 participants for the contest, plus a very
beautiful exhibition of pipes, tobaccos and related items. As you
might know, we have some of the worlds best pipe carvers in Denmark.
People like Winslow, Bang, Hedegaard, Ph Vigen etc. show their latest
products, along with factory made pipes from Stanwell, Refbjerg, G.
Jensen .... You name it (try to avoid slobber in the keyboard).

Three years ago i was elected for the executive committee of the
Nordic Smokers Guild; a nordic pipe smokers club, counting around 600
members, mainly living in Denmark, Sweden and Norway.

This year, our club has the honour to host the World Championship in
Pipe Smo- king 1994. It will be heldt in Copenhagen, Denmark october
8th - 9th 1994.  We expect somewhere around 400 participants from all
around the world, and i can promise a blast of an exhibition. The
contest and exhibition will be open for spectators at no charge. So if
you'r in the neighbourhood, feel free to join us.

If you have interrest in any of these arrangements, just drop me a
note and i will put you on our mailing list (full postal address,
please).

By the way -

Denmark is known for being quite liberal on the smoking issue. It's
hard to find a no-smoking restaurant around here, so it will be a
while before we will join you in the 'Great North Woods' !

Good puffin'

<a name="2">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #127 - January 21, 1994</a>

Regarding cigars, Norm sez:

	I had one on the way home and kept wondering why the car was
	spinning whilst I didn't even turn the wheel?!?!  Good lord,
	I think I like my pipe better. ...  I did notice that the cigar
	was a bit on the dry side (leaf flakes coming off during the smoke).
	How do I go about putting life back into the leaf?  Also,
	I never cut the end off the cigar, I just put a hole in the
	end to allow for a draw ...

I won't go so far as to say "no wonder you didn't like
it, it was dry." The taste of cigar and pipe tobacco is
quite different. I like them both for different reasons.

However, a dry cigar is not nearly as nice as a properly-humidifed one.
To rehumidify cigars, I put them in my cedar box, unwrapped
(if they came wrapped in plastic or anything else)
with a home-made humidifier: a tightly-rolled Handiwipe. The
rolled-up Handiwipe sits in a small tray to keep moisture off the wood.
It is tied up with a small rubber band. This takes up space in the box
but it's a large box so there is plenty of room. (I built the box
out of Tennesee aromatic cedar). You could also do this with tupperware.

The difference between a well-humidified cigar and a
dry one is remarkable. But they aren't the same smoke
as a pipe.

Off to enjoy my Peterson,

Norm writes:

&gt; Where's Thacker been through all this cigar talk anyhow? 

In fact, I've been out of town, conducting research at the Library of 
Congress and other important archives.  The result is this report, and I
hope it's worth the wait!

In a previous issue of the digest, I commented on how the history of briar
(brought to us by the Mongols) was confused by the possible influence of 
the Egyptians, and promised to expound on that comment.  

Excavations of the tombs of Tutankhamen and other Egyptian nobility 
indicate that pipes figured heavily in the mummification and burial ritual.
The Egyptians believed that smoking raised one's spiritual consciousness;
symbolically, a small portion of the deceased's heart was burned in a brass
device not unlike the Turkish hookah.  But a startling revelation at the 
1992 Conference of the Chicago Association for Lost Aegypt has shed new 
light on this practice.  

The Conference featured a panel discussion on the construction of the
pyramids, and was widely attended by historians, archaeologists, and
architects.  While this blue-ribbon team made much progress in
understanding ancient Egypt, the real breakthrough came as an event
of pure serendipity.  

It chanced that the hotel was also hosting another conference, this one for
the Benevolent Alliance of Sausage Handlers. The meatpackers were having 
quite a time celebrating their 50th anniversary (held, of course, in the 
city known as "hog butcher for the world"), and the liquor was flowing fast.  

One of the attendees was none other than Jimmy Dean, who I'm sure many of
you have seen on television advertisements.  Just how drunk he was isn't 
recorded, but he was far enough gone that he accidentally staggered into 
the wrong ballroom.  Expecting to hear a lecture on the latest sausage 
curing techniques, Jimmy found himself looking at a cross-section of 
Cheop's pyramid.  He leaned over and whispered to a woman standing nearby,
in a voice loud enough to be heard throughout the room, "Mah mama used to
cure hams in a smokehouse lahk that!  Mmm-mmm!"   

After the ushers had removed Mr. Dean, several of the archaeologists
realized that he was on to something; in certain ways, the pyramid *did*
look like a smokehouse.  And when word spread that the sausage conference
had an open bar, a motion to merge the two conferences for an
"interdisciplinary exchange of ideas" passed unanimously.

The result, of course, was the now-famous 1992 CALA-BASH conference.  It
took another 9 months to confirm their initial findings, but confirmed they
were.

Once the scribbled, beer-stained notes from the convention were deciphered,
the conference proceedings were published.  The long-standing belief that
mummification was meant to preserve a body for resurrection was debunked.
"Instead," the proceedings stated, "the burial process was a spiritual 
send-off for the deceased.  The body, in funereal wrappings, was placed in
a sarcophogas, itself on a bier surrounded by the finest tobaccos.  A 
charcoal burner was set alight, kindling the tobacco, then the entranceway
to the tomb sealed.  Cleverly designed channels in the pyramid itself acted
to create draft, bringing fresh oxygen into the smoking chamber and burning
the tobacco at a precisely-controlled rate.  The aromatic vapors permeated
the sarcophogas (itself needed to protect the body from the heat), 
literally smoke-curing the body while, it was believed, helping the soul 
loft upward toward heaven.  " 

Seen in this context, the ritual burning of a piece of the deceased's heart
is now seen as a ceremony performed for the benefit of the survivors, a
symbolic demonstration of what was taking place inside the pyramid.  And
the pyramids may rightly be considered the largest pipes ever built.

This breakthrough naturally led researchers to look for further evidence of
pipelore in Egyptian history, and many significant finds were made.  We now
know that the earliest Egyptian pipes were constructed of sun-baked brick,
being thicker (and heavier) than our modern clay pipes.  These quickly
became a rage, demand growing so fast that the Hebrews were enslaved to 
make the brick pipes, and records prove that shortages of stems were 
frequent.  (The Bible records one such incident during the reign of
Ramses; sadly, mis-translation from the Greek has turned "stems" into
"straw.")

As Egyptian culture became more sophisticated, so too did their pipes, so
that within a few hundred years ornately painted pipes were common among 
the rich.  Skilled artisans became interested in pipemaking, and intricate
carvings became the rule of the day.  Most of these were stereotypically 
Egyptian, featuring busts of jackal-headed gods; clearly these were the 
ancestors of today's carved meerschaums (which, adapted to western custom,
now portray skulls and the like).  

Finally, with the advent of metalworking, elaborate brass water pipes
evolved.  These were to have tremendous impact on Middle Eastern culture;
more durable than clay, they could survive the hardships of travel and were
thus ideal for the many nomadic tribes in the region.  They became a staple
in Arab culture; indeed, Aladdin's "Magic Lamp" was originally a water
pipe. (Sadly, anti-smoking revisionists have warped that legend beyond
recognition.)

It can be shown that Arab coffee makers began as modified water pipes; so
the final irony is that espresso, so beloved to our modern tobacco-hating
crowd, owes its origin to smoking!

Ancient Egypt must also be credited with the invention of the pipe nail;
in this case, miniature gold obelisks, which chemical analyses have shown
to bear traces of tobacco ash.  On the other hand, ashtrays were unknown to
them, which was to have tragic consequences for the Library at Alexandria.

Briar, sadly, was unknown to Africa until the Crusades, and no other
suitable wood was found in the Middle East, though legends recount several
failed attempts at wooden pipes.  (Bible scholars believe that the story of
Moses and the Burning Bush is an allegory for the ancient pipemaker's
quest for a suitable wood.)

So it was that Egypt's influence on smoking was exclusively in the form of
the hookah.  These traveled far and wide; certainly reaching as far as
Turkey and India, where they remain to this day an important cultural
element.

<a name="4">Subject: meerschaum care, Esoterica Tobacciana</a>

A question came up about meerschaum care, specifically about
whether meerschaums need a carbon cake.  The answer is no--you
don't want them to develop any cake.  It inhibits  the coloring
process.  Do do have to be careful about removing the cake, so
you don't remove meerschaum material from the inside of the bowl.

Meerschaums can be a pain in some ways--their fragility requires
careful care, and it's not safe to smoke one outdoors--but the
fact that they don't need a carbon cake is a real advantage.  No
breaking in is required.  Since briar pipes require a
carefully-shaped cake to smoke well, I'm usually very meticulous
about smoking a bowl down to the bottom.  You don't have to worry
about that with a meerschaum, which is why if I want to smoke a
pipe close to bedtime, I'll often choose my meerschaum, since it
doesn't matter if I don't finish the bowl.

A follow-up on my concerns about the demise of Esoterica
Tobacciana...  Gregory Pease informed me via e-mail, much to my
delight, that ET is still in business, and will be shipping new
tins of their blends soon.  The reason why there's been such a
delay in filling orders is that ET is so meticulous about
insisting on only the very best tobaccos for their blends--which
makes the delay fully justified in my mind.

I'd encourage people on the list to try the ET blends if you can
get them in your area.  They're pricey, but worth the price if
you value good English blends.  After this false alarm, you can
bet that I'll be stockpiling away several pounds of these. :-)

<a name="5">Subject: Like fine wines...</a>

I'm not sure of the exact issue, but Rolling Stone did an interview with
David Letterman a while ago (within the past year, say).  In it he mention
receiving a gift of a "perfectly humidored" cigar (again, the specifics
escape me).  Does this imply that tobacco has "vintages" that improve over
age?  The time scale for this aging was on the order of a number of years,
maybe 10 or so.  I'd never heard of doing anything like this, even if I could
muster the self-control to keep my hands off that last cigar.  Perhaps some
of you could educate me on this tobacco maturation process and things to look
for.

Also, Chris Cooper mentions wanting to keep his cigars around for a while,
but doesn't have a humidor.  There are certainly better alternatives to my
experience, but when I first started smoking cigars, and was still shopping
around for a humidor, I used to keep them inside a zip-lock with a humidity
element and put that inside another zip-lock.  And I'd put the whole thing
inside the fridge.  This worked quite well as far as I could tell at the
time.

<a name="6">Subject: Meerschaum</a>

One thing I do know about meerschaum, why you're not supposed to touch the
meerschaum itself, is that the grease (and dirt, I suppose) on your hands might
leave a permanent fingerprint on the stuff when it's hot.  I have a meerschaum
(carved into the head of a lion) and was very careful not to touch the bowl for
a long time.  Then a friend of mine pointed out that a meerschaum owner will
mostly not touch the bowl in order to keep it as white as possible.  It may
never leave a fingerprint, but it will darken the meerschaum to a golden or
brown color.  After that I decided, like my friend, to start grabbing the bowl
anyway, because I too think the golden color looks good.  It may be profane in
the opinion of a true meerschaum fan, but what the hell.

[ I like the gold color too, but I thought that touching it prevented
it from darkening! -S. ]

 Ma&gt; We'd like to hear from you, and hope you'll help us to keep the
 Ma&gt; mailgroup going. For starters, why not take a few minutes and tell us
 Ma&gt; about yourself by return mail? We'd like to hear about your
 Ma&gt; preferences in pipes, tobacco, shops, books - anything you think your
 Ma&gt; fellow pipeists would be interested in knowing.

Well, I've been smoking pipes and cigars since 1972. My father smoked a
pipe, but never cigars. He gave up his pipe years ago, but I'm still
puffing.
My preferences in pipes include Dunhills (when I can get them for half
price), my Ashton (an estate pipe), Petersons, and Americans. The latter
are hand made pipes by a guy from Pennsylvania. They start at about $65
and go up, but they smoke like much more expensive pipes. No fills, very
well made with good briar. They are sold all over the DC area, but I
don't think he sells them outside of this area.
For pipe tobacco, I'm smoking two blends right now. Both are from pipe
shops, but contrary to what they'd like you to believe they don't mix
them at the shop. Most of these guys buy their blends from one or more
of several different distributers. The two blends I am smoking are
distributed by Lane's. The first almost everybody has. Lane's calls it
1Q.  If you ask your pipe shop what blend they sell more than any other,
whatever they call it, it's probably really 1Q. They other is also from
Lane's. I don't know its real name, but it's a light Latakia blend.
Cigars: I'm firmly of the opinion that life is too short to smoke bad
cigars. I'd rather smoke fewer of a good cigar than alot of bad cigars.
Nevertheless, I'll put my favorites into three categories by price:
1. Money is no object:
Cohiba Robustos (Cuba)
Davidoff Special R
Davidoff Special T
2. Moderately expensive:
Santa Damiana
Dunhill Vintage (blue labels)
3. Best cigar for the money:
Arturo Fuente's Chateau Fuente (about $1.70 for a rich medium strength
Rothschild shape cigar that tastes good right down to the very end).

 Ma&gt; Now,  back to cigars.  Not to offend any of you guys but -- well --
 Ma&gt; Sheesh!  What are you guys?  Maschochicts  uh? Massochists um? Machss-
 Ma&gt; Crazy?  I was lulled in to a false sense of security by all your
 Ma&gt; wonderful messages on the list and went out and bought myself a few
 Ma&gt; stogies.  Sheesh! I had one on the way home and kept wondering why the
 Ma&gt; car was spinning whilst I didn't even turn the wheel?!?!  Good lord,  I

 What kind of cigar did you try? Cigars very widely in strength and
 taste. For a good quality, but very mild, cigar, try the Macanudo
 (other than the Hyde Park, which is a little stronger).  Also, you'll
 find that the wider ring gauges smoke cooler.
     I did
 Ma&gt; notice that the cigar was a bit on the dry side (leaf flakes coming off
 Ma&gt; during the smoke).  How do I go about  putting life back into the leaf?

Once the leaf starts coming off, that cigar is history. If it hasn't
gotten to that stage yet, but it back into a hunidified environment for
a week or two. If you don't have a humidifier, make one out of a
Tupperware-style container and a humidifier from you local pipe shop.

 Ma&gt; Also,  I never cut the end off the cigar, I just put a hole in the end
 Ma&gt; to allow for a draw (Is this why they made  me want to kiss the
 Ma&gt; ground).)?

I'm told that tends to concentrate the smoke. I prefer the guillotine
cut, myself.

 Ma&gt; 	BTW, I'm going to contact Customs and ask about the "personal
 Ma&gt; use" and other allowances for Cuban cigars (as I promised before I

 Last time I looked at a customs form, it said that the personal use
 exemption for Cuban cigars was only for foreigners visiting the US.

 Ma&gt; It is extremely frustrating to find a tobacco one really likes and
 Ma&gt; then  see it suddenly disappear.  In Washington D.C. a couple of years
 Ma&gt; ago I  picked up a couple small (one oz.) tins of something called
 Ma&gt; Coral Flake  at the D.C. JR Tobacco shop.  It was made by the firm of

I know that the JR's in DC does mail order. Have you tried calling them
to see if they still have it?


 Ma&gt; I don't have a humidor so I was wondering how long I can keep a cigar
 Ma&gt; before it will no longer be enjoyable to smoke.I just bought a
 Ma&gt; Macanudo but am waiting for a special occasion to try it out. Any
 Ma&gt; suggestions for keeping cigars for someone on a poor college students
 Ma&gt; budget?
Yes, spend $2 or $3 on a Tupperware-style container long enough to fit
your cigars, then spend another $3 on a tube-type humidifier from a pipe
shop. Fill it only with distilled water, and you'll have a humidor that
works just as well as the $300 versions.


... Power corrupts, absolute power, however, is kinda neat.

what has happened is that i assign a 1 1/2 year subscription to anyone
sending $15.  However with the cost increases in paper and postage over
the past 5 years, I have been considering increasing the sub rate....$15
may be a good number.
    Another item that I have been working on is the first A&amp;M Gazette

for each month from the photo collection of Paul Spaniola.  It actually
looks pretty decent.  Dont know what i will be charging for them, but
will have a mention or advertisement in the March issue (yes the next

Answer to Brian Morgan's question about $1.20 Arturo Fuentes 8-5-8
by mail order:

JR Tobacco (1-800-JR-CIGAR) sells the box of 25 for $28.95.

Since my orders are usually in the $200 range, (about every four months)
the $3 shipping/handling charge they add to the total order is
inconsequential.  For a single box order though, it raises the price
by more than 10%, to $31.95.  Still, a pretty good deal.

Suggestion: Get a couple of friends, and order 2-3 boxes each.
The boxes they come in are some of the prettiest boxes on the market
today.  You can proudly keep the cigars in there as you use them.

Smoke in peace,

&gt;Anyway,  I've found the best way to deal with tobacco dry out in the
&gt;pouch is to buy a button himidfier.  This is similar to what you would
&gt;put in your humidor when storing the tobacco, but is small enough to
&gt;stay in your pouch.

My father suggested putting an apple slice in with the tobacco.  He
does that with popcorn that needs moisture.  Well, it's not the worst
advise he ever gave me; but it did ruin about 2 oz of otherwise good
tobacco.  I finally gave up and bought a jar with the soak stone in
the lid.  Now I have one at work and at home.  It looks nice and is
effective in keeping an even humidity.

&gt;A tobacconist once suggested to me that I mix some honey and some
&gt;cigarette ash, and coat the inside of a non-carbonised bowl; then
&gt;bake the pipe (without the stem) in a hot oven until the stuff caramelizes.
&gt;So I've done that with a few pipes, and I can't complain.  Also, a
&gt;trick I learned from my dad is to alternate full and half bowls with
&gt;a new pipe.
                        [snip]
&gt;I recently bought a nice small Meerschaum (on SALE!),
&gt;but after smoking my first from this wonderful device,
&gt;I realized that I had no idea how to care for it.
&gt;
&gt;I know to avoid water and heavy scraping, but are there
&gt;any other details I am missing? For instance, do I want
&gt;to build the same kind of carbon cake as on my briar?
&gt;
&gt;[ I've heard you're not supposed to touch the bowl with your hands;
&gt;some people use gloves. Any meerschaum fans out there? -S. ]
&gt;
One of the flyers I picked up at Tinder Box (chain store that sells
tobacco, pipes, cigars, etc.) suggest filling any pipe loosely with
tobacco, tamping to 1/3 of the pipe volume, refilling loosely, tamp
to 2/3 volume, overfill loosely, tamp level.  When breaking in a
pipe, they recommend smoking ten bowls that were filled loosely and
tamped to 1/3 volume.  Then smoke 10 more bowls at the 2/3 level.
This builds up an even carbon cake.  The carbon can withstand
extremely high temperature so the briar will be protected from the
burning contents.

Meerschaum is sea foam that has been hardened.  Since a meerschaum
already is rock and will not burn like wood pipes, there is no need
for a carbon cake.  It also is porous so it absorbs oils from the
tobacco.  Smoking tobaccos with a higher oil content (ie naturally
flavored instead of using sugary flavor additions) provide more oil
that can be absorbed.  This produces the graceful characteristic of
the style.  The pipe can also absorb oil from your hands.  When the
pipe was manufactured, the bowl was covered with wax to inhibit the
oils from being absorbed into the pipe from the outside.  This wax
will become hot enough to melt when you smoke your new pipe.
Touching the bowl may remove wax so some people wear gloves.

I was looking at a meerschaum lined briar because it smokes evenly.
The tobacconist recommended a low grade, all-meerschaum bowl.  I've
been a fan ever since.  I have a few collector-type pipes in my
collection, but I don't worry about the meerschaum as a collector
item.  I like it because I don't get hot spots and less juice comes
up from the bowl.  The only drawback I found was that a small pipe,
especially a meerschaum, is frequently considered drug paraphernalia.

From: JOSEPH MAXIMILLIAN MURPHY &lt;???????@???.???&gt;
<a name="11">Subject: Various and sundry tobacky stuff</a>

Well, after a few healthy months of lurking, I'm finally getting down to
writing in to the Digest. Most recent things first: a tip I've heard on
re-moistening pipe tobacco. My father, a veteran pipe and cigar smoker since
before my earliest days, suggested this technique to me. Make a few small
slices of apple and put them in your pouch. (Eat the remaining apple.) This
works on the same principle as the "moistened napkin" technique: the dried out
tobacco will absorb the moisture from the apple in a matter of days, without
actually having to contact water directly. It also, according to Da, gives the
tobac a nice apple flavor. One caveat: in a day or two, check your tobacco and
take out the fruit! Otherwise, somewhere down the road, you end up smoking some
vile green fuzzy thing, and talking to little purple snakes from Alpha
Centauri for a couple of hours.

Why was I interested in re-moistening tobacco, you ask? Well, this is for the
"don't buy this mass produced garbage" thread. I recently made the mistake of
picking up a pouch of Borkum Riff Whiskey in a 7-11. Blech. I think I know what
"bite" is now. It's interesting to note that the first tobacco I ever bought, a
"black forest" house blend (more on that later) is still moist enough in a
little plastic baggie from last August, while this stuff in their "Hermetically
sealed special bag" is drier than any sawdust I've ever come across. But then,
I think it may be older than I am, too. Yes, from now on, it's only real
tobacco shops for me. No more drug stores.

As that reveals, I'm new to pipe smoking. I got a little baby bowl pipe for a
pretty low price at a tobacconist's in Bethany Beach, Delaware. (Notice to all
pipe-smoking beach goers in the Delmarva area of the U.S. East Coast: check it
out. It's a small little place and I can't recall the name, but the guy I dealt
with was nice to a couple of relatively new smokers. And hey, how many places
can you go to a good tobacconist's and then be on the beach 2 minutes later?)
That's also where we picked up the "black forest," a nice blend I think. Mild
and tasteful. The guy ion the shop claimed it was blended with "malt;" I now
know a little about homebrewing (although I've done even less) and I don't see
anything that looks like what I expect actual malted grain to look like. Maybe
he's talking about extract? Any ideas? Anyway, the "black forest" is a short,
thick cut; would this be the "flake" you folks talk about? The Borkum Riff
(blech again) is longer and thinner, is that the Cavendish? I'm thinking of
getting a bigger bowl size soon; the one I have doesn't seem to hold the
longer cut very well. I also have a question about the pipe I've got. I know
diddley about its composition, but the bowl is terribly pitted. Little tiny
holes all over. Why might this be, and is it bad?

Anyway, I have to get to work. I'll send a personal bio and some of my cigar
habits along in a while.

[ A while later... -S. ]

So, on to cigars. I'm afraid these comments might offend some of the more
high-quality readers. I like drug store cigars. Maybe it's because of the
psychological connections; they were easy to find and afford when I was and 
undergrad doing lots of technical theatre and looking for something to
enhange my faux-macho image. It's just the way I am: I like King Edwards. Not
enough to keep a supply on hand, you understand, but every now and then for
special occasions like a show opening. You can share them with your friends
without going in hock. There was a recent compliment to Backwoods; while I
remember the quality of the smoke as better than the King Eddies, I couldn't
tell which end you lit from the end you put in your mouth! They're virtually
untapered, as I recall. I spent much of that evening spitting out chunks of
tobacco. I did get something, though, a Dutch Masters or Hav-A-Tampa, that
was just about unsmokable, so maybe I'm past that phase now. As for real
cigars, I've tended to have bad experiences. A friend brought me a Romeo y
Julieta back from the UK; while it smoked nice, the nicotine punch is too
much for an occasional smoker. I'd have to advise against smoking these at
6 am on an empty stomach after a major fight with your SO. (Good news is that
the RyJ is gone, but many months later, the SO and I are still around.) I
forget the brand, but I think I had a Churchill-size once. Biggest cigar I've
ever seen in my life. Easily the size of my forearm. Light colored, and very
smooth, with a firm ash, as I recall. But again, a ittle too much for this
poor dope. I'd have to recommend against mixing these with greasy food and a
little too much booze. Ah well, I was young; we live and learn. And I think
the cigar was not so much to blame as the food and drink.

I think that should serve as an intro to the group. Thanks for your comments,
questions, etc. By the way, Steve, I seem to remember subscribing to the user
name "pipes," but I'm sending this through the one on top of the Digest as I
get it. Is either preferable?

Look, Cubans, general, and that cigar in particular, are much stronger
than your average Dominican or Jamaican cigar.  And, in my view, Romeo Y

To all you Netters on the Pipes Mailgroup:

     I recently went to Camelot Tobacco at the Continent (Busch Blvd
on the north end of Columbus, OH) and picked up a batch of new cigars.
I discovered that Fonseca Cigar rejects are sold under the name
Rollers Choice.  I picked up several Rothschild Sized cigars (5'x 50)
and as far as I could tell they were rejected for wrapper blemishes.
The Fonseca cigar brand has a grassy tea character with a sharp after
taste just like Cigar Aficiando says.  This kind of taste may not be
to every ones liking but it sure breaks the monotony of smooth woody
creamy tastes of other Dominican made cigars.  The Fonsecas are well
made and burn evenly.

In my next post I will lay out where to find all the big brand
rejects.  These provide the same taste at one-half to one-third of
brand name price.

I thought this little tidbit might amuse you and maybe some of the

of smoking, so if you choose not to put it in the digest, I'll

criminals were cashing in on information gleaned from the airwaves, the
Guardian reported yesterday.

The eavesdroppers "could hardly believe their ears -- aliens were invading
planet Earth ... Doncaster to be exact," said the report, citing the latest
edition of a local police magazine.

It said several people were arrested and charged with acting illegally
on information in police broadcasts.

Scanning equipment can be legally purchased for a few dollars, and it is
not illegal to eavesdrop on police broadcasts.  But it is against the law
to act on any information overheard when monitoring police frequencies.

Hello All,
I'm continuing to enjoy the Pipes Digest: learning something
new each week it seems. It seems that this list spans a pretty
good cross-section of tobak aficianados from all walks of life,
and it's pretty amazing when you can see one common thread which
seems to come up regularly, almost across the board. It seems that
by and large, this list believes the Arturo Fuente 8-5-8 to be one of
the best "everyday" cigars out there. I'm stopping by to pick up one
for tonight after work. I prefer the maduro wrapper, and they are a
true joy to smoke! The local shops have been out for some time, and
I just found out a new shipment has arrived. Another seeming favorite
is the AF Hemingway Classic. Smoke shop should have some of those in
now as well, but I'll probably save one of those pricey beauties for
a special occasion.

Another very good cigar which I can heartily recommend is the H.
Upmann Churchill. I've smoked two in a row and found them to be
extremely good. Right up there,close to, but still not on par with
the 8-5-8, IMHO.  But there again, different cigars for different
moods, right?

Another that I tried recently was a Te-Amo Churchill. This maduro
wrapped cigar was a huge churchill! It was beautifully wrapped, and
the wrapper had an excellent spicy flavor. I thought I was in for a
treat. Well, I lit it up and waited, waited, waited. This was the most
bland, character-less smoke I have ever tried! Mild is a kind word,
this cigar was nothing short of wimpy! The draw was pathetic; I put
it out after about 15 minutes of nothing. At $2.60, I said "I coulda
had two 8-5-8's!" Anyone else know anything of the Te-Amo? It is a
Mexican smoke.....is it typical of Mexican handrolls?

May good smokes come your way,

Steve,
When I read my first post from you I felt like I was standing in the
Tobacco Taverne in State College, BSing and inhaling the wonderful
odors.  I lived in Turkey for a while in a little town with several
meerschaum carvers.  They used to put bushel baskets of pipes out in
front of their shps with seconds in them.  We typically paid a couple
obucks per pipe.  A very common design was the man's head with turban.
I sent pipes back to everyone that smoked.  Care of pipes became a subject
of much discussion.  Our best information was that the oil from fingers
caused darker spots in the golden color that everyone strove for.  We
would buy pieces of chamois and make little custom shaped gloves for our
pipes.  A friend who had smoked pipes, particularly meerschaum, for years told
me to pack the first pinch like a baby, the second pinch like a little
girl, the third pinch like a young boy, and the final pinch like a man.
It may not be polictically correct, but it does burn nicely, allowing lots
of air circulation in the bowl.
The bottom line was that I had sent a pipe for everyone but me.  When my dad
died a few years ago, I got his meerscyhaum.  At Christmas, my brother-in-
law gave me an eqagle claw holding a bowl that I had sent him twenty years
ago.  He has since stopped smoking and wanted me to have it back.  It
has a wonderful color and draw.
Please pardon the typos, my cursor keys are gifing me fits.
Thanks for a great list.

I was just curious to know if anybody else noticed the Shoe comic strip about
cigars a while back. In it, a bird walks into a cigar shop and asks the
tobacconist for a box of 50 caliber Il Duce Grandes. The tobacconist looks at
him and replys "certainly sir, you can pick those up next week". A confused
look comes over the bird and asks why he'll have to wait until next week. The
tobacconist answers, "there's a five day waiting period on those."   ;)  
Just thought I'd share it with the rest of you.

<a name="11">Subject: The Ultimate Humidor, the Penultimate Hygrometer...</a>

Well, ya win some and you lose some. You find a great smokeshop and
you get bashed by Billary and the EPA. You come up with the world's
greatest humidor, but it doesn't quite work.

Billary and the EPA, you already know about. Let's just hope it
doesn't happen the way they want it. Write your Congressthing. If you
need their address, ask me -- I've got the whole list.

The great smoke shop is Track Town in Cherry Hill, NJ. Right across
from the Garden State Racetrack. It doesn't look like much from the
outside, but they have some _very_ good pipes (Larsens, Ben Wades,
Upshalls...) and a fully-charged cigar humidor. Stop in if you're in
the Philadelphia area.

And for the great humidor, while I was in Cherry Hill, I took a short
drive to Edmund Scientific in Barrington. I was looking mainly for a
hygrometer, but I also found a dessicator. For those who don't know, a
dessicator is a huge glass jar with a heavy glass lid. They're
commonly used to dry things out in high-school biology labs; one fills
the bottom with kitty litter (to absorb moisture) and closes the lid.

I reasoned, that if it could keep things dry, why couldn't it also
keep them damp?  A heavy-glass, see-through humidor, with a ceramic
shelf and more capacity than any reasonable smoker could ever want.
And a great conversation piece to boot!

Well, forty dollars later, I owned it, and after forty more dollars I
also owned a digital hygrometer-thermometer. They all came back with
me to Chez Masticola, where I put the one, and all my worldly tobak,
inside the other. I could read the hygrometer through the glass, and
the humidity rapidly went up into the seventies. Great!

Well, not so great. Next morning, I awoke and, of course, immediately
went to read the hygro. Guess what? The numbers were so dim that I
couldn't read them. Checked the batteries. Nothing. Dried it with a
hair dryer. Nothing.

Then it dawned. The digital hygro works by sensing air capacitance.
Meaning that any condensing environment, which included the inside of
the antidessicator, would mess it up. Back to Edmund it went, with a
request that they send me an analog model instead.

Well, after I mail this, I think I'll drive home through the slush and
freezing rain (hasn't it been a _great_ winter? )|-P and have a quiet
Peterson to myself. My CHILL parser is working now, after a month of
late-night hacking. I've earned it.

And to all of you, here's hoping that you're warm and dry, that your
matches stay lit, and that your smoke smells wonderful to the ones you
love. Until next time, then,

				Smoke in peace,
				~\U Steve.

P.S. A question for the group: Has anyone run into a B&amp;B or
resort-type place that _welcomes_ pipefolk and cigarists? Love to hear
about it if so! -S.

&gt;         My brother has taken to making pipes, he does very nice work, and
&gt; he is looking for a source of briar

Sort of off the subject: I made a handful of pipes. I figured that I could
get a briar pipe anywhere, so I used various weird and exotic woods.

The pine pipe smoked exactly like you'd think. The rosewood pipe had (may
still have) a wonderful aroma that it added to the smoke. That week, I read
a long and scary article about allergies to hardwoods- With a little more
carelessness, I could have been killed. Eeek.

Now I just smoke what the nice man sells me. With a little extra perique.

Fumingly,

Martin

&gt;   Someone on the list wrote that he tends to have bad experiences with
&gt;   "real cigars" and cites as an example the Romeo Y Julieta a friend
&gt;   brought back from England.
&gt;   Look, Cubans, general, and that cigar in particular, are much stronger
&gt;   than your average Dominican or Jamaican cigar.  And, in my view, Romeo Y
&gt;   Julietas are the most poorly made modern Cuban cigars.  Try some good
&gt;   Dominicans before you reject the good ones categorically.
&gt;
This comment is not quite complete.

ANY tobacco product, especially cigars, from the "continent" is STRONGER
than the "American" version.  This follows the general American proclivity
for "watered-down" versions of the real thing - like beer. It turns out
that today not only do American breweries churn out barrels of Lager
instead of Ale, but that Lager is only 4.0%! When I was in the military in
the late 60's, 3.2% beer was served at the PX and referred to as "Panther
P..." 

In the cigar world there is a style called EMS or European Market Selection.
This is different from the "maduro" or dark wrapper, although, in my
experience, the two terms are often interchanged. Both are DARK BROWN
wrappers, almost black, compared to the "candela" or "natural" wrappers.
The "candela" is easy to spot, it's green, while the "natural" ranges in
shades from tan to brown.

I have found that the EMS wrapper is "bitter" to my tastes, even on good
cigars (any manufacturer). I don't particularly enjoy the "maduro" although
most good cigars tend to have "dark natural" wrappers which some call
maduro.

And as for Romeo Y Juleita being a Cuban? I have a brochure from the
company on the occasion of their re-introduction to the American Market
after a 20 year absence (circa 1982). They characterize themselves:

"Romeo Y Julieta is an old and respected name in the cigar industry. We
believe it to be the last of the really famous Cuban brands to re-enter the
American Market." They go on to describe their quest to find new tobacco
sources until, "We found the two bends that would more than fulfill the
desires of the most discriminating of cigar smokers world-wide."
Cameroon Deluxe from the Dominican Republic and "All Cuban Seed" from
Honduras. The implication is clear from their brochure that they have moved
all of their production from Cuba to these two locations - "Cuban-born
supervision," "Cuban-born rollers," "Cuban seed," expatriate Cuban cigar
experts," etc.

These reminiscences may be a bit too long for the Digest but I wanted to pay
tribute a someone who educated me in the way of the pipe some 34 years ago.
Like many kids, I began with cigarettes, eventually going to six packs a day
(along with the jokes: Don always wears the same color clothes, ash gray;
you can find Don in a crowd by the cloud over his head, etc.). Finally I
figured what I was spending on butts and quit. A year later, I took up a
pipe, real cheapie, Dr. Grabow. Fortunately I dropped it and it broke after
a week. Turning to the Yellow Pages for a pipe shop, I found a modest ad for
a place near work. That's how I met Joseph Roth. Joe was a tobacconist and
pipe maker from the old school in Russia. When I met him he was 72 and told
me he began as an apprentice when he was 15. He was a perfectionist. The
pipes he made, and I'm lucky enough to still have four of his, including a
rough-cut (not sandblast) lumberman with a 6" shank, made from a single
piece of briar, were all from Algerian briar. Not just any Algerian briar.
Joe imported 6 tons of aged Algerian briar in 1911 which he stored in a
warehouse by NY's East River. Said when it ran out, he'd retire. Said no one
aged briar properly anymore. To age briar root, he said, one threw the briar
into a swamp and let it sit for several years; then air dried it for several
more. At that point, it was totally sapless, rock hard and ready for use. He
also aged and blended his own tobacco, using totally natural ingredients to
achieve different flavors. Each customer had "their blend" written in a
ledger and you could order any amount. He shipped blends all over the world.
That was the first time I learned that there were tobaccos that naturally
tasted of chocolate, vanilla, etc. He avoided Louisiana perique in his
blends because he said its high nicotine content could lead to heart
attacks.
 
Like many old-time tobacconists, Joe would willingly spend time explaining
his craft, which is how this snot-nosed kid learned how to tell birds eye
from straight grain; and how many sandblasts are covering up minor
imperfections in grain or wood. Finally he did run out of briar and retired,
selling his business and its name to a person who was an excellent pipe
repairer but not a pipe maker, named Lou Bascomb. Lou attempted to carry on
but he began using commercial spray-flavored tobaccos and customers such as
myself drifted away. I have _never_ found a blend to equal "mine" from those
days though now I do enjoy a commercial Danish wholesale blend of
cavendish-cut white burley which The Tabagerie in Westport CT retails as
"Riverboat". I'm glad Joe passed on before this country begain turning into
a People's Republic where the rights of the individual were trampled by a
politically correct (now _there's_ an oxymoron) vocal minority who insist
that only they know what's good for humanity.

<a name="5">Subject: Re: Meerschaum stuff...</a>

&gt;   Meerschaum is sea foam that has been hardened.  Since a meerschaum
&gt;   already is rock and will not burn like wood pipes, there is no need
&gt;   for a carbon cake.  It also is porous so it absorbs oils from the
&gt;   tobacco.  Smoking tobaccos with a higher oil content (ie naturally
&gt;   flavored instead of using sugary flavor additions) provide more oil
&gt;   that can be absorbed.  This produces the graceful characteristic of
&gt;   the style.  The pipe can also absorb oil from your hands.  When the
&gt;   pipe was manufactured, the bowl was covered with wax to inhibit the
&gt;   oils from being absorbed into the pipe from the outside.  This wax
&gt;   will become hot enough to melt when you smoke your new pipe.
&gt;   Touching the bowl may remove wax so some people wear gloves.
&gt;
&gt;From a brochure entitled "Why buy Meerschaum" - C.A.O Meerschaums - 1985
                                                1-800-BEST CAO (?sill valid?)

                WHY BUY MEERSCHAUM?

Simply put, because it affords a unique smoking experience. Meerschaum is
the most flavorful and beautiful pipe you can own. Meerschaum - one on the
most porous substances found in nature - acts as a filter,  absorbs tobacco
tars and nicotine, and yields a most satisfying smoke. Meerschaum smokes
cool and dry with a flavor unrivaled by another pipe. As it ages,
meerschaum colors a rich honey-brown, improving both in appearance and
taste.

Meerschaum Pipes - with a minimum of proper care - will last for a
lifetime. They will not burn out as briars do.

A CAO meerschaum is an investment in smoking pleasure

                ENJOY THE ARISTOCRAT OF PIPES.

As beautiful as meerschaum is to the eye, its true beauty must be
experienced.

A meerschaum is made to smoke.

Hold it. Enjoy its light weight and silky feel, its distinctive taste, its
ripening to a mellow golden-brown.

Justly deserving its reputation as the "aristocrat" of pipes, the
meerschaum is not meant for the connoisseur alone. All pipe smokers can
appreciate the unique pleasure of meerschaum.

                MEERSCHAUM - A GIFT FROM THE SEA.

"Meerschaum" is a German word meaning literally, "sea-foam," alluding to
the belief that it was the compressed whitecaps of waves. Meerschaum is a
mineral - hydrous silicate of magnesium - of organic origin. Composed of
the fossilized shells of tiny sea creatures that fell to the ocean floor
millions of years ago, meerschaum is found in red clay deposits. The
average size of the meerschaum blocks extracted from the clay is about the
size of a grapefruit.

                THE JEWEL OF ESKISHEHIR

Meerschaum deposits of the highest quality are found only in one place in
the world - in the small city of Eskishehir in central turkey. And here the
deposits are confined to an are of only 4 square miles. 

Mined with hand tools, and by men trained in this singular family
tradition, meerschaum is excavated at depths ranging from 200 to 300 feet.
The miners wash the raw meerschaum lumps and sort them into 5 categories
according to quality. Each of these 5 categories is further divided into 12
qualities according to size, color porosity and homogeneity of the
mineral." 

"The BLOCK-MEERSCHAUM - not to be confused with pressed meerschaum - is
shipped to the manufacturer. And only the purest 10% of this block
meerschaum is judged suitable for CAO pipes.

                CRAFTING THE WORLD'S FINEST PIPES

Nearly 300 years ago, the first meerschaum pipe was carved by hand. And
today, these unique pipes are still carved by hand.

The carver, a craftsman of unique ability and long experience, examines
each piece of meerschaum, calculating the lines of cleavage along which it
should be split.The split block-meerschaum is soaked in water for 15-30
minutes until the material achieves a cheese-like consistency. 

Working with the softened material, the carver determines the rough shape
of the pipe before the bowl and draft hole are bored. Like all fine
hand-crafted articles, no two meerschaums are alike.

The carved meerschaum goes into a kiln at high temperature, a process that
removes all moisture from the mineral. The shank is threaded and fitted
with a stem.

After meticulous polishing with the finest grade abrasives, the meerschaum
is ready for waxing. Though there are many different wax formulas, beeswax
alone yields the rich coloring associated with the finest Meerschaums.
Melted and then bleached, the beeswax is ready to receive the pipe itself.
The subtle differences in color and tone among CAO pipes are intentional,
achieve ed by careful dipping of the pipes a specific number of times.

Finally, the slightest imperfection detected in the finished pipe means
that it cannot wear the CAO name. The quality of each CAO meerschaum is
thus insured.

                SOME DO'S AND DON'TS FOR CAO MEERSCHAUM SMOKERS.

DON'T be afraid to handle or hold your meerschaum with clean hands.
Remember, you purchased a meerschaum primarily for your smoking pleasure.
The "Added" pleasure you derive from a meerschaum is watching it color as
you smoke it. 

The conventional wisdom on this topic is that handling a meerschaum while
warm removes the beeswax coating on the pipe, which highlights its
coloring. While this is true, only the purist - the smoker far more
concerned with the look of his pipe than his own smoking pleasure - need
wort about it. Besides, you can replace the wax coating removed by
handling very simply with CAO's Meerschaum Antiquing Compound.

DO take care when removing the stem of your CAO meerschaum by pulling it
and twisting it CLOCKWISE while supporting the shank with the fingers.
Replace the stem by pushing it and twisting it CLOCKWISE also. A little
care here will be repaid through a lifetime of smoking pleasure.

DON'T tap your CAO meerschaum against a hard surface. If you tap it in your
palm, be sure to support the shank firmly with your hand. This is sound
advice for briar pipe smokers also.

DON'T worry about "breaking in" your CAO meerschaum. Meerschaum pipes,
unlike briars, do not burn and hence need not be protected by a carbon
"cake" inside the bowl.

DO clean the cake or reside inside the bowl of you meerschaum. Use a
sharp-edged, blunt-ended tool. Avoid digging into the heel of the pipe when
cleaning the graft hole by not allowing the pipe cleaner to extend too far
into the bowl. [The meerschaum is WET and SOFT in the heel immediately
after a smoke. - whm.]

Smoke your favorite blend in your CAO meerschaum. Each pipe will color
differently. However this process depend on how often you smoke, not on
what tobacco you smoke.

Your CAO meerschaum dealer will be pleased to answer any further questions
you may have about our pipes. Be suer to ask about CAO's complete line of
meerschaum accessories.

Remember also who smokes CAO meerschaums: presidents, statesmen, doctors
and businessmen - people in all professions, all lines of work - and you.

This has been typed with benefit of meerschaum lined calabash, a truly
light weight, large bowl pipe.

Sitting on my pipe shelf is my "Caveman Kit" pipe. I don't recall the
vendor, it was purchased at Holt's many years ago, it was a "carve it
yourself" meerschaum. A pre-drilled block (bigger than my fist),
instructions and beeswax. It smokes as well as my professionally carved
CAO and was fun to do.

&gt;   I also have a question about the pipe I've got. I know
&gt;   diddley about its composition, but the bowl is terribly pitted. Little tiny
&gt;   holes all over. Why might this be, and is it bad?
&gt;
Hmmm....Never heard of a pipe described as "pitted," especially with
"little tiny holes all over." However, assuming that the pipe is in fact
"whole" that is to say - these little tiny holes are only surface "holes",
and do not go through to the bowl... What you are likely the possessor of is
a pipe with a "sand blasted" finish. 

There are two basic pipe finishes - "smooth" or "sand blasted." 
There are as many different variations on both finishes as there are pipe
carvers or manufacturers, but those are the two categories that everyone
seems to use in describing the finished product.

With a smooth finish pipe, the briar is polished as any piece of wood
using varying degrees of abrasive until a high sheen is achieved -
essentially the same as a piece of fine furniture. The pipe is then buffed
and possibly waxed, much like a meerschaum.

A "sand blasted" finish is intended to enhance the grain structure of the
briar. Yielding "interesting patterns" in the surface of the pipe. Some
say it is a "more rugged" look. Here, quite literally, abrasive is blasted
against the briar causing the softer parts of the bowl to be abraded away
leaving the raised grain showing. Depending upon the kind of abrasive used,
the kind of briar, the "mood" of the craftsman all sorts of different "looks"
can be achieved.

&gt;          I just recently aquired a used pipe, a very interesting one to say

&gt;   Does anyone have any ideas on how I can identify this pipe?
&gt;
The most well known of the leather covered pipes is/was the French
Longchamp. They have the name and "Longchamp/France" stamped in the leather
up near where the mouthpiece joins the body. Also, if I remember correctly,
(I bit thorugh the origial and replaced it) the stem has a running horse
in white.

<a name="8">Subject:  Pipes Digest - ?FAQ vs Resource Guide?</a>

Maybe the FAQ is just an appendix to the Resource Guide - or vice versa?

Here's a start. The definitions are "pretty good." They come from all over.
Some need more research and flesh - like the different types of stems,
tobaccos, etc.
--------------------------&lt;cut here&gt;--------------------------------
PIPE:   Narrow tube of clay, wood, etc. with bowl at one end for drawing in
smoke of tobacco. - Oxford English Dictionary

PIPE TYPES

BRIAR:  This is the closely-grained burl joint between the stem and roots of
the White Heath, a tree found on the hillsides of mainly Mediterranean
countries. Underground, this burl protects the briar wood, which is tough,
close grained, porous, and nearly impervious to heat. Good briar is hard to
find. The larger shrubs take a long time to mature...and the older the
shrub the better the briar and thus your pipe. The most suitable root may
be 80 to 100 years old, and the finest pipe briar may be from a shrub over
200 years old... aged and mellowed by time. 

MEERSCHAUM: A German word meaning literally, "sea-foam," alluding to the
belief that it was the compressed whitecaps of waves. Meerschaum is a
mineral - hydrous silicate of magnesium - one of the most porous substances
found in nature. Composed of the fossilized shells of tiny sea creatures
that fell to the ocean floor millions of years ago, meerschaum is found in
red clay deposits. Meerschaum deposits of the highest quality are found
only in one place in the world - Eskishehir, in central Turkey.

AFRICAN BLOCK MEERSCHAUM comes from Tanzania, Africa and is usually stained
in varying shades of brown, black and yellow.

MISSOURI MEERSCHAUM: The All-American Corncob pipe. It is a length of
hollowed-out corncob, usually from a special hybrid variety of corn, with
a straight wooden stem and, sometimes, a inexpensive plastic mouthpiece.
Some veteran pipe smokers buy corncobs by the dozens, smoke one until it
burns out or goes sour, then throw it away and light up another. (If a
youngster uses yours to blow soap bubbles, buy another.)

CALABASH: A South African gourd similar to a squash grown specifically for
use in pipes. The shape is determined as the gourd grows by placing small
blocks under the stem, forcing it into a gentle curve. The mature gourd is
cut and dried, then fitted with a cork gasket to receive a meerschaum bowl.
The finished pipe offers one of the coolest, driest smokes available. 
Immortalized by Sherlock Holmes and in Jimmy Durante's signature line - 
"Good night Mrs. Calabash - wherever you are."

CLAY PIPE: Clay or pottery pipes were very popular in England and in Europe
before the discovery of briar. In London coffee houses and clubs,
long-stemmed "Church wardens" and "London Straws" were universally accepted.
The finest clay for pipes is said to be found in Devon, England.

HOOKAH: Also known as a WATER-PIPE. The Turkish hookah filters the pipe
smoke through water (or booz) for extra coolness. Many styles of hookah
exist including those with multiple mouth pieces so that several may enjoy
the hashish simultaneously.

OPIUM PIPE: An Oriental water-pipe, normally made of brass with a very tiny
bowl used for smoking opium. Opium pipes are frequently seen with 12 or 18
inch long stems and fancy braiding.

CAST IRON: Normally used to carry natural gas.


PIPE PARTS:

BOWL: The part of the pipe that holds the tobacco.

HEEL: The base of the inside of the pipe bowl. 

SHANK: The part of the pipe that joins the bowl and the stem.

STEM: The part that connects the shank with the bit. 
Examine it carefully. Its quality, finish and fit will reveal the maker's
carelessness or attention to detail. 

BIT: The part of the pipe stem that fits in the mouth. Also called the
MOUTHPIECE. 

BITE-PROOF STEM: A bit designed with a solid center portion at the mouth to
prevent the "canine" tooth from punching a hole in it as readily as is done
in a standard bit. 

AMBEROID STEM: A fusion of Bakelite and pure amber - usually used with
meerschaum pipes.

BAKELITE STEM: Trade name for a synthetic resin widely used for lacquers
and varnishes and as a plastic.  A common material used for the stem,
especially of mass produced pipes. An alternative to vulcanite.

AMBER: brittle, feels like glass to the teeth - Usually used with
meerschaum pipes.

VULCANITE: A dark-colored variety of India rubber that has been subjected
to vulcanization : also called "hard rubber." A common material used for
the stem, especially of mass produced pipes. 

Lucite: Trade name for a plastic. A common material used for the stem,
especially of mass produced pipes.  

HORN STEM: Animal horn - often found on inferior meerschaum pipes

BONE STEM: Animal bone - often found on inferior meerschaum pipes

PIPE ACCESSORIES:

PIPE CLEANERS: Indispensable - two types - "soft and fluffy" to dry up
moisture or "thin and wiry" to dig out deposits.

LIQUID PIPE CLEANERS: Also called PIPE SWEETENERS, dissolve the gum and tar
while leaving a fresh aroma in the bowl, stem and mouthpiece. Frequently
featured in the "Dennis the Menace" comic strip.

SMOKERS COMPANION: Also called MULTI-PURPOSE PIPE TOOL, a spoon, a pick,
and a tamper in a metal holder. Usually built like a pocket knife, often
accompanied by a "knife blade reamer."

PIPE REAMER: A tool for smoothing out the "cake" and trimming it down to a
desired size. Reamers come in a variety of shapes and functionalities. 

PIPE RACK: A storage place for your pipes. To most enjoy pipe smoking one
needs several pipes to accommodate one's moods and activities.

HUMIDOR: A thing in which to store tobacco. Ideally - cheap and air-tight
(try Tupperware) - one places fresh tobacco in it and once sealed, it will
maintain the tobacco in a smokable consistency indefinitely. A major
alternate use of a humidor is the "re-moistening" of dried out tobacco.
For this action one adds a source of moisture to the tobacco in the humidor
before sealing. 


PIPE TERMS:

CAKE: A small layer of protective carbon allowed to form and remain in the
bowl of a briar pipe. The cake protects the briar from burning but too much
cake can split the pipe by causing uneven heating of the bowl.

DOTTLE: Unburned tobacco left in the heel of a pipe.
        

PIPE STYLES:

1-Freehand
2- smooth finish
3- sandblast

DUBLIN: An Irish style, shaped after the clay pipe.

BENT: A curved stem pipe

OOM PAUL: A large-boweled bent stemmed pipe name for the Boer leader who
smoked this variety.


TOBACCO:

TOBACCO: A member of the plant family "Solanaceae" which also includes
tomato  and potato plants. Around 40 kinds of tobacco exist. 

QUALITY: Tobacco is graded by leaf type and quality. There are five grades -
choice, fine, good, fair, and low. These are set by the tobacco's
uniformity, texture, age, oil, body, coloring,  etc.

NICOTIANA: The botanical name for tobacco after Jean Nicot who introduced
tobacco into Europe around 1560. 

RALEIGH, SIR WALTER: He popularized smoking at Queen Elizabeth's court
around the mid 16th century and was believed to be the first to smoke a
pipe in England. 

Tobago: Columbus discovered it in 1498, and according to legend, named it
after the shape of a Carib pipe smoked on the island.

FLAKE CUT:

Basic blending tobaccos:

VIRGINIA - red / black / lemon / orange / orange-red
The mildest of all blending tobaccos has the highest natural sugar content.
Used in virtually all blends as it is a good burner and aids in lighting.
It imparts a light sweet taste when used in moderation

BRIGHT  - From the Carolinas
BURLEY  - "white Burley" - a natural tobacco taste with a soft character
that will never "bite."

CAVENDISH - Cavendish is a process of curing and a method of cutting
tobacco leaf; the term does not refer to a tobacco, but a type of
manufacturing process. The processing and the cut are used to bring out the
natural sweet taste that is a characteristic of Virginia tobacco. This
process will create a tobacco very light in taste, quite mild and easy to
pack. Black - Traditional Navy Cavendish, aged naturally with dark
Jamaican rum .

"Taste" tobaccos:
PERIQUE - From Louisiana
Havana  - From Cuba
Yenidji -

Oriental "spice" tobaccos:

LATAKIA - From Syria/Cyprus (richly smoked and fermented)
Latakia was "discovered" when a bumper crop resulted in surplus, and the
excess tobacco was stored in the rafters.  The  village farmers
traditionally used camel dung (or other dung, I suspect) as a source  of
fuel, and the smoke cured tobacco was revealed the following season.
Today, Latakia is smoked over a smoldering fire of aromatic herbs.  The 
camel no longer has to process the herbs first!

DUBEC   - From turkey
XANTHI  - From Macedonia
KOMOTINI- From Macedonia
DRAMA   - From Macedonia
SERRES  - From Macedonia
SAMSUN  - From the southern coast of the black seas
IZMIR   - From Western Turkey


Cigars

CIGAR: The Mayans are believed to be the first to put a cigar on the
pedestal it deserves. German philologists translated the Myan noun "Zik"
for tobacco or smoke, and "zikar" the verb form. Thus the word "cigar"
evolved and was recognized in many ancient drawings and carvings. A Myan
carving dated circa 300A.D. depicts a long tubular roll of tobacco in the
mount of an obviously happy man.

  Steve, 

  After a four state search, I was finally able to find 
  La Gloria Cubanas at Smokers' Gallery in Ft. Lauderdale Fla.
  I bought the last two complete boxes he had in stock after (double
  coronas) which the owner said that he wouldn't receive new stock for 
  several weeks because of demand. Lucky me.

  They are of excellent quality and taste, and the price ($1.60 each) 
  made the search well worthwhile.  Nothing quite like sitting by the 
  pool and smoldering a good cigar (especially during the week that the 
  Eastern US was hit by the worst winter weather in 50 years :))

  There have been a lot of questions about humidor systems. I use one 
  that might be of interest for those that want to store a larger number 
  of cigars.  I bought a five gallon aquarium with cover at a garage sale 
  for $20, and a thermometer/hygrometer at a hardware store for $10. 
  I keep the cigars in the original cedar box (or you can buy them for 
  about a dollar at a tobacconist). 
  
  With a plastic tumbler and a sponge as a source of humidity I have been 
  able to maintain it at 65F and 60% R.H. by adjusting the sliding lid 
  slightly.  A ten gallon (or greater) aquarium would accomodate the boxes 
  better, but (like a true Ham operator),  I used what was on hand.  
  Otherwise, this system is terrific. 

  73,
  Mark K.

[ Tnx for the notes! Hope your humidor is working swimmingly :-) -S. ]

Steve, I'll be traveling around Europe this summer (after a grueling 5 years
of university) and I was wondering if there are any countries where I just
simply "have to" pick up a pipe.  I figure Denmark is a good bet.  Any other
suggestions?

Also, I have really enjoyed the reviews of different pipe tobaccos.
Could the experienced guys out there maybe ramble a little more about
different generic types (like cavendish) and the flavours associated
with them (mild, aromatic, fruity, etc).  This would be useful for us
beginners.

Thanks.

Dave.

[ Denmark would be a good bet. Ireland too, for the Petersons. Maybe
France (Butz-Choquin and I believe GBD), England (Dunhill), and Italy

I've been subscribed to the digest for quite some time now, but this is
the first time I've written.  I've got a few questions for everyone. 
First, has anyone ever heard of fanto leaf?  I believe it's from Jamaica. 
The only use I have ever heard for it has been to roll cannabis with it (
which is what I smoke when I don't smoke Tobacco)  So has anyone ever seen
a cigar wrapped in it? Second I have a pipe that I found in my basement
(which is strange because no one in my family smokes a pipe), and it is
carved in the shape of a bison head, complete with horns that go into his
head.  Does anyone know who made this pipe, or ever seen one?  Also, to
everyone in New York, as well as everyone else, I went to the Rennaisance
Fair in Oswego Last summer and there was a pipe carver there who made
Fantastic meerschaums and calumets.  Once I find the address, I'll post
it. All you need to do to get a catalog is to send a post card.  Is there
any way to get briar to carve my own pipes?  I've heard about using
mountain Laurel root, but I'd feel bad for taking the roots because its a
beautiful plant.  Are there any other woods that are good to carve? 
Finally, My cigar of choice is a 45 ring Montesino Numero Uno with a
Maduro Wrapper.  Does anyone have any suggestions for a good cigar along
those lines ( namely below 2 bucks and a real good smoke).  Well I'd
appreciate any input, so so long and happy smoking.

And, first off, we have a couple of administrative questions that I'd
like your opinions on -- whether to create a cigars-only group, and
whether to gateway the list to the Pipes &amp; Cigars area of the
Wine/Beer Forum on CompuServe. The relevant letters follow; enjoy!

And, BTW, there was some traffic on rec.woodworking this week about
building humidors. Still a hot topic! 

Plus, in this issue, a plea from Canada (this may be an opportunity
for USers in search of Fidel's Finest), word on the Hubble (Bubble,
not Telescope), and much more! -S.

I'm new to this list, so I apologize if this has been discussed before.

Has anyone ever suggested segregating Pipes Digest from a not-yet-
created Cigar Digest?

I can't be the only subscriber who is interested in one but not in
the other.

Hi, Steve!  I'm the Associate Sysop of the CompuServe Wine/Beer Forum, where
Ben Ricci is the leader of our Cigars &amp; Pipes section.  Ben told me about
your Internet Pipe Digest and suggested that we consider subscribing and
sharing some of your mailing list's discussion across the
CompuServe/Internet gateway.
 
Because Ben doesn't have direct Internet access and has to pay long-distance
charges to reach CompuServe, he's asked if I'd mind being the forum's
contact point by taking a subscription to my mailbox.  I'll collect the
postings, trim off the address material, ZIP them and pass them on to Ben,
who'll -- with your permission -- post conversations from them to our forum
and encourage our members to reply back to your list as well as in our own
round-table discussion area.
 
Although I'm not a smoker (used to be, smoked my last cigarette on St.
Patrick's Day 1974 and don't dast risk a seegar or pipe for fear I'll fall
off the nicotine wagon), I've been very interested in the tobacco
discussions on our forum, and can see clear connections between serious pipe
and tobacco appreciation and wine appreciation, so this topic fits right in
to our area of interest.
 
Assuming your approval, I'll look forward to reading your digest and sharing
it with our members online.
 
Thanks!

<a name="4">Subject: Re:  Pipes Digest</a>

Steve, thanks for the info on pipes.  Looking at its length, I know Ben's
going to appreciate getting a compressed copy! &lt;grin&gt;
 
To answer your question, I don't know how familiar you are with the way
CompuServe forums operate, but you could say that our forum is more like a
BBS system than a mailing list.  Members post messages on the public board,
and other members can read them and post replies, all of which are open for
reading and comment by all comers.  This feature is quite busy and
fast-moving, and messages have a "shelf life" of only a few days before they
scroll off.  We also have "libraries," which contain longer files of general
information, available to members by keyword search.  This is where I expect
we'd plan to cross-post the Pipe Digest, in an area normally habituated only
by smokers and serious fanciers of fine tobacco. We also have live online
conferences at scheduled times (usually Wednesday evenings) when members can
gather in real-time and communicate directly via their keyboards.
 
We DON'T, however, have a mailing-list type facility. We don't send material
out by mail, but make it available on CompuServe's mainframes where users
can log on, read it, and post replies if they wish.  I guess a moderated
Usenet newsgroup is the closest 'net analogy.
 
The forum is moderated in that we have a staff of managers (sysops like me
and "section leaders" like Ben) who try to maintain information in the forum
in clear, easy-to-access form and keep things organized.
 
To be quite frank, we have NOT found "flaming" or harassment to be a
problem. CompuServe is not inexpensive -- in fact, jokers online refer to it
as "Compu$erve" -- and while Usenet by its nature hosts a large number of
college students and young folks, CompuServe's published demographics are a
bit more mature.  By its nature, our forum attracts adults, and the general
tone of the place is one of shared interest in a common hobby.  Even though
neither Jim Kronman (my sysop partner) or I are smokers now, we've
established a firm principle that the purpose of our Cigars &amp; Pipes section
is for people who enjoy fine tobacco to have a welcoming place to discuss
that hobby online.  We haven't had an infestation of anti-terbackky folks to
this point; if we did, I expect we'd probably all enjoy the debate for a
little while but would begin to self-censor it if things got repetitive or
tiresome.  And if necessary, the sysops would take the necessary steps if it
devolved into harassment.
 
These are just random thoughts, actually, spurred by your comments, about a
problem that hasn't happened and that we hope won't happen. I hope I haven't
bored you with a long reply, but I wanted to be as candid as possible in
responding to your reasonable concern.
 
We'll look forward to reading your digest!

<a name="6">Subject: Digest 127: Hookahs</a>

&gt; HOOKAH: Also known as a WATER-PIPE. 

occasionally hubbly-bubbly, but that may be restricted to US expatriates.

&gt; Many styles of hookah
&gt; exist including those with multiple mouth pieces so that several may enjoy
&gt; the hashish simultaneously.

Hookahs are Turkish only by grace of history, since what used to be Turkey
used to own most of the middle east.

The implication that hookahs are used only for hashish is ethnocentric.
In most of that area, one is as likely to sit in a sidewalk cafe and
"drink smoke" from a rented hookah as one is to sip coffee. 

And a possible interesting addendum to this topic in the FAQ:

The tobacco used in the hookah is usually dried whole leaf, soaked and
crumbled, or canned, mixed with various herbs and flavors. The very moist
tobacco is heaped into the bowl and covered with a small charcoal fire.

(Very convenient, BTW, for staying lit through a long afternoon of quiet
philosophical hammocking. The whole leaf I have burns for _hours_. I haven't
gotten the Indian herbal blend to work yet.) 

Fume quietly,

&gt; From: "William H. Magill" &lt;??????@????.?????.???&gt;
&gt; &gt;   Someone on the list wrote that he tends to have bad experiences with
&gt; &gt;   "real cigars" and cites as an example the Romeo Y Julieta a friend
&gt; &gt;   brought back from England.
&gt; &gt;   Look, Cubans, general, and that cigar in particular, are much stronger
&gt; &gt;   than your average Dominican or Jamaican cigar.  And, in my view, Romeo Y
&gt; &gt;   Julietas are the most poorly made modern Cuban cigars.  Try some good
&gt; &gt;   Dominicans before you reject the good ones categorically.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; This comment is not quite complete.
&gt; 
&gt; ANY tobacco product, especially cigars, from the "continent" is STRONGER
&gt; than the "American" version.  This follows the general American proclivity
&gt; for "watered-down" versions of the real thing - like beer. It turns out
&gt; that today not only do American breweries churn out barrels of Lager
&gt; instead of Ale, but that Lager is only 4.0%! When I was in the military in
&gt; the late 60's, 3.2% beer was served at the PX and referred to as "Panther
&gt; P..." 

Not to be argumentative, but I think this response deserves some elaboration.
Most quality cigars imported legally into the US today com from either 
the Dominican Republic or Honduras. A few may still come from other 
Carribean Islands, such as Jamaica, and a few come from Nicauragua, 
Mexico and Brazil.  Focussing on Honduras, the Dominican Republic, and 
Cuba, generally, the Honduran cigars tend to be stronger than the 
Dominicans, and the Cubans tend to be stronger than the Honduran.  There 
are exceptions.  For example, La Fontanas (from Hondura) tend to be 
rather mild and sweet.  Contrast the Honuran Punch cigars (not to be
confused with the Cuban Punch cigars), which are quite strong (other than 
the vintage Puch cigars, which are not so strong.

&gt; In the cigar world there is a style called EMS or European Market Selection.

I always thought that the EMS stood for "English Market Selection" and 
was more a medium brown.

[snip]
&gt; 
&gt; And as for Romeo Y Juleita being a Cuban? I have a brochure from the
&gt; company on the occasion of their re-introduction to the American Market
&gt; after a 20 year absence (circa 1982). They characterize themselves:
&gt; 
&gt; "Romeo Y Julieta is an old and respected name in the cigar industry. We
&gt; believe it to be the last of the really famous Cuban brands to re-enter the
&gt; American Market." They go on to describe their quest to find new tobacco
&gt; sources until, "We found the two bends that would more than fulfill the
&gt; desires of the most discriminating of cigar smokers world-wide."
&gt; Cameroon Deluxe from the Dominican Republic and "All Cuban Seed" from
&gt; Honduras. The implication is clear from their brochure that they have moved
&gt; all of their production from Cuba to these two locations - "Cuban-born
&gt; supervision," "Cuban-born rollers," "Cuban seed," expatriate Cuban cigar
&gt; experts," etc.

That may be the implication, but it is my understanding that that isn't 
quite right.  Most of the popular cigar brands have at least two alleged 
owners, the Cuban government and the growers who left Cuba with their 
seeds to set up shop elsewhere in the Carribean.  Hence there Romeo Y 
Julietas made in Cuba (which, as I said before, are very mediocre cigars) 
and, recently, RYJs from the Dominican Republic, which aren't bad.
Similarly, one can get Partagas made in the Dominican Republic and 
Partagas made in Cubas.  These are not made by the same folks.  the same 
is true with Cuban and Honduran Punch cigars.

On the other hand, Davidoff used to buy tobacco from Cuban, but recently 
stopped.  Their Davidoff line is now exclusively Dominican, and their 
Zeno line is Honduran.

For a truly delightful Cuban cigar, if you have access to them, try a 
Cohiba Robusto.

&gt; DOTTLE: Unburned tobacco left in the heel of a pipe.

Thanks, I didn't even know there was a name for it!
&gt; 
&gt; LATAKIA - From Syria/Cyprus (richly smoked and fermented)
&gt; Latakia was "discovered" when a bumper crop resulted in surplus, and the
&gt; excess tobacco was stored in the rafters.  The  village farmers
&gt; traditionally used camel dung (or other dung, I suspect) as a source  of
&gt; fuel, and the smoke cured tobacco was revealed the following season.
&gt; Today, Latakia is smoked over a smoldering fire of aromatic herbs.  The 
&gt; camel no longer has to process the herbs first!

Another illusion shattered, as I sit here smoking a rather pleasant 
Latakia blend &lt;VBSEG&gt;

&gt; Steve, I'll be traveling around Europe this summer (after a grueling 5 years
&gt; of university) and I was wondering if there are any countries where I just
&gt; simply "have to" pick up a pipe.  I figure Denmark is a good bet.  Any other
&gt; suggestions?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I have really enjoyed the reviews of different pipe tobaccos.
&gt; Could the experienced guys out there maybe ramble a little more about
&gt; different generic types (like cavendish) and the flavours associated
&gt; with them (mild, aromatic, fruity, etc).  This would be useful for us
&gt; beginners.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.

&gt; 
&gt; [ Denmark would be a good bet. Ireland too, for the Petersons. Maybe
&gt; France (Butz-Choquin and I believe GBD), England (Dunhill), and Italy
&gt; (too many to mention).  -S. ]
&gt; 

The best European deal I ever saw was a a Dunhill #3202 style pipe for 
about 80 pounds in a pipe shop in Bath, England.  This was when the pound 
was equal to about $1.50.  I recently priced the same pipe at Georgetown 
Tobacco at $375.

WOW!  Quite a collection of info to glean from Digest #130!  I'm almost out
the door to pick up a Meerschaum and desert the cigars for good, but I'll
have to think about it over a Fuente.

On to other things, I have to be especially thankful for the recent warming
trend here in the north country.  I'm sure I'm not alone in breathing a sigh
of relief for the relief, but I've always had a particular fondness for
enjoying a cigar and taking an idle walk around.  I found the campus here to
be a great trip.  But, this activity is totally beyond my metal when the
temps are toying with negative numbers.  At one point I toyed with the idea
of clipping cigars into thirds and taking very fast walks, but that fever
passed thankfully.  So, Mother Nature's recent respite from winter has me
feeling like I've got an old friend back. (warm fuzzy feeling comes over
those assembled)

Lastly, I've just racked off a batch of a Dutch Lager that SHOULD be quite
nice.  I sampled some at a brew store and tried to recreate the recipe.  And,
so, to round out the "international thing" I'm looking for some suggestions
on some nice Dutch cigars to complement.  The beer is heavily hopped and will
be on the bitter side, not as sharp a stout, but I'm trying for the "Heineken
thing".  So if anyone is relaxing with a nice "Heinie" (and the latest issue
of the Newslett), and any thoughts of a proper cigar pop into your head,
write 'em down.  Have a cold one for me, too.

<a name="12">Subject: Heartbreak Pipe</a>

I haven't been to the States in quite a while.  Which means that I
haven't been able to buy cheap Amerikanski tobacco in quite a while,
either.  Mind you, since the government realised that it was either
going to have to lower tobacco taxes or start shooting Indians; the
excise situation will have improved a bit.

So there I was in Winston and Holmes in Yorkville, picking up a couple
of hundred grammes of Latakia-heavy tobacco (why do people on this
group use the term "tobak"? Is it Danish or something?), and I was
looking at the pipes on the wall.  And a salesman smells my desire to
buy a pipe from across the room.  And he's showing me some of their
reasonable standby stuff.  And I tell him that it is all very nice,
but I never buy sandblasts; and I like a medium-sized bowl with a
dead-straight vertical grain running to an eyeball on the heel.

Well, he says, have you ever looked at an Italian pipe?

No, says I, I haven't.

So he opens up a case and starts taking out these beautiful
blond-coloured Costello pipes.  Every one has a dead-straight vertical
grain.  Every one feels light as ... well, light as a Stanwell.  And
there she was ... blonde, delicately curved, silver military shank,
with a sexy vertical oval shape that made my heart stop.

You have sold me a pipe, sir, says I.

Excellent, sir, says the salesman.  That will be nine hundred
ninety-eight dollars plus GST and PST (which, incidentally, would add
another hundred and fifty dollars).

Well, I uttered a groan of heartfelt pain.  There she was, right in
front of me; and there I was facing the prospect of blowing my then
strong cash position by spending my rent and car-payment money on this
gorgeous Italian blonde.

You have broken my heart, says I to the salesman.  Then I walked over
to the proprietor so that he could overcharge me for my tobacco; and
told him that he should be ashamed of his employee; who was using the
charms of his wares to tempt upright young men into inappropriate
behaviour.

Oh, but it was hard to leave the shop, and hard to walk home that day.  

Remember this, and don't let it happen to you!

Cheers,

Aryk Nusbacher

Thanks for the newsletter from the pipes group. I found it
interesting and informative and will look forward to it.  Now, I
have a question for the group which, perhaps, you can help  me
with.

I am embarassed to have to admit it, but I live in a country where
a conspiracy of health bigots and tax gougers has made the price of
tobacco outrageous.  Recently, however, as you may know, the
Canadian smoker, by resorting to widescale smuggling (amazing and
encouraging!), has forced the government to reduce taxes on
cigarettes, and several of the provinces have followed suit.  Mine
(Manitoba) has not.  Hence, in Ontario, the price of cigarets is
half (23/carton) what we pay here (approx 45/carton).  If I were a
cigarette smoker, I would have several means of availing myself of
these greatly reduced prices. Alas, I smoke pipes.

What I need to know, then, is this:

     First, have pipe tobacco prices dropped accordingly in the
Provinces which have accepted the reduced cigaret taxes; and,

     Second, can someone from Ontario/Quebec/another province
supply me with the names and addresses of dealers or individuals
from whom I can order my pipe tobacco supplies?

I would very much appreciate a quick response to this and thank you
in advance for any help you can provide.  

Thanks,

Salve', all!

	Well, it occurs to me that I've yet to actually introduce
myself here, which is curious considering I've become something of
a deferred-to expert.  Yes, I am *the* Laszlo, who maintains the
infamous Smokelist of luxury cigarets.  I've been around since the
ill-fated rec.tobacco RFD, and have since been active in alt.smokers.
I updated the Smokelist a couple weeks ago, adding flavour comments
and including the finds I unearthed over Xmas at the legendary Paul's
Pipe Shop in Flint, MI.  The big guy himself was absent, but a darling
little old lady took us upstairs to see the "museum" and show us around.
They had the actual pipes used by every winner since the late 1940s in
their annual pipe-smoking contest!

	In this contest, each entrant gets a small, measured quantity
of tobacco (3 grams?  About a tablespoonful, anyway) and two matches.
The second match is taken away if you don't use it to relight within
the first minute.  The object is to keep it lit for as long as possible;
the record is just over *two*hours*!  Egad.

	They also had all manner of strange and kitschy lighters,
promotional items, strange pipe designs through the years (one had
a black plastic cage holding a quartz-glass bowl--very '40s/'50s
looking), and a few displays of old, defunct brands of cigarets.
One had even been offered as a diet aid (called "Trim-A-Way" or
something, with a '50s stylized hourglass-figure silhouette)!

	Then, back downstairs to the cool, clammy humidor, where
they kept all their cigars *and* import/luxury cigarets.  These
cigarets could be 10 years old, and still fresh!  Every nook and
cranny had something bizarre or quaint to offer.  My "buy" stack
reached higher and higher.  I wound up spending *$50* on packs
of cigarets!

	I do smoke a pipe very rarely, but quality cigarets are
my forte', only smoking 1-5 cigarets per day.  I've got a whole
rationale for why cigarets, but I'll save that for another time,
another Digest.  I bought a Fuente 8-5-8 Maduro the other day,
as my first "real" cigar, and while it was *nice*, it didn't make
me a cigar "true-believer" as I'd half-expected, judging from
comments here. %-}  For the money ($2.25), I could've had a couple
weeks' worth of smoking satisfaction from a pouch of rolling tobacco.

It's getting about time to try the rec.tobacco group again, isn't
it.  I mean, with the amount of participation in this newsletter
(and a darn GOOD newsletter, too), rather than direct the frag-
mentation of it, how about giving another shot at a newsgroup?

While I don't smoke a pipe, I still enjoy some of the talk about
it.  And I do appreciate the hospitality of the pipe smokers for
having so much cigar talk.  Maybe the case is stronger now for
rec.tobacco.pipe, rec.tobacco.cigar, and rec.tobacco.loose.  Or
just plain rec.tobacco?

volunteer to spearhead the effort, when we can propose it again in
April? This time, I'd probably go for rec.misc.tobacco, to placate the
namespace purists -- or at least to deprive the antismokers of an

&gt;
&gt;   Steve,
&gt;     I'm not an enthusiast, but have a Cherokee friend who ekes out a bare 
&gt;   existence recreating native artifacts, including a wide variety of pipes, 
&gt;   using natural materials...
&gt;     He does everything from raccoon paw medicine bags to custom-carved 
&gt;   ceremonial pipes.
&gt;     Not much of a businessman, though.
&gt;     He travels the country, selling to museum gift shops, selling at pow 
&gt;   wows, etc.
&gt;     I'm trying to get a perspective for how this business is conducted and 
&gt;   help him identify resources and marketing methods.
&gt;
&gt;   [ Maybe check out sales through the magazines? Sierra, Utne Reader,
&gt;   etc. might be a good place for that sort of thing. -S. ]
&gt;
Steve, Don't know if you want to put this in the digest, but...

I would say that the trick would be to join/affiliate with  a "guild."

I don't know the geographical area of your friend but here in the east
there are a number of "Craft Guilds." Several very strong ones in North
Carolina and Pennsylvania that I know of.

Basically, these are organizations of "craft persons" - whatever that
means. For example, my cousin makes plaster "models" of "famous" buildings,
paints them and sells them. They are "artistic" renderings of say,
Independence Hall. The guild runs a physical shop as well as a number
of "juried" events year long. A juried crafts show is where participation
is permitted only to people who are designated "craftsman" - essentially
to differentiate them from "flee market quality" stuff. Consequently the
goods produced - and the are everything from corn-husk dolls to fancy
cabinetry - command (potentially) higher prices than things simply sold
as "trinkets." Additionally, at on of these shows, the Artist pays a flat
fee to participate (varies depending on the show) and sells directly to the
public for whatever they want. The guild also has a number of "outlets"
(non affiliated commercial contacts) where a particular shop is looking for
a particular kind of goods. The guild acts as a clearing house putting the
artist in contact with stores looking for their kind of goods.

Generally speaking, however, this is a VERY hard way to make a living.
My cousin would put 5-10 hours into painting a house only to sell it for
$25 bucks! Pretty poor hourly wages WITHOUT counting materials costs.

The real problem is that except for the very top tier craftspeople, nobody
is willing to pay big bucks for something "hand made."

If you succeed in making a "gallery" contact - that can change. There the
gallery does the merchandising and pricing for you. The downside is that
you typically sell to the gallery low and they sell it high. Until they
sell "lots" and your name becomes known enough to create/attract a
following who will pay more money directly to you - it's pretty rough.

One other venue for your friend to explore - Scottish Highland games.
Virtually all of the "games" have a vendor area where almost anything can
be found, albite with a Celtic flavor. There are a couple of carvers and
sculptors who frequent many of the games. There are games held virtually
every weekend someplace in the US. 

One particular tie of interest here. One of the US Indian tribes (I don't
know which one) has a "license" from the Federal Government to sell,
especially, Eagle Feathers. A clan chief is entitled to wear one, two or
three feathers according to rank. This is a rather limited market, but
whenever one of those who are "Chief of the Name" is the guest of honor
at one of the games, his clansmen will often make a presentation to him (or
her) accordingly as they do wear out (get broken, mashed in travel, etc)
and are apparently NOT available in the UK!

The second related area is the "medicine bag" or as we call them "sporin."
In the Kilt "uniform" this is a large (typically about 8x8x2 inch bag worn
on a chain around the waist - which carries not only Scotch (for medicinal
purposes) but keys, matches, pocket knives, wallets, etc. - ie a handbag
or purse, if you will.

The "neat" sporins are animal head pelts. The head forms the flap which
hinges over the opening at the top. I happen to have one made of a muskrat.
A friend of mine has one made from a red fox - a gorgeous accouterment!

One final area... there is a magazine "Tantra."  Which despite its Taoist 
origins has made sizeable "New Age" inroads. (If you know Tantra, you can
guess why.) At any rate, the latest issue (it's a quarterly) has a number of
ads in it for spirit drums, ceremonial feather fans and the like.

&gt;  The other item I'm looking for used is a Dunhill "theatere pipe."  It's 
&gt;  black and the bowl is slightly flattened to slip into a suit jacket pocket. 

You can't have mine.... 

I have had a Comway "vest pocket pipe" for about 30 years now. It is more
than "slightly flattened!" The pipe is about 1" wide by 2" long and 2 1/2"
high with the stem "folded back. " The stem attaches "virtically" and when
"unfolded" looks like a "bent." Rotating the stem 180 degrees allows one
to, quite literally,  slide it into one's vest pocket. The stem is only
as long as the bowl is wide.

                          "========    
                +-------+ "
                |       | "

                |           |
                +-----------+

It has a surprisingly large bowl (deep) and still smokes quite well.

Hello Steve,

I have no objection against a seperate cigar digest, but I will
also like to continue the pipe digest. It is just interesting
for me to read both things (And I do not want to miss the
stories of both Bill's!).

With regard to humidors: The Dutch Cigar Association
"Coupe-cigares" also did some investigating with regard to
humidors. They found out that the best humidity to preserve
cigars (European and cuban cigars) can be gained by using water
with salt. So not plain water. In this way the humidaity is at
the right level. Remeber the water must be satuarated with salt.

All the best,

Victor

[ Don't understand why the salt helps... in any case, there've been no
takers yet to start the hypothetical cigars-only group. -S. ]

&gt;And, first off, we have a couple of administrative questions that I'd
&gt;like your opinions on -- whether to create a cigars-only group, and
&gt;whether to gateway the list to the Pipes &amp; Cigars area of the
&gt;Wine/Beer Forum on CompuServe. The relevant letters follow; enjoy!
&gt;[ I replied to Robin, expressing some concerns about member privacy
&gt;and the possibility of flame wars. He replied: ]

Although I much prefer pipes to cigars, I enjoy the extra information
about cigars once in a while.  If I don't have time, I just push the
PageDown button and it disappears.  I handle "flaming" in much the
same manner (unless it's truly deserved).  While I admit keeping the
two subjects together in one digest decreases the signal to noise
ratio for both groups, I'd probably join both groups if they were to
separate.  As far as CompuServe posting goes, the more the merrier.
Other groups (such as the homebrewers) run a mailing group which
posts to a UseNet news group.  There is some commonality, but mostly
it gives me more information.  That's why I join a group like this in
the first place, to share ideas, opinions, and resources.

&gt;Subject: Wooden Shoes and all that...
&gt;
&gt;WOW!  Quite a collection of info to glean from Digest #130!  I'm almost out
&gt;the door to pick up a Meerschaum and desert the cigars for good, but I'll
&gt;have to think about it over a Fuente.
&gt;
&gt;Lastly, I've just racked off a batch of a Dutch Lager that SHOULD be quite
&gt;nice.  I sampled some at a brew store and tried to recreate the recipe.  And,
&gt;so, to round out the "international thing" I'm looking for some suggestions
&gt;on some nice Dutch cigars to complement.  The beer is heavily hopped and will
&gt;be on the bitter side, not as sharp a stout, but I'm trying for the "Heineken
&gt;thing".

I hope you decided on the meershaum even though a Dutch Freehand
might be a better ethnic pairing.  Perhaps an English blend so the
Latakia will stand up to the hops.  How dark is this beer?  The stout
only accomidates the heavy hopping because it is such a heavy style.
If you've made a lager with only 4-6 IBU's, maybe a Virginia would be
better to round out the flavor.  My personal favorite is a stout made
with lots of Black Patent malt and a Roasted Cavendish.

Steve: As a pipe smoker AND a cigar smoker I'd object to having the NL split
into two. Bandwidth accessibility is getting precious and I don't want to be
forced to choose. As a Compu$serve section leader in a couple of forums I
certainly have no objection to the NL being shared on the wine/beer forum
there. Of course you realize that you'll be making more money for the Wizops
on that forum by increasing forum traffic.
 
Re the great moisturizing debate: Here's the way I was taught a couple of
hundred years ago. Empty your pouch, container etc. into a mixing bowl. Take
a spray bottle and gently spray the _top_ of the pile of tobacco. Mix
thoroughly with your hands. Blot tobacco with paper towels and replace in
pouch. Works fine without adding flavor the way slices of apple/orange/etc.
do. BTW I keep my tobacco in a ceramic container from Gevalia designed to
hold coffee. Has an airtight seal; works fine. Gevalia gave the container
away as a premium for buying two one-lb. samples of their coffee.

thought that someone would like to start up an offshoot, specialty

<a name="12">Subject: The continuing saga...</a>

Well, I went to the Tinder Box in Rockville, and quickly got to the bottom of
the little tiny holes in my pipe. Most of them look like pinpricks, but some
seem to be growing larger along the grain. (See where this is going yet,
Watson?) Well, the guy at the shop informed me of my basic problem: my pipe is
not made of briar. Those little holes are some characteristic of whatever
wood(s) my "composition" pipe is made of, and a signal that sooner or later,
I'm going to have one busted pipe. Oh well, the thing cost me less than 15
bucks, and now I know I like pipe smoking well enough to get a good one. Does
anyone know if there's a way to save this thing other than retire it
completely? Being that it's my first pipe and all, I'd like not to lose it.

Which brings up another question: why are there no Tinder Boxes in the Resource
Guide? Is it just a prejudice against chains? Which is OK with me; I try to
support the small businessman, and I know the large business is easy enough to
find in the Yellow Pages. Just wondering. It is kind of interesting to note,
though, that the one in White Flint Mall in Rockville, MD, is the _only_
smoking area in the mall. It's in their lease that the right to smoke in the
tobacconist's shop shall not be abridged. Let's hear it for the crafty
entrepreneur!

As for separating cigars into their own list, I'd really prefer only to
subscribe to one digest. I'm not discouraging anyone from starting their own
group; I'm just appealing that no smoker of good will ever be run out of this
group. Hey, a good blend is the secret to good smoking!

OK, that was corny enough to make me shut up. See ya in the smoking lounge...

Steve:
I am new to the newsgroup (#131 was my first issue). I really
did enjoy the pipe digest and found it a refreshing change from some
of the "flame fests" that you see on alt.smokers. Regarding the
suggested separate cigars-only newsgroup, it seems it would be
a sound idea. As a "pipe only" smoker, I know little about cigars
and I am sure that there are many cigar smokers out there that have
little interest in pipes. In any case, that's my 0.02 cents worth.
By the way, can anyone suggest a decent tobacco shop in northwest
NJ? I lived in the DC area for many years and really miss G'town
tobacco on M St. Maybe one of the newsgroup subscribers can suggest
a comparable shop in my locale. Keep up the good work.

<a name="14">Subject: PipeWorks &amp; Wilke closing &amp;c.</a>

I have been reading and enjoying the digest long enough; it's time I
contributed. First, some comments on questions from #132.

As a pipe smoker only, I generally skip over the cigar discussions in the
digest. If there is enough interest, a separate digest might be in order for
cigar smokers. (I don't object to cigars, I just don't have any interest in
them).

As far as archiving on CIS, I see no harm in it; you are unlikely to get any
contributions from CIS'ers, however. A number of CIS fora collect
internet-distributed mailings and news in their libraries. They are typically
used more for reference than avid reading as far as I can tell.

My other news is a mailing I just got from Pipeworks &amp; Wilke in NYC. As you
probably know, Pipeworks was originally the shop of Elliot Nachwalter, who is
a skilled pipemaker. A number of years ago he bought the Wilke pipe shop on
Madison Avenue. He continued both for a while, then closed the Madison Ave
shop, leaving only his shop on West 55th Street. The announcement I received
says that he is now closing the 55th street shop, and will do mail order
business only out of Manchester, Vermont. For the month of February, he is
running a closing sale of all merchandise in the 55th street shop. Discounts
range from 30% on his own pipes (which generally range from $50 to $1,500) to
60% on third party merchandise. In addition to his personal line and the
Wilke line, the shop specializes in high quality estate pipes. The sale is
available by telephone; you can call the shop and they will describe what is
available in your price range. If you order anything and don't like it, it is
returnable. While I will miss the shop, the sale is nice. I visited him on
Feb 28th, and I'll probably be back a couple more times before he closes.

Dear Steve

My name is Vance Burns and I receive hard copy of this mailing from Mr
Dollar so I asked him to post this info.

I am, by preference, a pipe smoker but I do enjoy reading about others
interest in cigars (I hold an R&amp;J as I type). Please don't separate
it. It's no trouble, and frankly, there isn't enough on pipes to speak
of. You need the cigar folks to fill it up.

To help out a little:

I enjoy pipes of all brands and english style tobaccos. But after
acquiring my umpteenth pipe I discovered tobacco books. Already a book
buyer, I found tobacco related material added much pleasure to my
enjoyment of the craft. I got started indirectly by my interest in
George Simenon's character Inspector Maigret. Maigret's ever present
pipe, and his meditations on it captured my interest. 50+ novels
later, and still going. 

The best book for the pipe smoker is Carl Ehwa's "The Book of Pipes
and Tobacco". Full of salient and obscure information not to mention
still photos of fine wood that are in themselves an art form. I've
ended up with three copies. If you are familiar with the McClelland
tobacco, Carl's widow, Mary, is the owner.

I recently purchased a few books from a dealer in tobacco antiquariana
and hit upon a real gem. The book is Sublime Tobacco by Compton
Mackenzie, 1957 London, 357p. Certainly gifted (the fly lists over 40
other non tobacco works by Mr. Mackenzie) it is without a doubt the
best account of tobacco history I've come across. The first 62 pages
are entitled "Prologue: My Smoking Life" and are some of the most
entertaining stories I've ever read. In the remaining pages Compton
details the record of the herb from it's beginnings to its post WWII
heyday. Throughout he rails against the British tax system, a kindred
spirit to smokers and non. He chronicles pipe, cigar, cigarette, snuff
(he made snuff interesting), and variants. Highly recommended, if you
can find it.

I shall end with a little vignette. In the early 1800's two ministers,
one a rather poor parson and the other a blue blood (I remember his
name was Thorn) where traveling together via coach. Thorn, having run
short of his own custom made smokes, requested a cigar from his poorer
companion. After a few puffs he threw it out the carriage window and
exclaimed "Anyone who would smoke a cigar that bad would steal!"

Thanks
Vance

[ Thanks for the note, Vance, and I quite agree that Ehwa's book is
worth having. -S. ]

Dear Steve:

		Here is some basic information about me and my world of
pipes and tobacco.  My first and favorite pipe is a black sandblast Comoy
Rockroot.  It smokes excellent and gleams with beauty.  I also have 2
Petersons, which are excellent as well.  

 		As for tobacco blends, my favorite is a local blend
called "Blackberry Cordial."  The aroma is divine, and the flavor.....I
cannot begin to describe it.  My favorite tobacco shop is Cascade News and
Tobacco.  They boast the largest humidor in the Pacific Northwest, which
is pretty profound.  I also associate myself with the T. Wittacker Tobacco
shops sometimes, as well.  Another favorite blend that I enjoy (the name
varies from shop to shop) is a straight heavy vanilla black Cavedish. 
This, I think has the sweetest flavor one can find.

		I believe that just as a bride is meant for her husband so
is the pipesmoke meant for the fireplace (in which fragnant wood is burning).
Or perhaps the shady pattio on a warm summer's evening.

In pipes and tobacco,

A man and his pipe, who can separate?  What two things are more enjoyable
around a warm fire with man's best friend and his calabash gourd reading

<a name="18">Subject: Pipes Digest</a>

Thanks for putting me on your mailing list.  I've found the issues very 
interesting.  I'm all in favor of someone starting a Cigars-only digest 
as I'm a pipe smoker.  I do enjoy a cigar once in a while, but I've been 
a pipe smoker since the third weekend in May 1958.  Over the years I've 
acquired a large number of pipes.  In addition to the usual briars and 
meerschaums, there's a few made of cherry wood, zebrawood, rosewood, 
olive, bubinga and a calabash.  I've had clay pipes, but I kept chewing 
off the stems.  Does anyone remember Baronite pipes?  

I've seen the humidor thread in the rec.woodworking newsgroup, but down 
here in south Florida keeping tobacco from drying out is not a problem.  
I'm more interested in making pipe racks.  I've tried my hand at carving 
pipes.  It gives you a real feel for how hard briar really is.

If you get down to south Florida, I recommend a visit to Bennington 
Tobacco.  Jim is second generation in the business and is quite 
knowledgeable about cigars and pipes.  He has a huge walk-in humidor 
stocked with all sorts of good cigars, including Davidoff.  He also has a 
large selection of pipes by Comoy, Dunhill and others.  He's put on some 
interesting shows in the store from time to time.  One of the better was 
a Floridian wood sculptor turned pipe-maker, Randy Wiley.  Randy brought 
down some roughed out pipes and was working on them as we talked.  He has 
a real feel for how to get the best out of the grain of the pipe and they 
smoke great.  

The store is located in the Royal Palm Plaza at 501 SE Mizner Blvd, Boca 
Raton, FL, 33432-6003.  The family's original store is located at 
5 Fillmore Dr/St Armands, Sarasota, FL 34236-1425.  I know you'll get a 
friendly welcome.  They also do mail order.  You should add them to your 
list.

Have you heard any rumors about a $15/pound sin tax that Clinton is 
proposing on pipe tobacco? 

Bob Ewart                             ????????@????.????.???

[ Yes, we have. But that's not the worst of it. We've also heard that
the FDA is talking about classifying nicotine as a drug.. thereby
immediately outlawing many forms of tobak. Write your congressthing --
I did! Ask me if you need a list of their names.

And if he/she makes inane arguments about children, as Senator
Lautenberg did to me, tell 'em what I wish I had. I don't want to see
any kids hurt, and wouldn't consciously do things to hurt them. But,
when they grow up, I'd want my kids to have the same freedom we've had
to make our own choices in life -- for better or for worse, like
adults. We don't need Uncle Sam to be our lifetime nanny. It's not in
his job description, anyway. -S. ]

tobacco in a refrigerator to keep it fresh?  It seems to me that it would

			    THE BETROTHED
			  by Rudyard Kipling

	    'You must choose between me and your cigar' -
		*Breach of Promise Case, circa* 1885.


Open the old cigar-box, get me a Cuba stout,
For things are running crossways, and Maggie and I are out.

We quarrelled about Havanas - we fought o'er a good cheroot,
And *I* know she is exacting, and she says I am a brute.

Open the old cigar-box - let me consider a space;
In the soft blue veil of the vapour musing on Maggie's face.

Maggie is pretty to look at - Maggie's a loving lass,
But the prettiest cheeks must wrinkle, the truest of loves must pass.

There's peace in a Larranaga, there's calm in a Henry Clay;
But the best cigar in an hour is finished and thrown away -

Thrown away for another as perfect and ripe and brown -
But I could not throw away Maggie for fear o' the talk o' the town!

Maggie, my wife at fifty - grey and dour and old -
With never another Maggie to purchase for love or gold!

And the light of Days that have Been the dark of the Days that Are,
And Love's torch stinking and stale, like the butt of a dead cigar -

The butt of a dead cigar you are bound to keep in you pocket -
With never a new one to light tho' it's charred and black to the socket!

Open the old cigar-box - let me consider a while.
Here is a mild Manila - there is a wifely smile.

Which is the better portion - bondage bought with a ring,
Or a harem of dusky beauties, fifty tied with a string?

Counsellors cunning and silent - comforters true and tried,
And never a one of the fifty to sneer at a rival bride?

Thought in the early morning, solace in time of woes,
Peace in the hush of the twilight, balm ere my eyelids close,

This will the fifty give me, asking nought in return,
With only a *Suttee's* passion - to do their duty and burn.

This will the fifty give me. When they are spent and dead,
Five times other fifties shall be my servants instead.

The furrows of far-off Java, the isles of the Spanish Main,
When they hear my harem is empty will send me my brides again.

I will take no heed to their raiment, nor food for their mouths withal,
So long as the gulls are nesting, so long as the showers fall.

I will scent 'em with best vanilla, with tea will I temper their hides,
And the Moor and the Mormon shall envy who read of the tale of my brides.

For Maggie has written a letter to give me my choice between
The wee Little whimpering Love and the great god Nick o'Teen.

And I have been servant of Love for barely a twelvemonth clear,
But I have been Priest of Cabanas a matter of seven year;

And the gloom of my bachelor days is flecked with the cheery light
Of stumps that I burned to Friendship and Pleasure and Work and Fight.

And I turn my eyes to the future that Maggie and I must prove,
But the only light on the marshes is the Will-o'-the-Wisp of Love.

Will it see me safe through my journey or leave me bogged in the mire?
Since a puff of tobacco can cloud it, shall I follow the fitful fire?

Open the old cigar-box - let me consider anew -
Old friends, and who is Maggie that I should abandon *you*?

A million surplus Maggies are willing to bear the yoke;
And a woman is just a woman, but a good Cigar is a Smoke.

Light me another Cuba - I hold to my first sworn vows.
If Maggie will have no rival, I'll have no Maggie for Spouse!

Several people has asked, here in the Digest, or directly to me, where to
find a good pipe shop and/or places worth-a-visit in Denmark. I just put a 
small list together of the most interresting shops/museums in the Copen-
hagen area.
If you always wanted a first, danish handmade don't miss these shops while
visiting our country. The prize level of these pipes is far lower than in the
US. A true, first handmade can be purchased for around 1500-3000 kr. (220-
440 US$). Stanwell's and Georg Jensen's sell for 150-1500 kr. (22-220 US$) 
in Denmark. More expensive pipes can be found off cause, but they are rare.
If you need more detailed info, feel free to drop me a note...

<a name="5">Subject: review of a Kirsten pipe...</a>

	i recently got a Kirsten pipe, and thought i'd review it for the
	list.  i got the address from the pipes resource directory and
	called and asked for a catalog.  i talked to a very nice woman
	on the other end, and the catalog came a couple of days later.
	Kirsten pipes have a so-called "Radiator" stem that is supposed
	to remove the steam from the smoke.  it's made of aircraft-grade
	aluminum, and looks way cool.  i bought a 0.25 bent "Horizon"
	which has a small stem, a medium briar bowl, and a Ebonite
	mouthpiece.  they also have straight and full bent stems in black,
	silver, and brass finishes.  bowls are available in medium,
	large, and extra large.  medium is a good size for me as i
	usually don't want to spend a lot of time on a bowl full.  cost:

ATTENTION CIGAR SMOKERS

Not having the time myself to administer a mailing list, I have instead 
successfully created a USENET newsgroup.

It is called:

alt.smokers.cigars

It is up and running.

Enjoy!

[ We have it at Rutgers (the site I read alt.smokers from), but it's
empty there. Maybe our membership can generate a little cigar traffic?

Hello Steve,

You asked why the salt in the proposed humidor. That is to
garanteed a stable 70% of humidity in the humidor. If you only
put water in a humidor, all water will evaporate (in principle
there is no other limit then 100%;-). In case of a saturated water
salt solution, there exist a natural equilibrium of 70% humidity
above the water/salt solution.

And because 70% seems to be the optimal humidity, this should
be a good start.

All the best,

Victor

And, for cigar enthusiasts, I'd heartily recommend checking out Rex
Wockner's new creation, alt.cigars. _Mucho_ traffic, almost no
flamage, and it's only about a week old! (Personally, I find it
excellent for a lot of the bitching and moaning I won't do in the
Digest... :-)

It's good to be back from NYC -- while we didn't make a mint, we
didn't lose our shirts, either. And I won the first door prize -- a
nice presmoked Barling with a birds-eye end grain! Also the first
Barling in my collection.

BTW, Neil Murray asked me to display his A&amp;M Digest 1994 Pipe
Calendars, but I'm sorry to say that his flyers didn't arrive in time
for me to take them up. We'll try to make it up with a plug here. If
anyone would like to order Neil's pipe calendar, contact him at:

	Neil Murray
	Agricultural and Mechanical Gazette
	47758 Hickory
	Apt. 22305
	Wixom, MI 43893

The calendars are normally $12.50, but are $10 to the netizens here.
You can also try to reach Neil at ????.??????@???.???, but the return
mail's been somewhat flaky.

Also of note: Check out the JR Cigar catalog. The ad copy alone makes
it my fave catalog, next to Mo Hotta Mo Betta. Call 1-800-JR-CIGAR for
your copy!

And now, even if you don't have the Pipes Calendar, it's the right day
to have a few puffs of yer favorite smoke, as we enjoy the

I am preparing to go to the Washington DC area within the next couple of days
and I was wondering if you knew of any quality pipe shop/tobbacconist shop I
should seek out while there.
I was told that this upcoming week was national pipe smoking week, so I hope
to find some real good deals.  At my local shop I purchased a meerschaum for
$12.00 (normall $30.00) and got 4 oz of tobacco free.  What a bargain!

I'm curious how many folks out there care for Indonesian clove
cigarettes ... I like my pipe, but most times when I'm looking for
that contemplative mood, there is nothing quite like a nice aromatic
clove cigarette and a cup of freshly brewed coffee ... Yum!

I've tried a bunch of different makes, Djarum, Sampoerna and so forth,
but have settled on the Sampoerna Internationals.  Nice and aromatic,
plus the tobacco has an interesting flavor.  Can't really recommend
the Xtra's though ... tried one this morning for the first time and
hated it!  

It appears that the Xtras are targeted at the US menthol smokes :-(
The tobacco is pretty lame and there is a really strange character to
them that is probably supposed to be clove, but really isn't.  Ugh.

I see that the only Albany listing is:

&gt;The Smoker				(Pipes Digest #127)
&gt;Albany, NY
&gt;518-462-1302

Their street address is 136 Washington Ave.  Very pipe-oriented place!
I normally go to a place called Edleez Tobacco (Styvesant Plaza,
Albany, 518-489-6872) that caters more to the cigar crowd.  They have
a walk in humidor that is about 15ftx25ft, and jam packed with just
about every brand you can imagine. They even keep reference copies of
Cigar Afficianado in the humidor to look at while you are browsing!

That's right, over thirty new members since last week! We're doing
terrific, folks! Largely through the publicity Rex Wockner's
well-met alt.smokers.cigars group has generated. 

But now, unfortunately, it's time to face a few facts.

		  *** Warning -- Politics Ahead ***

I'm glad we have all this interest, because we're going to need all
the help we can get.

Legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress (by Frank
Lautenberg, D:NJ) that would make it a crime to smoke in any public
place, at all, ever. That means no more brandy and 8-5-8s after
dinner, folks, even if we rent the hall. No more sitting by the
fireside of the inn with a pipe and a beer. Pass out cigars at the
wedding and you'd risk getting busted. Use a lighter, go to jail.

Frankly, I think this violates First Amendment right of peaceful
assembly for legal purposes. Unfortunately, it's already the law in
Maryland. And it's spreading. We simply can't count on RJR and Philip
Morris to defend our rights anymore.

And that ain't all. It comes in combination with the heavy tax
proposals on cigars and pipe tobacco, that may put many smokeshops out
of business. In combination, these events have convinced me that there
may well be a coordinated and powerful effort to wipe out tobacco in
the U.S. Including pipes and cigars. Including smoking in
moderation. Including smoking in the privacy of our own homes. And,
unless we act now, the posession and sale of tobacco will be
criminalized in the United States within the decade.

I'll repeat that. It's important.

*** Unless we act, NOW, the posession and sale of tobacco will be ***
*** criminalized in the United States within the decade.          ***

Please help stop the Second Prohibition. Speak out. Write your
elected representatives and your local media. Find out which
candidates protect your rights, and which ones abuse them; vote as
appropriate, and let the candidates know why you did. Send their names
here and I'll put together a list.

And from now on, the following lines will separate the intro from the
features. I think it's that important. Let us work together so that we
can continue to

				Smoke in peace,
				~\U Steve.

&gt;Victor. Perhaps one of our chemically astute readers could help me

Let's give this a try.  Suppose that your humidor's humidity has
decreased to 30%.  The water in the cup of saturated salt solution
has the "choice" of staying in the cup with the salt or leaving as
water vapor in the humidor.  Victor's observation is that the water
will continue to leave the cup until the concentration of water vapor
in the humidor reaches 70%.  This causes less water to be in the cup
to keep the salt in solution.  The salt will drop out of solution
into the bottom of the cup.  You then need only to add water to the
cup until most, but not necessarily all, the salt is re-dissolved.

A soak stone works on a similar principle.  Water has the "choice" of
staying in the stone or evaporating into the air in the jar.
Saturated salt solution offers one additional advantage.  If the
humidity in the jar is greater than 70%, the water would "rather" be
in the salt solution than in the air.  This is water is more likely
to condense on the sides of a glass jar than on a soak stone.

&gt; 
&gt; I am preparing to go to the Washington DC area within the next couple of days
&gt; and I was wondering if you knew of any quality pipe shop/tobbacconist shop I
&gt; should seek out while there.
&gt; I was told that this upcoming week was national pipe smoking week, so I hope
&gt; to find some real good deals.  At my local shop I purchased a meerschaum for
&gt; $12.00 (normall $30.00) and got 4 oz of tobacco free.  What a bargain!
&gt; In any event I hope you can help with addresses and phone Numbers .  Thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; [ Check out the Georgetown Tobacco Shop, I think. Hope this is in 
                             ^^^^^^^

Also, JR Tobacco at 17th &amp; K, Draper's at 14th &amp; G, Cigar Club 
International at the Grand Hotel, and John B Hayes Tobacco at the Fair 
Oaks Mall in Fairfax County, VA.

Hi Steve,
    my pal forwarded me yer Pipes digest. Is a nice idea and I will
read from now on...
    But I have a little question you may answer. I have heard that
Americans (I am from Czech republic, Europe) have discovered a new
material which is much better and much cheaper than bruyere. IS IT
RIGHT?
    I've also heard that plenty of smokers DO want this mew material
(kinda plastic) more than classical bruyere. IS IT RIGHT?
    I study economics so I think that this will probably terribly
decrease prices of classic wooden pipes. It may come to Europe for
within two months. IS IT POSSIBLE?

You may (of course) add this to next Pipes digest, but I would
appreciate your answer to my E-mail since I don't know when will I
get next Digest.

Bye bye
Jaromir

   I guess a little personal information is in order. I'm a college 
student here in scenic Delaware and I have learned to get a great deal of 
pleasure out of a relaxing cigar. I am in the process of trying different 
brands and sizes but I have discovered a fondness for Macanudos. I have 
also subscribed to the alt.cigars newsgroup (where I found out about your 
digest) and am eager to try some of the brands mentioned in there. There 
are very few good tobacconists in Delaware, the best being in the lobby 
of a VERY expensive restaraunt, so I go to a little place off the beaten 
path with a decent supply for me to start off with. I would like to use 
your service more or less as a menu of what's out there and then try to 
smoke as many of them as I can. I hope this is enough of a "personal 
note" for you and look forward to your digest.

<a name="9">Subject: Autobiograpy</a>

I am a 46 year old unemployed Systems Engineer leaving in the greater San 
Francisco area.  I have been smoking a pipe since I was in the Navy -- 
1966.  

I exclusively smoke a heavy English mixture (English Oriental Supreme 
from American Tobacco).

I worked for a year and a half in the early seventies as a tobaccinist in 
Southern California for several shops including one on the Queen Mary.

My pipe collection is large.  After 5 business trips to Turkey last year, 
I have been mainly smoking my Meerschaums.  The most notable pipes in my 
collection include a hand carved ivory pipe from Japan (unsmokable), a 
very large 3/4 bent Camoy (age unknown) and a very large (6" long by 7" 
high, not including stem) meershaum in the shape of a dragon.

Finally, an addition for the resource file:

Meerschaum Pipes personally handcrafted

Unfortunately, Bilal-bey does not speak English, but his teenage son 
does.  I have been very happy with the 20 or so pipes I have purchased 
from him.  His prices range from about $10.00 to $300.00, with anything 
over about $30.00 having a case.  I know he has done some mail order 
business with the US.

Things are going pretty well... First, I got a letter to the editor
published in the Hunterdon County Democrat, about public smoking bans
and the First Amendment right to peaceful assembly for legal
purposes. Next time you see yourself getting bashed in the media, take
arms against the sea of troubles! (But, dhang, I wish there was some
real leadership in the smokers' rights movement that I respected...)

Second, just put down earnest money on a house in Kingston. It has
ample deck space, so that I can smoke my 8-5-8s (thanks, Kam!) without
bothering the sweetie. :-) Wish us luck!

So, looking forward to a new home and a more tolerant America, let's
lean back, light up, and lighten up as we discuss stagecraft,
lighting, and Cole's Law...

Well, looks like you beat me to the punch.  I've received my first pipes 
digest and haven't sent in an intro yet. Here goes...

I'm a project engineer with Iwerks Entertainment, a large-format and 
specialty theatre systems company and I enjoy both pipes and cigars.  I 
have been smoking a pipe for about a year or so now - my cigar-smoking 
friends and I decided it was somehow less offensive - but am still getting
the hang of it.  I can't help but feel I'm commiting some major rookie 
moves now and then and am extremely reticent to pack it in public - so 
any basic advice you can offer would be appreciated.

Light _is_ bad for cigars, which is why they're boxed. ;)  A cigar store
will have one open box of every brand for the person who wants to buy
individual cigars, but humidors should not let light in, unless you only
keep boxes of cigars in it.

Thank You for adding me to your list. My name is Adam Bourque I'm a

Steve-    
     I needed a little pipes advice.  I have your FAQ/Starter guide, but I 
needed a little something extra.  I originally joined your list for cigar 
smoking chat, but I find myself wanting to try a pipe (while it's still 
legal :-).  I have ordered a catalog from a pipe company in Chicago (Iwan 
Ries and Co.) and noticed they have Chacom pipes by Camoy for about $23.00.  
I also noticed a Peterson "second" in a pipe shop for $25.00.  Which do you 
think would be the better pipe?  I really don't want to jump in with both 
feet (and wallet) and find that I don't enjoy it.  What do you think?

first week of April is often like that. However, we do have some good
news to report... I've proposed a new newsgroup, "alt.smokers.pipes,"
and will create it on April 15 unless someone manages to talk me out
of doing so. Ah, the beauty of the alt. hierarchy... light up as we

Regarding Mike Guentzel's question about
whether to buy a Peterson or a Comoy: I have
pipes from both companies and they are both nice.
However, I think I would give the nod to the Peterson
for overall quality. But they are both fine pipes.

this digest is dated April first hmmmm. Maybe that's what
we need though, a pipe smoking Surgeon General. I hope that
something can be done to stop this governmental meddling, or

<a name="5">Subject: It just don't get better than this...</a>

Wednesday brought about an unexpected joy.  After teaching two kid's
Kung Fu classes in the afternoon, with the kids a bit more rambunctious
than usual, this being Spring and all, I was in the mood for a relaxing
evening.  I asked my date if she would let me cook dinner for her,
rather than going out, which she found to be a delightful proposition.
After a refreshing Martini, I set about to prepare our repast.  A bottle 
of 1985 Crozes Hermitage annointed the soul, and the chicken Veronique
satisfied at least one of the hungers.  We spoke of all the wonderful
things one speaks about over romantic interludes. 

Supper finished, I built a fire and opened a 1980 Quinto do Noval Porto.
What goes quintessentially well with port?  A fine cigar, of course.  But, 
alas, I didn't suggest this.  

Now, this woman had commented before on how much she enjoys the smell 
of my pipe;  clearly the marque of a woman of discerning tastes.  When
I was selecting the wine for dinner, I gave her a bit of a historical 
tour of the wine cellar, followed by a glimpse of the humidor, in which
I have several hundred cigars ageing to perfection.  (I began buying 
twice as many cigars as I would smoke when I worked as a tobacconist.
These days, I more often turn to the pipe, though I still maintain a 
good supply of cigars, just in case a war breaks out, and I'll need 
supplies to tide me over. ;)

The fire crackled, and the port warmed.  "Would it be alright if we
shared a cigar?" she asked, as we looked deeply into one another's
firelit eyes.   

I'll say this: I have never enjoyed a cigar as much.

Smoke in Peace,
Gregory

<a name="6">Subject: Re: warning -- politics ahead</a>

Hello all of you,

I just want to react on the politics! I see a very dangerous
direction US is going to take. Is that freedom to choose for
yourself? And furthermore, because the europeans are eager to
follow the steps of the 'highle developed' US, I foresee the
same messures in Europe, and that freightens me:-(

I hope you are able to stop this development (is it
development:-(?), in your country. I though that your president
had also a e-mail-box, why not send him some e-mail ot better a
free copy of the digest! If you do not know the e-mail of your
presendent, I can find out;-)

BUt to elaborate a little bit more on smoking:
- oke, smoking things is for your own health not good
(irregardless of what you smoke). So this increases the medical
costs
- smoking gives me a moment of quietnees. So less stress, and
perhaps less costs for medical affairs.
- smoke can be terrible for SOME people, if they have some
kind of alergy or asthma. We as smoker should know that, and
not be blund on this kind of people. They have the right on
clear air.
- a lot of people just do not like smoking, because they don't
like seeing people smoke. They want to deprive us from smoking,
that that is BAD, because of a lesser personal freedom. These
should be convinced of other thoughts.

Just a comparison with something else. How many people die form
driving cars (as active cardrivers or as passive walkers/etc.)?
What does that cost on medical things?
Furthermore what about the polution (acid rain). I heard that
25% of the acid rain is due to car driving. That is also a kind
of passive effect through cardriving. What is that costing us
or will cost us?! I know already, that lots of woods in Europe
are dead because of the acid rain (and 25% due to cardriving).

Why do the people not work on that! Is that not a more
profitable area of work? Why work on smoking
cigars/pipes/cigattes, while the same people drive around with
cars that smell badly (certainly for e.g. asthmetic people),
kills a lot of people and produces a lot of acid rain. 

I know, comparision are always bad, but in some way we have to
stop this mad thing about nor being able smoking a peacefull 
pipe/cigar.
If people have ideas how this discussion shoulk be leveled,
please let us know. If US can not stop this mad idea about
smoking, Europe should be able to do it!

All the best,

Victor

[ Victor, thanks for your efforts, but I don't think emailing Clinton
is going to do much good. As Carly Simon once sang, "You know, you
can't talk to a man / when he don't want to understand." Far more
effective would be letters to the editor, rebuttal time on TV, or
organization. I hope you, and all our European readers, will act to
stop persecution before it gains a stronghold -- the U.S. government
and culture doesn't always do the best thing. -S. ]

<a name="10">Subject: Bans in the Public Interest</a>

Boy, Steve, I just read that entry on banning tobacco (I have
been following this for some time) and was struck by the almost
exact wording used by defenders of the Second Amendment rights.
Banning and/or taxing to put a stop to a product "in the interests
of the public" seems to be the new government pastime.

I too would like to urge all of you on the maillist to consider
writing in behalf of the entire Bill of Rights.  Even easier,
E-mail the White House.  Let YOUR leaders know that you don't
appreciate their intrusion into you lives.

Show that you use the products responsibly.  I don't randomly
shoot people and I don't blow smoke in their faces (except Joe
'cause he loves a good cigar).  I don't drink and drive, but
I love a good single malt.  All three of which may cause me harm
but I take the responsibility that it not cause YOU harm.

Do the majority of you out there feel this way, or do you want
to be legislated into a sterile existance (or jail)?  Rhetorical
question, since you're enjoying this fine newsletter.  So get
off the dime and write for your rights.

The E-address of the President (yes, Slick Willie hisself) is:

       ?????????@??????????.???

Please don't limit yourself to this, as every letter to your
congressman is worth a thousand votes.

<a name="11">Subject:      Re: Pipes Digest #137 - April 1, 1994</a>

Hey Steve,
Sorry to bother you, but I have a question if you have a second.

I was at my Mom's yesterday, and went through my late Dad's desk, and
found one of his pipes. Mom said I could have it, and she would save
any other pipes she found for me.

My Dad was not a die-hard pipe smoker, but before he retired I think
he smoked it at work more so than at home. So it looks to be in good
condition. But Dad was certainly no collector, nor a purist. He
probably would have never paid over $20 or so for a pipe.

When I pulled the stem off, I remembered. This pipe is designed for
you to bend a pipe cleaner in the middle, and stick it into the
shank(?) to act as a filter. I can remember Dad telling me that he
had found these pipes, which were very reasonably priced (it seems
like they sold two for one) from a mail order company. He also ordered
his tobacco from this outfit. Any ideas as to what kind of pipe this
is, or who sold it?

What about the concept, is that filter thing unique?

It appears to be broken in pretty well...looks like a good "carbon
cake" in the bowl (to a novice like me, anyway). Probably hasn't been
smoked in ten years or so...Mom hated pipes so he hung it up right
after he retired. The bowl still smells like that good tobacco he
used to smoke.

I'm sure I don't exactly have a classic on my hands, but of course,
it  is special to me. I'm thinking about firing it up.

BTW: I found a can of your "Balkan Sobranie" at a shop here. Maybe
I'll try a tin when If this pipe thing flies.

Thanks for any advice, Steve.......Have a great day.

Mark

[ I haven't seen cleaners used as filters... anyone have an idea what
sort of pipe Mark has? -S. ]

<a name="13">Subject: 2c</a>

Traffic was a bit light last week, so I figured I'd throw in
2c worth.  On the recommendations from the list, I tried some
Arturo Fuente 8-5-8's.  I found them quite pleasant.  Good
flavor, well built, good structural integrity, and fairly
consistent to the end.  The taste is somewhat on the light
side for the first 1/2" - 1" or so, but then it picks up and
is quite nice for the remainder.  The price is modest, and
the box is nice, too!  It's not 100% airtight, but I throw
a humidifier in the box and they're good for the 3 to 4
weeks it takes me to smoke them, obviating the need for a
humidor.

Bang for the buck, I'll stick to 8-5-8's from now on, over
my previous regulars - Romeo&amp;Julieta Cetros.

As for pipe smoking, I've tried it, and have stuck with 
cigars.  Perhaps I was doing something wrong, perhaps the
tobacco wasn't best, perhaps it was the pipe, but there
were a few things I didn't like with the pipe.  Don't take
this as pipe-bashing in any way!  Perhaps someone can 
suggest what I was doing wrong and offer corrective advice ...

  - awkward to hold in the mouth.  When I want to turn the 
    page of a magazine or paper, I need both hands free, 
    and a cigar hangs much more comfortably than a pipe.
  - doesn't stay lit.  Probably my greatest irritation.
    A good cigar needs a draw periodically to stay lit, but
    the pipe seemed to need much more, more frequently.  The
    darned thing would go out in 30 seconds.
  - burned hotter.  Because I had to puff harder and more
    often, it burned hotter, ruining the taste.  Not pleasant.
  - more fumbling.  If I let the thing sit for too long (not
    long at all), it went out, and had to be relit.  This
    could require remixing, retamping, relighting, etc.
    Perhaps it is inherent in pipes that more fumbling is
    necessary, and indeed some people seem to derive great
    pleasure from it (all the power to them).  But perhaps
    if the root cause - going out too readily - was solved,
    that would eliminate this problem for me.

Would a better quality pipe help prevent some of these problems?
Better quality tobacco?  Fresher?  If anyone out there has had
similar problems, and found a solution, please share it!

[ You might have it packed too tight, or too moist. Pack it so it's a
little springy, and perhaps let it dry out some. The object is to just
barely keep the bowl lit. Persistence pays -- eventually, you'll get
the hang of it. -S. ]

Sorry I have not been able to send the initial greeting and info. you

Anyways I am a student at the Univ. of British Columbia, in the forestry
faculty (there is nothing wrong with clearcuts so long as they are done
properly and there are still plenty of spotted owls in Washington,
Oregon and Northern California).  I was introduced to cigars a couple of
years ago and I have enjoyed these immensely.  Actually I just had a
"Bances - coronna de luxe" from the House of Horvath Inc. in Toronto.  It
was a bit more expensive than the others ($6 after PST and GST) but turned
out to be worth it.  It did have "Habana" on the box so it might be a no no
in the States but if you have a chance you might want to sample some of
Horvath's goods.

I begin to run on at my keyboard so...  I would now like to try pipes.
I know you have probably done so many times already but suggestions on a
good starter pipe and a mellow tobacco to go with it would be much
appreciated.

DEAR STEVE:

		Iwan Ries tobak/pipe company claims they have a brand of 
tobacco (Three Star Brand, I think) that "burns cool, dry, is filled with 
flavor, and----does NOT bite the tongue at all."  I want to know how a tobacco
can make such a boast.  I thought tongue bite was mostly dependent upon the 
pipe and not so much the tobak.  Now I realize that the condition of 
certain tobacco can make it apt to burn hotter than others (such as 
dryness, size of cut, and flavoring agents used in it).  But, Three Star 
boasts that all of their blends burn cool.  Is this a valid claim?  I 
know the only sure way know is to try it out, but . . .

[ In a word, no. Not because ***'s tobaccos aren't good, but because
cool burning depends on things they can't control, such as moisture in
the tobacco when you smoke it, and how hard you puff. -S. ]

Hello Pipe smokers, 
and thanks for adding me to the Group, Steve.
Well, to introduce myself, i'm a student and enjoy Pipes for
over ten years now. Among my favourite Pipes are some Petersons
and some Mastro de Paja (very nice italian handcarved ones) and
lots of others. Hmmm, sometimes it is a bit complicated to
explain to no-pipe-smokers (girlfriend:) why someone (me)
_needs_ a new pipe when he already has soooo many ones. 

Studying here in austria and living in germany I would be 
interested in opinions about which kinds of tobacco you 
(being in USA, GB, etc.) favor: any lovers of english 
(latakia scented) tobacco? Extremely perfumed tutti-frutti? 
For me, it seems to depend somewhat on the wheather:
Bright and sunny - fruity, rain and snow - more english one.
Any opinions? What about filters? Are they really "typical
german" or are they established in other countries, too?
Happy smoke,
Andreas

We bring you this edition of the Pipes Digest a day early, to report
on an event happening this weekend, which those at .com and .gov sites
might miss otherwise... the first, ever IRC Smoker! Happening this
Sunday on channel #cigars. See below for further details.

Also, look for the creation of alt.smokers.pipes, happening probably
tomorrow. The Pipes Digest will, of course, continue unaffected. So
relax, light up, and enjoy. But, as always these days:

<a name="1">Subject: new subscriber introduction + pipe filter answer to question</a>

Hi,

This is my first communication, so an introduction is in order. I'm a
graduate student in computer science. I've been 'out there' in the
real world and am returning to get more education, diplomas, and
creative energy for the future.

Some comments on current threads running through the digest:

A reader asked about using a pipe cleaner as a filter. I'm afraid
that's all too common when you just can't get the original filter ...
I have a Falcon pipe, bought in Scotland, made of aluminum with a
meerschaum lining (!) that comes apart and has two places you put
filters in: a ring shaped filter at the bottom of the bowl, and a
cylindrical filter in the stem. Not finding any of these in Israel,
where I lived, I would bend pipe cleaners and use them instead!

Regarding smoking in public and semi-public places. My general
attitude of live and let live compels me to avoid lighting up in the
presence of people who object to it, or in restaurants. BUT, I would
truly appreciate a restaurant, coffeeshop etc. which would create a
smoker's corner that was insulated from others, and reasonably
ventilated so WE don't choke on our own smoke. That would be a drawing
point for smokers (of which there are many). There is no need to
legislate against smokers, only FOR clean air for those who want it.
Remember how many activities are dangerous to your health, cost the
taxpayer money, and don't provide any benefit to others: sex (!),
children of welfare parents, sky-diving, hang-gliding, scuba-diving,
eating buttered popcorn, eating meat, chocolate.

How about writing about favorite pipes? Many have passed through my
hands over the years. Most I received as presents or mementos from
friends. I currently keep only three pipes. One was given to me by my
brother, who found it as a reject, because it had initials carved on
it, then wasn't picked up by the buyer. Coincidence would have it
these were my initials, so he bought it for me. One pipe belonged to a
close friend of my parents, who was like an uncle to me. He died in an
accident, and that is the memento I have from him (I don't remember
how it got into my hands). The third pipe is one I mentioned above, a
high-tech pipe with meerschaum lining in an aluminum body, filters
galore, wanting only a microprocessor to be perfect ... 8-)

I'd rather pick up pipes with histories than buy them. I feel the same
about growing a garden - I'd rather take seeds from friends' gardens
and grow in mine than 'shop' for a garden.

Hi there, I see from the news letter I just recieved that everyone goes by
their real names so I thought I would introduce myself.  My name is Michael
Kurt.  I'm a 23 year old student at Grandvalley State University in Grand
Rapids, Michigan.  Im majoring in accounting and have about another year to
go before I graduate depending on when I intern.  I have been smoking fine
cigars for about a year now, and find that few other things are able to give
me as much satisfaction as enjoying a cigar after a hard week of classes. 
Unfortunately, being a student on a limited budget I can only afford a few a
week.  Hopefully someday I will have enough money to build my own humidor and
stock it with boxes of my favorite cigars.  It's great to be in company of
those who enjoy the same things in life as myself.

[ Great to have you, too, Michael! Nice to see that cigars are not the
exclusive province of us Old Fartz of 37. -S. ]

<a name="3">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #138 - April 8, 1994</a>

Hello to all:

As a former tobaccinist, I could not pass up the chance to give my 
opinions on some of the questions raised in last issue.

Beginners pipe -  First, plan on buying two pipes and rotating them.  Go 
to any reputable tobacco shop and ask for seconds.  These pipes are 
quality briar made in exactly the same way as the more expensive firsts 
made by the same company.  During the final carving and sanding of a 
pipe, small bits of stone or voids in the briar are often exposed.  The 
solution is to fill the void with putty, and sell the pipe for a lesser 
price.  These "fills" have no effect on the smokability of a pipe.

Do not pay the money for expensive pipes until you are sure that you are 
going to like pipe smoking.  Use one pipe one day, and another the next.  
Buy small amounts of two or three tobaccos, a light aromatic, a 
cavendish, and an English, and see which does it for you.  Anything which 
includes "BCA", which is a fire cured cavendish, is a good choice for the 
aromatic.

Bite -  Many things contribute to tongue bite.  Here are a few general 
rules and suggestions.

1.  The more wood in a pipe, the cooler it will smoke.
2.  The more surface area, the cooler the pipe will smoke.  That means a 
rough finish pipe will smoke cooler than a smooth pipe of the same size 
and shape.
3.  The greater the wall thickness of the bowl, the cooler the smoke.
4.  The weight of the pipe is also a factor in heat dissipation.  Look 
for a pipe that is light for its size.
5.  The distance from the bowl to the pipe is also a major factor.  Also, 
the length of shank vs. stem.  A lumberman shape is a very cool smoke 
because of this.
6.  The pipe must not have any varnish or the heat will be held in.  This 
should not be a problem in a good tobacco shop.

7.  The slower the tobacco burns, the cooler the smoke.  Factors 
affecting this are cut (size of each piece), moisture content and 
additives.  This is always a tradeoff of cool vs. staying lit. Even in a 
good pipe, correctly packed, you can get bite from a tobacco that is 
"bone dry" and/or contains chemicals to keep it lit (salt peeter and 
glycerine usually).  This also should not be a problem if you choose a 
reputable tobacco shop.

8.  Puffing - If you are a fast puffer, select a large cut and keep it 
moist.  If you are a slow puffer, go to a smaller cut and keep it less 
moist.  Large cuts include cavendish, cube and plug.  Examples of smaller 
cuts are flake, ribbon and crimp.

9.  Packing - Probably the most difficult smoking art to master.  Here is 
the method I used to instruct new smokers:
a)  Fill the pipe to the brim loosely.  Pack evenly til the bowl is only 
half-full.
b)  Fill the pipe again loosely.  Pack evenly til the bowl is 3/4 full.  
It will take more pressure this time.
c)  Over-fill the bowl loosely.  Pack evenly til the tobacco is level 
with the top.  This will take much more pressure.

10.  Lighting -  Use a butane lighter or a wooden match.  Anything else 
you will taste.  (For the true romantic, you can use an ember from the 
fireplace.) Light the entire surface drawing deeply.  Tamp the tobacco 
gently then relite.  Make sure the entire surface is evenly lit.

11.  Other considerations - Here are some other tips

a)  Smoking outside in the wind, or while driving with an open window 
will cause the pipe to burn faster.

b)  Breaking in (building a carbon cake to the thickness of a dime) will 
make even a terrible pipe smokable.  Do not let the cake get much thicker 
than this or it may split your bowl.  The new smoker wont need to worry 
about a reamer for a couple of months.

c) Placing a pipe cleaner in the pipe while packing will tend to prevent 
tobacco from clogging the draft hole.

d) Never use a pipe with a metal filter.  The metal stays at a different 
temperature, and causes condensation, which results in a wet (gurgling) pipe.

e) Opinion -  Any filter (even a water pipe) means that you are drawing 
through stale smoke from the second puff on.

f) Materials - Good pipe materials are briar, meerschaum, corn cob, 
cherry, ceramic and clay.

Start with a briar.  Corn cob is great if you like the taste of burning 
corn cob (I do), but must be considered a disposable pipe and tends to be 
a hot smoke.  Cherrywood is marginally acceptable, although they are 
heavy for their size and tend to split easily. Ceramic burn hot and are 
fragile, but do "color" rapidly as you smoke them.  Clay is like ceramic 
but more so.  If you are going to try one, get one with a long stem and 
treat it gently.

g)  Before you by a pipe, insert a pipe cleaner and see where the draft 
hole is in relationship to the bottom of the bowl.  It should come in 
exactly at the bottom.  If it is too high, you will end up with an uneven 
cake and a soggy pipe.  If it is too low, the pipe might "burn out".

h)  If you tend to be a wet smoker, a mixture containing Latakia will 
tend to dry out your mouth and prevent this problem. 

If anyone is still reading this horribly long message, I would welcome 
comments.

&gt; I've proposed a new newsgroup, "alt.smokers.pipes,"
&gt; and will create it on April 15 unless someone manages to talk me out
&gt; of doing so. Ah, the beauty of the alt. hierarchy... light up as we
&gt; contemplate...

Going through a regular proposal process (for alt) I hope?  I thought
it was a little presumptious of the alt.smokers.cigars guy to create a
group so soon.

What about rec.tobacco?  Is it going to be proposed again?

 His address would have been at .nih.gov, anyway, considering
that's where he got his captain's uniform (the National Institute
of Health being a part of the Navy.)  And nothing goes better
with foul weather gear than a pipe clamped between the teeth,
inverted in particularly bad weather -- just ask the Groton's
of Gloucester fisherman.

&gt; What about the concept, is that filter thing unique?

 I've heard of this.  I can't remember where.  I have a slim
paperback on pipe smoking (The Art of...?) and maybe this book
spoke disparagingly of this method (but whichever source didn't
like standard filters either, for weakening the taste.  All
that it approved were the metal condensing devices, and that
begrudgingly, if I remember correctly.)

[ Well, Rex's group seems to have been pretty successful, so far. And,
yes, I have gone through the regular process. So far, discussion ==

<a name="7">Subject: Latakia vs scented tobacco</a>

I've found an excellent compromise tobacco.  It combines the flavor of a 
light latakia blend with the aromatic qualities of a cavendish pressed 
with vanilla extract.  It comes from my local pipe shop; however, I 
understand that thye purchase it from Lanes, which is a supplier for 
most independent pipe shops.  The Lanes designation for the tobacco is 
"HGL" (for "Herman G. Lane").  I highly recommend it.

<a name="8">Subject: What brings me to the Internet Pipes Mailgroup</a>

Hello new friends at pipes!

I'm a relatively new addition to the world of pipes.  I bought a $12 pipe 
at a pharmacy late this past summer, and have been smoking standard 
Captain Black Gold and Half and Half quite regularly.

While I will probably never attain the level of knowledge that many of 
you have on the various fine tobaccos, pipes, pipe history, and the like, 
I am interested in delving deeper into the world of pipes.  

I found out about the pipes list when I saw Steve's request to create 
alt.smokers.pipe on alt.config, and decided to come aboard as a new pipe 
smoker and enjoyer.

One big reason I am interested in smoking the pipe more heavily, getting 
fancier and tasty tobaccos and a nicer pipe (with a filter!), is that I 
am finding myself smoking cigarettes more and more.  I used to be a 
social smoker of cigarettes, only smoking occasionally.  But then, about 
a month ago, something "clicked" and I've been smoking like mad.  I only 
smoke the super-low tar menthols like NOW, but I still would rather stick 
with something safer, tastier and better smelling than cigarettes.

MINI AUTOBIOGRAPHY:
-------------U/~--
I am 22 years old (january 28, 1972), living and breathing in New 
Jersey.  I am a pianist, and I perform my 'spontaneous compositions' in 
local area churches.  We'll be making a 90-minute tape this Thursday, 
which will hopefully sell well (it will be my first tape).

I am the listowner of ????????@?????.?????? - discussion on the rights of 
kids and teens.  On a more specific and quite different shade of the 
children's/teen's rights issues, I am the creator of alt.sex.intergen, 
which is for the discussion of intergenerational relationships of all 
kinds (any relationship between either: two people of significantly 
different ages, such as 52 and 34, or between an adult and someone under 
the age of 18 which, in cases like the two ages being 21 and 16, has the 
same kinds of problems a relationship between a 52 and a 34 year old 
would have, outside of the added legal implications.

I own a 286/16 with hercules monitor, which is what I'm using right now 
to dialin to mordor.com, as well as my BBS, "Free Speech" 908.241-0537, 
which always welcomes people from across the globe to say, "Hello" (it 
takes all of 2 minutes to call, read some stuff other people wrote, 
write a "Hello" type message, and leave.  It's completely anonymous).

I guess that covers the range pretty well.  I've noticed that some of my 
teenage friends (male) are quite fastinated by my pipe, and enjoy 
"passing the pipe around", and the nice smell of the smoke-filled room.
Most of them HATE cigarettes, but somehow put my little drug-store $12 
pipe with Captain Black Gold in it on a higher level.

          Thanks for adding me to your distribution list.  I'm looking 
          forward to reading the new issues.  I did have one question now, 
          though, and that is, is the text of the Digest formatted in 
          anyway for text readers?  I don't know if you're familiar with 
          the "setext" format, but there's a text viewer out there called 
          EasyView that formats digests like yours into nice little 
          packets.  All those U/~ symbols made me wonder if yours was 
          similarly formatted.  (At least, I see a lot of U/~ symbols.  Am 
          I supposed to???)
          
          Next, I've come across a section in America Online devoted to 
          pipes and cigars.  You'll find it at The Exchange/Hobbies &amp; 
          Outdoors Message Center/Hobbies Board/Pipes &amp; Cigars.  It's where 
          I find out about you, as a matter of fact.  The moderator is 
          starting up a chat room, too, for interested people.

Hello, Steve. Glad to be on board. I ran off revision 1.6:4Mar94 and looked
closely at the list of sellers, and missing from this list is Faders of
Baltimore, MD. I go to his shop in Annapolis Mall, Annapolis, MD which has a
good feeling once you enter the store. Faders has a tobacco called "Barrister,"
which I have been smoking for several years now. There is enough latakia in it
to make it interesting and a good smoke. I saw that some of the other members
of the group have spoken about their pipes. I am now 69 and have smoked pipes
since I was 17, and also cigars. I have a number of pipes in my collection
which I have owned for many years. For instance, I have a Comoy Blue Riband pot
which I bought in St. Louis in 1954 for $17.50. I think that if you can get a
Blue Riband today, it would be quite a bit more. In '85, my wife and I went
through Scandinavia, and I went absolutely ape in W.O. Larson's and the Pip
Dend in Copenhagen. I now have as many pipes as I need and can reasonably
smoke, but a pipe collector is a pipe collector. Anyway, I am glad to be
associated with a group of individuals who enjoy a good pipeload and a good
cigar. Gen Frank ???.?????@???.???

<a name="11">Subject: Pipes FAQ request</a>

Well thanks to the pipes digest I was able to locate one of those really neat
little "pocket" pipes that fold over themselves.  I managed to get ahold of
it at the Richmond Pipe and Tobacco in Washington DC.  I also managed to pick
up a pipe by the brand name "Irish Seconds" (3/4 bent Billiard - blond wood -
I got it on St. Patrick's Day too which seemed appropriate somehow).  I was
wondering if someone knew what this brand was.  Someone told me that these
are the slightly imperfect Peterson pipes.  There are a few problems with the
grain of the wood, but it is onothing that will cause any problem (I think)
so it seems really pretty perfect to me.  Can anyone tell me if this is a
Peterson cast off, or is it another brand altogether?
     Another concern of mine is the proper way to break in a new pipe. A
friend filled his new Savinelli full the first time he smoked it.  He said it
got INCREDIBLY hot to the touch, and part of the finih on the outside of the
pipe "bubbled" and craxked.  I received a Charatan pipe as a gift and I am
afraid to smoke it for fear of ruining the finish on it, and I need to know
how to break it in if it in fact needs to be broken in.  Any suggestions? 
Thanks.

[ WOW! Basically, I'd say s l o w   d o w n. The object is to keep the
pipe at the just-going-out stage, so it doesn't get hot enough to do
such nasty things! -S. ]

Just an introduction. I'm a middle-aged graduate student in New York, and 
have been smoking pipes off and on since about 1967. I took it up in earnest 
again in the mid-1980s and have since been spending a significant amount of 
my rather meager income over the years on pretty good pipes. My preference 
has evolved definitely towards deep defined blasts, and I now am definitely 
a sandblast collecter. I recently wrote a piece, out of frustration, called 
"In Defense of Sandblasts" for a recent PCI newsletter. Recently I've been 
tending toward tanshells, which are becoming a bit hard to find. I have 
about 70 pipes: Radicis, Ser Jacopos, Castellos, Capitellos, Charatans, 
Dunhills, Ashtons, Il Ceppos, Cooke, and some Bessai (a Cleveland shop). 
Recently bought my first Barling (pre-transition Canadian--a beautiful 
blast).

Since 3 Nuns was bought out and degraded (similarly with Rattrays), I've 
been smoking Butera's Virginia blend, which I get directly from him. No 
sooner did I discover Esoterica Tobacciana than they became inaccessible. 
The casualty rate among good tobaccos has been incredibly high.

Re the antismoking people, I've noticed that they never talk about pipes, 
only about cigarettes. However, what they most damn is the intrinsic 
malevolence of tobacco itself. At the heart of the argument is the 
passive smoking issue--one can't just say "Well, I'm free to poison myself 
if I want to and none of your damn business", because the argument is that 
we are poisoning everyone else too. How valid is the passive smoking 
argument re tobacco (we can disregard the additions of noxious non-tobacco 
substances--or can we?)? Is there a doctor in the house?

S. Slottow 

[ Read the front pages of any Cigar Aficionado for some appreciation
of how hard cigar smokers can be bashed. It's not just cigarettes.
And, re passive smoking, I'm of the opinion that classifying tobacco
smoke as a Class A carcinogen (up there with asbesdos and plutonium)
on the basis of a risk factor of 1.3 (down there with drinking whole
milk and keeping pet birds), makes about as much sense as classifying
ketchup as a vegetable. (But then, I'm no M.D., just a Ph.D. I just
wish I made as much. :-) -S. ]

Well, we are now _solidly_ over the 300 mark. A lot of new membership
last week! I am also pleased to report that alt.smokers.pipes was
successfully created, and with the exception of one, ah, individual,
has been mostly flamage-free. Catch it if you can!

On the yucky side, this week also marks the first attempt to hose the
Digest. It wasn't a great attempt (certainly not in the league of the
Green Card Shyster Bandits :-) and may even be in the category of a
prank, but it did happen. This is why I keep the membership list
confidential. Details on request.

And, it seems, that now we're in kind of a Who's the Youngest on the
Digest contest... so far, the winner is 18. Any contenders for the
spot?

In any case, the congressional bashing has ceased for the moment, and
spring is in the air. And so, I hope, is the scent of a fine cigar or
a bowl of your favorite vernal terbakky! Enjoy, in moderation of
course, but first:

Hey there. In the last mailing, someone called me "presumptious" for 
allegedly creating alt.smokers.cigars too quickly, or something like 
that. Just for the record, I went through all the discussion process on 
the newsgroups where news administrators bash each other and anyone who 
wants to do something new. It was through that process that my creation 
wound up being called alt.smokers.cigars. If the objection is that I'd 
only been on the Net for 6 weeks before creating alt.smokers.cigars, I 
can only say that I saw a gap and moved to fill it. The success of the 
group suggests the gap I perceived was real. So there. :-) Rex

<a name="4">Subject: inquiries</a>

	First of all, Steve, I must announce that I am 18 years of age 
(lately I've been seeing many people announcing their ages in the 
digest), I must be the youngest pipe smoker.  

	Anyway, today's question(s) are concerning my Peterson.
Petersons are the very best, I belive.  However, I do not like the
Peterson steck bit (hole aimed at roof of mouth).  I find them (at
least on my 3/4 bent Peterson) difficult to draw on and the roof of my
mouth ends up blasted.  Also, since the tongue is where sense of taste
is, I would rather have the smoke hitting there.  Do you know if they
make regular wedge bits as alternitives?  If so, how can I order one?

	The second question concerning my Peterson is about the bowl.
It is short and squat, and has a problem with burning--I think the
tobacco only burns in the center.  I know this is probably because the
bowl is too wide--or is it because of something I'm doing wrong?  If I
puff harder and faster it probably will burn completely, but I
(knowing the fundementals) know that to truely enjoy the smoke one
must puff lightly and slowly.  So what am I to do, Steve?  I don't
want to waste tobacco in this half-burning bowl.
			
				HELP. 
Daniel Sauder ~\U

[ Even if Peterson doesn't make a wedge bit, perhaps somebody could
retrofit one for you. Re the center-only ignition, try moving the
match in a circle around the edge of the bowl for a charring light,
then tamp and relight. -S. ]

<a name="7">Subject: Re: Pipes Mailing List</a>

	Well, this will be my first submission to the list, as I just
subscribed and read through all of your tips and comments about smoking pipes
and tobaccos.  Seems like they will be helpful.  First a little bit about me;
I'm currently enrolled at Virginia Tech in the Computer Science department as
an undergraduate (yep, -under-graduate :-).  I haven't been smoking pipes but
for 5-6 months now, and prior to that I was an avid non-smoker.  I started out
with a pipe from a local tobacco shop (not the greatest of tobaccos, but
acceptable for a small southwestern Virginia town).  It's a plain briar with no
fills, but a coupple of cracks in the bowl (maybe I've been smoking it too
hot?).  I grew up with my father a heavy pipe smoker, and always liked the
aroma.  I had always wondered if it tasted as good as it smelled, and I figured
I would try it.  It may seem funny to be smoking a pipe at the age of 19, but
hey, I actually do enjoy it.  I was at first dismayed to find out how little
the pipe tasted like how it smelled.  But I decided I had made an investment
and I would continue with the hobby.  I've grown to like the taste a lot, and
the smell that hangs around a couple hours after I'm done.  My favorite
tobaccos are St.Bruno's Flake cut (in the square tin), and a blend called Billy
Budd which I found at the smoke shop in Annapolis; I'm gonna have to go have a
bowl of it after this message.  I really enjoy smoking a pipe, and have tried
smoking other things like cigars (of mediocre quality from what I am told), and
even some cigarettes.  While pipes don't give me  any "buzz" per se, I really
enjoy the effects it has on my mood.  Smoking a pipe puts me in a very
contemplative mood, and hey, it gets me away from the computer.  :-)  Enjoy
your pipes!

From: Bryan Embrey &lt;???????@????????.???.???&gt;
<a name="8">Subject: new alt group</a>

Steve,
Congratulations!  No flamage (except for purposes you mentioned) and seemingly 
rapid propagation.  It arrived at my site this afternoon and I promptly 
subscribed.  It seemed fitting, too, because I had just returned from a local 
emporium with 2oz of Cavendish that I'll try this evening.

In the last mailing (Thursday, April 14), someone mentioned pipe
seconds.  On a recent trip to Boston, I noticed what basically looked
like "unfinished" seconds; much like unfinished furniture.  Each had a
few surface flaws and were, for lack of a better term, unpolished.  I
already have too many pipes for the amount of tobacco I consume, so I
didn't purchase one for the $20 they were asking, but I am curious.
It seems possible that one could try out an oddly shaped pipe without
spending too much money.

Turning to cigars for a moment, I read my wife Gregory Pease's note
from #138 where he cooked dinner for his date and afterwards she
suggested they share a cigar.  My wife became intrigued and subtly
suggested that I cook us a nice dinner during the week.  I agreed and
later that week prepared a nice, though not overly complex, pasta
dish.  Afterwards, she mentioned that I hadn't had a cigar in quite
some time.  When I brought out an Avo Pyramide, I was surprised that
she wanted to share; in fact, after she had had several puffs, she
didn't want to share much at all.  In the end, we spent a very
enjoyable evening amid her fragrant cigar smoke and some good wine.  A
night to remember.

Again, congrats on the newsgroup.
Bryan Embrey

up a whole new vista of spousal tobak tolerance... -S. ]

[ Short note from Yours Truly to George deleted for space. -S. ]

Steve,

Thanks.  I look forward to it.  I don't see any attached intro guide, 
though.  I hope the different email address I gave you didn't cause any 
confusion.  I use this account (??????@?????.???.???.???) for most of the 
internet access, but I use a different account 
(??????@??????.???.???.???) for most of my email and I would prefer for 
the pipes mail to go to that (uncmvs) address.  Basically, this gibbs 
account is very limited in capacity and tends to max out with mailing 
list traffic.

If that's a problem however, the gibbs account will work.  I don't see any
intro on either account yet.  Perhaps it just hasn't worked its way
through the system. 

I am looking forward to it, though.  Coincidentally, I just broke the 
stem on a favorite pipe yesterday and was wondering where to get it 
repaired.  As pipe smoking has become less common, the good tobacco shops 
in my part of the world have closed down and I miss the sort of services 
they used to provide, like pipe repair.

Regards,
George

[ Again, George, there are a couple of good stem-repair places in the

I guess I should introduce myself.  My name is Avik Roy, and I am a 21 year
old medical student at Yale University.  Many of my friends here at Yale 
are pipe smokers, and we have plenty of occasions at which to smoke.  
Judging from what I've read, we have it much better than most.

Here are two notable tobacconists which were not on your list:

David P. Erlich Company

(An outstanding collection of pipes, cigars, tobacco, and other gentlemen's 
products.)

[ Glad to hear that pipe-smoking academia is not dead in the Ivy
League, Avik! I visited Erlich's once, and agree that it's a must-do
if you're in Boston. -S. ]

From: "Mark D. Lamoree" &lt;???????@?????.??.???.???&gt;
<a name="13">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest</a>

	Here is a brief autobiography:
	I am a nineteen year old political science major at Loyola 
University, Chicago.  This no doubt makes me the youngest member of this 
group.  I have been smoking pipes for a little over a 
year, since I was introduced to pipe smoking by my roomate.(Although I was 
pre-disposed to the habit, having grown up with a pipe smoking father.)  
I must point put, however, that my loyalties are split.  Although I enjoy 
a good pipe, I also smoke cigars as regularly as I can afford.
	Regarding the second-hand smoke issue, you should be aware of the 
history of the report which sparked this whole controversy.  That report 
was quashed several times because the science its conclusions were based 
on was so poor.  Because of political pressure, the report was finally 
released in an essentially unchanged form.  Thus, the entire controversy

Sorry Steve, I was just displaying a gross ignorance of American 
geography.  I thought your header referred to the province New Brunswick 
(of which Fredericton is the capital).

Anyways, I just found the most glorious smoke shop I have ever seen.  
Pass it  along on the pipes newsletter if you wish.  It is called 
Clarke's Tobacconnists (sp?) in Gastown in Vancouver (at #3 Alexander 
Street).  It is well worth the trip.  A tad expensive but worth it.  eg. 
H. Uppman coronas were $9.50 plus tax (isn't Canada wonderful?).

for adding me to the list. I got to download the mail you dropped and found
it to be very interesting.

I've tried a pipe a few times and just never did get the hang of it. I guess
you'd have to classify me as a die-hard cigar smoker. My first cigar (at age
12) was a Tiparillo (yuk!!) and now i'm devoted to the pursuit of the cubans.
A friend brought back a box of Cohiba's from London and made me a
fan---quickly. My regular smoke is a Dannemann Espada. I know, it's dry-cured
and causes the true cigar lover to turn up his/her nose. But that's why there
are horse races too.

I saw a message from someone asking about the "Cigar Dinners".
For the last 2 years I've been a member of the Chicago Cigar Connisseurs ( I
live in KC ) and attend their annual dinner. The only thing I can say is,
it's a shame there are not more dinners like that one. REALLY great time.
I've met some interesting people too. I'd like to attend one of the dinners
at the Ritz-Carlton someday too.

Thanks again. Tim

Thank you for adding me to the distribution list.  For a starter, let me
introduce myself.  My name is Toshihiko Murata.  I'm a graduate student at
University of Oregon, studying sociology.  I'm originally from Japan,
where it is almost impossible to get fine tobacco.  So coming to U.S. and
having a tobacconist near by is almost like a dream come true.  My
preferred tobacco that I can get from local tobacco store are No.25
Virginia from McClelland tobacco company, and Craven mixture.  I don't get
to smoke Craven mixture very often because my partner doesn't like the
"camp fire smell" of craven mixture.   Thank you again.

If Porsche-designed pipes are those weird blue or green metal space ship 
pipes, then John's Pipe Shop in Champaign, Illinois has some. I don't know 
their number, but get it from information and ask for Patrick (he's a state 
cop, and his mother works there during the day).

Re passive smoking: it seems the core of the antismoking argument. If the 
report (is there only one?) on which the argument is based on has been exposed 
as "bad science" then we need more information than simply that bald 
assertion. I would be most appreciative if someone would give a more full 
report than these one or two sentence mentions about the report, what "bad 
science" means in this instance, just what passive smoking is supposed to do 
to people, how its supposed to work, etc. It's no good urging people to 
write in protest without giving them solid information and arguments.

To change the subject--I'm almost out of my last can of Butera's Virginia 
blend. I'm going to reorder, but: have any Virginia-blend smokers tried his 
other two blends? Do you like them? I know their English, and I smoke 
Virginia, but the reviews have been so good...

&gt;        Steve:  I am looking for a Porsche designed pipe.  Several years ago
&gt;        I saw one at a local Tinderbox but that store no longer exists.
&gt;        Does anyone out there know anything about these pipes and where I
&gt;        can find a new or pre-smoked one?

	Ah, this was quite the suave unit, designed by "Butzi" Porsche
(designer of the original 904 and 911 models).  Altho' hard to tell,
it *was* made of briar (charred black), and the bowl was enshrouded
in a finned aluminum "cooling tower", looking much like the air-cooled
cylinders of a 911's engine.  The whole shape was smoothly contoured
to look like a wisp of smoke itself.  Damn expensive, too.  If it's
still made, you should be able to get it from any U.S. purveyor of
Porsche Design merchandise; look in some car magazines or upscale
magazines (like "Robb Report") for Porsche Design adverts.

&gt;Subject: American Spirit loose tobacco
	Actually, it's a coarse shag-cut meant for rolling cigarets,
methinks (the pouch comes with papers).  I did try packing my pipe
with it once; while austerely tasty, the nic buzz pinned me to my
chair for a good fifteen minutes afterward, such that I could hardly
even empty the spent bowl into the ashtray next to me!  It goes down
*much* better in a cigaret. %-}  Very clean, leafy flavour.

	Steve, if you would be so kind as to send me the lastest
updates of the resource guide, how-to, and whatever other side-orders
you have... danke schoen!

&gt;[...]
&gt;Turning to cigars for a moment, I read my wife Gregory Pease's note
&gt;from #138 where he cooked dinner for his date and afterwards she
&gt;suggested they share a cigar.  My wife became intrigued and subtly
&gt;suggested that I cook us a nice dinner during the week.  I agreed and
&gt;later that week prepared a nice, though not overly complex, pasta
&gt;dish.  Afterwards, she mentioned that I hadn't had a cigar in quite
&gt;some time.  When I brought out an Avo Pyramide, I was surprised that
&gt;she wanted to share; in fact, after she had had several puffs, she
&gt;didn't want to share much at all.  In the end, we spent a very
&gt;enjoyable evening amid her fragrant cigar smoke and some good wine.  A
&gt;night to remember.

I can't tell you how pleased I am to have inspired Bryan (or his 
wife! ;) and anyone else who may have indulged themselves and their
mates to this most intimate of pleasures.  And a quick thanks to 
everyone who suggested I not let this woman "get away!"  All is
well, I'm happy to say!  (Hell, we've known each other for nearly
four years, though the romance part is still young.  I don't think 
she's going anywhere anytime soon.  We are having a bit of a chat
over whether we want two or three children, if that's any indication!)

And onward...

Last Tuesday I enjoyed my 36th birthday.  During a moment of reflection
over a bowl of Balkan Sobranie from the mid 1960's (in a 1918 Dunhill
Shell "O"...ahh!) I recounted the early days of my relationship to the
briar.  While still an impressionable young thing in middle school,
I had a teacher of sciences who smoked a pipe.  I admired this man,
and tried to emulate everything about him, thinking it would bring
me similar admiration.  I adopted his disheveled appearance, his 
propensity for careful speech, his consideration for the art and 
responsibility of science, and his constant companion, the pipe.  I
was 15 at the time.  

Once I had my first automobile (a 1960 Austin Healy Sprite in British
Racing Green), I abandoned the lab coat and pocket protector for a leather 
jacket, tweed cap and white scarf (still impressionable, after all).  
I suspect I still looked quite the fool, though, I'd like to think, in 
a much more rogueish fashion.  I didn't, however, abandon the pipe.  It's 
not that I really enjoyed the bloody thing, but it had become an integral
part of my costume!  In fact, it tasted dreadful!  (I still have that
pipe, and it still tastes dreadful!)

Once I entered University, I chanced upon the tobacconist from which
my mother had procured my uncle's cigars when I was a wee lad.  The
smell brought back many memories, so I struck up a conversation with
the proprietor.  Once he discovered what sort of pipe I was smoking
(the horror) and what sort of tobacco I dared to fill it with (great
horror of all horrors!) he took me under his wing, convinced that I 
could be cured.  He guided me to a Charatan second, a sandblast 
yachtsman for which I paid about $18, and a tin of a rich, full blend
of Oriental and Virginia tobaccos, with more than a hint of Latakia
for good measure.  I found the roadmap to the sublime on that day.  I
went to work for fellow, restoring pipes, blending tobacco and learning
everything I could from him.  I was able to acquire the beginning
of my collection, and develop an almost spiritual, and quite alchemical 
relationship to fine briars and tobaccos.  

Sadly, this sort of story is becoming an all but dead artifact of a 
more gentle era.  I was working a couple of years ago at Drucquer and 
Sons, developing a new blend or two, when a woman came back to see what 
I was so obviously happy about.

I was up to my elbows in fragrant Latakia and Virginias, and obviously
experiencing the sort of bliss which causes some to play with snakes
and speak in tongues.  She looked into my eyes and asked if I really
liked doing this.  I tried to tell her of the feeling of connection
it gave me to the land and the skies, of the sensory pleasures of
smelling and touching and tasting the beautifully aged leaf, of the
palette of colours from golden yellow to rich brown and shiny black.
I told her of the delight in filling a bowl with the concoction I 
had created and setting it alight, to fill mouth and air with delicate
smoke, to warm the hand on a cool winter's night, to find solace and
companionship even when no one else heed the call.  She shook her
head and walked away, waving the anti-smoker's salute in front of her
sensorally maladjusted proboscis.  

The war against tobacco is not new.  In 1604, King James I published
the famous "Counterblaste to Tobacco," and banned the cultivation and
use of tobacco in England.   Neither has this war ever been won, and 
all prohibitions have ultimately been overturned through popular
pressures.  We are part of the populace, and as such, must stand up
and be counted.

We are a coterie who must continue our tradition, and celebrate the 
hobby and romance of the weed.  We can never convert the malevolent 
soothsayers of doom to the understanding that ours is not a dastardly 
plot to create havok in their brachea, but a reflection and appreciation 
of the things that life brings us.  If we keep in mind the joy of our
little celebrations, perhaps we can each change a little piece of the 
world.

Smoke in peace,
Gregory

[ And speaking of wars against tobacco, didn't the king of Germany
once try to outlaw it ... and fail badly? -S. ]

letter at a time)?  not only do i enjoy reading and answering in that 
format, but for some reason my reader chokes when i try to reply to an 
included letter.

ok, on to the personal stuff.
my name is doug nelson (???????@??????.????????.???)
i am 34 years old and an undergraduate at university of missouri-columbia.  
i would normally make a big deal out of how old i was to be an undergrad, or 
how young i was when i started pipe smoking (16), but i see both of these 
areas have been paved.

i own about 15 pipes, with no real pattern, but i guess petersen's are in 
the majority.  i prefer bents, the bigger the better.  currently i am down 
to 3 pipes, with the rest being held for ransom until a divorce is finalized.

i stopped smoking cold turkey when the report on second hand smoke came out. 
 i figured it was a pleasant hobby, but not work endangering other people's 
lives.  after about 5 or so years i find myself living alone (see previous 
paragraph) and have picked it back up again.

i would like to reply to some of the letters in the intro, but as i said, my 
reader choked.  someone mentioned the disadvantages of a petersen bit.  i 
find my palate a little raw myself sometimes, but overall i really enjoy the 
bit.  i like biting down, and its the only one i've found that could take 
it.  (most of my pipes are on their second or even third bit, except for the 
petersens.  well, except for one petersen &lt;G&gt;)

my favorite tobacco is a lane blend that goes by different names depending 
on which shop you go to.  it usually has 'bl' or 'burley light' somewhere in 
the name.  it is a very light aromatic that somehow manages to keep a full 
body.  i can smoke it virtually non-stop with no unpleasant side effects.  
should someone accidentally get a whiff of it (as i said, i try to avoid 
smoking around others) the response is invariably favorable.  btw, if anyone 
has a mail order source for this blend, please let me know.  i've tried many 
catalogs (though by no means everyone listed in the intro) with no success.  
this is a small town, hours away from a larger one, and has only one tobacco 
shop, which is growing smaller and increasingly unreliable.

someone mentioned their pipe keeping them away from the keyboard.  between 
the petersen bit and the light tobacco, i don't have this excuse.  &lt;breaks 
to relight&gt;  actually, i've never had the opportunity to compare pipe 
smoking habits with anyone else (see first paragraph).  i find i smoke about 
a pound of tobacco a month.  how does this stack up with the other readers?

i will break it off here, otherwise no one will even bother reading, let 
alone responding.  i look forward to receiving the digest, and perhaps 
corresponding with others.

I hope this is the right address.  I'm a long time pipe smoker, who once 
worked in a pipe shop when younger.  I enjoy the English tobaccos, and
tend to add a bit of extra perique and Latakia, and if in the mood, a
bit of very strong slice.

Also, I am selling off part of my pipe collection, some of which are very
high quality.  I'll send a list to anyone who asks (I left it off to save
bandwidth).  I'm not purely selling it, I'll consider trades for Mac soft-
ware or hardware (noted on the list).

He is currently writing a second article for the may issue of the

Hi Steve,
	Just wanted to comment on the quality of some of the seconds o
out there. I have always used the same Irish Second with a very light
finish. It has only one slight imperfection and smokes very cool and smooth.
Just wanted to let anyone know that if they're looking for a good pipe 
for under $50, they shouldn't dismiss a good second just by word of mouth
(it seems some people hate them). Also had a question....how does a good
Meershaum (sp?) smoke compared to a briar? I looked into this before I 
bought my briar but have since forgotten. 

Thanks!

<a name="15">Subject: The book I Read</a>

Just thought I would write to mention a book I thought all of you may be
interested in.  It is called "Smoking and Society:  Toward a More Balanced
Assessment" Robert Tollison, ed.  (Lexington Books  1986.  ISBN
0-669-11603-3)  The book is a series of essays written by various people in
relation to smoking and the social ramifications related to it.  Hans Eysenck
(the famous psychologist, which really impressed me since I am a psychology
major) presents the first essay about smoking and health, concluding that the
grounds the AMA and other medical establishments have made on the basis of
smoking and disease are not as strong as they would have you believe.  Other
essays focus on the Health Issues and Passive Smoking, The Social Role of
Smoking, Smoking, Human Rights, and Civil Liberties, The Incidence of Taxes
on Tobacco, and A Sociological View of the Antismoking Phenomenon.  The book
itself is not "light" reading by any stretch, but in consideration of the
activites taken against smokers in modern society it might prove to be useful
for counterattacks.  I happened to find a copy ofthis book for only 5
dollars, and if anyone would be interested in getting a copy, let me know and
I would be happy to try and get a copy for you at the store I obtained it
from.  I would send it cost + shipping, which would put it around 10 dollars
or so (which is sill less than the cover price of any hard bound books
today).  Just thought you might be interested.
     I was wondering if anyone knew of a good cleaner for the outside of
pipes.  The rim of some of mine have become stained through smoking, and I
would like to clean that off if it is possible without ruining the finish or
the pipe.  Any suggestions?
      Also, does anyone know a good place to obtain a calabash pipe?  I can't
seem to find them in any of the stores around here.  I thought it would make
an interesting addition to the collection I have currently.

sale, but not where I saw them... any info, readers? -S. ]

<a name="3">Subject: RE: Pipes Digest #141 - April 29, 1994</a>

I enjoyed Gregory's post, pointing out the positive aesthetics of pipe 
smoking. Today I was listening to the radio: first there was an interview 
with an antiabortion activist, who kept saying to the abortion doctor who 
was also being interviewed "I hope you stop this grisly practice to which 
you have devoted your life" and kept interrupting, saying "abortion is 
murder." Then there was an interview with the lawyer representing the couple
who recently bought into a condominium and are suing the people underneath 
them for smoking--evidently the deadly fumes are permeating their apartment. 
A caller started berating the lawyer for his wishy-washy attitude towards 
stamping out tobacco (the caller was evidentally allergic to tobacco fumes), 
and stated that smokers have no right to smoke in their own apartments 
unless they belonged to an exclusive smokers-only apartment house. He
stated that all smokers should be evicted from their apartments (on that 
ground alone) and that within a decade compulsory housing segregation 
for smokers will be realized.

This man's tone of aggressive outrage was very similar to the abortion 
advocate's tone. I am not advocating abortion (or not advocating it, for 
that matter), but pointing to the similarity in goals and styles. If this 
man was allergic to pollen, or dust, or industrial fumes, or anything else, 
he would never attack it with the same ferocity and self-righteousness. He 
reminded me of someone advocating the extermination of a depraved and 
hopelessly evil race--very much like the Nazi attitude towards Jews. I 
don't think I'm exaggerating at all.

Thanks for the member who posted the book information. I will get in touch 
with him--I'd like to have some hard information.

Re meerschaums v. briar. A while ago, thinking I really should try a 
meerschaum, I bought I very nice uncarved slightly bent billiard shape. After 
4 or 5 smokes, I picked up a briar again, and then smoked another briar... 
it's still languishing in my desk drawer. I just can't get interested. I 
guess that what I really like about pipes is the grain and the blast (and 
the flavor, of course). Meerschaums don't have any grain, and the mild 
flavor lacks the distinctive and stronger character of briar, to my mind. Or 
maybe it all comes down to habit. I also like the durability of briar, the 
sense that I can just put it in my jacket pocket and go out for a walk.

Regarding the burn marks on the top of the bowl. I have gotten into the 
habit of wiping them off with a hankerchief before they dry--this ruins the 
hankerchief but has kept the top of my smooth bowls pretty clean and shiny. 
It won't work if the top of the bowl is blasted.

[ Stephen, thanks for your comments. Did you call the station and let
them know that persecution is _never_ right? If not, I'd encourage you
to do so next time. Unless we defend our rights, we're going to lose
them.

BTW, I'm glad I wasn't the only one to notice the similarity in
tactics between the antismokers and the antiabortionists. The issues
really are the same -- the right to control one's own body. -S. ]

I have been smoking cigars for about two and half years now, but as a result
of joining the pipes digest decided to try smoking a pipe.  I purchased an
inexpensive briar, with a straight shank.  I sampled several of my
tobacconists blends and found them most enjoyable.  My only problem is i
can't keep the darn thing lit for more than few minutes.  Also, how long do
you smoke a pipe?  I was told not to smoke the "moist dottle", how do I know
if I am infact smoking said "dottle".  Thanks in advance for any help.

<a name="6">Subject: My first time</a>

Well I finally broke down and purchased a pipe.  I had resisted the urge for 
this long because I couldn't afford to put out the $40-$50 for a pipe and 
$12-$15 for 50 g. of tobacco.  Yesterday my fast was broken.  I had some 
money in the bank and found a store who was willing to let me part with 
my capital reserves (kind of strange don't you think?).  I found a single 
dot Brigham for $27 and tried a black and brown cavendish mix to 
accompany it ($11.19 for 50g. sorry people my mind has been twisted from 
an early age -metric system- and I have difficulty speaking in standard 
measures).  I was even able to use some of the wealth of knowledge given 
out in a previous pipes digest by Chris (aka. ????@?????? I believe it 
was).  My profuse thanks your info. was very helpful and much appreciated.

I probably looked a little foolish trying to figure out the best way to 
hold the pipe when I returned home and tried to start it up but my 
Scottish ancestry forced me to  continue through the fumblings.  I see 
what you mean when you say there is an art to keeping a pipe lit (I went 
through an entire pack of matches).   I packed the top half to loosely and 
the  bottom to tight but after I was finished... one question for 
myself...what was I waiting for?  I sat outside (I am not allowed to 
smoke cigars and/or pipes inside - S.O's rule #225) for about an hour.  

Pure pleasure!

My S.O. checked on me several times to see if I had finished yet.  With 
each of her checks her warnings of impending headaches and upset stomach 
became more dire.  "I used to smoke and my first cigarette made me sick 
to my stomach", was one of her favorites.  I tried to explain that I 
wasn't inhaling the smoke and, therefore, wouldn't suffer the same 
effects as she did when she first started her habit (she has since 
quit).  She knew what she was talking about though so she wouldn't hear 
any of my apologetics.  Apart from the interruptions, I had one of the best 
hours I had ever had the pleasure of living through.  I even was able to 
tempt a friend out of the house to smell the smoke (his father smokes a 
pipe and cigars so he came out to relive some memories).  This of course 
promted remarks about "men" and "male bonding" but we weathered the assault.

I'll end off with a question.  I have smoked many cigars and if I had 
tried to go for an hour long session with one of them, I would be green.  
How is pipe tobacco different from cigar tobacco?

BTW I didn't even get a twinge in my belly from the cavendish.  In fact, 
I wanted to go back for more.  However, I was able to control my 
desires;  you know, too much of a good thing and all that rot.

Thank you one and all for the info.

P.S.  I recently purshased a Dominican "Wassle" the shopkeeper said it 
was similar to a robusto.  It may have been a bad box but I had not even 
got 3/4" off the cigar and I lost the wrapper.  It just came of in my 
hands.  Tastewise, the cigar was acceptable, nothing special but not 
bad.  It was light and cool, coffee-like.  Anyways, I suppose you get 
what you pay for ($3 for a cigar up North is cheap).  Be careful if you 
run across something similar.  Spend the extra dollar or two and get a Punch.

Essays by Mark Twain

CONCERNING TOBACCO

As concerns tobacco, there are many superstitions.  And the
chiefest is this--that there is a STANDARD governing the matter,
whereas there is nothing of the kind.  Each man's own preference
is the only standard for him, the only one which he can accept,
the only one which can command him.  A congress of all the
tobacco-lovers in the world could not elect a standard which
would be binding upon you or me, or would even much influence us.

The next superstition is that a man has a standard of his own.
He hasn't.  He thinks he has, but he hasn't.  He thinks he can
tell what he regards as a good cigar from what he regards as a
bad one--but he can't.  He goes by the brand, yet imagines he goes
by the flavor.  One may palm off the worst counterfeit upon him;
if it bears his brand he will smoke it contentedly and never suspect.

Children of twenty-five, who have seven years experience,
try to tell me what is a good cigar and what isn't.
Me, who never learned to smoke, but always smoked;
me, who came into the world asking for a light.

No one can tell me what is a good cigar--for me.  I am the
only judge.  People who claim to know say that I smoke the worst
cigars in the world.  They bring their own cigars when they come
to my house.  They betray an unmanly terror when I offer them
a cigar; they tell lies and hurry away to meet engagements
which they have not made when they are threatened with the
hospitalities of my box.  Now then, observe what superstition,
assisted by a man's reputation, can do.  I was to have twelve
personal friends to supper one night.  One of them was as
notorious for costly and elegant cigars as I was for cheap and
devilish ones.  I called at his house and when no one was looking
borrowed a double handful of his very choicest; cigars which cost
him forty cents apiece and bore red-and-gold labels in sign of
their nobility.  I removed the labels and put the cigars into a
box with my favorite brand on it--a brand which those people all
knew, and which cowed them as men are cowed by an epidemic.  They
took these cigars when offered at the end of the supper, and lit
them and sternly struggled with them--in dreary silence, for
hilarity died when the fell brand came into view and started
around--but their fortitude held for a short time only; then they
made excuses and filed out, treading on one another's heels with
indecent eagerness; and in the morning when I went out to observe
results the cigars lay all between the front door and the gate.
All except one--that one lay in the plate of the man from whom I
had cabbaged the lot.  One or two whiffs was all he could stand.
He told me afterward that some day I would get shot for giving
people that kind of cigars to smoke.

Am I certain of my own standard?  Perfectly; yes, absolutely
--unless somebody fools me by putting my brand on some other kind
of cigar; for no doubt I am like the rest, and know my cigar by
the brand instead of by the flavor.  However, my standard is a
pretty wide one and covers a good deal of territory.  To me,
almost any cigar is good that nobody else will smoke, and to me
almost all cigars are bad that other people consider good.
Nearly any cigar will do me, except a Havana.  People think they
hurt my feelings when then come to my house with their life
preservers on--I mean, with their own cigars in their pockets.
It is an error; I take care of myself in a similar way.  When I
go into danger--that is, into rich people's houses, where, in the
nature of things, they will have high-tariff cigars, red-and-gilt
girded and nested in a rosewood box along with a damp sponge,
cigars which develop a dismal black ash and burn down the side
and smell, and will grow hot to the fingers, and will go on
growing hotter and hotter, and go on smelling more and more
infamously and unendurably the deeper the fire tunnels down
inside below the thimbleful of honest tobacco that is in the
front end, the furnisher of it praising it all the time and
telling you how much the deadly thing cost--yes, when I go into
that sort of peril I carry my own defense along; I carry my own
brand--twenty-seven cents a barrel--and I live to see my family
again.  I may seem to light his red-gartered cigar, but that is
only for courtesy's sake; I smuggle it into my pocket for the
poor, of whom I know many, and light one of my own; and while he
praises it I join in, but when he says it cost forty-five cents I
say nothing, for I know better.

However, to say true, my tastes are so catholic that I have
never seen any cigars that I really could not smoke, except those
that cost a dollar apiece.  I have examined those and know that
they are made of dog-hair, and not good dog-hair at that.

I have a thoroughly satisfactory time in Europe, for all
over the Continent one finds cigars which not even the most
hardened newsboys in New York would smoke.  I brought cigars with
me, the last time; I will not do that any more.  In Italy, as in
France, the Government is the only cigar-peddler.  Italy has
three or four domestic brands:  the Minghetti, the Trabuco, the
Virginia, and a very coarse one which is a modification of the
Virginia.  The Minghettis are large and comely, and cost three
dollars and sixty cents a hundred; I can smoke a hundred in seven
days and enjoy every one of them.  The Trabucos suit me, too; I
don't remember the price.  But one has to learn to like the
Virginia, nobody is born friendly to it.  It looks like a rat-
tail file, but smokes better, some think.  It has a straw through
it; you pull this out, and it leaves a flue, otherwise there
would be no draught, not even as much as there is to a nail.
Some prefer a nail at first.  However, I like all the French,
Swiss, German, and Italian domestic cigars, and have never cared
to inquire what they are made of; and nobody would know, anyhow,
perhaps.  There is even a brand of European smoking-tobacco that
I like.  It is a brand used by the Italian peasants.  It is loose
and dry and black, and looks like tea-grounds.  When the fire is
applied it expands, and climbs up and towers above the pipe, and
presently tumbles off inside of one's vest.  The tobacco itself
is cheap, but it raises the insurance.  It is as I remarked in
the beginning--the taste for tobacco is a matter of superstition.
There are no standards--no real standards.  Each man's preference
is the only standard for him, the only one which he can accept,
the only one which can command him.

Well, it's not about the Pipes Digest exactly.  It has to do with
the anti-smoking initiatives.  I hope it's not too far off the
subject, but I've noticed a marked similarity in the arguments
both for and against smoking compared to the arguments concerning
gun control.  Does it make you suspect (as it does to me) that
the anti-smoking crowd has seen some success against the Bill of
Rights and thus concludes (correctly) that if the Constitution
can be assaulted, wouldn't the same tactics be effective against
smoking, which does not have near the same level of guarantee
as the right to keep and bear arms?

Now, I think that commercial American cigarettes stink, but I
still can't bring myself to support banning them because I don't
like them.  Hell, I don't like oysters either.  And they can
harm folks as well as anything.  Go for it, if you want.  It's
your choice.

On the other hand, I appreciate a good cigar and a rare pipe of
quality tobacco.  But lots of people don't, so I'm careful of
the smoke, including wind direction.  I'll do my best to look
out for your space if you agree to do the same for me.

OK, OK, I'm probably preaching to the choir.  But check out for
yourself how similar are the tactics.  Am I just seeing things?

Steve, you might as well keep me on the list with original address. What I
wondered was if you ever received my lenthy letter in which I told of my pipe
smoking experiences and likes. I was 69 in February and have been smoking a
pipe since I was 17, and cigars also. While in high school, I worked after
school in the train years of the New Haven railroad in Stamford, Conn. and
there was no smoking in the shops, and since I wasn't about to chew tobacco, I
chewed on cigars instead, and then began smoking them on my breaks and after
work. Since those days, I have come to appreciate good pipes, cigars, and
tobacco. One of the sources you didn't list was Fader's of Baltimore, whose
shop in Annapolis I shop at. Great walk-in cigar humidor with greater cigars. I
have been smoking a mixture of Fader's called Barrister, which has both Perique
and Latakia but not to an overwhelming amount. I also used to shop in another
great pipe store in Annapolis, The Smoke Shop, which has a tobacco called Black
and Gold which is a heavier perique/latakia mixture. I rarely go there anymore,
I'm sad to say, because it is downtown where parking is very difficult. I'll
have to go back soon, but as long as my tobacco and cigars last, no trip for a
while. Meanwhile, keep up the list and the news. I enjoy them both, and let's
confound the antismoking zealots, who are worse than the worst Puritans in our
history. Ben Frank

&gt; The war against tobacco is not new.  In 1604, King James I published
&gt; the famous "Counterblaste to Tobacco," and banned the cultivation and
&gt; use of tobacco in England.   Neither has this war ever been won, and 
&gt; all prohibitions have ultimately been overturned through popular
&gt; pressures.  We are part of the populace, and as such, must stand up

In my brief studies of the history of anti-smoking movements over the
last 150 years in this country, all have ultimately been overturned
by the onset of a major (civil or world) war.

Well I got a couple of replies on my suggestion, but no turn out

BTW, there is a TinderBox in the Dayton Mall, and a nice little

Greetings, On the subject of American Spirit Tobacco I believe it is a 
cigarette variety. I was turned on to it on the last day of one of my 
computer classes. I was speaking with the assistant about the class and 
maybe ways of improving it when he pulls out this pouch and rolls himself 
a cigarette, I asked him what he smoked and he showed me the American 
Spirit label. We started talking about tobaccos and I decided to try a 
puff on his cigarette which he offered. I found it very tasty and 
needless to say I keep some with me when I don't have time to smoke my 
pipe. (I use a rolling machine by the way, my skills at hand rolling are 
poor to say the least:&gt;)

Also, This man offered me a job as a computer consultant. So I guess 
smoking can lead to good things :&gt;

It has been a while since I last contributed, I am happy to share with my
fellow cigar smokers a true gem... The Zino Mouton Cadet.

I found this thin, solidly packed Zino at the Davidoff shoppe on Montreal's
Sherbrooke Street West. What a fabulous, full bodied taste! Not a touch of
acidity (unlike a awful dannemann that I also tried). That after-taste reminds
me of
delicious black forest cake, though less aggresive, the taste lingers rather
than invade your palate. I can not recommend this cigar more highly.

Now that bad part... The cigar was 'on special', reduced from $Can 15- to
$Can 8-.... Add our 15.6% vat and your looking at about $Can 9.20 for a
6 inch by 3/8 inch cigar. Such price, heaven!

The Dannemann was equal in proportion, but at $Can 2.75, a cheap smoke, imagine
sucking on the exhaust of a diesel bus... But in terms of sheer annoyance power
("Whaddya mean i can't smoke seegars here, god dammit.. Puff puff ack ack ack)
it is hiroshima in a leaf.

NOPE - That was the Tinderbox at Stanford Mall. Gone now, I'm afraid. A
victim of the precarious financial status of the Tinderbox chain. The
story, as I heard it, is that the mall wouldn't renew the lease, since the
chain (and franchising organization - ie: the Tinderbox) needed to be on
the lease, and they were in some type of financial difficulty
(bankruptcy?).

Sad story. The Stanford Tinderbox had a very good selection, although a
little pricey.  I bought both an ODA Shell and group 6 smooth finish in the
months before they closed.

<a name="4">Subject: Re:  Internet Pipes mailgroup</a>

Hi there,

I've joined this mailgroup to get some advice; my local machine does not get
the usenet newsgroup alt.smokers.cigars.  I'm a fairly recent cigar smoker,
and I've been forced, due to price restrictions, to limit myself to the
cheaper boxed cigars.  I've been advised by local tobacconists that "There are
only two sorts of cigars: Cuban, and the rest", and that "Dutch cigars aren't
really much chop", a statement with which I'm beginning to agree.

However, by the time good quality Cuban cigars reach these shores, the costs
of freight and import duties mean that the resulting prices are far more than
I can justify spending.  An understanding tobacconist, to whom I confided my
plight, put me onto Villiger cigars, a box of which I'm currently enjoying.
And here's my question -- what other cheap type cigars are worth my trying?  I
like (as far as I can tell) a relatively mild cigar, but one with a bit of
flavour.  I don't like cigars that taste like the after-effects of a bush
fire; that is to say, I like the cigar to have a "refined" sort of taste.  (I
wish I knew more, so that I could be more explicit).  Also, I don't like
cigars that are too big, or that take too long to smoke; about 20--30 minutes
is enough for me.

Do please let me know of anything that I might try.  On the other hand, if
anybody has any material about cigars, available electronically, I would be
delighted to receive such material via email, or be told how to acquire it via
anonymous ftp.

With regard to pipes (since this seems to be that main topic of this
mailgroup), I tried pipe smoking about ten years ago (I'm now 33), and enjoyed
it.  My main peeve was that they kept going out, and I kept having to relight
them.  What I liked was the long stemmed clay pipes which not only cooled the
tobacco nicely, but were pleasant to hold.  I never made any real discoveries
as to which sort of tobacco I liked.  Maybe one day I'll go back to pipe
smoking again, but at the moment, I'm more interested in cigars, about which
any advice would be most gratefully received.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Greetings to all.
	I live with three other guys here at Marquette, and in the last week we
have smoked about fifty cigars between the four of us.  What a week!  Most of
them have been Fuentes.  We have discovered that Uhle's (our local cigar and
pipe haven) sells Fuente seconds for about half the price of the regulars. 
What joy!

	Two QUESTIONS:

	1) I live in Milwaukee.  Where can I find a supplier for La Gloria
Cubana Torpedos?  A friend of mine thinks these are the best cigars he ever
smoked.  (I'm not sure what to think after the Twain essay.)

	2) There is a famous pipe shop in Michigan. Bill's Pipe shop?
Is this right?  Does anyone have information on this?  Address?
Phone?  Fax?  Latitude?  Longitude?

Post AND/OR send to ????????????@???.???.??.???

[ Answered somewhat in the mail -- the pipe shop is Paul's in Flint,

I figured I'd write a short letter of introduction. I wish I had found
this group earlier but at least I have found it now. I will be going away
for the summer but I'll be back in August. So, my name is Adrienne but
every one calls me Andie. I'm an English major with a Women's Studies minor
at New Mexico State University. I'm 19 and have only been smoking a pipe
  for a short time. I have always loved the look and smell of a pipe so I
decided to try one. I admit that I do get some strange looks because I am
a woman. I go to a pretty conservative school where traditional gender
roles are the norm. A woman smoking a pipe goes against the norm. Smoking
is a way to relax and I refuse to give that up because of convention. I am
in the process of looking for a first pipe that is right for me. Right now
I borrow a friend's pipe or smoke a corn cob. I have my eye on a few and
am really excited about actually buying my first pipe. I guess that's it.
This will probably be my only message until August( I don't know how I'll
get along without email). So, smoke well everyone!

I think the issue here is not burn marks. They wouldn't go away, just using
the hankerchief. Only way to avoid those, are sticking to the ol' wooden
matches or a pipe lighter. It's almost impossible to avoid burning the top,
when using an ordinary type lighter (vertical flame type).
The brown/black substance building up on the top of the bowl, originate from
the burning tobacco. This is easily removed. No need to ruin your hankerchief.
Water is the magic dissolver. A Kleenex, napkin or anything alike, moistened
with water, or even saliva, will do the trick. Just don't let the bowl top
get too dirty. Frequent cleening is esential. This will even work on a sand-
blasted pipe.
If you like your (smooth) pipe-top real shiney, just rub it with a piece of
plain Xerox paper, after the water cure. Voila...

Happy smoking.

&gt;really are the same -- the right to control one's own body. -S. ]

Steve,

I am writing in response to the above statements.

I disagree with both.   The tactics the antismokers use are 
scare tactics based on altered E.P.A. data (I'm speaking of the changing
of the confidence factors.).  The tactics the antiabortionists use (at
least the ones with whom I work) are based on presenting the facts which
are available through genetics, biochemistry, and classical physics.  There
is an immeasureable difference between someone "lighting up" and enjoying
tobacco and someone getting an abortion.  These issues are not even close
to being the same.  As for the right to control one's own body, may I 
please point out two things: first, I know of no example in
the history of Western Civilization which provides precedence for this
alleged "right"; second, even if the availability of abortions were controlled,
this would not alter in any way the "right" of the woman to control her body.
It would simply make her responsible for her actions. 

There have recently been a few books published by people who have left the
abortion industry.  What they relate is rather grisly; in fact,it's nothing 
short of frightening.  Just as the antismokers who don't want you to know
about the 29 reports which found no reasonable evidence to link second hand
smoke with cancer, the abortion industry doesn't want you to know the facts.
They have much to hide.

Try one of the books.

Joe

[ Sorry I opened that whole can of worms, Joe. Mea culpa, mea maxima
culpa... Further discussion of abortion issues offline or in the
relevant groups, please. -S. ]

WEll. Here's a profile for you all. ( hope this works. ) I live in Columbis
Ohio ( usa ) Got into pipes and cigars via a freind who worked for the Tinder
Box. Have a hard time keeping the pipe lit,  so I have a great respect now
for the convenience of the cigar. Beyond that, ( and unk=like a cigarrette
which one would smoke at any occasion as an afterthought, the cigar or pipe
is a calculated event in itself. There is a ceremony to it. It requires
thought. We live in an increasingly homogenized world, where corporations
ceate the rituals and decide the  rythms by which we live our lives. Missing
are the rituals and traditions of the individual. Like the use of a mug and
brush to shave with ( including it's obligatory stirring and more stirring ),
Cigar and pipe smoking offers the individual a chance to take back a measure
of control to thier lives through personal ritual. And very few things in the
modern world can lay claim to that ability. I hope this expresses some of
what other pipe and cigar smokers feel. If it rings true, e-mail me at :

&gt;
&gt;I've joined this mailgroup to get some advice; my local machine
&gt;does not get the usenet newsgroup alt.smokers.cigars.  I'm a fairly
&gt;recent cigar smoker, and I've been forced, due to price
&gt;restrictions, to limit myself to the cheaper boxed cigars.  I've
&gt;been advised by local tobacconists that "There are only two sorts of
&gt;cigars: Cuban, and the rest", and that "Dutch cigars aren't really
&gt;much chop", a statement with which I'm beginning to agree.

After smoking a pipe for several years and only an occassional cigar,
I was given a copy of Thompson catalog [address in resource guide].
I just finished the Gold Medal Sampler of 42 cigars for $14.90 + S&amp;H.
They are mostly short filler of varying colors and sizes.  While not
the Cadillac of cigars, they're not a Yugo either.  I'm waiting for
my Maduro sampler to arrive.  It is a quick, inexpensive way to try a
number of different cigars.

Steve. Nice meeting you and learning about the Pipe Mail Group online. Thanks
for the quick response. 

Last night I was idly going through the latest Ephemeris (Winter-Spring '94)
and there on page 61, in a letter from Thorsten Kramp in Germany, was
information about the Group and your e-mail address. 

I'm a 30-year pipe smoker and, with so many good tobacconists closing their
doors (Wilke in NYC is a recent casualty), I'm happy to have the information
from you about reliable mail-order contacts. I'm more of a smoker than a
collector, and have accumulated about 40 good pipes over the years - a few
freehands, but mostly traditional shapes: Dunhill, Barling, Charatan, and
some great-smoking lesser names. My tobaccos? English blends and Virginias,
in tins. I've never been satisfied with any of the "pipe shop blends," but
would love to locate a good source of unflavored mixtures.

All the best. Charles Crawford

Hello:
	Just joined the list and received a very nice "letter" of welcome
from Steve Masticola (thanks Steve). I must say that as a newcomer to the 
"net" I've found that people can be rather cool to newusers, if Steve's
post is any indication that does'nt appear to be the case here!
	Anyhow I suppose I should tell a bit about myself...
I'm married (no kids - yet), two dogs, couple of tankfulls of tropical fish,
love to ski (alpine), enjoy hunting (when I get the time - usually grouse and
white-tailed deer), enjoy a good game of backgammon or squash, skydive (when I
can afford to - sports a lot more expensive today than when I started in 1978.
	About a dozen pipes (all styles) although a nice bent is my
favourite!  Favourite brands a Peterson (the older ones - since lately
I can't find one toda^[ with good briar), Soren, and Danish
Sovereign. As far as tobacco is concerned I like a full-flavoured
canendish with a light roast mixed with viginia &amp; burley. Before they
stopped importing it into Canada I loved "Mullinger's Knockbrack", a
Danish blend from Ireland...if anyone knows where I can find a north
american supplier for it I'd be eternally grateful!
	I also enjoy a good cigar from time to time as a special "treat".
	Well its getting late, and I work "dayshift" tomorrow (May 18) so...
time to finish off this last bowl and "tuck-in".

	I have a question for the net. 
	I am a relatively new member of the pipes forum, having switched
from cigarettes to pipes after smoking for 32 years. I recently purchased
several decent pipes, including a Nording, BJarne, and a couple of Savinelli
(Milan, Designer). The Nording and 1 of the Savinelli apparently have soft
spots towards the bottom of the bole, since the pipe has charred through the
sides a bit. Is this normal, and is there any advice about what to do? 
	In addition, the BJarne has begun charring on the outside of the bowl.
I plan on taking it back to the pipe store, since there is an apparent flaw in
the bowl.
	I would appreciate any suggestions members of the forum have.
My address is ????????@????.???.???.???.
	Thanks.

[ Utterly UNnormal, Kenneth -- sounds like you're smoking them WAY too
hard! I could believe a defect in one pipe, but three? But I could be
wrong... any other theories? -S. ]

Thank you for stopping the abortion - smoking routine before it got too 
intense.  I am sure that we all have very strong feelings on both 
matters, however, I enjoy this newsgroup for the same reason that I enjoy 
my pipes (I have purchased another) or a good cigar.  The pipes newsgroup 
is a break from reality; a chance to leave the constant arguments and 
anger outside, where they belong.  I would hate to have to pick through 
the pipes newsgroup to find letters that have to do with cigars and 
pipes, rather than abortion, and politics.

No judgements from me.  Just please, keep the discussion to pipes, 
cigars, and tobacco.

A note to "???????@???.???": I agree with you 100% I enjoy the break from 
the routine.  I smoke cigars and pipes, I use a shaving brush, and drive 
a '69 Roadrunner.  IMHO, the "old ways" are the best.

BTW I have moved to Victoria, B.C. over the summer for work.  In this 
city at 1116 Government Street, there is a glorious tobacconist called 
Morris'.  If you're in the area (possibly for the `94 Commonwealth Games) 
check this place out.  It is another one of the old classics.

Until the next trip to Vancouver to check up on my e-mail
See Ya.

Maybe you're not breaking them in properly.  Before you smoke a pipe the
first time, wet the inside of the bowl _immediately_ before smoking (just
lick your finger and run it inside), then smoke it all the way to the
bottom without stopping.  This will help lay a protective layer in the
bowl... and should take care of your problems.

<a name="5">Subject: Pipes Digest Hello.</a>

My name is Jason Christen and I have been receiving the pipes digest for
about a month or so, and I finally got time to write.  I am 20 years old
and am currently attending Bowling Green State University.  I have been
smoking cigars for about 3 years and every once in a while I smoke a pipe,
but cigars are my main thing.  I have found Pipes Digest very enjoyable
and I like to hear eveybodys stories.  If you do not mind I want to tell a
little story about my cigar smoking experience.
	I really did not get into smoking cigars until my freshman year in
college, but I would have to say it was one of the best things that have
ever happened to me.  Durring my first year I lived with my best friend of
18 years in one of the dorms on campus.  We started smoking cigars
together and we found that it brought us closer together.  Since Bowling
Green State University's buildings are non-smoking my best friend and I
had to find a place to smoke our new found treasures.  We tried different
benches and steps outside of buildings, but these did not seem to suit our
needs.  Finally we  found a little hallway that was between two of the
older buildings on campus, it was perfect.  This hallway soon became a
temple for Ben and I.  We spent many nights smoking our cigars and
discussing our plans for the future.  The smoking hall was great, it was a
place where we could unwind and forget about the cares of the world.  I
think that cigars are the greatest gift to man, and to have a special
place to smoke them makes it even more wonderful.
	Oh, one more thing, I am looking for a woman who does not mind
cigar smoking.  I almost asked a total stranger to mary me once because
she told me that my cigar sure smelled nice.

From: Steve Weinberg/HQ/3Com

(From May 13th Pipes Digest) " An understanding tobacconist, to whom I
confided my plight, put me onto Villiger cigars, a box of which I'm
currently enjoying.  And here's my question -- what other cheap type
cigars are worth my trying?  I like (as far as I can tell) a
relatively mild cigar, but one with a bit of flavour.  I don't like
cigars that taste like the after-effects of a bushfire; that is to
say, I like the cigar to have a "refined" sort of taste."

I have smoked Villagers for several years now.  I usually take them
traveling because I was told by several knowledgeable people that it
was a "dry" cigar and would therefore not have to be kept in a
humidified environment.  I am not sure about that, can others confirm?
I smoke Uppman's Churchill's at home.  What I do know about the
Villiger is that they are from Switzerland where they are relatively
low priced there about $3.50 for 5 pack.  That was the only bargain I
ever found in Switzerland other than some good chocolate. They come in
square and round or "rund" shapes and the ones in Switzerland are made
from real Havana tobacco.  There are the other Villager cigars, the
"Export" stuff, which is sent over to the US and supposedly is made
from Dominican leaf Havana seed tobacco.  In the US, the back of the
five pack boxes are crossed over where they used to say "Made from
Havana Tobacco".  The ones in Switzerland are a bit stronger and
different shapes are available compared to the US versions where I've
only seen two square sizes.  I found that several of the airport duty
free shops in Germany, England and Ireland sold the Swiss version of
them in larger boxes of 25 "to go."  Steve Weinberg

Hi Steve. I just happened to be in Rochester for the Hamfest last weekend
and we stayed in Geneva. Very nice area. Will have to come back
and explore the lakes region better.  We saw the signs to be wineries-
and just what/how good are NY wines? A bottle of red with a Montecristo
would gone together very well.

BTW, the hamfest was excellent. In some ways I find the flea market
better than Dayton.

<a name="7">Subject: General babble</a>

          Just some random thoughts here:
          
               I rarely smoke more than a bowlful every other day.  That 
          probably puts me a the low end of the spectrum, but I find I have 
          a delicate mouth, and my enjoyment diminishes greatly if I exceed 
          this.  (I have trouble sleeping on mattresses with peas in them, 
          too....)  Besides, I enjoy the aftertaste that can last for a day 
          sometimes, and if I smoke more than every other day, I don't get 
          that same effect.
          
               As a result, I probably haven't built up any decent chars on 
          my pipes (I have four, two of which I use most of the time.)  The 
          two I smoke most are both medium to low priced pipes.  I have a 
          Nording freehand that I bought in a fit of self indulgence that 
          I'm slowly getting the hang of.  Any words of advice?
          
               It is also taking me some time to develop a discriminating 
          palate, so my knowledge of tobaccos is very limited.  One that I 
          have found that I like a lot is Orkney, from John Crouch at the 
          Scottish Merchant in Alexandria, Virginia.  It's an aromatic with 
          a bit of Latakia for some oomph.
          
               Given the state of the world, I'm also a closet puffer.  
          Neither of my housemates appreciates the art, so I've been forced 
          into the great outdoors.  And since I don't have any pipe-smoking 
          friends I can't seek comfort in another person's home.  What a 
          lonely existence!!!  Anybody out there in the Washington, DC 
          area?
          
               Thanks for your valuable service to mankind by keeping these 
          digests coming!

Steve, thank you for the introductory material and the welcome.  And, so I
don't forget, I would appreciate any of the older digests you could pull out
of your archieve and send my way.

As with one of your most recent new members, I too have been smoking a pipe
for about 30 plus years.  Since I am but a few months shy of my 45th birthday,
it's plain I started young.  My grandfather gave me a corn cob pipe one time
when we went fishing one time near where I was born in northern Wisconsin.  And
since it was his wish to fish most of the lakes in that area, I had plenty of
time to use it.  I am not sure what tobacco he used, and since my recollection
was that it looked like something scraped off the bottom of a table in a diner,
maybe it's just as well to forget it.  But I do remember the corn cobs he gave
me since they always had the six inch bamboo stem and the mouthpiece was one
of the "knuckles" or joints on the bamboo.  Even after I started collected
some better pipes, I would always keep a few of those corn cobs around.  Still
do, but I have been unable to find the old ones with just the cob and just the
bamboo stem.  Does anyone have a source of supply of those old ones?  As for
smoking, I mostly smoke around the house now that we have limited smoking at
work to a little gulag outside each building where folks huddle around while
smoking.  Public pillory I guess.  And, since I had an office with a door, I
enjoyed smoking a pipe or two during the day.  But that was then and this is
now.  As for home now, East Tennessee is home and we have a excellent pipe and
cigar shop in Knoxville called Smokey's, and Smokey's son is very good at
repairing pipes.  I brought about a dozen and a half pipes with broken bits
with me when I moved from Washington DC to here, and since I haven't suffered
a broken bit in the five years I have lived here, I think I have good proof
that one can break out of the tension and stress of DC and lead a better life.
Well, even though pipe smokers probably have good wind from not smoking
cigarettes, I think I ought not prove how long winded I can be with much more
of a message.  I look forward to corresponding with you and others who
appreciate pipes and who understand just how much smoke is being blown about
by those who would stick us outside our place of work or favorite restaurant.

Hi folks.  I'm quite a newcomer to the exciting world of pipes [and 
I smoke the occasional cigar] so I hope to learn a lot.
	I'm a sophomore at Yale University in New Haven, CT, who
will probably major in Computer Science and Philosophy, or just
Computer Science.
	May 23rd was commencement here, and I learned of a nice
tradition here:  all the seniors get little clay pipes and some
tobacco. Apparently, they are supposed to smoke the pipes and then
crush them, symbolizing their graduation.
	That's not the nice part, however. :)  It is that I have
lots of friends who just graduated but don't smoke, so I got
them to give me their tobacco. Heh heh. :)

Looking forward to some informative and friendly discourse,

Perhaps I'm a bit behind on the youngest smoker contest, but I just got 
this story recently.

I was smoking a cigar with my sister's boyfriend last weekend and we 
started talking about how we got started smoking.  He told me that his 
grandmother (!) had taught him how to smoke a cigar at age 6.  It seems 
that her husband (who had died) had been a cigar smoker and she really 
missed the smell of it in the house.  When he was 6 she told him that he 
was old enough to learn how to smoke, so she taught him to cut it, get it 
lit, and come by the ashtray every so often to take a puff so it didn't 
burn out.

Well, it's not a pipe, but 6?  That, IMHO, takes it.

Hi.
Occasional pipe smoker since 1972 -- 12 to 40 bowls per *year*.  But
when the urge comes, it's a wonderful pleasure that brings a peace
"that passeth understanding."

I own just four pipes; two bent; and two straight, one with a
meerschaum block lining; the other a traditional apple-shaped briar.
The bents are both el cheapo mass-production items; one, though, is
an anti-lemon: very very pleasant smoking, cool and not too wet
(unless I get hasty!!).  Cavendish, black or otherwise, is my
preferred twaway to prepare of tobacco.  As for tobacconists, I'found
two favourites in the 22 years (both are still there): Sherlock's
Haven in "the city" (San Francisco), and Au Caid on the Boul'Mich in
Paris.

Ben voyons... thinking of Au Caid makes me want to go light one...

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States
Department of Labor has issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on indoor air
quality (IAQ) and secondhand smoke.  OSHA would impose broad requirements on
employers regarding air quality and the operation and maintenance of heating,
ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.  It would effectively
prohibit smoking in indoor public places.

Smoking would be banned in restaurants bars, private clubs, retail
establishments, office buildings, government buildings, bingo parlors,
bowling alleys, casinsos, hotels and motels, sports arenas and even
residences where work is taking place, unless specially ventilated smoking
areas are established.

It is the most far\-reaching proposed smoking restriction in history, and
would override every less-restrictive state and local regulation currently on
the books.

It would apply to EVERY employer, regardless of size, with the exception of
self-employed individuals.

People interested in voicing their concerns should write a letter to OSHA.
(For ideas on what to say...see later on in letter)  Letters must be
postmarked by June 29, 1994.

SO HERE'S WHAT TO DO:

1.  Write a letter telling OSHA that you object to this proposal.
2.  Take your letter and make three copies of it.  PUt your original letter
plus three copies into an envelope.
3.  Address your envelope to:
                                               The Docket Office
                                               Docket No. H-122
                                               Room N-2625
                                               U.S. Department of Labor
                                               200 Constitution Avenue, NW
                                               Washington, DC  20210

4.  Print your return address on the envelope and mail it as soon as possible
before Jun 29, 1994

TIPS FOR YOUR LETTER TO OSHA

&lt;---ideas that you may wish to include in your letters:

1.  Keep you rletters short and clearly state your position on the proposed
OSHA regulation on smoking in the workplace.

2.  The proposed regulations go too far.  In some cases, the proposals might
even invade the privacy of your own home.  If you pay someone to work in your
home, then you may lose the right to smoke in your own home.  Personal
freedom is at stake.

3.  The proposal amounts to a ban on smoking.  This is an attempt at a
backdoor prohibition.  The majority of Americans oppose prohibition.

4.  The current systems works.  There is no need for the federal government
to further regulate smoking.

Why send all these copies.

OSHA requires four copies of comments on this issue.  We know this is
inconvenient, but it is required.  OSHA WILL NOT READ, NOR COUNT ENVELOPES
THAT DO NOT CONTAIN THE ORIGINAL LETTER PLUS 3 COPIES OF IT.


[ This is scary. Please write the Department of Labor, with four
copies of your letter -- and also write your elected
representatives. Please take the time to do it TODAY.

Hi Steve,
	I have a question for anyone who may have an answer. I currently use
a nice Irish second briar and I have developed a problem. The first half of
the bowl smokes very nicely, yet the second half or so tends to burn out 
extremely fast...in fact, it's almost impossible to keep it lit.

Any ideas would be appreciated.

	I would like to learn, how and from which types of tobaccos, that 
various pipe tobacco's are manufactured.  The stuff they sell at the 
Supermarket is so nasty :(  .   What do they use precisely to flavor it 
etc. Might enjoy getting some good clean burley tobacco and making my own 
if I had some recipes to play with.

Steve,

I have been listening in for about a month and a half and I really
enjoy these Digests.  I thought something was missing for a while
and it appears I missed #144, if you could please send it if you 
still have it around.  I am fairly new to pipes and smoking in general
(started cigs at 24, rolling my own for a year or so, and a pipe for about
2 years, I am now 31)  and I am thinking about a second or third pipe to
celebrate finishing grad school and getting a job.  Along these lines,
I have a few questions:

Does anyone have any suggestions for buying a meerschaum?  What should I
look for?  How should I take care of it so it colors nicely?  Do I need
to smoke just one blend in it or can I mix and match?

I will be moving to central Louisiana in August and I need to know if I 
should stock up here and buy my new pipes before I go or will I be able
to find any good shops there?  I did not see anything listed for Louisiana
but I didn't see any listed for Colorado either and I know of two in Ft.
Collins and two or three in Denver.

Is there a good book out on the market for beginners with pipes?  I did
not have a father or grandfather to teach me (life growing up in Utah)
so this has all been a self-taught experience which brings to mind a
passage out of Luke about "the blind leading the blind and both falling 
in the ditch".  Your introductory information was VERY helpful but I 
was hopeful for something more.

Thanks for all your help and willingness to listening to someone who has
let his questions build up.

Hi Steve: J. Upshaw firmly in teeth, thought I'd mention to members that
there is a nice tobacco shop/mail order place in Miami at Harborside called
Kings Treasure. They have a catalog (for cigars) and an 800 # which I don't

I've only experience with a few shops around here, but in

one of the most friendly, helpful shops around.  They don't
have the largest selection I've seen, but they've always
been kind and courteous to this neophyte.  Please add this

Steve,

This is my first letter to your group.  I am 26 years and have been
smoking pipes and cigars on and off for the past ten or so years.  For
everybody out there who gets too stressed and uptight about not being
able to smoke at home with your loved one, don't forget there is
always wine!  I can always relax and forget about the cares of the
world sitting anywhere I want in my house with a nice glass of vino.
And as long as I'm willing to pay I can drink any kind of wine I want
- no embargoes here folks!  Also, afterwards, you don't have to brush
your teeth a hundred times, or wash your clothes in acid, and who
knows, maybe afterwards the two of you might get into the mood for
other things as well!

&gt; However, what's your opinion of the place?

Well, I was smoking Virgina Circles for a couple of months,
and pipes for only about a year longer than that, when I wandered
into Nat Sherman's in NYC. I only had about five minutes to spend,
so I quickly bought some pipe tobacco (should have bought a fresh 
box of cigs, too) and scampered off.

The salesmen were dressed in suits but were very courteous to me, a
scruffy looking student carrying a large duffle. Even though the shop
is right on Fifth Aveneue in the largest city in the world I saw the
staff converse on a friendly level with some people who appeared to be
regulars. I value that kind of thing.

I didn't have a chance to sample any of their cigar humidor, but Nat
Sherman's cigarettes are simply the best packaged cigarettes I have
*ever* smoked. The pipe tobacco I bought was the best and most suited
to my tastes that I have *ever* bought. The Nat Sherman's store in New
York was one of the nicest tobacconists I have *ever* visited.

If you're going to be in the area, would you be able to pop in and
snag me a couple ounces of "Golden Virginian"? I'd sell my best briar
for more of that leafy nectar! Of course, that still leaves me my
meerschaum. =^&gt;

Hi Steve, 

Thanks for sending me the mailgroup so quickly.

My name is Kevin Stampfl, I'm a student at UC Davis. I'm 25 and have been 
smoking pipes and cigars since I was 13. I bought my first pipe at 14 
while vacationing in Australia, under the pretense that it was a gift for 
my father. My smoking habits vary, however I rarely exceed once or twice 
a week. I guess that makes me a dilletant. There's nothing I love better 
than to sit with friends drinking single malt scotches and sucking on 
good cigars. Anyways, I have mixed feelings about the whole smoking thing 
since cigarettes bug the hell out of me and I study toxicology. However I 
certainly would never begrudge anyone the right to smoke whatever they 
want, including cigarettes, opium, or arsenic, and I'm glad there is a non 
political forum for the discussion of pipes and cigars. 

Kevin

Thanks for the fast turn-around in signing up.  Any or all of the back
issues you could send would be appreciated.  I would like to get
caught up before commenting on what is new to me, but might be old
news to others.

On your list of pipe shops I do have a couple of suggestions to add.

The Owl Shop two locations, one in Worcester Mass, the other in New
Haven.  They are run by George Photakis (Worcester) and his sister,
Mrs. St. James.  David Sklar from Yale should send us all a review of
the New Haven store as they are feet from Yale and probably started
the tradition of giving claypipes to the seniors at the local
finishing school, aka Yale.

 Mrs. St. James is a jewel, running what she describes as the oldest
tobacconist in thecountry.  She currently (when I was there in April)
had many old Algerian briars left from the early 1960's. Seems during
the Black Panther trials held in New Haven in the 1960's led
Mr. St. James to take the pipes to his home where they languished
until now.  George runs a great store in Worcester, selling his own
blends, as well as some made in New Haven.  George's son, John, used
to make pipes on the second floor, but he has not done so since I
first went in five years ago.  I did find one of his pipes through
Levin International (it is a great pipe) and am looking for more.  If
anyone wants to get rid of any, please send mail.

The second store you should add is Perreti's in Boston. (21/2 Park
Square) It has been there for years, has a good catalog for the
asking, and their own blends.

Having done my bit to add names to the list, let me tell you about my
collection/interests.  I started with a pipe years ago in college,
gave it up, and have come back in the last several years.  The early
pipes were seconds from Leavitt &amp; Pierce in Cambridge, augmented by
Ehrlich (their sister store) in the past ten years.  I then found
Barry Levin and tried, at the urging of a friend, Upshalls, moving up
to Charatons.  At this point I tend toward the used/collector pipes,
as I feel they offer better value, and want to add to the Upshalls,
Charatons, Photakis which I have.  I am also considering Italians, but
of the three I have had so far, one is so-so, one I gave to a friend,
and one I still have under advisement to see if it will prove to be
worth keeping.  In the meantime, I would consider swapping it (it is a
rough finish Brebbia, full bent).

Thanks for the info.

PS  Which address is the proper one to use?  This or the one listed as

Yes, it's been three weeks since the last Digest. Many things have
intervened; buying a house and moving into it, a trip to a conference,
etc. But join us now as we continue the legislative debate (which I'll
try to tone down in later issues, but I think it's important), and
hear some clubby news from Los Angeles... 

And, of course, happy Fourth of July and Canada Day to our readers in
North America! (Hope I got it right... :) Enjoy those barbecues, and
perhaps a good smoke along with the fireworks.

<a name="3">Subject: "Vintage" cigars...</a>

Steve et al..

A while back (and I *do* mean a while back) I posted a question
on so called "Vintage" cigars. An uncle of mine who is a big
cigar smoker had one many years ago at a business meeting (happy
days, conducting business with a cigar and a glass of port!). He
knew nothing much about what constitutes a vintage and nor
do I, I still don't know but I have finally tried one.

What I had was a Dunhill Altamiras from the "Harvest Crop 1987" and
the cigar states "Aged Cigar". My impression was very good, it was
a fairly mild cigar, which suits me fine and although it does not
state the origin of the tobacco, I reckon on Cuban for two
reasons:
        1. It reminded me (a lot) of a Romeo y Julietta (yum!),
           the flavour was more even and, I suppose, mature.

        2. It cost six pounds (about 9 dollars).

If you see one, I'd reccomend giving it a try. All in all I
found it very enjoyable, sociable smoke.

I'm still interested in finding out more on Vintage Cigars though,
I still say it's a gimmick...

<a name="4">Subject: The Owl Shop</a>

The tradition of crushing clay pipes at Yale's commencement (which the Owl 
Shop used to participate in) was more elaborate at one time.  A briar pipe 
with a Yale "Y" and the class year inlaid in silver was presented to the 
class president, and was passed around for everyone to smoke.  Mr. St. 
James of the Owl Shop used to bejewel these pipes himself, and when he 
passed away the art was lost.  The Yale administration banned the practice 
in the late sixties, probably due to typical concerns about "elitism" and 
the like.

The Owl Shop cannot be the oldest tobacconist in the country, for it was 
founded in 1934.  I know of at least one tobacconist, Boston's David P. 
Ehrlich (parent of Leavitt &amp; Pierce), which was established prior to 
that time (in 1868, to be exact).

Re: Proposed Smoking Legislation

This isn't going to be popular, but that's never stopped me before... ;)

I've been smoking cigars and pipes since I was sixteen, and I've got to say
that I'm in favor of this legislation.  If the people around me when I'm in
public don't want to breath my smoke, then I think they have that right.  I
know that I don't want to breath anyone else's cigarette smoke, or even
cheap cigar smoke.  (Good cigars are an entirely different matter, of
course.)

Some of this might be due to the fact that I'm in California, so year
'round I have the option of stepping outside to enjoy my pipe/cigar...

If smoking was as non-intrusive as chewing gum, then I'd think this is
outrageous.  It's not.  If they were coming into my house and telling me
what to do, I'd be offended, but they're not.

So... count me as the minority of the minority, I guess.

I am not impressed with Nat Sherman's. The salespeople dress well, the decor 
is impressive, the space dignified, but they have a poor stock of pipes and 
tinned tobacco, and they don't know anything about pipes. The best stocked 
store with the most knowledgable personnel in NYC is De La Concha on 6th 
Ave. and 55th St. Barclay-Rex (70 E. 42nd and 7 Maiden Lane) is also good, 
although the salespeople are not as well-informed. Barclay-Rex still has 
tins of their English made-to-order Virginia Flake. This is a very good 
basic flake, which is, needless to say, no longer manufactured. These tins 
are years old and sell for $4 each (50 grams).

I recently began to subscribe to the digest and though maybe an 
introduction was in order.  My name is Gideon Pollach and I am a student 
at Trinity College in Hartford CT. I recently started smoking 
pipes,through the encouragement o a friend, also a digest subscriber, and 
I have a question.  How neccesary is the pre-treatment of the pipe?  I 
have read agreat deal but always manage to forget it when I start to 
break in a new pipe.  If this is neccesary is there any remedy for the 
damage done to my pipes?  

I would appreciate any knowledgeable responses.  Thanks
Gideon

[ Breaking in? Depends on the pipe. The pre-carbonized ones supposedly
need no break-in, though I've found that even so it's 3-4 bowls before
they smoke right. -S. ]

<a name="9">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest</a>

I am listening since about five issues and realized that there seems to
be a tradition that people introduce themselves. Well, briefly, I am 33
and smoking pipes (with interruptions) since I was 17. Besides this I
enjoy good cigars, my favorites are Partagas and Romeo y Julietta. (I
tried several other, non-Cuban brands but, none of them convinced me.)

As to the development of anti-smoking initiatives in the states, it
might be interesting for you to know about the situation here in Europe:

Historically, the issue rised already in the mid-17th century:

[Some examples from a booklet I came across]

	1624: Pope Urban VIII banned smoking from the churches in Sevilla
	1634: Smoking was banned in Russia
	1650: Smoking ban in Peter's church in Rome (by pope Innozenz X)
	1653: Bavaria restricted selling tobacco to pharmacies  

Currently, all countries except Britain and the Scandinavian countries
are still quite relaxed wrt smoking. (France also has strict anti-
smoking laws, but nobody is taking them very seriously). The more south
you get, the less fuss people make about it. Here in Germany it is still
not a big issue -- I do not know of any non-smoking pub, for instance.
However, the situation might get worse, as what goes on in the states
seems to move over to Europe with a delay of 2 or 3 years. We will see...

So much to this; finally, I've got three questions:

I am supposed to spend a couple of days in Charlotte, NC; is
there any pipe shop worth visiting?

Out of curiosity: What is the approximate price of Middleton's Black
&amp; Mild in the US? I smoke it occasionally and for a puch I pay here
the equivalent of about 10 USD.

I would like to browse through the back issues of the pipes digest,
is there a way to get them (eg by ftp)? 

Cheers
	Joachim.

<a name="10">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #146 - June 9, 1994</a>

Hi, Steve:

First off, great list.  Now to the controversial stuff. ;)

&gt;But the proposal goes farther than that. It also says that you can't
&gt;go to _any_ indoor place and light up. You couldn't even run a private
&gt;club for smokers only. You couldn't light a cigar at your own wedding,
&gt;even if you rented the hall. Use a lighter, go to jail.
&gt;
&gt;I think this clearly violates the First Amendment right to peaceful
&gt;assembly for legal purposes.

I agree that you should be able to open a club for smokers, and hire
employees who realize that they'll be around smoke, and agree to it.  But
if you're just renting out a place for a night (wedding, etc), then you're
asking that the employees of the place all have to be exposed to smoke,
whether they like it or not.  If you make lead paint, you can tell
employees that part of the job is being exposed to it, but you don't have
the right to go paint any room that you rent, to use a clumsy analogy.

&gt;I'm all in favor of nonsmokers having places where no one smokes. I'd
&gt;even be in favor of that being the default. But I'm adamantly opposed
&gt;to it being a universal rule.

I think the point I'm trying to make is that smokers risk the health of
other people.  (I think with recent secondhand smoke studies, this is not
too much of a debatable fact.)  Even if they're not risking the health,
certain people simply don't enjoy inhaling other people's smoke.  (Count me
as one of those, when it comes to cigarettes.)  So _smokers_ are the ones
who infringe on the non-smokers rights when they're put together.  I think
I'm on the other side of it as you:  I'm all in favor of smokers having
places where everyone smokes.  But when you're in a place where you share
the air, the non-smoker has to win out.

Just the opinion of one smoker. ;)

Jeff

[ OTOH, many researchers think the smoke studies are highly suspect at
best, and blatant axe-grinding probably. There has been much
discussion about this on alt.smokers.

I'd concede that the employees should be free to seek employment in
establishments that never allow smoking. Of which there are plenty.
Likewise, patrons should be free to rent halls where smoking is
allowed. Let the employment market, as well as the patron market,
decide.

Re clubs for smokers go, see Duane Clark's article on the LA cigar
restaurant/bar. I think it would be illegal under the proposed
legislation. -S. ]

   I just read the first Digest that you sent.  Here are a couple of items
you may post or file.......
1)  Levin pipes, Int'l. - With the passing of Berry Levin, the business is
going through some changes.  They are as follows:  Kathy Levin (widdow) has
moved the business to 6113 Abbey Rd. - Aptos, CA  95003 (408) 477-0140.
Nikos Levin (son) opperates NML Pipes Dirrect - P.O. Box 1393 Burlington, VT
 05402 (802) 863-1379.
Kathy is specializing in the Specialty Tobacco portion of the business while
Nikos is concentrating on all aspects of the briar (new &amp; estate).  Highly
recommended.
2)  General, personal items - I am pushing 40 and have owned pipes for 20
years (regularly smoked for about 10 yrs.).  I have a number of pieces, in my
collection, but am now almost exclusivly interested in XXXL traditional
shapes (hense the name Giantbriar).  I am searching (aren't we all), for the
perfect tobacco.  To date, I can only say that the quest has centered within
the 'English' family.
I am also interested in talking to anyone who can make display racks
(inexpensivly) for my XXXL pipes.
3) In the hobby section of America Online there is a pipe and cigar forum.
 You might post your Digest notice there.

Happy Puffing........

Steve,  Thanks for adding me to the pipes mailgroup list.  
I am 50 years old and have smoked pipes since 20 or so.  I 
am a modest smoker--only a bowl or two per day--and my 
preference in tobacco is English type blends such as 
Dunhill #965, London Mixture, Balkan Sobrannie Black or 
Gray, and especially Connoisseur's Turkish Black.  I highly 
recommend the mixtures at Connoisseur, Ltd. in NYC.  They 
are expensive, but the best I've smoked.  I have a 
collection of 100 or so pipes among which my favorites are 
Dunhills and Charatans.

Although I rotate my pipes smoking each about five 
consecutive bowls, I have found that if I break in a new 
pipe smoking it about 3 to 4 dozen bowls one-half full or 
less I build up a nice carbon layer in the hell and avoid 
the wet, unpleasant smoke that so often happens during the 
last half of the pipe.  My pipes smoke to the bottom of the 
bowl leaving only a few ashes, not the wet gunk so many 
pipe smokers experience.

If possible, please send me all the past digests.  I will 
have a new internet address on July 1, 1994:

Steve,

Thanks for the intro package from the pipes mailgroup - I've dealt with 
about a half dozen of the pipe/tobacco retailers on your extensive list.  
I am primarily a cigar smoker and order most of my cigars from the Famous 
Smoke Shop in NYC.  I am also a woodworker and would like to build a nice 
humidor to hold 2-3 boxes of cigars, but have not been able to find plans 
or obtain suggestions after sending letters to several of the wood 
working magazines that I receive.  In the NY and Chicago shops the going 
prices for a small humidor often exceeds $500.  I would appreciate any 
comments from you or your subscribers regarding humidor plans or 
retailers that might have well made humidors that sell for several 
hundred dollars or less.  Thanks.

LA's Proposed "Premier Cigar Haven"

Seventy Seventy Partners is a pre-formation California limited
partnership planned to develop, own, and operate a restaurant and bar
in the metropolitan Los Angeles area.  The distinct and significant
feature of the restaurant will be its dedication to the enjoyment
of premium cigars by patrons at the premises.  The restaurant will
be designed to have a traditional club-like atmosphere, and will
serve simply prepared grill items along with contemporary fare.  Along
with fine cigars, the restaurant will feature premium beverages,
including single malt scotches and rare ports.

The restaurant will have an appearance and ambiance reminiscent of
the classic east coast restaurants and clubs created in the 1930's
and 1940's.  A large separate bar and salon area will be capable of
holding approximately 50 people and is expected to serve as an
independent destination place for patrons.

The restaurant will also contain a large walk-in humidor to maintain
the ideal temperature and humidity for cigars stored at the premises.
The humidor will include a wide variety of premium cigars.  Patrons
may purchase individual cigars to be smoked at the restaurant, and
individual and quantity packaged cigars for retail take-out.  Because
of the particular orientation of the restaurant, it is anticipated
that it will become a retail destination for cigar purchasers as well.  
A special section within the humidor will be provided for locked 
cigar safedeposit boxes that will be leased to patrons for the 
storage of their personal cigars.

A trained staff will be capable of making knowledgeable cigar suggestions
in the tradition of a skilled wine sommelier.

Sound interesting?  Let me know, fellow aficionados

Clay pipes ...

I got to thinking (dangerous, I know) that it might
be fun to try my hand at making a clay pipe or two.
My mother (an ex-art teacher) taught me the basics of
working with clay, and I've done a few simple things
in the past. There is a pottery guild here in Santa Cruz
where I can get things fired, so I think I have a good
shot at success.

Has on this list ever made a clay pipe? I've done a catalog
search of our local university library and have some leads on
books, but if anyone knows of any books that cover making
clay pipes in particular that would be helpful.

Thanks,

Kam Kashani

I don't want Jeff to feel lonely when the barrage comes, so I'll stand by
his side.

He wrote:
&gt; I've been smoking cigars and pipes since I was sixteen, and I've got to say
&gt; that I'm in favor of this legislation.  If the people around me when I'm in
&gt; public don't want to breath my smoke, then I think they have that right.  I
&gt; know that I don't want to breath anyone else's cigarette smoke, or even
&gt; cheap cigar smoke.  (Good cigars are an entirely different matter, of course.)

I haven't studied the legislation so I can't comment on it directly,
but I do agree that nonsmokers (as well as smokers for that matter)
should not have to experience 2nd-hand smoke in public unless they so
elect.  For example, I think smoking on a park bench should be allowed,
but I'm against smoking at the ballpark.  Restaraunts that have smoking
sections should provide real ventilation to keep diners from encountering
smoke.  Of course, the government had better not tell me I can't smoke on
my own property.  Multi-unit dwellings do pose some interesting problems.
I'm thinking of the case where the smoke from one apartment filled another.
I think the responsibility lies with the landlord or condominum association
to provide proper ventilation for all units.  One doesn't want the smell of
burnt food or infrequently maintained litter boxes wafting into your apartment 
from your neighbor's either.

Essentially I consider myself *both* a smoker and a nonsmoker.  I'm a smoker
when I'm smoking (profound, huh?) and a nonsmoker the rest of the day.
I want to choose when I have smoke in my face.

&gt; Some of this might be due to the fact that I'm in California, so year
&gt; 'round I have the option of stepping outside to enjoy my pipe/cigar...

The late evenings in Massachusetts this spring and summer have been delightful
times to sit on my front porch smoking my cigar.  I suspect my frequency of
smoking will go down in the winter, since it just won't be enjoyable then.
There is no way I'm going to subject my cigarette-addicted wife (she's been

Hi Steve, and other Digest Readers;

I am a 45 year old non-traditional college student who returned to academia 
for a Ph. D.  I returned with a lot of experiences under my belt, not the 
least of which is the pleasuable use of tobacco in many forms.  I enjoy the 
pipe, the cigar, and the flavor of a good high-burley hand-rolled cigarette.

I like good English briars (Wilmers for those who may know of this 
wonderful old maker who no longer exports to the US), Charatans, and an 
ocassional Dunhill (although overpriced, still a very good smoke).

I find my smoke unwelcome on most of the campus, so I feel great about 
using my e-mail access to talk smoke.  Thanks for the opportunity to 
participate in this group.

&gt; What I had was a Dunhill Altamiras from the "Harvest Crop 1987" and
&gt; the cigar states "Aged Cigar". My impression was very good, it was
&gt; a fairly mild cigar, which suits me fine and although it does not
&gt; state the origin of the tobacco, I reckon on Cuban for two
&gt; reasons:
&gt;         1. It reminded me (a lot) of a Romeo y Julietta (yum!),
&gt;            the flavour was more even and, I suppose, mature.
&gt; 
&gt;         2. It cost six pounds (about 9 dollars).

They are great cigars, in fact one of my favorite.  They are readily 
available in the US and are made in the Dominican Republic, not Cuba.

Hi.  Here's a sort of contribution for the digest, if you
don't feel it's too far off topic:

Somebody said reason 9 of 10 for smoking was, "it's not as
stupid as lottery tickets."  Well, I won't argue the
comparison, but I'd like to tell you about my favourite
customer (I manage the online games for Ontario Lottery):

Here's a guy (he really exists, this isn't made up!) who
spends $2 on an instant ticket (the scratch sort) and a bit
more on a six-pack.  He takes the both of them home.  He's
a pipe smoker, this fellow -- that's not in the story I
heard, but he's gotta be -- just wait, you'll see why I
think so.
So he sits down and pops a bottle cap, lights up (if I'm
right) and scratches the first number.  There are six
numbers; find three the same, win that amount.  This guy
scratches one number.
Puff, puff... Glug... let's see, $500.  Now, suppose I had
$500 to spend; no need to save any of it, it's a windfall.
What would I do with that?
Twenty or thirty minutes later, the bowl's getting low and
so's the bottle.  Peace has descended.  Our friend's also
running low on ideas as to how to spend $500.  Pop the next
bottle top and let's scratch another -- hey, $10,000!  Boy,
I bet I can think of a good few fun ways to spend that!

Well, you get the idea.  By the time all six numbers have
seen the light of day, it's three hours later, maybe three
or four bottles too, and one or two bowls of a good blend.
For the two bucks and half the price of a six-pack, here's
three hours of quiet cheer.  Does it matter that the ticket
didn't really win anything?

We lottery folks aren't in business to give away money; we
sell entertainment.  If you buy lottery tickets to make a
living, sure that's stupid.  But don't go and crap on the
people who know it's as inexpensive a form of fun as the
market offers, so long as you don't get your hopes too
high.  And hey, SOMEbody's gotta win...

&gt; Re: Proposed Smoking Legislation
 &gt; I've been smoking cigars and pipes since I was sixteen, and I've
 &gt; got to say that I'm in favor of this legislation.  If the people
 &gt; around me when I'm in public don't want to breath my smoke, then
 &gt; I think they have that right.  I know that I don't want to breath
 &gt; anyone else's cigarette smoke, or even cheap cigar smoke.
 &gt; (Good cigars are an entirely different matter, of course.)
 
But then, the FDA, and other politicians including the EPA, do not
 make any distinction between cheap cigars or any other type.
 
&gt; Some of this might be due to the fact that I'm in California, so
 &gt; year 'round I have the option of stepping outside to enjoy my
 &gt; pipe/cigar...
 
&gt; If smoking was as non-intrusive as chewing gum, then I'd think this
 &gt; is outrageous.  It's not.  If they were coming into my house and
 &gt; telling me what to do, I'd be offended, but they're not.
 
They are telling businesspeople what to do.  Two places I do business
 with have signs up.  The first place is a hoagi shop.  He has tables
 to eat at.  There is a sign, saying that there is no non smoking areas
 in the establishment.  The other place, a rib house, has a sign on the
 door saying, "non smokers are welcome too"
 
Some women, and men, wear scents which are very annoying to me.  Not
 just annoying, but if strong enough, trigger a case of bronchetis in
 me.  There are no laws against that.
 
The so-called health hazard, might be greatly reduced, if the EPA, and
 other politicians would clean up the air and water we ingest.  If
 nobody ever got lung cancer, that did not smoke, then I would say they
 have a case.  But, I am sure we all know people who never smoked, and
 died of lung cancer, just the same.  And, we all know people who
 smoked heavily, and died at a very old age.  My grandfather was 94
 years old, and had smoked heavily for more than 60 years.  He did not
 die of lung cancer.  Nor did he have COPD.
 
Air is not a good substance for the body to ingest.  Necessary, but if
 you had it tested, you would be surprised at the amount of toxic stuff
 in it.  That probably has more to do with health problems, than
 anything else the politicians are trying to pass laws against, thus
 giving the Mafia new lines of business.
 
Trucks give off many more times the amount of toxic substances that
 smokers do, yet, they roll all over the country.  Apparently, money is
 more important than health in this case.  Well, when smoking becomes
 too expensive for the average joe to do, money will be more important
 than also.  If we all did give up smoking, where will the taxes come
 from?  Who will make up the billions of dollars the federal and state
 governments steal from us.  And, by the way, since we smokers do pay
 those taxes, and non smokers do not, I figure we have more say in
 congress than they do.  Congress has not seen that yet, but they will.
 
I have never had any problems with pipe smoke, cigar smoke, even the
 cheapies, or for that matter cigarette smoke, as I have had with
 obnoxious perfumes.
 &gt; I think the point I'm trying to make is that smokers risk the
 &gt; health of other people.  (I think with recent secondhand smoke
 &gt; studies, this is not too much of a debatable fact.)
 
Those are not reliable studies at all.  EPA is not concerned with
 accuracy, only in presenting their own side.  And, they also wish the
 spotlight of the public, shifted elsewhere, not on them.  One of my
 employers, a polluter, simply paid a "donation" each year, and was not
 bothered by EPA or anyone else.
 
Countries with much more relaxed attitudes about smoking, should be
 showing higher rates of cancer than we do.  I do not think they are.
 
 
&gt; Even if they're not risking the health, certain people simply
 &gt; don't enjoy inhaling other people's smoke.  (Count me as one of
 &gt; those, when it comes to cigarettes.)  So _smokers_ are the ones
 &gt; who infringe on the non-smokers rights when they're put together.
 &gt; I think I'm on the other side of it as you:  I'm all in favor of
 &gt; smokers having places where everyone smokes.  But when you're in a
 &gt; place where you share the air, the non-smoker has to win out.
 
Yes, but only when the non smokers pay the same amount of taxes, as
 the smokers do.  I am tired of being treated as a second class
 citizen.  Especially since I pay a good deal more taxes than non
 smokers do.

For those on this list, if you want to know how far the antismoking zealots
have gone, note that all government buildings in DC have been made
smokeless--not even any smokers' havens. I work in the Washington Navy Yard,
and smoking is not only forbidden in all the buildings, but you cannot walk
about in the open air smoking. There are several smoking oases which have been
set aside and so, if you want a smoke, you leave the building and head for one
of these zones. Of course, in doing so you are away from your desk and I am
surprised that "they" have not insisted on the employees taking "smoking leave
time" which will be deducted from the leave time each employee has on the
books. By the way, heads (restrooms) are no smoking areas also. By the way,
Steve, I would like some of the early digests with lists of vendors of smokers'
supplies (pipes, tobacco, cigars). I believe that I sent you the names and
locations of my two favorite tobaccanists, but have not seen them in any of the
digests. They are Fader's, whose home base is Baltimore, but has a store also
in Annapolis which I patronize. They have a great mixture in Barrister, which
is mild but also has a touch of latakia and perique. The other tobaccanist is
The Smoke Shop on Maryland Avenue in Annapolis. It has a great assortment of
pipes and tobaccos. The one of theirs I particularly like is Black and Gold.

&gt;&gt;If the people around me when I'm in public don't want to breath my
&gt;&gt;smoke, then I think they have that right.  I know that I don't want
&gt;&gt;to breath anyone else's cigarette smoke, or even cheap cigar smoke.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;But the proposal goes farther than that. It also says that you can't
&gt;&gt;go to _any_ indoor place and light up. You couldn't even run a private
&gt;&gt;club for smokers only.
&gt;
&gt;I agree that you should be able to open a club for smokers, and hire
&gt;employees who realize that they'll be around smoke, and agree to it.  But
&gt;if you're just renting out a place for a night (wedding, etc), then you're
&gt;asking that the employees of the place all have to be exposed to smoke,
&gt;whether they like it or not.  If you make lead paint, you can tell
&gt;employees that part of the job is being exposed to it, but you don't have
&gt;the right to go paint any room that you rent, to use a clumsy analogy.
&gt;
&gt;I think the point I'm trying to make is that smokers risk the health of
&gt;other people.  (I think with recent secondhand smoke studies, this is not
&gt;too much of a debatable fact.)  Even if they're not risking the health,
&gt;certain people simply don't enjoy inhaling other people's smoke.

When you're talking about cigarettes whose papers are bleached w/
assorted chemicals like dioxane, studies have always reported
hazards.  I have not seen ANY study in the last 20 years on
unbleached cigarettes, cigars or pipes either pro or con.  [If
anyone out there can provide a reference, source, etc. I would be most
appreciative!]

As far as locations for smoking, I think that's where early smokers
went overboard.  As a rite of passage, people treated it as a right
instead of a privilege.  I avoid smoking around people at work or
in public when I know it offends them.  On the other hand you should
expect me to be smoking if you visit me in my own home.

In that respect the lead analogy was excellent.  Many of the things
I do at work involve hazards, but I know and accept the risks.  We
don't allow visitors to wander into the area where they might be
exposed to such hazards, nor have we disposed of all such chemicals
simply because they are hazardous.  Why should smoking be any
different?

The other extension of this analogy is warning labels.  We are
required by Federal Law (29CFR1910) to communicate the hazards inside
a container w/ a warning label.  We are also required to have
complete information on each of these items in the form of a Material
Safety Data Sheet (MSDS).  Recent legal actions are trying to
discount the same type of warning printed on cigarette packages.
[And I note that I have never seen such a warning on my pipe tobacco
or on a cigar.]  How will the effect other industries that utilize
warning labels?  All I'm asking for is consistancy.

Query?  Why are all the people who smoke pipes either people who care little
about their pipes (buy fairly cheap pipes, knock them out on the curb and
mangle the bowl) or obsessed with the minutia, able to relate the history of
each of their pipes and, like Joachim in the latest issue, planning to visit
pipe shops in new cities when they travel?   I confess to be in the latter

Thanks for the description of the tradition of pipes at Yale.  When I
was at the Owl Shop in New Haven in April, I saw one of the old pipes
with the inlaid Y and class year, and wondered about its origin:
whether members of a club received them at graduation, whether they
were a limited edition each year or what.  You solved the mystery.

I knew Ehrlichs and Leavitt &amp; Pierce long before I found the Owl Shop
in Worcester and then New Haven.  Perhaps the reference to being the
oldest refers to their blending on the premises rather than having
their blends made by others.  In that regard, I would think Perretti's
would give them a run for their money if they were founded in 1934.  A
best I know only the Owl Shops and Perretti still mix on the premises
in the New England area.  Am I missing anyone of which you know?

	I have just joined the mailgroup. As an introduction: I am 35 years
old and have been smoking good cigars for a few months and a pipe off
and on for several years. My regular cigars are the Baccarat Churchill
and Platinum and the Cuba Aliados Fuma. I enjoy trying others. I only
smoke pipes occasionally. I am beginning to think that I'm not really
going to feel that attachment to a pipe util I create my own, so I am
interested in more info about pipe making. 

	To the gentleman coming to Charlotte for a few days, there are few
choices here in the city, but here they are. 
	1. Tinder Box at Eastland Mall, at SouthPark Mall, and at Carolina
Place Mall. Typical mall tobacco and gift shop. If you've seen one,
you've seen the mall. ;-)
	2. The Humidor Tobacco Shop, 316 Overstreet Mall in "Uptown"
Charlotte. The only tobacco shop downtown (only we say "Uptown" in
Charlotte). I'm told it is small, but I haven't been to this one. This
is near "the Square" which is not a square, just the intersection of
Trade Street and Tryon Street.
	3. McCranie's Pipe Shop, Park Road Shopping Center. I have gotten
incorrect info on cigars here, but I can't evaluate their pipe
knowledge. Expensive; this is a reflection of its character. 

	If you want to save money, you want to go to JR Tobacco. It's about
45 minutes from downtown. Drive north on I-77 to exit 50. It is right
there; you can't miss it. They have a large selection of discounted
tobacco products and accessories, including pipes. They sell the Black &amp;
Mild pouch *six-pack* for $9.35. :-)

	While your here, stop at Dundee's for dinner (Independence Blvd at
Sharon Amity). It is a casual, distinctly American faux Australian place
with a bar, and you can smoke your pipe or cigar there.

Hi, Steve!

You've probably gotten a lot of responses to Jeff (in the last
digest).  Well, here's another one, include it in the next digest if
you like.  I suppose I shouldn't find it surprising that a person who
professes to enjoy smoking would aid and abet the regulators, but oh
well. . . .

See ya  \\JR

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeff, will all due respect -- I don't think you've fully thought out
your arguments.  The problem with the proposed smoking legislation is
twofold:

1.  It *is* indeed largely based, as Steve points out, in
axe-grinding.  There's more interest in "bashing the tobacco
companies" than in health issues.

2.  Potentially the worst problem: it never ends.  I also live in
California and if I've noticed anything, it's that when the public
do-gooders get their teeth into something, they never let go.  You
mentioned that " . . . If they were coming into my house and telling
me what to do, I'd be offended, but they're not.".  Well, guess what
-- they are!  It's now being said that people who live, for example,
in apartment buildings should not be allowed to smoke in their own
rooms because the smoke could travel up or down into other people's
rooms.  Nonsense of course, but this is *what people believe*.

As you can tell I feel quite strongly about this.  The reports on
"secondhand smoke" are largely spurious; the reports on smoking itself
are largely spurious; time and precious resources are being wasted on
a non-problem.  If you continue to lend your tacit support to the
"other side", the day will soon come when you won't even be able "to
step outside and enjoy your cigar or pipe".  I don't smoke when or
where it's inappropriate, but, as a free person, I shall smoke where
it *is* appropriate!  And, in California, I *have* been hassled while
smoking outside in the open air.  Please think about it and don't give
up your freedoms quite so cavalierly.

&gt; it *is* appropriate!  And, in California, I *have* been hassled while
&gt; smoking outside in the open air.  Please think about it and don't give
&gt; up your freedoms quite so cavalierly.
&gt; 
I don't know where in California Joe lives, but here in Santa Barbara,
I've beenhassled for smoking in my _car_.  The lady was following me
for about 5 or 6 miles before whe finally passed me and held her nose
and made some stupid face.  I was hoping she would pull up to me again
after she passed so I could offer her a cigar.

Jeff "The Traitor" Lowell checking in. ;)

Rather than try to answer everything, I'll just thank those who agreed with
me, and post a general clarification to others.

I think there are two extremes of thought here, and like most polarizing
debates, people on both extremes are worried that any compromise will
ultimately mean the utter erosion of their rights.

Well, I'm all for compromise, and I sincerely believe that it won't spell
the end of smoking as we know it.  I should be able to smoke outside and in
the privacy of my own home, at the very least.  Some people say that
they've been hassled while smoking outside... well, I've been hassled for a
lot of things that are my right to do, and I simply stand up for myself.
(Memorize a few of the snappy comebacks at the end of every digest.)  If
legislation was introduced that banned me from smoking outside, I would
fight it... however, I really do not believe such legislation will ever be
introduced.

The question of smoking in the house, specifically an apartment, is a
trickier one.  I would fight legislation that said I couldn't smoke in an
apartment, but if someone complained about it in the absence of
legislation... well, the only way someone could know if I were smoking in
my house is if they could smell the smoke.  So, if someone _did_ complain,
I would try to keep my smoke from getting to them, so they had nothing to
complain about.

This actually happened to me at work:  my office is near the intake vent
for the air conditioning.  All winter, I smoked with no problems.  But come
summer, when I smoked, the people in other offices complained about the
smell of my cigars.  Obviously they could smell it -- they wouldn't have
known to complain otherwise.  So, I simply bought a fan for my window
pointed out -- end of complaints.  If I couldn't have stopped the cigar
smell from permeating the building, I wouldn't have liked it, but I would
have respected the other people and stopped smoking.

As Voltaire said, "one must tend one's own garden."  Or something very
close to that -- it's been a few years. ;)

[ Quite a reasonable viewpoint, I'd say, Jeff. And there are no
traitors here; just people with differing opinions. 

But, between our homes and the whole world, there is still some
disputed turf on the issue of where people are allowed to smoke.
Unless the antis are opposed, they will seize it. Personally, I'm of
the libertarian persuasion where this is concerned --- let society do
its own social engineering, and keep the government out of it. -S. ]

	Hi Steve and fellow pipers, just dropping a note to introduce
myself and what I think about smoking.  Im 21 years old and i'm 
currently attending Elgin Community College here in Elgin, IL.
Im a CS Major currently finishing up on an Associates Degree. I
plan on transfering to Winona State, MN next spring.

	Okee enuff of that.  I enjoy smoking very much.  I prefer
nice big fat cigars which last a LONG time.  Currently I like the 
A. Fuente Gran Reserva, it's a fatty so you best watch it!
I have been smoking everything I can {:) for the last few years.
I hope we can get this newsletter/mailinglist ROCKIN! Thanks to 
Steve and all of you, now I have found my destiny!

<a name="5">Subject: Introduction</a>

Steve,
	Thanks for signing me on to the Pipes Digest.  I've received 
several now and would appreciate it if you would send me numbers 1 - 
144.  I am enjoying what I've been reading so far.
	As a new member I'll introduce myself.  I'm 40 and have been
smoking pipes (with occasional forays into cigar and cigarette land)
since I was 17.  I've never been able to afford any really good brand
name pipes but enjoy immensely the few middle of the road pipes and 
a couple of slightly better than middle of the road pipes that I have
been given by friends over the years.  As far as tobacco, I lean towards
the English blends with Wally Franks' "Istanbul" being a favorite.
There are few tobacconists here in Denver and the couple that I 
consider worth a visit are quite a long trip across town.  As a result
I usually mail order most of my tobacco - so I much appreciate your
introductory digest with the list of tobacconists, etc.
	I am somewhat of a pariah in my family since I am the only
one who smokes.  My father used to smoke a pipe but gave it up a 
number of years ago (he and I used to go on long car trips through
the Rockies and I inevitably would get violently car sick with the
combination of his smoke, the altitude and the windy mountain 
roads - so I'm sympathetic to those who don't like second hand 
smoke).  My wife grudingly tolerates my smoking so I try to smoke 
outdoors or in the garage only.  So, as can be imagined, I appreciate
and enjoy this forum very much.
	I'll end with a question:  I was given a rather nicely 
grained pipe a number of years back with the name "Marcini" stamped
on the side and "Italy" on the shank.  I've never seen this make 
mentioned in any pipe literature that I've read.  Can anyone out 
there tell me something about this pipe maker?

[ Nobody here but us pariahs, Chris; welcome! And sorry, never heard
of Marcini. Any others? -S. ]

&gt; Subject: smoking in public
&gt; 
&gt; The other extension of this analogy is warning labels.  We are
&gt; required by Federal Law (29CFR1910) to communicate the hazards inside
&gt; a container w/ a warning label.  We are also required to have
&gt; complete information on each of these items in the form of a Material
&gt; Safety Data Sheet (MSDS).  Recent legal actions are trying to
&gt; discount the same type of warning printed on cigarette packages.
&gt; [And I note that I have never seen such a warning on my pipe tobacco
&gt; or on a cigar.]  How will the effect other industries that utilize
&gt; warning labels?  All I'm asking for is consistancy.

I have seen such a warning on some cigars and pipe tobacco from the 
state of California. I don't have it with me but I believe it was
a warning about possible reproductive harm and/or other health
problems.

Steve,

Thanks for sending me another copy of #148; there seems to be a
learning curve to using this mail reading software correctly.

To anyone who believes that the second-hand smoke studies *might*
have some basis in fact just think back to a decade ago. If you
lived in a big city do you remember garbage incinerators? There was
one in every apartment building here in New York City belching out
enormous volumes of choking smoke at least once a day. Do you
remember early diesel-powered buses and the clouds of noxious fumes
they expelled? Do you remember burning leaves in the autumn?
Everybody in NY at that time lived in an environment full of the 
smoke from incomplete combustion products. Was it good for us? Of 
course it wasn't, but we didn't all choke to death or get lung 
cancer. What person in his/her right mind could believe that an
occasional whiff of tobacco smoke could be *more* damaging than all
that?

I'd like to recommend a cigar store in Brooklyn I go to
occasionally. Walk-in humidor, nice selection of pipe tobaccos,
will special order for you and reasonable prices. The Cigar
Emporium at 1953 86th St. between 19th &amp; 20th Aves ("B" train to
20th Ave).

it ain't even pleasant, like a pipe. And anyway, they'll never let you

teeth... -S.]

Hiya Steve,

Just some news for people in the Pittsburgh area
or those who might pass through:

"Poor Richard's" in Station Square just expanded
their walk-in humidor by about 45%. I don't know
if they really increased their stock by much, but
it's certainly much easier to walk around in. It's
much more of a 'walk-in' now, instead of a 'shuffle
in.'

Of course, they had to lose some room from the darts
area for the expansion, but I suppose some sacrifices
must be made.

?????@???.???

So you want to smoke a pipe.  Here's some basic information to get
you started without looking stupid or getting ripped-off in the
process.  The following is based on my opinions and experience.

Select a decent pipe.

You can spend billions of dollars on pipes. I suggest you try an inexpensive
pipe to start with, and wait a while on buying Merchaum pipes and mershaum
lined bowls.  

Best first pipe.

        Buy a simple pipe, the most traditional looking pipe you can find.
  If you drive down the street smoking a Sherlock Holmes pipe you're going
  to look pretty silly.  Pipes that have filters are really just frills.
  If the store can't sell you a half-way decent looking respectable pipe
  for under 12 bucks, go someplace else.  Look for a pipe like an old
  man would smoke.  Old men know pipes.

         Later on, if you want something better, look for a Merchaum
  lined pipe. It looks like a regular pipe, but the bowl is lined with
  white ceramic stuff.  Good merchaum comes from Africa. It's some type
  of hard clay.  If you want the ultimate, you can find some really wild
  pipes carved entirely from mershaum with some wild figureines and
  monsters carved into them.  Corn cob pipes burn though.  Get the most
  ordinary looking tobacco pipe for your first pipe.

Best pipe lighter.

        Despite advertisers claims, the best pipe lighter is a simple
  disposable gas lighter.  Zippo's don't work good at all for pipes and
  smell and leak. Zippo's modified for pipes are okay, but they get hot
  since you need to light a pipe more than a cigarette and have a tendency
  to continue to burn while they're in your pocket.  Just a simple Bic
  or other disposable gas lighter is really the best.  Fancy lighters that
  require refilling are junk, and although they look cool, they rarely
  last more than 3 days before they break.  Matches make a mess and
  will irritate your throat even though you don't want to inhale a pipe
  ever!

Best Ash Tray

        A big one. When you smoke a pipe, a small amount of tobacco is
  always wasted and gets dumped into the ash try.

Best Tobacco dealers

        Here's the most valuable advice in this text.  The tinder box
  sells old shitty tobacco that has God knows what in it.  The stuff
  they sell at the drug store on supermarket has all the quality of
  smoking the sunday funny papers.  Tinder box tobacco looks like 
  a tobacco chewing baseball team, ate tobacco, and shit it out, and then
  sold it to the tinder box.  Then they wiped their ass with the sunday
  funnies and sold that to the grocery and drug stores as tobacco.

        The best place to buy tobacco is from a speciality tobacco dealer
  that is not part of a chain.  They are called "Tobacconists", and you
  can find them in the yellow pages.  Avoid malls, although there are
  good tobacconists at some malls.  

        There are 3 basic types of tobacco and thousand of blends. Pipe
  tobacco is made from Burley tobacco.  Cigarettes are made from blonde
  or Virginia tobacco.  These are the basic kinds you should know about. 
  The naming of blends makes it all confusing. Don't be confused. This
  is the strait stuff you need to ask for.

        1. Burley flavored with Cherry.
             This SMELLS the best when it burns.
         
        2. Burley flavored with Vanilla.
             This TASTES the best when it burns.

        3. Cabendish or English tobacco.
             This stuff is black. Unlike Burley tobaccos which are
             a brown color, Cabendish looks like it's been in a
             smoker for a couple weeks black and smells like
             burnt coals.  Has a unique taste, but gives me a headache.
             You should try this one though because it's a historic
             tobacco you might enjoy.

        4. Other stuff that's less common but probably pretty good.     

	There are THOUSANDs of variations mixtures and blends of these
     basic types of tobaccos.  Apple, and other flavors are very common
     and interesting also but always buy from a reputable specialty
     tobacconist.

Best Experimental Selection.

        Ask for a very small amount of the following to get a really
     good idea or what you like or don't like.   

    1)    packet of plain burley with a slight vanilla flavor

    2)    packet of plain burley with a slight cherry flavor

    3)    packet of a mixture of cherry/vanilla burley

    4)    packet of a mixture containing some cabendish (black-english)

      ask them for a suggestion of what's good too unless they are a
      cigarette smoker since they can't smell or taste anything anyway.

Best place to enjoy smoking a pipe

        Fill the bowl full and compress the tobacco lightly. You don't
      need any fancy tools either.  A pen knife sometimes helps loosen
      the unsmoked bowl left over from last night.  A properly packed bowl
      when it's been smoked up, can be emptied by tapping the bowl
      on something several times. If the unsmoked tobacco comes out 
      immediately, it's packed too loose, and if it requires a tool to
      remove, it's packed too tight.

        Never inhale pipe tobacco.  The life you save may be your own.
      Be aware though that all that tobacco going up in smoke right next
      to your face, will definitely give you a pretty decent buzz. The
      proper mental state is somewhere between a light buzz and nausea.
      Never hold the bowl higher than your lips. The tobacco spit might
      find its way back into your mouth. UCK!

        Smoking outside at night is the most relaxing for me anyway. This
      way you can spit if you feel like it and the smoke looks cool as it
      curls away and doesn't smell up the room.

Tobacco Pouches

        Special pouches are a waste of money. Like the invention of the
      disposable lighter, the invention of the zip lock bag has made
      all other containers obsolete.

        When you seal a zip lock bag for the first time, with your teeth,
      make tiny tears in the sides of the bag near the zip lock. This will
      allow you to force the air out of the bag when you seal it.

Make your room or car smell good

        Leave a bag of cherry tobacco in your living room, automobile
      etc.  Even in the zip lock baggie (tear the edges so you can force
      the air out).  It will make it smell really good.  When you walk
      into a home of a pipe smoker, it's the unsmoked tobacco that gives
      that wonderful aroma, not the actual smoking.

SMOKE IF YOU GOT 'EM.

Enjoy.

<a name="4">Subject: Tobacco Recipes</a>

Hey I want to make my own pipe tobacco blends. What is the best stuff
to flavor plain old burley tobacco with and what's the best way to do
it?  Somebody suggested soaking it in bourbon. Is this good or not?
What do they use to flavor Cherry and Vanilla. Is it Cherry juice and
Vanilla extract, or is it some far out chemical? And how do they get
Cabendish tobacco to look burned like that?

[ I'd suspect vanilla extract for the vanilla, and maybe cherry flavor
for the cherry. Probably nothing more awful than, say, your average
Coca-Cola. I believe the Cavendish is fermented slightly. Anyone know
for sure? -S. ]

Was learning to use a periodicals database and decided to do something
useful and generate a listing of cigar/pipe/tobacco related magazines.
I cleaned it up a bit, and deleted some selections that didnt look too
relevant. Thought it might be of interest.

  I will be traveling with my wife to Tobacco growing country
(Virginia, North Carolina, etc.) this Fall (late September/early
October) and was wondering if anyone knows of any good tours/places to
visit?
  I smoke both pipes and cigars and would be interested in learning
more about tobacco production especially for pipe/cigar use (rather
than cigarette use).
  Also, is there any good cigar manufacturing done in the area (I know
about Florida, but will not be going that far South).  Thanks, steve

Steve,

They get quite backed up sometimes; I have waited a couple of months for
repairs at times. Lately I've been sending my repairs to S &amp; R Woodcrafts in
Columbus, OH. I've also been buying more of their pipes; they have a wide
selection and are quite creative.

Now pleasure...(smoking my Elliot Nachwalter freehand)

I have avoided jumping in to the smoking bill debate because I think it could
easily become a bottomless pit that would preempt the discussion of the
pleasures of smoking that I subscribe to the list for. One of my principal
reasons for subscribing was the promise of no flames (other than to light a
smoke with).

That said, Jeff Lowell in #149 expresses my feelings on the subject well. I
would go slightly further to say that there are times I feel I need
protection from a few inconsiderate smokers. I had to clean over 150 butts
out of my hedge last week; there were also 20 empty cigarette packs, a dozen
empty match books, etc. (I shouldn't single out smokers; there were also 10
coffee cups, 8 cans, and 2 bags of Burger King trash.) I DON'T like 2nd hand
cigarette smoke (nothing to do with health; I just don't like it). When I
want to smoke, I ask first if it will bother anyone. I would like other
smokers to extend the same courtesy to me. I think much of the impetus for
this bill is the smoking slob, not the members of this list. A little
compromise would go a long way to defuse the issue.

Larry

Smoke it peace...

[ Thanks for the address, Larry! And, yes, we all at times have slobs
to be annoyed at. However, regarding compromise, recall the tale of
the camel, who only wanted to put his nose under the door of the
tent... if it keeps on, one may not even be allowed to posess Camels,
or MacBaren's or Macunados, in one's own home. -S. ]

<a name="8">Subject: RE: Your Pipes Digest subscription request</a>

Thanks for placing me on the mailing!  I am looking forward to being 
part of the forum!

I have been a avid pipe smoker since I was 18.  I have worked on a off 
in tobacco shops for fun during the past 13 years and am currently 
working at the Up Down Tobacco Shop in Chicago one night a week for the 
past few years.  The owner is a great lady, (At one point she was the 
president of the Retail Tobacco Dealers of America - RTDA) and since I 
work there, she gives me a great deal on pipes.  She has personal 
relationships with most of the manufacturers and as a result, gets some 
extraordinary pipes.  If ever your members are in Chicago, they should 
come by for a visit.  My favorite pipes are Ser Jacopo, Upshall, 
Dunhill, and Ashton, but enjoy all high grade briars.  I have a small 
collection of 40-50 high grade pipes.

I am also a cigar smoker and was the founding president and current 
vice president of the Chicago Cigar Connoisseurs - a 250-300 member 
group in Chicago.  I believe we are the largest cigar group in the 
Chicago area.  We hold smokers dinners and event 3 to 4 times a year.  
Because of the owners position in the tobacco industry, we have had 
almost every major vendor come to the dinners to discuss and hand out 
samples of their cigars.  In fact, anyone in town the first week in 
November should stop by for our 3 Day Cigar Party for a free cigar and 
cocktails.  This year, Dunhill will be the featured cigar and will be 
providing a speaker.  My favorite cigars are the Jamaican Royal 
Jamaican Cabinet Selection and the Ashton Maduro in any size.

[ Great to hear from you, John! I hope some of our members around
Chicago will check out the CCC. (And later...) ]

re: Tours in NC. There are a number of cigarette factories in
Winston-Salem and Richmond(Va) that offer tours of their manufacturing
plants. There is a small tobacco museum out side Kenly NC(I-95) which
will give you some idea of the far ming aspects of the plant. For pure
enjoyment (incl. smell) you might visit our of the local nc tobacco
auctions. The market open yesterday (7/21) on the Eastern
Belt. Wilson, Rocky Mt, Greenville are in the center of the the bright
leaf tobacco belt. Some good places to visit and you can see the
plants growing in the fields and the harvesting taking place. Pipe and
Cigar tobacco is (burley) grown I think in Kentucky and places like
central america and the conn. river v aley not nc and va. Have a nice
trip.

<a name="3">Subject: General questions</a>

     I have a bunch of questions that I hope some readers could help me with.
 Recently I went to a tobacconist in the area that was selling old estate
pipes (a Tinder Box in the mall, if you can believe that).  I happened to
come across a very unusually shaoed pipe that sort fo looks like an old
powder horn for a musket.  Smaller that that obviously but that shape.  It
was made in France by Claude Romain.  Has anyone ever heard of this brand?
 Also, what exactly do they do to clean estate pipes?  The guy mumbled
something about "boiling" the pipe in wax or something like that.  It didnt'
really matter to me becauseI liked the way it looked and it was only $20.00
so I figured What the Hell and bought it.  When I loaded the pipe and smoked
it however (with a blend whose flaover I was familiar with) it tasted REALLY
different.  Not bad, just really different.  I figured whoever the sod was
who owned this pipe smoked some English blends or something.  My question is
that with estate pipes or any pipe, how long does it take for the old taste
of previous tobacco to go out of the bowl.  Should I season the bowl with
brandy or just clean it out with alcohol, or just keep stubbornbly smoking it
until it tastes the way it should.
  One more thing.  At the Cincinnati Tobacconist the other day I was told to
pick up a tin of tobacco called "Bengal Slices" (having also read about it in
the Pipe Smokers Ephemeris) .  So I did.  I did not realize that it was
pressed into cakes (I guess I should have figured that by the name, eh?).
 How do you smoke these?  I like the way it smells in the tin, but I don't
know if I just crumble it into the bowl, or shred it with a knife first, or
even mix it with another tobacco to smoke it.  What do I need to do?
     Does anyone have any information about mixing/blending one's own
tobacco?  It sounds interesting, and I have a few blends that while they
aren't great by themselves, if mixed I think they would taste much better.
 But I heard somewhere that they had to be "married" together somehow.  Any
clues?
  I mentioned in a previous issue about a book on Smoking and Society that
attempts to give a balanced view on the smoking controversy.  I have found a
place that has a few more copies available if anyone wants a copy, let me
know.  Only two people asked last time, so I figured everyone may not have
read about it.  If interested let me know and I could get a copy sent to you
for about $8.00 or so.

Hi, Steve;

(Posting 2 weeks in a row for me is a first!)

Many thanks to Tom for his TEXT FILE ABOUT PIPE SMOKING. I really enjoyed it.
While there may be things to debate in it, I'm not going to, because
reasonable people can enjoy their pleasures differently. I did want to point
out one factual issue, however. 

Tom, you refer to "Cavendish or English tobacco".

They are two quite different things. Cavendish is a tobacco flavored with
sugar, Maple, or rum. English tobacco is a blend of unflavored tobaccos (from
an old Brittish law that banned adding anything to tobacco). To add flavor to
tobacco, the English use tobaccos that have strong flavors of their own like
Latakia and Perique. As I recall, Latakia (from Syria) is cured over camel
dung fires, and Perique (from Louisiana) is fermented in its own juice after
pressing. English tobacco is one of the two general types of blended
tobaccos; the other is Aromatic.

Aromatic tobaccos are usually sweet, and can be mild if the flavoring isn't
overpowering. Their "second hand smoke" is frequently appreciated by
non-smokers. English tobaccos tend to have a bitter (but pleasant) taste and
an aroma that non-smokers sometimes find objectionable.

Smoke in peace...

Larry

[ There was some discussion on the camel dung issue a few Digests
back... the resolution was, "not anymore if ever..." -S. ]

<a name="5">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #150 -- July 22, 1994</a>

Comments from a recent contributor caused me to consider pipe lighters. 
I've been smoking pipes regularly for more than twenty years, and I have
used just about every means to ignite them at one time or another, from a
pocket full of wooden kitchen matches -- at twenty-two, it seemed cool to
light them with a thumbnail -- at least until the day the head of a big
old Diamond lodges under the thumbnail and fairly explodes into flame --
to several very elegant pipe lighters given to me as gifts.  Along the
way, I've used book matches, liquid-fuel lighters of the Zippo and other
persuasions, and butane lighters from cheap throwaways to gold lighters
worth more than my first automobile.  I could go on about any of the
various means and methods, but instead I will spare my readers and say
only that I can heartily recommend one particular brand of lighter -- IMCO
G77R. 

This lighter has many virtues -- but basically they all boil down to the
fact that it does the job extremely well and it doesn't cost a nickel more
than it needs to.  The IMCO is Austrian.  It's a refillable plastic butane
lighter made specifically for pipes.  It's adjustable, refillable,
durable, and light.  It doesn't look like junk, but it's not exactly
handsome -- and it won't walk away as I have had some valuable lighters
do.  And if it does, it doesn't represent a week's wages.  I used to buy
them for three bucks; my last one was something like six.  I have enjoyed
a few expensive lighters, but I have come to the point where I don't like
to walk around with anything in my pocket I can't afford to lose.  The
IMCO has a large butane capacity, so even with liberal use it goes weeks
without refilling.  On the other hand, it's light, which is important if
you never get dressed without it in your pocket.  I've had some very
expensive pipe lighters that worked very well but felt like a pair of
brass knuckles in your pants pocket.  The IMCO uses standard flints and
has a place inside to stash a spare one so you never have to drop the
hammer on an empty chamber.  The flame adjusts with a large knurled wheel
on the bottom that, unlike some other lighters, does not require a long
fingernail or a jeweler's screwdriver to adjust.  And even though it's
easy to grasp and turn, the wheel doesn't wander in your pocket.  It stays
adjusted where you leave it.  The adjustment wheel has a clear window so
you can check the butane level.  The butane valve is a standard fitting,
so you can buy cheap butane anywhere to refill it.  This is a humble
instrument -- it's a Timex watch, a Craftsman wrench, a Boston pencil
sharpener.  It won't impress anyone.  The IMCO is just the best tool for
the job that I've found in twenty years of firing pipe tobacco.

Steve,

Remember me, Elias, the first guy ever to suggest a pipes newsgroup.  I'm
sure you do.  How are you ?  After a long period in net-darkness I finally
got back.  I see you are now working at Siemens ( I assume from your
address) so I also assume you got your Phd.  Congrats!

I've been peeking at .pipes and .cigars newsgroups and I am really happy we
are finally getting somewhere.  I've only got back to the net a few weeks
ago so I'm still rusty.  Soon will be more active :-)

Well, I now work for a software company called Uniface which is located in
San Francisco, but since my job is to provide tech support for clients in
South America, I can pretty much live anywhere with an airport.  So I now
live in Wahington DC.  I've been going to Mexico very often, and of course
have enjoyed many Cuban cigars available there.

Well, good to get in touch again.  Please add my name to our good old pipes
mailgroup.

<a name="7">Subject: On Meerschaum Pipes</a>

WHAT IS MEERSCHAUM?

Meerschaum, contrary to popular belief, is not fossilized remains of
sea creatures, but a mineral called Hydrous Magnesium Silicate.
Among other places in the world, it is found from 30 to 450 feet
below the surface of the earth near the town of Eskisehir, Turkey.

WHY MEERSCHAUM IS USED FOR PIPES?

Meerschaum's magnesium content provides strength while the hydrogen
and oxygen contribute porosity. As one of the nature's lightest and
most porous substances, Meerschaum is a natural filter. This natural
absorbency causes the pipe to slowly change color, eventually
turning a rich brown color. In addition to providing you with a
cool, full-flavor smoke, your Meerschaum pipe will provide you with
the esthetic pleasure of watching its color change as it matures.

HOW ARE MEERSCHAUM PIPES MADE?

After being mined, the stone is kept moist until it is carved by
master craftsmen into a standard shape smooth finish pipe, or with
some geometric design, or some figure. The pipe bowl is then
immersed in a solution of molten bees-wax which when absorbed seals
the Meerschaum, providing with an ivory-like glass and contributing
to the eventual coloring process. The pipe is then fitted with
custom-made amberoid stem and hand polished.

HOW TO CARE FOR MEERSCHAUM PIPES?

Unlike briar, Meerschaum does not burn. Hence there is no need to
"break-in" a Meerschaum pipe. But it will smoke cooler and mellowed
with time. Although not as fragile as it appears, Meerschaum will
scratch and care should be given not to drop.

Most of the above is adapted from a small booklet prepared by "SULTAN
Meerschaum Pipes", an excellent shop in Ankara for Meerschaum pipes.

Pardon me if I'm not addressing this correctly.  I'm still new to this
internet mailing list business.

I'm very pleased to subscribe to your list.  It's nice to be
associated with a group of folks who appreciate pipe smoking (as well
as cigar smoking).  In this day and time, such people are few and far
between.  I sure don't get much more than grief from most people I'm
around.

I've been a pipe smoker since I was 18.  I'm now 44.  Things have
changed so much over that time in regard to smoking.  Yes, I
understand the health concerns of many.  I don't personally like to
smell cigarette smoke.  But it seems that the intolerance of all types
of smoking has gotten ridiculous.  At my workplace, there are only two
options for smoking during the day.  One is to go outside.  The other
is to do it in a room with inadequate ventilation.  So, now what used
to be something I did in my office during the day to make work not so
bleak now is a no-no.  With that, my opportunities to smoke are very
limited since my family also gives me crap about it at home.  So I'm
left to smoking in the car to and from work, while sitting on my porch
(not so great in winter), and while working on this and that in my
garage.  I do sneak in a bowl once in a while when the family has gone
to bed!

I used to smoke a few good cigars now and then.  I really enjoyed
them.  Now, though with things they way they are, I have no
opportunities to do so.  I miss them.

I've tried some fairly decent pipes and tobaccos over the years.  Now,
since I've moved to a small town, the options are limited.  So I
pretty much rely on a small stable of old favorite pipes accumulated
over the years and keep a stock of Sir Walter Raleigh (after all, I am
a native North Carolinian).  The good part about smoking less now is
that I've found that even a common tobacco such as Sir Walter tastes
good when it's been a while since you've had a bowl.

Once again, glad to be here.  I look forward to future issues.

[ Thanks for the intro, Stan! And I'm sure that you could find some
opportunities to enjoy your cigars in peace, if you look hard enough.

<a name="9">Subject: Re: In the Mail!</a>

I tried one of the Valverdes almost as soon as they
arrived (which I normally don't do; normally they sit in the
humidor, unwrapped for at least a week).

However, they arrived on our Big Move Day (on which my wife and
I, with the help of 6 other friends, moved all of our junk from
the 10'x30' storage locker into our new home). Although we'd
been living in the house for a couple of weeks prior, we were
and still are, concentrating on cosmetic improvements to the
interior -- painting, stripping cabinets, new kitchen tile, new
vinyl flooring in bathrooms, new fixtures, replacing paneling
with sheetrock, replacing light fixtures, etc.

When the cigars arrived, one of my smoking friends who was
helping us schlepp boxes asked about them. I couldn't not offer
him one, and so I lit up as well. We sat around the edge of
my pickup truck bed puffing away, perfuming the suburban air.
My wife took a puff and proclaimed them acceptable. (The Arturo
Fuente 8-5-8s unfortunately do not pass this test).

I like the Valverdes quite a bit. My tastes range all the way
from mild to very strong, pungent smokes. The Valverdes seem to
fall into the category of mild yet with a lot of flavor. (By
contrast, Macanudos strike me as mild but without as much
flavor). The Valverdes seem very refined with a wonderful aroma.
Easy draw, great flavors, but not overpowering.

I'm currently looking for a strong, oily smoke (in a cigar).
I'm going to try a Te-Amo Palarides (I think that's the name)
in a maduro wrapper and a Hoyo de Monterey in a claro wrapper.
The Honduran and Mexican tobaccos are supposed to be stronger
than the Dominican tobaccos.

BTW, on the subject of pipe tobacco I recently puffed a bowl
of straight Virginia. My! It was reminicent of cigarette
smoke. I understand the Virginia pipe tobacco is press-cured --
pressed into cakes, then sliced and (usually rubbed).

BTBTW,I've heard a lot of things -- mostly neutral to negative --
about tinned tobacco. However, I must say that Dunhill Standard
Mixture Medium turns my crank. (Hm, another Dunhill product;
perhaps they are on my wavelength, or vice versa). Have you
ever tried that blend?

<a name="10">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #150 -- July 22, 1994</a>

I'm sure we'll have some responses about the file on pipe smoking from
the last issue; here are my 2 cents.

I tend to agree that a good first pipe should be inexpensive, but not
quite to the level Tom suggests. When you get into composition pipes,
you're also buying something which will eventually burn through on
you. (This is why I _very_ rarely smoke my first pipe anymore.) I'd
also suggest a small-sized bowl for the first time out; it's a little
easier to handle. (If anyone knows how I can keep my "first love" from
splitting, please let me know.)

I disagree completely with the pipe lighter comment. Every time I've
tried to light a pipe with a normal cigarette lighter, I've burned my
thumb. (Of course, this backs up the Zippo comment.) I think it's
Thompson's that makes a lighter that blows its flame at about a 45
degree angle; no more charred thumbs. It's refillable, and only costs
$3 to $5. Mine's held up quite well; I consider it a good investment.
                
I'll also step up to defend the Tinder Box chain, or at least my local
branch.  I've had very good luck with both pipe sales and tobacco from
them. Of course, my local one is run by one of the "old guys who know
pipes;" the problem with chains is that your milage may vary. Tom's
right on the mark about the drug store garbage, though. You're better
off going without than smoking that.

I expect that new smokers may prefer the sweeter blends to the more
bitter cavendish-types. The most important thing, to me, is to figure
out what you like and _remember the name!_

It also seems to me that biting a zip lock bag kind of defeats the
purpose. If it lets air out, doesn't it let air back in?

Anyway, my 2 cents.

Hi,
I had triple by-pass surgery last summer.  I had, at that time, been a
pipe smoker since 1955.  Prior to the surgery, my cardiologist said to
me, "Give up the pipe".  After the surgery, in a conversation with the
heart surgeon, I mentioned what my cardiologist had said.  The surgeon
said," Pipe smoking is definitely NOT a risk factor for you".

So, I am still smoking pipes and enjoying them as much as I use to.

Hello all of you,

During my very fine holidyas in Ireland, I read during the good
weather some books. One of them was the book 'White goats &amp;
black bees' from Donald Grant, who imigrated during his
retirement from US to Ireland (he was/is a journalist).
He describes the live in the south-western part of Ireland
(Cork), where is living in a small community. From the local
folks overthere he got the advice for smoking a cool pipe: put
a quartz pebble in the bottom of the pipe. According to his
experince this seems to work.

Does anybody else have the experience? Or could someone try it?

All the best,

Old cigar smoke is ghastly, the older the ghastlier. (A three day old butt,
left carelessly lying in the yard, can clear out our entire porch). The
REAL trouble with second hand smoke is that the smoker gets the best part.

My library smells nicely of English pipe tobacco, my cigars get smoked
outside.

&gt; I disagree completely with the pipe lighter comment. Every time I've
&gt; tried to light a pipe with a normal cigarette lighter, I've burned my
&gt; thumb. (Of course, this backs up the Zippo comment.) 

My zippo does fine, it just has the bad habit of going slowly dry even
when I'm not using it.

My favorite pipe lighter is a specialized pen-shaped lighter with adjustable
flame size, perfect for pipes. I've given up the cheap butane lighters.

There's no national standard for taste,

<a name="3">Subject: Meerschaum=sepiolite</a>

Hi Steve,
     I was reading through your most recent digest and came across a blurb
from someone (don't recall who and am not knocking them anyway) who was
trying to explain what meerschaum is and why it so good as bowl material.
I am within a couple months of receiving a master's in geology and clay
minerals are of some interest to me. Yes, meerschaum is a hydrated magnesium
silicate. No, the magnesium doesn't make it strong and the hydrogen and 
oxygen don't make it cool. It is the crystalline structure; the arrangement
of the magnesium, silicon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms in a rigid crystalline
structure that makes sepiolite (the clay mineral that is identified by pipe
smokers as meerschaum) so good for smoking. All minerals have some sort of 
crystal structure. Clay minerals are of a class where the constituent atoms
are all arranged in sheets. If you have ever peeled sheets of mica apart, the
crystalline structure really comes home! Sepiolite is of particular interest
because in addition to the normal clay arrangement of sheets of atoms stacked 
up one atop the other, there are holes in each sheet that line up to allow the
formation of channels/tunnels at right angles to the sheets. It is the presence
of these submicroscopic (roughly 10 angstroms or so across) tunnels that allows
draw literally through the bowl material and so keeps a cool pipe. Smoke cigars
myself.              Smoke cheerfully,
                            Mike Leschin

The comments about health effects of pipe smoking are of great
interest to me.  One of the reasons I was interested in joining this
group was to find out if any of you have information about pipes and
health.  Some years ago after taking a stress test for a physical, I
was talking to the doctor, a heart specialist, about the results.  I
mentioned that I was a pipe smoker and asked his thoughts on that.  He
said that given the psychological benefits derived from pipe smoking,
he suggested that I would be no better off if I quit.  I now wish I
had gotten into a more detailed discussion, but I didn't.

I have never seen anything written on this subject but would
appreciate a summary of anything you all may have seen or heard.  I
would like to pass along any good news to my wife, who thinks pipe
smoking is no different from cigarette smoking.

[ Thanks for the anecdote, Stan! There seems to have been some
interest in this topis on alt.smokers.pipes this week, too. -S. ]

I realized that I did not get the resource guided quoted in the digest
so far. Would you please mail me a copy of it?

What sort of addresses does it consist of? If you want to include
shops in germany as well, here is one:

	Pfeifen Archiv
	Calwer Passage
	70173 Stuttgart, Germany
	Phone: (++49) (0)711-290701

It is worth seeing: a small shop with sort of a post-modern architecture
inside. Not quite cheap: their pipes start at around 150 US$. Excellent
(but small) choice of pipe tobaccos plus cigars.

	Joachim.

PS: Btw, thanks for maintaining the digest -- your are doing a good job!

[ Thanks! Pfeifen Archiv added. Hope you got the Guide OK! -S. ]

Re: after the first pipe:
My first pipe was a Falcon. It looks like something a liberal minded
proffessor might have smoked in the 60's. ( looks like you might be smoking
more than just tobacco in it ). It has a regular bit, but two metal pieces in
place of the shaft of the pipe, and one metal tube in the middle ( crimped to
create a pattern ) for drawing thew smoke thru. It has a wooden bowl that
screws on ( YUP!)  and different bowls can be purchased that all fit the
shaft. ( other shafts can be bought also in straight or bent. The metal
bottom it screws onto has a bowl ( trade named " the humidome " ) to catch
any moisture from the bowl. This is , without question, and despite it's
looks ) the BEST, and COOLEST SMOKING, pipe I own!!!   ( and I'm a guy with a
savinelli, and a Comoys among others. )  I got mine at Tinder Box ( no longer
sell them ).. and I couldn't even give you a clue as to where to find one (
they're made in England)  If you want to know the best pipe to get AFTER you
buy that cheap starter pipe... I ( humbly? ) recommend Falcon. :-)

	Hey the Bengal Slices are AWESOME!  Is this the stuff smoked over 
Camel crap?  It reminds me of smoking hash (in a former life of course). 
Has a similiar aroma, and taste.  It burns a long time too.  I think it's 
well worth 5 bucks for a tin of the stuff. 
	
	b.t.w. All you pipe smokers are cool dudes! I've posted on 
various nets and boards and newsgroups and when you say something 
somebody doesn't agree with 100% they go ballastic.  But you guys are 
totally cool.  You all just light your pipe, thinking deeply and 
intelligently about the issue and then offer constructive criticism, real 
facts, and it's just nice to get mail from people who know how to treat 
others with respect. Nobody here has even come close to ragging about 
anything.

	I got some really good feed back and really learned a lot from 
everybody who replied after I posted my text file about smoking pipes.
I thank you all, the information was good to learn, and the conversation 
invigorating and though provoking.  

	Why can't I find a Newsgroup for pipe smoking? There's one for 
cigars and they get PISSED if you mention smoking a pipe is better (and 
cheaper too) that really gets them mad!  I can smoke a pipe constantly 
for two weeks for the cost of a good cigar! And it smells better too that 
the cigar!

[ There is alt.smokers.pipes, which doesn't have as much traffic as
.cigars, but seems to be fairly well distributed now. If you ask your
sysadmin nicely, he might put it on for you... :-) Good luck, and
thanks from all of us! -S. ]

Steve,

It was too many weeks ago when I persuaded you to send me all of the
back issues of the newsletter in exchange for a report on the pipe
swap/show in Boston.  Thanks for the back issues, which I have now
read through from the earliest days of the newsletter up through this
weeks edition which arrived tonight.  My hat is off to you for all the
great effort you have put into keeping this group together and going.
Now the belated report and some thoughts on some of the recent topics
passing by.

Boston Massachusetts Pipe Show/Swap

Bob Hamlin and Nikos Levin came to the Boston area for a swap meet/
pipe show, chance to meet and see people in late June.  Bob is the
President of the Pipe Collectors Club of America, based in Virginia.
Nikos Levin is the son of Barry Levin, who passed away this spring
after introducing many of us to the world collector/estate pipes.
Barry ran Levin Pipes International from Vermont producing wonderful
catalogues about once a month of used/estate pipes.  Nikos had struck
out on his own last year, and has now taken over the business his dad
left behind.

The show took place at the Marriot in Westboro, about thirty miles
west of Boston on Route 9. From materials I have seen in the Pipe
Smokers Ephemeris, and other places, I think this is the site of one
of the original shows/swap meets.  Bob and Nikos had rented one of the
smaller conference rooms o the second floor (right next to a sign
indicating the floor was a non smoking floor, a fact no one in the
room seemed to notice or care about) where they laid out several
tables of their pipes.  Bob seems to go in for the Italian pipes, as
well as Dunhills and Ashtons.  From looking them over, they were for
the serious collector, whether they were new or used.  Prices of the
new items were thirty or more percent off what a normal retail outlet
would offer them for, while used was fifty percent or so.  They used
pipes had been restored so that one could hardly tell they had
provided enjoyment to their first owner.  Very little in the way of
cake, teeth marks, dents or other flaws.  Most were well beyond what I
was prepared to part with, there were some flawless straight grains in
the $400-600 range.  Beautiful to look at, marvelous to hold, too dear
for this man.  Nikos offerings also ran toward the Italians, but he
had a number of older Charatons, Upshalls and the like.  I swapped him
a carved Upshall I had bought from his catalogue a few weeks earlier
which, when it arrived, did nothing for me in the flesh, for another
carved Upshall he had with him that day.  No questions, no fuss.

I offered Nikos a chance to look at some of my collection (things I
bought and thought I would like, but which never gave the satisfaction
I thought they would) He offered to take them off my hands, leaving me
with one he had no use for, at a fairly low price.  Had he offered to
swap wholesale to wholesale, maybe we could have done some business.
Along the way. I looked at the pipes someone else had brought in but
which Nikos offered him too little for.  This gentleman came over to
me later and suggested that I join he and some friends downstairs.

Sure enough, downstairs there was a competing group of people sitting
around in one of the rooms.  Knowing that Bob and Nikos were coming
they had opened their own mini-show on the first floor selling their
own goods.  I decided to try a Caminetto when the offer was $75 each,
two for $100, and picked out an Oom Paul and a straight pot.  These
were the first Caminettos I had tried and I must admit they smoke
well, much drier than other pipes I have.  I also was able to make the
gentleman from upstairs happy by buying a 1978 Dunhill (Group 6) from
him for $150, way below retail and well above what Nikos offered him.
Why I bought it is beyond me, as I have never had a Dunhill, but since
it was unsmoked, in the original box, and nice I said to myself, go
ahead self.  In any event that is what makes these swaps fun.

Bengal Slices

LenrdZelig asked in the last digest (151) about how to smoke Bengal
Slices.  I have used this brand in the past, liked it, and never found
a way to truly enjoy it until I learned that it has to really be
rubbed out to break up the slices before you can use it.  I used to
rub several slices between my hands thinking I had rubbed it up
enough, but the slices still stayed together too much.  That makes it
hard to keep the pipe lit.  One must really rub it out so that it
looks like loose tobacco, or put it through a food processor (don't
laugh, it works). Once it is rubbed out enough you will find it smokes
well.  If you like, try Escudo as well.

Elias

Welcome back from those of us who read the back issues from day one.  

More in later issues.

Dear Steve et al.,

	I hazve submitted to 'the digest' I think maybe once before and 
have been faithfully reading for about four or five months.  As I may or 
may not have mentioned previously, I am a college student who enjoys the 
freedoms and liberties college affords to smoke.  It being the summer, I 
am home from school and have not had the opportunity to enjoy a good 
bowlful in peace for about two months (going on a third ever-lenghtening 
month).  I would like you to know how much I enjoy the voyeuristic 
pleasures of the digest.  While I am unable to smoke it is good to 
know that the rest of the world goes right on puffing.  I am writing know 
to voice my two cents about the "text article on Pipe smoking".
	I noticed in the last digest that the cavendish mistake was 
cleared up.  Being a proud smoker of English tobaccos I hate to see the 
unholy cavendish grouped within English.  As well, I disliked the tone of 
the artivcle.  It is my belief that an article, even that article, is 
meant to enlighten objectively. (although some newspaper critics may 
object to that) The text file was not written objectively at all.  The 
suggestions and opinions expressed are not views that I think the 
majority of pipe smokers hold and some of the "facts", as exposed 
earlier, are erroneous.  
	Thank you for providing a forum for my little soapbox tirade and 
may all who can, enjoy the last of the summer smoking.

				Smoke one for me,

<a name="10">Subject: Pipe Shop in San Jose</a>

Steve,

It's good to be part of the group.  I'm a relative new comer, only been
smoking a pipe for a year.  I perfer straight pipes over bents.  In the
newest digest, I noticed another pipe shop you might want to add to the
list.

   Mission Pipe Shop
   812 Town &amp; Country Village Drive
   San Jose, California 95128
   408/241-8868

They have a very good selection of cigars, pipes and tobacco (of which they
blend themselves).  It's a very friendly atmosphere (aren't all shops?).
One thing that some of the female readers might be interested is the shop
is owned by a woman, Donna.  She's very knowledgable and (don't take this
the wrong way) she has a great nose.  I brought in some tobacco a friend
bought for me from Canada.  I wanted to get something similiar, but I had
no idea what was in the blend.  Donna sniffed, then said (something like)
"white burly, black, and vanilla.  I don't have anything like that, but we
can try and blend you up something like it ..."

Anyway, I'm still trying to find that elusive blend, but my friend is going
back to Canada.  I'll ask if she won't bring back some more of that "Judges
Mix" for me.  (I'll also get the street address of the shop in Canada.)

Why don't you ever see menthol pipe tobacco?  Of all the stores I've
ever gone to I never seem to see this offered.  It's not that I want
it (I'd try it sure for the experience) but since menthol is a popular
flavor in cigarettes and some cigars, I figured you could get
mentholated pipe blends. Do they exist?

<a name="13">Subject: Intro</a>

Hi Steve.  I assume that messages are first sent to you, then to the 
pipe digest.  If not, I probably missed where exactly to send messages.

I just recently started smoking a pipe, and I still occasionaly smoke a 
cigar or two.  What's surprising to me is that I never even smoked a 
cigarette when I was growing up (I'm 28 now)--not even sneaking one with 
some friends because it was "cool".  I got started with some fellow friends 
here at Rice when one of them had their second baby.  Since we always seem 
to hear about 'handing out cigars', we decided we should get some and smoke 
them with the new dad.  We all got some Swischer Sweets (sp?) and lit up on 
afternoon.  Well, I'm sorry if I offend someone, but they were BAD!  Some 
people might like the taste, but to me it was nauseous.  So, we decided to 
get some "better" cigars.  I don't recall the brand, but at that point, our 
idea of "better" was something like $0.75 cigars ;-)  Well, compared to the 
Swischer's they were better--relatively speaking.

We finally decided to actual go to a tobacco shop and get a "real" cigar.
(For an addition to the tabacco shop list, this is where I go to get cigars 
and pipe tobacco--The Brair Shoppe in the Village near Rice University--I 
can get the number and address if anyone wants it, otherwise anyone in Houston
can get in touch with me and I can direct them to where it is).  

We started out with a Fonseca maduro.  It was very pleasant and not very 
harsh (compared, say, to an Onyx).  So we were hooked.  Well, my wife didn't 
exactly like the smell of the cigars (although I'll give her credit that she 
didn't really mind that I smoked them--albeit not in the house ;-) so she 
suggested I smoke a pipe.  Well, I decided why not, and bought a pipe with 
helpful suggestions from the people at the Brair Shoppe.  It was hard getting 
started as I constantly had to relight it, but now I can pack it pretty well
and keep it lit (as long as I continue to puff on it).  

Well, that's my introduction.  Hope I didn't bore anyone too bad.  For anyone 
who is in Houston or the Houston area, the Briar Shoppe is organizing a 
cigar dinner for sometime in October or September.  Sounds pretty good as I 
think they are getting the Rainbow Lodge, a pretty nice place.

Steve, 
I don't know whether you would consider this a "proper" subject for inclusion
in the digest, but a hard-copy, snail-mail newsletter devoted to the smoking
fetish (for people who are aroused by watching others smoke) is now
available---and since I know there ARE readers of the pipes digest who may be
interested, I thought I'd at least pass this along to you.  Full details are
available by email from ?????????@???.???.

Thanks.

Interesting news: The Sunday, August 14 _Trenton Times_ reported that
OSHA has received over 50,000 letters in opposition to Docket #H-122!
(See Digest #146.) Recall that this docket would unconditionally
prohibit smoking in all "workplaces," including bars and restaurants,
under all conditions. I believe that such a response is unprecedented
for an OSHA docket. Thanks to you who wrote, our legislators now know
that attempts at "backdoor prohibition" will have a political
cost. Keep up the good fight!

Hi, all,

I clipped the following from the Sunday Trenton Times (August 14,
1994). Enjoy! -S.

SURGEON HITS RECORD $8.5M IN A.C.

ATLANTIC CITY (AP) - A New York surgeon's penchant for cigars paid off
in a big way yesterday.

Shunned from a nonsmoking blackjack table in Bally's Grand Casino
Hotel, Dr. Frank Oliveto moved to a progressive $1 slot machine that
ended up paying out an $8.5 million jackpot, officials said.

Yesterday's Megabucks payout is the largest ever in Atlantic City,
said Pam Sinderbrand, a spokeswoman for International Game Technology,
which manufactures the 186 Megabucks slot machines in the city's 12
casinos.

The jackpot had been accumulating since the previous $3.9 million
record prize was paid out in November 1992, Sinderbrand said.

"Smoking is bad for your health, but it's good for my pocketbook,"
said Oliveto, of Port Jefferson, N.Y.

Oliveto, 54, received the first of 20 annual checks for $427,275
yesterday, said Sinderbrand.

The orthopedic surgeon went to the Megabucks machine with $100 of
dollar coins. He had played about $80 and won back roughly $35 before
hitting the $8.5 million, said Sinderbrand.

Twelve people have won at Megabucks  since the progressive slots
debuted in the resort's casinos in 1990. Every time someone drops a
dollar in any of the machines, which are linked with the machines in
each of the city's gaming halls, the jackpot increases by a percentage
of that bet.

"To hit the primary jackpot, you have to play three coins, the maximum
bet," she said. The $3 wager landed Oliveto the big bucks when four
Megabucks symbols appeared on the third payline.

Oliveto is a physician at Mather Memorial Hospital and St. Charles
Hospital in Port Jefferson. He says he even joked with his operating
room staff earlier this week that he would win the big jackpot this
weekend.

<a name="3">Subject: First Pipe</a>

Hello-
	I thought some people might get a laugh out of my experiences
with my first pipe. I'd appreciate advice on doing things better,
given my limited options. (I'm a grad student at age 39.) This summer
has given me time to ponder just why my grandfather and dad always had
a pipe handy.

	I live in a quiet town in a rural state (Maine), and the pipe
smoking options are severely limited. The local pharmacy had only two
pipes in stock, so I wound up with a Dr. Grabow _Savoy_ model. The
thing takes filters, so I purchased a pack of charcoal ones too.
Tobacco was also limited, but I bought two samples: Borkum Riff
(Cherry) and Sir Walter Raleigh. Total cost: $18.45.

	The first thing I did was sand off the black mystery exterior,
and uncovered a pleasantly grained briar. The grain has some
interesting burls, and no putty filling. This bare surface was
promptly oiled with vegetable oil, given 3 coats, until the wood no
longer sucked it up.

	I've been smoking it for a week now, occasionally rubbing the
warm bowl with the side of my nose to oil it after a smoke. I've
been using book matches to light it, and have had great success
keeping it lit. (Don't like the sulphurous cloud from wooden matches.)
My smoking tools are a 20 penny nail and a pocket knife.

	This is about as entry level as it gets! Still, I'm pleased to
have personalised the pipe somewhat, and enjoy seeing the briar
darkening with handling. The filters don't seem to be too much of a
frivolity, either. In fact, they trap the drool very well at the stem
end, and catch all sorts of little nasties before they get into my
mouth. I seem to prefer the Raleigh, now.

	Questions:
	1) Does anyone have evidence or stories concerning pipes and
	   stress? (My cluster migraine headaches have gone away!)
	2) Is there anyone out there with advice on home flavoring?
	   I'd like to try a few things: maple syrup (the real stuff),
	   vanilla, and maybe almond. There has to be a way to flavor
	   some myself.

	Thanks for reading, hope you found it interesting to hear from
the lower end of the spectrum. Peaceful smoking to all.

<a name="4">Subject: For the Pipes Digest</a>

Hello all--

My fiance and I made the charming discovery that our next-door neighbor
is a cigar smoker; in fact, he's made us presents of a very nice
Dunhill and a couple of Onyxes. We spent a really lovely summer night last
week on his porch, John my fiance and Brian my neighbor smoking the
Onyxes, and I puffing on one of my favorites, a sweet little cigar
called a Frisco from Thompson's of Tampa. What a night. The cool thing
is, Brian's a food services manager at a large hotel here in town; he
organized a cigar night a couple weeks ago and it was such a success
they're going to throw another one.

Request #1: 'd like to surprise my sweetie with a box of really nice
cigars on our wedding day.  I'm not rich. His everyday cigar is a 
Casanova, maduro wrapped, also from Thompsons. Recommendations?

Request #2: I'm still looking for pipe tobacco with a sweet but not sickly
aroma, smooth to the tastebuds and the nose. The closest I've come is
one called Golden Honey from a no-name tobacconist/head shop down the
road. I really don't want to buy there, and they won't tell me who makes
it.

Request #3: John, our friends and I are opening a cafe that will allow
smoking, especially pipe smoking. It'll be the only one in Southeast
Portland that allows smoking of any kind. We'll also be selling tobacco,
starting out with quality cigarettes, tinned tobacco and some cigars,
and eventually want to sell mostly loose and tinned tobacco for pipes
and cigars, with few cigarettes. Actually this is a two-part request. We
also want to have internet access, and are very concerned about smoke
damage to the equipment. So, #3a, what do you smoking computer people
recommend to keep the equipment safe? #3b is, what brands of tobacco
would you suggest we carry in tins to begin with? Whoops #3c, do you
know of wholesalers for loose pipe tobacco?

Regards,
Lynsa

[ Excellent, Lynsa! Great idea! I wish you the best of luck in your
haven for smokers of taste.

Regarding #3a, the major vulnerable points are the removable media and
the keyboard; just cover them when not in use and try not to spill
ashes. The only damage I ever did to my Macintosh by smoking occurred
when an unlit Ben Wade dropped out of my rack onto the keyboard, stem
down. :-) Broke the stem, too. :-(

Regarding #3b, I'd say definitely go for snob appeal. As Cigar
Aficionado has made clear, it's what sells. Dunhill, Rattray's,
Erinmore, Balkan Sobranie, McClelland's, and McConnell spring to
mind. Also get some American Spirit; technically it's cigarette
tobacco, but the idea will appeal. Smudge grass, too. (Anyone know
where to get Native American willow-bark tobacco?) Flake tobacco might
be good, in the sense that there's a minor skill to show off to
customers in rubbing it out.

I'd also recommend stocking a few pipes for customers who don't have
their own. Clays might be good on the low end (Lepeltier makes a nice
double-walled clay pipe that retails for $15, and is well worth
it). You can go upscale from there, but don't put _too_ much $$$ into
inventory to start. You might even consider running a deal like Keen's
English Chop House, where the customers have their own numbered
long-stemmed clay pipes at the cafe, and you'd hang them as
decoration.

And, at the risk of pulling a Polonius, two other things. First, don't
be afraid to spend a few bucks to advertise in the restaurant section
of the local city magazine, whatever that is. Snob appeal sells.
Second, it might be wise to incorporate as a "private club" and hand
out free memberships, to thwart potential anti legislation.

Regarding #3c, you might try the following magazine for sources of
loose tobacco (from Digest #150):

	Smokeshop Magazine
	B M T Publications, Inc.
	7 Penn Plaza
	New York, NY 10001-3900
	212-594-4120  
	FAX: 212-714-0514

Or contact:

	Retail Tobacco Dealers' Association
	The Atrium
	55 Maple Avenue
	Rockville Centre, NY 11570
	(516) 766-4100

The address is from the Encyclopedia of Associations [a _very_ handy
reference!], but I only have the 1989 edition here, and the address
may have changed. If you don't get them at that number, try your local
library for a newer edition. Or maybe someone can confirm the address
or provide a new one?

In any case, please keep us informed, and I'll stop in the next time
I'm in Portland. Do you have a name for the place yet? -S. ]

Steve, many thanks for the D/L. When you say "mail" I assume you mean
via internet not USSnail. Yes, I'd like the past issues assuming 
it is somewhat shorter than the Internet mail list :)

As to my bio: 63 years old, started on cigarettes at age 14, 
quit cold-turkey in 1969 at age 38, ended up in the hospital
with ulcerative colitis in 1970, placed on Prednisone, gained
from 190 normal weight to 260, got into amateur rodeo for
exercise, picked up tobac chew habit wife said love life
would end thereby, started chewing cigars, then lit them,
this about 1972, was able to get off drug - didn't relate
it to tobac use at the time - started running 2 12min miles
2x a week, lost desire to smoke, started to bleed again,
by this time wife talked me into a pipe - loved it - got
back to both pipe &amp; cigar, bleeding quit. Curious, started
experimenting and inquiring with friendly doc. Found info
in NE Journal of Medicine, original study in Sweden:

"20% of longterm smokers who quit develop 
ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis,"

and named some other"psychosomatic" illnesses.
Amazing. I do not inhale either pipe or cigar, so
sufficient nicotine enters via saliva. Great. Because
I really enjoy both: smoke 3 to 4 cigars a day and
several pipes. My major smokes are bundle cigars from
local or J.R., spending from $13 for Macatans, a heavy
full bodied Mexican Rothchild size, or some of J.R.'s
seconds, or Whitehalls - not too bad a cigar - and
also keep on hand Punch Rothchilds, Cuba Aliados,
Don Diego Grande, H.Uppman Corsarios and Columbos,
Macanudo Hyde Park, Montecruz 201. My favorites are
Aliados &amp; the H.Uppmans.

Pipe tobac is mainly 5100, also their light English,
Never recall the number, 2020 or 2025 - anyhow, I get
that locally at retail. I own 10 pre 1987 Dunhills,
Several Preben Holmes, a few Charatans, a Costello,
a Caminetto a Ferndown, a pretransition Barling, 
several Petersons post Free-State, a Stanwell, 
and quite a few seconds of major brands marked 
as shop pipes with the retailer's name.

My favorites are a matched pair of 1987 Dunhills,
marked with the silver band for the Dunhill 
Centennial, 2 Dunhill Bent Cumberlands. 
But the best smoke I have is an ancient 
Thornycroft I bought used in 1972 for $7.00. 
It is always outstanding. 

I'm NOT a serious collector, I just enjoy a good
pipe. Having spent 5 years in the USMC 1948/53,
I couldn't resist a Meerschaum by Bechler, a JAO
distributed pipe, with a carving of the USMC
emblem on the forward face. That one I have
never smoked. I have one other Meerschaum from
JAO I do smoke on occasion - don't think much
of it. I do trade pipes at times. Fortunately,
we have two very good retailers who deal in
good used pipes: The Arcade Smoke Shop in
downtown Nashville, TN; and the Three-Ten
Pipe Shop in Murfreesboro, TN. The latter
deals ONLY in Dunhills as used pipes, also
carries a full line of other brands, and
new Dunhills - they ain't the same as the
oldies, believe me, just the same high price.

My wife is an ex-cigarette smoker - thank God -
and very tolerant of my habit. I bought a huge
room air filter that takes care of the cigar
smoke in the front room, though I do most
of my cigars while upstairs in my office while
on the computer.

My hobbies are fly fishing and computer cryptography
programs - just got PGP and am fascinated with the
possibilities. I have been a free-lance court reporter
since 1962; previously a District Sales Manager for
Hunt Foods, and before that a Los Angeles cop, and
before that a BARman in the USMC, Korea, etc.
Born in San Francisco, married an Arkansas gal,
settled in the South and think Nashville is great
even though I do not like Country Music.

Best Regards,

Ray

only outlaws will have privacy. :-) -S. ]

<a name="6">Subject: Re: Your Pipes Digest subscription request</a>

Thanks for approving my request. I've been a cigar smoker for years now 
and have yet to try smoking pipes. I was at a little gathering over the 
weekend when I met this really interesting chap from Wales who was an 
ardent pipeist. He spent a good deal of time enlightening me on the world 
of pipe smoking. By the end of the evening, boy, I was hooked on the idea 
of pipe smoking. Such a shame that no tobacconist was open at that time 
of the night 'cos I was all psyched-up and ready to get my first pipe. 
Anyway, it was a good thing I did rush right into buying one. Spent the 
next few days reading back issues of Cigar Aficionados trying to get a 
better idea about being a pipeist. I finally decided that I'm going to 
buy a second-hand pipe instead of a new one, especially a good one 'cos I 
know that good new briar pipes run into the hundreds or even thousands of 
dollars.

So, I'm going to spend the next few days checking out the city's 
tobacconists for good second-hand briar pipes. If anyone's got a good 
idea where I should be looking in New York City, I'm all ears.

Good to be on-board. Thanks.

Steve,

I've always thought that the proper humidity was somewhere around 70%, but 
the shop I buy from normally has it up around 75-80%.  It doesn't seem to do 
any damage to the cigars.  In fact I think they actually smoke better.

Hi Steve.
Im new to the "net". I've been smoking a pipe since I was 14 and I'm now 58 
with seemingly no ill effects. I'm also from Canada and our tobacco prices 
are sky high ($12.50 for 50grms) so I grow my own. Can anyone out there tell

Thankx     Gerry Hilton

<a name="9">Subject: reply and general</a>

Hello Steve;
        Received your mail reply today for my query. Thank you.I'm rather 
astounded at the amount of interest in pipe smoking out there. I was 
starting to feel paranoid that I was the only one left. :-)
        Here's a brief history of myself... I'm 58 yrs. old, married to a 
really great lady who is also my best friend and I'm supposed to be retired 
but I can't quite get the hang of it. I've been smoking a pipe since I was 
14 and never did smoke cigarettes or cigars etc. I'm a creature of habit I 
guess.
        My wife and I live in Nova Scotia (Canada eh ) and I own and operate 
a small sawmill as well as a few other little projects (lumber kiln). 
Basicly thats about it -- typical boring Canadian.
        In the last few years, there has been such an anti-smoking campain 
here that the price of tobacco has gone out of sight and made a very 
lucrative smuggling trade for some of the more adventursome. Some of us like 
myself said to hell with the goverment an we grow our own from seed when we 
can get them. I say when we can get them because Canada Post has a habit of 
opening mail if they think there's anything fuzzy about it. Their quite 
determined to keep us healthy.
        Anyhow, for the last two years I've managed to grow my own fairly 
successfully but I have problems curing it and storing it. We can't get any 
information on this type of thing here so if any of your readers can advise 
me a little on it I'd really appreciate it.
        I won't take up anymore of your time so thankx once again for the 
reply. My best to you,
    
        Gerry

      I am really enjoying being part of the group. I have heard from
someone in Ottawa and also have told a couple of my friends that you are
on the net, which I think will stimulate them to get hooked up to a line
somewhere.  

I have a question regarding whether it is appropriate to offer
pipes for trade or sale. I have a small collection of about 90 pipes. It
probably looks like a collection of four or five hundred that had been
cherry picked leaving pipes like: pat. dunhill bowling ball dr's, charatan
supremes, blue ribbands, gbd pedigree..etc. What I tried to do was put
togeter a sample of the bestof the english pipes that my grandfather or
father would have liked and represented a time where quality had a
different meaning.  

For everyday, I smoke JT Cooke or Bob Peretti's ( some
which were actually made by his grandfater ) along with a group of
briarcrafts that Ves made very early in his career, which he collected for
me from some of his old customers. So I have another 36 or so neat briars
which are the faithful survants to cope with my more intense overworked
moods and the other group for those more relaxing and contemplative times. 

It is very hard to swap pipes here in Ottawa where there is no real shop.. 
and the border can be trickey but I have established a bit of a network
through the US.  So, after the long preamble...is it appropriate to make
offers to people in the group if it is not a commercial business?  

Also, I havesome interesting dating/numbering questions with some
pat.dunhills .. are there collectors in the group?  I really enjoy the sense
of being connected to the briar. Thanks for being a volunteer facilitator.

Hi Steve.

I'm back from my European vacation and have a new email address.
?????????????@?????.?????????.???

I think I left off somewhere around digest #130 and would appreciate the
back issues if you get a chance.

Denmark is a pipe smoker's dream.  Along the pedestrian mall, there are
many pipe shops and tobacconists to browse through, and pipe smoking seems
to be much more prevelant than here (Canada or USA).  I didn't feel wierd
at all being the youngest person in the shop because I was surrounded with
people my age (24).  I picked up a Stanwell pipe and a can of W.O. Larson's
tobacco for a souvenir.

To anyone visiting northern Europe, I suggest a detour to Copenhagen to
pick  up a pipe or two and some nice Danish tobacco.  The pipe museum at W.
O. Larson's pipe shop is an interesting stop too.

Talk to you later.
Dave

[ Reposted from alt.smokers.cigars. -S. ]

I just made a Sunday afternoon trip to Edwards Pipe and Tobacco Shop in
Reseda; he's just getting set up, has only been at this location (Tampa
and Saticoy) six weeks; the earthquake destroyed the old location (just
one block south of the Northridge mall, which everyone saw in the news
reports, I'm sure); Roy Canada said that it's been very hard to get
product lately, but the upcoming RTDA show in Chicago should help.  Not
too full a humidor, but not terrible, and decent prices from what I saw.

While there, picked up Aug '94 copy of The Cigar Monthly (TCM) I've been
looking but CA is nowhere to be found, local newsstands say it'll be out 
next week. not a bad newsletter; I say newsletter because it's a fairly 
simple non-glossy beige paper, some illustrations, ads, etc.

TCM had a good interview with Richard DiMeola, COO of Consolidated
Cigar (Dunhill, H. Upmann, Don Diego, Primo del Rey, Montecruz, Royal
Jamaica (now made in the Dominican Republic), Cabanas, Henry Clay, Don
Miguel, Santa Damiana, Montecristo; then of course the mass market ones,
Antonio &amp; Cleopatra, El Producto, Dutch Masters, Murial, Dutch Treats, 
Backwoods).  

Some interesting statistics: in the mass market cigar lines that
Consolidated carries, in 1993 they shipped 2 billion cigars.  Their
banner year was 1964, when 9 billion cigars were bought; people were
trying to change to cigars from cigarettes since the Surgeon General had
reported on the link between cigarettes and cancer.  In the deluxe
lines, they shipped 24 million cigars, 20 million to the U.S.; they were
also backordered 3.1 million; he said they could probably sell 40
million, but that the quality would drop too much.  The premium cigars
come out of La Romana, Dominican Republic, where they employ 1,200
people; they also have 300 in Danli, Honduras.

This issue included a calendar of cigar smoking events; I'll list them
in a separate posting.

Oh, and TCM mentioned that there are only twelve shops in the U.S. carrying
the new Consoldated Montecristo brand; supposed to be very good, if you
can find them.  Anyone?

TCM 's address:

SCCM Publications, 
1223 Wilshire Blvd., #241,
Santa Monica, CA 90403.

$12/year U.S., $18/year outside.

Re: smoke and computer equipment (Lyn's questions
about a smoking cafe with Internet access) ...

FWIW, my college electronic music professor, who taught
recording technology among other subjects, insisted that
smoke was harmful to tape heads. Smoke particles
are abrasive and they hasten wear on the heads. I would
imagine floppy-drive heads would be susceptible
to increased wear from smoke, but I don't know
how much and how big a problem it is.

If you're thinking about installing terminals in the cafe
itself (like the cafes in San Fransisco that participate
in Cafe Net), you can get plastic keyboard covers to protect the
keyboards. They interfere a little bit with typing, but
it's not too bad and definitely worth it to keep food and
beverages out of the keys. Heck, even if the only computer
in the building will be for office management and the
all-important e-mail ;-), a keyboard cover might still
be a good idea.

<a name="3">Subject: Re: Your Pipes Digest subscription request</a>

Hello to all of you pipe smokers!

I'm new to this mailgroup, and this is my first submission in which I
will try to introduce myself.  
My name is Staffan Ulfberg, I live in Sweden and have just completed
my Master in Computer Science at the age of 24.  I started smoking a
pipe only about half a year ago, but since then I have not smoked more
than a handfull of cigarettes.  I used to smoke, say on the average a
packet of cigarettes a week, concentrated to weekends, and now I smoke
about a full pipe of tobacco every day (mostly in front of my computer
at late nights - like now).  
I only have one pipe of the brand Ratos, made here in Sweden, which
sold for about $30; it has a briar head and a bit of ebonite and is
quite small in size - a full pipe lasts for 20-30 minutes depending on
the tobacco.  I like it very much!  Nevertheless, I'm thinking about
buying another one that should be a bit larger.  I hope to get some
recommendations here!
I live in a town in the north called Lulea, which has a quite good
tobacconist that carry about 30 different types of pipe tobacco - both
domestic and imported.  I'm currently trying a new kind every time I
buy some, so I don't really have a favourite yet...

OK, happy puffing to you all and thank you!

Hello Steve,

I have been given your name so that I might receive (or rather be
added to) a mailing list for pipe smokers.  I am a new (or actually soon
to be) pipe smoker and need lots of advice from patient experienced
smokers to help along someone who knows nothing from purchasing a
pipe, what tobacco to begin with, correct cleaning methods, average
frequency of smoking (how many bowls a day to begin with... and to
work towards), proper use of a tamper and other accessories.

I really know nothing....except I wish to be a pipe smoker.

Any help you or your contacts could give would be helpful and add me to
your mailing list.

Also, I'm new to e-mail.  If you could tell me the proper "path" to
follow to access the mailing list, I'd appreciate it. 

Thanks again.

Joe

Hi all...
Dateline:   Columbus, Ohio had a big no smoking legislation battle ( on hold
at the moment ) basically banning smoking everywhere but your bedroom ( It
was rumored they were attempting to ban it in IN-HOME businesses if anyone
but the owner was employed there! ) It has been stalled in court while they
decide if it's Constitutional .Tobacco seller's were (are? ) exempt- and the
local Smoker's Haven moved to a new location with their own smoking "lounge"
haven't been there yet, but intend to. ( is it just me, or does it seem that
the government never bothers to " look out" for the average citizen when it
comes to any other hazard  (( like nuclear testing and cancer -causing
electromagnetic waves from power lines next to schools ( where BIG BUSINESS
has a monetary stake ) but now all of the sudden--they MUST look after our
health by taking away our rights. re tobacco))   FUNNY- Now that boomers  and
post WW2 generation  ( the ones that had the army mailing them all sorts of
lucky strikes to keep them alert at their posts on the front line to defend
your rights and mine )) are aging- insurance companies will soon have to
cough &lt; no pun intended&gt;  up some of the millions of  $$$ that all of us have
been paying premiums on , to cover medical expenses caused  "by smoking " (
like,  jet fuel, and car emmissions and corporate polluting haven't had a
hand in giving us all cancer )   Smokers are little people turned into
scapegoats , blamed for thier own and other peoples, ills.  In the end, as
always, it's a matter of looking out for the interests $$$ of big money
companies ( Prudential, Allstate, etc. )  And worst of all... they have given
the non-smoking citizens carte blanche to treat smokers like child molesters
( " You're giving my child Cancer, you murderer!!" ) Pardon me maam, did you
drive a car here to the restaurant? Did you fly in a jet to go on vacation to
Florida this year? Did you light wood fires in your fireplace last winter?
Spray Bug spray? Fertilize the lawn with chemicals? Vote for that new
trash-burning power plant, or toxic-waste dumping, tax abating,  company from
overseas because it was suggested that you do so, by the political party of
your choice, to help bring jobs to your newly revitalized city?  . At the
risk of sounding like Chicken Little .. One day, people are verbally bashing
smokers, next day, we're all helping push people into ovens!   O.K.- maybe
that's a bit extreme, but when did America stop being the land of the
free????!!!! Steve--- I knowthis is probably waaayy to long to stick on the
Digest, but for what it's worth...

&gt;    2) Is there anyone out there with advice on home flavoring?
&gt;       I'd like to try a few things: maple syrup (the real stuff),
&gt;       vanilla, and maybe almond. There has to be a way to flavor
&gt;       some myself.

A colleague down the hall used to smoke a pipe while on submarine
duty in the Navy.  He kept a flask of peach brandy on board and would
use it to moisten the tobaccoo.  The captain would stop by on his
daily tour to chat and have a smoke.  You might give that a try.

Greetings Steve!

First off I want to thank you for the beginner pipe smoker's starter kit
that you mailed to me a while back. Sad thing is that I was sick all winter
and never got a chance to try it out. Also since my allergies now include
tobacco smoke I will probably never get a chance to check it out :(  I have
given the kit to one of my male friends who is enjoying it!  Fate does
deliver us curve balls :(

I also want to thank you for all the work you have been doing with the
mailing list! I have enjoyed reading it through the months! However, I will
soon be disconnecting my Internet account (end of August) and moving to a
rural community that does not yet have an Internet connectivity &lt;sigh&gt; so I
would appreciate if you would please unsubscribe me to the pipe digest. My
sysadmin here at teleport.com would also appreciate it :)

Again thanks for all your time and effort and may whatever gods there be
smile upon you! :)

be full of care, cya, Karen

[ As I said before, best of luck in your new venture, Karen! And I'm
glad your male friend is getting some use out of it. And, as for fate
throwing strange curves, see below... :-) -S. ]

I've been reading the group since may now and thought it was time to 
post.  Bear with me folks my typing is only a little better then my 
spelling so some interesting letter formations may appear on your screen 
when readin' someting i write, but you seem like a mellow group that only 
applys a flame to tobbaco so here goes.

I got my first pipe from my wife that recieved it as a free intro package 
for females from someware (probably someone on this list).  It had lots 
of matches (Swans i think was the brand), a pipe (ove course), around 2oz 
of vanilla cavendish, and some cleaners.  The pipe was really great but 
like a fool i passed it on to a friend after i bought my third pipe.  At 
the time i thought the bowl was too big.

My second pipe was a mistake it has a laquor finish that bubbles horibly 
every time i smoke it, i'm thinking of sanding the damb thing down and 
just leaving it natural.

The pipe i smoke now i've become very fond of.  It is made in Italy but i 
don't know the bran, i payed $16 or so for it so i'm sure its nothing 
special.  It has a curved stem and maderate sized bowl that i have 
learned to smoke from start to finish with one lighting, it took me 2 
months to perfect this.  I'm now working on ridding myself of the problem 
of juice build up and having fair success.

My favorite tobbaco to date is still a vanilla cavendish.  Could anybody 
suggest a Good blend of this since i'm now smoking a cheap one that 
though i tink it is good could be much better.  I like a strong vanilla 
tast but not so much as to feal like a menthol cig and numb out my 
mouth.

Enough babbeing though.  What i really posted to ask is if anyone has 
tried to carve thier own pipe.  I am a poor collage student that can't 
afford to buy them and have had little success find them used in my 
area.  Is there a good book i could track down to show the proccess that 
will save me many headaces of trial and error?  There was a post in an 
earlyer issue where someone asked about pipe making but i never heard a 
reply on the digest.  Thanks in advance for any advice/help.

[ Welcome, Nate! I think I know _exactly_ where the kit came from. :-)

<a name="11">Subject:Cavendish Tobacco</a>
In Digest 150 Tom Line posted a text file which I found very good reading. 
The part about cavendish tobacco has me wondering though.  Tom wrote:

&gt;        3. Cabendish or English tobacco.
&gt;             This stuff is black. Unlike Burley tobaccos which are
&gt;             a brown color, Cabendish looks like it's been in a
&gt;             smoker for a couple weeks black and smells like
&gt;             burnt coals. 

I can't say about English tobacco (which others have pointed out is not the
same as cavendish), but the cavendish I've used smells very sweet and
almost chocolatey, certainly not like any burnt coals I've smelled.  The
smell was so temping (good enough to eat), that I did try chewing a bit.  I
learned my lesson about smells good and tastes good pretty fast :). 
Anyway, that's just my opinion, and we're all entitled to our own.

So put that in your pipe and smoke it, or whatever else you may enjoy, I'll
keep smoking my cavendish.

Dave.

Thanks for the pointer on NML pipes managed to get the info from a friend
directory where pretty useless......Please find attached my trip report
for london.

================================== CUT HERE ================================

Having just returned from 2 weeks in  London I have the following to mention
concerning Pipe and Tobbaco hunting in London.

First and Foremost get a copy of a publication called  'Pipesmokers Welcome

E8 3BJ.( Just write them a letter and they will post it to you ..)
This Publication is Great not just for London but for the ENTIRE UK.it lists
Most of the pipes Stores worth visting, a who's who in the Pipe and Tobacco
Industry, A complete listing of most of the avaliable tobaccos with there
characteristics.

I visted the following stores in london  Benson &amp; Hedges, G Smith &amp; Son,
Shervingtons,Alfred Dunhill, James J Fox and Robert Lewis, Davidoff

Benson and Hedges.13 Old Bond Street.
Nice collection of Pipes Dunhill, Peterson and Cigars, B and H do no longer
have a house blend pipe tobacco.

G Smith and Son. 74 Charing Cross Road
What a truly amazing collection of Tobacco's and pipes ( good prices on pipes )
also Have Snuff !!! ( I understand from talking to them that they make it them
selves.) they have a extensive mail order service ( Export as well !!)

Alfred Dunhill 30 Duke Street.
This store is truly amazing. the smokers selection is at the rear of the store

they have a wonderful selection of Hand blended tobaccos approx 30 blends are
avaliable ( If any body is interested I can supply a list via email )
they are also very willing to do mail order to US and Canada. you can also ask
to join the Followship of the white dot  Quote " The fellowship of the white

Steve,
Thanks for including me on the Mail Pipes list.  I have enjoyed
reading the last 
 two issues and thought I'd submit a couple of items/comments.

I am 36 years old and started smoking pipes about 2-3 years ago.  It
took about six months to really be able to enjoy the whole process.
It might have taken longer. . . if I had not read the available books
and got advice from some experienced folks at a local shop.

Since then, I have been in search of the "ultimate blend," and the
search has been quite interesting.  Quickly figuring out that several
shop sells some of the same mixtures under their own name and learning
that there really is special blend out there, it just takes time and
flexibility to get to them.  I have also been enjoying a good cigar
once in a while, this started about five years ago(Henry Clays or
Gloria Cubana).  I still use a pipe the majority of the time when
smoking.  Like most, but not all, folks who smoke pipes and/or cigars,
I do not smoke cigarettes.  This seems to be the common finding in
most articles, meetings and research these days so I guess I'm no
different.

I have tried several mixtures of both aromatic and English blends and
concluded that both types have alot to offer.  Right now my favorites
include:

-------------------------

o Aromatic mix No.7, Cherry, from Levin Pipes.  It is a great
flavorful blend that burns well and needs almost no rubbing out.
Interestingly, it is not you typical bland cavendish with flavoring.
Also, people will beg you to smoke it because it has a great aroma.
It makes friends with non-smokers.

---------------------------

o Frog Morton, from Levin Pipes.  A more tradition strong mixture with
plenty of latakia and other exotica blended in.  This dark
non-aromatic mixture smokes much sweeter than it looks.

---------------------------

o Vintage Bend, from the TinderBox.  It's an aromatic, and is very
light in flavor.  It is completely light brownish and needs no rubbing
out whatsoever(I think it is called cube cut, if that makes sense).  I
do not know what flavor it is but the first 3/4 of the bowl are always
great and the remainder is rather bland.  It burns warm to hot, so it
goes quickly.  It is a very subtle tobak.

-----------------------------

Last, Bengal Slices.  So far, this is the best canned or off-the-shelf
blend.  As one fellow mentioned in a recent issue, they do need to be
rubbed out thoroughly.  If they are very moist, they will not light.
But the fuss is worth it as the taste is great.  Maybe not for a
beginner.  Notably, I tried slices labeled aromatic, in the exact same
tin as the traditional slices.  It was terrible.  A perfume-like
scented block of tasteless _r_p.  Then accidentally, I found a "pouch"
of Bengal Aromatic.  No slices, but a rather sticky mixture in a moist
bag.  Very flavorful though.  Completely different that the other
Bengal products.  If anyone locates a pouch or two of this, let me
know.  The Bengal saga continues.

-----------------------------

Anyone find any other Bengal products that we don't know about????

I have tried several Pipe brands.  I like the Peterson bent pipes, in
briar and meerschaum.  I am presently looking for a new "large-bowl
Peterson meerschaum." I enjoy the Mark Twin and Standard model the
most.

Looking forward to the next issue.

Take Care -Jeof

[ Thanks, Jeof! Might try Bengal Slices one of these days, and I
concur about the Mark Twain. -S. ]

Steve,

  I received my Introductory Letter/Resource Guide today.  Thanks
alot.  I just discovered this newsgroup yesterday and it's already
broadened my horizons.

  I started smoking pipes several years ago when my father passed
away and I inherited some of his pipes.  My mom tossed all but the
Merschaums.  I guess I lke pipes because of the pleasure and 'peace'
that it gives me.  I don't think of it as a habit as I do fo cigarettes
which I gave up 15 years ago.

  I've never smoked the Merschuams because they're almost works of
art.  I usually buy estate pipes that've been refurbished on pipes
in the clearance bin for 1/2 price.  My favorite is a Savenelli.
I tend to like pipes with a slight curve as I can hold them in my mouth
easier with out fatiguing my jaws.

  As for tobacco, I've settled in with an aromatic type blend(Captain
Black to start).  Today, after one day of subscribing to the newsgroup,
I bought an English type blend.

  I now buy my tobacco an Ed's Tinder Box(2729 Wilshire Blvd., Santa Monica
CA  90403).  It's the original of a franchise that has since broken with
it's offspring for being too 'commercial'.  They provide good consule
and even free samples and free bowls with a new pipe.

  Thanks again for the Resource Guide.  I'd also like to request back
issues of the digest, if that's possible, which I read about in the
alt.smokers.pipes newsgroup.

<a name="16">Subject: How to Make Your Own Credo Humidifier!</a>

Yes! A Homemade Credo Humidifier!

I could go out and buy a Rondo or Credo Precision 70 humidifier, but my Dad
brought me up to respect "inventing, modifying, and tinkering."  I have done
my research and have come up with a homemade version of the Credo system.  I
began looking at the various humidifiers and found that the best ones Credo,
Rondo, and even the ones you find in the really nice Savinelli humidors, used
a material that I recognized.  It finally dawned on me that they were using
the same material that florist shops were using for flower arrangements!
 That foam like material inside these units, is known commercially as Oasis.
 It comes in different varieties (wet-dry-etc.), but you want the "wet"
style, which happens to be green and costs about .98 cents for a huge
rectangular block. This stuff holds a tremendous amount of water, it is
incredible.  I bought a 1 gallon jug of distilled water awhile ago to have
around for my motorcycle battery, this cost me .98 cents. Why spend $4.00 on
a small bottle of distilled water at the tobacconist?

Now we need a container. The best container for this homemade contraption is
a "Bering Imperial" aluminum cigar tube. This tube is nice because the end
cap is plastic and snaps on tightly. Instead of the screw-off type (which
might leak). Here comes the fun part. First you have to smoke the cigar that
came in the tube! Bearable! So much for that. Find one of those plastic push
pins that's used on corkboards to hold notes (color doesn't matter.) Use this
push pin to start punching a series of holes into the tube. I did mine in
straight lines only up one side of the tube similar to this crude
illustration which follows. Think of the open paren as the bottom of the
tube, the bracket as the cap, &amp; the colons as the holes. ( :::::::: ]  This
way as the tube lays in with the humidor with the "naked" cigars, the holes
are only on the top half portion of the tube and there are no holes on the
bottom or sides to let water out. So if you were to take the tube and look
into it, the holes would run down the tube lengthwise in the 10 to 2 o'clock
area. Can you vision it now? Then take a knife and cut a long thin square off
of the Oasis foam, wittle it down until it fits comfortably in the tube.  Or
just run the tube down into the foam. Wet it down with the distilled water.
Distilled water is more mold resistant. There you go! One to two of these
will treat a large humidor perfectly, depending on where you live.

Here's a great variation. I have a three finger cigar case "Romeo Y Julieta."
I took one of those tubes and punched two 1/4 inch strips of holes, one up
each side, and I started an inch from the bottom. This way if I put it in the
center slot of the case, the two sides with holes point to the cigars on
either side of it. A traveling humidor! Better than the one Humidif makes. I
only used a small slice of sponge foam in this - it doesn't need that much
moisture.

For a large can of pipe tobacco like 200grams or more, you can use a 35mm
film plastic canister. Punch holes in the gray plastic lid and cut out a core
of Oasis for the can. Set it in with the tobacco.

If you want to create the perfect solution to treat your humidifier every two
months, try to locate some glycerin from a drug store, and mix it with your
distilled water. Play with the ratio, starting with very, very little at
first. The glycerin holds the moisture longer.

Hope this is FUN for you,
Steve Banks aka "???????@???.???

[ GREAT detective work, Steve! Thanks! -S. ]

<a name="17">Subject: Pipes Mailgroup </a>

Steve,

Some random thoughts from the Boston Area on Ehrlichs and Leavitt &amp; Pierce
and how times have changed.

In reading through the back issues of the Mailgroup, I have seen many
references to Ehrlichs and its sister store Leavitt &amp; Pierce as the stores
where many members purchased their first pipes.  For those of you not from
the Boston area, Ehrlichs is in downtown Boston, while L&amp;P is located across
from Harvard Yard, and up the street from MIT.  Over the years both shops
have introduced people to the world of pipes, including me.  Ehrlichs dates
its founding to 1868, and L&amp;P to some later date.

I bought my first pipe from L&amp;P in 1965, and therein lies the story for
today.  Back then both stores sold their own pipes, with only a few pipes
from other makers like Dunhill and Peterson.  Many of the pipes for sale were
made outside the shop, but in the front window of Ehrlichs was a man named
George Bushey who made pipes on the premises, as well as repairing pipes
which had met with accidents.  In the 1960's, the house lineup of pipes, from
best to worst ran something like this:

     Straight Grains     Flawless straight grain Algerian briar       $25.00
     Algerian Briar      Flawless Algerian, grain other than straight $20.00?
     Select              Aged Algerian briar, good grain         $17.50?
     Harvard (H)         Good aged Briar                    $15.00
     ?              Some small pits, average grain          $12.50
     ?              Novelty Pipes (Leather clad, etc.)      $10.00
     ?              Straight grain seconds, major fills          $ 3.85

My first pipe was in the last group.  It was and is, an aged Algerian briar
with beautiful grain marred by a major fill on the right side.  The putty is
about 3/8's of an inch across and extends through the briar up to the rim.  A
wonderful pipe to look at from one side: a tragedy to view from the other.  I
was persuaded to buy it by the wise old man running the shop as a way of
getting to know the joys of pipes without spending a fortune on a pipe.  Back
then a straight grain at $25.00 was about a third of one's net take home pay
for a recent grad of any of the colleges around, and a fortune for a student.
 He was right, and I have enjoyed the pipe throughout the years.  It smokes
cool, always giving a pleasant smoke without fuss.  I broke the stem (not the
tenon), had a new mortise made and refitted the stem, refilled the putty hole
once, and in general kept it with me for almost thirty years.

Back in 1965, a year after the famous Surgeon General's report on smoking
which found pipes smokers having no greater chance of cancer than non smokers
pipes were all the rage for people switching from cigarettes.  When you went
into L&amp;P, their forty foot long display cases were filled with pipes of all
price ranges.  If you did not see anything which you liked, you asked to see
what was in the drawers behind the counters, and they brought out three or
four times the number already on display.  Most were of their own make.  The
store had a catalogue it put out several times a year listing its pipes by
grades, showing different shapes, listing twenty or thirty custom tobaccos
and other good stuff.  

I have continued to go to both stores over the years.  The changes in them
are a measure of what is happening to our hobby.  About fifteen years ago,
they ceased to have extra pipes in the back drawers to bring out to show you
if you did not like what was in the display cases. Straight grains continued
to be $25.00 and the top of the line, but by then some of them had small pits
(the Select grade of above) and they were still $25.00 By then, twenty five
dollars was the cost of a good dinner for one, not a third of one's take home
pay.  Pipes made by others were perhaps 50% of the pipes on display.  They
were mostly Petersons and Dunhills, priced at twice to four times Ehrlichs
house name.  The table of seconds had risen to $7.95 or so, and they were no
longer only straight grain seconds, but also seconds of average grain.

By the end of 1993, the top of the line was no longer straight grain but was
Algerian briar. 
Some small pits in the grain, most of the grain tight, but straight grains
were hard to find. 
When you did find a straight grain it was comparable to or lesser than an
Upshall second.  Still $25.00, but now twenty five dollars was the cost of
movie for two, with popcorn and a soda.  Only a third of the pipes in the
store were house brands, and pipes were then a third of the shop with wine
another third and cigars the remaining third.  Pipes from people other than
the house brands included Upshall (Dunhill put their own store in Boston, and
that seems to be the only outlet for this brand), Ser Jacapo, Peterson and
American.  Once and awhile there are some estate pipes from an old customer.
 ( American is an interesting side bar.  As I understand the story, George
Bushey had an apprentice in the late 70's early 80's named Steve Johnson.
 Steve turned out some beautiful pipes in Boston (freehands many of them),
and then moved to Pennsylvania.  He continued to make pipes there through the
1980's, teaming up with someone whose initials are MT.  MT continued on with
the American line while Steve went to NY and eventually left the business.
 American continues on with pipes distinguished by their curved shapes, and
stems which never discolor and seldom get teeth marks.) 

Earlier this year the top of the line for house brands was still $25.00, but
the top of the line for other brands was Upshall P's at $225.00 retail while
others in the city had Upshall P's for $175.00 and routinely discounted off
the $175.00 price.  Ehrlichs only went on sale once or twice a year off the
$225.00 price.  The catalogue was gone- replaced by a mere listing of the
blends they sold.

Last month I visited and another major break had taken place.  Top of the
line house brands had ceased to be Algerian briars,  The top of the line went
from $25.00 to $50.00, a doubling.  Instead of old, tight Algerian grain the
top is now good grain, oil finish, few pits, briar from unknown places.  The
house lines have shrunk to three grades,  top of the line at $50.00, lesser
grains at $37.50, and seconds at $17.95.  House brands are now less than
twenty percent of the pipes, and pipes are twenty percent of the store.  Wine
is another twenty percent, and cigars are the remaining sixty percent.  Gone
is the lathe in the window for fixing pipes in house and all of the repairs
are shipped out, probably to MT, based on the type of stems they come back
with.       

I tell the store to illustrate the changes going on in the world of pipes.
 While I have not been to pipe stores in many cities outside Boston, I have
the sense from reading the Mailgroup that it has parallels in New York,
Chicago and other areas.  Anyone care to comment on their favorite local
store gone by the wayside, taking with it the local brand names we started
out with, leaving us with a few names to chose from like Dunhill, Upshall,
Ser Jacapo, Castello and the others?  I for one miss the days of the local
maker with his own idiosyncratic shapes and grains.  How about the rest of
you?

Smoke in peace

my fears of attempts to hose the list just haven't materialized, so
that's not a concern. What say you, members?

And, as we contemplate this weighty issue, join us for, perhaps, some
MacBaren's "Golden Extra" as we discuss earthquakes, the Motor City
and its Canadian Connection, shag, and the pipes that got away...

Steve,

	i was wondering if you'd consider putting all the old pipe
	digests on a mosaic server somewhere.  if you don't have
	access to one, i could volunteer mine.  i'm on the list and
	love all the information that comes on it and think it'd be
	great to spread the word via mosaic.

	just an idea,

<a name="3">Subject: RE: Pipes Digest #153 -- August 15, 1994</a>

Greetings all!  Although I have not contributed much lately, I have been
reading faithfully, but I noticed something in #153 made me want to share a
story.

I noticed that someone mentioned Peretti.

&gt;For everyday, I smoke JT Cooke or Bob Peretti's ( some
&gt;which were actually made by his grandfater ) along with a group of
&gt;briarcrafts that Ves made very early in his career, which he collected for
&gt;me from some of his old customers. 

I was a Californian until a few years ago, at which time I moved to Boulder
Co.  I am an avid pipe smoker, and used to get my tobacco from Ed's Tobacco
in Northridge Ca.  The owner of Ed's is Roy.  He is a great tobacconist,
and he has a wonderful non-aromatic blend called Mr. Franklin.  It is in
the strong English tobacco style, lots of perique (sp?) and latakia.  But
he ordered his latakia from England.  It was quite mellow and a delicious
smoke with a wonderful warm nuttiness and full body that was unmatched by
anything I've had.  It came in at a hefty $3/oz., and he even made the same
blend using non-England latakia for a much more reasonable price.  Well,
when I moved to Boulder I looked for a tobacconist.  Well, there is NO
tobacconist in Boulder, but there is a News and Smoke shop.  Nice humidor
and cigar collection, yet nothing but MacBarens, Borkum Riff, and
Copenhagen!  I made a last visit to Ed's Tobacco and found to my delight
that they did mail order! I was saved.  Then it happened.  Maybe some of
you noticed that Ed's is in Northridge, Ca.  The same Northridge that was
devastated by earthquake earlier this year.  In fact, if you watched the TV
coverage you saw the shopping center he was in.  Behind that shopping
center was the train that derailed, and across the street was the
Northridge Mall that collapsed.  I frantically phoned Ed's a few days
later...no reply.  In fact, no reply for weeks!!  Withdrawal symptoms began
to appear, and my supply of tobacco dwindled to the fine flakes that
remained at the bottom of my tobacco pouch (which I keep in a slipper - but
THAT'S another story).  It was clear that I was experiencing a tobacco
winter!  And just when I thought things were bleakest and could get no
worse, I was sent to Nashua New Hampshire on a business trip!  There is
nothing worse for me than to travel without tobacco!  In Winter.  It was a
bitter pill, and I knew that I had angered some regional god.  To be in 
New England, in winter (the wonderful gray skies, the moody countryside),
without my favorite pipe smoke.  Only you, my friends, know my downcast
condition as I boarded the plane.  When the flight attendant asked me if
there was anything she could do, I just looked up and said "why bother?" 
The only thing I had to look forward to was visiting a friend who lived
between Nashua and Boston.  I brought some cigars with me for the trip, (I
love cigars - Macanudos, Avos, Aliados, Hoyos - all the "os" cigars) but
cigars in winter are just not the same; am I right?  After several lean
days enduring the work portion of my visit, my friend said she'd take me
into Boston to cheer me up, to a restaurant that allows men and women to
smoke cigars - Bibas (on the Commons).  We parked my rental car at a subway
station, and got off at the wrong stop.  So, we had to walk a little bit. 
As we neared Bibas I caught the smell of a cigar.  But there was no one on
the streets (a bitter, chill wind reflecting my inner state had essentially
chased the happier element indoors).  My friend grabbed my arm, and
pointing said "the smell is coming from that shop over there" I looked, and
there on a corner was a little tobacco shop called Peretti's.  We walked
in, and I judged it immediately as a little hole-in-the-wall.  There were
people milling about two counters - one with cigars displayed, and another
with a wall of pipe tobacco containers.  One could tell without lessons
that many of these people were regulars since they were making no move to
purchase anything.  We all know if a tobacco shop is good by the
interaction of the regulars.  I perked up a little and thought to try a new
cigar.  The fella behind the counter asked me what I like, and when I said
I love Macanudos, he shot back with "Macanudos?!  They're like smokin'
fresh air!"  I tolerated this salvo, and after some technical discussion, I
bought a couple Sosa Torpedos, and mused out loud that what I really was in
want of was my favorite pipe tobacco.  The fella behind the other counter
asked me what I smoke.  I described Mr. Franklin.  In a voice somewhat
gruffer than you'd expect, he said "try this, it's probably stronger than
you like, but it's delicious".  I looked about me.  The regulars had
stopped chatting, and all eyes were upon me.  I know what they were
thinking.  They were taking me for a greenhorn.  It gave me great pleasure
to produce my Savinelli from out my overcoat, along with my calibri
tamper/lighter.  I filled my bowl slowly.  No one moved.  I shot a steely
glance at my gruff host and, with a sharp flick that was intended to sting,
I lit my pipe.  I puffed slow generous billows of smoke.  Made tasting
noises with my tongue and lips.  "Hm.  What manner of blend is this?", I
inquired.  "Midnight".  "It's delicious", I said.  "I told you it was" he
replied.  In short, my friends, it was OUT OF THIS WORLD!  Dark black
tobacco, unrelieved by even a shade of dark brown.  As full bodied as
anything I've tried.  Warm, the flavor came up to greet me like an old
friend.  Suddenly there was a feeling of wellbeing.  The regulars beamed
their approval.  I mentioned what had happened to Ed's Tobacco in
Northridge, and two of the regulars even knew of the place!  "We're sorry
for your trouble", said one kindly soul.  I was among civilized society.  I
bought 2 ounces to take away, along with their mail-order catalog. 
Emboldened, I strode into the street towards Biba's.  What a wonderful
wonderful place, that Peretti's, I mused.  What a wonderful wonderful city
is Boston to have a Peretti's.  And what a wonderful wonderful place was
Bibas! Sumptuous dinner, wonderful bar with a wide variety of single-malt
Scotch whisky.  And my friend and I sat down afterwards and smoked our
Sosas - which were quite tasty (yes SHE likes a cigar too) - to the
accompanying strains of a couple Lagavulins.  The flight home next day was
a glaring contrast to my earlier one.  After a few days, I ordered a pound
of Midnight from Peretti's, and it's my favorite smoke now.  There's no
telling what you might find when YOU are lost in an interesting city, and
there's no people, like pipe people, I always say.

Some other time I'll have to tell you what happened to Ed's Tobacco.

Good smoking to you!

	I'm glad I'm still receiving criticism about errors in the text 
file I posted some time back. Glad to know people read and care enough to 
correct my misteaks :)
	I was in Detroit last week and couldn't resist a smuggling trip 
across the nasty waters of the Detroit River into Windsor Canada to try 
out some Cuban cigars.  After paying $1.75 and answering stupid questions 
about my occupation, nationality, weather or not I had person protection 
devices (rubbers???) in my vehicle I found myself in Canada. Well few 
people you ask directions from in Canada are actually from there, but I 
soon found myself (and my sister with me) at the House Of Habana cigar 
shop 15 minutes before closing time.
	The shop is typically beautiful as most good tobacco shops are. 
Beautifully prepared wood works everywhere one turns. A strangely exotic 
and very beautiful woman who was built like a brick tobaccoist's 
shop, greeted us with pad and paper and helped us choose some cigars to 
sample.  My sister purchased one that was packaged in one of those tubes. 
I purchased two unwrapped ones myself myself.  One of the cigars was the 
best damn cigar I've ever smoked. Another was pretty damn good, and the 
final one that my sister bought in the tin was just your average cigar. 
I shared the cigars with my sister. Her friend used to run a cigar shop 
and said that half her customers used to be women belive it or not.  I 
wonder if they are any pipe smokers of the fair sex as well.

	Questions?
		What's the best way to clean an old used pipe you find
		like at a garage sale. Wooden or mershaum.
		
		Are there female pipe smokers out there?

[ To the first question, I'd suggest boiling with alcohol and buffing
with carnauba wax; I remember seeing details somewhere on how to do
the former, but can't put my finger on where I saw it at the
moment. Readers? To the second, there are a few right here on this

Steve, A message in the most recent digest discussed Ehrlich's in Boston 
and how it had changed (and indeed it has), but in passing the writer 
mentioned American Pipes and MT.  Americans are sold all over the DC 
area.  I've met MT several times at some of the local shops.  His name is 
Mark Tinsley.  He's a hell of a nice guy and a dedicated craftsman.  He 
also does most of the pipe repairs for the DC area shops and has done an 
excellent and inexpensive job on some treasured pipes of mine, including 
a $450 Ser Jacobo.

The American Pipes range from about $70 to hundreds, but they are 
comparable to pipes costing twice as much.  He does a tremendous variety 
of shapes and will sometimes do particular shapes to order.  If you see 
one of Mark's pipes for sale, and you like the shape, buy it.  You won't 
be sorry.  Among other things, I've never seen a fill or pit on any of 
his pipes.

Someone else asked about a vanilla cavendish.  One I highly recommend is 
available from most independent pipe shops.  It will have a different 
name at each shop, but it is distributed by Lane's and is labelled by the 
distributor as "1Q."  If you ask any pipe shop, they'll know what you are 
talking about.  A variation on that blend that I particularly enjoy is 
also usually found at most independent shops. It's Lane's HGL.  It is an 
English tobacco with Latakia, but it also has a vanilla casing.  Tastes 
great, and some people like the smell almost as much as a cavendish.

Hello Steve...

I apologize for the delay in getting back to you...busy, busy, busy.  Anyhow,
thank you for your mailings of the Pipe Digest.  It's great to be part of the
pipe-smoking community.

You wanted to know a little about by myself and my relationship with pipes. 
Now a full-bearded 36-year old, I've been "into" pipes for as long as I can
remember.  Since I was a 'wee lad', I bonded onto pipes and the association of
a full-beard with a pipe.  After years of exploration and experimentation, I
have finally found my love in pipes--the Sherlock Holmes Collection (which I've
just started to collect).  I'm always looking for the larger 'Sherlock-type'
used pipe, so if anyone has these in their collection (and no longer want/need
them), please contact me.  I smoke a commercial brand of pipe-tobacco--Amphora
Full Aroma...it seems to be the one-and-only for me.  But, again, if anyone can
recommend a brand with a similar full aroma, I'd appreciate your suggestions.

Thanks for the letter.  Boston has changed over the years.  How about the UK?
 My first "good pipe" was an Astley, not Ashton, from 109 Jermyn Street.  I
am told it may have been made private label by Upshall as the mouth piece is
the same curve as an Upshall.  Have you tried them, and are they still in
business? 

It is not my pipe you found near BU, although my wife did go there, earlier
than 1979.  You do raise a subject I have been thinking about lately though,
that is memories of the pipes that got away, either because they were left
somewhere, or one did not buy them with the intent of returning later, only
to find them gone.

Your Pipes Digest is just great. So much fun!

I am fairly new to pipe smoking. I smoked cigars (about one or two a week)
for the past four years, and got interested in pipes after I subscribed to
your digest. Now, I own a Calabash, a almost-pre-transition Barling, a
Savinelli Autograph estate pipe, a couple of nice BC's, a Charatan Canadian,
a Hardcastle, and a newer Savinelli. I am addicted to buying and collecting
pipes and tobak, but I'm not sorry!

A thought or two on recruiting new pipesters: pipe smoking takes practice
and desire. I haven't yet gotten anyone to try a pipe, but I think I will,
because lots of folks around here smoke cigs and love the pipe aroma. Almost
everyone I've met who smokes cigs doesn't like their habit and is starting
to want to try a pipe. But it is frustrating to the novice and without the
desire, I think they'll be too prone to give up before really getting into it.

On another subject: blending tobaccos. My question is this. Where are there
any recipes for tobak? I've got the Weber book which gives some vague
suggestions, and I've got Hacker, who doesn't talk about blending much at
all. Are there people who blend there own? What recipes are they willing to
share? Lots of people have asked about flavoring, but what's the upshot?
Anyone got a good system for flavoring a plain Cavendish?

<a name="15">Subject: Tobacco types and blends</a>

<a name="16">Subject: Tobacco types and blends.</a>
Intended for The Smokers Digest.

I have noticed some discussion lately, in the Digest, about different
tobacco types and blends. I feel it might be appropriate to write a
small article, in which i will try to describe the different types
of tobacco, and how they are used in various pipe tobacco blends.
My background for writing this comes from reading numerous books about
the subject, and from having smoked, i guess, around 300 different
tobacco blends. Mainly English and Danish blends (i live in Denmark).

The tobacco types -

Virginia:
Virginia type tobacco is the far most used tobacco type in pipe
tobacco today. It is grown in most parts of the world. Zimbabwe, Brazil,
North &amp; South Carolina and Georgia being the producers of the highest
quality at the moment.
Virginia tobacco is known for its high content of dextrose (sugar),
which basicly gives you a sweet taste. For a non flavoured tobacco,
that is. The nicotine content can vary from 1 to 3.5 %. 2 % being the
average.
After the harvest the leaves are hung in barns to dry. The barns are
heated for about 3-5 days. This processing is called 'flue cured', which
is also the technical term for Virginia tobacco. After the leaves has
regained some humidity from the air, they are sold. Further treatment
is done by the raw-tobacco dealers. Here the leaves are 'aged' for 1-2
years and stripped for their stalks. Before selling they are sorted by
color and quality. This makes the raw material for pipe tobacco 
manufacturers.
Pure Virginia tobacco is best known from flake types. Dunhill's Light
Flake is a very good try here. Medium strength and rather sweet in taste.
Several blends by Rattray comes into mind also. Marlin Flake being a
rather 'heavy' member of the family. But still very sweet.
The Danish manufacturer A&amp;C Petersen has the Blue Caledonian. Mild to
medium in strength, and a nice pure taste of Virginia tobacco.

Burley:
Burley tobacco is the next largest tobacco for pipe tobacco blending.
The nicotine content is between 1.5 and 4.5 %. It contains almost no
sugar, which gives a much dryer and full aroma than Virginia.
I think Burley means something like big, solid and stout, which is a
rather precise description of the taste.
Main growers of Burley are Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina,
Virginia and Missouri. But also Mexico and Malawi must be considered.
The technical term for Burley is 'air cured'. This air curing is done
in large open barns, by the natural air flow, for one or two months.
The Burley is also matured, stripped and sorted by the raw-tobacco
company. The color is ranging from light brown to mahogany.
Pure Burley blends are mainly produced by US and Danish companies.
Blends like Blue Edgeworth, Old English and Half-and-Half are classic
examples. The latter being slightly flavoured.
Burley is also the main ingredient in most of the Danish McBaren blends.

Spice tobacco:
Spice tobacco is actually not one type of tobacco, rather than a broad
variaty of more 'special' types, used in small amounts to create an
interesting blend. Here we find Oriental, Latakia, Perique and
Kentucky among others. Most of them are frequently used in English
type blends, also called mixtures.

Oriental:
Again a variaty of tobaccos, grown in Turkey, the Balkans, Russia and
around. The best known types are Izmir, Samsun, Yedidje, Cavella and
Bursa. A common characteristic is a dusty, dry and sometimes slightly
sourish aroma. Some of them are also used in 'exotic' cigarettes from
Egypt and other Arab countrys.

Latakia:
Probably the most well known spice tobacco. Mainly grown in Cyprus
nowadays. After the leaves are harvested and dried, they are hung in tightly
closed barns and smoke-cured. Small smouldering fires of oak and pine
are filling the barn with smoke, and covering the leaves with smoke
particles. This curing can take up to two months.
The myth, telling that this curing is done over camel manure might have
been true in ancient days. It is definitely not the case today. But it
makes a good story, ey ?
The aroma of Latakia is, quite naturally, very smoked and unique, i prefer
to call it. I love the taste and also the aroma from others smoke, but
non-smokers tend not to. It is honestly quite characteristic, to say the
least.
Latakia is an indispensable ingredient of the traditional English
mixture. The content can vary from a few percent to about 40-50%, or
even more. Some (few) smokers like it at 100%. A bit harsh i would say.
Not because Latakia is a strong tobacco, but it has a pitful burn and tend
to dry out your mouth and throat.
Excellent blends with Latakia comes the Dunhill and Rattray. My Mixture
965, Early Morning and London Mixture from D., and Red Rapperee and Black
Mallory from R. are among my favourites. Seven (7) Reserve from R. has
a moderate content of Latakia, and might be a good introduction to this
kind of blends. Bengal Slices is unique - a flake tobacco with a moderate
to high content of Latakia. A very lovely blend if you like Latakia.

Perique:
Like Latakia, perique is a quite peculiar product. It is exclusively
grown in a tiny region of the southern Louisiana near Mississippi.
The production is small; less than 100000 kg per year, and the prize
is high.
During the growing season the upper part of the plant is cut off, just
leaving about 10 leaves on each plant. The remaining leaves will then
become more concentrated in taste and nicotine content. Perique is cured
like Burley, but for a shorter time. There after the leaves are put
in large oak barrels under heavy pressure, which will squeeze some
juice out and make the whole thing ferment. Once in a while the leaves
are taken out for a period and then repacked and refermented. This
process takes at least one full year. Some times even longer.
The aroma of a tobacco treated by this method is round and full
bodied. Not penetrating like Latakia. Actually rather difficult to
describe. The nicotine content is overwhelming. Perique can not be
smoked by itself. Try it if you like. Two minutes and you are knocked
out. Therefor it is used very limited in blends. 5 % in a blend is about
the maximum. It is usually applyed to Virginia blends to give more body.
Escudo is a good representative of a Virginia blend with perique.

Kentucky:
This is actually a specially treated Burley tobacco, produced in - you
guessed right - Kentucky (and Malawi). It is, unlike Burley, fire-cured.
In Kentucky called dark-cured. The smoked aroma is not as marked as
for Latakia, but very aromatic and unique. The nicotine content tends
to be rather high, and the use therefor limited in amount.
Dutch cigarette tobacco like Drum and Samson Sware contains some Kentucky.
African Kentucky is sometimes used to spice Virginia blends.

Havana:
Cuban and other cigar tobaccos are used in a limited range of Virginia
blends and mixtures.

Cavendish:
Cavendish was originally 'developed' by English tobacco firms. It is more
a method to treat tobacco than a type.
Cavendish can be produced out of any tobacco type (mainly Virginia's and
Burley's are used).
The original English Cavendish is produced out of Virginia tobacco,
which is slightly flavoured and either heated by high pressure or on
copper pans. Or both. This will give you a very dark / black product.
A few English Cavendish blends exist on the market - Rattray's Dark Fragrant
and Black Virginia plus McConnel's Maduro.
The modern version of Cavendish is generally much more flavoured. The natural
taste of tobacco is almost gone. The flavouring is probably better described
as casing, in most cases. This is the term used when you add a considerable
amount of additives to the tobacco. This is usually done by producing a
fluid mixture of sugar, liquorice or any kind of aromas in which the
tobacco is soaked. The goal is to produce a sweet and smooth aroma.
Modern Cavendish tobacco comes in numerous flavours. Cherry, vanilla,
chocolate, strawberry, Irish coffee .... You name it.
Not my kind of mixture. I like tobacco (sorry).
Modern Cavendish tend to be very popular in the US and Germany. The
market is growing in most countrys all over the world.

Enough about the tobacco for now. I hope this will be an inspiration to
try something else than your everyday blend.
Happy smoking.

have an apropos Snappy Comeback for it too!) I hope you'll forgive
Your Moderator for not being too loquatious this Digest, as he's full
of muscle relaxant (unfortunately, not the single-malt kind :-) for a
back spasm. So let's exert the minimum of labor as we just sit back,
light up, and discuss Mosaic, killer Louisiana megaterbacky, the
Seattle scene, the possibly-world's-only pipe-friendly B&amp;B, oil and
water, Zen, and the beach...

&gt; Steve, A message in the most recent digest discussed Ehrlich's in Boston 
&gt; and how it had changed (and indeed it has), but in passing the writer 
&gt; mentioned American Pipes and MT.  Americans are sold all over the DC 
&gt; area.  I've met MT several times at some of the local shops.  His name is 
&gt; Mark Tinsley.  He's a hell of a nice guy and a dedicated craftsman.  He 
&gt; also does most of the pipe repairs for the DC area shops and has done an 
&gt; excellent and inexpensive job on some treasured pipes of mine, including 
&gt; a $450 Ser Jacobo.
&gt; 
&gt; The American Pipes range from about $70 to hundreds, but they are 
&gt; comparable to pipes costing twice as much.  He does a tremendous variety 
&gt; of shapes and will sometimes do particular shapes to order.  If you see 
&gt; one of Mark's pipes for sale, and you like the shape, buy it.  You won't 
&gt; be sorry.  Among other things, I've never seen a fill or pit on any of 
&gt; his pipes.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; [ Thanks for the report, Rick! Do you have Mark Tinsley's whereabouts? -S. ]
&gt; 
&gt; 

He lives somewhere in Pennsylvania.  He does at least one show a year at 
John B. Hayes Tobacco in the Fair Oaks Mall in Fairfax county, VA (my 
favorite tobacconist's).  I'll ask John for Mark's address the next time 
I go in there.  John's is the best place in the DC area to hang out and 
smoke a pipe, IMHO.  When John isn't presiding over his shop or off on 
one of his frequent Alaskan fishing trips, he's a fishing guide on the 
Potomac River.  It's a great place for cordial smoking and pleasant 
conversation.

	Somebody suggested 'boiling old pipes in alcohol'. Is this 
traditional proven practice? Something about heating up alcohol to the 
point of boiling sounds pretty dumb to me. Besides the fire hazard it 
seems that emersion would warp the wood. Could somebody clarify the art 
of really cleaning up old pipes for me?

	And as for Moasic NOT NOT NOT! Windows is a pig. It's good for 
some things but I really don't need the headache of waiting for anything. 
Windows doesn't care if you have to wait. The thing I don't like about 
graphic based system operation is that I can type out 50 commands on my 
keyboard in the time it takes to dig my mouse out from underneath papers, 
and carefully try to point the thing exactly where I want it. Maybe in 
the future, but a Moasic conversion would do nothing exciting for me. I 
guess I could scratch my butt waiting for dull graphics to download but I 
think it's really over-rated. I guess it would be cool to have pictures 
of some things sometimes though, but things aren't quite up to snuff yet 
to get me excited about moasic one bit.  The fonts in DOS are a lot 
easier on my eyes too. I have yet to see a windows font and text display 
that didn't give me a headache after a while. I read and write extremely 
fast.  People who are excited by Moasic are the same guys who thought the 
messiah had arrived when they showed me the talking parrot program they 
got with their sound blaster. Moasic might be a good compliment for some 
folks, but I'd rather see other text based improvements first in internet 
stuff.  Moasic fans; all the power to you, but I'm not impressed. Just my 
humble opinon since I was asked.

Love the digest, but where are the cigar smokers. I am a cigar novice and
although I don't have any interesting anecdotes I'm sure you guys (and
gals??) can help me with some questions.
1.  What is the right humidity to store cigars to keep them fresh?
2. Is it necessary to keep the cigars at a certain temperature or in a
certain range of temps?  If so what temperatures?

sorry about forgetting to post my name when subscribing.

&gt; From: Ib Fagerlund &lt;??@?????.???.??.???&gt;
&gt; Subject: Tobacco types and blends
&gt; Perique:
&gt; Like Latakia, perique is a quite peculiar product. It is exclusively
&gt; grown in a tiny region of the southern Louisiana near Mississippi.
&gt; The production is small; less than 100000 kg per year, and the prize
&gt; is high.

I really enjoyed Ib's article, and learned quite a lot about tobacco from
it.  I just have a very minor correction:  Perique is grown only in  St.
James Parish, Louisiana.  This is on the banks of the Mississippi River, not
near the state of Mississippi.

There was an article in the New Orleans Times-Picayune a while back about
the production of perique.  Most of the farmers who grow and cure perique
are quite old, and they are having a hard time getting any younger people
interested in growing tobacco.  The production of perique has declined in
recent years, and it may become impossible to find in the not-too-distant
future.  Let's hope that some tobacco growers manage to keep it alive.

<a name="9">Subject: introduction</a>

Hello, my name is Patrick Popeck and I am a new member of this
newsletter.  In the last issue I was confirmed;  I took the
name "Dottle" :)

I am 29 years of age, and I have smoked pipes for 16 years.  My

grandfather was a pipesmoker.  I have never smoked cigarettes
and I rarely smoke cigars.

Pipemakers that I prefer are: Peterson, Savanelli and a local
guy named Bob Story (local to Ohio, USA).  I like the poker
and Canadian pipe styles, but I do smoke some bents.  My
favorite pipes are a Sherlock Holmes' Original, a Mark Twain,
and a Savanelli poker.  The latter pipe is amazing as it burns
cool, looks great and sits flat for easy use;  this pipe is a
good friend.

A comment on Perique, noted in the last issue by Ib Fagerlund.
When I was in college, a Marine friend and I smoked full
bowls of 100% Perique.  We were rugged pipe guys (read idiots)
and we did not believe the lore about the tobacco.  After a
half-bowl, we were sweating profusely, and my skin got very
clammy.  When we finished, I got up, went to my dorm room
and slept for three hours.  Upon awakening, I felt sick 
and my back hurt!  Needless to say, we had a new-found
respect for that Louisiana tobacco.

I agree with many people in this group who expound on the 
spiritual aspect of pipesmoking.  I find that when I get
to smoke I can feel myself relax and focus.  Call it the
Zen of pipes, but I relish my smoking time each day.

Finally, I also like this ritual because it brings people
of all ages and classes together.  I've smoked with 
professors, construction workers, priests and janitors. I
always make it a point to say "hello" when I see a pipe
smoker and I have been beaten to the "howdy" by people who
have seen me smoking.

And yes, I have a full beard. :) (my smoking predates any
sort of beard, though.)

And I bid you goodnight!

Steve,

Sorry this is so long in comming, life has been busy here, (isn't it
always), and I've just now gotten around to really going through the
digests.  So, without further procrastination, my intro.

..................

Since everyone else has been so diligent about writing their introduction
bio, I thought I had better get around to doing mine.

I'm a 27 year old freshman advisor at Seattle University.  My hobby's
include weight training, reading (primarily sci/fi), and graphic design.  
So, game show introductions aside :), I've always had an avid fascination for
pipes and smoked one fairly regularly in college but allowed myself to be
peer pressured out of it when I left school.  (Pipe smoking is *not*
particularly appriciated amongst young, gay, bodybuilders), But always kept my
pipes and was sort of a "closet afficinado".

I've recently began to get back into pipes via a friend who smokes them
and cigars, but am still am wavering on the edge between my real enjoyment
of the pipes and that instinctive human need to "fit it". (Yeah, so I'm a
wimp).  Seattle's pipe smoking community seems to be a fairly small and
hidden one, anyone know of any pipe clubs in the area?

Anyhow, enough prattling on.  Hello to everyone on the list, its a great
celebration of a great art and I look forward to reading more.

I just read in Cigar Aficionado Magazine that cigars dry out not only because
of the moisture ( water ) content of the cigar being wicked away, but also
because of oils that are dried up ( and can't be replaced. My question to all
who are in the know is:  1)   Does the same principle apply to pipe tobacco
and 2)   is there a way, when I am in the tobacco store and before I purchse
the pipe tobacco, to tell if it is too dry and if it has lost these "
essential " oils.

<a name="13">Subject: Second try</a>

Hi Steve,

I have just finished reading my second issue of Pipes Digest and
thoroughly enjoyed it.  Please keep them coming.  Thanks especially
for the resources you sent along with my first "Digest" #154.  It will
certainly come in handy when next I travel (previous searches for pipe
shops in foreign cities have always been something of a craps shoot.)
Perhaps in time I may be able to add a few as on occasion I have been
pleasantly surprised.  In your letter you asked that I pass on a bit
of information about myself and my pipe smoking preferences.  I first
started smoking a pipe at 14 and then stopped, picking it up again at
20.  My first pipe was a Peterson's .  When I resumed at age 20 I was
in my fourth year at McGill .  Despite living on a very meager
student's budget I bought the occasional pipe at a Montreal pipe shop
named Blatter Brothers.  In addition to carrying a wide range of
Petersons , BC and other brand name pipes that were entirely out of my
price range, they also had their own line of hand carved pipes .  On
special occasions (read , the day the student loans arrived) I would
indulge myself and buy one of the less expensive of these.  I have
smoked a pipe continuously since then , that is for the last 20 years.
My first tobacco was a MacBarens product , however in retrospect I do
remember occasionally smoking some English blends. (One that was
particularly pleasing as I remember back was a John ??? Ayelsbury
Special).  It came to pass that after my 12 years as a student at
McGill I finally was able to take a real vacation and at the time
decided to treat myself to a tin of Dunhill tobacco.  I did this with
the full understanding that such luxuries were only to be indulged in
when I was on vacation.  I probably smoked London mixture almost
exclusively for the next 7 or 8 years.  Then realizing how much I
liked their tobacco the next logical step was to try one of their
pipes (don't you agree?)  Today I have a collection of about a hundred
pipes and amongst my favorite 30 or 40 are about 15 Dunhills.  Others
include Barlings, Saesinis, Comoys, Perettis .... and also a few
"English Seconds" that I used to buy in Paul Coleman's shop on trips
to Burlington, Vermont.  At this same shop in the very early 1980's I
also bought 2 or 3 straight grained freehands which I later learned
were carved by E. Nachwalter when I visited his shop a few years ago
in Manchester, Vt.  My favorite types are straight grained and shanked
and I very much like Canadians and Bulldog shaped bowls (not
necessarily all together).  Before I add a few words concerning my
present tastes in tobacco I'd like to share my most memorable pipe
buying moment. This one falls under the heading of the one that didn't
get away.  Along with an interest in procuring (I didn't say
"collecting") pipes I also collect antiques, both furniture (which I
also make) and glassware and porcelain, particularly Art Deco.  I was
in an antique shop near my home (one that I visit frequently and whose
owner I had alerted to look for pipes esp. " the ones with the little
white dot on their stems" ) when I saw yet another example of the
ubiquitous "ugly humidor circa 1960".  I would have walked right by it
as I have so many times when I noticed , smiling at me (a little
poetic license) from the stem of one of the pipes adorning this
particularly cosmetically challenged pipe stand / humidor that very
same " little white dot" that I had previously told the shop owner I
would pay a good price for.  Noticing that the humidor and pipes on it
were marked $27.  (Canadian!)  I did what any smart smoker would do,
paid for it (no bargaining!) quickly and rushed out to the cat to
inspect my prize.  There sitting on the rack were 8 pipes....5 of
which were Dunhills (from the early to mid 1960's!!! ) . Before I sign
off I'll say a word about tobaccos as mentioned above.  I smoke a pipe
all day long at work.  My mainstay tobacco is a Dunhill mixture
blended for me by Hal , the tobacconist at Dunhill in Chicago.  Hal is
an exceptionally amicable and helpful fellow who will add and subtract
from subsequent tries in accordance with your feedback until it's just
right.  In my case, (#C6105) it is somewhere in the triangle formed by
London Mixture, 965, and Bengal slices at the apices only with a hint
of sweetness and an excellent aroma that is pleasing to most without
having to sacrifice body or flavor.  Other occasionals are virtually
any English mixture I have not yet tried (and I am sure there are many
many I haven't) and some Germains products, Margate and Penzance.  (If
any reader would like to try my mixture they can just give Hal a call
and ask for Gary Kahne's mixture. If you need further information or
would like to recommend a mixture please e-mail me at ?????@???????
carleton.ca ).  Looking forward to reading further issues of the Pipes
Digest and other readers stories, legends, tales and tips.  Until then
sit back, relax, smoke and enjoy your pipe.......  Gary Kahne PS. Has
anyone out there seen any Balkan Sobranie #759 (black tin) or State
Express, London mixture lately?  PPS. I run a Bed &amp; Breakfast in
Ottawa Canada where Pipe smokers are always welcome.  (This is not
meant as advertising as we rarely have room , merely as a resource).

Hi, Steve.

My friends call me Oody.  I live in Vancouver, B. C. and suffer from a general 
lack of pipe companionship (except for my three closest friends).  I used to 
work as a weekend tobacconist at a local shop now long gone.  You would have 
like the Pipe Den.  It had a tasting bar; coffee; chess and cards and good 
talk.

I smoke both cigars (when I can afford it Cubans) and pipes.  I prefer strong 
English tobaccos because Aromatics are too wet.  As for pipes, I have about 35 
which are mostly firsts (ranging from Dunhills to a perfect Radice).  I have 
not bought many pipes as of late because I have been in school studying to 
become a teacher.  My wife is starting the program in a few days.  Money is a 
little tight.

Please send me the complete list for this group.  I want to share it with my 
non-net friendly pipe smoking friends.  Thank you and I look forward to 
hearing from you.

<a name="15">Subject: Store and blend recommendation</a>

Well, once again I've been to the Delaware beaches, and I finally got the
address of that tobacconist I mentioned a year ago at this time. For the
resource guide: Greybeard's of London, 211 Rehoboth Ave., Rehoboth Beach, DE,
19971. Phone: (302)227-4972. (Are they in a chain, or just lost?) They're open
year-round and take mail and phone orders, claiming to process them the same
or next day. (I believe them; how much business can you get in a resort town
after Labor Day?) Looks like a good selection of pipe tobacco and cigars; the
pipe selection is OK. I picked up a straight-stemmed second for about $20; it
smokes pretty nice and has a  huge bowl, but I think I may be sticking to
curved stems and smaller bowls in the future. (My jaw can only take so much.)
For the house blends, I have tried only 2, but heartily recommend both. The
"Black Forest" blend is delicious; I think it's the perfect new smoker's
blend. It's sweet and smooth, "blended of 4 fire-cured grades with added
highlights of sweet Virginia" according to their catalog. What that means, I
don't know. I'd call it vaguely chocolatey. Anyway, my non-pipe smoking
friends like it for a puff or two. The "Cappuchino" blend is a great
transition, when you're ready for something a little more spicy. They call it
"a true dessert tobacco, rich in a coffee blend with a continental mocha
essence." That, to me, is even less helpful than the Black Forest description.
I find it very smooth, spicy but not harsh. I bet it will be good for training
my tastebuds to accept the more bitter blends. They also had the biggest
meerschaum pipe I've ever seen in my life. I don't know how big the actual bowl
was, but the whole thing was about as long as a violin, and the sculpture of
horses at the end was about as wide as the bottom of one. Very impressive; 
completely out of my price range.

I also picked up a crummy pipe lighter, and now I understand the negative
comments about them. This was one of the $3 jobs, with the nozzle set out from
the body of the lighter. I've gotten bigger and more consistent flames from
wood matches. Greybeard's does sell the nice metal ones; I just didn't feel
like spending the money. I still think they're a good investment, but the low
quality ones are out there.

  Steve,

  here is my opinion re Mosaic publication. It is not necessarily
  meant for being put on the digest. It's up to you.

&gt; And, we have an administrative issue to decide: whether to put the
&gt; Digests under mosaic. Steve Beaty (see below) has volunteered to do
&gt; so. Normally, I've kept the Digest back issues as a "members only"
&gt; bonus, but maybe it's time to think of altering that policy. So far,
&gt; my fears of attempts to hose the list just haven't materialized, so
&gt; that's not a concern. What say you, members?

I think it is a good idea: these days, we should be open to the public;
we have nothing to hide, so why not let them know?  It might help to
"stop prohibition", and it can hardly hurt (us). The worst case seems
that that militant non-smokers could bother us with stupid email
messages. Personally, I could live with this risk...

Here is a proposal for a procedure:

- give members some time to veto against making their
  contributions available to the public. These contributions could
  then be removed/anonymized. If many (whatever this means) should
  veto, then stop the whole procedure.

- Furthermore, I would propose to remove the names and email addresses
  in the "New members" section at the beginning. (Otherwise, potential
  misuse would be too easy).
	
(The above procedure is inherently unfair against former members who are
not on the list any more. I do not see a way to handle this.)

[ Interesting proposals, Joachim! Re the Mosaic proposals in general,
I'd say let's continue the discussion another week and try to reach
consensus. -S. ]

As you can see, we broke the half-century mark with this issue!

And we have a lot of traffic this week about Mosaic. MTW, my intention
was just to put the back issues on Mosaic, not to eliminate the
mailings. I've positioned the mostly-Mosaic-related submissions toward
the end of the Digest, because a lot of them recapitulate the same
material. I think the response is generally favorable to putting the
back issues of the Digest on Mosaic, but will let the discussion
continue for a while before making a move to do so.

And also for your smoking enjoyment, join us now as we ruminate on
growing your own, the CORPS, the Civil War, blacksmithing, and
calumets...

So my tobacco crop is done. I grew White Burley &amp; Shirazi. Just
finish curing some shirazi. Yum, all natural aromatic.

At first i couldn't figure out how to grind/shred it for smoking.
Food processors suck! I tried, I know.

So here's how i processed my tobacco. I pulled the center vein out.
Stacked the deveined leaves, rolled them into a tight "blunt" like
cylinder. Then I shaved off thin disks with a razor blade. Volia fine
confetti like tobacco(each disk unrolled into many long thin strands).
Of course I saved the best whole leaves for rolling some nice blunts.

I'd like to here more info ideas on growing, curing, rolling, etc...
home grown tobacco.

Yes, tobacco seeds are still 100% legal. Buy them while you can. I 
got the Burley from "Gurneys" &amp; the Shrazi from "Seeds of Change".
Don't have the addresses off hand. Check in any gardening magazine
they should have adds for these companies.

There is another company with a net catolog with many varieties.
Haven't tried to order yet though. Here it is.

from Horus Botanicals Catalog.....

Nicotiana sp.  (Tobacco)  If one wants to smoke real tobacco, then one 
must grow their own.  Commercial leaves are over-cured and filled 
with cuts.  Pure tobacco smoke has an aromatic smell.  Plants figured 
prominently in the religions of many North and South American 
Indians - it was considered a gift of the Gods - being used for 
divination and ceremonial purposes.  Quite a contrast to modern mans 
habitual fixation.  Interestingly, this is one crop grown on very small 
farms as plants must be started and transplanted laboriously by hand. 
Most are family-owned, one can drive through the Carolinas or 
Kentucky hills and see many shacks surrounded by their small 1-2 
acre holdings.  Its the processing and marketing that is industrialized. 
Species available: 
	-&gt;alata - grown commonly as an ornamental, with tubular 
star-shaped flowers, white to red, fuchsia, 2' tall.  The alkaloid 
content is less than  other species.  Fragrant at twilight.  Seed pkt. - 
1.00 
	-&gt;antennaria (Coyote tobacco)  Native to S. California, once used 
by Indians there. Small white flowers in panicles.  Rare in modern 
times due to human infestations.  To 6'. Seed pkt. - 2.00 
	-&gt;glauca - fairly rare, native to mountains of S.W. and Mexico. 
Excellent specimens are seen in Big Bend.  Favorite of Hopis. Grows 
tree-like to 15' with leaves bluish-green.  Does not contain nicotine, 
but the related alkaloid, anabasine. Seed pkt. - 2.00 
	-&gt;langsdorffii - Native to brazil and Chile.  Odd green tubular 
flowers. Grows in hills and mountains, to 3' tall.  Good smoke.  Seed 
pkt. - 2.00 
	-&gt;rustica (Indian Tobacco) To 3' with yellow flowers.  Most 
potent species, containing harmine/harmaline.  Much used by many 
tribes, including the Aztecs, and was the choice of shamans.  Often 
mixed with Tagetes. Strains available: Wild type, Panche Mexicana, 
Tarahumara El Cuervo, Santo Domingo, Guarijo Makuchi - please 
specify.  Seed pkt. - 2.00 
	-&gt;sylvestris - perennial species that blooms year-round in warm 
climates.  Long slender cream flowers that are very fragrant at night 
to attract their pollinators - sphynx moths.  To 4'.  Seed pkt. - 2.00 
	-&gt;tobaccum - main commercial species, cultivated on all 
continents now.  Large plants to 6' with leaves a foot long, pretty pink 
to red flowers.  Best cured slowly in the shade for several weeks. 
The following strains are available, please specify:  Cuban Monte 
Calme Brun, Cuban Monte Calme Yellow, Muscatelle, Shirazi Iranian, 
Virginian, Pipeleaf Dark, Turkish, Blanco, Burley, Perique.  All seed 
pkts. - 2.00

HI, Steve.

I'm not sure that my message has gotten to you so here is another try.  The 
first issue of the mailgroup that I received is great!  I have already printed 
it and passed it on to my non-E-mail friends.  For us the Mail order section 
is very important because the only tobacconist in Vancouver does not have 
either the style or the selection that many of us prefer.  His weekday manager 
doesn't even smoke a pipe but he sells them.  Explain that.

Please, therefore, send me the complete archive of this mail group.  It will 
have a good set of homes.  (If you already did this, sorry.  I lost two 
messages, that cannot be retrieved, before I could read them.)

Here is my Bio incase it did not arrive.
_______________

My name is Ehud but my friends call me Oody.  I have been smoking a pipe for a 
few years now.  When I was in college I still lived at home with mom.  Since I 
could not save for university and live away from home,I had to follow the 
rules.  When she pulled the "not in my house" I had to quit the briar.  In all 
fairness she had gotten cancer from cigarettes.  She was just concerned.

A few years later I was sharing a cabin with some friends and my wife, 
Rebecca, when I borrowed a pipe from one of the guys.  This reminded me of 
what I was missing and it has been love ever since.

I smoke heavy English tobaccos, the kind that will clear a room.  I like the 
taste.  Aromatics are out because I smoke wet.  I used to be the saturday 
tobacconist at the Vancouver Pipe Den but it closed 3 years ago due to tax 
pressure and declining trade (SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL POBACCONIST OR THIS WILL 
HAPPEN TO YOU).  The Pipe Den was a club in a way.  There was coffee, a 
tasting bar, chess and other games, and good friends who would spend the day 
talking and smoking.  It was a real loss to many of us.

Finally as to pipes.  Because of my work at the shop I was able to make a good 
collection.  I have mostly firsts with some lesser pipes for fishing and 
hiking.  They are all loved and well used.  My collection ranges from Nordings 
(1) to Dunhills, Radice (the most perfect pipe in the world) and many others.

I think this is enough information at the moment.

More will come out in the future.

<a name="5">Subject: introduction(pipe digest)</a>

  Hello, I am Dave Stephenson and I smoke pipes. I also really 
enjoy cigars. I started smoking pipes a couple years ago when
a buddy turned me on to it. I started out with one of those
drugstore pipes and quickly burned holes in the side of it.
I thought that I just smoked to hard, but I took a chance and 
bought a Peterson's Irish Seconds at my local briar shop.
Irish Seconds are still my favorite pipes, nothing I have
seen has beaten their value. I can smoke them a lot and they 
never get pits on the inside or anything. I also love their large
size.  A friend and I also have scoured thrift stores and the  like
to fine used pipes.  I found a Medico Crest, a pipe with a leather(?)
covering around the bowl. It was old but the bowl was in good shape.
I soaked the bit for a while in alcohol a as my friend advised.
I then promptly bit a small hole in the bit one of the first times I 
smoked it. I try not to bite very hard, but I think one area of one
of the teeth I hold the pipe with is rather sharp. Also, I think the 
bit on this old one may be brittle. I got a pack of these little 
rubber black thing that fit over the end of the bit for .35 at
my pipe shop. I call them pipe stem condoms. I put one on the pipe
with the hole in the stem, and it covers the hole although it was
hard to get used to. I do not put them on my other pipes , though.
      
    As I said, I really enjoy cigars. My favorite is a Nat Sherman
maduro. It is very rich and full bodied. I also like the Ashton
maduo and  the  Hoyo de Monterry excalibur. That excalibur is strong,
and sometimes while smoking it I get a big light headed buzz.
I discovered the Nat Sherman a couple weeks ago, it is quite
yummy. I have never really found a pipe tobacco I liked as much 
as cigars. The ones for pipes always seem to mild, except for one
with a lot of latakey(sp) which was like smoking grass(as in the
kind that grows on your lawn) and I did not care for it either.
Cigars are much better for reading, or when you are to busy 
to pay proper attention to the pipe. Also, on  hot summer days
I find a cigar more fitting than a pipe which I always feel is 
more fall or winter. Nothing beats camping at Indian Cave state
park with my friends and waking up early and strolling down
the trails to the Misouri river while smoking a big ole cigar.
A big one will last all the way down there and back up,
close to an hours walk. 

Smoke up boys,

Dave

<a name="7">Subject: New to group/introduction</a>

Hello all!  I am somewhat new to this discussion group.  I belonged to 
the group when I was still at Indiana University a little over a year 
ago.  At the time, I had to end my participation in the group until I 
had a very good internet provider.

I am (let's see, I always run out of fingers and toes) 29 years old.  I 
have smoked pipes since I was 22, cigars since I was 17, and cigarettes 
since I was 14.  I currently only smoke cigars and pipes.  I am a Civil 
War reenactor with an artillery group in Indiana and that is about all 
that I can do as it occupies my spare time.  I usually do not smoke one 
brand of cigar or pipe tobacco.  I like to purchase something a little 
different each time I visit local tobacco shops.

Something of interest to all.  There is a cigar club here on the west 
side of Indianapolis.  I don't have all the nitty gritty details at hand, 
but everyone gets together twice a month to smoke their choice, eat, play 
pool, chit-chat, have a few beers, etc. at a pub on the west side of 
Indy.  If I can think about brining back the info from work, I will send 
that in to Steve for you all.

Personally, I'd like to find a pipe carver who is not so damn expensive.  
I need a custom carved pipe from a photo of a pipe used during the Civil 
War.  Although I want the pipe very badly (and want it done correctly) I 
don't want to pay a huge amount of money.  This may be unrealistic to ask 
for something for nothing.  The lowest price I have been quoted is $300.  
It is a figure of a soldier's head wearing a kepi.

Happy smoking!

Ciao!

  It's my understanding that what we're talking about is putting back
issues of the Pipes Digest on Mosaic. That would really be no different
than putting them on an FTP site; it would just be easier to get to. If
this is the whole plan, then I'm in favor. If you intend to distribute
_new_ issues by just updating the web page (and not mailing them out)
I'm against that. I really look forward to receiving the Digest each
Friday. I'm often inspired to go down to my wine cellar (where my
humidor is kept), peruse my assortment of cigars, and select one to
enjoy on the porch.
  Today I'm thinking of having a La Fontana double corona size. I just
discovered these and I really like them. They are quite sweet (not
sweetened though), and have a very fragrant smoke. They have a lot of
character for a lighter flavor cigar (which I usually don't like). Funny
comment on lighter flavor cigars, I think from Cigar Aficianado:
"Macanudos?!? They're like smoking fresh air!"

The store will provide the pipe and the tobacco (presumably a measured amount
for each contestant). All contestants keep their pipes as
a souvenir. FREE. No entry fee at all (at least that's what
I was told).

The contest is to see who can keep the pipe lit for the longest
amount of time. Contestants are given two matches with which
to light the pipe and keep it lit.

You must sign up for the contest in advance. (Although their
flyer doesn't say what "advance" means."

For more info, contact the Mission Pipe Shop, 812 Town and
Country Village Dr. (use the Winchester Blvd entrance, across from
the Century 21 Theater), (408) 241-8868 or (800) 779-8868.

except as a regular customer.)

Web (Mosaic)? Yes! Which is *not* to say that we should
eliminate the mailing list. No, we should use the
World-Wide Web to archive the best of the list, relevant
pictures, and relevant information.

To answer Steve's request for info on Mosaic and the Web,
the World-Wide Web (or W3, or WWW as it is abbreviated), is
a protocol for making information available. You can think
of it as a graphical version of FTP.

In order to find information on the World-Wide Web (WWW)
you need a browser. There are several different kinds of
browsers available, but Mosaic appears to be the most
popular. (Mosaic was created at NCSA and has been ported to
Macintosh, Windows, and the X Window System running on just
about every computer made.) If your system does not have
graphics, you can use a text-based browser, such as Lynx.
Both Mosaic and Lynx browsers are available compiled and in
source code free of charge from a variety of FTP sites.

The chief advantage of WWW over other information
distribution systems (such as e-mail, gopher, and FTP) is
hyperlinks. Links can be imbedded in documents so that the
user has merely to select the link to "go" to the new
information. This is especially useful and easy with
graphical browsers, such as Mosaic.

Another advantage of WWW over other information systems is
the ability to display graphics and movies, and play sound
files using the hyperlink paradigm. Of course, all this is
possible only if your system has audio, movie, and graphics
display capabilities.

Which brings us to the disadvantages of WWW. The primary
disadvantage is the complexity of the whole system. In
order to browse the Web you have to install a browser. That
gets you the basic browsing capabilities and the ability to
display GIF and XBM images. In order to display other
images, you need a viewer (such as xv) and have to be sure
the browser knows where to find the viewer. In order to
listen to audio files you need audio capabilities on your
system, and have to have a tool for playing the particular
audio files you encounter.

Another disadvantage is speed (or lack thereof). Many
people, especially the thoughtless or those who use fast,
well-connected sites, overlook the fact that many people
are not so well connected. These thoughtless publishers
create pages with large images that take forever to
download and are a general nuisance.

Finally, the collective "we" are still getting a handle on
how to use all these new publishing systems. My own
personal musing are that:

	- e-mail is like a newspaper or magazine that you want
	  delivered to your doorstep; you don't want to have to
	  do anything for the news to arrive - it should just
	  arrive

	- the WWW (Mosaic) is like shopping, where you want to actively
	  browse, and want to inspect the merchandise before
	  buying; it is like a library or information kiosk where
	  you initiate the search at the time of your choosing

E-mail is a less-than-ideal way to distribute pictures and
sound (at least until everyone gets MIME-compliant mailers
and terabytes of disk space). Because we are not all using
mailers that handle "multimedia" (Lord, I detest that
word), images and sound are cumbersome to manage. Also, one
may not wish to receive a 5 Mbyte mailing just at this
moment - unless disk space is never an issue - because you
might be 4 Mbytes away from overflowing your filesystem.

On the other hand, WWW is a rotten way to publish regular
information. The user must initiate the search for
information - initiate the connection to the particular WWW
server - and until that happens the information is not
distributed. Also, WWW does not provide the same sense of
local community and provide the same mechanisms for
discussion. It is a more one-directional medium (although
it is certainly possible to create feedback mechanisms).

Each method (e-mail and Web) has advantages and
disadvantages.  I don't think that a Web Pipes page should
or could replace the Pipes mailing list.

However, as Joachim so much more succinctly put it, a Web
page with general pipe and tobacco information would be an
excellent resource - an archive of back issues of Pipes,
and reference information on pipes and tobacco.

<a name="12">Subject: Information on Mosaic and a question on clay pipes</a>

The first part of this contribution has little to do with pipes, but I
think it is useful at the current point of the discussion about putting
back issues of the digest under Mosaic.  To avoid misunderstandings,
here is some information on Mosaic, written from my point of view. (It
might contain errors in some technical details -- I am not an expert on
the field)

First, as I understand it, it was not proposed to replace the digest
in its current form by Mosaic. What was proposed is to put back issues
in a place where that they can be accessed with Mosaic. The effect of
this would be that everyone connected to the Internet could read the
issues (provided they have Mosaic, or another program of this kind --
see below).

Mosaic is a program to access the Word Wide Web. Thus, you must know
first what the WWW is; I quote from the documentation:

 "The WorldWideWeb (W3) is the universe of network-accessible
 information, an embodiment of human knowledge. It is an initiative
 started at CERN , now with many participants. It has a body of
 software, and a set of protocols and conventions. W3 uses hypertext
 and multimedia techniques to make the web easy for anyone to roam,
 browse, and contribute to."

Putting this a bit less dramatically: WWW is the attempt to have common
way of accessing all Information on the Internet.  A simple Example: if
I want to have a look at the Meteosat image of Europe to find out about
the current weather conditions, I do not
	- have to find out where this picture is stored,
	- ftp to corresponding  host and retrieve the image file,
	- uncompress the file, and
	- start a program on my machine to view the picture. Instead, I
just click on a button and all this is done for me.

Mosaic is the program that does this (and many other things). As far as
I know, it requires a full, online Internet connection. Mosaic has, in
first instance, nothing to do with DOS, Windows, Unix, Macintoshes or
whatever your preferred operating system is. It is just a program that
handles the Internet protocol for you.  It allows you to transfer files,
look at pictures or maps, play audio files, read documents, etc within
one program. You do not need to know anything about the actual location
of these resources, file formats, transfer methods, etc.  Versions of
Mosaic exist for DOS, Windows, Unix, Macintoshes, and probably for some
other machines/operating systems.

When I first heard about Mosaic (not too long ago), I thought that it is
just another crap I don't need. After I first used it, I was convinced
that it is the best thing since sliced bread. You can use it as a toy,
but it can also help you a lot with serious things.

If you have access to it and have not used it yet, give it a try. It's
worth looking at it. (I case you are curious: my page (containing
scientific stuff) is on <a href="http://emmy.ira.uka.de/~posegga)">http://emmy.ira.uka.de/~posegga)</a>

OK, back to the topic: I recently bought a clay pipe (white,
churchwarden style) and I smoked it about 5 or 6 times. As I expected,
it is getting very hot. Unexpectedly, it is also very hard to light up,
keep lit, and the taste is not very exciting (ie: very strong and the
smoke bites a lot). Could anyone comment on smoking clay pipes vs briar?
Do you fill it in the same way, or more loosely? I have the impression
that its taste is becoming better, will this continue?  Otherwise, I
will probably give it up.

	Joachim.

Good Morning Steve.....
        I really look forward to the weekends when your digest comes 
through. Its one of the highlights of the week. 
        In digest 155, you were asking for input on changing over to Mosaic. 
As far as I'm concerned-- don't bother. I have found Mosaic to be really 
slow and clumsy. I've lost an awful lot of files and info with it. I like 
the digest the way it is now and I can put everything on a floppy and 
catalogue it.
        Someone gave me a small bottle of Dr. Greybow Pipe Sweetener a while 
ago and I haven't used it yet. It's got a small sign on it that says it's 
not to be taken internally... I'm supposed to smoke my pipes after I"ve 
swabbed  them out with this stuff? Has anybody used this before? Until now 
I've just been using pipe cleaners and when I'm around my shop I use 
compressed air.
Crude, but effective. I guess some of us are a little closer to the tree 
than others.
        Anyway, thanks for your time and effort on this digest.

Steve, re Mosaic, it is of no use to me. I use Windows for PageMaker, but
otherwise avoid it like the plague. Graphic interfaces I find annoying. As long
as I can get the news-ltr as I do now, it is of no concern to me.
I have yet to find a Windows program that works as well as my DOS programs,
but then I have little interest in the gifs and bmp files. It sounds like
Mosaic would require that I adapt to other add-ons to use. I'm a simple
meat and potatoes (with an e) kind of guy. Except for cigars, I do like the
pricey ones. On occasion. And Radice and Dunhill pipes. 

In any event, put me down as neutral. If a majority want, it go for it.

<a name="17">Subject: Don't Boil !!! Plus, Seattle Club!</a>

First to Tom Line:

To clean a badly abused pipe, or estate pipe. You do NOT immerse the entire
pipe in boiling alcohol! "Boiling" a bowl is just a term!  Buy some Isopropyl
 "Rubbing" alcohol at a drugstore, second, buy a crap load of bristled pipe
cleaners and a crap load of regular pipe cleaners (preferably thick tapered
ones.) First prepare the pipe by removing all excess carbon from the inside
of the bowl and remove the stem.  What I do is pour some of the RA in a
container with a handle on it, (a small ceramic creamer with a pour spout is
perfect)  and bring this to a boil in the microwave (doesn't take long, a few
seconds), then carefully pour this into the bowl of the pipe while holding
the pipe at an angle so that it doesn't spill out of the shank end. Also be
careful NOT to get the RA on the outside of the bowl as it will strip the
polish right off. Let this sit for a while, (real dirty bowl 1 hour.) Pour
out the liquid through the shank end and wipe off any dribbles. Use a rag to
twist in the bowl to dry it up and remove the tars.  Then start to clean
shank with the bristle cleaners and last with the regular cleaners until they
come out of the pipe almost as white as they went in. That's why you need a
CRAP load! Let it dry out for a day or two. 

Now for the stem! If it's a black vulcanite stem, just soak them in straight
household bleach for a few hours. You'll see them start to fizz when you plop
them in. If the pipe has a logo stamped in it and painted, just paint a
little vaseline or chapstick over the logo to protect it. This bleaching will
not only sanitize them but will remove the oxidation that turns them yellow,
brown, and ugly.  Next, run a crap load of cleaners trough them along with a
good long warm rinse of water.  To polish the stem, I use a polish found in
motorcycle shops called Simichrome. Comes in a small yellow and red box and
tube. Use this to bring the stem back to showroom lustre!

This REALLY works and this is what the pros use! If it makes you feel better,
I do this to my Dunhills all the time (about every three months.)

To: Cort Odekirk

Yes I have a newsletter that I started to try to get pipe and cigar smokers
here in Seattle interested in a club. I distributed the newsletter to a few
smoke shops, however none in the UW district. If you're interested in helping
me form this club, I 've been waiting! All we need is a few members to get
started, I've got restuarants taht'll make us feel welcome, and can probably
get some smokeshop backing to get started.

<a name="18">Subject: Questions on Meerschaum pipe</a>

Can someone propose a way for cleaning a used meeschaum pipe? I bought
one yesterday for about $15, basically to find out if I like smoking
meerschaums (I still can't imagine that I will enjoy smoking a pipe
without touching the bowl). The pipe has been used a lot and it smells
like it needs basic cleaning.

As it seems not worth to invest in professional cleaning of it, I'd
prefer to try it by myself. Hacker describes in his book a procedure for
cleaning briar by salt and alcohol, but it is not clear to me if this
can be applied to meerschaums as well. Does anyone have experience
with this, or can propose another method? 

Btw, do people use any liquids for regular cleaning of meerschaums?
Hacker says you should not, but a German book I have says a little bit
of pure alcohol now and then does not hurt. Any opinions?

Maybe someone can help me with identifying the pipe: it is a London
style pipe with an amber mouthpiece. From looking at the box it came
with, I would guess it is at least 30 years old. Inside the box is
printed:
		  EOUME
         	   V.B
      	 	VERITABLE
Anyone heard of this?

Thanks in advance,

<a name="19">Subject: WWW Pipe Page Proposal</a>

Hello fellow smokers:

        I'm probably more familiar with Mosaic than pipes at this time. For
those who haven't used it, Mosaic is a cross-platform (Mac, Unix, Windows)
tool for net surfing. Other, similar tools exist, but Mosaic is pretty much
a standard. Mosaic defines itself:

&gt;What is NCSA Mosaic? Mosaic is an Internet-based global hypermedia
&gt;browser that allows you to discover, retrieve, and display documents
&gt;and data from all over the Internet.
&gt;
&gt;Mosaic is part of the World Wide Web project, a distributed
&gt;hypermedia environment originated at CERN and collaborated upon by a
&gt;large, informal, and international design and development team.
&gt;
&gt;Mosaic helps you explore a huge and rapidly expanding universe of
&gt;information and gives you powerful new capabilities for interacting
&gt;with information.

        Maybe I'm wrong: I understand the proposed Web access page would be
"as well as" than an "instead of" situation: that the newsletter would
still be posted to members, but certain informative articles and graphics
would be available for general net access. The past newsletters would be
available by ftp from the same server, too.

        Frankly, this sounds like a great idea for those with access to
such Web software. Graphics of different pipes, with descriptions and
distinctions would be a wonderful resource. What are "Canadians and Bulldog
shaped bowls"? (I frankly don't know the meaning of most of the descriptive
words the knowledgeable members use, and have no nearby tobacco shop to go
ask. Neither do I want to parade my ignorance in the mailings.) A central
depository of such terms would be very useful for beginners, compiled by
you experts.

        The same could be done with tobacco descriptions. What is Latakia?
What do all these numbers (#759, and so on) mean?

        This sort of web page could keep annoying entry-level questions
from occupying much of the members mailboxes, and would also serve to
educate the casual net surfers.

        So, count me as a vote "yea" for a WWW access page.

        Meanwhile, I've invested in a Peterson's, along with (4) 7oz
packages of tobacco from Iwan Ries &amp; Co.! (Thank heavens for mailorder.)
Solid massive pipe and smooooooth smokes. I figured my computer could do
without one less  program for a while longer.

        Major differences from my First Pipe, the "customized" Dr. Grabow
drugstore special. This one travels in my shirt pocket on hikes and canoe
trips. Actually smokes cool with a quartz pebble in the bowl.

        Time for another bowl...

The Pipers Digest
Re: Mosaic

Joachim's posting last week made me reconsider if the Digest really should
go on WWW. My first reaction was - yes, off cause. Mosaic is a lovely tool
for exploring "the world". And why should pipe/cigar smokers not have online
information of this kind available ?
But, but, but... Remember what is happening in the alt.smokers(.pipes/cigars).
All the anti-smokers seems to be very concerned about our health.
We will be overloaded with flaming replys to whatever is posted in the
Digest. Is this worth it ? I say not.
An information page (on WWW) would be much more appropriate.
A place where you can request the subscription of the Digest and maybe reveal
information about related activities.
If the issue was to gain easyer access to back issues of the Digest, i go
for a ftp site. Much easyer to administrate.

   I think the more basic question here has nothing to do with Mosaic or the

First of all, I'd like to throw a vote in favor of archiving old issues of the
digest, one way or another. Mosaic's hypertext links seem potentially useful
for this. Face it, folks, we're a resource! I'd like to suggest, though, that
only the old editions be available; the current week (or two, or month?)
should go out to the members first, and the general public later. I think this
strikes a happy medium.

I also found something I've been meaning to ask the group about. Last October,
at the Kenyon Folk Festival in Gambier, OH (on the campus of Kenyon College), I
met a blacksmith who makes pipes! He says that they're designed like Indian
peace pipes, and although he doesn't generally smoke, he says they smoke pretty
well (although they're primarily designed as collectors' items). They run about
$100. The best part is this: he makes them from old rifle barrels! Being an
artsy type and something of a liberal, I just love the symbolism. My question,
though, is this. Is it really a good idea to smoke out of a metal pipe? At the
minimum, wouldn't there be a heat problem? Any comments or experience? Anyway,

<a name="3">Subject: Re: alcohol cleaning</a>

&gt;I soaked the bit for a while in alcohol a as my friend advised.
&gt;I then promptly bit a small hole in the bit one of the first times I 
&gt;smoked it. I try not to bite very hard, but I think one area of one
&gt;of the teeth I hold the pipe with is rather sharp. Also, I think the 
&gt;bit on this old one may be brittle.

A warning about alcohol soaking - some forms of plastic will react very
poorly to this.  Many types will discolor, cloud up, crack, or become very
brittle.  You might want to test it out by putting a drop in a
inconspicuous spot on the stem (on either tip, for example).  I think this
may have been what happened in your case.

Thanks for the subscription.  In glancing very briefly over your first
transmissions, I note that, in the resources section of the
above-referenced posting, Pipeworks is still listed at its New York
address.  I understood that Elliot Nachwalter (formerly a neighbor of
mine) had vacated his NY premises and moved the entire operation to
Manchester, VT as of last March. I haven't received any communications
from him since then, to verify that he has abandoned Manhattan, but
you might check.

Very delighted with the issue!!!

I did not attend the N&gt;Y&gt; Show this year and had to cancel DC due to an
emergency...therefore, I am not positive about the buttons you mentioned.

George H.  mentioned he had bought some buttons for use in our show in
October...AND, we ordered a batch of 10th Aniversary pins for our
members.  Anyway...both shall be present at our celebration.

Mosaic: I am not very familiar with the system, but from what I have
been reading in the Pipe Digest......  I agree with the people who are
advocating a simple and fast text system.  I have doubts that I will
be able to access it via the AOL gateway.

My introductory "BIO" shall be my next transmission.  Just wanted to
respond about the buttons and let you know that the mail is arriving
without any problems.

We all love the Pipes Digest. I personally wrote in the last issue and
explained how I went from cigars to pipes mostly due to your Digest...I
write this while breaking in a Peterson Sherlock Holmes Dr. Watson I
acquired recently at Edwards Pipe Shop in Northridge, California.

Well, lately, one more convert to pipes...he got a new Barling and is
enjoying it a lot. We each have private offices which makes it a lot easier
to smoke during work. What a civilized, enjoyable pleasure it is to puff
away while on the phones, in meetings or working on your PC.

Can you please please please send us past issues or let us know where they
are available via anon ftp? We'd really appreciate it and we will continue
to contribute as much as possible. Thank you very much.

Dear Steve:

Thanks for the digests.  I  have been enjoying them.  In the 
last digest a contributer listed a personal Dunhill blend that 
interested me, but I inadvertantly erased the digest.  It was a 
Dunhill blend of 965, London Mixture and Bengal Slices, he 
said.  He also said it could be ordered from Dunhill in 
Chicago.  I need to know the exact # of the tobacco and the 
address in Chicago.  Could you supply such?

I think you list the old address for Connoisseur Pipe Shop, 
Ltd. in NYC.  Their address for the last couple of years is:  
1285 Avenue of the Americas(Paine Webber Building at 51st), New 
York, NY  10019, Concourse level.   (212) 247-6054.

Thanks,   

Bruce

From: Mark Brush &lt;???????@???.???&gt;
<a name="9">Subject: Cigars</a>

I've read about your newsgroup in several different places. Right off, I 
should say that I'm a woman who smokes fine cigars (Fuente Hemingway 
Signatures and 8-5-8 naturals and maduros are my cigars of choice). I 
hope this is not a problem for the (predominantly male) cigar smokers out 
there. I've always believed that smoking good tobacco was (1) cultural, 
and (2) a matter of taste. I was not raised to believe that cigars were a 
"male domain." Yet, in the latest issue of Cigar Aficionado magazine, 
there is a letter that quite vehemently opposes women smoking cigars. 
What is the general reaction of men to this? Do most male cigar smokers 
feel this way?

Smoker bashing is a big issue out here in California. My boss (who 
introduced me to the pleasures of cigars) said that he was in a public 
park with his kids and had just lighted up one of his favorite cigars. A 
woman sitting quite a distance from him (and therefore not likely to be 
bothered by the smoke) came over and told him that he was setting a 
terrible example for the children in the park! This was from a total 
stranger in an outdoor public place. I was in New York recently and got 
the impression that cigars and pipes and much more accepted (in the lobby 
of the Algonquin Hotel, I saw a man smoking a cigar and a woman smoking a 
pipe -- something you would never see here in the L.A. area).

Just a last note of interest: I hate machine-made cigars, but I was 
introduced to a pretty good one not too long ago: Marsh Wheelings. These 
are produced in the United States and go back to the 1860s. They are 
inexpensive and taste quite good. Since Fuentes (and many other 
cigars) are in shorter supply these days, someone looking for a cheaper 
alternative might give these a try.

Anyway, consider me signed up for your cigar and pipe group. This may be 
a longer "subscribe" message than most, but I'm just happy to find a 
group that deals with cigars, pipes, and fine tobacco!

<a name="10">Subject: INTRODUCTORY BIO (BILL POWERS)</a>

Hello, thanks for the warm welcome and information. Its going to be
refreshing to have people to talk to about pipes and cigars for a change. I
guess I'll begin by apologizing for the "faux pas" of not including my real
name when I subscribed. My name is Bill Powers and I am 37 years old. I have
been smoking pipes/cigars for 20 years. I was introduced to pipe smoking by a
fellow "barracks rat" at the tender age of 17 when I entered the Air Force. I
found the aroma of pipe tobacco irresistible and he gave me my first pipe,
which I still enjoy today. Luckily, there was a Tinder Box store in town
which I, of course, began to frequent. I began moonlighting there about a
year later and it was then I developed a taste for cigars; we were allowed to
smoke ALL the Tinder Box brand cigars we wanted while on shift, as well as
any two imported cigars. Additionally, we could smoke as much pipe tobacco as
we wanted while working. I worked a lot.
 I have about 36 pipes in my collection now, about half of what I once had;
movers "lost" some and I gave a few away to friends over the years. I have at
least one from most of the major manufactures: Dunhill, Charatan, Butz
Choquin, Comoy, etc. Standards as well as freehands, meerschaums, calabashes,
porcelain, clay; a fairly well rounded collection. For tobacco, I generally
enjoy something light like Troost in the morning and an english mixture in
the evening, I have a particular weakness for Bengal Slices and Rattray's
Accountant.
 In cigars I generally like the larger ring gauges in a variety of shapes but
if I had to pick one favorite it would be a rothschild. Like pipe tobacco, I
enjoy something light such as Royal Jamaica or Arturo Fuente in the morning
and a little more body in the evening, Cuba Aliados or El Rey Del Mundos. For
anyone wanting to try cigars I like and highly recommend Connecticut Valley
cigars.
 Enough about me. I would like to put my two cents in on a couple of notes I
read.
To Joachim: Clay pipes don't season much, if at all. The "earthy" taste is a
trait of clays, as is smoking hot and wet (Even though a churchwarden has a
fairly long stem, it isn't long enough if your blend is heavily cased). About
all you can do is modify your current blend or switch blends when you smoke
the clay. If you let me know what you smoke, I may be able to let you know
how to "fix" it without changing the taste too much. Also, don't let a cake
build up on the inside of the bowl, it will crack it.
Cleaning a meerschaum: Meerschaum scratches easily and you have to be
careful, both on the outside of the bowl and when using a pipe cleaner. I
would let a professional do it. If you like the character of a meerschaum
pipe but it seems too much trouble, I suggest you try African meerschaum. It
is denser and generally stained on the outside so you can hold it like a
briar. It can also take more abuse than Turkish meerschaum.
 Well, thanks again, and I look forward to "seeing" everyone around.

[ Thanks, Bill! -S. ]

<a name="11">Subject: Greetings!</a>

Hello,
	Wow! This is nicer than I had hoped. I have recently begun
working at Edwards Pipe &amp; Tobbaco in Los Altos, CA USA, and I've
been having trouble finding information about tobbaco, so this is
very exciting for me. I find it frustrating that tobbaco is largely
classified by brand name, with reference often to it's content.
As a cigarrette smoker, I have developed my own assumtions about
things, such as the distinction between virginia tobbaco, and
the dark tobbaco in french cigarettees. I would like to be able
to classify tobbaco similarly to the way coffee is now classified
in specialty shops. My favorite cigarette tobbaco right now
is Old Holborn. I like "virginia bright" tobbaco when I can
stomach the high acidity, for cigarettes. My favorite cigars so
far (after three weeks), are Canaria D'Oro coronas, Joya de Nicaragua
Consul, and H. Uppman Coronas, as well as AVO XO (No. I?) though
I don't like their price. I have had problems recommending cigars
to people, because I use analogies to food flavors, which usually
just gets an amused glance. I hope to learn a new set of analogies,
or any thoughts on what the deal is that makes food analogies
seem rediculous to people. Not spophisticated enough sounding?!
As far as pipe tobbaco, I'm still trying to find pipe tobbaco
that has a...bolder quality, (like leather or olives, rather than
Vanilla...) and I'm still not sure that I know which tobbacos
are "base" tobbacos, and which are mixtures in the shop.

Anyway, thank you thank you thank you. I have not finished reading
this stuff, but I expect to finally get the guidance I've been
looking for. Thanks again.

Greetings. I should introduce myself, I suppose. I'm an English grad student
here at the University of Missouri-Columbia, right in the middle of the state,
and far from any serious pipe resources. That's a shame, since I'm basically
new at this, even after 3 years of smoking pipes. The problem has always been
information: brands, styles, technique, etc-- one of the main reasons I jumped
onto this list. I hope that here I can get beyond what I've learned mostly on
my own. I'd appreciate some reccomendations on all fronts, keeping in mind that
 I'm on a grad student budget. My other interest is in the "cultural analysis"
of the pipe phenomenon: I've seen that the pipe is almost always linked to
questions of identity formation, and I'm curious about observations on this
front from more experienced pipe smokers (and members of the pipe community).

[ Minorly edited version of posting to alt.smokers.cigars and
alt.smokers.pipes. -S. ]

Hi, all,

Warning, polemic ahead... But I hope it'll provide some defensive
armament for we who need it. 

I've been hearing quite a bit lately about people who go to a public
park, light up... and then get hassled by some total stranger who was
sitting fifty feet upwind. Face it, folks, smoker-bashing is in vogue
among the political correctoids. To them, your cigar or pipe is
EVERYBODY's business.

Now, note that I'm not talking about situations where the smoker has
been deliberately rude, or even inadvertently careless. I'm talking
about situations where you _have_ made every possible effort to be
polite, and are still getting bashed without any real reason.

For these times, I offer an unhumble suggestion on dealing with
bashers. Put THEM on the defensive. Look 'em straight in the eye, and
in your best no-nonsense, line-in-the-sand command voice, tell 'em:

                      "MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS."

Say it loud and clear, so that everyone around will hear. Embarras 'em
publically. 

Then ignore 'em. Do not engage them in conversation. As long as you're
not bothering anybody, your smoke is _not_ their business, there is no
issue which requires further discussion, and they are behaving
offensively if they persist in interfering with you.

If they do so, get right in their face, look 'em square in the eye
again, and remind 'em,

               "I TOLD YOU TO MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS."

99 times out of 100, they'll back down. Bullies only bully people when
they think they can get away with it. 

Practice this so that you'll have it ready when it's needed.

I emphasize that this should be used only as a defense against
bashing, not as a substitute for consideration. 


Hope this helps! Other suggestions welcome.

                                Smoke in peace,
                                ~\U Steve (????????@???.???????.???).

Hi all!

Well, I smoked my first pipe on Friday night (Sept. 9).  And I have a
major question.  I had to spit constantly.  There was no way that I could
keep my mouth dry.  What causes this?  What am I doing wrong?

Nonetheless, I'm not going to get discouraged too easily.

Fellow Smokers!

I have the info  to share regarding the Indianapolis Cigar Club on the 
west side of town...love to hear about other clubs out here in 
Indianapolis. 

The club is called "Havana Daydreamin' Cigar Club of Central Indiana."  
They hold meetings at Dealer's Choice Pub at 3970 Georgetown road 
(between 38th street and Lafayette as it makes a curve).  They meet each 
2nd and 4th Tuesday of each month from 8pm to 10pm.  Complimentary cigars 
are sometimes provided by "The Tobacco Shop, Your Personal Tobacconist" 
in Lafayette Square Mall (just blocks away).

Contacts for the club are: John Rice, 317-442-7957, Chris Owens, 
317-484-1639, and Randy Biggs, 317-299-6010 (Randy is the propietor of 
The Tobacco Shop...I believe..same phone number).

Here is a quote  from the flyer:

"Havana Daydreamin' Cigar Club of Central Indiana is open to all cigar 
lovers and their friends who enjoy cigars, pipes, and tobacco."

They have black tie affairs at a very good eatery off of Rockville Road 
here in Indianapolis.  They also publish an "establishment friendly" list 
for us smokers who enjoy a meal and a smoke of our "choice."  They also 
hold other affairs and events including dart games, billiards, longest 
ash contest, etc.  

Membership for 6 months is $25.   1 year is $40 and includes a one year 
subscription to "Cigar Aficionado."  For more information, please call:

The Tobacco Shop (at Lafayette Square)
317-299-6010
800-232-3997

I have not met Randy Biggs, although I have visited his establishment a 
few times when I get the courage to go to Lafayette Square mall.  I must 
confess, I buy most of my cigars from either JR or the Smoke Shop.  There 
is a local two store tobacconist called "Hardwicks" but at times I have 
found them a little "high" in price.  Although, all of the tobacco stores 
I have visited in Indianapolis tend to be of the friendly folk.  I have 
enjoyed the Pipe Puffers in the Keystone Fashion Mall for some time 
personally.

That is all!  Hope this was of some help!  If anybody out there is a 
member of the club, I would appreciate a little review or just drop me 
some email!  

Ciao!  Happy SMoking!

Ted

(Oh, BTW, if anyone sees a pipe that is dated from the Civil War, please, 
please, give zap me some email, I would be very interested in purchasing 
it possibly)
Thanks!

<a name="17">Subject: PIPE TOBACCO</a>

Sorry I came in on the tail end of your discussion on tobaccos, its one of my
favorite subjects. I just want to add a bit about Perique, please forgive me
if this is a repeat of something already discussed.
 Tobacco is a fairly labor intensive product, with Perique this is doubly so.
Named for the Frenchman Pierre Chenet who perfected its production (it was
first made by the Choctaw and Chicasaw Indians), Perique is first hung for
eight to fourteen days in a curing barn. When the leaves are wilted and
yellowed, they are stripped from the stalk, formed into small twists and
packed in casks under pressure until they turn black. Over the next nine
months the tobacco is taken out of the cask,loosened, and repacked. It is
cured in its own juice, fermenting, until its ready for sale. We will serve
no Perique before its time.
 Most "English" blends are roughly 80% Virginia, 15% Turkish, and 5% Latikia
or Perique. Anyone who likes to experiment might try the following blend, it
cuts way down on the Virginia and increases the Perique and Latakia (this is
a Nat Sherman blend).

                                25% Virginia
                                20% Burley (no casings)
                                20% Perique
                                20% Latakia
                                15% Smyrna 

This blend is quite good if you smoke English mixtures. For someone trying an
English blend for the first time, it might be a bit too heavy, particularly
around your wife/girlfriend.
 For anyone who likes to collect and/or read books on pipes and tobaccos I
highly recommend the following:

          All About Tobacco by Nat Sherman 
          The Book of Pipes &amp; Tobacco by Carl Ehwa (Random House)
           ISBN 0-394-47000-1

 Ehwa's book has some of the best photos and art work concerning the history
of smoking I have ever seen. 

And now a question: In the late 70's CAO Meerschaum issued pipes of the
"great composers". There were 50 of each composer carved by  Bekler, their
top carver at the time. I have a Beethoven but would like to find some others
of the set or just any information I can about it. Does anyone out there know
anything about these pipes?  I have drawn a blank.
 Well, thanks for listening to me ramble and I appreciate any information
anyone can give me. 

[ I have Ehwa's book, and I agree. -S. ]

Does your address mean you work for Siemens? Anyway, hereUs my smoking bio. 

My name is Dave and I smoke cigars (sounds like an intro at an AA
meeting). I smoked my first cigar when I was 15, a fat, cheap El
Producto. It was pre-drilled, of course, but I bit it anyway, leaving
me with a mouthful of dry tobacco. I still loved it. I canUt imagine
what anybody thought when they saw me and my friend, also age 15,
walking around town puffing on those massive stogies.  I smoked my
first decent cigar when I was about 18, a Macanudo Portofino. Now that
IUve found Cigar Aficionado, which has given me a detailed guide to
purchasing and smoking good cigars, I regularly smoke Arturo Fuentes,
Hoyos and Partagas.  The best cigar IUve ever had was a big, fat Oscar
that my brother gave me on my last birthday. They go for about $6 each
and theyUre worth it. Ashtons and Macanudo Hyde Park Cafes are close
seconds. There are some very good shops in CT, like the Tabagerie in
Westport (complete with a bar for smoking) and Chief Catoonahs in
Ridgefield, a very friendly shop with chairs and coffee. Both have
extensive pipe selections, FYI.  So I like cigars, and smoke about one
a week. My wife wonUt let me fire one up in the house, so I usually do
the deed in my car or on my front porch. I hear all these stories
about cigar smokers being harassed on the street, in bars etc. when
they light up, but I think I might have the ultimate anti-cigar
story. I got a major tongue lashing in my office (IUm a journalist)
when I came back from lunch one day after smoking a VERY fragrant 4
1/2 inch long Arturo Fuente that came in a cedar wrapper (these are
great). The art director started yelling about how bad I stink. Then
about four other people gathered their courage, rallied around the
peeved art director and began harassing me. Yeesh.  I still smoke at
lunch. Better to hear it from the ladies at work than the lady at
home, know what I mean? ThatUs about it. If there are any friendly
people out there who would like to donate a box or two of genuine
Cohibas please go right ahead. I like the digest, and I hope to see
more on cigar smoking.  Alt.smokers.cigars is also fun.  Dave Savona

Hi Steve!

This time I'm not asking for anything (surprise ;-)!

I managed to read through the first 25 issues last night.  It was great
reading, like a novel that you can't put down.  There were some topics that
I wish I'd been around for.  Would you mind if I dredged up some old
memories from past issues and posted to the digest?  Things like "how did
you start smoking pipes?" for instance sounds like a few great stories
waiting to happen.  I imagine that for many of us, we didn't just wake up
one morning at age 30 (I'm not even there yet!) and declair, "Today, I am a
pipe smoker".

In general, these back issues are gold for beginners (there's even a few
mentions that would make me think you were one once :o ).  Thanks again for
all the time you've put into the digest.

Dave

P.S.  About blowing smoke out your nose, is this something you do all the
time, or just for variety.  I've done this a few times unintentionally, and
found that it wasn't too pleasant.  Do tell.


[ Dredge away, Dave! I do it maybe once or twice a bowl at most. Not
oftener, and never with cigars. Love the draconian effect :-) -S. ]

<a name="21">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #156/157 = WWW &amp; Mosaic</a>

It seems to have vanished in a puff of orange smoke....
Could you perchance re-send it to me.

I note that you apparently asked some question about Mosaic/WWW.
Not knowing what you asked I would only say...

WWW is often used to refer to the HTTP protocol which is used by any fully 
connected machine in the same fashion as telnet or ftp.  You run a web
server on some machine which answers requests to a socket and speaks the
HTTP protocol. 

"The WEB" (or generic usage of www) refers to the collection of WWW servers
"worldwide." Their growth has been truly amazing since NCSA (National
Center for Super Computing Activities) released MOSAIC for the Macintosh
around thanksgiving last year. Prior to that the web had been in existance
for about 3 years, but Mosaic was the fan to the spark.

Mosaic is simply an "interpreter." WWW data can be in many formats -
gif/tif/Jpeg/Mpeg/Mime/ascii and I forget what all else. On most systems it
is rediculous to contemplate one program which could deal with them all.
Especially since these wheels were already invented. All that was necessary
was to mount the existing wheels on a box and viola - a wagon. A truly
elegant and simple concept, and therefore a truly stimulating breaktrhough
event. (Just read upon on the Backbone Traffic stats if you want to see HOW
amazing the growth of WWW has been.)

Mosaic retrieves the data from the WWW server, determines from the HTML
(Hyper Text Markup Language, based upon SGML - standardized generalized
markup language) what the format of the file to be/being retrieved is,
checks that "type" against the list of "helper applications" you have
configured and bingo.... pops up the quicktime viewer to show you the
movie.

There are pre-compiled versions of Mosaic available for major platforms
DEC (MIPS and AXP) HP, IBM, SUN, Macintosh and now MS-Windows (althought
the MS-Windows implentation is dependent upon using the NCSA TCP/IP drivers
(it won't work with FTP software, for instance.)
These can be gotten via anonymous ftp from 
        <a href="ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Web/Mosaic/Unix/viewers/xplaygizmo">ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Web/Mosaic/Unix/viewers/xplaygizmo</a>

That's a "URL" Uniform Resource Locator - used as part of the HTML 
code to point you to "something."

Feel free to visit Penn's server:
                        <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/">http://www.upenn.edu/</a>"
        Note that most web servers are called "www.&lt;domain&gt;"

<a name="2">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #158 -- September 16, 1994</a>

&gt; in the latest issue of Cigar Aficionado magazine, 
&gt; there is a letter that quite vehemently opposes women smoking cigars. 
&gt; What is the general reaction of men to this? Do most male cigar smokers 
&gt; feel this way?

One MCpigs opinion: My wife and I used to enjoy a quiet cigar over a nice
old brandy of an evening. (Lovely lady- never drank single malts. Truly
a valuable trait.) We gave up cigars when she gave up alcohol. Thinking
about it, I'm not sure whether she's opposed or we just stopped- I'll
have to pick up a couple of the recently-recommended brands on my way home.

&gt; P.S.  About blowing smoke out your nose, is this something you do all the
&gt; time, or just for variety.  I've done this a few times unintentionally, and
&gt; found that it wasn't too pleasant.  Do tell.

The nasal membranes are highly permeable and close to the brain, they're
a popular route for administration of a fair number of licit and illicit
substances. I like the sensation and the results (except the time I smoked
straight perique). 

It annoys my parrot, who'd rather glare nastily at smoke rings.

&gt; [ Dredge away, Dave! I do it maybe once or twice a bowl at most. Not
&gt; oftener, and never with cigars. Love the draconian effect :-) -S. ]

I never take the time to watch me smoke.

I have few questions:
1- how can I receive the first 150 digest.  I can access ftp, Mosaic, or mail
please let me know.
2- was there any rating for different brand name pipe.  I have problem with
most pipes I keep makeing hole in the tip of the stem.  So I would really
like to find a pipe with a really strong stem.
3- Does any body has a problem with dry mouth because of smoking pipe to
the degree that white patches in the back of my mouth (fortunatly they are
cancer at least that's what the biopsy (?) revealed), anyway does any body
has a remedy for that.
4- Also as releated to (2) is there a type of pipe which does not get too
hot after each smoke.
Thanks

Steve, I am enjoying your postings very much and have picked up much
good information. BTW, I don't recall if I ever was sent the new
member's message. I have never before heard of any pipe smoker's
convention or somesuch in the Washington DC/Baltimore areas and would
like to hear more about them. Also, does anybody on the list know
where I can obtain or have made a pipe rack which will hold about 90
pipes. No, I don't have that many yet, but am approaching that
number. I would like to post my favorite blends, which I purchase from
Fader's of Baltimore at their Annapolis store. The first is Barrister
and the second is Turkish Knight, both British style tobaccos with a
satisfactory amount of latakia and perique. I am thoroughly enjoying
the recommended retorts to give to PC unmentionables. Up the weed! Ben

 The rain continued for the third day and a mist hung around the mountain as
I gazed out the window. The smoke rose from my pipe like a listless genie,
but at the moment there was only one thing I could wish for, release from the
hellish nightmare of a now empty tabacco tin...
 This was the nightmare I faced regularly during a 13 month assignment in
Korea in the early 80's. It was virtually impossible to find pipe tobacco or
cigars, even in duty free shops. I was entirley dependent upon "care"
packages from my wife in the states, and, of course, the mail was sometimes
slow, very slow. It was my custom to unwind in the evening with a vodka tonic
and pipe or cigar, so I was always happy to get mail. ( I won't trouble you
with the tale of how I had to travel almost the entire length of the Korean
peninsula to find tonic water; and limes, I won't even start about finding
limes...)
 I endured these hardships until one day, while shopping in Seoul, I met a
fellow American who had vacationed regularly to Korea for ten years or so. He
was also a cigar smoker and we had a bite to eat and a cigar. During our
conversation I related my sad tale of woe about the almost nonexistent supply
of tonic water and limes which he found amusing, lots of things we take for
granted in the states are hard to come by overseas. He, however, supplied the
solution to my problem. You can make a friend for life, and ensure you'll
have ample supply of almost any "beverages" you might need by giving Korean
bartenders good cigars. It worked like magic. Cigars were almost impossible
for Koreans to get also, and were considered status symbols, so this simple
gesture solved two of my problems anyway. Too bad the mailman didn't smoke...

 Kudos on Pipes #158, I really enjoyed it. And now "my two cents".
To Steve: I would like to know what other books you have on pipes/cigars. I
am always looking for new ones. Thanks.
To Linnea: Speaking for myself, I have no problem with women smoking cigars
and I like your choice of cigars, Hemingways are a favorite of mine also. In
addition to Marsh Wheelings, you might also like to give Connecticut Valley
Boquet Specials a try, I think you'll find them a good change of pace. 
To Joe: Re saliva problems; I agree with Steve, hang in there, it WILL get
better. A couple of things that might help in the  interim, try switching to
a blend with less casings (if you smoke an aromatic blend), and you might
also try smoking a calabash, the smoke is cooled more than a standard pipe
and that might help a bit too.
To Dave: If you happen to get some Cohibas, how about sending one my way...
Finally, on MYOB: I concur, a great number of people would be a lot better
off following that advice, and not just about smoking...
Until next time, keep on puffing...

[ Other books? I have Hacker's _Ultimate Pipe Book_, Pimo's _Guide to
Pipe Carving at Home_, Ehwa's _Book of Pipes and Tobacco_, Rapaport's
_Global Guide to Tobacco Literature_, and on and on... Not _all_ of

Hi Steve!
Thanks for the mailings. I really enjoyed them, and the back issues I've 
looked at at the W3 page of Steve Beaty. Good idea! I just have to figure 
out how to get my browser to print out, so yhat I can read at home at 
leasure. My net-connection is at work.

To my suprise I've found that I'm not the first swede to join. I had planned 
to tell you all about this corner of the globe (somthing wrong with that 
metaphore...), but now I find I can skip that. Even the town of Lulea, where 
I grew up and started smoking a pipe some twenty years ago, is known to the 
readers of this list.

Thus I skip the preliminaries, and go straight to business. I am the 
contented owner of around thirty pipes of different shapes and sizes. I 
prefer largish, staight pipes that I smoke whike watching TV or reading a 
book in the evenings. There are two king size Savinellis, one straight grain 
and one puno oro, in my collection, along with a Tilshead bulldog, an Orlik 
canadian and some that I have carved myself, of this evening pipe type. I 
also have a number of Tanzanian meershaums, the kind that have been heated 
in some way that makes them more resistant. These I have found to be quite 
good outdoor pipes.

I enjoy medium strength, spicy tobaccos with a generous dash of latakia. 
Balkan sobraine is a good example. There are also a number of Danish blends, 
like Caledonean Gran Reserva (sounds like a Rioja wine...). Unfortunately it 
is hard to come by any of these in the small (very small) city of Skara, 
where I live presently.  There are good tobacconists in Gothenburg, not far 
from here, however.

On hot summers days I switch to a cigar, usually one from the Canary 
Islands. One of these islands, La Paloma, is an area for tobacco 
cultivation. From this tobacco cigars of, in my opinion, quite acceptable 
quality, are produced. My favuorite so far was called Gran Fama, a rather 
dark cigar with a lot of bouquet. It's a long way to go, though, when the 
humidor is empty... No big problem, though, there aren't many hot summers 
days in Sweden.

I finally had a chance to smoke my pipe again.  I can't smoke at home,
don't like to rush it by doing it between classes, but a small concert
at a local coffeehouse was perfect.  The tobacco was "Dave's Blend" from
the Tinderbox.  It may be specific to this store.  "cool burning, highly
aromatic, with a hint of nougat" was the description.  I'm trying to
break in a new Alpha pipe and keep hearing that I should smoke all the
way to the bottom - is that really possible?  I kept smoking at a
regular rhythm for a long time so I think I burned more of the bowlful
than I have before, but about 1/4 of the tobacco at the bottom was not
burnt. I think it was too wet to burn.  I'm just curious if it's really
practical to smoke the whole bowl, or is 3/4 of it close enough to a
complete burn, at least for breaking in purposes? 

[ It's possible; takes practice, and usually a few relights. -S. ]

Well, here is a bio of mine.  My name is Rob and I enjoy the sweet
aroma of a fine cigar.  I love to chew on a fine cigar, but I have 
never gotten around to lighting one yet.  I got hooked on cigars
two years ago when I was 17.  I was in my senior year in high school
and I had an Economics/Political Science teacher who was a
cigar smoker and he got me hooked.  He showed me a cigar catalogue
with many fine brands and I could just smell the cigars through the
paper (well, not really).  I really enjoyed when he was at school 
functions and we would hang out with him smoking and me inhaling.
(Sorry if my thoughts ramble, I am a computer engineering major and
 my mind has been short-circuited.)  I would like to start smoking
 cigars.  If anyone could help me with some starter brands to get
 me acquainted with what my tastes are, please e-mail me.  And, if
 anyone knows of a good smoke shop in the Louisville, KY area, please
 let me know.  Well, there is not much to me, but here is what I am.
 Thanks.

<a name="15">Subject: For Pipes Digest</a>

Hi everyone,

Well after lurking for a couple of months enjoying the list I finally 
have something I think is worth writing about...

A couple of weeks ago while browsing through my Universities library I 
came upon The Pipe Book A History and How -TO by William Goldring, 1973
ISBN 0-87749-426-6

Basically its a book all about different types of pipes! (great evenings 
worth of reading!  Anyway I made a couple of the simpler traditional 
pipes in the book and have been enjoying them immensly as a change from 
the good old briar for the bast week now...

I thought I'd share them here...(BTW this book was written at a time when 
that expensive tobacco substitute was very prominent in these but they 
work great for plain old tobacco!)

1.) The simple tube pipe
Needed 1" X 1" X 4.5" piece of hardwood such as teak, cherry, and 
rosewood (pine etc will burn out..)

The tobacco hole should be drilled with a 3/4" wood boring bit and 1.5" deep
the smoke hole should be drilled down from the tobacco hole using a 1/4" bit
A screen should be placed in the ledge at the bottom of the tobacco hole 
(for those who don't wish to visit a "head" shop go to the hardware store 
and ask for a faucet screen...) 

    --------   (1" long)
    \      /
     \    /
      |  |
      |  |
      |  |
      |  |      
      |  |      Total length 4.5" long
      \  /
      		(.5")

This is a crude ascii drawing :-)
To smoke:
The goal is to never have the tube touch the lips!...
Hold tube in fingers of hand and wrap all fingers together bringing thumb 
to hold it...(rests on middle finger with thumb over top of it...hard to 
explain hope you can understand)  and bring other hand up and wrap it 
aroung outside of palm so there is one home between thumb and finger to 
draw in smoke...  

Pipe 2

The BauBau

Needed is one complete cell of bamboo (airtight) about 18 inches or so long

use a 1/4" bit for the smoke hole and a 3/16" bit for the tobacco hole
                                \   /
                                |  |  
  |--  -------------------------|  |-------|
  |                                        |
  |________________________________________|

To load tobacco wrap into a conical shape using rolling papers and 
stick into the tobacco hole...
Light tobacco and inhale and exhale from the mouth until tube is 
completely filled and conical form of tobacco is depleted...then inhale 
by covering 3/4 of tobacco hole and inhaling...(Its an interesting change 
from the normal pipe smokers puffing philosophy but fun!)

From: Joachim Posegga &lt;???????@???.???.??&gt;
<a name="16">Subject: Pipes ML</a>

Hi Steve,

here is a lenghty  contribution for the next digest...

On Cleaning Meerschaums:
------------------------
About two digests ago I asked about a procedure for cleaning
meerschaums. As the pipe I have is a cheap second hand one in bad
condition, I decided to experiment:

I tried Hackers procedure (from the Ultimate Pipe Book), filled the
bowl to 50 % with salt, and added about 2ml (more than Hacker
recommends) of pure ethylalcohol (I hope that's the correct English word
for it). Then I filled the rest of the bowl with salt and let it sit for
24 hours.

The result was that the pipe smelled much better (ie: it does not smell
at all now). The salt was (slightly) brown. The whole procedure seems to
have worked well and apparently did not harm the pipe. However, it did
not help much wrt the taste of the pipe: it is still not very exciting,
although a bit better than before. 

Apropos: I found the adress of Sultan Meerschaum pipes in Ankara, Turkey
in the resource guide and send them a fax asking for information. This
was about two months ago and they did not respond so far. Do they still
exist? (The fax machine did, but I wonder why they do not answer.)

On Loose Stems:
---------------
I found a (completely non-dangerous and simple) procedure for fixing
stems which are a little bit loose. It does not help in bad cases,
but it might be worth to give it a try before going for more drastic means.

Put the stem only about one mm into the shank, then smoke about 1/3 of a
bowl, such that the pipe heats up as normal. Take the pipe apart
immediately after everything is smoked and let both parts cool down
seperately. Now, the stem should be a bit wider than before. Repeating
it once or twice intensifies the effect.

The method is adapted from a German book on pipes, where it is proposed
to take the pipe apart while it is still hot. This 'brute force
approach' seemed a bit dangerous to me, so I tried the above compromise
and found it useful.

Recent Experience with Dunhill:
-------------------------------
About three months ago I bought a nice 'Straight Rhodesian' (close to a
Bulldog) made by Dunhill. I found it the the Pfeifen Archiv in Stuttgart
(it's in the resource guide).

I broke it in very carefully and its taste convinced me that it's worth
its money. After while, I realized that there is a small crack in the
wood near the shank. It did have no affect to smoking it, but it was of
course not acceptable. I took it back to the shop; they said they
haven't seen something like this, and it's a scandal for the British
empire - roughly equivalent to finding Queen Mom at a nudist
beach. Dunhill would immediately exchange the pipe.

Well, 'immediately' turned out to mean '5 weeks' and Dunhill returned in
exchange a brand new pipe. The 'surprise' was that I got a Billiard
instead of the Rhodesian back! In the end, I sorted it out with the
shopkeeper and got another Rhodesion from the shop's stock (the last one
they had, slightly different from mine, but well... I did not want to
have it sent back to Dunhill and wait for another 5 weeks
again). Furthermore I got a 30% discount on a beautiful Dublin, because
I had so much trouble...

This leads me to a question: German shops mostly have fixed prices
(unless, of course, something like the above happens and they want to
keep you as a customer). How about pipe shops in the US? I read in the
FAQ that you can usually bargain the price. How much can I expect?  Is
it realistic to try to end up with a 30% discount?  I'll have to wait
two days in Atlanta, GA for my plane back to Germany, so I'll have
enough time to look araound for one or two pipes.  I'd prefer to buy one
made in the US. Any recommendations? (Should cost less than the plane
ticket :-) )

Btw., Did anyone compare the price level in the US vs Germany? If the
difference in prices should be like with a pair of Levi's (double price
here), I should have the limit of my credit card increased before I
leave... (A hint for those of you who want to buy a pipe in Germany: be
prepared to pay in cash -- few tobacconists accept credit cards.)

And the very last question: anyone out there from Zurich, Switzerland?
I'll be there in two weeks and heard rumors about an excellent pipe
shop. Unofrtunately, I don't have any name or address.

	Joachim.

<a name="17">Subject: Meerschaum correction?</a>

Hi,

I was reading through the Pipes Web page
the other day and noticed the definition
of Meerschaum was given as "fossilized
remains of sea creatures." 

Then I remembered this posting from Pipes #151:

	From: ?????@???????.???.?? (Omer Benli)
	Subject: On Meerschaum Pipes

	WHAT IS MEERSCHAUM?

	Meerschaum, contrary to popular belief, is not fossilized remains of
	sea creatures, but a mineral called Hydrous Magnesium Silicate.
	Among other places in the world, it is found from 30 to 450 feet
	below the surface of the earth near the town of Eskisehir, Turkey.

	WHY MEERSCHAUM IS USED FOR PIPES?

	Meerschaum's magnesium content provides strength while the hydrogen
	and oxygen contribute porosity. 

	...

Followed by this in Pipes #152:

	From: ?????@??.???.???
	Subject: Meerschaum=sepiolite

	Hi Steve,

	I was reading through your most recent digest and came
	across a blurb from someone (don't recall who and am not
	knocking them anyway) who was trying to explain what
	meerschaum is and why it so good as bowl material.  I am
	within a couple months of receiving a master's in geology
	and clay minerals are of some interest to me. Yes,
	meerschaum is a hydrated magnesium silicate. No, the
	magnesium doesn't make it strong and the hydrogen and
	oxygen don't make it cool. It is the crystalline structure;
	the arrangement of the magnesium, silicon, oxygen, and
	hydrogen atoms in a rigid crystalline structure that makes
	sepiolite (the clay mineral that is identified by pipe
	smokers as meerschaum) so good for smoking.

	...

Sooo, I suppose the Pipes Digest FAQ 
(<a href="http://www.craycos.com/~beaty/pipes/FAQ)">http://www.craycos.com/~beaty/pipes/FAQ)</a> should be updated?

Hi Steve!
I've been browsing back-issues of the superb digest, and noted Mike Leschins 
expert comments on meerschaum. In my intro, which I hope you recieved not 
long ago, I mentioned Tanzainian meerschaums that are heated in some way as 
part of the manufacturing process, and now I'm thinking that maybe Mike, or 
someone else, can explain what happens during this process (I am a chemist, 
although on the biology end of the scale, so a bit of shop is OK by me).

The result of the process, as I noted, are pipes that are tough, nice to 
handle with a pleasant yellowish colour. Compared to my calebash meershaum 
they give a much warmer smoke, but like I said they make great outdoor 
pipes! Any others who have experience with and opinions on these things? 
(Maybe a full discussion is hidden in the backissues I haven't read?)

<a name="19">Subject: Maple and Rum tobacco</a>

I recently purchased a 50 g. bag of Maple and Rum cavendish at my 
usual store.  The salesman assured me that it was his favorite and it tasted 
better than it smelled (in the bottle).  I was unsure, but I let him 
talk me in to it (and out of my usual black cavendish - you know variety 
is the spice of life and all that).  That was my first mistake.  I 
think I'll live by the rule that if I don't like the smell of the 
tobacco in the bottle then I certainly won't like it in my pipe.

When I lit up the first bowl of it, I almost gagged; it tasted like I had 
been puffing non-stop on my pipe for five minutes (the taste you get if 
you smoke it too fast).  After two puffs I had to dump it and go back to 
my other tobacco.  Now I use it (in very small amounts) as a mix with a 
#1 Burley and/or Black Cavendish.  These two can mask the flavor and at 
$15 for 50g. (in the Great White North) this stuff is too expensive to 
throw away.

Either I got a (very) bad bag or that salesman has been smoking real 
cheap cigars for too long and this stuff is tasty in comparison.  I don't 
know.  Obviously (to use the cliche) his mileage varied significantly 
from mine. 

Maybe there are others out there who agree with the salsesman and you 
could let me in on the secret to enjoying this little gem of a tobacco. 
Until then, I'll stick to the unflavored varieties or the black cavendish.
Maybe it is true when they say "less is more" :-&gt;

Hope the rest of you have better luck when trying out new brands

I had posted last week about a pipe smoking contest to be held at the
Mission Pipe Shop in San Jose. Although I wasn't able to attend the
contest, I was extremely curious how long the winning smoker kept a
pipe burning.

The winning time for 1 oz of Burley was 1 hour 11 minutes. Three or
four other people lasted about 1 hour.  One person was out within 5
minutes because he smoked too slowly and was not able to keep his pipe
lit.

I don't remember exactly how many people attended, but I believe it
was in the ballpark of 25 or so (don't quote me).

Steve,

It's been nearly two weeks, but I thought I'd let you know that I, a
novice pipe smoker, participated in a pipe smoking contest in San
Jose, CA.  Mission Pipe Shop sponsored the event and 20 participated
actively while at least ten or so looked on.  We all gathered around a
big table and were provided a free pipe (probable retail value around
$15), a pouch of mild tobacco, and a pipe nail.  Because it was windy,
lighters were distributed.  Each "contestant" had the opportunity to
light their pipe once during an initial five minute period; once that
period expired, a one minute re-light period started.  After that,
each one of us was on his own (though the flier advertising the event
stated that the event was open to "any contestant who can keep his or
her pipe lit the longest", there were no female contestants).

The local record was 25 minutes, the regional record (for Arizona,
California, Nevada, Washington, and Alaska) was 55 minutes.  Yours
truly *barely* beat that record at 55 minutes, 10 seconds.  I was the
16th contestant to drop out.  Two gentlemen battled it out for many
more minutes to secure first and second prizes of $100 and $60
Stanwell pipes.  All in all, it was very enjoyable.

On another note, I have been very surprised by a new line of cigars
called H.A.  Ladrillo.  One of the tobacconists at Mission Pipe Shop
said that these cigars are made in Honduras and that they're
relatively new.  Does anyone have any other info?  I've tried the
fabuloso and thought it was very good, possibly rivalling Avo or
Davidoff...

Take care,
Bryan

[ Thanks for the reports, Kam and Bryan! And congratualtions on
beating the record! After hearing that the Kentucky State Fair had
dropped their pipe-smoking contest, I'm glad to see that one can still
be legally held in San Jose. -S. ]

Administrative note: I'm relaxing the policy a bit, and letting
present members request memberships for others. Never had a problem
with this in the past, the few times I've violated my own rule. Of
course, the Digest has been used a couple of times in the past to
harass nonmembers, so nonmembers may still only ask for memberships
for themselves. (Now, everyone who can't read this, signify by blowing
a smoke ring... :-)

At the insistence of our Gentle Readers, I've also made CONSIDERABLE
updates to the Resource Guide. Also, see Richard Geller's note... the
plain vanilla FTP site is up!

Good Morning Steve.....

        Thanks for PG 159. Great stuff!  In response to the question about 
lady smokers --- My wife is a writer and she somtimes smokes those little 
wine soaked cigars called OLD PORT. Gastly smell but she enjoys them :) 
Mostly her preferrance is in cigerettes that I roll for her made from my 
pipe tobbacco. She dos'nt have the patience to hang in there with a pipe but 
likes the tobbacco.
        We're quite isolated here ( 45 miles to the nearest town and three 
miles to the nearest neighbour ) so we don't have the worry of people 
telling us about smoking.I have been caught in that predicament and I just 
tell them that I have to smoke because I'm allergic to the smell of sweat 
and perfume. It usually stops at that point. 
        I have accessed the back issues of PG thro MOSAIC. Jeeze that thing 
is slow but it works. I noticed that you used Word perfect 4.2 so there was 
not problem for me to convert as I'm using Word perfect 5.1
        Once again thanks and good luck with your fight against the rules 
and regulations that they're trying to impose. Freedom is special.

<a name="4">Subject: Bio and other stuff</a>

Dear Steve,
   Brief character sketches seem to be expected of new members.  Herewith,
mine.
   I'm 49 and live in a log home with my wife and daughter in northeastern
Vermont -- have a son in college at Bard.  I am a writer by default -- I
can't do anything else well -- and laboring presently at forms and non-forms
of fiction after decades of doing other things poorly.  I have been following
a pipe around since I was 18, and though I wouldn't recommend the tobacco
habit to anyone, pipes and cigars continue to give me the same risky pleasure
as elderly single malts, left-wing politics and fried kreplach with sour
cream.  I must own at least 100 pipes, some of which are beautiful to
contemplate and others of which are great to smoke, but my favorite was a
cheap Grecian briar pot stained a deliciously sleazy red on which, during
high school graduation rehearsals, I carved my girlfriend's initials.  I
carried it around with me in a holster for years after the break-up -- my
fault -- and then lost it somewhere in west Texas while hitching through the
oil fields to New Mexico.  I think of it often and imagine it has gone to
join the other wonderful pipe I lost, a Peterson straight grain apple, bought
at a bargain in the Grafton Street shop in Dublin.  I smoke "English"
mixtures and am sequentially monogamous, being wedded at the moment to
Pipeworks #10, which I bought in quantity just before Elliot Nachwalter
closed the New York store.  I smoke only big, expensive cigars when I can
find and/or afford them -- used to love Royal Jamaican double coronas, but I
remember being disappointed the last time I tried one.  Last year, I
discovered in an old humidor two magisterially antedeluvian Dunhills bought
by my grandfather who died in 1971 and actually resurrected one of them (a
magnificent smoke!) with a damp towel, a ziplock bag and an overnight stay in
the refrigerator.  The other got soggy.
   I am enjoying the digest and suggest you add to your resource guide
TOBACCO ROW, PO BOX 3313, JACKSON HOLE, WY  83001, (307) 733-4385.  Nice
folks, well-stocked humidor, good selection of pipes and a dandy in-house
"English" mixture called "Great Divide," for which I may leave my #10.
   By the way, consumers of an even less licit substance than tobacco will
recognize the pipe shaped like a golf tee in Cory Ziton's #159 posting as a
chillum.  Even the direction for smoking it is traditional in the African
cultures where it is popular (though there is a one-handed technique), but I
have never heard it recommended for smoking tobacco.  Used for the purposes
for which it was intended, the chillum can be a little tricky to load and
dangerous to smoke.  Novices are sometimes given a damp cloth to wrap around
the base so that particulate matter won't be dragged into the lungs.  The
most adept user I ever knew called himself The Joker, and he claimed that, as
a worshiper of Sativa, he was obliged to offer the god first tokes.  He would
raise the chillum above his head, close his eyes fervently, and cry out:
BOMBALAY!  I think that translates roughly into: Let's Party!
   All the best -- R.D. Eno

[ Thanks for the note! Tobacco Row has been added to the Guide; glad
to hear that there's still a tobacconist operating in Jackson Hole,
which I've heard is somewhat Yuppified these dys. -S. ]

<a name="5">Subject: Re: Blowing smoke out your nose.</a>

I vaguely remember when I started to blow smoke out my nose.  It was
way in the beginning of my smoking life, over 12 years ago.  I
remember having the feeling of being able to get a complement to the
taste of the tobacco, a more intense taste.  Of course as we know it
is due to the sensitive membranes of the nose.  Anyway, I could not
imagine smoking pipes or cigars without blowing the smoke out of the
nose.  It just gives a more complete experience IMHO.  In the first
few times it may feel a little strong, but after you get used to it, it
is a great pleasure.  Of course, like everything else in the pleaseure
of pipe smoking, it must be done in moderation.

Also, I remember that one of the pleasures that I had back then and
still have it today was to watch the tobacco burning in the bowl when
the bowl was filled.  For some reason it was a really nice sight.  The
tobacco burning, the smoke coming out of the bowl...

Smoke in peace.

<a name="6">Subject: Re:  submission for digest</a>

Though I occasionally smoked a pipe during my first years of
college, the rigors of pipe smoking (keeping it lit, carrying the
myriad accessories, etc.) seemed too difficult, too slow.
The convenience of cigarette smoking (and social acceptability)
won out.
Now ten years out of grad school, married and with a mortgage, I
have returned to the quiet pleasures of pipe smoking, at last.
But even during those wasted cigarette-smoking years, I admired
those who smoked a pipe: my father, for example, who used to say
that a man who smoked a pipe and owned a Polaroid camera could
keep his hands busy for a lifetime.  And there have been others:
the ceramicist in Pismo Beach who spoke to me about his work,
slowly puffing on his Danish freehand,  a subtly aromatic blend
that suited him; the man who lives down the street from me, a
perfect example of a country gentlemen plopped down in the middle
of the San Fernando Valley, walking his Scottish terrier while
puffing contentedly on a briar with some unknown (to me) mixture;
or the proprietor of my favorite pipe shop, Charles Hennegan,
whose Liberty Tobacco in San Diego has been both a pleasurable
place to shop, share in smoke, drink and conversation.

<a name="7">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #159 -- September 23, 1994 </a>

Alas, it has been more than a fortnight or two since last I put fingers to 
keys, but the thought has crossed my mind more than once.  Now, I read
many digests, and smoke a fine bowl of old Benson and Hedges English
Mixture, and clatter away at the keyboard.  There is news from the West,
and fine news it is.  

In the day when smokers are treated like buglife floating about in scum
encrusted waters, I am pleased to announce the arrival of a *NEW*
tobacconist in Oakland, California!  And, indeed, he seems to be doing 
quite well for a new store.  He has a good supply of fine cigars (more
on this later) and some quite interesting tobaccos.  The prop is a
gentleman named Stephen Richman, a long time friend of mine.  Steve has
created a store with heart; a comfortable place where cigar and pipe
smokers can settle into a comfortable chair, have a smoke and a good bit
of conversation.  The place really reminds me of an old time pub more
than a "smoke-shop."  

He's got a great selection of tobaccos, including all the Esoterica
Tobacciana line, which he imports from the Channel Islands.  These are
mostly VIrginia blends, with a couple being cased with either liquorice
or fruit essences, and a few full English blends.  He's got a nice
brochure I'm sure he'd be happy to send out.

In the humidor, a delightful array of cigars can be found, including
many prestige marques; Nat Sherman, Avo, Butera (my fave at this time),
Dunhill, Partagas Vintage, Pleiades, as well as a good stock of more
affordable smokes! ;)  

The Piedmont Tobacconist is in 17 Glen Avenue, right off Piedmont
Avenue, in Oakland, California.  The telephone number is 510.652.PIPE.

A word about Butera.  This guy really knows his stuff when it comes to
tobacco.  He has four blends of pipe tobaccos, of which I can really
rocommend Latakia #1 and Blended Flake.  The Sweet Cavendish is nice,
but I have a hard time with aromatic tobaccos...I really don't like
anything getting in the way of the taste of fine leaf, and the Latakia
#2 is just a bit sweet for my tastes, but a couple of friends seem to
like it plenty.  His cigars are sublime, if a bit pricey.  Yesterday
found me smoking a Dorado 652 down to a 1" nub, and longing for more.  I
rarely smoke more than about 2/3 of a cigar unless they are well aged
(at least 18 monthss) so this says something about the production of
this cigar.  If you haven't tried them, treat yourself.  Sadly, I
believe they may have spoiled me for a while...

Finally, as I have noticed quite a few "local" folk contributing to the
digest, I'd like to mention the Greater (San Francisco) Bay Area Pipe
Club.  Pretty informal - show up once, and you're a member!  We meet
once a month at Schmidt's Pup on Solano Avenue in Albany.  Lots of
festive trading of fine briars, old tobaccos, and all manner of related
items.  We've been active since about 1980 in one form or another, and
would love to see some new faces!  Meetings are the third Sunday of each
month at about 2:00.  Schmidt's is near the corner of Solano and Santa Fe.
Good English beer on draught, some Ports and wines, and a smoke-friendly
atmoshphere whenever they are open!  

So, a new Tobacconist, a smoke friendly Pub, a pipe club, a couple of
recommendations for smoking pleasure...I guess I can go back to my pipe
now, having prattled on long enough.

"The pipe draws wisdom from the mouth of the philosohper, and shuts up
the mouth of the fool."  -Thackeray

Peace,
Gregory

Steve,

	Thanks for adding me to the *Pipes Mailgroup*. I am not sure
what the *Thought Police* will say, the ones who administer the
network at FlightSafety^Rs division in Broken Arrow, that is. If they
make a fuss I will ask you to redirect the Digest to my address on
CompuServe.

	After reading some back numbers of the Pipes Digest, I
conclude that a moderated mailgroup is a good way to go; there is
nothing like an Editor to keep the flaming-idiots in check, and impose
calm order to the proceedings. It was in the back numbers that I noted
you as an aficionado of the mixtures of Balkan Sobranie. Sir, you are
a spirit kindred to me. Mixture 759 is my favourite.  Virginia No.10,
their cigar leaf, might interest some cigar smokers amongst us.

	I am an occasional weekend smoker of a pipe, smoking only when
I can give due ceremony to the practice. Preferably when I have an
hour to myself and can sit outside in the garden and absorb the
aromatic spiciness of a bowl of BS759, the sound of the birds, the
wind in the trees, and the general beauty of the day. Ambience
enhanced by ministering to the pipe and lubricated with swigs from a
mug of tea. Fine weather for smoking a pipe is with us, yes Sir.

	"He drinks tea?" Well, yes I do. It's a fact I was brought up
to it from childhood in England. Any tea blended for the British
palate will go well with a pipe, but there is one tea that I want to
bring before the Company and recommend.

	Lapsang Souchong is a tea from the Middle Country's Fujian
province. It has a smoky or tarry taste derived from the wood of the
white fir-tree used for curing the tea. At least, that was the case
before the war, stuffs other than white-fir are used these
days. Nevertheless, the tea tastes good, going quite well with that
pipe full of BS759.

	Jaguar-mark Lapsang Souchong is from China whereas Zebra-mark
tea is from Taiwan. Either way, both are good, but there is no knowing
what you have in the tin of Twining's tea available from the better
grocery stores here. Large, slate-grey leaves are curled when dry. Put
in a teapot and scalded with the boiling water poured in on top, these
leaves unfurl themselves to give up their tea-like qualities to the
water. Lapsang Souchong by itself is a bit wishy-washy, so to improve
the strength I add a British-blended black tea such as Twining's Irish
Breakfast. Usually, two teaspoons of Irish Breakfast tea to one of
Lapsang Souchong in a medium teapot, filled with boiling water. Drink
this infusion with milk and sugar to suit your taste. Talk of tea is
not divorced from the subject of pipes and tobacco entirely. Lapsang
Souchong is smoked but not inhaled. Ah, but what about black tea?

	Black tea is fermented similar to Louisiana Perique tobacco,
in its own juices. Tea producers use machines to Cut, Tear, and Curl
(CTC) the harvested leaves of the tea bush. Tearing will bruise the
leaf to release the juices from its structure. This juice then
ferments to change the character of the tea or tobacco. "Ferment" is a
word that implies the use of yeast. I prefer the word
"Fester". Bruised tea or tobacco leaves will pick up spores that grow
in the released juice, festering to give the characteristic note to
the product.  Anyway, this blend of tea taken with some whole milk has
pleasing creamy, smokiness that is a complement to the tobacco,
particularly BS759, which has components of Chinese leaf.

	Re-reading this ramble, I seem at a good place to stop. Next
time I will talk about how I got started smoking a pipe and do a book
review, perhaps. If anyone in the Company is in possession of more
details about the production and uses of Perique, let's have 'em.

[ Many thanks, Andrew! I'm a fancier of Lapsang Souchong myself, the
tea equivalent of Latakia, but have thus far no knowledge of the stuff
other than Twinings sells it and it's pretty hard to find. This has
been an education! -S. ]

<a name="11">Subject: News From Friends in Low Places</a>

	If you ever have the choice between going to a pipe show and
having a meal with one of the salesmen -- take the meal.  And if you
have a choice of meal -- choose breakfast.  Unlike many industries the
tobacco and pipe manufacturers and wholesalers are (generally
speaking) a large and close family.  Breakfast with a retailer and a
salesman, or two salesmen, is a friendly and gossip-filled experience.
I was reminded of just how nice it is when I was invited to breakfast
with David, a salesman from Hollco Rohr and a local retailer.  I
arrived late but the bits and pieces I picked up should be of interest
to other readers.
	David thinks that silver banded pipes are just beginning to become
important to collectors.  He says that when we all realize how dateable (as
well as attractive) they are, they will gain importance.  All sterling is
date marked.  While the band is occasionally applied after a pipe is made,
it is never dated before it is made.  Thus, it gives the Latest possible
date the pipe was created.  He needs a little help however (so, guess what
HE collects).  Does anyone out there know of a book that list silver marks
from Madrid, Spain?  If so, please email me at ?????????@???????????.???
and I'll send it along.
	I'd give you Dave's email address but they don't have one.  He's been
encouraging the company to get on-line because it would really make their
work a great deal easier.  They certainly have all the basic equipment
needed -- even a UNIX server I'm told.  However, it took several years to
talk the New York branch (think Hollco) to put in FAX to get messages from
California (the Rohr branch).  So, Dave doesn't hold out much hope for
email in the near future.  
	What is news for you collectors out there is a group of huge
hand carved pipes from B.C. in France are on the market.  These pipes
are figurals which include a bird, a bull's head and pigs procreating.
Each pipe is completely hand carved and takes the carver 30 to 60 days
to make each one. Only a few came into America and most of them have
already gone to shops so keep your eyes open.  Expect the pipes to
start at about $1,500 each.
	The new Peterson Sherlock Holmes 7 day set will have a new
addition (the 3rd one) this next January.  The first two were Basil
Rathbone and Mrs.  Hudson.  As many of you may know the Captain Pete
from them has been discontinued, but rumor (and strictly rumor) has it
that it may return.
	Peterson seconds have gone up in price by almost half again --
so expect to see an increase of 50% at your local pipe shop.  It's not
your retailer trying to get rich off of you it is a real price raise.
Frankly, it is still the least expensive Algerian briar on the market
today and, in fact, almost the only one left.  I used to smoke Sasieni
four dots simply because I loved Algerian briar; but, they are long
gone.  Even Dunhill threw in the towel when they changed hands and
they no longer bother trying to get the stuff.  So, take your good
briar where you can.
	If you want to blame anyone for the cost it should probably be
on the head of the militants who hold Algeria under siege.  I recently
talked to a briar buyer who had just returned from Algeria -- and
promises never to go back.  He said that all diplomatic corps, foreign
businessmen and even Algerian government officials live at one
particular hotel that has incredible security.  To do anything else is
to court almost certain death from the rebels who have killed over 60
foreigners, and countless loyalists, in the past few months.  He said
you could film an updated version of The Ship of Fools inside.  Women
wore their best clothes and jewels to dine in the only restaurant they
can go to.  Liquor is very popular and even Islamic purists caught in
the situation have learned to drink to drown out the danger and
monotony.  So, if you like Algerian briar; and it does have a
distinctive taste, it might well pay you to get what you can while you
can get it.
	Do you remember the Fantasia pipe from Belgium?  It was a
small bowling ball with a meerschaum insert.  I'm told they are
reissuing the pipe (under the same name I believe); made this time in
briar.  The description left me with the distinct impression that we
can look for briar bowls painted with brilliant blue or red and white
markings and having a meerschaum lining.  It was unclear to me whether
the new version will be coming out of Belgium or France.  Speaking of
colored briars Savenelli is producing an "alligator" line of blue and
green pipes.
	Irving Korn of Royal Meerschaum has his newest "world's most
expensive pipe" on tour with him to the fairs and carnivals of
America.  The one that was listed in the Guinness Book of World
Records had a great deal to back up the claim; but, it was so popular
and became so famous that Korn has produced new versions on a regular
basis since.  Unable to document it's worth the new pipe isn't in the
Guinness book and they simply say that it has been valued at $20,000;
but, the price is negotiable.  The water pipe (which is what it is) is
about 20 inches long and maybe 15 inches wide.  The foot high carving
is an elaborate castle with a bowl (I hope for water) that you can
stick you fist in up to your wrist.  The carving is quite remarkable
and I will try to upload a photo I took of it at their booth at the
L.A. County Fair at a later date.
	By the way, the pipe that was listed in Guinness at $15,000
actually sold to an art gallery.  The couple that bought it put in the
high bid but it was reduced to "somewhere over $10,000" when Irving
broke the top while taking it on tour with him.  The new top he had
made did not match the color or the style of the other carving and
part of the value was that it was all carved from a single piece of
meerschaum.  The buyers have asked that I not reveal the exact selling
price and will only tell me it was over $10,000 and under the original
$15,000.
	Stokeby tobacco is introducing honey and raspberry flavored
tobacco.  Speaking of tobacco, The Cigar Aficionado magazine has
admitted that the Lancers cigars that say they are 100% Havana filler
from the 1978 crop are indeed real; a claim they had questioned a few
months ago.  Many who want to try real Cuban cut these cigars up and
smoke them as pipe tobacco.  Actually, if you like Cuban tobacco it is
better to use the dry cure cigars that are commonly available at your
tobacconist.  First of all, the '78 crop is past it's prime.  Second,
the dry cure tobacco is closer to pipe tobacco since the fermentation
has been stopped and it is also a little milder for the same reason.
Third, the tobacco is new crop.  These small stumpen-shaped cigars
come in from Europe (mostly Switzerland and Germany). The tobacco is
imported by them and rolled there.  Then, it is sent to the U.S.  They
used to say Havana tobacco; but, our customs now refuses to let it in
that way.  Many of the wooden boxes they come in simple have Havana
inked out on the bottom; so take a look.  If you haven't tried Cuban
tobacco, expect not to love it.  You might as well try it just to say
you have had the real thing; but, it has a strong earthy flavor that
makes the cheapest burley taste like cavendish.  Just remember, I
smoke latakia and love the old Ratray's stuff and Cuban is too strong
for me.
	Just as a matter of interest I am sending a private report on Cuban
tobacco sales becoming privatized which was sent to me directly from Cuba. 
I have permission to publish it in this format and in the newsletter; but,
that is where the permissions end.  Please respect that (of course you can
pass along YOUR copy for anyone to read).  I am also quite certain that the
news will get out especially in Europe and other places that no longer
embargo their tobacco quite quickly.  Still, your help will  insure that I
continue to get information from friends in low places to pass along to
you.  Alijandra

CUBA-TRADE: Cigar Sales Privatised

HAVANA, SEP 21  - The majority of foreign sales of Cuban
cigars, which amount to more than 100 million dollars per year,
will be undertaken by the private Habanos S.A., which will
replace the state-run Cubatabaco.

Meanwhile, Cubatabaco, an entity of the Ministry of Foriegn
Trade, will continue selling to the French market, the third
largest after Spain and Britain.

The creation of Habaneros S.A. was announced Tuesday night
following a meeting of international cigar distributors.

Cubatabaco president Francisco Padron also reported that the
Cuban tobacco industry has begun a gradual recovery, with sales
through August 31 increasing 26 percent when compared to the same
period in 1993.

Exports for 1994 are predicted to be 50 million cigars, while
1995 figures should reach 65 million, back to traditional levels.

Cuban tobacco production has been assisted by priority
attention from the government, the use of better land for crops
and an important business agreement with Tabacalera of Spain.

<a name="12">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #159 -- September 23, 1994</a>

		Just a note on 'smoke through the nose".  The
pre-Columbian Mesoamericans smoked their pipe (chillum types at least)
through their nose.  The famous Mayan tomb covering that is so often
refered to as showing space travel gives a very good picture of the
"astornaut" (really a Mayan King) smoking his pipe and inhaleing
through the nose.  Like today, tobacco was used in a veriety of types.
Some were for ritual use and apparently caused hallucinations when
inhaled in this way.  That is hardly without merit.  Today we give
medicine in nasal spray when we want it to get to work quickly and
produce the strongest effect.  The only way to reach the brain more
quickly that inhailing through the nose is a subcutanious injection.
It would probably hurt; but, you could try inhailing your own pipe
through the nose and see what happened.  For truely spectacular
results I suggest latakia or burley -- while you are sitting down and
not driving please.  Alijandra

<a name="14">Subject: Enough lurking!</a>

After lurking for several months, I'd better introduce myself.
RedBell on AOL is really Dennis C Cullinan, a 53-year old retired librarian
(I still fill in occasionally at the Lansing Public Library) living in
Lansing MI.
I bought my first pipe, a $1.50 stubby Pipemaker, at my corner drugstore at
age 15. Emulating my stepfather I bought Holiday blend, and also used Half &amp;
Half, as primary fuel for tongue-scorching my first few years. 
Then in college a friend dragged me into Chicago's Iwan Reis, where I
discovered their 100th Anniversary blend (since renamed 5-Star Grey), and
pipesmoking became what I'd hoped for. Gotta admit I figured to look mature
and debonair with a pipe in my mouth.
My first topgrade pipe was a Dunhill tanshell sitter, bought on my honeymoon
at age 20, for $24.50 in Kalamazoo. That was an ill-starred pipe, as I broke
the shank, had it repaired at Peretti's in Boston, then actually lost it.
Since then pipes and pipeshops have been a major avocation. I still grab the
yellow pages as soon as I hit a new town, looking for tobacconists to visit.
I have accumulated around 300 pipes over the years, most at junk shops and
yard sales. In new pipes I favor either straight grains or freehands: I seem
to have a lot of Ben Wades.
These days I much prefer English style and straight Virginia blends. My very
favorite is McClelland's bulk #2020 blend, sold under various names depending
on the shop. I also like Reis' Dr Bradley's mixture, and their 5-Star Royal
blend. I still smoke the occasional aromatic, though I'm a wet smoker and use
system pipes or hollow-bowl ceramics for their moisture trapping qulities. I
like Stokkebye's French Vanilla blend and Century Tobacco's Coffee blend in
the aromatics. These two are bulk blends, likely to be renamed by the local
tobacconist.
A few years ago my son got me interested in fine cigars. (I had sauntered
thru boxes of King Edwards, White Owl New Yorkers, and mailorder Thompsons
over many long years.) I joined CCC (Chicago Cigar Connoisseurs) and manage
to drive in for about a half of their banquets, when I can afford the fees.
My most consistently satisfying cigars are Punch Pitas and Henry Clays, but I
also enjoy the chase for the perfect (and cheap!) cigar. So I tend to
over-buy in bundles from JR or Mike's, storing the booty in a cedar blanket
chest. I really must move the chest to the cellar, where both temperature and
humidity is more constant.
I have few friends who share my pipe &amp; cigar jones, so I really appreciate
the Pipes Digest and CCC for affording me outlets for my interests. BTW,
there is a nice pipe &amp; cigar hobby group on AOL, though it is not easy to
find.
One of my favorite toys is an electric buffing wheel for polishing my pipes.
I get the cloth wheels from Reis, and am never so happy as when I am cleaning
up a batch of yard sale pipes. I use pipe cleaners dipped in single malt
scotch to disinfect bits and shanks.
Guess I've rambled on enough for one lifetime. Keep up the good work, Steve.
Keep puffing happily, members. I hope we've seen the last of the tiresome
discussions on the merits of Mosaic.
Best regards, Dennis C Cullinan :-)

[ Thanks for the intro, Dennis! We'd appreciate a word on the AOL Pipe
and Cigar area for our other AOL based members, if you could. -S. ]

<a name="15">Subject: Re: Your Pipes Digest subscription request</a>

This is in response to recieving my first pipes mailgroup mailing.

To introduce myself, I am a twenty year old student at both Columbia 
University and The Juilliard School, both in New York City. Originally, I 
hail from Los Angeles (the valley, to be more specific.) 

I enjoy smoking both aromatic and english blends; my favorite english 
would have to be Balkan Sobranie. I don't know what my favorite aromatic 
would be; mainly I just sample different blends from different 
tobacconists. 

Some of my favorite pipes are a Charatan (sp?) second, called a Falstaff, 
and a Savinelli bent billiard.

I also enjoy occassionaly smoking the 'weird' pipe, I don't know why, but 
I would be very grateful if anybody could tell me were to find a 
Westraven-Zenith clay churchwarden, either in NYC or LA or through 
mailorder. I had one and (forgetting it was clay, not vulcanite,) broke 
the stem in half. In addition, if anybody knows any 
companies/manufacturers that make reproductions of 19th-century Tyrolean 
style pipes, I would love to have one of those. (indulging some kind of 
wierd quasi-historical pipesmoking fantasy, oh well... =)

Also, could anybody tell me what the various MacBaren blends are like? 
I've seen them sitting on tobacconists' shelves and don't know anything 
about them.

--Courtney Evans

(ps, Steve, I can't get the bloody trn at Colombia to post, which is why 
this is here and not in the a.s.p area. There is simply NO command listed 
in the help file, any ideas?)

[ Well re trn, I personally use nn, so I'm no expert. But a quick scan
through the man page finds the "f" command, which should do what you
want (if you're on a nonexistent article). Re the MacBaren blends, if
you have about $30, you could call up JR Cigar and order a tin of
each. 'S'what I did :-) My personal favorites right now are Burley and
Symphony. -S. ]

Dear Steve -

This communique is long overdue.  I meant to get in touch with you
quite awhile ago, but things have been hectic, and you know how the
time can slip by!

Anyway, thanks for sending me a sample of the pipe digest.  Looks
great, and I definitely want to be a part of the group (by the way,
can our computer activities be called "virtual smoking"?)! Don't have
much time for online activities these days, but I'll enjoy being a
part of your activities whenever I can.

Glad to see you're flamer-conscious.  Lucky that you haven't had
problems so far, but given the fact smoking is on the rise again
(especially cigars and pipes) and public attitudes towards smoking
bans seem not as enthusiastic as they used to be I think we can expect
the antis to get more and more extreme in their desparation.  Who
knows what they'll do next!  If HUD can sue people for using their 1st
amendment rights to free speech, I wonder what the NIH could pull on
us (but then again if Joycelyn Elders' brains were toilet paper she
wouldn't have enough to wipe her...well, you know).

In answer to a question you put to my compadre, Giant Briar, YES I'm
the same Steve Johnson who wrote those articles for the A &amp; M Gazette.
Neil Murray says he sent you a xerox of these pieces on a floppy, but
hasn't seen 'em in the digest yet.  The article on Clinton's health
care plan you can forget (at least for now - we may have to dust it
off for next year), but the other one has information that needs to
get out there.  If you never got Neil's disk please get in touch with
him.  I can also upload the file to you if necessary.  My next Gazette
article will be on the EPA secondhand smoke report, and I'll pass it
along to you as soon as it's done.  Let me know if you have PKZip,
'cause I prefer uploading &amp; downloading compressed files.

To close things off I want to let you know about our pipe &amp; cigar Expo
here in Los Angeles.  It'll be at the LAX Marriott on October 29 &amp; 30.
We also have exhibit space available for collectors, retailers,
suppliers &amp; pipemakers.  I'd appreciate it if you could let everyone
know about this event.  Anyone who wants more information can call me
at (310)820-9706, or e-mail me their snail mail address, and I'll send
'em a flyer.  I thank you for whatever you can do to help us publicize
the Expo!

Thanks again for getting in touch with me.  I'll look forward to being
involved with you guys!

P.S.  I service microscopes for a living, and one of our accounts is a
company called Pacesetters (they're out here in the San Fernando
Valley). They were acquired by Siemens a few years ago.  Does that
mean people who get a pacemaker made by this outfit get artificial
inSiemenation?  Ha, ha!
 (Warning:  I'm notorious for my puns.)   

[ Except that Pacesetters was sold, I think. A clear case of
conglomeratus interruptus. Yes, I'm still carrying Neil's disk around
in my valise, waiting for The Perfect Moment to upload... -S. ]

<a name="24">Subject: How are your teeth doing?</a>

I have been reading through some of the past history of the digest and 
find it is almost like a good novel.  I lost a few hours there reading 
about smashing your knuckles (if you're not careful) when you turn a pipe, 
you breaking your pipe (sorry I forgot the name of it - did you ever get 
it back?  Maybe I'll just have to keep reading on), breaking your bike 
and teeth on the side of the car (BTW how are they doing? - I expect the 
bike is no more but the teeth you would kind of have to get repaired).    
It may seem strange but all this, mixed in with the pipes, gets me in the 
mood for the Hobbit, a pipe, a big "comfy chair", and some ale (stout 
preferably).

Sorry, I began to wax philosophic there for a moment.  The reason I wrote 
was to ask a question about the handling of Meerschaum pipes.  I can't 
remember where but I read that you aren't supposed to hold on to them 
when you smoke them (unless it is by the stem) because the oils from your 
skin will damage their wax coating.  Is this true?  I am wondering 
because I tend to hold my briars by the bowl more than in my mouth and 
would find holding the stem awkward.  I would kind of like to find this 
out before I invest in a Meerschaum and then wreck it with a "bad" habit.

Also (please excuse the newbie sound of this question - but you don't 
learn unless you ask and I have never smoked a Meerschaum), do Meerschaums 
suit a particular blend of tobacco (i.e. do they do better with English 
blends rather than say cavendish)? 

Thanks   ~~?
JTH      8-)

[ Heard it both ways about the Meerschaums. And, my teeth are fine:
one has a big gold crown and three have HUGE fillings, but I can
finally chew again. -S. ]

Administrative notes: The Digest is going to be a bit irregular for
the next few weeks; I have a long weekend followed by a week-long
business trip to Erlangen, Germany. So if the Digest doesn't arrive on
Friday, don't panic!

Also, I've instituted an advertising policy. Simply stated: Once is
information, more than once is advertising. Members are free to post
about tobak-related items or services they sell commercially, provided
that it is done only once and is reasonably brief. (Of course, the
Resource Guide is forever... :-)

So with that, let us light up, enjoy the crisp autumn air and the
scent of the leaves and fine tobak, as we entertain thoughts of tins,
chin rests, history, Aikido, the Adirondacks, tins, tea, theatrics,
and tins...

<a name="2">Subject: Short BIO-VEJ1</a>

My puffing bio starts back in Martinsvile,VA .  It was there at the National
Theatre where customers and my staff used to "borrow" cigarettes.  Lucky
Strikes.  I smoked about 1/2 a pack a day, but my purchases were 4 packs a
day.

I had to stop this!

The solution was obvious at the local drug store...where I spotted a pipe and
two packs of Carter Hall for $2.00.  The pipe was no name "IMPORTED
BRIAR"..... I asked for domestic briar, but he drugist did not have any.  The
pipe broke the borrowing for about a week.

My two major "moochers" of ciggys switched to pipes and the borrowing of
tobacco was in full swing within a month.  It was less expensive than the
cigarettes.

Through service (USAF) and college  (UNC-Chapel Hill), and through several
jobs I continued with the pipe. I  built a small collection of Amphora pipes
(send in eight coupons and $$), Kaywoodies, and a series of  brandless
seconds.

My favorite tobaccos have always been mild aromatics with an occasional
experimental brand.  Carter Hall, Amphora, Flying Dutchman (when I could
afford it), Half &amp; Half, etc....etc....I think I have tried everything in the
drug stores.......Including "London Dock".
The tobacco that announces your arrival the second you enter a building.  It
had an affinity to HVAC systems.

About 12 years ago, here in Richmond, I attended the 2nd meeting of  Conclave
of Richmond Pipesmokers and started learning about tobbaco, briar, and
collectable pipes.  It was at this meeting I purchased my first pipe that
cost more than 25.oo.  It was an "American" and it smokes great.......I still
have it in my collection.

My current collection numbers about 300 pipes.  Many very
collectible.....some I smoke, others not.  The collection consists of
 briars, meershaums, rose woods, clay, and two corncobs.

In my collecting I pursue Larsens,  Ascorti,  American, and some others if
they have an interesting shape.  A 1924 Kaywoodie "chin rester" probably is
the most interesting shape and a Becker straight grain (perfect) modern bent
is probably my best pipe. I have not smoked either of the two.

The current tobacco is "AALBURG" from the Tinderbox and  I am looking forward
to their new release: "Chairman's Choice"...excellent smoke-----very mild, a
very slight flavor of fruit.  It burns very well and cool.

I have come to the following conclusion:  The pipes in the $60 - 150 range
will smoke MUCH better than the 16.00 drug store variety....BUT, beyond that
you are purchasing vanity wood and/or collectibles.......the increase in
price does not provide you with an equal amount of better smokability.  I
hope this statement will start a  friendly discussion.

The second conclusion of the day:  I better stop this verbal "puffing" and
return my attention to the pipe.

Happy Smoking!!!!!

I tried to mail you a couple of weeks ago, but the message was
logged as unknown. I have,once more got your address from the alt.pipes
net. I trust it is correct now.
I came across the pipe net whilst 'browsing'. I didn't think there were many of
us left now. Not too many in England, but we still keep going.
Could be the costs here are far more than most other countries.
I have been pipe smoking for some 40years, which doubtless sounds
geriatric. I started as a teenager, along with cigarettes, but a couple
of Uncles took me to their specialist pipe shop, where I was 'fitted'
with a suitable pipe &amp; given a sample 'fill of baccy'. Every day, on
my way back from school (or college) I went in for a fill of a different 
brand - until I found the one that suited me. I stuck with it for years
until the shop in Manchester (Thorburn Clarke) closed.  I used to buy
my pipes there -they made them &amp; they even made me a tiny pipe by cutting
down a real small model, when my son was born. It was the best thing for
teething too.  I must admit that my wife got a bit stroppy about the smell
 of the tobacco &amp; I now compromise with an aromatic.
Time to go back to my little room in the University - recogniseable cos it
has curls of smoke rolling under the door &amp; you need fog lamps to find
my desk - since, for some strange reason I haven't lit up today.
I'll keep browsing the net &amp; have indicated on our (genuine) internet
menu that I want to subscribe.

May your baccy never extinguish

For sale: Two meerschaum pipes to someone who will appreciate and cherish
them. One, 35 years old, hand carved billiard made by Joe Roth of New York
City, smooth with modern design on bowl. The other, 30 years old, bent
carved in Turkey with grapes and grape leaves pattern on bowl. Both coloring
nicely; both have had original screwshanks replaced with push. Reason for
selling is that I find I smoke my briars far more than these and it seems a
shame to have them languish on the rack. Price? Best offer for each/both.

<a name="5">Subject: fermented/EPA &amp; 2nd hand smoke</a>

Black tea is fermented similar to Louisiana Perique tobacco, in its own 
juices. Tea producers use machines to Cut, Tear, and Curl (CTC) the 
harvested leaves of the tea bush. Tearing will bruise the leaf to release 
the juices from its structure. This juice then ferments to change the 
character of the tea or tobacco. "Ferment" is a word that implies the use 
of yeast. I prefer the word "Fester". Bruised tea or tobacco leaves will 
pick up spores that grow in the released juice, festering to give the 
characteristic note to
the product.
++++++++++++++
So could you explain how the tobacco is altered between when it's picked 
and when I smoke it?  Being a homebrewer, I assume that the natural 
sugars in the plant are somehow altered.  In beer [et al] yeast perform 
this function.
And I found the Hobbit reference to enjoying some ale, then voiced a 
preference for a stout.  Stouts are generally fermented w/ lager yeasts 
and do not have the fruity characteristic of ales.

report, and I'll pass it along to you as soon as it's done.  Let me know 
if you have PKZip, 'cause I prefer uploading &amp; downloading compressed

I don't know about the other readers, but I would be VERY MUCH INTERESTED 
in hearing what you have to say.

<a name="6">Subject: Re: New </a>

         Who am I? Well I'm 28 years old. Started smoking cigarettes when I
was 11 or 12, and up until this year, when I found the cigar. 
          Actually it was Christmas Eve morning, and as usual just started my
shopping. On the way I figured I'd stop in the closest tobacco shop ( I was a
little pressed for time.) and get a pack of Prince cigarettes, the ones I
bought for special occassions. Normally I smoked those Marlboro Reds
(COUGH!!).
Anyway, this time, I was drawn into the humidor as if by divine intervention
and proceeded to peruse the cigar selection. I knew I was going to buy one,
but which one, there were so many? So I grabbed the one that like it was a
premium one by its price and box, a Pliades ?. As I lit up and started on my
way I realized I was driving slower than everybody else on the freeway and
not even stressed about the list of gifts I needed to complete within 6
hours. It didn't matter and the taste so smooth, and the stench normally
associated with cigars was gone. What was happening here? I was actually
enjoying the pleasures of smoking again. 
          I am now a cigar smoker and enjoy every minute of it. My current
choice is a Sosa Governer or Wavell. It is my daily meditation and therapy
session.
          It has been years since I sampled the pipe and admire those who can
keep it lit and not overheat it. Maybe I'll try it again someday.
          Thank you for starting my subscription I look foward to  future
issues and any back issues, FAQ's or other info you can send me. I'm new to
the Internet and how to find and retrieve information. I am also limited by
what AOL has to offer.
          Oh, by the way, my real name is Jeff Guarino. Thanks Again.

have to store them? There are about 2 megabytes' worth. -S. ]

Mr. Masticola,

        I am responding to your post about the Pipes Mailgroup.  I am
interested in receiving the group's "newsletter" or whatever it is
called.
        Also, I have another question that you may be able to answer
or at least enlist some reaction.  I would post it, but I have been
unable to successfully post to the USENet thus far; I'm rather new to
the Internet.
        I am curious about pipe smokers' opinions on tin tobacco as
opposed to tobacco measured from the smoke shop jar.  I note that
Dunhill has several mixtures available in tins, for example.
        Thank you.  I look forward to joining in the discussion.

Cordially,

Jay R. Dew

[ Tins obviously keep longer, and are thus more suited for aging.
Other than that, I've found that, like anything else, quality varies.
Any other thoughts? -S. ]

<a name="8">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #160 -- October 3, 1994</a>

Steve, thanks so much for continuing to maintain and mail the list: it's been a
source of good information and a spark for new interests in smoking.  Since I
finally appear to have some free time I'll drop out of lurk mode and introduce
myself.
I'm 24, a raving bachelor, and live in a cozy little apartment in Schenectady
NY where the landlords have outlawed cigarettes but make a special
dispensation for my pipes.  My daytime job is in engineering with GE gas
turbines, ever the competitor of Siemens.  (gosh, I hope THEY don't find out
I've been communicating with the enemy!:)  I'm also a part time grad student
at RPI, a dedicated student of Aikido, and an actor in local theater.  This
last activity has really caused a jump in my smoking in the past few weeks, as
opening night for Jesus Christ Superstar fast approaches and I still don't
have all my "hosanna heysannah"s ironed out.  I seem to recall some discussion
a few digests ago regarding beards and their correlation with pipe smoking:
 for the sake of science and data, I am one of those insipid goateed
twentysomethings.
I started smoking pipes as an ugrad at Boston University, through my
involvement with student theater.  At all the parties everyone smoked
cigarettes.  I didn't like the smell, so I started smoking pipes to surround
myself with smoke I did like.  (a more creative option, i think, than
screaming and legislating)  Ever the practical engineer, I tried it out first
as cheaply as possible with a corncob and a small bag of generic junk from
CVS.  Later I came to know Peretti's and Ehrlich's well.  Cigars came much
later, in fact only last year.  These I only smoke when I'm at a pub or
restaurant that carries a good selection, since I don't smoke enough to
justify investing in a humidor and keeping a stock at home.
My favorite pipes right now are a well-aged, well-tanned meerschaum of bent
bulldog shape and a bee-yootiful Peterson.  If I'm going to be smoking
outdoors for an extended time I use a Peterson second.  My favorite tobacco is
called Adirondack Blend, available from Pipe&amp;Book in Lake Placid NY.  I just
go up there (~2 hrs) whenever I`m low and get another few pounds.  I have no
idea what's in it, only that it's cavendish based.  Next time I go I will try
to get the formula.
My interests right now include learning more about cigars and finding a good
one to keep a stock of, as I'm starting to enjoy cigars more and more.  I've
been raiding antique stores and estate sales lookign for an antique humidor,
too.  Well, I'm off again... (lurk,lurk,lurk)

[ Thanks for the note, Richard! I remember trying, and liking, the
Adirondack Blend too. -S. ]

<a name="9">Subject: Intro &amp; taking the plunge</a>

I thought I'd delurk and introduce. I've been toying with the idea of replacing
my semi-regular cigarettes with pipe and cigars for some time, and regular
reading of alt.smokers.pipes and the pipes webpage have pushed me over the
edge. A pipe might look a little odd in the mouth of a 25 yr old, but I'm sure
I'll grow into it. Tomorrow, I shall go forth and purchase a corn-cob and some
Amphora... and there's a nice looking briar I've got my eye on. 

The pipe smoking fraternity (are there any women among you?) must form the
most mellow part of the internet I've come across in a long bout of netsurfing,
and I can't help but think that the gentlemanly and relaxed attitude of those
who post to the Digest and a.s.pipes plays a part in my decision to take up the
pipe. And my wife certainly approves of the repeated injunctions to check
spousal preferences when choosing tobacco.

I wonder - are there any subscribers to the digest from this part of the world?
Good tobacconists in New Zealand are hard to find, and while I've had pleasant
chats with the owners of the two (Yup - two) halfway decent tobacconists in
Hamilton, I'd like to explore the resources in other parts of this country as
well. 

It's a great job you're doing there Steve. Good on you.

To fellow pipe smokers:

        I am new to the group here, so I hope my comments and
questions are welcome and germane.
        First, as requested for new members, a little about myself.
I am a 23 year old graduate student at the University of Oklahoma,
where I am working toward the PhD in history.  In spite of the poor
job market and low financial rewards, I think a career as a history
professor would suit me.  I study American history in general, the
American West in particular, and still more specifically, issues of
violence, justice, and legal history.  If any of you share these
interests, please do not hesitate to e-mail me.  I'm sure some of my
colleagues are lurking about in this group.  When I am not reading
history, I love a good mystery.  I am particularly fond of Mr.
Holmes, another devotee of the pipe.
        Now, on to pipes. I've been a pipe smoker for only about
three years, and it tends to go in cycles.  A lot of it has to do
with the weather, as I rarely smoke indoors.  Summers here in the
Southwest don't make outdoor smoking a very pleasant activity.
During the winter, on the other hand, I very much enjoy the briar on
a crisp morning or clear evening.
        Until only recently, the pipes I smoked were relatively
cheap.  Finally I mustered up the nerve to purchase a better quality
one--and what a difference!  I plan to save and scrounge so that I
can replace my old pipes with new ones, but that will be a slow
process.  For now, going through the rotation of my pipes is an odd
experience: bad, bad, bad, GOOD, bad, etc.
        Enough about me.  While I have your attention, I'd like to
offer a question for discussion.
        I am curious about pipe smokers' opinions on tin tobacco as
opposed to tobacco measured from the smoke shop jar.  I note that
Dunhill has several mixtures available in tins, for example.
        With that, I bid you all farewell and take your leave

        After reading your news group for the last few weeks, I've
decided to post.  I'll forgo the traditional smokers bio for now, but
I'll climb my electronic pulpit and begin...  I have recently
celebrated my first decade as a pipe smoker and feel as engrossed in
the ritual today, as I did with my first Algerian Briar billiard
shaped pipe bought at the tender age of sixteen from Blatter and
Blatter in Montreal.
	The key to complete smoking enjoyment, I believe, is not to be
addicted to tobacco.  I know that this is no mean feat, but consider
the following:
 Part of the pleasure, along with the aroma, taste...  of the pipe is
the domestication of fire and the extreme control one has over keeping
the pipe lit while not having it burn too strong. This pleasure is
surely minimized if the act of smoking is no longer a choice but a
need.  In fact, an absolute contradiction arises in enjoying the
control you exercise in your pipe bowl, yet not having control of your
own will.  I smoke two or three times a week, on average, more in the
spring and fall, less in the summer. An added pleasure is added to my
smoking, by walking the addiction highwire (must be a Catholic thing).
Could I choose not to have that next smoke, or is the need so great
that it becomes difficult to resist?  When I feel less control over my
own decisions, I know its time to cut back and perhaps do without for
a few weeks. What fun! you say. Well try it and I'm sure you'll
appreciate the new gained self control, and mastery of your wants and
desires.  Furthermore, because the act of smoking is somewhat
infrequent, each smoke is special.  Each is given the proper
ceremonial process and sufficient time is allocated to this noteworthy
event.
	My method also gives you a justified smugness towards other
smokers: The familiar justification that pipe smoking _is_ different
is reinforced.  The instant gratification of the cigarettes is far
removed from the original spiritual and ceremonial uses of the blessed
leaf.  I certainly don't mean to lapse into new-age pop philosophy,
but I believe that many simple every day acts can be improved on if
one devotes even a moment of thought to them.  Many pipe smokers I
see, seem to have lost the _spirit_ of pipe smoking. They smoke pipe
after pipe without ever taking account of what it is they are doing.
These people are better suited to the cigarette and have found
themselves in pipeland for all the wrong reasons.  I believe pipe
smoking should be practiced infrequently (certainly never more then
twice a day), to maximize enjoyment, increase self awareness, and self
control and finally to keep pipe smoking the extraordinary event it
should be.
	Obviously, individuals that partake in something as
interesting as a pipe smokers discussion group are unlikely to be
clueless smokers, and this is part of the pleasure of subscribing to
this list.  Keep up the great job.

pb.

P.S.  I don't know if Blatter and Blatter are listed in your reference
guide, but if they are not, let me know and I'll hunt down the
information.  In my opinion, they have the finest large bowl pipes in
North America. They also have a complete catalogue and if I remember
correctly, they do sell by mail.

[ No, they're not, but I'd be happy to put them in if you can furnish
an address. And I agree about the choice between addiction and
pleasure.  "Moderation in all things," said Publius Terentius Afer; I
take this to mean a middle road between austerity and overindulgence. -S. ]

October 5, 1994.
?????@???.???.???

     We are having some beautiful fall weather here in Oklahoma.
Fine time to indulge in *Aroma Therapy*, out in the garden with a
folding leather pouch of Balkan Sobranie's 759, and a Dublin from
Peterson's Emerald line.

     "Pipe Digest #159" contained a qualm or two with smoking as it
affects the health of the smoker. Life, gentlemen and ladies, is a
risky business. What would you have, one hundred years of mediocre
existence, or seventy really good years? Unless you are inhaling
cigar and pipe smoke into your lungs, you shouldn't have too much
risk of damaging your health. Health of cigarette smokers is at
most risk. Carl Weber's "Guide to Pipes and Pipe Smoking" has a
chapter devoted to the Surgeon General's Report on Smoking. Anyone
smoking cigarettes should consider changing to a pipe or cigars and
stop inhaling smoke into the lungs; emphysema can be the result of
long-term inhalation, as can a weakened heart. Weber thinks that
inhaling smoke produces a mildly erotic shock of asphyxiation, once
the smoker gets over the urge to choke, which is why people like to
do it. He says that pipe smokers shouldn't take smoke into the
lungs. Nicotine from the strong pipe tobacco is easily absorbed
into the bloodstream through the soft tissues of the mouth and
nasal passages. I can testify this as a fact.

     My Dad was a pipe and cigarette smoker of fifty years
standing. He quit, eventually, and is still with us at age seventy-
six. My early smokes were Will's Whiffs, Mannikin, and Hamlet
cigars none of which did much for me beyond the pleasant aroma.
Somehow, my Dad acquired a couple of clay cutty's one of which I
loaded with some dried shreds of Gold Block, gleaned from the Old
Man's spent tins. After lighting with a Swan Vesta, I puffed away
much as I do now, without inhaling to the lungs. Within five
minutes I was overcome by dizziness and a powerful feeling of
nausea ameliorated by lying on the floor. Not feeling much better,
I crawled off to bed to sleep off the headache and palpitating
heart produced by the nicotine from strong tobacco in a new clay
pipe, absorbed through the lining of my mouth.

     These days I enjoy strong tobacco in a decent briar, smoking
at a more leisurely, contemplative pace. "Weber's Guide to Pipes
and Pipe Smoking" is a Rutledge Book, ISBN 0-87469-037-4. It is a
good introduction, worth the $5 I paid Ted's Pipe Shop in Tulsa.
They had a stack of these books for sale. Twelve chapters are its
compass:

               1.   Why Smoke?
               2.   The Surgeon General's Report.
               3.   The Early History of Smoking.
               4.   The Later History of Smoking.
               5.   Many Kinds of Pipe.
               6.   The King of Pipes.
               7.   The Pipe for You.
               8.   The Tobacco for You
               9.   How to Enjoy Smoking a Pipe
               10   Pipe Accessories
               11.  Pipe Etiquette.
               12.  Pipe Smoking for Women.

          Give a man a pipe he can smoke,
          Give a man a book he can read:
          And his home is bright with a calm delight,
          Though the room be poor indeed.

                                   James Thomson.

     Georges Herment says in his book "The Pipe" that clay pipes
give the best smoke once they are seasoned. He warns the novice
smoker to be prepared to be shaken to the core by smoking a clay
pipe; he is quite correct. Herment says that the best way to season
a clay is to gently smoke it occasionally, in sequence with one's
briars. Start out by smoking the clay pipe infrequently, increasing
the frequency as its seasoning improves. He says that to persevere
with a clay pipe will be well worth the dedicated smoker's effort.

     Despite popular myth, Conan Doyle's character Sherlock Holmes
was not given to smoking a calabash. Watson tells us that Holmes
favourite pipe was a blackened clay. Not only that, Holmes' first
pipe of the day was charged with the dottles of the previous days
smokes; now that's what I call a jump-start.

     While we are talking about dottles, I recall, aged about six
or seven years, travelling to school in London by London Transport
Omnibus. Smoking was permitted on the upper-deck. Up there the
tougher school kids scavenged under the seats for cigarette ends.
These were carefully broken apart, the tobacco being saved in an
old tobacco tin in which, together with the tobacco from numerous
dog-ends, was kept a packet of cigarette papers and a few strike-
anywhere matches. Once each kid collected enough tobacco they would
roll a fresh cigarette and light up; makes me sick just thinking of
it.

     In "Pipe Digest #160" we talked a bit about tea, should anyone
be interested in reliable supplies of Lapsang Souchong and other
fine teas, write to the following address:

                    Whittard of Chelsea,
                    73 Northcote Road,
                    London SW11 6PJ,
                    England, G. B.

                    Tel: 011-44-71-924-1888 from USA
                    Fax: 011-44-71-924-3085 from USA

Request their catalogue. They accept Mastercard and Visa, and ship
anywhere in the world. Even with the cost of airmail postage, tea
is cheaper from England than from the local grocery store here in
the States.

     Northcote Road is at the bottom of Battersea Rise, which leads
to Clapham Common where E. M. Forster's paternal family lived for
many years. Sadly, their house is no more. Forster is he of "A
Passage to India" fame. A good book to go with a pipe.

     Next time I will talk more about Georges Herment's book "The
Pipe" and H. M. Tomlinson's book "The Sea and the Jungle". Both
books refer to pipes and tobacco and may be enjoyed in company with
the reader and his or her pipe.

Hello Steve,

The PipeDigest running very good, don't you think so! Thanks
for all the work you are putting in it! Also the WWW-server
(<a href="http://www.craycos.com/~beaty/pipes/pipes.html)">http://www.craycos.com/~beaty/pipes/pipes.html)</a> is good.

I have two things:
- is it possible to put a distribution list on your digest. I
just have set up a Dutch distribution list on cigars. People
can say they thing about the smoking habit. In this case most
will be related to the Dutch enviroment. It I would like to
provide these people automaticaly with your digest. Is this
possibel (it could decrease the traffic between Holland and
US;-). The name of the list is: [deleted -S.]. There
will be no automatic traffic van this list to you.
Anyway: Could you also incorporate this Dutch distribution
list in your reference guide? The name is:
[deleted -S.].  Subscribtions to:
?????@????.????.??.???.??
- with regard to smoking over the nose. It is a method to find
out if a cigar is sharp. One can experience the sharpness of a
cigar much better over the nose (because the nose is more
delicate).

All the best,

Victor

[ With Victor's consent, I edited the name of the Dutch cigar digest
mail reflector out to prevent it from getting mailbombed, now that
anyone can read the Resource Guide and the back issues of the
Digest. And, yes, I think the mailgroup is doing famously; one of my
more successful endeavours currently! Thanks for organizing the Dutch
cigar list, Victor! -S. ]

Steve,
Just a note about an article in my local paper, The Columbus (OH) Dispatch..
taked a little about the Cigar Dinners being held by a local tobacco store (
Smoker's Haven - Downtown ) and the fact that cigar smoking is coming into
vougue. The accompanying photo was one of an attractive woman smoking a
cigar. Be still, my heart. ( according to the artical there were about 10
women there, to 60 or so men ) In a way, I'm glad to see that more people are
coming to realize the pleasure to be had in a fine cigar ( the article quoted
someone referring to the fact that a cigar is something NOT to be rushed ),
on the other hand, I hope the trend is not to make cigar smoking " common."
  (( well.. as common as could be expected considring the political/social
climate of the hour ))
Anyway.... Smoke in Peace.   :-)\U~~~

[ Thanks, Gideon! Perhaps if you could provide us with the details,
some of our other Columbus-based readers would be interested. -S. ]

Dear Sir,
  Many thanks for the subscription to Pipes Digest.  It looks like many hours
of great reading ahead.
  You asked for a short bio on me, so I'll tell you a little about myself.
 I'm 40 years old and have been a cigar smoker for more years than I care to
remember.  I prefer rich, strong Honduran cigars such as Hoyo de Monterrey
and Punch.  I also like Mexican cigars like Te Amo.  Whatever I smoke, I can
assure you that it will be in the sweet maduro wrapper!
  I'm also a woodworker and have drawn a set of plans for cigar humidors with
complete assembly instructions.  I would like very much to advertise my
humidor plans in future issues of Pipes Digest so that your readers can save
hundreds of dollars by "building their own".  Please advise me as to the
details of advertisment.
  Well, I hear a Hoyo rothschild calling me.  Thanks again, and I remain
                                  Sincerely,
                                         Chavete

[ later... -S. ]

&gt;&gt;Re advertisement, just give me your snailmail address and I'll put it
in the Resource Guide. You're welcome to publish it in one issue of
the Digest, too.

Thanks -- I've encountered a lot of people trying to find humidor
plans!&lt;&lt;

Thanks!  My snailmail address is: Chavete, PO Box 5561, Slidell, LA 70469

I sell plans to build a humidor that can fit any budget and
woodworking ability.  And the price is right, too.  5 dollars ( a
five-dollar bill, no checks) gets you precise drawings and three page
cutting, gluing, clamping, assembly, and finishing instructions for
building a humidor from easy-to-get materials.
  
I would like to advertise in the Digest whenever possible.

         a thousand thanks!
                        Chavete

[ See above regarding the Digest advertising policy. I know there are
a lot of people who would appreciate humidor plans, so I hope some of
our woodworking members avail themselves. -S. ]

Steve, I've edited Duvall's FAQ in PageMaker for printing,
30+ pages, wondered if it would be kosher to offer the
print version for $3 to cover copying &amp; postage, will post it
on this BBS and offer it free via E-mail to whomsoever wants
it in ASCII if they give me an adress. I figure Kinko's at
.06 per page + .53 postage and a nickel for an envelope.
If you think it ok I'll post an "ad" for the service on
the cigar/pipe usenet. Let me know. Should be ready by
this Monday coming.

[ Fine, Ray! I've also edited the FAQ into plain ASCII, and have asked

Hi,

I found your www site and checked out some of the Pipes Digest articles.  
It's great, sign me up!

I started smoking a pipe a little less than a year ago and took to it 
like a fish to water.  I'm 31 and still asking myself where I have been 
all these years...  I find I have a penchant for a lot of the English 
blends, in particular Highland targe and Black Mallory.  I still smoke 
some aromatics though, depending on my mood.

None of my friends smoke a pipe, so it feels a bit strange at times and 
I'm just starting to smoke in public.  I've noticed I really enjoy my 
pipe a lot while I walk through the city from point A to point B.

Look forward to getting Pipes Digest.  Thanks 

Kevin

<a name="5">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #161 -- October 7, 1994</a>

Steve,

A little about myself...  I am 25 and have been smoking cigars for just 
about a year now.  I started with machine made Garcia Vegas (which I 
still pick up once in a while because they bring back a lot of great 
memories).  I am very much into fine Dominican Aged Dunhills right now.  
The Altamira is a fantastic mild smoke.  The Don Thomas Rothchild Maduro 
is another.  

I can only echo what others have said plenty of times about the great 
enjoyment I get from smoking cigars and the excellent means of reducing 
stress.  Reminds me of a debate i got tangled up in with an Human 
Relations interviewer at a company I was applying to who asked me how I 
handled stress.  When I told her about my love of cigars, she launched 
into the company's "No-Smoking" policies and the "tremendous" health 
risks I was placing on myself.  It was a losing battle, not because she 
was right, but because she had already made up her mind and there was 
nothing I could do to change it.  But it was interesting how she got all 
worked up over this while I stayed calm and collective.  I thought that, 
most of all, made the very point I was trying to get across.  Apparently 
she didn't like having that pointed out... :)

Anyway, thanks for the great work here, Steve.  Hopefully in a wekk or 
two I will be able to announce the completion of a Humidor FAQ.  It is 
geared for cigar smokers but perhaps the information will also benefit 
pipe smokers as well.  Principle work is completed on it and when some 
minor revisions and clarifications are copmlete, I will make it available 
to anyone who wants a copy.  Happy smoking, all!

Mike

[ Sounds like that interviewer was a clear case for a MYOB... In any
case, welcome! And we've seen the FAQ, and it's up for public access,
as I mentioned. A little too long to put in the Digest. -S. ]

<a name="6">Subject: An introduction.</a>

     I could sit for hours smoking my GBD bulldog full of my Holmes blend in 
front of my well worn keyboard and still not be able to fully express my 
appreciation for the wonderful gift of this electronic serial.  Pipe smokers 
seem to be a rather private bunch, when all is said and done.  There are far 
too few *local* organizations, much less an international forum for discussion 
of briar and tobak.  Many thanks, Steve, and also to all of you who are regular
contributors and make this serial a success.

     A few, brief, words about myself.  I spent 22 years of my life hating 
tobacco and everything about it.  My father smokes Lucky Strikes, three packs a
day, and I associated all tobacco with this habit.  I was fortunate to meet one
Ernie Sparks, a pharmacist and drummer in a Dixie band I recently joined.  (I 
am a clarinetist)  He is an avid cigar smoker, and introduced me to the 
pleasures within.  I soon decided that cigars were too harsh for my taste (I 
was, at the time, fundamentally ignorant of the difference between hand and 
machine rolled), so on the suggestion of my local Tinder Box tobacconist, I 
bought a little twenty dollar billiard and an ounce of their Anniversary blend.
 Love at first smoke.  I am now, three months later, the proud owner of a 
Savinelli, a GBD bulldog, and my first ever real hobby that is purely for 
pleasure.

     The Columbus pipe scene is odd.  Never have I seen so many people so 
itching for companionship and so shy at the same time.  There are five decent 
to great pipe shops in Columbus, including the aforementioned (#160) S&amp;R 
Pipemakers.  (BTW, you ought to include the fact that there is a retail store 
at that same address, Pipes and Pleasures)  There are enough pipe smokers to 
keep all of these shops afloat and well stocked.  However, it seems that even 
an informal attempt at getting pipeists together falls flat on itUs face.  A 
pity, really, as those whom I have met are some class personalities.

     Rambling on ... I have yet to hitch up my Jansport and walk 20 miles into 
nowhere and smoke my favorite English blend in front of a blazing fire.  
Camping and puffing seem to have some mystical link that I am eager to 
discover.  Any accomplished hikers with a suggested blend?  I have my eyes, and
budget, set on a Nording Signature freehand that would seem to be the ultimate 
camping pipe.  Perhaps I will find the time yet.  My wife is also eager, and is
pestering my regularly, but time is so elusive ...

     I am currently diving deep into the history of smoking.  Recently read the
Coti treatise, RA history of smokingS, I think was itUs title; also the Dunhill
pipe book, whose title escapes me at the moment.  I am about to start the 
Fairholt RTobacco: itUs history and associationsS.  The Pipes and Pleasures 
shop I mentioned has quite a stock of back issues of pipe periodicals, and I am
looking into a purchase after my next gig check comes ... I will forward any 
interesting history therewithin.  Issues date back as far as T77 - a fine year.

     I look forward to associating with you all over the course of my long and 
hopefully happy computer career.  My mailbox is always open, so please drop a 
line!!  Always glad to discuss Dunhill cigars or the RISC chip.

     Friends,
          Sempf

[ Welcome, and fidelis, Sempf! My guess is that the regulatory
pressure in Columbus is probably not yet harsh enough for people to
have to band together, as they have done in Los Angeles under Steve
Johnson's tutelage. -S. ]

attached is a contribution for the digest.

Btw, I am sorry I can't give you recommendations on Nurnberg or Erlangen
(both cities are close together). As a general hint: I would rather look
in Nurnberg, since it is bigger than Erlangen (at least as far as I
remember). If you don't get any hints from other people, here is a general
advise which should work in every bigger German city: Go to the tobacconist
at the railway station, buy some pipe cleaners (to be polite...) and ask
if he/she can recommend a pipe shop in the city. (If they should sell pipes
as well and you are a _very_ polite person, you can start with asking if
they have filterless pipes, which is very unlikely...).

	Joachim.

For the digest:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trip to Switzerland.

My  personal  preference in  pipe  is much towards  smallish, filterless
models in classic shapes; a consequence  of this is  that it is hard for
me to find pipes for myself in Germany: people here seem to prefer large
bowls and 95% of all pipes sold here  come with 9mm filters. I therefore
always enjoy trips to other countries and look around for pipes.

This  week, I spend three  days  in Zurich, Switzerland, officially  for
attending a  workshop on Logic  Programming.   Compared to Germany, both
pipes  and tobacco are  about  20-30% cheaper  there,  so I try to visit
Switzerland as  often  as I can.  Fortunately,  I  live only  two  hours
away...

Swiss  shops usually  have a  good selection of  filterless  pipes, esp.
English  and Italian ones.   Furthermore,  tobacconists  can sell  loose
tobacco, which is forbidden in Germany due to tax regulations.

I took a half a day off the conference and visited Roman Peter, the only
Swiss freehand designer. Here is his address (for the resource guide):
	
	Roman Peter
	Obere Bahnhofstrasse 17
	CH-8910 Affoltern a. Ablis
	Phone: ++ 41 1 7616303

Affoltern am Albis  is not far  away from Zurich, and  can be reached by
train (S9) from  Zurich main station  in about 30 minutes. (Be  careful:
there  is  also  another  "Affoltern", which  belongs   to the   city of
Zurich!).

Roman Peter's shop is close to the railway station in Affoltern: leaving
the   station and  heading  a  bit to  the left   leads   to the "Untere
Bahnhofstrasse". The shop is less than 500 meters away from the station.

Roman  himself is a very  nice person and I   spend quite a while inside
taking pipes and browsing through the pipes he offers. The shop is quite
small and does not offer a huge, but a fine selection of pipes. Roman is
a pipe maker  since about 10 years; he  is making very  nice free-hands,
many of them quite unusual, and some closer to being  a sculpture than a
pipe. He is only using excellent wood, which makes  even the large pipes
quite light. Prices start around 350.- Swiss Francs (roughly US$ 250.-),
and most are  below 1000.- Francs.  Unfortunately, he  had only about 20
of  his models available.  There are usually  more in the shop, he said,
but he had sold a lot after a recent far of his pipes.

If I would be into big pipes, I would surely have bought at least one of
his pipes. However,  for some obscure  reason, I  prefer  small over big
ones and he had only two smallish pieces available. Both had a polished,
black finish. One   was close to a Prince,   the other quite   unusually
shaped; a bit like this:
    ______
   /      \ 
  |/|    |\|
    |    |
    |    ------------------
    -----------------------

Well, far away from the original, but I hope it gives you an idea...

I   decided not to   go for a   black  pipe since  I  like natural wood.
However, I will surely visit him  again when I  happen to be around next
time (probably around X-Mass).

So, I looked for the other pipes on display (about 200 pipes): besides a
lot  of Petersons (as often  found in Swiss shops),  he offers some nice
Danish  models, and a good (though  not huge)  selection of Savinelli's.
Among these, I spotted a couple of older Savinelli's without filters and
quickly identified a reasonably priced "punto oro"  Canadian as a future
companion of mine.

All together, I definitely recommend paying  a visit to Roman Peter when
you have  the  opportunity.  Unfortunately he  does  not  do  mail order
business (too  much fuss with customs, insurance,  etc, he said).  He is
also willing to  adapt your own  ideas on pipes  and make  your personal
pipe (within 2 weeks or so).

After my visit in Affoltern, I headed back for Zurich and briefly looked
around for  other shops, there.   I did  not  have much  time left, so I
restricted my search to Zurich's  "Bahnhofstrasse", _the_ major shopping
street in Switzerland.  I found three  tobacco shops within the first 15
minutes; all  in  this street  (Sorry, I  did not  wrote down the  their
names/addresses, but they are easy to find):

Directly  in front  of  the main station,  there is  one  of the typical
high-class tobacco shops: plenty of Dunhills, Charatans, and Savinellis,
plus a lot of  Davidoff pipes (btw, does anyone  have one and would care
to tell us a bit about them?).  Furthermore, they offer some nice German
and Danish freehands.  It appeared a bit pricy to me but is surely worth
to drop in when you are around.

Some 300  meters down  the Bahnhofstrasse  is the next  one: a  bit more
classically  oriented  than the  first,  but  again loads  of  Dunhills,
Davidoffs, Petersons, Charatan and so on.

In both shops I asked  for Ashton pipes, since I  always wanted to check
them out, but  they did not have any.  Ashtons seem to  be quite hard to
find...

The next  shop comes again  after some  300 meters on  the  left. It was
already 6.30 pm, so I  did  not go in  (all  shops close at 6.30).  From
outside, it appears  to have specialized  in Savinellis (and, of course,
Dunhills).

On my way home from Zurich stopped in Basel for visiting "Pfeifen Wolf",
a tobacco  shop in  Basel,  well  worth  visiting.   He specializes   in
Stanwells, but offers a wide selection of Peterson, Amorelli, and Mastro
de  Paya as well  (and also  the usual Dunhills).    I am currently most
interested in  Mastro de Paya and  looked browsed through the roughly 50
models  they  had in stock.   After  a long time,   a bought a beautiful
Dublin. Superb smoke and very good value for money!

Pfeifen Wolf is also famous  for his tobacco, so  I selected some of his
house mixtures. Fortunately, customs between  Germany and Switzerland is
virtually non-existent, so smuggling is not a big risk...

You can find the shop as follows: when  at the Marktplatz (Market Place)
in Basel, take  the street that leads  to  the railway  station. Pfeifen
Wolf is on the right-hand side after 50 meters.

Steve,

I joined your Pipes mailgroup some time ago. I've been meaning to take some
free time to send you a bio. Free time seems to be very scarce lately, so
I'll just fire up a pipe and ignore other things to get this off to you.

My name is John Haldeman. I'm 52 years old. I'm retired after 20 years from
the U.S. Coast Guard. I'm currently working as a technical writer here in
Oklahoma City.

I smoke a pipe and an occasional cigar. I think my smoking preference may
be hereditary. My father and his father smoked pipes. My other grandfather
smoked only cigars.

I currently have eight pipes, seven briars and a meerschaum. The meerschaum
is an SMS from Turkey. The briars include a Radice, a Caminetto, a GBD, a
Pipa Croci, and three Ardors.

I buy my pipes, tobacco, and cigars from shops owned by a father and son.
They have three shops; Royal Pipes near the University of Oklahoma campus
in Norman, Plantations in Sooner Fashion Mall also in Norman, and
Plantations in Crossroads Mall in Oklahoma City.

My everyday tobacco is called Decade. It's a bulk blend described as half
lemon and orange Virginia English cut and half black toasted ribbon cut. I
don't believe this descriptionis too accurate because I recognize the
Latakia that is part of the blend. I tried a lot of different blends before
I settled on Decade. It was the only blend that I could smoke and enjoy all
day every day. Also, it gets nothing but favorable comments from people who
smell it burning.

My pipe's just about done so I'll close this. Keep up the good work. I hope
you derive as much satisfaction from creating the Pipes Digest as I do
enjoyment from reading it.

Lately, I've become dissatisfied with my cigarettes (Nat Sherman's 
Virginia Circles) and as a consequnce have been smoking cigars
and my pipe a little more frequently.

I've been smoking a tobacco called "Golden Pleasure" that I get
here in Pittsburgh at Poor Richard's Smokeshop in Station Square.
I'm pleased to report that I can keep the pipe lit for some quite
long stretches now, after two years of practice. Beginners, don't
get discouraged! I'm beginning to get good enought at it that I
think I might move up to a slightly larger bowl size. Currently,
my meerschaum bowl is very small and doesn't last very long,
especially now that it stays lit.

This weekend I bought two different sizes of "Por Larran~aga"
cigars by recommendation of the shop owner. I was very pleased
with the mild taste of the one I smoked, but I still can't get
myself to smoke those large cigars. This one was only about 3/4"
in diameter and about seven inches long, but it was too much
tobacco for me! I could only smoke about 2/3rds of it, and then I
had to give up. This did give me the opportunity to dissect the
remainder, which I have never done before and would recommend to
anyone who finds themself with too much cigar. I guess I never
before understood that good cigars are made of BIG LEAVES all
rolled together. 

In the near future, I have two social smoking activities planned.
For one, a local bar (Kangaroos on McKnight road, for you yinzers
on the list) is starting a weekly event to sit around smoking
cigars, drinking port, and discussing current events like we live
in a real democracy. For the other, I'm finally going to screw up
my courage and go to Bloom's Cigar Camp on Saturday.  It's a
historic cigar store in Pittsburgh's South Side, and people go
there to sit on the couches and smoke all day. Wish me luck, may
I not look like a fool.

A "Chin rester" has a sharply bent stem downward followed by straight section
about 1 1/2 inches below mouth and then the bowl.

The idea is that you do not have to clamp very hard to hold the pipe in your

		   PIPES, CIGARS AND PUBLIC POLICY

		       THE OFFICIAL SMOKESCREEN

			  By Stephen Johnson

Things are tough for smokers these days, and they're getting tougher
all the time.  The case against cigarettes has been well documented.
But are Americans getting the complete, factual story about the health
effects of pipe and cigar smoking?  The answer to this question is
quite revealing, not only because of what's in the medical literature,
but also because of what it says about how the war on tobacco is being
waged.

A BRIEF HISTORY

The first U.S. Government report on smoking and health was issued in
1964 by then-Surgeon General Luther Terry.  This document was the
first public disclosure about the dangers inherent in cigarette
smoking.  What the report said about pipes and cigars was, however a
different story.  In fact, Dr. Terry concluded: "For smokers of cigars
only or of pipes only, three of the studies [examined] show small
increases in over-all death rates, ranging from 5% to 11%.  The
[American Cancer Society] study of men in 25 states, however, gives
slight decreases for both types, as does the study of British doctors
for the two types combined."  Incidentally, it should be mentioned
that a risk increase of up to 11% is considered by researchers to be
within the parameters of statistical error.

The Surgeon General's report of 1964 is notable for its reasonably
unbiased presentation of data.  16 years later we had C. Everett Koop
as Surgeon General, and things were very much different.  In fact
Koop's 1982-83 reports on smoking and health set the tone for all
subsequent reports by unconditionally blasting all forms of smoking.
An examination of three particular studies raises some disturbing
implications about how official advocacy has interfered with what the
public has been told since that time.

THE NUMBERS GAME

Two of the studies in question were cited in both the 1964 and 1982-83
reports.  Both were done by the American Cancer Society, one being a
study of men in 9 states, the other being the above-mentioned 25-State
study.  Let's examine the 25-State study first.  This study began in
1958, so it was still under way at the time of the 1964 Surgeon
General's report.  It concluded in 1978.  Here are the mortality
ratios from that study as cited by both Surgeons General:

1964  Report        1982-83 Report

Nonsmokers
                                                                         
1.0                       1.0

Cigarette Smokers                                                     
1.83                      1.79

Pipe Smokers                                                                
.86                       1.18

Cigar Smokers
                                                                         
.97                       1.18

Since the 25-State study ended in 1978, the 1982-83 report quoted the
final result.  What Dr. Koop failed to mention was that the mortality
ratios he reported for pipe and cigar smokers represented an increase
over findings made earlier in the study.  In the world of research,
this is a critical omission, and certainly one which deserves
scrutiny.  C. Everett Koop's belligerent anti-tobacco advocacy has
been legendary, and provides two very plausible reasons for what might
seem to be merely a small oversight.  The first, and most obvious, is
the fact that in 1964 the American Cancer Society found pipe and cigar
smokers to be outliving nonsmokers - something which Dr. Koop no doubt
would have found inconvenient in touting his cause.  The second reason
relates directly to the sponsor of the study itself.  In the mid-1960s
the ACS began taking a more activist anti-smoking stance.  By the late
'70s it had become one of the most prominent forces in the
anti-tobacco crusade.  This being the case, an examination of the
inconsistencies in the 25-State study would suggest the possibility of
agenda-driven bias in the final outcome of that study.  Is it possible
that Koop's treatment of the 25-State study was designed to keep
inquiring minds from reaching their own conclusions?  We will probably
never know the answer to that question, but one thing is clear - Koop
was at best guilty of professional, and perhaps even deliberate
ignorance in this case.

The real eye-opener comes with the American Cancer Society's 9-State
study.  This study was concluded in 1958.  Once again, here are the
numbers reported by both Surgeons General:

1964  Report        1982-83 Report

Nonsmokers                                                                 
1.0                       1.0

Cigarette Smokers                                                     
1.70                      1.97

Pipe Smokers                                                              
1.05                      1.44

Cigar Smokers                                                           
1.10                      1.34

Since the 9-State study ended in 1958 the results reported by Koop
should have been the same as those in the 1964 report.  BUT THEY ARE
NOT.  Yet another - and more blatant - inconsistency had been served
up to the American public, and again without an explanation.

MISSING DATA

The third study in question was released by Northwestern Pennsylvania
University in 1975.  It was conducted by a group called "No Other
World," with the assistance of regional chapters of the American
Cancer Society, American Heart Association, and American Lung
Association.  The study involved longevity, and while the results did
not bode well for cigarette smokers, its findings on pipe and cigar
smoking are very interesting.  The study found that moderate cigar
smokers live as long as nonsmokers, while those cigar smokers who
smoke more than three cigars a day experience a slight decrease in
longevity.  The results for pipe smokers were surprising: According to
the study, pipe smokers outlive nonsmokers by an average of two years!
Even more surprising were the findings that heavy pipe smoking did not
change this, and that pipe smokers don't seem to gain any longevity
benefit by quitting.  While the study was good news for pipe and cigar
smokers, its data never appeared in the reports made by Surgeon
General C. Everett Koop.  Incidentally, a similar longevity study was
done in 1985 by the University of Dublin, Ireland.  Its findings
echoed those of the 1975 study.  Given official reluctance to report
anything positive related to smoking, it is likely that the 1985 study
has similarly been ignored.

PERSPECTIVES

To better understand what pipe and cigar smokers face in the war on
tobacco, we need to not only examine the official handling of data,
but also have an overview on the medical literature itself.  First, it
should be stated that the medical studies dealing in a substantive
manner with pipe and cigar smoking are few in number compared to those
on cigarette smoking.  And many of the studies which do examine the
health effects of pipes and cigars contain serious flaws.

A major oversight common to many pipe and cigar studies is failure on
the part of researchers to take some important variables into account.
One such variable, for example, is the effect of differing amounts of
tobacco consumption.  Another is whether or not the study subjects
practice inhaled smoking.  This variable is quite significant since
there are a fair number of pipe and cigar smokers who inhale their
smoke, primarily among former or concurrent cigarette smokers.

There is yet another factor to consider in examining the medical
literature on pipes and cigars: How large the studies are in terms of
the number of subjects.  One problem with research done since the '70s
is that pipe and cigar studies typically have been done with small
numbers of subjects.  In fact, over the last 10 years or so some
researchers have commented that the low percentage of pipe and cigar
smokers among the overall population puts limitations on the number of
subjects available, and may therefore affect the validity of the
conclusions reached in their studies.

Although scientific research is a complex field, we can still
critically examine it if we know what to look for.  With this
knowledge a review of the existing medical data on the health effects
of pipe and cigar smoking provides ample reason for being skeptical of
the position that all forms of tobacco use are dangerous.
Unfortunately we cannot count on any objectivity from official
sources.  Our situation is further complicated by the media's
partisanship in dealing with smoking-related issues.  It is therefore
crucial for us to remain skeptical, and examine things for ourselves.

SETTING AGENDAS

In the thirty years following the first Surgeon General's report on
smoking and health, tobacco has come under increasing attack as a
major threat to the public.  Under the leadership of C. Everett Koop
in the 1980s a vigorous anti-tobacco agenda became official Government
policy.  There is solid evidence to suggest that Koop bolstered his
advocacy by altering the facts to fit his view of tobacco as being
universally evil.  Some of that evidence was cited earlier in this
article, and we can only wonder if there has been other misreporting
of data, and more suppressed information since 1983.

We must also question whether or not we can truly count on the
objectivity of health research, especially that which is
government-sponsored.  The annual budget of the National Institutes of
Health is larger than that for our national defense.  Much of the
health research in this country is, and has been done under the
auspices of the NIH.  Can we really believe that our government hasn't
interfered with the integrity of the research process?  One thing is
certain - since Koop's tenure, pipe and cigar smokers have a right to
question whether any positive information about their pastime will be
fairly reported and disseminated.  Given the militant anti-tobacco
stance of the present administration, it doesn't seem likely.

Pipe and cigar smokers are in an unfortunate situation, being a small
group and therefore an easy target.  We do, however have something
going for us: We have a factual basis for challenging the campaign
being waged against us.  And we have enough in our favor to continue
enjoying our pastime without guilt or fear.  The best we can do now is
to remember that, be informed, and do what we can to tear down the
official smokescreen.

    I'm 32 and am an assistant professor at the Monterey Institute of

    now and then (mostly in secret) since about age 16, although I was
    'exposed' in my first year of grad. school and have been a little
    more at ease since then. The gentle aroma of cavendish has always
    had a special appeal, and when my college roommate discovered my
    affinity, he confessed to owning several well-used briars himself.
    To my surprise, when a few of my friends saw me smoking my
    occasional pipe, they didn't mind at all -- in fact, most enjoyed
    the aroma quite a lot.

    I own maybe 8 pipes, only 2 or 3 of which I smoke. I've learned
    that there IS a price difference that can mean an enormous
    difference in quality. Right now, I'm searching for a Canadian in
    the $50 range, a price I'm pretty comfortable with. My last $45
    purchase was a terrific deal -- a standard bent pipe of Italian
    origin with a smooth dark grain and a narrow gold band. In
    general, I prefer straight stems, hence my preference for the
    Canadian.

    As for tobaccos, I generally stick with aromatics and cavendishes.
    I've tried English varieties, but find I have to be in a special
    mood to enjoy them. Non-smokers generally like the aromatics, too.
    I stay away from tobaccos available in retail stores, although
    I've been known to buy a pouch of Amphora once in a while. The
    problem with buying from tobacconists is that, once I finally find
    a blend I like, I have to return to the same store for more. I
    haven't had much luck duplicating my favorites elsewhere.

    Can anyone out there recommend tobacconists on or near the
    Monterey Peninsula? And what about tobacco-friendly organizations
    and/or establishments? Pickings seem to be rather slim around
    here, although cigar smoking appears to be on the increase. I
    haven't smoked more than a cigar or two in my life, but I'm
    thinking about trying. Any suggestions for a smallish, mild cigar
    that an occasional pipesmoker might like?

    I especially appreciate the amicable tone of all of the posts, as
    well as the moderate and informative views expressed. Looking
    forward to finding out more and to participating in these friendly
    exchanges.

October 10, 1994.  
?????@???.???.???

Last week I was visiting my tobacconist, laying in a supply of Cope's
Escudo, and noticed an attractively shaped bulldog pipe with a
quarter-bent stem in the moderately priced section of his display. A day
or two later I returned to see if it was there flaunting itself yet, it
was. Even with a couple of pits filled with putty and an exposed pit at
the top of the stem where it merged with the bowl, I couldn't resist its
charm; having seasoned it during the last day or two, I smoked a bowl-full
of Escudo tonight under clear skies in still air where the smoke went
straight up to the Gods in Heaven.  Anyone in the Company that fancies
changing pace should consider the possibilities of Cope's Escudo Navy De
Luxe. It's heavenly stuff of delicate bouquet. Escudo is "free from all
scent or added flavours." Pure tobacco, a blend of Virginia and Perique,
packed in tins as slices that must be rubbed out in the palms of your
hands, something I like to spend a few minutes doing to a couple of slices
while sitting at my desk. After rubbing out the tobacco, consistency runs
from fine to course. Course shreds I use as the dottles, filling the bowl
with the finer stuff so that the last pinch is of the finest rub. In this
way the tobacco burns quickly at the start with the rate of combustion
slowing as the fill is smoked downwards.  Sitting downwind of the pipe,
which is difficult in still air, I like to draw on it very slowly and then
puff out a cloud of smoke that then envelopes my head, allowing me to
inhale its delicate aroma. Like the deployment of napalm, I find the cloud
of smoke needs a moment or two to develop to best advantage of the aroma.
Don't be shocked at the price Escudo retails at $10.50 per 50g tin.

Tins, jars, or loose? This was one question in Pipes Digest #161.  Tobacco
will keep best in vacuum-packed tins. Bob Hamlin of the Pipe Collector's
Club of America told me that he recently opened a twenty-year old tin of
Balkan Sobranie and found the contents in perfect condition. Flake or
sliced tobacco will keep better than the shredded. Also with flakes you
can, to a certain extent, control the rate of combustion by how far you
rub it out. In any case, empty tobacco tins are good used as containers
for small objects.

In Pipe Digest #161, I quoted a verse from Carl Weber's book that he
attributed to James Thomson. Reaching down Alfred Dunhill's "The Pipe
Book," I noticed the same verse on the dust jacket this time attributed to
Alfred Dunhill, 1924. One of these chaps is a plagiarist, which one?

How is perique tobacco altered in the time between when it is picked and
when it is smoked? As a pipe smoker I am given to random musing and
speculation, unable to quote detailed chemical reactions, but I can offer
some plausible comparisons between similar processes.  Perhaps I'm
incorrect, but I don't believe perique has yeast added during processing,
which is why I wanted to avoid the word ferment and saw instead tobacco
leaves infected much as a cut finger might become infected and fester if
left to become septic. More appropriate analogy would be that between the
maturation of perique tobacco and the lambic beers of Belgium, such as
Guewze, Krick, Framboise, and Faro. One distinguishing feature of lambic
is that the wort is left in an open cooling vessel for one night under a
roof slatted to the open air so that wild micro-flora can infect the wort,
causing spontaneous fermentation. Micro-flora will get at the juices of
perique to alter its characteristics. Between the time when tobacco leaves
are picked and when smoked the difference is as the difference in taste
between unfermented wort and the finished beer.

We are moving away from our favourite subject of pipes and cigars, but we
can crave Steve's indulgence and press onward, regardless.  Lager yeasts
are bottom fermenting, operating best, slowly, at low temperature. Ale
yeasts, on the other hand, are top fermenting and prefer temperatures in
the range seventy to seventy-five degrees Fahrenheit. Dave Line in his
book "Brewing Beers Like Those You Buy" has a recipe for stout in which he
recommends using the yeast thrown by a bottle of Guinness as a starter for
a yeast culture, but this is not possible this far from Dublin because
what we get here is filtered and pasteurised to ensure that it arrives in
a known condition. Ale yeast is usually used for stout, warm-fermented to
give a stout of excellent body and fine-beaded, creamy head, a mouthful
needing two or three swallows to get down. In Mallow, Southern Ireland, I
discovered the true purpose of stout: stout is for washing down Sunday's
lunch of brown Windsor soup, lamb cutlets, roast potatoes, carrots, peas,
and baked potatoes, followed by chocolate gateau, and the cheese and
fruits. Drat! I've just drooled into the keyboard.

Oh well! We'll take another paragraph for a tea-related anecdote.  Steve's
sojourning in Erlangen and may be too busy to notice. Once upon a time I
used to sit in a bunker at a place called Laarbruch, somewhere in Germany.
It was there I took part in war-games bored out of my skull, reduced to
reading military manuals. One of these concerned the lifestyle of the
Soviet enlisted man. Apparently it was a custom to save in a can the tea
leaves from successive brews.  To these leaves was added a small quantity
of water each day. After a week or two left to the spontaneity of the open
air these tea leaves underwent a fermentation of sorts. In the end the
liquor from this was consumed, producing intoxication in the drinker.

Let's return to pipes and cigars. I agree that Oklahoma in summer is not
conducive to relaxed pipe smoking, the heat and humidity are too
oppressive, but fall, winter, and spring are entirely different seasons,
fine smoking weather.

"The Sea and the Jungle" by H. M. Tomlinson, 'being the narrative of the
voyage of the tramp steamer Capella from Swansea to Santa Maria de Belem
do Grao Para in the Brazils, and thence 2,000 miles along the forests of
the Amazon and Madeira Rivers to the San Antonio Falls; afterwards
returning to Barbados for orders, and going by way of Jamaica to Tampa in
Florida, where she loaded for home; done in the years 1909 and 1910,' can
be had through Inter-library Loan or from a used book-seller. It is an
exciting read. Tomlinson beset by mosquitoes was reduced to smoking his
pipe through mosquito netting, but gave up because the tropical heat made
his pipe taste sour and the mosquitoes learned to stick him through the
net whenever he took a puff at his pipe. Here is a sample. 
	"This common meeting place of ours, the Chief's cabin, is on a highway
of the ship, being on the direct route from the poop to the bridge, and so it is
a
hostel, for the Chief is a kindly and popular man, big and robust in body
and mind; though he has a knack, at odd and unexpected times, of being
candid in a way that shocks, treading on corns without ruth, the Skipper's
particularly, when their two departments are at a difference.
	"This cabin was one which I always visited first, for, especially in the
morning when other folk had not rubbed the night out of their eyes, and so
looked
darkly upon their fellows, my friend the Chief had the early eye of a
child and the soaring spirit of the lark. I never met him when he had got
out of bed on the wrong side.  His cabin became a refuge to me, for,
unlike the Doctor's and my own place (we both birds of passage, therefore
our cabins were cold and stark), the Chief's was comfortable with settled
furniture, cosy and habitable, like a fixed home. There was a wicker
chair, with cushions, and a writing-desk where the engineer's log lay
handy and bearing some plug tobacco freshly cut on its cover, and a pipe
rack above the desk carrying a most foul assortment waiting their turns
again for favour. Portraits of the Chief's family were on the walls,
smiling boys and girls with their mother in a chief place, looking upon
daddy by proxy. There was a book-shelf bearing some engineering manuals, a
few novels and magazines, a tape measure, some gauge glasses, some tin
whistles, a flute, and a palm leaf fan. Above the wash-stand was a rack
with glasses and a carafe. A settee ran along one side, and his bunk upon
the other. There we sat on Christmas Eve, while the wicker chair bent and
complained with the Skipper's weight as he swayed to the leisurely rocking
of the ship. The tobacco smoke floated in coils and blue smears in the
room. A bottle of Hollands rested for security on the bed, and we held our
glasses on our knees." 
	Stuck in my mind did this description, and made me
want to reach for my pipe. My copy of this book is dated "Xmas 1930. Lena,
from J.F." published by Duckworth. A book difficult to find but worth the
effort. Often it is the hunt that is enjoyed as much as the reading.

I've bored-on long enough. Next time I'll have another shot at talking
about the pipe writings of Georges Herment.

Hi! My name is Christopher D. Walborn. I am a 20 year old student
(self-taught thus far... ambitions of Oxford) of medieval literature and a
pipe smoker of a year and a half. Though I have been smoking for a year and a
half, I smoke very infrequently. I still live at home in a family of adamant
non-smokers (smoking is a sin... so is drinking beer... but wine is okay...
make sense? I didn't think so.). In fact, for this year and a half I have
been able to keep my pleasure a hidden one, but it has not been easy.

I was lucky enough (or foolish, depending on your view) to go straight for
the jugular and buy a good pipe right off the bat. I now have three pipes: my
original pipe for which I paid $65 and smokes excellently, but is quite
bulky; my second pipe which is of equal monetary value but gives a very hot,
sharp smoke and is a chronic quitter; and my newest pipe a $28 long stemmed
pipe which I am quickly comming to love--it doesn't smoke as nicely as the
first one, but there is something about it...

I cannot tell you names or styles; I am too ignorant about pipes. The second
and last have bowls of single wood; the first has a light with dark grained
exterior and an interior of a different, darker and more solid shade.

I have not found a favorite tobacco yet. I have found a most despised
tobacco; you guessed it... cherry (Birmingham). At this point I am picking
out a new tobacco each time I visit my pipe store: Sir Richards, McGregor
Blvd, Fort Myers FL (for the season calling itself "Santa's Pipe
Shop"--Christmas already???).

I have basically no knowledge about tobacco or pipes. I know enough to clean
my pipe, fill it (touch of a child, touch of a lady, touch of a man), and
smoke it, usually without scorching myself too badly.

I, too, am among the brotherhood of bearded smokers. No goateed
twenty-something here: a nice, full, red manly-man beard against brown hair.
I like to sit and smoke and think intelligent thoughts.

I cannot explain why I smoke, or what it is about it that pleases me so. I
guess it is the entire experience. It is something planned, not a matter of
impulse. It is a ritual and is a link to the romantic view of life, though
incessant relighting has its way of dashing the romantic into bitty pieces.
What made me want to start? I don't know that either. Regardless of my
pure-air family upbringing I have always, from the time I was a small child,
loved pipes. I knew nobody that smoked a pipe, but an older gentleman smoking
a pipe has always seemed a type of the wonderously warm and kindly. In this
day and age, particularly, we need that to offset all the negative
cynicalism, a lot of which I share, but never while smoking.

I don't smoke for a buzz; furthest thing from it. I don't like the buzz on
the remote occasions when I get it. I don't smoke so much for the taste--I'm
not sure I've really learned to smoke it correctly for that. Perhaps I'm
smoking it as an active symbol of what I want to become: the kind, peaceful
old man.

Enough romanticized psycho-drivel.

One last thing before I end this bit. In one of the pipe shops I have been
in, the proprietor had posted what claimed to be the findings of the Surgeon
General: statistics on the life span of pipe smokers in contrast to
non-smokers. It stated that those who smoke between 3 and 10 bowls per day,
inhaling, for a duration of 30 years were not shown to live substantially, if
any, shorter lives than cigarette smokers. Those who smoked between 3 and 10
bowls per day for a duration of 30 years without inhaling were shown to live
as long and longer than non-smokers.

Has anyone else seen this? Is it real? Also, my paranoid side would like to
know the stats on mouth cancer. I'd prefer to keep my lips and tongue. How
much of a risk is involved? If I continue to smoke as I do (once a week) I
seriously doubt I will face any ungainly consequences. But when I
finally--hopefully shortly--move out I will most likely increase my smoking.
How much is too much?

Well, there's my introduction. It's nice to find fellow-pipers. (It seems as
if lately I am seeing less and less cigarette smokers and more and more pipe
smokers. Has anyone else noticed this?)

Thanks for the Pipes Digest, it looks GREAT! I have been smoking
pipes off and on for about 20 years (boy does that make me feel old).
I started in college and have been hooked ever since. For the most
part I smoke briars, however within the past five years I have added
a few CAO meershaums (spelling?) to my collection. I find them to be
a cooler smoke and I enjoy seeing them change color as you smoke them.
I smoke mostly aromatics. I have not tried any English tobaccos, due
mostly to lack of knowledge about them. The few places that sell
pipes and tobacco near me, tend not to employ people that are knowledgeable
about this most enjoyable of pasttimes.

FYI your resource list does not include a pipe maker named Elliot
Nachwachter (not sure about the spelling of that last name). He operated
a store in NYC called Pipeworks of Wilke. He recently closed this shop
and returned to his native Vermont. I do not have an address yet but
he is sending me a catalog, so I will post it later. Elliot takes
great pride in the carving of his pipes, I own three of them. I think
others would share my appreciation for his work.

Thanks again. I look forward to reading future issues. I intend to
review back issues of Pipes Digest. I am glad I found this group.
Steve, how long has this group been around, the Pipes Digest?

Until later.. Cool smoking!

+ Subject: An introduction.
+ ...
+      Rambling on ... I have yet to hitch up my Jansport and walk
+ 20 miles into nowhere and smoke my favorite English blend in
+ front of a blazing fire.  Camping and puffing seem to have some
+ mystical link that I am eager to discover.  Any accomplished
+ hikers with a suggested blend?  ...

I backpack regularly and take a pipe with me on all outings.
Since I enjoy both aromatic and English blends, I bring a pouch
of each. On my last outing I took 2 oz of Dunhill Standard and
2 oz of a rich, black aromatic. Were I to go on a trip tomorrow,
it would be 2 oz each of burley and Dunhill 965.

I take one of two pipes a trip. One is a light-weight,
inexpensive straight,  and the other is a 3/4 curve Peterson.
The Peterson is a little heavier, so on long trips I might use
the lighter pipe (every little bit helps). But both are
small-ish pipes that fit well into my pack.

My pipes have accompanied me from the granitic splendor of
Yosemite (the top of Half Dome) to the alpine meadows of the
Trinity Alps (Calf.) There's nothing like taking a few puffs
when you reach the summit of a climb. On my last trip to the
Southern Sierras, we hiked to the top of a granite dome (elev.
9400 feet) and stretched out to enjoy the view and a few puffs
of aromatic. (Of course, one should always be careful with drugs
outdoors and especially at elevation.)

At night, I've tried to use a pipe to keep the mosquitos at bay,
but with limited success. They certainly don't like it when you
blow smoke at them, but merely smoking isn't enough to ward them
off completely.

I've taken cigars on some trips, but quite frankly I enjoy the
pipe more. It's more convenient to carry a pouch of tobacco than
a crush-proof cigar container, plus cigars can drop ash and
embers that burn holes in a synthetic jacket and sleeping bag.

Have been having a heck of a time finding corncob pipes in my area.
Finally found the solution... Missouri Meerschaum Co will send you
a catalog and will sell to individuals.  Write and ask 'em for the
catalog if you too are having problems finding cob pipes. Their
address: PO Box 226, Washington, MO 63090-0226 or phone
314/239-2109.  Even tho they say it takes 2-4 wks for delivery, I've
gotten mine back in a week.

A tip for sore mouth... alternate pipes (even corncobs) between bowl
fulls.  (I keep at least 3 in my pocket at a time)...  And try 
different tobacco.  The one I like best (becasue I can smoke it
constantly without bite) is Sir Walter Raleigh's Aromatic blend. Comes
in a dark blue pouch or container. Is a bit hard to find, only Eckerd
drugs locally carry it...

And for the guy who puts live pipes in his pockets: That smell you

Hello fellow pipe smokers.

I am in great need.  I am searching high and low for a very SWEET TASTING 
and aromatic pipe tobacco.  Any suggestions?  Any input/sources is 
greatly appreciated!  Mail order is fine.  I like MacBaren's Navy flake, 
but want something much better.  

Any ideas?

Steve,

  I've always enjoyed the civil nature of the "lightly moderated" pipes
digest. Do you in fact ever get flame-mail? If so, I'd like to suggest a
new tradition: Save all those letters up, and publish them in a special
April-Fools edition of the digest, with the understanding that not
another word be said about them...
  Different subject: Humidification systems. I took one member's advice
about building a humidification system out of Oasis florist's foam, and
would like to report some success. I've been using these homemade
devices for a few months now, and they really yield very good results:
moist (but not wet) cigars, slow evaporation, neat construction. The one
problem is that the surface of the foam in one of the units developed
some mold. Nothing that harmed the cigars, but something I'd like to
fix. I set out searching for a odorless, water soluable mold inhibitor.
After calling several food additive companies and talking with their
scientists, it seems that potasium sorbate, 1 part per 1000 is the ideal
choice. It requires a pH of &lt;6.5, so a bit of citric acid added to the
mix would be necessary. People in this group have suggested adding
propylene glycol (sp?) or glyceryn to the water to slow evaporation.
Could this be the secret recharging solution sold by Credo for $35?
Perhaps a chemist in the group could run some tests.

Being relatively new to pipe smoking (and being a closet smoker on top of
that), I know very little about pipes or the smoking thereof. It would be a
tremendous help to me if someone (some exceedingly kind person) would drop me
a line or post to the Digest a beginners guide to pipes: types and brands and
how they affect the smoke; tobaccos: types, brands, and the different basic
smokes they provide; techniques: filling, keeping it lit, keeping it cool;
and any accessories you feel are essential.

This would be a great help to me. I, nor my tobacconist, I'm sure, have the
time for me to stand around his shop asking him endless questions. Nor am I
able to find literature around grand ole Fort Myers. The only thing I've
found at my library are an infinite amount of books to help people quit
smoking. That isn't quite what I had in mind.

The "Pipes, Cigars and Public Policy" article was excellent! Just what I was
looking forward. Thanks much for that.

<a name="8">Subject: Virginia/N. Carolina Tours</a>

A few months ago I asked Digest members what there was to see in the
way of tobacco farms/factories back in the South East.  I didn't get
many replies but have just returned and can share a few observations.
Virginia and North Carolina are still big tobacco country.  Just off
many of the main roads were fields filled with the plants.  I found
out that tobacco basically likes a sandy soil, not rich in elements
except Niacin.  This made it a good commercial crop for the South that
in general had poor soil.  There are still many small family farms
today where they pick the tobacco when the leaves are a dull
yellow-gold, and then tie them together in "hands" (about a dozen
leaves hanging down bound and wrapped by one at the top).  The hands
are laid over stic ks and hung in old curing sheds, many made well
over 50 years ago.  Temperature for curing is done the old fashioned
way by feeding an external hearth with wood and having an opening on
the other side into the shed where the heat can escape.  I was told
that you want a slow, low heat for the first week or so, maybe 180
degrees F, then a hotter heat at the very end.  This is done by
throwing the smoldering coals directly under the tobacco leaves for
the "finish."

(As a clarification, all this tobacco is to be sold for cigarette
production, not cigars, which I prefer.)  The tobacco is hauled after
curing to tobacco co-ops where its bundled and then sold (through a
historic auction system - (going back to the colonial days)) to the
big factories for them to make into the cigs.  The most interesting
place I visited was The Duke Homestead (no admission charge!) near
Durham, North Carolina.  He was the original Tobacco "Robber Baron"
and monopolist who later created The American Tobacco company which
was later (I think 1920's) broken up (by legal anti-monopolists
including Attorney General) into many of the "smaller" cigarette
companies we know today.  Man did this guy make money though!  Was
told that tobacco money basically helped to "fuel" the entire
Confederate army during the Civil War and he later made enough money
to give away $40 Million dollars (that was a lot back then!) to start
Duke University.  All in all, interesting, though I never did find any
small local pipe/cigar tobacco growers/makers evidently for cigars
it's almost all imported tobacco or some is grown in Kentucky (Burley)
with the wrappers from the Conn.  Valley.  Last point... we can listen
to people talk all day about the health virtues and non-virtues of
tobacco, particularly here in California, without the realization
that, in the South, this tobacco growing is a way of life for
thousands of people who are the sons, daughters and great grand kids
of people who were/are basically just farmers trying to make a life
for themselves in America.  (I'm not talking about the guy at the top,
like Duke, rather all the little people that depend on its cultivation
for their livelihoods.)

Steve, 

I've only been on the internet for a few weeks.  I really
appreciate the digest.  It lets me know I'm not the only "tail
end baby boomer" smoking a pipe.

I've only been smoking a pipe since my 30th birthday in September
of this year. I figured I should do something with my birthday money
that I wouldn't usually do.  My Uncle and Grandfather used to smoke
pipes and I really missed that smell.

Now I'm hooked on it.  I smoke 2-3 times a day and love every
minute of it.  

I'm a Mortgage Loan Officer in the Southeastern Pennsylvania area. 
I'm usually driving during the day from Realtor's office to
Realtor's office.

I purchased a straight briar for my first pipe.  It smokes fine. 
Then, I thought that one could use a brake and I decided to be
cheap and purchase a corn-cob (yecht).  I really don't enjoy the
corn cob at all.  So, I just invested a small amount into a
"seconds" briar with a slightly bent neck.

I still haven't been able to smoke a whole bowl while holdind the
pipe between my teeth.  Maybe I'm not clenching it correctly???

Anyway,  I read a fine book re: Herbert Lane called "Leaves from a
Tabbaconist's Logs".  It was a very interesting book.  It gives a
brief history of Pipes and Smoking.  Then it details Mr. Lane's
production methods and finally it deals with the fine art of
smoking.  It dates to 1970 so I don't know just how much of Mr Lanes
"fussy" production methods are still in practice, however, I have
requested my tabbaconist to point out the Lane blends and I have been
very happy with them. 

I'm always looking forward to the next digest.  I would love to
hear more about the other members who are in their 20s and 30s that
may have felt like the only ones their age smoking a pipe.

Enough for now, I must go outside to have a bowl and a breath of
fresh night air.

Your's Truly,
John A. Klimowicz

Dear Paul -

I've known about your pipe group for some time, but never got around to
contacting you before now.  I'm a dedicated pipe smoker, been at it for about
16 yrs.  Being a foe of the antis I've decided we need to fight 'em on their
own ground.  To this end I've done my own investigation into the medical
literature on pipes &amp; cigars.  Wrote an article on the subject for the A &amp; M
Gazette.  If you get the Gazette you know my work, otherwise this'll be new
to you.  I've already uploaded to Masticola's group, and since we need to get
this info out there I wanted to pass it along to you as well.  Since AOL
won't let me attach files to folks on the Net, I have to do it as another
e-mail.  I'll be sending it to you right after I send this.  Since my
investigation will be ongoing I'll be checking in from time to time with new
stuff whenever I get it.  Hope you guys will find this info useful!

Also - we're having a pipe &amp; cigar Expo here in Los Angeles at the end of the
month.  Here are the details:

                   October 29 &amp; 30
                   LAX Marriott Hotel
                   5855 W. Century Blvd.
                   Los Angeles, CA

Admission is $3 (one-day OR weekend pass), parking is $5 (special Expo rate -
a bargain for hotel parking!).  Anyone wanting more info can call me at
(310)820-9706, or e-mail their snail-mail address and I'll send 'em a flyer.
 I know this is last-minute notice, but I hope you can let your group know
about this event.  If you have members in So. California mebbe they 
can come.  It's gonna be a GREAT show!

Thanks, Paul!

<a name="11">Subject: letter for the pipes digest</a>

Steve -

Just got the news digest and was glad to see that my article made it
in o.k.  Now that I'm getting some information out there on the Net I
feel like a member of the Resistance!  Great feeling, too! I'm looking
forward to doing it again.  BTW - I should mention that I'll welcome
medical research on pipes &amp; cigars from anyone who has something of
interest.  My only requirement is that the study must be in its
originally published form, not rehashed in someone else's work (tends
to eliminate any creative "reinterpretations" of the raw data).  If
someone has an item for me, they can snail-mail it to me at:
 1532 S. Bundy Dr., Apt. D, Los Angeles, CA  90025.

This is a follow-up to Christopher Walborn's question on pipes, cigars
and oral cancers.  The data on this is somewhat inconsistent.  The
literature indicates some increased risk of oral cancer from pipe and
cigar smoking, although most report the increase to be minor.  There
are, however a few things to consider.  Firstly, oral cancer is pretty
low on the list of cancers in terms of general incidence.  In my
opinion this makes it something not worth worrying much about.
Secondly, we have to look at when the cancer studies were done.  Prior
to the early '60s tobacco tended to be harsher than it is today.  In
the late '50s tobacco manufacturers started making mildness an
important result of their processing methods.  Since the formation of
oral cancer is linked to irritation, it would stand to reason that the
incidence of such cancers due to pipe and cigar smoking would be lower
with milder products (the amount you smoke would also factor into it).

The studies I've seen have data which I think may be misleading in
terms of risk assessment, due to the fact that the tobaccos of the
time were more irritating, and thus were more likely to induce cancer.
I haven't had time to research the literature more, so I don't know
what more recent data has revealed.  Given the politicization of
science in tobacco studies (see my article in the last Digest),
however, I would look at any recent cancer studies very skeptically.
At this point I would look at the cancer risk issue in the larger
perspective of the overall health picture.  Since pipe and cigar
smokers tend to live as long as nonsmokers (and evidence suggests that
pipe smokers may even outlive nonsmokers), then the increased risk of
oral cancer must be offset by some benefits (such as a reduction in
stress-related diseases).  Bottom line is that if you keep your pipes
clean, smoke tobaccos that don't burn out your mouth, and smoke in
moderation, then I strongly believe that you should just relax and
enjoy the experience.  And speaking of moderation...

There has been only one study (at least that I know of) that broke
down cancer incidence by quantities consumed.  The study was done in
the early '50s, with data compiled in the '40s.  I had to do some
extrapolation of the numbers since the study broke down daily
consumption into 1/2-ounce increments (for example the lowest level
considered was anything from 0 to 1/2 per day, with nothing in
between) , but what I came up with was 1/4 ounce per day as a moderate
amount.  In Dunhill pipe terms that would translate into 3 - 4 bowls
per day in a Group 4, depending on the blend.  This is a very rough
estimate, but I think it's reasonable.  Also, the sensitivity of one's
mouth should be a guide.  If one pipe a day is fine, but 3 or 4
significantly irritates your mouth and/or tongue, then you know what's
moderate for you.

Anyway, I've blathered on long enough.  Hope this information is useful!

What a kick!  The FAQ reformat looks great!  I gotta tell you, that was a

Oh.  One more thing--and perhaps you can recommend a suggestion about

embedded ASCII page break command.  It was the only part of the FAQ I 
formatted to start each new section at the top of the next page.  Should 
I assume that since high ASCII causes promblems, so does the page feed 
command?  

Thanks again for the reformat effort!  I certainly taken some of the load

Someone mentioned in a recent Digest about Blatter and Blatter in

address.  They are at 365 President Kennedy Ave, Montreal, QC, H3A 1J5, 
tel: (514) 845-8028.

They sell pipes and make some of their own and also sell a fairly good 
range of tobacco, although they are better in the area of English tobacco 
than for aromatics (suits me fine  :)  )  They have blends (in bulk) such as 
Highland Targe (one of my favourites), Black Mallory, Accountant, Red 
Rapparee...  They provide service in both English and French.

I just picked up a Peterson second there the other day, (CAN$40
instead of $80) my first "haut de gamme" pipe and I can really see the
difference.  It smokes really well and coolly.  On the other hand, the
bowl is a bit heavy for my liking but I think I can live with that
inconvenience :)

Hoping this would be of use to someone, (oh yeah, they also sell cigars)

Enjoy,

the extremely high-priced pipes that many of you own, so this purchase
is especially dear to me.  I smoked it briefly to begin the breaking

cheap pipes I have.  This is the second "quality" pipe I now own, so
the good-bad rotation is slowly getting better.

Hi Steve

Fist of all I would like to thank you for adding me to your list and 
doing  such a fine job with the digest.
You will have to excuse me for any errors as I am a new user but a long 
time pipe smoker. You might be interested to know that I received the 
info. on your digest from a book I recently purchased called "Navigating 
the Internet"
Well back to the bio., I am 40 years old and starting smoking the pipe 
when I was 19 years old. I started like we seem all to do with the drug 
store pipe and on the amphora.  I  gave up after about 3 years went on 
cig. and kind of kicked my butt that I ever left the pipe.
Approximately 10 years ago I went back on the pipe and enjoy it to the 
upmost. I live in Canada's smallest province Prince Edward Island 
population of about 150 thousand so finding a good tobacco shop has not 
been  easy. I have approximately 10 pipes in my collection all which are 
a Canadian made except one. The Canadian made pipes are called Brigham 
and made by a company in Toronto.  They range in price from about $50.00 
up and give an excellent smoke. One thing unique to these pipes is that 
the filter is removeable and made out of maplewood which traps alot of 
the moisture. I have no connection with this company but if anone would 
like info. just e-mail me and I will give you details. They do mail order 
and repairs , and have a fine brocheur. The other pipe I own is a 
Peterson that I picked up JR's in N.C. on a trip to Florida. As far as 
the Brigham pipes goes I highly suggest them and with the difference in 
the American dollar could be a real buy for you.
On the lines of tobacco I have just about tried all the drug store type 
such as Sail,Amphora, my latest Borkum Riff Whiskey and such.
On a holiday a few years back I found a tobacco shop in Orlando,Florida 
called the "Smoke&amp; Snuff" located in the Florida Mall. Once in the shop 
my wife knew that I was good for the afternoon left me to finish her 
shopping. I found a nice blend that I like very much called "Ten Blend".
They have several differnt types to suit anyone. Joe the manager tells me 
that they ship all over North America and beyond.  The price is actually 
very good approx.$20.00 for a pound and with their tobacco club every 5th 
pound is free. They have shops located all over Florida so if any one 
would like more info. just e-mail me; and yes they have a find collection 
of cigars and a cigar club as well.
One time I bought a fair amont of pipe materials from a shop in 
Bangor,Maine called The Tinder Box which has since closed, I would I to 
know if anyone knows if there is one in the northeast?
I have a couple of pet peeves maybe someone might have the same thought
1. ash trays in car so small hard to use for your pipe, I drive a 93 
Honda Accord.
2.  When your in a restaurant in a smoking section having a fine meal and 
other guests start making comments.
Do we have many members from Canada?
Well Steve I thank you again for the opportunity to join your group and 
keep up the fine work.  Keep the bowls up and full.

<a name="22">Subject: Letter from Camp</a>

This past Saturday, I went to my first session of "Bloom's Cigar
Camp", at Bloom's Cigar Shop in Pittsburgh's south side. If you're in
Pittsburgh, or may be in Pittsburgh for a Saturday, I highly recommend
this experience.

I had heard about this tradition at Bloom's called "Caigar Camp". On
Saturdays, patrons buy a few cigars, sit down on the couches and
chairs and begin smoking. At some point in the past, the proprietors
began serving complimentary food and making drinks available. A
purchase of at least ten dollars in cigars is required if you want to
eat the food. Some of the regulars also brought food of their own to
leave out. I'd like to thank whoever brought that wonderful soup.

The guy running the store when we came in (Mark, I believe) was very
helpful. I'd mentioned this trip to a few of my friends, and we were a
group of five, only myself having the vaguest idea of what I wanted to
smoke. He helped each of us pick out our cigars, even helping one of
my friends find a cheap cigar so he would be able compare.

The regulars all seemed to be very good friends, and spent most of the
afternoon insulting each other. Early on, it was mostly older guys,
and then later in the day the place began to fill up with goateed
twentysomethings like myself. Also, women started coming in. Some of
them were, uh, together, but this didn't seem to cause anybody any
problems. All were welcome.

I wound up smoking three cigars in about four and a half hours, the
most I've ever smoked in one sitting, but it just seemed so natural.
The atmosphere was very comfortable (if cloudy), and I didn't feel
much first-timer angst at all. I will go back.

Cigars I smoked: Something y Moneterrey, which mark recommended as his
favorite, since I wanted to try a dark wrapper; Zino, for it's light
wrapper and wonderful smell; The Griffins, as my major splurge, and
disappointment (perhaps it was just too light to be at the end).

<a name="23">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #162 -- October 13, 1994</a>

Steve:

I'm subscribed to the pipe digest through the Internet, but I thought
I'd sign on as a new member.

Since biographies seem to be in order, I'm a 34 year old Ph.D. candidate
at Carnegie Mellon, who is writing his dissertation in History on the
social effects of the Civil War.  In terms of smoking tobacco, I've been
happily smoking cigars and cigarettes since I was about 14 (goodness --
that was 20 years ago); however, last month, I finally abandoned
cigarettes for pipes, and I think I've made the right decision for
myself.  

I have nothing against cigarettes and the last thing I want to become is
an intolerant ex-smoker.  However, I had found that I was enjoying them
less and less, and started to smoke a pipe on something of a whim. 
Quickly, though, I found myself enjoying a bowl of tobacco more than a
pack of cigarettes -- I suspect, however, that this reaction isn't very
uncommon among members of the group.

In fact, I've found that my pipes (I'm up to five as of this writing)
are both aesthetically and olfactorily more pleasing than even my
beloved cigars, and  vis a vis your last posting on the discussion
group,  are actually more convenient, since I'm loath to relight a good
cigar.  One of my questions concerns the various kinds of pipe tobacco,
which I am something of a novice about -- is there a FAQ on this
subject, or am I condemned to keep trying new blends (noth that _that_
is such a bad thing)?  I'm quite enamored of the taste of tobacco and
not flavorings; if it's any help in guiding me, I like big maduro
Honduran cigars, as well.

I noticed last week that another correspondent was venturing into
Bloom's Cigar Camp, of which I am a pround frequenter.  Bloom's Cigars
is a store on 12th Street in the ever-more-trendy South Side of
Pittsburgh, and probably the best cigar store in the area.  (There are,
however, a couple of good competitors who also carry pipes).  Bloom's is
a _cigar_ store first and foremost, though I'm sure Marc Adams (the
proprietor) would be happy to sell you pipe tobacco, which he also
carries.  Actually, Marc would be happy to sell you almost anything that
wasn't nailed down.

For those of you who missed the article in _Cigar Aficianado_ a couple
of issues ago, Marc started Cigar Camp about five years ago.  On
Saturdays, he puts out a spread of bagels, cream cheese, etc., and
people sit around, drink coffee, read the paper and shoot the breeze. 
And, most importantly, smoke cigars in complete peace.  Occassionally, a
pipe smoker wanders in, but they're usually quickly converted.  The day
starts fairly quietly, but as the afternoon picks up (particularly on
Saturdays when there is a parade downtown, a football game at Pitt or a
street festival nearby) the atmosphere can become somewhat more
rambunctious, and the coffee and bagels can be traded for more potent
potables, as they say on Jeopardy. Camp is open from noon to eight pm.   

The best aspect of Cigar Camp is in its completely downscale attitude --
the place is furnished wit a bunch of cast-off couches and chairs, and
the decor is strictly Bedrock; it feels like a basement rec room, which
consequently eliminates the elite clubbiness that a lot of tobacco
stores affect.  As a result, the store is filled with cab drivers, cops,
frat boys and the occassional historian, as well as the local lawyers,
financiers, and bankers who are making a pit stop on the way to 18
holes. While there is a group of hard core campers, everyone is welcome,
including women; in particular, there is a group of women bikers who
descend occassionally (they normally prefer maduro Rothchilds).  Just
don't ever complain about the smoke.

If you're a particularly loyal customer, Marc will eventually take your
picture and mount in on the wall, which at last count had probably 300
happy cigar smokers enshrined.  I'm above the refrigerator, happily
lighting (I believe) a Flor de Caribe Presidente.  

I'd be happy to know about any other cigar camps, but this one is
probably as close to heaven as I'll get on this mortal coil.

Keep Smoking.     

[ I'd be happy to put any other Cigar Camps in the Guide, too! -S. ]

Smoke Signal #4
October 17, 1994
?????@???.???.???

Sending up these smoke signals is like keeping a pipe lit,
somewhat. How long can I go before needing a re-light. Worrying
about going out is not for the smoker of a pipe. Who cares if one
takes an occasional re-light? I've been pondering those research
statistics discussed in Pipes Digest #162; they show puffers of
pipes to be longer-lived than nonsmokers. Does this mean that the
secret of the life eternal can be found in the tobacco-filled bowl
of your favourite briar? Perhaps it is only the calm, collected
individuals that take to the pipe and derive added relaxation? I
have heard cigarette smokers say that the pipe is too much of a
bother to smoke, it is for the person addicted to life in the fast-
lane fuelled by three packs per day. We, the Honourable Company of
Pipe and Cigar Smokers, are the vanguard of life in the slow-lane.
Pipes and cigars are not wholly necessary to the quiet life but
they are a pleasurable enhancement to it, a nice adjunct of the
pause to admire the scenery, a fillip to that feeling of repose
that comes from watching the grass growing or the peregrination
of the snail upon the thorn. We in the Company respond to stress by
reaching into pockets for the pipe and baccy, or for the cigar-
case. By the time that pipe is loaded and lit or the churchillian
roll burning nicely, the stress has passed by the smoker, heading
in the direction of the rabid, nonsmoking, political correctionist,
where it belongs. My Dad faced most things with equanimity.

When we lived on the North side of Clapham Common, I was taken to
Arding and Hobbs' department store and there equipped with new
shoes. While being fixed-up with footware by the salesman and my
Mum, my Dad found himself standing in the middle of the shoe
department with nothing to do except watch the world pass by. I saw
him reach into his pocket, pull out his billard and stick it in his
mouth. Next, out came the tin of Gold Block, which he opened,
making that characteristic noise with the lid as he parked it on
the bottom of the tin. He filled his pipe, put the tin in his
pocket, pulled out his box of Swan Vestas and lit-up. Now, my Dad
had been in the army and learned not to drop dead matches on the
parade ground or barrack room floor. He did as usual, shook the
match to extinguish it and put it back in the box, and the box in
the right-hand pocket of his trousers. All was done automatically
whithout much attention on his part. He stood there in the middle
of the shoe department gazing off into the distance, left arm
folded across his chest with his left-hand resting in the crook of
his right-arm that held his pipe as he relished its fume. Note that
this took place in the fifties when sales staff were older and more
deferential to their customers than they are today. A salesman
stepped up to my Dad:

     "Excuse me Sir. . ."

     "Hmm! What?"

     "Excuse me Sir, but your pocket's on fire."

Receipt of this news rattled my Father and moved him into high
gear.

     "Good God! So it is," said he as he plunged his hand into his 
pocket, withdrawing the smoking box of matches.

     "This way Sir," said the salesman who opened the window
through which my Dad tossed the now flaming box.

     "Thank you."

     "Not at all, Sir."

I got my shoes and a laugh all at my Dad's expense.

Georges Herment was an army man, a man in the French army. "He was
born in Montauban in Southern France in 1912 and studied at the
universities of Toulouse and Paris. His great enthusiasm was jazz,
and after taking part in several programmes of the Hot Club of
France he became a professional musician, a career which was
interrupted by the outbreak of war in 1939.

"Herment served on the Eastern front and then on the Belgian
frontier, where, after thirty-five days of combat, he was taken
prisoner and sent to Pomerania. He escaped in June of 1941, crossed
all of Germany and was recaptured at the Italian frontier. Shipped
back to the Baltic, he again escaped in October of the same year,
made his way across Belgium and crossed the demarcation line
between Occupied France and Free France in November 1941. . . . In 
1950 Herment married an Englishwoman and settled in the Valley of
Aveyron. 'The Pipe' was written there. . . ."

Herment's book was published in the U. S. A. in 1955 by Simon and
Schuster, translated from the French by Arthur L. Hayward,
illustrated by George Pool and Paul Jensen. It is "a serious yet
diverting treatise on the history of the pipe and all its
appurtenances, as well as a factual withal philosophical discussion
of the pleasurable art of selecting pipes, smoking, and caring for
them." It is a book available to interested members of the Company
through Inter-Library Loan. The copy I borrowed was languishing in
Reader's Storage. Books like this must be requested from the
library to keep them in circulation and prevent them from ending
their days on the library's 25-cent sale-table.

Herment is a practical smoker who eschewed the folderol's of pipe
smoking, for him the pipe was an important means of enjoying the
tobacco herb, not an end in itself, as it is for the nonsmoking
collector of pipes. He refers to his selection of pipes as a
'battery' much as an officer of the artillery would refer to a
battery of guns. Pipe racks of fine wood were not for him when a
piece of suitably sawn board would serve the purpose, or a row of
screw eyes, or nails driven at an angle into the wall from which to
hang pipes by their bowls; even a shell-casing recycled from the
battlefield was enough for Herment.

His book, 'The Pipe', is divided into five parts and dedicated to
all "True Pipe Smokers." Here is the contents appearing at the
front of the book:

     Introduction
     Part One:      Broaching the Subject
                    Definitions, Diagrams, Explanations, Etc.
                    Points to be Observed

                    Wood Pipes
                    Other Materials
                    The Briar Root

     Part Two       Choice of Briar
                    Anti-Nicotine Contraptions
                    Choice of Tobacco

                    The Pouch
                    The Pipe Rack

     Part Three     Filling the Pipe
                    Lighting the Pipe
                    Combustion
                    Generalities
                    Emptying the Pipe
                    Cleaning
                    Seasoning
                    Other Matters
                    Scraping out the Bowl

     Part Four      The Pipe and Health

     Part Five      Some Last Questions
                    Conclusion.

It is a book readable and informative written in an elegant style.
His introduction is worth quoting in toto : "At the risk of
disappointing the reader on the very threshold of this book, we
feel it our duty to warn him that it has been written in the manner
of a poem, by a flash of happy inspiration.

"As may well be the case with a poem, twenty years of meditation
and brooding have scarcely been sufficient incubation to produce
these few pages. In the light of these observations it will be
easier to grasp what follows:

"Treated in a purely technical style, a subject such as ours could
not have failed to rebuff the simple amateur. On the other hand the
veteren or professional smoker would have considered it too
superficial to satisfy his requirements, not full enough to fulfill
his desires.

"Thanks to a complete and exhaustive knowledge of the subject,
after years of experience and research, we have been able to
conceive this work in its fullest scope and present it to the
reader just as the spirit came to us -- *Currente Calamo*.

"Such has been our aim. Have we attained it? The reader, be he
veteran or amateur, must be the judge."

'The Pipe' is a book, a manual for the practical smoker, especially
useful to the novice whereas Alfred Dunhill's 'The Pipe Book' is
geared more to the collector of pipes. Herment's book is in the
same class as that of Carl Weber, useful and eminently readable.

Dunhill's book contains some interesting reports of smoking in
divers parts of the world, a few of which I'll bring before the
Company in my next puff.

<a name="25">Subject: carving pipes</a>

Hi!
Browsing the excellent WWW-page I just found that pipe-carving has been the 
subject of only four articles so far (by searching on the keyword carving). 
Surely this subject merits more than so? I hereby offer my views and 
experiences, which I trust you to edit to a reasonable size for further 
distribution.

Over the years I have carved a few pipes: all in all maybe a dozen. Now I 
find that when choosing a pipe for the armchair I tend to favour these over 
the ones I have bought. This may of course be due to the pride of 
achievement, but I prefer to imagine that it is because of actual qualities 
of these pipes. 

What you get for the work besides the pride when you carve a pipe is the 
possibility to adapt the pipe to your own hand and habits. Thus I, who hold 
my pipes in my right hand, prefer my pipes to be slightly oval with the long 
axis of the oval angled roughly 45 degrees to the right of the length-axis 
of the pipe. (is this complete gibberish? a sketch would clarify things ). I 
haven't seen enough freehands to say if this is common, but I have never 
seen pipes designated as "right-hand" or "left-hand". I think this 
definately adds "kinesthetic" value (that was the word you used? Great word!). 

I also like to leave little taps and knobs and wings to make comfortable 
grips AND to make it possible to put the pipe down standing on a table. You 
have to do this now and then, and unless you put it in an ashtray and get 
your beautiful wood all soiled a roundbottomed bowl will turn aver and spill 
glow and ashes. Inconvenient! Well, there may be other solutions, but you 
must admit that little legs on a pipe are practical (maybe I can teach them 
to come when I whistle?).

And of course, I try to make the pipes look good. My abilites have improved 
with practice, and, as I am so far the sole judge of my accomplishments, now 
I am doing reasonably well. I have bought briar-blocks with the hole ready 
drilled, and a mouthpiece fitted, and used knives for the carving. I have 
never really tried styling the mouthpieces, only the wood. One advantage of 
the pre-drilled hole, besides saving the trouble of drilling it yourself, is 
that the grain is easier to see here than on the outside of the block. The 
block is probably cut out when the wood is fresh, so that the sides are 
coarse and dull, and doesen't really show the grain. There is, of course, 
every reason to be picky in this respect, as a lot of work goes into the 
project, and it is important to the result.

Why knives rather than files or motorized, and quicker, methods? Well, when 
was a pipe-smoker ever in a hurry? (well, okay, when he/she was out of 
tobacco, perhaps, but surely that is rare?). Handling a pipe at this stage 
is a pleasure almost parallelling the subsequent handling when the job is 
finished, so there is really no call for hurry. And working in wood with a 
knife (or an axe, for that matter, but they're a bit unwieldy for pipes) is 
a meditative process, creating much the same mood as pipe-smoking. 

The conclusion is, of course, that if you haven't tried yet, it's about time 
you did, and if you have, tell me what tools you prefer.

Jon B, Sweden.

<a name="29">Subject: A little intro...</a>

It's great to be in this newsgroup, and since reading all the back
digests 1-156, I'm looking forward to interesting conversations with all
of you fellow pipe smokers.
I'm a 27 year old Systems Engineer at the Davis-Besse nuclear station,
and I started smoking pipes since I was 15 in the company of fellow
historical re-enactors (I played a fife in a War of 1812 Infantry
company based at Fort Meigs, Ohio).  Everyone sat around the camp fires
smoking clay pipes, so it was only natural that I joined in.  A year
later, I found an old clay pipe bowl that was dug up from around the
fort, glued a piece of reed into it, and voila! a REALLY used pipe.  It
looked "authentic", anyways. From then on, I smoked "Scandinavik" and
"Captain Black" in English clay pipes and meerschaums off and on through
high school.  Years and years later, I got back into the groove with a
Robert Story freehand (he's based in Cleveland, Ohio) I received as a
gift.  I also have a Peterson ("the thinking man's pipe", I believe?),
and just bought a Nording freehand.  Reading all the past digests and
the traffic on alt.smokers.pipes has somewhat awed me by the amount of
information floating around there.  I have much to learn is all I can
say!
By the way, looking at the one pipe museum listed in the Resource Guide,
I thought there was another one in Lausanne (Switzerland?).  I remember
browsing through the E.R. Hamilton book lists and saw a "Lausanne Pipe
Museum" book, but it was $50 so I passed it by.  Now I can't find it
anymore (E.R. sells publisher's overruns and so forth), so I guess I
should have grabbed it.
I'm now looking at buying a really high quality straight-grained
freehand briar.  It looks like I'll be in the $150-$200 range, judging
from previous posts.  Unfortunately, mail-order is the only means I have
to acquire something like this.  Toledo Ohio doesn't seem to have much
in the way of REAL tobacco and pipe shops!

Administrative note: I updated the tagline to honor the efforts of
Richard Geller and Steve Beaty, our intrepid FTP/Web/Mosaic site
maintainers, and to direct members to the sites. Also, to reflect the
large cigar-oriented segment of the Digest readership. Hope you like
it! 

Also, for U.S. citizens, this will be the last Digest before Election
Day: Tuesday, November 8. Please, remember to vote. And please take
the time to do a little research. Find out the candidates' opinions on
the moderate use of tobacco. See whether they support your Fourth
Amendment right to assemble peacefully for the legal purpose of
smoking. Vote accordingly. Thanks!

With that, my friends, let us light up with a mellow election-eve
smoke as we ponder the finer points of silly gurgles,
eighteen-wheelers, concertos for stogie and aircondition, the
U.S. Capital, London nightlife, J.S. Bach, Vienna, techno,
hod-carrying, religious doctrine, April Fools, Esquimaux, antiquing,
college life, mosquitos, and too, too much more...

<a name="2">Subject: A (silly) question</a>

Steve,

I have what might seem a stupid question in that I can't recall having this
problem before.  I am seasoning a pipe, and am about to the half a bowl stage. 
Before I can smoke the bowl to the bottom, moisture/liquid/whatever builds up
at the bottom of the bowl, so that a draw makes a bubbling sound.  I'm not
drooling into the stem, so I imagine the moisture is released from the tobak. 
So what is going on and how do I prevent it?  I have started pipe smoking again
after a few years respite, and like I said I don't recall having this problem
before.

Sincerely,

Matt Arndt

[ I think you're right; the tobacco is too wet. Just let it dry out a
little, and see if that helps. -S. ]

<a name="3">Subject: An Entry to the Digest</a>

Steve --

'Bout time I put my two cents in here...been a happy recipient and
member of this list now for a few issues.  I'm really glad to see
Pipes Digest out here in dataland.

Thought I post a bit about myself and where I'm at with pipesmoking
these days.

I'm originally from Santa Monica, California.  Lived in California
most of my life, though did live in Alaska as a youngster and Oregon
later on for a year.  Been living in Taipei, Taiwan since 1987.  Came
over out of a long-time interest in China and it ended up being home.

I've been around pipes my whole life.  My grandfather smoked them and
so did my step-dad Jack.  Jack was your proverbial pipe smoker.
Couldn't even think of him without a pipe stuck in his mouth or him
tooling/packing/tapping it.  When I think of Jack I think of the sweet
smell of tobacco, and the care/skill with which he practiced his
smoking art.  As I understand it Jack resides in the Holy Heavenly
Smoking Section of the nether-realms.

My grandfather, though a cigarette smoker by habit (not a chainer),
liked smoking pipes and had a pretty good collection of them.

I somehow inherited both my grandfather and stepfather's pipes years
ago.

                               *  *  *

Sometime during my trucking days I thought a pipe might be nice break
from the constant machine rolled cigarettes.  Went into the collection
and grabbed a couple that looked good and went to a local Tinder Box
for some tobacco.

Out there somewhere in the 48 contiguous states I was driving through
a long expressionless stretch of highway.  The weather was cool and
I decided to break out the pipes and tobacco I'd brought along.

I knew a little about how to pack a bowl and keep it lit from watching
Jack.  So I packed up a bowl and got it fired up.  I immediately
enjoyed watching the curl of smoke coming out of the bowl swirling out
the window kind of mixing with the smoke from left stack I could see
in the driver mirror.  With the cool breeze blowing in the smell of
good pipe tobacco started filling the cab and bringing back fond
memories of Alaska, the woods, and cozy eves by the fire.  It felt
very natural to hold the pipe.  Obviously a pipe smoker in a previous
life.

I was 21 when I started driving interstate.  Drove for 11 years and
then came here 7 years ago.  39 now.

Though I still smoke cigarettes (usually roll my own), the pipe is still
a fine friend during the cooler months here in Taipei.

                               *  *  *

Pipe smokers here are far and few between.  A lot of the older men
smoke and many like using elaborate cigarette holders. Some of these
holders are nothing more than a pipe with a metal insert that a
cigarette fits into.

However there are a few out there, but unfortunately for them (and me)
there is not one single pipe tobacco store that I know of (been
looking for awhile and inquiries have included the Taiwan Tobacco and
Wine Monopoly Bureau (how's that for a government office name?), and
several of the finer hotels here (which at one time did have good
tobacco shops).

This isn't because Taiwan has anything against smoking.  Smoking is
one of the favorite pasttimes of Chinese.  Though they are starting
anti-smoking campaigns here to some degree, on the Mainland
(China) "everybody smokes".  They smoke cigarettes and for some reason
didn't get the idea of the pipe or a good cigar.

Whatever tobacco I get is either from Hong Kong, where there are some
good shops, or from the states.

Hong Kong
---------
Davidoff (HK Tobacconist)
Shop G12

The Landmark
Central, Hong Kong
Tel. 852.525.5428

Most recently I received an octogonal tin which contained five
roundtins of different blends of Dunhill's choice blends.  Nightcap
(Perique, Turkish, Virgina, Latakia); Mixture 965 (Brown Cavendish,
Macedonia, Latakia); Royal Yacht (Lemon and Bronze Virginia); Standard
Mixture Medium (Traditional English Tobacco); and Early Morning Pipe
(Oriental, Latakia, Bright and Red Virginia).  This is a real treat.

The only pipe tobacco available here is Captain Black (I think), sold
in small pouches.  Freshness in question.

I do occasionally enjoy a cigar that is available at two shops called
Ritmeester.  They're small hand-rolled cigarillos.  Not bad.

Well that's it for this one.  If anyone needs Pipes Digest it's us
over here on this island, where the contents of the digest are
mightily appreciated.

Incidentally, a good friend of mine (an American who has been living
in Asia for 20 years and now resides in Chiang Mai Thailand) also
likes to roll his own tobacco and recently sent me this little
*recipe* (though this might be out of bounds for inclusion in Pipes
Digest):

Roll Yr Own Cigarette Blend:

"You can get some good pipe tobacco (I like Borkum Riff "Mild"), put
it on a chopping board and chop it up with a cleaver, then mix in
whatever proportion you like with good Virginia, or better yet Yunnan
(note: Province in Mainland China) tobacco. Go down to a Chinese
herbal pharmarcy (easy to find here of course) and buy some "Kuan Tung
Hwa" (Chinese handwritten characters omitted for sake of the
illiterate) which is Chinese for "Coltsfoot."  It's a medicinal herb
used for tonifying the lungs, curing chronic coughs, and other
respiratory problems, and one of the traditional ways of administering
it is to smoke it!  Yessiree, Bob!  Just chop some up on a board, as
above, and blend with your tobaccos.  Not only does it soothe the
lungs and throat, it really tasts good and improves the overall
fragrance and flavor of the smoke.  I use about 1/3 Coltsfoot, 1/2
Borkum Riff Mild, and 1/3 Yunnan blonde.  A major leap forward in
smoking art!"

Hello!  I wanted to let your readers know my experience with the company:  NML
Pipes Direct.  Initially, I requested information from them--they specialize in
new and used pipes.  I received a photographic listing of their current stock,
saw a pipe I loved, and gave them a telephone call to place my order.  Not only
were they friendly, but EXTREMELY outgoing and helpful.  I ordered a second
unsmoked Peterson Holmes pipe at a very reasonable price.  It arrived at my
door--from Burlington, Vermont to Toronto, Ontario--within just a few days.  I
couldn't believe how fast it arrived!  Additionally, a note was attached to
tell me that he had another of the Sherlock Holmes pipes--I was familiar with
the one he was referring to, but his picture, and the time to write me a
personal note to let me know about this pipe was very much         appreciated.
 You can bet that I will order from this business again!  Their address is: 
NML Pipes Direct, 80 Austin Drive, Unit #92, Burlington, Vermont  05401,
Telephone (802) 863-1379.  If you'd like, tell them Dwayne (the Sherlock Holmes
fanatic) from Toronto, referred you...

On a secondary note, I am interested in chatting with other BEARDED,
PIPE-SMOKING MEN of GAY orientation, like myself.  My Internet address is:

<a name="6">Subject: 21 Window Salute and other stuff</a>

   Steve, 
        I tried to E-mail you back to let you know that I think i can handle
2 megs, but they said I had the wrong address. I'm not sure if my "mailbag"
can handle it, so if you could, start with the FAQ. Thanks.
        Living in the southwest, Arizona to be exact, we've pretty much
passed the days where you could light your cigar or pipe by just stepping
outside. Now that the afternoons and evenings have become bearable, if not
beautiful, I venture outside with Sosa in hand to enjoy the peace and smoke,
to watch my 2 year old terrorize the ants and pull over the old ladies ( on
his scooter police car) for going to slow, and then finally to hear the 21
Window Salute. Huh, you ask? Well , you see, I live in an apartment and with
the weather change, many people opt to turn the AC off at night and open the
window. Until I, the conducter, decide to start the show. With baton in hand
I light the end and wave it around , take a puff or two, and it starts.
Swiish! BANG!!!, Swiish!!!BANG!!! BANG!!!BANG!!!
     It has become an evening ritual on my nights off. Im sure they are
thankful I do work nights. Not for long, Ha Ha! After the Overture, back to
my cigar and son...Now back to you.

[ Sounds like a fun event! Perhaps someday you could organize a
concert? :-) -S. ]

Subscribe.

Please use this return address. I am interested in particular the negative
health effects of Cigar Smoking. (Are there any?) for a research project.

Thank you

[ Lots of debate on that one; there are, indeed, some negative effects
of excessive smoking, though there have been some stats to the effect
that pipe and cigar smokers live _longer_ than nonsmokers. I refer you
to Digests #162 and #163. BTW, can someone please explain what the
"relative risk" or "mortality ratio" numbers are supposed to signify
anyway? Briarman? -S. ]

<a name="8">Subject: Pipeworks and Wilke</a>

When I was in Manchester, VT last week visiting a friend, I had the 
plesant experience of dicovering that Pipeworks and Wilke had a shop in 
town.  I told my friend (non-smoker, bleh) that I discovered it but he 
told me it had closed.  He was likely happy to tell me that in his own 
way.  SO, I phoned and found that it hadn't yet closed, but that it was 
indeed closing.

They had 30-40% off the pipes in the store (picked up a couple of Wilkes 
and a "restored estate pipe").  They will continue to operate for mail 
order and perhaps asa store as well from their nearby Shaftsbury, VT pipe 
workshop.  

Strangely enough, because I had no idea I that Pipeshop and Wilke was in 
the Vermont town that I would be visiting, I had seen mention in an 
earlier Pipes Digest that they sold an interesting latakia-laden tobacco 
called High Hat.  Thanks for the suggestion,  I don't remember who 
mentioned it though.  I bought 4 oz and am greatly enjoying it; I also 
tried a blend called Equinox (no. 10), 
which is very aromatic because of a blend of Oriental tobaccos and lemon 
virginia.  It smokes wonderfully and has a rich flavour; it reminds me a 
lot of a European mix called Universal Blend.

At $6.50 for 4 oz. this was especially reasonable for me because back 
home in Montreal, a similar quality/quantity would cost closer to $18.  
Definitely a good place to mail order from.

Well, my red rapparee is burning out....

Cheers,

Kevin Cook,
Montreal

     Taco bell and cavindish is _not_  the greatest combination.

     However, thanks to our esteemed editorUs chance remark, I have discovered 
the fabulous combination including Bengal Slices, his suggestion,  and Chivas 
Regal.  Wow.  I have waited too long to try tobacco thatUs not a RHouse BlendS
IUm glad I did.  Other that the famous Sobraine tobacco, whatUs everyoneUs 
favorite tin?  I would recommend the Slices to anyone who likes an English 
blend.  Also the Mac Baren Mixture, for a heavy aromatic.
     I would like to apologize for my formatting errors that made the otherwise
organized Digest look otherwise.  I make use of my word processor so as that my
spelling does not embarrass me.  I then cut and paste into my mail client, 
where the page layout differs.  I have changed the layout of the page in my 
word processor, so I hope things will look a little better.
     Mr. JohnsonUs article in #162 was a masterpiece, wouldnUt you agree?  
RSlight decreases in [death rates due to cancer in] both ... [pipe and cigar 
smokers]...S ???  This is news, indeed.  Perhaps we should be glad in the 
change in professionals holding the Surgeon General chair, hmm?  Then again, 
legalization of weed, but prohibition of tobak?  Not ...
     I purchased a Nording Signature freehand from my tobacconist at the Tinder
Box recently.  Definitely the best smoke IUve ever had, and it isnUt even 
broken in yet.  I would suggest one to everyone - $45 is a _small_ price to pay
for a smoke this nice, and a signature besides.  A great collectorUs pipe, as 
well.  The pipe is unfinished, and it is already coloring nicely.
     My wife, however, purchased (at the same time - set us back a bit) a 
Savinelli Alligator in a bent bulldog.  This pipe is like a piece of jewelry.  
What a classy look, and a great smoke as well.  I am a pleased man.
     Recently, I received a few back issues of The Pipe SmokerUs Ephermis.  
Fun, but disorganized.   What would everyone think of a pipe mag on the order 
of Cigar Aficionado?  Some 15% advertising, general interest stories like book 
reviews, etc, and the like.  Would it be welcome?  Would it be read?  Any 
manufacturers out there?  Interest in advertising out there?  Any comments, 
thoughts, philosophy, etc. would be appreciated.
     I appreciated KamUs comments on piping while Ron the trailS.  I am looking
forward to getting Rout thereS.  I am also interested in some of that coffee, 
Kam.  Let me know.
     To Ted Wagner, The Tinder Box in Columbus, Ohio has a blend I think youUll
like.  It is called Strawberry, and IUll send you some for a sample of your 
favorite blend.  Get in touch, and weUll trade snail mail addresses.  You also 
might try the Mac Baren Mixture I mentioned above.
     Winter is fast approaching, and I have restarted my study of Aristotle.  
That man would have been a pipe smoker.  His TEthicsU make for good reading 
during a bowl full of a heavy English blend like Connoisseur from the Tinder 
Box.  Give it a try.  Also, Ayn RandUs work is good reading for a heavy 
aromatic like the Mixture.
     An addendum of sorts to Briar ManUs note in #163: I am planning to take a 
day or two from analyzing systems for Sears in the near future and put my 
Information training to work compiling some of the raw facts available from the
1990 census, the S&amp;S smoking study done in T92, and some well known cancer 
research.  I will hope to have some compiled results, which will be available 
for the asking, by January.  Perhaps a hypertext version will be available by 
then, though my HTML is rusty, now.  Would there be room on the smokers URL for
this?  Perhaps.
     Last week, I attended the first Tinder Box Cigar Event held in Columbus in
living memory.  Not only did my friend Ernie pick up the tab, a mere $15, but I
won a box of Santa Rosas also.  What an event.  Mike, the local Tobacconist, 
said that the night was about cigars, not food, so as to keep the tickets 
reasonable.  He succeeded.  Not only were there two cigar rollers there from 
the Santa Rosa factory, but also a major manufacturer of Lucite humidors.  the 
Santa Rosa staff was handing out free, freshly rolled cigars.  If you have not 
had the pleasure, you have really missed out.  What an experience.
     Well, bedtime.  Have a good week.
          Friends,
               Sempf.

[ I look forward to reading the results of your efforts, Sempf! -S. ]

Dear Sirs,

Having just recently started a subscription to Pipes Digest, I wanted give you
some information about CIGAR tasting evenings in the UK &amp; London.

About every three months, Mosimann's that world famous restaurant
owned by Anton, in conjunction with Hunters &amp; Frankau, the importers
of Cuban Cigars into the UK, hold a cigar tasting evening.

The cost is around UKL85.00/US$135 which includes a four course meal,
coffee, petite fours, champagne, wine, cognac and of course, cigars.

The last event took place on Thursday October 20th and was a great evening.
Simon gave a speech all about the making of a cuban cigar and as a special
treat, Rodolpho one of the world's greatest rollers gave us a demonstration.
Rodolpho is very important, he even rolled cigars for Churchill!

During the evening we tasted three cigars, Bolivar, Partagas and a Cohiba. On
top of that, we were each given a freshly rolled cigar to take home and enjoy.

This is the second time I have attended such an event and cannot wait until the
next time. My wife accompanied me and she was even given a specially rolled up
'thin' cigar to taste, which she enjoyed. Now I am under less pressure to give
up and she freely admitted to understanding why I enjoy it.

If you want more information on these events, either contact Simon or Eva who
I'm sure will only be too pleased to assist.

Thank-you Kevin for supplying the information on Montreal's Blatter and
Blatter, I had every intention of doing the same but finding the time
has been a bit of a problem.  I agree that their prices and selection of
quality pipes is practically unparalled and I am particularly fond of
their own selection of pipes.  Seconds are available for $25-35, while a
very fine pipe can be had for $60CND.  Monsieur Blatter took me through
the initiation of my first pipe when I was 17 (ten years ago) and a little
publicity is the least I can do for someone who introduced me to the

Just found this, and thought that people here might find it as amusing
as I did. I'm typing this in shamelessly from the program for the
Santa Fe Pro Musica chamber orchestra and ensemble, so anyone who lives
anywhere near Santa Fe, NM should go to a concert to get their own
copy. Besides, the music is *fabulous*. All following this paragraph
is from the article. The translator is not credited.

"A poem from the second _Little Clavier Book for Anna Magdalena Bach_
of which [J. S.] Bach is believed to be the author, offers an amusing insight
into this most beloved genius."

Whene'r I take my pipe and stuff it
And smoke to pass the time away
My thoughts, as I sit there and puff it,
Dwell on a picture sad and gray:
It teaches me that very like
Am I myself unto my pipe.

Like me, this pipe so fragrant burning
Is made of naught but earth and clay;
To earth I too shall be returning.
It falls and, ere I'd think to say,
It breaks in two before my eyes;
In store for me a like fate lies.

No stain the pipe's hue yet doth darken;
It remains white. Thus do I know
That when to death's call I must harken
My body, too, all pale will grow.
To black beneath the sod 'twill turn,
Likewise the pipe, if oft it burn.

Or whan the pipe is fairly glowing,
Behold then, instantaneously,
The smoke off into thin air going,
Till naught but ash is left to see.
Man's fame likewise away will burn
And unto dust his body turn.

How oft it happens when one's smoking:
The stopper's missing from its shelf,
And one goes with one's finger poking
Into the bowl and burns oneself.
If in the pipe such pain doth dwell,
How host must be the pains of Hell.

Thus o'er my pipe, in contemplation
Of such things, I can constantly
Indulge in fruitful meditation,
And so, puffing contentedly,
On land, on sea, at home, abroad,
I smoke my pipe and worship God.

<a name="21">Subject: Questions for the Group</a>

Steve,
	I hope your trip out of the country was enjoyable (not all
business, I hope!).  Welcome back.
	I have a question.  Working in a college library you'd think
that I could find an answer but so far I've not come up with anything
really satisfactory.  The question is:  Why is a pipe sometimes 
referred to as a "hod"? (and it seems that I only hear older - 
60+ men refer to it as such).  My dad, who was a pipe smoker for
many years and who is 74 years old always referred to his pipe
(somewhat deprecatingly, I thought) as "his old hod".  I've checked
the dictionary (even the OED) and the first definition says that a
hod is a trough used to carry building materials - such as bricks - 
on the shoulder.  The second definition says that a hod is a coal
scuttle.  (My dad doesn't know where he first picked up the term).
I suppose that, stretching your imagination somewhat, you could 
describe a pipe as carrying tobacco and a coal scuttle does 
(sometimes) carry burning coals as a pipe does "carry" burning
tobacco.  But, to my mind, that stretches it a bit. (BTW, there
are no literary allusions quoted in the OED describing a tobacco
pipe as a "hod").  Any thoughts?  I'm just curious.
	Another somewhat trivial concern I have is this.  If I'm 
smoking my pipe anywhere other than when I'm sitting in my armchair
I'm carry a pack of (usually) Dill's brand pipe cleaners in my back
pocket.  The pipe cleaners inevitably get squashed and bent whenever
I bend over or sit.  They still perform okay but it's irritating (to
me, anyway)to have to straighten them out in order to use them.  I've
considered buying a cigar case and putting the cleaners in that since
they are sturdier and wouldn't bend but then putting it in my back
pocket would probably break the case.  I seldom wear a suit coat so
the possibility of putting pipe cleaners in a vest pocket is ruled 
out.  Again, any thoughts?
	Last of all, I'd like to commend everyone on the civilized 
tone of this group.  I really enjoy the discussions.  Pipe smokers
are great people!
	Well, enough.  Talk at ya later.

[ Maybe keep the cleaners with the pipe? Odds are the pipe is already
in a place where it won't get squished. -S. ]

I was wondering if there are any among us, other than myself, who have to
deal with well-meaning but sorely mistaken families and churches that
strictly dissaprove of our wonderful pleasure. I am plagued with having the
basic doctrinal beliefs of a Baptist, but not the absurd list of do's and
don'ts rules. After all, you'll never find much of the rules list in the

I'd like to know how other people have dealt with this problem.

     I want to express my elation for becoming a part of your readership.

     I have been a smoker of the briar for about four years.  I presently
am a part-time associate at a local tobacco shop, The Briary.  My pipes of
choice are Comoy, Charatan, Ascorti, Camminetto, Peterson, Cavicchi, and
even American (a one-man company out of Pa.).  My favorite blends of tobacco
are diverse but, I feel, are tasteful:  P.S.'s Champagne blend, Mac Baren's
Scottish Mixture, and most natural non-aromatic cavendishes.  Tin's, flakes,
and hand-rubbed selections are fair game when I'm about the smoke shop.
     I also enjoy an occasional cigar.  A Fonseca, a Zino, or a Partagas
are always a perfect meal by themselves with a cup of Community Coffee from
Louisiana.
     I am a student and teacher of Literature and English.  I write a bit.
I enjoy discourse.  That is one reason I am rather excited about the prospect
of communicating with you folks.
     I am interested in some enjoyable discourse between people who are taking
part in the dying artform of pipe smoking.  I am always in the market for
collecting pipes, gaining knowledge about different tobacco blends, and just
chatting in general.

Thanks again,
Ben

P.S.  I am interested in finding someone who orders or knows how to order
Ashton tobacco blends.  We do not have a distributor who carries Ashton
pipe blends in this area.  We carry the pipes and cigars but not the tobacco.
I am willing to pay for shipping and all of that.  I am particularly interested
in the blends numbered 4 and 5.

Smoke Signal #5

?????@???.???.???

Pipes Digest #163 contained a suggestion for an April-Fools edition
of the digest composed entirely of flame-mail on the understanding
that we say not another word upon them. An annual event would meet
with my approval, composed of the choicest examples with statistics
showing the total number of flames received during the preceding
year. A statistic such as this would give an approximate indication
of the mood of the Nanny Corps who presumes to tell us how to
conduct our lives, at least the section of them that have access to
Internet. Approval of pipe and cigar smoking amongst the population
as a whole is inversely proportional to the number flames received.

What is the role of the critic? It is easy to ridicule, something
to which critics, as a class, are accustomed. It is my belief that
the role of the critic is to steer others of like mind towards the
better things in life, but what is meat to one may be poison to
another, therefore what is recommended by the critic is unlikely to
agree with everyone s taste, so it is gratifying to know that one
person at least found Cope's Escudo worth their while. I had this
mental picture of a gentleman utterly relaxed in his favourite
armchair with his pipe and glass of Napoleon Brandy: although the
addition of tasselled-cap, smoking-jacket of scarlet velvet, with
frog-closures of black silken rope, and quilted lapels of black
satin is an unwarranted flight of fancy.

My nephew-in-law is one of those goateed, university chappies doing
a double major in Philosophy and Psychology at the University of
Minnesota. Recently, he gave up smoking Nat Sherman's cigarettes in
favour of a pipe. To him I sent my copy of Carl "Weber s Guide to
Pipes and Pipe Smoking." Last week I was visiting Ted's Pipe Shop
and noticed that they still had a small pile of these books for
sale, there were about a half-dozen left after I replaced my copy.
If this book is available no longer anyone interested in buying a
copy might like to try speaking to Beth Kanaley, Ted's widow, by
telephone and see if she will do business by mail. Contact Beth at:

Cancer of the mouth was a concern in #163, and so it should be. Too
much of something is usually bad for the body. Last weekend, a
friend of mine drove into town to continue our epistolary
conversation, over afternoon tea in the garden. He spoke of an
fellow he once knew who was a wonderful conversationalist, a
Professor of History I believe who was won't to sit and talk and
punctuate his conversation with puffs on his pipe, which he was
never able to keep lit for very long. In fact he spent much time
relighting with matches or lighter. He died of cancer of the mouth;
seems he was always smoking and always relighting. Here there is a
moral: moderation, a clean pipe, few relights, and tobacco that
doesn't irritate. Too much alcohol and your liver will go to hell.
Too much fatty food and it's time for cardiac arrest. Always we
must balance our diet and our life.

Now let's turn to Alfred Dunhill's "The Pipe Book." He traces
smoking from earliest times and its spread throughout the world. He
is most interested in the variety of pipes constructed by different
peoples, giving the briar short shrift of six pages in the final
chapter. It is a book of most interest to the collector of pipes or
the scholar, less so to the practical smoker, but worth borrowing
from the library to browse. My feeling is that this book would give
a scholar a good beginning, but is of passing interest to the
devotee of the briar. However, it contains several interesting
descriptions of smoking technique.

Eskimo pipes are wrought in ivory of two halves, so that a smoke
channel can be cut by the craftsmen or women, they are lashed
together with strips of hide. Sometimes the stem is bored after
cutting a series of oblong panels from the bottom of the pipe. A
pipe such as this is cleaned by removing the panels and scraping
out the tar and oily refuse, which is eaten by the Eskimo. These
people have constitutions of iron. When they chew tobacco they
swallow instead of spitting. Within the last twenty years or so, I
recall reading a report about an Eskimo whose canoe capsized
pitching him into artic waters. This fellow survived a swim of
thirty minutes before being rescued, normally, a person would die
from hypothermia within five.

Peter the Great sent his envoy Ysbrants Ides across Siberia to the
Emperor of China. Ides reported the Ostiak smokers: "To smoak
tobacco, to which all, both men and women are very much addicted,
instead of pipes, they use a stone kettle, in which they stick a
pipe made for that purpose, and at two or three drawings, after
they have taken some water in their mouths, can suck out the whole
pipe; and they swallow the smoak, after which they fall down and
lie insensible like dead men, with distorted eyes, both hands and
feet trembling for about half and hour. They foam at the mouth, so
that they fall into a sort of epilepsy, and we could not observe
where the smoak vented itself, and in this way several of them are
lost. For as they are on the water travelling, or sitting by the
fire, some of these violent smoakers fall into the water and are
drowned, or into the fire and are burned, but some after they have
sucked the smoak, let it out at their throats again, and these are
in better condition than the others."

While speaking of meerschaum pipes Dunhill reports that "it has
been said that a meeschaum cannot be coloured to perfection if it
is ever allowed to cool, and since there are moments, and even
hours, when the most inveterate pipe-lover must lay his pipe aside,
such perfection seems impossible to obtain. An enthusiast of the
fifties [1850s], however, hit upon the ingenious plan of arranging
through his tobacconist for a detachment of lifeguardsmen to smoke
his pipe in an endless chain so that it was always warm. Swaddled
carefully in soft flannel, and filled always with the best tobacco
at its owner's expense, the pipe passed from mouth to mouth for a
space of seven months. When it was unwrapped, it was coloured a
rich deep brown, pronounced perfect by connoisseurs of the art of
pipe-colouring. But the aesthetic pleasure of the owner in his
unique possession was somewhat dulled when the tobacconist
presented him with a bill for over one hundred pounds, which had
disappeared in smoke!" In those days one hundred pounds Sterling
was equivalent to six or seven hundred Dollars, a comfortable
annual income. And those lifeguardsmen, they are not the types that
sit on a scaffold at the beach watching for sharks, they are the
soldiers trained to guard the Royal Presence

In my next puff I will tell you about some treasure trove and a
couple of old brochures that I found, one advertising Brigham
pipes, and one extolling the virtues of the Best British Briar.

<a name="25">Subject: For the Digest</a>

To fellow pipe smokers,

     I recently found a wonderful book called _The Importance of Living_ by
Lin Yutang.  It is a delightful blend of Chinese and Western philosophy,
composed of many essays covering everything from the sense of humor to the
importance of learning to lie in bed to the joys of reading.  It also has a
small discussion on smoking.  The author is primarily a cigarette smoker, but
this shortcoming is made up for with nice comments about the pipe smoker.
Allow me to quote the appropriate passages:

            "The world today is divided into smokers and non-
          smokers.  It is true that the smokers cause some
          nuisance to the non-smokers, but this nuisance is
          physical, while the nuisance that the non-smokers
          cause the smokers is spiritual. . . .  It is sometimes
          assumed that the non-smokers are morally superior, and
          that they have something to be proud of, not realizing
          that they have missed one of the greatest pleasures of
          mankind.  I am willing to allow that smoking is a
          moral weakness, but on the other hand, we must be wary
          of the man without weaknesses.
            "The man with a pipe in his mouth is the man after
          my own heart.  He is more genial, more sociable, has
          more intimate indiscretions to reveal, and sometimes
          he is quite brilliant in conversation. . . I agree
          entirely with Thackeray, who wrote: 'The pipe draws
          wisdom from the lips of the philosopher, and shuts up
          the mouths of the foolish; it generates a style of
          conversation contemplative, thoughtful, benevolent,
          and unaffected.'
            "A smoker may have dirtier finger-nails, but that is
          no matter when his heart is warm. . . And most
          important of all, a man with a pipe in his mouth is
          always happy, and after all, happiness is the greatest
          of all moral virtues." (pp. 231-232)

The essay contains many more similar observational gems, and I highly
recommend that you all try to locate this book.  For that purpose, as well as
my devotion to academic integrity, I offer the full citation:

     Lin Yutang, _The Importance of Living_.  New York: John Day, 1937.

I am certain that most old public libraries or universities would have this
book.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
        Before I leave, allow me to pose a topic for potential
discussion. I would like to hear various reactions to the following
Dunhill tobaccos available in tins:
                Standard Mixuture Medium
                Mixture 965

                Nightcap

<a name="26">Subject: New Member Bio</a>

  Please allow me to introduce myself.  My name is Gary Bliesener, I just
turned 40, and I am a contracting system administrator/system integrator/
graphics programmer in the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC.  I
live in the small town of Havre de Grace, MD. [For those of you without an
atlas handy it is about halfway between Baltimore, MD and Wilmington, DE,
right where the Susquehanna River enters the Chesapeake Bay.]  Yes, my commute
is 85 miles one way [about 136 km for our metric friends].  Comments in
previous Pipe Digests about the relative simplicity of smoking a pipe while
driving were eye opening.  Thanks to the Gentle Members of this group I now
pack properly and relight much, much less frequently.  This has vastly
improved my survival odds behind the wheel as I negotiate two major
metropolitan areas full of dangerous maniacs who really ought to try to relax
with a pipe :).
  I purchased a Dr. Grabow in 1978 and two English briars in 1979 from a pipe
shop that is no longer in existence :(.  From the FAQ I deduce that one is
simply a conventional straight pipe while the other (my favorite) appears to
be a Prince style pipe.  Unfortunately, being untutored, I managed to make
myself quite ill with the straight pipe on the drive home.  Hence the pipes
went into the back of a drawer, to remain forgotten for many years.  I spent
the intervening years experimenting in the Realm of the Cigar.  West
Virginia's Marsh &amp; Wheeling remain a favorite.  A few months ago, while
browsing the cigar selection in a Pennsylvania pharmacy [yes, I'm a driving
fool - roughly 5000 miles/8000 km a month] I bought some Vanilla Cavendish on
a whim.  Yum!  Cigars?  What cigars?
  Last month I volunteered to drive my mother-in-law to central Kentucky so
that she might visit her oldest daughter for two weeks.  Yes, it was 1400
miles round trip [2240 km].  Knowing, courtesy of Funk &amp; Wagnalls, that
Kentucky was the number two tobacco producer in the US, I was determined to
find some Kentucky pipe tobacco to take home.  My search was fruitless until
the last night of our visit.  While stocking up on caffeine for the drive back
I found a pouch of Granger's - the pointer to fine tobacco [insert nice
picture of pointing dog here] in the local Win-Dixie .  Returning home, I
rushed to try out my find.  The initial aroma upon opening the pouch was
repellent, so I only tried half a bowl.  I found this to be a nice smooth
smoke - no bite at all.  You can imagine this novice pipist's surprise when I
found tins of Granger's in my local grocery while stockpiling caffeine for the
return trip to bring my mother-in-law home.
  Having become a devoted reader of Pipe Digest [I read all the back issues in
three days via the WWW - thanks Steve] I resolved to expand my horizons [and
take advantage of my long commute].  Stopping at Laurel Mall [US Route 1,
Laurel, MD] I discovered a Tinder Box.  However I was disappointed in their
very limited selection [no Bengal Slices, very few pipes].  However, I was
rewarded by stopping at Faders in Eastpoint Mall just east of Baltimore.  For
visitors to the Baltimore area Eastpoint Mall is easily reached via the
Eastern Avenue exits from either I-95 or I-695.  Their phone number is (401)
282-6622.  A delightful shop, complete with a sizable walk-in humidor for
cigars and a helpful staff.  They have a nice selection of tobaccos and
hundreds of pipes.  The pipe selection includes very small bowled pipes that I
am considering for smoke breaks at work [a strict non-smoking environment, I
really can't take an hour outside to savor a full bowl].  They have a wide
selection of handsome briars [some of whose names I recognized from the
Digest] and maybe twenty different kinds of meerschaums.  They were out of
Bengal Slices, but had Bengal Mixture.  Yum, yum!  I also got some Balkan
Sobranie 789, which I found interesting, almost nutty tasting.  My wife likes
the smell of everything else I smoke, but drew the line at the Balkan
Sobranie, so I suppose that this will become my Outdoor/Driving Smoke.  I will
have to bring her here so that I might drop some hints about Particularly
Appreciated Christmas Presents ;).
  Ah well, enough for now, and my apologies for all the driving talk in a pipe
letter.

				Smoky Regards,
				Gary Bliesener

[ Personal message deleted. -S. ]

	News from the Boston Area

	On October 19, 1994 the Sherlock Holmes Pipe Club held its October
meeting.  We had a special presentation by Randy Masters, a non member but a
serious collector of pipes.  He brought with him his collection of Butera
pipes, as well as some Butera pipes sent up from Texas for the presentation by
the maker, Mike Butera.

	Randy told us that he had started smoking a pipe at an early age, as
so many of us have.  He had collected Dunhills, Charatans, and other fine
collectibles. One day he came across and bought a pipe made by Mike Butera,
probably buying it from Barry Levin.  He said he loaded the pipe, smoked a
bowlful and did not get a wet smoke.  He refilled a smoked a second with the
same result.  It was at the end of the third bowl that he began to hear a
gurgle from the bottom of the bowl.  With that, he decided to look into the
maker of this wonderful pipe and learn more.

	Mike Butera, who lives in Texas, was a pipe collector and cigar
fancier in the early 1980's.  He desired to learn more about pipes and how
they were made to enjoy his hobby.  Relatives brought him back fine pipes from
Italy and he learned about the techniques of turning briar into fine pipes.
Not satisfied with what he found in the market, and driven by the same demons
which allowed him to be a success in his profession, Mr. Butera bought several
hundred old eubuchons, some hand tools, and set about creating a new method of
curing briar and new techniques of carving.  He produced three hundred pipes
over the next couple of years in his basement, and through them away when he
finished and was satisfied he now knew how to make good pipes.

	Armed with the techniques he started selling his pipes and hooked up
with Barry Levin to distribute his pipes nationally.  Production is limited to
about 100 pipes a year.  Like all pipe makers he has a line which starts with
carved or sandblasted pipes, progresses through various grades of finishes and
grain quality to his ultimate pipes, straight grains selling for $500-750
each.  Randy has the largest collection of his pipes in the country, having
gotten rid of his Dunhills and others to concentrate on Buteras.  All of them
are fine examples of the art of carving, and to see his collection of 30+
Buteras spread out on a table is enough to make any serious pipe smoker
envious of the collection.  Randy says he calls Mr. Butera about every two
weeks to discuss what is being made so he can have first crack at new
offering, that he does not buy the best Mr. Butera makes, and that he has
never met Mr. Butera face to face.

	Randy explained the system Mr. Butera uses to mark his pipes.  It
includes a code for the year the pipe was made (based on the calendar and the
number of years Mr. Butera has been making pipes), a system for grading the
grain from one to ten (ten being the best) and other marks.  Like all pipe
makers, Mr. Butera changes the system from year to year, so one needs a road
map to follow the markings, creating another level of complexity in the hunt
to understand his work.

	If you want to find his pipes you will have to work hard.  Besides
making under 100 pipes a year, Mr. Butera sells a line of pipe tobaccos and
cigars.  He makes retailers sell his tobacco and cigars to get his pipes.  At
such a low production rate there can be only a few shops stocking the pipes.
Many must disappear into the hands of people like Mr. Masters before they even
get to the retail shops.  Oh well, we can always hope to find one in a yard
sale for three bucks.

	Anyone else out there know more about Mr. Butera, or other local
pipemakers we should be on the lookout for so that we can acquire the superior
and unusual?

	Smoke in peace.

	Steve Wyman
	Concord Massachusetts

<a name="28">Subject: NPR essay on Cigar Smoking (Pipes Digest)</a>

Hello all,

	Did anybody happen to catch Daniel Pinkwater's essay about Cigar 
smoking on National Public Radio this past week?  It was, quite possibly, 
the very first time I've ever heard the media discuss smoking as a 
cultural phenomenon, rather than as some evil that must be wiped out.  
(What really caught my attention was the old joke that he opened the 
essay with - "Hey, do you like music?  Here's a whole band." (at which 
point the smoker gives you the band which came around the cigar.)

	I managed to tape it.  Should there be enough interest (and no 
threats of lawsuits :), I'll transcribe it for a future digest.

	Since I'm writing anyway, I'll go ahead and give you my short 
bio, as I'm a first-time poster to this group.

	I'm 25, and living in Columbus Ohio.  I'm an infrequent pipe smoker 
(once every week or so, as the whim hits me.)  I haven't really been 
smoking long enough to have gotten any particular favorite as far as 
tobaccos go.  Can anyone recomend a mild tobacco mix for a new smoker?  
I'd be grateful for some input.

	Well, that'll do for now, I think.  Until later...

<a name="29">Subject: Thank you!!!</a>

Thanks to Steve Masticola for providing what I think is the *best* thing to
ever hit the Internet!  I just wanted to say that I recently had the
privilege of attending the International Association of Pipe Smokers' Clubs
(IAPSC) World Pipe Smoking Contest in Davenport, Iowa.  From the moment I
entered the room in the basement of the Blackhawk Hotel I was introduced to
over thirty people, all of whom had at least one thing in common, our love
for pipes and tobacco.  Paul T. Spaniola himself invited me to sit in on the
IAPSC meeting, where I got to hear about the plans for the next two years'
contests.  The next one, BTW, is going to be in Louisville, Kentucky, in
October, 1995.
    The contest was great (except for the taste of IAPSC Contest Blend :[
which tastes about as good as it sounds)  I came in 28th, with a time of
22:49-- not bad for my first time, I am told.  My many thanks to the Quad
City Briars for being wonderful hosts and having absolutely great prizes (I
won a new Peterson Kilarney and a Cortland Billiard--not bad for 28th
place!)  Thanks to Marcus Dandaneau and Jack Fink for providing me with
"survival tips" for the contest and letting me pile up all my stuff on their
display table.  Thanks to Mike Tobey and Darren Kirkpatrick for selling me
my very first freehand (a Soren--does anyone here know anything about this
brand).  Thanks to Rex Poggenpohl for lots of advice and addresses and a
copy of Richard Carleton Hacker's the Ultimate Pipe Book.  Thanks to Wayne
Shake for inspiring me to get my new driver's license picture taken with my
pipe (I just turned 21 in August and my license expires 11/22)  Thanks to
Paul T. Spaniola for getting me involved in the whole thing.  Finally thanks
to all of you in the Mailgroup for providing a sense of belonging to pipe
smokers everywhere.
     I would especially like to hear from pipe smokers in Central Illinois.
I would also like to hear from anyone who is interested in joining my
newly-formed club, which is an IAPSC member.  You can contact me in the
following ways:
      Mail     Thomas A. Hendricks

<a name="30">Subject: Antique Stores</a>

I am sure that most of the newsgroup members will be familiar with the 
concept of browsing second hand and antique stores for interesting pipes 
to add to their collections.  For those of you who are not, try it.

This past weekend I was roaming around Vancouver's downtown area 
with my prime goal being a trip to the local tobacconist (Clarkes R.J. 
Tobacconist at 3 Alexander Street, Vancouver, B.C. 604-687-4136 - Here 
is one for the list if you don't already have it Steve).  I don't know 
why I go there when I don't need tobacco because I always start craving 
another pipe to add to my collection.  This time I had my SO with me so 
my visit was restricted to only about fifteen minutes of talking with 
the salesperson about the different pipes at the store.  It never ceases 
to amaze me how quickly she can become disinterested when we are in a 
tobacconist or a tool section whereas she can spend hours looking at and 
trying on clothes she has no intention of buying.  Anyways, I digress.

After being dragged out of the tobacconists, I remembered a friend's 
description of a nearby antique store that occasionally had second hand 
pipes.  Being necessarily a sometimes sneaky person, I set about to 
interest my girlfriend in looking for that "full length mirror" she had 
wanted for so long.  Of course a good place to look for that and other 
bits of furniture for the apartment is an antique store, which just 
happens to be right down the street.

We walked to the store and jackpot - no mirror but someone had brought in
a set of pipes (about 15) just the day before.  None of the pipes were in
what could be described as "excellent condition".  It was obvious that
whoever had owned them had not treated them very well.  After going
through the lot of them, I had found two I was interested in; one
Peterson, and one Brigham, the rest were too dinged up and were no name
brands. 

I checked the Peterson and Brigham over carefully and found every tiny 
flaw on them that I could and then offered the owner of the store $30 for 
both of them (the price tags were $25 for the Peterson and $15 for the 
Brigham).  When she balked at the offer, I began to point out the flaws 
that I had noted before.  She hesitated, checked her book, and protested 
that she could not sell them that low.  So I pointed out some more flaws 
(most of which were minor like; they were both very dirty, the inside of 
their bowls were scratched because someone had cleaned the ash cake out 
of them improperly, and the stems were faded).  After that, she finally 
said ok.  When it was all done, I got both pipes for $33.

I went home and spent the next couple of hours cleaning them out (they 
were quite filthy - it looked as if the person who owned them rarely 
cleaned them so their innards were caked with resin).  Anyways, after 
about half a bottle of hot alcohol and who knows how many pipe cleaners, 
they were nearly sparkling.  The alcohol I used had faded the stems some 
more (I tried to keep it off the outside of them as much as I could but 
they were almost plugged with resin so they needed too much cleaning to 
not  spill some on them) so I tried rubbing them lightly with olive oil.  
It was the only thing that I could think of at the time and it actually 
seems to have worked quite well.  The stems are now better than when I 
first saw the pipes and almost as good as the stems on my pipes which I 
had purchased new.

I let the two "new" pipes sit over night so the alcohol would have lots of
time to evaporate and tried the Peterson this morning as I was walking to
class.  My first impression of the old pipe is:  It leaves my other
Brigham (my previous "favorite pipe") way behind.  Maybe that is just
because it is new or something like that but it was certainly an enjoyable
first smoke. 

To end it all off.  I purchased what I suspect would have cost at least
$150 new for $30 and a little "elbow grease".  My day was made.  I would
suggest that anyone who is interested in expanding their collection who
doesn't look around in antique stores already, get out there and do so. 
It is well worth the effort.

Greetings and Salutations to All.
        I'm Gabrielle and I don't think I can convey to you how happy I am
to have found all of you.  From the brief time I've been a part of your
group I feel it is going to be a long and fruitful relationship.  I'm a
sophomore at Ohio State University, recently married and extremely
fascinated by pies and pipe smokers alike.
        My brief smoking history:
        Right before our wedding my fiance stumbled across pipe smoking,
lit up in front of me and I thought "What am I getting myself into?".  Next
thing I know I'm puffing away with the rest of you.
        When my husband first began his pipe smoking adventure he (out of
seeming guilt about the smell) kept buying me five dollar a box cigarettes.
It was a ice change from the bargain brands I had smoked  in high school
before I quit but they just didn't satisfy me.  Eventually after much
wasted money, many nearly full packs hitting the trash can, and stealing
multitudes of puffs from my husbands' pipes we finally got the point.
        My first pipe was a small red bent apple second by 'who knows?' to
try the water (or tobacco rather).   I was hooked immediately and currently
I am enjoying a Savinelli bent Bulldog with an alligator finish with no
thoughts of quitting.  As for tobacco I'm trying Sherlock and Anniversary,
a couple of Tinder Box blends.  Plus Five Wizards and an English blend from
Barclay Pipe and Tobacco that I can't remember the name of.  I am willing
and ready to explore any suggestions any of you might have.  Pipe or
tobacco wise.  Also if any of you hear of any pipe 'get togethers' in or
around Ohio please let me know.  Being new I would find it informative and
interesting.
        The best part of pipe smoking is that my husband thinks my smoking
is wonderful, supports me,  and is quite willing to share each new
experience together.  It's going to make Christmas and Birthdays really
easy from now on.
        Thank you for allowing me to ramble a bit and introduce myself.
                                        Smokingly yours,
                                                Gabrielle

I'd taken the standard route into Pipeville: straight down Amphora St in a
overheated Czech Briarmobile. Got the hang of cruising slowly with only
minimal stops for relighting. Time, I thought, to upgrade. I had my eye on
a BC Commander. Heavy, even masculine, but still French. Only NZ$45. "It's
a very good pipe", the tobacconist said nervously. (Next on the purchase
list: a Dr John English briar.)

Looked about the shelves. In my two-bit home town, you can only get about a
dozen different kinds of tobacco in 50g pouches... but wait - on the top
shelves - tins of Dunhill! Ultra-light, Aromatic, and Dark. "Hmmm", thinks
I, "Aromatic might be the one to follow from Amphora". It smells like
Grandma's Christmas fruitcake. Will try it out tonight.

ObTobak: I keep seeing mentions of various brands of tobacco. Now owing to
punishing sales tax here (NZ), pipe tobacco is too expensive to experiment
with on a budget. Could we compile reviews of common pipe tobacco brands,
aiming at something like Laszlo's amazing cigarette survey (see the
alt.smoker's FAQ)? It would make those first forays into different tobaccos
just that little bit more secure.

ObPipe: International price comparisons are very interesting. Seems that
pipes are rather cheaper here than in the US, while tobacco is
mega-expensive. Anyone got any thoughts on where globe trotters should buy
their paraphernalia ("Smoker's requisites" is the old phrase, isn't it?)?
I'm not going anywhere soon, but I could always give a travelling friend
some money.

Wishing you contented smoking,

Thanks for the subscription.  I dont really smoke a pipe very often, I 
am an avid cigar smoker.  I have recently bought a pipe and a couple of 
blends, however, I dont know any pipe smokers and I have had trouble 
enjoying it because of problems with keeping the tobacco burning.  As I 
said, I do enjoy cigars.  Right now my favorite is the Arturo Fuente 
Hemingway series.  I also enjoy Partagas and Macanudo.  I had my first 
cuban (a Cohiba) last week, while visiting Mexico.  I loved it.  I look 
forward to receiving your publication each week.  It is truly a joy to 
find others who enjoy the pleasure of a fine smoke.  Hope you can help 
me learn to enjoy a pipe as much as I enjoy cigars.  Talk to you later.

Hello out there.  I'm looking for cigar smokers (men and women) in the 
Denver/Boulder area who might like to correspond and share a smoke sometimes.  

Perhaps some of you might have heard about the Boulder Wine Merchant 
Cigar/Port dinner this NOV. 9.  The dinner is held at one of Colorado's finest 
restaurants - Greenbriar Inn - and after dinner, port and cigars.  I'll really 
tantalize you with the menu:

Roast venison sirloin with port &amp; fig sauce
grilled duck sausage
roasted red pepper and w/ fennel and wild rice pancakes
This will be followed by a '70 Fonseca Vintage Port and cigars!

Anyway, if you're in the Boulder/Denver area, let me hear from you!

<a name="40">Subject: about me</a>

	Fellow Pipesters,

	As a new member of this group, I hoped to share my thoughts on
pipe smoking and related matters. My first issue of Pipes Digest (163)
was made very enjoyable by finding so many who share my love of pipes
and tobacco and their abilities to relate this through mail on the
'net. It was wonderful reading on one of my favored subjects. Thanks
to all who wrote in from a new reader.
	Now, to the point.
	I am, from what I read, a fairly young pipe smoker. I will
turn 27 in Jan.  '95 and have been smoking pipes for about 18 mos. My
grandfather was also a pipe smoker, so I suppose that had something to
do with my interest. Man, if I could only find his pipes! :^)
	After reading (and re-reading) Weber's Guide to Pipes and Pipe
Smoking, I bought a Comoy's briar for $40 as my first pipe. I didn't
want to start with a less expensive pipe, as Weber and everyone I
talked to said 'you get what you pay for', especially in pipes. It is
a rather non-descript pipe of plain brown briar, although it now has a
banded shank, which makes it a bit more distinctive than some. The
band, BTW is a necessary feature resulting from an accident I had in
less experienced times while cleaning it. :^) For all the damage it's
suffered at my novice hands, it still smokes nice and cool.
	I have since accquired two more pipes: a Peterson "Killarney"
in a nice bent shape with the standard and unbeatable "Peterson bit"
and a great NM-xrding freehand I received as a birthday present. It
was originally without a stain, and has since colored to a wonderfully
rich deep hue somewhere between that of the natural briar and
tobacco. I was told that this is similar to the process a meerschaum
undergoes with regular smoking.
	I smoke mainly aromatics from the 'private' blends of our
local retailer, "The Pipe and Tobacco Shop." With such an inventive
name [ :^) ] , you might be misled into thinking that they are a
rather generic franchise shop; NOT so! The shop has an individual
flair with an exceptionally friendly staff.  After only two or three
trips my friends and I made, they all began to at least recognize our
faces and associate them with our favorite blends and pipe purchases,
and one guy there remembers our names. They also stock a wide variety
of chess sets, which is another passion of mine. Now, if they would
only carry soccer equipment... :^&gt;.
	The two blends I choose most are 'Deerhunter' which is light and had an
almost fruity aroma and taste, and 'Capitol Spice'  which is best described
as a mild dark Danish with no bite. I hope to hear from others here about
their favorite blends, and would consider making a swap via post.
	Anyway, there it is. I hope this isn't too long-winded (
-fingered ), and of SOME interest to you folks. Obviously, if
Mr. Masticola (Steve) wants to edit for legnth I don't mind.

	Smoke in peace `\U,
	Mike Sims, in Little Rock, Ark.
	(????????@???.???)

	P.S. What is the official pipe-smoker's emoticon? Is it `\U?
    	        Also, please, no Clinton jokes! :^)

there's no official _anything_ on the Internet. -S. ]

<a name="42">Subject: Smoke, Mosquitos, and a Meteor shower</a>

While in the summer months of paradisiacal[dry sarcasm] Florida the
mosquitos--which have been known to pass as large crows--are irrepressible,
the late fall and winter months are only moderately infested. It is in these
few glorious months which the mosquitos can indeed be kept at bay by your
ever friendly pipe. I can attest to this as I was out just this night walking
and smoking, and finally sitting in the driveway of the house--sounds of
large animals and reptiles drove me away from my nightly walk. While I sat
and smoked and watched the sky--many meteors blazing across the sky--the
hell-fiend mosquitos did not bother me. I finished my pipe, emptied it and
took it and my tobacco inside the house and came back out. Within a minute
the blood-thirsty fiends were all about my head, buzzing and biting and
sucking out my life.

Did I mention that I hate Florida?

On a different note: I recently tried a blend full of latakia. While I liked
the flavor and the aroma of the smoke the tobacco seemed to irritate my mouth
more than other blends I have tried. It did not seem to smoke hotter, indeed
it was quite pleasant. But the next day my mouth felt as if I had been
smoking a very hot pipe. Does this irritation have to do with the strength of
the tobacco as well as the heat of the smoke? Any suggestions?

Well, the U.S. elections happened; results appear good for the
continued legality of tobacco (everywhere but California, where
Prop. 188 was defeated, 70%-30%.)

The best news is that Henry Waxman is out as chair of the Senate
Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, to be replaced by Thomas
J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va), a pipe smoker. Quoth Bliley in a Washington Post
interview: "Obviously, I am not as hostile to tobacco and the tobacco
industry as the chairman [Waxman]," adding that "For a while, we're
going to be awfully busy ... and I don't know how much time we're
going to have to devote to tobacco."

As a formerly fairly solid Democrat, I'm kind of sorry that the party
didn't get the message earlier: there is a price to be paid for
persecution. I only hope that they get it now.

Regardless of who you voted for, thanks to all our U.S. members who
took the time to vote on Tuesday! And join us now as we put aside the
political fray for awhile, kick back, light up, and discuss Brice
Catton, aircraft carriers, mangoes, Niagara Falls, flyin' into Los
Angelees (bringin' los Cubanos stogees), cannibalism, the Eastern
Shore of Maryland, Chairman Mao, truffles, and other mysteries...

For some time I've been looking for a quote from Catton's early autobiography.

  Bruce Catton  Waiting for the Morning Train: an American Boyhood
      Garden City, Doubleday, 1972

     "...Terp's dock was full of official types whose cigars lent an 
     elegant fragrance to the clean air. One of the disappointments of 
     my life has been the fact that no cigar has ever tasted as good 
     as that cigar smoke used to smell there by Crystal Lake." P. 55/

it might fit as a filler piece.

Gentleman,

I am new to the Internet and I was very please to see Pipe Digest.  I am a 45 
yers old Internist residing in Western Pennsylvania.  My interest in pipes 
began in college, but alas I gave it up in 1981 to assist my wife in quitting 
cigarettes.

In the past year, I have started smoking cigars and have enjoyed them very 
much.  In my youth, I had tried cigars, the taste was never to my liking.  
This it turns out was due to my choosing the cheap variety.  I have now gone 
to the handmades and these are superb.

My favorites run the list, but at the top are Licenciados, Arturo
Fuente (especilly the Hemingway Series), Punch, Macanudo.  The more
body the better. My wife even likes an occasional cigar.

I am pleased to see such people as you devoted to the enjoyment of smoking.

as always,
Dennis Demby

<a name="6">Subject: Some (relative) bargains on premium cigars</a>

For those of you with the bucks to spring for premium stogies like Griffins
and Avos, you should be aware of a Chicago outfit, Old Chicago Smoke Shop,
whose prices beat the deep discounters like JR and Famous, and whose prices
for  most other smokes are comparable.   THIS IS ONLY TRUE, HOWEVER, if you
live outside  Illinois and can have them shipped; otherwise, you must pay
the 20% state tax.

Here are some of their prices compared to JR's.  Also note that UPS
shipping is FREE on orders over thirty dollars (I quote only examples, all
the prices on Avos and Griffens are correpondingly lowe)r:

                        OCSS        JR

AVO #5 (25)             $83.39      110.25
Avo Piramide (25)       $108.39    141.75
Griffens #300 (25)      $68.39      90.50
Griffens Prestige (25)  $82.59       114.50

They can be reached at 800-621-1453; address is Old Chicago Smoke Shop,
Mail Order Division 3300 West Devon Ave., Lincolnwood, IL  60659.  They
will also send a crudely-printed catalogue that reflects their commitment
to low overhead.

The salesman also gave me a bunch of interesting cigar information that
I'll pass on in a succeeding message.

Steve:

The CORPS 10th Aniversary Show was outstanding.  All 90+ tables were full and
everyone had lots of fun trading, buying, and  trying new tobaccos.

We (Corps) are already planning next year's expo for Columbus Day Weekend.
The location has been very popular with the attendees, but we are rapidly
outgrowing the location.  Ninty tables tables filled the hall  and the isles
were very narrow (3 ft.) and with two people back to back trading with
opposite tables... no one could pass this traffic jam.  I have to admit that
this contributed a bit to the friendly and lively atmosphere.

Obviously,  the atmosphere was "smokey", but the hotel's HVAC System, with
the help of couple back doors being open,  prevented an overwhelming fog.

Here are a couple of items to update your  database:

Comments:  I have tried several of their mild aromatics.  Very good smokes.
They also sell cigars, handle pipe repairs, and sell blending tobaccos.

Roanoke, VA 24011

Tel:  (703) 344-5191

The pipe shop has large walk in humidor, very nice "smoking area" to
relax and enjoy your favorite, and has a very large estate pipe
collection. Excellent atmosphere to browse and chat.  The colorful,
beautiful 1993/1994 catalog has the history of the shop inserted with
the names of the mixtures and the prices.  The shop does an extensive
mail-order business.

The selection of blends is under revision by current owner.  He will
discontinue some blends and make available some of the blends that he
brought from his former shop in Florida.

Milan Bros. was named as "The Tobacconist of the Year" (1994) by the
Conclave of Richmond Pipe Smokers. The engraved plate is proudly
displayed near the "smoking area".

Comment: During my last visit (3 days ago) I selected some of his
better sellers and found that "Hillman" and "Presidential" are two
very fine smoking blends.  I have not tried: "Buckingham" (English,
obviously.); "Oasis" (Turkish); "Honey Smoke" (aromatic- that smells
nice in the pouch).  I purchased a new "Nording", free-hand...slight
bent. Smokes very nice without using any sweetener for breaking in.

I suggest that people obtain the current catalog while in stock.  It
is unlikely that the new owner will print the history of the shop in
the new catalog that is currently in the planning stages.

My name is John Mayfield.  I'm 32 years old and have been smoking pipes since
I was 15 years old.  I started with a good old Dr. Grabow,  and used it for
quite a few years.  I had quite an extensive collection until my family and I
became a statistic of sorts.  I was transferred from San Diego Ca. to Norfolk
Va.  I opted to have the government move our personal effects.  As fate would
have it our entire shipment of household goods were lost in a fire, so now my
collection begins again.  My tastes in tobacco run from mild aromatic blends
to full bodied english blends.  Fortunately my wife enjoys the aroma of pipe
tobacco.  Unfortunately being stationed onboard an aircraft carrier with only
2 smoking areas leaves me little time at work to smoke.  My tastes in pipes
run to the large freehands, I also enjoy the aesthetics of any well made
pipe!!  To date I now have 1 Meershaum, and 9 briars.  The briars run from no
name seconds to a Savinelli Autograph.  I also have 2 pipes made and signed
by Randy Wiley.
Now the time has come to sit outside in the cool Autumn evening and enjoy a
bowl of fine leaf!!

Smoke in peace,

Steve,
  Thanks for patiently helping me locate the back issues of Pipes Digest!  I
was fortunate enough to locate a computer lab instructor who knew what "ftp"
was and how to use it!  Anyway, I just finished reading Digests #1-11 and
imagine my delight when I read #7 which contained a letter from Ami
Silberman who mentioned Pat Callighan &lt;sp?&gt; in Champaign (a mere hour from
my home)  You know Pat?!!  I am rapidly discovering how much smaller the
Internet is making this world...
  Now I just *have* to try some of this mango blend Ami mentioned.
Goodness, I haven't talked to Pat for nearly three weeks! (I can tell him
you said "Hi")
  Also, for anyone in the Central Illinois area, I just wanted to say that
Bloomington-Normal finally has a tobacco shop (I just started working there
part-time)  I absolutely *hate* the name of this place--it's called
"Cigarette Express" (My friend Bob Gaydos, pres. of the Peoria Area Cigar
Society (cf Cigar Aficionado Fall '94) hasn't stopped kidding me about it
yet)  About 2/3 of the shop is full of carton after carton of American
cigarettes.  The rest of the shop has domestic machine-made cigars and Dr.
Grabow pipes and commercial pipe tobaccos (no Amphora here...)  The one
saving grace is the humidified display case of premium cigars (which haven't
even arrived yet, though I'm told they will arrive within the next
week--anyone ever hear *that* line before?)  It appears I have a lot of work
to do.  If nothing else, I am able to refer customers to Jon's in Champaign.
   That reminds me...

Anyway, I have decided to read the back issues one group at a time in order
to enjoy them slowly (like a Calabash full of "Cumberland Gap"--one of Pat's
blends)
       That's all for now.  Thanks to all of the people who sent me email as

A bit of freeform cerebral meandering.
First, a hearty " Howdy!" to all the gentle puffers from my fair city of
Columbus, Ohio who seem to be increasing in number with each succesive
Digest. I may be reclusive in my pipe smoking habits, but I get a slight
chill knowing there is a semi-secret band of enlightened  subversives jabbing
at the underbelly of the  "meddlesome midwestern coalition to crush the
creative classes and suck up individual rights like a hoover with the heavy
duty beater-brush."
Before I slip into any more radical ramblings.... may I suggest a tobacco
mix?  I was at Barclays in Lane Ave. shoping center, here in Cols. and had
the clerk make me a mix of 1/2 cube cut burley ( mixing material ) and 1/2
Checkers ( a little concoction of their own. ) It makes a very mild, mostly "
englishy " blend, that smokes easy, stays lit longer, and smells , well......
not too awful!
And on a more exotic note: If a guy....say, somewhat like me, perhaps...
driving a car kinda like mine, drove to Buffalo NY and across the" happy
bridge" to Niagara Falls Canada  to take in the sights and, by coincidence,
purchase a cigar of Cuban extraction.Well..... where would a guy like that go
to enjoy a cigar similar to that,  in peace and harmony ? Any suggestions?
P.S.   how do I get one of those snappy footers on the bottom of my letters?

Dear Steve, 
I absolutely love this digest.  I am something of a novice pipe smoker, 
but with all the things I have learned while reading this forum I doubt I 
will be for long.  I am also a big time cigar smoker but my wife will not 
let me smoke them in the house so I am relegated to smoking them in my 
car whenever I am out and about.  My pipes on the other hand she loves 
and will let me smoke them in the house whenever I want.  My father is a 
pipe smoker, where I picked it up from, and sometimes carves his own 
pipes.  However we rarley see or hear much from each other and hae been 
unable to obtain one of his "home mades".  My big question right now 
deals with cigars.  I am preparing to take a cruise to the Mexican 
Riviera in December and want to bring back some Cuban stogies.  I was 
just curious if any one had suggestions on where to buy them in either 
Cabo San Lucas or Mazatlan.  Also, what can I expect at the port in L.A. 
concerning bringing them back into the U.S.?  Are they real sticklers for 
bringing them in or do they have better things to focus on like drugs and 
weapons.  I heard from one friend that the ship's purser announced over 
the intercomm that the officials have trained dogs to sniff your bags for 
them.  This can't be true, is it?  Well, time to go thanks again for all 
the great info.

<a name="12">Subject: a brief biography</a>

Steve - 

Sorry I took so long to get to you with this brief self-introduction.  I
subscribed to the Pipe (&amp; now cigar digest).  I'm a law student in Boston,
about to enter the actual working world, proably in intellectual property
law, which sounds more highfalutin' than it is.  I've smoked a pipe off
and on for the last 4 years, though it has been more off than on until
recently, when I decided to return to my tobacco roots.  My father has
smoked Carter Hall in Missouri Meerschaums as far back as I can remember &amp;
he tells me that he began when he was 13.  When he smokes, he continues to
use the corncobs, despite my efforts to acquire better pipes for him.  Old
habits die hard. 

I didn't actually pick up tobacco until my junior year in college, when I
started smoking Dunhill Reds.  In my senior year i bought a no-name pipe 
which, in tandem with the Dunhills, got me through a senior honors 
thesis, turned in extremely late.  I was pleased to find that the years of 
living around a pipe-smoker had made most of the motions second-nature.  
I also found that the pipe made an excellent twit-repellent - I guess 
that's a secondary benefit.

I put the pipe down for about 3 years, though, and picked up the habit of
rolling my own cigarettes (Drum) while roaming around southern Europe.  I 
still roll my own, as I smoke cigarettes like a pipe, i.e. for the taste &amp;
without inhaling.  Rolling my own allows me to smoke a rich tobacco, is
more portable than my pipe &amp; requires less of a time commitment.  My life
is busy enough that this is unfortunately important. I rely on Leavitt &amp;
Pierce for rolling shag as well, and prefer what I think is their Drum
equivalent (though it's richer).  I've tried Virginia blondes in
cigarettes, but find them tasteless.  I was very interested in the custom
cigarette tobacco recipe in the 11/04 Digest &amp; would love to see more. 
With some time, perhaps I'll try to add suggestions.  Pipe-wise, I smoke L
&amp; P's Black &amp; Gold, which is a nice blend, but am open to suggestions. 

Have been happily cannibalizing the digests for cigar, tobacco &amp; pipe
suggestions.  Right now have only one no-name pipe, which is OK as both
housemates are tolerant non-smokers, so I only smoke one pipe/day.  Thanks
for the great publication.  I tend not to mention my pipe habit because
I'm self-conscious about the age thing, so it's good to see other younger
pipe smokers are out there.  Thanks for the great publication/service. 

Here's to keeping it lit &amp; minimal match use - trees are a valuable resource.

Those of you who live in the S.F. Bay area might note that there are many
fewer pipe stores today than 5 years ago. And many that are left are mostly
"gift shops", that sell a few pipes and tobacco. I have not noted a single
NEW pipe store to open up in all that time.

Well, I happened to be in Menlo Park today, near Kepplers Books. Around the
corner was a new (in fact, not yet open) store - 

Old Knickerbockers Tobacconists
Cigars, Pipes, Rare Tobaccos, Smoker's Requisites
555 Santa Cruz Ave, Menlo Park  (415) 327-PIPE


I spoke briefly to the person inside, still setting up the store. From the
outside, it looks like a pipe tobacco store, not a gift shop. They promise
to have some stock of nicer pipes - I plan to check them out when they open
(possibly by end of this week - Nov 11) and will issue a report. The store
is in a small section of the British Bankers Club, for those of you who
know the area.

No, I have no connection to the store. I'm just glad to see a small
reversal in the trend (and another place to check out the latest pipe, or
try a new tobacco).

A MINORITY VIEW
BY WALTER E. WILLIAMS
RELEASE: WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1994

SCIENCE AND TOTALITARIANISM

        Some of the world's most barbarous acts, from slavery to genocide, 
have been facilitated by bogus science. The Food and Drug Administration's Dr.
David Kessler, along with Rep. Henry Waxman and Environmental Protection 
Agency head Carol Browner are modern-day leaders of that ugly scheme. Don't 
get me wrong; I'm not equating them to Hitler. But what distinguishes them is 
a matter of degree but not kind. In pursuit of their vision of what's a 
"desirable" society, they seek to abrogate private property rights, personal 
liberty and rule of law using bogus science to justify their actions. Just as 
decent Germans built a Trojan horse for Hitler to take over, decent Americans 
are doing the same for a future tyrant. Let's look at some of the bogus 
science used by Dr. Kessler and his accomplices in their pursuit of a 
"desirable" society -- one that is smoke-free.
        Kessler's attempt to equate nicotine in cigarettes with other 
addictive drugs is fraud. Traditional definitions of addiction included 
intoxication. The behavioral effects of tobacco differ fundamentally from 
addicting drugs like cocaine, heroin and alcohol. Ask yourself: "Which pilot 
would you like to fly you -- one who's had a couple of cigarettes, a couple 
snorts of cocaine or heroin, or a couple of martinis?" Give me the cigarette 
smoker. Cigarette smoking is more properly labeled a habit like coffee 
consumption. Habits may be difficult to break. Cigarette smokers who attempt 
to break the habit often suffer the same fate of many fat people who work hard
and lose weight only to gain it back again and then try again.
        Dr. Kessler's able accomplice is EPA head Carol Browner. When Browner 
classified environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) as a group A carcinogen, just 
like benzene and asbestos, her actions were based on grossly fraudulent and 
dishonest statistical methodology. Twenty-four of the 30 studies the EPA 
reviewed reported no statistically significant ETS-lung cancer relationship. 
Of the 11 studies done by U.S. scientists, not one reported significant cancer
risk. The EPA was aware of and ignored similar findings of the two largest and
most recent studies on ETS-lung cancer (Stockwell, 1992; Brownson, 1992, 
sponsored by the National Cancer Institute).
        But the EPA may not get away with its lies. The U.S. District Court 
for North Carolina recently ruled in Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative vs. EPA 
that the plaintiffs could proceed with a court challenge to the EPA's 
designation of "secondhand" cigarette smoke as a known carcinogen. Plaintiffs 
argue the EPA lacks statutory authority to issue that designation. Moreover, 
it's based on EPA data manipulation it knows to be false. The EPA didn't 
challenge Flue-Cured's allegation of data manipulation. Instead, it tried to 
get the court to dismiss the suit on the grounds that federal law does not 
permit judicial review of federal designation of a product as carcinogenic. 
The court disagreed, saying it does have that right and because the EPA's 
declaration has led to banning of cigarette smoking in thousands of public and
private establishments, it is "ripe" for review.
        That's why Hitler in Germany, the parliament in apartheid South Africa
and tyrants elsewhere hate judicial review of legislative or quasi-legislative
acts. And so do Browner, Kessler and Waxman.
        Whether you hate smokers or not, Americans must reject bogus science 
and attacks on the principle of rule of law, personal liberty and private 
property as a means to achieve a "desirable" society. If we permit it against 
smokers, you can rest assured that somebody else with another vision will use 
the same Trojan Horse in pursuit of his objectives.

<a name="16">Subject: introduction</a>

Greetings and all that:

My name is Brian Tarleton, and I'm a 21-year old senior at Washington College
on Maryland's Eastern Shore.  I've been enjoying the pleasure that only a
fine cigar can offer for a few months now (about 4 or 5) and I've found a
habit that will stick with me for a lifetime.   It has been said so many
times, but I must echo it yet again--there is some quite relaxing in the
nature of the cigar and the pipe.  It cannot be rushed for there is a certain
pattern that we all go through before lighting up, and I for one only like to
smoke when I'm in a certain frame of mind, although smoking does go quite far
towards putting me there.

As for particular cigars that I prefer to smoke, I decided when I started
smoking that I would purchase the best that I could with the funds that I had
available.  While I have not been able to buy a lot of fine cigars at any one
time, I have not regretted that decision.  Currently I like to go for
Macanudo's, Aurto Fuento's, Partagas', with a Romeo y Julietta being my (so
far once) highest-end excursion.  If anyone can recommend something in this
range, I would be indebted.  

Finally, I have a request for the brotherhood of tobak that seems to be
assembled here.  I am beginning to look into purchasing a humidor so that I
can buy more that a few cigars at a time.  Currently, I have a zip-lock
baggie in an old cigar box, but I would dearly love to move a step or two up
to something nicer--and wooden.  I just got the Davidoff catalogue in the
mail, but $2,000 is a bit out of my range.  I am considering around $250 to
be my upper limit, so, if anyone who owns a humidor could let me know what
they think of their respective make/model, or if anyone has a suggestion; I
would forever be in their debt.  I have looked at the FAQ available, but that
seems to deal more with making ones own.  

Again, thank you for your time and now that I've used up enough bandwidth, I
must be going.  I look forward to following the Pipes Digest.  

Cheers.

Smoke Signal #6

?????@???.???.???

We are glad, I think, that you are returned safely to your seat in
front of your data terminal, Steve. Pipes Digest #164 was a good
one. I enjoyed the news from Taipei, from New Zealand, and from the
chap who said that the lost art of pipe-smoking is rising Phoenix-
like from the ashes. Not only that, but the lost art of letter
writing and of the personal essay is alive and well here in the
data-stream that is the Pipes Digest. We of the Company indulge in
the gentle art of correspondence. Although I am an electrical
engineer by trade, I aspire to the writer's life, my favourite
medium being the essay, short story, and, of course, the letter. My
literary friend of whom I spoke in #164 had this to say about E-
mail and the Internet: "It's going to change a lot, not only in
personal correspondence but in publishing. In fact, E-mail turns
the clock back to the pre-publishing industry, preprinting press
days when literature was simply handed about. And when you consider
that there was a literary life of considerable richness in those
days it may turn out to be a good thing in the end. Might as well
restore writing to its amateur status. I'll miss the book, though. . . ."
This notion is possible, but only in a moderated environment.
However, E-mail is ephemeral it doesn't have the permanence of
ink on paper.

Smokers of cigars and pipes are an unflappable bunch and I suspect
that many are users of a fountain pen as I am. Writing with one is
a relaxation. Sure the expensive Montblancs, Pelicans, and
Watermans are handsome instruments, but I use a $15 Osmiroid every
day to good effect. These smoke signals are brought to life with
pen and ink before being typed into WordPerfect for polishing and
transformation into the E-mail ephemeron. Pipe shapes are varied
and there is one called "Author" to suit the pipe-smoking writer.

Indeed, the Chinese are a nation of furious smokers, mainly of
cigarettes. When doing business or travelling in China, make sure
you have a carton or two of the Marlboro cigarettes in your
possession, they can be invaluable for easing the tension of a
meeting or as a way of helping the formation of a friendship. Let's
examine the business meeting: Just convened, the atmosphere is
uneasy. Naturally, you are inclined to reach for pipe or cigar.
Don't do it. Be polite. Reach for the pack of Marlboro, open it and
shake some cigs loose, so that they can be extracted easily. Stand
up and approach each of the Chinese delegates in turn. Hold the
pack in both hands at waist height. Face each delegate squarely and
offer the open end of the pack so that they can extract a
cigarette, do so with a slight bending of the body. By doing this
you are being extremely polite and will thaw any iciness in the
atmosphere of the meeting, even if some delegates do not smoke.
Have your lighter ready too. Once you have looked to your guests,
you can return to your seat and light your pipe or cigar. By the
way, offer cigarettes to your Chinese guests in order of rank or
age: highest rank or most elderly first. A colleague of mine was
making a presentation to the brass-hats of the Taiwan military and
deployed his few phrases of Mandarin we had learned at class here
in Tulsa. One two-star general was so impressed that he went to
fetch tea for my colleague, a singular honour. Lately, I have been
reading Dr. Li Zhisui's book "The Private Life of Chairman Mao." It
seems the Chairman burned out his lungs with British made 555
cigarettes.

Coltsfoot is a good substitute for tobacco according to Georges
Herment, recommended by Pliny as a sedative for a cough. Marjoram
is another herb smoked in the past. Perhaps we will be smoking
these again when we are forced to grow our own.

What of that trove of treasure? Twenty-four years ago my father-in-
law, Doctor Donovan, died. He was a pipe smoker and a collector. It
was not the smoke of his pipe that killed him but a stroke. He was
fifty-six years old. Often, on a Saturday, Doctor Donovan would
while away an afternoon in Ted Kanaley's pipe shop talking of this
and that. He and Ted got along well together. Doc had wide ranging
interests and, as I have said, he was a collector.

Within the last couple of months we buried my mother-in-law who
died of cancer of the liver, aged eighty and a half years. As
executrix, my wife had to dispose of her Mum's estate, which meant
clearing her Mum's apartment. Since Doc Donovan's death, my mother-
in-law had moved several times, ending her days in a small, one
bedroom apartment. We disposed of five or six hundred books, the
residue of a very large collection. We found, amongst the remains
of other collections, two large cardboard boxes, one containing the
good Doctor's pipes, the other his blocks of briar that he intended
to turn into smokeable pipes.

Counting and sorting the pipes, I found close to one hundred of
good quality and a couple of brochures. Doctor Donovan knew what he
was doing as most of these pipes were straight grained. There were:
Barling, Baron, Bewley, Castello, Charatan, Comoy, Dr. Plumb,
Dunhill, GBC, Hilson, Jobey, Jost, Kaywoodie, London Pipe Company,
M &amp; L, Sasieni, Savinelli, Ted's, Town Hall, Trocadero, WDC, and a
couple of dozen without pipe maker's mark. It took me a day or two
to get my bearings before I knew which way to turn. Also, there was
a broken meerschaum Calabash, and a carved meerschaum bowl that
looked like one I saw in Dunhill's "The Pipe Book."

Not all of the pipes appealed to me. Most had bowls of large size
that would give me a longer smoke than I like. I managed to choose
a dozen that took my fancy, sent a few to my nephew-in-law in
Minnesota, and gave a selection to my brother-in-law who should try
to wean himself from cigarettes; already his lungs sound like the
tail-end of a wet-smoking pipe. After this weeding, there were
fifty-nine remaining that I took to Mrs. Kanaley at Ted's Pipe
Shop, along with the forty-three sawn but undrilled blocks of
briar. Mrs. Kanaley said that seeing these pipes coming back
signalled the end of an era.

Ted Kanaley died of congestive heart failure a couple of years
after Doctor Donovan. Mrs. Kanaley told me that Ted was often asked
when he was going to retire. He replied that he was retired. People
would ask him: "What about the shop?" He would reply: "When I can't
get the key in the door, I guess I'll have to get someone to open
it for me. Ted was sixty-five when he died and he is remembered as
a happy man. As we see from the quotation of Lin Yutang in #164: "A
smoker may have dirtier fingernails, but that is no matter when his
heart is warm. . . And most important of all, a man with a pipe in
his mouth is always happy, and after all, happiness is the greatest
of all moral virtues."

Most of these pipes had vulcanite mouthpieces with oxidised
surfaces. Carl Ehwa Jr. in his "The Book of Pipes and Tobacco"
recommends baking soda used with a soft toothbrush to removed
oxidation. I imagine that this treatment, coupled with an olive oil
finish, would restore vulcanite to its original lustre.

Including the pipes, there were two pipe racks of no use to the
large collection. One was broken and looked as though it had been
a school wood-shop project. A two-tier rack holding seven pipes,
one for each day, and sporting three drawers for storage of
accessories, it is never-the-less a nice piece of furniture. I
restored it and hung it on the wall of my study. Less fancy was the
other rack, straight with a six-pipe capacity for the person of
religious mind disinclined to smoke on the Sabbath. I gave this one
to my brother-in-law.

One interesting pipe was a small bowl billiard with silver-ferrule
and inlaid into the bowl the intertwined letters ND, the silver
device identifying Notre Dame University where Doctor Donovan took
his degree in the 30s.

As I said, there were two brochures from twenty-five to thirty
years ago. We can look at these in my next puff when I will bring
before the Company Carl Ehwa's "The Book of Pipes and Tobacco," and
since it is out of print, I will quote from his problem solving
chapter. In addition we will talk about McClelland tobacco and note
the connection with Mr. Ehwa.

The Pipes Digest has been pinging into my mailbox for a few weeks now,
and I observe that there seems to be a tradition (and even that
happens faster these days - it once took a hundred or more years to
establish a tradition) for newcomers to contribute a sort of
nicotinophiliac biography and list of personal bigotries...

I think I shall keep mine short, for two very good reasons. First, Im
a writer by trade, and we generically hate writing stuff except for
money. Second, I am about to start work on a book in which tobacco is
a central theme, and I have a horror of talking out a story before its
on paper.  Enough to say it was sparked off by my discovering two
things in the space of a day. The first was the Tabakspfeife song in J
S Bachs Anna Magdalena Notebook (Im also a harpsichordist, and we
performed it as an encore recently -- curious that it popped up in the
last Digest); and the second was hearing that a man who recently
bought an old house in Germany to turn into a luxury brothel was
stripping back some of the panelling when he uncovered a 17th-century
manuscript book containing the diaries of an earlier Madame
interspersed with names of customers, price-lists and so on.

A pound of Dunhills Elizabethan Mixture for anyone who can deduce the
plot from those two first principles.  Hell, even _I_ am not yet sure,
and Im writing the thing...

Ho hum. Biographical stuff? I am forty years old and how horrible that
sounds.  The passage of time is one of Gods less successful little
jokes, but never mind; at least I cant complain Ive been unfairly
singled out... Been smoking a pipe since I was fifteen; I discovered a
packet of Condor Long Cut (a black and mephitic English lung-ripper
appropriately named after a bird which thrives on corpses) at the bus
station.  I stuck this in an old cough-sweet tin while I saved up for
a pipe. In around six weeks I had saved the 12/6d needed to buy a
billiard briar called Airborne, which was also just about the right
length of time for my tobacco to dry out to a gunpowder consistency.
I sat in the market square of my home town and filled this damned
pipe. The tobacco just turned to dust as I packed it in; I think I
rammed about half-an-ounce into the bowl altogether.  I didnt so much
light it as let it off, and then wandered round town, a
fifteen-year-old schoolboy, clouds of black smoke belching out of this
thing the size of a small wind instrument, and me wondering why
everyone was looking at me and deciding it was admiration at my
dashing and manly appearance.

I could only indulge myself with one hour of olympian vomiting in the
plush jakes of Griffin &amp; Spalding, the towns swishest department
store, before crawling off to my piano lesson.  It was ghastly.  I was
supposed to be playing the Richard Strauss Cello Sonata with a girl of
other-worldly beauty, now a celebrated soloist so well leave her name
out.  I desperately wanted to impress her with my virtuosity, in the
misguided and callow belief that shed think Merciful heavens, this
bugger can certainly rattle the old joanna-strings, perhaps I will
slip out of my clothes.

But it was not to be.  I managed the first three chords, then came
apart at the lungs, other viscera being subsequently embraced in my
general dissolution.  Fortunately, our teacher was German.  The
English, as their national malady, have A Bit Of A Cold.  The French
have the Liver Crisis. Americans, a spiritual people, have
disturbances of the psyche unless they can prove whiplash. But Germans
have something called The System, which is prone to Collapse. Mrs
Reiche rose to the occasion magnifcently. Dollink, said my teacher,
Your Zystem hes COLLEPSED. So, trink zis, and handed me a cup of cider
vinegar.  Then an encore of colaratura heaving in her bathroom before
I finally went home, apple-green and hooked for life.

So I suppose I have been smoking a pipe now for - it is horrible to
face this - a quarter of a century.  I think I can remember every pipe
I have owned, although many have mysteriously vanished, including, to
my sorrow, a Bavarian job in - unwittingly, I believe - the shape of a
toilet, complete with lid and chain.  I have about forty-odd pipes
now, mostly Dunhills, with a few by Peterson and Charatan, a few from
Astley of Jermyn Street, a couple of Ashtons and a couple of
Davidoffs.  I shant be buying any more Dunhills; the company is now
owned by some Japanese financiers and the quality is really not what
it was, financiers being what *they* are; they are far more interested
in selling rather disagreeable clothes (and I find it unsatisfactory
to buy my clothes from my tobacconist; Two ounces of London Mixture
and a tweed jacket, please? I think not.) But some of my Dunhills are
real treasures, particularly a glorious Hungarian which holds about an
ounce of tobacco and looks like a gnarled and beastly scrotum, a
silver-spigot bent bulldog, and a square-sided billiard (traditionally
the preferred shape of British Jesuits, for some reason). I also have
a few meerschaums, the prize being a 19th century one in a simple
Dublin shape which was given to me by an old girlfriend who found it,
new and unsmoked, still in its original box.  I suppose that makes it
a collectors item, but to hell with that; it is now smoke-bronzed and
well-loved.

Everyone has their own opinion about the best pipemakers.  My money is
on Ashton and Astley, the latter being still a private business with
just one small but extraordinary shop in Londons St Jamess.  They do
pipes to order, and made me a splendid straight-grain cutty which is
another prized pipe.  When I finish my current book -- about my
travels around the Australian outback in a Cessna 182, accompanied
only by four pounds of Royal Yacht tobacco and a little reproduction
of the first pipe Dunhill ever made (another collectors item which I
have smoked rather than collected - and incidentally it does _not_
have the famous White Spot, which was a later invention) -- my reward
to myself will be a silver-capped square-shank Dublin from Astley in
grade A straight-grain Algerian briar.

Tobacco... oh, tobacco.  The ones I remember fondly have all vanished
or changed.  The paradisiac Sobranie Flake, Exmoor Hunt, No-Name, John
Cotton, Benson &amp; Hedges Special Cut Plug, Barling Royal Hunt and, of
course, Babys Bottom (Smooth as a..., you see, but of course you
couldnt call it that now, anyway; and why isnt there one called
Politicians Tongue, I wonder?) no longer exist.  McConnells and
Rattrays are no longer made by their original blenders and have
changed their character utterly and for the worse (gosh, I remember
Red Raparee when it _was_ Red Raparee; now its just _called_ Red
Raparee) as have the Four Square blends.  Clan has lost its character
and its bite; Troost is no longer made in Holland, since the factory
burned down (hundreds of people gathered round to inhale from the
conflagration) and is no longer worth buying.  And now Copes Escudo
seems to have disappeared forever, at least on this side of the
Atlantic.

There are a few new blends which I welcome with open arms.  The
Larsens #32 and #50 are masterpieces; some of the newer Amphora blends
have what it takes, particularly the Cesare Borgia (though what a
silly name!) and I have just found something called Nappa Valley,
another Danish tobacco flavoured with Cabernet Sauvignon added.  But
mostly its the tried-and-true favourites for me: Royal Yacht as a
day-in, day-out smoke; Dunhills Elizabethan, Nightcap or Three Nuns
for evening smoking, with the spiced piquancy of prique; Balkan
Sobranie or one of the Dunhill latakia mixtures with a cup of Lapsang
Souchong tea when I want to go into a trance of absolute relaxation (I
find the flavours complementary); and a plain virginia flake - my
local tobacconists own, or Dunhills if Im away - for plain virginia
days.

Well now.  Thats quite enough.  I said Id keep it short, but havent.
Logorrhoea is the curse of my trade.  Smoke, as they say, in peace.
And one final thought: I have it on police authority that the best
thing you can do if brought in for questioning is pull out your
pipe. Police experience apparently suggests that criminals are never
pipe-smokers, and therefore (by false but perhaps useful logic) they
assume that pipe-smokers are never criminals.

[ I must admit to mystification, but I'll give it a shot... Here I'll
take some editorial privilege and try for the baccy first. 

Some time after its discovery, the diary is stolen and its owner
murdered. Our Hero: Inspector Calabash. Clue at the scene of the
crime, perhaps clutched in the owner's overly-melodramatic fist: a
color photographic copy of the Tabakspfeife song, in original
manuscript, definitely in Bach's hand, and dated earlier than any
previously known version.

It turns out that the original from which the copy was made had been
glued inside the binding of the diary. The current owner had found it,
and tried to sell it. He had talked to the wrong people.

Inspector Calabash discovers that Bach was, in his youth, a patron of
the Madame's establishment (I know this is an anachronism, but let's
rewrite history a little here :-), under an assumed name. He sometimes
paid the Madame with now-unknown pieces for harpsichord, in lieu of
cash. The Madame had hiden these away, too -- not in the same
house. They would be priceless if they could be found. The diary gives
a clue to their whereabouts.

Inspector Calabash races the murderer to the place of concealment --
presently also a house of ill repute. A struggle ensues, etc...

BTW, can I claim the pound of Elizabethian if I at least come up with
a _good_ story line? :-) -S. ]

away from home--that is, when I attended the Summer School for Designing
Society (courtesy of the Performers' Workshop Ensemble at the U of I in
Urbana) I practically lived in the shop...As part of an assignment in
observation, I was asked to observe a place, any place (heh, heh) for three

   The nicest thing about this shop's location in South Dakota is it's lack
of a state tobacco tax (*please* correct me if I'm wrong!)  They also have a
really nice brochure which lists all of the items they sell (right down to
each brand of pipe-cleaners they carry!)  I think the last time I counted,
there were 122 cigar brands listed.  They also carry certain commercial/high
grade tobaccos in bulk, such as Captain Black (aka "Ed's Delicado") and
Dunhill's Early Morning Pipe (aka "10 Downing Street")
   If anyone *does* decide to give Eastwold a call (it's an 800 number after
all) please tell them you heard about it from "that guy who used to take all
those notes in your shop last summer"  I think they'll enjoy it!
  Ask to talk to Gene, Lee, or Paul and they'll be glad to help you out!

Hello friends,

I recently smoked a good tobacco called "DANISH Truffel". It was in a
metal box with light (white) colours. My friend who let me try this
got it from somewhere in the csech republic. Can anyone tell me where
I can get it in Austria (preferred in Vienna) or in Bavaria (Bayern,
Germany) as I am also sometimes in Salzburg or close to this place.

Any help appreciated.

Greetings,

Hi all pipe smokers!

I'm so pleased to join in this group.

I live in Finland ( in Scandinavia, Northern Europe). We have here
maybe the srictest laws in Europe concerning smoking.

I'm a professor in the University of Tampere and when I feel that the
moment for pipe has come I must exit my room and go out (maybe -30
centigrades) for a puff. So that's how it goes.

I smoke mainly Italian (Savinelli), Irish (Peterson) and Danish (Royal 
Danish) pipes.

What's your opinion about Italian pipes? I'm extremely interested to
know your experiences about Savinelli (f.ex.model: "Rome") system
pipes, which use a small balsa-wood-stick as a filter in the stem.

Personally I find them quite pleasing; easy to smoke, the condense
evaporates in balsa, and puffs come in "loud and clear".

I've been smoking Amphora Regular (the one in brown pouch) for a
couple of years.  This is another question I will put to you,
fellow-pipesmokers: Can you recommend a milder blend (I mean less
nicothine), but one that has equal class of tobacco and smoking
quality?

That's for a start. I look forward to communicate about these nice
things we all like so much.

        Yours
        Antti Kalliokoski ( in Finland, Europe) 

[ Welcome, Antti! Sounds like the Finnish law is even worse than the
US ones. -S. ]

Steve,

Have now figured out how to use Delphi's version of an interface, but it still
cuts of messages before they reach their end.  AOL looks like it is the safer
bet right now until I find the answer.  I am trying out NETCOM.COM in the
meantime with the name SBWYMAN.

I went to the WWW and looked at the resources guide.  I would like to add a
couple of items to the guide.

Mass Holiday Inn.  The group is about 20 or so in number.  The hotel now gives
us a private room, we order off the menu (seperate checks) and have a good
time discussing pipes, pipe shows, tobaccos we cannot get anymore and the

best bargain in town.

Smoke in peace.

<a name="2">Subject: Pipe Digest entry - Daniel Pinkwater's NPR essay (long)</a>

Hello again, everyone.

	Well, as promised, here's the Daniel Pinkwater essay which 
aired on NPR recently.  Mr. Pinkwater has my apologies for any 
mistakes I may have made in transcribing the essay.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Here is the first joke I ever heard:  Hey, sonnye, you like 
music?"   I would deliver the correct response, stiffling giggles.  
"Yes, I like music."  "Vell, here's a band."  Whereupon I would be 
presented with a paper ring, printed in gold and gaudy colors 
bearing the legend `El Producto' or `Garcia y Vega'.  All my uncles 
and my father knew this joke;  they never got tired of it, and 
neither did I.

	When the menfolk gathered, they would savor cigars in 
candela wrappers and drink whiskey out of tiny glasses with gold 
rims, leaning back in their chairs around the dining room table, 
luxuriating after a family meal.

	They might play a spirited game of pinochle while I lolled 
on the carpet in the living room with the other children admiring 
our cigar bands and listening to fibber McGee and Molly, The 
Shadow, or The First Nighter on teh big floor-model radio.  The 
aunts and my mother would knit, chat, and shout good-natured 
comments back and forth with the card players.

	These men had survived the hardships and privations of the 
immigrant experience, worked hard, and now were able to sit at a 
bought-and-paid-for table in the bosom of their family, survey 
their achievements, enjoy a hand of cards, a good cigar, a glass of 
schnapps, and maybe a (piece of fruit?).  The rewards of 
citizenship in a democracy.  At some point in the evening, 
invariably one uncle or another would stretch and hook his thumbs 
in his waistband and sigh "Ahhh...America!"

	With so many of my happy childhood memories fragrant 
with cigar smoke, and my little personal treasures redolent of 
Havana, for being kept in cigar boxes, it was inevitable that I 
would turn to the leaf when the time came.

	That time came only this year.  I had stunk up my environs 
with pipes for most of my adult life, and some time ago I quit.  I 
thought I was perhaps puffing a bit too much, and anticipating 
possible trouble, I boxed up my beloved Briers, tossed out the last 
of the Balkan Sobranie mixture, and went cold turkey.

	Kicking was no problem for a Schtarker like myself.  After 
buying out the candy counter, and consuming every sort of mint, 
caramel, sour ball, and chewing gum for a week, the nicotine devil 
was out of my body.  Of course, I was unable to work, sleep, or 
think for weeks and weeks, I growled at my wife, was plagued by 
morbid thoughts, and spent hours drumming with my fingers on 
the desktop and staring into space, but I was not going to go back 
to the pipe.  I had sworn off, and a swear is a swear!

	Fortune decreed that a brochure should arrive in the mail.  
It was from a discount cigar company.  There were pictures of the 
various products - remarkably the same.  A cylinder rounded on 
one end.  How do you take a good picture of a cigar?  It's a cigar!    
But the copy!  The copy was hypnotic.  All about Honduran and 
Jamaican and Dominican leaf and creamy brown wrappers of 
Connecticut shade-grown.  Maduro cigars, black as coffee;  Green 
Claros, and all sorts of cigars, just as good as Cuban, or grown 
from seeds smuggled out of Cuba, or made by cigar makers who 
had learned their trade in Havana.  And these things were rare and 
expensive!  I never knew there were cigars that go for eight or nine 
dollars a smoke!!!

	I swore off pipes...I didn't swear anything about cigars.  
Besides, I read somewhere that while pipes were less threatening 
to health than cigarettes, cigars are less dangerous yet!  They're 
practically good for you.

	The cigars arrived, and I've been smoking one or two each 
evening.  I wasn't sure I liked them at first, but now I'm sure.  My 
hand is stead, my eye is clear.  I am able to work again.  I dont 
have desperate thoughts.  So what if when I come into my office in 
the morning, it smells like old jewish men hae been playing cards 
there all night?  So what if I have to gargle mouthwash before I 
can kiss my wife?  So what if, besides looking like my father, I 
now smell like him too?  I am now myself again, and I did not go 
back to that vile pipesmoking habit.

			Daniel Pinkwater, November 1994.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

	The part of this essay which first caught my attention was
his joke about "You like music?"  My own grandfather used to tell me
that joke when he was a cigar-smoker, and it really took me back.  
(As an aside, I might add that it was a sheer joy to tell this joke
myself upon the occasion of smoking my own first cigar.)

	Pinkwater addresses the occasion of his pipe-smoking 
debut in an essay in his book "Fish Whistle".  You might be 
interested in checking it out.

	I also appreciated the fact that Pinkwater treats smoking as 
more than simply some "social disease", which has been 
practically the only way that the media currently refers to it 
anymore.  For Pinkwater, smoking isn't simply some bad habit, but 
a time-honored family tradition.

	Oh, well, just my thoughts.  I suppose I ought to try to 
catch up on the last issue of Pipe Digest, which is languishing on 
my hard drive.  Until later...

Peter Kukla

[ Thanks for the transcription, Peter! Any guesses whose catalog he
got? First clue: the first two initials are the same as
Tolkien's... :-) I vehemently disagree with what Mr. Pinkwater has to
say about pipes, of course... but it sounds like he had a habit, not a
hobby. Of course, I know where he could get rid of that unwanted
leftover Sobranie... :-) -S. ]

Pretty good try at deducing my plot... you were quite right about J S Bach 
turning up in the whorehouse... but it's rather more complex than that and 
there's no detective.

As they say: close, but no cigar.

But next time I need a plot in a hurry, I'll call on your
services. Personally, I find them a burden.

Still, there's good news.  Just discovered a pound of Benson's Special
Cut Plug in a Midlands tobacconist.  God's Own Smoke, now
discontinued, so that's a little ray of sunshine.

&gt; What's your opinion about Italian pipes? I'm extremely interested to
&gt; know your experiences about Savinelli (f.ex.model: "Rome") system
&gt; pipes, which use a small balsa-wood-stick as a filter in the stem.

I have some Savinelli pipes and like them! (As far as I know is "Rome"
not a model but a sub-company of Savinelli. They produce pipes under
Savinelli license.)

&gt; Personally I find them quite pleasing; easy to smoke, the condense
&gt; evaporates in balsa, and puffs come in "loud and clear".

I like the balsa filter system! I tried several others (e.g. Vauen)
and finally prefer the Savinelli system. But this depends heavily on
where you are (air conditions are different in a mountain area like
Austria vs. sea climate like Italy). For me I agree that the taste is
not influenced by the balsa filter. In the German magazine "PIPE CLUB"
will be an "evaluation" of filter systems in the next issue. I am waiting
for this and give you additional hints after (if you want...)

&gt; I've been smoking Amphora Regular (the one in brown pouch) for a
&gt; couple of years.  This is another question I will put to you,
&gt; fellow-pipesmokers: Can you recommend a milder blend (I mean less
&gt; nicothine), but one that has equal class of tobacco and smoking
&gt; quality?

Up to now I have not smoked Amphora. I know a friend who smokes this. From
the room flavor (the arome you smell in the room) I think the Borkum Riff
could be close to this. Borkum Riff is available in Ultra Light, too. The
Borkum Riff "regular" is Whiskey flavoured. Another sort is with Cherry.

Hope this was of some help.

<a name="5">Subject: Picking a perfect pipe</a>

My cousin just purchased his first pipe and wrote for some suggestions on 
picking out his best buy.  What follows is some of my response.  
Hopefully it will provide other newbies some information that will help 
them make a wise purchase.  The names have been changed to protect the 
innocent.
/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
Have you ever heard of the brand name X?  I saw a couple of these pipes 
at Low Joe's.  (a cheap tobacco shop here)  The prices range from $15-20. 
 One pipe was meerschaum lined.  Do you think they sound a little too 
cheap?  They seemed to be alright appearance wise.
++++++++++++++
More potential pipe smokers have been lost because they started w/ a poor 
pipe so let's instead talk about what makes one pipe better or worse than 
another.  The first is cheap materials.  Plastic is cheap.  Corncobs are 
too, but they can absorb moisture and are disposable.  Briar is a hard 
wood that dissipates heat well by allowing a carbon cake to build up on 
the bowl and transfer heat to the wood around it.  Other woods are also 
used, but are not as common.  Meerschaum is also a good conductor of heat 
but doesn't burn like wood so a carbon cake never builds up. It simply 
isn't needed.  That's the the Yugo, Chevy, Cadillac hierarchy of 
materials.

Perfect materials are expensive so pipe makers patch.  Meerschaum isn't 
patched but are graded by color and quality of the stone.  Briar can be 
filled w/ putty.  IMO, it doesn't change the quality of the smoke, but 
fills can color differently than the wood as it ages.  Fills in the heel 
[where the stem joins the bowl] get hot so I try to avoid them.  Plastic 
is poured as perfect so patching isn't a problem.

The other sign of workmanship is that the bottom of the draw hole exactly 
meets the bottom of the bowl.  This way all the tobak is smoked and acts 
as a filter where all the components can be burned.  Cheap pipes are made 
w/ larger draw holes followed by condensers to compensate.  They also can 
have filters to complete the job the tobak should be doing.  After a 
couple of draws the filter becomes saturated, and then worthless.

True cono-sewers like meerschaum.  It ages gracefully, smokes well, and 
can have a rare shape.  They also are fragile, and the wax coating can be 
discolored when handled improperly.  The briar is more rugged and are 
more traditional.  They also tend to be in standard shapes.  Meerschaum 
lined pipes are an attempt to combine the best of both worlds.  The only 
problem w/ this compromise occurs when the lining cracks.  The powder 
created can be inhaled and is HIGHLY irritating.  The pipe should be 
discarded if this happens.

With all this in mind, let's get back to the original question.  What are 
you getting for your money?  [Rep pipe shop] probably carries seconds in 
that same price range that are all briar.  If you're lucky, they also 
carry cheap meerschaum's in that range too.  And if you don't find what 
you want, ask.  I have found pipe smokers to go out of their way to help 
another out.  Compare that seconds w/ the X from Low Joe's. or where 
ever.  My personal opinion is that you will get MUCH more pipe for you 
money from a reputable pipe shop than the discount shop.  

And as far as bulk tobak, the name may be different at the discount 
place, but it's probably the same blend at the wholesaler.

Steve:
Thanks for the first issue. Thank you, also, for adding Bloom's Cigar Camp to
your resource guide and for including the bit about the calendar. While I do
not have any ownership in Bloom's, I do try to go there every Saturday for
Camp and every last Tuesday of the month for Cigar Camp Dinner at Davio's
restaurant. It is a great place to meet and smoke. This past Saturday was
"Biker" day. About 50 or so members of the Harley Davidson Owners Group
descended "en mass" and the place was really jumping. The small streets
surrounding the store were packed with big Harleys. Penn Brewery, a micro
brewery and tavern where I go to smoke cigars and listen to Dixieland Jazz,
donated 2 barrels of their fine beer. The ladies decided that a Casa Blanca
Jeraboam (66 gauge by about 16") was the appropriate smoke. ;)

Anyway, I thought I would include my bio. Here it is.

I smoked cigarettes for 25 years until July 25th of this year. I had tried
pipes and cigars in the past but they must not have been the good ones. I
never inhaled them and they never gave me the satisfaction I got from a
cigarette. In fact, after a cigar, I would always smoke a cigarette for the
inhale and the nicotine, right up until July 25.
A year and a half ago, my wife held a surprise 40th birthday for me at my
good friend's home. He is a Doctor and smoked pipes, then cigars. Near the
end of the night, he gave out a bunch of cigars. I smoked a Cuban Romeo y
Julieta Churchill. WOW. It was like my first great, aged bottle of Bordeaux
(hence my online name of Wine Boss, but that's another story). I saw what a
great cigar could be like. 
It wasn't until Christmas time when another cigar smoking friend gave me a
5-pak of Macanudo cigars that I actually had enough cigars at the same time
to plan the time when I would try them. From then on, I was hooked. I spent
many months trying many different cigars. I bought Por Laranagas (very mild),
and Griffens (medium and nice), Zino Mouton Cadet #1 (more flavorful), and
every other brand at least once. Temple Halls were an early favorite.
However, like many new cigar smokers, I was moving to stronger tasting
cigars.
The Cubans, when I could get them, always seemed to be stronger and more
flavorful. I still hold that opinion. But I have looked for those non-Cuban
cigars that are most "Cuban-like". Also, I would rather spend 2 bucks on a
cigar than 10. 

In May of this year, my wife and I went to London, Bordeaux (there's that
word again) and Paris for our 10th wedding anniversary. We had honeymooned in
Paris in '84. CUBA HEAVEN!!! The Londoners were the most friendly people I
have met. At Dunhill's, my first cigar after the flight and a short nap was a
Cohiba Robusto! Talk about relaxation. The chap in the humidor room took my
picture with it in front of the Cohiba cabinet. My wife made the picture into
a mouse pad. I'm looking at it now. Boy, do I look like I'm having fun! At
Davidoff, the owner, Edward Sahakian, took Paulette's (my wife) and my
picture and then we got him in the photos with each of us. He GAVE us 7 Cuban
Davidoff cigars before we left. That has to be over $100.00 worth of cigars.
And they aren't replenishable, either! What great people! (By the way, the
Davidoff's were magnificent. I still have some that Edward gave us and some I
bought from Desmond Sautter's store.) In France, I smoked 99% Cuban cigars.
Every one was more flavorful than the Dominicans I liked. Tried a Griffen
that I had bought a box of back here and I couldn't taste much.

But one must be reasonable in Embargoland. I have since tried Henry Clay
Breva Fina's. At 2.10 a piece, this cigar is a bargain. It looks a little
weird but it tastes great. I find it stronger than most Dominicans but
without a bite. It has become my every-day cigar. I also like Santa Rosa,
Encanto, and the new Leon Jimenes Robustos. I still buy almost all of the
different brands at some time to keep the tastes new.

I quit cigarettes with the help of the patch and cigars. I only needed the
patch for about 3.5 weeks (half normal time) and I do NOT inhale cigars. I
had never tried to quit before. I found it to be one of the easiest things I
had ever done. I don't know why, because I am overweight and have trouble
controlling that, but if I can do it, anyone can. Now I smoke cigars
(although not at home) and I figure I just made myself much healthier. I own
my own business selling computer cables, connectors, adapters, wire, LAN
products and installations, and I can smoke in my office since I own the old
brick train station we are in. I do use an exhaust fan so my employees don't
have to smell it but I'm free to smoke anywhere but home. My wife smokes a
small cigar about 5 times a year and I agree that the house would begin to
smell too much over a long period of time (got to set up a room with fan!!!).

So, sorry if I bored you. Hope to "see" you all more often in the future and
I am looking forward to getting the next issue. Keep talking about pipes
because I'm getting interested in trying one again. Maybe I'll borrow my
friend's Dunhill. Ha. Well, he doesn't smoke them much anymore, anyway. We'll
see.

Keep up the good work and thanks for the interest.

Thanks for the information that others have not had trouble.  I do have a
message into the sysop.  I will let you know what. if anthing, he says.

In the meantime, I appreciate the suggestion that I spur the discussion by
starting it.  I'll give some though to what might be interesting, although it
seems that the group is bipolar, with a large number of new pipesters, and a
large number of old hands.  Some of the people I have been talking to lately,
and it is influencing my questions, are real old hands, and fanatics.  At the
SHPC most mebers, not myself, onfess to having collections of 350-600 pipes.
They come to meetings with ten to twelve pipes to show off, of one shape, e.g.
 bulldogs.  You may recall the piece from a couple of weeks ago about the
meeting with Butera pipes, priced at $250-600. I suspect most of our newsgroup
is not interested in such things, or can, like me, only dream about having
such collections.  IS this conspicuous consumption or an addiction gone bad?

In the meantime, I think I will go clean one of my Upshall seconds, and relax
and wait for an answer from Delphi.

Thanks for the time and efforts.

I know it might be a bit far for *some* of you, but...

The monthly meeting of the Greater (San Francisco) Bay Area Pipe Club
will be meeting next Sunday at 2pm.  Show up, and you're a member!  We
meet on the third Sunday of each month at Schmidt's Pub, 142 Solano
Avenue, Albany CA.  A good time rarely so inexpensive.  Lots of tobacco
and pipe lore, trading is often fast and furious, much gorgeous briar to
see and touch, and fine cameraderie to boot!  (Add to that the decent
selection of micro-brewery beers, plus a few tasty draughts from
England, and you've got a nice way to spend an afternoon! ;)

So, if you're planning a soujourn to California (or you just happen to
live nearby...) come on by!  I know at least one other net fellow will be
there!

Cheers,

INTERESTED IN JOINING A CIGAR CLUB?

Several months ago, a small group of us cigar smokers got together to
enjoy single malt scotch and cigars. We thought it would be an excellent
idea to do this throughout the year and invite others to join us.
Hopefully, it will blossom into a club that will feature different cigars,
foods and spirits with special guests and speakers.

As a first step in building membership for the club, we would like to
develop a list of cigar enthusiasts who would like to join us. We ask that
you fill out the bottom portion of this flyer and send it to us. Upon
receipt, we will forward information regarding the club to you.

We look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

or to sell you cigars.  It is to be designed by those of us who
are interested in a good time, good food and conversation.

If you are interested, please take a moment to answer a few questions
so that I may collect some information to the end that we may create
this group to serve its members.  I was going to make it multiple
choice
but I will just tally what you write.

1. Indicate the frequency with which you would attend such a gathering:
2. Indicate your preference of the time and day for such a gathering:
3. How much time would you spend at such a gathering:
4. Where would you like to see this gathering:
5. What kind of facility would you like to gather at:

I will collect and compile this information and then distribute it

Pipes Digest #165 brought me a laugh with Condor Old Lung Ripper
induced coloratura vomiting, lurid and very entertaining, reminding
me of Spike Milligan's fictional Agony Shag. Last time I had some
good laughs like this was while reading John Blofeld's book "City
of Lingering Splendour." He is very observant and has a good ear
for dialogue.

Baby's Bottom tobacco I last saw in what I remember as a one ounce
tin with a powder-blue lid, on the shelf of a tobacconist's shop in
the Fratton Road, Portsmouth, England. Lying dormant in my memory,
this name resurfaced with a beer I brewed once and christened
"Bottom Burp Bitter."

Smoking, health, surveys, and statistics were a topic in #165,
concerning the manipulation of the statistics to support a complete
ban on the pastime, and the relegation of nicotine to the list of
proscribed addictive substances. In the 15 October 1994 edition of
the New Scientist, Phyllida Brown reported the completion of a
forty-year study of smoking among male British doctors. Full
results of this study appeared in the British Medical Journal the
same week. Most central libraries in the United States will have a
copy of the BMJ.

Richard Doll started the study after he and Austin Hill showed in
1950 that people with lung cancer were more likely to be smokers.
"The researchers asked all the registered doctors in Britain about
their smoking habits. Of the 40,000 replies, more than 34,000 were
from men so the study was restricted to them. The men's ages ranged
from their twenties to near retirement age. An analysis of the data
in 1971 showed that about 10,000 had died; by 1991 roughly another
10,000 had died."

"The team analysed the causes of death according to whether the
doctors smoked or not, whether they smoked cigarettes, pipe, or
cigars, how many cigarettes they smoked daily, and whether and when
they had given up." Apparently, the study confirms that smoking
increases the chances of developing twenty-four fatal conditions
including cancers, heart disease, strokes, and bronchitis. Also, it
showed that moderate drinking can be good for you, finding that the
death rate among middle-aged and elderly men who had one or two
drinks per day was one sixth lower than for non-drinkers.

With the New Scientist article there was a chart showing the
percentage alive against age for those who smoked one to fourteen
cigarettes per day, fifteen to twenty-four per day, twenty-five or
more per day, and for those who never smoked regularly. At the LD50
point on the graph, at which fifty percent of the sample population
had died, the difference in age at death between those who smoked
twenty-five or more cigarettes per day and those who never smoked
regularly was seventy years and eighty years respectively. It would
be worth looking up the BMJ at the library to see how pipe and
cigar smokers fared in the study.

This week past, I noted a small but significant change in attitude
towards smokers of the pipe. As I was discarding the just arrived
catalogue of J. Crew &amp; Company, I noticed the happy family pictured
on the front cover and the Canadian Briar clenched at a rakish
angle between the teeth of the male model, it was unlit.

In #165, logorrhea was attributed to writers as an occupational
disease. It is easy to get carried away when writing, but then it
is always better to overwrite and then cut back. In these smoke
signals I try to limit myself to no more than three pages of the
word-processor, and already I am half way down the third page now.
Let's press on and take a look at those brochures I promised last
time.

Best British Briar Company had twenty-nine shapes available in
three finishes: Virgin, Sterling Silver, and Thorneycroft. Here is
the advertising hyperbole for the Virgin finish.

Virgin, Stock No.P90000: "Because the most particular pipe smokers
in the world like their pipes in natural Briar Colour, the finest
Rock-Hard specimen grain bowls are used for the BBB Own Make
Virgin. They break in like a dream. As you smoke your most
perfectly made pipe, it begins to colour, finally turning from pale
blond to tawny golden russet; the pride and joy of the pipe
connoisseur. Years of slow growth have made Corsican briar the
finest in the world. Months of special aging and curing have
mellowed the briar to the peak of smoking perfection, and hours
upon hours of superb English Craftsmanship have done their part in
creating the world's most perfect pipe. The splendid joy of smoking
a BBB Own Make Virgin will last for years and years. Each pipe is
superbly fitted with a mouthpiece of finest English Ebonite which
bears the famous BBB inlaid metal emblem. Beautifully packed in a
superb English luxury pipe glove and red label gift box."

My Dublin from Peterson's Emerald line, shape 268, was pale blond
when young. It has what BBB call a Virgin finish. Now, it is auburn
with dark-figured grain. When I bought this pipe, there were
several others that I inspected and rejected because of noticeable
filling of pits, this one is perfect to my eye. While not a
straight grained briar, it is endowed with attractive birdseye
grain fore and aft with slanted straight grain on the sides.

Doctor Donovan had an unsmoked pipe made out of "Selected English
Straight Grain" and of Lovat shape; straight grain all round,
birdseye top and bottom. It has no pipemaker's mark, but it's shank
is stamped with: "Made in London, England  016". Dressed with a
lacquer, this pipe was pale blond in the beginning and is now about
half way through its metamorphosis at light russet.

BBB's Sterling Silver Own Make had a walnut finished bowl and a
silver ferrule reinforced mortise and tenon joint. Thorneycroft was
a finish described as being made through "the special process of
sand erosion," and probably named after Sir John Isaac Thorneycroft
who established a shipbuilding empire at Chiswick, later removing
to Woolston, Southampton, England when the business outgrew their
original yards. BBB pipes ranged in price from a low $6.95 to a
high $25.

Brigham Pipes Ltd. had a brochure advertising thirty-six shapes of
briar plus five limited editions. Brigham have been in business
since 1906. Their prices ranged from $9.95 to $65 for a straight
grain. When the brochure was printed, they were located at 121 King
Street, West Toronto, Canada, and had a telephone number of 368-
7615. In addition to pipes of briar they sold a number of
accessories including a glass bowled Hookah Water Pipe with one or
two hoses. Brigham offered tips for the new smoker.

"Tips for the New Pipe Smoker: The choice of your first pipe can
well make the difference between success and failure. Select a
light-weight pipe with a fairly small inside diameter in the best
quality you can afford. For the first few smokes only half-fill
your pipe until a protective layer of carbon is formed in the
bottom. Puff s-l-o-w-l-y, but smoke it right to the bottom. Keep
the thickness of carbon to about 1/16 inch with a proper reamer. Do
not use a knife. Commence smoking when you are relaxed. Using a
mild to medium strength tobacco, pack the bowl firmly yet loosely
enough to draw comfortably. Light evenly, drawing hard at first.
Then puff GENTLY. Hold the bowl of your pipe in your hand, and if
the outside becomes uncomfortably warm lay it aside to cool. The
pipe should be cleaned out after every smoke and occasionally set
aside with the stem up to rest and dry out. To allow for this, an
average smoker should have a minimum of four pipes."

Naturally, opinions differ as to how one should approach the
management of one's smoking equipment. Fit a curve through the
multitude of opinions and do what works for you. Herment says hang
your pipes by their bowls, I choose to rack mine with the bowls
down; Brigham says scrape the bowl with a pipe reamer, I choose to
use a pipe-knife.

Well, we got blown off onto another tack, but in my next puff we
will get back on course and look at Carl Ehwa's "The Book of Pipes
and Tobacco" as well as McClelland tobacco.

Dear afficionados,
A couple of weeks ago I subscribed to a Dutch list dedicated to
cigar smoking. As an extra service, the members of this cigar
list were put on the distribution list of the Pipes Digest. This
turned out to be a good move: I've received four issues of the
digest now, and read them with great pleasure.
Even though I am somewhat of a 'side subscriber' I'd like to
introduce myself to the readers of the digest. I'm a 44-year old
desk-editor at Elsevier Science in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
My smoking career started when I was about 14 - my dad would
offer me a cigarette, and say 'Why don't you try one?' He smoked
Golden Fiction, a virginia blend, which gave him a nasty cough.
On Thursday evenings, my uncle, a grocer, would bring the week's
shopping. His standard joke was: 'Would you like to smoke? Then
set your coat on fire!' Sometimes he got a cigar from one of his
customers, which he then gave to me; a real challenge. I tried
a lot of different cigarette brands, shag tobacco and cigars, but
I could never find the right taste. 
Still, smoking remained an interesting ritual, and I tried other
ways of consuming tobacco.
My grandfather used to smoke cheap cigars, and when he had
reached the band, he would put the stub in his pipe and finish
it completely. I was duly impressed by his thriftiness, but when
I tried this trick myself, I found the experience dreadful. So
I tried real pipe tobacco, various sorts, but always in cheap
pipes. I tasted all sorts of mixtures, but to my disappointment
I discovered that a sweet-smelling tobacco did not necessarily
imply a sweet smoke... It never gave me the satisfaction I craved
for. I stumbled on for a couple of years, and in the end only
smoked on rare occasions. The digest has changed this, it has
given me an urge to try pipe smoking once again - and this time
it's for real!
I have a Falcon pipe that I bought 10 years ago, with a metal
stem and so-called 'dry rings' that give you a clean smoke.
Somehow, to me this isn't a 'real' pipe, so last week I set out
to buy a better one. I had a special type in mind, the bulldog,
with a plain finish and a straigh stem. After a careful selection
procedure I bought a Peterson, which I am now breaking in. 
I smoke MacBaren's Golden blend, but my real love is the Dunhill
standard mixture, medium. I remember smoking this in Syria, where
I was working on an archeological excavation near a small
village. I was sitting in front of the clay house where we
stayed. The night was clear, and there was a beautiful starry
sky. The evening temperature was pleasant, there was no wind, and
in dead silence the smoke coiled straight up to heaven.
Pipe smoking to me means peace and reflection. I can only smoke
when I am relaxed and dedicated to my pipe. If only it would keep
on burning! That's an art I still have to master.
Smoke in peace!
Olaf Meesters

        Every now and then, we all have extremely good luck.  A
couple of weeks ago, I was browsing through an antique shop, not
really looking for anything in particular.  I came upon a box of old
pipes.  I flipped through them quickly, as they were mainly
drugstore-like cheapies.  Suddenly, I noticed that unique bit design.
My hopes grew as I fished it out of the box.  Imagine my delight to
find that it was an old Peterson, and in fairly good shape.  I don't
know much about Petersons, as I can hardly afford them, so if anyone
has any information to share I would be glad.  The model I have, as
marked on the bottom, is a "Dunmore" and it is stamped 78.  Anybody
know anything about these?
        I took it to the neighborhood tobacconist to get it
rejuvanated and freshened up.  From the moment I lit it, I knew it was
the best pipe I have.  I'm so pleased with my find.  (Oh, I paid about
$15 for it.  I'm almost certain that I came out ahead, but again I'm
not absolutey sure about the value.  The fact that I now have such a
good pipe makes it all worthwhile, regardless of the value.)
        Before I go, let me ask for further comment.  I'm thinking of
trying a clay pipe.  Anything I should know about these?

    Would anyone have any hints about removing oxidation from the stem
    of a brand new pipe? I recently made a rather considerable
    investment in a Savinelli, whose mouthpiece immediately
    discolored. A bit of vigorous polishing removed some of the
    discoloration, but it now lacks the luster which makes the sight
    of a newer pipe so appealing. Is there anything short of having it
    buffed on a machine that would do the trick? The local pipe shop
    lacks such a machine.

    Any recommendations would be most welcome!

    THX,

    John

[ I would think that a buffing wheel loaded with some jeweler's rouge
might do the trick... Follow with carnauba wax, on a different wheel. -S. ]

Dear Sir,
I thought I would write a little about myself.  I hope I am sending this
to the correct address.  If a am mistaken, please tell me where I should
send my postings.  

	My name is Scott Patten, and I am a freshman at Iowa State University.
My major is English, and I hope to teach at the college level someday. I
began smoking at an early age during the eigth grade.  At that time I smoked
cigaretts and an occasional cigar.  My favorite book at the time, and still
today is The Lord of the Rings by Tolkein.  Well, needless to say the thought
of a pipe was fascinating.  So I raided my dads old pipe collection, and took
my first bowl.  Ever since that I have found the pipe without hesiation
the best smoke.  The smoothness of a pipe and that taste slaughters cigaretts
as far as I am concerned.  I smoked on and off through high school and
eventually bought my own pipe.  I purchased it at our local tobacconist.
He said it ws a fine pipe, and not knowing too much I figured he was right.
The pipe is an Irish Second with a bent stem.  It is from this store that
I purchase my tobacco also.  He has sold me many blends.  There are originals,
and I have often wondered if the tobacco in canisters from England would be as 
good.  If someone could help me with this question, I would appreciate it.
I would also be interested in any infromation on how one should properly
smoke. I have smoked by instinct for years, not knowing how to properly
care for a pipe or how to pack it.  Any info would be appreicated.
Thanks for listening.

Steve,

I want to add an item to the Resource Guide.  The Tinder Box, in Santa
Monica, CA.  The Original Tinder Box(Est.1928) The founder, Ed Koplin, Sr.
has been blending tobacco since 1928.

It's not at all your basic shopping mall Tinder Box.  It's a small cottage
with a very cozy, friendly ambiance and a perpetual blue
cloud of cigar and pipe smoke.  There's an excellent selection of pipes
ranging from high end collectables to moderately priced estate pipes
and 'good values'(which I smoke).  Every once in a while I'll treat my
self to a cigar but they're a little hard on my budget.

Ed discovered his blending talents while working in a pharmacy.  Customers
would ask him create a mixture tasting like the designer blends, Dunhill,
etc.  He still oversees the shop.

My favorite blend is still Continental 51, a rich aromatic which isn't too
sweet, and which, by the way, was suggested by a pipe smoking female
employee. Since receiving the Digest I've expanded my horizons and now enjoy
English blends as well.   As you can imagine there are dozens of prepared
blends as well as bulk tobacco to create your own blend.  They keep a book
of favorite blends of the  'Rich and Famous'(well, many names that we'd
recognize, I was told) but this practice is almost defunct.  They also
carry tins of the tobaccos I've read about in the newsgroup and the Digest,
but I've yet to try them.

Ed's sells pouches of tobacco labeled Tinder Box International and
those which state that they are original blends and not available elsewhere.
When I ask about Ed's affiliation with the other Tinder Boxes I'm told
that Ed's store is a 'Maverick`(maybe someone knows the whole story?).

I'm in no way affiliated with the store but thought that it should be
included in your Resource Guide.  They're now in a fight for their life
because Santa Monica is on the verge of passing the strictest anti-smoking
law in the country which would outlaw smoking in all work places(except
the cab of a truck) and public places, even _outdoor_ eateries.

Steve, I really look forward to receiving the Digest and it's getting
better every week.  Good job.  BTW, are all these pipe people really
so civil or do you moderate out the flames and such?

ps:  the week after I submitted my bio to the Digest someone from the
Southwest Pipe and Cigar Assoc(I think it was) e-mailed me about getting
together with their club.  He said he had my address and would contact
me about upcoming meetings.  I lost your mail...where are you?

Hi, Steve. I'm just back from a family visit trip to Chicago, where I took
the opportunity to load up on some winter pipe provisions. 
At Iwan Ries, sadly reduced these days from their glory days, I found an
unsmoked Cellini Original in their estate pipe selection. Snagged it for $20.
I also picked up 7 oz. of their International Blend, and a couple different
pouches of Balkan Sobranie, fondly remembered from the early 1960s.
At Alfred Dunhill's humble little shop in Water Tower Place I sought some
sample quantities of their non-aromatic blends. Imagine my chagrin to learn
they do not sell the blends from bulk supplies; I had to buy it in tins, just
like I can do at most any tobacconist. Anyway, I  got 100 gram tins of Early
Morning Pipe and My Mixture 965, and 50 gram tins of London Mixture and
Nightcap. So far only the London Mixture remains unsampled, but the first
impressions are mildly disappointing. I guess "mildly" is the operative word
here, because I was hoping for fuller taste across the board. I'm most used
to McClelland's bulk mixture #2020, and none of the Dunhill smokes reach that
level of tastiness. Oh well, it's not BAD stuff, and I'm sure I'll puff it
all away over the coming months.
I thought I'd enlist technology in an end-run around recent smoking bans at
my local enclosed malls, where I used to smoke cigars throughout the winter,
in the public lounging areas. I bought ritzy air filter machine, set it up in
one room and smoked a cigar there. 24 hours later the room still reeked of
stale cigar, so I had to return the appliance, and also retire my cigars
until I can smoke them in my porch swing next spring. Sigh.
I sure enjoy reading Pipes Digest, and appreciate all the time and effort you
must expend on its timely publication to us "chimleys". Keep up the good
work.
Best Regards, Dennis.

Thanks for including me in the mailing list. Your newletter is great. I'm
relatively new to the internet, and it is a pleasure to find such a civil
forum, and so many ideas and tips.

I have lived in the Boston area for the last 18 years, but I grew up in the
St. Louis area. Started smoking cigarettes when I was 15, and gave them up
about seven years ago, with beneficial effects to my lungs. (I really liked
the comment somebody made, that you don't taste with your lungs.) At any rate
I started smoking cigars about three years ago, but I am cheap, and don't
like paying that much in either time or money for my tobacco, even though, I
still have a half dozen or so most weeks. I like A. Fuentes Cuban Coronas, La
Hoya Selectas, and an occasional Ashton. I'm satisfied with the quality of
the smokes and not really inclined to experiment any more for now.

After two years of walking around in Peretti's and seeing all the pipes and
pipe smokers, I decided to try a pipe. I liked it from the beginning. It
tastes good, smells good, if I need to stop for a while, I can just put the
pipe in my pocket, and it's a process to improve forever, like making good
coffee. I started off with Peretti's pipes, then added a Peterson bulldog
second, several no-name seconds. Then I bought an Upshall, and have bought
two more, and two Peretti's straight grains. A  good friend gave me a
Peterson system pipe, which took forever to break in (I'm still not sure that
it is), and which does smoke pretty dry, as long as you don't tip it the
wrong way. I find that a good pipe is a much different experience, but that
price doesn't necessarily guarantee goodness. My 25 dollar Peterson second is
one of my best smokers.

I smoke English type blends. I have three from Peretti's that are my
regulars, and I've tried Balkan Sobranie original (not enough body), Butera's
English blend (wonderful, but more expensive than Peretti's Omega), and Four
Square London Mixture (also wonderful and expensive and close to Peretti's
Pride of Loch Lomand). I think the practice of naming blends is romantic, but
it sure makes comparison difficult. I am still experimenting with brands, but
I really appreciate having a shop that blends its own in the neighborhood.

Peretti's does an active mail order business. For the resource list:

Three of the shops in town put on occasional cigar smokers' nights. I'd like
to hear from someone in the Sherlock Holmes club. It would be nice to have a
place to sit around and smoke with congenial souls.

I've been to Jon's (?) smoke shop in Urbana, Ill. a couple of times, and find
it a really friendly place with a great selection of cigars and pipes,
especially their used pipes.

I'll close now, and just say how much I appreciate being a part of this
conversation.

Steve,

I dunno if anyone else has written in about this, but for SF Bay Area
readers a new shop opened up Monday in Menlo Park.  It's called, I
believe, Knickerbocker Pipes and is located at the corner of El Camino
Real and Santa Cruz Ave.  It's part of a restaurant/bar called the
British Banker's Club and is owned by the same person.  He was a cigar
smoker for many years, but switched to a pipe about four months ago.
He became so enamored of smoking a pipe that he opened up a store!  I
visited yesterday and spent about twenty minutes conversing and
browsing.  It's small but extremely cozy.  Two big, comfy leather
chairs flank a heating stove, while a small walk-in humidor is located
right behind.  The decor is very "old British", very tasteful, and
they have many old and antique books sitting on shelves.  They offer
about 20 different blends and maybe 20 different cigars as well as a
few high-priced cigarettes.  They expect a shipment of estate pipes in
soon as well as a bunch of Dunhills.  I was invited to come back and
bring my pipe which I plan to do soon.  I was also welcome to smoke my
pipe within the restaurant, no small occurence here in California.

Anyway, I should add that I've got no connection with them except as a new 
acquaintance and satisfied customer -- once!  

In other news (I'll shut up in just a sec), I found out the final "score" for 
the pipe smoking contest held a couple of months ago in San Jose, CA.  The 
record is now 1 hour, 11 minutes.

Take care,

The shop is now open.  It is decorated in antiques, including two buffalo 
heads and several Tiffany lamps.  They have bulk tobacco, about 12 
blends, and some tins.  They are building their pipe stock slowly, but 
have a modest assortment of Petersons and GBD's.

They also have an interesting estate collection not yet priced comprised 
mainly of Dunhills.  One of them stamped with the year 1936 has never 
been smoked.

They are a part of the British Bankers Club.  You can purchase one of 
their quality cigars, then smoke it in the lounge, or drop into the 
tobacco shop for a pipefull and a nice port or sherry.

All in all, I rate this shop an 11 on the 1 to ten scale.  It is well 
worth a visit.

Well, after all this hubbub lately with Bengal Slices, I finally broke down and
bought both kinds from J.R. Cigar.  I tried the aromatic kind first, an opinion
on which I found later in the Digest back issues (not a good one, either).  I
am assuming this stuff has a lot of latakia in it.  One fair sized bowl of the
stuff was enough to make me feel sick.  I don't know if I need to build myself
up to a better tolerance for nicotine, but I've never felt like that after
smoking a bowlful before!  I think I'll stick to the lighter Virginia blends
for awhile.  Anyone have a similar experience with any kind of tobacco, or am I
just not man enough to handle it?  Is latakia known for its strength like
perique, or is it on par with other types?  Is there some sort of blend that
has a smaller latakia component that I should try to give it a fair chance?

Hi! Ho!...To all the "puffers" on internet.......and I am not talking
about blowfish.

I shall not spend a great deal of time providing personal wisdoms or
critiques, but I did invite Lynwood Hines, the CORPS Public Relations
Person and Director of Special Projects to explain our organization.

What follows is  brief promotion of the Conclave......

******************************************************************************

Welcome!  The info below should tell all.  If you have any questions,
write or call.  We look forward to having you join us and to hearing
from you.  If you are in the Richmond area, don't hesitate to get in
touch.

The Conclave Of Richmond Pipe Smokers, C.O.R.P.S. (pronounced "CORE"
like the Marine Corps), is a non-profit organization, founded for its
members and the public to enjoy the Ancient &amp; Honourable Art &amp; Sport
of Pipe Smoking; and to educate and communicate any positive aspects
thereof.  We also, as much as possible, support Richmond area
children's charities with funds beyond our operating expenses.
Membership is open to any person or organization interested in any
aspect of the Art &amp; Sport.  A dues or sponsorship payment is required
(currently $15. per year for individuals).

We meet monthly, usually at Universal Leaf Tobacco Corp. offices,
Broad &amp; Hamilton Street's, but the location will vary.  Contact us for
the location of the next meeting.  An irregular newsletter is issued,
which provides meeting info, hobby happenings, literature, art and the
like.

We also host an annual Pipe Smokers' Exposition &amp; Celebration, on
Columbus Day weekend in October.  Join us at this event to marvel at
the world of pipe smoking!

We have a "voice-mail" phone which will record your message and give
you our news, anytime.  It is:

I hope the address and telephone number will find its way into the
resource guide for future reference.

Steve,......I shall visit within the next week several pipe emporiums
in Alexandria, Fairfax, and DC.......ie John Hayes, Graybeards of
London.  I shall write a brief review for my next mailer.

The Resource Guide is constantly being updated,......Which is best way
to obtain an updated copy, if one does not have WWW search
capability?.. or access?

May god bless every solitary puff!

Didn't hear about it, but I did pay a visit to Al DiFranco's shop on
Route 33 in Lawrenceville, NJ. Went in looking for one pipe. Went out
with two pipes, three cigars, a can of Cope's Escudo, six bundles of
Long's cleaners, and a bottle of sweetener. Did the old duck see me
coming or what? :-)

Tried one of the cigars last night; a Muniemaker. Essentially an El
Producto in a very coarse maduro wrapper. Wouldn't recommend it.
Didn't drink any port (not into it, really), but I did have a Sam
Adams Winter Lager, which was enjoyed.

The other two cigars (a Fuente and an Ashton, both also maduros) await
the next round of bashing. :-) (I was into sampling Maduros.)

BTW, if you're in the neighborhood, a trip to Mr. DiFranco's shop is
worthwhile. The pipe selection's not large, but there are plenty of
cigars, and Mr. DiFranco and the patrons are all friendly. Worth it
just to see Bing Crosby's letter of appreciation for Mr. DiFranco's
golf-club pipe. :-)

The battle against prohibition is not over... it's moving to the state
level. Just this morning, I learned that there is a bill in the New
Jersey state legislature that would deny smokers any public place to
assemble peacefully for the legal purpose of enjoying a smoke, in
violation of the First Amendment. Like the OSHA finding, it would
prohibit all smoking in bars, hotels, restaurants, even tobacco
shops. Everywhere but your (detached, single-family) home -- and that
will be next.

If your state legislature is considering some similar smoker-bashing
bill, please write your elected state representative. It is the
owners' right to decide whether their establishments will permit
tobacco, and the patrons' right to decide, as adults, whether to go
there.

Also in the news: Marvin Shanken of Cigar Aficionado schedules a march
on the White House, (in March, of course!) See my article later in
this Digest, and hope to see you there!

But now, let us take our still-legal-for-the-moment smokes in hand and
move on to lighter (!) topics; on this week's venue, we meander
through magazines, magnolias, Menlo Park, Macedonia, and meerschaum...

<a name="3">Subject: 1950 CIRCA FAQ</a>

Steve, the following is from a booklet entitled "The American Smoker,"
October 1950, with a photo of actor Charles Coburn lighting a cigar.
The booklet's contents are especially interesting, given the almost
50 years that have passed since it was written. There's a lengthy
article on Green colored wrappers vs brown - Green stated to be harsh -
many photos of ancient pipes in an article on pipe collecting, an article
on a Sioux Indian "peace pipe" carver with photos of his work, and some
ancient "FAQs" that I have copied herein. There is a lengthy article by a 
Chinese gentleman, Lin Yu Tang of Peiping, China, on "A Smoking Philosophy."
When I have time I will transcribe that probably 10 or so page article 
for the newsgroup. I have finally been able to get net access to FTP via
this BBS. Could you give me an address I can FTP such things to that can
be accessed by those interested, since my E-mail buffer capacity is limited
to rather short messages, 1000 characters or bytes, I think.

"STEEL WOOL FILTER: By taking a small amount of steel wool,
rolling it up into a ball (not too tightly), and placing it at the
bottom of the bowl, you will be creating quite simply one of the most
effective filters I've ever encountered. Do not use too large a ball
of steel wool, since I've found that a large one is no more effective
than the pea-sized one I use. And for best results put in a new ball
with each smoke.R.J. Evans, Van Wert, Ohio."

"COOLING BURNING PIPE: Here's a little trick I learned 14 years
ago from a real old-timer which gives you a cooler smoke. Following
every fifth puff on your pipe, blow out one or two puffs. You'll find
your next few puffs somewhat cooler and more enjoyable.
Robert Ormand, Santa Fe New Mexico."

"REMOVING BROKEN STEMS: Should a stem break while in the shank
of a pipe, insert an ordinary wood screw. With pliars, (sic) execute a slow
twist to the right while simultaneously pulling straight back. A 
straight pull is best to avoid cracking the shank. Should this fail
and it appear that the stem is too tightly wedged, place the whole unit
in the refrigerator freezer for a few hours. Enough contraction
occasioned by cold, will suffice in nearly all cases to make removal
of the broken stem possible.   Miles Minton, Los Angeles, Calif."

"NEW BREAKING IN METHOD: Mix a paste of one teaspoon of 
powdered charcoal with three-quarters of a teaspoon of any type syrup.
Spread a thin coating in your new briar bowl, allow to dry, and then
light up. You'll find that it'll smoke like a well broken-in pipe. The
paste almost immediately provides a protective carbon caking."
Ronald Meyer, University City, St. Louis, Mo."

"PORTABLE PIPE RACK: By inserting a pipe cleaner into the bit
of a pipe and hooking the bent other end over a horizontal rod, wire,
or string, you have a neat portable pipe rack. the pipe hangs bowl down
very nicely.L.J. Christenson, Minneapolis."

"HOMEMADE PIPE SWEETENER: For the best homemade pipe sweetener
I've ever come across, mix and apply this solution to your pipe. 1 oz.
Karo white syrup, 1 oz. hot (not boiling) water, 1/4 oz. Burnett's
Black Walnut or Rum extract. Swab bowl and shank and run a saturated
cleaner through the pipe.   J. Heller, New Kensington, Pa."

"KEY RING PIPE CLEANER: Always forgetting your cleaner? Well,
you can carry one around with you at all times on your key ring by 
twisting a 5-inch piece of iron wire and hooking it onto your key ring.
These wires do an all-around job and are easily replaceable when they 
become too dirty, bent or worn.Thad Ryan, Evanston, Ill."

marked and at end of Forbes Road.)  The meeting starts at 6:00PM, we order
seperately off the menu at around 7:00PM, eat at 8:00PM, gab and swap stories,
tobacco and pipes until 10.  Casual dress, about 15 of us in a private room,

favorites.  The group includes a retiring security guard, a college librarian,
a computer whiz, a state worker, insurance agent, machinist, tobaconist, and
all are fun people joined by a fondness for pipes, tobacco and a willingness
to share their stories with others.  Many of the members have collections
exceeding 300 pipes, for which they can recite the date bought, how much paid,
who made it, the weather the day it was made and the location of the briar
when it was harvested. :-{).

Dues are $2.00 per meeting.  Each meeting has a theme this coming one being
Meerchaums so bring yours to show, admire, swap or sell.

EMail back f you want more info.

<a name="5">Subject: Re: "Rabbit tobacco" and other smokeable plants (was: Youngest PS)</a>

Coffee actually works pretty well as a tobacco substitute (grind whole
beans, but leave them MUCH coarser than you would to make the beverage).

_The Pipe_ by Georges Herment (1957) lists the following tobacco
substitutes:
Magnolia flowers, clover blossoms, lavener petals, rose petals, walnut
leaves, chestnut leaves, birch leaves, pear leaves, cherry leaves, fig
leaves (also suitable for wearing :)), rose leaves, tomato leaves,
artichoke leaves, sage, verbena, wormwood, burdock, and borage (among
others).
For all of these, remove all stems. Soak for 24 hours in water containing
a pinch of carbonate of potash.  Then let dry slowly in a dark place.
    He highly recommends coltsfoot, and describes the preparation for
smoking:
Remove veins from leaves.  Soak for two days in salt water. Cut up and
replace in salt water for two more days. Dry in the sun.
  During the German Occupation of France, French smokers reportedly used
coltsfoot almost exclusively.
  Of course, they smoke tobacco now, which should tell you something.

also  make what they call an unfinished bowl which are of same high 
quality  but bowls are not polished and in time turn a nice color.
Brigham is also famous for their maple wood filter system which clears 
alot of moisture and impurites from the smoke. They do have a catalogue 
and repair service turn around service usually 48 hours from the time 
they receive your pipe. They repair all makes. Brigham also carries a 
line  of tobacco that I'm not to familiar with pipe cleaners, liquid cleaner
etc. They do a great mail order business which I have used several times 
and  reamend them highly. The address is as follows:
Brigham Pipes Limited
25 Ripley Ave.
Toronto, Ontario
M6S 3P2

PH.416-762-7278
Fax. 416-762-7270
I hope this might be of some help if you want to try a different kind of 
pipe I know that you will be well pleased.

Smoke Signal #8
November 18, 1994
?????@???.???.???

My commerce with cyberspace and the Internet is limited to Pipes
Digest and one or two forums on CompuServe, so judging from the
several comments in Pipes Digest #165 the Internet sounds as though
it is populated with an irascible crowd of yahoos. I never expected
the Digest to be anything other than civilized. We live in a world
of intolerant people of which the Honorable Company of Pipe and
Cigar smokers is a small reservoir of decorum and civilization.
Long may we persist and may we lead others by our example towards
more harmonious existence.

To the Gentleman preparing to essay the merits of a clay pipe: Do
so gently. Rotate it with your briars, slowly increasing your
frequency of use.

Latakia is heady tobacco, probably responsible for the dizzy spell
reported in #165. I too have had such an experience, which is why
most of my pipes have small bowls; I like the flavour and aroma of
Oriental leaf, but don't have the head for too much of it. As I was
warming up this contribution to the Conversation I was assisted by
a large plug of Trollshaws Flake in a pipe of Charatan's Own Make,
altogether less of a supercharge.

When Carl Ehwa, Junior, wrote his "The Book of Pipes and Tobacco"
in 1974, he resided in Kansas City, Missouri. His book he dedicated
to his grandfather Doctor W. C. McClelland. Agricultural &amp;
Mechanical Gazette carried an advertisement for Ringlow Syrian
Reserve tobacco. Kathy Levin, the widow of Barry Levin, sells a
Personal Reserve Series of pipe tobaccos from her address in Aptos,
California. Her voice came through the telephone sweetly, her
handwriting on her bill of sale was elegant, and the Ringlow Syrian
Reserve tobacco was excellent. With this Ringlow mixture, Kathy
included the Levin Pipe's catalogue for their Personal Reserve
Series of tobaccos, made for them by the McClelland Tobacco
Company. I ordered a tin of their Klenderwood Matured Oriental
Mixture and their Matured Virginia Sampler, Matured Oriental
Sampler, and Fragrant Matured Virginia Blends Sampler. When they
arrived, I noted on the tin of Klenderwood mixture that the
McClelland Tobacco Company is located in Kansas City, Missouri. It
is from this sequence that I deduce Ehwa as being related to 
McClelland Tobacco and as knowing a thing or two about pipes. Of
these tobaccos, I have enjoyed the British Woods and Trollshaws
Flake most. We can talk about McClelland tobacco later, let us
examine Ehwa's book first.

A good coffee table book with plenty of colour plates, line
drawings, and monochrome pictures; sadly, this book is out of
print. It is well balanced between the history of smoking, tobacco,
and the pipe, divided into four parts:

     1.   The Remarkable Evolution of Smoking.
          Despite royal opposition and drastic punishments, smoking
          spread rapidly.

     2.   The Amiable Pipe.
          The beauty and variety of clay, porcelain, softwood,
          hookah, meerschaum, calabash, and briar.

     3.   Tobacco: "The Special Herb".
          The leaf is carefully nurtured, cured, processed, and
          blended.

     4.   Pleasures of the Pipe.
          The art of getting the most from tobacco and pipe.

My copy I borrowed from the library. If you find a used copy for
sale, buy it for I think this to be about the best book I have seen
for a good all round text on the subject. It is frustrating to hear
of a good book only to be denied a copy, but all is not lost if I
bring before you the salient points on tobacco and pipe.

Of tobacco, Ehwa says that: "Oriental tobaccos are present in most
well-conceived luxury mixtures. While the experienced pipe smoker
knows them well for the subtle flavor and aroma they impart, he [or
she] has little or no knowledge of their origin."

"Oriental tobaccos are grown in the picturesque area surrounding
northwestern Mediterranean, the Aegean, and most of the Black Sea.
All these tobaccos became known as 'Turkish' during the Ottoman
Empire (1300-1918). Oriental tobaccos differ considerably from all
other types -- in chemical composition and in plant and leaf size
-- and have a subtle, yet rich, natural taste and aroma when
properly cured. Their flavor and aroma are reminiscent of delicate
spices and herbs."

"Major names of Oriental tobaccos, such as Xanthi and Samsun,
generally represent districts, not unlike the nomenclature of
French wines. Oriental tobaccos vary in flavor, color, and aroma
from district to district, as do the tobaccos of the flue-cured
growing belts of the United States."

"There are two basic classifications: Orientals and semi-Orientals.
While the semi-Orientals possess similarities to the Oriental
tobaccos in taste, they are heavier in body and not so fragrant.
Semi-Orientals are grown in areas bordering Oriental growing
regions. They are not very important in world trade."

"Most authorities consider true Orientals to be produced in Thrace
and Macedonia, which are now in the northeastern portion of Greece;
peninsular Greece; southern Bulgaria and Yugoslavia; some of the
Aegean islands; the western end of Turkey, centured [sic] around
Izmir; northern Turkey, bordering the Black Sea; Anatolia, the
northeastern portion of Turkey across the Bosphorus; the southern
portion of the Black Sea, principally in the Crimea; and Cyprus."

"The most important regions that supply English and American
manufacturers are Thrace, Macedonia, north-central Turkey, extreme
western Turkey, and Cyprus. Each area's produce has its
distinguishing marks."

"Western Turkey -- Here the famous Smyrna tobacco is grown in the
vicinity of Izmir. It is the most aromatic and full-bodied Oriental
tobacco, but it is rather dark in color and has a tendency to burn
poorly."

"Cyprus -- This island also grows the Smyrna type. The Cypriots
either sell the tobacco in the standard yellow Oriental form or
they fumigate it to make Latakia."

"North-Central Turkey -- Samsun-Bafra tobacco is grown in the
vicinity of these two cities -- a very delicate, lightly colored
tobacco, and the most light-bodied of all Orientals."

"Thrace -- Around the city of Xanthi is grown the very famous
Xanthian leaf, deemed by some to be the finest Oriental tobacco. It
is very light-bodied. The area also produces Yenidje, a somewhat
more full-bodied tobacco."

"Macedonia -- The tobacco-growing industry centers around the
cities of Kavalla, Drama, Salonika, and Katerini, and grows a
medium-bodied type."

"Latakia and Perique, along with light Oriental types, are grouped
as condiment, or flavoring, tobaccos. Latakia probably has the
richest and most pungent aroma of all natural tobaccos used in
blending. Latakia gets its name from the Syrian port of Al
Ladhiqiyah."

"Perique is unique to the St. James Parish of Louisiana. In the
1750s, a French colonist, Pierre Chemot, observed Choctaw and
Chickasaw Indians of Louisiana pressing local tobaccos in hollowed-
out logs. The pressure caused the tobaccos to release their natural
juices and the Indians allowed the leaf to steep in this juice.
Chemot perfected this type of processing and developed the fragrant
tobacco to which he gave his nickname, Perique."

"Today only about twenty growers produce on the average 150,000
pounds of this leaf a year. The seedlings, sown in December and
January, are transplanted in March to the fields. Perique is then
handled much like Burley, except that each Perique plant is topped
to mature only eight to ten leaves. In July, the ripe plants are
stalk-harvested and hung in a curing shed for about fourteen days
until uniformly brown. The tobacco is stemmed and stripped from the
stalk, put into one-pound bundles, and placed in oak barrels and
pressed. After two weeks under heavy pressure, the tobacco is
removed, aired, and cooled, then repacked and repressed. This
procedure is repeated twice. Manufacturers continue processing it
for about ten months. The pressure causes the tobacco to turn
brownish black or black. About eighteen months after planting,
Perique is ready to be aged."

Ehwa defines some terms he uses to describe pipe tobaccos. "_Aroma_
refers to the fragrance of the tobacco, in the can and as it is
being smoked. Unless the smoker has considerable experience with
all types of tobacco and is able to judge what type of leaf has
been used, the aroma when the can is opened is, in most cases, no
more than a gentle advertisement which sometimes proves to be
false. A smoker cannot adequately judge the aroma of a tobacco as
he smokes -- it can only be measured by the comments he receives."

I have heard it said that one aspect of a tobacco can be judged by
smoking a pipe full in a closed room. After smoking the tobacco
leave the room, closing the door behind you. Return in an hour and
smell the room. If the residuals still smell good then the tobacco
is worth pursuing in your pipe.

Ehwa says that: "_Flavor_ refers to the basic taste of the tobacco.
This can be measured in three ways: First, the type or nature of
the flavor, such as 'fruity,' 'nutlike,' 'spicy,' 'natural,' or
'Oriental.' Second, the intensity of the flavor or richness can be
measured by using the terms 'mild' (which refers to tobacco that is
light in flavor), 'medium,' and 'full' (referring to a tobacco with
a great deal of flavor). Third, the flavor of tobacco can be
analyzed with regard to its sweetness. 'Naturally sweet' refers to
a tobacco with the rather subtle sweetness one gets from some
natural leaf to which flavoring has not been added. Then there are 
'lightly sweet,' 'sweet,' and 'very sweet.' These graduated
measurements apply to flavored or aromatic tobaccos."

"_Body_ refers to the feeling one gets from the tobacco as it is
smoked. The fact that a tobacco has an intense flavor does not
necessarily mean it will be full-bodied. For example, very mild,
lightly flavored Burley tobaccos tend to be more full-bodied --
that is, have a more aggressive effect on the palate -- than some
full-flavored types of leaf. Body, then, is directly related to the
strength or depth of the character of tobacco rather than to its
taste."

"Light-bodied tobaccos are gentle; medium-bodied are robust but not
strong; full-bodied are hearty. 'Strong' tobaccos can be classified
as 'gutsy'; there is no delicacy in tobaccos labelled strong."

"_Smoothness_ is the result of a fine balance between the flavor
and the body of a tobacco. When a mixture tastes good, is not
overpowering, and is not harsh in any way, it is smooth. Smoothness
is so subject to individual taste it cannot be classified by
degrees."

Ehwa devised a five-class classification system for tobaccos on the
American and European markets. "The five classifications of tobacco
-- American, English, Scottish, Irish, Dutch, and Danish -- are
named for countries. Over the years each nation cited has produced
its own distinctive tobaccos for pipe smokers. Recently [1974],
however, because of the expanding market, various countries have
begun to produce a wider range of types, so that they now overlap
one another."

"Within the group of English-Scottish tobaccos lie virtually all
the mixtures and straight tobaccos that have been held in the
highest esteem by connoisseurs for decades. . . . English-Scottish
straight tobaccos, which are also classified as 'Matured
Virginias,' are made with very few exceptions from high-grade
Virginia. . . . The excellence of Matured Virginias is dependent
upon the basic richness and other fine properties of choice leaf.
Virginia contains the highest quantity of natural sugar of any
tobacco. . . . A fine Matured Virginia is somewhat analogous to an
excellent Cognac. It possesses an alluring initial aroma that is
neither light nor heavy and, although it is not so penetrating as
the aroma of Cognac, it is similar in that both products remind one
of a subtle mixture of rare fruit and spices in which no single
ingredient overpowers another. . . . English-Scottish blends
probably are the most noble of all mixtures made for the pipe. No
flavoring agents or heavy casings are used in their manufacture.
Their aroma, flavor, and softness are derived from the use of the
choicest leaf blended and seasoned skillfully by craftsmen. The
knowledgeable smoker generally favors these fine tobaccos. When
choice, unflavored Virginias, Orientals, and dark condiment
tobaccos are blended and matured, the result is a product that
offers distinct flavor characteristics, smoothness, and an
exceptionally light body. . . . English-Scottish mixtures generally
are marketed under the classifications mild, medium, and full. The
mild mixture has a light, or mild, flavor intensity and is light in
body; it has a tendency, however, to be slightly sharp. The medium
mixture is usually well-balanced. It is not so piquant as the mild
mixture, having a medium flavor intensity and a slightly fuller
body. The full mixture is intense in flavor and aroma owing to the
presence of greater quantities of dark condiment tobaccos. Smokers
tend to believe a full mixture is harshest, but the reverse is
true. Full English-Scottish mixtures are usually the smoothest."

Ehwa recommends the English-Scottish tobaccos to any smoker, ". .as
one can find a variation to suit his taste at any time of day. The
most expensive tobaccos are found in this group yet they are well
worth the price. These high-quality tobaccos contain no harsh
flavorings and are low in moisture content. Two ounces of an
English-Scottish mixture generally will go further than two ounces
of another type. Also, because of the natural richness of English-
Scottish blends, it usually takes fewer bowls to satisfy."

We will take a break here. In my next puff I will quote from Ehwa's
chapter "Pleasures of the Pipe" and consider his advice: for "The
New Pipe Smoker", on "Filling and Lighting the Pipe", on "Care of
the Pipe", and look at "Some Problems and Solutions."

I take exception to the idea that meerschaum pipes are "superior" to briar. 
A good meerschaum may be superior to a cheap briar, certainly. You can't get 
a good briar for $20-30. You can get a first-class briar from J.T. &amp; Deb 
Cooke for $150.00 A good Upshall, Dunhill, Ashton, Castello, etc. will cost 
far more.

I'm a briar person. Some folks are meerschaum people, some like both. I just 
can't get interested in meerschaum. To me, the taste lacks character, and, 
since I'm a sandblast freak, meerschaum pipes, carved or smooth, just don't 
look interesting. I bought a meerschaum out of a sense of obligation and 
fairplay about a year ago--a pretty good one, I think--but I just don't 
smoke it.

A quick plug. I've lived in Urbana, Illinois, Rochester NY, Louisville, and 
now in New York City, but I've never come across a pipe store to match Jon's 
Pipe Shop in Urbana (even with the fine NYC stores). I got my first pipe 
there in 1965--a Saseini 4-dot Victoria dublin. The store is still going 
strong, and has a first-rate collection of Dunhills, Ser Jacopos, Petersons, 
ect., ect It also has a whole cabinet of second-hand pipes, ranked by 
quality and price. The man who runs it, Patrick, is a tall rakish 
Irish-American, very lively, helpful, and knowledgeable. He's a state cop, 
and since his income is not dependent on the store, he is less susceptible 
to the ebbs and flows of pipe/cigar sales. His mother runs the store when 
he's out being a policeman, and she's quite a charter, and knows all the 
customers by name. It's the best pipe store I've ever been to.

<a name="11">Subject: Youth...Sincerity...</a>

Steve,
      I thought I would share this incident with fellow PDers...

As some of you know by now, I had a letter published in the most recent
issue of Cigar Aficionado.  Looking through my back issues (btw I'm missing
# 4 and # 6 can anyone help me find them?) I noticed that mine was the only
letter to include a full address.  I did not know what sort of impact the
inclusion of my address would have.
Late Saturday night, I was visiting a friend I had not seen for months.  I
received a phone call from a man who said he was from Atlanta, Georgia.  He
introduced himself and told me he was a 35-year-old information systems
analyst and he had a 13-year-old nephew who read my letter, in which I
stated that I began smoking cigars at the age of 13.  This man, who I will
call "Jeff" (I cannot remember his name!) asked me if it was all right for
his nephew Patrick to write me a letter.
    It seems that over the summer, Jeff caught Patrick, who was then 12,
smoking a maduro Hoyo Excalibur #1.  Jeff said that Patrick looked as if he
had been doing this for years, not like some kid sneaking off behind the
garage for the first time with one of his grandfather's White Owls &lt;g&gt;
Jeff also told me that he began smoking cigars at age 11 using his paper
route money to buy a box of cigars once a month.  He didn't want to hide it
from his parents any more, so, one evening, at age 16, he took a Hoyo de
Monterrey Sultan out of his sock and lit up right after dinner, totally
shocking and upsetting his parents, both avid cigarette smokers.  He said he
used to receive the most unusual stares from people and felt like an
outcast because he appeared to be even younger than he was at the time.

We talked for over two hours on the phone (I won't tell any more of his
stories--I'll let him tell them when he joins the Digest group)

Jeff's main concern, though, was for Patrick, who, at age 13, enjoys 3-4
cigars a day (double coronas--esp La Gloria Cubana Charlemagnes) as well as
a pipeful or two of various English blends (I'm told that he immediately
developed a taste for Balkan Sobranie)

Patrick would very much like to meet other pipe and cigar smokers, but Jeff
feels that Patrick is afraid he will not be taken seriously.  I suggested
that Patrick start by joining the Digest group.  I know that several of us
were only his age when we started (or at least had a curiosity :-{)&gt;  )
I am simply wondering if he can expect the same level of cameraderie the
rest of us feel.
I, for one, would like to think he can!

[Steve, do you think this subject is too sensitive to be discussed here?
Please let me know how you think this should be handled.  Jeff's description
of Patrick was that of a youthful, yet extremely mature 13-year-old with a
sincere passion for pipes and fine cigars.]

         Thank you everyone for taking the time to consider this request

[btw, this is *not* the story I promised last week, I just thought it was
much more interesting than the story I was going to send in...that can wait,
though...]

[ Patrick is welcome to join us here, Thomas, and I hope our other
members will join me in welcoming him. If he's concerned, I'll
withhold his email address (or that of any other member). But I don't
think he'll have any problems. BTW, great letter in CA, and
congratulations on the print! -S. ]

<a name="12">Subject: Anyone interested in forming pipe/cigar group in Menlo Park??</a>

As people who read this letter or group (posted in both places) might know,
there is a new pipe/cigar store in Menlo Park. Knickerbockers is somewhat
unique, since it is owned by and part of the British Bankers Club (BBC). In
fact, when I visited the pipe store was stocked with port and sherry - you
could purchase a cigar, a glass of port, and sit in an easy chair and smoke
your port and drink your cigar, approximately. More to the point, the
fellow in the pipe store stated that smoking in the bar was "ok". I did'nt
really test this out, and don't know what the legalities are.

What I was thinking about was the posting about the pipe club that meets in
Schmidt's in the East Bay (copied below). How much interest is there in a
similar (very informal) event at Knickerbockers/BBC, in the South
Bay/Penninsula area. I have no idea if the owner of both has any interest,
or if the law will allow this (I believe that Schmidts may be a special
case, since they sell tobacco and may be classed as a tobacco store - at
least they did the last time I was in there, which was several years ago).,
but it seemed an interesting idea - at least to me. The combination of
bar/pipe store seems like a perfect arrangement for this.

Just an idea. Any comments??

will be meeting next Sunday at 2pm.  Show up, and you're a member!  We
meet on the third Sunday of each month at Schmidt's Pub, 142 Solano
Avenue, Albany CA.  A good time rarely so inexpensive.  Lots of tobacco
and pipe lore, trading is often fast and furious, much gorgeous briar to
see and touch, and fine cameraderie to boot!  (Add to that the decent
selection of micro-brewery beers, plus a few tasty draughts from England,
and you've got a nice way to spend an afternoon! ;)

So, if you're planning a soujourn to California (or you just happen to

<a name="14">Subject: Pipe Stems</a>

The best way to get rid of that ugly brown oxidation on fine vulcanite stems
is as follows:

Prior to this method please note the following: If your pipe stem has any
logo with paint stamped into the bit, cover the stamp with a little vaseline
or Chapstick type of wax. This will protect the stamp. Then soak your stems
in undiluted household bleach for about an hour or so. They will bubble a
little bit, but that's O.K. After they have soaked, remove them and rinse
extremely well with lots of pipe cleaners. Them buff the stem with a good
polish, I use a metal polish found in motorcycle shops called Simichrome.
Comes in a yellow and red box or tube. Your stem will have that brand new
deep black gloss you've missed.

NOTE: I have found on older vulcanite (like pipes from the 50's) this
treatment will roughen and slightly pit the surface. This is O.K., but you
have to be prepared to spend a lot more time in polishing the stem. Out of my
50 some odd pipes this happened to only two of them. But nothing a buffing
whell couldn't handle. 

FYI: If you can't find a tobacconist that has a buffing wheel, it might be
worth the investment of a Dremel Hand Tool. This little drill like appliance
for hobbyists has several attachments, one of them being a small cloth wheel
to which polish can be applied.

I have been trying, as yet unsuccessfully, to find pipe computer graphics.
I'm interested in anything you can offer: full-color, clip art, whatever, of
any format. If any of the AOL members has availability to such a thing I
would appreciate being sent a copy via E-mail or being told where to find it.
I've looked on AOL.The only graphics devoted to smoking seem to be graphics
devoted to "No Smoking!".

Thanks,
Christopher D. Walborn

[ I've been wondering if someone has a list of pipe logos in
postscript or GIF form that we could put up on the Web and FTP
sites... Please let me know if you have a contribution to make. -S. ]

Lucky dog. We up here in the Land of Ice and Snow have not yet had the 
dog teams arrive with the bundles of CA's and our winter's supply of 
beef jerky. But then, I can buy a Cuban cigar here and you can't. Seems 
like a fair exchange.

Good luck on the smoke-in. I wonder if he will be able to pull in any

        Dear Steve,

Hi.  My name is Ryan Ebens.  I talked to Tom Hendricks on the phone
tonight, andhe gave me your address.  I am interested in getting into
your club on e-mail for cigars.  First, I'll tell you a little about
myself.  I'm 19 years old and am a sophomore at the University of
Illinois.  I'm not sure right now what my major is, but I am thinking
about majoring in astronomy or maybe even physics.  I have been
smoking cigars since about the age 15.  At first, I smoked the
cheapmachine-made cigars like Swisher Sweet Perfectos or El Productos.
But after I smoked those for a few years, I tried some Macanudos, and
never went back.  I smoked Macanudos for about a year, but then I got
tired of their mild taste, so I moved on to bigger and better cigars.
I now enjoy Hoyo De Monterrey ExcaliburNo. 1, Partagas No. 10, Arturo
Fuente Hemingway Masterpiece, Ashton No. 60 maduro, and Punch
Rothschild.  These are the best ones I smoke now.  But I also like
good cigars like the Henry Clay Brevas, or even any Te-Amo that's
large.  The experiences I have with cigars just keep getting better.
I no longer like mild cigars, like Dunhills, but I will enjoy a
Macanudo Vintage No. 1 if I can find one.  Even though they're mild,
they are an excellent cigar.  I think I might have one tomorrow,
actually, since they just got them in at the local shopwhich I'm sure
you've heard of, Jon's Pipe Shop.  Tom also told me that they just got
some La Gloria Cubanas in, so I think that I'll have to get some of
those, too.  I saw Tom's article in Cigar Aficionado, which I have a
three-year subscription to.  The reason I wrote to him is because I
wanted some informationon forming a cigar club, because I would like
to get one started here at U of I.He gave me a lot of useful
information, like the catalogs called Famous and JR, which I will call
to get subscriptions to.  Before now, I didn't even know that these
things existed.  Also, he gave me your e-mail address, and also how to
subscribe to the cigar thing on internet.  I haven't even used it
before, even though I have had it for two years.  I wish I'd have
known about it before now, but Tom tells me it's alright because I'm
only a sophomore.  He wishes he'd have started his club befor now,
since he's a senior.  So I'd appreciate it if you wrote back and told
me about this club you have, and whether or not I could get in on it.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Ryan D. Ebens

[ Welcome, Ryan! Tom's letter, which I just read last night, certainly
seems to have generated a lot of interest! -S. ]

<a name="20">Subject: Rejoice! New pipe store opens in Oxford</a>

After the dreadful news of the closure of Savory's, Oxford's only specialist 
pipe shop earlier this year, I can now report that the manager has opened a 
new store in a different location. It's called Avery's (geddit?) and is at 37 
High Street (across the road from University College, next door to Queen's 
College). Apparently, Peter Cross, the manager of Savory's, was made redundant 
when the owner went bust (owing 2.5 million pounds!) but has now rented this 
new shop on a long lease. He and his wife are running it between them. 

They have a pretty extensive range of tins and pouches of tobacco, and they've 
now started stocking loose tobacco as well. I bought 25 grams (bloody 
metrication) of an English blend today but, idiot that I am, I forgot to note 
the name. I'm sure I'll be back for more though. The range of pipes is pretty 
good too, mainly towards the medium-low and of the price range, but with a few 
premium ones as well. There is even now a dinky little walk-in humidor the 
size of a telephone box. So now there's yet another reason to come and visit 
Oxford, should any more be needed.

Oh, while I was in there I picked up a copy of the 1994 Pipesmokers Welcome 
guide to the UK. It contains a listing of specialist tobacconists and pipe 
shops in Britain: if anyone's interested I'll type it in and upload it. It may 
take me a while though, it's not a short list.

And the long-awaited (and increasingly-clamored-for) Pipes Digest #168
proves that Your Moderator occasionally gets very busy _and_ flubs it
once in a while, too. First, I got a submission from Olaf and
overwrote, rather than appended, his submission to the file. I waited
a week for the Siemens sysadmin to restore the file from backup, but
no response, and he's now on his way to India. :-( 

Not wanting to be fooled twice, however, I now have some measures in
place which should prevent the same accident from ever happening
again. If you submitted to #168 and your article hasn't appeared here,
possible, please re-send your submission and I'll include it in #169.

And now, as I have the pleasure of enjoying a bowl of Escudo (and,
later, MacBaren Burley) in front of my one-month-old RePentium-powered
Linux homebase, let us all likewise enjoy the good things of life as
we ponder the mysteries of sex (thought that'd get your attention!),
golf, coffee, Cambridge (our fair city), coffee, rishathra, wine, and
other sources of good cheer...

Hi Steve -

Nothing interesting, for the digest, I'm afraid, but maybe could be 
passed along anyway.  Local tobacconist (leavitt &amp; pierce of Cambridge) 
has for sale several reasonably priced pipes, brand names Brebbia and 
Ehrlich.  I know that Ehrlich is the name of a tobacconist here in 
Boston, but have seen neither name mentioned in the digest thus far.  
Does anyone (including you) have thoughts about/experience with these 
pipes? My budget is limited for now, which is why the prices, 
particularly for the seconds, are appealing.

Thanks,

Jeremy S. Woodburn

[ Brebbia is a large Italian pipe manufacuturer; some decent quality
stuff. -S. ]

<a name="5">Subject: For mailing list: Flavoring question</a>

  Something has tasted differently lately in my Turkish cigarettes
(maybe it's me, maybe it's the Georgopolu-&gt;Andron transition,
maybe it's the harvest.  Anybody else notice?  They're not as
sweet...) so since I decided to go back to pipes.

  I used to smoke a David P. Erhlich (Boston) blend called Mango
Cavendish.  It's not made anymore (Tobacconist, Ltd. has a blend of
the same name that is close, but I don't get there often).  Erhlich's
Judge's Mixture is supposedly mango flavored, but it's too mild for
my taste.
  What could I blend in or add to give more of an acid bite?  I
don't know the right word for what I'm looking for.  I'm not
talking about numb tongue/constricted throat, but the sharp flavor
in a lime or a pickle.  At the suggestion of the tobacconist I
tried some Latakia and some Perique (much loved on this list) but
that, and some other very dark stuff, and a Balkan blend, didn't
have the flavor I'm looking for.
  They've got plenty of cherry-flavored tobacco, but I don't like
my smoke to taste like a cough drop.
  Any suggestions would be welcome.

<a name="6">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #167 - November 23, 1994</a>

Some time ago, I promised to get information for the pipes faq/resource 
list regarding Mark Tinsky, the maker of American Pipes and an excellent 
repairer of all manner  of pipes.

I ran across Mark at a showing of his pipes today at John B Hayes Tobacco 
in Fairfax, VA.  Mark said he would be pleased to have his name and 
address listed for pipe repairs (he does truly excellent work, in my 
experience):

Mark Tinsky
HC-88, Box 223
Pocono Lake, PA 18347

For custom pipe orders, he insists that orders be placed through pipe 
merchants, as he does not want to get into the business of undercutting 
the shops that sell his pipes.

One merchant who carries a lot of Mark's pipes is:

John B. Hayes, Tobacconist
11755-L Fairs Oaks Mall
Fairfax, VA 22033
703/385-3033

By the way, John's store is one of the most warm and cordial pipe shops I 
have visited in my 22 years of pipe smoking.  I highly recommend a visit 
if your are in the Washington, DC area.

By the way, I did not list Mark's phone number because he does not want 
phone calls.  He prefers to deal with business by mail.  He is very 
reliable, and his prices are very reasonable.

Tom Line writes:

&gt;	Any thoughts on the idea of a pipe as a phalanx symbol; a 
&gt;symbolic extension of one's penis?  

Happens I've done a little library research on the subject.

A little-known study conducted by Masters and Johnson in 1958 [1]
showed that the sexual partners of pipe smokers, on average,
experienced orgasms that were 17% longer and 20% more intense than the
partners of nonsmokers. M&amp;J credited this to the presence of a
compound they called "enkapnelin," present in the blood serum of pipe
smokers and persisting for up to 72 hours after a smoke, which acts
both as a pheromone and a blood vessel relaxant (the latter having the
effect of increasing erection size in males and breast size in
females.)  Enkapnelin can also be passed orally between sex partners,
with roughly the same effect.

M&amp;J also experimented with the introduction of small amounts of
enkapnelin into the bloodstreams of nonsmokers and antismokers. On
nonsmokers, enkapnelin had no measurable effect. On antismokers, it
induced temporary impotence and psychotic panic, much as has been
found in related field studies [2].

In other words, pipe smokers are just sexier than nonsmokers. And
_especially_ sexier than the antis.

Steve, I would like to introduce myself.  I am Dick Galineau.
I reside in Midlothian, Virginia.  I am originally from
Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin.  I have enjoyed a pipe since 1961.  A
fellow worker introduced me to pipe smoking when I was working
construction during a summer break from the Univerity of
Wisconsin-Madison.  I have approx. 100 pipes.  My pipe of
choice is a Savinelli.  I alternate pipefulls of McBarren's
Scottish Blend and Amphora Red.  I rotate four pipes every week.

I am married with three daughters graduating from VCU and The
U. of Virginia this spring.  I am a writer and golfer.  If I
smoked like I golf I would be living in the local hospital's
burn center.

Keep the Pipe Digests coming.  They are very enjoyable and
informative.  I am interested in working on my vucanite stems.
Please, subscribers, keep your suggestions for cleaning and
sealing these stems coming also.  Thank you.

<a name="9">Subject: Smoke-friendly coffeehouse in Cambridge</a>

 I just wanted to bring to the group's attention to smoke-friendly
places (and one unfriendly place) in greater Boston.
 
 Right here in the People's Republic of Cambridge, the newly-opened,
and aptly-named Liberty Coffeehouse (497B Mass Ave, Lafayette Square
end of Central Square) does allow smoking.  (I didn't inquire about
pipes, cigars, or clove cigarettes.)  As far as I'm concerned
coffee and tobacco are two great alkaloids that go great together.
 At a recent visit the smoking side was filled with smokers, enjoying
their pleasures.  The ventilation was good, and the owners want to
make things better with smoke-eaters.

 I've been disappointed that the funky Someday Cafe in Davis Square,
Somerville (one of the first Pacific Northwest imported coffeehouses
in this area), self-righteously refuses to allow smoking, even now 
that they've expanded into two rooms.
 
 And for fine (yuppie? nouvelle?) dining, the Union Square Bistro,
in an old pool hall in Union Square, Somerville, has a smoking section
along one wall, and non-smoking along the other.

 The moderately expensive Barrett's on Boston Harbor does serve as
the site for cigar evenings I believe.
 
 Yes, this could have been distribution: ne, but I though y'all might
be interested in the state of things in this part of the world, or
places to patronize if you visit.

Was walking around the general vicinity of Beekman Place and saw the
following poster in the window of an upscale bar --

Opening Soon
THE CIGAR BAR
at Beekman Bar &amp; Books
Featuring the World's Finest Cigars
Exclusively From the Humidor of Alfred Dunhill
889 First Avenue [at 50th Street], NYC [212] 980-9314

The bar, what you can see from the street windows, is a handsome,
comfortable room with club chairs and bookshelves lining many of the
walls.  They have a large menu of over a dozen different wines and
champagnes and another 15 or so ports, cognancs, and armangacs available
by the glass for $5 - $45, and a menu of light fare for $8 - $15, as well
as coffees.

I have no affiliation with the business, just wanted to alert other NYC
residents and visitors to a cigar-friendly establishment.

I wonder if they'll allow you to bring your own cigars to smoke, and/or if
they'll have the counterpart of a "corkage" fee.... :~!

Steve,

This came to me from the airwaves of my son's college.  Thought
you might find it funny, if you have not seen it in another
form.

By the way, those four pipes I bought for $60 total, sent two
to JT Cooke.  Now they look like new.  A Charaton Executive for
$25 total and a Savinelli Auto 6 for the same.  Also sent him
two pipes I got from Nikos owned by a person who used the bowl
to drive nails when a hammer was not nearby.  Also look like
new for $7.50 each.  Cannot say enough good about them.

In October 1992, the ABU support team in Bellevue sent care packages
of Starbuck's coffee, chocolate covered coffee beans, and Frangos to
the North Carolina and Texas ABU teams.  This is one NC engineer's
account of what happened next....

From: Anthony Pacheco
<a name="13">Subject: Thanks for the Care Package!</a>

Bryce,

I say, the care package you sent was a big hit here, thanks!  Below is
a chronological description of the care package consumption:

Sometime before Friday: The Care package arrives.  I resist all
temptation to open the package and consume an entire box of Frangos.
Very impressive.

Friday 9:45 AM: I arrive early to work and open the care package that
was hidden under my desk.  I 'm amazed at all the good stuff in side,
but somewhat disappointed to find that there were two boxes of Frango
(or what ever they are calling them now) chocolate mints: I could have
eaten a box and nobody would have known.  Oh well.  I make a pot of
coffee using the robust Yukon blend, and eat three or four chocolate
covered expresso beans.  I send a message to NCABU announcing the
goodies.

10:00 AM: The pot of coffee is gone and ErikaPh, my manager, makes
another, which of course I have to sample.  All the items are a big
hit with everybody so far, except the chocolate covered expresso
beans, which are only popular with the real coffee fans (who
absolutely love them).  Not letting a good thing go to waste, I have a
couple more, a mint or two, and start on my second cup of coffee.  I
notice Erika actually drank two cups from this pot, and I start to
wonder how I could approach my manager about making sure she leaves
enough coffee for the rest of the queue.

10:10 AM: The pot of coffee is out again so HarveyY makes another.  I
of course must sample the Cafe Verona blend and indulge in a few more
chocolate covered expresso beans.  Erika again drinks two more cups of
coffee.  I frown but say nothing and in my depression eat another
Frango chocolate mint.

10:30 AM: There has been a single cup of coffee left for some time,
and not to let it go to waste, I drink it.

11:00 AM: KevinCo sees the empty coffee pot so he makes another, and
then fills my cup under protest.  Erika again drops by and fills her
mug, and pilfers some chocolate covered xxpresso beans.  For some
strange reason, my typing speed has increased from, 25 WPM to 60 WPM,

11:45 AM: For some (unknown) reason, I feel agitated.  To bleed of all
the excess energy coming from nowhere, I do 92 pushups while helping a
University of Oregon grad student with Excel.  Out the window I notice
Erika is on her second lap running around the building.  After all
that exercise, I feel thirsty, so I drink another cup of coffee and
for a snack down a few more chocolate covered expresso beans.

12:10 PM: I now notice that there are people dropping by my cube that
usually don't, in fact, I've seen the entire queue come by and sample
some goodies.  I try to chat, but for some reason people seem
interested in just sampling the various yummy Frangos and the
chocolate-almond mocha's.  Erika stops by for more coffee and we
exchange unpleasantries.  I don't recall the exact conversation, but I
do remember the phrases "useless stingy middle-manager" and "whinny
engineer".  For therapy I eat a few more chocolate covered expresso
beans and try to look up how to make a car bomb on Internet's
rec.pursuits.anarchy.

1:00 PM: I skip lunch, but do drink another cup of coffee and make
another pot by request.  Getting bored, I pick up the Charlotte phone
book and start dialing people at random, asking if they need any help
with Excel.  Erika comes by for another cup of coffee.  I miss her
with the stapler, but she wings me a good one with one of those cube
coat hooks.

2:00 PM: The entire queue, I believe, is wired with caffeine and
sugar.  I, being a Seattle native, am immune to these effects.  MikeNa
is 10 minutes into teaching his 2nd impromptu aerobics class.  It is
very interesting to watch engineers do jumping jacks while holding
their Aspect phones.

3:00 PM: HarveyY has built a small shrine for the coffee pot in the
empty cube next to me, and the low humming has started to get on my
nerves: "Huummmmm &lt;sip&gt; Hummmm &lt;sip&gt; Hummmmm &lt;sip&gt;."  Some people, I
swear.

3:30 PM: The Starbucks Guatemalan blend has been polished off, and a
fight has ensued in the hallway on whether to ration the chocolate
covered expresso beans for later or continue with the consumption.
Hastily, I build a laser pistol out of my MS Mouse card and the power
supply from my Mac II CI, and the fight quickly ends.  MikeNa shows up
and drags the unconscious rebels back to their desks.

4:00 PM: If I could just talk to the cleaning people into lending me
some Drain-O, I can complete the car bomb before Erika goes home.  The
coffee pot is empty again so of course I make another.  Nice guy that
I am, I drink a cup to sample the brew and deem it Most Excellent.  I
have a couple of Frango mints to compensate for skipping lunch.

5:00 PM: KevinCo informs me that Erika has been slipping by in
camouflage spandex to siphon off coffee with a long straw.  I thank
him for this valuable intelligence information.  In a time-honored
Seattle Male Bonding Ritual, we eat 5 chocolate covered expresso beans
each.

6:15 PM: I send mail to the entire queue announcing a fresh pot of
coffee (after drinking a cup first) and await Erika to sneak by with
glee.

6:20 PM: I caught Erika red-handed.  I dodge the pen she tried to stab
me with, and landed a good blow to her left kidney.  As she is
crawling back to her desk I hear her mumble something about "time to	
write a review".

6:25 PM I panic and in desperation, log on to the mail server with a
VTP connection.  I hack my way into Erika's Xenix mail spool file and
quickly write, in the Xenix Borne C Shell, a program that will send an
email message every 30 seconds using Erika's email name.  I address it
to the only people on campus at the time, Corporate Security, and
title the message, "I Want Bill Gate's Love Child!".  I "cc"
??????????@???.??? and ??????????????@?????.??? just for giggles and
grins.

7:30 PM: Two security guards show up, one drags Erika away and the
other starts packing her desk.  I laugh hideously at her shrieks of
protest, and in celebration jump in my girl friend's sports car and
drive around the Charlotte Coliseum several times at 120 MPH.

8:00 PM: I'm feeling really tired.  KevinCo points out that there
still an entire box of chocolate covered expresso beans left.  Not
wanting them to go to waste, we each eat half a box.

9:00 PM After successfully typing my 3rd impromptu novel while helping
Betty from Orlando with a data consolidation, MikeNa announces that
the queue has been shut off.  After the phone call I drink 14
complementary beers, and for some unknown reason, still couldn't get
to sleep that night.

With Pipes Digest #167 we welcomed a young fellow who is partial to
large cigars. Welcome he is too, for who cares whether a person is
young or old, male or female, Martian or Venusian. We don't care if
we share the aether with the "Triple Breasted Whore of Eroticon
Six" as long as she can keep a civil tongue in her head when
talking of Cigars and Pipes. E-mail saves us from being prejudiced
by the strange visage of the pipe-smoking Warthog, all we know of
him is from his gentlemanly postings to the digest and it is by
these the gentle soul is judged, not from the container in which
the soul resides. Welcome one, welcome all.

Let us continue with "The Book of Pipes and Tobacco" by Carl Ehwa,
Junior, and his chapter "Pleasures of the Pipe." Here is his
introduction.

"A person unaccustomed to any form of tobacco smoking may find pipe
smoking much less satisfying than he anticipated. A taste must be
developed. As with fine wines, cheeses, and well-prepared foods,
one learns slowly to appreciate subleties of taste and to
experience the full enjoyment they can provide. Each form of
smoking has its devotees and it is easy to see that it is all a
matter of taste."

"For me, the pipe is the most enjoyable form of smoking. I know of
no other that can stimulate and satisfy as many of the senses as
well as it does. The wide range tobacco types and the many cuts
available provide the pipe smoker with an almost endless variety
and with the capability of adapting his smoke to different
environmental conditions. Briar, gourd, meerschaum, and clay pipes
provide increasing visual pleasure as they season slowly, shade by
shade, into their simple or intricate patterns, as well as
excellent taste. Merely holding a fine pipe is one of life's
pleasures  for many smokers."

"There is a feeling in today's hurried world that pipe smoking is
something of an inconvenience. The fact that there aren't enough
knowledgable sales people to guide smokers properly has contributed
to the increasing number of pipe smokers whose expectations go
unfulfilled. Pipe smoking is a somewhat more involved pleasure than
cigar or cigarette smoking. You must prepare your own smoke and
keep your pipes clean. Yet the enjoyment you derive in return makes
the effort well worth your while."

"The New Pipe Smoker -- The initial approach to pipe smoking may be
a baffling affair because of the great number of pipes available in
varying shapes, finishes, and materials. When a new smoker sees a
broad selection of pipes, he may assume that each of them has a
completely different set of smoking qualities from the others. This
is not true. Inner bowl designs are the same in many pipes which
differ in outward appearance. If a smoker is dealing with high-
quality, well-designed pipes, almost every one will provide a good
smoke."

"The new smoker should not spend a lot of money in the beginning.
Only the most essential articles -- a pipe, tobacco, a tamper, and
cleaners -- need be purchased. One can then learn how to smoke
properly and become accustomed to using these basic items without
the confusion that results from having too many 'tools.' Also, if
one finds after an interval that he does not enjoy a pipe for one
reason or another, he will not have ventured more than $10 or $12
[$20 or $30 today]"

Ehwa recommends that the new smoker select a first pipe from one of
the many fine "seconds" of the better English, French, Danish,
Irish, and American pipemakers. He goes on to say that: "The
beginning pipe smoker should not concern himself with exploring all
types of tobaccos and pipes immediately, because he probably will
not notice the subtle differences of flavor and aroma that various
tobacco mixtures and pipes produce. Rather, he should concentrate
on how the pipe will smoke best for him."

"I suggest that you limit yourself at the beginning to medium-sized
bowls, as larger bowls will hold more tobacco than your appetite
will accommodate. Also they may be too heavy to be comfortable in
the mouth. . . . Thicker-walled pipes will be cooler to the hand
and heavier in weight than those with thinner walls. Pipes with
bent stems often will put less leverage on the mouth and, even if
they are a few ounces heavier than straight pipes, may be more
comfortable to hold in the mouth."

An aside: My experience with bent stems is that the sharper the
bend the more difficult it is to pass through a pipe cleaner,
particularly if the cleaner is made with soft wire. Cleaners from
Parkers of London are stiffer than those from Bryn Mawr Smokers
Sundries, say. In my early days with the pipe, I soon appreciated
the benefit of a bent stem. My first pipe was straight, but after
one or two experiences of sucking sludge from the heel of the bowl
into my mouth I changed to a pipe with curved stem. Today, I have
pipes bent and straight now that I have learnt how not to smoke
like a pirate, and to avoid over-moist tobacco.

Ehwa recommends: ". . .that the new smoker select a rather light-
bodied tobacco, such as a Cavendish, light English mixture,
straight Burley, Maryland, matured Virginia (English or Scottish),
or a high-quality aromatic mixture from a reputable tobacco shop.
By beginning with a high-grade tobacco, you will avoid problems you
may encounter with the majority of popular blends, which are
generally inferior both in the grade of tobaccos used and the
degree of attention to detail in cutting and seasoning. The light
tobaccos will be less irritating to the new smoker's mouth. Yet,
there are those who demand more fullness of flavor from the
beginning. Good, full mixtures are not harsh, but their rich flavor
has a tendency to wear the new smoker out, affecting him in much
the same way too much of a very rich dessert affects a diner." Here
he is suggesting that instead of being over-the-moon you'll be as
sick-as-a-parrot, so watch out.

"A cigarette smoker should consider himself a new smoker and follow
these guidlines. He in particular should stay with light tobaccos.
Cigarettes are almost always made from light, mild tobacco leaves
because they are less harsh to the throat and lungs. When one
smokes a cigarette, the pleasure he derives is not one of taste so
much as the physical exhilaration of the nicotine from the smoke
entering the blood through the lungs. The tongue and soft palate,
which are so important in pipe smoking, matter very little to the
cigarette smoker. When he begins smoking a pipe, he will react as
if he had never tasted smoke. Because he has developed the habit of
inhaling, it may be more difficult for him to get used to a pipe.
By choosing light tobaccos, the taste and feeling he will
experience from pipe smoking will not be terribly unlike that of
cigarette smoking. It is not uncommon for newly converted cigarette
smokers to inhale pipe smoke; when this happens, richer mixtures
are overwhelming."

An aside: I have heard of voracious smokers of cigarettes being
advised by their doctors to quit in favour of a pipe or cigar,
these being less injurious to health.

"Filling and Lighting the Pipe: One of the most important lessons
to learn is how to fill and light the pipe correctly. If the smoker
masters these first steps and practices other good smoking habits,
all of the rest eventally will fall into place. The smoker will
have no problem keeping his pipe lit and will then be free to enjoy
the taste of the tobacco, which will improve as the new pipe is
smoked."

"To insure a good smoke, one must create an even, close porosity
aomong the strands of tobacco so the pipe will draw almost as
evenly as a good cigar before lighting. There are, as far as I am
concerned, two methods of filling a pipe: the pinch method and my
own."

"With the pinch method, one fills the pipe in stages, making sure
that each third of the bowl is evenly and firmly packed down, from
the draft hole to the top. With my method, the smoker places enough
loose tobacco to fill the bowl in the palm of one hand, filling the
pipe by gently but firmly working the tobacco into the bowl with
the forefinger of his other hand until the bowl is filled slightly
over the top and the tobaccos feel firm when pressed (slightly
springy, as a cigarette does). The smoker should make certain the
tobacco strands are separated and free of clumps which would block
a free draft. This method avoids pressure around the draft hole,
permitting and easier draw throughout the smoke. In addition, the
tobacco will burn consistently, with little effort on the part of
the smoker. If the bowl has been filled correctly, it should draw
firmly, with a little resistance, and the smoker should be able to
hear a little air hissing through the pipe."

"In the case of very moist tobaccos, fill the pipe more loosly than
usual. Otherwise, they may pack down to densely, preventing a good
draft and making it necessary to refill the pipe."

"While drawing through the stem, light the pipe evenly across the
entire surface of the tobacco; then, take your tamper (not your
finger) and while you continue to draw, press the expanded tobaccos
down evenly all around the bowl until the pipe draws similarly to
a cigar -- firmly, with no air hissing though. The use of the
tamper will dampen the fire to a degree, so at this point relight
the pipe to get the entire surface of the tobacco burning again.
After this second lighting, your tobacco should burn evenly and
hence coolly, with little effort. You will probably have to tamp
again as the tobacco burns down, since it loosens as it is smoked.
Try to maintain the firmness of draw which you started throughout
the smoke. The process is quite easy to master, and with practice
will soon become effortless."

"When the pipe is packed too loosely, the tobacco burns
inconsistently and the smoker has to draw harder to keep it lit,
creating more heat. Soon there is nothing but moisture and heat
coming through the mouthpiece and the bowl may burn your hand. At
the opposite extreme is the pipe which is packed too firmly. It
won't burn at all, no matter what you do -- it is as hard to light
as a tightly rolled newspaper."

"Each tobacco type and cut will smoke slightly differently. The
broader, denser types of tobacco are harder to light but they burn
more slowly and are particularly good for outdoor smoking because
they are not so easily affected by wind as other types are. The
reverse is true of the finer cuts, and occassionally they are
difficult to handle. Use fine-cut tobaccos with care. They are
sometimes recommended for inexperienced smokers because they remain
lit no matter how poorly the pipe is filled, but they may blister
the tongue."

"These two extremes of cut are seldom used alone in preblended
tobaccos. They usually are incorporated in blends where their
burning qualities complement each other."

"When a bowl is filled and lighted properly so that it smokes
slowly and evenly, one can derive the intended taste from the
tobacco and consider both it and the pipe on their true merits.
Many pipes and tobaccos have been mercilessly condemned for causing
a variety of problems simple because the smoker failed to
understand and master these first steps."

Well, I think we will take another break here. In my next puff we
will read what Carl Ehwa, Junior, has to say about "Care of the
Pipe" and, finally, consider "Some Problems and Solutions."

Seasons Greeting from General Jym!

The "Smoker" at the ROMA this past Saturday Night was a wonderful success.
 The food was superb and from the early reports, the cigars were outstanding
and, as usual, the comraderie of fellow cigar smokers was great.  All who
attended had an unforgetable evening.

I wanted to let everyone know of my current travel plans to Central America.
 I am leaving Tuesday, December 13th for Costa Rica and points south.  I will
be gone for four to six weeks.  

For those of you who don't know,  I will be visiting numerous cigar factories
in my quest for the ideal cigars.  I will also be visiting the fincas, or
farms, where our coffee is grown to inspect this years crops, as well as my
usual tour of our roasting facilities.  This will be an easier trip, related
to coffee, since we perfected the blends that we are currently marketing in
the US.  I will also be visiting our chocolate factory where our Belgian
Chocolatier has produced numerous specialties for the Christmas season and
the New Year.

I will be sending everyone our Newsletter in early January updating you on
our activities and important upcoming events.  It will also have a review of
the December "Smoker" complete with Cigar Reviews from the event.

At this time,  I am not sure if I will have the same E-mail address through
the University of Costa Rica  as last time. I will try and keep you informed
if I do, if not, please continue to use my America Online address,
{??????????@???.???.}. 
I may be using my Compuserve address, {?????.????@??????????.???.}, but it is
much more expensive to access and use in Costa Rica, so lets all hope that I
have an e-mail address through the University or the Government to eliviate
these expences.  What ever happens, I will try and keep everyone informed.

Tis the season
Full of merriment and cheer,
Sigle malt scotches
And micro brewery beer.

So many people
Going so many places,
The season of giving
And smiling faces.

Remember to buckle up
And if you've had one too many,
Give your keys to a friend and take a taxi,
Spend a few extra pennies.

Where ever you go,
What ever you do,
Have a Merry Christmas
Relax and smoke a cigar
And have a Happy New Year Too!

I want to wish everyone a Happy and Healthy New Year!

Keep On Smokin'

<a name="17">Subject: My first (good) cigar.</a>

	This is actually my introduction message and a cigar story rolled 
into one.  (whoops, ....pun alert!)
	I work for a mid sized Sonoma county winery (I'm the landscape 
maintenance engineer. Hey, sounds important huh?  Ok,...gardener.) Last 
year, the president of the company handed out cigars after his wife had a 
baby.  Fonseca. (the cigar, not the baby)  Sounded very impressive and I 
decided to smoke it even though I am not a smoker and haven't smoked a 
cigar since high school.  And those were UGLY! Big, green, harsh,..but 
when you're drinking beer with your friends on the beach, they were the kind.
	After looking at the Fonseca for a couple of days, I decided to 
smoke it on friday night; as revenge.  My pool buddies were always 
smoking cigarettes while we played, almost choking me out of the room. 
	That night, after a few smoky games of pool, I whipped out the 
stogie and lit it up.  They both said "what the hell is that?"  I just 
puffed away.  Their cigarettes couldn't stand up to the prodigious smoke 
of the cigar and soon they were waving their hands before shots and 
yelling at me to "Put that lousy thing out!" (explitive deleted)  It was 
so funny that I could hardly stand it.
	Well, about a quarter the way through that cigar, I discovered 
that it was MUCH different from those ugly green things we used to smoke.
And I liked it.  At the time, I was drinking William Grants 12 yr old 
scotch on cracked Ice. I found that if I took a big puff of smoke into my 
mouth, let it out slowly, and then took a sip of ice cold scotch,...wow!
	With the aid of a couple more scotches, I smoked that cigar down 
to the ring and my friends out of the room.  I guess you could say that 
regenge is *sweet*.  
(Btw,...one of those guys now smokes cigars with me a couple times a week!)
	After that I started trying every different brand I could find 
before settling on Henry Clay and anything by Arturo Fuente.  I have even 
started a mowing ritual every thursday by lighting up a Henry Clay at 
about 8:00 and jumping on my riding mower.
	Well, enough for now, my wife just yelled that Seinfeld's on.

Two items of note. First, after hearing that they're defending our
right to keep and bear leaf, Your Moderator is now a card-carrying
member of the ACLU. I'd urge the U.S. members of the mailgroup to
support one of the few national organizations that is actively taking
our side in the fight against Prohibition. You can contact them at:

	American Civil Liberties Union
	123 West 43rd St.
	New York, NY 10109-1592

In a similar vein, I've also cancelled my subscription to Consumer
Reports, after seeing the front cover of the January issue. It's not
the first time they've engaged in smoker-bashing, and I (sensibly, I
believe) refuse to support organizations that persecute me.

But some happier news: It's Christmastime, and it's still possible to
find Cope's Escudo, B&amp;B, a warm fireside, and the companionship of
friends such as we have gathered here. Enjoy, and

				Smoke in peace,
				~\U Steve.

<a name="2">Subject: Stuff</a>

Dear Steve -

It's been awhile since I last communicated with the good folk in our group,
so I thought I'd check in with the latest.

First off, our recent pipe &amp; cigar Expo (Oct. 29 &amp; 30) was once again a big
hit.  We got a very good turnout, both by exhibitors and walk-in attendees.
 The facilities were excellent, the banquet was first-class, and a great time
was had by all!  I wrote an article on the Expo which will be appearing in
the holiday issue of the A &amp; M Gazette.  I'll pass it along to you on e-mail
soon.

Meanwhile, us California smokers are royally bummed out over Prop. 188's
defeat.  I recently found out that our Republicrat governer Pete Wilson
secretly supported 188, even though he signed the statewide smoking ban into
law.  Ironic, huh?  Could it be that he signed AB 13 'cause it was an
election year?  Naw!!!  Which makes me wonder - why doesn't our "golden"
state have people like Gingrich, Gramm, Armey or Alexander?  Well, at least
we now have Tom Bliley in Congress.  BTW, for those of you who don't
understand the implications of this fact - Bliley being the new chair of the
Health &amp; Environment subcomitttee is the first serious setback the
anti-smokers have been dealt since they started gaining serious power under
Koop in the '80s.  Since he's a pipe smoker I'm going to send him my research
on the medical literature concerning pipe and cigar smoking.  Mebbe, just
mebbe, he'd like to investigate how officialdom has been treating us.  It's
worth a shot!

I saw your inquiry on the meaning of mortality ratios.  Basically the
mortality ratio describes any difference in death rates between groups of
people.  In smoking studies the mortality ratio of 1.0 for nonsmokers is used
as the constant.  Therefore, if you see a study which states that the
mortality ratio for lung cancer in cigarette smokers is 10.0 it means that
for every nonsmoker who dies of lung cancer 10 cigarette smokers die of that
disease.  And speaking of research...

I recently made a breakthrough with the acqisition of a work called "the
Toxicology of Pipe Smoking".  TPS is the work of one John Trestrail, III, a
pipe smoker and toxicologist working out of Blodgett Memorial Medical Center
in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  Dr. Trestrail has compiled a bibliography of all
published medical literature dealing with the health effects of pipe and
cigar smoking, including a summary of each study's findings.  This is without
doubt a valuable resource guide, but be forewarned - Dr. Trestrail makes NO
commentary on the quality of these studies in terms of soundness of the
methodology, validity of conclusions, etc.  

When I have enough time (which, I suspect, will probably be in my next life)
I will gather the source studies cited in TPS for evaluation.  I did, however
find that in perusing the conclusions of the studies he lists, a number of
very interesting questions come up.  I won't go into detail now, but what I
find is that the deeper one goes into the realm of pure research the more
uncertainty one finds, especially when considering the issues of anecdotal
data and the myriad variables which often get overlooked.  I will say this:
 Although TPS lists more studies than I previously knew existed I still stand
behind everything I wrote in my "Pipes, Cigars and Public Policy" article.
 What I have learned through TPS has only strengthened my conviction that we
MUST critically examine the medical data on our pursuit, and that we have
nothing to fear by what we'll find.  For those of you who'd like to contact
Dr. Trestrail regarding TPS you can e-mail him at:  ????????@??????.???.

And now onto a more pleasant subject, namely fine tobaccos.  Dittoes to those
of you singing the praises of Cope's Escudo - lovely stuff!  I first tried
Escudo at the tender age of 21, after only 5 months as a pipe smoker, and
fell in love with it from the very first bowl.  I have a tin which I bought
about 7 years ago.  It's staying in my "vintage" collection to be enjoyed
(along with some original Rattray's) at a later time.  For the gentleman from
England lamenting about the lack of Escudo on his side of the "herring pond",
he may want to try JR Tobacco (here in the colonies) at (800)572-4427.  I
don't know if JR ships overseas, but they have it in their latest catalogue,
so he might want to give 'em a shout.  I'm also partial to Dunhill
Elizabethan mixture, especially in clay pipes.  In fact my favorite
Thanksgiving day smoke is Elizabethan in a Goudewaagen churchwarden (the
Goudewaagen has a nice, big bowl, as opposed to those stupid Zeniths with a
bowl about the size of a thimble).  I can just hear some of you out there
thinking "Elizabethan?  In a clay??  The guy's nuts!!!"  But yes, if you're
like me, with a rather sturdy constitution (I've never gotten sick from a
pipe) the experience is quite delightful.  And speaking of delightful...

I have been acquainting myself with the McClelland private reserve blends
available through Levin Pipes International.  Definitely worth looking into,
as there is some really good stuff here.  There are 3 categories of tobaccos:
 Matured oriental mixtures, matured Virginias and 
fragrant matured Virginia blends.  I've worked my way through the fragrant
matured Virginias, and I especially recommend Grey Havens, Moria Gate and
Deep Elm, as well as Trollshaws, which is a Latakia mixture with a unique
flavor.  LPI has samplers of the McClelland Private reserve blends, with
enough for 1 or 2 loads of each of the tobaccos.  The samplers are reasonably
priced, and a great way to try out this superb line.

LPI is now being run by Barry Levin's widow, Kathy.  In case she's not yet in
the resource guide here are the particulars:  Levin Pipes International, 6113
Abbey Rd., Aptos, CA  95003.  The phone # is 408-477-0140.  As I sit here
composing this I'm enjoying some of their St. James flake in one of my
calabashes, along with tonight's breezy and cold (yes, it does get chilly in
winter here in southern California!) weather.  To quote a well-known beer
commercial - it doesn't get any better than this!

Anyway, Steve, I'm really enjoying the pipes digest.  The pipe and cigar
forum here on AOL has deterioriated, so I'm grateful that we have our
InterNet group.  This is definitely where the quality's at!  Keep up the good
work!

Best Regards und Gute Rauchen,

Steve Johnson (aka Briar Man) 

[ New York City has also enacted something like Prop. 188. Of course,
all their problems with crime, smog, and gridlock must be solved,
since they have spare time to persecute us in... Good news about
Bliley, though! Looking forward to more about Trestrail's work. -S. ]

Dear all

I recently came across a very nice pipe/tobacco catalogue, which is
definitley worth seeing; it is the mail order catalogue of

	Dan Pipe Frickert &amp; Behrens KG
	Curslacker Deich 136
	21039 Hamburg
	Germany
	Fax: +49 40 723 35 39

The well-made catalogue (in color) has over 200 pages, thereof about 40
pages offering tobacco and 20 pages cigars; the rest shows a nice
collection of pipes, like Stanwell, Savinelli, Peterson, Brebbia,
Bentley, Holger, L.Wood, Ser Jacopo, Butz-Choquin, Falcon, etc. Most
pictures are showing the pipes at they natural size.

Unfortunately, about 90 % of all pipes are offered as filter pipes for
9mm filters, reflecting the situation in the German pipe market. Only
some of the high-grade pipes (Bentley, L.Wood, Holger, etc) can be
ordered as non-filter versions.

Best
	Joachim.

[ Wow! -S. ]

Have been reading the digest for a few weeks now and can't tell you
how much I enjoy it. Reading the digest is almost as good as lighting
up as far as relaxation is concerned. I don't know if it's proper to
ask help me type questions here but I have trouble geting a good cake
to form near the botton of the bowl in all my pipes. I have about
fifteen assorted pipie ranging from Ascorti, Cammeneto, Savinally, and
Costello. I clean the pipes after each use and they seem to smoke
smooth untill I get near the boottom and then they get pretty
wet. After cleaning I keep them on a rack with a fan blowing on them
contineously to hasten the drying process. I've never had any
instructions or read much on proper care so what I'm doing I've just
stumbled into. Any suggestions?

                                Thanks, Jim Varnon

[ Sounds like you're doing great, Jim! Above and beyond the call of
duty. A lot of tobacco smokes wet near the end; just try easing off
the humidification a little bit and see what happens. -S. ]

<a name="8">Subject: Carey's and Jerri's</a>

Steve,
	Thanks for digest 168.  Jeez!  A week without a digest!  I 
didn't realize how addicted I was!
	I'd like to relate my recent experience with Carey's Smokeshop
in Ohio.  (If you consider this a flame then please feel free not to 
include it in the next digest).
	My wife, bless her, for the first time in our 15 years of 
marriage, wanted to buy me a pipe for my 41st birthday which was in late
October.  (I think my wife has resigned herself, finally, to the fact 
that I'm not going to give up my pipes!  It's a case of "love me, love
my pipes").  I chose a Savinelli Hercules from the Carey's catalog which
really caught my eye.  My wife called on October 24 to place the order. 
She was told that since this was not their own brand they had not had 
many in stock and had run out and would have to back order - "should
be 2 to 3 weeks."  Three and a half weeks later I called to see if they
had received their shipment.  No, "should be 2 to 3 more weeks."  Being
a pipe smoker, I'm the patient sort.  I waited until Dec. 9 and called
again.  Still no shipment, and no idea when they might get their shipment.
So, I canceled my order.  I figure that waiting nearly 7 weeks for anything
is long enough.  Even patient pipe smoking types have their limits.
	I will not order from them again.  I understand that they are 
dependent on Savinelli (and/or their distributor in the U.S.), but it's
annoying to be strung along.  I would have appreciated a note after 4 or 
5 weeks telling me of the delay and asking if I wanted to continue to wait.
I've written a note to Bill Miller, the president of Carey's about my 
complaint.  I'll see if I get any response and let you know.  (BTW, I've 
tried Carey's sampler pack of English blend tobaccos and did not like 
them.  They didn't have any "character".  Tasted flat.  And when I placed
that order they were out of stock on it too!!  Their own house blends!!
That was only a wait of 2 weeks).  What with the pressure on smokers
nowadays, I would think that any smokeshop would bend over backwards
trying to please their customers.  This experience just left me shaking
my head in frustration and disbelief.
	However, on a brighter note, I finally did go to Jerri's 
Tobacco Shop here in Denver for my birthday pipe, and bought a very
nice quality pipe on the advice of the friendly fellow in the shop
(not Jerri, I'm afraid I can't remember his name), a "Bartoli" - from 
a small Italian pipe maker, he said, that Jerri himself had bought in 
quantity when he was still traveling the world in search of good briar
pipes.  I also left a favorite Butz Choquin there for a stem replacement
too.  I'll pick that up this afternoon (one day, not counting yesterday,
a Sunday, after dropping it off!!).  BTW, Jerri's does mail order (they're
reputable, they've been around Denver since 1955).  If you could add them
to the Resource Guide, I'd appreciate it:

		Jerri's Tobacco Shop
		1616 Glenarm Bldg.
		Denver, CO
		303-825-3522

	I haven't yet tried their house blends, but you can bet that I'll
be back.  I've learned my lesson about personal service!  Will let you 
know what I think of their blends in the future.
	Well, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year and many pleasant 
holiday bowlfulls to you all!

 K#@&gt; Pipes Digest #160 -- October 3, 1994

 K#@&gt; Lapsang Souchong is a tea from the Middle Country's Fujian
 K#@&gt; province. It has a smoky or tarry taste derived from the wood of the
 K#@&gt; white fir-tree used for curing the tea. At least, that was the case
 K#@&gt; before the war, stuffs other than white-fir are used these
 K#@&gt; days. Nevertheless, the tea tastes good, going quite well with that
 K#@&gt; pipe full of BS759.

        I would agree with that! I didn't care too much for the LS but
Emerald Lady is a fan. I thought I saw a brand besides Twining's at
the grocery store, but I must have been another brand, direct from a
Chinese grocer at one point. No, Sir, I didn't like it!

 K#@&gt; Speaking of
 K#@&gt; colored briars Savenelli is producing an "alligator" line of blue and
 K#@&gt; green pipes.

        Yes, but I still like the green briar Big Ben one in the
Thompson catalog. By the way, speaking of Savinellis
the Nashua NH smokeshop (Newsshop) and was impressed. Many had nice
bird's-eye/straight grain patterns, and they were about $80 in shapes I
liked. The grain was so nice I'd consider a Canadian or poker straight
style! I looked at some Petersons and I wasn't as impressed...hmm.

        I also checked out the Meerschaums they sold. I didn't pick any
up -- just stared through the case. Nice, but I do prefer the geometric
pattern carvings more than the Sultan heads. It's just me. &lt;grin&gt; The
geo ones were about $80 too... Emerald Lady said I'd probably prefer an
Art Deco one! Maybe she's right....maybe I should carve my own, too --
because there ain't no Art Deco to be found around here nowadays. There
must be some voracious AD collector somewhere.

        I also checked out the (2) calabashes they had. Nice ones,
both about the same size, no silver rings, about $80. After hearing
about how cool they smoke, and since the meerschaum bowls will color
nicely, maybe I'll celeb (if I get it) with one. We'll see!

 K#@&gt; If you haven't tried Cuban
 K#@&gt; tobacco, expect not to love it.  You might as well try it just to say
 K#@&gt; you have had the real thing; but, it has a strong earthy flavor that
 K#@&gt; makes the cheapest burley taste like cavendish.  Just remember, I
 K#@&gt; smoke latakia and love the old Ratray's stuff and Cuban is too strong
 K#@&gt; for me.

        Yeow. I bet you like Lapsang Souchong, too! I will have to try
ONE Cuban cigar once I get my butt up to Canada someday...

 K#@&gt; Subject: "The Official Smokescreen"

 K#@&gt; The results for pipe smokers were surprising: According to
 K#@&gt; the study, pipe smokers outlive nonsmokers by an average of two years!
 K#@&gt; Even more surprising were the findings that heavy pipe smoking did not
 K#@&gt; change this, and that pipe smokers don't seem to gain any longevity
 K#@&gt; benefit by quitting.  While the study was good news for pipe and cigar
 K#@&gt; smokers, its data never appeared in the reports made by Surgeon
 K#@&gt; General C. Everett Koop.

        Well, this could be good news for us...but a human life is more
complex than a smoking machine and a lung blotter to measure and
analyze. A casual p
s pipe in relaxation...away
from the cares of life. It's difficult to tend a pipe while you're
involved in some stressful task. A cigarette, on the other hand, is made
for a hectic lifestyle. Suck that smoke down into your lungs to calm
down....or something like that. It's a complex equation -- but my guess
is that people who feel the need to smoke cigarettes have other factors
involved in their early deaths than just cigarette smoke...and the smoke
of burning bleached cigarette paper.

        But I'd still like to see some hard data about pipe smokers and
mouth cancer.

 K#@&gt; Hi! My name is Christopher D. Walborn. I am a 20 year old student

 K#@&gt; I, too, am among the brotherhood of bearded smokers. No goateed
 K#@&gt; twenty-something here: a nice, full, red manly-man beard against brown
 K#@&gt; hair. I like to sit and smoke and think intelligent thoughts.

        So do I....say "duh," if you must, but say it at the appropriate
time. No, I don't have a beard now, but I have had a cheshire beard over
the years. Here today, gone next month or two. In a bout of
assertiveness over my facial geography I have shaved off my mustache. I
agree with my critics: I look better with it on. I shall grow it back if
I get the job I've been seeking...don't want to look scruffy before
 basket. And like you, my hair is brown and my beard
reddish.

 K#@&gt; Regardless of my pure-air family upbringing I have always, from
 K#@&gt; the time I was a small child, loved pipes. I knew nobody that smoked a
 K#@&gt; pipe, but an older gentleman smoking a pipe has always seemed a type of
 K#@&gt; the wonderously warm and kindly.

        I would agree there. My Uncle Gardner smoked a pipe and I used
to love it when he'd visit. I sniffed his cold pipe, once, sitting on
the kitchen table -- ack. The aroma of the burning tobacco was
beautiful, though -- much better than my mother's Bel Airs and my dad's
Vantages. I wish I could ask my Aunt Nyrhe what he smoked, but I'm
afraid she's in a nursing home with Alzheimer's Disease. (I just found
out.) A shame... Gardner wasn't especially kind to me as a child, but
he never raised his voice, and I did love the smell of that pipe.

        Among other weird things, I like antique radios and Art Deco
items. Well, Philip Collins has done two excellent paperback photo books
on Art Deco Radios! RADIOS, THE GOLDEN AGE, and RADIOS REDUX. Both are
great, and the photos are excellent.

        I've just discovered that he has done one on smoking
accessories.

        I think it was called Smokiana or something like that.
Definitely Collins as the author, and definitely Chronicle Books as
the publisher. No....there weren't many pipes in it, but lots of
smoking type stuff from the 20s, 30s, and 40s. Art Deco galore. Check
it out.

        I also saw a book just on collectible matchbooks.

        Let me know if you see any pipe books in print!

 ~ Blue Wave/QWK v2.12 ~Flea market finds
Andy Wallace #6 @9201
Mon Oct 24 10:05:53 1994

I went to the Hollis NH flea yesterday.... I had intended to go to the antique 
flea there, after seeing a nicely carved briar there. It was in the shape of a 
Civil War soldier, and had very nice birdseye/straight grain pattern... But 
alas, that flea had closed for the year!
Well, the other one yielded some finds. I got a pipe reamer (what do those 
normally go for?) for $4, which appears to have never been used. It's a B.A.C. 
Machine Co. (of Boston) one. I can't find a date on the paperwork or box but 
I'd guess 1950s or earlier...

The other find, for $3, was a meerschaum pipe in a case! It's a smooth 
(uncarved) Full Bent style. It had been smoked, and fairly heavily I'd guess. 
The case says "genuine meerschaum" and "real amber." The area of the 
meerschaum towards the stem is yellowed, but the bowl appeared to be without 
wax, and much lighter. The inside of the bowl was black but not built up with 
carbon. 

Rapaport's COMPLETE GUIDE TO COLLECTING ANTIQUE PIPES said to used alcohol 
(carefully) to clean meerschaum pipes, and that this would remove some wax. I 
said, what the heck, and used some... It did clean the outside, and now I see 
that the bowl is more shiny than it was. I wonder if it just had a hazy film, 
or if the alcohol moved the wax around from the other areas. I'm going to find 
some beeswax and see if I can re-wax it. I don't know how old this pipe is. 
The wax could be the "old" style, which contained beeswax and whale oil... 
It looks like the previous owner might have held it in his hand while smoking, 
and that's why only part of the wax took a color.
I don't know if I'll smoke it, but it was sure a bargain and worthy of 
experimentation. 

What have you folks found at fleas/garage sales?

ABOUT: 163    1/2

 K#@&gt; From: ????????@??????.???.??? (John A. Klimowicz)

 K#@&gt; Steve, 

 K#@&gt; I've only been on the internet for a few weeks.  I really
 K#@&gt; appreciate the digest.  It lets me know I'm not the only "tail
 K#@&gt; end baby boomer" smoking a pipe.

 K#@&gt; I've only been smoking a pipe since my 30th birthday in September
 K#@&gt; of this year. I figured I should do something with my birthday money
 K#@&gt; that I wouldn't usually do.  My Uncle and Grandfather used to smoke
 K#@&gt; pipes and I really missed that smell.

        Aha! Me too -- started around New Year's Day of this year.
Bought a $3 corncob and a pouch of Ultra Lite at C.V.S. The most
expensive thing was a $10 pipe Zippo lighter -- but I still use that.
Since then I've graduated to other pipes, but my two favorites are my
bent Falcons.

 K#@&gt; Now I'm hooked on it.  I smoke 2-3 times a day and love every
 K#@&gt; minute of it.  

        I smoke about twice in the evening,
y
back stairwell. (I won't smoke in the apartment.)

 K#@&gt; I still haven't been able to smoke a whole bowl while holdind the
 K#@&gt; pipe between my teeth.  Maybe I'm not clenching it correctly???

        I don't like to do that anyway. I prefer to hold the bowl gently
in my left hand. This keeps the pipe cooler (feedback on how hot it's
getting!) and I'm never worried about burning a bowl through. Of course,
I'm probably not getting the carbon built up properly but with a Falcon
I don't think that's as important. They have aluminum cooling stems.

 K#@&gt; I'm always looking forward to the next digest.  I would love to
 K#@&gt; hear more about the other members who are in their 20s and 30s that
 K#@&gt; may have felt like the only ones their age smoking a pipe.

        Well, I haven't smoked mine in public, so you never know! I did
discover a fellow at work with a battered Falcon straight pipe which he
has enjoyed for 10 or more years.

[ Sounds like the Briar Bowl is also quite an active group! If you
give me some more details on what/where it (and WWIV) are, I'll put an
entry in the Resource Guide. If someone sends me Wilke's address, I'll
put that in too. And, last and least, I've also wondered about the
word "Habanero". -S. ]

<a name="10">Subject: FAQs and Tobaccos</a>

Having recently become a smoker of cigars in addition to my pipes I was
wondering whether or not there was a FAQ concerning cigars as there is one
concerning pipes. I am aware of--and possess--the FAQ on Humidors; this is,
indeed, delightful information, but I am wanting to learn about the cigars
themselves. I suppose that eventually I will find Hacker's book on cigars,
but being on a low budget at the moment, a FAQ seems just the thing.

I would also be interested in similar information regarding specific tobacco
blends, i.e. commercial. I am wanting to venture a bit further than the few
blends my tobacconist offers and the only other local possibility is the drug
store fare, to which I say, "No thank you." Having been down on my luck and
lost my 2oz bag of aromatic and not having time to drive 45 minutes to my
tobacconist, I settled for a purchase of Amphora red. I figured that even
cheap stuff would be better than no stuff...

It is a good thing I had not started out with the drug store pipe and tobacco
the way many of you brave (and longsuffering) souls did; had I started out
with Amphora I would most likely *not* be smoking today. The tobacco was
dryish and oily and smelled like decomposing roses, the smoke was even worse.

I recently purchased a tin of Dunhill Standard Mixture Mild. I have tried
only one other blend including latakia, and the other tobaccos of the mixture
were the standard tobaccos of other aromatic blends rather than the exotic
Turkish tobaccos of Dunhill. This "other" blend was a loose tobacco-jar blend
offered by my tobacconist. I like it well enough, though I must be in the
proper mood to smoke it. The Dunhill seemed to have less flavor and a greatly
more offensive smoke. I had never had the experience of anyone criticizing
the aroma of my pipe, including the times that I smoke the latakia
blend--though they did say it was a bit harsher than my other smokes, but not
unpleasant--until I lit up the bowl of Dunhill. What do others of the group
think of the Dunhill Standard Mild? Are other "English" blends substantially
more pleasant than this blend in your opinions? I've heard mention of Cope's
Escudo and of Bengal Slices. Are these greatly superior? How do I go about
obtaining these blends?

I noticed that in early issues of the Digest our gracious moderator suggested
a system of judging tobaccos. If anyone has made a habbit of so recording
their smokes I would be greatly interested in their records.

Well, enough imposing for one letter.

Thanks to all that recommended the estate pipe market, especially Steve Wyman. 
Picked up a few pipes in the past few months that I really like.  First got a
Savinelli "Golden Jubilee" bent bulldog from Edwards (that I probably paid too
much for, I don't know).  First bulldog I procured, and I think that style is
growing on me.  Along that line, I broke down and purchased an Ashton Sovereign
XX bulldog from Nikos Levin.  One thing that I like about Nikos over Edwards is
that he puts a tape measure on the bottom of each photograph to give you some
scale to the displayed pipes.  That Ashton is probably the best pipe I own now,
it smokes great, and is the first straight stemmed pipe I have owned, having
restricted all my previous pipes to the bent stem variety.  I will now keep my
eyes open for a good Upshall from Nikos as soon as he gets the December mailing
out.

BTW, I was sorting through the past issues of Pipe Digest to compile a brand by
brand listing of tobaccos, the types of tobaccos used in the blend, and any
reader comments, including mail-order sources.  Has anyone done something
similar to this yet?  It would be neat to have a pipe tobacco "database" to
help poor slobs like me avoid stronger latakia-based tobaccos that I can't
stomach yet.  I don't know, for someone like me with no access to a real
"tobacconist", I can't immediately divine what is in, for instance, Rattray's
"Accountant's Mixture", not being a Royal Chartered Accountant (then again I'm
not a lion-tamer either, apologies to Monty Python)

		   Are you still smoking your pipe?

Another report form a doctor's surgery -- the Revd. Garvin Fargus from
Ballachulish reporting on a personal experience.

Doctor:	"Are you still smoking your pipe?"

Patient: (contritely) "Yes."

Doctor:	"Good."

Patient: "What do you mean 'Good'?"

Doctor:	"Well, the latest research has shown that pipe-smoke is
	prophylactic against the development of bacterial infection of
	the chest." 

By coincidence I read the following recently in the Birmingham Post
which quoted the chest journal Thorax: "Researchers studied coughing
habits and discovered that light pipe-smokers coughed no more than
non-smokers." Just occasionally the doctors come up with some sensible
comments which, to be honest, we've noticed for ourselves. These do
lessen the cloud of guilt which the health publicists spread around.
Bad news too, for the no smoking, no drinking zealots is that
cardiologists are encouraging people with heart disease to drink a
glass or two of red wine a day. And the latest dietary advice I've
seen is that goose and foie gras are probably excellent for those with
cholesterol problems. Apparently those areas of France where they love
these things are heart attack free.

Smoke Signal #10
December 13, 1994
?????@???.???.???

Pipes Digest #168 reminded me of my time in the Netherlands, a very
friendly and picturesque country. One of several things that stick
in my memory of Holland is the general cleanliness of the place.
Once, I travelled by train from there to England. Dutch trains are
clean, well-kept, run by smartly turned out staff, in marked
contrast to ramshackle British Rail with its greasily unkempt, surly
employees. As an Englishman, I have license to chastise my native
institutions, but if you think this paragraph is too warm, Steve,
then delete it by all means.

Anyway, let's bash onward to the end of "The Book of Pipes and
Tobacco" by Carl Ehwa, Junior, and his section on "Care of the
Pipe." Although this book is out of print there remain some copies
in the used-book market. My local second-hand bookseller has located
a copy for me priced at $20. Any copy of this book will be a worthy
addition to anyone's library.

"In general, briar, meerschaum, and calabash pipes should be treated
the same way. If the smoker regards all of his pipes as delicate,
and if he consistently cleans, reams, and rests them, he should
always be able to get a good smoke from those that are well suited
to his taste and habits."

"Smokers who break stems, shanks and bowls consistently, or who
complain about the sour smell of their pipes, obviously are pushing
them beyond their capacity to endure punishment. Care in cleaning
out the ashes left in the bowl after each smoke with a pipe tool,
rather than hammering them out, will be rewarded. There will be a
better chance of the bowl remaining unscarred and the frequency with
which stems and shanks are broken will be greatly reduced. If the
bowl is reamed out frequently, char is prevented from building to a
thickness that could reduce the pipe's capacity and increase the
danger of its splitting or cracking. It will also prove time-saving
in the long run, for each reaming will take just seconds rather than
the minutes required for a postponed reaming."

"The smoker should clean his pipe after every smoke, if possible.
Scoop out the ashes with the pipe tool, then run a pipe cleaner
through the stem and shank, using both ends of the cleaner. Next,
bend the cleaner into a loop that will fit the bowl and swab it out
to remove residual particles of tobacco and ash, and also to absorb
any remaining moisture."

"If the pipe has been allowed to get really dirty, the smoker should
use an alcohol-based pipe freshener to break down the tar in the
shank. Then he should scour the inside of the channel with a pipe
brush and, finally, use enough cleaners to finish the job. Always
remember to keep the mortise area at the end of the shank clean,
since foul-flavored tars and oils get trapped there. The bone screw
of the meerschaum pipe should be kept clean for the same reason. If
residue builds up in the area where the stem connects with the
shank, pressure could cause the shank to crack, the tenon to shrink
(which might create a loose stem), or, in the case of a bone
connector, the stem to become misaligned."

"Generally, if a smoker uses a preventive maintenance approach to
reaming, he will merely have to scrape away the char with the
reaming blade of a smoker's knife. If the residue is allowed to
build up to over the thickness of a nickel, however, a major job may
await the smoker. For a messy pipe, one should buy a heavy-duty
reamer -- such as the flange reamer -- in a fixed size that will fit
the bowl. Heavy-duty reamers will seldom cut the carbon to a proper
thickness on all the smoker's pipes because they are designed for
medium-sized bowls only. The only other reamers on the market that
can do an adequate, heavy-duty job are the Savinelli and the Ream-
and-Clean adjustable reamers which come with a useful shank reamer."

"The char that develops within the bowl of a pipe must be
controlled, but some is necessary, particularly in the case of briar
pipes. A safe thickness of char -- that of a dime, or even a nickel
for one who smokes very hard -- is needed to protect the inner wall
from repeated exposure to a burning ember. The best type of char
buildup, or cake, consists of an even, firmly grained carbon that
will absorb evenly and be durable. To create the ideal kind of cake,
fill the pipe properly, using a tamper to pack the tobacco in firmly
and evenly."

"People who smoke heavily flavored and cased tobaccos will find that
they build a soft cake, despite good smoking habits. Sometimes the
char is so soft and porous that it can be peeled out with a knife,
like the rind of an orange. The smoker who tends to build this type
of cake should take the convex spoon end of his pipe tool and, while
turning the bowl, press hard against the soft carbon to compress it
against the wall of the pipe."

"Another type of char that develops is characteristically pitted and
uneven. It generally chips away in spots, leaving portions of the
bowl unprotected and creating an uneven pressure against the inner
wall. This type of char is a direct result of improper filling and
smoking. The best remedy is to cut the carbon back until it is even
and then begin filling the pipe properly and using a tamper when
smoking."

"Ocassionally the char builds up in the top portion of the bowl and
not at the bottom, or vise versa. This results from smoking only
part of a full bowl or consistently filling the bowl only halfway.
The smoker who develops this sort of cake should buy a few smaller
bowled pipes."

"Regardless of how often a pipe is cleaned, it must be well rested
to allow the moisture that has been absorbed during smoking to
evaporate. Discover for yourself, if you must, the consequences of
smoking a pipe constantly: The smoke will lack flavor and taste
exceptionally host and wet. Tobaccos taste much better in a rested
pipe."

"Pipes should be smoked in rotation and be given a weeks rest after
each full day of smoking. The owner of a large collection should
alternate three or four pipes each day. In this way, no single pipe
will be overworked, avoiding a gradual deterioration of taste
towards the end of the day."

"A pipe should be rested bowl down, in as nearly a vertical position
as possible. This allows moisture to run from the shank into the
larger space of the bowl, where it will evaporate more quickly. Do
not leave a pipe cleaner in the shank and stem of a pipe. The
cleaner will, of course, absorb moisture, but if it is left in the
pipe the moisture cannot evaporate. Air moving through an open
channel will allow the pipe to dry out much faster. When a smoker
reams and cleans his pipes properly and allows them to rest, his
entire collection will produce the taste he seeks from his
tobaccos."

That's that for Carl Ehwa on caring for the pipe. Now let us read
what he has to say about possible problems and the solutions to
those problems.

"Some Problems and Solutions: If one is ill, or taking medication,
[the] pipe will not taste as good as it should. This also holds true
when one is excessively tired. Even mints or gum often will alter
the smoker's ability to taste accurately. Keep these facts in mind;
they often go unnoticed and because of them many smokers have formed
impressions of different pipes and tobaccos which are unjust to the
products."

"_Problem:_ The tongue and mouth are always sore (tingling,
burning).
_Solution:_ This generally is a problem confined to the new smoker
whose tongue and mouth naturally are quite sensitive. If the
soreness persists for more than two or three weeks, it probably can
be traced to the fact that the smoker hasn't developed good smoking
habits. The most common cause of this prolonged irritation is the
smoker's failure to fill and light the pipe properly. Other causes
might be: smoking too hard and fast, thus creating an excessive
amount of heat which burns the tongue and mouth, or smoking a
tobacco unsuited to the individual's taste. Filling and lighting a
pipe improperly may not only cause an almost unbearable scorching of
the tongue, but lead to pipe damage as well, such as splitting or a
burned-out bowl."

"_Problem:_ The tongue is sore only at the end of the day.
_Solution:_ Heavy smokers frequently experience this irritation. In
order to remedy this situation, consider the possibility of either
smoking less or going to a broader-cut tobacco which will last
longer in the bowl, naturally smoking cooler. One also might
consider switching to a smoother, 'natural' tobacco, or perhaps a
mixture with fuller flavor which will be more satisfying with fewer
bowls than light mixtures tend to be. If none of these suggestions
seems to solve the problem, the smoker could be smoking too many
bowls in any one of his pipes, not allowing them to rest."

"_Problem:_ The pipe tastes flavorless, sour, hot, and wet, and also
smells foul.
_Solution:_ Even though the smoker cleans and reams his pipes
properly, they will present him with this problem if he does not
give them an adequate rest. When the pipe is saturated with moisture
is saturated with moisture and tars, it can no longer perform its
task of extracting the various harsh elements from the tobacco by
absorbing them. The smoker will complain that his tobacco bites and
that the smoke is wet. In addition, if he doesn't clean and ream his
pipes properly, they will begin to smell unpleasantly."

"_Problem:_ The pipe smokes to wet.
_Solution:_ Besides the reasons given in the preceding paragraph,
this problem could also be caused by an extremely damp or heavily
flavored tobacco. Or, in poorer quality pipes, it is possible that
the draft hole is off-center or too low. If so, particularly in the
latter case, one will find more moisture in the smoke. There is no
remedy for this problem. All you can do is throw the pipe away.
Another cause which seldom is considered is that in humid climates
or during damp periods of the year, any smoke or air that goes
through the pipe has a higher moisture content, which condenses in
the stem. Furthermore, if the smoker fills his pipe too loosely and
fails to tamp the tobacco after it is lit, he will find he has to
draw on the pipe much harder and more often to keep it lit. As he
draws, the bowl and smoke become extremely hot, while the channel 
in the stem is cooled by the drafts passing through it. Condensation
of this especially hot smoke in the cool stem chamber will cause a
wetter smoke."

"_Problem:_ It is hard to keep the pipe lit.
_Solution:_ While the smoker occasionally can blame an exceptionally
moist tobacco for this problem, the more common cause is that he has
not learned how to fill and light the pipe correctly. On occasion,
a smoker will complain that the broader-cut tobaccos are hard or
impossible for him to keep lit. He too probably fails to take proper
care in filling and lighting his pipes. The smoker should realize
also that his pipes should be cleaned regularly, since any blockage
of the draft hole or channel by a buildup of tars or tobacco
particles will make a free draft impossible."

"_Problem:_ The smoke does not seem to last long enough for the
capacity of the bowl.
_Solution:_ This again generally is caused by improper filling and
lighting. If one does not fill the pipe firmly enough and tamp the
tobacco after it is lit, his fill will burn faster and, of course,
not last as long as it should." Another cause of this problem could
be exceptionally hard smoking or smoking outdoors in the wind. I
suggest that the smoker buy a broader cut of tobacco which will
smoke cooler and slower. Also, if the smoker does not ream his bowls
and allows the carbon to build up beyond a sixteenth of an inch, he
naturally will have a shorter smoke because of the reduced capacity
of the bowl."

"_Problem:_ The tobacco does not burn evenly across the top. Rather,
it tends to burn down the center or down one side of the bowl.
_Solution:_ This is another problem caused by imiproper filling and
lighting. When this occurs, the damage it does, besides wasting
tobacco, often goes undetected by the smoker until it is too late.
This problem will cause the carbon cake to build up unevenly within
the bowl, interfering with a smooth draft by constricting the fill
(much the same as pinching a cigar while smoking it would) and
causing uneven pressure on the bowl which ultimately could lead to
its splitting. The most frequent cause of an uneven burn is a fill
which is too loose or unevenly firm. Take care to avoid letting
tight clumps of tobacco form when filling the bowl."

"_Problem:_ The bowl gets very hot when smoked indoors.
_Solution:_ This is a result of not filling the bowl firmly. The
increased heat caused by over-drawing is conducted to the outer
surface of the bowl and, whether you are smoking a thin or thick
walled pipe, the heat will be intense. One who smokes very hard also
may have this problem. The solution is to go to the broader cuts
which smoke slower and therefore cooler. The smoker who prefers a
finer cut will have to accept the fact that it will always produce
a somewhat hotter smoke."

"_Problem:_ The bowl gets very hot when smoked outdoors.
_Solution:_ When a smoker is outdoors and active, he probably smokes
somewhat harder. This hard smoking, along with a wind or a breeze
created by movement, will increase the burning rate of your
tobaccos, creating excessive heat both in the pipe and mouth. Even
if you are not active, the wind -- if it is strong enough -- can
cause the bowl to overheat. Mixtures containing cube-cut or cut-plug
tobaccos, or broad-cut straight tobaccos, or cut cakes (flakes),
sliced rolls, and so forth are excellent because they burn slower
under these conditions, keeping your pipe and tongue cooler."

"_Problem:_ The capacity of the bowl is small because of a very
thick cake.
_Solution:_ A smoker should not allow this to happen because
pressure on the bowl over a period of time could split or crack the
wall. You should not allow more than one-sixteenth of an inch of
char evenly covering the inside wall of the bowl. It is better to
maintain the cake at this level than to let it build up farther and
then having to ream it out."

"_Problem:_ The carbon chips away when the bowl is being reamed.
_Solution:_ This is another result of a loosely filled pipe. If the
smoker fills his pipe too loosely, he will have to smoker harder and
faster to keep it lit. Rather than building up char in the bowl
slowly and evenly, a layer of soft and unevenly dense carbon will
form. This type of cake provides spotty protection to the inner wall
of the bowl and is less absorbant than a properly developed, even
cake. When this uneven char builds up beyond one-sixteenth of an
inch, it has a tendency to flake away when the pipe is being reamed
or cleaned, leaving some areas completely unprotected from the heat
of the embers. Aside from impairing the ability of the pipe to taste
its best, one runs the risk of creating hot spots that eventually
could burn out the bowl of a wooden pipe."

"_Problem:_ The top of the bowl is scorched.
_Solution:_ It is natural, as you smoke a pipe, for the top of the
bowl to darken as oils and tars in the smoke adhere and are
absorbed. But scorching of the top of the bowl is caused by
carelessness in lighting the pipe, allowing the flame to come in
contact with the wood. You can (and should) avoid this by holding
the flame away from the tobaccos and drawing it into the pipe. With
pipe lighters, do the same or direct the flame straight over the
tobaccos rather than at an angle."

"_Problem:_ The bowl is cracking or splitting.
_Solution:_ A lack of attention to the buildup of char within the
bowl, whether is is uneven or extremely heavy, is the cause of
splitting of the bowl in the majority of cases. To avoid this, keep
your pipes reamed. Another reason the bowl may crack is because of
inferior and poorly seasoned wood sometimes found in cheap pipes. If
the bowl is made of wood that is not completely dry, rapid
evaporation of the remaining moisture under the extreme conditions
of heat weakens the fiber of the wood and causes the pipe to split."

"_Problem:_ The bowl is burning out.
_Solution:_ While reaming a wooden pipe, you may notice an area of
the inner bowl wall that is parched and looks somewhat like char. If
you probe, you will find that you can dig into the wall easily,
sometimes all the way through. This condition inside the bowl
generally is accompanied by an extreme darkening of the
corresponding area on the outside of the wall. This is known as
burnout. Though sometimes caused by extremely hard smoking for
prolonged periods of time, a burnout in briar generally is caused by
'wood burs,' a name given to loose ends of wood fibre which have not
been removed during manufacture of the pipe. Though burnouts are
most frequent in less expensive pipes, they sometimes occur in the
finest grades. When this happens in a fine pipe, the manufacturer
will replace it with a new pipe. This is a provision of the
warranties, some of which last ninety days, others from a year to a
lifetime. If your pipe burns out because of a defect, it will almost
always happen within the first month. Some tobacconists are
authorized by certain manufacturers to replace your pipe on the spot
but, in most cases, the pipe must be sent to the factory for
approval."

"_Problem:_ The shank has split at the end.
_Solution:_ This is a common occurrence in pipes which are fitted
with push-tenon bits. This type of breakage is often caused by the
smoker's removing the stem of the pipe when there still is moisture
in the shank or when the pipe still is hot after smoking. When a
smoker removes the stem without first cleaning out the moisture, the
moisture in the shank runs into the fitted mortise area and swells
the wood slightly. Then, when the smoker replaces the stem, the
fitting is tighter and, if he proceeds to twist it all the way in,
the shank may split. Of course, the danger of this happening is much
higher with pipes with thin shanks. A thick shank resists splitting
and the tenon may be forced through pressure to shrink slightly,
later causing the stem to fit loosely. These problems do not always
occur but it is best to clean pipes of this design with the stem in
them. Then after allowing them to dry for a day or two, it is safe
to remove the stem and perform a thorough cleaning."

"_Problem:_ An older pipe has been cleaned but the draft is
constricted.
_Solution:_ This is usually caused by a buildup of tars in the
shank. Use a shank reamer followed by a pipe cleaner that has been
soaked in a freshener or alcohol (or a shank brush that has been
soaked in a freshener or alcohol) to remove this buildup."

"_Problem:_ The shank is broken.
_Solution:_ There is little that can be done about this. Some
pipemakers might try to repair the shank by splicing the pieces
together or by cutting off the broken end connected to the bowl and
refitting it with a new stem. However, competent pipemakers are few
and even the best generally try this only with an expensive pipe.
Manufacturers usually guarantee only the bowl."

"_Problem:_ Your black (vulcanite) stem discolors (oxidizes).
_Solution:_ This is a common problem. It is usually caused by a
reaction of the rubber of the stem to an acidic condition of a
smoker's mouth or from prolonged exposure to the sun. The 'film'
that forms (which has a rather vile taste) generally can be buffed
off by a pipemaker by using various grades of abrasive polishes.
When a pipemaker is not available one could try using a buffer. A
smoker would be better off, however, using Savinelli's stem-
polishing paste as directed, or scrubbing the moistened bit with
baking soda with a fine toothbrush."

"_Problem:_ The stem (push-tenon type) fits loosely.
_Solution:_ Although a rubber stem may contract or shrink under
certain conditions, this problem is almost always caused by the
smoker who insists on pulling the stem out of his pipe when it is
either hot or still contains moisture in the channel from an earlier
smoke. When he pulls the stem out under either of these conditions,
the exposed inner portion of the shank fitting, or mortise, may
swell. If the shank does not crack as he reinserts the stem into
this smaller area, the tenon may be forced to shrink by the heat, or
the heat and pressure exerted by the swollen wood. When the wood
dries, it too shrinks, leaving the fitting loose. You can avoid this
problem with the push-tenon design (which is used in most fine
pipes) by cleaning the pipe after a smoke with the stem in and only
removing the stem for a thorough cleaning after a day or two of
drying in the rack. Do not leave a pipe cleaner in the shank as the
pipe is drying because it will prevent a normal air flow from drying
the shank. If a pipe stem becomes loose, the smoker should take it
to a good pipemaker, who usually will be able to swell the tenon,
returning the pipe to its proper condition."

"_Problem:_ The stem is too tight or frozen in place. Or the stem
does not fit flush to the end of the shank.
_Solution:_ These problems are caused by the same things that cause
a shank to split or a stem to loosen. The smoker with either of
these difficulties is lucky that the damage is not more severe. If
a stem is too tight or frozen, one must be careful to avoid
splitting the shank or snapping the stem. First let the pipe sit for
several days or weeks until it is thoroughly dry. At this time you
should be able to remove the stem as the swollen wood will have
contracted. If the fitting does not loosen naturally, take or send
your pipe to a tobacconist and let him repair it. With a push-tenon
type of stem these problems generally result from prolonged misuse.
If the pipe is allowed to rest properly and is not oversmoked, the
smoker occasionally can pull the stem out after smoking without
causing any damage. Only when a pipe is oversmoked and full of
moisture and tars do problems such as these occur. It is wise,
nevertheless, to refrain from habitually removing the stem directly
after smoking. If the stem does not fit tightly against the end of
the shank, it may be due to a buildup of tars in the end of the
shank which will not allow the tenon to seat properly. This
looseness could also be caused by pulling the stem out too often and
neglecting to clean the shank properly. A pipe in this condition is
a perfect target for easy breakage because the stem is not well
supported and this lack of support weakens the fitting."

"_Problem:_ Your curved stem has straightened.
_Solution:_ This generally happens when one leave a pipe in the sun
for a long time (for instance, on the dashboard of a closed car
parked in the sun). All vulcanite stems originally are straight.
After they are fitted to the pipe they are heated and bent. When
exposed to extreme heat, they straighten to their original molded
shape. If this happens, remove the stem from the pipe and slowly
heat it over a low flame (such as that provided by an alcohol lamp),
moving it back and forth slowly, keeping it above the flame. when it
becomes pliable, hold it in a towel and press it gently back into
the proper curve. Hold it in this position for a minute or so, then
put it under a faucet and let cold water run over it."

"_Problem:_ The stem is broken.
_Solution:_ A good tobacco shop should be able to replace a broken
stem at a reasonable price. Don't ask for an exchange as breaks of
this type are not caused by defects. To avoid breakage, smoke sturdy
pipes when you are active and don't carry your pipes around in your
pants or shirt pocket. Most important, don't pound your pipe out
while holding it at the stem. Pipes with narrow shanks are just not
as durable as hammers."

"_Problem:_ It is difficult or impossible to push a cleaner through
a bent stem.
_Solution:_ The channels of the bit and shank may be offset in a
pipe with a bent stem, thus causing a cleaner to hang up.
Manufacturers of better pipes drill a trough that guides the cleaner
to the shank portion of the channel as it comes through the stem.
Unfortunately this is not done to most pipes. However, the cleaner
will often go on through if you push it through the stem gently
until it stops, and then give it a quarter or half turn. If this
doesn't work, you will have to remove the stem to clean the pipe.
However, remember to let the pipe cool and dry out first."

There, you have it, words of wisdom on the care and feeding of the
pipe from Carl Ehwa Jr. As I said, his book is out of print, but
check the used-book market if you want a copy.

In recent weeks I was pleased to receive E-mail from Montreal and a
reader who enjoyed the excerpts on tobacco. With this in mind, we
will change tack and look at the tobaccos from the McClelland
Tobacco Company in my next puff, beginning with a suggestion for a
poor person's humidor for pipe tobacco. Also, in the offing, I have
a few words to type concerning Richard Hacker's "The Ultimate Pipe
Book."

Thanks for the invitation to become a member of your mailing list.  I grew up
with a mother who has smoked cigarettes for years, and was always offended by
the strong smoke. Not until very recently, within the last 3 months, would I
have even conceived of smoking ANYTHING!  Until I found myself at the opening
of a wonderful new upscale steak restaurant in my hometown of Washington,
D.C.  After a satisfying New York Strip, the waiter asked us if we would like
a cigar.  I agreed on  a whim, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

Here's to a long and satisfying relationship with quality cigars!

Thanks for getting me signed on so quickly to Pipes Digest!  My
primary interest is cigars although I often think about trying a
pipe. There are a couple of good tobacco shops here in Kansas
City. One is Cigar &amp; Tobac at 105th and Metcalf (the owner holds a
cigar smoker/dinner about once a month).  The second is Diebels
located on the Plaza or at the Crown Center shopping center. I always
have bought my cigars at the shop, but I was wondering if anyone out
there has had good luck getting cigars through the mail that they
cannot ordinarily get in their area. Are La Gloria Cubana cigars from
Miami good quality? They have received very good ratings in Cigar
Aficianado magazine, especially for a domestic product.

I am in the early stages of preparing a business plan to operate a
mail-order/catalog business retailing fine tobaccos, pipes, cigars, etc.  I
noticed your listing in the resource guide for the "Retail Tobacco Merchants
Association" (or something like that) located in Rockville Centre, New York.
 I assumed that this was a trade association for tobacco retailers, so I
tried to contact them for typical sales volume numbers, and any historical
sales figures for the industry as a whole.  The number that was listed is
incorrect, and after also dialing directory assistance to get the number,
they also had no listing.

Can you help me get to the bottom of this?

I would like to add two local tobacco shops to the resource
guide.  They are Cousin's Cigar Company and Old Erie Tobacco
Company.  Both shops are owned by the same person (Danny), and
they are located in the downtown Cleveland, Ohio area.

The Old Erie Store, housed in The Arcade, has the best selection
of pipes in the Northeastern Ohio area.  Cousin's has a wide
selection of cigars and quite an impressive humidor.  The
proprietor of both stores, who spends much of his time at
Cousin's, is a very friendly and knowledgeable guy.  I am told
that they meet on Saturdays to smoke and chat.

I have purchased several pipes from Danny.  The selection is
wonderful!  It is nice to see a wide array of Petersens,
Uphalls, Savanellis, Dunhills, etcetera, along with inexpensive
new and used pipes.  Once a year Danny has a pipe smoker's week
wherein he gives a discount on pipe purchases.  The tobacco is
excellent, too.  I often will go down to the store and get some
5FC (a golden and black cavendish blend) or a tin of Erinmore or
Dunhill #965.

They do accept mail orders and even have an 800 number (included
below).  The addresses of the stores are:

Cousin's Cigar Co.               The Old Erie Store
1828 Euclid Avenue               150 The Aracde
Cleveland, Ohio 44115            Cleveland, Ohio 44114
(216) 781-9393                   (216) 861-0487

The toll-free number for orders is (800) 397-9393.

If you happen to be in Cleveland, please stop in and enjoy the
best pipe store in the area.  When I moved here from New York
six years ago, I was worried about finding a good tobacconist.
I am not worried anymore.

For the terminally skeptical:  I have no legal or business
interest in these stores, and I have not received any
compensation for this post.

The Perils of Saying Things Before It's Really Time Dept: I already
sent out holiday wishes to everyone, and yet here comes another Digest
before Christmas! So I'll let our members have their turn to express
their holiday wishes. Thank you all for your kind words of support and
encouragement throughout the year; it really is great to do this. And,
for those who are putting up a tree, let's hope that Santa brings a
nice Dunhill shell briar, a few tins of Escudo and Bengal Slices, or a
box of properly humidified Cohibas. And a bottle of cognac, a pair of
warm slippers, a good book, a cozy chair, and a fireplace to enjoy it
all by. Best wishes to all in 1995!

<a name="2">Subject: The adventure to satisfy a tobak sweet tooth</a>

I thought I would share this with everyone.  About two months ago, I posted a 
note to this mailgroup asking for advice on a tobak sweet tooth.  I got 
several messages.

First, a public and special thanks to Tom Hendricks.  Tom found something far 
better than I had expected.  Tom has a tobacconist in Champaigne, Ill that has 
a blend called 'Champagne.'  Not sure if there is a connection.  The blend has 
a very LIGHT and mild undertone of a casing of apple.  It also has a light 
blend of vanilla.  Now, for those of you who know the old Apple blended 
tobacco, I first thought this did not sound good.  But, I have shared this 
with many, including Indiana's favorite pipe collector and curator Col. Ed 
Lawrence in Galveston, Indiana.  He loved it.  I now have a favorite tobacco 
that tops my list.

Along the way, I had a lot of good suggestions.  After purchasing a multitude 
of samples and spending about $150, I came up with the following for those of 
you with tobak sweet tooths.

These are the tobaccos I smoked.  I am SURE that there are some as equal or 
perhaps better, but I am not aware of them.  They are rated as the sweetest 
first down to the mild last.  My favorites are marked by a * and I currently 
smoke them.  The others I do not.

Cookie Jar
Champagne*
Wall Street (Hardwicke's blend)*
Camelot (Hardwicke's blend)*
Dark Chocolate*
Three Star Blue
Smoker's Pride Vanilla*
Apple
Amaretto (Hardwicke's blend) *

There are more, but I want to keep this somewhat short.  I found Cookie Jar to 
be VERY strange.  I don't care for it.  To me it was too sweet.  In fact, it 
was quite weird.....(if anyone smokes this, let me know.  I have 5 unopened 
and wrapped 1-3/8oz boxes I am willing to part with...).

Of course, that is my taste.  As our friend Rick Hacker as well as many others 
remind us, everyone's tastes are different and it is hard to rate tobaccos and 
please everyone.  I did want to relay to you all, however, the results of my 
adventure.

I was out last night, taking the wife to her nail appointment, and dropped in 
at Hardwicke's in Broad Ripple here in Indianapolis.  My eyes fell on 
something I could not pass up.  Being an individual who was born 130-150 years 
too late, I had to have the Savinelli Churchwarden!  What a classic looking 
pipe.  That looooong swan like bent stem and the knarled carving on the bowl.  
Ah, and what a very nice smoking pipe too!

For anyone near Indianapolis, I suggest Hardwicke's for a visit.  They may not 
be the cheapest.  But, I believe they are one of the oldest in Indy.  They 
always have a nice collection of collectables and other items.  They are not a 
mall tobacco shop which makes things nice as well.

For the best service, I will also provide another pipe shop.  Please add these 
to the resource list if they are not already there.  Thanks Steve!

Hardwicke's Tobacco Shop
743 Broad Ripple Ave.
Indianapolis, IN
317-257-5915

Hardwicke's Tobacco Shop (on the circle in Indy)
24 N Meridian
Indianapolis, IN 46204

Indianapolis, IN
317-846-7473

Pipe Puffers
2306 E. S. County Line Rd
Indiapolis, IN
317-881-2957

The Pipe Puffers is a fine place.  I won't hold it against them that they are 
in a mall.  After all, lots of tobacconists are now in malls.  They are always 
very helpful and always willing to chat even to a first time customer or a 
newcomer to pipe smoking.  The chap that works in the Fashion Mall shop is a 
lover of the English blends and is a fine fellow.  I will say this.  The owner 
of the Pipe Puffers (I think he is the same as the owner of the Eby-Brown Co 
pipe makers...not sure)... bought a big batch (perhaps two) of McClelland's 
Christmas Cheer.  Although I do not care for it.  I still smoke it.  It has a 
fine aroma out of the box.  And, although I don't care for it in general, it 
has a fine body when smoking.  It has a unique characteristic that is hard to 
put a finger on.

I will be on my way.  I must say, I have been holding out about this info on 
the shops.  But, I am a lazy person.  I enjoy reading email and my digests and 
smoking my pipe and that is about it.  I do not know the other zip codes and I 
apologize.  There are a couple of other shops...they are a tinder box chain 
and most folk do not visit them as much I believe.  I never cared for tinder 
box, but that is a personal preference and I will not let that get in the way. 
 I don't have their addresses or I would provide them.  I know they are in the 
mall in Castleton, and in Greenwood as well.

I will mention one thing.  Hardwicke's is a cigar store.  But, their Broad 
Ripple store has lots of misc. pipe items (including the nice clay humidifiers 
in a metal casing which I love to use).  The store downtown serves a lot of 
cigar smokers and that is their main buisness.  

Happy smoking and a VERY merry and SAFE Christmas to ALL OF YOU!!!!!!!!!!

Happy NEW YEAR!

Ted Wagner

Greetings all.
Forgive my ignorance, as I am primarily a cigar smoker, but I am curious
about estate pipes.
Are these usable? I have oft wondered as to whether you could just, say, put
a new stem on one and go to town ( especially in light of all the nasty germs
going aroung today ). I enjoy collecting antiques that are still functional,
such as furmiture, chairs, dressers, razors..... but what of briars??
Also ... I noticed in this last issue someone else who appreciates the bent
stem Falcon. I always find myself returning to it. I have been contemplating
the purchase of another,( perhaps a straight stem  hmmmm.. ).  Anyway....
Merry Christams and happy holidays to all.

<a name="5">Subject: Cigars and Thurber</a>

Hello Steve!!

I am a practicing lawyer in Lexington, Kentucky, a city largely intolerant of
pipe and cigar smokers despite the size of its burley tobacco market.  One of
the few places I feel comfortable smoking a cigar in public is the outdoor
cafe at Joseph Beth Booksellers, a wonderful bookstore/music store/cafe [both
indoors and outdoors] that is as fine as any I've seen in New York [where I
worked for awhile] or Boston/Cambridge [where I went to school].  

I was sipping a good cup of gourmet coffee and smoking a wonderful cigar
[probably a Partagas No. 10 or a Griffin's] at an outdoor table at the cafe.
 I had read an announcement in the newspaper that morning of the issuance of
a postage stamp in honor of the hundredth anniversary of James Thurber's
birth in Columbus, Ohio. I have always loved Thurber's humor, and saw that
the bookstore had a new edition of his famous book My Life and Hard Times,
which I've thought was one of the funniest books ever written ever since I
first read it as a teenager. 

I bought one and was puffing, sipping, and reading in the fall sunshine, and
could not help but burst out laughing when I got to the part about the dog
that bit people, which has always reminded me of a dog my great uncle Earle
had when I was young. 

Two older ladies at the next table looked over at me. I said, "Don't worry;
I'm not crazy, I'm just reading Thurber." They began laughing and we had a
discussion about the need for some humor in this modern world.  And I would
add that a good cup of coffee and a good cigar don't hurt, either. Later, I
saw one of the ladies inside the store buying a copy of the book.

Puff in peace, Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year!!!

Bob

<a name="7">Subject: The Rum Tobacco</a>

Date: Monday, December 19, 1994
Time: 6:21 PM

Two evenings ago I had the most remarkable experience. I visited my local
tobacconist and decided to try two of the pure tobaccos: pure Black Cavendish
and pure Burley. Upon smelling the Burley I remembered it as the first
tobacco I ever smoked--I'd been wanting it but had no idea what it had been.
The cavendish though... I had asked my tobacconist and his employees about
the pure black cavendish several times and had been mildly warned against it:
"Some people seem to like it by itself, but it is rather strong... It has an
unusual flavor; it is a blending tobacco primarily...etc, etc."

*Strong!!* I've never had anything more mild than that lovely, dark tobacco.
It smells wonderfully of rum (of course) and smokes so softly and smoothly I
could not believe it. I have had a tendency to smoke hot and harsh, but no
matter the amount of puffing I did the pipe never got past a gentle warmth.
Gentle, sweet, smooth. Wonderful!

I am planning on doing some experimenting with mixing different quantities of
the black cavendish and the burley. Any advise is welcome concerning more
adventurous mixtures.

<a name="8">Subject: for the Digest</a>

Dear Steve,

   I've been receiving your Digest for some months now, and thought
I'd better introduce myself.  I'm 34, and have been smoking a pipe
for over 20 years.  When I was 11 my parents gave clay pipes both to me
and to my brother.  My brother proudly displayed his, and I stuffed
mine with tobacco and lit up.  It made me feel like a man.  It still
makes me feel like a man, even though I'm now overweight and bald and 
have no career (for details you'll have to check out my post to
alt.fat.bald.nocareer).
   My collection is not terribly distinguished. I have about 40 pipes,
but only about 15 of them are of high quality.  I am particularly
pleased with my Hardcastle dublin, Barontini Suprema canadian, Savinelli
'Bing's Favorite', GBD Pedigree 'Windsor', Charatan 'Belvedere', and
the one that always provokes a double-take, a Porsche poker.  I am
also pleased to own two Wilke pipes, though one of them was badly damaged
in a flaming ashtray accident in 1976, and when I smoke it on the
street people give me money.
   Many of my pipes were given to me by relatives, several of whom
are now dead.  I don't know if they realized at the time what a wonderful
gift they had made.  I always think of the person who made the gift
when I smoke those pipes.
   I have a recurring dream: I am standing in front of my pipe rack
and suddenly notice a pipe that I had forgotten I owned.  I ask
myself why I hadn't been smoking it, as it's quite attractive.  In
each dream the shape of the pipe is substantially the same--a bent,
rather funnel-shaped thing.  Sometimes when I'm in a pipe shop I look
for the pipe.  I'd be interested to know if anyone else has dreams about
pipes.
   A certain pipe store has been praised a lot in past digests, and I
feel I'd better throw in my own praise:  I have been a patron of Jon's
Pipe Shop in Champaign, Illinois, since I began smoking, and can't imagine
life without it. What I've learned about pipes and tobacco there over
the years would fill an encyclopedia, if I remembered it all.
   Ever use a pipe to induce narcotic effects?  When I lived in Oxford
I used to like to get up early, and then walk around smoking bowl after
bowl.  Even with all the garbage in the streets from the previous night,
Oxford looks awfully nice in a nicotine-induced stupor.

?????@???.???.???

Pipes Digest #169 was up to snuff as usual. This week we will delve
a little deeper into the composition of McClelland's tobacco,
mentioned in #169. Also, there was a small whisper for more Escudo.

I can buy 50-gramme tins of Escudo from Ted's Pipe Shop in Tulsa.
Mrs. Kanaley retails it at $10.50 per tin, which is quite high, but
she has the overhead of keeping a well-stocked shop in a pricey area
of town. In Tulsa, Utica Square is expensive real estate. Escudo
from Ted's is identified as coming from U.S. distributors James B.
Russell, Inc. (JBR) I doubt they will sell to private individuals.
My first five-tin batch of Escudo came from JBR via Bob Hamlin of
the Pipe Collectors Club of America (PCCA), priced at about $8.50
per tin. He works through a jobber in Chicago, but he needs an order
of decent size to make it worth while for him and for you, the
larger the order the better the discount he can offer. Perhaps Steve
could be the collection point for a Pipes Digest order of Cope's
Escudo from Bob Hamlin and the PCCA. Bob's address is:

               R. C. Hamlin,
               Pipe Collectors Club of America,
               Post Office Box 5179,
               Woodbridge, VA 22194-5179.

               Fax: (703) 878-7657

Also, you could try E-mail to Bob at: ?????.??@??????????.???. Maybe
Bob wouldn't want to do it, but it doesn't hurt to ask.

Tobacco can have a couple of major effects on the smoker's tongue.
If the tobacco is very fine cut or as dry as tinder, it will burn
quickly and scorch your tongue. You can get the same effect if you
puff like a steam locomotive negotiating an incline. By avoiding
tongue burn, you can discover another couple of sensations. Full
flavoured tobaccos with little oriental condiment leaf can smoke
smooth with delicious aroma. Full tobacco blended with a large
proportion of Orientals and Perique can have the same effect on the
palate as that from eating a dish of Jalapeno peppers or a highly
spiced Vindaloo curry. You have the same feeling in your mouth
through consuming highly seasoned tobacco or food, but with Jalapeno
or the Vindaloo there is the additional problem of _cacafuego_ and
fundamental discomfort during that important, intensely satisfying
diurnal period necessary to any healthy body.

Perique I see as a condiment much as black pepper is a condiment.
Escudo is, I think, a good example of this, a well-blended mixture
of leaf, the Perique adding spice to the full, sweet Virginias,
bringing out the flavour by stimulating the taste buds in much the
same way that pepper does. Oriental leaves, such as Latakia, are the
Cardomom, Cumin, and Jalapeno spices of tobacco, the effect on the
palate is much the same.

When I ordered tobacco from Levin Pipes International, I asked Kathy
for a copy of their brochure. It is from this that I copy these
details of the fine mixtures from the McClelland Tobacco Company.
Two collections are offered: "Personal Reserve Series Pipe Tobaccos"
and "Aromatic Reserve Series."

In the category of the Personal Reserve Series there are five
classes of tobacco: Matured Oriental Mixtures, Matured Virginias,
Signature Blends, and Sampler Packs. In the Matured Oriental
Mixtures there are seven blends. Two mixtures are offered in the
Oriental Signature blends, six in the Matured Virginia blends plus
one Signature blend. In the Fragrant Matured Virginia Blends there
are six mixtures. In the category of Aromatic Reserve Blends there
are ten classes. We have here something to suit the taste of any
member of the Company. We will begin with the Personal Reserve
Matured Oriental Mixtures drawn up in review, accompanied by my few,
brief, notes on smoking qualities, but don't let my comments deter
you for trying them for yourselves. Rather, smoke your own samples
and post your comments here so that we can all read your opinion.
Different tobaccos will smoke differently for different people in
different pipes. What we can get is a consensus of opinion,
particularly if some diligent soul will collect and tabulate the
results. It will be fun and give us all something to do on the
forthcoming cold winter nights, and all those that do so a chance to
participate in the conversation. If you follow the format I use here
it will be easy to grep and collect reports from each member of the
Company posting to future editions of the Digest. Precede each
report with the name of the mixture, thus:

Personal Reserve Matured Oriental Mixtures.

Klenderwood Mixture -- "A superb blend of the highest quality Bright
Virginias, slow stoved Virginias, Cyprian Latakia, and Exotic
Orientals, specially formulated for lovers of Dunhill's 965, but
with The Personal Reserve touch." My note says: Cool, mild smoke
with pleasant aroma and taste. Not over spicy, but enough.

Bombay Court -- "An exotic oriental mixture spiced with the finest,
rare Turkish tobaccos cut wide and enhanced by the naturally
aromatic yet cool character of just enough smoky Latakia. Matured
Virginias fine-cut from aged cakes add their naturally sweet, full
flavor to round and balance this superb blend." It reminded me of
Balkan Sobranie #759, but I found it a bit sharp on the tongue and
somewhat difficult burning.

British Woods Mixture -- "Full, rich, and dark, heavy with fragrant
Latakia, spiced with premium Macedonian tobaccos. Lightly sweetened
with matured Virginias, this distinguished Oriental mixture is slow-
burning and cool-smoking. It offers richness and depth plus
unparalleled smoothness and refinement." Indeed, I found this cool
smoking and slow, easy burning. It is one of my favourites.

English Woods -- "The traditional medium Balkan mixture is presented
here in its top form. Sweet, zesty lemon and orange-red Virginias
are blended with rich Cyprian Latakia and the finest Greek Basma
leaf, then aged to develop this naturally fragrant, complex, yet
harmonious fine-cut Oriental mixture. An invigorating tobacco, both
satisfying and refreshing." To me it was cool, a bit wet-smoking and
difficult burning.

Scottish Woods -- "A classic full Scottish mixture, full-bodied and
deeply flavored with the finest grades of delicately spicy Oriental
tobaccos and cool, smoky Cyprian Latakia. Surprisingly refreshing
owing to the rich, matured and stoved Virginias that enliven this
beautiful, dark blend." Less sharp than Bombay Court, easy burning.
Good.

Turkish Woods Flake -- "Maturing naturally sweet lemon and orange
Virginias together with the finest, delicately spicy Oriental leaf
and smoky Latakia allows the tobaccos in this rich cake mixture to
develop an added measure of unity. This full Oriental flake tobacco,
intentionally dense for smoking outdoors, is easily rubbed out to
suit any occasion." Cool, mild, but a bit wet and difficult burning.

Oriental Signature Blends.

FrogMorton -- "An exceptionally dark, rich and full Latakia mixture.
This mixture was designed for those who want very satisfying Latakia
flavor, but soft enough to smoke all day. It took FrogMorton four
years to perfect this unique blend, and we consider it his proudest
achievement."

Three Oaks -- "Generous amounts of costly Latakia are balanced by
premium tobaccos, including Turkish leaf and Red Virginias. Special
blending mitigates the pungent aroma usually associated with Latakia
mixtures. Our 'stoutest' English blend, Three Oaks smokes smooth and
cool. Reminiscent of the old 'Smyrna' blend from John Cotton.
Personally formulated by Theodore Gage."

Personal Reserve Matured Virginias.

Blackwoods Flake -- "The characteristic natural sweetness of mellow
red Virginias mingles inextricably with the richness and inherently
spicy aroma of black stoved Virginias in this doubly aged red and
black all-Virginia cake mixture. This beautiful mottled flake is
uncomparable in smoothness and balance. Also available in cut ribbon
form." Pretty good.

Blackwoods Extra Flake -- "Extra aging and the addition of a special
super-rich leaf lends a different dimension to this tobacco. All the
sweetness, body, and character of regular Blackwoods Flake - with
added richness."

Brazilian Woods -- "A balanced blend of rich Maduro cigar leaf and
matured red and stoved Virginia tobaccos, this is the perfect pipe
tobacco for the cigar connoisseur who loves pipes. Pressed in cakes
and aged to develop character, then cut in ready-to-rub flakes." I
thought this one was very good, another of my favourites, the
tobacco lived up to the advertising puff in every way.

Dark Star -- "Years before tinning, this tobacco begins as bright
yellow, sugary top-grade Virginia and Carolina leaf. Through careful
triple aging, pressing and stoving, it becomes rich, cool and dark.
A seductive aroma develops during the extended maturing process to
complement the complex flavor of this smooth broken flake."

Redwoods Flake -- "Absolutely the finest red, flue-cured Virginias
available are aged to create this beautiful flake. This is straight
Virginia at its best. The flavor develops subtly throughout the
smoke, providing light sweetness and mellow, satisfying flavor. Also
available in fine-cut ribbon."

St. James Woods -- "A sophisticated cake of matured red and black
stoved Virginias pressed with the finest Louisiana Perique. This
tobacco has a rich character with that mysterious and compelling
aroma that is Perique's alone. Also available in cut ribbon form."
Good burning. A bit sharp and heady. While I smoked, I didn't notice
the aroma compelling any young ladies to take off their clothes and
throw themselves at my feet.

Matured Virginia Signature Blend.

Virginia Woods -- "Personally formulated for a smooth, rich, non-
biting flavor with an incomparable woodsy aroma. Blended from
expensive matured red cake, stoved black Virginias, wide bright
Virginia and other premium tobaccos, Virginia Woods offers one of
the ultimate experiences in matured Virginia blend smoking." I have
shied away from this one because I'm not sure how many ultimate
experiences are available to man, one only was my thought and I'm
not ready to go just yet.

Personal Reserve Fragrant Matured Virginia Blends.

"The Fragrant Matured Virginia Blend is a new concept in pipe
tobacco. To the highest quality aged Virginia cakes, we added
subtle, enriching, complementary fragrances and, occasionally. other
premium tobaccos. You experience the rich taste of fine natural
tobaccos. Those around you enjoy a mellow and pleasing fragrance."

To me, most of these had a note of vanilla that I didn't care for
very much.

Grey Havens -- "An extremely soft, light blend with smooth fragrant
flavour and just a hint of Louisiana Perique." OK, cool smoking.

White Downs -- "Orange and orange-red Virginia cake with a mellow
and nutty character."

Trollshaws -- "Greek Xanthi and Cyprian Latakia enrich this unique
and complex fragrant cake." I liked this very much, another
favourite. Very good.

Moria Gate -- "An exotic, fragrant Virginia cake with a hint of
Xanthis and Perique." Good, but a bit moist smoking.

Deep Hollow -- "Cut from rich red cake, spiced with deeply stoved
black Virginia and lightly fragrant." OK. Cool smoke.

Deep Elem -- "Our darkest stoved matured Virginia cake with a deep,
rich fragrance."

Aromatic Reserve Blends.

There are ten: Mountain Raspberry, Black Vanilla, Chocolate, English
Walnut, Peach Black, Peach, Cherry, Coffee, King of Amaretto,
Fragrant Anise.

All these tobaccos can be had from Kathy Levin in Aptos, California.

Here is the McClelland Tobacco Company advice on how to smoke flake
tobaccos.

"English and Scottish-style Matured Virginia flake tobaccos are
among the most interesting and rewarding for the smoker to taste;
yet, they are avoided by many smokers who simply do not know how to
approach them. This flyer is intended to help the pipe smoker learn
how to fully appreciate the zesty character and subtle sweetness of
these premium, aged products. (It should also help smokers of the
flavored American sliced plug and European flake cavendish
tobaccos.)

"One reason flake tobaccos are left in slices after cake-maturing is
that they retain their freshness better than in ribbon form. Flakes
also enable the smoker to have some degree of control over the
burning rate and, to a small degree, the flavor.

"It is important to prepare the tobacco before packing so that it
has an even texture and to fill the bowl evenly, no matter what
degree of brokenness is preferred. (The more fully-rubbed -- meaning
gently separated -- a tobacco, the faster it will burn. Similarly,
it is true that the thinner the cut, the faster it will burn.)

"The more moist tobaccos should be packed more loosely than normal
so they won't pack down densley enough to prevent a good draft. The
ideal is to have the tobacco draw firmly, with a little resistance,
throughout the smoke. The smoker may be able barely to hear a little
hissing through the pipe as it is smoked. Too firm and the tobacco
won't burn at all or one small spot will burn hot and maybe wet as
the smoke puffs hard to keep it going; too loose and the tobacco
will burn inconsistently and unevenly, perhaps causing the bowl to
overheat in spots and moisture to condense."

"Five Steps to Success:  1.   Put in the palm of one hand the amount
of tobacco that it is believed will fill the bowl. Then pinch at the
slices or rub them between the palms until the tobacco separates to
the degree preferred, keeping the texture even, avoiding clumps. The
denser the tobacco is left, the slower it will burn. (This becomes
especially valuable on windy days outdoors.)
                         2.   Gently but firmly and evenly work the
tobacco into the bowl of the pipe until it is filled slightly over
the top and feels firm but still springy under enough finger
pressure to flatten the surface of the tobacco even with the top of
the pipe. (We assume the pipe is clean at the outset, free of
obstruction to a good draft, well rested.)
                         3.   Now, while drawing through the stem,
light the pipe evenly across the entire surface of the tobacco.
After a few puffs to develop an ash, and while continuing to draw,
tamp the tobacco down evenly all around the bowl with a tamper. The
goal is to have the tobacco packed so that it will burn as evenly
and firmly as a good cigar.
                         4.   Relight the pipe after tamping to get
the entire surface of the tobacco burning again. Even burning is
very important. Otherwise, hot spots may develop.
                         5.   With only occasional tamping as the
tobacco burns down, since it tends to expand and loosen as it burns,
the pipe should now smoke evenly to the bottom. The aim is to
maintain a firm, even draft throughout the smoke. The process is not
difficult to master and with practice will soon be effortless."

"A Note on Flavor Expectation. For those who are used to the
'aromatic' or sweetened tobaccos that dominate our market in the
United States, it may take some time for the additive remaining in
the pipe to dissipate. Many smokers prefer to maintain one set of
pipes exclusively for the natural, matured tobaccos and another for
the sweetened varieties. It may be necessary to smoke up to four
ounces of a natural product before the mouth adjusts to the clean
taste and subtler range of flavors typical of these Matured Virginia
tobaccos. The smoker is rewarded for the effort as he becomes able
to distinguish the delicate variations in taste and deepening
richness these tobaccos develop as they are smoked."

So much for McClelland Tobaccos. In my next puff we will talk about
making a pipe tobacco humidor for the pipe smoker of slender means,
complete with homemade button humidifier. If we have time, we will
take a glance at Hacker's "The Ultimate Pipe Book". Later still,
there are a few words from the folks at Ted's.

For smokers of Virginia blends, I strongly recommend Mike Butera Blended 
Flake. Now that Three Nuns and Rattrays have been cheapened and do not exist 
anymore except as ghostly commercial entities, I only smoke Blended Flake.
Although MacClellan's manufactures it for Butera, he has prevailed on them
to use a different process from their normal one (to me the usual 
MacClellan's tobaccos taste far too much alike).

Dear Steve,
Many thanks and congratulations on the excellent job you do with Pipes 
Digest!  I look forward to receiving it, as well as to reading posts on 
alt.smokers.cigars.  I appreciate not only the subject matter but the 
fact that the participants in these forums are among the most...no, ARE 
the most civilized on the Internet.

I though it was time to contribute to the Digest.  As you suggested, I'll 
start with a little information about my smoking preferences.  
I've smoked pipes on and off over the past several years, have smoked an 
occasional hand-rolled (Drum brand Dutch tobacco) cigarette, but have 
currently found most enjoyment in cigars.  I'm fortunate to live near New 
Haven, Connecticut, home of The Owl Shop, an excellent tobacconist.  I 
started with cigars about a year ago with a couple of Avos.  Finding 
them a little pricey for continued use, I then set out to sample as many 
varieties as I could.  Right now my humidor contains Hoyo de Monterrey 
Rothschilds (my regular smoke of choice), some Rey del Mundos and 
Belindas (also Rothschild size), several A. Fuente Double Chateaus, and 
about a dozen La Gloria Cubana Torpedo No. 1's that I got from the 
factory last summer and have been slowly rationing to myself since.  

I notice that people like to discuss what to drink while smoking.  I enjoy 
In the same vein as the note I saw from one gentleman who said that the 
best beverage with a cigar was Dr. Pepper, I'll mention that I enjoy a drink
called Mocha Cooler, made by Nestle.  It's a coffee/chocolate beverage 
that I think is just great over ice with a cigar after dinner on a weeknight.

I also wanted to mention two excellent letters to the editor in the New 
York Times last week in response to the proposed Draconian restrictions 
on smoking.  One writer pointed out that the same logic that led to the 
smoking ban could be extended to justify a ban on automobiles in New York 
as well.  After all, auto exhaust pollutes and causes health 
problems--and those who object to tobacco smoke can avoid restaurants, 
etc. where it is permitted.  No one can avoid breathing the 
auto-exhaust-laden city air, though.  Finally, another letter writer, 
in response to an antismoker's comment that separate smoking and 
non-smoking areas in restaurants were unacceptable because the nonsmoker 
might have to pass though the smoking area on the way to the rest room 
(!), said, "and they called the 70's the Me Generation!"

Well, I've rambled on long enough.  Please use any or all or none of this 
as you see fit.  Thanks again, and a very merry Christmas and happy New 
Year to you and all of our fellows in the fraternity of tobacco lovers.

Sincerely,
Paul

In Defense of Sandblasts

I am a sandblast collector, and my remarks are intended to address
misconceptions widely held by pipe smokers and pipe store
personnel about sandblasts, which tend to be viewed as second-
class citizens of the pipe world. This article necessarily
expresses my own tastes and reflects my experience with particular
pipes. Although I feel a certain conviction of the rightness of my
views, they nonetheless remain only my views; I do not elevate
them to the status of universal imperishable truth.  Ideally, this
article should be complemented by one written by a pipemaker about
the processes used to created sandblasts.

Three statements are often made about sandblasts:

(1) Sandblasts are second-best pipes, suitable if a purchaser
cannot afford to buy a smooth. Sandblasts have no aesthetic
virtues of their own: they are essentially non-smooths.

(2) Sandblasts and carved pipes are indistinguishable: both are
rough, as opposed to smooth, pipes.

(3) Sandblasts are made from inferior wood too flawed to produce a
smooth.

Concerning (1): smokers collect sandblasts because of inherent
qualities not shared by other pipes. Personally, I find them
beautiful, fascinating, subtle, and dramatic; they possess a
strong character different from, and, to my mind, far more
interesting than that of a smooth. A smooth pipe seems two-
dimensional and dull next to a good blast, similar to a flat map
versus a relief map--on the latter, you can feel the mountain
ranges. Good blasts have a tactile dimension lacked by smooths. 

As for (2), although almost all pipe store salespeople I have met
cannot tell a blasted from a carved pipe, it seems to me that a
blind bat should be able to tell the difference--it is that
obvious. Sandblasting accentuates the grain; carving obliterates
it (even the old Sasieni carved pipes only approximate the grain
in a stylized fashion). On a well-grained smooth pipe, cross-grain
lines can sometimes be discerned running against the grain lines
at a 90 degree angle. Sandblasting renders both cross and grain
lines in bold relief. The fascination of a good blast derives from
the interaction between the cross and the grain lines as first
one, then the other, catches the eye in superimposed shifting
images which change according to the light, angle, and
accentuation in different parts of the bowl and shank.

The treatment of cross and grain lines, as well as the cut of the
wood and depth and definition of the blast, effect a high degree
of individual variation in sandblast pipes. But the essential
effect of a goodblast derives from the quality of the grain. If
the briar is not well and closely grained, there is nothing for
the blast to bring out. I have seen sandblasts made by prestigious
makers which were complete failures, because the wood was badly
grained to begin with.

Carved pipes, on the other hand, obliterate the grain, whether
they are deeply gouged like Ascortis and Castello Searocks, or
lightly carved like Radicis. They have a tactile dimension that at
first appears similar to that of a sandblast, but whereas a good
blast renders the grain three-dimensional, carving hides the grain
under an imposed pattern so that it can be neither seen nor felt.
Sandblasting accentuates grain; carving obscures it.

It is for this reason that I personally don't like Ashton pebble-
shells. Unlike the pebble-grains, which are often extraordinary
blasts, pebble-shells are first blasted and then carved--the grain
is obliterated, and the resulting pipe is neither a strong blast
nor a distinctive carving job.

Different makers and nationalities have distinctive sandblast
styles. Italian makers favor straight-grains, emphasizing the
evenness and definition of the cross-grain lines ringing the bowl.
Ser Jacopos tend to quite defined and fairly deep; Becker produces
fairly few blasts, but these are absolutely superb; Castello
blasts are usually shallow and ill-defined. English pipes (such as
Dunhill, Ashton, and the old Charatan), on the other hand, are
often cross-grained, creating a less uniform, erratic, and more
varied effect, like that of an aerial photograph of a country that
contains many types of terrain. The cross-graining necessarily
produces more birds-eye than in a straight-grained pipe. In my
opinion, birds-eye patterns tends to fare less well under a blast
than grain-lines; they turn into a series of little craters.
English makers, of course, also produce straight-grained blasts,
but most English cross-grains would not be acceptable to Italian
makers--the aesthetic is different. As for American pipes, I have
seen photographs of pipes made by Mike Butera, and I own several
pipes made by J.D. and Deb Cooke. Butera and Cooke pipes rank
among the finest blasts I have seen anywhere--deep, well-defined,
and varied. The Cooke pipes are the most rugged and close-grained
blasts I have ever smoked.

As for (3): it is true that a maker will use wood with the fewest
surface flaws (such as sand-pits) for smooth pipes, which fetch a
higher price. But badly flawed wood cannot produce a good blast:
if the grain is bad, the blast has nothing to work upon, and
blasting accentuates flaws. A deeply-pitted pipe will simply be
torn to bits by sandblasting. Today, makers tend to use their
worst wood for carved pipes, not sandblasts. 

In conclusion, sandblast pipes are not the same as carved pipes,
nor are they second- bests for people who cannot afford smooth
pipes, nor are they made from inferior, badly-grained wood. By
accentuating the grain and cross-grain in varying degrees of depth
and definition, by rendering the grain three-dimensional and
tactile, and by creating highly varied terrains, sandblasts create
subtle, dramatic, and fascinating textures.

[ Thanks for the treatise! I recently bought a GBD sandblast, and am
quite happy with it. -S. ]

Steve,

Thank you so much for the back issues-- just one other problem.  The
issues 86-88 on the netcom site are in MS WORD 6.0 format... unussually
difficult for those of us without this software to read it...

Now that the administrivia is over, I would like to be re-added to the
pipes digest mailing list.  My address is:
     ???????@??????.???.????.???

As for a short bio:

I am 25, an instructor in mathematics at Robert Morris College here in
Pittsburgh, PA, and a graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh.
I picked up a pipe at my wife's request (to wean me of cigarettes) when we
were in Boston for a year in 1991.  I bought a quarter-bent Ehrlich at Leavitt
and Pierce in Harvard Square, and 2 ounces of their black and gold mix.  I've
been hooked ever since.

I have, since then, acquired all of my father's old pipes (7 of them) and
two more of my own.  My own pipes are a Peterson Dublin, and a Stanwell with
a very odd shape.  It has no narrowing of the stem, and it has a trapezoidal
bowl.  The bite flares out to the width of the bottom of the bowl, and
as you go up, it getss narrower.  Very interesting to look at.  I received 
it as a Hannukah present this year, and have not smoked it yet.

I usually smoke mild aromatics, with a particular lean towards a light
Vanilla Cavendish, but my new present of a pipe came with four 2 ounce bags
of things that my wife likes, at least the way they smell in the bag, so
I will be branching out soon.  I also like to smoke a bowlful or two of
straight MacBaren's Virginia (#1) every now and then.  I just (last week)
had my first bowl of Dunhill's Early Morning Pipe - wow....  I may take to
that quite quickly.

Well, more fine reading material - I just printed up a bunch of back issues
to relax with over the semester break.

Enjoy your bowls,
Joshua C. Sasmor

Here is a little bit of info on the Gotham City Cigar Society.  I hope it
will fit in 1 file

The Gotham City Cigar Society is an exciting new club for cigar enthusiasts.
 Founded by cigar connoisseur, JOnathan Ressler, Gotham has already
accumulated a large membership enrollment in just a few short months.  The
Gotham City Cigar Society was formed to afford our select members the
exclusive opportunity to enjoy the camaraderie of others who enjoy one of
life's greatest pleasures:  FINE CIGARS.

With the increasing pressure by special interest groups to curtail the
freedom to enjoy a cigar in most public places, restaurants, nightclubs,
sporting events, and even private homes, this club provides the perfect
environment for Cigar Enthusiasts.  But most importantly, it offers the
opportunity to light up and enjoy good times and make new friends.  To this
end, Gotham has a myriad of spectacular events planned for the upcoming year,
whcih include: a black-tie charity ball, golf and tennis outings, a casino
night, a day at a race car driving school, casual "get togethers," and
monthly cigar dinners at local restaurants.  Gotham welcomes the thoughts and
ideas of its members for future events and functions.

The members of the Gotham City Cigar Society are male and female
professionals aged 25 to 85.  They represent a multitude of professions,
including Wall Street, law, medicine, entertainment, the
restaurant/nightclub, and consumer proust industries.  Gotham already has a
solid elite membership base of several hundred, and is growing at a rate of
20 new members each week.

Gotham City Cigar Society also provides and incredible opportunity for people
who are directly or indirectly involved in the tobacco industry.  The unique
newsletter, which features a calender of events, reviews of cigar friendly
restaurants, and a column dedicated to promoting new cigar products, is
provided to our rapidly growing membership on a quarterly basis.

The first event for 1995 is a cigar dinner scheduled for January 16 at
Frontiere, the acclaimed Soho bistro on Prince Street in NYC.  The price of
the event includes a four course meal, fine wine and spirits, and a 'tasting
menu' of four cigars provided by Nat Sherman International.  The event will
also feature a presentation on "how cigars are made" by a representative of
Nat Sherman.  Our events are open to members, prospective members, and
guests.

Fo additional information or a membership application, please cal (212)
713-5453.

I hope that is enough info

Steve,
Just a note to say how much I enjoy the digest! The tone of all of the 
contributors is warm, friendly, and refreshing given the well-known 
flaming seen elsewhere on the net.

I probably shouldn't say this, but I'm not certain I agree wholeheartedly 
with the anti smokeban sentiment seen on the net. While I enjoy my pipes 
&amp; cigars and also wish I could smoke in a variety of places, I am equally 
concerned about the medical data and possible effects on non-smoker. Not 
everyone has a choice of where to work and who to work around, and I 
think that imposing a potential risk on a non-willing participant should 
give all smokers pause.

If nothing else, I like to join my smoking friends for the fellowship of 
pipe smoking in the privacy of our own homes. The company and atmosphere 
can't be beat; no angry glares or nasty comments from non-smokers. Just 
good clean(!) fun.

Steve,

As you requested, a little about myself:

I have been an avid pipe-smoker for over 30 years. My pipe of preference is
Dunhill--have more than 30 in my collection of approx. 150. I smoke Dunhill
Medium exclusively--was never into the aromatic stuff.

I am also an avid cigar smoker. My cigar of preference is Davidoff Grand Cru
series and the Special R. I have collected pipes from my years of travel with
many hand-carved Danish, English, and Italian pipes that are shoecased in my
Study. I even furnished my Study like a London club, complete with
chesterfield couch, wall-to-wall bookcases with a ladder---great place to
meditate  with a good smoke.

Looking forward to participating in a smoke-friendly environment where I
don't see those special signs: "no pipes or cigars allowed". Personally, I
find cigarette smoking much more offensive.

Best Regards,
Sid Gibson aka ???????@???.???
Garrison, NY    

[ No signs at all posted here, Sid! Welcome! -S. ]

Happy holidays Steve and all. Last time around you asked me to report on the
Grand Opening Party at the relocated Tabagerie, Ltd., 666 Main Ave. (Rt 7)
Town Line Center, Norwalk, CT 06851. (203) 846-1112. [Resource Guide info].
Some 60 tobacco connaisants wandered in during the course of the day to
enjoy catered Italian goodies--from sausage-stuffed peppers through pasta
salad--pasteries, hand-made chocolates and Italian cookies; beer, wine, soda
and coffee. None of Tony's other celebraty customers (like Frank Gorshin,
Paul Newman) were there but a good time was had by those who were.
 
The new shop has a walk-in cigar humidor and a new policy. Customers may buy
boxes of cigars at a 10% discount and leave them in the humidor, stopping by
to help themselves to their cigars as needed. Future plans call for turning
the store's full basement into a "clubhouse" where customers may meet, play
cards and smoke to their heart's content. While there, I tried and fell in
love with Arturo Fuentes' No. 1 cigars; something I find truely flavorful
and enjoyable--specially with a glass of Aragmanac and a roaring fire. I
have been faithfully smoking JR's Ultimate Cetros (in addition to my pipe)
but _most_ of JR's decent cigars are out of stock more than they're in. Just
hate paying that damned CT sales tax on tobacco. Traded Tony the two
hand-made meershaums I couldn't find a buyer for on the digest (was I
surprised by _that_ "two hand-made meershaums, nicely colored, best offer"
and nada response) and received in return a beautiful Danish straight grain
freehand from his estate collection. Currently smoking his Playhouse Square
burley/virginia mixture, a nice all-day smoke though his Riverboat mild
aromatic is still my favorite and now my evening mixture. While the
Tabagerie has no catalog, it will mail product (tobacco, cigars, pipes) to
anyone who calls.
 Don Johnson

[ Thanks for the review, Don! Tabagerie Ltd. is already in the Guide;
Digest #169. Too bad about the meerschaums. Maybe the Perfect Buyer
will see them this issue. -S. ]

Thanks for all those good wishes, friends.
Here's an old pipe Tale.

A man is so angry with a guy, that he says:

" I'll find him and I'll kill him."
  In the road the man smokes a pipe and after this relaxing
experience he says:
"wlll, perhaps I will not kill him, I will punch him..."

Hours latter, and after some pipe smoke, he says.

"The best thing I can do is invite him to smoke a pipe with me,
and talk about our problems..."

***Keep Tobacco Legal***

[ Good tale! It's important to keep the peaceful uses of the weed in
the public eye. -S. ]

<a name="6">Subject: Back Issues</a>

Dear Steve,

Once again, the Pipes Digest has impressed me.  After reading one particular
letter, I started thinking:  "Would Steve mind sending me some, if not all,
back issues of Pipes Digest?"  Would that be a problem, or would that wind up
costing you too much money to send all that info to me?  If there's any way,
please feel free to send all (or as many as possible) back issues of Pipes
Digest (1-178).

On to a completely different subject...

I feel it's time I officially introduce myself.  My real name is Brandon.
 I'm 18 years old and I've been smoking cigars for about a year now.  I'm
relatively new to all of this, so I'm quite naive (a trait that I hope will
change with maturity).  Initially, I signed onto this digest because I wanted
to learn more about quality cigars through another venue outside of "Cigar
Aficionado."  Now, I want to know everything there is to know about pipes.
 I've wanted to smoke a pipe since I was a little kid when I first smelled my
grandfather's cherry pipe tobacco.  Unfortunately, I have not smoked a pipe
yet because I want to learn more about pipe smoking before I invest my time
and money into it.  

Which leads me to an important question.  Personally, Steve, which type of
pipe (be it brand name or otherwise) do you suggest for a cool, dry smoke?
 I'm willing to spend up to $40-$50 for my first pipe.  Also, what brand of
tobacco is your favorite?  I think I'll probably be partial to light
aromatics and black cavendish.  Where should I buy tobacco (i.e. is it better
to buy tobacco at the local drug store or at a tobacco store?)  I would be
interested to hear other people's ideas on what kind of pipes and tobaccos
are good for beginners like me.  All in all, how much would a cool, dry pipe,
quality tobacco, and a pipe maintenance kit cost me?  Sorry I have so many
questions, but I'm a newbie.

Again, please allow me commend you and all the others involved in the digest
(readers included) on a job well done.  This is most definitely the most
pleasant place to be on the Internet :-)

Sincerely yours,
Brandon

[ Well, Brandon, for $40-50 you could get a nice GBD shell briar,
brand new. Petersons seem to be a little costlier these days. I'd
recommend going to a tobacconist and getting a nice light vanilla or
cherry Cavendish; the drugstores make no special effort to keep their
stock fresh. Don't forget some cleaners and a pipe nail too. Back
issues should have reached you by now. Enjoy! -S. ]

<a name="8">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #170 - Decem...</a>

As an Airline Pilot and a Pipe Smoker (a respectable title) of 35 years, I
too am concerned with the increasing tendancy to prohibit any form of smoking
in our society.  I insist upon a "smoking room" in hotels, insist upon a
"smoking" rental car, and always sit in the smoking section of restaurants,
where state laws have not yet forbid that freedom.  I urge all of you to do
so as well, since the "lack of demand" for smoking facilities will hasten the
demise of its availability.  In airports, where there is no provision for a
smoking section, I feel free to create one (in a location that limits the
effect on others.)  I also have, on occassion, exceeded the 55MPH speed limit
and do not feel the guilt of an archcriminal for doing so.

Our society has such a plethora of laws that everyone in our society is in
one way or another guilty of some sort of violation.  I must confess to being
guilty of enjoying a good bowl of tobacco on occasion.

Lloyd H. Colvin

[ I'm not sure that's a constructive approach, Lloyd. "Creating" a
smoking area is a good way to tarnish the reputation of pipe
smokers. Rather, I'd suggest writing a letter to the airport
management, and the politicos who control it, to let them know your
views. Your status as a pilot will help.

One effective tactic would be to declare that, even though you might
occasionally be forced to use that particular airport, that you do so
under protest and as little as possible, and that you will not
purchase so much as one stick of gum from any concession in the
airport as long as they insist on bashing pipe smokers. And find
others who share your views, and persuade them to do likewise. -S. ]

<a name="9">Subject: Digest Contrib</a>

Dear all

as the work load tends to drop a bit over Xmas, I found some time to
write a couple of lines for the digest again.  This year was, in terms
of pipe buying, the most active year in my smoking career. Some of the
buys were inspired by the Pipe Digest and I would like to tell you a bit
about experiences I made. There is also one or another point I would
appreciate opinions/ideas.

A very interesting pipe I bought is a Loewe Apple with a Spigot
mount. Loewe pipes are quite hard to find, so I would guess that some
people are not even aware of this company. According to Hacker's book,
Emile Loewe was a French pipemaker who started a pipe making business in
London in 1856. Since then, Loewe pipes are produced in England.

I found the pipe itself with a method I developed here in Germany:
tobacconists are (compared to the US) very frequent here: in each
village of more than, say 20000 inhibintants you will find a shop.
These are usually no high-grade shops, just the sort of "tobacconist
around the corner".  Whenever I see one of these somewhere I go in and
ask whether they have any non-filter pipes. Usually this is not the
case; since the seventies the German pipe market is dominated (90 %) by
filter pipes. For some obscure reason, Germans insist on using 9mm
charcoal filters. However, now and then shops still have leftovers from
the sixties and seventies. These are often a real bargain: if you are
lucky, you can get excellent pipes for ridiculously little money; since
for the shop such pipes are just leftovers they haven't been able to
sell for 20 years.  The Loewe pipe was one of these bargains.

The pipe itself turned out to be a real beauty after polishing off the
last 20 years. As with most older, unused pipes, the stem deveopled an
ugly yellowisch-brown patina after the first smoke. I think this is due
to light exposuure for many years. After careful polishing it now looks
like new. The pipe is one of the 'slow starters': after smoking it about
30-40 times, it now just starts to develop a good taste. It is also not
particularly easy to smoke, as it easily goes out. I don't quite know
why, since an Apple-shape is usually an easy smoke -- but this one wants
to be taken seriously :-) Btw, if anyone knows a bit more about Loewe, I
would be interested in hearing it...

In the same shop, I bought another Apple: a Bauer meerschaum, again
about 20-30 years old. The pipe comes with an army-mount mouth piece,
which seems to me ideal for a meerschaum: the silver ring make the pipe
easier to handle, as you are not supposed to touch the bowl while
smoking. After smoking it (nearly) dayly for the last six mounths, it
now starts coloring a bit around the bottom of the bowl. I would have
expected this to happen a bit faster ... would anyone care to comment?
Futhermore, is it really necessary to follow the advise not to touch the
bowl when it is warm? I accidentally touched it now and then, but it did
not seem to have any effect so far.

Overall, meerschaums are really a nice smoke --- different from
briars. However, I personally would prefer a good briar if I had
to choose. Fortunately, I don't have to ...

Two non-bargain buys in this year have been Ashtons. After I read about
them in the Digest, I tried hard to find an Ashton pipe for several
months without success. Then I finally persuaded my local tobacconist to
order two or three samples from Ashton. He said the would not have any
influence on what he would get and he could not predict the price. I
guess this is what is called a sellers' market :-)

After two more months, he got a Billiard, an Apple, and a sand-blasted
Bent. Nothing really spectacular, but very nice pipes. Very English,
indeed.  Their finish was actually not the best: the non-sandblasted
pipes had a couple of spots where Ashton appearently forgot to put wax
on. I decided that I could live with this and took it as an opportunity
for bargaining. In the end I paid about US$ 180 for the Billiard.

Well, after the first two or three smokes, I went back and bouth the
Apple as well ... their taste is really convincing: already the first
smoke was great! I hope the blank spots will not color differently from
the rest of the pipe. Does anyone know what sort of wax Ashton are
using?  It seems to be harder that the wax on other pipes, which is
usually gone after few smokes. The Ashtons are still shiney, at least
partly :-(. Besides that the finish is not the best -which I heard is
not unusual for Ashtons- I would recommend them very much: in my
opinion, Ashtons smoke at least as good as Dunhills, for about half
thirds od the price.

The last pipe I would like to mention is a huge Peterson Billiard
(called "Kapet"); this was another of these
do-you-have-non-filter-leftovers buy I made in Stuttgart. Usually, I am
not so much into Petersons, since they tend to be rather big, which is
not my preference.  However, the price (US$ 40) convinced me
immediately. It smokes really great, but I did not get used to the
mouthpiece: I usually hold a pipe with my teeth a lot, and this is quite
impossible with the particular Peterson I bought. Maybe I will send it
in for a mouthpiece replacement...  Btw, the shank says "107", does
anyone knows which year this stands for?

Thanks for your patience &amp; happy puffin..

	Joachim.

Christmas Greetings from Toronto !
As a new member of the Digest I'd like to say Hi !
A warm fire, a good book and a pipeful of TinderBox House Blend pushes 
all the right buttons for me..with one addition..a disconnected phone 
&lt;grin&gt;.A little Bailey's Irish Cream doesn't hurt either. It seems as this 
hectic season barrels down on us we don't (or can't) find the time to sit 
down and enjoy a slow uninterupted smoke. I find an excuse for just about 
everything, however, I was just brought back to the enjoyment of the pipe.
I was doing the last minute power shopping thing when something snapped 
and I found myself sitting in the car in a crowded mall parking lot with 
my trusty bent bulldog in hand, trying to blow smoke rings at the 
rear-view mirror...just slightly short of insane..I couldn't believe how 
pleasant that few minutes to myself felt. For those who looked at me 
during those few insane moments, I apologize, but if you've never been at 
the point where the world has gone crazy, do yourself a favour and sit 
back, light up, and shut the world out. It feels so good that it must be 
taxable (only in Canada..&lt;grin&gt; )
I must commend all those involved with this Digest, I look forward to the 
arrival, and most certainly enjoy the reading.
As a professional firefighter of some 20 years, I must say have a Safe 
and Happy Christmas, try to stay on track with those New Years 
resolutions and check the batteries in your smoke detector (No pun 
intended..&lt;grin&gt;...)
Best Wishes

 Several of us (non-traditional) students enjoy pipes, it's almost like a
club but we're reall busy with school to sit to long and chat.  I smoke 1Q

and Stanwell's.  The pipe shoppee here in Murfreesboro, Tn is ran by a person
who pushes Dunhill's and his form of mixture.  The nearest tobacco shop is in

Smoke Signal #12

Now we will talk about the making of a humidor for pipe tobacco.
Practical and Inexpensive are the watchwords of this very small
project, for those among us of slender means, for those financially
challenged, for the impecunious, or even for those -- rich as
Croesus -- wanting to remind visitors to their palaces that they
really are the salt-of-the-Earth. Here, then, an humble humidor.

Georges Herment thought the smoker best served by savouring tobacco
in all its stages of humidity, from the perfection of the new broken
vacuum seal to the dried shreds of a week later. As a philosophy,
this is Jim-dandy for the heavy smoker, if I may use the vernacular,
but for many of us occasional puffers of the pipe, two ounces of
baccy can last for long, long while, becoming desiccated and
unpleasant if not stored properly. Received wisdom will bespeak the
relative humidity of tobacco best at 70%, 65 degrees Fahrenheit
being a good temperature for long-term storage. Uncle Fred will
suggest a slice of apple as a moisturiser for the tobacco pouch, but
Hacker strongly opposes this, his thesis proved by irrefutable
experience. When given Uncle Fred's treatment, Hacker's tobacco grew
a beard of white fungus that polluted the container as well, causing
new tobacco to be bearded in its lair in not much more time than it
took with apple at first. He had to discard tobacco and container to
be rid of the dead hand of apple. I agree with Hacker, eat apples
rather than making them lie in the same bed as your best baccy.
There is an easier way to maintain the moist springiness of your
leaf.

Not only that, it is no secret either as you will see when you read
on. Use plastic, food-grade, reseal containers such as Tupperware or
Rubbermaid, or similar high-quality product if you are living
outside the United States. You could go to a Tupperware party,
however, Rubbermaid can be had for a few bucks at most large grocery
stores. My Rubbermaid container is round and of three cups capacity.
Into this I put my fresh tobacco. What will serve for pipe tobacco
will answer just as well for cigars, choose an airtight plastic
container to fit your smokes.

Even with your "smokeables" sealed in Tupperware, they will dry out
eventually through repeated opening and closing of the container.
Some people recommend adding a few drops of water or brandy, which
works but is not homogeneous humidification; some parts will be
wetter than others. You can buy a button humidifier if you can find
one. Instead, make one as I did out of a plastic pot one and one-
half inches in diameter by one-half inch thick.

First find your plastic pot. A good place to look is in your local
natural-foods-health-freak shop. In such a place, should you never
have entered, there are all manner of unguents, and goo for sale in
small quantities, packaged in just the kind of container you need,
plastic and rustproof. I found a plastic pot containing something
that looked like refined earwax, priced at around $2. Buying this,
I carried it home where I scraped out the "earwax" with the spoon
end of my pipe-tool, holding the pot under running hot to dissolve
and disperse the residue. Finally, I wiped it out and peeled off the
manufacturer's label from the lid.

Next, I marked the lid to receive several holes one-eighth of an
inch in diameter. Laying the open lid on a block of wood, holding it
in one hand, I drilled the hole pattern with my battery powered
drill. With this done, I needed a non splash medium for the
moisturiser.

Unbeknownst to my wife, I raided her cosmetics' box, carrying away
a quantity of cotton-wool pads. Cutting these to fit, I stuffed the
pot with several. I wetted the cotton-wool with distilled water
before snapping shut the lid. Having done this, I then placed my
homemade humidifier with my tobacco, inside the Rubbermaid
container, making sure that the tobacco didn't come into direct
contact with the moist cotton through the holes in the lid. You
could be a flash cove by attaching the humidifier to the lid of the
Rubbermaid humidor by Velcro,  but I don't bother.

Fancier yet is the addition of a maximum and minimum hygrometer.
While not essential it is a neat device to add when you can spare
$25. You can buy these from Radio Shack for much less than Edmund
Scientific.

Now my tobacco stays moist without difficulty and I can enjoy my
occasional smoke without fear of drought. All this for less than
$10, not including an hygrometer.

Should you be new to smoking a pipe then consider the humble corn-
cob as a place to start. Missouri Meerschaum sell them for less than
$5. They smoke cool and dry and may be of most use to those who like
aromatic, heavily flavoured tobacco. At that price you could afford
to have several so as not to burn them out too quickly, for they
don't last like briar. Hacker tells us that the corn is a special
variety grown for its cob, more dense than usual. Once shucked of
its kernels, the cob is turned into a pipe and soaked in a secret
mix of plaster of paris, this to prevent it from burning out too
quickly. Corn cob is absorbant, more so than briar, and they are
easily grown, unlike briar. Kernels are sold to the tortilla chip
industry. Perhaps you expect the smoker of a corn cob to go
barefoot, clad in bib overall, wearing a straw hat? In a place like
Wall Street, you could be in the vanguard of fashion with your corn
cob, in your shirtsleeves and red suspenders on the floor of the
stock exchange, smoking a plug of "Elizabethan Mixture" or of
"Fragrant Anise". With corn cobs, a sixteenpenny flathead nail as a
pipe-tool, and a Rubbermaid humidor, your biggest expense will be
tobacco. And you could grow that if you consider Coltsfoot.

Well, we are smoking the dottle. In my next puff we will see what
the folks at Ted's have to say, if I can find their brochure. After
that I shall, I think, knock out the ash and take a back seat to
these proceedings.

[ Thanks, Andrew! From some discussion elsewhere, the spongy styrofoam
stuff that florists use to stick cut flowers in also works well as a
humidifying agent; one could replace the cotton wool with that,
too. -S. ]

Dear Steve and Fellow Pipe-Fans:

I've been an avid pipesmoker for just under 20 years (I'm 40). I started off
on pipes as a way to spell my cigarette usage, and later to wean myself off
the sticks altogether. The was a time (about four yers ago) when I had well
over $500 worth of pipes, racks, humidors and related equipment; I went
through a two-year Puritan stint, and got rid of all of it. So now, after
trying abstinence and not liking it, I'm back on pipes with a much humbler
collection of pipes and related materials (OH well!). I still have a Comoy,
and Peterson bulldog from my fatter years, so I'm not altogether on "Tobacco
Road," as it were.

As for my tobacco tastes, well I'm afraid that I must admit to being among
the relatively "great unwashed;" I smoke a Vanilla aromatic suppliewd by
Dream Castle Tobacco Company, of Richmond, Va. 23224. I've tried English
blends, both mild and strong, I don't personally care for them. 

My attraction for pipes extends back into my early childhood; all the
pipesmokers I knew seemed to be intelligent and rational people, and I was
attracted to that. I was especially attracted to it, after I started
cigarettes, as it seemed that they were anything *but* relaxing! It took me a
few years to "grow" into a pipe, that is to feel that I wasn't some kind of
kid pretending to be a grownup; I guess turning 40 has a way of making you
feel that you're not pretending anymore! 

Anyway, I've read and enjoyed many of the digests in here, and look forward
to reading more. Also, if I may be heretical, anyone who happens to also like
and occasional pricey stogie and finds his/herself in downtown Chicago might
want to visit "Old Chicago Smoke Shop" on 10 South LaSalle Street ZipCode
60603 (Ph#: 1-800-621-1453); it's a friendly store with a great variety of
product.

Happy Puffing,

<a name="16">Subject: about this group and tobacco pouches</a>

Hi Steve and all the pipesmokers in the net!

At first I thank You Steve for organizing and keeping this group. But after 
the thanks I will give my opinion concerning the organization of the group.
As a pipe smoker I'm not very enthusiasted in reading these stories about 
cigars and cigarettes. Could it be possible to organize the group according 
to various means of smoking? The main part of the mailing list is 
interesting and I wouldn't leave without it for any reason. But ...

The quotations of Ehwa's pipe-book have been quite interesting and I give my 
best regards to "Andrew ?????@???.???.???" for providing these wonderful 
quotations, although I must say that ethically this kind of practise is "on 
the line". But I think it's O.K. because the book is so rare and difficult 
to get.

Thirdly I complain about the information we get from the tobacco 
pouches.Wouldn't it be interesting to know, what are these "Oriental 
tobaccos" we have for example in the Amphora Regular ("the brown pouche") in 
addition to Burley, Kentucky and Virginia. BTW, are these B- &amp; K- &amp; 
V-tobaccoes so unamigious? Does anybody have the information concerning 
Amphora Regular? 
I know that this mixture is not quite highly regarded among pipe tobaccoes, 
but it's not so easy to get all these Latakias etc. here "in the backside of 
Lord's ass".

        Waiting for the next list.

                Antti Kalliokoski, Finland

[ Well, Antti, I generally just send the submissions in the order I
receive them. Organizing them in the way you suggest would be a lot of
work, and somewhat prone to error. And there would be some that don't
fit anyway (from people who smoke both pipes and cigars, for
instance.) 

Perhaps I could suggest that readers put [CIGAR], [PIPE], [HOOKAH], or
whatever in their subject lines, to make it easier for other readers
to scan through the Digest? -S. ]

 I have been downloading the file containing the messages from compuserve,
but would prefer to get it on  the aol.  I have not used the internet
connection before and am just starting to learn. Please excuse any errors or
faux pas which I may make.  I did notice the many messages about Escudo. I
smoked it many years ago and just went out to buy some.  Tried it again and
it was very good. To those who cannot get it you might suggest McBaren's Dark

<a name="19">Subject: Pipes in Rochester?</a>

I'll be in Rochester, NY for a day or two in late January and am 
wondering if anyone has any suggestions of a pipe shop that I should 
find while in town.  Since I'm a Canadian, I won't miss the chance to 
return to Canada with a pound of tobacco at a decent price AND 
duty-free.  I'll also float through Albany, NY and won't miss the chance 
to stop at The Smoker, one of my favourite places, and pick up some of 
their "Smoker" blend, an exceptionally rich English blend.  I've never 
smoked anything quite like this blend, which smells more like a campfire 
than a campfire does.   I have no idea what is in that blend to give it 
that flavour, although I suspect that if I try some of the McLelland 
blends that were mentioned in the last digest that I might find something 
similar.

To respond to another item mentioned in the last digest, I will volunteer 
that I too have had dreams about pipes.  I had my first one nearly 
immediately after I started smoking one.  Often I find myself on the deck 
of a ship, somewhere off the coast of Labrador, Canada (a place I have 
always wanted to visit), puffing away as happily as can be... 

Quite simply, there is something wonderful about smoking a pipe that is 
absolutely like nothing else.  My father smoked a pipe for a short while, 
but I remember him as a cigarette smoker, although he no longer smokes at 
all.  I suppose he never got to enjoy a pipe   that much, or he wouldn't 
have stopped, but I often find it strange that he never introduced me to 
it, whereas cigarettes were considered acceptable more or less.  I know 
that if had a family, I would much prefer that they smoke pipes than 
cigarettes.

Anyway enough rambling for now, just wanted to find out if there's 
anything in Rochester, NY, didn't see anything in the resource guide.

Happy smoking all, and happy new year

For once, little administrativa. I did get the information, via Steve
Rosenberg (who describes the "Churchill's" cigar bar in this issue)
that the California smoking ban has an escape clause for places where
tobacco is the primary draw. Hopefully, this will mean that we'll see
more cigar bars and smoking clubs, wherein our members can gather to
smoke in peace. I would appreciate information on any such places, and
will publish it in the Resource Guide as I receive it.

And now, join us in our cozy worldwide pipe-and-cigar friendly hangout
as we discuss books, Kaywoodies, Haarlem (which is _not_ in either New
York or Sweden), Fonsecas, Phantasm III, Dunhill collectibles, New
York (which is _not_ in either the Netherlands or Sweden), sedate
pouches, Long Beach (which is _not_ in New York, the Netherlands, or
Sweden), wood preservative, and other strange bits...

Hello Steve,

	Thank you for adding my name to the mailing list.  If possible 
could you please send me the other 170 Pipe Digest issues?
	Within the last several months I have attempted to contact 
Robert W. Stockes, formally of 2111 Brinberry Street, Houstan, Texas 
77018.  My letters to him, were returned from to my by the post office 
with no forwarding address available.  I would appreciate if you could 
assist me in my attempt to correspond with him or find his Collector's 
Guide To Kaywoodie Pipes.  I'm intrested in buying a copy of his book or 
having the chance to photocopy it.
	As a pipe smoker of four years, I have recently started to 
collect estate pipes.  I'm currently collecting JHW, Charatan, Ben Wade 
Freehand smoking pipes.  I have found information on these pipes hard to 
come by and would look forward to exchaning information on these pipes 
with any one else of similar intrest.
	In the last issue of the Pipes Digest, a man mentioned using 
Rubber made air tight containers to store pipe mixtures.  I find this 
method of storage a sound one.
			Best Regards!  

[ Issues sent, I hope! Can anyone help Philip find Mr. Stockes? If
not, a rare book dealer might be able to help with the Kaywoodie
guide. Or check "With Pipe and Book." -S. ]

Hello Steve,

Thanks for your swift reply. I am very glad to join. First of all I
would like to wish you and all other readers a very happy 1995.
 
It is quite difficult to "meet" other pipe smokers, they have become a
rare breed.  The Internet however is an excellent way to exchange
news, etc.

My name is Ad van Bever, male, 33 years of age and married. I live in
Rotterdam, in the Netherlands. For most Americans an unknown place,
situated in Sweden.  This is not correct . It is a country known for
its tulips and its capital Amsterdam.

I started pipe smoking at 16. It was, at that time, an experience to
be enjoyed behind closed doors. Being 16 and smoking something like a
pipe was simply not done.  The years progressed and it became easier
to show me and my pipe to the outside world.

I also smoke the occasional sigart, but I prefer smoking a pipe. I
have a collection of 12 pipes. But when I pass a smokers shop it is
still hard to resist a new model.  I don't like the fancy colours
much, because they easily become dated.

My tobacco preferences are:

- Captain Black which I can not buy over here. I bought it some years
ago in the United States.
- Mac Baren London Blend
- W Q Larsen Danish mixture
-  Dunhill Black Aromatic and  the mixture of the month, which I buy whenever
  I am in London.
- Sail yellow mixture
- Alsbo gold

I am looking forward to receive new messages from other pipe smokers
all over the world.

Greetings, 
Ad van Bever

<a name="5">Subject:  Happy New Year!</a>

Hello Steve and fellow pipe-smokers, First of all, best wishes for a
sweet and aromatic New Year! Among other things, 1994 will remain in
my memory as the year in which I rediscovered the pleasures of pipe
smoking, and our illustrious Pipes Digest has been an invaluable help
in this. Thank you so much, Steve, for all the work you put in it!  I
have now received (and printed) nearly all previous installments of
the Digest. The only missing numbers are #86 up to #99. Could you
please send these to me via email?

I showed a copy of the Digest to my favourite tobacconist In Haarlem
(plug follows below). He is very interested in all the back issues (he
hasn't seen the enormous pile yet) and since he has no Internet
connection, I could try and make an arrangement with him: I'll borrow
his copies of Cigar Aficionado (he has a subscription) and in exchange
he can read my Digest copies. His shop is one of the oldest
tobaccoshops in Haarlem, and certainly the best. The address is:

Jan van der Pigge
Grote Houtstraat 81
Haarlem
The Netherlands

It's in the center of the city, opposite to the V&amp;D
department store. They sell coffee, tea and tobacco,
have a nice collection of pipes and a small but well-stocked
humidor. They are friendly, skilled people who take their time 
to help you. They also sell packets of compressed Havana leaves 
(left-overs) that are meant to be smoked in a pipe. Anyone
bold enough to try? And I spotted a piperack (classical style - with 
pillars) with seven Peterson pipes from the Sherlock Holmes series.
Price: about US $ 1250 for the pipes and $ 200 for the rack...
Enjoy your Petersons, and treat 'em with care ;-)

Just as a comment to an excellent idea for a humidor. Since this the time
for recycling, a small 35mm film container (with the snap lid) makes a dandy
button humidifier stuffed with cotton balls or spongy styrofoam as Steve
suggested, drill several small holes in the middle to allow the moisture to
breathe,      en voila !
If you ask at your local photo shop or film processing counter, they can't
get rid of these things and will usually give you dozens...

[ Thanks, Fergie! But be aware that these containers contain residual
chemicals from the film. A small plastic container intended for food
might be a better choice. -S. ]

Hi Steve, and you others out there!
It is christmas all over again! I've been to an antique (read junk) shop, 
and found a collection of 40 fine plus two broken pipes. Half a dozen 
Savinellis (with a nonpareil as my favourit), a couple of Petersons, one a 
silverbanded meerschaum, a Dunhill, a number of Stanwells, and some others 
like a Lorentzo, a Royal Danish et c.

I'm as thrilled as my kids were on Christmas Eve (that is when Santa Claus, 
Jultomten, arrives in Sweden).  I didn't think these things happened in 
Sweden, as collections such as this are far between. And I was lucky enough 
to find this collection before they had sold anything from it. 

Also, a beautiful pipe stand (is that what it is called?) with room for 
tobak, of a beautiful dark wood with intartsia inlays was included. The 
price? 400$! I'm happy!

[ "Pipe stand" is correct, and it sounds like you've had a wonderful
piece of luck, Jon! Happy holidays! -S. ]

Joe Bob Briggs  "Drive-In Movie Critic of Grapevine, TX" 
  from the Dallas Observer 12/15/94

  I just got kicked out of a hotel bar for smoking a cigar.  I don't mind
so much gettin' kicked out, 'cause it was a 15-dollar Bolivar and I
managed to save it without havin' to smush it out in an ashtray.
  But what bugged me was this: THERE WAS NOBODY IN THE BAR!  And I was 
in the SMOKING SECTION!
  Am I the only one, or has anybody else noticed that cigar-smokers are
just slightly above heroin addicts in terms of social respectability?
  People complained about the smell as they were walking by on the Midway!
If they hated the smell, then they hated the smell of the finest tobacco
in the world.
  It's also interesting to me that, the more expensive the restaurant, the
more they LIKE cigars, and the cheaper the restaurant, the more they HATE
cigars.
  You can still smoke cigars in all the restaurants of the Plaza Hotel in 
New York, but you can NEVER smoke a cigar in the smoking section of a
McDonald's.
  Anyhow, here's my point on this.  I don't mind being considered the scum
of the earth for cigar-smokin', but I'd like to point out a couple things.
  Numero Uno, it's the CIGARETTES that smell bad.  And the reason they smell
bad is that most of what you're smelling is PAPER.  People are burning paper.
A cigar, on the other hand, is one hundred per cent tobacco leaf.  Cigarettes
were invented in the 1890's as a way to sell the WASTE PRODUCTS from cigars-
the part left over- the SMELLY PART.
  Numero Two-o, when people say "How can you put that poison into your body?"
they're missing the point again.  A cigar is something you taste, in your 
mouth, like cognac.  A cigarette is something you draw into your LUNGS, to
get a rush, like opium.
  Numero Three-o, when people complain about cigars, they're not REALLY
complaining about the particular cigar you happen to be smoking.  They're
really saying, "You're a disgusting human being for havin' that thing at all."
In other words, it's not the cigar that people hate.  It's the guy that smokes
it.
  I don't know why this is, but, believe me, I'm a veteran of the tobacco wars.
It's true.

Hello Steve, and my fellow pipesmokers:

I sent in an intro a while back, when you experienced some technical problems
and sent some data into cyber-oblivion. In any case, here is a little
background from a most appreciative reader of the Digest.

My name is John Rinaldi. I live in San Jose, CA and have been smoking pipes
and cigars for the last 11 years. Currently I've got about 75 pipes in my
collection, mostly large bent briars, with some freehands, straights and an
occasional meerschaum thrown in for good measure. Favorite brands are Ser
Jacopo, Ashton, Savinelli, Peterson, Bari, Preben Holm and Ascorti to name a
few. I favor heavy English blends with lots of Latakia, and also love
full-bodied, large cigars (like Hoyo de Monterrey Excalibur #1s and Davidoff
Special "R's).

I welcome e-mail from any and all interested pipe/cigar smokers, as I simply
cannot get enough of our wonderful shared avocation. In addition, any Bay
Area smokers who'd like to get together for a smoke and a chat sometime
should e-mail me with all due haste. It might be fun to form an informal
"smoking society"...anybody interested?

Thanks Steve, for the digest, it's most enjoyable, and provides a much needed
safe haven/enclave for our embattled ranks.

Bye!

-John Rinaldi (???????@???.???)

[ Welcome to the embattled ranks, John! Hope some of our California
readers will take you up on your kind offer. -S. ]

<a name="10">Subject: Brand-new Vintage Dunhill Root Briar for sale.</a>

Fellow pipe smokers/collectors,

After thinking long and hard I decided to sell one of my Dunhills.
Don't jump the gun and scream "What!! Is this guy crazy??".  The
reasons behind it will soon be clear.

First, like any good pipe smoker/collector I like to diversify my
portfolio.  So I am basically selling this one to invest in other
pipes.  Second, the pipe I intend to sell is the same size and style
of another Dunhill I have.

DISCLAIMER:  I have no commercial interest in selling this pipe.  I do
not sell pipes for a living. (I smoke pipes for a living :-))

But the best is yet to come.  This pipe is not only an outstanding
smoking pipe, IT IS A COLLECTIBLE.

I am proposing to sell the following pipe:

A Dunhill Root Briar, BRAND NEW, UN-SMOKED from 1964.  The markings on
the pipe tells it all:

    ROOT BRIAR
    Shape: 715
    MADE IN ENGLAND4  (meaning it was made in 1964, since there are no
                       lines under the 4, see Hacker's "Ultimate Pipe Book")
    A number 4 encircled by an O, followed by an R  ( size group 4,
                                                      medium to large 
                                                      the R for Root Briar)

The pipe is a billiard shape (shape 715) of medium size (size group
4).  It is beautifully finished and polished.  It has a very
interesting grain pattern: horizontal straight grain on the front and
back of the bowl and bird's eyes pattern on the sides.  The pipe comes
in its ORIGINAL box from Dunhill, which includes a little booklet
about the company and how to smoke a pipe. (They didn't have
alt.smokers.pipes then :-)).

Now, that many of you may have dropped the pipe out of your mouth,
let's talk business.  I have seen many a Dunhill Root Briar around,
new, non-vintage, selling in the $300 to $500 dollar range.

Well, I decided to have a little electronic auction on this pipe.
Here are the rules:

1) I will set an initial price for the pipe.  The initial price is
US$ 380.00 (about my initial investment in it)

2) I will wait for a week for replies to MY ACCOUNT only, not to
alt.smokers.pipes (I will not consider messages to the newsgroup!!).
The message should state that the person is interested in the pipe.
It must also mention if the person wants to accept this price or bid a
different price.  My account is: ?????@??????.???

3) After a week (this message is also going to the Pipes Mailgroup), I
will reply to all persons that sent me messages stating the higher bid
and opening for new bids.

4) I will repeat this process only 3 times.  After that the highest
bid will win and the pipe is sold.

Well, send in your messages.  As I mentioned in the beginning of this
post this pipe is a collectible.  I have one very similar to it and it
smokes wonderfully.  You may want to invest or buy it to enjoy.

This is a first grade pipe.  Considering the fact it's a 1964 Dunhill
Root Briar, brand new pipe, I would say it's a BARGAIN.  Sad to see it
go, but new ones will come.

Good luck.

- Elias Mazur

<a name="11">Subject: Hello fellow Cigar Smokers!</a>

Hi there,

As a Cigar Smoker I am really excited to have found a forum for us smokers.
In the past month I had a few Catalogs sent to me, which some act like a
newsletter, as well as Cigar Afiicionado magazine, which all add to my love
for the cigar.

I smoke a variety of cigars from a mild to medium strength cigar.  I am still
trying to find the cigar of my liking. At this point I am leaning towards the
Ashton 898's.  

I would like some advise on how to keep cigars fresh if one does not have a
humidor. I have looked into a humidor but have found the prices too bit a
quiet bit high.  I have tried to look for used ones but so far been unable to
find any.  If any of your readers might be selling one please contact me
Chris (??????????@???).  I presently use a tupperware container. I am
considering purchasing cigars that are in Texas (great prices) but I am
concerned that the UPS trip will dry them out and the tupperware would not
revive them. Any suggestions would be great.
Also, does anyone know about build your own humidor plans?

I look forward to every newsletter I receive, keep up the  good work.
Thanks,
Chris Harris

[ Well, Chris, there's a whole 2000+ line FAQ on humidors on the Web
site; see the tag line for the address, or I'll send it to you if you
can't access the Web. ???????@???.??? also sells humidor plans for a
very reasonable price (has anyone reviewed these BTW, Chavete?) -S. ]

        My mailer is only letting me send short messages, so I'll be brief.
Spent some time in Buffalo, NY this holiday, and as usual scoped out the
pipe scene.  Discovered a Smoker's Haven (no connection with Columbus
stores of same name) with not only a great selection of less expensive
pipes, but also 40 house tobacco blends, a great cigar humidor and a
while-you-wait repair shop.  Address:
                Smoker's Haven
                1167 Union Road
                West Seneca, N. Y. 14224
        I picked up a few Romeo y Julietta cigars (rare in Columbus!), an
old reconditioned Nording freehand (smokes great - this guy's an artist),
and a sampler pack of tobacco.  I recommend the Vintage 1, a warm bright
virginia (I think).  Can't tell if it's cased - real light if it is.
        Looking for suggestions on Peterson pipes.  I want to try a System
pipe and my wife, Gabrielle, wants to try a top-slot bit.  Anyone have a
favorite?
        Gabrielle says "Hi" and wonders if anyone else discovered that pipe
smoking and the flu don't mix.  She found out that Cavindish and sinus
drain aren't the best of combinations.
        Well, as I said, I'll cut it short.  Have a great flu season, and
keep warm.  We remain, as always,

the two-hole bits?  Re Petersons, my favorite is a full-bent apple

I'm not at all suprised at Gabrielle's findings; this weekend, I
discovered that Cuprinol wood preservative and MacBaren's Club Blend
are not an ideal mixture either. In fact, Cuprinol, when splashed into
the face, doesn't go very well with anything, except maybe an eye-wash
at the hospital. |-P (BTW, everything's OK now.) -S. ]

Hello there Steve!!!  I haven't corresponded in about a week so I decided to
drop a line.

I've read the first 32 editions of Pipes Digest and (as always) I enjoyed
every last passage.  I have some questions and comments about those issues in
relation to the issues today:

First of all, I think it would be a good idea to incorporate Elias Mazur's
glossary of tobaccos (PD #6) into the "How-To" letter you send out to
beginners like myself.  So far, that has been the single most important two
pages I have read thus far in PD.  For beginners, all the fancy talk about
Latikia and Cavendish can be quite intimidating.  

Also, I read that you will cease to send the PD to persons if the mail
continues to bounce and if you can't get in touch with that person.  In case
you can't get a hold of me through E-Mail, my phone # is [ deleted at
Brandon's request... -S. ]

Last question:  Why don't we hear from you as much as the charter members did
in the first few issues.  Back then, you would write a little intro or
conclusion letter.  I really found those helpful and entertaining.  Even
though you add comments to the end of most letters now, could you try putting
in a short letter to wrap up the digest?  BTW, belated congratulations on
your PhD!!!

Well, I must be off now in order to hunt for a corn-cob pipe to start off
with.  Wish me luck!!!

Yours truly,
Brandon

P.S.  I plan to visit the "Tobacco Museum" in Nashville sometime between now
and summertime.  I'll be sure to let some people know what it has to offer,
besides free admission :-) 

[ Thanks for your note, Brandon! The reason I'm not writing as many
messages as in the past is that I often did so in times of slow
traffic, when the group only had about forty members and submissions
occasionally got sparse. The Pipes Mailgroup now has enough traffic,
and membership, to sustain itself, so I only put in a message when I
have a personal anecdote to share. I usually write a few
administrativa and notes of (hopefully) general interest at the top of
the Digest, and otherwise just insert parenthetical rejoinders such as
this one. 

The idea of incorporating Elias's descriptions into the How-To is an
excellent one, which I will hopefully accomplish Real Soon Now. -S. ]

To: Pipes Digest  (CIGAR)
From:  Jim Farrell

   Steve,

    Can you or any of the subscribers recommend a place to purchase a quality
cigar humidor?  Preferably something with a pine (or possibly oak) finish to
complement my furnishings.  I live in the Washington, D.C. area, and would
prefer to keep within the Baltimore/D.C. area.  How about a reliable
mail-order source as well?

    Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

-Jim

[ Aside from the DC smokeshops mentioned in the Guide, does anyone
have a suggestion? -S. ]

Steve,

[ Administrativa deleted. -S. ]

Seems like everyone is either away for a January break from
classes or busy with getting started for the new year.  I am
surprized that we have heard little about new acquisitions at
the Holiday Season.  For my part I received a very nice
Charatan Executive Extra Large with smokes like a joy and a
Caminetto Red Briar, both used but magnificently restored to
look like they were fresh from the store.  I am lucky to be the
second (third or fourth?) person to have the pleasure of
breaking them in and getting to know them.

Best wishe for a Happy New Year.

<a name="4">Subject: Knockoff Alert--J&amp;R</a>

J&amp;R has made some lofty claims about their copies of premium cigars. They
challenged us to try them and promised we would be pleased. All I can say is
that when something appears too good to be true, it *is* too good to be true.
A Davidoff lover for 15 yrs, first the havanas and now the dominicans, I feel
myself to be somewhat of an expert on the brand. I tried the Grand Cru #1
knockoff ( cost of $1.25 vs "real thing" at $8.25 ) and it was awful. Not to
be a snob, I would guess that a newbie to cigars ( ala my initial smoke of
A&amp;C in 1968 @ $.20) will consider the fakes to be OK on a cost/benefit basis.

For the member looking for a cheap humidor in PD#172, I suggest a method I
have used successfully for years. I have a real humidor that only holds 25
cigars. To take care of any overflow I use an old Nat Sherman cedar box that
held 50 cigars in an upright position with a cedar divider (25/25). I take a
sponge, wet it and wring out excess water and place it in one half of the
box--the sponge is never in direct contact with the cigars. It really works
well as long as you carefully monitor the moisture level.

For anyone interested in premium cigars, I came across a guy in AOL who is
the founder of Cigar of the Month Club. When you join you get four cigars a
month, you get info on them, and you rate them for inclusion in a monthly
newsletter. I just joined and I am delighted with the results, from the
cigars to the packaging to the quality materials. Anyone interested can
contact Craig Nelson (??????@???.???). 

Finally, for those of you who are fed up with the signs that say "smoking
permitted....no cigars or pipes allowed", CA has published an excellent guide
to cigar friendly restaurants. 

Happy Puffing,
Sid Gibson

Steve,
	Just thought I would pass on this item of interest which was 
reported in the Rocky Mountain News this past Saturday, 7 Jan. 1995:
	Einstein pipe sold at auction
   "The pipe Albert Einstein smoked and a game the Nobel Prize-
winning physicist played as a child sold for $20,000 at an auction
Saturday.  Auctioneer Jim Smith of Remember When Auctions of Portsmouth
would not reveal the name of the buyer but said it was a private collector
not a museum or institution.  Einstein died in 1955 and is most famous
for his discovery of the theory of relativity.  He was often pitcured (sic)
smoking the pipe."

For those that don't know about it, the Big Smoke is Cigar 
Aficionado's trade fair/get together for cigar smokers. It is held in 
various cities. I have never been to one but I understand that 
you receive a coupon book that you redeem for free cigars from 
various manufacturers. Fine restaurants have samples of their 
food, and drink makers have samples of their product, as well.
The one I am going to is in Washington, DC on March 1, 1995. It 
will be held at the J.W. Marriott from 6:30 to 9:30. Marvin 
Shanken is trying to get a permit to hold a "protest smoke" in 
Lafayette Park across from the White House at 5:00. We are 
going to try to meet there for a smoke and walk to the 
Marriott. I am hoping to get all AOL and ASC board members to 
meet for a photo and to show some solidarity to the cigar 
smoking world. I don't know what that will mean but maybe 
Marvin will do an article on us or even have a special event 
for us down there. I just want to make sure he knows about us 
because we have to be one of the most knowledgeable groups of 
cigar smokers out there. And we are untainted by any commercial 
affiliations. Starting about February 1, I hope to start 
collecting names of those of you who will be there and figure 
out how we can get together for a group photo, at the very 
least.
For more info on the Big Smoke, call CA at 1-212-481-0330. You 
can fax your request for tickets to 1-212-684-5424. Tickets 
cost $125.00 each. 
See you there.

Dear Steve --
I've finally taken the step of actually subscribing to the Pipes Digest 
(I've been lurking periodically at the WWW site!).  I'm a relatively recent 
cigar smoker (8 months or so), a participant in alt.smokers.cigars newsgroup 
and growing in my appreciation of fine cigars every day.  Perhaps one day I 
may join the ranks of pipe smokers as well.

Thank you for the welcome message and background / reference info.  One 
problem however ... my network mail system prohibited my viewing any info 
following the British Banker's Club restaurant listing.  Without too much 
problem, would it be possible to re-send the list from that point forward 
for me?  It would be much appreciated.

Best wishes, and I look forward to reading and participating in the Pipes

they've got an excellent selection of tobacco and hardware.

I've been pipe smoking now for four years, and embrace it mainly because

<a name="9">Subject: Pipes Digest - Erinmore Flake</a>

Gidday Steve

A little note about Erinmore Flake...
After the big discussion in a.s.p about Erinmore Flake, and the Erinmore
mixture, I decided I had to try some. The first bowlful reminded of nothing
so much as the bubble bath my little sister got for her birthday one year
when we were kids.

I tried some more over the next week or so, just to be sure, and after a
few bowlfuls I decided there was more to it than that - notes that could be
described as spicy or exotic. In fact, it made a pleasant chnage to the
Dunhill Aromatic and the Royal Yacht I'd been smoking.

PROBLEM: each pipe that I smoked Erinmore Flake in reeks (good word -
derived from roots meaning "smoke" and "smell") of it, and it takes three
or for bowlfuls to get rid of most of the taste. I think I'll have to
reserve a pipe for EF only. Of course if you really liked the stuff

Does anyone know what's in EF that makes it so pungent? I'm almost afraid
to try the mixture now. Is it similar?

Best regards

Stephen

Steve:
     In Pipes Digest #172, there was a suggestion to use 35mm film packages 
as humidifiers.  An alternative that I have found practical is to use small 
prescription drug bottles.
     After removing their labels, wash them thoroughly.  Insert a wadded-up
half of a paper towel, moisten with distilled (or purified) water, and then
add some pure grain alcohol or inexpensive liquor (alcohol will prevent the 
formation of mold). Place the cap on the bottle (the non-child-proof kind 
work best), and drill or cut two or three small (1 mm) holes in the cap.
     The humidifier thus constructed will be smaller than the film bottle 
type.  Instead of paper towels, one can use cotton, that foam-like green 
stuff for sticking flowers in, or discarded pieces of fired ceramic 
"bisque-ware" (check your local ceramic shops).

<a name="12">Subject: finding humidor/inexpen cigars</a>

My new humidor arrived about a month ago and I was sharing w/ another 
cigar smoker how it came about.  It became obvious that I needed to 
forward a copy to you to edit for the Digest so here it is...

++++++++++++++

I have looked into a humidor but have found the prices too bit a
quiet bit high.  Does anyone know about build your own humidor plans?

++++++++++++++

How about a free one?  And 50 free cigars to boot?  Of course there's a 
catch.  I joined the bonus club from Thompson [1-800-237-2559] about a 
month ago.  I agree to accept a shipment of at least 25 cigars at least 
every 12 weeks.  I choose the cigars from their catalog, usually with a 
wrapper choice; and can change with up to one week's notice.  In return, 
they sent a humidor with my first shipment and will give me 50 cigars 
whenever I accumulate 500 cigars purchased.  No, I don't have any 
financial connection to the store   I started with a sampler from them 
about a couple years ago and have been very happy with what I received.  
[The sampler was only so-so, but that's the breaks.]

And how about two more offers for inexpensive cigars?  Te-Amo is offering 
10 Toros for $10 [they claim worth $23.50].  Just send a check or money 
order to Te-Amo Cigars, PO Box 407166BA, Ft. Lauderdale, FL 33340-7166 
and allow 8 weeks for delivery.  Not available to minors and limited to 
one per customer. The second offer comes from International Cigar Club 
[1-800-729-9717].  They will ship "4-6 assorted premium cigars from 
around the world along with our informative newsletter shipped directly 
to you each month" for only $9.95 +S&amp;H.  My first package was just 
ordered last week so I can't give a personal recommendation just yet.

Looks like I had better send Steve a copy for the Digest, doesn't it?

pipes.
Well,a little bit about myself.I hope nobody goes to sleep.
 My name is Karl Williams.I am 29 years old for a few more months before the
big 30.I am not looking foward to it at all.I'm married to a lovely lady that
didn't object to me starting to smoke a pipe a few years ago.Not only
that,but when I took her to my favorite tobbaconist (Ok, so it is the only
one in town,but the people couldn't be any nicer).She found a little Kings
Cross and fell in love with it.Since that point we have had to upgrade our
pipe rack three times.At this point she has ten pipes and I have ten.There
are still five pipes on order between the both of us.
   We both work at Harrah's casino in Vicksburg,Ms.(Plug for the old home
team...What the hey,I own stock in the sucker now.)I deal Craps and she deals
everything else.
    We have no kids,but we do have pets.I have a cockatiel and she has a
twelve foot Burmese python that occationally wants to eat the cockatiel.The
bird really doesn't care for this situation,but the cage is holding up so
far.Somewhere in the house is a California king snake.We really aren't sure
where,but she should turn up come spring.For some reason our friends don't
visit as often as they used to.Wonder if it could be the loose snake? {:)
   Well this is enough meaningless prattle for a while.

Steve,

I am still continuing to enjoy the digest.  I passed a copy on to
my new tobacconist.  I guess I had to leave town and come back for
a visit to find out what a wonderful shop exists here in northern
Colorado.  He is willing to mail-order to me back in Louisiana so
it will solve the problem of no shops in Alexandria.  I think a good
tobacconist is almost as difficult and important to locate when moving
as is a good old-fashioned barber shop.  Both seem to be in very 
short supply in today's fast paced world.

I have two simple questions and unfortunately no advice for the less
educated than myself if there are any [ ;) ].  First, how does one 
access the Web page?  I work on an IBM with telnet and FTP capability.
Is this enough or do I need something else?  Second, I am thinking
about heading in the direction of cigars.  Where should a novice start?
I picked up the latest copy of Cigar Afficiando and fell in love.  I
really like the looks and taste of the few robustos that I have tried.
Do you have any recommendations for a starting off point?  Someone
told me not to pay to much attention to the ratings in CA because
they are primarily based on advertising.  This does not quite sound
right so I am looking for a second (or third or forth) opinion.

Thanks for the great job you do and keep up the good work.

May the powers that be smile kindly upon you and yours,
Mark

Hi Steve,

   First let me tell you all a little about me.  I'm 20 and am going to 
Nort Carolina State University.  I recently (within the last month or so) 
started smoking a pipe.  I rember my father and grandfather smoking pipes 
when I was younger, and loved the smell.  In fact, about five years ago, 
my mother and I decided that my father was going to stop smoking cigarets 
in the house, so we went to a local (DC area) pipe store, and bought him 
one of their samplers.  Little did we know that the next day he would 
decide to quit smoking all together!  The tobac did not go to waste, he 
gave it to his boss at the time, who has been mail ordering tobacco from 
the store ever since.  
   As far as me, I had been reading the alt.smokers.pipes newsgroup for 
a while and decided to start.  (Using the helpful hints that I found 
there).
   I went to the pipe store (the same one, I'll give the address, etc 
later) and explained to them that I was just staring out, and the 
proprieter was more than helpful.  Suggesting their own special blends 
(of course) and I parted with my first pipe, a tamping tool (I asked for 
one, after reading the www page on lighting up), cleaners, and the same 
sampler that I had bought my father before.
   And you know, aside from not being able to keep it lit, I have 
enjoyed ever smoke.
   So my question:  How to keep it lit?  I am not sure if I'm not packing 
it tight enough, too tight, or maybe I'm not pulling the flame down far 
enough.  I have noticed that with every smoke It seems to stay lit 
longer, but I still haven't been able to finish an entire bowl.  When I 
think that I have, I empty it out, and find tabacco still at the bottom.  
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
  Shawn McKnight

I need help regarding, cleaning my pipes.  

I have looked at many books and all are very vague regarding the timing
of using pipe cleaners, reamers and sweetners.  

None have shown me a way, if there is a way, to get the black build-up
off of the top edge of the bowl.

Can anyone out there mail me direct, and/or on the digest, regarding
these problems?

I would be most appreciative.

Sincerely,

Recently, I had to travel with six or seven cigars in my luggage.
I don't have a whole lot of cigar paraphernalia (my home humidor
is a wooden cigar box with a piece of wet foam in it) so I was
stumped for a good portable solution.

Eventually, I used a video cassette case. It was one of the kinds
that's vacuformed plastic, so it had a very good airseal. I think it
used to contain Disney's Fantasia.

It worked really well, keeping my cigars humid for the whole trip, and
keeping them protected in my suitcase. I wouldn't use it for long term
storage (there was some condensation on the inside) but for a short
trip, it was great!

Steve,

I've recently moved to central Virginia from Houston.  I was afraid that
mailorder was going to be my only means of acquiring fine
pipes/cigars/tobacco.  I am pleased to report to all your readers that
there is a fine place in Roanoke, VA called "Milan Bros." (contact info to
follow).

The shop is well stocked and the owner, Don Ray, is a likeable gentleman
with a long track record in the business.  He bought the store a few years
ago when he moved here from Coral Gables, FL.

The humidor is well stocked and maintained. The variety of custom blended
tobaccos is excellent.  They are also a newsstand with a huge variety of
magazines and newspapers.

Yes, they also have the requisite accessories, pipes, candy counter, fancy
pens and expensive (and usually unnecessary) gifts.

Don tells me that he does a huge mail order business.  He said that about
25% of his business is through the mail or by phone.

Actually, I'm rather surprised that such a store exists in a small city. Of
course, they provide excellent service and are very friendly.  They are
easier to deal with than some of the better known large tobacconists in
larger metropolitan cities, IMHO.

Contact:        Milan Bros. 
                106 S. Jefferson St.
                Roanoke, VA  24011

Dear Steve,
I've been enjoying the Pipes Digest for some time, and since until
recently, I have been only a cigar smoker, I have refrained from submitting
my "bio" to the group.  I'm a 19 year old frosh at Penn State University
studying to become an English teacher.  A friend of mine, knowing my tastes
well, bought me a lovely briar for my birthday this year (Jan. 1!) and for
the last week or so I've been smoking it will joy.  But oh, if the story
was only so simple!  For quite some time now I've been smitten with a
lovely lady from Michigan, who is, if I may, the personification of the
beauty that lies in the smoking of a fine cigar or pipe.  Elegant, calming,
warm, intricate, and a wonderful companion.  The closest I may come to the
peacefulness I find when I'm near her is the peace I find in a bowl of
cavendish.  So at night, when the streets have calmed to a dull roar, I
treck out with an ounce of a favorite local blend and find a park bench to
sit, smoke and contemplate the moon, a woman, and other beautiful things.
Maybe this doesn't _seem_ like much of a bio, but I hope that this will
remind readers of the soft center that lies at the heart of a pipe smoker.
Love the digest, keep it coming.
Thanks!
P.S.- Here's my own snappy come-back:

I heartily concur with Chris Reinhart's opinion of Carey's Smokeshop (issue
169).  I ordered a full bent apple Peterson "Killarney" some time ago, waited a
week, and then called about the order, since it was only coming from North
Canton (east side of state) to me in Toledo (west side of state).  Their
computers were down, call back later.  This was repeated 4 times over the next
2 weeks.  What service!  And "mission-critical" computers down for 2 weeks?!
Unbelievable!

Other than that, I had a chance to visit Ford &amp; Haig tobacconists in
Scottsdale, AZ during my Christmas vacation in Phoenix.  Nice little place,
bought some of their "Pima" blend, a light Cavendish; and the "Zuni" blend, a
lighter English blend of Latakia, Perique, African, etc.  All their blends had
Southwestern Indian names, which I thought was unique.  They even had a small
selection of pipes, including some estate Dunhills.  Needless to say, my wife,
who doesn't like my pipe smoking, was across the street picking out some
Oaxacan figures to buy!  I found the tobacco infinitely more interesting.

I have been on the prowl for an Upshall (preferably grade B) estate pipe, but
Nikos' and Edwards' latest offerings in December didn't do much for me.  Hope
the January mailings have something.  My father is currently on a business trip
in London and has promised to keep his eye out for anything interesting.  I
just hope he doesn't keep all the good stuff for himself!

BTW, Mr. Moderator, could you send me back issues 85-113, 157-161, and 170? 
Thanks.

     Thanks for including me on your mailing list, and for sending along 
Pipes Digest #172.  I'm looking forward to sharing the interactions and 
accessing the information you're making available.

     I've been a pipe and cigar smoker for about 35 years -- since I was 12 
years old.  While I'm not any sort of connoisseur and probably wouldn't 
recognize a collectable pipe if I stumbled across one, I do enjoy a relaxing 
hour with a good book &amp; a pipe or cigar.  In fact, that's one of my chief 
pleasures in life, and one I wish I had more time to indulge.

     I live in the San Fernando Valley, part of northwestern Los Angeles; 
 I'd be interested to learn of any more Los Angeles-area sources for pipes 
and cigars, as well as smoke-friendly bars, restaurants &amp; clubs.

     Thanks again for providing this service.  I hope to be with you for 
many years to come.

        Recently I purchased a clay pipe.  After all that I have heard
about clay pipes, I expected it to be unbearably strong.  On the
contrary, I found it to be relatively tame.  It is stronger than my
briars, but it wasn't bad at all.  I have noticed that the taste is
notably different.  There is also a unique odor that hints of honey,
though that is from the pipe itself.  Anyone else out there care to
share clay experiences?  And while I'm asking questions, let me pose
yet another:  How does one clean and care for a clay pipe?  I know it
is extremely fragile, and I do handle it gently.  But I am wondering
about the inside.

[ Interesting! Rick Hacker's book mentioned that he once cleaned a
clay by throwing it in the fireplace, though I wouldn't recommend such
treatment myself. BTW, check out Lepeltier's for a different kind of
clay. -S. ]

<a name="28">Subject: Lancer Cigars Question</a>

About a year ago, cigars started appearing in the old Lancer tin boxes 
with a label indicating that the filler contained "100% pre-embargoed 
tobacco leaf from Cuba" (1959 to be exact). A friend of mine used to 
smoke Lancers years ago, so picked up a box. These cigars were definitely 
NOT the Lancers of his youth. He said they tasted like many of the Cubans 
he had had. And they were fairly cheap. His tobacconist couldn't vouch 
for the Cuban content, but he agreed that the cigars were different than 
the old Lancers. I believe Cigar Aficionado responsed to a question about 
these cigars and basically doubted their Cuban authenticity.

Does anyone know the REAL story behind these "Cuban" Lancers? And what 
happened to the old Lancers?

Date: Sunday, January 15, 1995
Time: 12:35 AM

This Friday marked a great day for me. After months of longing and outright
lust I made the move and... I bought a Peterson. I have been lusting for a
Peterson ever since I saw a brochure on them. But I did not find out about
them until I was dedicated to saving money... I need to get back to college,
after all. I kept telling myself I would wait until I finally got to
college--I reward myself then with a new pipe. I just could not wait.
[Rationalization mode on.] After all, what is college? A place of education?
Perhaps. But more so it is a place to learn how to educate one's self. Is not
education the responsibility of the individual; is not education a daily task
for those who seek wisdom and truth regardless of their surroundings? There
is, not two miles away, a library from which I can borrow books and discover
the wisdom of Plato and read the words of Byron and Tennyson. I, myself, have
several Bibles to learn the wisdom of God. I have my father's endless
editions of Shakespeare. I have Hugo; I have Dostoevsky. I have  Virgil. I
have Emerson and Thoreau and Donne and Frost and The Leaves of Grass. Is not
there material here for a life's study? So, I went out and bought the damned
pipe.

To get back to my point...

The pipe is a beautiful medium apple of the Peterson System design. I have a
couple Savinellis, they are not *bad* pipes, but they could definitely be
better. This, this is a *real* pipe. I awaited the first smoking with great
anticipation, all the while keeping in the back of my mind that some find
Peterson's to be hard pipes to break in. It was delightful--though rainy.

I believe that this marks a new stage in my pipe smoking developement. The
pipes I had bought previously, I bought on mere appearance, not smokeability.
I have educated myself a bit and made an educated decision.

To accompany this decision, I made another decision, as well. I wish to learn
to enjoy the English blend. So far, my experience has been extremely limited
and a bit dismal. I shall start searching out mail order companies to cure
the limitations I have faced with the local market; however, that does little
for those--even smokers (though not pipe smokers)--who have complained
greatly about my experimentation with Dunhill's Standard Mixture Mild. They
claimed it smelled *worse* than camel dung! :-)

So, where do I begin? I think I shall give Escudo, Balkan Sobriane, and
Bengal Slices a try; they seem to be popular among the Digest. But, how do I
educate my tongue to taste the subtleties of such tobaccos? As well, how do I
learn what it is I am actually tasting?

Dear Steve:

Just got through downloading and perusing the last few pipe digests.  For
some reason or other I didn't get #168, so I'd appreciate it if you could
please send that one to me at your earliest convenience.  Also - I'm sending
my A &amp; M Gazette article on the '94 L.A. Pipe &amp; Cigar Expo to you via a
separate e-mail.  My thanks go to Neil Murray for giving me the green light
on sharing it with you and all the good people in our group.  BTW - I highly
recommend subscribing to the Gazette.  Neil's doing a great job with it and
he deserves our support.  The subscription rate is $15/year US, and anyone
interested should write to him at 
47758 Hickory St., Apt. 22305, Wixom, Michigan 48393.  I know the Gazette's
probably in the Resource Guide, but I figured the least I could do was give
Neil a plug since he has been 
a dedicated defender of our pursuit.

In Pipes Digest #170 I noticed that Andrew Donovan-Shead discussed the
McClelland Personal Reserve tobaccos being offered by Levin Pipes
International.  Since I have gone through most of the tobaccos in their
samplers I thought I'd take him up on his invitation for someone else in the
group to offer their review.  So here's my 2-cents' worth...

PERSONAL RESERVE MATURED ORIENTAL MIXTURES

So far I've tried only 3 of the 6 tobaccos in this series, but here's what I
have found so far.

Bombay Court - Very fine English blend.  Like Mr. D-S, it reminded me of
Balkan Sobranie #759, although I found it to burn quite well.  I also did not
experience the sharpness on the tongue that he reports.

Bombay Extra - another very fine English blend made more interesting with the
addition of Perique and darkened Virginias.  I actually liked it better than
Bombay Court, but that's because my tastes these days run towards mixtures
that tend to depart from the standard-type English blend.

British Woods Mixture - I fully concur with Mr. D-S - this is an outstanding
tobacco.  The flavor is wonderfully round, with an excellent balance between
the Latakia and other Oriental tobaccos in this blend.  I also found it to be
exceptionally smooth and bite-free.  Anyone who thinks they don't like
English/Oriental mixtures should give this one a try.

Turkish Woods - Mr. D-S was less enthusuastic than I am on this one - a
wonderful blend in my opinion.  The Oriental-Virginia components come through
very nicely, with the Latakia staying in the background and adding some extra
spice and flavor to the smoke.  Although I like a good, full Latakia flavor I
also enjoy the flavors of the non-Latakia Orientals.  What I found unique and
very enjoyable in this blend was the fact that the Latakia doesn't end up
dominating the overall flavor.  For those who don't like the strength of
Latakia in standard English blends this tobacco is definitely worth taking a
chance on.  And I disagree with Mr. D-S concerning "wetness" and difficulty
of burning - I found neither to be the case.

I have also tried 1 of the 2 Oriental Signature blends - Three Oaks.  I found
this to be another 
excellent tobacco. The literature says this tobacco is reminiscent of John
Cotton's old "Smyrna" blend, which I found to be true.  And I like it for the
same reason I enjoyed "Smyrna" - it has a superb flavor which is a departure
from the usual English mixtures.

PERSONAL RESERVE MATURED VIRGINIAS

Blackwoods Flake - A very pleasant tobacco, although I found it to be a bit
bland.

Blackwoods Extra Flake - More full-flavored than Blackwoods Flake, I liked
this one very much.

Brazilian Woods - Once again Mr. D-S and I concur.  A wonderful tobacco, with
the cigar leaf adding spice and flavor without being overpowering.  In fact I
think this is much better than McClelland's other cigar leaf blend, Dominican
Glory, which is in their stock line.  I highly recommend this tobacco for
cigar smokers who want to give pipe smoking a try.

Dark Star - Another wonderful blend.  Smooth, rich flavor - a very satisfying
smoke.

Redwood Flake - Excellent straight Virginia with a very pleasant "bright"
flavor.  I found it to also be unusually smooth and bite-free.  Its natural
sweetness makes it an excellent choice for smokers of aromatics who'd like to
try something different.

St. James Woods - An outstanding blend - the perique adds depth and spice to
the Virginias.  This tobacco has a rich, smooth character which I found
compelling.  You Escudo and Elizabethan fans might want to try this one out!
 In my opinion Mr. D-S sold this 
one short.

 Virginia Woods - Yet another wonderful blend.  Very mellow, round flavor.
 O.K., so maybe the brochure goes a little overboard in its description, but
I did find it to be one of the best Virginia blends I've smoked.

PERSONAL RESERVE FRGAGRANT MATURED VIRGINIA BLENDS

Grey Havens - A very nice tobacco, and that hint of perique goes a long way.

White Downs - Another traditional straight Virginia, similar to Redwoods
flake in its "bright" flavor.  Quite a delightful, slow-burning and cool
tobacco.  Another winner!

Trollshaws - Yet again Mr. D-S and I agree.  This a very enjoyable tobacco,
with an unusual flavor which I found very appealing.  Once again, an Oriental
mixture that's a departure from standard English blends, but even more so
than Bombay Extra, British Woods and Three Oaks.  Another one for those of
you who think you don't like Oriental mixtures.

Moria Gate - Truly outstanding - this is one delicious blend!  A cool smoke
with a rich, complex flavor.  As a veteran pipe smoker I find it rare to
experience the joy of discovery that 
I used to feel when I was starting out, but my first bowl of this tobacco
gave me that feeling.

Deep Hollow - Good, but I consider it to be an aromatic.  Mr. D-S commented
that most of the tobaccos in this series seemed to have a hint of vanilla.
 Frankly, this is the only one where I detected any kind of sweet flavoring
that may have been added.

Deep Elem - Excellent.  A beautiful dark flake with a flavor to match.

Overall I was very impressed by the quality of the tobaccos represented in
the McClelland Private Label Samplers.  In 16 years of pipe smoking I've had
the opportunity to experience many different pipe tobaccos.  And, thanks to
some of my friends, I have also been able to sample vintage tobaccos from 20
and 25 years ago.  All I can say is this:  Even though the old-timers
complain that the quality of tobacco has gone downhill, I think the
McClelland Private Label tobaccos give serious challenge to that assertion.
 And I'm grateful that Kathy Levin is out there making this wonderful stuff
available to us.

In closing I just wanted to let you know that I'm now writing the article on
the EPA's secondhand smoke report for the A &amp; M Gazette.  Mr. Murray has
kindly agreed to let me upload it to you as soon as it's done.  It will
contain a lot of good information, and I hope it'll help in fighting the good
fight.

Best Regards,

Steve J. (aka Briar Man)

<a name="31">Subject: '94 L.A. Pipe &amp; Cigar Expo</a>

L.A.'S THE PLACE!

By Stephen Johnson

October has come and gone, and with it another show here in 
Los Angeles.  Billed as the West Coast Pipe and Cigar Expo, 
the event was held on October 29th and 30th at the LAX 
Marriott hotel. It was the third annual L.A. show, and the 
second one sponsored by our club, the Southwest Pipe and 
Cigar League.  After the outstanding success of last yearM-^Rs 
Expo there was one important question running through our 
minds as we prepared for M-^Q94:  Was last year just a fluke, 
or could we do it again?  For the answer to that question 
just read on, McDuff!

Preparations for the M-^Q94 Expo began towards the end of last 
year as we cast about for another venue.  Our M-^Q93 show was 
held at the LAX Hyatt, and although their facilities were 
adequate my experience there told me that we could do better 
somewhere else.  That somewhere else turned out to be the 
Marriott.  Aside from being a beautiful hotel, the Marriott 
also ended up being very cost-effective since the sales 
office made us an offer that was suprisingly reasonable.  A 
promising start!

Now that we had our venue, it was time to hunker down and 
start putting things together.  We contacted our exhibitors 
from last year, and got in touch with quite a few new people 
as well.  Although a few of our regular exhibitors were 
unable to participate due to schedule conflicts, we easily 
made up for it.  Some of our regulars actually took more 
tables than they did last year, and we also got a fair 
number of first-time exhibitors.  In fact by showtime we 
filled 54 tables, whereas last year we were able to just 
barely fill 50.  Things are looking up!

While we were busy with all this stuff we also had to 
address the other important issue - publicity.  Once again 
we got a valuable assist from a direct mailing, done by 
Nikos Levin who duplicated the mailing his late father did 
for us last year.  We also made the rounds of all the local 
smokeshops, and found to our pleasant surprise that 
attitudes towards the shows are starting to improve.  What 
was new for this year was the high-tech publicity we did for 
the Expo.  Club member Jerry Lustig and I are both 
subscribers to the various online computer services, and 
Jerry in particular performed sterling service through his 
online efforts.  And now itM-^Rs showtime!

Our preshow reception, held on Friday, October 28th, was a 
repeat of last year where exhibitors were allowed to set up 
if they so desired.  This thanks to the above-mentioned Mr. 
Lustig, who again provided our security on both Friday and 
Saturday nights.  The reception was a lot of fun, and the 
anticipation of the weekend was heightened by the sight of 
displays unfolding on tabletops.  The reception petered out 
at 11 p.m., and we all stumbled off to bed.

Saturday started off bright and early, with more exhibitors 
coming in to set up.  At 9 a.m. we opened the doors to the 
public, wondering what the day had in store for us.  The 
action actually started pretty quickly and built up 
throughout the morning.  After a slowdown during lunch time 
the traffic picked up again, and was steady throughout the 
rest of the afternoon.  By the end of the day it appeared 
that we had about the same number of walk-ins as we had on 
Saturday last year.  So far, so good!

After the hectic day it was now time to enjoy the awards 
banquet.  As with our increase of exhibit tables, we also 
enjoyed an increase in banquet ticket sales.  We had 40 
attendees this year (as opposed to 34 last year), and it was 
great to see our banquet room actually filled.  This part of 
the show also allowed us to experience another major 
improvement over the Hyatt - food.  I had heard that the 
MarriottM-^Rs food is top-rate, and after hearing some less-
than complimentary remarks about the food at our banquet at 
the Hyatt last year I was wondering how it would be this 
time.  And how was it?  All I can say is that the Marriott 
lived up to its reputation for fine dining!  We counted some 
real gourmets in our number, and even they were impressed.  
We were also impressed by the fact that this first class 
meal didnM-^Rt cost any more than what weM-^Rd paid at the Hyatt.  
Wow!

After our highly enjoyable meal we moved on to our auction.  
To the tobacciana were added some fine spirits (most of 
which were kindly donated by S.W.P.C.L. member Gordon 
Soladar).  The auction went very well, with spirited bidding 
and an empty table at the end of it.  After the auction came 
the awards presentation.  The winners of our exhibitor 
competition were:  Best briar pipe - Poor RichardM-^Rs Pipe and 
tobacco (for a gorgeous Micoli, one of the few attractive 
MicoliM-^Rs IM-^Rve seen), best meerschaum - Royal Meerschaum 
("Adam and Eve" carved by Sabri.  Incredible piece!), best 
antique pipe - Poor RichardM-^Rs (Louis IVX meerschaum), best 
collection - Bert Bruning of Palm Desert Tobacco (for a 
great collection of Charatans), best pipemaker - John 
Weidemann, best commercial display - Royal Meerschaum, and a 
judgesM-^R special merit award to pipemaker (and a very loyal 
longtime club member) Paul Perri for his outstanding work in 
briar.

Our awards presentation was followed by our guest speaker, 
Jack Ehrmantraut.  JackM-^Rs no-nonsense, "shoot straight from 
the hip" style made for an interesting speech, and what he 
had to say about the business and the future of our pursuit 
gave all of us something to think about.  Our banquet ended 
with a repeat performance by our magician from last year, 
the very talented Bruce Sinclair.  It was a full evening, 
and very enjoyable one.  Thanks go to Lenny Brick of Brick, 
Hanauer for making it even more so with a donation of Santa 
Rosa cigars for the banquet.

Sunday morning saw everyone coming back to get their tables 
ready for the new day.  The doors were once again opened to 
the public at 9 a.m., and once again people started coming 
in.  Foot traffic during the morning was good, with the 
usual slowdown during lunch time.  Attendance in the 
afternoon was decent, although not quite as much as what we 
had last year.  SundayM-^Rs featured event was the pipe smoking 
contest, which began at 2 p.m.  Participation in the contest 
was another aspect of the Expo which showed growth - 12 
contestants vs. the 9 we had last year.  Contest veteran 
Harry L. Slayen (who usually wins) actually ended up coming 
in second this year to S.W.P.C.L. member Rick Newcombe.  
RickM-^Rs finishing time was quite respectable - 1 hour, 5 
minutes and change.  His efforts were rewarded with a 
beautiful "Mrs. Hudson" pipe from PetersonM-^Rs "Return of 
Sherlock Holmes" collector series, generously donated by 
Brad Weinfeld of Hollco-Rohr.  Way to go, Rick!

Raffle prize drawings were held throughout both days, and we 
were grateful to receive a number of door prizes donated by 
both exhibitors and by supporters of the Expo who couldnM-^Rt 
attend.  We would like to thank Rick Hacker, Hollco-Rohr, La 
Plata Cigars, Mastro de Paja, McClelland Tobacco Co., Las 
Vegas Cigar Co., Lane Ltd., Nikos Levin (NML Pipes Direct), 
Jack Ehrmantraut (Edwards Pipes &amp; Cigars) and Douwe Egberts 
for their generous contributions to our raffle.  Also held 
throughout both days were an event new to the Expo - cigar 
smoking contests!

And just what is a cigar smoking contest?  Well, IM-^Rll tell 
you.  First the contestants are each given a cigar of the 
same length and ring guage.  Then the contestants light 
their cigars.  The object is to produce the longest unbroken 
ash.  After the ash falls off the remainder of the cigar is 
measured, then subtracted from the beginning length to 
determine the winner.  Wires or any other kind of support 
are, of course not allowed - just ability and steady nerves.  
As you can imagine, these contests are a real hoot, and we 
had a great time watching the contestants in action!  Our 
thanks go to Hollco-Rohr, Bombay Cigar Society, Las Vegas 
Cigar Co. and the Briar Rose tobacco shop for sponsoring our 
debut cigar smoking contests.  TheyM-^Rll definitely be a 
feature of our next Expo!

All in all, we did have another very successful show.  
Although attendance was down a little from last year, we did 
notice some substantial improvements with this yearM-^Rs walk-
ins.  First, more people were spending money than last year.  
We also noticed that people were staying at the Expo longer, 
and most important - we saw more younger people this year.  
These were important developments, and a sure sign that the 
L.A. show is getting better.

What is also significant to the future of the Expo is that 
we made two important friends this year.  One is Ed Lehmann, 
a collector and member of the Chicago club.  Ed exhibited 
with us for the first time,  and was so impressed with the 
job we did that he said he wished every other show was as 
well-run as ours - a high compliment from a true pipe show 
veteran!  Ed told me that not only is he giving the Expo a 
favorable report to his club, but that heM-^Rll also bring some 
other collectors from that group out for the M-^Q95 show.  This 
will help the L.A. show develop a national reputation - 
something we need to keep building momentum.  EdM-^Rs help is 
valuable, and we greatly appreciate his support!

Our other important friend is Jack Ehrmantraut.  Jack was 
with us in M-^Q92.  He somehow got overlooked last year, but we 
made up for it this year by impressing another pipe show 
veteran (especially so since Jack organizes the annual Pipe 
Collectors International conventions).  As the owner of 
P.C.I., JackM-^Rs support of the L.A. show is quite an asset 
since he has the ability to publicize the Expo on a large 
scale.  The Expo got a very good write-up in his newsletter, 
and he has even given us the M-^Q97 national P.C.I. convention.  
The fact that he is willing to do this shows just how far 
weM-^Rve come in a relatively short period of time.  Mr. 
EhrmantrautM-^Rs a good man to have on our side, and with his 
involvement, as well as Ed LehmannM-^Rs, our future looks 
strong indeed.  So, is the West Coast Pipe and Cigar Expo in 
a growth mode?  You bet!

I also want to mention that the M-^Q94 Expo was dedicated to 
the memory of Barry Levin.  Barry was a good man, and left 
behind many friends.  He was a big supporter of the shows, 
and IM-^Rll always be grateful for the help he gave us last 
year.  IM-^Rm very glad that his son Nikos was with us at the 
show this year, and itM-^Rs only fitting that he was the guest 
of honor at our awards banquet.  Unfortunately his mother, 
Kathy was unable to join us owing to a family matter that 
came up at the last minute.  We thank both Nikos and Kathy 
for their continuing support, and they will always have a 
place of honor at our shows.

Preparations for M-^Q95 are even now getting under way.  
ThereM-^Rs a lot of work ahead, but weM-^Rre already looking 
forward to another excellent show.  In closing I want to 
thank those members of our club who helped me put the show 
together.  Without their assistance I couldnM-^Rt do it, and 
IM-^Rm proud to be associated with a fine group of people.  I 
also want to thank the management and staff of the LAX 
Marriott hotel for doing a superb job on every aspect of 
their service to us.  We couldnM-^Rt ask for a better venue - 
truly a first-class place in every way.   

And to those of you who didnM-^Rt come to the 1994 West Coast 
Pipe and cigar Expo, all I can say is...

YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE!

Happy New Year!!!!!

I hope everyone had a nice holiday.  I am currently enjoying mine:  An
Ascorti Christmas Pipe (45 of 200) that smokes very well.  The pipe is a
beautiful bent apple that not only tastes well.... It is easy to clean.  This
holds true for my copy, that I was able to select from 5 pipes.  It is always
wise to pick up your pipe orders early, especially if you know that there are
other purchasers of the same pipe and shape.

If anyone can still find one , I suggest the purchase, its $ 135.00 well
spent.  Don't smoke it...and  it may sell for 2.5X the amount you paid.
 Obviously, you have to wait 5 or more years for this kind of increase.

Steve:  Have really enjoyed PD 170 -172......the Holiday Issues.  My
appologies for not writing over the holidays, but family came first.  I hope
everyone understands.

Here is a contribution to the resource guide:  (you may have this already,
did not check)

J.T. and D.Cooke
RFD1  Box 1022
East Fairfield, Vermont 05448-9801

Telephone: (802) 849 6272

These folks have their own line of handmade pipes and do the average pipe
repairs.

THEIR SPECIALTY:  Custom stems and replacement stems with all the factory
printing and logos reproduced.  OR,.....custom stems for your organization or
just yours personlized.

PIPE RESTORATION:  They ream, clean, recure, and polish....and resweeten.
They do all the restoration work for Levin Pipes International.

I have a Z-Rox copy of their catalog-price list.  It is very educational and
I would suggest that interested persons obtain one by writing to the above
address.  I know I will!

America ON Line has a pipe group or something starting.... all the entries
are dated December and January.  You can access by typing  PIPES , and then
you will become confused by landing in the middle of wines, cheeses, and
restaurants...... but if you crash their message boards..... you will find
many short pipe related strings.  They are just strating and need help.

Keep on Smoking....and remember:  A reproduction amber stem is
better.....than no stem at all.

<a name="33">Subject: A Good Cigar Draw?</a>

I have a question to the Cigar Smoking Readers.

What is the secret to getting a cigar to get a good draw though the smoke of
a Cigar?

First let me tell you what my experience is.  I, over the past year, have
made it a hobby of mine to find the best smoking cigars. I try all sorts of
brands, including Havanas. Upon purchase, the cigars go from store humidor to
my humidor.  I keep it at 65- 70 % Humidity.  I have bought cigars all over
the world. I travel on business &amp; vacation.  I use a wedge cut on the end of
the cigar.

But I must be doing something wrong.  Most of the Havanas (Cohibas, Romeo &amp;
Julieta's, and Montecristo's) and Royal Jamaican's smoke very well.  Good
flavor and good draw all thru to the end.  Most of the other cigars are
inconsistent.  Davidoff's, Macanudo's, Avo's, Ashton's, Artruo Fuente's and
others are sometimes difficult to draw.  What I mean by this is that you have
to puff several times to get a full mouth of smoke.  They seem too tightly
wrapped.  To remedy this I have tried putting a large nail down the center.
This helps for a while but then it seems to close up again.

One theory I have is that I might be keeping my humidor to humid.  It is
interesting to note that while I was in Ireland this Summer I visited several
tobaccanist and none had their cigars in humidors??

I asked why this was and they said that humid cigars do not smoke well??  In
fact one person showed me a tip for how to tell if a cigar will be a good
smoke.  She then held it up to her ear and rolled it between her fingers.
 She said if you hear just a little crakling then the cigar is right (of
course she warned me not to break the skin and if that happened the cigar was
too dry).  If no crackling is heard or if it feels spoungy then it is too
humid.

Getting back to Humidors.  It was my mission on my vaction in Europe  this
summer to get the best Humidor that I could get for a reasonable price.  I
found one in Spain that I really liked for about $200. I have seen similar in
the USA for $300-400.  In this price range they come with a really cheesy
Hydometer ( if that's what it is called) I noticed that tapping on this gage
could change the reading by 10%.  "Cigar Affecionado" recommends 60-70%
Humidity.  With a 10% error range  I thought that I might really be off.

To get more help I went to my local Tobaccanist to see how he measured
Humidity in his walk-in Humidor.  Well he had two larger but still
relatively cheesy looking gages.  One was reading 50% and the other
70%.  They were about 2' away from each other.  The Tobaccanist
explained that there was a variation in his humidor that usually
calmed down when the door was closed for a while.  I have checked
since and these gages are never within 15%.

I'm a big fan of gadgets so I bought a Radio Shake miniature digital
temperature &amp; Humidity gage that tucks up neatly into the top of my
humidor.  Now it reads to a tenth of a percent but in the fine print
offers A 3% accuracy.

Maybe I am going overboard on this humidity, but a good smoke is worth a
little work.

Maybe I should be like the Irish and just leave the cigar out until it
crackles.

Please answer me in the digest or email to:

??????@???.???

[ I think it simply has to do with the construction of the cigar, as
long as you're making a relatively large cut in it. Other opinions? -S. ]

<a name="2">Subject: Wanted: info on So Cal/AZ/NV cigar/pipe stores</a>

BillyBob:

Just read your posting to the Pipe Digest.

I've been putting a list together of local Cigar/Pipe stores.  Since I
live in Sylmar, the SFV is a special interest as well.  Is jacobs.com
Jacobs Engineering in Pasadena?  A co-worker tells me there's a new
store right on Lake, down past the Burger Continental; if you go
please tell me what you can.

I personally can't recommend enough going to Edwards' in Reseda.
Roy`s just great, and will help you as much (or as little) as you

 Subject: Wanted: info on So Cal/AZ/NV cigar/pipe stores
 
 I've decided that Southern Cal and the surrounding area is way under-
 represented in Mike Duvall's otherwise excellent humidor faq;
 So, while Mike is on vacation, here's a chance to fill things in.
 
 I've compiled a list of stores in the area, but don't have all
 the info for a lot of them, and can't afford to call or visit
 them all (but that'd be fun, wouldn't it?).  So, if you have
 first (or even second) hand knowlege of these places, please
 email me and I'll make sure you get credit.  I may also post
 these separately on a Web page I'm working on.
 
 Need:  Addresses, Proprietor's names, Mail Order y/n, any
 extra details that might be interesting, special brands,
 Inventory and Sales staff details.  If you have any additions,
 corrections, that'd be great!  I'll forward everything to Mike.  Format
 according to Mike's style if you can, or I will.
 
 I'm including what I have done, both for comments/changes and
 so that you know what's going on even if you haven't read the faq 
 (but why??).
 
 Here's what I have so far:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 Tinder Box-Santa Monica         
 2729 Wilshire Blvd.                    
 Santa Monica, CA 90403                 Proprietor: Ed Kolpin, Sr.
 (213) 828-2313                         Mailorder: Unknown
  
 This is the original Tinder Box, (since 1928) the one that spawned the
 national chain.  No longer affiliated, I hear that the owner is very
 unhappy about the way the chain turned out.  No details on that.  This store
 is crammed full of smokers goods and accessories, plus other nicknacks
 (like Bill Clinton Golf Balls - a good lie every time (not my
 opinion!)).
 
 Inventory: decent selection - small humidor, usually open with a
 "blasting" humidifier (you'll get a little wet if you stand under it,
 which you have to do to check out the Romeo et Juliettes, Avos, etc.)
 Prices are normal for CA, i.e., highish.  Some cigars by the door
 ("house" brands, unbanded bundles - out of the humidifier but with a few
 large-element elements on the shelf.)  I tried a few of those and the
 cigars were fine - probably helped that they were all in wrappers.
 
 Salespeople: seemed very knowlegable, helpful, candid.
 
 Edwards Pipe and Tobacco - Reseda 	Info from: Jeff Skaletsky
 19301-B Saticoy St. (The Village)	Proprietors: Roy and Betty Canada
 Reseda, CA  91355			Mail Order: yes
 (818) 349-2300
 
 At intersection of Tampa and Saticoy - formerly in shopping center
 just south of the quake-devastated Northridge Mall, was also
 badly damaged.  Took Roy six months to find a suitable new location.
 Roy's a straight-shooter, a cigar fan no question - been in the
 biz for years.  Will take whatever time you need to help you
 select your cigars or pipes.  Usually a few people sitting on
 stools, smoking and yakking.  Great hours - 'till 7pm weekdays, 6pm
 Saturday, 5pm Sundays.
 
 Inventory: large new humidor, finally well-stocked with Avo, PG, Nat
 Sherman, Romeo et Juliette (local rep said he had more stock than the
 distributor!), Fuente, Ashton, Aliados, Hoyo de Monterrey, Excalibur,
 Joyo de Nicaragua, Punch, Macanudo, H. Upmann, Partegas, Plieades, Te
 Amo, Cruz Real, Don Lino, Santa Rosa, El Sublimado, etc.  Large quantity
 of bundles of "seconds" of very good quality and very good prices.  Also
 puts together "grab bags" of cigars he has extra stock on, with bands
 removed - five or six various sizes for $7.95. No, he won't tell you
 what they are, and won't repeat them.  Prices are as good as you can
 find around LA.
 
 Salespeople: Roy and Betty.  Know their cigars.  Friendly,
 helpful.
 
 Cigar Warehouse - Sherman Oaks		Info from: Jeff Skaletsky 
 Ventura Blvd.				
 Sherman Oaks, CA			
 
 Near intersection of 405 fwy and Ventura Blvd.  Definitely
 a scene on Saturdays.  Lots of inventory, occasional specials.
 
 Inventory: *very* large humidor, well-stocked.  A Dunhill
 dealer plus most of the regular good stuff.  Decent prices.
 
 Salespeople: vary. The owner is very enthusiastic, helpful.
 Another guy seems to sometimes have an attitude, might be just
 me. Asks if he can help, but you get the feeling he wants you
 to say "no."

 smokes.
 
 Salespeople: helpful, friendly, seem knowlegable.

 400 East Glenoaks Blvd.				Proprietor:
 Glendale, CA 						Mail Order: yes

Hello all:
I would like say this is a very informative way of communicating ideas about
the fine art of  pipes and cigars.

Also, let me introduce myself.  My first name is Ian and I am a fifth year 
senior at Western Michigan University.   I've been smoking a pipe for about
a year.

I recently acquired four pipes at antique show, and they aren't  in  the  
best of shape.  I would appreciate any advice on how to recondition them,
especially advice on how to fix loose mouth pieces.  I seem to  remember  
hearing somewhere  that  I need to first boil them in alcohol?....

All of these pipes are made of briar.  
The types are as follows:
   1.Jobey  Shellmoor  imported briar number  130
   2. Barnacle  made in France import briar,  D in mouth piece
   3.  Scotsman's Delight  made in England,  Scot in mouth piece
   4.  Tinder Box  Santini

Any information whatsoever on these  makes of pipes would be appreciated.
Thank you,
 -Ian

[ I've heard of Jobey, but not the others. Maybe I ought to update the
How-To to include treatment of used pipes, too... -S. ]

<a name="3">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #173 -- January 15, 1995</a>

Been in lurker mode for a while, thought it was time to jump in with a few
questions.

I just got a new large bent, wonderful black sandblast that add the
perfect finishing touch to my biker jacket :).  Anyway, I seem to be
having trouble keeping it burning well, it doesn't go out, but the volume
of smoke is fairly weak.  The bowl is larger than any of my other pipes,
but so long as I'm packing it with the same pressure I can't see how that
would make a difference.  Not that I'm size contious or anything
:), but I'd really hate to relegate this pipe to a once in a
while-er.  Suggestions?

Secondus.  Can I get the address of a few good pipe catolgoues from the
net at large.  The pipe shops in Seattle proper are kind of underwelming
and I would like to get an expanded perspective :).

	Lastly, (and not directly tobacco related), in the last issue
Mark Thompson asked what he needed to get WWW access, and I thought it
might help a bit if I expanded a little on Steve's answer, (No
offense, I hope, oh benevolent moderator :).  The access Mark
described is standard for INTERNET and I believe will allow you to
access the Web using Lynx, which is a text only browser, (i.e. no
pictures, and Aunt Bertha rendered in ASCII is somewhat
lackluster). To actually use the Web fully, you need two things, a
good, fast link, (usually Slip or TTP?, or some other arcane
acronym. Your access provider will know what you need if you say you
want to be able to access the Web, but it will probably cost you a
little more a month, exact figures vary but about $15 is what I'm
hearing most often).

	Then you need a browser, a piece of software that knows how to
read the graphic language used by the Web, (HTML), and render it into
picture on your machine, (Aunt Bertha in all of her 256 color,
horrific glory).  Sound and movies are possible as well with some
helper applications, but worry about that later.

	Mosaic is the best known, but the latest version requires you
to install WIN32 additions to your Windows 3.1. (A quick route to the
wonderful world of psychosis).  My suggestion would be to locate
Netscape.  Its an alternate browser that is rapidly becoming as
prevalent as Mosaic, works as well or better, and does not require
modifing windows.  You should be able to find it at any major FTP
site, the 1.0 version is shareware for most people.  (I don't work for
these people, I just like their stuff and support anything that helps
me avoid mental illness.)

	There is a Mosaic for the Mac, but the connecting is very
different and someone else will have to fill in the details.

Eugh, that was long and technical, sorry :)

<a name="4">Subject: RE:  PD #173 -- Clay Pipe Question</a>

[ Question on clay pipe taste/strength deleted to save space. -S. ]

        Clay pipes offer a unique, most of the time smooth, smoke IMHO.  The 
clay tends to absorb the tobacco residue on a lot of blends with casings 
(BTW, most of the time that gurgling in your pipe is NOT saliva, it is the 
residue from tobacco which is flavored with 'casings'....sometimes it is 
saliva, but not usually).  Clay pipes also absorb some of the oils and such 
from the tobacco itself.  

        I smoke reproduction clay pipes from the 19th Century as part of my 
hobby as a Civil War reenactor.  Clays are definitely favorites among 
reenactors as they are cheap, easy to take care of, and can easily be 
replaced.  I usually smoke clays with a reed stem.  This helps to absorb 
more oils and moisture including that little bit on the stem end which does 
come from  your mouth.
        
        As far as cleaning, I am not sure how  you would clean a GOOD clay.  
I personally don't clean my reproduction clays as they are small and 
inexpensive.  My recommendation is to clean out the stem with a dry pipe 
cleaner.  If you try any kind of sweetner or cleaner, the clay will end up 
absorbing some of it.  A good way to clean your bowl is to probably wipe it 
out lightly with a cloth or paper towel.  Special care as in other pipes 
must be taken as not to scratch the bowl...etc.

        Clay pipes develope a 'glazed' character over a long period.  I have 
seen a few clays that some of my 'pards' smoke.  They have a golden brown 
glaze look to them similar to a polished, brown honey look.  This is most 
likely from casings in tobacco.

&gt;[ Interesting! Rick Hacker's book mentioned that he once cleaned a
&gt;clay by throwing it in the fireplace, though I wouldn't recommend such
&gt;treatment myself. BTW, check out Lepeltier's for a different kind of
&gt;clay. -S. ]

        I think Rick was referring to (and making a tongue in cheek 
reference) to inexpensive care and replacement of the clay.  I don't think I 
would put a $60 clay in a fireplace.  But, in all actuality, it is not a bad 
idea to *set* one on a fire, or on or near a bed of coals.  The pipe will 
expand with the heat (it was fired before and should not be hurt by 
another).  Any excessive caking will flake off.  HOWEVER, if you have a lot 
of build up in that pipe, there could be a lot of mositure there too!  Ever 
throw a rock in a fire that had moisture trapped inside?  BOOM!  If you have 
an FINISHED clay (any glazing that would seal the surfaces of the pipe), I 
would not do this.  BUT, if you have clays like I have, I don't think it 
would hurt them.  Mine are cheap, but they do not have finished surfaces.  

        I treat my pipes like babies.  So, I usually take a lot of 
precautions and care.  Some of what I say may sound too 'guarded.' ;-)

Steve: I was just in Menlo Park and had the PLEASURE of trying the
tobacco store attached to the BBC (British Banker's Club)
restaurant. The atmosphere of the store is fabulous (a bit pricey
though), the selection is OK (not great). Any faults are well
compensated for by the fact that the store is attached to the BBC

Hello to all smokers!

Allow me to introduce myself.  I became a cigar smoker one New Year's eve
about five years ago, and a pipe smoker a few years after that.  My first
pipe was a birthday gift from my best friend, who was actually returning a
favor I had bestowed upon him for his previous birthday.

Last year my grandfather, an avid pipe and cigar smoker until his heart
attack 20 years ago, passed away.  I was lucky enough to emerge with his
collection of pipes (the cigars, being 20 years old, weren't that great) and
parephenalia.  Much of this belonged to his father, my great-grandfather,
including a Meerschaum complete with case that reads "Adler Fulop Es Fia,
Budapest."  I surmise this means my great-grandfather bought this pipe in
Budapest, sometime before he emigrated to the United States in 1900.  The
pipe appears to be in two pieces, but I can't seem to fit them together.  I
guess I'll have to take it to a shop.

I am not the afficianado of brand names and such, but someday I hope to be. 
I simply enjoy a good cigar for a festive occasion or a good pipe for a
reflective one.

Here's an anecdote I would like to share:  I am a member of Delta Kappa
Epsilon international fraternity.  Years ago, the president of the Republic
of Cuba, Mario Garcia Menocal, was an alumnus of this fraternity (he went to
Cornell).  He decided that he wanted to host the annual international
convention in his home country.  Having the coffers of Cuba at his disposal,
he spared no expense.  There are tales of trains starting in Maine, at each
stop picking up more Dekes on the way to Miami, where they boated to Havana. 
Each brother attending the convention was given a box of cigars.

This event is verified in an ancient issue of the University of Chicago
yearbook.

I look forward to moderated (i.e. flameless) discussion!  

Matthew Leingang

PS.  Steve, can you please send the "How to" guide (just to make sure I'm
doing it right :-) and the "101 Ways..."?  Thanks 1000000.

Hello, everyone.  Since I'm new to this newsletter, I thought I'd introduce
myself.  I've been smoking cigars and occasionally pipes for over twenty years.
 I suspect that I'm like many who would love to smoke nothing but expensive
cigars and tobaccos; however, I have found contentment with less expensive
smokes.  My "regular" cigar is the A&amp;C Grenadier (candela), but I keep a few
boxes of some moderately priced cigars made by Thompson for a switch off.  For
"treats," I'll smoke an Ashton, Larranga La Romana or Dunhill.  My pipe
tobaccos are, again, inexpensive but I enjoy them.  Half &amp; Half for a
"straight" smoke and Borkum Riff if I want an aromatic.  "Treats" are Plumcake
and Escudo.  For quick smokes, I keep a pack of "Between the Acts" with me.  
        Well, that's about it.

Thanks for sending me Pipes Digest. Here is a little information about myself.

I am 27 years old, and live in Auburn, GA. I am a computer programmer
(yes COBOL, no wise cracks from C++ programmers). I have been smoking
pipes for about 5 years. Over the years I have collected about 25
pipes, including Stanwells, Savinellis, Petersons and Brebbias.  I
currently smoke something called Optima. I have tried and English
blend, but it tasted about like what I imagine smoking hay would be
like. I am interested in trying new tobaccos. I have read many of the
favorites of the mailgroup, but I am leary of trying another English
blend. Could you suggest, I suppose, a mild English blend to get me
started.

Hi, Steve:
You echoed, with interest, a contributor's question: how does one go
about aquiring an educated palate?

Without wishing to pose as the owner of such a thing, I'd venture to
suggest the following procedure:

The first step is undirected but broad exploration.  The goal is to
try as much as possible and to learn what seems "good" and what
doesn't, and then to refine one's ability to make distinctions among
degrees of "good"ness.  Afterward, it's pleasing and rewarding to
investigate what's in the things that are "good" and to discover
what's common: what ingredients there are whose presence has a
predictive value of "good"ness or otherwise.  Doing it in that order
is preferable to reading up first: people are awfully suggestible,
and the experimenter wants to know what her/his own palate can do,
not (not at first, anyway) what others' palates have experienced!

What little I know of wine, pipe tobacco, ... I learned this way.  It
isn't swift, and I'm still abysmally ignorant, but at least I've a
long road of pleasurable learning before me.

Hello fellow smokers,

In reply to C.D.Walborn's question (#173): "So, where do i begin?".

Learning to appreciate English blends, or learn what it is i am
actually tasting, as you phrase it, is a lengthy study.
The only way, as i see it, is to experiment. Try them all i would
say. But some advise on the road is not bad. Rely on your tobacco 
dealer if you feel confident about him, or ask an 'experienced'
friend - there's quite a few around here!

I tell you, some time from now, when you'r fed up with your Captain
Black or whatever, you will suddenly desire the distinct aroma of
Dunhill's Standard. That's the way it works. For me anyway.

If you haven't tried it, you will never know what you missed! Right ?

A little advise about the numerous tins, half full, that tend to pile
up on your shelve, that you could not stand when you smoked them for
the first time - keep them!  Preferable in air tight containers (a
carefully sealed plastic bag will do). A new try will then be
cost-free whenever you feel like it.

One friendly advise - try the milder versions of a specific tobacco
type you would like to try at first.  Dunhill's Standard Mild is a
good example of a light English Mixture.  Another choice in this
category could be MacBaren's Latakia Blend (if it's available in the
US), which is basicly a rather sweet blend with just a touch of
latakia.

Keep it lit!

hey, steve. great idea.  i've been looking for a group where chatting 
about smoking (cigars, in my case) does not immediately draw fire from 
the rabid anti-smoking folks.  

i've just moved to north carolina from southern california.  would be 
glad to exchange notes with people about smoker nights and so on; those 
abounded in calif., but i've not had luck finding them here in tobacco 
road, which seems strange. the nice thing about living here -- actually, 
it's better than nice, it's GREAT -- is that there's a J&amp;R factory outlet 
not far, which makes for a cheaper hobby, especially since my tastes tend 
to run toward the more expensive smokes. (what can i say -- i got hooked 
on good cigars.)

anyway, enough blathering on.  i hope to hear from you soon.  happy trails.

Hello. My name is James Akin. I am a native of Fayetteville, Arkansas, but I
currently live in San Diego, California. 

I am 29 and have been a pipe smoker since I was 13, with a three-year hiatus
at one point. My academic training is in philosophy, and I currently work as
an apologist at a ministry known as "Catholic Answers" here in San Diego (I
would explain that an apologist is a person who defends a position, and hence
a Catholic apologist is a person who defends the Catholic faith, but pipe
smokers are far too erudite for me to explain this without insulting them). 

I would be very interested in meeting other Pipes Digest subscribers here in
Souther California. My phone number is (619) 283-9757.  

To give a little more background on me, here is the introduction to an
article I am writing on the anti-smoking crusade and the inversion of
American moral priorities (when the article is completed, I will upload it to
Pipes Digest, though I plan to publish it elsewhere):

"It was almost guaranteed that I would be a pipe smoker. The chief reason is
that my father was a pipe-smoking university professor, and like any son I
wished to emulate my father. But there were other reasons. 

"I was intensely interested in science as a child, and the image of a
pipe-smoking scientist in a lab coat was stamped upon my brain at an early
age. I myself grew up to be a philosophy teacher at the local university, so
the archetype of the pipe-smoking philosopher also played a role. From the
other end of the social spectrum, I happened to grow up in the Ozark
mountains of Arkansas--hillbilly country. In later years I even discovered
that some of my ancestors were been born in Ireland (the rest being from two
other pipe-smoking countries, Scotland and England). 

"Thus as a scientific-philosopher-academic-hillbilly- Irishman, it was
virtually predestined that I would take up a pipe. And I did. 

"I enjoy smoking a pipe. It is very relaxing. I smoke a mild, sweet-smelling
tobacco, and I enjoy its taste and aroma. I am also sensitive to the romance
of pipe-smoking. The image is very appealing to me of being a good,
pipe-smoking Catholic daddy, with a passle of children at my feet, reading
Bible stories by the fireside during 
Advent."

Unfortunately, I do not currently have such a passle of children, as I was
widowed at the age of 27 (two days after my 27th birthday), and am currently
seeking a devout Catholic wife who wants lots of babies. (Coincidentally, I
became Catholic just four days before being widowed; previously, I had been a
Evangelical and had hoped to teach in an Evangelical seminary.)

The tobacconist I use here in San Diego is Liberty Tobacco (7341 Clairmont
Mesa Blvd. in Independence Square Plaza, [619] 292-1772). 

The store is run by a man name Charlie Hennigan, who has provided chairs for
guys to sit around and talk. He also has a TV set up and a small 'fridge for
beer (&amp; other beverages). Often during the afternoons, Charlie has a "movie
of the day" which he plays on VCR for men who don't have to work during the
afternoon. Several times a year (at least once a quarter, it seems), he has
cook-outs and parties at the store, as well as yearly cigar and pipe smoking
contests, and frequent "golf outings" for the customers.

The atmosphere at Litberty Tobacco is quite pub-like (except for the
prominence of smoke over drink), and I enjoy it a great deal.

Hope to write to you soon, and glad to be a subscriber. 

[ Thanks! And what a great name for the shop! -S. ]

<a name="14">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #173 -- Janu...</a>

In PD#173, ??????@???.??? commented on cigar draw. This issue has become a
pet peeve of mine with Davidoff in particular. I have been complaining for
nearly 3 yrs to no avail. I have even developed my personal test that I
perform in their humidor in NYC--the tightness I'm sure you have noted is
right in the band area--if that spot is hard as a rock, it is a reject. I
should point out that the system is not foolproof and, in fact, sometimes the
harder ones are better in draw.

My concern was similar to Hytest, in that I originally believed the
wetness/dryness had much to do with problem. No my friends, the problem lies
in the rolling process. For this reason I do not purchase in 25/box--I buy
the 5-pack, open every box, squeeze every cigar and dare the sales help to
stop me. As it turns out, I met the store manager who shared my concern and
he lets me spend as much time as I need to make my selection.    

So why do I torture myself in this process and why do I gamble with $7.75 for
a Grand Cru #2, when the possibilty exists too often that I will get a lousy
smoke--nothing worse than a hard ( hot ) draw?  Answer: When a Davidoff is
rolled properly, it is pure joy!!

<a name="16">Subject: The Pipe Palate</a>

How to Develop a Pipe Palate:

Developing a Pipe Palate  is not an easy task. First you have to determine
why you want to develop this sense, will it be for determining the contents
of a pipe tobacco or for description purposes?

Here's what I mean: 

Content: Ahh.. this blend is made up of a Red Virginia leaf, Bright
Burley, Perique, and cased with Rum.  or Descriptive: This blend has a
sweetness derived from the Virginian tobaccos with peppery overtones
of Perique, laced with hint of molasses from the Rum.

This of course is a little bit of an exaggeration but you get the idea. 

The first thing you have to be able to do (and it ain't easy) is to identify
tobacco and it's origin by looking at it. One of the best sources for
pictures regarding this is an out of print book by Carl Ehwa "The History of
Pipes &amp; Tobacco." This book illustrates color and texture of straight tobaccos
 like Burley, Virginian etc. The next step is to find small quantities of the
basic straight (unmixed)  tobaccos. Try these tobaccos to develop a sense for
their characteristics ie. (Virginia-sweet, bright in color, smokes hot &amp;
wet.) Only after you have tried tobaccos in their unadulterated state, can
you pick them out of a crowd. Two things to keep in mind when trying tobacs;
How was the tobac cured, as this will affect flavor. Two, the "cut" of the
tobacco because this will greatly affect the temperature of the smoke.

The more difficult thing to decern in pipe tobacco is the casing agent, (if
it has one.) Casing agents range from just plain sugared water to natural
fruit or herb extracts, liquor, and liquers. To determine this it helps if
you have literature from the tobacco itself. They usually say "Rum,"
"Bourbon," etc. 

One product you might look for (I don't know if it's still made) is a can of
tobacco made by MacBaren's of Denmark. I don't remember the name of it, but
it was about a 250gram can divided into four sections and each section
contained a single tobacco like Burley, Virginian, Cavendish and some kind of
Oriental - I can't remember. It came with a small scoop so that you could
create your own blend. It was a nifty idea, but I haven't seen it for a long
time. When you're trying tobaccos try them with a clean palate, I used to
chew parsley then rinse my mouth with water before trying tobaccos. If you
try tobaccos while drinking port, bourbon, malts, etc., it will affect your
perception of the tobac. Lastly the scent of the tobac burning is critical in
determining characteristics. You have to find a way to burn the tobacco
outside of you pipe in order to "really" smell it. Use a small piece of metal
screen with your tobacco on top of it, light it, let it burn and then wave
the smoke to your nose. Now you'll now more about the tobacco and more
importantly, how other people around you interpret your tobacco.

Hope This helps,
Steve Banks

Dear Steve, I have been reading the issues of the Digest that you send,
faithfully, for however long I have been subscribing and really enjoy the
forum.  I too have refrained from sending in a bio, as it *is* listed as a
Pipes digest, but, since there are many other subscribers I can identify
with, here goes.: My name is J. Mark Craib; I am 26 years of age; I work
*many* jobs, but for the most part, I am in a Human Services career.  I work
with multiply handicapped kids in a school setting, although I am sometimes
more of a bouncer than a Paraeducator.  Beyond this, I also tend bar, work as
a Counselor at a runaway shelter, and plow snow in the winter.  As I live in
Rochester NY, this can sometimes be a full time job as well.  (I'm almost
done...)  Now in my "spare" time, I volunteer as a Paramedic, Firefighter,
and keep busy with my local Masonic Lodge.  Now after all this, you may ask
where I get the time to enjoy myself, or worse yet that "R" word, relax ??
The answer is, whenever I can.  There are quiet times on the ambulance, when
one of my partners and I can enjoy a good smoke, or with my pipe, one of the
convieniences is it holds up in my pocket better than a 1/2 smoked A.F.
Hemmingway.  The Fire Dept. allows smoking in the truck bays only, but I can
make do, put my feet up, and enjoy a smoke without too much
interruption-usually.  There are only 1 or 2 cigar friendly establishments
around me.  The bar I work in does NOT like me to smoke cigars, but it's OK
if the "patrons" do, because " there's nothing we can do about it ".  ( This
was said to me by one of the managers, who smokes ciggaretts - even while he
is tending bar !! )  I really hate double standards !!  I am also working mr
way through college (slowly, but still going...)  I have found that I really
enjoy both my cigars, and my pipe.  There are times when I prefer one over
the other, for whatever reason... but my knowledge base is very limited when
it comes to pipeing.  Personally, I have always preferred pipe and cigar
"smell" over cigaretts (however you spell that damn word).  I would love to
hear more about both pipes and cigars, as there is no *real* club or league
around me.  There is a smoker usually once every 2-3 months, and has ha
dattendance from k65 to 175 people.  These are predominantly cigar smokers,
but as of late, there have been both Pipes, and women in attendance.  The
women that are there, are avidly smoking cigars.  
Well I have said more than enough, but one of my most pleasurable moments, is
when I have Jimmy Buffett on the radio, and a Cohiba Siglo V in my hand and
the stars above me.  
" If we couldn't laugh, we'd all go insane "
--------Buffett, James (Poet Extrordinaire) 

Thanks for the Digest, it's a nice touch of sanity in an otherwise unsane
world.  

Happy Smoking, and as for second hand smoke, I guess if I can't get it first
hand..........

This is my first post to this mail group, and I have to say after reading my
first mailing I really love it so far.  I am a cigar smoker myself although
I did smoke a pipe while I was in college.  I really don't know how most
people started smoking cigars, for me it was just something to do during
parties.  A friend of mine would bring some cigars with him to the party and
we would stand out on the roof and puff away.  I really can't say that I
loved them, they were cheap Philly Blunts or something like that, but it did
keep the girlfriends away and give the guys time for some good quality male
bonding.  It really wasn't until I went on my honymoon to Bermuda that I had
my first quality premium cigar, a Cuban H. Upmann,  I was in heaven.  That
was the point that my fasination with cigars started.

Well I look forward to being a active participant in the group and I promise
I will give reviews of all cigars that I try.  Like tonight I will trying a
Davidoff Special R.  I'll let you know what I think

<a name="22">Subject: pipes from Gouda</a>

I would like to send you a little article about a part of Dutch folklore,
the clay pipe from Gouda.

Gouda is a small city , known for its pottery and even more so for its
clay pipes. People don't smoke them ofter nowadays, but they are
lovely to collect.

It all started in the early 17th century. In England bitter political
fights went on and a lot of Britans fled to the continent. Among them
a great deal of gifted pipemakers, who found a new home in the city of
Gouda.  They started the triumph of the "Gouwenaars" as the clay pipe
was called.  For three centuries it was the most used smoking
attribute.

A man called William Baernelts alledgedly was the first to arrive in
Gouda.  According to the legend this man was in fact the famous writer
William Shakespeare, who fled from people he owned money and a scorned
wife.  On his tombstone in Gouda is written that anyone who would open
the grave would be cursed.

Anyway, by making the white claypipes Gouda prospored. Halfway the Golden
Age some 10.000 inhabitant of Gouda earned a living in the pipemaking
industry. Millions of pipes were made every year.

One of the oldest traditions on clay pipes is the so-called "getting a
Gouda clay pipe".  During winter when the rivers and lakes were
frozen, many men went ice skating to Gouda. When the arrived they
bought a clay pipe which was sewn on their back. The first one to
arrive back in the village was welcomed like a hero. The real
proffesionals took a so-called office-pipe, which was over 50
centimeter long .  To bring it back undamaged was an act of true
heroism.  Until this day people ice skate to get their clay pipe. The
only difference is that they go back by car or train and that women
and children also join.

Today there are only two pipemakers left which jointly produce some
13.000 pipes a year. If anyone of you will visit the Netherlands,
don't miss Gouda. Don't forget to buy a pipe and some plain
tobacco. If you smoke it with caution it will last a long time and
gives a cool and dry smoking pleasure.

See you in Gouda!

<a name="23">Subject:      Pipes in the movies</a>

Pipes Digest people:

I don't know if anyone has talked much about pipes in movies (if so, I'd
appreciate being directed to the appropriate source). I've done some thinking
about it myself-- as with most pipe themes, I'm fascinated. Can anyone
suggest films I should see with some sort of pipe angle? I've got a few
in mind already, both old and new:

"Meet Me in St. Louis"-- the mythical "boy next door," frequently gazed
upon  by a voyeuristic Judy Garland, is at one point fiddling with what I
take to be his first pipe on the lawn: a moment of self-creation, private
but in this context a form of performance.  Also, Garland's grandfather's
pipe tends to suggest stability-- when things are up in the air, the pipe
is less evident.

"Through a Glass Darkly" (Bergman)-- In this film, both adult males smoke a
pipe... interestingly, their pipe duties (getting tobacco, filling, cleaning,
lighting) all appear very awkward and are even touched with the growing
neurotic flavor of the film as a whole.

"Wild Strawberrries" (also Bergman)-- in contrast, here we have a teenage
girl whose pipe is a sort of refusal to adhere to traditional structures...
she and her friends are the "free spirit" personified.

"Of Human Bondage" (with Leslie Howard)-- watch for the way the pipe is an
almost fetishistic 'male' object. When women want to act on the hero Philip,
one way to do it is to manipulate his pipe-- that is, fill it for him. He
accepts one, refuses the other.

"Never Cry Wolf"-- Pipe as comforter, as friend in a lonely place... compare
that to the pipe in Lindsay Anderson's "If. . ." (a source, along with "Zero
for Conduct", for Weir's "Dead Poet's Society").  In "If..." the pipe smoking
Latin teacher is the enemy establishment. While in "Dead Poet's Society" it
works both ways-- instrument of the oppressor AND avenue of identity
exploration, though in "DPS" there is a strong conformist element that isn't
at all visible in "If...".

One last interesting example: Jack Nicholson in the recent "Wolf" is a pipe
smoker earlier in the film, in the scenes where he is represented as being
basically good but old/slow/sedentary.

There's a lot more out there.
Thanks,
Andy Miller

Dear Steve,

     {Thanks for putting me on the distribution list for the Digest.  I very 
much enjoyed the copy you sent and would like to receive the last three or 
four issues as well.  Also, if possible, would you retransmit the current 
issue as well?  I printed it as a hard copy and then erased the file. 
 Unfortunately, after it was printed, someone took it off the printer and 
dropped it, scattering pages everywhere.  It was fun reading it last night 
but it would be more enlightening to read the pages in the intended order! 
 Also, when you send the document, would you affix ".doc" to its title?}

     I am happy to be a new member of the Digest's supporters.  I am 44 
years old and have been smoking pipes for 27 years and cigars for about 15. 
 I prefer straight pipes, especially ODA-sized canadians, lumbermen and 
stacked billiards, although I also own quite a few pipes in other shapes.  I 
have a nice collection of English pipes.  A Charatan Supreme canadian with 
an egg-shaped bowl and stamped M.T.O. (made to order, I think) is the jewel 
of my collection.  I also enjoy my Caminettos, Ascortis, and Ser Jacs.  I 
smoke a heavy blend of Red Virginia, Latakia, Perique, and Yenidje which I 
blend for myself at John B. Hayes Tobacconist (Fairfax, VA) where I work one 
night per week.  On occasion, I'll buy a tin of Sobranie, Bengal Slices, etc 
for a change.  I used to enjoy Dunhill's Standard Mixture Full and Dark 
Flake.  If any of the Digest's subscribers have any of these tobaccos and 
are willing to part with them, I'd love to get a message 
(????????@???????.???.???.???).

     My other hobbies include martial arts, motorcycle riding (1981 Honda 
CB750K), and amateur radio (N4PKL).  I would enjoy hearing from anyone with 
similar interests.

     When not smoking my pipe (alas, my office has gone smoke free), I work 
for the Dept. of Defense in the area of nuclear weapons command and control. 
 Fortunately, business is not booming these days.  My academic training is 
in the area of Russian studies, specifically, Soviet nuclear forces and 
doctrine.

     I hope this brief introduction will serve to put me in touch with the 
many interesting individuals who still find respite and harmony in a 
peaceful pipe in these hurried times.

     John

I just want to take the time to thank Mr. Donovan-Shead for sharing the
plethora of information that he has titled "Smoke Signals". As a fairly new
smoker and, indeed, an ignorant one I have greatly appreciated and benefited
from this information. It is mostly he who has convinced me to turn to the
English-Scottish blends of tobacco.

Mr. Donovan-Shead, you are the exact type of gentleman that turned me towards
pipe smoking in the first place. It is wonderful to know that men like you do
exist.

And to the pipe smoking community in general: You are a wonderful bunch of
people. I cannot duly express my gratitude for the friendly sharing of
information that I have experienced among you.

Over-sentimentally yours,

Steve,

Thanks a lot for the latest issue of Pipes Digest.  From what I have seen 
it is a wonderful publication.  I've enjoyed every min. of reading.  In 
fact I've FTP'd several back issues and enjoyed them as well.

As for your request for a short backgrounder on myself.

I am 43 years old, live on a small horse farm in Southwestern 
Pennsylvania, and am a software engineer by trade.  I've been smoking 
pipes for a while now and find it to be one very enjoyable and relaxing 
passtime. (esp. sitting out in an old blue ridge rocker, just daydreaming 
and watching the forest grow.)

As for my favorite pipes, I have a few, but those that come to mind more 
often than not are an original issue Sherlock Holmes from Petersons, a 
churchwarden from Savanelli, and one of unknown origin that is a kind of 
full bent, large hand carved bowl, and of an overall gnarly appearance 
that smokes quite well.

My favorite tobacco(s) are: for every day use - Sherlock's Choice, 
Dunhill's Medium Standard, and Balkan Sobranie,  for night time relaxing I 
like a churchwarden full of Dunhill's Nightcap or Bengal Slices, a good 
book,perhaps some nice Mozzart, and something nice to sip, and for a change 
now and again I enjoy MacBaren's Latika, Dunhill's Elizabethan Blend, or 
Erinmore Mixture.

Given the preferences that I mentioned above I would very much like to 
hear from any other members about any favorite of theirs they think I 
might like. Always interested in discovering a new favorite.

Once again thanks for the fine work you are doing with the digest.  I 
like the www pages also, and I am looking forward to participating in 
this group.

Best,

<a name="28">Subject: The Smoker's Own Book Of Poetry</a>

Steve,

I have an old book of poetry for smokers! It is called: "Pipe and
Pouch, the Smoker's Own Book of Poetry". Compiled by Joseph Knight,
of the Joseph Knight Company, Boston, 1895. The copyright is dated
1894. The publisher: University Press, John Wilson and Son, Cambridge,
USA.

Perhaps the first story is how I came about this book ... There is, or
used to be, a very large used book company in the small town of
Hay-on-Wye, in England, on the Welsh border. I had once hitch-hiked
and walked my way through that town, but found out about the used book
operation only months after returning from my trip. Apparently the
'store' takes up several buildings in that town, and may be the
largest used book store(s) in the world. Later on my brother passed
through Hay-on-Wye, knowing perfectly well what treasure lies there,
and this book is the souvenir he brought me. (The price was only 1.50
British Pounds, and the year approximately 1982 ...)

The book must have about 100 poems. Rudyard Kipling's "The Betrothed"
is there (I've seen that copied onto one of the smoking newsgroups
already). I hope I may find the time to type some of them for the
Pipe Digest. Here comes the first, notice the writer seems to be a
woman pipe-lover.

	MY LITTLE BROWN PIPE

I have a little comforter,
   I carry in my pocket:
It is not any woman's face
   Set in a golden locket;
It is not any kind of purse;
   It is not book or letter,
But yet at times I really think
   That it is something better.

Oh, my pipe, my little brown pipe!
   How oft, at morning early,
When vexed with thoughts of coming toil,
   And just a little surly,
I sit with thee till things get clear,
   And all my plans grow steady,
And I can face the strife of life
   With all my senses steady.

No matter if my temper stands
   At stormy, fair, or clearing,
My pipe has not for any mood
   A word of angry sneering.
I always find it just the same,
   In care, or joy, or sorrow,
And what it is to-day I know
   It's sure to be tomorrow.

It helps me through the stress of life;
   It balances my losses;
It adds a charm to all my joys,
   And lightens all my crosses.
For through the wreathing, misty veil
   Joy has a softer splendor,
And life grows sweetly possible,
   And love more truly tender.

Oh, I have many richer joys!
   I do not underrate them,
And every man knows what I mean,
   I do not need to state them.
But this I say, - I'd rather miss
   A deal of what's called pleasure,
Than lose my little comforter,
   My little smoky treasure.

I have smoked a pipe for over 20 years. My favorites are Dunhills, some of 
which I bought new and others used. For many years I got my tobacco from 
A.Garfinkel in Washington D.C. and although I live in California Mr. Garfinkel 
would ship me tobacco 3 times year. He has gone out of business and I have 
just smoked my last bowl of an old friend, an English tobacco Called 
"SHOTERY". Has anybody enjoyed this heavenly delight? Perhaps somebody could 
help me locate it.

<a name="31">Subject: Pipe Digest</a>

Steve,
Thanks for the material you sent.  I found it very interesting and look forwrd
to future issues.

My father was a pipe and cigar smoker.  I have smoked both on and off
for years.  But for some reason I went into a hiatus in the early
'80s. I resumed my love affair with the cigar a few months ago.  I
smoke a pipe occasionally.  I have a good briar pipe my father bought
me years ago, but I also like corn cobs.  Lately I've smoked tobacco
604 from W. Curtis Draper in Washington D.C.

But I am more interested in cigars now.  My budget does not allow me
to indulge too often in the premium stuff.  But I've recently has an
Arturo Fuente, Punch, Vueltabajo, Bauza, Don Diego, Canaria D'Oro, La
Primadora, and others.  My mainstays have been Cuesta-Rey, Bering, and
Muniemakers.  I recently bought a bunch of Georgetown Zombies
(robustos and Lonsdales) from Georgetown Tobacco and some J*R
Alternatives to Cohiba robustos.  I've never had a Cohiba, so I can't
vouch for any similarity.  But they're pretty good and 20 cost $20.  I
don't know what I'll try next.  I'm tempted to buy a big H. Uppman.  I
am partial right now to robustos because I usually don't have time to
smoke a longer cigar; my office is in a no-smoking building.  I like
the big girth and have lost my interest in thin cigars.  I like strong
cigars and enjoy smoking early in the morning (really, anytime).

I wish the Cuban embargo would end so someone besides politicians and
those who travel could get some good Havanas.

I made my own humidor using a Rubbermaid box, a sponge soaked in
distilled water and stuffed into a vented Bering Imperial tube, and a
Radio Shack hygrometer.  So far so good.

What I especially like about cigar smoking is the camaraderie among cigar and
pipe smokers.  There's nothing like it.

Thanks for the good work of you and your colleagues.

<a name="32">Subject: Several items.....</a>

  This evening BRIARMAN &amp; I smoked a blend of tobacco reported to be a match
of Escudo (# 966 - Merlin's Choice).  I received it from Cornell &amp; Diehl.  It
is a fine English blend and may become a regular in my rotation, but it is
not Cope's Escudo.  It is not pressed and seems to lack the perique
influences that set Escudo apart.  

   All of Mr. Craig Tarler's blends are priced right (by California
standards) at a reasonable $12.75 / LB.  He sells by the pound, but has a
sampler (5 pouches - 2 Oz. each - your choice) for $15.00.  There are hundreds
 of blends to choose from including a nice (mellower) 965 clone.  His claim
is to match any sample you provide.  I give him points for the effort even if
it's slightly off.  Briarman &amp; I are planning to test many other blends.

   On another matter:  Many readers ask ' I'm visiting _____.  Does anyone
know of a smoke shop?'  

   Add a copy of Cigar Aficionado's BUYING GUIDE TO PREMIUM CIGARS.  Aside
from cigar info, ratings, and articles, this book has an extensive listing of
national cigar / pipe stores.  It doesn't rate the shops, but it covers the
US pretty well (name, address, phone) and has a few foreigh outlets.  

   CA also has a book covering cigar friendly restaurants.  I haven't gotten
to the second volume yet, but both books can be obtained by calling CA at
(800) 992 - 2442.  Each costs $10.  Well worth it I think
.  
PS: These volumes won't fit into regular pockets, but should take up almost
no space in an overnight bag.  The cigar book is particularly good reading on
'smoke free'  fleights.  Especially when displayed prominently!

   All for now.   Smoke in peace.

      Can it be done with newsgroups??

GREETINGS, MY FELLOW KAPNISMOLOGISTS!

It's newsletter time yet again, so here we go...

	The January meeting saw us back at Fratello's.  It was a
small, but cozy gathering this time, and it was good to be back with
you again.  Thanks go to Roy Fazalare for bringing in some premium
tinned tobaccos, which gave some of us the chance to acquire additions
to our 'backy collections.  Incidentally, Roy has operated off and on
as V.S.O.P. Tobacco &amp; Gifts.  This business activity at one time
included his own hand-blended tobaccos.  He's getting back into doing
this, and he should have his blends available again soon.  I
understand that he has made some very decent stuff, and I, for one am
looking forward to sampling the results of his skill.  We'll let you
know as soon as he's ready to start selling.

	Our February meeting will be at new location - and this one I
think you'll really like.  The place is called Scotland Yard, and it's
an authentic English pub (details are on the flyer).  Our
secretary/treasurer Jerry Lustig discovered it a couple of weeks ago,
and we both had lunch there recently.
 And a delightful place it is, too.  They feature a full bar with some great
things on tap (including their own microbrewery ale), a nice menu of
pub-style food - and they're pipe and cigar friendly to boot !  In short, it
should make for quite a convivial meeting place, so I hope we'll have a good
turnout.

	As all of you know, finding places that will allow pipe and
cigar smoking is difficult (and even more so now that we have the AB
13 smoking ban).  This being the case, his discovery of Scotland Yard
has given Jerry an idea I thought would be worth passing on.  The idea
is this: To find similar locations in L.A. and Orange counties.  And
here's where we could use some help from our members who're willing to
do some scouting around.  Here are the requirements.  Firstly, the
place should be owned/run by someone from the U.K. - reason being that
they will be open to pipe and cigar smoking, whereas in most bars it's
a no-no.  Secondly, it should serve food.  Thirdly, there needs to be
adequate space for us (enough for about 20-25 additional bodies),
including some table tops that can be taken up by those who bring
stuff for sale and/or trade.  And last (but not least), we must be
able to hold our meetings on Sunday afternoons.  Anyone finding such a
location should get in touch with either myself or Jerry, and we'll be
more than happy to give the place a try.  Given the fact that our
membership is spread out all over the place it makes sense for us to
have a number of different locations to meet at.  Your assistance in
this would therefore be in everyone's best interests, and it will be
very much appreciated!

	And now on to Expo news.  We now have the dates secured for
our '95 Pipe and Cigar Expo, which means that I can officially
announce that it will be held on the weekend of September 9th and
10th.  Unfortunately the Marriott had nothing available in October and
November, but at least we'll be able to keep our show at the same
hotel.  And I have it on good authority that the weekend after Labor
Day ain't a bad time to have a show, so I expect that we'll do very
well - especially with the help we'll be getting from Jack
Ehrmantraut. I talked with Jack the other day (for one thing, I needed
to thank him for the very positive writeup he did on the '94 Expo in
the PCI newsletter).  He told me about what he'll be doing to help us
promote the Expo throughout the year, and also what kind of effect it
might have on table sales and attendance.  All I can say is that
Jack's help will be a major asset, and we can expect some major
improvements in '95 as a result.

	I have also been in contact with Linwood Hines, who's active
with the Conclave of Richmond Pipe Smokers (CORPS).  I have discussed
this year's Expo with him, and he's in agreement with me about getting
some of the CORPS membership involved with the L.A. show.  Linwood
told me that he'll be bringing this issue up at their meeting on
January 24th.  I also want to mention that our new friend, Chicago
pipe collector Ed Lehmann has indicated that he'll be bringing some
other collectors in the Chicago club with him to the show.  Bottom
line is this - Messrs. Ehrmantraut, Hines and Lehmann are helping us
build a national reputation for the L.A. Expo.  This is very important
because we have the potential for becoming a major national event in
the world of pipes and cigars.  Since it is the aim of our club to
defend and promote pipe and cigar smoking (as well as pipe
collecting), it behooves us realize that potential.  Now that we have
some assistance from other quarters, I feel confident we're now on the
road to doing so.

	In a previous newsletter I mentioned that we need more help
from our membership in terms of organizing and running the '95 Expo.
I want to remind everyone about this.  Also, all of you need to know
that the next two shows ('95 and '96) will be a buildup to '97, when
we'll be hosting the PCI National convention.  This show will probably
be the biggest pipe and cigar event we'll ever have on the west coast.
We must be well-prepared, and this makes it even more important for us
to function as a team in putting on our annual shows.

	The Expo is, among other things, a showcase event for our club
- our chance to show the rest of the country what we're capable of
accomplishing.  And those of us dedicated to maintaining a future for
pipe and cigar smoking understand the absolute importance of having
these events take place - that's why we go to the trouble of doing it
to begin with.  I know that the '95 Expo is still over 7 months away,
but I would like you to give some thought as to what you can do to
help us out.  I'll be putting periodic reminders in this newsletter
over the coming months, and in the meantime I'd like to hear from
those of you who want to be a part of the effort we'll be making with
this year's Expo.  Those of you wanting to get in touch with me can
call me at home - (310)820-9706.

SMOKERS' RIGHTS UPDATE

	Well, yours truly finally joined Californians for Smokers'
Rights.  I'd been putting it off for awhile, but after the statewide
smoking ban went into effect on the 1st I decided it was about time.
After I joined up I received a very nice phone call from CSR Vice
President Otto Mueksch, who lives in North Hollywood.  We talked for a
good time, and in the course of our conversation I found out just how
well-informed he (and the CSR leadership in general) is.  In a word -
these people know their stuff, and I was quite impressed with how much
they know, about the scientific/medical aspects of the secondhand
smoke debate, as well as who our opposition is.  CSR is in every sense
of the word a grass-roots organization.  After getting to know CSR
through Mr. Mueksch I feel strongly that it is well able to put up an
effective fight.  I therefore urge ALL of you to join if you haven't
already. Membership is $10/year, and you can write to CSR at: P.O. Box
19022, Sacramento, CA 95819.

	Incidentally, a letter I sent with my CSR membership prompted
its President, Bob Merrill to send me a couple of very interesting
documents.  One I already had, but the other one was new to me - and
what an eye-opener!  It is a 69-page report by congressman Thomas
J. Bliley, Jr. consisting of his testimony before congress made in
July, 1993 on the EPA's work concerning secondhand smoke.  I won't go
into detail here, but I will say that his report is a powerful
indictment, not only of the EPA, but also of the people who have
corrupted science to further their social agenda.  At the time
Mr. Bliley gave his testimony his efforts were being blocked by Henry
Waxman.  Now that Waxman's out and Bliley is in power it is very
likely that we'll see some great things taking place.  And one thing's
for sure - after reading his report I now understand the full
signficance of having Mr. Bliley in his current congressional
position.  Watch out, folks - the fight ain't over yet!

That's it for now.  See you in February!

Hendricks' letter re a pipe club show coming up this week. Also see
Dr. John Weinstein's letter for news of the Capital Area Pipe Smokers
(northern Virginia and Washington, DC).

And join us for a peaceful smoke, as we contemplate worms,
Catholicism, the Napoleonic wars, the shape of things hopefully never
to come, and several other minor miracles, including the end of
lawsuits, the lighter side of life, and the death OF taxes...

Steve,
       After over one month of being away, I am ready to explode with messages
to pass on the Digest!  I shall, however, refrain from doing so and begin by
thanking Neil Murray for using all of the material I sent him in the most
recent A&amp;M Gazette.
       I would also like to mention another pipe show which will take place
within the next two weeks.  The St. Louis Pipe Club is having their show in St.
Louis at the Stouffer Concourse Hotel February 3-5.  SLPC President Jay Milton
wrote me a letter saying that there will be approximately 40 tables and
displays set up by collectors.  I will post more details very soon...both here
and in alt.smokers.pipes.
       Next...the OTP (Other Tobacco Products--ie stuff that isn't cigarettes)
tax of 20% which has been in effect for over two years in Illinois is no longer
(at least for the time being)  I would like to thank my friends at
alt.smokers.cigars for confirming this one!!!
       Finally, a question...What can any of you tell me about a tinned tobacco
called "Punchbowle?"  I won this in a raffle drawing last October and have yet
to open it.  The tin has no real description of the tobacco composition, simply
"Barney's Tobacco in Full Strength"

Ahhh...that feels much better...
       Thomas A. Hendricks

[ Great news about the OTP tax, and thanks for the tip on the
St. Louis show! -S. ]

<a name="3">Subject: for the digest</a>

Two items that might be of interest to our fellowship:  The Capital Area 
Pipe Smokers (CAPS) club was formed this past Autumn.  With 29 members from 
northern Virginia, D.C., and Maryland, the club meets every 4-6 weeks for 
dinner, a presentation, tobacco/cigar sampling, horse (and pipe) trading and 
a lot of good fellowship.  Those of you in the vicinity are invited to join 
and others who find themselves in the area are welcome to attend our 
meetings.  Contact me via e-mail or by phone at home (703-273-5737) for the 
date, time and location of our next meeting.  Second, JR Tobacco and Holt's 
(Philadelphia) have been running an extraordinary deal ($15.95) on the Zippo 
butane lighter.  Originally priced at $59.95, Zippo discontinued this model 
because it could not maintain quality at a reasonable cost.  The red lacquet 
lighter (Holt's offered red and tortoise but is sold out of the latter) is 
solid, attractive, and very well made.The company's famous lifetime warranty 
covers the product.  I imagine that this deal will not last long.  Despite 
being a long-time devotee of wooden matches, I bought two and have been very 
satisfied with this excellent bargain and product.

[ BTW, I followed up with John on this, and the Zippo is a cigarette
lighter; the better pipe lighters are much different in
construction. Cigarists, though, might take advantage. Thanks for the
tip!  Information like this is one of the special bonuses our members
get sometimes. :-) -S. ]

It's just a side page to my home page referenced in my signature below.
Perhaps one of the cigar home pages on the net could incorporate hypertext

Steve,
   As a fairly new Cigar lover, I have been searching the best ways to keep
my cigars.  At this point I use a tupperware with a small glass humidifier
which you twist the top for added moisture.  I went out and bought a
temp/humidity gauge at Radio Shack.  Someone said that tupperware is not good
since it does not absorb any of the moisture that a humidor would, thats why
they are unfinished on the inside.  Your input would be appreciated.

Also, I have been searching the antique shops and the consignment shops in
search of any Humidors. Its horrible to find that many antique shops turn
humidors into jewelry boxes by refinishing the inside. What a shame.  I came
across three table which the shop owners have told me they were humidors.  It
had a small cabnet on the bottom which was lined with copper?  The seal on
the door was not air tight and it did not appear that it would work well. 

I was wondering, is this a humidor for cigars or possibly pipe tobbacco??
 Have you heard of such humidors and how effective are they?  Why the
copper??

Any input would be greatly appreciated.

A Fellow Cigar Lover,
Chris Harris

Time: 1:37 PM

I am looking at the possibility of a long law-suit coming to a conclusion in
the next few weeks. If, indeed, there is a settlement made I plan on
celebrating by buying one or two new Petersons. I would like to hear
suggestions as to reasonable prices to pay for the following modles:

Rhodesian Bent--Rustic 80s from the Emerald line

Dublin Smooth 120--from Emerald

'Army Spigot'--Large Rhodesian from the Spigot Range

Medium Bent Billiard Sytsem #314

Small Bent Billiard System #317

Canadian 264--from the Killarney line

Any suggestions on other good Peterson pipes welcome--any info on other
brands of pipes in the $50-$150 range welcome as well. My only bias as yet is
against Savinelli--haven't found one I really liked yet--don't like the
pre-carbonization either.

Thanks for the help!

[ Minor administrativa deleted. -S. ]

Then to pipes.

I accidentally lost the file wherein somebody recently asked advice about 
*how to clean the upper surface of pipe bowl*, so I can't refer to the name 
of the fellow pipe smoker, but in my humble opinion pipes are to age with 
their users. I personally like the changes pipes go through *when time goes 
bye* (wasn't it Casablanca and Bogart?). To me pipes are old pals; as I get 
older they are aging, too. Pipes acquire character. I have had pipes for 
about 30 years  now and must admit that the oldest of them have died for a 
long time ago. Of course the expected average living age of a pipe depends 
among other things the number of pipes you have. The more you have - the 
longer they live. To day I have about 20 pipes, so compared to a man who's 
got only one, the estimated life time of a pipe is 20 times longer.

BTW: Do the readers of this list have opinions about *the estimated living 
age of a pipe*?

So, I wouldn't worry about the extra surplus (I don't know the right 
expression for the phenomenon) atop your pipe's bowl. Instead, be proud of 
it: you are a pipe smoker, not a mannequin!

Lets look hopefully to the future despite all the nasty things that are 
happening around us. There are many things to enjoy, for example here in 
southern Finland days are already getting longer, the sun is above horizont 
after four a'clock, p.m. In the northern part of the country night still 
remains around the clock.

[ IMHO, a properly cared for pipe should last forever. My experience
with _stems_, though, is that they last about five years -- except for
Peterson bits, which have yet to fail (knock wood!) -S. ]

Re:  Escudo Pipe Tobacco Internet Digest Info

Thanks for the plug in the Pipe Digest #170 (re: Escudo), just to
update your information a little - I currently have 40 tins of
Escudo in-stock $7.95 per 50 grams. UPS ground shipping runs $6.00
per order (1 or 20 tins). (and) while I stock small "special orders"
from the jobber in Chicago, I do have an account with JBR for those
orders that are large enough to place directly with the importer of
Escudo.

Again, thanks for mentioning PCCA in the Digest!

-Bob 

In Smoke Signal #12 I remember promising to bring you a few tips
from the Folks at Ted's. I've been busy on other things. Now I can
spend some time with the Honourable Company of Pipe and Cigar
Smokers again.

In a recent issue of PD I noted a comment that a spate of flu and
the pipe don't go together, very true. However, I do remember that
my pipe smoking father was ill infrequently, a healthy man upon the
whole. My wife was recently afflicted with a severe cold, though we
sleep in the same bed I remained unaffected. Georges Herment said
that tobacco smoke is good as a vermifuge, at least, I think that is
what he said. I've never had trouble with worms, but I can say that
plaque on my teeth is less of a problem when smoking a pipe, and
that I was unaffected by my wife's contagion.

In the days when you could call for a pipe and call for a bowl and
call for fiddlers three, your pipe was a clay most likely. In #173
a question was: How to clean a clay? In those days of yore, clay
pipes were reused. Wealthy patrons of an ale-house would call for
new pipes, when the customer had finished with the pipe the landlord
of the inn would fire-clean the pipe and offer it to the less
affluent customer. Next time you clean your oven, try putting your
clay pipe in there for a modern fire-cleaning.

In London in the 50s, my father was a teacher at Linden Lodge School
for the Blind and partially sighted. He had a pottery there where he
and the kids made pots and did other arts and crafts. New pottery
was left to dry in the drying-room. When there was sufficient
quantity of pots, he would load the kiln, which was about the size
of a large oven, and fire the pots. A process that took about a
week, during which he would bring it up to temperature slowly in
stages. In those days he used ceramic-cone pyrometers that he loaded
with the pots. I recall looking through the spy-hole at the radiant
interior of the kiln. When the temperature was correct the tip of
the cones would droop over. Correct temperature control is important 
for the glazes. Anyway, after the correct temperatures obtained he
would shut off the gas and allow the kiln to cool over a period of
several days before unloading. All these precautions are necessary
with new pottery to prevent sudden cracks. Every household has a
kiln in the shape of an oven in the kitchen. Try cleaning an old
clay in your oven and see if it answers. Report your results here.

In a recent number a chap reported being harassed for smoking a pipe
by people claiming that his tobacco smelt worse than camel dung.
Proper riposte to snide remarks such as this is: "Have you smelt
camel dung, ever?"

De gustibus non disputandum est: There's no disputing taste.
Singularly apt, I thought, when talking of pipes, tobacco, and
cigars.

In #174 I wondered what shape the smoke would form rising from the
bowl of a pipe puffed by one working in the field of nuclear weapons
command and control.

Well now, let's go into Ted's and read what they have to say about
smoking a pipe: "Smoking a pipe is easy. your smoking enjoyment will
be greatly enhanced if you follow some simple rules.

"Select a good pipe. Whether made of clay, meerschaum, or briar,
your pipe should be well made of aged and porous material. A cheaply
made pipe of inferior materials will seldom provide anything but an
inferior smoke

"Keep in mind that a pipe is an investment. Unlike cigarettes or
cigars, your pipe will reward you with many years of smoking
pleasure if it is well made and cared for.

"Fill your pipe in three pinches of tobacco until you get used to
filling it properly. The first pinch at the bottom of the bowl
should be barely tamped down. The second should be slightly firmer,
and the third firm enough to level the top of the tobacco with the
rim of the bowl. This procedure will result in the tobacco being
fairly evenly packed from top to bottom of the bowl.

"When properly filled, you should feel little or no resistance when
you draw on the pipe.

"With a new pipe, we recommend that you only fill the bowl about a
third full for the first three or four smokings, then half full for
another few smokings, and then you may fully load the bowl.

"It is important to break in a new pipe by smoking it all the way to
the bottom the first several times.

"Lighting your pipe right with the first match will greatly enhance
your smoking pleasure. Circle the entire bowl with the flame, making
sure the top layer is burning evenly. Then lightly tamp it down, as
the tobacco will curl and rise with the first lighting.

"Relight and gently puff. Do not pull as with a cigarette. You
should puff gently and slowly to fully savor the flavor. There is no
need to inhale.

"Good pipe tobacco contains no additives (such as saltpeter or any
of a whole list of adulterants added to most mass-market cigarettes)
to facilitate burning. Your pipe may go out two or three times
during a smoke, but matches or [sic] cheap, so just tamp and
relight."

An aside: Better than matches, I feel, is a butane lighter. I don't
like the taste of burning match-wood. Imco is an Austrian brand of
pipe-lighter that I like, a chrome and plastic device about three
inches long. Very effective and cheap at $10. You can refill it from 
the pressurised butane fuel cans made by Zeus of England, available
here in the U.S.

"Rarely can anyone consistently smoke a pipe to the very bottom of
the bowl so that nothing remains but white ash. The last bit of
tobacco (called the dottle) usually becomes too moist to burn well.
This moisture is the result of condensation from the burning
tobacco."

An aside: In England, in the RAF at least, you could hear people
refer to a particular task as: It's a dottle. Meaning that it was
easy, no sweat.

"When repeated efforts to relight near the bottom of the bowl fail
to overcome the moisture, use a pipe tool to gently remove the
dottle, or grasp the pipe BY THE BOWL and lightly tap against the
palm of your hand to remove the last ash and dottle. Do not hold the
pipe by the stem and rap it against a hard surface or you may break
the stem or crack the shank of your pipe.

"A good smoke can be heavenly, and, where pipes are concerned,
cleanliness is next to heavenliness. Use pipe cleaners religiously
and your pipe will reward you with a sweet cool smoke.

"Neglecting proper cleaning immediately after a smoke can result in
the bowl turning sour from the moist residues which adhere to the
bottom and in the shank.

"For appearance, a little brandy (or your favorite liqueur) on a
soft cloth may be used to clean the rim of the bowl, and passing a
brandy-wet pipe cleaner through the stem can often sweeten a soured
stem.

"Some pipes, once soured, can never be restored to proper smoking
condition. Keep them clean!

"When the caked carbon in the bowl becomes the thickness of a
Nickel, it is time to ream. Come see us for the proper tool and some
instruction.

"Give your pipes a rest. The pipe is made of porous material which
allows it to smoke well because it absorbs flavor from the tobacco
and dissipates heat through the pores. If you over smoke your pipe,
the pores become clogged and the bowl becomes saturated with
residues.

"Not only will such a condition ruin the flavor of the smoke, but
the pipe will smell foul to those around you (even when not lit).

"You will need more than a single pipe to smoke regularly. With
several pipes, individual pipes can be resting a day or two while
you  rotate the duty among your others.

"A well cared for pipe can last a lifetime, so treat it well and you
will have a friend for life.

"If your pipe bites or burns your mouth, you may be smoking too
vigorously, or your choice of tobacco may simply be too strong or
hot-burning. Let us recommend a milder and cooler blend -- and take
it easy!

"New pipes need to be broken in, and the time required varies
greatly between pipes and smokers. Meerschaum or meerschaum-lined
pipes smoke well almost immediately, but a briar pipe may take
months before it yields the superb smoke they are famous for. Be
patient, and let us advise you.

"Have fun with your pipes. Pipes and pipe smokers, much like wines
and their connoisseurs, are steeped in romance. So try different
tobacco blends and differently styled pipes.

"Reading and pipe smoking seem made for each other. There is nothing
like a Sherlock Holmes mystery or a couple of chapters from 'The
Hobbit' or the Tolkien 'Ring Trilogy' to get you in the mood for a
relaxing and satisfying smoke from your pipe.

"Perhaps that is why pipe smokers seem to be a better class of
people."

Here, here! Certainly more tolerant. Recently, I have been reading
Patrick O'Brian's seafaring novels set during the Napoleonic Wars.
He was describing an action in the Mediterranean in which two ships
were at close-quarters exchanging broadsides, the ships were
obscured by clouds of smoke from the cannon fire. So furious an
action that I couldn't read the print for the smoke. I got a bit
carried away and had to put down my pipe. O'Brian is a prodigous
fine writer that I recommend to you, but if you are at ease with the
likes of Sidney Sheldon then you'll find O'Brian overpowering.

Are you bothered by a wet-smoking pipe? Let me remind you of a trick
that works, mentioned by Hacker in his pipe book. When your pipe
starts to "hubble bubble toil and trouble," take a pipe cleaner and
run it down to the bowl through the stem, withdraw it, retamp, and
carry on smoking. It does work.

Mr. Walborn, I appreciate your appreciation, you are most welcome.
Presently I am working up some material for another puff or two and
shall, perhaps, wax philosophical although I'm no apologist, unlike
Mr. Akin.

Catholicism seems to produce philosophers. Frederick Copleston
started writing a presentation of the development of philosophy for
Catholic seminary students, it turned into a nine volume juggernaut.
Philosophy and pipes go together well, take this and mix it with a
good professor for a lot of fun.

<a name="10">Subject: RE: Pipes Digest #174</a>

Greetings to all.
Just a few words..
1)  to Boaz..." what a great poem ! "
2)  re. an inexpensive humidor...  I recently purchased a box of AyC cigars,
and on the back ( the ONLY reason I bought them )  was an offer for a cigar
humidor. The copy reads:
"A Very Special Imported Wood Chest Humidor-
  This humidor with a retail value of over $40 is available to you for $21.95
( shipping and handling are included ) plus a bonus of $4.45 of coupons good
on future purchases af AyC Cigars and free cigar offer.
   Actual size 11 3/4 x 8 1/2 x 5" 
- insure the freshest cigars for your smoking enjoyment.
To recieve this special humidor and coupons, see the order form printed on
the inside of this pack."
It has a limit of 3 humidor chests and requires you to fill out an official
order form. I beleive mine came from a box of Greniediers (sp?) but I
couldn't swear to it.
Two questions, of course popped immediately to mind:
one was- how good could a humidor be if it normally retails for  only $40.00.
and secondly, how much humidor do you need to store cigars that are
hermetically sealed in plastic bags and laced with enough preservatives to
keep Tut-ankh-amin in smokes well into the afterlife?
Keeping this in mind, I intend to purchase one anyway as I have always wanted
a humidor and needing to keep well within budget, as I woefully have learned
that my company was unaware of my single and childless status and thus has
had me listed as having TWO dependents on my w4 form.  Forgive me, fair
smokers, for weeping on your smoking jackets sleeves,but a quick, careful
examination of my E-Z form has lead me to the inexorable conclusion that this
bit of corporate incompetence will require my parting with
no less than $902 dollars. ( and may I say...I hope this buys Bill and
Hillary many fine style and blow dries :-(  and much hair spray for Speaker
Newt.
Farewell from Cols. OH , and I will keep you informed of my humidorean
adventures.

<a name="11">Subject: Cleaning and Re-Fitting Stems</a>

Hello Fellow Puffers:

??????????@?????.??? - asked in the last Pipe Digest how to recondition pipe
stems and also re-fit them so that they are no longer loose. Here goes:

For cleaning, if the stem has any logo on it, cover it up with a little
vaseline or chapstick to protect it. Then place the stems in straight
household bleach (yes! Clorox!) this removes any oxidation (yucky brown
crap.) The bits will fizz a little, let them sit for about an hour. Remove
them and rinse extremely well. Then use a polish to bring back the lustre. I
use Simichrome polish found in motorcycle shops. One note... on some very old
and oxidized stems, this procedure will produce a rough surface which is very
difficult to buff out by hand. If this happens, take it to your local pipe
shop or local jeweler and have them buff it up with rouge wax. If you don't
have access to this, try rouge wax on a buffing wheel with a Dremel Hand
tool.

Re-sizing the bit is a little tricky. Hold the ferrule end of the stem high
over a candle to heat the vulcanite (be careful.) Then press the ferrule end
on a hard surface to "smoosh" the end, (do this slowly.) Don't go to far with
this, try a little bit at a time. If you go too far you can sand down the end
to a perfect fit. I've done this to about five pipe stems with out any
complications.

Hope this helps,
Steven Banks

<a name="12">Subject: Pipe Part Correction...</a>

 In the notes on pipe stem re-fitting I spoke of the "ferrule," that is not
the part that I had in mind. What I was refering to is actually the "tenon."
The part which fits into the "ferrule." Hope this didn't cause any confusion.

I also think that where you got crossed up in your "boil in alcohol," was
probably in reference to boiling the inside of the bowl, which is a practice
used to clean out all of the tars "after" you have reamed out excess carbon
deposits. How I do this is take some Isopropyl Alcohol (rubbing alcohol) and
boil it in the microwave for a few seconds, then carefully pour this into the
bowl of the pipe. The pipe should have it's stem removed and should be held
at an angle so that the alcohol doesn't pour out the other end (I sit it in a
cup.) Let this sit in the pipe for about an hour. Pour it out via the shank,
and then swab with bristle pipe cleaners in the shank until they come out as
clean as they go in. And use a rag to twist inside the bowl. Make sure you
don't get any alcohol on the outside of the pipe, the alcohol will remove any
polish or finish.

<a name="13">Subject: Submission for next digest</a>

Steve:

Shortly after I started smoking a pipe, I asked the tobacconist (a pipe
smoker of many years) to recommend a nonaromatic, on the theory that real men
only smoke English blends.  He handed me a can of Rattray's Red Raparee.  I
took it home, smoked one bowlful, brought it back to the store and told the
tobbaconist he could have it.  Now, several months later, I have tried it
again (after smoking lots of really sweet stuff in the meantime).  I was
surprised to find that it wasn't as revolting as I remembered, although  I
still can't say it's my favorite (I've taken a real liking to Dunhill's Black
Aromatic--I suppose that's at least semi-respectable.)  What does the group
think of this tobacco?  What are the other Rattray blends (and nonblends, I
guess) like?  How long does it take to get used to these blends?
I was surprised that I didn't like the Raparee the first time I tried it,
because I love full-bodied cigars, like the new Avo series (bloody expensive,
but darned tasty).  The Latakia just seems to have a very different flavor
from anything I'm used to.  By the way, I'm sure they don't cure it with
camel dung anymore, but how do they do it?

My tobacconist also wants to know (I posted this message on alt.pipes and
alt.cigars, but haven't yet checked for answers) if anyone has smoked a blend
from England called "Astley's" or something like that.  He apparently used to
order it by the pound wtih a buddy of his, but it's gotten so expensive he's
had to abandon the practice.

Thanks!

<a name="14">Subject: Falcons!</a>

        Greetings, Mr. Masticola, and everyone else. I host a pipe
smoking message conference on the WWIVNet BBS network. If any of you are
on WWIV BBSes, please ask your SysOp to subscribe to THE BRIAR BOWL. The
subtype is BRIAR, and the host is @9201, and auto-requestable. (He/She
will know what that means!)
 
        I thought that might be relevant, because I've been enjoying the
Pipe Digests as messages uploaded by one of our subscribers on The Briar
Bowl...so you see, I've been "lurking" without Internet access! This
person was kind enough to upload some of my replies to the Digest before
I recently received access, though the formatting came out strangely...
 
        By the way, I think your separator:

	~\U ~\U ~\U
 
        would look better as:
 
        u/~ u/~ u/~ u/~ u/~ u/~ u/~ u/~ u/~ u/~ u/~ u/~ u/~ u/~
 
        &lt;grin&gt;
 
        By way of introduction...... I'm 30, and just started smoking a
pipe a year ago. I was in a local drug store, looking for some
last-minute supplies around Christmastime. I had passed the pipe tobacco
section for years and had always liked the smell. In fact, when I first
started driving I thought a bag of pipe tobacco would make a nice car
air freshener! Anyway, I said, "what the heck," and bought some Ultra
Lite (generic) tobacco, a Missouri Meerschaum corncob pipe, some
filters, and a Zippo pipe lighter.
 
        [shimmering flashback effect]
 
        When I was a kid, my uncle Gardner smoked a pipe. I would always
welcome his visits, not because he was especially nice to me, but
because of the smell of his pipe. My parents both smoked cigarettes, and
except for one trial at age 12 with Marlboros, I never had the urge to
get cigarette smoke in my lungs. But I always liked the way the place
smelled when Gardner was there.
 
        [shimmering back-to-normal effect]
 
        Well, I tried the corncob pipe out... I decided very quickly
that I liked it. I used that for a while, trying all kinds of different
tobaccos. Somehow, I got on the mailing list of Thompson Cigar in FL,
even before I started with the pipe. I dug the catalog out, and found
something intriguing: a Falcon pipe. From the description, it seems as
if the Falcon smokes cooler, and keeps much of the poisons out of your
mouth. So, I ordered one. When it arrived, I couldn't resist trying it
out right away... It is WONDERFUL. The detachable bowl makes cleaning
very easy -- just run the metal stem under very hot water and finish
with pipe cleaner fluid. This sort of thing has got to be healthier for
you. Here's the Thompson number; ask for a catalog:
 
        Thompson Cigar (mail order tobacco stuff) 1-800-237-2559
 
I haven't ordered another Falcon from them, but I believe they still
carry four styles. They also have cigars and other pipes, of course. A
friend of mine wanted to get me a green Big Ben pipe we had admired all
year, but by this past Christmas it was no longer being carried.
 
        I've tried many tobaccos in the Falcon, but one of the following
places really impressed me:
 
        Pipeworks &amp; Wilke, custom pipes, tobacco: 1-800-832-8309
 
I think I heard about it through one of the Digests. Unfortunately, I
don't know if they're at the same number or not -- didn't someone here
say they were shifting business again? I shall have to call them and
order some more of their GlenEagle whiskey tobacco.
 
        I would say that my overall favorite has been a toasted
Cavendish style. I find that very mild. The whiskey reminds me more of
my Uncle's pipesmoke though. Unfortunately he passed away a while ago
and nobody seems to remember what brand he had smoked. I smoke less than
once a day, and occasionally skip a whole week. In the warm months, I
smoked in the back stairwell, though with Winter here I have been
puffing away in the living room. (After spending hours cleaning nicotine
off tube ham rigs [my other hobby] I'd rather not add my own layer to
things...)
 
        I wrote to Falcon direct last Fall, trying to find some other
U.S. distributor besides Thompson. They forwarded my letter to The New
Gesty (their main distributor in the U.S.), who told me that Arnold's in
NYC carries the Falcon line. Here's the info I got:
 
                        ----------------
 
        ARNOLD'S TOBACCO SHOP in NYC. (212) 697-1477 and yes they do
mail order but no, they don't have a catalog. Gesty's forwarded a
mini-flyer and price list showing a dozen pipes and some bowls.
 
        THE BLOCK MEERSCHAUM BOWLS HAVE BEEN DISCONTINUED.  :'-(
 
        I got a Falcon Hunter Bent (brown anodized) and a large Snifter
shaped bowl to go with it. Including the $4 shipping, this cost me about
$49! But it DOES seem to be the same price as the four-choice
selection through Thompson.
 
        Here are some highlights:
 
        Standard bent or straight:      $28
        "             bowl only:         17
        Standard STEM ONLY               12
        Hunter straight or bent:         38   (black or brown)
        "             bowl only:         24
        Classic bent:                    36
          (this appears to be a Standard bent silver with a large
          Snifter or etc. bowl)
        Classic (large) bowl only:       24
        Meerschaum lined pipe            36
        "          bowl only             24
        International filter pipe        38
        Alco filter pipe                 26
 
        I've rounded prices off.
 
                        -----------------
 
        That was a few months ago, so I would verify things before
sending your money along. The Hunter Falcon arrived (though it turns out
they couldn't get brown, so I got a black stem) and I have been enjoying
it ever since.
 
        I did try Bengal Slices after reading about them in the Digests.
You people really get my curiosity going! [I'm the same way with world
beers.]
 
        Well, I've gone on long enough for this first post, but I hope
to be joining you regularly. I've just been itching to get that Falcon
info off to you -- it sounded like they were hard to get. Feel free to
reply direct if you would rather, to "???????@??.???". I wonder if I'm
the only 30ish nonsmoker here who made a conscious decision to start on
a pipe?

Steve,

In answer to Jim Clark's request for a good English Blend to try (#174) I 
would suggest something like Dunhill's Elizabethan Blend, or perhaps 
Dunhill's Royal Yacht (a little more toward an aromatic IMHO).

Personally, I like Dunhill's Nightcap about the best, but this is what I 
would call a very full bodied (and strong but of good taste) tobacco. But 
then I do tend to favor the full bodied English Oriental blends.

Hope this is of some use Jim ... Let me know.

<a name="19">Subject: Yet more stuff [PIPES]</a>

Dear Steve:

Just got through perusing the last 2 digests.  As usual, I was just gonna
read 'em, but ended up finding a few things I wanted to comment on (my
friends know how difficult it is for me to keep my mouth shut!).  First off -
greetings to our pipe-smoking compatriots abroad.  It's great to be in
contact with like-minded folk in other countries, and being a confirmed 
Europhile I especially enjoy hearing from our European correspondents.  My
German-Czech-Danish-Swedish ancestry along with my interest in history and
culture (my other great interests besides pipes are World War II and
classical music - among other things I'm a composer) makes me gravitate
towards pipe smoking and things European.  Which brings me to my 1st topic...

In past digests I've seen postings about the fact that pipes in Europe
generally are made for 9 mm. filters.  This brings to mind an experience I
had.  Back in 1986 I had the pleasure of visiting Scandinavia.  While
inCopenhagen I visited the Poul Hansen pipe shop, where I acquired a
beautiful Stanwell.  Problem was that the Danes share the Germans'
preoccupation with these filters, hence the tenon of the stem was hollowed
out.  What I did was take it to the Tinder Box (the original one in the
Peoples' Republic of Santa Mania), and had the pipe repair guys put a
vulcanite insert into the filter chamber.  The insert then had a draft hole
drilled into it and voila! - the stem became the conventional non-filter
variety.  This has worked very well and is quite useful since it not only
fills up all that space, but strengthens the tenon.  I suspect that if I left
it as it was the stem would've broken easily.  I offer this as a suggestion
to anyone who buys a pipe in Europe, including those of you living there.  If
you don't have access to a shop that does repairs you could send the pipe to
Nikos Levin (NML Pipes Direct - see the Resource Guide), since his pipe
repairer should be able to do the job.  Personally I would welcome acquiring
pieces that one can't find here in the 
States (especially a German pipe or two, as I have seen some very nice work
by German pipemakers), and I wouldn't let the filter aspect deter me from
doing so since I know this modification is practical and doable.

In #173 Ian at Western Michigan U. had a question on pipe reconditioning.
 I'll share a technique which I picked up from an old Pipe Smoker magazine
from the mid-80s.  The needed ingredients are:  salt (non-iodized), pure
grain (ethyl) alcohol and something to plug the shank (preferably a rubber
stopper).  First remove the stem from the pipe, then plug the end of the
shank.  Fill the tobacco chamber with salt, but only up to about 1/8" from
the top of the bowl. Then CAREFULLY put in the grain alcohol until it comes
to just below the top
of the bowl.  Be careful not to let the alcohol slop out of the bowl since
this could affect the finish (especially if the wood is stained).  Put the
pipe someplace where it will stay upright and not tip over.  Let the pipe sit
for a minimum of 2 days (I prefer a week), then empty out the salt.  

What happens is that the alcohol gets into the wood and dissolves the tars
and other crud that is in the wood.  The salt then draws the alcohol back
out, where it evaporates leaving the residue behind in the salt.  What you'll
get is a hardpan of salt at the top, the color of which will be anything from
light brown to almost black, depending on how much has accumulated in the
pipe.  When you empty out the salt you'll need to use a pipe tool or nail to
break up the hardpan.  The interesteing thing is the salt below this crust
will pour out as though it had never been exposed to moisture.  After you
empty the bowl use a pipe tool (or your finger) to clean out any remaining
grains of salt.  Also run a pipe cleaner through the draft hole to clear it
of any salt in there.  Please note that this method does not disturb the
carbon cake in the tobacco chamber.

There are a couple of important things to know about the alcohol.  Firstly,
it must be ethyl (grain or potato) alcohol, NOT denatured, methyl or
isopropyl as these are toxic.  Secondly, it must be pure.  Spirits such as
Bourbon, Vodka, etc. contain too much water and are therefore not nearly as
effective.  Introducing all that water is also not going to do your pipes any
good, and in fact pure alcohol will take out any excessive moisture bound up
in the wood.  This helps with pipes that have become "wet" smokes before the
treatment.  I have used this technique often, and it works VERY well -
especially if you're trying to revive a pipe that's gone sour.  I also
recommend it as "preventive maintenance" on pipes just to keep 'em smoking
nicely.  How often you do it is up to you, but I do mine about every 10
years.  BTW - getting the pure stuff can be a problem if you live in a state
that prohibits the sale of grain alcohol in liquor stores (such as here in
California.  And we're supposed to be the party state!  Go figure!).  If this
is the case contact your local chemical companies, or if you're lucky enough
to have access to biomedical facilities, a lot of labs use ethyl alcohol.  If
all else fails you'll have to get it from a state where its sale is legal.
 For example next time you or someone you know goes to Lost Wages (oops!  I
mean Las Vegas) or anywhere else in Nevada you'll be able to waltz into a
liquor store and buy it (Ever-Clear is a common brand name).

It's my understanding that Nikos Levin's pipes are reconditioned by boiling
the alcohol through the pipes with some kind of retort-type apparatus.  I
prefer my method, however, because it's slower and therefore probably does a
more thorough job of taking the gunk out. The last part of refurbishing a
pipe involves cleaning up the stem.  The bleach treatment was detailed in the
last digest (#174), so I won't repeat it here.  While the Simichrome idea is
good, the better followup would be to have the stem buffed and waxed on a
buffing wheel.  I have found that using this process will restore an old
vulcanite stem to its original black color, whereas buffing without the
bleach treatment is not effective in entirely removing the discoloration.
 For those of you who would buff the stems out yourselves:  Mr. Masticola was
correct in saying that a bench grinder is much better than a Dremel tool for
buffing stems.  The only problem, however, is that grinders are usually too
high in the rpms.  The preferred way would be to buy an old electric motor
(preferably double-axeled) - they can easily be found at places that repair
washers and dryers.  With a couple of cotton buffing wheels, some Tripoli
compound and Carnauba wax you'll be able to buff your own pipes and stems (be
sure to securely mount the motor on a bench first, though).  

And now on to toback.  In #173 Stephen (???????@???????.??.??) was discussing
Erinmore Flake.  I've found generally that pipes smokers either love or hate
Erinmore - as for me it is one that I really enjoy.  If he owns a meerschaum
I highly recommend that he try it in that, rather than a briar.  I have 3
sets of pipes I smoke in rotation:  1 set of briars for aromatics, another
for English/Oriental blends, and my meerschaums with which I smoke only
straight Virginias and flake tobaccos, such as Erinmore, Escudo, Capstan,
etc.  For 
some reason I find that meerschaum brings out the qualities of these kinds of
tobaccos better than briar, whereas briar seems to be better for the English
and flavored aromatic blends.  Since the pipe becomes imbued with the
characteristics of the tobacco smoked in it the idea of having seperate
rotations of pipes for the different general groups of tobaccos makes sense.
 Alas, I digress...

Back to Erinmore.  The Erinmore tobaccos are flavored with pineapple juice
(!), hence the pineapple in their logo.  In '87 I visited Nova Scotia.  At a
store in Halifax I found a pouch of Erinmore "Mild and Mellow", which was
somewhat similar to their flake.  I've yet to see it anywhere here, which is
too bad, because I really liked it.  I smoked the Erinmore Mixture years ago.
 From what I recall it was also similar to the flake, but was a loose
tobacco.  And I'm sorry Mr. Masticola, but it's nothing like Brindley's
Mixture, which is a burley-based mixture.  It has about as much flavor as
sawdust and is generally awful.

On the subject of cleaning clays Mr. Hacker is correct.  In fact the embers
of a fire will be hot enough to turn the clay back to its original white
without being so hot as to crack the bowl (which I did once putting a clay on
my gas stove).  Ted Wagner's comment on moisture in the clay is right on the
money - be sure the pipe has rested and thoroughly dried out before putting
it in the fire.  I'd rather have a clay pipe color, though, so I find a long
pipe cleaner useful for my favorite Goudewagen churchwarden.  If you can't
get a cleaner all the way through to the bowl (a problem I have with the
Goudewaagen), then a thin piece of wire (I use brass wire) will be sufficient
to clear the end of the draft hole in the bowl.  Heating it first is also a
good idea since it facilitates getting the wire through the buildup of tar.
 One last things on clays - like meerschaum they should never be allowed to
develop a carbon cake.  As with meerschaum the inside of the bowl should have
the ash residue wiped out with a cloth or paper towel.  Unlike meerschaum,
however, the cloth can be moistened with water to make the cleaning easier.
 And remember about letting the pipe dry out thoroughly if you want to put it
in your fireplace to bake it clean.  BTW - do NOT use the fireplace method on
glazed or double-walled clays (right again, Mr. Wagner).

I'll wrap things up with some info I just got from Californians for Smokers'
Rights.  I talked with CSR veep Otto Mueksch on Thursday, 1/26.  He gave some
interesting details on the OSHA smoking ban hearings which started 2 weeks
ago.  Specifically - the government has PAID certain expert witnesses to
testify on behalf of enacting the ban.  4 of these witnesses also sat on the
supposedly "unbiased" Scientific Advisory Board that evaluated the EPA's work
on secondhand smoke.  One of these, a Dr. Stanton Glantz has done research
(funded by taxpayers) claiming to show that up to 53,000 Americans die each
year as a result of heart problems brought on by exposure to secondhand
smoke.  Glantz's work has been roundly criticized by other researchers - and
here's the kicker - Herr Doktor Glantz is a MECHANICAL ENGINEER!!!  In other
words, he has no qualifications whatsoever to be doing any kind of health
research.  And yet this man influences public policy and gets money from us
for doing it.  What we have here can best be described as an incestuous
relationship between government and activists, with corruption as vast as it
is well-hidden.  Boy, oh boy, oh boy!  Take notice, people - we have every
right to be very upset about what's going on, and we have every reason to
take action.  I urge all of you to write to your congresspeople about this.
 We should also get in touch with Congressman Tom Bliley, Jr., who's now in a
position to do something about all this.  I'll be getting in touch with his
office and if he has an e-mail address I'll pass it along in the next Digest.
 If OSHA goes through with the ban I think we may see a congressional
investigation of the agency, which I believe would give us a fighting chance
to start turning things around.  Best thing we can do right now, though, is
let the people in Washington know that we're aware of what is going on and
demand that they take steps to curb what has become an unconscionable abuse
of power.

Well, I think I'll put my soapbox away and go to bed.  Thanks, Steve, for
allowing me to hog so much space in these digests.  It's great to have a
forum, and I think it's like pipe 
smoking - we shouldn't take it for granted!

Regards,

Steve J. (Briar Man)

Thought for the day:  "Mince pies, not words."

[ I will certainly mail Congressman Bliley! Thanks! -S. ]
