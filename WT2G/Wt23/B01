<h3>Human Relations</h3>

The Human Relations major is a joint program of the departments of Anthropology and Sociology and 
Psychology. Students may pursue either a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science degree in Human Relations. 
These studies, complemented by the broad liberal education of all-college requirements, will give the student a 
solid foundation for life in our society and will facilitate graduate study in a broad spectrum of disciplines or 
professional opportunities in personnel management, many social service fields, and other areas involving 
human relations.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><br>
The Bachelor of Arts degree program in humanities enables students to study a particular period, 
theme, or topic through the humane disciplines. The humanities major extends the general education 
requirements of the college to allow students to pursue further work in the arts, history, literature, 
philosophy, and foreign language.
<P>
 The major includes a core program of required courses and an 
upper-level special program. The special program, which students will design in consultation with 
appropriate faculty members, may focus on a particular period -- the later Middle Ages, for 
example, or the early Twentieth Century -- or on a particular topic such as American romanticism 
or Renaissance humanism. <P>

<H3>Overview</H3>
<PRE>
  The purpose of the Honors Program in Liberal Arts is to
encourage excellence through a program of special courses, broad
distribution requirements, and extracurricular events. 
  The special courses, which introduce students to the
development of Western civilization from the ancient Greeks and
Hebrews down to the present, are developed and taught by a
course director and another faculty member from a complementary
discipline. Each course approaches its period through broad,
interdisciplinary historical studies of art, literature,
philosophy, science, religion, and politics. Guest lectures and
other presentations by visiting scholars are scheduled
frequently. 
  The broad distribution requirements encourage contact with as
many departments as possible outside students' majors.
Extracurricular events, both academic and social, extend
students' studies beyond the classroom and enable them to form
those friendly relationships with faculty that characterize
liberal studies at their best.
  To be invited to participate in the program as entering
freshmen, students should have a composite score of at least 27
on the ACT or appropriate scores on the SAT, have graduated in
the top 10 percent of their senior class in high school, or
merit special consideration.
  New transfer students must have had at least a 3.35 GPA (B) in
the two most recent college semesters; students with only one
semester of college work must have had a 3.35 GPA during that
semester.
  To enter after one semester or more at Rockford College,
students must have a cumulative 3.0 GPA. If they do not meet the
ordinary standards, students may apply for special consideration
and may be admitted at the discretion of the chair of the Honors
Program in Liberal Arts. To continue in the program and complete
it successfully, students must maintain a cumulative GPA of at
least 3.0.

<A NAME="overview"></A>
<h3>Overview</h3><BR>

The Department of Mathematics offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science programs that
reveal mathematics as one of the humanities -- a creation of the human mind. We emphasize
the value of the broad studies to acquire the B.A. degree, and we urge all mathematics majors to
develop foreign-language skills.While some courses fulfill a service role for all-college requirements 
and (notably statisticsand other applied areas) for majors in the sciences and social sciences, a 
resurgence of majors in mathematics is under way nationally and at Rockford College.
<P>


<A NAME="career"></A>
<h3>Career opportunities</h3><BR>

Career opportunities
The spectrum of career opportunities for mathematics majors is quite appealing, with teaching
and computer-related work being among the more popular. With a severe shortage of
mathematicians in academia and in industry looming in the near future, a major in mathematics
also provides a very viable entry into academic and actuarial professions and a variety of
positions in industry, the computer field, and governmental service.<P>

<A NAME="overview"></A><h3>Overview</h3>
<p><br>
The Reserve Officer Training Corps Unit Program at Rockford College is offered
through a 
cross-enrollment agreement with Northern Illinois University [NIU ROTC
Program--(815) 
753-0574]. Army ROTC is specifically designed to give students training and
experience in 
organization, motivation and leadership, while completing bachelor's degrees in
their majors of 
choice. Completion of the ROTC program leads to a commission in the active U.S.
Army, Army 
Reserves or National Guard. The Reserve Officer Training Corps is open to all
eligible full-time 
students, both male and female. A total of 22 semester hours of academic credit
is available and is 
applicable toward graduation requirements as elective credit. The curriculum is
centered on an 
applied leadership training program, which is designed to develop personal
traits and qualities 
essential to successful leadership in civilian life as well as in the military
environment. There is no 
military service obligation for completing only the first two years of Army
ROTC. <br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<A NAME="programs"></A><h3>Programs</h3>
<p>Army ROTC offers both four-year and two-year programs. The four-year program
consists of a 
basic course and an advanced course. The basic course, normally taken in the
freshman and 
sophomore years, provides instruction in the fundamentals of leadership,
management and the 
national security structure, with emphasis on leadership development. The
advanced course, which 
normally covers the final two years at the college, includes a six-week Advanced
Camp, usually 
attended the summer following the junior or senior year of college. While
enrolled in the advanced 
program, all students receive $150 per month during the school year and are paid
for attending the 
Advanced Camp. Instruction includes advanced leadership development, group
dynamics, 
organization and management, small unit tactics, and military law and
administration. The program is 
flexible enough to accommodate almost all students who are interested in
participating. The 
two-year program is designed specifically for transfer students or other
students who were unable 
to take Army ROTC during the first year or two of college. To enter this
program, students usually 
attend a six-week Basic Camp the summer before entering the Advanced Course.
Application is 
made in the spring. Students earn more than $700 while attending Basic Camp.
Upon completion of 
the camp, students may enter directly into the Advanced Course and start
receiving $150 per 
month. Students who are military veterans may contact the NIU Army ROTC offices
at (815) 
753-6234 for special information regarding entry into the Advanced Course. <br>
</p>
<A NAME="eligibility"></A>
<h3>Eligibility</h3>
<p>To enroll in the Military Science program leading to an Army officer's
commission, students<br>
must be: <br>
<br>
Citizens of the United States or lawfully admitted to the United States for<br>
permanent residence under applicable provisions of the Immigration and<br>
Naturalization Act and At least 17 years of age or have parental consent.<br>

30 years of age. Age requirements may be waived in some cases, especially for
those<br>
with prior military service and those majoring in nursing.<br>
Physically and mentally qualified and of good moral character.<br>
<br>
If these criteria are not met, students may enroll in military science courses
for academic<br>
credit, but will not be eligible for appointments as commissioned officers. <br>
<br>
Entering freshmen should register for Military Science 101 in their first
semester.<br>
Sophomores with no previous ROTC experience may register for both the freshman
and<br>
sophomore courses and become eligible to enter the advanced course at the
beginning of<br>
the junior year. Juniors and seniors who wish to register for the basic program
should<br>
confer with the military science program advisor before enrolling. <br>
</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<A NAME="commision"></A>
<h3>Commissioning requirements</h3>
<pre>To be eligible for a commissions as second lieutenants in the U.S. Army, 
students must have completed all military science advanced program course 
work and be in good academic standing. For other requirements, confer with 
the chair of the Department of Military Science.

Classes are taught on the Rockford College campus when there are ten or 
more students registered during a semester.  Rockford College students attend

<h3>Overview</h3>



  The nursing major at Rockford College prepares students as professional nurse generalists to provide nursing care to individuals, families, groups, and communities with diverse health needs. The major offers a broad scientific base in nursing, related disciplines, and the liberal arts; an introduction to nursing research; an understanding of nursing as a scholarly discipline; practice in multiple settings with diverse clients; and knowledge of the roles and functions of nursing in the health care system and society. 

<P>The Department of Nursing offers a program of study that leads to a Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing (BSN). The BSN completion track is designed for Registered Nurses (RNs) who are graduates of diploma or associate degree programs in nursing. The basic four-year track is for beginning students interested in becoming registered nurses. Successful completion of the basic track qualifies students to apply for the professional nurse licensure examination. The liberal arts education tradition of Rockford College fosters a holistic view of persons, facilitates critical thinking and decision making, provides opportunities for exchanging ideas, stimulates intellectual growth and creativity, and encourages contributions to the nursing profession and society. The integration of professional and liberal arts education at Rockford College ensures that students gain an appreciation for diversity, develop confidence in their own abilities, and apply their talents within a practice discipline.<P>

Students will learn to communicate effectively, think analytically and solve problems, deal with ethical concerns, and collaborate with others in the health care system. Personal and professional growth opportunities promote commitment to students' own health, the care of clients, and enhancement of the profession.<P>

The Rockford College nursing program is accredited by the National League for Nursing and is approved by the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation.

<P>

<A NAME="career"></A>

<h3>Career opportunities</h3>

Registered Nurses with BSN degrees have numerous employment and advanced educational opportunities. Graduates from the Rockford College nursing program have positions as staff nurses in acute care and community health; become nurse managers and staff developers; and practice industrial and home health nursing. In addition, some continue their education to become school nurses. Others enter graduate school to pursue a specialized interest in nursing.

<P>

<A NAME="require"></A>

<h3>Degree requirements</h3>

<P>

  Special requirements include CPR certification for health-care providers, immunizations, nursing uniforms and equipment, and malpractice insurance. Some of these items are at students' expense, and others are included in course fees. Students will be notified in advance of expenses.<P>

<STRONG>Basic BSN Track</STRONG>
<P>The basic BSN track helps students acquire knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes essential to professional nursing. The strong clinical component lets the student apply knowledge and skills in clinical settings. The individualized professional internship in the final semester smoothes the transition from student to practitioner.<P>

An interim internship between junior and senior year is optional. Entering freshmen or transfer students at Rockford College enroll in general education courses and prerequisites for the nursing major. Entering freshmen should have successfully completed high school biology, chemistry, and two years of algebra. Students who do not have this background may not be able to complete the BSN degree in four years. 

<P>Students apply for admission to the nursing major in the fall semester before enrolling in clinical nursing courses. To be accepted into the nursing major students must:

<UL>
<LI>Maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of C+ (2.5).
<LI>Achieve at least a C (2.0) grade in all required social and natural science support courses.
<LI>Provide proof of satisfactory health examination, immunizations, and CPR certification.
</UL>



Students are responsible for their own transportation to clinical experiences and each student must have a car available for community health clinical experience (Nursing 406).<BR>

<H3>Overview</H3>
<PRE>
  Philosophy is the systematic study of the fundamental
questions: What is real?  Does God exist? Is the soul immortal?
Do I have free will? What ought I do with my life?  Through the
study of these questions, students of philosophy acquire
critical thinking skills, knowledge of influential ideas in our
cultural history, and the ability to reflect deeply and
independently on the basic questions of human life.
</PRE>

<A NAME="career"></A>
<H3>Career opportunities</H3>
<PRE>
  Career opportunities for philosophy majors are numerous.
Philosophy majors have been successful in business, in writing,
in teaching, and in editing. As well as training students for
graduate studies in philosophy and the humanities, the
philosophy major is a popular choice for pre-law students
because of the rigorous development of abstract, analytical, and
argumentative abilities that the study of philosophy makes
possible.
  The Department of Philosophy offers the Bachelor of Arts degree
with a major in philosophy.
</PRE>

<A NAME="require"></A>

<PRE>
Two basic courses in physics are provided to complement other scientific
disciplines and to give students in humanities, arts and social studies a
basic understanding of the physical laws which govern our universe. The
calculus-based year of physics courses is for preprofessional majors such
as biology, chemistry, engineering, medicine and dentistry. The
algebra-based physics program is for some science majors and non-science
majors. 

The Department of Physics offers a minor in physics, and one advanced
course is offered every fall and spring for minors in physics. The
concentration of mathematics and physics in the program listed below can
prepare students for graduate school in physics. Additional advanced
courses in physics are offered as required.

<a name="overview"></a><h3>Overview</h3>
<p><br>
The Department of Political Science helps students develop their minds and characters to become 
decent, responsible, informed citizens. Political science shows the relation of politics to human 
nature and examines the basic alternatives in political life. The ordinary citizen has decent opinions 
about justice and the common good. The educated citizen should rise above opinion in the direction 
of truth while maintaining goodwill, sincerity, tolerance, generosity, and fairness. A liberal, political 
education will equip students to analyze and criticize their country without becoming destructive of 
the common good or domestic tranquillity. The department's academic offerings cover the full range 
of essential subjects in the discipline of political science: political philosophy, constitutional law, 
American government and politics, comparative politics and international relations, and diplomacy 
and statecraft. While there is no special pre-law program at Rockford College, most students who 
plan to attend law school major in political science and are advised by its faculty. Certain political 
science courses are required for the criminal justice track of the anthropology/sociology major. The 
department sponsors a Washington and United Nations Semester for upper-division students, as 
well as regular semester and summer internships for appropriate individual students. Students 
interested in political science for the purpose of becoming secondary school teachers should also 
consult the catalog section on the Social Sciences divisional major. The Department of Political 
Science offers the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees. <br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<A NAME="career"></a><h3>Career Opportunities</h3>
<p>Governmental work is one of the most extensive areas of opportunity for political science graduates. 
The degree can also lead to positions with private businesses, or in law, politics, journalism, and 
teaching, among others. <br>

<h3>Overview</h3>


  Rockford College offers combined programs in engineering, dentistry, law, medicine, pharmacy and the paramedical areas which permit students to transfer 24 to 30 hours for bachelors degrees. Rockford Collegeand most professional schools believe, however, that it is desirable for the student to complete work for the degree before beginning professional training. General requirements for bachelors degrees in these combined programs are:<P>
Completion of three years of study in liberal arts courses, with at least 30 of the last 36 semester hours at Rockford College. Completion of the all-college degree requirements.
Completion, before leaving Rockford College, of at least two thirds of the requirements for the major.  An average of at least C in all the specified work (one to two years) at the professional school.<P>

The specific courses and number of credits required vary with each program. Likewise, entrance requirements for the professional programs may vary with the institution. Therefore students must consult with  the specific program advisor.<P>

Most application procedures begin in the fall, so we are unable to provide proper evaluation
based on two to four weeks of contact if students apply during the first year here.<P>

<strong>Health Professions</strong><BR><P>
Students interested in the allied health professions (i.e. medical technology, physical therapy, occupational therapy, etc.) may obtain a Rockford College degree and then go to the appropriate professional school to complete their education. Students may choose either the B.A. or the B.S. degree but they must complete the foreign language requirement for the B.A.  They may major in any field as long as they fulfill the science and mathematics requirements of the professional school.  For most schools, these requirements include one year of biology, one year of physics, one course in calculus and analytic geometry, and two years of chemistry.  They should also take Mathematics 224 or Mathematics 230.  If 
they major in biology, they should take Biology 101 and Biology 103 and/or Chemistry 105 and Chemistry 106 in the freshman year.  A student's six or eight semester plan will be determined by the major program chosen.<P>

<strong>Premedical and predental programs</strong><BR><P>
Since medical and dental school requirements are undergoing change, students are strongly
urged to be familiar with the specific requirements of the schools to which they intend to apply. Information on the specific requirements of medical schools may be found in Medical School Admission Requirements, available from the premedical advisor. Corresponding information regarding dental schools may be found in Admission Requirements of American Dental Schools, available through the dental advisor.<P>

If students have strong foundations in science, they may major in almost any area. However, a major in chemistry with the addition of Biology 101 and 103, or a major in biology with the addition of Physics 105-106 or 201-202 and Mathematics 130 (required by some medical schools) usually will meet the requirements.<P>
<A NAME="require"></A>
The minimum requirements for almost all medical and dental schools include the following:
<P>
<pre>
Bio 101 Principles of Biology                4 hours
Bio 103 Animal Biology                       4 hours
Chem 105-106 General Chemistry               8 hours
Chem 205-206 Organic Chemistry               8 hours
Phys 105-106 Fundamentals of Physics or
Phys 201-202 Introduction to Physics   }  8-10 hours
</pre>
<P>
Almost all medical schools require applicants to take the Medical College Admission Test
(MCAT), usually in the spring of the junior year or in the fall of the senior year. Applications are available from the program advisor. A basic understanding of statistics is recommended for this exam. It may be obtained by taking Math 224 Elements of Statistics or Math 312 Intermediate Statistical Methods.<P>
Most dental schools require applicants to take the Dental Aptitude Test (DAT). Applications for the test may be obtained from the program advisor. Arrangements for taking these tests are the responsibility of the student.<P>
<strong>Prepharmacy program</strong><P>
If students plan to go into pharmacy, they may take two, three or four years of course work at
Rockford College before going to a college of pharmacy.

Students may take two years of basic mathematics and science courses at Rockford College
and then transfer to a pharmacy program if they have completed the prerequisites. At the University of Illinois Collegeof Pharmacy, students can earn a Doctor of Pharmacy degree after four more years of study. They may need to take some courses in the summer to meet the entrance requirements.<P>

Students may choose to take four years at Rockford College for a bachelor's degree and then go four years to the UIC College of Pharmacy and earn a PharmD. To accelerate this process, students may participate in a three-four program, attending Rockford College for three years of general education courses and the science and mathematics courses needed to study pharmacy. Students would take four additional years at UIC College of Pharmacy, earning a bachelor's degree from Rockford College after one or two years at 
UIC and a PharmD degree at the end of the four years. The three-four program requires students to complete the Rockford College General Education Requirements, including at least one course in sociology or psychology, One in economics or finance, and one in physics. Students also must complete two-thirds of the requirements for a major at Rockford College.<P>

The UIC College of Pharmacy requires that entering students earn at least a 2.5 grade point
average (4.0 scale) with no grades below C and have at least 20 semester hours of general education courses. Students must take at least one course in each of the following five areas (these courses also meet Rockford College General Education Requirements):<P>
<pre>
    Social and behavioral sciences (i.e., sociology, psychology)
    Economics and finance (i.e., economics, banking, finance, accounting)
    Fine arts (i.e., art, music, drama)
    Physical sciences (i.e., physics - recommended, geology, astronomy)
    Humanities (i.e., history, philosophy)</pre><P>

One of the above courses must meet the UIC cultural diversity requirement.<P>
<strong>Preveterinary program</strong><P>
Some schools of veterinary medicine require applicants to complete a course or two in agricultural sciences prior to admission. Students should be familiar with the requirements of the schools to which theywish to apply. Generally, the minimum requirements for admission to veterinary school include:
<pre>
Bio 101 Principles of Biology             4 hours
Bio 103 Animal Biology                    4 hours
Chem 105-106 General Chemistry            8 hours
Chem 205-206 Organic Chemistry            8 hours
Phys 105-106 Fundamentals of Physics      8 hours
Bio 309 Genetics                          3 hours
Bio 308 Microbiology                      4 hours
Chem 308 Biochemistry                     4 hours
</pre>
<P>
<strong>Pre-engineering program</strong><P>
Students with an interest in engineering have two choices in pre-engineering at Rockford
College.  Obtain a bachelor's degree from Rockford College, then go to an engineering school, usually earning a bachelor or master of science in engineering after two more years of study.  Enter the three/two program, taking courses for three years at Rockford College to meet General Education Requirements and take basic mathematics, science, and computer courses required to study engineering. With two additional years of study at an engineering school, students earn a bachelor's degree from Rockford College at the, end of the first year and a bachelor of science degree in the desired field of engineering at the end of the second year.<P>

Each engineering school has specific requirements which generally involve two years of
mathematics, including calculus and differential equations, one year of physics, proficiency in an appropriate computer language (usually Pascal or FORTRAN) and one or two years of chemistry.<P>

Rockford College is affiliated with the College of Engineering of the University of Illinois, Washington University in St. Louis, and the University of Southern California. Further information about the program and its specific requirements are available from the liaison officer at Rockford College.<P>

Rockford College students also have followed three/two programs with a variety of other
engineering schools, including Illinois Institute of Technology.<P>

There are many career advantages in earning both a baccalaureate from Rockford College and an engineering degree. The liberal arts component contributes a broader background in the social sciences and humanities and should enhance the ability to communicate, solve problems and reason. If students earn a bachelor of arts degree, they will learn a second language and become familiar with another culture, which will help them deal with clients and customers from abroad. The dual degree background is viewed as an 
asset by many employers.<P>

Information on other professional programs is available from the program advisors.

<H3>Overview</H3>
<pre>
The Psychology Department seeks to develop understanding of principles of human 
behavior and thought, which are both broadly applicable and deeply explanatory, through 
such scientific methods as observation, measurement, experiment, and theory construction. 
and by examining great themes, great events, and great men and women  just as a 
philosopher, historian, or student of literature would do.<P>

As psychology majors, students will be prepared to benefit from a broad variety of 
experiences. Students will have a deeper understanding of the human condition as it 
applies to them and to their fellow humans. As liberal arts students, they will learn to 
organize and analyze information, to speak and write clearly, and to use numbers 
effectively to make a point.  As psychology majors, students will learn to enrich their 
personal relationships with human understanding and sound social judgment. The 
Department of Psychology offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees.  The 
department encourages its majors to enrich their understanding with one or two semesters 
in London at Regent's College.</pre>

<A NAME="career"></A>
<h3>Career opportunities </h3>
<pre>
The Rockford College psychology program will prepare the student well for graduate 
training, and professional careers and opportunities continue to expand for holders of 
graduate degrees: counseling, medical psychology, clinical psychology, industrial 
psychology, school psychology, engineering psychology, academic and research 
psychology, and more.  <P>

Students also can choose course work to prepare for graduate programs outside 
psychology leading to professional specializations in business, social work, law, medicine, 
and education. Many students continue with graduate study in preparation for teaching or 
research careers.  <P>

Many enter career positions in areas such as mental health, educational services, social 
work, and personnel work.  Others obtain positions in conventional business or social 
service settings not directly related to psychology, but in which psychological knowledge 
and skills may be applied.
</pre>

<A NAME = "overview"></a><h3>Overview</h3><P>

  The divisional major in Science and Mathematics is an integrated program in which the courses
are intellectually related. It has two main purposes:
   <UL><LI>To give students flexibility in preparing for a career involving diversity of background in the
     sciences.<BR>
    <LI>To allow students to concentrate in areas of specialization which cut across the traditional
    scientific disciplines.</UL><P>

The major provides students an opportunity to concentrate in no more than three related disciplines with not less
than 44 hours of course work appropriately divided among the disciplines. Students must develop the program in
consultation with the appropriate departmental chair and obtain the approval of the division as a
whole. Students must complete a substantial amount of 300-level work in at least two departments in the
division.<P>


<a name ="career"></a><h3>Career Opportunities</h3><P>
     The Science and Mathematics divisional major lends itself to a variety of specific career 
goals or preparationsfor further study. Among the possible careers are science-related business, 
science librarianship, sciencepublishing, secondary school teaching, scientific computer applications, 
environmental protection activities, etc.<P>

range of public service fields.

<h2>KEEP THIS FOR EASY REFERENCE </h2>
     
     <h2>IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER DURING YOUR YEARS AT ROCKFORD COLLEGE</h2>
     
     <pre>(This is intended for all full-time and part-time undergraduate,
     students who are pursuing a degree, unless otherwise noted)
     </pre>
     <ul>
     <LI>All students must stop by the Business Office on or before 4 p.m. on the
     first day    of class each semester to get their ID cards validated and to and
     make arrangements    for payment of their tuition.  If you do not do this,
     your registration will be     purged and you will have to pay a $25 late fee
     to be re-registered.<BR><BR>    
     <LI>All students must make sure their health records have been received by
     the Lang     Health Center.  If you do not do this, you will have a "hold"
     placed on your        records and you will not be able to pre-register for the
     following semester until    that "hold" has been removed.<BR><BR>     
     <LI>All full-time undergraduate students must attend two forum series events
     each         semester.  The College Forum Series is a graduation requirement
     and failure to      attend two events each semester will prevent you from
     graduating.  If you are unable    to attend two events, you can listen to the
     tapes which are kept in the library and    write a 200-word paper.<BR><BR>     
     <LI>If you want to transfer a course into Rockford College once you have
     matriculated    at Rockford College you must have that course approved before
     you take it.  There    is a form called "Transfer of Credit" which must be
     filled out and signed by the    appropriate department chair.<BR><BR>     
     <LI>All undergraduate students, upon completion of the freshman English
     requirement     (ENGL 112 or the equivalent), must fulfill the Upper Division
     Requirement in        Writing or Public Speaking (UDRWOPS).  You can do this
     in one of three ways:  
       a) written exam, b) speech, c) course.  If you intend to satisfy the
     requirement    by taking an exam, you must do so by the semester in which 75
     hours are achieved.    If you do not pass the appropriate examination by the
     time 75 hours are achieved,    then you must register for an UDRWOPS course
     recommended by the UDRWOPS Committee.    Students who transfer in 75 hours or
     more must pass an examination during their first semester at Rockford
     College or register for an UDRWOPS course recommended    by the UDRWOPS
     Committee.<BR><BR>     
     <LI>In the second semester of your sophomore year you will need to file a
     Declaration    of Major.  Simply putting a preferred major on your application
     for admission is    not the same thing.  You will need to do this before you
     can pre-register for       classes for your junior year.  If you do not do
     this ahead of time you will be      required to sign a waiver form stating
     that the Office of Registration will not be    responsible if you do not
     graduate on time.<BR><BR>     
     <LI>Graduation applications are due according to the following schedule:
<PRE> 
June 15 for students completing requirements in the summer         
September 15 for students completing requirements in the fall      
Second Friday in December for students completing requirements in May

<A NAME="inc"></A>
<H2>Incompletes</H2>
<STRONG>ADMINISTRATIVE INCOMPLETE</STRONG><BR>
The Dean of the College, may in exceptional circumstances, approve 
an administrative incomplete ("I") for a student who has carried a 
subject with a passing grade until near the end of the semester and 
then, because of unusual and substantial cause beyond the student's 
control, has been unable to take the final examination or to complete 
some limited amount of work.  An application form is completed by the 
student and must be signed by the instructor and the Dean of the College.  
Failure to appear for a final examination or to complete term work in 
the time allowed is not automatic justification for an incomplete, except 
as indicated above; and in default of such evidence, the test or other 
work will be graded as an "F" and averaged into the student's semester 
or term work.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>MEDICAL INCOMPLETE</STRONG><BR>
A medical incomplete ("IM") grade may be reported for a student who 
is unable to complete course work and/or take the final examination 
because of illness.  An application form must be completed by the student 
and signed by the instructor of the course and the Dean of the College 
upon receipt of a written statement by a physician.

<P>An "IM" grade must be removed within six months after the official 
ending date of the semester in which the medical incomplete was incurred.  
The student with an "IM" grade may 1) elect to complete the course work 
and thereby receive a standard letter grade, 2) petition the professor 
to receive a "P" in the course if enough work was completed to legitimize 
such a grade,  or 3) petition the Dean of the College to receive an 
"MW" (Medical Withdrawal) from the course.

<P>It is the student's responsibility, in consultation with the instructor, 
to arrange for the removal of the medical incomplete.  There will be 
a $20.00 charge for each medical incomplete granted.

<P>Regent baseball is very respected in the Midwest. Playing a perennially
rugged schedule that includes Cartage, Aurora, North Central, Loras, and
U-Wisconsin-Whitewater makes the Regents stronger. &quot;There are no cupcakes
in the Central Region&quot; states coach Langston. Each year the team begins
the season in Florida playing in Ft. Myers to prepare for the northern
season. </P>

<P>Most importantly, Regent Baseball players graduate on time, have a great
baseball experience and get a quality education. </P>

<H2>Bill Langston, Head <A NAME="Coach"></A>Coach</H2>

<P>Bill Langston has spent 16 years at the helm of the Regents, winning
over 300 games. His offensive philosophy is &quot;run, run, run.&quot;
The Regents enjoy this exciting brand of baseball that causes fits for
their opponents. &quot;We aren't always the biggest or the strongest team
on the field, but you better be prepared for us&quot; he is proud of saying
to anyone who will listen. Langston learned his game from his father in
high school, and baseball coaching legends Danny Litwiler(FSU), Duffy Bass
and &quot;Itchy&quot; Jones who he either played for or coached with. A
strong believer in the NCAA III philosophy of &quot;participation for all&quot;
Langston tailors his program to be a quality experience for all of his
athletes </P>

<P>The Regents enter the second year under Coach Mike Duenser with several
new faces and a good compliment of returners. Excitement abounds with the
new height - 7'1 &quot; Adnan Krupalija, and 6'6&quot; transfer Jason Warner,
who should become an instant force in the lineup. The Regents open in Wartburg,
Iowa, host the Rockford Classic, and also play in the Elmhurst Holiday
tourney. NIIC competition begins January 6 at Conqordia-River Forest. </P>

<P>W. Michael Duenser begins his second year as the Head Coach of the Regents
and has already served notice on the area and the conference that the Regents
will improve, by bringing his first recruiting class in that includes the
college's first seven-footer. </P>

<P>Duenser's roots are in eastern Iowa, where he coached at Clarke College
and the University of Dubuque before joining the Regents. His enthusiasm
and aggressiveness reflect a level of energy that is contagious and will
bring the Regents to a very competitive level. </P>

<h2><a name="The Program">The Program</a></h2>

<p>With the departure of four All-NIIC players and the loss of 6
other players, Coach Secerovic is looking for others on the team
to step up and take control of the situation. Senior Ron Collins
(Cincinnati, OH), a 1996 All-NIIC player, and Junior Peter
Judkins (St. Louis, MO) are two of the players that Secerovic is
counting on to carry the 1996 Regents. The return of Senior
Biniam Girmay (Dewitt, MI) should lead the defense and try to
keep the goalie from being very busy. Secerovic is also looking
for someone to take over in goal since the loss of both of last
year's goalies to other schools. </p>

<h2><a name="Rasim Secerovic, Head Coach">Rasim Secerovic, Head Coach</a></h2>

<p>The 1996 edition of the Regent soccer team is a new look one.
With new Head Coach Rasim Secerovic and the loss of all four of
the Regents All-NIIC team members, the 1996 season looks to be
one of many surprises. Coach Secerovic brings many years of
professional soccer experience with him from Bosnia, where he
played and coached for the majority of his life until he defected
with his junior national basketball team to the United States in
the early 1990's. Since that time, Secerovic has been an
assistant basketball coach for the Regents. </p>

Anticipation lingers for the 1997 season. </p>

<P>Rockford College Swimming has a long tradition of excellence in the
water and has produced 22 All-Americans. These include both men and women,
swimmers and divers, national record holders and national champions. Rockford
College will provide you an opportunity to excel in the sport of swimming
while earning an education. It is an opportunity for you be a big fish
in a small pond . If you love the sport of swimming and want to receive
a excellent education, take a good look at Rockford College! </P>

<H2><A NAME="David Mcdevitt, Head Coach"></A>David McDevitt, Head Coach</H2>

<P>The Regents swimmers are coached by David McDevitt, an American Swimming
Coaches Association Level 5 coach, its highest ranking. Coach McDevitt
took over the program from Coach Dick Bromley after 33 years at the helm.
Coach McDevitt comes to Rockford College with over 15 years of experience
in coaching swimming. He has coached every level of swimmer from the swimmers
just learning to swim, to elite athletes who have finished as high as third
in the nation and have been ranked internationally. Coach McDevitt hopes
to build the program back to its glory years of the late 70's and early
80's. Coach McDevitt is searching for those individuals who love the sport
of swimming and would like to continue it while getting an excellent education.
His philosophy has always been to strive to improve your times while having
fun. He expects his swimmers to work hard in the pool and in the classroom.
&quot;I believe that every student -athlete should strive for excellence.
As a coach, that is what I will try to give to you and all I ask is that
you return the same,&quot; he states.<BR>

<P>After a string of 4 consecutive NIIC Championships, the netters have
struggled with inconsistency on the roster and for a coach. Three different
coaches have led the Regents in the past four years, leading to a lack
of recruiting. With Coach Price and four returning players, the Regents
are hopeful of regaining the level of play they had enoyed a few years
ago. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H2><A NAME="Steve Price, Head Coach"></A>Steve Price, Head Coach</H2>

<P>Steve Price comes to the Regents in 1996 and takes on the challenge
of returning the Regents to the level at which they won the NIIC tournament
in 1993. Price played tennis at Illinois State University from 1965-69,
serving as team captain in both 1968 and 1969. He has given lessons in
the area for many years and won the 1995 Carter-Gates Coke Classic Open
Tennis Tournament in the 45 &amp; Over Singles and Doubles Championship.
He is also currently ranked 4th in the Northern Illinois Tennis Association
Men's 45 &amp; Over division. With the amount of experience and time to
recruit, Price is looking forward to staying with the program for some
time and returning it to past levels. </P>

<P>Rockford College volleyball program is in the rebuilding stage and the
new coach is looking for talented players with which to rebuild the program.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="Joan Mosher, Head Coach"></A>Joan Mosher, Head Coach</H2>

<P>Joan Mosher is looking forward to revitalizing the volleyball program
at Rockford College. &quot;We have a good core of the team returning for
the 96 season on which to build,&quot; she states. &quot;With a few new
players, we can expect much success this season. I bring with me many years
of volleyball experience, both coaching and playing.&quot; After playing
high school ball at Rockford East, she attended Rockford College for undergraduate
work on a Merit Scholarship (which combined academics and athletics), lettering
in volleyball, basketball, field hockey, and softball. In 1986, Coach Mosher
was honored by being inducted into the college's Athletic Hall of Fame.
&quot;Volleyball has been a love of my life,&quot; she explains. &quot;Not
only did it help in furthering my education on and off the court but it
has turned into a family affair. My sister and I have played together on
teams for almost 20 years. Now my two daughters are carrying on the tradition
by participating in club volleyball in the Great Lakes Region and on their
school teams. Rockford College has also been a huge influence in my life.
It provided me with an excellent education, introduced me to a lot of great
people, including my husband, and left me with great pride in my self and
my school. That pride is what I hope to instill in the players on my team.&quot;

<h2>The Program</h2>

<p>Cheerleading and poms at Rockford College seems to evolve as
the years go. We have now moved to a coed Cheer squad and a dance line.
These are picked at the Try-outs in the Spring and Fall. </p>

<h2>The Coach</h2>

<p>Gayle Strang, advisor-coach has been at the college 28
years. This year's squad has been led by Mike Smith, a former male-
cheerleader who has been able to help teach lifts and holds. It's 
been exciting to see the changes. <br>

<h3>For immediate release</h3>
<p>August 19, 1996</p>
<h3>Rockford College Music Academy students to perform at Jane Addams Memorial Park dedication</h3>

<p>Students from the Rockford College Music Academy will provide the music for a dedication 
ceremony of the new Jane Addams Memorial Park at 11 a.m. Monday, August 26, at Navy Pier in 
Chicago. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, five female U.S. senators, members of the 
Democratic Womens Caucus, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, poet Gwendolyn Brooks and Rockford 
College President William A. Shields are invited to attend. </p>
<p>Jane Addams, a Freeport native, is one of the most distinguished Rockford College alumni, 
graduating from the college in 1882. Founding Hull House on Chicagos near west side in 1889,
 she devoted her life and her efforts towards the improvement of the lives of immigrants and 
youth. For her efforts, she received the Nobel Peace Prize and the worlds admiration. </p>
<p>The Hull House School of Music, the first community school of music in the United States,
 is the model upon which the Rockford College Music Academy was founded. Approximately 21 
Music Academy Suzuki violin students aged eight to 18 will perform a classical repertoire 
during the dedication ceremony. Shields will represent Addams alma mater at the event. </p>
<p>Jane Addams Memorial Park features "A Touch of Jane Addams," the first monument to a 
Chicago woman. The sculpture, commissioned by the B.F. Ferguson Fund of The Art Institute of 
Chicago, was created by internationally renowned artist Louise Bourgeois. The monument, which 
consists of six granite sculptures of carved hands atop massive bases, is located in a peaceful garden setting overlooking Lake Michigan at Ohio Street.</p>
<p>The Jane Addams Memorial is a collaborative effort of the Chicago Department of Cultural 
Affairs, the Chicago Park District, the Chicago Department of Transportation, the B.F. 
Ferguson Monument Fund of The Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Pier & Exposition 
Authority, the Illinois Department of Conservation, the Chicago Department of Environment, 
the Chicago Department of Planning and Development, the Jane Addams Sculpture Committee, 
the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum, Friends of the Parks, the Lake Michigan Federation, 
Openlands, the Streeterville Organization of Active Residents, and the Lincoln Park Steering 
Committee. </p>

<p>About the Jane Addams Memorial:</p>
<ul>
<li>"A Touch of Jane Addams," a tribute to the Nobel Peace Prize winner, social reformer, 
and Rockford College graduate, was commissioned by the B.F. Ferguson Fund of The Art Institute 
of Chicago, and curated by Mary Jane Jacobs.
<li>Louise Bourgeois created six individual granite sculptures featuring hands of different 
ages in different expressions: the vulnerable child, the able adult, comforting hands, helping 
hands, hands strong in solidarity. The artist arrived at the image of the hand to give visual 
form to the ideals Jane Addams stands for and to express her relationship to the common person.
<li>Set in ornamental prairie grasses native to Jane Addams local origins, the Jane Addams 
Memorial is one of seven parklands honoring a woman. Others are Jane Addams Playlot, Kathy 
Osterman Beach, Madame Curie, Emma Lazarus, Lillian Piotrowski and Almira Simmons parks.
<li>Jane Addams Memorial Park is located at 600 N. Lake Shore Drive and 600 E. Ohio Street, 
linking Lincoln Park, Milton Lee Olive Park, and Navy Pier Park along the Lakefront.
<li>Rockford College is a four-year independent coeducational institution offering a broad 
range of undergraduate degrees in traditional liberal arts and professional fields plus 
masters degrees in teaching and in business administration. Rockford College serves 
approximately 1,500 full- and part-time students. Chartered in 1847, Rockford College is 
celebrating its Sesquicentennial in 1997.

<h3>For immediate release</h3>
<p>August 28, 1996</p>
<h3>Rockford College students volunteer in their new community</h3>

p>For the third year in a row, Rockford College students, faculty and staff will pour into 
the Rockford community Friday, August 29, working at 10 sites for six local agencies in the 
annual "Rockford Plunge." Approximately 150 entering Rockford College students, returning 
students, faculty and staff will volunteer from 9:30 a.m. until 1:30 a.m.</p>
<p>"The Plunge is a way to introduce the students to the community and the community to our 
students," said Steve Marcon, Coordinator of Community Service. "A primary objective of our 
college is strengthening community ties.</p>
<p>"The end result of the Plunge is a win-win situation," he continued. "The recipient is a 
winner. The agency is a winner, and the volunteer is a winner."</p>
<p>The Plunge is an annual event that is part of "Starting Fresh," a week-long orientation 
program for new Rockford College students. Founded to promote an ethic of volunteerism in 
the Rockford College community, the Plunge gives new students a chance to meet faculty and 
other Rockford College students as they get to know the city of Rockford through community 
service.</p>
<p>This year, the students will serve in a variety of ways: they will clean up Aldeen Park 
(located directly behind the Rockford College campus), lay pavement bricks in a parking lot,  
set up for the "On The Waterfront" festival, and paint the interior of four houses on the west 
side of town, among other projects. </p>
<p>"If students learn the value of community service, it will help bring communities 
together," Marcon said. "College students are the next generation to help unite divided 
communities."</p>
<p>The Plunge will "kick-off" at 6:30 p.m. Thursday, August 29, in Grace Roper Lounge. 
Students will meet representatives from the agencies they are volunteering for. Rockford 
Park District, VIGOR, MELD, Rockford Neighborhood Redevelopment, Zion Development Corporation, 
and the Waterfront Committee will provide the Plunge sites for 1996. </p>

Theater series for the 1996-97 academic year.</p>
<p>The Star-Spangled Girl is a fast-moving, hilarious comedy that deals with

is entirely student-produced, and admission is only three cents.</p>
<p>Rockford College sophomore David Rodriguez, a performing arts major, will direct the 
play. Last year, Rodriguez wrote and directed The Specter series as part of the 
Three-Penny Theater.</p>
<p>Senior performing arts major Ryan Landerholm of Rockford is Andy Hobart, and senior 
performing arts major Carlos Landeros from Chicago is Norman Cornell. Kira Dolen is the 
"star-spangled girl," Sophie Rauschmeyer.   </p>
<p>The Star-Spangled Girl runs at 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday, August 30 and 31, in 
Cheek Theatre in Clark Arts Center. General admission for the play is three cents.</p>
<p>Rockford College is a four-year independent coeducational institution offering a 
broad range of undergraduate degrees in traditional liberal arts and professional 
fields plus masters degrees in teaching and in business administration. Rockford 
College serves approximately 1,500 full- and part-time students. Chartered in 1847, 
Rockford College is celebrating its Sesquicentennial in 1997.</p>

Dole believes in, &quot;more opportunities, smaller government, and stronger
and safer families.&quot; As U.S. senator for three decades, Bob Dole has
fought to protect America from forty years of Democratic oppression.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Bob Dole believes in economic freedom for American Families.
In relief from overly burdensome tax rates. In a balance national budget,
and in a debt free America. &quot;A Dole-Kemp administration will stop
reckess deficit spending once and for all for the good of this generation
and all generations which follow.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><IMG SRC="dolepic.gif" HEIGHT=150 WIDTH=150 ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=+1>The
Dole-Kemp team has a plan for restoring the economic growth rate from is
current low of 2.4 percent to 3.5 percent by the end of 1997. That will
put the American economy back where it was four years ago when Bill Clinton
sent it into a nose dive. Restoring the economic growth rate will set America
up for prosperity which will create jobs, low interest rates, and opportunity
for all Americans.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;My campaign is about telling the truth. It is about
what is right. It is about electing a president who is not attracted to
the glories of the office, but to its difficulties.&quot;</FONT></P>

<h1>Rockford College<BR>
DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE</h1>
<hr> 
<h2> Department Information</h2>


 Computers and computer technology are changing the world as we know it, and the rapid development of this field
shows no signs of slowing. Hardware technology is expanding in power and speed while contracting in size and price.Computer scientists must harness this technology and channel its use for the good of mankind.

Early computer scientists were trained merely as programmers.  With the nineties, however, a new generation of
computer scientists has emerged. Today, these individuals are educated not only in the mechanics and technology
of the computer and its programs but also in the possibilities of applying computers to solving new and more
challenging problems. 

The computer scientist of today and tomorrow is a problem-solver who has a broad educational background in
human needs and drives. The computer scientist understands the various possibilities for applications of computers
to life, and frequently acts as a communication link between man and machine. To help students gain that
understanding, we arrange and supervise internships with a wide variety of businesses and organizations.

The Department of Computer Science offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, with a choice of
Management Information Systems or Mathematics/Computer Science options under either degree.

mission of the Rockford College Republican Club is to provide students,
faculty, and staff a positive forum in which conservative beliefs and views
are not condemned as &quot;not politically correct.&quot;  As part of this
mission, the Republican Club offers its members the ability to network with
other conservatives, participate in conservative events, meet and develop
interpersonal relationships with republican politicians, and participate
in government on the local, state, and national levels.

<p>
When you file both the Financial Aid Application and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), your eligibility for the following three grant and three loan programs will be considered.
</p>
<A Name="Pell"></a>
<p>
Federal Pell Grant - A Federal Pell Grant is an award to help first-time undergraduates pay for their education after high school. A first-time undergraduate is one who has not earned a bachelors degree. To determine if you are eligible, the U.S. Department of Education uses a standard formula, passed into law by Congress, to evaluate the information you report on your FAFSA.
</p>
<A Name="FSEOG"></a>

<p>
Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) - The FSEOG is an award to help first-time undergraduates. The amount you may receive depends on your financial need, amount of other aid you receive, and the availability of funds at Rockford College.
</p>
<A Name="Perkins"></a>
<p>
Federal Perkins Loan - A Federal Perkins Loan is a low-interest (five percent) loan for first-time undergraduates. The amount you may receive depends on your financial need, amount of other aid you received, and the availability of funds at Rockford College. You must repay this loan.
</p>
<A Name="Staff"></a>
<p>
Federal Stafford Loan - Federal Stafford Loans are low-interest loans made to both undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at least half-time. Students ineligible for (or ineligible for the full amount of) Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan have an option to borrow an Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan.
</p>
<A Name="Sub"></a>
<p>
Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans are based on financial need. The federal government pays the interest during in-school and deferment periods.
</p>
<A Name="Un"></a>
<p>
Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans are based on financial need. The student is responsible for paying the interest from the date the funds are disbursed.
</p>

<H2 align =center><A Name="ILL">Illinois State Financial Aid</a></h2>
<A Name="MAP"></a>
<p>
Illinois State Monetary Award Program (MAP) - The MAP award is a grant available from the State of Illinois for Illinois residents who are first-time undergraduates. The Illinois Student Assistant Commission (ISAC) developed a formula to evaluate the information reported on your FAFSA. The maximum award is applied toward tuition and mandatory fees.
</p>
<H2 align =center><A Name="Other">Other Types of Aid</a></h2>
<A Name="Emp"></a>
<p>
Employment - Each year approximately 200 students are employed part-time on campus through the Federal Work-Study Program and non-work-study jobs. The Career Planning & 
</p>
<p>
Placement Office can help you arrange part-time work on campus. They also keep listings of part-time jobs off campus.
</p>
<A Name="Sch"></a>
<p>
Scholarships - Many individuals, organizations, and corporations provide scholarship assistance for students at Rockford College. Preference for endowed scholarships is given to students who have completed at least one year of study at Rockford College. Scholarships may be obtained from industry, service groups, professional organizations, foundations, churches, state government, and academic departments. Application procedures and eligibility requirements are determined by the donor.
</p>

<p></P>
<h2><a Name="Ver">Verification</a></h2>

<p>Verification: The Higher Education Act of 1965 mandates that some applicants for federal student aid are selected for a process called Verification.</p>

<p>Verification is a procedure where a school is required to check the information a student reported on the FAFSA. Schools must verify students selected for verification by the federal central processing system, following procedures established by federal regulations. The contractor prints an asterisk next to the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) on the Student Aid Report (SAR) to identify students selected for verification.</p>

<p>If you are selected for verification, you will be required to submit a signed copy of yours and your parents, if applicable, 1995 Federal Income Tax return, including all schedules and W2 forms, and to complete a verification worksheet.</p>

<p>Federal Income Tax returns, including all schedules and W2 forms, will be required for all Special Condition/Re-evaluation requests.</p>

<p>Other documents may be requested by the Financial Aid Office, on an individual basis.</p>

<p>Complete all forms accurately. Write legibly, use black ink. Forms completed or signed in pencil or lacking the necessary signature(s) will be returned.</p>

<p>When completing the forms:</p>

<ul>
<LI>Read the instructions carefully.

<LI>Sign and date both applications. If applicable, your parent(s) or spouse should also sign in the appropriate places.

<LI>Enter 001748 Rockford College, Rockford, IL at section H #92 on the FAFSA.</p>

<LI>If you have questions or doubts about any of your answers on either application, contact the Financial Aid Office.
</ul>
<p>Students applying for financial aid for the summer 1997 session are advised to contact the Financial Aid Office between March 1, 1997 and April 1, 1997.</p>

<PRE>
  The effects of oil spills on ecology, deforestation of tropical rain 
forests, biological effects of the hole in the ozone layer, and rapid 
advances in medicine and pharmacology consistently make headlines and are 
some of the concerns of biologists in today's world. As human understanding
of the self and the surrounding world has expanded, we have begun to 
understand the importance of the organisms that inhabit the world in which 
we endeavor to survive.
  Work in the various areas that make up biology (environment, agriculture,
forestry, wildlife management, aquatic biology, medicine, pharmacology, 
molecular biology, etc.) requires highly educated and curious individuals
with backgrounds in the liberal arts, business, chemistry, physics, 
mathematics, and the life sciences. 
  Rockford College biology majors have the opportunity to develop an area of
interest from a variety of disciplines and one day may make significant
contributions to their fields. 
  The Department of Biology offers both the Bachelor of Arts and
Bachelor of Science degrees in biology.

<H3>Career opportunities</H3>

<PRE>
  Biology graduates have numerous career opportunities in government, such
as wildlife management and environmental research. Private industry uses
trained biologists in areas such as sales, management, research, and
writing. Many additional possibilities exist in the areas of medicine,
medical science, and allied health.  Many of our graduates have chosen 
to continue their education in biology at the graduate school level.

<H3>Overview</H3>

<PRE>

The minor concentration in British studies enables students to give 
distinctive focus to study at Regent's College and may be used to 
complement a variety of major programs. The minor includes a core of 
required courses, usually taken before and during a term in London, 
and elective courses which may be completed after students return to 
Rockford College.  

The minor is administered by the English Department, and the department 
chair must approve students' plans of study for the minor in British 
Studies.  Electives for the minor must be chosen from more than one 
department.  No courses which count toward students' majors may count 
as elective courses toward the British Studies minor. 

<A NAME="require"><A/>
<STRONG>Minor requirements -- 20 hours</STRONG>

Eng 201 Survey of English Literature I 3 hours
Eng 202 Survey of English Literature II     3 hours

Two of the following:

Hist 210 History of England Since the Conquest   4 hours
Hist 300 Civilization of London (Regent's College only)    4 hours
Hist 324 Tudor-Stuart England     4 hours

Elective courses: At least six hours of 200- or 300-level course-work 
which focuses substantially on Britain, chosen with approval of the chair 
of the English Department.

Special thanks to Michael E. Grost, who put a virtual encyclopedia of 
classic Mystery Detective fiction on the Web.  Many of the authors listed 
below are found on the Web primarily though his entries, which I have 
marked as "@ MGrost". Many others are members of Mystery Writers of America
which, oddly enough, does not yet have a Home Page.

     My father, Samuel H. Post, published Robert Bloch in paperback.  The 
     last time we spoke, I pointed out that he had a cat hair on his coat, 
     and he complimented my attention to detail and then went into a long, 
     gentle conversation about his daughter and her love of animals.  Bob 
     Bloch was a prince among men, and a king among authors.

     an underrated genius among authors, critics, and editors, who suffered 
     from being too educated, too sophisticated, too stylish, and too 
     gentle for a predatory SF market with growing anti-literary bias.
     Born on Shakespeare's birthday (23 Apr 1923), fought with the U.S. 
     Marines and the Israeli Army, and Executive Editor of The Magazine of 
     Fantasy and Science Fiction.  As a Mystery author, he won the 
     prestigious Edgar Award.
     My father, Samuel H. Post, published him in paperback, and I 
     treasured my meetings with him.  I'm glad my wife and son had a chance 
     to meet him, at which time he gave my son a mystical blessing in 
     fluent but oddly archaic Hebrew.  Go thou, find his works, and read 
     them!

     three Brill/Maxwell books are police procedural mysteries as much
     as they're SF, and the two vampire books (which were handled at Tor not by
     the SF editor but by Michael Seidman, the mystery editor) and the short story
     "Existential Man" straddle the SF/Fantasy-Mystery line, too.  And Lee 
     is a member of Mystery Writers of America.

<H1><STRONG>How to Solve Tough Technical Problems</STRONG></H1>
</CENTER>

<BR><BR>
<P><STRONG>What Can We Do For You?</STRONG>  Our 
<A HREF="../VTI/team.html">scientists and engineers</A> solve your technical
problems by finding other technologist any where in the world that are 
<A HREF="../VTI/unique.html">uniquely capable</A> of solving your problem.  The 
<A HREF="../VTI/team.html">linguistic and technical diversity</A> 
of our technologists enable us to speak to other uniquely 
qualified technologists in their native language using the proper 
technical words of the specific technology.  This form of interaction 
allows an immediate <A HREF="../VTI/unique.html">exchange of technical knowledge</A>. 
 This professional courtesy is practised by all members of the various 
 <A HREF="../VTI/team.html">scientific and engineering disciplines</A>.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Who Is Venture Technology (VTI)?</STRONG> Over the last 30 years VTI has developed 
<A HREF="../VTI/caveat.html">consulting relationships</A> with 85 scientists and engineers.  These 
technologists are mainly employed by <A HREF="../VTI/caveat.html">national laboratories and 
universities</A>.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>How Do We Do It?</STRONG>  The <A HREF="../VTI/client.html">
potential client</A> Emails, mails or faxes VTI's or the 
client's <A HREF="../VTI/nda.html">nondisclosure agreement</A> to 
<A HREF="../VTI/unique.html">VTI's coordinator</A>.  The coordinator 
assigns the task to one or more of VTI's existing technologists and has 
them sign the nondisclosure agreement.   They discuss the <A HREF="../VTI/unique.html">nature of the 
problem</A> with the <A HREF="../VTI/client.html">potential client</A>.  They negotiate a statement of work and 
the <A HREF="../VTI/unique.html">client's coordinator and task monitor and 
VTI's coordinator and task 
manager</A> sign the statement of work.  VTI's existing technologist finds 
other technologist if required.  After making contact and validating the 
technologist suitability, the VTI existing technologist together with the 
validated technologist <A HREF="../VTI/team.html">solve the problem</A>.  The detail reports with costs 
to date are sent to the client periodically, a final invoice is sent to 
the client at the end of the task.  VTI can only accept a problem solving 
task on a best efforts basis, sometimes the problem may not be solvable.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Why Do We Do It?</STRONG> Solving difficult problems is gratifying, however, some 
<A HREF="../VTI/client.html">classes of clients</A> make it more enjoyable than others.  It supplements 
academic and research salaries.  New skills may prove useful to the 
technologists employer, without violating the client's nondisclosure 
agreement.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>How Much?</STRONG> Most of the scientists and engineers with <A HREF="../VTI/remun.html">advanced degrees</A> and 
decades of experience are <A HREF="../VTI/remun.html">paid about $100/hr</A>.

<H2>The Services</H2>
</CENTER>

<BR><BR><BR>
<LI><STRONG>Solve Technical Problems.</STRONG>  VTI's network of scientists and engineers can 
solve problems that you may be having with your new or existing products 
or processes.  The solution may consist of theoretical, analytical, system 
design, detail design, feasibility demonstration or prototype fabrication 
and testing. Sometimes groups of technologists together can 
conceive of solutions to a problem that a lesser group could not.  Such a 
process is sometimes referred to as "revolutionary-system-engineering".  Most 
companies are able to perform evolutionary-system-engineering, 
sometimes called "step-by-step development".  VTI can assist in solving specific problems 
that arise in disciplines that are not available to clients own 
technologists.  VTI technologists are skilled in capturing the 
intellectual property rights that may issue from such solutions.</LI>  
<BR><BR>
<LI><STRONG>Invent New Products or Processes.</STRONG>  In many instances 
VTI's technologists 
can invent new or improved products or processes that maintain a company's 
intellectual-property-monopoly position in the market. </LI> 
<BR><BR>
<LI><STRONG>Invent Around or Beyond Competitor's Patents.</STRONG> They can invent 
improvements based upon new technology not known at the time the previous 
patents were filed.  </LI>  
<BR><BR>
<LI><STRONG>Find Patent Prior Art.</STRONG>  They can find prior art that can not be found by 
conventional searches and investigations by using technologists that find 
and consult with other technologists that may have special knowledge.  </LI>
<BR><BR>
<LI><STRONG>Evaluates Patents.</STRONG> They can provide independent technical evaluations of 
patents and/or suites of patents by technologists skilled in the art of 
the particular science or engineering discipline. </LI>

<P>Hello, my name is Andrew Carmichael Post.  Here is what I look like now

some.  Get it?]</P>

<H2>QUIZ</H2>

<P>What four days of the week begin with the letter T?  Answer: Tuesday, 
Thursday, today and tomorrow.

<BR>
<HR>
<BR>

<P>I am in third grade at Loma Alta School.  Mrs McCarthy is my teacher, 
she has a masters degree in teaching gifted children, which is good for me 
because I have got into the GATE program (California's Gifted and Talented 
Education program for elementary and secondary schools).  
Our school gets special science education projects from Caltech, also, so 
it is very lucky.

</CENTER>
<BR>

<P>I was born in Pasadena, California in 1989, so that makes me an 
American Citizen.  But my Mom is Scottish, so I am too.  I go to Edinburgh every 
summer to visit my Granma Hylda.  Last summer I visited the old 
battlegrounds at Stirling and Bannockburn where William Wallace and Robert 
the Bruce defeated the English armies.

  <H3><BR> It is unlikely that they ever met in real life. 
   Although both were Scottish patriots who 
fought the English during the 18-year War of Independence (1296 - 1314), 
they supported different political factions.  Wallace wanted to reinstate 
John Baliol as King of Scotland, and Bruce wanted his father to be King.
In this mural, Wallace and Bruce stand together on the walls of the 
Scottish Museum of Antiquities, Edinburgh, Scotland. 
If you ever visit Scotland you must see this wonderful little museum just 
down the hill a couple of blocks from Princes Street and Waverly Station.

<CENTER>The Recapture of Edinburgh Castle from the English in 1313</CENTER></H2>

<BR><P>"While <STRONG>Robert the Bruce</STRONG> was gradually getting possession of the 
country, and driving out the English, Edinburgh, the principal town in Scotland, 
with its strong castle, remained in possession of the invaders.  Sir 
Thomas Randolph was extremely desirous to gain this important place; but, 
as you well know, the castle is situated on a very steep and lofty rock, so 
that it is difficult or almost impossible even to get up to the foot of 
the walls, much more to climb over them.<BR>
So while Randolph was considering what was to be done, there came to him a 
Scottish gentleman, named Francis, who had joined <EM>Bruce</EM>'s standard, and 
asked to speak to him in private.  He then told Randolph that in his youth 
he had lived in the castle of Edinburgh, and that his father had then been 
keeper of the fortress.  It happened at that time that Francis had been 
much in love with a lady, who lived in the part of the town beneath the 
castle, which is called the Grassmarket.  Now, as he could not get out of 
the castle by day to see his mistress, he had practised a way by night of 
clambering down the castle rock on the south side, and returning at his 
pleasure; when he got to the foot of the wall, he made use of a ladder to 
get over it, as it was not very high at that point, those who built it 
having trusted to the steepness of the crag; and for the same reason, no 
watch was placed there.  Francis had come and gone so frequently in this 
dangerous manner, that, though it was so long ago, he told Randolph he 
knew the road so well that he would undertake to guide a small party of 
men by night to the bottom of his wall; and as they might bring ladders 
with them, there would be no difficulty in scaling it.  The great risk was 
that of being discovered by the watchmen while in the act of ascending the 
cliff, in which case every man of them would perish.<BR>
Nevertheless, Randolph did not hesitate to attempt the adventure.  He took 
with him only thirty men and came one dark night to the foot of the rock, 
which they began to ascend under the guidance of Francis.  The men were 
obliged to follow in a line a path fitter for a cat than a man.  When they 
were far up the crag, near the foundation of the wall, one of the soldiers 
of the castle, willing to startle his comrades, suddenly threw a stone from 
the wall and cried out  "Aha, I see you well."  The stone came thundering 
down past the heads of Randolph and his men, who naturally thought 
themselves discovered.  If they had stirred, or made the slightest noise, 
they would have been entirely destroyed; for the soldiers above might have 
killed every one of them, merely by rolling down stones... But the English 
passed on without further examination.<BR>
Then Randolph and his men got up, and came in haste to the foot of the 
wall.  They planted the ladder which they had brought, and Francis mounted first to 
show them the way; Sir Andrew Grey, a brave knight, followed him, and 
Randolph himself was the third man to get over.  Then the rest followed.  
When once they were within the walls, there was not much to be do, for the 
garrison were asleep and unarmed, excepting the watch, who were speedily 
destroyed.  Thus was Edinburgh Castle taken in March 1313."

<H2><I>"The Scottish people have always been independent, individualistic, 
awkward if you like- and have long memories.  Also their land is 
sufficiently dramatic in itself.  There is scarcely a yard of the country 
without its story to tell, of heroism and treachery, of warfare or worship, 
of flourish or folly or heartbreak - for the Scots never did anything by 
half.  This, the most ancient kingdom in Christendom, has more castles, 
abbeys, battlefields, graveyards, monuments, stone-circles, inscribed 
stones, and relics of every kind - and eyesores too, admittedly - than any 
other land of its size, in Highlands and Lowlands, mainland and islands."</I>

<H2><CENTER>The Brahan Seer</CENTER></H2>
<BR>
Kenneth the Sallow (Coinneach Odhar) was born 300 years ago in the 
Highlands of Scotland.  He was gifted with "the sight" - an ability to see 
visions that came unbidden day or night.  His prophecies were so impressive that he is still 
quoted to this day.  
<BR>
<H3><CENTER>These came true</CENTER></H3>
Some of his prophetic visions that have actually come 
true in the years following his death include:
<BR>1.  The battle of Culloden (1745), which he uttered at the site, and his 
words were recorded.  "This bleak moor, ere many generations have passed, 
shall be stained with the best blood in Scotland.  Glad I am that I will 
not see that day."
<BR>2.  The joining of the lochs in the Great Glen = accomplished by the 
construction of the Caledonian Canal in the 19th Century.
<BR>3.  Pointing to a field far from seashore, loch or river, he said that a 
ship would anchor there one day.  The canal did not come near the spot, so 
folk decided this prophecy must be incorrect until one day in the 1930s 
an  <I>Airship</I> did indeed tie up there.
<BR>4.  The most impressive of his prophecies concerned the doom of the 
Mackenzies of Seaforth.  You can read about this in the book "Scottish Lore 
and Folklore" by Ronald Douglas.
<BR>

<H3><CENTER>We are still waiting for these</CENTER></H3>
 
 <BR>1.  "One day a black rain will fall on the City of Aberdeen".  Optimists 
 hope this refers to the North Sea Oil Fields and the big business it has 
 brought to Aberdeen.  Pessimists fear it predicts Nuclear War.
 <BR>2.  "Rome was; London is; Edinburgh will be."  This seems to imply that 
 the Scottish Capital City will someday become more important than the 
 British Capital of London.
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H3><CENTER>Thomas of Ercildoune</CENTER></H3>
<BR>
He was also known as Thomas the Rhymer, born 700 years ago in the 
Lowlands of Scotland.  He recorded his prophecies in rhymes, as did 
Nostradamus centuries later.  <BR>One of his rhymes was
<BR>"Tide, tide, whate'er betide,
<BR>There'll aye be Haigs at Bemersyde"
<BR>
There was an important family called Haig at the place called Bemersyde, on the 
border with England for many centuries until the line died out in the 19th 
Century.  It seemed as though Thomas had been wrong, until the nation 
presented Bemersyde to Earl Haig (World War I leader) who was related to 
the original Haigs.

The Fian Warriors
</CENTER>
<BR>

<P>There is an ancient legend that an army of sleeping warriors is waiting 
in a cave in the Eildon Hills until the day comes when all Gaeldom shall 
rise against its oppressors.  Sir Walter Scott related the following story 
in his "Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft".
<BR>
"The story has often been told, of a daring horse-jockey having sold a 
black horse to a man of venerable and antique appearance, who appointed 
the remarkable hillock upon Eildon hills, called the Lucken-hare, as the 
place where at twelve o'clock at night, he should receive the price.  He 
came, his money was paid in ancient coin, and he was invited by his 
customer to view his residence.  The trader in horses followed his guide 
in the deepest astonishment through several long ranges of stalls, in each 
of which a horse stood motionless, while an armed warrior lay equally 
still at the charger's feet.  <BR>
"All these men", said the wizard in a whisper,"will awaken at the battle 
of Sheriffmuir."  At the extremity of this extraordinary depot hung a 
sword and a horn, which the prophet pointed out to the horse-dealer as 
containing means of dissolving the spell.  The man in confusion took the 
horn and attempted to wind it.  The horses instantly started in their 
stalls, stamped, and shook their bridles, the men arose and clashed their 
armour, and the mortal, terrified by the tumult he had excited, dropped the 
horn from his hand.  A voice like that of a giant, louder even than the 
tumult around, pronounced these words:
<BR>'Woe to the coward that ever he was born<BR>
That did not draw the sword before he blew the horn.'
<BR>A whirlwind expelled the horse-dealer from the cavern, the entrance to 
which he could never find again."

Scott says that the wizard was Thomas the Rhymer.

<H2><CENTER>Folklore and Magic</CENTER></H2>
<H3><CENTER>The Story of Major Weir, 1670</CENTER></H3>
<BR>

<P> Major Weir was the last man executed for witchcraft in Scotland in 
1670.  He lived with his unmarried sister, Grizel, in the West Bow - a 
Z-shaped street near Edinburgh Castle, "composed of tall antique houses, 
with numerous dovecot-like gables projecting over the footway, full of old 
inscriptions and sculpturings, presenting at every few steps some darkest 
lateral profundity, into which the imagination wanders without hindrance or 
exhaustion ..." wrote Robert Chambers in <I>Traditions of Edinburgh</I>.
<BR>

<P>Major Weir was an active member of a strict Protestant sect, and was 
frequently seen at prayer meetings.  He officiated at such meetings - but 
always leaning on his black walking staff.  <EM>Robert Chambers</EM> described his 
end as follows:
<BR>

<P>"After a life characterized by all the graces of devotion, but polluted 
in secret by crimes of the most revolting nature, and which little needed 
the addition of wizardry to excite the horror of living men, Major Weir 
fell into severe sickness, which affected his mind so much, that he made 
open voluntary confession of all his wickedness.  The tale was at first so 
incredible, that the provost, Sir Andrew Ramsay, refused for some time to 
take him into custody.  At length himself, his sister (partner in his 
crimes), and his staff, were secured by the magistrates, together with 
certain sums of money, which were found wrapped in rags in different parts 
of the house.  One of these pieces of rag being thrown into the fire by a 
bailie who had taken the whole in charge, flew up the chimney, and made an 
explosion like a cannon.  <BR>

<P>While the wretched man lay in prison, he made no 
scruple to disclose the particulars of his guilt, but refused to address 
himself to the Almighty for pardon.  To every request that he would pray, 
he answered in screams, "Torment me no more - I am tormented enough 
already!"  Even the offer of a Presbyterian clergyman, instead of the 
established Episcopal minister of the city, had no effect on him.  <BR>

<P>He was 
tried April 9, 1670 and being found guilty, was sentenced to be strangled 
and burnt between Edinburgh and Leith.  His sister, who was tried at the 
same time, was sentenced to be hanged in the Grassmarket. When the rope 
was around his neck, to prepare him for the fire, he was bid to say, "Lord, 
be merciful to me!" but he answered, as before, "let me alone - I will 
not - I have lived as a beast, and I must die as a beast!"  <BR>

<P>After he had dropped lifeless in the flames, his stick was also cast 
into the fire; and 'whatever incantation was in it,' says a contemporary 
writer, 'the persons present own that it gave rare turnings, and was long 
a-burning, as also himself.'"

<BR>

<P>I lived in the West Bow for several years. To this day, the residents remember 
the tales of this wizard Major Weir, and can point to the door of his 
former residence.  After his death, neighbours claimed that his ghost was 
seen on many occasions and mysterious noises and lights came at dead of 
night from his now-unoccupied lodgings.  My first publication in the USA 
was a short story based on his legend, called "Major Weir's bookcase", it 
appeared in the magazine <I>Amazing Stories</I> in 1989.

<P>Look at the examples shown above: a six-year-old boy 
and an eight-year-old girl have been age progressed to eighteen by a digital
process.  If you look carefully, you can see the original features are 
basically the same, but the result shows a more mature face.
<P>Here are some more examples:

<P> While we cannot guarantee that your child's facial structure will  develop in exactly the same way as our image suggests, we think that you  will be pleased with the results.  If you are truly dissatisfied with  the result, <STRONG>we will refund your money.</STRONG>
<BR><HR>
<P>Most of these examples were produced from ordinary school photographs.
Send us a 5" by 7" photo of your child (or smaller...bear in

<CENTER><H2>Your Face in Art</H2></CENTER><P>
<BR> 
 
<P>This makes a really delightful gift for anyone.  All you need is
 a color photograph of the person you want to surprise.  They need never know what you 
 are planning until you give them a lovely framed print, or poster with 
 their portrait in a famous painting. 
<BR>   
<P>Below you will see an example of how the face from a modern day photo 
can be incorporated into a famous work of art. We can do the same for you if you send us a (paper/color photo) copy of the 
art you want modified and the photo of the person to be inserted.  It is 
important that each of these show the same view of the face in order to produce 
the best results.  In the first example both the faces are both slightly 
turned away from the viewer.  Neither is full-on, neither is in profile.  
Please follow this rule when sending us the two pictures you want us to 
combine.  Choose the photograph to match the painted face carefully, in order to 
ensure the best results.  You might consider asking a friend to take a photo of 
you posed in the same position, with the light coming from the same 
direction as in the painting of your choice.<BR><BR>

<H2> Report from LACon III, 
the World Science Fiction Convention</H2>
     This convention was a flop in terms of attendance, with 10,000 guests 
     expected (since there had been over 9,000 at LACon II in 1984 at the 
     same location) but only 6,000 materializing, due to the failings of 
     Craig Miller and Elayne and Bruce Pelz on the Con Committee, the lack of adequate 
     publicity (no mention in this week's "Los Angeles Times" that I could 
     find), the virtual collapse of Science Programming due to petty fannish feuds, 
     such as cancellation of the talk by noted SF/science author and 
     Director of SETI (the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) for 
     the Planetary Society, Thomas McDonough, refusal to allow noted space 
     physicist Jordin Kare on science panels, and refusal to allow myself (a well-known 
     expert on the future of the space program, having worked on Galileo, 
     Voyager, Magellan, Space Shuttle, Space Station, Moon Base and Mars 
     base projects for NASA) from being on the "Future of the Space 
     Program" panel discussion, and price gouging ($150.00 at the door, or 
     $60 for a single day!).  Still, there were many fine authors, artists, 
     and fans in and around the Anaheim Convention Center, 
     and these <STRONG>Hugo Awards</STRONG> were presented:

Some data on authors NOT linked on the World Wide Web is based upon "The 
Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy, Through 1968", compiled by 
Donald H. Tuck, Chicago: Advent Publishers, Inc., 1974.  I recommend this 
encyclopedia, as well as more recent and comprehensive encyclopediae 
including the one available on CD-ROM by Peter Nichols and John Clute.

See also "Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels, an English Language 
     Selection 1949-1984", by David Pringle (London: Carroll & Graf, 1985)
     for interesting analysis of 100 readable, excellent, significant books
     
See also "Dream Makers: The Uncommon People Who Write Science Fiction", 
     interviews by Charles Platt (New York: Berkeley, 1980)

See also "Bibliography of Science Fiction and Fantasy" by Sam J. Lundwall, 1964, 
     which I believe has been updated in at least three editions.  He also 
     provided important information in "Science Fiction: fran begynnelsen till 
     vara dagar", commissioned by Radio Sweden, and published in 1969.  The 
     English translation is "Science Fiction: What It's All About", Sam J. 
     Lundwall, New York: Ace, 1971.
     
See also "Billion Year Spree: The True History of Science Fiction", Brian W. 
     Aldiss, (New York: Doubleday, 1973; Schocken Paperback, 1974)
     
See also "Asimov on Science Fiction" (New York: Avon, 1981)

There are several sources for pseudonyms listed here (so far mostly A-P and W-Z):

     "The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy, Through 1968", compiled by 
      Donald H. Tuck, Chicago: Advent Publishers, Inc., 1974
    
      "Checklist of Fantastic Literature", Bleiler, 1948

A for Andromeda, BBC, 1961
     "Species" was blatantly ripped-off from this reasonably faithful series
     adaptation of the Sir Fred Hoyle novel of this name.  A radio message 
     from the Andromeda galaxy, over a million light years away, is picked 
     up by a radio telescope, and turns out to be the blueprints and 
     assembly instructions for an alien supercomputer.  When the 
     supercomputer is turned on, it builds a beautiful woman, whose mind 
     is partly alien.
          There was a 1962 sequel, about a second Andromeda computer being 
     assembled in South America, with pretty much the same production 
     team, but with Susan Hampshire replacing Julie Christie.  The sequel 
     series' title was "The Andromeda Breakthrough."

     The most recent cross-over Western/Fantasy series.
The Adventures of Fu Manchu, Syndicated, 1955-1956, 39 episodes
     Attention conspiracy buffs: the hero of this show was the villain, a 
     Macao-based scientist whose attacks on the West included germ 
     warfare, smuggling, turning agents into double-agents, undercutting 
     peace conferences, and eroding the U.S. currency.  Explains a lot of 
     recent history, doesn't it?  Fortunately, the forces of democracy were 
     saved again and again by Sir Dennis Nayland-Smith of Scotland Yard, 
     Fu Manchu's nemesis for generations.  Based on Sax Rohmer's fictional 
     creations of 1908-1910, there is a politically incorrect tinge of 
     "yellow peril" racism in these episodes today, which was also common 
     in the Australian science fiction of its day.  Silent movies, and then 
     sound movies of 1930-1950 preceded this show, as did the radio serial 
     which began in 1929 -- was it just a coincidence that the Stock market 
     then crashed?
          A TV pilot starring Sir Cedric Hardwicke was produced in 1952, 
     but was not picked up for either network or syndication.  In 1955 Sax 
     Rohmer sold his media rights to Republic Pictures for $4 million, out 
     of which the TV pilot was made which resulted in this series.  
     Christopher Lee starred in several British films of the 1960s, and a 
     feature film of 1980 starred Peter Sellers -- the last film completed 
     before his untimely death.

Alcoa Presents, ABC, Jan 1959-Oct 1961, host John Newland, occult content,
     subtitle (used when syndicated) "One Step Beyond"
     Based on documented real-life events, often involving ghosts or 
     Extra-Sensory Perception (ESP), this atmospheric black-and-white 
     series looks today like a precursor to "X-Files."  The 1978 production 
     of "The Next Step Beyond" had the same host, 19-21 years older, was 
     shot in color, and never caught on in the ratings, perhaps because 
     the old subversive creepiness was gone.

     <A HREF="http://avimall.com/entertain/ALF.txt">ALF</A> @ avimall.com
     What if an alien landed on Earth, and was sucked into a sitcom?  
     ALF ("Alien Life Form"), a 229-year-old furball with attitude, escaped 
     the explosive destruction of his home planet Melmac (as did Kal-El 
     escape the explosion of Krypton to become Superman).  ALF crashed into 
     the Tanner's garage, and became part of their family.  ALF disrupted 
     their banal suburban lifestyle, and made acidic comments about 
     humanity and the American life style, as "3rd Rock from the Sun." 
     would, a decade later.
          Next-door neighbors, the Ochmoneks, never figured out what was 
     going on, a sitcom formula perfected in "Bewitched."
          Trivia questions and answers:
     How long did ALF attend Melmac High School? 122 years.
     What did ALF major in at Melmac High School? Software.
     What sports did ALF participate in at Melmac High School? He was 
          co-captain of the Boullabaiseball team.
     What jobs did ALF have at one time or another? Assistant Boxleitner, 
          male model, phlegm dealer.
     What are ALF's hobbies?  Gerrymandering, snacking on cats.
     What is ALF's height?  "Fluctuates with weight."
     What is ALF's weight? "Till the Sun Shines Nellie."

The Amazing Spider-Man, CBS, 1978
     Based on Stan Lee's creation at Marvel Comics, this show revolved 
     around Peter Parker, nerdy and alienated science major in college who 
     made a few bucks as part-time news photographer for the Daily Bugle.  
     When bitten by a radioactive spider, he developed super-powers, 
     including a sense of danger and great strength and the ability to 
     climb walls and ceilings.  He invented super-gadgets, such as his 
     web-shooter in wrist-bands, and a costume, to fight evil.  But his 
     life as a teenager became even more uncomfortable and confusing.  The 
     adolescent angst added a note of emotional realism to an otherwise 
     formulaic story, and made this show a cult-classic among disaffected 
     science majors.  Was Bill Gates ever bitten by a radioactive spider?

Amazing Stories, NBC, Sep 1985-May 1987
     Back in the early 1980s, your humble webmaster Jonathan Vos Post 
     raised some $50,000 to purchase all rights to Amazing Stories 
     Magazine, arguably the world's oldest science fiction magazine, 
     founded in 1926 by Hugo Gernsback.  I flew to Scottsdale, Arizona to 
     negotiate the deal from the publisher (who greatly preferred 
     Westerns, and had a priceless collection of Western art), at the time 
     when the magazine was edited by an ex-restaurant menu designer, and 
     laid out on a livingroom floor.  There's a strange story of what 
     happened next, which will eventually appear on the Magazine site of 
     this domain.  The point is, I approached one Venture Capital firm 
     after another.  I showed them copies of "Amazing Stories", my 
     brilliant business plan, and then said that we could sell the rights 
     to film and television for more than the purchase rights.  At that 
     point, inevitably, the money-men would day "why would anyone want to 
     buy the title 'Amazing Stories' for movies or television?  Get out of 
     here!"  Well, I was right, and they were wrong.  They missed a chance 
     to do business with Steven Spielberg, who did buy that title...

Automan, ABC, 15 Dec 1983-2 Apr 1984
     A nerdy police computer specialist works on programming computer games 
     in his spare time.  One of his creations, a superhero named 
     "Automan", somehow jumped out of the computer into reality, launching 
     the nebbish protagonist into fighting crime at the highest levels.  
     Automan could walk through walls, and could make almost any computer 
     do him favors, and could temporarily combine with Walter Nebicher into 
     a schizoid human/superhero.  Lights dimmed when Automan walked 
     past -- because he drained energy from circuits nearby.  When the 
     city's electrical consumption went up at dawn, Automan faded away.  
     The two were followed everywhere by Cursor, an animated, well, cursor, 
     who could outline, animate, and create useful solid objects such as 
     cars.  Walter's boss, the crochety Captain Boyd, hated computers and 
     software-hip people, so he could not be told about Automan.  Neither 
     could Walter's mentor, Lieutenant Curtis, who used Walters 
     inexplicable successes to advance his own agenda.

     media presence expanded to Superman's show on radio, and in a couple

Battlestar Galactica, ABC, 17 Sep 1978-17 Aug 1980; also as Galactica 1980, ABC, 1980
     With a huge budget (for its day) of a megabuck per hour, and the 
     biggest PR budget of its season, this show so thoroughly tried to rip 
     off the "Star Wars" franchise that ABC was sued.  Special effects -- 
     lasers, spaceships, robots, etcetera -- for both stories were created by the 
     brilliant John Dykstra.
          Set in "the 7th millennium" A.D., the mile-long Galactica was 
     the only battlestar to survive attack by the deady Cylons and the 
     turncoat Count Baltar, which nearly rendered human beings extinct.  
     Galactica and its fleet of 220 more modestly-scaled spacecraft set out 
     towards escape on a mythical planet -- called Earth.
          Lorne Greene (Actuality Specials, Bonanza, Code Red, Griff, 
     Kraft Music Hall's "How the West Was Swung", Lorne Greene's New 
     Wilderness, Philip Morris Playhouse, Roots, Star Stage) was the 
     Moses-like Commander Adama, aided by his fighter-squadron leader son 
     Apollo (whose brother was killed by Cylons in the establishing 
     episode), pilot/playboy Starbuck (a name from "Moby Dick"), and a 
     large cast.
          When the show returned after 11 years in hiatus, Lorne Greene 
     was the only original cast member.  They had reached Earth, somehow in 
     roughly our present, still pursued by Cylons (a cross between Fred 
     Saberhagen's "Beserkers" and Dr. Who's "Daleks").  Capt. Troy and Lt. 
     Dillon went down to Earth to seek help from the Pacific Institute of 
     Technology -- a parody of my alma mater, the California Institute of 
     Technology -- to get ready for galactic war.  United Broadcasting's 
     rookie newswoman Jamie Hamilton sensed a story here.  The plot was 
     thickened by renegade Galactica councilman Xavier and sickened by 
     14-year-old genius Dr. Zee.

Beauty and the Beast, CBS, 25 Sep 1987-1990
     <A HREF="http://avimall.com/entertain/beast/episode.html">Beauty and the Beast</A> @ avimall.com
     Fritz Leiber created this genre of "urban fantasy", and talented 
     writer/editor/producer George R. R. Martin brought it to life for 
     adoring TV audiences.  New York lawyer Catherine was brutalized by 
     thugs and left to die in Central Park.  She was saved by Vincent, a 
     beast-man more sensitive than Alan Alda, with a leonine face and a da 
     Vincian intelligence.  Nursed to health in caves and tunnels beneath 
     New York City, Catherine returned to the surface (like Proserpine 
     returning from Hades) but she and Vincent had fallen in love.
        They remained connected by ESP, which was useful because her new 
     position in the D.A,'s office put her in frequent danger.  Edie did 
     research for her; Father was a reclusive genius who had raised Vincent 
     and was de facto king of the "Tunnel World"; Kipper and Mouse were 
     two tunnel world people who reported to Father.
          This show had an amazingly literate take on good, evil, art, 
     science, and society.  George R. R. Martin has won major awards for 
     his writing, and has edited a very successful series of collaborative 
     novels about flawed superheroes in a complex alternate history.  
     There are stories about his TV pitches and pilots which are 
     astonishing, and we may tell some of them later on this web site...

          Well-conceived, well-written, well-directed, and well-acted, 
     this series earned a handful of Emmy Awards, and was ABC's biggest 
     hit ever until that time, hitting #2 in the ratings among all TV shows 
     in its 1st season.
          Samantha was a beautiful witch who married mortal advertising 
     executive Darrin in the establishing episode, and promised to abandon 
     her nose-twitching magical powers.  Her family never approved of the 
     marriage or the non-magical lifestyle, including her father Maurice,

Beyond the Planet of the Apes, NBC, September 1975-September 1976, animated,
     see Planet of the Apes.
Beyond Westworld, CBS, 5 March 1980-19 March 1980
     In the 1973 feature film "Westworld" robots (including Yul Brynner), 
     for no clear reason, killed guests and wrecked a future amusement 
     park.  Yul Brynner was the only cast member to reprise his role in 
     the film's sequel, "Futureworld."  These two films spun off the 
     television series "Beyond Westworld" -- which was cancelled after a 
     mere three low-rated episodes.
          "Westworld" was the future amusement park, owned and operated by 
     "The Delos Corporation" -- which had the corporate culture that might 
     result if Microsoft bought Disney and Boeing.  Guests to the theme 
     park interacted with robots which were virtually indistinguishable 
     from humans, allowing the humans to live out their secret desires.  
     C3P0 meets Fantasy Island.
          Mad scientist Simon Quaid (co-inventor with Joseph Oppenheimer of 
     the robots) programmed the robots to take over the world, in a 
     social-engineering scheme that few voters would approve.  John Moore, 
     as head of Delos Security, aided by love-interest Pamela Williams, 
     were all that stood in the way of Quaid's megalomania.
          Killer theme parks were better done, later, by Crichton in 
     "Jurassic Park", and even better in the "Dream Park" trilogy of 
     novels by Steve Barnes and Larry Niven.

     themselves seriously out of their depths in time travel adventures.
The Bionic Woman, ABC (Jan 76-May 77) then NBC (Sep 77-Sep 78), 14 Jan 1976-2 Sep 1978
     <A HREF="http://www.scifi.com/bionicrod/episodes.htm/">The Bionic Woman</A> @ scifi.com
     It all began with the novel "Cyborg" by Martin Caiden.  "Cyborg" 
     begat "The Six Million Dollar Man" which begat "The Bionic Woman."
          Jaime Sommers (The Bionic Woman) was originally a character in 
     the television series "The Six Million Dollar Man."  She was the 
     fiancee of Steve Austin [see database entry for "The Six Million Dollar 
     Man"], but they separated after Steve turned astronaut and Jaime 
     completed her university education and hit the pro tennis circuit.
          When she had a near-fatal skydiving crash, the same doctors 
     (including Dr. Rudy Wells) who made Steve Austin into a super-powerful 
     "Cyborg" (CYbernetic ORGanism, half human, half machine) did the same for her.  
          Steve did not know, however, as she began teaching students at an 
     army base near her home town of Ojai, California.  
          They led parallel lives, both participating 
     in secret missions for OSI (Office of Scientific Information), and 
     sometimes even worked together -- but as a side effect of her accident 
     and/or coma, she did not remember him nor their romance.  He hung out 
     near her, in hopes of rekindling the torch, with him even living at 
     her step-parents' (Elgins') ranch.
          Oscar Goldman was Jaime Sommers' manager at OSI.  When the series 
     moved to NBC, Jaime acquired a bionic dog, the German Shepard "Max."  
     Again and again, in the final season, the enemy was not the usial spy, 
     kidnapper, or drug-lord, but extraterrestrial beings from one part of 
     the cosmos or another.  The writers became confused about what 
     sub-genre of science fiction they were supposed to be writing.

Buck Rogers, ABC, 15 Apr 1950-30 Jan 1951
     A novel became a comic book, a Mutual Broadcasting System radio serial 
     (1932-1936 and 1939-1947) and a film serial starring Buster Crabbe,
     and then, at last, a television show -- which itself was updated 
     three decades later.
          Buck Rogers saved the universe over and over, using hardware 
     standard in pulp-magazine space opera.  His base was the world capital 
     of Niagra, and his allies included the chaste-but-sexy Wilma, the 
     Einsteinian Dr. Huer, and the courageous Martian Black Barney.
          An attempt to cash in on the success of "Captain Video", this 
     juvenile television series was transmitted live.  Due to budget 
     limitations, although most of the action was set in the far future 
     and referred to interplanetary adventure, most of the action was in 
     the laboratory set, purportedly in a cave hidden behind Niagra Falls.

Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, NBC, 20 Sep 1979-16 Apr 1981
     This major update of the 1950-51 TV series (see above) was a network 
     attempt to cash in on the success of "Star Trek" and on the lesser 
     success of "Battlestar Galactica" (itself ripped off from "Star 
     Wars"), with some of the same campy attitude as the television "Batman."
          Six months before the television premier, the pilot was released 
     under the same title on the big screen.
          Captain Buck Rogers, astronaut, was in cryonic suspended 
     animation aboard an interstellar spaceship from 1987 until 2491, 
     accumulating 504 years of back pay plus interest, a matter which no 
     lawyer ever addressed, suggesting that in some ways society really 
     did progress.
         The deep-frozen Bucksicle was discovered by Draconians under the 
     command of sexy-but-evil Princess Ardala and Killer Kane, who both 
     assumed him to be a spy.  Unfortunately, the Earth Defense 
     Directorate (based in New Chicago) agreed with their assessment, 
     albeit they did not approve of the Draconian's never-ending plans to 
     conquer Earth.
          Buck was helped by chaste-but-sexy Wilma Deering, promoted since 
     the old series into the more politically-correct Commander of 
     Terrestrial Defenses.  He also became buddies with Dr. Huer, a cross 
     between Albert Einstein and Carl Sagan, who presented Buck with a 
     robot named Twiki and a talking computer named Dr. Theopolis, who was 
     often a necklace-like fashion accessory to Twiki.
          Although the Draconians were never able to take over our planet, 
     the more powerful force of striking actors delayed the second season 
     for several months.  The new season shifted the venue from Earth to a 
     huge starship "Searcher" to find humans who'd survived some vaguely 
     referred-to "great holocaust."  Admiral Asimov was purportedly a 
     direct descendant of the great real-life author Isaac Asimov, who had 
     long-since created "the Three Laws of Robotics" and the notion that 
     dysfunctional robots might refused to believe that they were created 
     by imperfect humans, a recurring sub-plot involving "Crichton" (a 
     construct even more annoying than Twiki) who refused to acknowledge 
     the "fatherhood" of Dr. Goodfellow.  Hawk was also searching, for 
     other members of his bird-man species.
          It is hard to say if the cocky attitude of the actors played 
     against the big-budget special effects, or whether scripts that took 
     the concepts more seriously might have deepened the show's impact.

Captain Midnight, syndicated, 1954
      This show was also known as "Jet Jackson", in some broadcast areas, 
      and the hero had one name or the other depending on location.
           This series started on radio in 1940, with its super-scientist 
      fighting crime, and assisted by a clumsy assistant Ikky.

Captain Video and His Video Rangers, Dumont, 27 Jun 1949-1 Apr 1955
     This was a historically significant show, despite the astonishingly 
     stingy prop budget of $25 per week.  Why?  Because it was the first 
     and most successful of three children's science fiction shows that 
     seduced kids into the axioms of the Space Opera genre, the other two 
     being "Space Patrol" and "Tom Corbett--Space Cadet."  It can be argued 
     that this created some of the popular support that allowed for a 
     genuine space program only a few years later.  A wonderful book about 
     these shows is "The Great Television Heroes" by Donald F. Glut and Jim 
     Harmon.
          The government played no significant role in scientific genius 
     Captain Video single-handedly saving the world out of a sense of civic 
     duty.  By so doing, he not only defeated evildoers such as Dr. 
     Clysmok, Dahoumie, Heng Foo Seeng, Kul of Eos, Mook the Moon Man, and 
     Nargola, but also had a chance to field-test his gadgets, including 
     The Atomic Rifle, the Discatron, the Optical  Scillometer, the Radio 
     Scillograph, and the Cosmic Ray Vibrator (stop giggling, will you?).
          His most fiendish adversary was Dr. Pauli, who had his own set of 
     super-duper hardware, including the Barrier of Silence (later 
     parodied on "Get Smart"), the Cloak of Invisibility, and the Trisonic 
     Compensator.  The Dumont Network (whose demise alone could end this 
     popular show) sold to their viewers such premiums as Decoder Rings, 
     Space Helmets, and plastic copies of Captain Video's weaponry, almost 
     all of which are highly collectable today.
          Late in its life, the show was retitled "The Secret Files of 
     Captain Video" and they stopped editing in stock footage of Westerns 
     through the money-saving "Remote Carrier Beam."
          Captain Video's spaceship was called the "Galaxy" -- and every 
     child wished to be Captain Video's sidekick "The Ranger" and ride the 
     Galaxy to exotic destinations, whether or not the instruments on the 
     control panel were obviously painted on.

The Curse of Dracula, NBC, 27 Feb 1979-1 May 1979
     Somewhat ahead of today's Great Gothic Revival, and its high priestes 
     Anne Rice, this show gave us Count Dracula "undead and well, and 
     living in California."  The Count taught European History at San 
     Francisco's South Bay College (Evening Division).  After all, he knew 
     five centuries of History personally.
          He violated several ethical, legal, and theological standards by 
     turning three of his students into vampires, namely Antoinette, 
     Christine, and Darryl.  He was opposed by Kurt Von Helsing, the 
     grandson of his former enemy, and Mary Gibbons -- daughter of Amanda, 
     whom Dracula had vampirized earlier.
          NBC packaged three serials together as "Cliff Hangers" but only 
     The Curse of Dracula ran to its end before cancellation drove a wooden 
     stake through the package.

Fantastic Journey, NBC, 3 Feb 1977-13 Apr 1977
     Not to be confused with "Fantastic Voyage" (based on an Isaac Asimov 
     novel), this TV series started with a university's research boat 
     finding an unmapped island in the Bermuda Triangle.  Unknown even to 
     Gilligan, this island had a weird "time and space warp" which 
     allowed the comingling of past, present, and future (somewhat as in 
     Dr. Fred Hoyle's novel "October the First is Too Late").
          Dr. Fred Walters went into the space-time warp, where he 
     encountered four characters lost in time: Varian, a 23rd century 
     telepath; Liana, from an ancient Atlantis; Scott, a contemporary boy 
     with psychic powers; and Dr. Jonathan Willaway, an eccentric 
     scientists from the 1960s who preferred the company of androids.
          There was a network of character conflicts between these five, 
     and what promised to be a lengthy episodic search for the home 
     space-and-time of each, complete with strange creatures and thrilling 
     adventures, but the ratings also were becalmed in the Bermuda 
     Triangle.

     <A HREF="http://avimall.com/entertain/FlashThe.txt">The Flash</A> @ avimall.com
     Based on the classic comic book superhero.  He was an attractive 
     character to me because, unlike the over-powered under-achieving 
     Superman, The Flash had a singe super-power -- namely the ability to 
     move extremely rapidly, from which all secondary abilities were 
     derived.  This was loosely based on the H.G. Wells story "The New 
     Accelerator."
Flash Gordon, Syndicated, 1953-1954 (39 episodes)
     Alex Raymond created the comic strip in 1934, five years after "Buck 
     Rogers."  A year later, in 1935, "Flash Gordon" became a sucessful 
     radio serial starring Gale Gordon, and then three film serials 
     starring Buster Crabbe (1936-1940).
          Flash Gordon himself was a preppie blond polo-playing Yale 
     graduate who accompanied Dale Arden and Dr. Zharkov to the planet 
     Mongo, ruled by the evil Emperor Ming the Merciless.  After they 
     fought Ming to a standstill, they battled Bizdar, the Evil Queen of 
     Cygnil, the Great God Em of Odin, the Mad Witch of Neptune, and anyone 
     else who could throw together a modest collection of androids, 
     monsters, and/or death rays.
          In 1979, NBC ran a Saturday morning animated series.  The 
     following year, a rather entertaining big-budget film lost a bundle, 
     and the franchise has been in limbo ever since.

Friday the 13th:The Series, Syndicated, Oct 1987-?
     Confusingly enough, this television series has nothing whatsoever to

     that antiques dealer Lewis Vendredi (French for "friday") made a deal 
     with the devil to earn a fortune my peddling antique doodads which 
     would each carry a terrible curse.  When Lewis Vendredi died -- 
     presumably as a result of some fine print in his contract -- his 
     innocent neice Micki inherited the store, and renamed it "Curious 
     Goods."  Assisted by her cousin Ryan and a retired magician, Jack 
     Marshak, she tried to get the cursed antique thingamajiggies back 
     from their purchasers, and sequester them in the basement where they 
     could cause no more hideous deaths.  My wife, who once ran a chain of 
     antique stores in Europe, before she became a famous scientist and 
     science fiction author, refuses to talk to me about this show.  Maybe 
     that's because of a certain contract signed in blood, nyaaa haaa

     INTERSECT is another of those government anti-terror agencies and 
     think-tank paid for by your taxes but far too secret to be covered by 
     the press.  INTERSECT agent Sam Casey was rendered invisible by 
     radiation from an undersea explosion.  But he could be temporarily 
     visible again, thanks to Abby Lawrence's computer skills and Leonard 
     Driscoll's management acumen, which yielded a wristwatch-gadget 
     similar in effect to Bilbo Baggin's Ring, allowing a switch back and 
     forth between visibility and invisibility, and in that over-use would 
     be deadly (more than a quarter-hour out of any 24 hours, for Sam).

     was an anthology show.  At first, Sebastian Cabot would take us to 
     "Essex House" and lull us into increasingly scary stories of the 
     supernatural.  Starting with the 5 January 1973 episode, NBC dropped Sebastian 
     Cabot, retitled the show "Circle of Fear", and ran some episodes with 
     no ghosts or vampires or witches at all.  So it was strangled.

The Greatest American Hero, ABC, 18 March 1981-3 Feb 1983
     The greatest hero in this show was actually the head of the ABC legal 
     team, who fought off lawsuits from the owners of the "Superman" 
     copyright.  After that, a real Mr. Hinckley tried (30 Mar 1981) to assassinate 
     President Reagan in order to impress actress Jodie Foster, so scripts 
     involving protagonist Ralph Hinkley had to be rewritten to be named 
     Ralph Hanley (or sometimes just "Mr.H").
          Anyway, Los Angeles high school teacher Ralph had a Close 
     Encounter of the Third Kind with extraterrestrials, who gave him a 
     red flying suit, but the schlemiel lost the instruction book, and had 
     frequent trouble mastering the art of flight and the other powers of 
     the suit (invisibility, x-ray vision, telescopic vision, and the 
     like).
          Nobody knew his secret, except Bill Maxwell, his lawyer Pam 
     Davidson (I told you the lawyers were big in this show), his son 
     Kevin, and four street-wise students escaped from the "Welcome Back 
     Kotter" sort of series: Cyler, Rhonda, Rodriguez, and Tony, who were 
     seen less and less often in the second season, when Ralph and Pam 
     married (Kevin was from a previous marriage).
          This show had a wacky logic all its own, and was a good-natured 
     spoof of the action superhero genre, which had been tried before 
     about 15 years earlier in "Mr. Terrific" and in "Captain Nice."

Great Ghost Tales, NBC, 6 July 1961-21 Sep 1961
     A summer replacement was needed for "The Ford Show Starring Tennessee 
     Ernie Ford", and so NBC produced a series of live episodes with actors 
     such as Robert Duvall, Lee Grant, Arthur Hill, Lois Nettleson, and 
     Richard Thomas (1,2,3 Go; Roots: the Next Generations; the Waltons).
The Green Hornet, ABC, 9 Sep 1966-14 July 1967
     Listed here because of comics and radio (1936) origin, created by 
     George W. Trendle.  Also, because it had the same production team as 
     TV's "Batman."  Few fans knew that George W. Trendle's first hit, "The 
     Lone Ranger" actually introduced Britt Reid (The Green Hornet) as the 
     son of Dan Reid, who in turn was the nephew of the Lone Ranger.  
     Today, this show is a cult-favorite of Bruce Lee fans.

The Highwayman, NBC, 4 Mar 1988-6 May 1988
     Blending fantasy, action, big-rig trucks, and ethnic humor, this 
     unlikely series was based on a 1987 TV movie, with a truck that could 
     also turn invisible, which notion was ditched in favor of the more 
     plausible (?) cab that could transform into a helicopter.
          The Highwayman (who had no given name, apparently) was some sort 
     of federal marshal, who handled secret government cargo, wore 
     leather, had big muscles, and acted as the law "where ordinary laws do 
     not reach."
          He had a tough Australian partner Jetto (like Crocodile Dundee), 
     a stylish African-American electronics genius D.C. Montana, and he 
     took his orders from sexy-but-strict Controller Tania Winthrop.

The Incredible Hulk, CBS, 10 Mar 1978-2 June 1982
     From the Comics character created by Stan Lee (1962), research 
     scientist David Banner was massively irradiated, and ever after 
     became a semi-articulate Id-like green monster whenever he became 
     angry enough.  Afterwards, he would remember nothing of his 
     adventures, making this something like a rationalization of alcoholic 
     blackouts.  Investigative reporter Jack McGee stuck to his trail as 
     he searched for odd jobs and a chance to piece his psyche back 
     together.  Like San Lee's "Spider-Man", this story combined the 
     superhero format with adolescent angst.

The Invisible Man, NBC, 1975
     The title was changed to "The Gemini Man" (see that) in the second 
     season.  Not really related to the 1958 British series, which was 
     created and produced by Ralph Smart, starring Lisa Daniely and 
     Deborah, with voice by Tim Turner.
The Immortal, ABC, 24 Sep 1970-8 Sep 1971
     Based on a 1969 TV movie which in turn was based on a novel by Dr. 
     James Gunn, this was a realistic science fiction chase story.
          Ben Richards was a race car driver who had, for no identified 
     reason, mutant antibodies in his blood which allowed him to fight off 
     every known disease -- including the effects of aging.  Everybody 
     wanted some of his blood, especially the relentless tycoon Arthur 
     Maitland and his goon Fletcher.  Maitland and Ben's fiancee Sylvia 
     were only in a few episodes.
          The TV movie was directed by Joseph Sargent ("Colussus:The 
          Forbin Project").

It's About Time, CBS, 1966
     Stupefyingly unfunny sci-fi comedy about astronauts hanging out with 
     cavemen.  The kids in my school had a little rhyme, which my son today

     about space, it's a bout getting a punch in the face."

The Invaders, ABC, 10 Jan 1967-17 Sep 1968
     This series combined an obsession with UFOs and the American style of 
     cold-war paranoia.  David Vincent, architect, had seen the landing of 
     a flying saucer and then, more frighteningly, discovered that THEY 
     walked amongst us, aliens distinguishable only by the lack of 
     heartbeat, a surreptitious glow, and little fingers that stuck out at 
     an angle in what seems today like a disguised homophobia.
         He was, at first, alone in knowing this vast secret, and later 
     joined by a septumvirate of fellow-believers and electronics magnate Edgar 
     Scoville (starting Dec 1967).  UFO conventions circulate photocopies 
     of an ABC press release that claimed star Roy Thinnes had himself had 
     a Close Encounter with a UFO.  Or so they would have you believe...

Jet Jackson -- see "Captain Midnight"
The Jetsons, 23 Sep 1962-8 Sep 1963, animated, 
     24 original episodes, 41 new episodes in 1985
     <A HREF="http://www.cybercomm.nl/~ivo/guide.html">The Jetsons</A>
     Produced by the same folks who brought you TV's "The Flintstones", 
     this was a satire on 1960's suburban American culture, with "cognitive 
     estrangement" (to use critic Darko Suvin's term) of a 
     science-fictional nature by casting the series in the 21st century.  
     The eponymous George Jetson worked for Spacely Sprockets, Inc. in an 
     alienating job (although he was occasionally promoted to Vice 
     President, it never lasted) for an overbearing boss.
          He lived in Skypad Apartments, which had variable altitude 
     achieved with hydraulic lifts, with his unambitious housewife Jane, 
     their children, and the semi-talking dog Astro (who later had his own 
     adventures with Scooby-Doo).  Despite atomic flying cars, commuting, 
     parking, and speeding tickets were a problem.  Despite robots and 
     automated household gadgets, home-making was a drag.  Despite 
     videophones, nobody had anything interesting to communicate, and 
     despite interplanetary colonization, teenage girls still cared for 
     nothing but media icons, dance crazes, and dating.  
          The dark underside of suburban culture -- divorce, drugs, gangs, 
     suicide, and political homogenization -- never appeared.  The satire 
     lacked the sharper edge of Mad Magazine, but sometimes the limits of 
     Capitalism and Consumerism were skewered anyway.

Johnny Jupiter, Dumont, 21 Mar 1953-13 Jun 1953
     Howdy Doody spinoff about earth as seen through alien eyes, a sort of 
     children's prototype of "Third Rock from the Sun."  A puppet-show set 
     in a TV studio (self-referential and thus post-modernist) the curious 
     janitor Ernest P. Duckweather messed with the control panel and 
     accidently tapped into a TV show from an inhabited planet Jupiter.  He 
     thereafter conversed with puppets Johnny Jupiter and B-12, who were 
     confused about life on Earth, as they had nothing but TV broadcasts 
     to go on.  Subsequently, Ernest P. Duckweather became a star of 
     Jupiter TV, but he had nothing but their shows to show him their 
     culture.  I saw a couple of episodes at a neighbor's apartment before 
     I turned two years old, and it was intriguing and confusing beyond my 
     ability to explain then or now.
     Ernest P. Duckweather -- Vaughn Taylor

Jonny Quest, ABC, 18 Sep 1964-9 Sep 1965, plus new show 1996 {to be done}
     Not strictly science fiction, it was at least fiction about a

     of the magazine Quantum Science Fiction Review, himself a 
     professional scientist, told me that his scientific career was 
     sparked by this cartoon.

Journey to the Unknown, ABC, 26 Sep 1968-30 Jan 1969
     Produced in England
     An explicitly Hitchcockian series without the sublime talent of 
     Hitchcock himself, this centered on emotional and mental extremes 
     that can terrify normal people ripped out of normal lives into a 
     darker world than they knew about.  Sometimes hallucinatory in its 
     dream-logic, few episodes stand out as wholly original.
     Exec. Producer -- Joan Harrison (former assistant to Alfred 
          Hitchcock, and the Producer of his TV series)
The Judgment of Jupiter, UPN, 1997

     The eponymous protagonist, Carl Kolchak, is a crime reporter for 
     Independent News Service in Chicago.  Each time he investigated a

     Seven human astronauts on a short "strato-cruiser" spaceflight from America to London 
     in roughly the year 1984 pass through a "space warp" and land in a very 
     Earth-like world where everything is 12 times normal size, especially 
     adults, children, pets, and bugs.  Gilligan's Island meets "Honey, I 
     Shrunk the Kids", but saved by taking itself seriously and creating a 
     certain empathy for the people who just want to fix the spaceship and 
     get home, including millionare engineer Mark Wilson, heiress Valerie 
     Scott, and 12-year-old Barry.  In the world of giants, Inspector Kobrick 
     of S.I.B. was the security agent in charge of finding and re-finding 
     the earthlings.  Of course, this concept had been done with satiric 
     glee two centuries earlier by Jonathan Swift.

Lights Out, NBC, 19 July 1949-29 Sep 1952
     Spun off from the hit radio show which began in 1934, there were four 
     television specials produced by Fred Coe (Goodyear TV Playhouse, 
     Producer's Showcase, 1955 Emmy for Best Producer of a Live Series) in 
     1946, and then after three years of development hell, this fine 
     suspense anthology.  Each epsiode opened with an extreme close-up of 
     a pair of eyes, cutting to a close-up of a bloody hand reaching for 
     the light switch, and a voice-over of a chilling laugh and the 
     catch-phrase "lights out, everybody!"
          Each episode was shot live.  Some were adaptations of classic 
     short stories, others were developed specially for this series.
     Narrator (1949-50) -- Jack LaRue

Logan's Run, CBS, 16 Sep 1977-16 Jan 1978
     based on the novel by William F. Nolan and George Clayton Johnson 
     (author of many of the best episodes of the original Twilight Zone)
     and the feature film of the same title.  A nuclear war had pretty much 
     wiped out civilization, somewhere between the late 20th century and 
     the year 2319.  Survivors lived in cities out of touch with each 
     other, each having evolved its own culture, and each surrounded by 
     inhospitable desert.  Logan lived in the sybaritic City of Domes, 
     where nobody was allowed to live past his or her 30th birthday.  
     Logan was a "Sandman" -- special policeman -- who betrayed his 
     training by fleeing for his life as the big three-zero approached.
          He fled with a girl named Jessica and Rem, an android.  He sought 
     a fabled "Sanctuary" but was pursued by Francis, an unrepentant 
     Sandman.
          This was unusually sophisticated fare for TV, both in the 
     bleakness of the premise, the strangeness but self-consistency of the 
     cities, and the horrors of the badlands.  It was a landmark in the 
     history of post-nuclear-holocaust fiction, the best recent example of 
     which is "The Postman" by David Brin, which has been repeatedly 
     optioned, was once to be produced by Ron Howard and star yyyyyyy, and is 
     now to be directed by and starring Kevin Costner.

          Mary Woronov was my babysitter as a child, before she fell in

          she is one more influence on me regarding fantasy and science 
          fiction.

     <A HREF="http://www.twilight.com/lostspace">Lost in Space</A>
     Gilligan's Island meets Swiss Family Robinson.  The Robinson family 
     was en route to the Alpha Centauri solar system, 4.3 light years 
     away, for a five-year mission, suggesting that the spaceship Jupiter 
     II could go quite near the speed of light, by technologies never 
     explained.
          Anyway, the evil-for-no-clear-motive Dr. Zachary Smith screwed up 
     the controls, and tampered with the program of the robot (Robby) left over 
     from the far-more-mature film Forbidden Planet.  Or maybe Dr. Smith 
     was some sort of foreign agent, trapped with his intended victims. 
          Almost every episode had the same formula: land on another 
     planet while trying to get home, encounter a monster, have Dr. Smith 
     try to cut a deal with the monster that would send him alone back to 
     Earth, have Robby the Robot say "Danger, Will Robinson", menace June 
     Lockhart, and have Dr. Smith's fatal flaws of cowardice and greed foil 
     his plot, leaving us at a cliff-hanger ending.
          This show seems to have been a favorite of some of my friends, 
     but I found it deeply frustrating, as I kept hoping for 
     something genuinely science fictional to happen, i.e. something with 
     philosophical depth, but the show stayed relentlessly superficial even 
     when a few lines of dialogue could have added profundity at no extra 
     cost.

Man and the Challenge, NBC, 12 Sep 1959-3 Sep 1960
     Listed here because it features a research scientist who tests the 
     extremes of human and equipment capability for volunteers including 
     astronauts.  This falls within the definition of science fiction, in 
     that it explicitly relates science and technology and their effect on 
     human beings.
          The best episode had three people testing space suits by walking 
     across Death Valley, where they have a deadly encounter with armed 
     militia members who assume that they are alien invaders.
     Dr. Glenn Barton -- George Nader
     Producer -- Ivan Tors
The Man from Atlantis, NBC, 22 Sep 1977-25 July 1978
     Faster than a plate of sushi, more powerful than Flipper, more 
     mindless than "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea", look, down there 
     under the ocean, swimming in a legs-together undulating dolphin 
     parody, it's Patrick Duffy as ... The Man From Atlantis!
          With webs between his fingers and bright green eyes, he fights a 
     never-ending battle for the United States Navy and the Foundation 
     for Oceanic Research.  Pass the tartar sauce!

     <A HREF="http://www.utv.net/misc/Uncle.html">The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</A>
     Listed here because, in the James Bond tradition, it sometimes crossed 
     the line from Spy story to Spy Spoof, to Science Fiction.  In 
     particular, the 1966-67 season had ever more absurd plots, with a 
     comic-book flavor.  The series became more realistic in 1967-68, but 
     it was too late to stop the series from being replaced by the smash 
     hit "Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In" -- or was that a final victory by 
     THRUSH?
          U.N.C.L.E. = United Network Command for Law Enforcement.
          THRUSH = the Technological Hierarchy for the Removal of 
               Undesirables and the Subjugation of Humanity

Manimal, NBC, 30 Sep 1983-31 Dec 1983
     Superhero/Fantasy/Police series in which Jonathan Chase has the 
     hereditary ability to turn himself into any animal.  Disguised as an 
     upper-crust professor of "animal behavioral sciences" at New York 
     University, he was an ally to the police and a terror to criminals.  
     His secret identity was known only to African American assistant Ty 
     Earle (an old Vietnam buddy) and sexy cop Brooke.  The special effects 
     of his transformations were good early television versions of the 
     "morphing" technique, now so common.

M.A.N.T.I.S., Fox, 1994-1995
     The first superhero/science fiction show starring an 
     African-American, damaged by the network toning down the racial/civil 
     rights subplots, but otherwise a promising series.
Max Headroom, ABC, 31 March 1987-16 Oct 1987
     <A HREF="http://tawney.cs.nott.ac.uk/~epc/save/max_headroom">Max Headroom</A>
     Based on 1984 British TV movie starring Matt Frewer and produced by 
     Peter Wagg, which spread like a computer virus to Cinemax distribution 
     in the US, and then into Coca-Cola commercials.
          Premise: near-future muckraking Channel 23 reporter Edison Carter 
     is decapitated in a car chase.  He is the model for a 
     computer-generated artificial intelligence created by Channel 23's 
     research director Bryce.  Max Headroom can pop up in any computer 
     system or onto any network broadcast, while being monitored by 
     Bryce's assistant Theora and newsroom director Murray, and sometimes 
     by network head Mr.Cheviot.
          Max Headroom competed with, and sometimes was allied with, Blank 
     Reg and Dominique of a lower-budget and harder-hitting network.
          The British series was darker and had a nastier edge in its 
     depiction of a corrupt dystopian future in the Road 
     Warrior/Bladerunner category.  That makes this the first Cyberpunk TV 
     series.

Men Into Space, CBS, 30 Sep 1959-7 Sep 1960
     Triggered by the Russian launch of Sputnik on 4-5 October 1957, this 
     explicitly science fictional show had technical support from USAF, 
     Navy, Army, and various scientific organizations, in an impressive 
     attempt at authenticity -- making this the first "Hard Science Fiction" 
     series on television.  It featured drama in spacecraft, space 
     station, Moon Base, and in the vicinity of various planets and moons 
     in the solar system.  
          Some critics (see "Future Tense" p.294) found it "bland and 
     unexciting" and blamed the low-budget artificiality of the sets.

     Fantasy aimed at disaffected teenagers, with the message that it's 
     okay to be a freak, especially if you want to fight evil.  The 
     "Humanidyne" Institute" in Los Angeles brought together a 
     7-foot-4-inch African American (El Lincoln) who could shrink to six 
     inches, rock musician Johnny B. who can shoot lightning bolts from 
     his fingers, and telekinetic levitaor former juvenile delinquent 
     Gloria.
          They were led in their crime-busting by junior scientist Dr. 
     Billy Hayes, against the wishes of Humanidyne" Institute Director Dick 
     Stetmeyer.  Jane Miller was Gloria's probation officer; Miss Nance 
     was the Institute's useless receptionist.

     Listed here because, in the James Bond tradition, it sometimes crossed 
     the line from Spy story to Spy Spoof, to Science Fiction.  Also, its 
     cast overlapped that of "Space 1999" (Martin Landau and Barbara Bain), 
     and featured Leonard Nimoy of the Star Trek franchise.  I'm also 
     biased because one episode was filmed at my alma mater, Caltech, and I 
     was photographed chatting with Barbara Bain with a photo run in 
     various Hollywood magazines.

Moonbase 3, BBC, 1973
     Boring attempt at realistic serial about scientists in 2003 in a domed 
     base on the moon.  By the way, you need about 5-10 feet of moondirt 
     (regolith) piled on top of a dome to block off ionizing radiation.

Mork & Mindy, ABC, 14 Sep 1978-10 June 1982, introduced Robin Williams
     <A HREF="http://www.pe.net/~suzanne/mork.htm">Mork & Mindy</A> @ pe.com
     Spin-off from a February 1978 episode of "Happy Days" (15 Jan 1974-
     12 July 1984) where an alien from the planet Ork came to Earth and tried 
     to kidnap Richie Cunningham (Ron Howard).  The episode generated so 
     many letters to the ABC that they created this new series.
          Mork did not fit in on Ork, because he alone had a sense of 
     humor, and so he was semi-exiled to Earth by the leader, Orson.  Mork 
     was supposed to figure out humans, which the Orkans had never been 
     able to do.
          He would report back to Orson at the end of each episode in an 
     explanatory monologue that would end with the catch-phrase "Nanu 
     nanu."
          Mork soft-landed in a giant egg just outside Boulder, Colorado, 
     and was taken in by Mindy MConell, who worked at her father's music 
     store (just as Philip K. Dick worked at a record store in Berkeley 
     and saw the world through unique persepctives).  Mork combined human 
     and Orkian customs in a wacky but well-meaning way that had him 
     pegged as just plain nuts.  Everybody was worried about Mindy keeping 
     this weirdo in her attic, except for hip grandma Cora.
          The show had great ratings for a season, until ABC foolishly 
     rewrote it, in blatant disregard for the first law of television: 
     if it ain't broken, don't fix it.  The second season started with a 
     complete change of supporting cast and an episode in a strange world 
     of good and evil archetypes.  ABC also moved the show from a Thursday 
     slot to Sunday.  The ratings immediately plummeted by over 50%.
          The network restored the show to its former Thursday slot, 
     simplified the confused story line, and brought back Cora and 
     Frederick McConnell, who had supposedly toured as an orchestra 
     conductor during his hiatus.  The brother-and-sister pair from the 
     Bronx, the DaVincis, were added (to no good effect).  Mindy's cousin 
     Nelson, an irritating preppie/yuppie came into the show, and 
     downstairs neighbor (think "Dennis the Menace" Mr. Wilson) Mr. Bickley 
     had his role expanded.  The lunatic Exidor made recurring 
     appearances, as a friend of Mork who babbled new-age prophecy and led 
     a cult "The Friends of Venus" made of imaginary invisible members.  
     Mindy somehow parlayed her journalism classes into employment at 
     KTNS-TV under Mr. Sternhagen.  Ratings partly rebounded.
          In Fall 1981, Mork and Mindy were married, and had a surrealistic 
     honeymoon on Ork.  Mork then gave birth to fully-grown Jonathan 
     Winters, who called Mindy "Shoe" and Mork "Mommy."  He grew younger 
     and younger.  Robin Williams and Jonathan Winters were the highpoint 
     of network comedy, but could not by themselves get ratings back to 
     what ABC demanded.

Mr. Merlin, 7 Oct 1981-18 Aug 1982
     Arthurian fantasy in a San Francisco garage, this was an odd blend 
     of "urban fantasy" as pioneered by Fritz Leiber with sitcom formula.
     Plots often hinged on (from a software point of view) "bugs" in 
     magical spells, and on a shadowy group of sorcerers.

The Munsters, 24 Sep 1964-1 Sep 1966
     This was a fairly successful meld of dark fantasy made light, and 
     sitcom silliness.  There was a science-fiction air to the way that 
     the mundane/pretty niece Marilyn looked strange to the family of 
     Frankensteinian monster, 350-year-old vampire, and werewolf, while 
     they in turn looked normal to each other and strange to outsiders.  
     This was, by the way, the favorite American show of The Beatles, who 
     enjoyed hanging out with Al Lewis on one American tour (the one where 
     they played the Hollywood Bowl).

Muppet Show -- should I put an entry here for "Pigs in Space"?
My Favorite Martian, CBS, 29 Sep 1963- 4 Sep 1966
     Sit-com about Los Angeles Sun reporter Tim O'Hara rescuing a crashed 
     Martian who looked human (except for extensile antennae) and had both 
     telepathic and telekinetic powers, plus invisibility and a mind 
     filled with advanced technology. 
          Like all good aliens, he just wanted to fix his spaceship and go 
     home, while he stayed with Tim in Mrs. Brown's boardinghouse.  He 
     developed a crush on Mrs. Brown, and imagined that Officer Brennan 
     also had romantic leanings towards her -- which he manifestly did.
          The show worked to the extent that Ray Walston's character was 
     so convincingly portrayed, and failed to the extent that the episodic 
     sit-com adventures went nowhere.

     Americans.  At least, by comparison to the stories my mother told me 
     about the panic in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where she grew up.  Just a 
     girl then, she ran around telling people that this was not a real 
     news broadcast but  only Orson Wells in a scheduled broadcast of the

Out There, CBS, 28 Oct 1951-13 Jan 1952
     Live anthology series consisting of adaptations from short stories by 
     major Science Fiction authors, aimed at adult/juvenile crossover 
     audience, using special effects.  A now-obscure series that should be 
     commended for its attention to literature, which was simply ahead of 
     its time.  Teleplays were adapted from short stories by notable 
     science fiction authors.

The Phoenix, ABC, 19 Mar 1982-15 Sep 1982
     Born as a 26 Apr 1981 movie special, this was reprised as a short-run 
     series.  Bennu was a, emissary from an alien planet with a dying 
     race, who came to earth in the 4th Century A.D. and was preserved in 
     an Andean tomb, being somehow revived by modern Inca-hunting 
     archeologists.  His motivation: to find his partner Mira, buried 
     half-alive somewhere else in the Americas, while protecting the 
     environment with his necklace-worn amulet.  Preminger was the 
     government agent tasked with capturing Bennu and putting his powers 
     to work for covert intelligence purposes.

The Powers of Matthew Star, NBC, 17 Sep 1982-11 Sep 1983
     Most High School students feel alienated, but Matthew Starr of 
     Crestridge High really was, as Crown Prince of planet Quadris, exiled 
     to Earth to do his homework on telekinesis and telepathy.  He fought 
     monstrous and robotic goons from the tyranny that outsed his Dad, 
     while pretending to be the adopted son of Walt Shepard, whom Lou 
     Gossett Jr. almost made plausible as combination Science 
     Teacher/Football Coach, otherwise the least likely plot element.  And 
     I speak as a graduate of Caltech, where the football team had higher 
     IQs than weights (in pounds). The series was supposed to premiere in 
     September 1981, but was delayed a year due to Peter Barton's being 
     seriously burned during filming.  The show lost its focus about 
     halfway through, when Matt developed transmutation and astral 
     projection, while fighting spies for Major Wymore, and still somehow 
     having time to hang out with buddy Bob and try getting past first base 
     with Pam.

The Prisoner, ITC (Great Britain) and CBS, 1 June 1968-11 Sep 1969 (and rerun 1969)
     Deservedly a cult favorite, this was one of America's greatest orginal 
     television dramas, in part because it was filmed in England, and was the 
     brainchild of the charismatic Patrick McGoohan, who created, starred, 
     produced, and wrote some episodes (American science fiction/opera/poet 
     genius Thomas M. Disch wrote most of the rest).  It was a 
     quasi-spinoff of Patrick McGoohan's character John Drake in the British 
     (1965-66) series "Secret Agent", (for which Johnny Rivers had a pop hit with 
     the Phil Sloane & Steve Barri theme song "Secret Agent Man" -- 
     "they've given you a number, and taken away your name").
     Rather like James Bond meets Kafka in John La Carre 
     neverland.  The main location, "the village", was Portmeiron, a North 
     Wales resort on Cardigan Bay, where Bertrand Russell, George Bernard 
     Shaw, and Noel Coward used to relax.  This is most appropriate, as the 
     intelligent scripts combined the twisted mathematical logic of 
     Bertrand "Principia Mathematica"  Russell (once jailed for antiwar 
     activism), the vegetarian iconoclast playwright Shaw, and the zany 
     musical ironies of Noel Coward -- Disch's choreography of "Dem Bones" 
     had to be seen to be believed.

Probe, ABC, 7 Mar 1988-29 June 1988
     A series too literate for television, thanks to co-creator Isaac 
     Asimov (who was active in both Science Fiction Writers of America, 
     Mystery Writers of America, and Mensa).  Austin James, from a base of 
     operations called "the batcave", was a scientific genius -- a cross 
     between Isaac Asimov himself, Science Officer Spock, and Sherlock 
     Holmes.  
          Each episode's plot was based on an actual scientific fact or 
     theory.  Austin and secretary/sidekick Mickey (the Dr. Watson to 
     Austin's Sherlock Holmes) would solve each crime by analysis of clues 
     in the laboratory part of the warehouse/batcave.  Police arrested the 
     perpetrator every time, invariably surprising the criminal who 
     thought that he was too clever for the cops to nab.
          If you enjoyed this show, I strongly recommend that you buy any 
     of the mystery novels of Isaac Asimov.  He told me, in the blueroom at 
     NBC before we did the NBC-TV Today Show together, that "Muder at the 
     A.B.A." was his personal favorite -- it deals with a murder at a 
     convention, and has wicked insights into science fiction fandom, 
     literary agents, book deals, and the like.
          Isaac Asimov [see the Ultimate Mystery/Detective Web Guide] also 
     wrote a series of "Black Widow" mystery stories, about crimes solved 
     by a waiter at a weekly restaurant gathering of authors.

     Mickey Castle -- Ashley Crow
     Created By -- Dr. Isaac Asimov [see Authors page] and Michael Wagner

Project U.F.O., 19 Feb 1978-30 Aug 1979
     Jack Webb, master of realistic police drama (Dragnet, Adam 12) 
     absorbed himself in the Air Force's "Project Blue Book" analysis of 
     unidentified flying objects, and dramatized the reports that just 
     couldn't be covered up or dismissed.  Kind of a "X Files" ahead of its 
     time, this show also had a gritty authenticity that some viewers took 
     to be straight documentary.  Hard-core UFO believers point out that 
     the series was produced by Colonel William T. Coleman, who was the 
     genuine Project Blue-Book head, and was therefore a cover-up disguised 
     as fiction but all too true.  Hmmmmmm.

Q.E.D., 23 Mar 1982-27 Apr 1982
     Does Q.E.D. stand for "Quod Erat Demonstrandum" (a phrase used at the 
     end of a mathematical proof, meaning "what was meant to be 
     demonstrated") or -- as they whisper at Caltech -- "Quantum 
     Electrodynamics?"  This shortlived show was "The Wild, Wild West" 
     meets H.G. Wells' England (1912).  It is thus a cousin of both The Adventures 
     of Brisco County, Jr. and of Dr. Who.  The usual mad scientist bent on 
     global conquest -- Dr. Kilkiss -- was always thwarted by American 
     Professor Quentin E. Deverill, an amateur detective who could throw 
     together astonishing gimmicks, and his Cockney butler/chauffeur, for 
     an Arthur Conan Doyle flavor (Deverill = Sherlock Holmes, Kilkiss =

    This was the parody of space opera -- especially "Star Wars" -- for 
    TV, as Mel Brooks waited too long to try the same notion for film in 
    "Space Balls."  The mixture of sex, Woody Allen type brainy jokes, and

The Quatermass Experiment, BBC, 1953, 6 episodes (40 minutes each)
     In Great Britain, this was seen in 1953 on television as a six-part 
     serial, but in the United States it was only seen after Hammer Films 
     adapted the episodes and two sequel series into feature films, which 
     were released in the US (and broadcast at obscure times) as "The 
     Creeping Unknown", "Enemy from Space", and "Five Million Years to 
     Earth."
          A brilliant cross-over between science fiction and horror, it 
     was aimed at adults but was even more effective on children who got to 
     see it despite the BBC warning "thought to be unsuitable for children 
     and persons of a nervous disposition."
          An astronaut comes back to Earth having been unknowingly 
     infected by an extraterrestrial life form.  The series was 
     transmitted live using 1936 TV cameras each with only a single lens, 
     which prevented rapid cuts from one camera to another, although some 
     special effects sequences were pre-filmed inserts.

Quatermass II, BBC, 1955
     The second of the three Quatermass serials (see "The Quatermass 
     Experiment").  The British government was being taken over from 
     within by extraterrestrials who had previously set up a remote rural 
     base camp in England or Scotland.  Eventually the Hammer film 
     adaptation was shown in the US as "Enemy from Space."
     Professor Quatermass -- John Robinson (Reginald Tate was deceased)
     Producer -- Rudolph Cartier

     Writer -- Nigel Kneale
Quatermass and the Pit, BBC, 1958
     The third and best of the three Quatermass serials (see "The Quatermass 
     Experiment").  Earth was starting to be invaded by insectile aliens 
     five million years ago.  The site of the first Martian spaceship has 
     been a location for supernatural events ever since London was 
     founded.  When this site is accidently excavated for commercial real estate 
     construction, the invasion picks up where it left off.  This was a 
     marvellously well-thought-through story, with scientists actually 
     analyzing stuff, and the martians having a self-consistent but 
     decidedly non-human characterization and social structure.  
          Eventually the Hammer film adaptation was shown in the US as 
     "Five Million Years to Earth."
          In a 1977 interview by Paul Madden ("Future Tense", p.294) Nigel 
     Kneale said "In the Quatermass serials, I always used what was going 
     on at the time as a basis for the stories... in the late 1950s London 
     was being rebuilt after the war and so a number of huge cavities were 
     being dug... unexploded bombs were always being found and sometimes 
     old Roman ruins would be exposed.  And I thought -- what if they 
     found something else far beyond that?  What if they uncovered a 
     spaceship?  And this led to Quatermass and the Pit."

The Questor Tapes, NBC, 1974
     The third try by Gene Roddenberry since Star Trek to launch a new 
     series (#1 was Genesis II, #2 was Planet Earth).  An android named 
     Questor tries to figure out the reason he exists.  Philosophically 
     speaking, this is an "ontological" drama.  In literary tradition, it 
     draws on the Golem myth, Mary Shelly'd Frankenstein, and the fiction 
     of Philip K. Dick.
     Questor -- Robert Foxworth
     Creator/Producer -- Gene Roddenberry

     Spaceflight, frozen dinosaurs, robots, telepathy, flying saucers ... 
     these and more were the subjects of documentary and pseudodocumentary 
     episodes, of variable authenticity and fictionalization, partly 
     depending on who was science advisor of the week.  At its best, this 
     was very good.  At its worst, it was flat-out boring.
         According to "Future Tense" (p.293) Ivan Tors said in a 1956 
     interview "One of the traps into which such a series may fall is 
     complete dependence on science for interest.  This is avoided at the 
     story conference by excluding the scientists at the start.... after 
     the story is developed it is up to Dr. Maxwell Smith, the program's 
     technical advisor, and the other research people to suggest some 
     scientific fact upon which the story can be hung."

     Unfortunately co-created by Billy Mumy (Lost in Space) this is surely 
     the worst live-action science fiction juvenile today.
Space: 1999, ITC (Great Britain)/Syndicated, produced 1974-1976, 48 episodes, 
     released Sep. 1975
     Despite the highest budget for TV sci-fi ever (about 1/3 of a million bucks per 
     episode) and Martin Landau plus Barbara Bain (both of Mission 
     Impossible) plus some cool sets and effects, talking computers, 
     Star-Wars lasers, "Queller Drive" spaceships, "Camelot Locator" beams, 
     and Rudi Gernreich unisex costumes, nothing could rescue a 
     scientifically lame premise (nuclear waste explosion knocks moon out 
     of orbit) and poorly-conceived aliens with no motivation (giants 
     squids, people-eating contraceptive foam, prostitute robots of Planet 
     Piri.
          To begin with, a "radioactive waste explosion" could not knock 
     the moon (with its inhabited lunar base) out of Earth orbit.  But 
     even if we grit our teet and accept this preposterous concept, how 
     does the Moon thereafter encounter one solar system after another -- 
     is it travelling faster than the speed of light, or what?  This is 
     exactly what goes wrong when non-science fiction writers try to create 
     science fiction.

Space Patrol, ABC, 9 Jun 1951-1 Jun 1952
     Classic juvenile, launched in California as a daytime local, picked 
     up by ABC as a Saturday/Sunday daytime series, but briefly slotted 
     into 6:00-6:30 p.m. "prime time", this cheesy space-travel time-travel
     30th Century series featured genuine World War II Army Air Corps ace 
     Ed Kemmer as Space Patrol Commander Buzz Corey who kicked villainous 
     butt for the glory of the United Planets of the Universe, along with 
     his audience-identification sidekick Cadet Happy, the sexy daughter of 
     the United Planets Secretary General, and various gadgets for sale to 
     viewers, such as the Paralyzer Ray Gun, the Brainograph, and a 30-foot 
     model spacecraft "Terra" that toured America and was given away to a 
     sweepstakes-winning fan, who was nearly destroyed by the concentrated 
     jealousy beams of a million disappointed kids.
          Like "Captain Video", "Buck Rogers", and "Tom Corbett, Space 
     Cadet" this was transmitted live, but unlike the three predecessors,

          "Faster than a speeding bullet!  More powerful than a

     Superman, strange visitor from another planet, who came to Earth with

          George Reeves had created the role of Superman in the low-budget 
     1951 feature film "Superman and the Mole People" (produced by Robert Maxwell 
     and Bernard Luber).  The series had pretty good ratings, partly 
     because of the stories and acting, and partly because of the visual 
     quality achieved by pre-filming (as opposed to live telecast).  From 
     the third season, the filming was in color.

Survivors, BBC, 1975
     A plague wipes out 52,000,000 people in six weeks of terror in Great 
     Britain, leaving only some 7,000 survivors.  In the series, we follow 
     one small group of survivors as they attempt to prosper in a 
     post-technological nation.  This is similar to "The Day of the 
     Triffids", the cosmic disaster novels of John Wynham, and the 
     inimitable fiction of J. G. Ballard.  The series falls flat in making 
     the survivors far too comfortable, and celebrating (rather than 
     warning against) the prospects of a future without technology.  This 
     is a hippy head trip, not real science fiction.  Even "The Stand" by 
     Steven King does the job better.

Thriller, NBC, 13 Sep 1960-9 July 1962
     True to the eponymous genre title, almost every episode revolved 
     around an ordinary man or woman with whom the audience can easily 
     identify being caught up in a frightening or life-threatening 
     situation.  That has been a key to the "thriller" style since John 
     Buchan's "The 39 Steps" -- the moral universe is turned upside-down, 
     and the world is suddenly seen to be a darker and more dangerous 
     place.  The central character often wonders whether he or she is being 
     paranoid, but events then show that he or she was not paranoid enough.

Time Express, CBS, 26 Apr 1979-17 May 1979
     "Fantasy Island" meets "The Time Machine" aboard the "Starlight

     about an ad exec who gets off a train and encounters his childhood 
     self in a Carnival.  Or then again, possibly not.
     Each episode carried passengers back in time aboard a gleaming Time 
     Express train that rode the clouded skies of time, to give them a 
     chance to change their pasts by altering some key decision in their 
     lives.  This is, according to modern physicists, one of the things 
     that can NOT be done, even if you have a time machine.  They theorize 
     that you can participate in the past, but not change it.  Be that as it 
     may, this is really a series related to the science fiction subgenre 
     of "parahistroy" or "alternate history" where a changed event has 
     spawned a whole new present in which, for instance, the South won the 
     American Civil War, or Japan and Germany won World War II, or I 
     actually completed my Ph.D. and became a Professor and hired a 
     graduate student to enter all the stuff in this Magic Dragon

Time Tunnel, ABC, 9 Sep 1966-1 Sep 1967
     See "Time Express", above, for an explanation that scientists do NOT 
     think it is possible to change the past.  This series respects that 
     opinion, with a vengeance.  Dr. Tony Newman and Dr. Doug Phillips 
     worked in a ultra-secret government research lab underground in 
     Arizona, and their laser-powered system threw them into the past 
     before the system could undergo the proper final configuration audit.  
          Trapped in history, they could jump from one time to another, but 
     were unable to get home. Dr. Ann MacGregor and Dr. Raymond Swain kept 
     trying to save them from the lab, but again and again our heroes 
     tried to change the outcome of events, such as Abraham Lincoln's 
     assassination, or the sinking of the Titanic (episode #1) or 
     Marie Antoinette's beheading, and were always ironically prevented from 
     so doing.  Sometimes they were in the distant past 1,000,000 B.C. or 
     so, sometimes in early history (the fall of Jericho), sometimes in 
     meso-American history (Cortez vs. Montezuma), and once in the far 
     future of 1,000,000 A.D.  The past was more commonly used than the 
     future, because stock footage is cheaper than new production.

Tom Corbett, Space Cadet, CBS (Oct 1950-Dec 1950) then ABC 
     (Jan 1951-Sep 1952) and finally NBC (July 1951-Sep 1951),
     2 Oct 1950-26 Sep 1952
     Based on the great Robert Anson Heinlein's young adult novel "Space 
     Cadet" (New York: Scribner's, 1950, with cover art by Clifford N. 
     Geary), this was CBS's attempt to steal the thunder of the Dumont 
     Network's "Captain Video" -- and with a higher budget and greater 
     technical authenticity.  
          "Dean of American Science Fiction Authors" Robert Heinlein had 
     achieved a record-setting level of "hard SF" realism in co-authoring 
     the screenplay for (and acting as Technical Director for) George Pal's 
     film "Destination: Moon", which was loosely based on Heinlein's young adult 
     novel "Rocketship Galileo" (New York: Scribner's, 1947), his first,
     which is the earliest science fiction novel that I can remember reading.
     Heinlein and his second wife Virginia have minimized access to 
     documents about how actively involved Heinlein was in "Tom Corbett", 
     but some episodes show his handiwork, such as the reference to 
     weightlessness being more properly called "Free Fall" -- a term 
     invented by Heinlein and now widely accepted.
          In the national Bestseller "Grumbles from the Grave", by Robert 
     Heinlein, edited by Virginia Heinlein (New York: Ballentine, 1990) we 
     read (p.50) "I have written [Scribner's editor] Miss [Alice] 
     Dalgliesh about the TV scripts [Tom Corbett, Space Cadet].  Did you 
     read them?  If so, you know how bad they are; I don't want an air 
     credit on that show (much as I appreciate the royalty checks!) and I 
     am reasonably sure that a staid, dignified house like Scribner's will 
     feel the same way.  It has the high moral standards of soap opera."
          By the way, Robert Heinlein's novel "Rocket Ship Galileo" was 
     supposed to have been followed by at least five sequels, including:
               "The Young Atomic Engineers on Mars, or Secret of the Moon 
                    Corridors", 
               "The Young Atomic Engineers in the Asteroids, or The Mystery 
                    of the Broken Planet",
               "The Young Atomic Engineers in Business, or The Solar System 
                    System Mining Corporation",
     and I cannot help but speculate that if he had written these 
     juveniles, their plots would have found their way into Tom Corbett, 
     Space Cadet, and the series would have been even more popular.  But I 
     digress.  To return to the actual plot of Tom Corbett:
          Somewhen in the 24th Century, young Tom Corbett ("Tex" in the 
     novel) entered the Space Academy (of the Interplanetary Patrol, in 
     Colorado, in the novel) along with verbally-aggressive pal Roger Manning 
     (Matt in the novel) and cerebral Astro from Venus, with all hoping to 
     graduate to the Solar Guards.  
          Aboard the good spaceship "Polaris" they adventured 
     throughout the solar system, and plot complications were based on the 
     dangers of meteors or radiation rather than mad scientists or evil 
     aliens (a fatal flaw in "Captain Video").  We do know that Program 
     Advisor Willy Ley, a noted ex-German space expert and science writer, 
     brought "hard science fiction" concepts such as asteroid belts, 
     artificial gravity, and anti-matter to the series.  I discussed this 
     with Willy Ley when I met him in New York in 1959.  We made a $5 bet, 
     which I promptly lost, but that's another story.
          The series only lasted three months at CBS -- probably due to 
     budgetary concerns or disappointing sales of the now-collectable 
     merchandise -- and moved to a couple of years at ABC.  NBC merely 
     aired kinescopes of episodes as a summer replacement for Victor 
     Borge.  The show was televised live, like "Captain Video" and "Buck 
     Rogers", but unlike these competitors, the special effects were also 
     live.
          Although technically a childrens' show, this was a high-water 
     mark in television science fiction, and a significant precursor to 
     Star Trek.

     NBC (Jun 1956-Oct 1956), 9 Oct 1953-14 Oct 1956
     Based on characters created by fantasy novelist Thorne Smith who later 
     appeared in a series of feature films.  George and Marion Kirby die 
     of exposure after being trapped in a ski-trip avalanche.  Besides 
     their two deaths, their attempted rescuer perishes too -- the St. 
     Bernard Neil.  All three somehow return as ghosts from Europe to 
     haunt the Kirby's American home, which is now the residence of Cosmo 
     Topper, a stolid banker.
         George, Marion, and Neil (who likes a huge snifter of brandy 
     whenever possible) make a concerted effort to get Topper to unwind and 
     have fun.  Nobody but he can see the ghosts, and so his behavior is 
     taken to be, at best, eccentric by his wife Henrietta, his co-worker 
     Mr. Schuyler, and his maid and cook.
          In the television series (but not the novel or films) the dog Neil appears;
     in Thorne Smith's story, the Kirbys were killed in a car crash rather than on a ski 
     trip, and hence there was no co-perishing co-haunting dog.
          The series was cancelled after a couple of seasons on CBS, and 
     was seen in reruns for a year on ABC and a summer on NBC.
          Another series based on a Thorne Smith novel was "Turnabout" 
     (1979).

The Twilight Zone, CBS, 2 Oct 1959-31 July 1987
     One of the greatest TV shows in history, due to the genius of Rod 
     Serling and the superb writing of genuine science fiction authors, 
     all backed by excellent casting of the varied teleplays.  I've got

UFO, ITC/Syndicated, Produced 1970 (26 episodes), released Fall 1972
     Set in the then-future 1980, the premise was that an international 
     military command was set up to defend Earth from Unidentified Flying 
     Objects.  This New World Order strike force was SHADO -- Supreme 
     Headquarters, Allied Defense Organization.  Produced in England, this 
     series mocked American priorities by giving the commander, Edward 
     Straker, a cover identity as a movie producer.  John Brosnan ("Future 
     Tense", p.299) notes that this first non-puppet series by Gerry and 
     Sylvia Anderson had "a cast [that] seemed to be trying to imitate 
     puppets, particularly Ed Bishop...)

The UFO Incident, NBC, 1975
     TV movie that looks like a rip-off of "Close Encounters of the Third 
     Kind" but actually began before that feature film.  John G. Fuller 
     had written a purportedly nonfiction book about a married couple who 
     were abducted by aliens in a UFO.  The book was entitled "The 
     Interrupted Journey."  James Earl Jones bought media  rights to the 
     book, intending to package a feature film, but after being turned down 
     by every major film studio, he re-sold the book rights to 
     television.  The next year, "Close Encounters" went into 
     pre-production, and James Earl Jones (already known about Hollywood 
     for his interest in space movies) was cast as the voice for Darth 
     Vader in "Star Wars."

<A NAME="TV-V"><H3><STRONG>V: TELEVISION: 6</STRONG></H3></A>

V, NBC, 26 Oct 1984-5 July 1985
     Two popular miniseries became a weekly series.  "V" abbreviates 
     "Visitors" -- the aliens who offered to barter their high technology 
     for terrestrial minerals.  Or so their PR firm said.  A handfull of 
     sceptics uncovered the malignant nature of the Visitors as the aliens 
     systematically took over the earth and liquidated almost all 
     resistance.  Beneath their humanoid features, they were really 
     carnivorous lizards, who considered humans little more than walking 
     sushi.  The good guys drive off the baddies with a bacterial red dust, 
     reminiscent of the germs that defeated H.G. Wells' Martians.
          The weekly series started with a Nuremberg-like trial of the 
     captured Visitor leader Diana -- many parallels between Visitors and 
     Nazis recur throughout the series.  Diana escapes and conquers earth 
     again, thanks to the Vichy collaborators -- umm, I mean Scientific 
     Frontiers Corp. which manufactures the red dust, and is led by immoral 
     Nathan Bates.  TV anchor Mike Donovan -- who had broken the story on 
     the Visitors' evil nature -- leads the resistance, with the help of 
     scientist Julie, plus Elias and Ham.  Their headquarters was the Club 
     Creole.  They were aided by a turncoat Visitor Willie, and a woman 
     named Robin who had had an affair with an alien and given birth to a 
     semi-alien baby, a preposterously absurd idea to anyone who has a clue 
     about evolutionary biology.  The impossible halfbreed ages rapidly to 
     become Elizabeth, the key to the Visitors' destruction, along with 
     Nathan Bates' son Kyle, and a vistor faction leader named Lydia.  
     Charles, Lt. James and Martin were Visitor officers sympathetic to the 
     humans -- you know, nice Nazis.  Peace between humans and Visitors is 
     somehow achieved on Earth, while Elizabeth and an infatuated Kyle 
     head for the Visitors' home world, to foment what, we never find 
     out.  Willie "goes native" and decides to stay on Earth.

Venus On The Half Shell, Nickelodeon, 1998

     Vonnegut.
Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, ABC, 14 Sep 1964-15 Sep 1968
     Based on Irwin Allen's 1961 feature film of the same name, which 
     itself was heavily derived from Jules Verne's "20,000 Leagues Beneath 
     the Sea", this depended on the "Seaview" submarine and its crew the 
     same way that "Star Trek" depended upon the "Enterprise" and its 
     crew.  The Seaview had a glass nosecone, similar to the breast-domes 
     of Barbarella's spacesuit, allowing great viws of undersea wonders by 
     all, said wonders being both earthly and extraterrestrial.
          Retired Admiral Harrison Nelson had dreamed up the Seaview -- 
     making him a sort of Hyman Rickover -- who now runs the top secret 
     Nelson Institute of Marine Research at Santa Barbara, a cross between 
     the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, JPL, and Naval Intelligence.  
     It was set in the then-future 1970s.  Seaview had a sister ship, 
     "Polidor", which sank in episode #3.  Harrison Nelson's chief 
     assistant, and Seaview Commander, was promoted to Commander Lee Crane, 
     and (in season #2) to Captain.  In the real-life 1970s, the brainy 
     assistant to Rickover was one Jimmy Carter, who wrote a Naval 
     Postgraduate school thesis on the detection of targets by towed 
     underwater arrays of microphones.  This real-life Jimmy Carter once 
     saw a UFO after a few more drinks than usual at the Officers' Club, 
     and swore that he'd tell all on becoming president, but I digress.
          In season #2, more hardware was added, such as the two-man "Sea 
     Crab" minisub, and the "Flying Fish" a submarine which could fly 
     (didn't Tom Swift, Jr. have something like that?).  A surfer-dude Stu 
     was added to the cast, and the show held onto a large audience share 
     regardless of how preposterous the villians were in each episode, 
     including an amusingly over-the-top Professor Multiple (Vincent 
     Price) and his living puppets.  Other bad guys included blobs, ghosts, 
     lobster-men, mummies, pirates, robots, and intelligent seaweed.  What, 
     no "revenge of the samuri sushi?"

Voyagers, NBC, 3 Oct 1982-31 July 1983
     Juvenile/educational science fiction about two time travellers making

     from Poul Anderson's "Time Patrol").  When his Way-back, I mean "Omni", 
     breaks down, Time Cop Phineas Bogg's history book is eaten by 
     Manhattanite Jeffrey Jones' dog.  Fortunately, young Jones knows lots 
     of history, and kids in the audience were encouraged to go to the 
     library to find out more.  Not a bad idea, if it ever worked.

The Wild Wild West, CBS, 17 Sep 1965-7 Sep 1970
     James Bond meets Gunsmoke.  James T. West (not to be confused with 
     James T. Kirk) was a secret agent for President Ulysses S. Grant, in 
     real life the military genius who boozed his way through the White 
     House, surrounded by corrupt aides, went bankrupt, and wrote the best 
     Presidential autobiography ever -- for the money.  James T. West's 
     focus was the alarming number of revolutionary, radical, criminal, and 
     anarchist groups constantly plotting to take over America.  
          Assisted by Secret Service Agent Artemus Gordon, master of 
     disguise, they travelled by special railroad car equipped with the 
     tools and materials needed to make a vast array of gadgets and gizmos.  
     James T. West's nemesis was the brilliant but irrevocably evil Dr. 
     Miguelito Loveless.  Sometimes rose from anachronistically daffy to delightful.

Wine of India, BBC, 1970
     TV movie by Nigel Kneale, similar to Larry Noven story

     transplants.

The Wizard, CBS, 9 Sep 1986-7 July 1987
     Simon McKay was a professional toy inventor, but as a hobby, he 
     created devices to help the handicapped, assisted the government 
     spymasters, and helped the downtrodden with ingenious gadgets and 
     kindliness.  Government agent Alex Jagger was supposed to keep an eye 
     on him, and act as bodyguard as they circled the globe on a 
     combination of charity and intrigue.
          This was the promising show starring David Rappaport, the 
     four-foot-tall actor with a heart of gold, witty and exuberantly 
     talented.  After this show failed to be renewed, David Rappaport was a 
     continuing character on "L.A. Law."  Divorced, abandoned by his 
     girlfriend, and repeatedly jerked around by the network (which kept 
     promising him another series, and then breaking its promise), David 
     Rappaport committed suicide.  One could say that he really died of a 
     broken heart.
          I, webmaster Jonathan Vos Post, was uncredited co-author/rewriter 
     of the most popular episode ever, written by Stephen Barnes.  This 
     episode was a twist on Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, 
     involving a robot who loses consciousness and awakens with a bloody 
     arm -- and a dead man on the floor.  I created the motive, the means, 
     and the resolution, and got nothing out of this except for the 
     character in that episode named "Dr. Post."  My wife (who really does 
     have a Ph.D.) spotted David Rappaport poolside at the Roosevelt Hotel 
     in Hollywood during a Science Fiction Writers of America Nebula Awards 
     banquet, engaged him in conversation, and sent him over to talk to the 
     fiction editor of Omni Magazine (Ellen Datlow) and others.  
          SFWA President Charles Sheffield invited David Rappaport to give 
     a keynote address at the awards banquet.  He improvised the most 
     intelligent and entertaining talk I've ever heard given to this group.  
     To this day, I wonder if his agent ever forwarded the invitations we 
     mailed to him, in an effort to cheer him up during the bleak final days 
     of his life.

     provided important information in "Science Fiction: fran begynnelsen till 
     vara dagar", commissioned by Radio Sweden, and published in 1969.  The

<A NAME="COUNTRIES-AUSTRALIA"><STRONG><H3>AUSTRALIA</H3></STRONG></A>
Australia is a major player in the world of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and 
Horror.  "A Checklist of Australia Fantasy" by S. L. Lanarch (Sydney, 
Futurian Press, 1950) has a good outline through about 1938.

A more comprehensive Australian bibliography by Sean McMullen is available 
on the Web:
     <A HREF="http://www.midnight.com.au/eidolon/">Sean McMullen's Australian Bibliography</A>

19th Century Australian science fiction seemed, to this compiler, to 
heavily feature "Lost Land" and "Yellow Peril" subgenres.

Erle Cox was the best-known author of the 1920s, especially for "Out of the 
Silence" (1925).  

In the 1930s and early 1940s, a number of authors rose to prominence:
     A. Connell
     B. C. Cronin 
     J. Heming
     Vol Molesworth.  
     
In the late 1940s and 1950s, writers of note appeared, including:
     F. Bryning
     N. Heming
     Wynne Whiteford

The 1960's brought to notice:
     John Baxter
     Damien Broderick
     R. Braddon
     F. Cusak

Some of its best-known authors at some point emigrated to Great Britain, 
including:
     G. Boothby
     F. Hume
     V. Knowles
     J. M. Walsh

Current authors include:

According to the "Sao Paulo Letter" of Walter Martins (Amazing Stories, 
Sep 1968), Brazilian science fiction was triggered by Portugese 
translations of Jules Verne in the early 1900s, and H. G. Wells in the 
1930s.

In the 1930s, a Brazilian equivalent of Tarzan appeared: "Terramarear."  
There were also Emilio Salgari's fantastic pirate stories, and space 
fiction by J. Aragon and Gustav Le Rouge.

In the 1950s there was a groundbreaking anthology, "Wonders of Science 
Fiction" edited by Mario da Silva Brito, featuring American authors.
The popularity of this led to the "Colecao Argonauta" series of paperbacks.

Several publishing houses print science fiction, including:
     Cia. Editora Nacional
     Gertrum Carbeiro
     Edameris
     GRD
     Edart
     Von Schmidt

Canada is one of the world's science fiction superpowers, with visibility 
only slightly reduced by being in the glare of the United States.  This 
relativity is illustrated by there being some 45 Canadian members of 
Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America.  Therefore, until recently, 
many Canadian authors depended for the most part on sales to magazines and 
book publishers to the south, or to British publishers.

Some Canadian SF authors defected to the United States, including A. E. 
van Vogt.  Some Americans moved up to civilization, including William 
Gibson.

Particularly notable current Canadian SF authors include:
     Michael Coney

Rene Rebetez-Cortes is arguably the best-known Colombian science fiction

Hartwell comments "Like Japan, the Spanish-speaking world has no 
indigenous tradition of science fiction."  I strongly disagree, and suggest 
checking the entry for Mexico as a counter-example.  

In any case, Hartwell continues: "But in the Hispanic countries, especially 
in South America, the school of magical realism has had significant impact 
on world literature since the 1960s.  This story, by Rene Rebetez-Cortes, a 
Colombian, was fist published in 1972 and represents a speculative 
approach to the fantastic present and future.  It is as near a relative of 
science fiction as one finds in Spanish literarture today... what the 
defenders of literary SF prefer to call speculative fiction..."

The medieval legend of Rabbi Low of Prague and his android --er, golem-- 
puts Czechoslovakia at the center of science fiction and fantasy, right?

Two major Czech authors listed in the authors section of this web page are:
     Karel Capek
     J. Nesvadba

Capek's "R.U.R." (1920) was the play (first performed in 1921) that launched 
a thousand robot novels, and the word "robot" itself, 
and "War with the Newts" was both an attack on fascism 
and the ultimate conquest-of-Earth story.

Joseph Nesvadba (1926-) Czech doctor/psychiatrist/translator/playwright
     with highly regarded science fiction fantasy short stories

The January 1997 issue of the American "Magazine of Fantasy & Science 
Fiction", pages 124-160, features the fiction of a Czech author:
Vilma Kadleckova.  The story, "Longing for Blood", was translated from 
Czech to English by M Klima and Bruce Sterling (through drafts sent back 
and forth over the internet) after Bruce Sterling stayed at the Prague 
apartment of Vilma Kadleckova and her husband Martin Lima (a former 
Physicist).  Vilma Kadleckova has published four books in Czech, and was a 
winner of the Karel Capek award for her fiction.

The story "Captain Nemo's Last Adventure" by Josef Nesvadba, translated by the 
Iris Urwin, appears (pp.392-414) in "The World Treasury of Science Fiction", edited by David G. 
Hartwell, Boston: Little Brown, 1989 (and released by Book of the Month 
Club).  

Hartwell comments "A leading European science fiction writer, Josef Nesvadba 
is a doctor as well as a psychiatrist and the heir to Karel Capek.  Nesvadba 
has been the only internationally recognized Czech SF writer, with two 
collections of short fiction translated into English, VAMPIRES, LTD. and 
IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN.  First published in 1964, 'Captain 
Nemo's Last Adventure' is a tour-de-force gesture of homage to the SF 
adventure story of the [John] Campbell era and a satire of the Campbellian 
aspirations worthy of Fritz Leiber or Cyril M. Kornbluth.
     "Nesvadba uses the tropes and conventions of genre SF, especially the 
pulp SF of the 1940s, in a way that shows detailed knowledge of them, 
and then undercuts them.... Nesvadba's irony makes the story a work of 
criticism of the most rigorous yet affectionate sort.  He has, 
unfortunately, written no science fiction novels, although one of his two 
novels, a mystery, parodies some of the ideas of Erich Von Daniken."

The Finnish epic "Kalevala" is one of the sources of all modern fantasy and 
science fiction.  It includes, for example, a plot thread about a 
homunculus, similar to the Jewish "Golem" legend, and thus an ancestor of 
Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein", which is inarguably science fiction.

Tove Jansson wrote and illustrated a remarkable series of "Moomin" books,
which are certainly Fantasy.  Written in the Swedish language, these 
bestselling books are psychologically deeper than most juveniles, and have 
their fantastic creatures coping with change, which is more a science 
fictional than a fantasy style.

<A NAME="COUNTRIES-FRANCE"><STRONG><H3>FRANCE</H3></STRONG></A>
The case can be made that science fiction began in France, with Jules 
Verne.  

Verne was born in Nantes, France, on 8 February 1828.  He died in Amiens, 
France, on 24 March 1905.  In between these dates, he was surely, as Isaac 
Asimov says, "the first writer to specialize in science fiction and to 
make a living at it, too." [Asimov on Science Fiction, p.158]

Verne plumbed planetary depths -- "Journey to the Center of the 
Earth" (1864); fired people to the Moon from Florida -- "From the Earth to 
the Moon" (1865); and had a mad scientist conquer the oceans -- "20,000 Leagues 
Under the Sea" (1869).

Verne had a mad scientist orbit the earth atmospherically in "Robur the 
Conqueror" and "Master of the World"; create a utopia -- "The Mysterious 
Island"; explore conflicts between supercities -- "The Begum's Fortune";
and make cities fly -- "Propellor Island."

An important futuristic utopian novel was "L'an 2440, reve s'il en 
fut jamais" by Louis-Sebastian Mercier (London & Amsterdam: chez Van 
Harrevelt, 1771).  Other famous authors who had some works in the science/fiction 
fantasy genre include:
     Honore de Balzac ("Louis Lambert", 1833)
     Cyrano de Bergerac: several ways for interplanetary travel, including 
         rockets (1657):
          Histoire comique des etats et empires de la Lune" (1648-1650)
          Histoire comique des etats et empires du Soleil" (1662)
     Camille Flammarion, astronomer, "La Fin du Monde" (1911) explores the 
          death of our world circa 10,000,000 A.D.
     Andre Laurie, "Les Exiles de la Terre" (1889) pulls the moon 
          magnetically to Earth
     Francois Rabelais, "Pantagruel" (1532-1564)

Voltaire's "Micromegas" features superbeings from other planets and stars, 
particularly a Saturnian and a Sirian.

Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) is considered by many literary scholars to be 
the true father of Science Fiction, and of the Mystery/Detective genre.  
Poe's translations into French by Baudelaire were crucial to the 
evolution of French symbolism, surrealism, and science fiction.

P. Versins is the main French science fiction bibliographer.  He lists 
dozens of important French science fiction books that have not, for the 
most part, been translated into English.  First, Versins recommends these 
general reference books:
     Charles-Noel Martin, "Les vingts sens de l'homme devant l'inconnu" 
          (Paris: Gallimard, "Aux Frontiers de la Science", 1958)
     Louis Pauwels & Jacques Bergier, "Le matin des magiciens",
          (Paris: Gallimard, 1960; available in English translation)

The story "The Valley of Echoes" by Gerard Klein, translated by Frank Zero, 
appears (pp.184-192) in "The World Treasury of Science Fiction", edited by David G. 
Hartwell, Boston: Little Brown, 1989 (and released by Book of the Month 
Club).  

Hartwell comments "...of the contemporary French SF writers, none is more 
distinguished than Gerard Klein, an SF editor for a French publisher, who 
has had several novels and stories translated into English, perhaps more 
work than any of his contemporaries.  'The Valley of Echoes', with its 
energetic shifts in person and tense, shows some of the stylistic devices 
that charcterize French SF and distinguish it from the English and 
American, which is almost invariably written in the past tense and most 
often in the third person.  French SF is more self-consciously literary 
than American SF usually is...."

The story "Party Line" by Gerard Klein, translated by Frank Zero, 
appears (pp.920-947) in "The World Treasury of Science Fiction", edited by David G. 
Hartwell, Boston: Little Brown, 1989 (and released by Book of the Month 
Club).  

Hartwell comments "Gerard Klein was the wunderkind of French SF at its 
inception in the 1950s.  His first story, heavily influenced by Ray 
Bradbury, appeared in 1955, when he was nineteen.  He published nearly 
sixty more in the next decade, in addition to becoming an influential 
critic with a series of thirty foreceful essays.  His early career was, 
however, as a government economist, which seems to have influenced the 
detailed background of 'Party Line.'
     "In 1969 he became the editor of an important publishing series that 
continues today, a series which supports developing talent in France while 
seeking out works in English for translation.  It is a pleasure to find 
stories such as 'Party Line' contributing to the international dialogue on 
time travel and time paradoxes."

The story "The Blind Pilot" by Nathalie-Charles Henneberg, translated by 
Damon Knight, appears (pp.250-265) in "The World Treasury of Science Fiction", edited by David G. 
Hartwell, Boston: Little Brown, 1989 (and released by Book of the Month 
Club).  

Hartwell comments "Nathalie-Charles Henneberg, who is Russian, met her 
Alsatian-German husband in Syria when he was in the French Foreign 
Legion.  They began writing SF in French in the 1950s, and until his death 
in 1959 they signed their collaborations with his name.... Nathalie went 
on to become a prolific novelist, the 'most read' French SF writer in 
France in the 1960s, according to [Damon] Knight.  This story bears an 
uncanny resemblance in atmosphere to the early works of the American writer 
Roger Zelazny, which it predates."

The story "The Dead Fish" by Boris Vian, translated by Damon Knight, appears 
(pp.679-689) in "The World Treasury of Science Fiction", edited by David G. 
Hartwell, Boston: Little Brown, 1989 (and released by Book of the Month 
Club).  

Hartwell comments "Boris Vian is a pivotal figure in the contemporary 
evolution of SF in France.  After World War II, like William Burroughs in 
the United States, he defended SF among the intellectuals.  He translated 
A. E. Van Vogt, the wildest, least polished, and most aggressively 
creative of the 1940 [John] Campbell writers, into French--as a matter of 
fact, into such literate clear style that for years U.S. fans scratched 
thir heads in confusion over the seeming contradiction of the popularity 
of Van Vogt and the literary respectability of SF in France.
     "Vian himself never wrote a specifically genre story.  He is 
represented here by a surrealist piece that is closely related to many of 
the works of such New Wave writers as langdon Jones and James Sallis in 
[Michael] Moorcock's NEW WORLDS, especially in the last, most experimental 
phases."

<A NAME="COUNTRIES-GREAT-BRITAIN"><STRONG><H3>GREAT BRITAIN</H3></STRONG></A>
British writers hold that all science fiction springs from the United 
Kingdom, and they cite at least 8 lines of descent to justify their 
crown.

The ghost story with believably complex mortals affected by the 
supernatural reached a never-exceeded high point in William Shakespeare's 
"Hamlet."  The very notion of super-intelligence challenging God himself, 
and failing tragically, was never better expressed than in John Milton's 
"Paradise Lost."

One line of ancestry for modern Science Fiction was the Gothic novel, 
starting with "The Castle of Otronto" (1765) by Horace Walpole (see Walpole 
in the Authors' segment of this web site).

Another line of descent begins with Sir Thomas More's "Utopia" (1516 in 
Latin, translated into English in 1551), which makes him not only a 
Christian saint, but an SF one as well.  
The antithesis, or Dystopian novel, belongs to Great Britian, with Aldous 
Huxley's "Brave New World" (1931) and George Orwell [Eric Arthur Blair]'s "1984"
(1949).  Huxley should not be thought of as merely dystopian, as he has 
said [in "Literature and Science]:
     Rooted as they are in the facts of contemporary life, the phantasies 
     of even a second-rate writer of modern Science Fiction are 
     incomparably richer, bolder, and stranger than the Utopian or 
     Millenial imaginings of the past."

A 4th line of descent is the cosmic-scale "hard SF", which is anchored 
in "Last and First Men" (1930) by Olaf Stapledon, the brilliant Cambridge 
professor of philosophy, who, in his epic 2,000,000,000 year sweep, was the 
direct acknowledged influence on the king of hard SF, Arthur C. Clarke.
"The Star Maker" (1937) by Stapledon went beyond even his own invention of 
the Galactic Empire, into a multi-cosmic techno-theological vision that 
anticipated todays scientific analysis of a universe before the Big Bang 
and of alternate universes with different natural laws.  Stapledon also 
invented "the Cosmic Mind", which Clarke revisited in his masterpiece 
"Childhood's End" (1953).  Sir Fred Hoyle also follows in this tradition, 
with "The Black Cloud" (1957) and "A for Andromeda."

A 5th line of descent is that of Time Travel.  I teach a course on 
this, and will later add some detailed notes to this web site, but everyone 
knows that H. G. Wells invented "The Time Machine" (1995).

Herbert George Wells is often considered the father of science fiction.  
Seminal works include "The War of the Worlds" (1898) and  "The Invisible Man " 
(1897) and {to be done}

A 6th line of descent is the social satire with science fictional 
elements, of which the greatest work is Jonathan Swift's "Gulliver's 
Travels" (1726).

A 7th line of descent is the literary reaction to the Industrial 
Revolution, which of course was born in Scotland and northern Englan by, 
say, 1800.  This in turn began with the foundations of modern science by 
Sir Isaac Newton.  Benjamin Disraeli's book "The Two Nations" (1845) 
examined the split between rich and poor, with upper and lower classes as 
essentially two nations on the same land, and this vision was further 
ramified by H. G. Wells' Eloi and Morlocks in "The Time Machine" (1895).

Finally, Brian Aldiss receives considerable support in claiming that Mary 
Shelley's "Frankenstein" (1818) was the first genuine science fiction 
novel.

<A NAME="COUNTRIES-GREECE"><STRONG><H3>GREECE</H3></STRONG></A>
The word "Fantasy" is from the Greek word for imagination, and one can 
claim that the imagination of Greek writers was the origin of all science 
fiction.

Greek myths from 2,000-5,000 years ago are essential to any history of 
Fantasy, and Lucian of Samosata (ca. 125 AD) wrote satires with definite 
science fiction elements.  For example, "Icaromenippos" includes Icarus 
flying to the Moon and adventuring with its inhabitants.  Lucian's "A True 
Story" is both a parody of the fantasies and proto-science fiction tales of 
2,000 years ago, but includes the first space war in literature, a battle 
near the Moon.

Since Greek philosophy was the orgin of Science, Greece plays an ancesral 
role for all science fiction.  To pick an example almost at random, when 
Archimedes said "Give me a place to stand, and a lever long enough, and I 
shall move the Earth" he anticipated the entire planet-smashing 
solar-system reconfiguring style of science fiction in the sense of 
Asimov, Bear, Brin, and Clarke.

If we hold that Science Fiction is the literature of the search for Utopia, 
then we must begin our analysis with Plato's "Republic" -- the definitive 
utopia.  Of course, I would have been banned from The Republic, as I am a 
poet, and Plato considered such men dangerous to the social order.  By the 
way, the Republic was to have exactly 5,040 citizens, which some readers 
today would recognize as 7! = 1x2x3x4x5x6x7.  "Utopia" is derived from the 
Greek for "nowhere."

If science fiction is based on exotic travels, monsters, larger-than-life 
heros outwitting their foes, and technology indistinguishable from magic, 
then all must give credit to Homer's "Odyssey", some 2,500 years ago.

For that matter, Homer's "Iliad" is the basis of all realistic war fiction, 
including science fictional space battles.  And if the robot is a main icon 
of science fiction, then Greece deserves credit for inventing Hephaistos, 
god of the forge, in being assisted by women constructed of gold 
(as described in "The Iliad").  And did not Daedalus built the bronze 
warrior Talos?

It goes without saying that India has a nearly infinite set of mythologies 
and fables, which have been a source for fantasists and science fiction 
authors such as Roger Zelazny.  India (mostly from Bombay, or "Bollywood") 
is the world's #1 producer of motion pictures, many of which have a fantasy 
element.  The ancient "Veda" tales/poems can themselves be considered the 
roots of science fiction.

India benefited from British rule in the development of a 
world-class educational and scientific infrastructure.  India produced the 
greatest mathematician of our century, Ramanujan, and a couple of Nobel 
laureate physicists.  I myself used Chandrasekhar's textbook on stellar 
interiors, and we owe much of our understanding of Black Holes to him.

India is a space power, able to design, build, and launch its own 
satellites.  This is, in part, related to the fact that India is a major 
nuclear power with a geopolitically uneasy relationship to China and to 
Pakistan.

Donald H. Tuck says that the earliest serial of original science fiction 
published in the Hindu language was "Khagras" (Full Eclipse) by Acharya 
Chatursen Shastri, in a weekly magazine published by the "Times of India", 
namely "Dharmyug", starting on 30 August 1959, and dealing with the 
Russians winning the manned Moon race.

<STRONG>JEWS AND JEWISH SCIENCE FICTION:</STRONG>

Mark Twain wrote: "If the statistics are right, the Jews constitute but 
one percent of the human race.  It suggests a nebulous dim puff of star 
dust lost in the blaze of the Milky Way.  Properly the Jew ought hardly to 
be heard of; but he is heard of, has always been heard of.... He has made 
a marvelous fight in this world, in all the ages; and he has done it with 
his hands tied behind him."

But what is a Jew?  A person is known to be Jewish if his or her mother 
was Jewish, and we know that each cell in your body has Mitochondria with 
their own DNA, and that such Mitochondria are entirely passed from 
generation to generation by maternal descent.  Does that mean that 
Jewishness has something to do with Mitochondrial DNA?

Is Jewish science fiction and fantasy based on religion, myth, the Old 
Testament, kinship, Kabala and Jewish mysticism, ethics, character, 
or some combination of any and all of these, plus "an indefinable 
essence" [Franz Rosenzweig]?

THE LEGEND OF THE GOLEM

The medieval legend of Rabbi Moreynu Ha-Rav Low of Prague and his android 
--er, golem-- puts Judaism at the center of science fiction and fantasy.  The story is 
that Rabbi Low created the Golem out of clay in order to protect persecuted 
Jews.  This story was one of the origins of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein", 
arguably the first true science fiction novel, and of Karel Capek's play 
"R.U.R." which gave us the word "robot."

The Golem's creation did not usurp God's creation, but was done with His 
permission.  It was an automaton transfused with Life, to act as an 
instrument of the will of God, and for the benefit of humanity.  Rabbi Low 
wrote, upon its forehead, the Hebrew word "Shem" -- the principle of Life.

Although the Golem grows, physically and in power, and becomes increasingly 
frightening even though behaving usefully, people can always "pull the 
plug" by erasing the sacred word [the world's first read-only memory?].  
At the conclusion of the story, the Golem goes insane (like the HAL 9000 
computer in Arthur C. Clarke's "2001: A Space Odyssey").  The "Shem" is 
erased, and the Golem collapses into a pile of inanimate clay.

ASSIMILATION, JUDAISM, AND SCIENCE FICTION

A central cultural conflict for over 5,000 years has been the tension 
between the Jew adhering rigorously to Jewish culture and the Jew 
assimilating into the culture of the kingdom or country in which he or she 
lives and works.

Again and again, there were Babylonian Jews who considered themselves 
primarily Babylonian, and were shocked to be enslaved.  There were Egyptian Jews 
as powerful as Moses who considered themselves to have some allegiance to 
the Pharoah, and had to humble themselves before the will of God as a 
result.  German Jews were astonished when the Nazis denied them their 
sincere participation in German culture, and those who were not 
slaughtered in the world's worst genocide and who fled to Great Britain were 
astonished again that they were interred by the British as being 
considered more German than Jewish.

London, Paris, Berlin, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles -- great Jewish 
communities live in uneasy double identity.  Urbane, sophisticated, 
modern, and assimilated into the local, regional, and global culture, and 
yet always marked as separate, as different, as rooted to a unique 
heritage.

Science Fiction deals again and again with this kind of double life.  To be 
a person AND a mutant, a person AND an android, a person AND a telepath, a 
person AND an extraterrestrial.  Do these themes not reverberate with the 
question of Jewish identity?  Is not the Jew the quintessential Alien?  
From another world, with another language, of a foreign culture, often 
wildly misperceived by the indigenous "goyim", the Gentile, as incomprehensible, 
threatening, dangerously intelligent?

Does not the Science Fiction theme of global destruction, of the Earth 
destroyed by monsters, weapons, invaders, aliens, or nuclear fire reflect 
the blinding glare of the furnaces of Auschwitz-Birkenau, Belzec, Chelmo, Majdanek, 
Sobibor, Treblinka?  Are not the monsters, the aliens, but a sliver of the 
antisemitic horror that lurks within the human neighbor?

What is the myth of the Wandering Jew, but the story of exile and the 
Diaspora writ small?  Is not every astronaut displaced as is the Jew who 
has left his or her homeland for the unknown?

As Albert Goldman has written, "Jewishness itself has become a metaphor 
for modern life.  The individual Jew -- the ALIEN in search of identity -- 
has become a symbolic protagonist."

KABBALAH AND SCIENCE FICTION

Jewish writings and tradition seem split between the patiently, 
legalistically, and hair-splittingly rational -- as embodied in Torah and 
its voluminous commentaries -- and the magical, mystical, fantasical, 
transcendental, the world of angels and Dybbuks.

The latter branch is centered on Kabbalah, a tremendously sophisticated 
body of magic, divination, superstition, and metaphysical philosophy.  
Kabbalah is too interesting to be analyzed here, although hotlinks will be 
added later {to be done}.  

Kabbalah deals with a secret order and structure to the universe.  It is 
tied to sorcery performed by the intervention of angels and demons.  There 
are ten orders of angels in the alternate universe world of Yetzirah.  
There are also dead "imperfect" worlds which are the source of evil and 
evil spirits.  These evil worlds were created also by God, but even God 
could not completely destroy his own works, but only modify them.

Kabbalah often hinges upon the fact that Hebrew numbers and Hebrew letters 
are the same symbols, and therefore an identity or correspondence exists 
between words and numbers.  This is the mystical basis for NUMEROLOGY, and 
is one of the manipulative and interpretive aspects of acrostics, anagrams, 
gemetria, and noutricon.

Kabbalistic numerology gave birth to secular and hermetic European 
numerology.  The basic premise is that God created two great books: the 
book of WORDS (the ten commandments, the five key books of the Old 
Testament, etcetera), and the book of NATURE.  To the enlightened mind, 
these two books are identical.  "As above, so below."

Science Fiction too attempts to combine the rational (science) and the 
irrational (fiction).  Science Fiction too places great emphasis on the 
power of numbers, with equations replacing magical spells as the source of 
strength.  Science Fiction too attempts to link the world above, the 
heavens, the stars and galaxies, with the world below where we the readers 
are tied to mundane reality.  We have feet of clay, but our eyes are fixed 
upon the stars.

JEWS, HUMOR, AND SCIENCE FICTION

Jewish culture is known for its wealth of humor.  Many of the best comic 
writers, playwrights, television writers, filmmakers, and stand-up 
comedians are Jewish.  Jack Dann describes Jewish humor as based on 
"insecurity, discomfort, frustration, hypocrisy, nostaligia... satire, 
ironic self-mockery, and exaggeration.  It is both a foil and a shield, an 
effective armor against a hostile society."

Who but a Jew can best poke fun at the stereotype of the Jew-as-victim?  
Yiddish gives us the very words for the quintessential guilty but non-heroic 
character, the born loser, the repressed patsy, the passive milquetoast, 
the inadequate alienated inferior: shlemiel, shlimazel, shlub, shlump, 
shmendrick, shmo, shlepper, and shnook.

Is not humorous Jewish fiction parallel to Science Fiction is what Jack 
Dann calls "a natural propensity to exaggerate and twist reality--the kind 
of fancy that soars to the logical end of the ludicrous, that attacks and 
promotes itself under an umbrella of cynicism and resignation"?  The 
Yiddish word for nuts, crazy, absurd, extravagant is "meshugge", a meshugge 
person is a "meshiginah" and the bizarre behavior performed is "mishegoss."

Is it any wonder that the greatest writer of humorous science fiction, 
Robert Sheckley, is Jewish?  

Is it any wonder that the science fiction magazine which printed the 
greatest number of humorous (and often sociologically comic) stories was 
"Galaxy", edited by Horace L. Gold, whom Isaac Asimov described as "that 
excellent writer ... who is as Jewish as stuffed kishke ... [but who] 
wrote outstanding science fiction for years under the name of Clyde Crane 
Campbell"?

Is there not a kinship between Science Fiction's horrors and jokes and the 
wonderful ingenuity of the Borscht Belt comedians, Rube Goldberg's 
intricate and absurd inventions, the iconoclasm of the Marx Brothers, the 
wit of S. J. Perelman?

<A NAME="COUNTRIES-ITALY"><STRONG><H3>ITALY</H3></STRONG></A>
An historic figure who had the essential vision of science fiction, and who 
has been the subject of science fictionalexamination as a result, was 
Leonardo da Vinci.  One could claim that he was the first great science 
fiction author who illustrated his own works, and built the props.

Paradoxically, given the enormous role that Italy has played in the 
evolution of modern mathematics and science, Italy is often remembered for 
the Inquisitional execution of Giordano Bruno, who preached that there 
were an infinite number of worlds.  Bruno was arguably the father of the 
"alternate history" or "parallel worlds" genres, with his fatal suggestion 
that there must be a planet exactly like Earth, except that Mass was said 
in the vernacular rather than in Latin.  And of course, the house arrest
of Galileo can be seen as a sequel to this curious and terrible drama.

On the other hand, one could claim that Dante Alighieri
was the greatest science fiction/fantasy poet of all time
(Divina Commedia), whose influence extends far beyond his 
country and his genre.  This masterpiece was begun in 1307.

Similarly, one could claim that Ludovico Ariosto's "Orlando Furioso" 
(1516 & 1532), by including a chapter on Asdolf travelling to and having 
adventures on the Moon, made a transition from chivalric romances (based 
on legends of Charlkes the Great) to science fiction.

In a related genre, Byron and Shelley's friend J. W. Polidori's 
1819 story "The Vampire" was the main influence on Bram Stoker's 
"Dracula" (1897), so (through Polidori), Italy can claim kinship with 
Transylvania in launching the great vampire/horror boom which continues to 
this day.

Yet another argument gives precedence to Dominican fria Tomaso 
Campenella's "The City of the Sun" -- one of the key Utopian books.

The Italian anatomist Luigi Galvani, making the legs of dead frogs twitch 
when stimulated with electrcal sparks, was clearly the basis of the 
technical inspiration for Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein", which many hail 
as the first true SF novel.  Mary Shelley was also familiar with the work 
of the Italian scientist Volta.

Italo Calvino was arguably the greatest Italian science fiction 
("Cosmicomics") and fantasy author of this century.

<A NAME="COUNTRIES-JAPAN"><STRONG><H3>JAPAN</H3></STRONG></A>
So far as I can see, Japan does not split hairs in distinguishing between 
what America sees as distinct genres: animation, comics, fantasy, science 
fiction, horror, erotica, and mainstream literature.

For example, Osamu Tezula (1926-) was a suprstar for his creation of 
"Astroboy" -- not only the first animated TV series in Japan, but the 
first to be shown on Amrican TV as well.  Of course, "Japanimation" has 
evolved enormously since then, and split into many subgenres, including 
hard SF, space opera, fantasy, and the like.  Shotaro Ishimori was another 
Grand Old Man of SF art in Japan.

Helping science fiction along, Japan is a space power, with serious plans 
for its own space station (commercial, broadcast-oriented) and moon bases.  
I have had the pleasure of conversing with Japanese space scientists and 
roboticists; Japan can colonize the galaxy with or without the cooperation 
of the Euro-American nations!

Science Fiction fandom is big in Japan; it is just a matter of time before 
there is a World Science Fiction Convention in Japan.  I have had the 
honor of meeting the #1 fan in Japan: Takumi Shibano, but have heard of 
others, such as Norio Itoh and Koichiro Noda.  Japan has some of the best 
translators in the science fiction world such as Noriyoshi Saito and 
Hisashi Asakura.  Some science fiction is translated from English into 
Japanese in three columns: one a literal translation, one with phonetic 
explanation of key words, and one explanatory.  "Neuromancer" by William 
Gibson was said to be the most important such 3-column translation, with 
its rich textual poetics and cyberpunk coinages.  When Gibson was in 
Japan, he mailed me a copy of a Japanese edition of Playboy, with a column 
on himself.

Kobo Abe, one of my favorite authors, stands out for being one of the few 
inarguable science fiction authors to have won a Nobel Prize in Literature 
for his work, including "Ice Age 4" (1959) and "The Invention of R62" 
(1956).

Science fiction has been popular in Japan for well over a century, perhaps 
for as much as 120-150 years, with the influence of Jules Verne being 
particularly important.  The period between the two world wars was 
significant in the growth of home-grown science fiction, and World War II, 
of course, ended with Japan in the unenviably science fictional position of 
being the only victim of atomic war.  

The 1930s brought to attention:
     Takatoro Kigi (best known for Mystery titles)
     Komatsi Kitamura (also mainstream)
     Fuboku Kosakai
     Mushitaro Oguri
     Ikujiro Ran
     Juza Uno

Masami Fukushima (1929-) founded the Hayakawa book series and 
     also S-F Magazine

Important authors include:
     Kazumasa Hirai (1938-)
     Tadashi Hirose (1924-) mostly Mystery
     Shin'ichi Hoshi (1926-) short story master, popularized the term "SF"
     Ichiro Kano (mostly Mystery)
     Shigeru Kayama (mostly Mystery)
     Alan Kiodomari (1912-) primarily fantasy
     Sakyo Komatsu (1931-) futurologist/social critic
     Taku Mayumara (1934-)
     Yukio Mishima (although a world-famous mainstream author, "the 
          Hemingway of Japan", he wrote "Beautiful Planet" as well)
     Ryu Mitsuse (1928-) the Dave Brin of Japan?
     Jojiro Okami (mostly Mystery)
     Yo Sano (mostly Mystery)
     Masao Segawa (1931-), hard SF and juveniles
     Kyo Takikawa (mostly Mystery)
     Aritsune Toyota (1938-)
     Tasutaka Tsutsui
     Michio Tsuzuki (mostly Mystery)
     Tetsu Yano (1923-) I especially liked his "Paper Spaceship" as 
          translated by Gene van Troyer

(pp.92-103) in "The World Treasury of Science Fiction", edited by David G.

Club).  Hartwell comments "This story combines the fascination with 
monsters and a sensibility akin to that of Jorge Luis Borges or the magical 
realists -- or perhaps early [J.G.] Ballard.  As is common in Japanese SF, 
there is not the kind of narrative force or plot to hold the story 
together ... [but] a succession of set pieces leading up to a culminating 
image..."

There's a remarkable article by Professor Miguel Angel Fernandez-Delgado (a 
lawyer/historian/author in Mexico City) entitled " A Moon Voyage Inside an 
Astronomical Almanac in Eighteenth-Century Mexico."  Published in The New 
York Review of Science Fiction, Vol.9, No.1, September 1996, pp.17-18.

It strongly makes the case that Manuel Antonio de Rivas, a Fransiscan friar 
in Yucatan, wrote and published a science fiction story as a preface to his 
astronomical atlas of 1775.

This story, about a Frenchman named Onesimo Dutalon flying to the moon in 
some sort of machine, meeting with intelligent "Anctitones" (moon-men).  
The story also includes space demons carrying souls to a hell inside the 
sun.  The result?  Friar Rivas was charged with heresy, but granted mercy 
and set free.  

It seems fair, therefore, to declare Manuel Antonio de Rivas to be the 
father of Mexican Science Fiction!

Mexican science fiction seems to me to be schizoid, torn between the very 
popular comic book tradition and the highly intellectualized criticism of 
Octavio Paz and his colleagues.

As one Mexican president has said (in another context) "Alas, Mexico!  So 
far from God, so close to the United States."

And yet Mexico has a vibrant world-class literature, with science fiction 
being caught up in the flood stream of Magical Realism.

Mexico is a film and television powerhouse, with an uneasy connection to 
American media.  For many years in Hollywood, Mexican versions of American 
films were made on the same sets as the American films.  In at least one 
case (Dracula) the Mexican version is said to be superior.

Mexico City has a good shot at being the largest city in the world within 
this decade, a source of both utopian and dystopian speculation.  The 
split between rich and poor, with a techno-elite and a midle class being 
squeezed out by economic policy dictated from Washington and New York makes 
a Cyberpunk future seem to be present right now.

My bias is that I so much enjoyed visiting the Netherlands for the World 
Science Fiction Convention at the Hague.  In my all-too-few days in 
Holland, I saw a genuinely civilized country, so much so that I felt, upon 
returning to America, that I was stepping out of a utopia into a violent, 
dirty, irrational, and schismatic dystopia.

Also, I had ancestors living in Amsterdam, so that when I opened the 
telephone directory, I found a whole page of "Post" (pronounced "Poost") 
and a whole page of "Vos."

An important reference book on the science fiction of the Netherlands is:
     "100 Jaar SF in Nederland" by D. Scheepstra, (Harlingen:

The story "Pairpuppets" by Manuel Van Loggem, translated by the author, appears 
(pp.278-285) in "The World Treasury of Science Fiction", edited by David G. 
Hartwell, Boston: Little Brown, 1989 (and released by Book of the Month 
Club).  

Hartwell comments "Translated by its author from the Dutch, this story deals 
with one of the grand themes of modern SF, the future of love.... 
'Pairpuppets' is notably a plotted story, in the manner of, say, Robert 
Sheckley, influenced by by and written in imitation of American SF.  Dutch 
SF has developed in recent decades in constant reference to American SF and 
only under the influence of translations of the contemporary flowering of 
SF in English."

The story "The Lens" by Annemarie Van Ewyck, translated by the 
author, appears (pp.545-553) in "The World Treasury of Science Fiction", edited by David G. 
Hartwell, Boston: Little Brown, 1989 (and released by Book of the Month 
Club).  

Hartwell comments "It is interesting to contrast Van Ewyck's story with Van 
Loggem's [see above]; while the latter reflects the mood, tone, and 
concerns of primarily 1950s American SF, 'The Lens' seems more in tune with 
Anglo-American post-New Wave works.  It is darker, more heterogeneous in 
its influences (here a touch of [Ray] Bradbury or [Roger] Zelazny, there a 
touch of [James] Tiptree or [Theodore] Sturgeon).  And 'The Lens,' 
translated from the Dutch by its author, is told in the first person 
rather than in the conventional third.  The author is an active member of 
World SF, an international body, and she is a participant in fan activities 
internationally.

Bringsvaerd in Norway and Sam J. Lundwall in Sweden, sparked a renaissance 
of SF in Scandanavia with new translations, a publishing boom, and the 
encouragement of Scandanavian authors through story contests and 
anthologies.
    "Bringsvaerd, an important contemporary Norwegian writer, has 
published more than twenty works of nonfiction, drama, children's stories, 
novels and short fiction.
     "'Codemus,' written in 1967, shows the strong influence of the British 
New Wave.  At that time New Wave writers tended to number their 
paragraphs, as [J. G.] Ballard often did.  'Codemus' reverses a 
conventional 1960s plot; it is a mirror image of the repressive future 
society run by computers with everyman as the central character.  As with 
most non-English-language science fiction, there is nothing distincyively 
Scandanavian in the setting.  This is a boon to international 
communication at the outset, but it also means that Scandanavian SF has 
developed no distinctive traditions over its twenty-year history."

News flash!  3 October 1996: POLISH FANTASY POET WINS NOBEL PRIZE!

Wislawa Szymborska, a literary and political intellectual much beloved as 
the most popular poet in Poland, won the Nobel Prize in Literature on 3 
October 1996.  Although Czeslaw Milosz, Zbigniew Herbert, and Tadeusz 
Rozewicz are better known overseas, and have also been considered to be 
Nobel contenders, Wislawa Szymborska is closer to the hearts of many Poles, 
who regard her as a peoples' poet.  One can argue that she is the SECOND
Polish science fiction/fantasy author to win a Nobel prize, the first being
W. St.Reymont, a Nobel Laureate who also wrote a vampire novel.

But is Wislawa Szymborska really a Science Fiction or 
Fantasy poet as well?  Read these examples below, and judge for yourself.

     IN PRAISE OF FEELING BAD ABOUT YOURSELF
          by Wislawa Szymborska

     The buzzard never says it is to blame....
     When the piranha strikes, it feels no shame....
     
     Why should they when they know
     they're right?
     
     ...
     
     ON THIS THIRD PLANET OF THE SUN
     a clear conscience is Number One.

     IN PRAISE OF DREAMS
          by Wislawa Szymborska
          
     In my dreams
     I paint like Vermeer van Delft.
     
     I speak fluent Greek
     and not only with the living.
     
     I drive a car
     that does what I say.
     
     I am talented,
     I write epic poems.
     
     I hear voices
     no less often than saints do.
     
     You would be amazed
     at my skill in piano playing.
     
     I fly properly
     all by myself.
     
     Sliding off the roof
     I fall onto soft grass.
     
     I do not find it hard
     to breathe underwater.
     
     I cannot complain:
     I DISCOVERED ATLANTIS.
     
     It's a relief to wake up
     just before dying.
     
     I turn sideways comfortably
     when wars break out.
     
     I am, but am not forced to be,
     a child of this age.
     
     SOME YEARS AGO,
     I SAW TWO SUNS.
     
     And the day before yesterday a penguin.
     I saw it quite clearly.
     
          -- from "Views With a Grain of Sand"
          translated from Polish by Stanislaw Baranczak
          and Clare Cavanagh, copyright Harcourt Brace & Co.
     **********************************
     
Nobody can write about Science Fiction in Poland without mentioning 
Stanislaw Lem.  Lem bestrides Polish SF like a colossus, and his works are 
translated into many languages.  "Solaris" {hotlink to be done} was made 
into a very fine film by Tarkovski, distributed world-wide.  

Stanislaw Lem, interestingly enough, was friends as a young man with the 
priest who became the current Pope.  Oh, to have been a fly on the wall of 
the taverns where they drank beer and debated metaphysics!

Lem made some injudicious critical writings in English which essentially 
dismissed all English-language science fiction since H. G. Wells as 
philosophically uninteresting.  This resulted in the epic tempest in a 
teapot of expelling him from Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America, 
the only such expulsion fo which I know, which calls into question the 
American commitment to Free Speech.  But I digress...

Other notable writers include:
     J. Potocki (1761-1815)
     W. St.Reymont, a Nobel Laureate who also wrote a vampire novel.

<A NAME="COUNTRIES-RUSSIA"><STRONG><H3>RUSSIA</H3></STRONG></A>
A strong case can be made that Russian science fiction is second only to 
English-language science fiction in quality and quantity, and in many 
cases science fiction books sell in more copies in Russia than anywhere 
else.  Whether or not the authors get paid is another story.

Of course, the American intelligence forces, with time-scanners, saw the 
impact of young Isaac Asimov, and covertly paid his family's way over to 
Brooklyn, New York, to keep Russia from taking over the SF world.

Russia beat America into space with Sputnik, the definitive event that 
showed the world that science fiction dreams of spaceflight were now 
reality, and hammered home the point with the first man in space, Yuri 
Gagarin.

An important reference work on Russian SF is "Russian Science Fiction 
Novel" by Anatolij Britikov (Moscow: Nauka and the Soviet Academy of 
Sciences, 1970).

     Konstantin Tsiolkovski (father of the Spaceship AND Rusian space 
          fiction)
     Ilya Varshavsky
     I. A. Yefremov
     Evgeni Zamiatin

Eugene Zamiatin (1884-Mar 1937) [Evgeni Ivanovich Zamiatin] Russian 
    dystopian novelist, banned in the USSR, of the influential "We" (New 
    York: Dutton, 1924, tr. by Gregory Zilboorg) which surely influenced 
    George Orwell's "1984" -- a global state where people are denied names 
    and love.

The story "The Blind Pilot" by Nathalie-Charles Henneberg, translated by 
Damon Knight, appears (pp.250-265) in "The World Treasury of Science Fiction", edited by David G. 
Hartwell, Boston: Little Brown, 1989 (and released by Book of the Month 
Club).  

Hartwell comments "Nathalie-Charles Henneberg, who is RUSSIAN, met her 
Alsatian-German husband in Syria when he was in the French Foreign 
Legion.  They began writing SF in French in the 1950s, and until his death 
in 1959 they signed their collaborations with his name.... Nathalie went 
on to become a prolific novelist, the 'most read' French SF writer in 
France in the 1960s, according to [Damon] Knight.  This story bears an 
uncanny resemblance in atmosphere to the early works of the American writer 
Roger Zelazny, which it predates."

The story "I was the First to Find You" by Kirill Bulychev, translated by 
Helen Saltz Jacobson, appears (pp.690-700) in "The World Treasury of Science 
Fiction", edited by David G. Hartwell, Boston: Little Brown, 1989 (and released 
by Book of the Month Club).  

Hartwell comments "Among the most versatile and popular SF writers in the 
Soviet Union, Kirill Bulychev is one of a group of younger Soviet writers 
to emerge in the 1960s.  Above all, his talent for storytelling and his 
interest in human characters interacting with SF problems make him a 
particularly effective representative of recent Soviet SF.  The strain of 
utopianism remains strong in Eastern European SF and sinks many stories 
with didacticism, but Bulychev is able to sustain his delight in the 
wonders of the technological future, as in the days of [American 
editor/author] John W. Campbell.  And, of course, the influence of 
Campbell-style SF itself, in this case [A. E.] Van Vogt's 'Far Centaurus' 
is clearly present."

"Don Quixote" by Cervantes (1605) not only pounded the final nail into the 
coffin of chivalric fantasy, but also was an astonishingly 
ahead-of-its-time meta-fiction, in which the author encounters a character 
who claims to be the author.  In a sense, this was postmodernism over 350 
years early, and a true ancestor of modern science fiction.

Juan Maldonado, in his 1541 story "Somnium" ("The Dream") wrote a moon-trip 
science fiction story that is surely the first such known in Spanish.  
This is referenced in Miguel Aviles "Otros cuatro relatos utopicos en la 
Espana moderna.  Las utopias de J. Maldonado, Omnibona y El Deseado 
Gobierno" ("Another Four Utopian Storties in Modern Spain: The Utopias of 
J. Maldonado, Omnibona and The Desired Government") in "Las utopias en el 
mundo hispanico" (Utopias in the Hispanic World).

Jesus de Aragon was a popular action/adventure novelist of the 1930s who 
often had SF elements, including a Moon trip.

Gustavo Adolfo Becquer (1836-1870), poet and novelist, wrote a number of 
often-anthologized fantasy and weird short stories.

Enrique de Benito published a sequel to Jules Verne's "20,00 Leagues Under 
the Sea", namely "El hijo del Captain Nemo" and similarly Lazaro Clendobius 
published a sequel to H. G. Wells' "The Time Machine", namely "Elois y 
Morlocks" (1909).

Jose de Elola (1859-?)  was a scientist/soldier/author best known for the 
8 volume "Viajes Intrplanetarios en el siglo XXII."  His science writing 
influenced many Spanish SF authors.

Other significant SF writers in Spain include:
     M. A. Asturias
     E.S. Chapela
     F. M. Florez
     J. M. Gironella
     A. Robles
     Tomas Salvador, whose "La Nave" (1959) is similar to Heinlein's 
          "Universe", except that it turns into a science fiction poem!

<A NAME="COUNTRIES-SWEDEN"><STRONG><H3>SWEDEN</H3></STRONG></A>
Sweden may have the highest per capita science fiction readership and 
publication in the world.  There are nearly 2,000 original works of 
Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror in Swedish, and at least 4,000 Swedish 
translations of English-language and European works.

Sweden produced numerous works as precursors to modern science fiction, 
such as "Ny Upptackt av Landet Catacombe" [New Discovery of the Country 
Catacomb] by P. O. Fredell (Stockholm, 1780), and "The Subterranean 
Journey of Niels Klim" (1741).  On a related front, the famour naturalist 
Carl von Linne wrote about travel beyond the skies with metal spheres 
containing vacuums as superballoons, in "Iter lapponicum" [Journey through 
Lapland] (1732).

Sweden had a great SF boom at the turn of the century, perhaps kicked off 
by journalist Claes Lundin's novel "Oxygen och Aromasia--Bilder fran ar 
2378" [Oxygen and Aromasia--Pictures from the Year 2378] (Stockholm: Jos. 
Seligman, 1878).  Experts believe that this work comes dangerously close to 
plagiarising "Bilder aus der Zukunft", Kurd Lasswitz (Breslau, 1878).

Claes Lundin's novel "Oxygen och Aromasia--Bilder fran ar 2378" is not the 
typical utopian fantasy.  It features matter transmitters (as in "beam me 
up, Scottie"), space ships (very close to H. G. Well's "cavorite"-based 
"First Men on the Moon"), suspended animation, television-telephones, and 
weather control.

Nonetheless, in the decade before 1900 AD and the decade after, there were
roughly 300 original works of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror in Swedish, 
and at least 500 Swedish translations of English-language and European works.
Examples from this boom include the dystopian "Kallocain" by Karin Boyce, 
the classic epic SF poem "Lycksalighetens O" [The Island of Happiness] by 
Per Atterbom, and "Katastrophen" [Catastrophe] by Gustaf Jansson (1913).

As a result of this boom there were two very early science fiction 
magazines:
     Hugin (7 Apr 1916-Christmas 1919), edited/published by Otto Witt,
          arguably the world's first SF magazine, bi-weekly, circulation 
          10,000, letters to editor from Nobel laureate Svante Arrhenius, 
          only 2 complete sets known to exist, one of which is in the Royal 
          Library of Sweden
     Vetenskapen och Livet [Science and Life] (1916-1928), edited by 
          E. Thrall, which spread to a French and a Finnish edition

In the 1930s, one notable novel was "Ormus och Ariman" [Ormouz and Ariman] 
by Carl Jonas Love Almqvist (1930).

The best survey of Swedish science fiction that I know of is the 
"Bibliography of Science Fiction and Fantasy" by Sam J. Lundwall, 1964, 
which I believe has been updated in at least three editions.  He also 
provided important information in "Science Fiction: fran begynnelsen till 
vara dagar", commissioned by Radio Sweden, and published in 1969.  The 
English translation is "Science Fiction: What It's All About", Sam J. 
Lundwall, New York: Ace, 1971.

Lundwall points out that the popular Swedish folk song "Hjalmar och Hilda" 
actually derives from the sadistic Gothic novel "The Monk" (1796) by 
Englishman Matthew Gregory Lewis.

Other major Swedish authors and editors (besides those mentioned above) include:
     Roland Adlerberth, critic/translator
     Hans Arnold, international SF artist
     Hennig Berger
     Ann-Margaret Dahlquist-Ljunberg, "Stralen" [The Ray]
     Sven O. Emilsson
     P. C. Jersild
     Torsten Jungstedt, "Stors Skrackboken" [Huge Horror Book]
     Bjorn Karlstrom
     Denis Lindbohm
     S. Lonnerstrand
     Harry Martinson, "Aniara", book-length space/SF poem, which helped to 
          win Martinson a Nobel Prize!
     Henrik Nanne [under pseudonym "Carl Henner"]
     B. Nyberg
     Nils Parling, "Korset" [The Cross]
     Arvid Rundberg
     Gustav Sandgren [under pseudonym "Gabriel Linde"]
     Eugen Semitjov
     Bo Stenfors
     Olle Strandberg, "Kalla kara" anthology

Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) is considered by many literary scholars to be 
the true father of Science Fiction, and of the Mystery/Detective genre.  
Only this year doctors concluded that Poe died of rabies, contradicting 
earlier theories.  Poe's translations by Baudelaire were crucial to the 
evolution of French symbolism, surrealism, and science fiction.

"Amazing Stories", starting in April 1926 is belived by most experts to be 
the first true science fiction agazine, and its editor/publisher Hugo 
Gernsback is deemed the father of modern science fiction.

Edward E. Smith's "Skylark of Space" (1928) was the first genuinely 
interstellar novel.  Isaac Asimov explains:
     "For the first time in a science fiction magazine, man was whirled off 
     into the depths of interstellar space, with all the Universe open 
     before him.  For the first time, the reader had the chance to 
     visualize man as a creature of infinite capacity--man as God, almost."
          [Asimov on Science Fiction, p.190]

Unearth:
<A HREF="mailto:jml@rain.org">e-mail John M. Landsberg</A>
     Stories in 2 issues of F&SF, Universe 1 and 2 (Silverberg & Haber, eds.),
     and Full Spectrum 4 and 5. Creator/co-editor of UNEARTH, The Magazine of
     Science Fiction Discoveries, which first published William Gibson, James
     P. Blaylock, Craig Shaw Gardner, and others.  Also director of "Marrying
     Darcy", romantic comedy feature film.
         In the mid-70's, John M. Landsberg, Jonathan Ostrowsky, and Craig Shaw
     Gardner met in an adult education science fiction writing class taught by
     Hal Clement in Boston.  After the class ended, these three, being the most
     avid sf enthusiasts in the class, discovered that they wanted to remain in
     contact, and therefore established a writing group that met regularly at
     Ostrowsky's and Landsberg's apartments on Beacon Hill.  Landsberg soon
     revealed that he had a dream of creating a magazine that would be
     exclusively for unpublished writers, and Ostrowsky said, "Let's do it!" 
     And the die was cast.  Gardner was hesitant, but agreed to function as a
     contributing editor.
         Landsberg proposed a ground rule that the others seconded heartily: 
     They would not publish their own fiction; UNEARTH (as Landsberg named it)
     would never be viewed as a vanity mag.  Landsberg then proceeded to
     convince Hal Clement to write a science column for the magazine, and
     Harlan Ellison to write a writing column (Ellison was apparently convinced
     to sign on by Landsberg's chutzpah in even daring to ask him to
     contribute).  Landsberg then proposed the "First Sale" feature, which
     would reprint the first stories of major authors, with new intro's by the
     authors.
         And then Landsberg got into medical school in Albany, New York,
     leaving Ostrowsky to handle the Herculean day-to-day effort of actually
     running the thing.  While in medical school, Landsberg returned to Boston
     almost every weekend to help sift through stories, write copy, help with
     paste-up, or do whatever Ostrowsky told him needed to be done at the time. 
     An UNEARTH policy was that every submitted story received a personal
     response, never a form rejection (until much later when the number of
     submissions became gargantuan.)  Final decision on which stories saw print
     was shared equally between Ostrowsky and Landsberg; amazingly, they never
     encountered any serious disagreement in this area. 
         After publishing many writers who went on to success in sf, some of
     whom are now quite prominent, the ironic reality of UNEARTH's demise was
     that they couldn't come up with enough money to publish one more issue, at
     a time when advertising revenue from that issue should have been enough to
     put them at last into the black, after two years of hard work in the red.

<H1><CENTER>Prior Art Searches</CENTER></H1>

<P>Attention Patent Attorneys!  Have you a patent infringement suit that 
has technical problems?  Let Computer Futures team of experts help 
you find prior art by extending your search into libraries of private and 
public entities that contain documents that do not exist in any data base.  
Our consultants can search such libraries themselves, or we can enlist 
librarians, retirees and students to search under our directions.  Retired 
or senior librarians are usually best at searching their own holdings 
given proper guidance.  Our consultants are skilled in the particular art 
so that they do not depend on key words or abstracts:  unlike 
computer-based searchers they search whole papers and books.  Misleading 
titles on some documents can conceal useful information, but our 
consultants know not to omit anything that might help the search.</P>
<P>We locate prior art inventors and converse with them in their own 
technical language.  We can hire them to participate in problem solving or 
to invent new solutions to your problem, without disclosing confidential 
information about the client.</P>

<P>Computer Futures, Inc, will protect your clients' trade secrets 
through the use of a need to know basis, non-disclosure agreement searches, 
and public-knowledge-only searches.</P>

<P>No hourly rate or total dollar commitments will be made without the 
clients approval.  All our consultants are 1099 independent contractors.</P>

<TITLE>Patent Family Trees</TITLE>

<BODY>

<H1><CENTER>Patent Family Trees</CENTER></H1>

<P>A patent family tree is a series of charts showing the relationships 
between the different branches of patents that have been filed in a given 
field of technology, going back to the roots of the field, and forward to 
all the branches of possible future development.  These charts include 
information about strategies for planning products and controlling 
intellectual property; the key research personnel and companies; 
their competitors; and areas of related research.</P>

<P>The advantages of drawing up a patent family tree are many.  A company 
that undertakes to conduct this type of study of technology will find that 
it provides a clear picture to assist the decision-makers in their product
planning, prototype planning, the targetting of the most promising areas of
 R & D and identifying markets.  A patent family tree reduces the problem of 
"reinventing the wheel" and helps avoid patent infringements.  It is a good 
visual aid for informing and motivating employees.  It correlates patent 
information with the company's strategy, strengths, products and markets, 
and greatly assists in forming future strategies.</P>

<P>Computer Futures Inc. has a team of experts in a wide range of 
technologies who are experienced at doing the work of digging up the 
information to make a patent tree.  Ask us about our consulting rates.</P>

<HR>

Note that if you leave the query field blank, pressing "GO" will take
you to that search engine's home page.

<P>

To capture a SNARK for yourself, just save this document's HTML
source, clip out the <TT>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;...&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</TT> section
in the middle, and paste it into your own home page.

<P>

<HR>

It's easy to customize your SNARK's list of search engines.  Inside
the script, each engine is added with a command like this:

<PRE>
   Add("the Web: Yahoo!",
       "",
       "http://www.yahoo.com/",
       "http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=hunting+the+snark" );
</PRE>

The four components of an engine are its name, an option string
(usually empty), its home page, and its search URL.  To find an
engine's search URL, manually use that engine to perform a search for
the special string "<B>hunting the snark</B>".  If the URL of the
search results document contains the string
<tt>hunting+the+snark</tt>, then this engine can be added to your
SNARK following the example above.


<HR>


<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3></a>

<dl>

<p><dt>Why can't I see the SNARK forms?

<dd> Because you're not running a JavaScript-enabled version of
Netscape.  A Snark is completely invisible to non-JavaScript browsers.

<p><dt>Why's it called SNARK?

<dd> Because it's meant to help you hunt things down.  I guess it
should really be called Snark-Hunter.  <A
href="http://www.astro.indiana.edu/personnel/link/Snark.html">Lewis
Carroll poem</a>

<p><dt>Can SNARK interface to search engines that accept input via the
POST method?

<dd> No.  However, many search engines will accept both GET and POST
based queries.  To find out, save a local copy of the html page with
the engine's search form on it, and edit the <tt>&lt;FORM ...&gt;</tt>
tag to use <tt>method="GET"</tt> instead of <tt>method="PUT"</tt>.
See if a search with this newly-modified form works.  If so, you can
add this engine to SNARK.

<p><dt>Are there other SNARK'ish utilities out there?

<dd> Yes.  See 

<a href="http://vinny.csd.mu.edu/~howard/HY/">WebXSPUR</a> (uses
JavaScript + frames)

and <a href="http://www.eecs.nwu.edu/susi/cusi.html"> CUSI </a> (uses
CGI to same effect).

<H2><CENTER>Idiom of the Month</CENTER></H2>
<P>
Idioms beginning with "as"
<P>
<UL>
<LI><H3><STRONG>...AS FAR AS I KNOW...</STRONG></H3><P>
Using this phrase indicates that you do not have certain or complete knowledge about 
the statement which accompanies this idiom, but that you have the belief 
that your statement is true.  For example:<BR>
<STRONG>As far as I know, my neighbors have left for their vacation.<BR>
The contracts have been mailed to the attorney, as far as I know.</STRONG>
<H3> </H3><BR>
<LI><H3><STRONG>...AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED...</STRONG></H3><P>
<OL>
<LI>Using this phrase is a strong statement of opinion or feeling.  For 
example:<BR>
<STRONG>As far as I'm concerned, all the lawyers and politicians can go 
to hell.</STRONG><P>
<LI>Or, using this phrase in another way, it is a statement about a lack 
of personal interest in a matter.  For example:<BR>
<STRONG>You can send the package by surface or by air, as far as I'm concerned.  I 
don't care how it's sent.</STRONG>
</OL>
<H3> </H3><BR>

<LI><H3><STRONG>...AS FAR AS IT GOES...</STRONG></H3><P>
This is a very polite statement about something that is barely adequate.  
For example:<BR>
<STRONG>The new business plan is good, as far as it goes.</STRONG>  (Meaning, the plan is 
not extensive enough to cover the subject thoroughly.)

Last month's idiom: <P>
<H3><STRONG>GET OVER (...WITH),</STRONG> a verb, meaning:</H3>

<OL>
<LI>TO FINISH.  <STRONG>Jose worked fast to get his test over with. </STRONG>  (He worked

<LI>TO PASS OVER.  <STRONG>It was hard to get over the muddy road.</STRONG> (It

<LI>TO GET WELL FROM; RECOVER FROM.  <STRONG>The manager returned to work after he 
got over his illness.</STRONG></LI><P>
<LI>TO ACCEPT OR FORGET SOMETHING SUCH AS A TRAGIC EVENT OR A SURPRISE.  <STRONG>It 
is hard to get over the death of a family member.</STRONG>  (It is difficult to 
forget one's sorrow when a family member dies.)  <STRONG>We could not get over 
some of our co-workers winning the lottery.</STRONG>(We were 
surprised for a long time because one of our co-workers had such good luck 
as to win the lottery.)</LI><P>
<LI>TO COMMUNICATE SO AS TO BE UNDERSTOOD.  <STRONG>The sales manager got 
over to her staff that they'd all be fired if sales didn't improve.</STRONG>
(The manager made the staff understand her strong feelings in the matter.)

HISTORY AND MISSION OF THE PERSONAL ENGLISH COMPANY
</CENTER></H3>

The Personal English Company, based near Los Angeles in Sierra Madre, 
California, U.S.A., was founded in 1984 to provide advanced English language 
training and materials to foreign-born professionals working in American 
public and private sector organizations.  A wide variety of English language 
video and audio taped materials are now available.  The design and content of 
these materials is based on more than a decade of intensive research into 
the unique needs of professional men and women who speak English as a second 
language.  Persons from many different professions have benefitted from PEC's 
language programs and tapes: engineers; data processing and information systems 
professionals; doctors, nurses, and medical technicians; bankers; 
administrators and managers of public and private companies; diplomats; 
foreign businessmen and  businesswomen; secretaries and clerical professionals.

Founder and president, <STRONG>Charlotte Blackmon Collins</STRONG>, English 
Language Specialist, 
is a professional trainer and consultant to numerous local, regional, 
national
 and international companies and government agencies.  With a background in
 business education, teaching English as a second language, and 
intercultural studies, she founded The Personal English Company in 1984 
after noting the  lack of English language training programs and materials 
for foreign-born
 professionals who hoped to advance in their careers.  She observed that
 technically competent professionals became stuck at a level below their 
 true potential -- and were unable to achieve promotions into management  
-- because of English language deficits in pronunciation, vocabulary and 
 writing.  During 12 years of dedicated study and observation, she has 
 produced and published English language audio and video tapes designed 
 to ensure professionals career advancement through improved 
pronounciation of Standard American English and extensive vocabulary  
development in common and technical vocabularies.

OBJECTIVE:	

World's first Consulting Detective.  Working for the love of my art
rather than for the acquirement of wealth.  My professional charges are
upon a fixed scale.  I do not vary them, save when I remit them altogether.

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE:

1878			Began professional career as a detective
1882			Began professional partnership with Dr. Watson no
				later than this date
1878 - 1889		Investigated some 500 cases "of capital
				importance"
1878 - 1891		Investigated 1000 cases in all
late 80s - Apr 91	Devoted to exposing & breaking up criminal
				organization of Prof. Moriarty
1894			Returned to active practice
1894 - 1901		Handled hundreds of cases
1895			Private audience with Queen Victoria, for services
				to England
June 1902		Refused offer of knighthood
1903 - 1904		Began retirement in solitude of Sussex coast,
				reviewing the records of cases and the destruction
				of those which might compromise more exalted
				clients.  "The approach of the German war caused
				him, however, to lay his remarkable combination of
				intellectual and practical ability at the disposal of
				the government" with the result of communicating
				much false intelligence to the Germans, and arrest
				of Prussian spymaster Von Bork

CHARACTER:

&#164; "Dual nature" of personality: "Nothing could exceed his energy when the 			  
working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize 			  
him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, 			  
hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night."
&#164; During these moods, alternated "between cocaine and ambition, the 			  
drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature", 			  
then an even blacker depression took him in reaction to the narcotics, 			  
from which he could only be rescued by a case
&#164; His own powers became irksome when not in use: "My mind rebels at 			  
stagnation", and he chafed and brooded over "the insufferable fatigues 			  
of idleness"
&#164; "My mind is like a racing engine, tearing itself to pieces because it is 			  
not connected up with the work for which it was built"
&#164; "Animal lust for the chase: "The man is nothing, the work everything"
&#164; "Work is the best antidote to sorrow"; "a change of work is the best
rest"

APPEARANCE AND CONSTITUTION:

&#164; Tall, thin; narrow face, large forehead, black hair, brows dark & heavy
&#164; Nose thin, hawk-like; lips thin, firm; voice quick, high, strident
&#164; Eyes gray, sharp, piercing, taking on "far-away introspective look"
&#164; Seldom take exercise for its own sake, yet "always in training"
&#164; A good runner; possessed of strength which one would hardly credit
&#164; "I am exceptionally strong in the fingers"; "grasp of iron"
&#164; Few men were capable of greater muscular effort
&#164; "An abnormally acute set of senses"; "extraordinary delicacy of touch"
&#164; "Frugal"; habits "simple to the verge of austerity"; "Idleness exhausts
me completely" yet from time to time spend whole days in bed
&#164; Late riser as a rule "save upon those not infrequent occasions when he 			  
was up all night" during which up early on a case, vigorous and untiring, 			  
going for days or even a week without rest
&#164; Diet, spare at the best of times, abandoned altogether when working
&#164; "I am a brain, Watson.  The rest of me is a mere appendix."
&#164; State of health "not a matter in which he took the faintest interest."
&#164; Wiry, iron constitution; suffered breakdown from nervous prostration in 			  
Spring 1887; ordered to take complete rest in March 1897 due to 			  
"constant hard work of a most exacting kind, aggravated, perhaps, by 			 
occasional indiscretions of his own"
&#164; In retirement, somewhat crippled by occasional bouts of rheumatism
&#164; Took up swimming, nonetheless; little or no knowledge of amateur
sports
&#164; Baritsu (Japanese self-defense); boxing expert; excellent swordsman; 			  
enjoy fishing in the Broads near Donnithorpe; knowledge of golf clubs; 			  
singlestick expert 

PUBLICATIONS:

&#164; Author of a number of monographs, all of them on technical subjects
&#164; Upon the Distinction Between the Ashes of the Various
Tobaccos
&#164; Monograph on polyphonic motets of Lassus, printed for private 			  
circulation, said by some experts to be the last word on the subject

<P><H3><CENTER>HAVE YOU CONSIDERED MEDIATION TO SETTLE YOUR DISPUTE?</CENTER></H3></P>
<BR>


<P> Unlike arbitration, mediation is a voluntary process and does not 
involve a formal evidentiary hearing or result in a binding decision.  
Instead, all parties or disputants agree to the appointment of an 
experienced mediator.  After all sides explain their positions in the 
presence of a mediator and one another, the mediator meets privately with 
each party to discuss the strong and weak points of their cases, the risks 
of arbitration, and how the problem or controversy might be settled. 
<BR>


<P> <STRONG>MEDIATION HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL</STRONG> in settling cases 
because it permits an impartial, experienced mediator to discuss settlement 
possibilities privately with each party with the understanding that their 
positions will not be disclosed to the opposing party unless the opposing party 
agrees to the settlement of the dispute on the terms privately 
communicated to the mediator.  Since all parties are seriously negotiating 
the dispute, mediated settlements normall occur earlier than arbitration, 
saving everyone valuable time as well as money.
<BR>
<P><STRONG>EVEN IF </STRONG>mediation does not result in a voluntary 
settlement of the dispute, the mediation process is worthwhile because all 
participants have become more fully educated on the strengths and 
weaknesses of their cases, thereby providing the basis for a reasonable 
settlement in the future.
<BR>
<P><STRONG>PLEASE CONTACT</STRONG> Jaqueline Downs, our Executive Director 
at (800) 987-8406, if you are interested in mediating or obtaining more 
information on mediation.  She will be happy to assist you in utilizing 
the forums PACIFIC ADR SERVICES offers in this area.
<BR>
<P><STRONG>REMEMBER</STRONG>, should you voluntarily agree to mediate, 
doing so will not affect the processing of any claim you file in 
arbitration at PAS.  Your claim will continue to progress within the 
arbitration framework unless and until a settlement has been reached.

<CENTER><H1>Scientists and Engineers</H1></CENTER>
<BR>

<STRONG>VTI's Existing Technologists, Trusted.</STRONG>  VTI's network of trusted 
scientists and engineers (existing technologist) has taken 30 years to 
establish.  They are unique in their linguistic and technical diversity.  
VTIs network of scientists and engineers can converse in every major 
language.  Over the years, this network has found technologists in most of 
the technically endowed countries.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Can Find a Technologist With Skills In Any Field.</STRONG>  In the early years,
 the clients requested a listing of the sciences and technologies that VTI 
could provide.  VTI soon realized that its technologists could find out 
about any category that was presented to it.  In the last decade, the most 
efficient means to becoming familiar with a subject is through the uses of 
computer databases.  The VTI technologists are familiar with most computer 
searchable data bases and most of the conventional paper libraries in the 
world.  They are adept in soliciting librarians in finding obscure 
references that are not usually available to conventional searchers.  Many 
of the members of VTI's network maintain their own private libraries that 
have proven useful to VTI's searches in the past.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG><H3>Some Basics.</H3></STRONG> 
VTI technologists recognize that knowledge can be parsed 
into 2 cardinal classes, recorded and unrecorded.<BR>  
<BR>
<STRONG>Parsing of Recorded Knowledge.</STRONG>  Recorded knowledge can be subdivided into 
4 general types,  scientific (that which is discovered), engineering (that 
which can be used to build something), intellectual property (that which 
has property value) and commercial (that which can be bought today).  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>The Unique Value of Unrecorded Knowledge.</STRONG>  Unrecorded knowledge is usually 
more valuable, provided it is accessible. It is limited in its distribution 
and usually newly created.  Because it is in the mind of a technologist, it 
may be useful in solving problems that heretofore could not be solved.  If 
two technologists, one with a problem and one with new technology, get 
together, a new solution to the problem may emerge.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>You May Never Know, Ask.</STRONG> One of VTI's favorite insights is that, no 
matter how long the technologist has been a friend or an associate, his or 
her special knowledge about a subject must not be assumed.  Always ask a 
technologist what they know about a problem; they may surprise you.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>More Taxonomy.</STRONG>  An additional taxonomy of solutions to problems is the 
difference between evolutionary system engineering and revolutionary 
system engineering.  The Japanese perform the first, step-by-step 
engineering, better than any other class of engineers.  VTI technologists 
come from entities that, by their very nature, usually practice and are 
famous for practicing the revolutionary form.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>System Architecting.</STRONG> One of the unique skills that VTI technologists 
apply to the 5 classes of problems is this form of system architecting.  
The process by which VTI technologists can find the unrecorded knowledge 
in the mind of a technologist, and trade it for some knowledge or pay for 
it directly, is the key to VTI's success.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>End-to-End.</STRONG>  Solutions to the very difficult problems that face humans are 
almost always of this second kind.  Even the most mundane of the 5 classes 
of problems can benefit from the application of this end-to-end form of 
problem solution.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Morphological Analysis.</STRONG>  The greatest advocate of this form of problem 
solving was Professor Fritz Zwicky of Caltech, he called it Morphological 
Analysis.  His revelation can be summed-up by an excerpt of the abstract 
of his treatise  The Morphological Approach to Discovery, Invention, 
Research and Construction  May 1967.  To achieve technically and humanly 
satisfactory results three prerequisites must be fulfilled, namely first, 
<I>lack of bias</I>, that is absolute detachment from bias and prevaluations; second, 
<I>sufficient knowledge</I> about the true nature of the world; and third, <I>freedom 
of action</I>."  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>All?</STRONG>  A second quote is:  "The Morphological Approach to Discovery, 
Invention, Research and Construction has been conceived and developed for 
the purpose of dealing with <I>all</I> (this emphasis is Zwicky's) situations in 
life more reasonably and more effectively than hitherto.  This is achieved 
through the study of all relevant interrelations among objects, phenomena 
and concepts by means of methods which are based on the utmost detachment 
from prejudice and carefully refrain from all prevaluations.  Applications 
of the morphological methods of the total field coverage, of negation and 
construction, of the morphological box and others to technical problems in 
particular and to human problems in general are described."  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Three Requirements.</STRONG>  If VTI is unique, it is because VTI has applied these 
principles.  VTI strives for unbiased judgement, knowledge of the subject 
(including unrecorded knowledge), and freedom to act in the pursuit of the 
solution.  
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Permission To Moonlight.</STRONG>  Most of VTI's network of technologists are 
employed full time but have the privilege of performing consulting outside 
of their institutions.  VTI insists that each VTI consulting technologist 
will obtain permission to consult from his or her institution before VTI 
can offer his or her services to a client.  They are typically employed by 
universities and national laboratories.  A few are employed by enlightened 
corporate research laboratories that value such out-side-consulting 
because it improves the general knowledge base of their technologists.

<H2>The 5 classes of problems and how VTI solves them</H2>
</CENTER>

<BR><BR><BR>
<LI><STRONG>Solve Technical Problems.</STRONG>  VTI's network of scientists and engineers can 
solve problems that you may be having with your new or existing products 
or processes.  The solution may consist of theoretical, analytical, system 
design, detailed design, feasibility demonstration or prototype fabrication 
and testing.  Sometimes groups of technologist together can conceive of 
solutions to a problem that a lesser group could not.  Such a process is 
sometimes referred to as revolutionary-system-engineering.  Most companies 
are able to perform evolutionary-system-engineering, sometimes called 
"step-by-step development".  VTI can assist in solving specific problems 
that arise in disciplines that are not available to clients own 
technologists.  VTI technologists are skilled in capturing the 
intellectual property rights that may issue from such solutions.</LI>  
<BR><BR>
<LI><STRONG>Invent New Products or Processes.</STRONG>  In many instances 
VTI's technologists 
can invent new or improved products or processes that maintain a company's 
intellectual-property-monopoly position in the market. </LI> 
<BR><BR>
<LI><STRONG>Invent Around or Beyond Competitor's Patents.</STRONG> They can invent 
improvements based upon new technology not known at the time the previous 
patents were filed. </LI>  
<BR><BR>
<LI><STRONG>Find Patent Prior Art.</STRONG>  They can find prior art that can not be found by 
conventional searches and investigations by using technologists that find 
and consult with other technologists that may have special knowledge.  </LI>
<BR><BR>
<LI><STRONG>Evaluates Patents.</STRONG> They can provide independent technical evaluations of 
patents and/or suites of patents by technologists skilled in the art of 
the particular science or engineering discipline. </LI> 
</OL>

<BR><BR>

<CENTER><H2><STRONG>VTI's Unique Capabilities</STRONG></H2></CENTER>
<BR><BR>

<H2><STRONG>VTI's Technologists Do It Themselves.</STRONG></H2>
<P> VTI and its pool of independent 
consulting technologists (scientists and engineers) have developed a 
unique process to solving the five classes of problems listed above.  One 
or more of this unique network, of 85 technologists, may already be the 
best available technologist and may know how to solve the problem.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>VTI's Technologists Find Other More Skilled.</STRONG>  But usually, they locate
 a specific technologist by calling other technologists that they 
already know that may be sufficiently skilled in the discipline.  
Sometimes they search for specific authors of technical papers, articles 
or patents that they find in libraries and computer data bases.  The VTI 
scientist or engineer communicates with the specific technologist in his or 
her native language and in the language of the technology.  There is 
usually a trade of information between both technologists.  Such 
technologists are more willing to communicate under such circumstances.  If 
some work is involved, the new technologist is offered a fixed fee or an 
hourly rate with a not-to-exceed-limit.  Such rates and limits are 
pre-approved by the client.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Nondisclosure Agreement.</STRONG>  VTI's or the client's nondisclosure agreement 
should be used when business or technically sensitive information (the 
nature of the problem) is to be communicated between the parties.  
Business information should not be communicated without a good reason, and 
if communicated, it should be limited to the specific information on a 
need to know basis.  Technical information is almost always sensitive, and 
should be protected for two reasons.  Technical information can give 
competitors an advantage immediately.  Not identifying sensitive technical 
information that may lead to the development of intellectual property in 
the form of a patent may jeopardize the patent in the future.  One of the 
ways a patent can be challenged is by showing that the concept was made 
public before the patent was filed.  A nondisclosure agreement signed by 
the technologists that received the information that specifically 
identified the concept is the best protection.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Coordinators.</STRONG>  VTI's coordinator works with the client's coordinator, they 
handle the programmatic (non-technical) parts of the relationship; 
nondisclosure agreement, statement of work, and billing.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Statement of Work & PERT Charts.</STRONG>  The statement of work may be a simple 
description of the task, milestones, deliverables, cost and completion 
date.  The SoW may require a more complete definition of the task in the 
form of a set of PERT charts.  These standard task planning charts allow 
the scheduling and resources of a task to be dynamically integrated.  
Their best use is in updating the charts and using them to inform all 
parties as to the changes and consequences of the changes.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Task Manager & Monitor.</STRONG>  VTI's task manager works with the client's task 
monitor, they handle the technical parts of the relationship; statement of 
work, problem definition and solution design and reports.  Depending on 
which of the 5 classes of problems, the problem solution and reports are 
designed to fit.

<H1>Process Details and Caveats</H1>
</CENTER>

<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Conflicts of Interest.</STRONG>  VTI has cultivated consulting-technologists that 
are aware of the problems with working for more that one entity at a time 
without breaching confidential boundaries.  VTI is very sensitive to 
potential conflicts of interest.  In 30 year, VTI has avoided damaging a 
client's interests.  On a few occasions VTI has had to terminate a 
relationship because of a real or perceived conflict.  <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>1099.</STRONG>  VTI's pool of scientists and engineers are all 1099 independent 
consultants to VTI.  They have their own home office, computers, and other 
tools.   They pay their own out-of-pocket-expenses which may be reimburse 
by VTI.  Most of them have served VTI clients in the past.  Many of the 
newer members were recruited by the senior members.  Some have only 
consulted for VTI once, some have solved many problems over the years.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Reputations.</STRONG>  VTI's trusted technologists are almost all professional 
degreed scientists or engineers who are very protective of their 
reputations.  They are part of self-validating groups that will not 
sacrifice their professional reputations for short-term gain.  Their 
reputation is their most important asset.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>A Body-Contact Sport.</STRONG>  VTI has no agreement with any of the technologists, 
and they are free to consult or work for anyone they chose on their own, 
even VTI's clients.  VTI encourages one-on-one relationships with the 
client or the client's technologist.  Many have done just that.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Not A Job-Shop or Employment Agent.</STRONG>  VTI is not a job-shop contractor.  
The VTI technologists are valued for their knowledge and unique skills.  
VTI can help the client to locate and validate the appropriate 
technologists for a particular long term relationship.  But, VTI cannot 
efficiently compete with employment agencies.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Patent Attorneys & Reputations.</STRONG>  Most of the relationships that VTI has 
had with corporations has been through their patent attorney or patent 
firm.  Patent attorneys are usually aware of their clients technical and 
intellectual property needs.  The also can validate and guide the 
relationship between their client and technologists that they are 
acquainted with.  This relationship also extends to other patent law 
firms.  Technologists know that their reputations, good or bad, can travel 
throughout the intellectual property community to the benefit or the 
detriment of their valuable reputations.  This is the most important part 
of this extended network that will not work without mutual trust.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>
Best Efforts. </STRONG> VTI can only provide a best-efforts commitment to its 
clients.  The application of standard textbook solutions to a problem can 
usually be guaranteed, innovative solutions cannot.  If technologists 
skilled in the art could solve the problem by the application of 
previously know methodologies, then it is unlikely that the solution rises 
to the level of a patentable intellectual property.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>
Innovative Solutions.</STRONG>  Developing inventive solutions to problems implies 
that the solution to the problem is not amenable to conventional technical 
solutions.  VTI has always left the standard solutions to the many fine 
engineering firms in the country.  VTI can find and recommend such firms. 
VTI's motto is <BR>

<H1>Preferred Relationships with Clients</H1>
</CENTER>

<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Patent Law Firms Preferred.</STRONG>  VTI prefers to work for patent law firms that 
have clients that require solutions to one of the above problems.  Such a 
relationship is based upon mutual validated trust between the parties.  
See below for more details.
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Clients Recommended to VTI by Patent Law Firms.</STRONG>  VTI has provided 
technical consultants for the corporate patent counsel of several very 
large high tech companies, one for 10 years and another for 20 years.  It 
has consulted directly for the president and owner of companies.  It has 
provided all the technologists for several small companies for over ten 
years.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>LAIPLA Referrals.</STRONG>  Up until the last two years, VTI has not acquired any 
new clients that were not recommended to it by a present client.  As the 
result of an invited presentation given to the Los Angeles Intellectual 
Property Law Association in 1995, several new clients have requested VTI's 
services.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Prefers Established Clients.</STRONG>  VTI prefers to work for successful companies 
that have demonstrated skills in management, marketing, manufacturing and 
finance.

<H1>VTI Remuneration for Services </H1> 
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Fees for Services.</STRONG>  VTI bills the client for the total of hourly cost and 
out-of-pocket expenses of each independent technologists and for the 
hourly cost and out-of-pocket expenses of the owners of VTI.  These 
management and marketing costs are itemized in the same way the 
technologist's invoices are handled.  Technologists with advanced degrees 
command about $100 per hour.  Technicians, searchers, librarians and are 
paid less.  The basis for payment of hourly rates is 150% of burdened cost 
to his or her employer.  Weekends, evenings and leave time should be paid 
as if it is a form of overtime, and since the consultant is an 
independent 1099 self employed consultant that must maintain his or her 
tools and office, such rates are justified.  As such consulting work is 
discontinuous these cost are justified.  The client saves in the end 
because the client does not have to support such expensive technologists 
after the task is competed.   
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Itemized Billing and Reporting.</STRONG>  Each technologist must submit an itemized 
bill/invoice and a report that clearly describes the work that was 
performed for the client.  The date, location, tasks performed and time 
and expenses spent must be contemporaneously recorded.  An example is set 
forth below.  These invoices/reports may be sent to the client as reports 
only and at the end of the problem solving task they can be re submitted 
as part of a VTI Summary Invoice.  The client can have the reporting and 
billing in any way they choose.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>No Payment to VTI by Consultants.</STRONG>  The independent consulting 
technologists do not pay a percentage of their hourly costs to VTI.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Ringer Award.</STRONG>  If the technologists finds prior art that is used in a 
patent infringement settlement or judgement, the technologist must be paid 
$1000 in addition to his or her fees for the time expended.  Such awards 
motivate the searcher to examine each useful document completely.  
Searching literature and patents with understanding of the technology 
requires some real incentive over and above the hourly rate.  For most 
very intelligent technologists, searching through literature by hand or by 
aid of computers is tedious and requires this additional incentive.  
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Royalty for Inventors.</STRONG>  If the technologist invents a solution to the 
client's problem, the inventor must receive a reasonable royalty.  Without 
such an incentive the client may not obtain the best solution to his or 
her problem.  Like an orphaned baby, orphaned technology and especially 
intellectual property technology needs long term nurturing to obtain 
optimum long term value.  Such royalty maintains the interest of the 
technologist in obtaining and maintaining the monopoly rights in many 
ways.  Helping the patent attorney get the maximum intellectual property 
rights, creating additional suites of patents to block competitors from 
using alternative solutions and filing second and third generation patents 
using technology not yet discovered.

(some details have been changed to protect the identity of client companies)
<BR><BR><STRONG>Outsource technologists to solve problems</STRONG>  --  The production
 line of Company A ground to a halt when circuit boards began shorting.  Within two days
  the ACE expert had identified the problem as a conformal coating which had some 
  conducting properties.  A new coating was acquired, and a quality control program 
  initiated.  Problem solved, and future problems prevented.
<BR><BR><STRONG>Executive workshops on technology evaluations and planning</STRONG>  -- 
Executives at Company D recognized the need 
 to tap technology outside the corporation to improve its production line, but there 
 was no corporate experience in working with universities or government laboratories.  
 Workshops and strategic planning sessions assisted company to reorganize to use contract
  technologists to reduce manufacturing and quality control costs.
<BR><BR><STRONG>Technology alliance development</STRONG>   --  Company B sought expertise in cryptology to 
develop a new product. We arranged for the technology to be developed at a government 
laboratory.  Costs were much less than developing a new laboratory and hiring expertise.
<BR><BR><STRONG>Technology acquisitions</STRONG>  --  Company C sought a new product 
to strengthen its medical diagnostic product line.  The ACE consultant evaluated potential acquisitions without
 releasing the identity of the company or its corporate strategy.  Options were 
 developed, complementary product identified, and acquisition completed.<BR>
<BR><STRONG>Patent strategy</STRONG> --  Company F was being sued for patent infringement.  ACE 
 consultants identified prior art the patent of questions, thereby stopping the 
 infringement suit.

 <BR><BR>
<STRONG>Corporate communications systems</STRONG>  --  Executives at Company G desired briefing on improving 
internal communications, and marketing options available through an Internet website.  
Through a workshop, corporate information strategy was devised, and a home page for 
Prior art discovery  --  Company F was being sued for patent infringement.  ACE consultants identified prior art the patent of questions, thereby stopping the infringement suit.
marketing corporate products initiated.

<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Corporate alliances</STRONG>  --  Company H executives needed assistance in developing alliances 
for manufacturing and marketing throughout the Pacific Rim.  Strategies were considered, 
contacts were made anonymously, and options developed.  Assistance was provided to 
consummate the selected alliance.
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Critical path technologies</STRONG> --  Company J executives were concerned that 
they did not control all of the technologies required by their strategic plan 
for next generation products.  A workshop developed a list of critical path 
technologies.  Determinations were made on technologies to develop in-house, and 
those to develop through contract.  Assistance was provided to identify technology 
options, and to negotiate rights to outsourced technologies.<BR><BR>

LEARNING FROM VEGAS	SERMON BY REV. RICH LA SHURE
ROMANS 5.1-8	JUNE 23, 1996

	THE POSTMODERNIST ARCHITECT ROBERT VENTURI WROTE A BOOK ENTITLED 
LEARNING FROM LAS VEGAS. THE BOOK TOOK A TIMELY LOOK AT THE VARIOUS 
FORMS OF WEIRD, GLAMOROUS AND OUTRAGEOUS BUILDINGS IN THAT GLITTERING 
CITY OF THE NIGHT. VENTURI CONCLUDED THAT EVEN THOUGH LAS VEGAS 
ARCHITECTURE MAY SEEM TO BE GARISH, TASTELESS AND AS SHALLOW AS A 
TEASPOON, IT REPRESENTS WHAT AMERICANS REALLY LIKE, DEEP DOWN INSIDE.
	TWO WEEKS AGO I ASKED YOU TO CONSIDER DOING SOMETHING THAT I HAD 
NEVER BEFORE ASKED MEMBERS OF MY CONGREGATION TO DO: TO VIEW AN R-
RATED MOVIE TO PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR OUR MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON A 
SPECIFIC SUBJECT. PERSONALLY I SELDOM WATCH MOVIES THAT ARE RATED R, 
FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. THE OLDER I GET THE LESS INTERESTED I AM IN THE THINGS 
THAT TRIGGER THE R RATING. YET I FELT THAT IN THE CASE OF THE MOVIE LEAVING 
LAS VEGAS I NEEDED TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION. THIS WAS FOR TWO BASIC REASONS: 
FIRST, BECAUSE NICHOLAS CAGE WAS GIVEN THE ACADEMY AWARD FOR BEST 
PERFORMANCE BY AN ACTOR FOR HIS WORK IN LEAVING LAS VEGAS. WHAT THE 
ACADEMY CHOOSES AS ITS BEST IS USUALLY VIEWED BY A LARGE AUDIENCE OF 
PEOPLE. AND SECOND, BECAUSE THE ADVERTISING FOR THE MOVIE INCLUDED A KEY 
THEOLOGICAL TERM: UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE. 
	THE THEOLOGICAL WRITINGS OF UNION SEMINARY PROFESSOR PAUL TILLICH 
HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT TO ME SINCE MY OWN SEMINARY DAYS. IN SUCH 
COLLECTIONS OF SERMONS AS THE COURAGE TO BE, THE SHAKING OF THE 
FOUNDATIONS AND THE NEW BEING, AS WELL AS IN HIS 3-VOLUME SYSTEMATIC 
THEOLOGY, TILLICH OUTLINED THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST FOR A POST-RELIGIOUS 
AGE. WRITING FROM JUST AFTER WORLD WAR TWO THROUGH THE TUMULTUOUS 60S, 
TILLICH AIMED TO TRANSLATE BIBLICAL CONCEPTS INTO THE LANGUAGE OF A WORLD 
WHOSE FAITH IN GOD HAD BEEN SHAKEN TO ITS VERY FOUNDATIONS BY THE EVENTS 
OF THE HOLOCAUST. ANOTHER THEOLOGIAN BY THE NAME OF THOMAS J. J. ALTIZER 
LOOKED AT THE SAME EVENTS AND SOLEMNLY CONCLUDED THAT GOD WAS DEAD. OF 
THE TWO, TILLICH WAS MORE FAITHFUL. HE WAS WILLING TO ALLOW THAT 
SOMETHING OF GREAT SPIRITUAL IMPORTANCE HAD INDEED DIED ALONG WITH THE 6 
MILLION EUROPEAN JEWS AT THE HANDS OF THE NAZIS, BUT IT WASNT GOD. WHAT 
HAD DIED, PERHAPS, WAS HUMAN OBEDIENCE TO THE WILL OF THE GOD OF LOVE. 
AND IT IS UP TO CHRISTIANS IN EVERY AGE TO SEE IF TRUE OBEDIENCE TO GOD CAN 
BE RESURRECTED TO LIFE, AS JESUS WAS RESURRECTED.
	IN ONE OF HIS GREAT, RINGING PASSAGES, PAUL TILLICH PREACHED THE 
FOLLOWING: SOMETIMES A LIGHT BREAKS INTO OUR DARKNESS, AND IT IS AS 
THOUGH A VOICE WERE SAYING: YOU ARE ACCEPTED. YOU ARE ACCEPTED, BY THAT 
WHICH IS GREATER THAN YOURSELF AND THE NAME OF WHICH YOU DO NOT KNOW. 
DO NOT TRY TO DO ANYTHING NOW; PERHAPS LATER YOU WILL DO MUCH. DO NOT 
SEEK ANYTHING; DO NOT INTEND ANYTHING; DO NOT PERFORM ANYTHING. SIMPLY 
ACCEPT THE FACT THAT YOU ARE ACCEPTED.  IT SURPRISES ME THAT IN 1996, MORE 
THAN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AFTER I FIRST READ THOSE WORDS, THEY 
IMMEDIATELY COME TO MIND WITHOUT MY HAVING TO LOOK THEM UP. AND I DO NOT 
HAVE A PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY; ITS JUST THAT THE PASSAGE CONTAINS A WHOLE 
WORLD OF MEANING FOR ME.
	IN THE WRITINGS OF PAUL TILLICH, THE INTERCHANGEABLE TERMS 
ACCEPTANCE AND UNCONDITIONAL LOVE APPEAR OVER AND OVER AGAIN. HE 
SPECIFICALLY USED THE TERM UNCONDITIONAL LOVE AS A MODERN TRANSLATION, 
A NEW SYNONYM FOR THE BIBLICAL TERM GRACE. UNCONDITIONAL LOVE MEANS 
THE GRACE OF GOD. WE LOVE GRACE. WE LOVE TO THINK ABOUT GRACE. WE LOVE 
TO HEAR ABOUT GRACE. WE LOVE TO SING ABOUT GRACE. THE MOST FREQUENTLY-
REQUESTED HYMN IN THE UNITED METHODIST CHURCH IS AMAZING GRACE. 
	GRACE IS THE UNDESERVED, UNEARNED, UNMERITED LOVE THAT THE CHILDREN 
OF GOD RECEIVE FROM GOD. GRACE IS THE LOVE OF THE FATHER WHO KEEPS THE 
CANDLE FLAME OF HOPE BURNING FOR HIS WAYWARD, PRODIGAL SON WHO 
DEMANDED HIS INHERITANCE EARLY AND THEN SQUANDERED HIS INHERITANCE ON 
LOOSE LIVING, THE LOVE OF THE FATHER WHO RUNS OUT TO MEET HIS SON ON THE 
WAY HOME, THROWS HIS ARMS AROUND HIM, AND REJOICES: THIS IS MY BELOVED 
SON, WHO WAS LOST, AND NOW IS FOUND; WHO WAS DEAD, AND IS NOW ALIVE! 
GRACE IS THE CARE OF THE GOOD SHEPHERD WHO LEAVES THE 99 MEMBERS OF HIS 
FLOCK SAFE ON THE HILLSIDE PASTURE AND GOES OUT SEARCHING FOR THE ONE 
LOST SHEEP. GRACE IS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST NAILED TO A HEAVY, ROUGH CROSS 
OF WOOD, MANAGING TO SAY WITH VIRTUALLY HIS DYING BREATH, FATHER, FORGIVE 
THEM, FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO.  GOOD FRIENDS, CAN YOU SEE THAT 
YOU AND I DEPEND UPON THE GRACE OF GOD IN THE SAME WAY A SKYDIVER 
DEPENDS UPON HIS BACKUP PARACHUTE? AMEN?
	GRACE IS THE FORGIVENESS OF OUR SINS; GRACE IS THE ASSUMPTION OF OUR 
DEBTS; GRACE IS THE MENDING AND HEALING OF OUR BROKENNESS; GRACE IS THE 
AFFIRMATION OF OUR IDENTITIES; GRACE IS THE RESTORATION OF OUR 
RELATIONSHIPS. AND THE MODERN WAY OF SAYING GRACE IS UNCONDITIONAL 
LOVE. THAT HAS TOO MANY SYLLABLES TO BE EASILY SUNG IN A HYMN: AMAZING 
UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, HOW SWEET THE SOUND... SOMEDAY WHEN I AM INVITED TO 
SAY GRACE BEFORE A MEAL, IM GOING TO ASK EVERYONE TO BOW BEFORE I SAY 
UNCONDITIONAL LOVE. AMEN!
	WITH THIS AS MY BACKGROUND, I WAS NATURALLY INTRIGUED BY THE BLURB 
ON THE VIDEO BOX FOR THE MOVIE LEAVING LAS VEGAS. IT READS, FROM THE 
MOMENT BEN AND SERA (THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS) CONNECT, THEY FORM A 
UNIQUE BOND BASED ON UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE AND MUTUAL RESPECT THAT 
WILL CHANGE EACH OF THEM FOREVER. I HAD TO SEE AND LEARN WHAT OUR 
CULTURE MEANS BY UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE.
	LEAVING LAS VEGAS IS, QUITE SIMPLY, A PORTRAIT OF TWO INDIVIDUALS IN 
HELL. BEN IS A SUCCESSFUL SCRIPT EXECUTIVE FOR A HOLLYWOOD FILM COMPANY, 
AND HE HAS IT ALL--THE BMW, THE SPLIT-LEVEL POOL HOME IN ENCINO, THE 
GORGEOUS BLOND WIFE AND THE GREAT SON. OR AT LEAST HE HAD THESE 
BLESSINGS UNTIL HE DRANK THEM AWAY. WHEN WE FIRST MEET HIM BEN IS BEING 
FIRED FROM HIS JOB BECAUSE OF HIS ALCOHOLISM. HIS WIFE HAS ALREADY LEFT HIM 
AND HAS TAKEN THE KID WITH HER. WE DONT KNOW ANY OF BENS REASONS FOR 
WASTING HIS OPPORTUNITIES, AND WE ARE NOT LET IN ON THEM AS THE STORY 
UNFOLDS. THAT IS A GOOD THING, REALLY, FOR EVERY MAN WHO HAS EVER DRAINED 
AWAY HIS FUTURE AT THE BOTTOM OF A BOTTLE HAS DONE SO WITH ALL THE BEST 
REASONS AND THE MOST PLAUSIBLE EXCUSES IN THE WORLD. ALL WE KNOW ABOUT 
BEN  IS THAT HE HAS LOST HIS WILL TO LIVE, AND HE HAS MADE UP HIS MIND TO MOVE 
TO LAS VEGAS AND DRINK HIMSELF TO DEATH. THERE IN THE GLITTERING CITY OF THE 
NIGHT, HE MEETS SERA, A YOUNG PROSTITUTE WHO HAS SEEN IT ALL AT LEAST 
TWICE. HE HIRES HER--NOT TO HAVE SEX, BUT JUST TO TALK, AND THIS IS HOW THEIR 
RELATIONSHIP BEGINS.
	RIGHT HERE I HAVE TO STOP AND SAY THAT THIS MOVIE CONTAINS SOME OF 
THE FOULEST LANGUAGE I HAVE EVER HEARD IN A FILM, AND IT CONTAINS SCENES 
THAT BORDER ON VIOLENT PORNOGRAPHY. IT REALLY PULLS NO PUNCHES AND 
THROWS IN NO ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS. ITS VERY TOUGH TO WATCH ALL THE WAY 
THROUGH, AND IF YOU COULDNT MAKE IT, GOD BLESS YOU. IF YOU DID, GOD BLESS 
YOU, TOO. 
	BY AND BY, SERAS PIMP MEETS WITH A VIOLENT DEATH AND SO SHE BECOMES 
HER OWN BOSS. AT THE SAME TIME, HER AFFECTION FOR BEN GROWS TO THE POINT 
WHERE SHE INVITES HIM TO MOVE IN WITH HER. THEY ARE A VERY ODD COUPLE 
INDEED, WITH BEN DRINKING HIMSELF INTO TOTAL OBLIVION EVERY DAY AND SERA 
GOING OUT TO WALK THE STREETS EVERY NIGHT. HER CUSTOMERS RANGE FROM 
POLITE-SEEMING, WELL-DRESSED MEN TO VICIOUS CREEPS, AND SHE COMES OUT 
MUCH THE WORSE FOR WEAR.
	AT ONE POINT EARLY IN THEIR COHABITATION, BEN SPELLS OUT HIS CONDITION 
FOR STAYING WITH SERA: YOU MUST NEVER, NEVER ASK ME TO STOP DRINKING. IN 
HER TURN, SERA EXPECTS BEN NOT TO INTERFERE WITH HER PERFORMANCE OF HER 
CHOSEN CAREER. WHAT BINDS THEM TOGETHER IS THEIR SHARED, DESPERATE 
SENSE OF LONELINESS. IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT A PRIMARY MOTIVE OF ALCOHOLICS 
IS TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM OTHER PEOPLE. LIKEWISE, SELLING SEX IS A WAY 
TO DE-PERSONALIZE THIS MOST HOLY OF OUR PHYSICAL GIFTS FROM GOD. BOTH BEN 
AND SERA HAVE MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO CHECK OUT AS FAR AS THE REST OF THE 
HUMAN RACE IS CONCERNED.
	AS TOUGH AS IT IS TO WATCH, LEAVING LAS VEGAS STILL HAS A HEART. YOU 
CARE ABOUT THESE PEOPLE; YOU WANT THEM TO TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND; YOU 
REALLY BELIEVE THAT THEY LOVE EACH OTHER, AND SOME OF THEIR TENDER 
MOMENTS TOGETHER ARE ACHINGLY ROMANTIC. YET THE STORY IS TOO REALISTIC 
TO HAVE A SUGARY HAPPY ENDING PASTED ONTO IT. THE SAD TRUTH IS THAT MOST 
PEOPLE WHO SET OUT TO DESTROY THEMSELVES SUCCEED.
	WHAT HAPPENS? AFTER A MONTH OF STEADY BINGE DRINKING, BEN FINALLY 
DEFEATS HIS BODYS ABILITY TO ABSORB MASSIVE QUANTITIES OF ALCOHOL. BINGE 
DRINKERS USUALLY DIE EITHER FROM ACUTE LIVER FAILURE OR FROM ANEURYSMS 
OF THE ESOPHAGUS OR THE STOMACH, LITERALLY DROWNING IN THEIR OWN BLOOD. 
SERA IS THERE WHEN BEN DIES, AFTER HE MUTTERS SOMETHING ABOUT PUTTING US 
ASUNDER, A TRAGIC ECHO OF THE WORDS FROM MATTHEW 19.6 WHICH ARE ALSO 
FOUND IN THE CHURCHS MARRIAGE CEREMONY. WE HEAR SERAS PERSPECTIVE ON 
HER RELATIONSHIP WITH BEN THROUGH VIGNETTES OF HER SPEAKING TO A 
THERAPIST. THESE ARE HER LAST LINES: I THINK THE THING US--WE BOTH REALIZED 
THAT WE DIDNT HAVE THAT MUCH TIME--AND I ACCEPTED HIM FOR WHO HE WAS. AND 
I DIDNT EXPECT HIM TO CHANGE--AND I THINK HE FELT THAT FOR ME TOO. I LIKED HIS 
DRAMA. AND HE NEEDED ME. I LOVED HIM...
	AND THAT, GOOD FRIENDS, IS WHAT OUR CULTURE MEANS BY UNCONDITIONAL 
ACCEPTANCE. TO ACCEPT SOMEONE FOR WHO THEY ARE, AND NEVER EXPECT THEM 
TO CHANGE. I SAY UNTO YOU THAT THIS IS NOT--REPEAT, THIS IS NOT GRACE--THIS IS 
NOT THE LOVE GOD GIVES US AND IT IS NOT THE LOVE GOD CALLS US TO HAVE FOR 
ONE ANOTHER.
	THE UNTOLD STORY OF LEAVING LAS VEGAS IS ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE LIKE 
BEN AND SERA. HENRY DAVID THOREAU SAID THAT THE MASS OF MEN LEAD LIVES 
OF QUIET DESPERATION. NOW PRAISE GOD THAT MOST REAL LIVES ARE MORE 
DISCIPLINED THAN THE LIVES OF MOVIE CHARACTERS, YET WE WOULD BE SHOCKED 
TO LEARN HOW MANY REAL LIVES ARE CAREENING OUT OF THEIR ORBITS. IN LAS 
VEGAS, IN LOS ANGELES, AND EVEN HERE IN THE PLEASANT NEIGHBORHOODS OF 
PASADENA, ARCADIA AND SIERRA MADRE, PEOPLE ARE PERISHING FROM 
LONELINESS AND THE HOPELESSNESS OF THINKING THAT NO ONE REALLY KNOWS 
THEM, AND IF THEY DID KNOW THEM, THEY WOULDNT LIKE THEM. FEELING SO 
VULNERABLE, FEELING SO DESPERATE FOR COMPANIONSHIP, TOO MANY OF US 
EXPECT TOO LITTLE OF OTHERS JUST AS WE EXPECT TOO LITTLE OF OURSELVES. 
AND YES, GOD LOVES REAL PEOPLE WHO ARE SINKING BENEATH THE WAVES JUST 
LIKE BEN AND SERA.
	THE GRACE OF GOD, REVEALED DECISIVELY BY JESUS CRUCIFIED, IS A LOVE 
THAT ACCEPTS US AS WE ARE AND PROVIDES US WITH THE RESOURCES TO CHANGE, 
TO CHANGE FOR THE BETTER, SO THAT WE MAY EXPERIENCE THE VERY BEST THAT 
LIFE HAS TO OFFER. IT IS THE LOVE OF A PARENT WHO WANTS THE VERY BEST FOR 
HIS OR HER BELOVED CHILD. CAN A LOVING PARENT STAND BY DULLY WHILE HIS OR 
HER CHILD LETS THE PROMISE OF LIFE SLIP THROUGH THEIR FINGERS? NO WAY! AS IT 
SAYS IN FIRST CORINTHIANS 13, LOVE BEARS ALL THINGS, LOVE BELIEVES ALL 
THINGS, LOVE HOPES ALL THINGS, LOVE ENDURES ALL THINGS... SURE--BUT DOES 
THAT IMPLY THAT LOVE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT SUCH THINGS? IT DOES NOT. YOU 
BETTER BELIEVE THAT LOVE CARES WHAT HAPPENS!
	OUR CULTURE HAS A COMMON AND WONDERFUL EXPRESSION FOR THE 
COMMITMENT LEVEL OF MODERN RELATIONSHIPS: ILL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR YOU. 
THATS GREAT; THATS ABOUT FIDELITY AND CONSISTENCY AND CONSTANCY. BUT 
THERE IS MORE TO LOVE THAN SIMPLY BEING PRESENT IN THE ROOM WHEN A LOVED 
ONE MANAGES TO DESTROY THEMSELVES. LOVE ALSO MUST BE WILLING TO 
INTERVENE FOR THE SAKE OF THE BELOVED.
	HERE IS THE CRUX OF OUR SCRIPTURE FOR TODAY, SO IMPORTANT A PART OF 
THIS SCRIPTURAL TEACHING THAT PAUL REPEATS IT TWICE, WITH SLIGHT VARIATION. 
WHILE WE WERE STILL WEAK, AT THE RIGHT TIME CHRIST DIED FOR THE UNGODLY.  
(VERSE 6) GOD SHOWS HIS LOVE FOR US IN THAT WHILE WE WERE SINNERS, CHRIST 
DIED FOR US. (VERSE 8) THIS IS LOVES INTERVENTION INTO THE DESTRUCTIVE 
PATTERN OF SIN. THROUGH JESUS CHRIST WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN EMERGENCY 
ACCESS TO THE GRACE OF GOD. SIMPLY BEING THERE FOR HIS CHILDREN WAS NOT 
ENOUGH FOR THE GOD OF INFINITE LOVE. GOD HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND ALWAYS WILL 
BE THERE FOR US. GOD LOVES US AS WE ARE. THATS A GIVEN. BUT IN HIS INFINITE 
COMPASSION GOD SAW THAT OUR PERSISTENCE IN SINNING REQUIRED A MORE 
DRAMATIC, MORE EFFECTIVE ACTION ON HIS PART. AND SO GOD INTERVENED.
	TWO WEEKS AGO, AS YOU MAY RECALL, WE LOOKED AT THE BRIDGE OF 
SALVATION THROUGH OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST. ITS PRINTED AGAIN IN YOUR 
SCRIPTURE NOTES FOR TODAY. THE FIRST KEY STEP IN CROSSING THAT BRIDGE 
FROM OUR SIDE TO GODS SIDE IS ACCEPTING JESUS AS OUR LORD AND SAVIOR, AS 
HE HAS ACCEPTED US. UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE IS NOT THE SAME THING AS 
RESIGNATION. THIS IS THE MESSAGE THAT WE HAVE GOT TO GET THROUGH TO 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CONDITIONED BY CULTURE TO SETTLE FOR WAY TOO 
LITTLE, WAY TOO LATE. ONLY WHEN WE REALIZE HOW MUCH GOD DESIRES FOR OUR 
LIVES WILL BE BEGIN TO DESIRE MORE FOR OUR LIVES. AND HOW MUCH DOES GOD 
DESIRE FOR OUR LIVES? NOTHING LESS THAN ABUNDANT JOY, FULFILLING 
RELATIONSHIPS, PHYSICAL WHOLENESS, ETERNAL PEACE AND HEAVENLY REWARD. 	
	CAN WE LEARN SOMETHING FROM MOVIES LIKE LEAVING LAS VEGAS? YOU BET 
WE CAN, IF WE READ BETWEEN THE LINES. AND THE NUMBER ONE LESSON WE CAN 
LEARN IS HOW LOST WE ARE WITHOUT JESUS CHRIST. THIS I PROMISE YOU: THE SON 
OF GOD IS CAPABLE OF ENTERING ANY HUMAN RELATIONSHIP, NO MATTER HOW 
MESSED UP IT IS; HE IS CAPABLE OF ENTERING ANY HUMAN LIFE; HE IS CAPABLE OF 
ENTERING YOUR LIFE, AND TURNING IT AROUND WITH THE TRANSFORMING POWER OF 
UNCONDITIONAL LOVE. AMEN.

FAITH FLUCTUATES	SERMON BY REV. RICH LA SHURE
ROMANS 7.15-25	JULY 14, 1996

	ONE OF THE GREATEST CHALLENGES FACING THE CHURCHES TODAY IS THE 
CHALLENGE OF DISUNITY. AT LAST COUNT THERE WERE OVER 150 SEPARATE, 
DISTINCT DIVISIONS OR DENOMINATIONS WITHIN THE OVERALL WORLD-WIDE 
CHRISTIAN MOVEMENT, TO SAY NOTHING OF THE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF 
INDEPENDENT FELLOWSHIPS WHICH HAVE NO DENOMINATIONAL TIE WHATSOEVER. 
WHAT IS A DENOMINATION? A DENOMINATION IS A CORPORATE ENTITY POSSESSING 
ITS OWN UNIQUE RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR THE QUALIFICATION AND ORDINATION 
OF PASTORS, THE MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES AND THE CARE OF 
CONGREGATIONS. THEOLOGICALLY EACH DIFFERENT DENOMINATION LOOKS AT 
SACRAMENTS DIFFERENTLY; FOR EXAMPLE, THE ROMAN CATHOLIC DENOMINATION 
TEACHES THAT THERE ARE 7 SACRAMENTS WHILE THE UNITED METHODIST 
DENOMINATION TEACHES THAT THERE ARE ONLY 2 SACRAMENTS--BAPTISM AND HOLY 
COMMUNION.
	NOW WHILE THEY ARE SURELY AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE DAY-TO-DAY 
MINISTRIES OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST TODAY, DENOMINATIONS ARE NOT 
PART OF THE BIBLICAL PLAN OF GOD FOR THE HUMAN RACE. NO DENOMINATION IS 
EVER MENTIONED ANYWHERE IN THE BIBLE. DENOMINATIONS ARISE OUT OF THE 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PEOPLE, USUALLY INVOLVING DISPUTES OVER ONE OF THE 
THREE TS: THEOLOGY, TERRITORY, OR TARGET AUDIENCE.  WHILE UNTOLD MILLIONS 
OF PERSON-HOURS AND PERSON-DOLLARS ARE EXPENDED ANNUALLY TO MAINTAIN 
DENOMINATIONAL STRUCTURES, THESE STRUCTURES ARE OF MEN, NOT OF GOD. 
AMEN?  WHEN WE GET TO HEAVEN, THERE WILL BE NO MORE USE FOR THEM. AMEN? 
	NOW LETS TRY OUT A LITTLE LOGIC HERE, IN THE FORM OF THREE CONNECTED 
PROPOSITIONS:
	PROP. A. JUST TO REPEAT, THERE WONT BE ANY DENOMINATIONS IN HEAVEN. 
HEAVEN WONT RESPECT METHODISTS OVER BAPTISTS OR DISCIPLES OVER 
EVANGELICALS OR PENTECOSTALS OVER CHARISMATICS OR PRE-TRIBULATIONISTS 
OVER PLURALISTS OR CATHOLICS OVER JEHOVAHS WITNESSES.
	PROP. B. A KEY BELIEF AMONG CHRISTIANS IS THAT THE KINGDOMS OF THIS 
WORLD NEED TO BE TRANSFORMED IN THE LIKENESS OF THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. 
THAT IS WHY WHEN WE SAY THE LORDS PRAYER WE PRAY, THY KINGDOM COME, THY 
WILL BE DONE ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN.
	C.  NOW IF PROPOSITION A AND PROPOSITION B ARE TRUE, THEN IT FOLLOWS 
THAT TO THE DEGREE THAT THEY ARE TRUE FOR US, CHRISTIANS OUGHT TO BE 
WORKING TO OVERCOME THEIR DENOMINATIONAL DIFFERENCES NOW AND NOT 
WAITING FOR GOD TO DO IT IN HEAVEN LATER.    
	OVER MY QUARTER-CENTURY AS A PREACHER, I HAVE HAD SEVERAL 
EXPERIENCES OF UNITY AMONG THE VARIOUS DENOMINATIONS OF THE CHURCH. 
BACK WHEN I WAS A SEMINARY STUDENT, THE RIVERSIDE PRESBYTERY OF THE 
UNITED PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH GRACIOUSLY ALLOWED ME, A UNITED METHODIST, 
TO BE THE PASTOR OF ONE OF ITS SMALLER OUTPOSTS: THE CHARMING SPIRED 
WHITEWASHED WOODEN CHURCH NEAR THE SHORE OF LAKE ELSINORE. THAT WAS A 
WONDERFUL MINISTRY; FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS WE SHARED THE LOVE OF GOD 
TOGETHER ACROSS DENOMINATIONAL LINES.
	THE UNITED METHODIST CHURCH, ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER MAINLINE 
DENOMINATIONS INCLUDING THE PRESBYTERIANS AND THE DISCIPLES OF CHRIST, IS 
PART OF COCU, AN ACRONYM WHICH STANDS FOR THE CHURCH OF CHRIST UNITING. 
COCU IS A PRODUCT OF THE LATE 1960S, AND IT HAS ENDURED AS A MOVEMENT 
WITHIN THE MORE LIBERAL WINGS OF THE CHURCH. FROM TIME TO TIME COCU 
DENOMINATIONS DO THINGS TOGETHER TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR UNITY, SUCH AS 
HOLDING JOINT COMMUNION SERVICES OR ORDINATION CEREMONIES. BUT COCU HAS 
NOT ATTRACTED THE INTEREST OF THE MORE CONSERVATIVE DENOMINATIONS LIKE 
THE BAPTISTS. IN FACT, IF YOU MERGED ALL OF THE COCU DENOMINATIONS 
TOGETHER, YOU WOULD GET A DENOMINATION THAT WOULD STILL PLAY SECOND 
FIDDLE TO THE BAPTISTS.
	ANOTHER WAY IN WHICH I HAVE EXPERIENCED UNITY WITHIN THE BODY OF 
CHRIST HAS BEEN THROUGH MINISTERIAL FELLOWSHIPS. THE PROBLEM WITH MANY 
MINISTERIAL FELLOWSHIPS IS THE TENDENCY OF PASTORS TO SPILL THEIR GRIPES 
ABOUT THEIR JOBS, AND THAT DOES NOT TEND TO BE A VERY SPIRITUAL PROCESS. 
HERE IN SIERRA MADRE PASTOR DICK ANDERSON OF THE BIG CONGREGATIONAL 
CHURCH HAS MINISTERED AS A PASTOR TO THE REST OF THE PASTORS, AND HE HAS 
TRULY BLESSED ME IN MY MINISTRY. I ALSO THINK THE WORLD OF PASTOR BARNEY 
HAMADY OF BETHANY CHURCH AND FATHER MICHAEL BAMBERGER OF THE 
EPISCOPAL CHURCH. 
	I AM THINKING BACK TO ONE PARTICULAR TUESDAY AFTERNOON WHEN A 
NUMBER OF US SIERRA MADRE PASTORS MET UP AT THE PASSIONIST FATHERS 
RETREAT CENTER AT THE END OF SUNNYSIDE. WE SAT OUT ON THE VERANDA OF THE 
BUILDING AND GAZED OUT OVER ALL THAT GOD HAS MADE HERE--THE MOUNTAINS, 
THE VALLEY, THE BLUE SKY, TRULY THE GLORY OF CREATION. WE SHARED OUR 
SENSE OF BLESSING AT BEING CALLED TO WORK FOR GOD HERE IN THIS BEAUTIFUL 
PLACE. THAT DAY WE GOT TO MEET SISTER JUDY, WHO CONDUCTS RECOVERY 
RETREATS, DOES GROUP COUNSELING IN OTHER FORMS, AND ORGANIZED THE TAIZE 
SERVICE THAT WAS CONDUCTED DURING ADVENT LAST YEAR. THAT DAY SISTER JUDY 
USED AN EXPRESSION THAT I HAD NEVER HEARD BEFORE: DRY DRUNK.
	AT FIRST, I THOUGHT I HAD LEARNED ANOTHER NEW OXYMORON, LIKE 
NUCLEAR SAFETY, JUMBO SHRIMP, PRETTY UGLY OR VIRTUAL REALITY. AN 
OXYMORON IS A COMPACT CONTRADICTION IN TERMS, A COLLISION BETWEEN 
WORDS, THAT CAN EITHER BE AMUSING OR SERIOUS. NOW MARIE KIDD SAYS THAT AN 
OXYMORON IS SOMEONE WHO GRADUATES FROM OCCIDENTAL COLLEGE, BUT SHE 
CAN SAY THAT BECAUSE THATS HER ALMA MATER. HOW MANY OTHER OCCY-AH-
PEOPLE DO WE HAVE HERE TODAY? DRY DRUNK SOUNDS LIKE THAT, A STRAIGHT 
CONTRADICTION IN TERMS. FOR HOW CAN SOMEONE BE BOTH DRUNK AND DRY, 
WHICH MEANS SOBER, AT THE SAME TIME?
	WHEN I ASKED HER WHAT SHE MEANT BY THE TERM DRY DRUNK, SISTER JUDY 
REPLIED THAT SOMEONE CAN BE IN RECOVERY AND STILL SUFFER FROM THE SAME 
COMPULSIVE, SELF-DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR PATTERNS THAT THEY HAD WHEN THEY 
WERE DRINKING, ONLY WITHOUT THE BOOZE. ITS MORE THAN JUST FEELING THE 
CONSTANT CRAVING FOR A DRINK. A DRY DRUNK MAY HAVE FOUND SOME OTHER 
THING TO DO JUST AS COMPULSIVELY AS THEY USED TO PRACTICE DRINKING, SUCH 
AS GAMBLING, SMOKING, SHOPPING HAVING SEX OR BEING ANGRY. SOME ALCOHOLIC 
PEOPLE EVEN FOOL THEMSELVES INTO THINKING THAT THEY NEED OTHER DRUGS 
SUCH AS MARIJUANA TO HELP THEM KICK THE BOTTLE. 
	ONE OF THE TRUE COLLATERAL EFFECTS OF A HARD-DRINKING LIFESTYLE IS 
THE SHEER AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO STAY LOADED AND GET OVER HANGOVERS. 
ABSORBING ALCOHOL CAN BE VERY ABSORBING. WHEN A PERSON GETS SOBER, 
THERE IS SUDDENLY THIS BIG EXPANSE OF TIME STRETCHING BEFORE THEM, TIME 
THAT THEY USED TO SPEND CELEBRATING. AND A RECOVERING ALCOHOLIC WITH 
TIME ON HIS OR HER HANDS IS ALREADY IN BIG TROUBLE; THAT IS WHY THE WEEKLY 
COMMITMENT OF ATTENDING A 12-STEP GROUP IS SO IMPORTANT.
	NOW IVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE HARVEST CRUSADE MINISTRY QUITE A BIT 
IN THE LAST MONTH OR SO, BUT LET ME JUST SAY ONE MORE THING ABOUT IT: THERE 
WAS TRUE CHRISTIAN UNITY IN THAT MINISTRY, MORE STRONGLY SO THAN I HAVE 
EVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE. THE CRUSADES ARE NOT ABOUT BUILDING UP GREG 
LAURIES CHURCH OR ANY OTHER SINGLE CONGREGATION; THEY ARE ABOUT 
BUILDING UP THE BODY OF CHRIST. THEY ARE ABOUT HELPING GOD MAKE 
CHRISTIANS. THAT MESSAGE IS BOTH ON THE LINES AND BETWEEN THE LINES IN 
EVERYTHING THAT IS DONE DURING THE CRUSADES. MY BELIEF IS THAT EVERY 
DENOMINATION AND EVERY LOCAL CONGREGATION WOULD BE ABLE TO DO A BETTER 
JOB OF EVANGELISM IF IT DEMONSTRATED THE INTEGRITY THAT IS EVIDENT TROUGH 
THE HARVEST CRUSADE MINISTRY. I THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF 
HEARING ABOUT ALL OF THE STUFF THAT WE USUALLY HEAR ABOUT FROM BIG 
DENOMINATIONS OR MEGA-MINISTRIES, STUFF LIKE DISPUTES OVER SOCIAL ISSUES, 
MONEY PROBLEMS OR LIFESTYLE SCANDALS AMONG PASTORS. HERE, THERE AND 
EVERYWHERE, PEOPLE ARE SEARCHING FOR THE GENUINE ARTICLE, THE REAL THING, 
CHRISTIANITY WITH INTEGRITY.
	LAST TUESDAY I WAS BLESSED BY GETTING A MESSAGE ON MY BEEPER. YOU 
MAY NOT LIKE PAGERS; YOU MAY NOT EVEN LIKE PHONE ANSWERING MACHINES, BUT 
OF YOU ARE AGAINST THESE THINGS, PLEASE GET OVER IT! NOW I HAVE TO SAY 
RIGHT AWAY THAT DRIVERS FIDDLING AROUND WITH THEIR CELL PHONES WHILE 
THEYRE SUPPOSED TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO THE ROAD REALLY BUG MY GUTS. 
SO I GUESS THAT WE ALL HAVE OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. 
	ANYWAY, I GOT TWO PAGES BACK TO BACK FROM THE SAME GLENDALE 
DIALING PREFIX. THERE WAS NO ANSWER AT THE FIRST NUMBER, BUT THE SECOND 
NUMBER WAS BUSY AND SO I DECIDED TO TRY AGAIN LATER. ON THE THIRD TRY I GOT 
A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD ATTENDED THE HARVEST CRUSADE, ONE OF THE PEOPLE 
WHO HAD COME FORWARD AT THE TIME OF THE INVITATION. WE HAD SENT HIM A 
FOLLOW-UP LETTER WHICH INCLUDED MY PAGER NUMBER, AND HE HAD TRIED IT SO 
THAT HE COULD ASK ME A QUESTION: WHAT DID I THINK OF 12-STEP GROUPS? I SAID 
THAT I THOUGHT THEY WERE A VERY EFFECTIVE FORM OF MINISTRY, AND WE HAD 
SEVERAL OF THEM MEETING AT OUR CHURCH EVERY WEEK. HE SAID THAT HEARING 
ME SAY THAT WAS A RELIEF TO HIM, FOR HE HAD BEEN IN RECOVERY FOR 6 YEARS 
AND CONSIDERED THE 12-STEP PROGRAM TO REALLY BE HIS CHURCH. BUT THEN, 
AFTER 6 YEARS OF SOBRIETY, HE HAD BEGUN TO HEAR THE CALL OF CHRIST IN HIS 
LIFE. PRAISE GOD! 	
	AND SO HE WENT TO THE HARVEST CRUSADE AND CAME FORWARD AT THE TIME 
OF THE INVITATION. DOWN THERE ON THAT BASEBALL FIELD, WITH OVER 4,000 
OTHERS WHO WILLINGLY ANSWERED THE INVITATION TO ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST, HE 
HAD GOTTEN A CRITICAL TURNOFF. A NOVICE CHRISTIAN COUNSELOR HAD TOLD HIM 
THAT HE DIDNT NEED THE 12-STEP PROGRAM; THAT HE ONLY NEEDED ONE STEP, AND 
THAT STEP IS JESUS CHRIST. I TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD BEEN GIVEN THE WRONG 
ADVICE. 12-STEP GROUPS AFFIRM GOD, THEY JUST LEAVE THE DEFINITION OF GOD A 
LITTLE VAGUE, AND ITS PERFECTLY ALRIGHT WITH GOD IF YOU PUT HIS NAME OR THE 
NAME OF JESUS CHRIST INTO THE 12-STEP FORMULA.
	NOT PLEASE UNDERSTAND--IM NOT SAYING THAT ANY AND ALL ANSWERS TO 
THE HUMAN SEARCH FOR GOD ARE EQUALLY VALID. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND 
ANYONE TO STAY IN A CULT ONE MINUTE LONGER THAN THEY HAVE STAYED 
ALREADY. HOW TO YOU TELL IF IT IS A CULT? ITS VERY SIMPLE: CULTS IDOLIZE MEN; 
CHURCHES WORSHIP GOD. BUT EVEN A CULT OR A NEW AGE INTEREST GROUP CAN 
BE A STEPPING STONE ON THE WAY TO CHRISTIAN DISCIPLESHIP. WEVE GOT TO BE 
VERY CAREFUL IN WHAT WE CONDEMN, LEST WE UNCERCUT THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE 
BLOOD OF CHRIST. HOW DID JESUS PUT IT? DO NOT JUDGE ONE ANOTHER, SO THAT 
YOU YOURSELVES WILL NOT BE JUDGED. A SURVEY OF PEOPLE WHO JOINED NEW 
AGE MOVEMENTS REVEALED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY, OVER 75% OF THEM, WERE 
REACTING AGAINST A NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE THEY HAD HAD IN A CHRISTIAN 
CHURCH, AN EXPERIENCE OF BEING JUDGED BY PEOPLE NO HOLIER THAN THEY 
WERE, BUT WHO THOUGHT THEMSELVES HOLY.
	IN OUR SCRIPTURE FOR THIS MORNING, PAUL COMES AS CLEAN AS ANY 
CHRISTIAN CAN COME CLEAN. HE ADMITS TO EXPERIENCING THE FLUCTUATIONS OF 
FAITH. WHEN WE BECOME CHRISTIANS, WHEN WE ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST INTO OUR 
LIFE, WHAT HAPPENS IS USUALLY DRAMATIC AT FIRST, AND LESS DRAMATIC LATER 
ON. THE INITIAL EUPHORIA OF ACCEPTANCE WEARS OFF, AND THE HARD WORK OF 
GROWING IN CHRIST SETS IN. THE OLD-TIMERS USED TO SAY THAT WHEN SOMEONE 
RECEIVES JESUS AS LORD FOR THE FIRST TIME, SATAN SENSES THAT HES LOSING 
THEM AND GOES TO WORK ON THEM HARDER THAN EVER BEFORE. IN OTHER WORDS, 
BEING A CHRISTIAN DOES NOT TAKE AWAY TEMPTATION, ALTHOUGH WE WISH IT 
WOULD TAKE TEMPTATION AWAY. AMEN? FAITH FLUCTUATES; OUR TEMPERS WAX 
AND WANE; OUR SENSE OF BLESSEDNESS RISES AND FALLS. GOOD FRIENDS, THATS 
NORMAL; DONT WORRY ABOUT IT; DONT TRY TO OVERCOME IT; LET IT BE!
	ITS NOT GOING TOO FAR TO SAY THAT PAULS STRUGGLE AS DESCRIBED ON 
THE 7TH CHAPTER OF ROMANS IS THE CLASSIC STRUGGLE OF A PERSON IN 
RECOVERY. THEY CAN WILL WHAT IS RIGHT, BUT DO NOT FEEL ABLE TO DO IT. THEY 
MANAGE TO ACHIEVE EVIL RATHER THAN ACHIEVING GOOD. TRYING TO DO THE GOOD, 
THEY FIND IT TO BE A LAW THAT EVIL LIES CLOSE AT HAND. THEY FEEL ENSLAVED, 
BOUND WITHIN THEIR OWN BODIES BY A SENSE OF CRAVING, WHETHER IT IS A 
CRAVING FOR A DRINK OR A CRAVING FOR SOMETHING ELSE, EVEN THE CRAVING FOR 
A SPIRITUAL HIGH. THEY LITERALLY FEEL THAT THEIR INNER LIVES ARE A BATTLE 
ZONE, A ZONE OF WAR BETWEEN MIND AND BODY. DOES THIS RING ANY BELLS? IS 
ANYBODY GETTING THIS?
	I AM HERE TO TELL YOU THAT JESUS UNDERSTANDS THIS KIND OF INNER 
STRUGGLE. EVEN THE SON OF GOD WAS TORN BY THE AWESOME REQUIREMENTS OF 
HIS OWN MINISTRY AND AT THE VERY LAST, HE FELT FORSAKEN BY GOD. IF THE SON 
OF GOD HAD HIS LOW TIMES, THEN YOU OUGHT TO BE AT PEACE WITH HAVING YOUR 
OWN LOW TIMES AS WELL. YET AS SURELY AS IT IS DARKEST JUST BEFORE THE 
DAWN, SO GOD WILL SEND A PENETRATING RAY OF HOPE INTO THE DENSE GLOOM OF 
YOUR OWN SOUL-SEARCHING SELF-DOUBT. FOR WHEN WE SEARCH OURSELVES 
THOROUGHLY, THERE IS ONLY ONE CONCLUSION WE CAN REACH: WE DO NOT 
POSSESS THE RESOURCES TO SAVE OURSELVES. ONLY GOD CAN SAVE US! ONLY GOD 
CAN PROVIDE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEFEAT AND VICTORY, BETWEEN BLESSING 
AND CURSE, BETWEEN ETERNAL DEATH AND EVERLASTING LIFE. ONLY GOD CAN HELP 
US MAINTAIN OUR FORWARD MOMENTUM AS WE CROSS THE BRIDGE OF SALVATION 
THROUGH JESUS CHRIST. AND I DECLARE UNTO YOU THAT THIS MUCH HELP IS 
ENOUGH. AMEN.

A SPIRITUAL MINDSET	SERMON BY REV. RICH LA SHURE
ROMANS 8.1-11	JULY 21, 1996

	I REALLY SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT COMING. THERE HAD TO BE A COLLISION OF 
SOME SORT BETWEEN US, SOONER OR LATER. WERE JUST SO DIFFERENT. I DID NOT 
SAY THAT I AM BETTER THAN HIM; ALL I SAID WAS THAT WE ARE DIFFERENT. 
	LAST MONDAY AFTERNOON WHEN WE PULLED IN AT OUR SMALL VACATION 
GETAWAY, A DOUBLEWIDE MANUFACTURED HOME IN THE DESERT SCRUB OF THE 
OWENS VALLEY, WE NOTICED THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG. 
	WHEN WE WERE THERE LATE LAST SPRING, MY WIFE AND I SPENT A SOLID 
WEEK DIGGING, PLANTING AND SETTING UP DRIP IRRIGATION FOR AROUND 100 
DESERT NATIVE FLOWERS, SHRUBS AND SMALL TREES. KATHY HAS STUDIED THE 
FLORA OF THE CALIFORNIA DESERT, IS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANT 
SOCIETY, AND SHE HAS DONE A WONDERFUL JOB OF DESIGNING OUR LANDSCAPE 
PLAN UP THERE. EVERY PLANT, FROM THE TALLEST COTTONWOOD TREE TO THE 
SMALLEST PENSTEMON, IS THERE FOR A REASON. SOMEDAY OUR TWO INCENSE 
CEDAR TREES WILL BE MIGHTY LIKE THE ONES IN THE HIGHLAND FORESTS OF THE 
SIERRA NEVADAS. THERE IS AN UPPER MOJAVE DESERT GARDEN, A RIVERINE 
GARDEN AND A PINYON-JUNIPER WOODLAND GARDEN. BY AND LARGE, EVERYTHING 
IS DOING FINE, EXCEPT FOR A FEW DOGWOOD CUTTINGS THAT DIDNT SURVIVE THE 
UNSEASONABLY HOT DAYS OF JUNE.
	BUT SOME TIME DURING THE LAST MONTH WE GOT VANDALIZED. SOMEONE HAD 
COME ALONG AND JERKED ABOUT TEN OF THE BUSHES IN OUR PINYON-JUNIPER ZONE 
OUT OF THE GROUND, LEAVING THE ROOT BALLS TO DESICCATE AND DIE IN THE 
DESERT SUN. ALL IN ALL, THE DAMAGE WAS WORTH ABOUT $100 PLUS LABOR. RIGHT 
AWAY I THOUGHT OF KARYO, AN 8-YEAR-OLD BOY WHOSE FAMILY LIVES THREE 
DOORS TO THE NORTH OF US. KARYO AND HIS FRIENDS LIKE TO RIDE BMX BIKES AND 
ESPECIALLY JUMP THEM OVER SMALL OBSTACLES. HE HAD COMMENCED USING THE 
FRONT STRIP OF OUR LOT FOR HIS BIKE JUMP ZONE, IN THE AREA WHICH IS 
TECHNICALLY A COUNTY EASEMENT. HIS BIKE JUMPING HAD THRASHED ONE OF THE 
LARGE RABBITBRUSH BUSHES WHICH WERE PART OF NATURES ORIGINAL 
LANDSCAPING. LAST TIME I HAD ASKED KARYO AND HIS FRIEND NOT TO RIDE THEIR 
BIKES THROUGH THE BUSHES, TRYING TO REASON WITH THEM AND NOT WANTING TO 
TAKE THE MATTER TO A HIGHER AUTHORITY.
	SO WHEN I SAW THE DEAD PLANTS THAT WE HAD CARINGLY PLANTED ALONG 
WITH THREE MORE RABBITBRUSH BUSHES LOOKING THE WORSE FOR WEAR, I 
WALKED OVER TO KARYOS HOUSE TO SPEAK WITH HIS MOTHER. I WAS NOT 
ACCUSATORY, JUST WANTING TO KNOW IF HE HAD SEEN ANYONE TEARING UP OUR 
YARD. HE SAID NO, BUT HIS MOM SENSED SOMETHING AND TOLD HIM THAT SHE 
WOULD ASK HER HUSBAND TO COME OVER AND SPEAK WITH ME ABOUT IT LATER.
	THAT WAS ALL FINE, BUT LATER ON, AS PRESIDENT HARRY TRUMAN MIGHT 
HAVE SAID, THE FERTILIZER HIT THE VENTILATOR. RIGHT HERE I NEED TO REMIND YOU 
ABOUT JOE, OUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR FROM HELL. THE NAME HAS BEEN CHANGED 
TO PROTECT THE GUILTY. FROM DAY ONE JOE HAS BEEN A MILD BUT PERSISTENT 
PAIN IN THE KEISTER TO US. HE IS CLEARLY ADDICTED TO ALCOHOL AND NICOTINE 
DUE TO HIS CONTINUAL OUTDOOR INGESTING OF THESE SUBSTANCES IN VARIOUS 
FORMS RANGING FROM TALL COCKTAILS TO BEERS TO HANDROLLED CIGARETTES TO 
SNUFF. HE IS ALSO A COLLECTOR OF OLD VEHICLES AND LEAVES SEVERAL OF THEM 
SCATTERED ABOUT HIS PROPERTY AT ALL TIMES LIKE LOOSE POCKET CHANGE. SOME 
OF THEM RUN AND SOME DONT. HIS FLEET INCLUDES THREE--NO, MAKE THAT FOUR 
PICKUP TRUCKS, A PASSENGER SEDAN, A SMALL SPORTSCAR, A SPEEDBOAT, A 
TRAVEL TRAILER, TWO MOTORCYCLES AND A THREE-WHEELER WITH A VW ENGINE, 
PLUS SEVERAL CAMPER SHELLS AND ONE HUMONGOUS CABOVER CAMPER WHICH HE 
LEAVES ON THE GROUND. LAST YEAR WE REJOICED TO LEARN THAT HE WAS 
PLANNING TO BUILD A GARAGE TO HOUSE ALL OF HIS TOYS. THEN A MONSTER 
STRUCTURE MEASURING 15 FEET HIGH BY 1,000 SQUARE FEET FLOOR SPACE WAS 
ERECTED, MORE LIKE A CALTRANS EQUIPMENT SHED THAN A GARAGE, BLOTTING OUT 
A GOOD THIRD OF OUR VIEW OF THE SIERRAS TO THE WEST. WE REMINDED 
OURSELVES THAT THIS WASNT PASADENA, AND WE HAD NO SAY ABOUT WHAT A 
NEIGHBOR CAN BUILD IN YOUR VIEW. 	
	OK--BUT THEN JOE STILL DIDNT PUT HIS JUNK IN THE GARAGE! HE LIKES TO 
KEEP THE FLOOR CLEAR FOR ENGINE OVERHAULS, YOU SEE. OH, AND ONE MORE 
THING, THIS MAN KEEPS A BARKING, PEOPLE-CHASING DOG THAT IS THE TRUE 
TERROR OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
	THATS BACKGROUND TO WHAT HAPPENED LAST MONDAY. WHEN LITTLE 
KARYO, WHO IS NO RELATION TO HIM, FIBBED AND SAID THAT I HAD YELLED AT HIM, 
OUR NEIGHBOR JOE BLEW HIS TOP AND STARTED READING ME THE RIOT ACT. HE 
HYPERVENTILATED FOR A GOOD 40 MINUTES, AND I STOOD TOE TO TOE WITH HIM, LET 
HIM KNOW WHEN HE WAS OUT OF LINE, INSISTED ON HAVING MY SAY IN THE DISPUTE 
AND FINALLY WALKED HIM BACK TO HIS HOUSE TO SIMMER DOWN. OF COURSE, THE 
ISSUE ABOUT THE THRASHED PLANTS WAS ONLY THE ONE ON THE SURFACE. 
LURKING UNDERNEATH WAS THE YAWNING CHASM OF JUST HOW DIFFERENT WE ARE 
FROM EACH OTHER, AND HOW HE IS A FULL-TIMER UP THERE AND I AM ONLY A PART, 
PART-TIMER. BASICALLY HE RESENTS ME BECAUSE I LIVE IN TWO PLACES, EVEN 
THOUGH I ONLY OWN ONE OF THEM. WE CAN PICK OUR FRIENDS, BUT WE SURE CANT 
PICK OUR NEIGHBORS.
	I WAS VERY GLAD THAT THE LORD BLESSED ME TO MAINTAIN MY COMPOSURE 
THROUGHOUT AND NOT TRY TO GIVE AS GOOD AS I GOT. ACTUALLY I THINK IT WILL 
PROVE HELPFUL THAT JOE GOT HIS GRIPES OFF HIS CHEST. IT SURE WOULDNT HAVE 
HELPED FOR THIS FOUL STUFF TO HAVE SIMMERED ANY LONGER. NOW I AM NOT SO 
NAIVE TO THINK THAT WELL NOW BECOME THE BEST OF BUDDIES. THATS NOT 
POSSIBLE BECAUSE I POLITELY DECLINED JOES OFFER OF A DRINK LAST YEAR AND 
TOLD HIM I HAD TAKEN THE PLEDGE. HIS BUDDIES DRINK, PERIOD. BUT BY AND BY, 
THINGS WILL PROBABLY BE A LITTLE BETTER NOW THAT THE AIR HAS BEEN CLEARED.
	THE PROVERBS OF THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES TEACH US THAT A MAN WITHOUT 
SELF-CONTROL IS LIKE A CITY BROKEN INTO AND LEFT WITHOUT WALLS. (PROVERBS 
25.28) WHAT A FANTASTIC IMAGE, AND HOW WELL IT APPLIES TO MY NEIGHBOR. AND 
ANOTHER: MAKE NO FRIENDSHIP WITH A MAN GIVEN TO ANGER, NOR GO WITH A 
WRATHFUL MAN, LEST YOU LEARN HIS WAYS AND ENTANGLE YOURSELF IN A SNARE.  
(PROVERBS 22.24-25) ANOTHER: HE WHO IS SLOW TO ANGER HAS GREAT 
UNDERSTANDING, BUT HE WHO HAS A HASTY TEMPER EXALTS FOLLY. (PROVERBS 
14.29) ONE MORE: A SOFT ANSWER TURNS AWAY WRATH, BUT A HARSH WORD STIRS 
UP ANGER.  (PROVERBS 15.1)
	YESTERDAY THERE WAS AN AMAZING SET OF STATISTICS FROM A GEORGE 
BARNA POLL PRINTED IN THE RELIGION SECTION OF THE NEWSPAPER. THE ONE THAT 
STRUCK ME THE HARDEST IS THAT ALTHOUGH 90% OF AMERICANS OWN A BIBLE, 
ONLY ABOUT 20% OF THEM READ THE BIBLE REGULARLY. ONE OF THE REASONS 
MOST OFTEN GIVEN FOR THIS LOW BIBLE READING RATE WAS THAT THE FOLK DIDNT 
SEE THE RELEVANCE OF THE BIBLE FOR DAILY LIFE. IF THATS TRUE, THEN THE FAULT 
BELONGS TO PREACHERS, PASTORS AND BIBLE TEACHERS FOR NOT DOING THEIR 
JOB MORE THOROUGHLY.
	I SAY UNTO YOU THAT THIS SECTION OF PAULS LETTER TO THE CHURCH AT 
ROME HAS SOME OF THE MOST PROFOUND SIGNIFICANCE FOR EVERYDAY LIFE THAT 
YOU CAN FIND ANYWHERE IN THE ENTIRE BIBLE APART FROM THE ACTUAL 
TEACHINGS OF JESUS HIMSELF. FOR IN ROMANS PAUL LAYS OUT THE THEOLOGY OF 
SALVATION MORE CLEARLY AND WITH GREATER DETAIL THAN HE DOES ANYWHERE 
ELSE.
	IN OUR SCRIPTURE FOR TODAY, PAUL DESCRIBES THE MINDSET OF A 
CHRISTIAN. I CALL IT A SPIRITUAL MINDSET. NOW MINDSET IS NOT A BIBLICAL TERM. 
YOU WONT FIND THE WORD MINDSET IN YOUR CONCORDANCE. ITS ACTUALLY A 
PSYCHOLOGICAL TERM WHICH REFERS TO THE PRE-CONDITION OF A CERTAIN 
COLORING ATTITUDE, A PRE-SUPPOSITION WHICH PEOPLE CARRY AROUND WITH 
THEM WHEREVER THEY GO. 
	FOR A MINUTE LETS THINK ABOUT DIFFERENT MINDSETS. HAVE YOU EVER 
KNOWN SOMEONE WHO ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE FEELING SORRY FOR SOMETHING OR 
SOMEONE ELSE? ITS NOT ALWAYS BECAUSE THERES SOMETHING TO BE SORRY 
ABOUT; IT MAY JUST BE THAT THEY HAVE A PITYING MINDSET, WHICH IS A SUBTLE 
WAY FOR THEM TO FEEL SUPERIOR, SO AS TO COMPENSATE FOR FEELING INFERIOR. 
	OR WHAT ABOUT SOMEONE WITH A PERFECTIONIST MINDSET? SUCH PEOPLE 
ARE THE WORLDS GREATEST FAULTFINDERS, NITPICKERS AND FUN-SPOILERS. HOW 
THEY BUG US! SOMEONE WITH A MINDSET FOR MONEY CANT HAVE THE SIMPLEST 
CONVERSATION WITH ANOTHER PERSON WITHOUT LOOKING FOR THE WAY IT CAN 
PROFIT THEM PERSONALLY. IN THIS ENDLESS QUEST FOR MORE AND MORE MONEY, 
THEIR SOULS ARE DRIVEN TO BANKRUPTCY. AND WHAT ABOUT AN ANGRY MINDSET?
	I THINK THAT IT WOULD GREATLY HELP EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US TO 
SEARCH OUR THOUGHTS AND TRY TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE HAVE ANY SUCH 
COLORING ATTITUDES WHICH WE CARRY AROUND WITH US. WHAT IS YOUR MINDSET? 
IS IT POSSIBLE TO CHANGE A PERSONS MINDSET, OR IS A MIND, ONCE SET, SET 
FOREVER?
	PAUL TEACHES US THAT THERE ARE BASICALLY ONLY TWO CATEGORIES OF 
MINDSETS: CARNAL AND SPIRITUAL. ALL THE DIFFERENT CASTS OF MIND BOIL DOWN 
TO ONE OR THE OTHER OF THESE TWO. OUR MINDS ARE EITHER SET UPON THINGS OF 
THE FLESH, OR THEY ARE SET UPON THE THINGS OF THE SPIRIT. ITS REALLY THAT 
SIMPLE. 
	IN A RECENT ISSUE OF GUIDEPOSTS MAGAZINE, I READ A WONDERFUL LETTER 
TO THE EDITOR. IN IT THE PERSON COMPARED CONTEMPORARY LIFE TO A DRIVERS 
EDUCATION CLASS. WHAT IF, HE ASKED, THE STUDENTS IN DRIVERS ED WERE 
TAUGHT TO DRIVE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD, UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU WISH 
TO DRIVE ON THE LEFT...MOST PEOPLE DRIVE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD, BUT 
SOME PREFER TO DRIVE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD...IF YOU DECIDE TO DO THIS, 
ALWAYS WEAR A SEAT BELT...SEAT BELTS SAVE LIVES. OF COURSE, WE WOULD 
NEVER TOLERATE SUCH AN APPROACH TO DRIVER EDUCATION, NOW WOULD WE? BUT 
ISNT IT POSSIBLY TRUE THAT WE DO TOLERATE SUCH AN APPROACH TO OTHER 
KINDS OF EDUCATION, SUCH AS SEX EDUCATION OR EVEN RELIGIOUS EDUCATION?
	NOW MAYBE THE AUTOMOTIVE ANALOGY JUST SOUNDS WAY TOO SIMPLE FOR 
YOU. SOME MAY ASK, ISNT THERE MORE OF A GRAY AREA IN LIFE THAN THAT? NOT 
ACCORDING TO PAUL THERE ISNT. LETS COMPARE THE SPIRITUAL MINDSET AND THE 
CARNAL MINDSET. SIX COMPARISONS:
	1. THE CARNAL MINDSET LEADS TO DEATH; 
		THE SPIRITUAL MINDSET LEADS TO LIFE.
	2. THE CARNAL MINDSET IS HOSTILE TO GOD; 
		THE SPIRITUAL MINDSET LOVES GOD AND PLEASES GOD.
	3. THE CARNAL MINDSET IS IN BONDAGE TO THE LAW OF SIN AND DEATH;
		THE SPIRITUAL MINDSET IS FREE FROM THE LAW OF SIN AND DEATH.
	4. THE CARNAL MINDSET DOES NOT KNOW CHRIST;
		THE SPIRITUAL MINDSET KNOWS CHRIST AS LORD AND SAVIOR.
	5. THE CARNAL MINDSET WILL DIE FOREVER;
		THE SPIRITUAL MINDSET WILL BE RESURRECTED WITH CHRIST.
	6. THE CARNAL MINDSET IS CONDEMNED;
		THE SPIRITUAL MINDSET IS PARDONED.
	I WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS PRETTY MUCH AN EITHER-OR SITUATION, WOULDNT 
YOU? AND WHICH MINDSET WOULD YOU PREFER TO HAVE? WHICH MINDSET OFFERS 
US THE BETTER DEAL? WHICH ONE HAS SUPERIOR BENEFITS? WHICH ONE? THE 
SPIRITUAL MINDSET, THATS RIGHT. NOW WERE GETTING SOMEWHERE.
	IF ANY REASONABLE PERSON WOULD CHOOSE THE SPIRITUAL MINDSET OVER 
THE CARNAL MINDSET, THEN WHATS THE NEXT STEP? HOW DO WE OBTAIN THE 
SPIRITUAL MINDSET? IS IT POSSIBLE TO LOSE THE SPIRITUAL MINDSET ONCE WE HAVE 
OBTAINED IT? WHAT HAPPENS THEN?
	THE KEY TO THIS WHOLE MINDSET THEOLOGY IS THE PAULINE BAPTISMAL 
FORMULA IN CHRIST. ITS RIGHT THERE IN VERSE ONE: THERE IS THEREFORE NOW 
NO CONDEMNATION FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN CHRIST JESUS.--MEANING BAPTIZED. 
THIS IS THE TRUE POWER OF HOLY BAPTISM, THE SACRAMENT OF GODS INFINITE 
ACCEPTANCE OF US THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF JOHN THE BAPTIST AND JESUS THE 
CHRIST. BAPTISM IS A DIVINE ACT OF PARDON, AN INITIATIVE ON GODS PART, AN 
UNCONDITIONAL OFFER OF NEW LIFE. WHEN WE RECEIVE GODS GIFT OF BAPTISM WE 
ARE INITIATED INTO THE FAMILY OF THE REDEEMED AND BLESSED CHILDREN OF THE 
HEAVENLY FATHER.
	SO ONCE AGAIN, TO BORROW THE PHRASE OF ROSS PEROT, ITS THAT SIMPLE. 
IN ORDER TO RECEIVE A SPIRITUAL MINDSET, WE SIMPLY NEED TO ACCEPT THE FACT 
THAT WE ARE ACCEPTED BY GOD, AND CLAIM THE POWER AND THE MEANING OF OUR 
OWN BAPTISM. ONCE BAPTIZED, ITS POSSIBLE FOR A CHRISTIAN TO SWERVE AWAY 
FROM THE SPIRITUAL MINDSET BACK TOWARD THE DISCREDITED CARNAL MINDSET 
WHICH THE SPIRITUAL MINDSET CAME TO REPLACE. IN ORDER TO GUARD AGAINST 
THIS TENDENCY TO DRIFT OFF COURSE, ITS IMPORTANT THAT WE ENGAGE FAITHS 
FORWARD GEAR AND DRIVE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD. THIS MEANS THAT WE 
MUST, TO USE THE EXPRESSION OF BROTHER THEODORE, PRACTICE THE PRESENCE 
OF CHRIST. 
	IN WHATEVER LIFE SITUATIONS WE MIGHT FIND OURSELVES, THERE IS A CHRIST-
LIKE WAY TO BEHAVE AND THERE IS A CHRIST-DENYING WAY TO BEHAVE. IN ORDER 
TO FIND THE CHRIST-LIKE WAY TO BEHAVE, WE MUST SINCERELY PRAY FOR THE MIND 
OF CHRIST TO BE EXPRESSED THROUGH OUR MINDS, OUR WORDS AND OUR ACTIONS. 
HOW WOULD JESUS HAVE REACTED IN THIS SITUATION? WHAT WOULD HE HAVE SAID? 
HOW WOULD HE HAVE BLESSED THOSE WHO PERSECUTED HIM? HOW WOULD HE 
HAVE FORGIVEN THOSE WHO WRONGED HIM? NOW WERE NOT GOING TO BECOME 
SKILLED AT THIS KIND OF CHRIST-LIKENESS OVERNIGHT, BUT I CAN GUARANTEE YOU 
ONE THING: WE GET BETTER AT IT WITH PRACTICE. I THANK GOD FOR SENDING ME MY 
AWFUL NEIGHBOR UP NORTH, FOR HE DEMONSTRATES THE CARNAL MINDSET, AND 
WITH HIS EXAMPLE, I AM HELPED TO WORK ON MY OWN SPIRITUAL MINDSET.
	I CLOSE WITH THIS VERSE, A PRAYER REALLY, WRITTEN BY AMY CARMICHAEL. 
MAY IT BE A PRAYER FOR YOU TO USE DURING THE ROUGH TIMES AND THE TENSE 
MOMENTS OF LIFE, SO THAT YOU MAY ACQUIRE AND MAINTAIN A SPIRITUAL MINDSET. 
ITS IMPORTANT TO THINK OF TREES HERE, STURDY TREES, STANDING STRONG 
AGAINST THE WIND WITH THICK TRUNKS, STOUT BRANCHES AND DEEP, SOIL-GRIPPING 
ROOTS.
		GOD OF THE GALLANT TREES,
		GIVE TO US FORTITUDE;
		GIVE AS THOU GIVEST TO THESE
		VALOROUS HARDIHOOD. 
		WE ARE THE TREES OF THY PLANTING, O GOD.
		NOW LET THE LIFE-SAP RUN
		CLEAN THROUGH OUR EVERY VEIN.
		PERFECT THAT THOU HAST BEGUN,
		GOD OF THE SUN AND RAIN:
		THOU WHO DOST MEASURE THE WEIGHT OF THE WIND,
		FIT US FOR STRESS AND FOR STRAIN.
	LET GODS PEOPLE SAY AMEN.

VICTORIOUS	SERMON BY REV. RICH LA SHURE
ROMANS 8.31-39	JULY 28, 1996

	IT HAS BEEN A GREAT WEEK OF OLYMPIC COMPETITION, LITERALLY THE BEST 
TELEVISION IN THE KNOWN WORLD EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. THE OLYMPICS ARE SO 
GOOD THAT ITS EASY TO GET HOOKED AND JUST LET AN ENTIRE EVENING SLIP AWAY 
UNNOTICED. I AM DISCIPLINING MYSELF TO GET UP AND DO THINGS AROUND THE 
HOUSE OR IN THE GARAGE, LEAVING THE TV ON SO THAT I CAN COME BACK AND 
CHECK UP ON IT FROM TIME TO TIME. I FIND THAT ITS EASIEST TO BREAK AWAY WHEN 
MENS BASKETBALL IS ON, FOR THE SO-CALLED DREAM TEAM DISGUSTS ME. THIS 
BUNCH OF OVERSIZED, GROSSLY OVERPAID WHINGERS WITH THEIR PARTIES AND 
THEIR LIMOUSINES AND THEIR ROOMS AT THE OMNI HOTEL INSTEAD OF AT THE 
OLYMPIC VILLAGE ARE REALLY GIVING THE UNITED STATES A CAULIFLOWER EAR. 
WHATS A WHINGER? OH, THATS FROM THE EXPRESSIVE AUSTRALIAN VERB TO 
WHINGE. TO WHINGE IS TO WHINE AND TO CRINGE AT THE SAME TIME. AUSSIE 
PARENTS OF THE TOUGH-LOVE SCHOOL TELL THEIR CHILDREN NOT TO WHINGE, 
PERIOD. MOTHERS, DONT LET YOUR SONS GROW UP TO BE NBA PLAYERS.
	I HAVE ONE MORE CRITICISM ABOUT THE OLYMPICS TO GET OFF MY CHEST. IM 
REALLY SICK AND TIRED OF THOSE ADS FOR REEBOK SHOES WHICH ALWAYS 
CONCLUDE WITH THE UNBELIEVABLY ARROGANT WORDS THIS IS MY PLANET. ONE 
OF THE ADS EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO HAVE A MANS VOICE GROWLING, YOU DONT 
WIN SILVER...YOU LOSE GOLD...THIS IS MY PLANET. NOW THATS AN ATTITUDE THAT I 
AM SURE THE DREAM TEAM CAN GET BEHIND! 
	WHEN BELARUSSIAN GYMNAST VITALY SCHERBO FINISHED THIRD BEHIND LI 
XIAOSHUANG OF CHINA AND ALEXEI NEMOV OF RUSSIA, IT JUST WASNT GOOD 
ENOUGH FOR HIM. SCHERBO IS THE MAN WHOSE WIFE NEARLY DIED IN A CAR 
ACCIDENT LAST CHRISTMAS AND WAS IN A COMA FOR OVER ONE MONTH. FEARING 
THAT SHE MIGHT DIE, HE RETIRED FROM TRAINING TO BE AT HER BEDSIDE. WHEN SHE 
REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS SHE MADE HIM PROMISE TO RETURN TO GYMNASTICS. 
THATS A GREAT STORY, AND IT REALLY ADDED SOME DRAMA TO THE COMPETITION. 
BUT WHEN SCHERBO LEFT THE AWARDS PLATFORM, HE DISDAINFULLY REMOVED THE 
BRONZE MEDAL FROM HIS NECK. LATER ON, HE HUNG THE BLAME ON HIS WIFE WHOM 
HE SAID WAS WAITING FOR A GOLD MEDAL. IN MY FAMILY, WE DONT KNOW MEDALS 
OF ANOTHER COLOR. ARE THOSE THE WORDS OF A FIERCE COMPETITOR WITH MUCH 
TO BE GRATEFUL FOR, OR JUST A POOR SPORT? YOU TELL ME. I HOPE HIS REEBOKS 
GIVE HIM TOENAIL FUNGUS!
	OF COURSE, AFTER LAST TUESDAY EVENING AMERICA NOW HAS A NEW 
OLYMPIC HERO: KERRI STRUG OF THE WOMENS GYMNASTICS TEAM. HER PICTURE 
WILL BE ON MORE MAGAZINE COVERS THAN MICHAEL JORDANS IN THE DAYS AND 
WEEKS AHEAD. STRUGS VALIANT PERFORMANCE IN THE VAULT EVENT WILL BE 
FOREVER ETCHED IN OUR MEMORY. BY NOW YOUVE PROBABLY HEARD THE STORY 
SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY, BUT LET ME JUST REVIEW THE DETAILS: GOING INTO THE 
OPTIONAL PORTION OF THE COMPETITION, THE UNITED STATES TEAM WAS A CLOSE 
SECOND BEHIND RUSSIA, WHOSE COACH HAD ALREADY LED THE RUSSIAN MEN TO A 
TEAM GOLD MEDAL. IT LOOKED LIKE THE OLD RED MACHINE WAS STILL IN FINE 
WORKING ORDER. LED BY WILLOWY SVETLANA CHORKINA, THE RUSSIANS WERE 
STRONG IN EVERY ONE OF THE FIRST FIVE ROTATIONS. FINALLY, IT CAME DOWN TO 
THE SIXTH AND FINAL ROTATION AND MIRACULOUSLY, THE AMERICANS WERE AHEAD 
BY NEARLY A FULL POINT. THUS THE STAGE WAS SET FOR WHAT WAS ONE OF THE 
GREATEST AMERICAN VICTORIES IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE OLYMPICS.
	THERE ARE SEVEN WOMEN ON A GYMNASTICS TEAM, AND THE LOWEST SCORE 
IN EACH ROTATION IS NOT COUNTED IN THE TALLY. OUR TEAMS FINAL EVENT WAS 
THE VAULT, AND THE RUSSIAN TEAMS FINAL EVENT WAS THE FLOOR EXERCISE. IN 
THE WOMENS VAULT EACH ATHLETE GETS TWO SHOTS, COUNTING ONLY THE HIGHER 
OF THE TWO SCORES. ONE BY ONE, THESE YOUNG WOMEN CAME BLAZING DOWN THE 
RUNWAY, LEAPED, SOARED, TUMBLED AND TWISTED WITH UNBELIEVABLE GRACE, 
AND CAME DOWN FOR A LANDING. THEIR VAULTS WERE GREAT, BUT NONE OF THEM 
STUCK THEIR LANDING--THEY WERE SO PUMPED UP THAT THEY KEPT OVER-
ROTATING, WHICH CAUSED THEM TO MAKE A STEP OR HOP AT THE END. DOMINIQUE 
DAWES TOOK A HUGE STEP, AND IT COST HER A NEAR-PERFECT SCORE. BUT THE 
SCORES WERE STILL GOOD UNTIL THE OTHER DOMINIQUE, DOMINIQUE MOCEANU OF 
HOLLYWOOD, CA CAME UP. MEANWHILE THE RUSSIANS WERE CRANKING OUT 9.7S 
OUT OF A POSSIBLE 10 ON THE FLOOR EXERCISE. A FLOOR EXERCISE TAKES 70 TO 90 
SECONDS TO COMPLETE WHILE A VAULT IS OVERWITH IN LESS THAN 10 SECONDS. 
	MOCEANU UNDER-ROTATED AND FELL ON HER FIRST VAULT, SITTING DOWN ON 
THE LANDING. THE NBC ANALYSTS FIGURED THAT A 9.7 MARK WOULD CLINCH THE 
GOLD MEDAL FOR AMERICA. SHE STILL HAD ANOTHER CHANCE. THEN, INCREDIBLY, 
SHE FELL DOWN AGAIN! HER TOP SCORE WAS A DISMAL 9.2, NO HELP AT ALL. THE 
LAST VAULTER FOR THE U.S. WAS 19-YEAR-OLD KERRI STRUG OF HOUSTON, TX. ONCE 
MORE, THE PROJECTED FIGURES CAME UP--A 9.6 AND CHANGE WOULD CLINCH THE 
GOLD--WELL WITHIN HER CAPABILITY. DOWN THE RUNWAY CAME KELLI STRUG, SHE 
HIT, SHE SOARED, SHE FLIPPED, SHE TWISTED--AND SHE SAT DOWN ON HER LANDING! 
THEN THE HUGE CROWD OF OVER 30,000 SPECTATORS ALL GASPED AS THEY SAW 
HER FAVOR HER LEFT FOOT AS SHE WALKED BACK TO THE START. STRUG WAS 
INJURED! 
	OVER ON THE FLOOR EXERCISE THE RUSSIANS HAD JUST CRANKED OUT 
ANOTHER BIG SCORE. TWO RUSSIANS WERE STILL TO GO, THEIR VERY BEST WOMEN 
ON THAT EVENT. A VAULTER IS ONLY ALLOWED 45 SECONDS BETWEEN VAULTS, OR 
ELSE THE SECOND SCORE WILL NOT BE COUNTED. STRUGS FALL GAVE HER A MARK 
IN THE 9.1 RANGE--THE TEAMS LOWEST. IF SHE COULD NOT DO BETTER THAN 
MOCEANUS 9.2, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE COUNTED IN THE TOTAL. IF THAT HAPPENED 
AND THE TWO RUSSIANS LANDED 9.9S, THEY COULD TAKE AWAY THE GOLD. 
	SO IT WAS LITERALLY CRUNCH TIME. BELA KAROLI, WHOSE WIFE MARTA IS THE 
OFFICIAL U.S. WOMENS COACH BUT WHO IS THE DE FACTO COACH FROM BEHIND THE 
PERSONAL COACHES BARRIER, MADE THE CRUCIAL DECISION OF A FIELD 
COMMANDER. HE SHOUTED, WE NEED ANOTHER, KERRI! AND THE LIMPING KERRI 
STRUG SHOUTED BACK, I WILL! I WILL! I WILL! AT THAT POINT, NO ONE KNEW THE 
SEVERITY OF THE INJURY SHE HAD SUFFERED ON THE FIRST VAULT. ALL STRUG KNEW 
WAS THAT SHE COULDNT FEEL HER LEFT FOOT REAL WELL.
	YOUVE GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT ALL OVER THE WORLD, YOUNG WOMEN 
GYMNASTS LITERALLY REVERE BELA KAROLI, THE ROMANIAN OLYMPIC COACH WHO 
LED HIS TEAM TO GOLD IN THE 84 AND 88 GAMES. HIS STRICT TRAINING METHODS 
ARE CONTROVERSIAL, BUT HE DELIVERS THE GOODS. KAROLI DEFECTED TO THE USA 
AND HIS SUPERSTAR GYMNAST NADIA COMANICI FOLLOWED HIM. HE HAS TURNED THE 
AMERICAN PROGRAM AROUND, AND CONSIDERS THE CURRENT TEAM TO BE THE BEST 
GROUP OF ATHLETES HE HAS EVER COACHED. WHEN BELA KAROLI SAYS THAT HE 
NEEDS ANOTHER VAULT, THERE IS NO FEMALE GYMNAST ANYWHERE WHO WOULD 
NOT PULL HERSELF OFF A TRAINERS TABLE TO GIVE IT TO HIM.
	FOR A MOMENT, IT WAS AS THOUGH TIME WERE SUSPENDED IN THE TENSION OF 
ANTICIPATION. KELLI STRUG SAYS THAT SHE PRAYED TO GOD FOR HELP. THEN DOWN 
THE RUNWAY SHE CAME, BLASTED OFF, AND STUCK HER LANDING--ON ONE FOOT! 
HER LEFT FOOT BARELY TOUCHED THE MAT UPON IMPACT. SHE LIFTED HER ARMS 
UPWARD IN THE GESTURE OF VICTORY, TURNED AROUND, AND QUICKLY COLLAPSED 
IN PAIN. THE SCORE FOR HER VAULT WAS A LITTLE OVER 9.7, AND IT CLINCHED THE 
GOLD MEDAL FOR THE AMERICANS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OLYMPIC HISTORY.
	WHEN I SAW STRUG HIT HER SECOND VAULT, I LOST EMOTIONAL CONTROL. 
PROBABLY SOME OF YOU LOST IT, TOO. I WAS SO PROUD OF HER AND THE OTHER 
WOMEN ON OUR TEAM WHICH IS NOW THE WORLDS BEST. AND I WAS SO TOUCHED BY 
THE COURAGE IT TOOK FOR HER TO EVEN ATTEMPT THAT SECOND VAULT. LATER ON, 
X-RAYS REVEALED NO BROKEN BONES BUT AN MRI FOUND TWO TORN LIGAMENTS IN 
STRUGS LEFT ANKLE. SO SHE SACRIFICED HER CHANCE AT AN INDIVIDUAL MEDAL IN 
ORDER TO BRING ONE HOME FOR HER TEAM.
	BY THE NEXT MORNING THE SECOND-GUESSERS AND MONDAY MORNING 
QUARTERBACKS FIGURED OUT THAT IN RETROSPECT, THE AMERICANS WOULD HAVE 
STILL WON THE GOLD WITHOUT STRUGS SECOND VAULT. OR SO THEY CONJECTURED, 
USING THE FINAL TWO SCORES OF THE RUSSIANS FOR COMPARISON. BUT REMEMBER: 
THOSE RUSSIAN SCORES HAD NOT YET BEEN POSTED WHEN STRUG MADE HER 
SECOND VAULT, FOR THE PERFORMANCES WERE STILL TO COME. WHO CAN SAY 
WHAT THE RUSSIANS WOULD HAVE SCORED WITHOUT HER AWESOME PROOF OF 
AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS? IT HAD TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON THEM--YOU CAN 
BELIEVE IT KEPT THE PRESSURE ON THEM--SO DONT TELL ME THAT HER VAULT 
WASNT NEEDED!
	ABOVE ANYONE ELSE IN THE OLYMPICS, KERRI STRUG SHOWS WHAT IT TAKES 
TO BE A WINNER, AND HIDDEN WITHIN THE DETAILS OF HER VICTORY ARE THE 
ELEMENTS OF A TRUE BIBLICAL PARABLE. THE PARABLE ILLUSTRATES OUR 
SCRIPTURE FOR THIS MORNING, PAULS EXHORTATION TO THE CHURCH AT ROME, THE 
VERY HEART OF HIS EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS.
	ITS MUCH, MUCH MORE THAN MERELY HAVING A WINNING ATTITUDE OR THE 
POWER OF POSITIVE THINKING. THIS SCRIPTURE CASTS THE SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION 
FOR VICTORIOUS LIVING, OR, TO USE THE WORDS OF PAUL HIMSELF, WHAT IT MEANS 
TO BE EVEN MORE THAN A CONQUEROR. I SEE FIVE POWERFUL AFFIRMATIONS 
EMANATING FROM THIS LIFE-CHANGING SCRIPTURE:
	1. GOD IS FOR US. IF THAT IS TRUE, 
		THEN WHO CARES WHO MAY BE AGAINST US?
	2. IF GOD GAVE US HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON, 
		THEN GOD WILL SURELY ALSO GIVE US EVERYTHING ELSE WE MAY NEED.
	3. IF GOD JUSTIFIES US, THEN NO ONE CAN CONDEMN US.
	4. THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST FROM THE DEAD IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL
		FOR HIS ABILITY TO INTERCEDE FOR US AND OUR SINS BEFORE THE RIGHT 
		HAND OF GOD. 
	5. NOTHING IN ALL CREATION CAN EVER SEPARATE US 
		FROM THE LOVE OF GOD, EVER AGAIN.
	ONLY GOD CAN GIVE US THE ADVANCE ASSURANCE OF VICTORY. THE ADVANCE 
ASSURANCE OF VICTORY IS NOT WELL-KNOWN BY THE WORLD, BUT CAN ONLY BE 
FULLY KNOWN BY THE JUSTIFIED BELIEVER IN JESUS CHRIST. IT IS GOD WHO 
JUSTIFIES... (VERSE 33) WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE JUSTIFIED?
	DURING HIS SERMON AT THE SATURDAY CELEBRATION OF THE HARVEST 
CRUSADE, PASTOR GREG LAURIE GAVE THE BEST DEFINITION OF JUSTIFICATION THAT 
I HAVE EVER HEARD. JUSTIFICATION IS USUALLY A RATHER DRY CONCEPT FROM 
EARLY LUTHERAN THEOLOGY. MARTIN LUTHER WANTED TO INVALIDATE THE ROMAN 
CATHOLIC NOTION THAT A WEALTHY PERSON COULD GUARANTEE A BETTER PLACE 
FOR THEMSELVES IN HEAVEN THROUGH THEIR GOOD WORKS, SYMBOLIZED BY THE 
FUND-RAISING GIMMICK OF SELLING SO-CALLED INDULGENCES OR SPECIAL PAPAL 
BLESSINGS. HE CALLED SUCH INDULGENCES ANTI-CHRIST: FOR THEY IGNORED THE 
SAVING POWER OF THE BLOOD OF JESUS, POURED OUT FOR ALL PEOPLE FOR THE 
FORGIVENESS OF SINS.
	IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND JUSTIFICATION, GREG LAURIE TOLD US, IMAGINE 
YOURSELF ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT, SO FAR IN DEBT THAT THERE IS NO WAY 
YOU CAN EVER POSSIBLY CLEAR UP THE DEBT. HOW AWFUL--HOW TERRIBLE IT 
WOULD FEEL! YOU CONSIDER ALL OF YOUR OPTIONS: DECLARING BANKRUPTCY, 
RUNNING AWAY AND CHANGING YOUR NAME, EVEN ENDING YOUR OWN LIFE AHEAD 
OF ITS TIME. BUT JUST WHEN THE SITUATION LOOKS BLEAKEST, A FRIEND COMES TO 
YOU AND SAYS THAT YOUR DEBT HAS BEEN PAID. YOU PROTEST IN DISBELIEF: 
YOURE CRAZY; I OWE A MILLION DOLLARS! GO TO THE BANK AND CHECK YOUR 
ACCOUNT BALANCE NOW, URGES THE FRIEND. NO WAY! YOU SAY. BUT THE FRIEND 
PERSISTS, NOW JUST DO THIS THING ONE TIME FOR ME--GO AND CHECK YOUR 
ACCOUNT. AND WHEN YOU DO, YOU DISCOVER TO YOUR ABSOLUTE AMAZEMENT 
THAT YOUR FRIEND IS RIGHT. YOUR DEBT HAS BEEN WIPED AWAY! YOU NO LONGER 
OWE A MILLION DOLLARS! AND WHAT IS MORE, THERE IS A POSITIVE BALANCE IN 
YOUR ACCOUNT OF $5 MILLION! AND THAT IS JUSTIFICATION! IN MY QUARTER-
CENTURY OF MINISTRY I HAD NEVER BEFORE HEARD 60,000 CHRISTIANS CHEERING 
ABOUT JUSTIFICATION; IT LITERALLY SENT CHILLS DOWN MY SPINE.  
	NOW IMAGINE HOW MUCH DIFFERENT, HOW MUCH BETTER YOUR LIFE WOULD BE 
IF YOU COULD JUST HOLD ONTO THAT TREMENDOUS FEELING OF BEING JUSTIFIED, 
YOUR DEBIT RENDERED INTO A CREDIT, AS FAR ABOVE GROUND AS YOU USED TO BE 
IN A HOLE. THATS THE MEANING OF BEING MORE THAN A CONQUEROR. THE 
TROUBLE WITH WORLDLY CONQUERORS, YOU SEE, IS THAT TOO OFTEN THEY GET THE 
NOTION INTO THEIR HEAD THAT THEY ALONE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN 
SUCCESS. THEY FORGET TO GIVE DUE CREDIT TO A HIGHER POWER, THE POWER THAT 
PROVIDED THEM WITH ALL THE RESOURCES THAT WERE NEEDED TO WIN THE 
VICTORY IN THE FIRST PLACE. WITHOUT A SENSE OF GOD, CONQUERORS MAY 
LITERALLY WIND UP SNATCHING DEFEAT FROM THE JAWS OF VICTORY.
	THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN IS JUST AS IMPORTANT. TO BE JUSTIFIED DOES 
NOT MEAN THAT THERE IS NOTHING MORE WE CAN DO OR NOTHING MORE THAT WE 
NEED TO DO. ALTHOUGH CHRIST HAS SECURED THE VICTORY ALREADY, OUR 
PARTICIPATION IN HIS VICTORY IS STILL REQUIRED. THE FINAL SCORE SHOWED THAT 
KERRI STRUG MAY NOT HAVE NEEDED TO MAKE THAT SECOND VAULT, BUT SHE 
DIDNT KNOW IT AT THE TIME! ALL THAT SHE KNEW WERE FOUR THINGS: HER BOSS 
HAD CALLED FOR BETTER THAN HER BEST, THE CLOCK WAS TICKING. SHE WAS 
INJURED, AND THAT HER TEAMS HOPES AND DREAMS WERE RESTING IN HER 
SHOULDERS. SO KERRI DID THE ONE THING THAT ANY CHRISTIAN SHOULD DO WHEN 
THE CHIPS ARE DOWN AND ITS DO OR DIE: SHE PRAYED TO GOD, FROM WHENCE 
COMETH HER HELP. AND THEN SHE SOARED INTO THE HISTORY BOOKS. 
	MY PRAYER FOR YOU TODAY IS THAT YOU WOULD LEARN THE SECRET AND 
THAT YOU WOULD TASTE THE THRILL OF VICTORIOUS LIVING THROUGH JESUS CHRIST 
OUR RESURRECTED LORD. FOR NOTHING IN ALL CREATION, NEITHER LOSING NOR 
WINNING, CAN EVER SEPARATE YOU FROM HIS GREAT AND GRACIOUS LOVE. AMEN.

Special thanks to Michael E. Grost, who put a virtual encyclopedia of 
classic Mystery Detective fiction on the Web.  Many of the authors listed 
below are found on the Web primarily though his entries, which I have 
marked as "@ MGrost". Many others are members of Mystery Writers of America
which, oddly enough, does not yet have a Home Page.

     My father, Samuel H. Post, published Robert Bloch in paperback.  The 
     last time we spoke, I pointed out that he had a cat hair on his coat, 
     and he complimented my attention to detail and then went into a long, 
     gentle conversation about his daughter and her love of animals.  Bob 
     Bloch was a prince among men, and a king among authors.

<A HREF="http://www.Catch22.COM/SF/ARB/SFD/Davidson,Avram.html">Avram Davidson</A> @ AlphaRalpha
     an underrated genius among authors, critics, and editors, who suffered 
     from being too educated, too sophisticated, too stylish, and too 
     gentle for a predatory SF market with growing anti-literary bias.
     Born on Shakespeare's birthday (23 Apr 1923), fought with the U.S. 
     Marines and the Israeli Army, and Executive Editor of The Magazine of 
     Fantasy and Science Fiction.  As a Mystery author, he won the 
     prestigious Edgar Award.
     My father, Samuel H. Post, published him in paperback, and I 
     treasured my meetings with him.  I'm glad my wife and son had a chance 
     to meet him, at which time he gave my son a mystical blessing in 
     fluent but oddly archaic Hebrew.  Go thou, find his works, and read 
     them!

     three Brill/Maxwell books are police procedural mysteries as much
     as they're SF, and the two vampire books (which were handled at Tor not by
     the SF editor but by Michael Seidman, the mystery editor) and the short story
     "Existential Man" straddle the SF/Fantasy-Mystery line, too.  And Lee 
     is a member of Mystery Writers of America.

<H4>Edinburgh is a city whose history is written on its face. "The old 
town, with its irregular houses, stage above stage, seen as we saw it, in 
the obscurity of a rainy day, hardly resembles the work of men, it is more 
like a piling up of rocks, and I cannot attempt to describe what we saw so 
imperfectly but must say the, high as my expectation had been raised, the 
city of Edinburgh far surpassed all expectations."  Wrote Dorothy 
Wordsworth, the poet's sister. </H4><BR>

<BR>
<H4>The Calton Hill looks down on the eastern end of Princes Street.  This 
painting shows the dreamy winter city, with its smoke and fog.  Edinburgh 
has the nickname "Auld Reekie" because of its smoky atmosphere, now 
mitigated by the Clean Air Act and smokeless fuel. </H4><BR>

</TABLE><CAPTION>North Bridge and Salisbury Crags, Edinburgh, from the 
north west by Adam Bruce Thomson (1885 -1976) </CAPTION></center>

<BR>
<H4>The hill behind the crags is called Arthur's Seat, referring to the 
legend that King Arthur built his Camelot here.  It is an extinct volcano. 
Edinburgh is not top of the list when it comes to possible sites for 
Camelot, but there are some other Scottish links to Arthurian legends, 
including the possible Holy Grail castle in East Lothian.  A 19th
"Historian" was convinced that Edinburgh is the true site of Jerusalem, and 
he wrote several lengthy tomes on the subject.  Arthur's Seat was supposed 
to be Calvary Mount.</H4><BR>

<BODY>

<H2>About Euterpe Opera Theatre</H2>

<P>Euterpe Opera Theatre, founded in 1924, is now producing chamber opera. 
Our most recent production was of two comic operas, Mozart's <I>Impresario</I> 
and Pergolesi's <I>La Serva Padrona,</I> performed Jan. 8, 1995, at Van Nuys High 
School Auditorium.   In Summer, 1993, Euterpe produced Mozart's <I>Za&#239;de </I>
 at the John Anson Ford Amphitheater as part of the Summer Nights At The Ford 
Festival.  The previous year (1992), Euterpe Opera produced Haydn's 
delightful <I>Infidelity Foiled.</I>     All Euterpe Opera productions are 
dramatically staged and sung in English.</P>

<P>Euterpe Opera produced the first opera performed on the stage of the new 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in 1964.  Since that date, Euterpe has presented 
over 100 operas at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.</P>

<P>Over the years many singers have benefited from the experience of taking 
part in Euterpe productions early in their career.  Euterpe alumnae and 
alumni include:  Nadine Conner, Jerome Hines, Mary Costa, Jonathan Mack,  Karen 
Armstrong, Carole Neblett, Heinz Bankenburg, and Marvelee Cariaga.</P>

<H1>Berlin To Broadway</H1>

<H2>With Kurt Weill</H2>

<H3>text and format by Gene Lerner</H3></STRONG>
</CENTER>

<P>About Berlin to Broadway...</P>
<P>"Considered by major music critics as the greatest theatre composer of 
this century, Kurt Weill has written melodies and music with the finest 
array of lyricists and poets ever to write for the theatre of the Western 
World, including Bertold Brecht, Maxwell Anderson, Paul Green, Langston 
Hughes, Ira Gershwin, Ogden Nash, Alan Jay Lerner and others.  Through his 
art and theirs, Berlin to Broadway with Kurt Weill, encompassing 40 songs, 
gives us a panorama of twenty extraordinary years--from von Hindenburg and 
Hitler in the Germany where Weill was born, to Roosevelt and Truman in the 
America to which Weill emigrated.  A musical spectacle blending cavalcade 
and cabaret, commentary and tin-pan-alley, Berlin to Broadway with Kurt 
Weill inevitably becomes a tribute to theatre itself, an entertainment in 
salute to show business."</P>

1997 OPERA PRODUCTION BY <BR>
EUTERPE OPERA THEATRE
</CENTER></H2>


<CENTER>
<H3>Two One-Act Comic Operas: <BR>
"La serva padrona"   by Pergolesi<BR>
"Impresario"   by Mozart<BR>
 Offered for September thru November, 1997<BR></H3>
</CENTER>

<CENTER>
<P><A HREF="framed.html"><STRONG>Return to Euterpe home page.</STRONG></A>
</P>
</CENTER>

These two operas will be fully staged, with string quintet and piano, and sung in 
English.  
<P>
One of the works for which Giovanni Pergolesi (1710-1736) is best remembered 
is his intermezzo, <EM>La serva padrona. </EM>  Composed in 1733, the work was one of 
two intermezzi presented between the three acts of his opera seria, <EM>Il prigionier 
superbo.  La serva padrona</EM> was so well received in Italy, that it was soon 
performed in Dresden, Vienna, and Paris as well.  This lighthearted work is 
generally considered to be the beginning of the opera buffa genre.  In one act 
with two parts, the plot revolves around two characters: Serpina, a clever 
servant, and Umberto, her master.  Through her sharp wit and ingenuity, 
Serpina is able to elevate her station in life and achieve equality with her 
master.  The cast consists of soprano and baritone for the lead roles, and a non-
singing role for another servant.  
<P>
Mozart's singspiel, <EM>Der Schauspieldirektor (Impresario)</EM>,  K486, is a one-act 
comedy.  Composed in 1786, at the request of Emperor Joseph, for the royal 
occasion of a state visit by the Governor General of the Austrian Netherlands, 
Mozart's <EM>Impresario,</EM> was billed on a program with Antonio Salieri's <EM>Prima la 
musica, e poi le parole,</EM> or <EM>First the music, and then the words.</EM>  The librettist for 
the Mozart work was Gottlieb Stephanie, with whom the composer had 
collaborated previously  on <EM>The Abduction from the Seraglio.</EM>  The plot centers 
on the efforts of an Impresario to put together a theater group which could 
successfully perform plays, ballet, and opera in Salzberg.  In two parts, the first 
deals with auditions of actors and actresses, while in the second, two "dueling 
divas" attempt to out-do each other, each wanting to be the prima donna of the 
troupe.  Reason is restored when the troupe's composer reminds the embattled 
sopranos that, while artists must strive to achieve excellence, it is more 
important that the combined efforts please the audience than to be self serving.  
The cast consist of 2 sopranos, tenor and bass.  The Impresario is a spoken 
role.
<P>
These two charming works lend themselves well to an evening of delightful 
entertainment.

<H2>Chapter Three: His Grace</H2>



<H3>Part Five: A Taste of History</H3>
</CENTER>


<P>	In the darkness of 0600, George addressed his troops.  "We will be de-
parting soon for Scotland; thank you for being prepared.  First we will par-
ticipate in a private Discovery.  This way, please."
<P>	Kent wheeled the device Alain was lying in out onto the softly lit, 
closely cropped back lawn toward Reginald.  The Envoy was in his official saf-
fron robe that was familiar to one and all.  Reginald often led the ceremonies 
at the Cathedral of Saint Lux in London, where the cold fires of the Holy Writ 
were first traced in English.
<P>	"Even though this is a private Discovery, it is still a sacrament," said 
Reginald, "so I will not omit the prologue.
<P>	"From his birth in 653 AUC to his death in 1163, Gaius Julius Caesar was 
the first Envoy of Sol Invictus, the agent of His desires.  During his life, 
Rome grew from its center in Italy to encompass all Europe, from Ireland to 
the Urals, from Sicily to the northernmost part of Scandinavia.  The Empire at 
its height included the northern third of Africa and the former conquests of 
Alexander the Great.  The Empire was peaceful and prosperous, and ninetyeight 
percent of its citizens were Solarian.
<P>	"On the Ides of March in 709 AUC, the man Brutus, who would later be 
known as Saint Ignis, successfully entreated Sol Invictus for an unmistakable 
sign of His interest and wishes.  Brutus was in the Colosseum at the time; 
that is where the Holy Writ was inscribed in cold fire in the language now 
called Latin.  Gaius Julius Caesar was explicitly named first Envoy.  The sub-
sequent three Envoys, up to and including Reginald Smythe, have had their 
names thus inscribed.
<P>	"The first Discovery occurred in 729 AUC when Caesar laid by chance a 
wax tablet of nagging legal questions on the altar.  While Caesar asked for 
Guidance, as was his want at the relative darkness of the new moon, Sol Invic-
tus wrote clever clues on the tablets.  Caesar's investigators used the clues 
to uncover sundry crimes, plots, villains, and corruption.  Caesar's grip on 
power, already firm, became stronger since he used the information to promote 
justice.
<P>	"News of this wondrous written communication spread like wildfire 
through the Empire.  Julius was besieged by requests from all corners.  With 
some trepidation, he submitted all requests for information which seemed of 
serious intent.  The Guidance went as usual, except perhaps that those in the 
Temple universally noted that God seemed amused.  Since only 998 of the 20,439 
requests for information received answers, it was soon agreed to limit Discov-
ery questions to 1000, each to be nonfrivolous.
<P>	"In the years preceding his foul murder by the sorcerer Attila, Caesar 
shepherded the Discovery process to help the smooth running of the Empire.  
During the centuries of the dark sorcerers, now known as the Age of Unstable 
Miracles, the Envoy and Discovery were often hidden from the public eye.  The 
Empire disintegrated, and was soon after largely replaced by the adherents of 
Noneh, the materialist God.  Solarianism went into retreat until the early Re-
naissance, when the third Envoy, Brian Smythe, reconsecrated the Colosseum and 
the original Temple in the holy city of Rome.  Brian founded the Cathedral of 
Saint Lux in London, where the Holy Writ, now including the Book of Prophecy, 
was inscribed in English.
<P>	"Discovery was reinstated by Brian.  There was a flap when he accepted 
paper as well as wax tablets, but Sol Invictus answered in both media.  Paper 
became the official medium until the Year of the Dawn, when the one called 
Lord of Miracles by Sol Invictus tricked the Fourth Envoy, Reginald Smythe, 
into permitting questions to be posed on high density media, such as laser 
disks and memory crystals.  The number of questions that Sol Invictus will an-
swer is now limited only by the number of sensible questions to be asked."
<P>	Reginald looked at his family, then at the tree tops.  The light of dawn 
was strengthening.  By accident or by design, a shaft of light found Regi-
nald's head, giving him a golden halo.
<P>	"Lord of Light," said Reginald as he bowed, "our efforts on your behalf 
would be greatly aided if we could know with certainty the true origins of the 
man Alain Messier."
<P>	Holographic images soon surrounded Reginald, who looked ghostly at their 
centers.  He walked slowly out of range.
<P>	George appeared, vacationing in his late teens with Reginald in the 
south of France.  George had time on his hands one fine morning while Reginald 
met contacts.  He explored a beach which he thought was deserted.
<P>	"Like father, like son," murmured Kent a few moments later.
<P>	George blushed under his tan.  His eyes bulged when Discovery revealed 
that the young woman Mireille was a direct descendent of the eldest of Julius 
Caesar's 37 daughters.
<P>	"By the Light!" said George.  "A Merovingian princess!"
<P>	Reginald wept openly, causing a ripple of distress followed by rapt at-
tention.  George and Mireille's daughter was born in due course, then grew 
tall and beautiful.  She was lured by Jamal Hasan into imprisonment.  Rape 
followed; Alain was the result.  After his weaning, Alain was subjected by Ja-
mal to horrid rites and bizarre surgeries to establish Jamal's mind control.  
Alain was carefully and fraudulently placed into Reginald's care to spy upon 
the Duke and his other charges.
<P>	Alain's life was illustrated rapidly.  Reginald's anger flared and he 
glared at Sharazade.  At the end of the Discovery, the holo image matched the 
real form of the healing case.
<P>	"Please guide me," asked Reginald.
<P>	"Cleanse Alain fully, I repeat, fully, of the influence of the disciple 
of the Black Stone.  Then accept him completely and without reservation.  Take 
care of his daughter Leila, for she is a hanging weakness."
<P>	With that, the presence of Sol Invictus departed.  George noticed that 
Reginald's hair dye had lost its effectiveness.
<P>	Reginald looked directly at Sharazade.  "Where is Leila?"
<P>	"At the monastery in Canterbury."
<P>	"Contact them and authorize George to pick her up."
<P>	"She needs special medical assistance."
<P>	"She will get it.  Make the call."
<P>	Sharazade did that.  "She needs delicate neurosurgery and adjustments to 
her immune system."
<P>	Reginald looked at Alain, then returned his gaze to Sharazade.  "I will 
speak to my Master and to the Lord of Miracles."
<P>	"Why would the High Lord give aid to a child such as this?"
<P>	Kent and Reginald regarded one another, as did George and Danica.
<P>	Reginald said to Sharazade, "The Trickster is my distant cousin, and 
hence your blood relative.  His sense of family is very strong.  The odds are 
better than even."
<P>	"Yes, Grandfather."
<P>	Reginald looked at the others.  "Take a lesson from this.  Be very care-
ful with whom you are intimate."
<P>	"Shall we meet you here or in Scotland, Sir?" asked George.
<P>	"Scotland.  The drill is going to be very thorough.  Then the corporate 
assignments will be made.  Kent, take them to Scotland.  George, proceed at 
once to the monastery; I'll get meet you there." 
<P>	"Sir."
<P>	George moved to the armory for knives, slugthrowers, and crossbows.  
Reginald moved to the conference room for the calls.  Kent got the young peo-
ple moving toward the van.  "What shall I do with Alain, Sir?"
<P>	"Take him with you.  We will try to fix his problems permanently at your 
estate," said Reginald without stopping.
<P>	"Very good, Sir."
<P>	Danica helped Kent move Alain.  Birgit comforted Sharry.

<P>	George was in radio contact with the monastery.  There seemed to be no 
problem.  George parked the van in the circle drive.  Reginald, Julio, Juan, 
and Pablo arrived in short order.  The abbot appeared and showed them in, then 
took them to the room where Leila was cared for.
<P>	"Sharazade donated the money for her care," said the abbot.  "I thought 
you knew."
<P>	"No," said Reginald with grudging respect, "she's my granddaughter, and 
she has taken up my old profession.  She's very good, but we recently had a 
large security breach.  Our family's enemies will attempt to hurt us through 
Leila.  We will ask our Master and the Lord of Miracles to make Leila whole."
<P>	"Our prayers and efforts only showed minor improvements in her overall 
health," said the abbot.  "Why would the High One aid you?  I thought you were 
not on good terms."
<P>	Reginald blushed.  "Sol Invictus negotiated a rapprochement.  Besides, 
Oliver is my distant cousin."
<P>	The abbot nodded.  "Enough said.  Flesh of his flesh, and all that.  Is 
there anyone who isn't your distant cousin, Reginald?"
<P>	"You should know, Benedict."
<P>	"Are the shock troops mercenaries or grandsons?"
<P>	"Grandsons."
<P>	Benedict nodded.  "Let's get Leila's healing case onto a gurney."

<P>	The paraplegic beggar touched his collarbone.  "Imam."
<P>	"Report, Reza."
<P>	"They've taken your granddaughter."
<P>	"How many?  What sort of vehicle?"
<P>	"The old man, the big Bahamian, and the three eldest Latins are in a 
welldisguised all terrain assault vehicle headed north on the main road."
<P>	"Identifying marks on the ATAV?"
<P>	"It looks like an expensive yellowgold van or minibus with three doors 
on each side, one on the back.  There are no signs or stickers.  Its license 
is 4ENVOY."
<P>	The other voice paused.  "Your disguise has served us well.  Hadji is in 
India, but Ali is close enough.  I'll send him to aid you and help as I can at 
long range.  Pursue them openly.  Get Leila if at all possible."
<P>	"Yes, Imam."
<P>	Contact broke.  Reza waited a few moments for the foot traffic to clear.  
A rich carpet of vibrant color appeared.  He levitated onto it, his white in-
valid's clothes transforming to a dark robe and a turban.  He and the carpet 
sailed out of the compound in utter silence.

	"Darkness!" swore Reginald.  "Benedict just called.  One of the para-
plegics at the monastery was our old friend Reza.  He's in hot pursuit.  Per-
sonal shields up, now!  George, prepare to switch to hover mode."
<P>	The hydra appeared to starboard a few tense minutes later.  It tenta-
tively touched those in the ATAV, and was repelled by the shields and the 
healing case.  It went for the engine.  George tensed for the worst.  The hy-
dra recoiled moments later with parts missing.  It withdrew rapidly, oozing a 
sickly brownish ichor.
<P>	"Isn't that a shame?" remarked Julio in vast insincerity.
<P>	Reginald grunted in agreement.  "Reza is almost upon us."
<P>	Juan pointed to a blip on tactical.  George interjected, "Ali is flying 
in from the east.  I'm switching to hover."
<P>	Pablo asked Reginald, "Don't we have any good protection for the tires?"
<P>	"No," replied Reginald.  "Switch to mirrored surfaces."
<P>	George nodded as he pushed a button.  "Shall I get off the main road?  
There's a lot of traffic and we are getting too much attention."
<P>	"Right.  Take overland route B."
<P>	Juan said, "The sorcerers met and have gotten over their confusion at 
missing us.  They are headed directly for us.  At present rates, they will in-
tercept us in five minutes."
<P>	Reginald nodded.  "Speed up, George."
<P>	"Aye."
<P>	Reginald opened the healing case.  He gasped in surprise.  Pablo stepped 
over, as did Julio.
<P>	"What is it?" asked Juan from the tactical display.  "We've got inter-
cept in two minutes.  They sped up too."
<P>	"Leila is not exactly what I expected," understated Reginald.
<P>	"The alligator skin is particularly striking," remarked Pablo.
<P>	"The fangs caught my attention," said Julio nonchalantly.
<P>	"She's changed considerably from the time covered by the Discovery," 
said Reginald.  "Benedict probably shrouded the case to keep her from prying 
outside eyes.  In any case, I've got to know."  He put his hand over her 
heart.  A nimbus of yellow Sun light enveloped his hand and her chest.  The 
old man's eyes looked sad.  "She is Sharazade's daughter."  With a blink the 
Duke extinguished the light.  He withdrew his palm.
<P>	Suddenly Leila's eyes, dead, flat, and reptilian, snapped open.  Her 
back muscles and disproportionately small arms launched her.  She found a 
thick vein in Reginald's forearm to sink her fangs into.  His arm started 
swelling immediately from the venom.
<P>	Pablo's shield pulsed.  Leila was out of the case and slammed against 
the door in half a second.  She was enclosed in a tightening force bubble.
<P>	Reginald managed to say, "Don't kill her," before he fell.
<P>	"Evasive, George," ordered Pablo.  "Julio, you and Juan stuff Grandfa-
ther into the case, then seal it.  He has only a few seconds.  Move!"
<P>	Julio and Juan lugged the big man into the case, thanking Sol Invictus 
that their father had categorically refused to make anything but fullsized 
models.  George executed sharp turns over the countryside.
<P>	Pablo lifted the inside of his right wrist to his eyes, composing what 
he wanted to say.  Before he spoke a word, the blossom part of the small tat-
too of a cut rose lit lavender.
<P>	"Pablo," spoke the voice.  "How may I help you?"
<P>	"Sharry's daughter Leila bit Grandfather.  Leila is..."
<P>	"I understand.  You are being pursued by unfriendly elements."
<P>	"Yes.  We need help quickly."
<P>	"Tell Juan and Julio to stop gawking and close the case."
<P>	Pablo glared at his brothers.  They checked the rim for overhanging fin-
gers, then snapped it shut just before George executed a high gforce turn.  
Laser beams flashed in a flurry of near misses.
<P>	"Hold Leila still, but let her breathe."
<P>	Pablo loosened the force bubble.  Leila gasped.  The blue light from the 
healing case doubled in intensity every quarter second.
<P>	"Hold her carefully for ten seconds.  Count, Pablo."
<P>	"Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco..."
<P>	"I can't see!" yelled George, even though his goggles were ninetyeight 
percent polarized.
<P>	Pablo had long since shut his eyes tightly and covered them.  Juan and 
Julio were praying on the floor.  Leila felt different in Pablo's invisible 
grasp, even as he counted.
<P>	"Seis, siete, ocho, nueve, diez."
<P>	Pablo opened one eye experimentally.  The lighting was normal again.  
The voice from his wrist said, "Watch your driving, George."  Then the laven-
der glow flickered and vanished.
<P>	"By the light!" swore George as he veered away from a minor cliff bor-
dering a sea.  "We're at Kent's estate."  He activated a scanner.  "They are 
just about done unloading."
<P>	Pablo nodded.  Julio pointed in silence.  The fiveyearold dragon girl 
had been replaced by a light olive, normal sixweekold baby girl.
<P>	"Unless we have some diapers on board, I think we had best hurry," said 
Pablo.
<P>	George took a quick look.  He accelerated to the island.

<P>	"Did you teleport them?" asked Ali through his communicator as he swept 
the area looking for clues.
<P>	"No.  Did you?" replied Reza.
<P>	"Nor did I see an explosion.  I felt a tremendous pulse of power."
<P>	"So did I.  Stronger than the Imam."
<P>	"Or Noneh."
<P>	"Or the Stone."
<P>	"We've got a new player in the game."
<P>	"Who is not on our side."
<P>	"We're in trouble."
<P>	"Jamal must have felt it, probably Hadji as well."
<P>	"Every halftrained sensitive in the Andromeda galaxy felt it."

	Jamal Hasan cringed in his bed in Arabia.  The Creator had entered the 
fray and set back his plans.  Reginald was healed instead of dead.  Leila was 
resetthere was no other word for itto what she should have been before Ja-
mal had started altering her morphogenesis.  George and the Latins were safe.  
Jamal was still hurting from the wound George had struck, and he could no 
longer feel Alain in the least.  The hydra's probe of the ATAV engine had ac-
tivated a trap, a nearly deadly trap.
<P>	Jamal sent his mind over Homeworld to judge his position in various af-
fairs.  He found something in Scotland that he did not expect.  He grinned, 
then finally broke out laughing.
<P>	His connection to Leila still existed, though it was tenuous.  Leila was 
still a hanging weaknessfor the other side!  The Creator knew this.  The 
Creator could have changed it, but did not.  Jamal had definitely chosen the 
right side in the Great Struggle!  Confusion to the luminous!

	Sharazade suddenly became aware of something totally unexpected.  Birgit 
saw the change in her face, and drew her to one side while the others contin-
ued setting up the practice field.
<P>	"Tell me," said Birgit as patted Sharry's back softly.
<P>	Sharry was confused about how, but definite about what.  "I'm lactating.  
I've done it before, so I remember the feelings.  Does Kent's staff have any 
babies about?"
<P>	Before Birgit could answer, George floated the ATAV quietly onto the 
small beach area nearby.  "We'll have to check that out.  Let's see how the 
search for Leila turned out."
<P>	The two tall women strode to the beach.  George rapidly shut down the 
machine and got out.  He opened the back gate, then helped Julio and Juan take 
the healing case out.  Pablo came out next, handed Sharazade a bundle wrapped 
in his shirt, then took a fourth handle on the healing case.  The four big men 
trotted double time toward the small castle.
<P>	"That was His GraceGrandfather," said Birgit.  "I wonder..."
<P>	"Later," said Sharazade.  "Take the baby while I fix my dress.  We are 
going to the castle where it is marginally warmer."  She proceeded to open her 
bodice and manipulate what had been under it.
<P>	"Sharry!" exclaimed the shocked Birgit as she followed her sister.  "We 
are in the open!"
<P>	"After what everyone saw during Discovery, this is nothing.  Give me 
Leila."
<P>	Birgit's eyes grew large as she handed Leila back.  Mother and daughter 
fit together like hand in exactly the right glove.

	Jamal beamed in selfsatisfaction.  He felt what Leila felt, tasted what 
she tasted.  The experience brought forth deeply buried memories of his own 
nursing of his mother, Princess Fatima of Arabia.  The hatreds and woundings 
of his recent decades of life were momentarily washed away in a warm flood of 
feelings of security and love.
<P>	He shoved aside the war against his father, and remembered his rich 
early life.  He watched in wonder as his left halfhand, rent asunder by Brian 
Johnson in a fierce skirmish twenty years before, was made whole in the space 
of ten seconds.  He folded up the hydra and put it away.  Let the water pi-
rates fend for themselves.
<P>	He stood and walked outside his mansions to his prayer tower.  He 
climbed to the top and stared into the last part of the setting of Sol Invic-
tus.  It had been decades since he had thought of the orb as Sol Invictus in-
stead of the enemy.  As if for the first time, he heard the calls of birds and 
smelled the rich ecology about him.
<P>	What a splendid day it was!  He stared at his mended hand, at the won-
drous omen of the coming of the Creator.
