<h3>SENTENCING IN RESIDUE CASE</h3>
<P>

On July 24, 1996, W.W. Bennett Hurt was sentenced to 6 months in jail followed by 12 
months of supervised release (probation), a $2500.00 fine, and the court's special 
assessment fee.  Hurt was a livestock dealer from Blacksburg, Virginia, who offered at 
least 150 animals for slaughter for human consumption containing illegal levels of a 
variety of new animal drugs.  Mr. Hurt often knew that the animals had been 
medicated, and used false names to avoid detection by State and Federal officials.  
Many of these illegal residues were thousands of times higher than the permitted 
levels or they were residues of drugs that have not been approved for use in those 
animals.
<P>
FDA is concerned about the indiscriminate purchase and sale of animals for slaughter 
for human food that may contain illegal levels of animal drugs because of their 
potential for adverse effects on human health.  New animal drugs are approved by 
FDA with strict use requirements, including a specified time period to withdraw an 
animal from treatment prior to marketing, to assure the drug has depleted from edible 
tissue to a level that will not present harm to the consuming public.
<P>
Hurt was warned repeatedly by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Virginia 
Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services about violative drug residue that 
had been found in cows he brought to slaughter.  Despite those warnings, Hurt 
continued to sell the medicated animals.
<P>
Hurt's incarceration is expected to begin September 9, 1996.  This case was the result 
of a cooperative effort between the Department of Justice, FDA, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, and the state of Virginia.  This is the first prosecution of a livestock dealer 
for illegal residues, and should send a strong message to others in the livestock 
dealing industry to take seriously their responsibility to assure that they do not pass on 
adulterated food to the consumer.

<b><A NAME="bst6m">FREEDOM OF INFORMATION SUMMARY (continued, Part 7)</A></b><P>

 <H3><b>POSILAC&#174;</b> (sterile sometribove zinc suspension) </H3>

<b> m.  Miscellaneous Health Variables</b><P>
<b> 1) Circulating Anti-Somatotropin Binding</b><P>
The effect of sometribove on development of circulating anti-somatotropin
antibodies in treated cows was estimated by measuring anti-somatotropin binding
activity in blood samples collected from cows in the following studies and
evaluating the correlation between binding activity and certain health and
reproduction effects:<P>
Multi-lactation Chronic Animal Toxicity Study (TAS)<br>
Multi-location IM Single Dose Study (Single Dose-IM)<br>
IM/SC Bridging Study (IM/SC)<P>
The experimental design of these studies is described in Sections 6.b, 6.e,
and 6.c, respectively.  In the TAS study, blood was sampled for
anti-somatotropin binding activity during treatment weeks -2, -1, 3, 7, and
then every 8 weeks (year 1) or every 4 weeks (year 2) thereafter. In the Single
Dose-IM studies, blood was sampled during weeks -3, 2, 3, 8-9, and during the
last two weeks of treatment.  In the IM/SC study, blood was sampled during
treatment weeks -2, -1, 1, 7, and then every 6 weeks.  <P>
Binding was measured by incubation of serum with radiolabeled bovine
somatotropin followed by precipitation.  Binding activity was determined
relative to each animal's pretreatment (pre-sometribove exposure) binding
activity (negative control) and relative to rabbit polyclonal anti-somatotropin
antibody (positive control).<P>
Anti-somatotropin binding was considered positive if binding was greater
than 25 &#37; of the positive control.  The control cows did not develop
anti-somatotropin binding activity relative to their pretreatment levels.
Anti-somatotropin binding was usually detected within the first 7 weeks of
treatment in sometribove-treated cows in cases where binding was positive.  In
general, the level of binding gradually declined during the remainder of a
lactation of treatment.  Five cows in the 1800 or 3000 mg groups which achieved
positive binding levels had sustained circulating anti-somatotropin binding
greater than 25 &#37; throughout the first lactation of treatment.  During the
second lactation of the study, two cows in the 3000 mg group had
anti-somatotropin binding activity greater than 75 &#37; after week three of
treatment.  There were no apparent effects upon production response, clinical
pathology variables, fetuses, or postmortem findings in these animals.  Binding
was detected in 13 of 59 cows receiving sometribove during the first lactation
of the TAS study and 2 of 24 cows in the second year.  The binding was
associated with the immunoglobulin, IgG.  Binding also was detected in 3 of 42
sometribove-treated cows on the IM/SC study.  Binding was detected in 38 of 179
cows receiving sometribove during the Single Dose-IM study.<P>
Correlation coefficients were calculated between level of binding and the
incidence of diarrhea, fetal loss, high feed refusal, high temperature,
lameness, mastitis, and total clinical health signs. Comparisons of the
incidence of pleural and peritoneal adhesions in post mortems of TAS cows were
also made.<P>
Excluding the pleural and peritoneal adhesion data, there were 208
comparisons encompassing six studies, two parities and seven health variables.
Twenty-five of these 208 comparisons differed significantly (P&#60; 0.10) from
zero.  Approximately 21 could be expected by chance alone; 10 were related
negatively to the incidence of the variable compared to 15 which had a positive
correlation with the incidence of the variable. Also, of the 25 significant
comparisons, six were significant comparisons with occurrences of the variable
for control cows.<P>
Trends for variables which correlated significantly with increased binding
activity in more than one comparison were not consistent.  For example,
mastitis was positively correlated in the Arizona IM multiparous cows and
Dardenne IM primiparous cows, but negatively correlated in the TAS year one 600
mg dosed primiparous cows and TAS year two 600 mg dosed multiparous cows.
Similarly, body temperature was negatively correlated in the TAS year two 600
mg dosed multiparous cows but positively correlated in the IM/SC 500 mg dosed
primiparous cows. In the largest data sets, i.e., pooled Single Dose-IM study,
there were no significant correlations for primiparous cows and a single
negative correlation for multiparous cows (with the incidence of diarrhea).
For the incidence of pleural and peritoneal adhesions from the TAS study, there
also appeared to be no relationship with increased binding activity.<P>
There was no relationship of anti-somatotropin binding activity with the
health and reproduction variables examined.<P>
 <b>2) Blood Variables</b><P>
Hematology and clinical chemistry variables and selected hormones and
metabolites were measured in blood samples collected from cows in the following
studies:<P>
14-Day Drug Tolerance Study<br>
Multi-lactation Chronic Animal Toxicity Study (TAS)<br>
Multi-location IM Single Dose Study (Single Dose-IM)<br>
IM Dose Titration Study (Dose-IM)<br>
IM/SC Bridging Study (IM/SC)<P>
The experimental design and sampling schedule of each of these studies is
described in Sections 6.a, 6.b, 6.e, 6.d, 6.c, respectively.  Tables 89 and 90
list hematology and clinical chemistry variables, respectively, that were
analyzed.  In addition, selected hormones and metabolites (Table 91) also were
analyzed for each study.  Assays for prolactin, thyroid stimulating hormone,
triiodothyronine, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, ACTH,
cortisol, progesterone and estradiol were performed only for the TAS study.
For the Dose-IM study, only calcium, urea nitrogen, triglycerides, magnesium,
creatinine and phosphorus were measured.  Total protein was not determined for
the IM/SC Bridging study.<P>

<b>Hematology</b><p>
Results for all variables remained within physiologically normal ranges.
For the 14 Day Acute Toxicology study, there was a slight reduction in red
blood cell (RBC) count detected among the sometribove-treated cows although
values were within the normal physiological range.  No significant changes in
total leukocytes, differential white cell counts or platelets were noted.
<P>
Concentrations of eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and band neutrophils
were not altered by sometribove treatment in either lactation of the TAS study.
Sometribove treatment lowered most erythrocyte-associated variables such as RBC
count, hematocrit (Table 92), and hemoglobin (Table 93) during each lactation
compared to controls.  Although statistically significant differences were
observed, mean values remained within normal ranges for lactating cows.
Sometribove did not affect the incidence of immature erythrocytes and there was
no evidence of pathologic hemolysis.  No sometribove-related lesions were noted
in bone marrow or spleen of necropsied cows (see Section 6.b).  <P>
Sometribove tended to increase platelet count during each lactation of the
TAS study.  Mean platelet volume was unaffected by sometribove. Total leukocyte
and segmented neutrophil counts tended to be increased by sometribove during
both lactations.<P>
Hematology variables were determined at the time of physical examinations
in the Single Dose-IM study.  No differences were noted at the end of the first
treatment period for any measured variable.  At the examination on day 40 of
the subsequent lactation, erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume was lower in
primiparous cows that received sometribove in their first lactation.  For
multiparous cows at day 40 of the subsequent lactation, hematocrit, hemoglobin,
and mean corpuscular hemoglobin were lower for the group treated with
sometribove in the first lactation.  Mean platelet volume was higher in this
group for the same sampling period.<P>
For the Dose-IM study, hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin,
and red cell distribution width were lower in both primiparous and multiparous
cows treated with sometribove.  This effect was noted for all cows during the
treatment period and for primiparous cows at day 40 of the subsequent
lactation.  Segmented neutrophils were the only leukocyte population affected
by sometribove treatment. Neutrophils were increased for the 750 mg primiparous
cows and the 500 mg multiparous cows.<P>
The hematology results for the IM/SC study indicated that RBC count,
hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean cell volume, and mean cell hemoglobin were
slightly lower for both parity groups in sometribove-treated cows.  <P>
Because there is expected to be a consistent lowering of hematocrit and
hemoglobin values during treatment with sometribove, and because these values
are commonly determined in field diagnostics, the product labeling states that
its use has been associated with reductions in hematocrit and hemoglobin values
during treatment.<P>
<b>Clinical Chemistry and Hormones</b><p>
For the 14 Day Acute Toxicology study, serum electrolyte concentrations
were within normal ranges.  Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were
slightly reduced in sometribove-treated cows.  Circulating concentrations of
insulin, glucose and nonesterified fatty acids were elevated initially but
declined throughout the rest of the study.  Total bilirubin and sodium were
increased while magnesium was decreased in treated cows.<P>
Sometribove treatment significantly increased blood somatotropin
concentrations during each year of the TAS study.  Average somatotropin was
increased ten to thirty times over control levels.  The concentrations of
several hormones and metabolites changed in response to sustained elevations in
somatotropin.  Insulin concentration was increased during each year of study,
particularly for cows receiving 3000 mg.  Glucose and nonesterified fatty acid
concentrations also rose in response to sometribove treatment.  Data supported
results of previous studies showing a decreased sensitivity to insulin,
allowing production of more glucose for eventual synthesis of milk lactose.
Nonesterified fatty acids were primarily elevated during the early treatment
period when milk response preceded the increase in feed intake and cows were in
negative or reduced energy balance (see Section 6.h). <p>
Serum thyroxine concentrations were increased during each lactation of
sometribove treatment.  However, little or no effect was noted for thyroid
stimulating hormone or triiodothyronine, two other components of the thyroid
axis which would be expected to change if basal metabolic rate was increased.
The thyroid glands of sometribove-treated cows were histologically normal
(Section 6.b).  Thus, the change in thyroxine concentrations did not reflect a
pathologic effect.  Blood estradiol concentrations tended to be lower for
sometribove groups than controls during the first year of treatment.  <P>
Several blood minerals were affected by sometribove treatment but remained
within normal ranges.  Blood calcium concentrations were increased, phosphorus
concentrations were variably affected, and magnesium concentrations were
decreased.<P>
Sometribove treatment resulted in increased total protein concentrations,
primarily due to increased globulin fraction. Especially during the early
portion of each lactation, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were decreased by
sometribove relative to controls.  These concentration changes were consistent
with a protein sparing action of sometribove, e.g., incorporation of amino
acids into milk protein rather than degradation for energy.<P>
The lactate dehydrogenase and alanine aminotransferase activities in blood
were transiently elevated and aspartate aminotransferase activities tended to
be lower during sometribove treatment. <P>
Blood analyses also were performed on samples collected in the IM/SC,
Dose-IM, and Single Dose-IM studies.  In general, values were within normal
ranges for lactating dairy cattle and did not indicate disease or gross
alteration of metabolism.  Mean concentrations of somatotropin were higher in
treated cows and differences were greatest at mid-cycle. The most commonly
observed differences for sometribove-treated cows were reduced urea nitrogen
and elevated nonesterified fatty acids, glucose, and insulin.  Calcium levels
were elevated in treated multiparous cows sampled at 180 days of lactation
(following approximately 60 days of treatment). <P>
In summary, blood clinical chemistry, endocrine, and metabolite results
indicated sometribove treatment was safe at the use level (500 mg) and when
chronically administered to dairy cows at dosages up to 6 times the intended
use level for two lactations.  With the exception of hematocrit and hemoglobin,
the variables are not customarily determined for dairy cattle under field
conditions and differences were within normal physiologic ranges and not
associated with any clinical effect.  The product labeling includes a statement
indicating that use of sometribove has been associated with reductions in
hemoglobin and hematocrit values during treatment.<P>

<b> 3) Body Temperature</b><P>
During the conduct of three pivotal studies, rectal body temperature of all
cows on study was determined daily:<P>
Multi-lactation Chronic Animal Toxicity Study (TAS)<br>
IM Dose Titration Study (Dose-IM)<br>
IM/SC Bridging Study (IM/SC)<P>
Analysis of these data revealed a higher mean body temperature for cows
receiving sometribove.<P>
A Poisson-based logistic regression of observations of elevated rectal
temperature as a proportion of total observations was done when more than one
dose level was involved in a study (TAS and Dose-IM).  All instances of
elevated temperatures associated with a clinical health incident were
eliminated from the analysis.  Parities were pooled in the analysis.<P>
Elevated temperature was defined as greater than 103 &#176; F.  The results
in Tables 94 and 95 (below) show a strong relationship between dose and
proportion of observations of temperatures more than 103 &#176; F. <P>

<P>
The dose dependency was much steeper in the Dose-IM study, reflecting a
smaller range of doses covered than in the TAS study (0 to 750 mg as opposed to
0 to 3000 mg).<P>
Since sometribove increased the probability of observing elevated rectal
temperature linearly over the 0 to 3000 mg dose range in the TAS study,
analyses were carried out to determine if sometribove increased the probability
of observing elevated rectal temperature at the usage dose level.  It was
important to distinguish between the "1X" dose level in the TAS study (600 mg
injected IM) and the commercial dose level (500 mg injected SC).  The
probability of observing elevated rectal temperature at each dose level was
predicted using the logistic regression equation above.  The standard error of
prediction was obtained from the quadratic form involving the level of interest
and the covariance matrix of the estimates.  A conservative standard error was
used, predicting population means rather than individual animal means.
Therefore, the predicted value was the expected proportion of all daily rectal
temperature observations that might exceed 103 &#176; F.  The predicted
proportions were 0.0166 for control animals, 0.0212 for the usage level (500 mg
SC) and 0.0222 for the 1X level in the TAS study (600 mg IM). <P>
To test whether these levels differed from control, non-simultaneous 95 &#37;
confidence intervals were built around each predicted value.  For the controls,
the interval was (0.0142, 0.0192); for the commercial dose level, the interval
was (0.0187, 0.0239); and for the 1X level, the interval was (0.0198, 0.0250).
Simultaneous intervals would be larger. The incidence of elevated rectal
temperature in the 500 mg SC dose did not differ significantly from that in the
control.  Use of other cutoff points to define elevated rectal temperature
(102.5 &#176;  and 103.5 &#176; F) changed only the intercept of the equation,
not the dose dependency (slope).  In this instance, then, overdosing
sometribove caused a greater proportion of observations of rectal temperature
being above 103 &#176; F, while predicted use of the 500 mg dose showed no
significant increase in the proportion of elevated observations.<P>
The same confidence interval approach was used to compare 0 mg to 500 mg
for the Dose-IM study.  In this case, the 95 &#37; confidence interval for 0 mg,
around a predicted mean of 0.0112, was (0.0094, 0.0134).  The 95 &#37; confidence
interval for 500 mg, around a predicted mean of 0.0383, was (0.0357, 0.0411).
In this study, the projected use level significantly increased the probability
of observing a rectal temperature greater than 103 &#176; F.  This increase
translated into 2.7 days of rectal temperature above 103.0 &#176; F per 100 cow
days during sometribove treatment.<P>
Because only two doses were represented in the IM/SC study (0 and 500 mg),
regression was not a valid method of analysis of the results of this study.
Instead, three way contingency tables (2 x 2 x 2) were constructed and various
categorical techniques applied.  Relative risk estimates, with 95 &#37; confidence
bounds, for observations of elevated temperature were calculated for IM dosing,
SC dosing and across both routes.  For IM doses, animals receiving 500 mg were
2.47 times more likely to be observed with elevated rectal temperatures than
the controls.  The confidence interval for relative risk was (2.04, 2.98). In
the SC dosed animals, those receiving 500 mg were 2.52 times more likely to be
observed with elevated rectal temperatures than the controls.  In this
instance, the 95 &#37; confidence interval on relative risk was (2.03, 3.12).  The
common estimate across dosing methods was 2.49, with 95 &#37; confidence bounds
(2.16, 2.87).<P>
Mean temperatures increased only slightly.  For instance, means of the four
dose levels in the first lactation of the TAS study ranged from 101.4 &#176; F
for controls to 101.9 &#176; F for the 3X group.  The standard deviation ranged
from 0.52 in the controls to 0.76 in the 5X group.  Due to lack of independence
in the daily measurements, however, these values should not be compared to one
another.<P>

<P>
Sometribove may increase body temperature.  This effect was not restricted
to the warmer months of the year.  However, the temperature-increasing effect
of sometribove is enhanced during periods of high environmental temperature.
Product labeling indicates that cows injected with sometribove may experience
periods of increased body temperature unrelated to illness.  To minimize this
effect, the appropriate measures should be taken during periods of high
environmental temperature to reduce heat stress.  Also, care should be taken to
differentiate increased body temperature due to use of sometribove from an
increased body temperature that may occur due to illness.<P>
<b> 4) Urinalysis </b><P>
Urinalysis was performed utilizing commercially available urinalysis test
strips with color sensitive areas which provided the following results:  pH,
bilirubin, blood, glucose, ketones, nitrate, protein, specific gravity, and
urobilinogen for the following studies.  Urine testing was performed during the
following studies: <P>
Multi-lactation Chronic Animal Toxicity Study (TAS)<br>
Multi-lactation IM Single Dose Study (Single Dose-IM <b>Dardenne location
only</b>)<br>
IM Dose Titration Study (Dose-IM) <br>
IM/SC Bridging Study<P>
Values for pH were presented as either 7, 7.5, 8 or 8.5;&#160;  bilirubin was
reported as negative or small +;&#160; protein was reported as negative, trace, +,
++, +++ or ++++;&#160;  specific gravity was reported as 1, 1.005, 1.01, 1.015, 1.02,
1.025, or 1.03;&#160;  ketone values were reported as negative, trace, small 15,
moderate 40, or large 80 or 160;&#160;  the presence of blood in urine was reported as
negative, trace, small +, moderate ++, or large +++;&#160;   results for nitrates,
urobilinogen and glucose were consistently negative.<P>
During the TAS study, urine samples were collected at days 40
(pretreatment) and 180 of each lactation, at lactation end, and after calving
at the beginning of the lactation following the second lactation of treatment.
During the Dose-IM and the Dardenne IM trial urine samples were collected at
day 40 (pretreatment), at day 180 of lactation, at lactation end and at the
beginning of the subsequent lactation.  During the IM/SC Bridging Study samples
were collected at 40 and 180 days of lactation, and at lactation end. <P>
For the Single Dose-IM Study, Dardenne location, ketone values for
multiparous cows for end of lactation urine samples, 32/49 control samples were
negative compared to 42/44 500 mg sometribove-treated cows. Ten control cows
had trace values, 4 had "small 15" values and 3 had "moderate 40" values.  Only
2 sometribove-treated multiparous cows had trace values for ketone and there
were no other positive values for sometribove-treated cows.  The significance
for this distribution of results was P=0.001.  In the IM/SC Bridging Study for
ketone results for primiparous cows at lactation end, there were 3/6 control
cows negative for urine ketones compared to 7/7 negative for IM dosed 500 mg
sometribove-treated cows (P=0.070).  However for SC sometribove-treated
primiparous cows, 5/7 were negative, not significantly different from controls
for this variable.<P>
For the Dose-IM, for ketone values of multiparous cows, for samples taken
during the early subsequent lactation following a full lactation of sometribove
(or excipient) treatment, 10/11 control cows had positive ketone values.  Four
of the 11 control cows had ketone values of "large."  However, for the 250,
500, and 750 mg dosed sometribove-treated cows, 6/11, 9/12, and 6/9,
respectively, were negative for ketones.  The statistical value for this
distribution indicated a high degree of significance at P=0.004.  These data
suggested that treatment of multiparous cows with sometribove resulted in
reduced detectable urine ketones in the early subsequent lactation.  <P>
These results suggest a likely decrease in detectable ketone bodies (not a
deleterious effect) in urine at the end of a lactation of sometribove treatment
and at the beginning of a subsequent lactation following a lactation of
sometribove treatment for multiparous cows. <P>
There were no other significant differences in urine results reported from
the trials. <p>
<b><A NAME="bst7">7.   Human Safety</A></b><P>
 <b>a.  Drugs for Use in Food Animals</b><P>
The FDA Guideline for Toxicological Testing recommends appropriate
toxicology tests for veterinary drugs in general and provides for the
development of alternate testing procedures for certain classes of compounds
such as, for example, biologically active proteins.  As discussed in detail by
Juskevich and Guyer ("Bovine growth hormone: human food safety evaluation,"
Science 249:875-884, 1990), the tests recommended are dependent on the
potential exposure of people to residues and the possible biological effects of
the protein in man.  A determination of the potential oral activity of the
protein in laboratory animals is the first step in the testing process.  This
determination involves the oral administration of exaggerated dosages daily for
an appropriate time period.  If the compound is determined to be orally active,
more testing may be required.  In the case of sometribove, there is convincing
medical evidence that non-human somatotropins, like bovine somatotropin, are
not biologically active in man (Recent Prog Horm Res. 15:71-114, 1959).
<P>
FDA has also required that the potential oral activity of the protein
insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) be assessed since this is the hormone that
changes most dramatically in the blood following bovine somatotropin treatment
and there was a general lack of available information on this hormone.  IGF-I
is a 70 amino acid protein whose amino acid sequence is identical in cows and
humans (unlike bovine and human somatotropin).  IGF-I is produced in various
body tissues and its production is at least partially regulated by
somatotropin.  There is considerable evidence that IGF-I mediates some of the
biologic effects of somatotropin.  When bovine somatotropin is administered to
dairy cows, the production of IGF-I in the cow is increased (J. Dairy Sci.
71:288, 1988). <P>
To assess the safety implications of potential changes in IGF-I levels in
milk, FDA required several studies to be conducted, including a study to assess
the potential oral activity of IGF-I.  When consumed orally, proteins are
normally digested and destroyed in the digestive tract. Other studies were
required to assess the effects of sometribove administration on the levels of
IGF-I in cows' milk.  To do this, it was first necessary to establish the
normal range of IGF-I concentrations found in cows' milk.  <P>
<b> b.  Four Week Gavage Study in Rats with Sometribove Zinc</b><P>
The study was carried out at Hazleton Laboratories America, Inc., Vienna,
Virginia.  Sometribove (zinc salt) was administered by daily oral gavage to
groups of 20 male and 20 female Sprague Dawley rats per treatment level for 28
consecutive days.  The control group was administered the dosing vehicle and
the three treatment groups were given 60, 600, or 6000 micrograms of
sometribove zinc per kilogram body weight each day. Animals were observed daily
and a number of parameters were examined including body weight and food
consumption, hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, postmortem examination,
organ weights, and histopathology. <P>
No adverse effects were observed in test animals.  Body weights, food
consumption, clinical parameters, organ weights, gross and microscopic
pathology were unaffected at all dosage levels.  Therefore, the highest dosage
tested, 6000 micrograms/kg body weight, was considered a "no-observed effect
level" in the study.<P>
<b> c.  Two Week Gavage Study in Rats with Insulin-Like Growth Factor-I
(IGF-I)</b><P>
The study was conducted at Hazleton Laboratories America, Inc. Rockville,
Maryland.  Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) was administered by daily oral
gavage to groups of 20 male and 20 female rats for 16 consecutive days.  The
negative control group was administered the dosing vehicle by gavage and the
other 3 oral gavage treatment groups were given 20, 200, or 2000 micrograms of
IGF-I per kilogram body weight each day.  The positive control groups were
administered either IGF-I (50 or 200 micrograms/day) or 4000 micrograms/day
alanyl porcine somatotropin (APS) via implanted osmotic pumps for 14
consecutive days.  APS was used as the positive control because the release
characteristics of this somatotropin from osmotic pumps and the subsequent
increase in blood IGF-I were well-defined.  Due to the large number of animals
to be implanted with osmotic pumps, study initiation was staggered over two
consecutive days so that one-half of the animals in each group were started
each day.  Animals were observed daily and a number of parameters were examined
including body weight, food consumption, hematology, blood clinical chemistry,
blood IGF-I levels, urinalysis, post-mortem examination, organ weights,
histologic examination of the gastrointestinal tract, tibia length, and tibial
epiphyseal width.<P>
No adverse effects were observed in the study.  Body weights and food
consumption were not affected by gavage administration of IGF-I in male and
female rats in the low and mid dose groups.  Half of the high dose males
started on one day exhibited a small but statistically significant increase in
body weight gain.  This finding was considered incidental and not related to
treatment as it did not occur in the other group of high dose male rats started
the following day nor in the high dose female rats.  There were no dose related
changes in organ weights, blood IGF-I levels or other measured clinical
parameters in male or female gavage dosed rats, unlike rats given IGF-I
systemically via osmotic pumps.  The gastrointestinal tract of gavage treated
rats was normal based on microscopic examination.  Rats administered IGF-I
systemically (pump), particularly at the higher dose, exhibited increased body
weight gain, changes in clinical parameters and various organ weights, elevated
blood IGF-I and increased tibial epiphyseal width.  Rats given APS systemically
exhibited the largest increases in body weight gain, greater changes in
clinical parameters and organ weights, elevated blood IGF-I and increased
tibial length and width.  The highest oral gavage dosage of 2000 micrograms/kg
body weight was considered a "no-observed effect level" since no significant
toxicity was observed in rats at this level of exposure.<P>
<b> d.  Survey of Insulin-like Growth Factor-I (IGF-I) Concentrations in
Individual Milk Samples from Five Missouri Dairy Herds</b><P>
The analytical phase of the study was conducted at the Monsanto
Agricultural Company research facility at Chesterfield, Missouri. Lactating
Holstein dairy cows (172 primiparous, 237 multiparous) from five separate farms
in Missouri were used in the study.  These animals had never been administered
exogenous bovine somatotropin products. Individual milk samples were collected
from each cow for measurement of endogenous levels of IGF-I using a validated
assay.  <P>
The overall mean concentration of milk IGF-I for the 5 farms was 2.54
ng/ml.  Mean concentration at each farm ranged from 0.29 to 4.21 ng/ml while
individual cow values ranged from 0 to 30 ng/ml.  Milk IGF-I concentrations
were slightly higher in multiparous than primiparous cows and much higher
during early lactation (6.2 ng/ml) than later lactation (1.9 ng/ml).  Stage of
lactation and farm location had the greatest effect on endogenous milk IGF-I
concentrations.<P>
<b> e.  Survey of Insulin-Like Growth Factor-I (IGF-I) Concentrations in
Commercial Bulk Tank Milk Samples</b><P>
The analytical phase of this study was conducted at the Monsanto
Agricultural Research facility at Chesterfield, Missouri.  In this study, milk
samples from 100 bulk tanks were collected at a local commercial milk
processing plant in Missouri.  Bulk tank samples were obtained from commercial
dairy farms that had not used exogenous bovine somatotropin products.
Endogenous levels of IGF-I were measured in individual bulk tank milk samples
using a validated assay.  The mean concentration of IGF-I for all bulk tank
samples was 4.3 ng/ml with concentrations for individual bulk tank samples
ranging from 1.3 to 8.1 ng/ml. <P>
<b> f.  Comparison of Milk Concentrations of Insulin-Like Growth Factor-I
(IGF-I) Following Subcutaneous Injections of Sometribove </b><P>
This study was conducted at the Monsanto Animal Research Center, O'Fallon,
Missouri.  Nine lactating Holstein dairy cows were administered 500 mg of
sometribove by subcutaneous injection every two weeks. Treated cows were
injected on study days 0, 14 and 28.  Nine control cows were sham injected at
the same study intervals. Milk levels of IGF-I were measured pre-test and in
the middle (day 7) of each injection cycle using a validated assay.<P>
Mean pre-treatment milk IGF-I concentrations were 5.05 ng/ml for controls
and 3.94 ng/ml for treated cows.  During the study, milk IGF-I concentrations
ranged from 3.16 to 3.35 ng/ml for control cows and from 3.49 to 5.31 ng/ml for
treated cows.  The difference in milk IGF-I between control and treated cows
was statistically significant at the 5 &#37; probability level.  However, the levels
of IGF-I in milk from both control and treated cows are 100 to 1000-times lower
than endogenous blood levels in humans.  Thus, even if ingested IGF-I was not
destroyed in the digestive tract and was absorbed intact, the dilution of a few
nanograms of undigested IGF-I into the large endogenous plasma pool in humans
would be physiologically insignificant.  Therefore, milk IGF-I levels are safe
for all consumers, including young infants.<P>
<b> g.  Conclusions on Human Safety</b><P>
The lack of oral activity of sometribove and IGF-I and the nontoxic nature
of the residues of these compounds, even at exaggerated doses, demonstrates
that sometribove and IGF-I present no human safety concern when consumed
orally.  Therefore, there is no need to establish a safe concentration of total
residue or a residue method in meat or milk. Also, there is no need to
establish a tolerance or withdrawal time for human consumption of meat or milk
from dairy cows administered sometribove.<P>
<b><A NAME="bst8">8.   Agency Conclusions</A></b><P>
This new animal drug application satisfies the requirements of Section 512
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and demonstrates that
Posilac&#174; (sterile sometribove zinc suspension), when used under its proposed
conditions of use, is safe and effective for its labeled indication.  <P>
Since neither meat nor milk from animals treated with sometribove presents
any increased risks if consumed by people, it is not necessary to establish a
safe concentration of total residue or to have a regulatory assay method or
confirmatory assay method for milk or tissue residues.  It is therefore
unnecessary to establish a tolerance or withdrawal time for human consumption
of meat or milk from dairy cows administered this drug product. <P>
Sterile sometribove zinc suspension is not eligible for generic copying
under section 512(b)(2) of the Act because it is a recombinant DNA-derived
(i.e., biotechnology-derived) drug; section 106 of the Generic Animal Drug and
Patent Term Restoration Act (GADPTRA) of 1988 provides that FDA may not approve
an abbreviated application submitted under Section 512(b)(2) for a new animal
drug which is primarily manufactured using, inter alia, recombinant
DNA.<P>
The Center for Veterinary Medicine has concluded that, for this drug
product, adequate directions for use by the layman have been provided. Label
directions are accompanied by pictorial diagrams and detailed instructions in
plain language.  Historically, the industry is familiar with subcutaneous
injections.  The syringe is a pre-loaded single-dose syringe, and this adds to
the simplicity of use.  The use of the product should be preceded by a
comprehensive and ongoing herd management, mastitis control, and reproductive
program, as recommended in product labeling.  The drug is not a controlled
substance.  Thus, labeling is adequate for the intended use.  <P>

 <b>k.  Cow Health </b><P>
An analysis of health observations from cows treated with sometribove was
conducted using data from the following studies:<P>
Multi-lactation Chronic Animal Toxicity Study (TAS) <br>
Multi-location SC Dose Response Clinical Study (4 Dose-SC) <br>
Multi-location IM Single Dose Study (Single Dose-IM) <br>
IM Dose Titration Study (Dose-IM)<br>
IM/SC Bridging Study (IM/SC) <P>
The experimental design of each of these studies is described in Sections
6.b, 5.a, 6.e, 6.d, 6.c, respectively.  Data were gathered from daily
observations, log entries, calving reports, medication files, physical
examinations, veterinary requests, animal release records, necropsy reports,
and feed sheet records.  Data were grouped by system, subsystem within system,
and category within subsystem and then were analyzed at each of these levels.
A listing of the system and subsystem groupings used is contained in Table 73.
The categories within each subsystem are listed in the results tables described
later. <p>

Health observations were summarized and analyzed in five different periods:<P>
Pretreatment period  -  from calving to the day before start of
treatment;<P>
Standardized treatment period  -  from start of treatment up through 18
cycles (16 cycles for TAS) which usually was equivalent to the period used in
production analysis;<P>
Entire treatment period -  from start of treatment through day of last
milking if cow was pregnant, 14 days after last injection date while still
milking if cow was not pregnant, or a cow's removal date from study if it
preceded either the last milk or treatment dates;<P>
Dry period  -  from day after last milking until day before next calving or
a cow's removal date from study if it preceded the next calving; <P>
Lactation subsequent to treatment  -  from calving through 56 days, a cow's
last milk if it preceded 56 days or a cow's removal date from study if it
preceded either the last milk or 56 days.<P>
Data were analyzed both within each of the individual studies listed above
and as a pooled analysis of all of the studies excluding the TAS study.
Separate analyses were performed for primiparous and multiparous cows.  Table
74 lists the total number of cows and cow days when health incidents could be

<b>1</b> Sometribove dose (mg/14 days) 
<hr></pre>
For all conditions, the number of cows affected and the total days observed
were analyzed.  The TAS study analysis included two additional variables.  The
first was the total number of cases.  For a given condition, a new case was
defined when consecutive incidents were separated by at least seven days.
Cases which extended between study periods (i.e., between the pretreatment and
the treatment periods) were counted in the period in which they began.  The
second variable, total duration of cases, was defined as the sum of the case
lengths within a given condition.<P>
Poisson regression was performed on total days observed, total cases
observed, and total duration of cases, each with an appropriately calculated
denominator, reflecting days at risk.  When an analysis involved more than two
doses, a residual chi square P-value was calculated.  Analysis of the number of
cows affected varied depending on the number of doses and the number of trials
included in the analysis.  The Cochran-Armitage trend test was used in the
individual TAS and Dose-IM studies.  Additionally, a residual chi square
P-value was reported for these studies.  The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel nonzero
correlation test was used for combined data across several locations. This
included the individual Single Dose-IM and 4 Dose-SC study analyses as well as
the pooled analyses. <P>
Analysis of data from physical examinations was performed separately.
Number of cows affected was the only variable analyzed because examinations
were not conducted on a daily basis.  Data were analyzed for each period of
study that examinations were scheduled.  Statistical methods identical to those
previously discussed were used for the number of cows affected.<P>
<b>Results</b><P>
There were no adverse effects of sometribove administration on the
circulatory/lymphatic system or the integumentary system, nor did sometribove
cause increased metabolic disorders or eye disorders/conjunctivitis.  <P>
Sometribove-treated cows had a greater incidence of disorders of the
digestive system than controls.  Within this system, various subsystems and
categories were affected, for example, bloat and diarrhea (Tables 75 and
76).<P>

In the musculoskeletal system, sometribove-treated cows had more disorders
of the hock (Table 77), which were primarily manifested as swellings or
enlargements.  This effects was also suggested in the physical examination data
(not shown).  Sometribove-treated multiparous cows tended to have more
disorders of the hoof and foot region (e.g., bruises, infections, swellings) in
the daily observation database (Table 78), but not in the physical examination
database (no observations).  Similarly, there was a trend for increased
lameness in treated cows in the daily observation database (Table 79), but not
in the physical examination data.  The physical examination data indicated that
treated cows had more lesions such as lacerations, enlargements, and calluses
of the knee (carpal region) (Table 80).  Because of the inconsistencies in
these data, the lameness clinical field study, described in Section 6.f, was
conducted to more thoroughly evaluate the effects of sometribove on the
musculoskeletal system.<P>

For the respiratory system, there appeared to be an increase in the
incidence of congestion and abnormal breathing in multiparous cows. However,
the majority of these incidents occurred at the Dardenne Single Dose-IM trial.
Because this disorder primarily occurred at one trial and was significant for
only multiparous cows, FDA concluded that it was not a real effect of the
drug.<P>
Treated multiparous cows had an increased duration of udder dermatitis, but
this was attributed to a small number of cows with long cases at the Cornell
Single Dose-IM and SQ-Dose trials.  Multiparous cows treated with sometribove
had a greater incidence of udder swellings or edema than controls.  However,
these incidents were primarily associated with mastitis, dermatitis, and
similar disorders.<P>
Under the miscellaneous category, there was an increase in incidence of
elevated body temperature in sometribove-treated cows.  This observation is
more fully discussed in Section 6.m.3.  There was an increase in the number of
observations of "off-feed" (feed refusal) and total days medicated for
sometribove-treated cows (Tables 82 and 83). <P>

During the dry period and in the first sixty days of the next lactation
there were no effects on cows previously administered sometribove with the
exception that the incidence of metabolic disorders, primarily milk fever, was
reduced in multiparous cows (Table 84).  A trend toward increased numbers of
cows with retained placenta was evident in the pooled analysis (Table 85).  The
data from the five individual trials contributing to this data set (i.e., the
Single Dose-IM Study trials and the IM Dose-Determination Study) were analyzed
using a stratified analysis based on the Mantel-Haenszel Test.  Analyses were
conducted comparing controls and the 500 mg sometribove-treated cows with
parities separated and with parities pooled, using a one-tailed test. The
probability of the observed increase being due to chance, if there was no
difference between the treatments, was .0209 for the analysis where the
parities were kept separate and .0256 where parities were pooled.  Thus, FDA
concluded that the increase in the incidence of retained placenta in the
subsequent post-calving period was a repeatable effect.<P>

<b>Conclusions</b><P>
Sometribove use is associated with increased frequency of use of medication
in cows.  Use of sometribove may result in an increase in digestive disorders
such as indigestion, bloat, and diarrhea.  Treated cows may have more disorders
of the uterus, and there may be an increase in the number of cows experiencing
periods of "off-feed" (reduced feed intake) during treatment with sometribove.
Also, the incidence of retained placenta may be higher following subsequent
calving.  These effects are provided on the product labeling.<P>
 <b><A NAME="bst6l">l.  Calf Birth Traits, Growth, and Health </A> </b><P>
Analysis of health data from calves born to cows treated with sometribove
was conducted.  Cows received sometribove for approximately the first 7 months
of the 9-month gestation.  The following studies were included in the
analysis:<P>
Multi-lactation Chronic Animal Toxicity Study (TAS)<br>
Multi-location SC Dose Response Clinical Study (4 Dose-SC)<br>
Multi-location IM Single Dose Study (Single Dose-IM)<br>
IM Dose Titration Study (Dose-IM)<P>
The experimental design of each of these studies is described in Sections
6.b, 5.a, 6.e, and 6.d, respectively.  A pooled analysis was conducted using
studies that contained the control and 500 mg dosage groups.  The calves from
the TAS study were evaluated separately because of the higher doses
administered to study cows.<P>
The methods of gathering and analyzing health observations for calves were
similar to those described for cows (Section 6.k).  Birth traits measured were
calving difficulty, gestation length, sex ratio, birth weight, height (TAS
only), and girth (TAS only).  Health data were analyzed separately by
categories which are listed in Table 86.  In addition, certain health
observations were considered to be birth abnormalities (italicized in Table
86).  Physical examinations were generally performed on calves within 72 hours
of birth.  Calves were observed for variable periods of time after birth
depending upon the study.  In the TAS study, all calves were observed for five
weeks.  In the 4 Dose-SC study, male calves were observed for one week and
female calves for four weeks.  In the Single Dose-IM study, all calves were
observed for nine weeks.  In the Dose-IM study, female calves (only) were
observed for four weeks.  <P>
For purposes of the birth trait analyses all available data for calves were
utilized.  These included birth data from calves that were born alive or
stillborn and calves from breedings that occurred beyond the breeding cut-off
dates for each study.  Data for the growth analyses included only the calves
that completed the observation period as specified for each study.  However, in
the health and birth abnormality analyses, all calves observed for any part of
the observation period were included. <P>
<b>Calf Performance in the Multi-lactation Chronic Toxicity Study
(TAS)</b><P>
There was no effect of sometribove on the birth traits with the exception
of a trend for average calf birth weight, height, and girth to be reduced for
the calves for both years from the multiparous cows treated at the two highest
levels of sometribove compared to calves from control multiparous cows.<P>
Average daily gains and feed intake were unaffected by the cow's previous
treatment (Table 87).  Gains were as expected for calves in this age group and
breed.  Similarly, hematology and blood chemistry variables were unaffected by
sometribove treatment of the cow. <p>

Total days affected with high body temperature and pneumonia could not be
evaluated due to inaccuracies in the recording of the duration of these
clinical signs and, therefore, the overall category of days with clinical signs
also could not be evaluated.  Numbers of calves affected by these variables,
however, were accurately captured and, thus, the overall category of numbers of
calves with clinical signs was evaluated.  In general, days that calves were
medicated were accurately recorded.  Therefore, total days medicated was a more
appropriate indicator of sometribove's effect on overall health of offspring
than days of clinical signs.<P>
In the TAS study, total days medicated for female and male calves over the
29-day period for offspring of treated primiparous cows was increased in year
one of the study.  There was an increase in total days medicated for female
calves of sometribove-treated multiparous cows for the 29-day observation
period in year one of treatment and for males and females in year two of the
TAS study.  However, since the number of calves in the TAS study was small,
this effect was better evaluated in the pooled analyses of the clinical trials,
which had greater numbers of animals.  <P>
In the TAS study there were no significant results noted from the physical
examinations for any of the parameters analyzed for either parity group.
<P>
Heifer calves from the first lactation were monitored from birth through
reproductive maturity and breeding (approximately 16 months of age or until
confirmed pregnant at day 60 of gestation or later). Administration of
sometribove to pregnant cows did not affect health and performance of resulting
female offspring, except that wither height was lower for heifers from 14 to 16
months of age for heifers born to cows dosed with 600 and 1800 mg sometribove.
Growth rates through 16 months of age averaged approximately .84 kg/day and
were unaffected by sometribove.  Size and growth of all animals fell within the
range of growth standards reported for Holstein heifers. Conception rates were
control: 8/8, 600 mg: 2/3, 1800 mg: 3/3, and 3000 mg: 3/3.  <P>
Bull calves born to treated cows were not monitored through reproductive
maturity in this study; therefore, no conclusions were made regarding the
effect of the cow's dose of sometribove on the reproductive performance of bull
calves.  Thus, the product labeling states that safety to replacement bulls
from dairy cows injected with sometribove has not been established.  <P>
<b>Calf Performance in the Pooled Analyses</b><P>
Effect of sometribove on birth traits in the pooled analysis (4 Dose-SC,
Single Dose-IM, and Dose-IM Studies) for the 0 and 500 mg dose groups are
presented in Table 88.  Calving difficulty and sex ratio of calves were
unaffected by administration of sometribove to their dams during gestation.
Gestation length was reduced in those cows receiving sometribove versus the
controls.  This reduction was approximately 2.6 days for primiparous cows and
3.1 days for multiparous cows.  Birth weight of calves from cows administered
sometribove was reduced by approximately 1.5 kilograms in both parity groups.
This effect was independent of rate of twinning. <P>
Growth rate and average daily gain were measured for the offspring. The
growth data could not be pooled across studies since length of observation and
sex of calves monitored varied by study location.  The evaluation of calf
growth utilized all available data for each study. Cow's treatment with
sometribove did not affect growth of calves born subsequent to the lactation of
treatment.  These data were highly variable since body weights taken within the
first weeks of life can vary markedly.<P>

There was a decrease in total days medicated for female calves of
sometribove-treated primiparous cows for the 29-day observation period. There
was an increase in total days medicated for male calves from treated
primiparous cows over the 9-day observation period, but a decrease in total
days medicated for male calves from treated multiparous cows compared to values
from calves of control cows.  These differences in response indicated that
there was no clear effect of sometribove treatment of the cow on days of
medication for the calves.<P>
A decrease in diarrhea was noted for calves from primiparous cows over the
29 day observation period.  There was an increase in abnormal lung sounds for
female calves from primiparous cows treated with sometribove; however, this was
the result of only two observations in the 750 mg group and no observations in
the other dose groups.  Also, there were no similar trends in female calves of
multiparous cows or in male calves of either parity group.  There were
additional statistically significant effects (both increases and decreases) due
to sometribove treatment of cow on some additional clinical signs.  However,
these effects were not consistent across male and female calves and/or parity
group of the cow, and FDA therefore did not consider these to be of biological
importance.<P>
<b>Calf Abnormalities</b><P>
Birth abnormalities which were observed from the pooled data are listed in
Table 86.  When all calves of control vs. 500 mg primiparous cows from the IM
and SC trials were pooled there were increased overall birth abnormalities in
female (12 vs. 6 for controls) and male (15 vs. 9) calves of 500 mg sometribove
dosed primiparous cows, due primarily to increased hernias (2 treated vs. 0 for
controls for females, and 5 treated vs. 2 controls for males) within the
"Alimentary" category.<P>
When selected important birth abnormalities considered to represent those
which may affect animal health and survival (italicized in Table 86) were
analyzed comparing calves of controls and 500 mg sometribove-treated cows,
there was no increase in overall incidence of selected abnormalities.  When all
of the calves examined from 500 mg primiparous cows were considered (N=32 for
female controls, N=42 for male controls, N=26 for female 500 mg calves, N=41
for male 500 mg calves), there was a slight increase in umbilical hernias for
female (P=0.099) and for male (P=0.079) calves of treated primiparous cows.
There was a numerical reduction for hernias in male calves of
sometribove-treated multiparous cows (5 controls vs. 3 treatment group calves).
When sex and parity were stratified and all control vs. 500 mg calves were
compared, there was weak significance (P=0.093) for increased hernias (13
control vs. 21 treatment group calves).  However, most of the hernias reported
were of minimal size (the minimum being 2 cm).  None of the hernias was serious
enough to require surgery and, due to their small size, they were expected to
resolve spontaneously.  FDA concluded that a slight predisposition for calves
of treated primiparous cows to have small hernias would be of no biological
consequence.<P>
There was an increase in contracted tendons for calves of treated
primiparous cows (one male and one female calf compared to no control calves
affected).  There was no increase in calves of multiparous cows nor for
combined parity and sex.  Due to the small numbers of calves involved and the
inconsistency of effect, this result was considered to be due to
chance.<P>
<b>Conclusions</b><P>
FDA concluded that cows administered sometribove may have small decreases
in gestation length and birth weight of calves, and they may have increased
twinning rates.  This information is provided on product labeling.  Sometribove
treatment of the cow during gestation had no adverse effects on the health of
resulting offspring.<P><A HREF="http://www.cvm.fda.gov/fda/infores/foi/bst/bst7.html">next section</A> ||

<b>i.   Reproduction </b><P>
Reproductive performance was evaluated in the following studies
individually and from a pooled analysis:<P>
    Multi-lactation Chronic Animal Toxicity Study (TAS)<br>
    Multi-location SC Dose Response Clinical Study (4 Dose-SC)<br>
    Multi-location IM Single Dose Study (Single Dose-IM)<br>
    IM Dose Titration Study (Dose-IM)<br>
IM/SC Bridging Study (IM/SC)<P>
The experimental design and methods for each of these studies are described
in Sections 6.b, 5.a, 6.e, 6.d, and 6.c, respectively. Location-specific
practices were followed for vaccination programs, sire selection, management of
reproductive problems, and calving management.  All cows received a veterinary
examination to evaluate reproductive health prior to initiation of the breeding
program.  All breeding was by artificial insemination.  Estrus detection was by
visual appraisal of standing estrus according to the following system:
1 = standing heat; 2 = bulling, sniffing, and attempting to
mount other cows; 3 = bawling and restlessness; 4 = clear
vaginal discharge, vulva lips swollen and/or flabby; 5 = metestrus
bleeding; 6 = other, when 1-5 did not apply, explained in an
observation column.  Some locations may also have used heat detection aids such
as heat mount detectors or tailhead chalking.  Use of prostaglandins and
gonadotropins to induce fertile estrus was not restricted in the IM studies and
normal location practices were allowed.  In the 4 Dose-SC study, use of any
medication to alter the normal cycle was not allowed until after 120 days in
milk. No restriction, however, was placed on the use of these products to treat
a diagnosed ailment such as cystic ovarian disease or pyometra. Data were
analyzed using all available information and again, separately, excluding those
cows that received any medication intended to alter the estrous cycle.  Since
the trends regarding the effects of sometribove treatment on reproduction were
the same in either case, only the overall analysis is discussed.<P>
All locations participated in a routine herd health program.  Pregnancy
status was determined by rectal palpation by the herd veterinarian or other
qualified person at regular intervals.  This information was used to determine
the conception date and to identify any loss of a previously diagnosed
pregnancy.  At parturition, a calving ease score was assigned, with increasing
calving difficulty indicated by increasing score.  Calving ease scores were as
follows: 1&nbsp;=&nbsp;an unassisted delivery in which progressive fetal
expulsion continued throughout and labor did not exceed 3 or 5 hours for
multiparous or primiparous cows, respectively; 2&nbsp;=&nbsp;a multiparous or
primiparous cow delivered a calf after prolonged or difficult unassisted labor
of &gt;3 or &gt;5 hours, respectively; 3&nbsp;=&nbsp;manual assistance
(traction only) was required; 4&nbsp;=&nbsp;delivery was assisted due to
improper calf positioning for parturition; 5&nbsp;=&nbsp;calving occurred
unobserved.  Scores were grouped into high (scores 2, 3, and 4) versus low
(score 1) calving difficulty for analysis.  All calves were weighed at
birth.<P>
Data from each of the five studies were analyzed separately by parity. Data
were then pooled where appropriate, i.e., where similar sometribove doses and
similar reproductive management techniques were used, and analyzed by parity to
allow the most complete evaluation of the effects of sometribove on
reproduction.  In all IM studies (including the IM/SC Bridging Study), attempts
to breed cows began at approximately 40 days after calving.  Because of this,
approximately 40 &#37; of all cows on these studies received at least one
insemination prior to the first sometribove administration.  In the 4 Dose-SC
study, all inseminations occurred after the first administration of
sometribove.  For this reason, pooling across the IM and SC studies was not
possible.  Thus, the data from clinical studies using the IM route of
administration were pooled for the control and 500 mg doses (including only the
IM injected cows from the IM/SC study) and analyzed as the "Pooled IM" studies,
and the 4 Dose-SC study was analyzed separately.  Finally, the TAS Study was
evaluated separately from the other studies because of the higher doses used.
<P>
Reproductive variables were analyzed over several separate study periods.
In the Pooled IM studies, where breeding was initiated prior to sometribove
treatment, reproductive performance was evaluated in the pretreatment period to
determine, among other things, whether breedings occurring within a few weeks
of initiating sometribove treatment resulted in greater failure in conception
rates.  Reproductive performance in the Pooled IM studies was also evaluated
from the initiation of sometribove treatment (i.e., approximately 60 days
postpartum) until the breeding cut-off (i.e., days postpartum in which attempts
to breed a cow ceased), which was set at 170 days in these studies.  Finally,
reproductive performance over the entire breeding period (pretreatment through
170 days postpartum) was evaluated.  In the 4 Dose-SC study, breeding initiated
after the start of sometribove treatment and continued until at least 305 days
postpartum.  Evaluation of reproductive performance in this study covered the
periods from 60 to 180 days postpartum, and from 60-305 days postpartum.  (For
example, for the 60-180 day evaluation, if a cow conceived at 250 days
postpartum, she was nevertheless classified as "open" in the analysis.)
Finally, in both the Pooled IM and 4 Dose-SC analyses, reproductive performance
across dose groups was evaluated during the first 28 days of sometribove
treatment to determine whether negative effects, if any, were predominantly
associated with the earliest period of treatment when treated cows usually had
a reduction in energy balance compared to controls.  It should be noted that
individual cows were only included in the periods of analysis for variables in
which they were "eligible."  For example, in the Pooled IM studies, a cow
conceiving to a full-term pregnancy prior to the initiation of sometribove
treatment was excluded from the day 60 to 170 analyses for selected variables
because she was already pregnant.  However, if she lost the fetus prior to 170
days postpartum, she would have been included in the day 60 to 170 analyses for
these variables because she was once again eligible for breeding. <P>
A glossary of terms is included at the end of this Section (Table 65) and
reflects most of the variables analyzed.  Results of the analyses during the
pretreatment period did not indicate that initiation of sometribove treatment
shortly after breeding adversely affected conception or other reproduction
indices.  Effects during the first 28 days of treatment were not substantially
different from those observed during the remainder of the breeding period.
<P>
The results of reproductive performance in the TAS study from days 60-140
postpartum in Year 1 and days 60-275 postpartum in Year 2, in the Pooled IM
studies from day 60 to 170 postpartum, and the 4&nbsp;Dose-SC study from days
60-180 postpartum in general were found to reflect the effects of sometribove
treatment during the entire breeding period. Based on these data, both
primiparous and multiparous cows experienced a reduction in pregnancy rates
(see Table 61) and variables related to pregnancy rate (e.g., conception rate
and successful calving rate). Primiparous cows had an increase in days open
(see Table 62). Administration of sometribove was also associated with an
increased rate of twinning and an increase in the incidence of cystic ovaries
(Tables 63 and 64).  Other parameters of reproductive performance, such as days
to first estrus and insemination, interestrous interval, services per
conception and incidence of fetal loss were not consistently affected by the
administration of sometribove.<P>
<b>Conclusions</b><P>
The product labeling states that treatment of cows with sometribove may
result in reduced pregnancy rates and an increase in days open for primiparous
cows.  Also, the incidence of cystic ovaries and multiple births may increase.
The labeling recommends the implementation of a comprehensive and ongoing herd
reproductive health program preceding use of sometribove. <P>

Number of Cows        Total number of cows available for analysis.            

Estrous Period        Period of time the cow is receptive to breeding         
                      activity.  Generally defined by immobility during       
                      mounting attempts of other cows.  Activity is scored    
                      (see below) and all scores within a 4 day period are    
                      considered to be a single estrous period.  The first    
                      date of the 4 day period is used as the date of         
                      estrus which is used to calculate interestrous          
                      interval.  The last date of the 4 day period is used    
                      to assign estrous period to a particular study period.  

Total Estrous         Total number of estrous periods during a given time.    
Periods               This excludes estrous periods after conception in       
                      full term pregnancies and after conception and up to    
                      fetal loss in cows that later lost a pregnancy.         

Average Number of     The average number of estrous periods during a given    
Estrous Periods       time.  Same exclusions as for Total Estrous Periods.    

Interestrous          Average number of days between all estrous periods.     
Interval              Same exclusions as for Total Estrous Periods.           

First Interestrous    Average number of days between the first estrous        
Interval              period and the second estrous period.  Same             
                      exclusions as for Total Estrous Periods.                

Second Interestrous   Average number of days between the second estrous       
Interval              period and the third estrous period.  Same exclusions   
                      as for Total Estrous Periods.                           

Expected Estrous      Calculated by using the open days divided by 21.        
Periods                                                                       

Days to First Estrus  Average number of days to first observation of          
                      estrus.  Definitions for estrous scores follow:  
                      1 =  Standing estrus. 
                      2 =  Bulling, sniffing and attempting to mount other cows.  
                      3 =  Bawling and restlessness.  
                      4 =  Clear vaginal discharge, vulva      
                           lips swollen and/or flabby.  
                      5 =  Metestrus bleeding.   
                      6 =  Other; when 1-5 does not apply, explain in

 <b><A NAME="bst6j">j.  Mastitis</A> </b><P>
The effect of sometribove treatment on clinical mastitis, subclinical
mastitis and somatic cell count (SCC) was evaluated from the following studies
in separate and pooled analyses:<P>
Multi-lactation Chronic Animal Toxicity Study (TAS)<br>
Multi-location SC Dose Response Clinical Study (4 Dose-SC)<br>
Multi-location IM Single Dose Study (Single Dose-IM)<br>
IM Dose Titration Study (Dose-IM)<br>
IM/SC Bridging Study (IM/SC)<P>
The experimental design and sample collection schedule for each of these
studies has been described (Sections 6.b, 5.a, 6.e, 6.d, 6.c, respectively).
<P>
Since the individual effectiveness trials lacked sufficient numbers of
animals to examine any association between use of sometribove and effect on
mastitis and milk somatic cell count, data from studies were pooled in order to
augment animal numbers and increase the reliability of conclusions.  As
discussed in Sections 5.a and 6.e, data collected at one location (Utah) from
the 4 Dose-SC study and the same location in the Single Dose-IM study were
excluded from the clinical and subclinical mastitis analysis.  Clinical
mastitis was rarely treated during these trials, possibly affecting the
incidence of mastitis and confounding any effects due to sometribove. <P>
For clinical mastitis, data from the 4 Dose-SC, Single Dose-IM, Dose-IM and
IM/SC studies (i.e., 8 trials) were pooled for analysis.  The TAS study was
excluded from the pooled analysis because of the higher doses used.  A separate
analysis of this study was carried out.  For subclinical mastitis, data from
the 4 Dose-SC study were pooled with the IM/SC study and the Dose-IM study.
Finally, for somatic cell counts, several analyses were carried out on data
from individual studies and on pooled data.<P>
<b>Detection of clinical mastitis</b>.<P>  In all studies, milkers were
responsible for the detection of abnormal milk by the examination of foremilk
from each quarter at each milking.  There was some variation from location to
location in routine practices and therapy related to mastitis.  However, within
a given location, control and sometribove-treated cows were assessed and
administered therapy for mastitis by identical procedures.<P>
<b>Detection of subclinical mastitis</b>.<P>  Milk samples were obtained for
determination of subclinical mastitis by microbiological culture once before
initiation of treatment with sometribove and at approximately 8 week intervals
during the treatment period.<P>
<b>Determination of SCC</b>.<P>  Milk samples for determination of SCC were
taken once per week throughout the study for all of the studies.  All
determinations were done by independent laboratories.<P>
<b>Definitions</b>.<P>  Case Rate was the number of clinical mastitis cases
per quarter per cow-day when a new case could be observed.  Twenty-one (21)
days must have elapsed between observations within a quarter or a new pathogen
isolated for separate cases to be identified.<P>
Days Affected Rate was the number of days affected per cow-day observed.
Cases in more than one quarter on a given day were consolidated in this
variable.  Essentially, a yes/no response was created for each animal each
day.<P>
<b>Results</b>:<P>
<b>Clinical Mastitis</b><P>
In the pooled analysis (excluding the TAS study), there was a total of
202911 quarter days when new cases could have been observed for 193 primiparous
cows and 408468 quarter days when new cases could have been observed in 426
multiparous cows.  Because of overlap, days observed were slightly smaller than
one quarter of these values; primiparous cows were observed on 51069 days and
multiparous cows on 103125 days.<P>
Cochran-Mantel Haenszel (CMH) measures of general association were used to
test for association, controlling various effects.  Analyses were done (1)
separately by parity, (2) controlling for parity, and (3) ignoring (collapsing)
parity.  There was an association between sometribove usage and the number of
cows affected with clinical mastitis.  Comparing the proposed use level (500
mg) to control, the relative risk of a treated animal showing signs of clinical
mastitis during the treatment period was about 1.79 times that of a control
animal (Table 66).<P>

Poisson-based regression was used to estimate the probability of observing
a new case on a quarter-day when a new case could be observed.  Case Rate per
cow-day could then be obtained by assuming independence of the quarters.  The
probability was then the sum of the probabilities in each of the four quarters
in the udder, or four times the probability in any one quarter.  Poisson-based
regression was also used to estimate the probability that a cow would be
affected with clinical mastitis on any given day.  The regression coefficients
were used to calculate predicted Case Rates and Days Affected Rates for a
standard treatment period of 252 days.  Case Rate was increased for primiparous
cows, with an expected 0.21 cases per control animal and 0.37 cases in treated
(500 mg) primiparous cows.  Case Rate was also increased for multiparous cows,
with an expected 0.36 cases of clinical mastitis in control animals and 0.54
cases in treated (500 mg) cows. The total Days Affected Rate for primiparous
cows was not increased by treatment with sometribove.  For multiparous cows,
Days Affected Rate was increased from 1.49 in controls to 2.15 in treated (500
mg) animals.  The results from this analysis are presented in Table 67. The P
value reported in Table 67 refers to the probability associated with the
regression, not to the comparison between the 0 and 500 mg dose group.<P>

A separate analysis was conducted for the TAS study because the range of
doses of sometribove was considerably different from the range in the remainder
of the studies.  Over two years of treatment, this study covered 32961 quarter
days when new cases could be observed in 27 primiparous cows (8466 days with
overlap).  In 56 multiparous cows, there were 76823 quarter days when new cases
could be observed, which covered 19820 days, considering overlap.  Although
there was numerical evidence for a dose related increase in Case Rate and Days
Affected Rate in this study, the high background level of clinical mastitis
resulted in no significant differences detected in the pooled analysis at the
use level of the drug (500 mg) although the linear trend was significant (Table
68).<P>

The average case duration in controls versus treated cows in these clinical
trials was 4.5 versus 4.6 days; in the TAS study the average durations were 5.4
versus 5.5 days, respectively.  Thus, the increased total days affected with
clinical mastitis in sometribove-treated cows reflected the greater number of
clinical mastitis cases and not increased average duration per case.<P>
<b>Subclinical Mastitis</b><p>
Analysis of subclinical mastitis on a per cow basis indicated that
treatment with sometribove significantly increased the number of animals with
this condition.  The relative risks for contracting subclinical mastitis for
the 250, 500, and 750 mg groups were 1.56, 1.55, and 1.51, respectively,
compared to controls (Table 70).<P>
On a quarter basis, the results showed a general association between
sometribove level and testing positive for subclinical mastitis (P=0.001) for
all dose levels.  The relative risks for testing positive for subclinical
mastitis for the 250, 500, and 750 mg groups were 1.60, 1.81, and 1.52,
respectively, compared to controls (Table 70).  A separate analysis (results
not shown) indicated that for the four microbiological categories evaluated
(i.e., pathogen, coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CNS), environmental, and
other), at the use level of the drug the "pathogen" and the "CNS" categories
were statistically significant (P=.001) for general association.  <P>

<b>Somatic Cell Counts (SCC)</b><p>
Several analyses were conducted on somatic cell count (SCC) data from the
TAS, 4 Dose-SC (all four locations), Single Dose-IM (all four locations),
Dose-IM, and IM/SC studies.  <P>
First, data from each study location were analyzed individually by parity.
Sometribove treatment resulted in significantly higher SCC (P&#60; 0.10) for the
following location-parity groups:  Dardenne IM (multiparous only), Cornell IM
(multiparous only), Arizona IM (multiparous only), Dose-IM (multiparous only),
Utah SQ (multiparous only), and TAS year one (primiparous only).<P>
Data were then pooled for the Single Dose-IM (excluding the Utah location)
study.  Analyses showed that multiparous cows treated with 500 mg sometribove
had significantly higher SCC than control multiparous cows.  Also, when
parities were pooled, SCC were statistically higher in treated cows (Table 71).
<P>
Results were also pooled from the 4 Dose-SC (excluding the Utah location),
Dose-IM, and IM/SC studies.  This analysis revealed no significant increase in
SCC due to sometribove treatment (Table 72).<P>

<br>
To summarize, SCC were elevated in some herds.  Removal of clinically
mastitic cows from the analysis did not eliminate the effect.  Since somatic
cell counts are an indicator of the subclinical infection status of a herd, the
elevations observed in some sometribove trials may have reflected the increased
subclinical infection rate at these study locations.<P>
<b>Conclusions</b>:<P>
Administration of sometribove (500 mg/14 days):  1) increases the risk of
clinical mastitis in both primiparous and multiparous cows; 2) increases the
number of cases of clinical mastitis in both primiparous and multiparous cows;
3) increases the risk of subclinical mastitis in both parity groups; and 4)
increases milk somatic cell counts in some herds.  The product labeling advises
of these effects to inform the user of risks associated on a per animal basis.
Also, the labeling states that herd mastitis management practices should be
thoroughly evaluated prior to initiating the use of sometribove.<P>
FDA also concluded that the increase in clinical mastitis in
sometribove-treated cows was not a public health concern with respect to
antibiotic residues in milk being increased above tolerance due to therapeutic
treatment of mastitis.  Although the incidence of clinical mastitis was
increased in treated cows, there was no indication that these cases of mastitis
were more difficult to treat, as reflected by the similar average duration of
cases between treated and control cows. When examined on a per unit milk basis,
the increase in the incidence of clinical mastitis due to sometribove
(approximately 0.1 case per cow per year) is about 4 to 9 times <b>less</b>
than the effects due to other sources of variation, such as season, parity,
stage of lactation, and herd-to-herd variation.  For example, on a per unit
milk basis, the increase in mastitis incidence from winter to summer is at
least nine times greater than the increase due to sometribove treatment.  Also,
the increase in mastitis between early lactation (when sometribove would not be
administered) compared to late lactation is at least seven times greater than
the effect of sometribove.  (See references by Smith et al. [1985, J. Dairy
Science 68:1531]; Morse et al. [1988, J. Dairy Science 71:848]; and Hogan et
al. [1989, J. Dairy Science 72:1547]). <p>
Another important factor is that therapeutic drugs, such as antibiotics for
the treatment of clinical mastitis, are to be used in food-producing animals
only under approved conditions and with appropriate withdrawal periods (as
established by FDA) to ensure that food products are safe for human
consumption.  State and Federal regulatory bodies currently monitor milk
supplies for drug residues, and any milk that contains illegal residues is
discarded.  In addition, the dairy industry currently tests every tanker truck
of milk for penicillin-like, beta-lactam drugs prior to processing.  The
beta-lactams are the most commonly used drugs for the treatment of mastitis so
that even if an increase in use of these drugs--and an increase in illegal
residues--occurred as a result of increased mastitis, any residues would result
in the rejection of the milk before it could enter the market.  <P>
Allergic reactions are the most common side effect of the beta-lactam
antibiotics, the predominant therapeutic treatment for clinical mastitis, and
these agents are the most common cause of drug allergies. Three to 10 &#37; of the
human population is allergic to penicillin. Penicillin allergies develop
following long-term (weeks) exposure to high doses (therapeutic).  Once an
individual is allergic to penicillin, smaller doses can cause an allergic
reaction.  Typically these reactions consist of a skin rash and are not
considered to be significant health risks.  In the last 25 years, there have
been less than 10 cases of allergic reactions worldwide following the
consumption of penicillin residues in milk (Dewdney et al., 1991, Food Chem.
Toxicol. 21:477-483).  All of these adverse reactions involved penicillin
residues in the milk at levels well above FDA's current tolerance of 5 parts
per billion (ppb).  Currently, the commonly used screening test for beta-lactam
residues in milk is the <i>Bacillus stearothemophilus</i>&#160; disc assay, which
detects penicillin residues at  &gt;&#61;3-5 ppb.  This provides an indication
of the magnitude of the public health concern for violative antibiotic residues
in food.  <P>
In view of the much larger variation in the number of clinical mastitis
cases due to other factors, the monitoring of milk for illegal drug residues,
and the minuscule public health concern for beta-lactam antibiotic residues in
milk, FDA concluded that the use of sometribove was not important in
considering the overall incidence of mastitis per unit of milk produced and
therefore not a public health concern.<P>
FDA's Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee and expert consultants were
convened for an open public hearing to discuss the issue of increased mastitis
in sometribove-treated cows and a potential increase in the risk of antibiotic
residues in milk on March 31, 1993.  After hearing presentations from
interested parties, and after considering the data presented to the Committee,
the Committee concluded that, while sometribove treatment might cause a
statistically significant increase in mastitis, the increased risk to human
health posed by mastitis and resultant use of antibiotics was
insignificant.<P>

<P>
October 18, 1996<P>
<B>PRESIDENT SIGNS ANIMAL DRUG AVAILABILITY ACT</B><P>
The Animal Drug Availability Act (H.R. 2508), signed by the President on Oct.
9, l996, introduces several amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act that lend new flexibility to the way FDA regulates animal drugs and
medicated feeds. <P>
The law, which is designed to increase the number of animal drugs on the
market, was supported by FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine and a coalition
of animal industry groups which included manufacturers of animal health
products, veterinarians, and livestock producers.  The Animal Drug Availability
Act (ADAA) reflects legislative changes that will benefit the animal health
industry and the nation's animals without compromising FDA's mission to protect
the public health.<P>
The new legislation reflects the spirit of the White House program to reinvent
the government (REGO) by reducing regulatory burdens on the animal health
industry without undermining the safety of animal drug products.  The ADAA:<P>

<UL>
<LI>injects flexibility into the process FDA uses to evaluate and approve new
animal drugs by amending the current definition of substantial evidence of
effectiveness.  This change will permit flexibility in studies required to
demonstrate a new animal drug's effectiveness, and eliminate the requirement
for field studies.
<LI>provides for greater direct interaction between animal drug sponsors and
the FDA during the drug development process.  The law requires a presubmission
conference, held at the sponsor's discretion, to discuss the drug development
at its earliest stages.  The goal is for the FDA and the manufacturers to reach
a common understanding regarding what data will be needed to establish safety
and effectiveness, and what types of studies can be conducted to generate such
data.
<LI>creates a new category of drugs -- "Veterinary Feed Directive Drugs" that
allows the approval and use of sophisticated new animal drugs in animal feed,
on a veterinarian's order, while incorporating safeguards to ensure the safe
use of such drugs.
<LI>supports "flexible labeling" that permits a range of
acceptable/recommended doses to appear on animal drug product labeling, rather
than one optimum dose.  In addition, the law directs FDA to broaden the
approval process to make available more animal drugs to treat minor species.
The Act requires FDA to propose the necessary changes within 18 months.
</UL><P>
The law also directs FDA to issue the following implementing regulations:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Within six months of enactment, FDA must propose regulations that define
the meaning of "adequate and well controlled" field investigations under the
actual conditions of the study.  These regulations must be finalized within 18
months.
<LI>Within 12 months of enactment, FDA is required to propose regulations to
define "substantial evidence" necessary to encourage submission of new animal
drug applications and supplemental applications, and to address the use of dose
range labeling.  These final regulations are to be issued within 24 months
after the date of enactment.</UL><P>
The passage of ADAA represents the culmination of two years of intense
partnering efforts by CVM and its stakeholders to address the need for
increased animal drug availability.  The success of this initiative displays
how regulatory agencies can engage in civil discourse with the regulated
industries to reach mutually beneficial agreements. During the process, a
greater sense of mutual trust and respect developed and a less adversarial
relationship between CVM and the regulated industries emerged.<P>

    7500 Standish Place, HFV-12, Rockville, Maryland 20855<p>
     To market a generic animal drug product in the United 
    States, a person or a company must obtain approval of an 
    Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application from the Food and 
    Drug Administration.<p> <ol>
<li><b>What is an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application?</b><p>
    On November 16, 1988, the President signed into law the 
    Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act. The new 
    law, known as GADPTRA, amends the Federal Food, Drug, and 
    Cosmetic Act to provide for the approval of generic copies of 
    animal drug products that have been previously approved and 
    shown to be safe and effective when used in accordance with 
    their labeling. Under GADPTRA, a generic animal drug product 
    may be approved by providing evidence that it has the same 
    active ingredients, in the same concentration, as the 
    approved animal drug product, and that it is bioequivalent to 
    the approved animal drug product. This information is 
    submitted to the Food and Drug Administration in the form of 
    an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application, or ANADA.<p>
<li><b>How do I submit an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application 
    to the FDA?</b><p>
    An ANADA is submitted to FDA on the Form FDA-356V to:<p>
     
    Document Control Unit, HFV-199<br>
    Center for Veterinary Medicine<br>
    Food and Drug Administration<br>
    7500 Standish Place<br>
    Rockville, MD 20855<p>
     The format and content of the application should be in 
    accordance with the provisions of the GADPTRA, and in 
    accordance with the policies and procedures established by 
    FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). CVM is charged 
    with the responsibility of review in and approving ANADAs. 
    The Center has published in the FEDERAL REGISTER several 
    policy letters which provide information needed to file an 
    ANADA. Copies of the necessary forms and policy letters may 
    be obtained at the address listed at the bottom of this MEMO.<p>
<li><b>What animal drug products are eligible to be copied as 
    generics?</b><p>
    All animal drugs that were approved for safety and 
    effectiveness on November 16, 1988, or have been approved 
    since that date, and are not protected by patent or 
    exclusivity are eligible for copying under the provisions of 
    the GADPTRA, unless the animal drug has been subsequently 
    withdrawn from the market for safety or effectiveness 
    reasons, or unless it is the subject of a Notice of Hearing 
    that has been published in the FEDERAL REGISTER. To meet 
    requirements of the GADPTRA, the Center for Veterinary 
    Medicine has arranged for the publication of a list of animal 
    drug products that are eligible to be copied as generics. 
    This list, which is entitled "List of FDA Approved Animal 
    Drug Products," was first published in January, 1989. It is 
    published annually and is updated monthly. The publication, 
    also known as the "Green Book," may be obtained by writing to:<p>
     
    Drug Information Laboratory<br>
    Phase IV, Room 285<br>
    VA-MD Regional College of Veterinary Medicine <br>
    Blacksburg, Virginia 24061-0442.<p>
     A subscription fee is charged to cover the cost of printing. 
    The cost of a 1996 subscription is $65.00 per year for the first 
    copy and $40.00 for additional copies mailed to the same 
    address within the United States. Subscriptions mailed to 
    foreign addresses are $85.00 per year for the first copy and 
    $45.00 for additional copies mailed to the same address.<p>
<li><b>What is exclusivity?</b><p>
    The GADPTRA provides for a period of 3 years of marketing 
    exclusivity for a new use of an animal drug (a use that 
    required reports of new clinical or field investigations for 
    its approval), during which time no abbreviated application 
    for a generic copy may be approved for the new use.<p>
    The law provides for a period of 5 years of marketing 
    exclusivity for an animal drug that has not been previously 
    approved in any new animal drug application. During this 
    period, no abbreviated application may be submitted. 
    (Exception: An abbreviated application may be submitted after 
    4 years if the generic applicant claims noninfringement of a 
    listed patent that is claimed for the approved product or its 
    use.)
    The law also provides for another form of marketing 
    exclusivity, known as patent term restoration. This type of 
    exclusivity extends the period of protection by U.S. patent 
    for an animal drug, or its method of use, that was approved 
    after November 16, 1988, to compensate for the time that was 
    required for investigation and regulatory review of the 
    animal drug prior to its approval. Patent term restoration is 
    not related to the exclusivity periods described above and 
    may overlap those exclusivity periods.<p>
<li><b>What kind of information must be included in an 
    Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application?</b><p>
    An ANADA contains several kinds of information. The 
    following, outline is general and is not meant to be a 
    comprehensive listing of requirements:<p>
    <b>Identification or Basis</b> - The proposed generic product and 
    the approved (listed) product that will be copied are 
    identified.<p>
    <b>Patent Information</b> - The application provides certification 
    by the applicant that a patent does not exist, that a patent 
    has expired or will soon expire, or that a patent claimed for 
    the approved product is invalid or will not be infringed upon 
    by approval of the abbreviated application. In the 
    latter-case, the generic applicant or sponsor must then 
    notify the sponsor of the approved product application and 
    the owner of the patent that he or she has filed an 
    abbreviated application claiming invalidity or 
    noninfringement of the patent. Further details may be 
    obtained at the address listed at the end of this MEMO.<p>
    <b>Labeling</b> - The application contains copies of the proposed 
    labeling for the generic product and of the approved labeling 
    for the listed product. The labeling of the proposed product 
    must contain all of the same indications, warnings, cautions, 
    directions for use, etc., as that of the approved product. It 
    may differ only in tradename, logo, name and address, etc., 
    that would be specific to the generic product itself.<p>
    <b>Ingredients</b> - The application identifies all of the active 
    and inactive ingredients and any other components used in the 
    manufacturing process of the proposed generic product and 
    their concentration in the final product. The active 
    ingredients must be the same as those of the approved product 
    unless they are the subject of an approved "Suitability 
    Petition" (See Question 8). The finished product must also be 
    the same strength, dosage form, and route of administration 
    as the approved product, unless it is the subject of an 
    approved Suitability Petition. The type of differences 
    eligible for consideration in a Suitability Petition are 
    described later in this MEMO.<p>
   <b> Bioequivalence</b> - The application contains information to show 
    bioequivalence between the proposed generic product and the 
    approved product. The applicant may request that <i>in vivo</i> &#160; 
    bioequivalence testing be waived, or refer to an earlier 
    letter approving a request for waiver.<p>
    <b>Human Food Safety</b> - A tissue residue depletion study may be 
    required
    for the proposed generic product if it is intended for use in 
    food-producing animals. Further information may be obtained

    <b>Manufacturing Methods, Facilities, and Controls</b> - The 
    application describes in detail the manufacture of the 
    proposed generic product, the manufacturing facilities, key 
    personnel, analytical methods, specifications, quality 
    control procedures, etc. All animal drugs, whether generic or 
    not, must be manufactured in accordance with FDA's Good 
    Manufacturing Practice regulations (GMPs). An FDA inspection 
    for compliance with GMPs will be required. Current GMP 
    regulations are found in Title 21, Code of Federal 
    Regulations, Parts 210 to 226. Further information and 
    requirements regarding registration and inspection of a 
    manufacturing facility may be obtained at the address listed 
    at the bottom of this MEMO.<p>
    <b>Samples</b> - Samples should be provided only if specifically 
    requested by FDA.<p>
    <b>Environmental Impact</b> - Every application must contain either 
    an environmental assessment (EA) or a request for categorical 
    exclusion from an EA. Regulations for reporting environmental 
    information are codified in Title 21, Part 25 of the Code of 
    Federal Regulations.<p>
   <b>FOI Summary</b> - An FOI Summary, which summarizes the studies 
    forming the basis of approval of the application, is 
    required. A guideline of the requirements for preparing an 
    FOI Summary is available from the address at the bottom of 
    this MEMO.<p>
<li><b>When can I request a waiver from <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence 
    studies?</b><p>
    For certain animal drug products or types of products,  
    <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence studies may not be necessary. Generally, 
   these products are solutions intended for oral or parenteral 
    use. They will have the same components and composition as 
    the listed animal drug product, or they will have only minor 
    differences in inert ingredients from those of the listed 
    product. Ordinarily, other more complex dosage forms, i.e., 
    tablets, capsules, etc., and medicated feeds or feed premixes 
    will not be granted a waiver. A request for waiver for any 
    product can be submitted at any time prior to submission of 
    an ANADA. It will be assigned an Investigational New Animal 
    Drug (INAD) application number and evaluated. The request for 
    waiver should contain enough information on the composition 
    of the proposed generic product and its differences from the 
    listed product to allow a determination of whether 
    bioequivalence studies would be needed.<p>
<li><b>How do I perform a bioequivalence study?</b><p>
    A bioequivalency study must be performed in accordance with 
    the FDA's Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) regulations. This 
    also applies to a Clinical End Point study when such a study 
    is accepted in lieu of a blood-level bioequivalence study. 
    The FDA recommends that protocols be submitted for review 
    before any study is begun. Further information on 
    requirements and design of bioequivalency studies may be 
    obtained from the address at the end of this MEMO.<p>
<li><b>What is a Suitability Petition and what kind of 
    differences between an approved product and a proposed 
    generic product can be considered in a Suitability Petition?</b><p>
    A Suitability Petition is much the same as a Citizens 
    Petition. It is a public document and may be viewed by the 
    public at large. It must be submitted to:<P>
     
    Dockets Management Branch, HFA-305<br>
    Room 1-23<br>
    Food and Drug Administration<br>
    12420 Parklawn Drive<br>
    Rockville, MD 20857<p>
     A Suitability Petition may only request permission to submit 
    an ANADA for a proposed generic product that is claimed to be 
    bioequivalent to the listed product but that differs from the 
    listed product in certain specific ways. The proposed generic 
    product may only differ from the listed product if it is (1) 
    a different dosage form, (2) a different strength or (3) a 
    different route of administration, or it contains (4) more 
    than one active ingredient and one of the active ingredients 
    is different than that of the listed drug product, or if it 
    is (5) a product intended for use in combination with another 
    product in animal feed and the active ingredient of one of 
    the products is different from the active ingredient of one 
    of the listed products approved in combination. No active 
    ingredient of a single active ingredient animal drug product 
    may be substituted for another. Further information regarding 
    Suitability Petition requirements may be obtained at the 
    address at the end of this Memo.<p>
<li><b>How long will it take to get approval to market my generic 
    animal drug product?</b><p>
    The statutory limit for approval of an ANADA is 180 days, as 
    it is for a New Animal Drug Application (NADA). Seldom, 
    however, is an application approved on the first submission. 
    When an incomplete letter is sent to an applicant, the 
    180-day clock restarts upon receipt of the applicant's 
    response. This process may continue, in some cases for 
    several cycles. Generally, an ANADA will have a shorter 
    average overall approval time than an NADA because of the 
    relatively lesser complexity of the generic application. The 
    time of approval, to a large extent, depends upon the quality 
    and completeness of the original application and its 
    subsequent amendments.<p>
<li><b>Whom can I call for assistance and additional information?</b><p>
    Inquiries regarding the approval process and regulatory 
    requirements for ANADAs may be obtained by writing or calling: <P>

<b> a.  14-Day Drug Tolerance Study (30X)</b><P>
<b>Study No. 100-DDC-COW-JLV-86-011</b><P>

An acute drug tolerance study was conducted to evaluate the safety of
extremely high doses (up to 30X) of sometribove in lactating cows.  The study
was conducted at Monsanto's Animal Research Center at Dardenne, MO.  <P>

<P>
Eight lactating (238-246 days postpartum), pregnant (102-190 days in
gestation) multiparous Holstein cows were assigned randomly to receive five
concurrent, independent 3000 mg doses of sometribove (a total of 15,000 mg) or
saline (control) by SC administration on days 1 and 8 of the 14-day study.
This represented 30 times the intended commercial use dose of 500 mg at
one-half the intended dosing interval of 14 days. Cows were housed in an
evaporatively cooled facility and maintained in individual box-stalls.
<P>

Cows were milked twice a day.  Weight of milk yield was recorded for each
cow at each milking beginning 7 days prior to first injection, and milk
composition (fat, protein, and lactose percent and somatic cell count) was
measured at AM and PM milkings from each cow on days -4, -2, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
12, and 14.  A total mixed ration formulated to meet the nutritional
requirements recommended by NRC (1978) was fed. Samples of the diet were
collected daily, composited weekly, and analyzed for nutrient content.  Cows
were acclimated to the facility and diet at least 30 days prior to first
treatment.  Daily feed intake was measured for each cow beginning day -7.
<P>

Animals were observed for health status at least twice daily.  Heart,
respiratory, and rumen motility rates and clinical signs were monitored at -1,
2, 4, and 6 hours relative to sometribove administration on days 1 and 8 and
daily throughout the treatment period.  Rectal body temperatures were measured
twice daily.  Animals received physical examinations before and at the end of
the treatment period.  Body weight was measured on day -7 and at the end of the
study.  Blood samples were collected for hematology and clinical chemistries on
days -4, -2, 1, 8, and 14.  Additional blood samples were collected for hormone
and metabolite analyses on days -4, -2, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 (samples
on days 1 and 8 were taken at 0, 6, and 12 hrs postadministration).  Results
from blood analyses are presented in Section 6.m.2.  All cows were necropsied
on days 15 or 16.  Tissues collected from all cows are listed in Table
12.<P>

Quantitative variables were analyzed by analysis of variance, using
pretreatment responses, when appropriate, as covariates.<P>

The only pathologic abnormalities detected either grossly or
microscopically were injection site lesions.  The lesions were limited to the
subcutis in 12 of 16 sites examined.  In the remaining 4 sites, the
inflammation extended into the <i>M. cutaneous trunci</i>&#160;.  All sites had
granulomatous inflammation with macrophages, lymphocytes, and giant cells, as
well as fibrous connective tissue.  Necrosis was found centrally in these
granulomata.  The lesions graded from moderate to severe and were considered a
direct effect of the test article. Injection site reactions resulting from
sometribove at the proposed use level were evaluated in additional studies and
are discussed in Section 6.g.<P>

No health problems, such as lameness, digestive anomalies, metabolic
disorders, tetany, or abortions were observed during the treatment period.
Clinical mastitis was not observed, and milk somatic cell counts were not
suggestive of subclinical mastitis in treated cows (Table 13).<P>

Milk and 3.5 &#37;  fat-corrected milk production were significantly increased in
treated cows (Table 13).  Milk fat percent was decreased during the first week
of treatment but not during the second week nor when averaged over the entire
treatment period.  Milk protein percent was decreased during sometribove
treatment, probably due to decreased energy and nitrogen balances as a result
of increased milk production and a decrease in feed intake (see below).  Milk
lactose percent was not significantly affected by treatment.<P>

A small, but measurable, increase in average rectal temperature was
observed within six hours and peaked within two days of sometribove
administration.  However, group averages remained within the range of rectal
temperatures typically observed in dairy cows (Table 14). Heart, respiratory,

Dry matter intake was depressed in treated cows (Table 15).  The increase
in milk production and decrease in intake resulted in a significantly decreased
net energy balance in treated cows.  Body weight was not significantly affected
by treatment.  (Subsequent long-term studies demonstrated that dry matter
intake in sometribove-treated cows increases after several weeks of treatment;

A two-lactation chronic toxicity study was conducted to evaluate the safety
of sometribove administered intramuscularly to 82 Holstein cows in their first,
second, or third lactation.  The study was conducted at Monsanto's Dardenne
Dairy Center, Dardenne, MO.  <P>

Cows were housed in a tie-stall facility with artificial lighting and
ventilation.  All cows were purchased and calved on-location prior to treatment
initiation to allow acclimation.  <P>

Cows were assigned to treatment in a randomized block design. Treatments
were 1, 3, or 5 concurrent unit doses (unit dose = 600 mg, or 1.2X intended
commercial dose) of sometribove or 5 unit doses of excipient administered
intramuscularly.  Treatments were every 14 days from 60  &#177;   3 days postpartum
until a minimum of 74 days prepartum to allow a sufficient dry period or until
average daily milk production declined below 5 kg/day.  Open (non-pregnant)
cows remained on treatment until 305 days of lactation or until average daily
milk production was below 5 kg/day, whichever occurred first, at which time
they were necropsied.  Injections were alternated among 10 different sites in
the semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and gluteus muscles.<P>

Six cows remained open during the second lactation of treatment (Table 18).
Thirty cows began the third lactation of study after giving birth.  These cows
were euthanized 2-3 weeks into lactation (Table 18). Four control and four 3000
mg cows that began the third lactation underwent complete necropsy (gross
anatomic pathology and histopathology).  The remaining cows underwent
postmortem evaluation.<P>

Cows were milked twice daily at 12-hour intervals, and weight of milk yield
was recorded for each cow at each milking throughout both lactations.  The
appearance of mastitic/abnormal milk was recorded. Milk samples were collected
four times each week at consecutive PM, AM, PM, and AM milkings (days 5, 6, 12,
and 13 post-injection) and analyzed for fat and protein percent and somatic
cell count.  Milk samples were collected at four consecutive milkings per week
(days 4, 5, 11, and 12 post-injection) for analysis of lactose content.  Milk
ash, calcium, and phosphorus (both lactations) and magnesium and zinc (2nd
lactation only) were measured at approximately monthly intervals. <P>

Cows were fed diets formulated to meet or exceed nutritional requirements
recommended by NRC (1978).  Cows were fed twice daily, and amounts of feed
offered and refused were recorded daily throughout the study.  Samples of each
diet were collected daily, composited weekly, and analyzed for nutrient
content.  Body weights were measured once weekly from parturition until dry-off
for each cow.<P>

Estrus detection was based on visual appraisal.  In addition, commercial
milk progesterone kits were used during the first lactation of study to aid in
estrus detection.  Breeding occurred from approximately 40 to 140 days
postpartum in the first lactation and days 60 to 275 postpartum during the
second lactation.  Semen from two sires were randomly assigned for artificial
insemination.  When prescribed by the staff veterinarian, prostaglandins were
utilized as a reproductive aid.  <P>

The general health status of all animals was evaluated daily throughout the
study.  Rectal temperatures were measured daily beginning two days prior to
injection until treatment was discontinued.  Veterinary physical examinations
were conducted at approximately 40 and 180 days postpartum and during the last
week of treatment in each lactation as well as at two weeks postpartum in the
third lactation.  Blood and urine samples were collected at physical
examinations and analyzed. Any animal that became moribund or died on study was
necropsied.<P>

Blood was sampled during treatment weeks -2, -1, 3, and 7 and then every 8
weeks (year 1) or every 4 weeks (year 2).  Whole blood was analyzed for
hematology parameters.  Serum or plasma samples were analyzed for clinical
chemistries and hormones and metabolites, as well as anti-somatotropin
binding.<P>

All calves born on study were observed for 30 days following birth. The
male calves born following the first lactation were then necropsied; the female
calves from the first lactation continued on study through sexual maturity to
assess reproductive performance. Female calves from the second lactation were
necropsied after the observation period.  <P>
<b> Statistics</b>:<P>

Cow 85690, diagnosed with paratuberculosis, and her offspring (twins) were
excluded from all analyses.  Cows removed early from the study (85075, 85117,
and 85005 during the first lactation; 85771 and 85017 during the second
lactation) were excluded from the production, reproduction, blood, and urine
data analyses for the lactations in which they were dropped.  However, these
cows were included in the health and mastitis database so that all health and
mastitis incidents were included in the analyses.  <P>

Average daily yield of 3.5 &#37;  fat-corrected milk (FCM) and milk fat, protein,
and lactose percents for 16 treatment cycles (224 days) were analyzed
separately for each year of study and for each parity group (primiparous and
multiparous).  Analysis was also performed on daily averages of each variable
calculated over four 56-day periods of treatment to allow for comparison of
treatment effects during different time intervals of the entire treatment
period.  In addition, FCM production standardized to 224 days of treatment as
described in Section 6.c was analyzed.  Milk minerals (ash, calcium,
phosphorus, zinc, and magnesium) were analyzed at each sample period,
separately for each year of study and parity group.  <P>

Each production variable was subjected to separate normality and
heterogeneity tests and model building.  The basic model included treatment,
block, covariate and, where appropriate, interactions of treatment by block,
treatment by parity and block by parity.  Cows were blocked by location within
the barn.  The covariate was the first-year, 2-week pretreatment average,
expressed as deviation from mean pretreatment data for the appropriate
parity.<P>

Blood data were analyzed separately for each year of study and for each
parity group by repeated measures analysis (exceptions listed below). Each
variable was subjected to separate normality and heterogeneity tests.
Pretreatment data were analyzed by a linear model including treatment and,
where appropriate, block, parity and all two-way interactions.  Data were
pre-adjusted to a baseline covariate using the slope from a model that included
the effects listed above for production variables and a repeated measures part
including week of treatment, the interaction between treatment and week and,
where appropriate, interactions between week and block and/or parity. Modified
marginal means for pre-adjusted data were estimated and appropriate standard
errors and mean squares for constructing confidence intervals and testing
hypotheses were calculated.  When the treatment by week interaction or any one
of three contrasts comparing control versus sometribove dosage by time was
significant (P &#60; 0.1) then differences between control and treated cows were
examined at each week.  Otherwise, only treatment main effects were examined
for differences of sometribove groups from control.  <P>

Exceptions to the repeated measures analysis were chi-square analyses used
for band neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils and monocytes.  The treatment week
means were categorized and separate dose by category analyses were run for
primiparous and multiparous cows for each week sampled.  If an overall
treatment effect by week was significant (P &#60; 0.1) then differences between
control and treated cows were examined for each week by running individual
chi-square analyses.<P>
 
<b>Production Response</b>:<P>

FCM production and milk composition were evaluated in this study to
determine whether high doses of sometribove over multiple lactations had a
negative effect on milk production and also to verify that the study conditions
represented a valid system to evaluate animal safety.<P>

During the first lactation of treatment, sometribove treatment increased
FCM production at all dosage levels and the response was maintained throughout
the treatment period (Table 20).  Production in the 4th quarter of treatment
for primiparous cows was numerically, but not statistically increased, probably
because of low animal numbers. However, FCM production over the entire
treatment period was significantly increased in both parity groups.  <P>

During the second lactation of treatment, animal numbers were low,
particularly in the second parity group.  FCM yield was numerically higher in
all treated groups compared to controls over all periods of treatment (Table
21).<P>

Milk fat, protein, and lactose percents were not significantly affected by
sometribove treatment during each lactation of treatment. Similarly, milk ash,
calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and zinc content were not significantly
affected by sometribove treatment.<P>

These results indicated that sometribove-treated cows were able to produce
greater yields of milk with normal composition over multiple lactations at
doses up to 6 times the intended commercial level.<P>

<b>Pathology</b>:<P>

The pathologic examination of cows, calves, and fetuses included a review
of clinical observations, terminal body and organ weights, a macroscopic
examination, microbiological culturing of tissues (if necessary), microscopic
evaluation, data summarization, statistical analysis, and interpretation of
data.  For each completely necropsied cow, over 60 samples representing 30
different tissues and representing all major organ systems were collected (see
Section 6.a, Table 12) and 17 tissues or organs were weighed routinely at
necropsy.<P>

Sometribove did not have any observed effect on nervous (brain, pineal
gland, pituitary, spinal cord, sciatic nerve, and eyes), lymphoreticular
(cervical, mediastinal, mesenteric or supramammary lymph nodes, spleen, and
thymus) and gastrointestinal (esophagus, rumen, reticulum, omasum, abomasum,
duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, and exocrine pancreas) systems of cows
or calves.  Moreover, the incidence of macroscopic and microscopic lesions in
parathyroid, trachea, pancreas, urinary bladder, gall bladder, aorta, skin,
calves, and fetuses was not influenced by sometribove.  This was also true for
accessory sex organs of male calves (prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymides,
and testes).  However, in the necropsies performed following the first year of
the study, the percentage of cows (parities pooled) with synovitis/articular
erosions in the 0, 600, 1800, and 3000 mg dose groups was 0, 23, 36, and 17 &#37; ,
respectively.  Following the second year of study, the percentage of cows with
synovitis/articular erosions was 28, 25, 14, and 22 &#37;  across the respective dose
groups. (See discussion on the effects of sometribove on lameness in Section
6.f.)<P>

Sometribove also did not affect absolute organ weights and organ-to-body
and organ-to-brain weight ratios for brain, pituitary, parathyroids, liver, or
lungs of cows.  The data suggest that organ weights and organ weight ratios for
thyroid and adrenal glands were minimally increased.  There were no
sometribove-related lesions in thyroid or adrenal glands.<P>

Gross and microscopic findings were generally unremarkable in animals
treated with sometribove.  Small multifocal adhesions were scattered on the
pleural surfaces of the thoracic cavity of 25 treated and 5 control cows.
These adhesions were associated with microscopic diagnoses including chronic
pleuritis, adhesions/pleural hyperplasia or thickening, chronic pericarditis,
hyperplasia of pericardial membranes, epicardial fibrosis, and/or villus
hyperplasia of visceral pleura.  The pleural and pericardial lesions are common
sequelae to severe respiratory disease and/or complications of traumatic
reticuloperitonitis.  No clinical cardiac abnormalities were detected
antemortem. <P>

The incidence and severity of interlobular and interstitial fibrosis in the
mammary gland were numerically higher in the 3000 mg cows than controls and,
for this reason, mammary tissue was examined microscopically from all cows in
the study.  The higher incidence of mastitis in the 3000 mg sometribove-treated
group (see Section 6.j) was the likely cause of interlobular and interstitial
fibrosis in mammary tissue of this group.<P>

Gravid uteri of control and sometribove-treated cows were normal.  At or
near the completion of the first lactation of treatment, the incidence of
microscopic lesions found in non-gravid uteri was higher among
sometribove-treated animals.  <P>

Intramuscular injection sites were characterized by a localized
inflammatory reaction and subsequent persistent scarring.  Lesions produced by
IM injections were considered to be unacceptable due to hidden injection site
carcass damage.  The Chronic Animal Toxicity Study employing the IM route of
administration was acceptable to support the safety of the compound using a
subcutaneous (SC) route of administration because exposure of IM treated
animals to the drug was equal to or greater than with SC administration (see
Section 6.c).  In addition, histological data from injection site reactions
following SC administration of sometribove were required to evaluate the
acceptability of this injection route (see Section 6.g).<P>

Sixteen fetuses were examined when cows were sacrificed as scheduled during
the first or second year of treatment.  All fetuses were developing normally.
<P>

Nineteen male (first year) and 16 female calves (second year) were
sacrificed as scheduled at the completion of the 4-5 week observation period.
Neither sometribove nor parity of cows at the start of the study appeared to
influence the terminal body weights, absolute organ weights or organ weight
ratios of calves necropsied after their dams had been treated for one or two
lactations.<P>

<b>Other Results</b>:<P>

Nutritional variables and performance in the early subsequent lactational
periods are summarized in Section 6.h.  Effects on mastitis incidence are
discussed in Section 6.j, reproduction is reviewed in Section 6.i, and cow
health in Section 6.k.  Blood variable results are provided in Section 6.m.2,
circulating anti-somatotropin binding activity is discussed in Section 6.m.1,
and urine variable data are reviewed in Section 6.m.4.  Effects on rectal body
temperature are provided in Section 6.m.3.  Effects on offspring are discussed
in Section 6.l.<P>

As discussed in the above referenced sections, sometribove-treated cows in
the Chronic Animal Toxicity Study, in general, had more health and mastitis
incidents and more reproductive problems than control cows. FDA concluded that
effects on cow health, mastitis, and reproduction at doses nearer to the
expected use level would need to be examined in the pivotal effectiveness and
clinical studies to further evaluate the effects of sometribove on animal
safety.  <P>

FDA also concluded that intramuscular injection of sometribove was
unacceptable due to muscle scarring and that an IM/SC bridging study would
determine whether the IM route of administration would be acceptable to support
the safety of sometribove administered subcutaneously.  Histological data from
injection site reactions following SC administration were needed to determine
the acceptability of this injection route.<P>

<b>Study No. 100-DDC-COW-TCW-86-032</b><P>

In order for animal safety data from IM studies to be supportive of studies
where sometribove was injected SC, exposure of treated animals to the drug
would need to be equal to or greater than with SC administration.  The purpose
of this study was to determine whether studies in which sometribove was
administered IM would be supportive of studies where sometribove was injected
SC, the intended route of administration.  Two measurements were used as prime
indicators of relative exposure for the two modes of administration ((IM and
SC):  1) production of salable 3.5 &#37;  fat-corrected milk standardized to 252 days
of treatment ((SSFCM), and 2) blood concentration of somatotropin.<P>

The study was conducted at the Monsanto Animal Research Center, Dardenne,
MO.  <P>

<b>Materials and Methods</b>:<P>

Animals were housed in a tie-stall facility with artificial lighting and
evaporative cooling.  Sixty-four Holstein cows were randomly assigned within
parity (1st or 2nd and 3rd lactation) to receive 500 mg sometribove, IM or SC,
or excipient alone (control), IM or SC.  The distribution of cows started on
treatment is provided below:<P>

</pre>


Cows were purchased to arrive at the facility approximately two months
prior to expected calving to allow acclimation.  Treatment started 60  &#177;   3
days after calving, and all cows started on treatment within an 8-week span of
time.  Treatment or excipient was administered every 14 days.  In cows that
became pregnant, treatment continued until a minimum of 74 days prior to
expected calving to allow a sufficient dry period, until average daily milk
production in an injection cycle decreased below 5 kg/day, or through 18
injection cycles (36 weeks; 312  &#177;   3 days of lactation), whichever occurred
first.  In open cows, treatment continued through 18 injection cycles or until
average daily milk production during an injection cycle decreased below 5
kg/day, whichever occurred first. <P>

Injection sites were shaved prior to administration.  Intramuscular
injections were administered using a 17-gauge, 1.5-inch hypodermic needle into
the left semitendinosus, left semimembranosus or the right semitendinosus
muscles.  Injections were rotated according to week of study so that six weeks
elapsed between repeated use of the same administration area.  The SC
injections were administered using a 16-gauge, 5/8 or 1-inch needle in the left
postscapular, left prescapular, or right postscapular areas.  Sites were
rotated in a similar manner as for IM administration.<P>

Cows were milked twice daily at approximately 0600 and 1800 hours using
standard location procedures.  Weight of milk yield was recorded for each cow
at each milking from calving until the end of the treatment period.  The
appearance of mastitis/abnormal milk was recorded. Individual cows' milkings
that were discarded (withheld from human consumption) because the animal was
administered medication that had a milk withdrawal period were identified.
<P>
    During injection cycles 1, 7, and 13 (i.e., treatment weeks 1, 2, 13, 14,
25, and 26), milk was sampled from each cow at every PM milking. During
remaining injection cycles, milk was sampled from each cow at consecutive PM
and AM milkings every 7 days (days 5 and 12 post-injection).  Milk samples were
analyzed for fat, protein, and lactose percent and somatic cell count.
Individual quarter milk samples were collected from each cow at approximately
60-day intervals and cultured to determine the level of subclinical
mastitis.<P>

Cows were fed individual diets formulated to meet or exceed nutritional
requirements recommended by NRC (1978).  Daily feed intake was determined for
each cow throughout the study.  Animals were weighed weekly starting at
parturition.  In addition, body condition scores were determined during the
pretreatment period and at approximately 30 day intervals throughout the study
period.  <P>

All cows were bred according to established Monsanto research center
procedures.  Breeding commenced at approximately 40 days postpartum. Cows which
had not conceived after 180 days postpartum were declared open and breeding
discontinued.  <P>

Cows were observed daily (AM and PM) for signs of disease, injury or other
disorders and all adverse and health-related experiences were documented.  In
addition to daily health observations, general physical examinations were
performed at approximately 40 and 180 days postpartum and at completion of the
study (approximately 300 days postpartum). At those times, whole blood for
hematology and serum/plasma for clinical analyses were obtained.  Rectal
temperatures were measured daily during the study. <P>

Injection sites were examined and scored on days 2, 9, and 16
postinjection.  A description of the scoring system can be found in Section
6.g.<P>

Blood samples were obtained for clinical analyses at the time of physical
examinations.  Intensive sampling was also conducted in cycles 1, 4, 7, 10, 13,
and 16.  These samples were analyzed for glucose, thyroxine, creatinine,
&szlig;-hydroxybutyrate, non-esterified fatty acids, blood urea nitrogen,
insulin, and somatotropin concentrations. Relative serum anti-somatotropin
binding was determined on day 7 (postinjection) samples in cycles 1 and
4.<P>

These cows were excluded from the evaluation of relative exposure,
reproduction, and nutritional variables, but their data were included in the
analysis of clinical health, mastitis, and injection site reactions.  Although
cow #814 completed &#62;2/3 of the 252-day standardized treatment period, she
was included only in the analysis of clinical health, mastitis, and injection
site reactions because she was diagnosed with a chronic disease (bovine
leukosis).<P>

Data from the IM and SC-injected control cows were pooled within parity
groups for analysis. <P>

For the purposes of evaluating milk production, a cow's last injection
cycle was considered complete if at least 11 treatment days of data were
available beyond the last injection.  If fewer than 11 consecutive days of
treatment were available, milk production was considered to be 0 kg/day during
this cycle.  <P>

An <b>average daily milk yield</b> for each week of study was calculated
for each cow.  If a milk weight during a week was not recorded, the entire
day's yield for that cow was considered missing.  All of her remaining milk
weights for the week were averaged and then multiplied by 2.<P>

An <b>average daily 3.5 &#37;  fat-corrected milk (FCM) yield</b> for each week
was calculated for each cow.  A weekly milk fat percent was calculated from the
average of all milk samples analyzed that week.  The cow's average milk fat
percent and average daily milk yield for the week were used to calculate an
average daily FCM yield per week as described in Section 5.a.  <P>

The <b>average daily standardized FCM (SFCM) yield</b> and <b>average daily
salable standardized FCM (SSFCM) yield</b> over the 36-week standardized
treatment period was calculated for each cow using the procedures discussed in
Section 5.a.<P>

For the evaluation of serum concentrations of somatotropin, the average
circulating concentration, peak circulating concentration, and
area-under-the-curve estimate was calculated for each cow during each of the
injection cycles of intensive blood sampling (1, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16).<P>

Analysis of data was as described in Section 5.b. except that no covariate
was used for analysis of the area-under-the-curve estimates for circulating
somatotropin.<P>

<b>Results</b>:<P>

The results for milk production expressed as salable standardized 3.5 &#37; 
fat-corrected milk (SSFCM) and standardized 3.5 &#37;  fat-corrected milk (SFCM) are
summarized in Table 24.  In both primiparous and multiparous cows, IM and SC
administration of sometribove each produced significant increases (18.2 to
27.3 &#37; ) in SSFCM compared with control cows.  There was no statistical
difference in the SSFCM production between the SC or IM routes of
administration. <P>

The results for milk composition analyses are also summarized in Table 24.
Percent milk fat was not significantly changed by sometribove treatment in
primiparous or multiparous cows.  Percent milk protein was slightly but
significantly increased in both parity groups.  Percent lactose was also
increased significantly in multiparous cows but not in primiparous cows.
Although statistically significant, the small increases in these variables were
within normal variation for Holstein cows and not considered to be of
biological importance in terms of milk composition.<P>

In summary, the IM route of administration produced a greater exposure to
circulating somatotropin than did the SC administration.  Therefore, studies in
which the drug was administered IM, including the 14-Day Drug Tolerance Study,
the Multi-Lactation Chronic Animal Toxicity Study, and IM clinical studies,
were valid in providing animal safety data to support SC administration of
sometribove.  Effectiveness, as measured by SSFCM yield, was not significantly
different between the two injection routes and superior to controls.  However,
due to the greater exposure to the drug when administered IM, only pivotal
studies in which the drug was administered SC were used to provide
effectiveness data. <P>

Production</title></head><body>
<h2>FDA BACKGROUNDER</h2>
<b>Current and Useful Information from the Food and Drug Administration</b> 
<h3>New Animal Drug For Increasing Milk
Production</h3>
Milk.  It's been a staple for ages among children, adolescents and adults.
We're told milk helps build strong teeth and bones and healthy bodies.<p>
To increase milk production in cows, scientists have found a way to produce
bovine somatotrophin (bST) through recombinant DNA technology (genetic
engineering).  Recombinant bST is virtually identical to a cow's natural
somatotrophin, a hormone produced in its pituitary gland that stimulates milk
production.  Injecting recombinant bST can increase a cow's milk production by
10 to 15 percent.<p>
Monsanto Co., St. Louis, Mo., is the first firm to have its bST product, called
sometribove, approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration.
Monsanto's bST product, approved Nov. 5, 1993, will be marketing under the
trade name Posilac.<p>
"This has been none of the most extensively studies animal drug products to be
reviewed by the agency," said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D.  "We
examined more than 120 studies.  There were several advisory committees.  The
public can be confident that milk and meat from bST-treated cows is safe to
consume."<p>
FDA is still reviewing bST products from American Cyanamid, Eli Lilly &amp;
Company, and Upjohn Company.  "Each of the remaining products will be reviewed
as stringently as the first," said Suzanne Sechen, Ph.D., an animal scientist
in FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine's division of production drugs.<p>
Recombinant bST is made in much the same way as synthetic human insulin for
treating diabetes.  The gene for bST is inserted into special bacteria, which
then reproduce, replicating the gene.  During manufacture, the bST is collected
from these bacteria and further processed.  The finished, sterile product is
then formulated for use in dairy cows.<p>
<b>FDA Review</b><p>
Recombinant bST first came under FDA review in the early 1980's, when the four
companies submitted investigational new animal drug applications.  Since that
time, the agency has authorized bST testing on more than 20,000 cows in the
United States.<p>
During FDA's review of bST, there has been much public debate on safety and
economic issues related to the drug.<p>
Some organizations  opposed to the use of bST have contended that it causes
health problems for cows injected with the drug, for their calves, and for
humans who consume milk or meat from these animals. <p>
"We went to unprecedented lengths to allay those fears," said Richard Teske,
D.V.M., acting director of FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, "not only
through our own rigorous review process, but also by subjecting our finding to
peer review through a published journal article and by an outside committee of
experts."<p>
The agency's conclusion that recombinant bST poses no risk to human health has
been affirmed by scientific reviews in the past several years conducted by the
National Institutes of Health; the Congressional Office of Technology
Assessment; drug regulatory agencies of Canada, the United Kingdom, and the
European Economic  Community; and by the Health and Human Services Office of
Inspector General.<p>
<b>FDA's Findings</b><p>
Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, FDA is responsible for
ensuring the safety to humans of the milk, meat and other food products from
bST-treated  cows, as well as the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the
animals.  It also must ensure that the manufacture and use of the product does
not pose environmental hazards.<p>
FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine determined in the mid-1980's  that food
products from bST-treated cows are safe for human consumption.  In the Aug.
24, 1990, issue of <i>Science</i>, FDA scientists summarized more than 120
studies that examined the safety of milk and meat from dairy cows treated with
bST.  From these studies, FDA concluded that use of bST presents "no increased
health risk to consumers."<p>
"We found bST to not represent any human health risks when used in dairy cattle
according to the approved labeling," said Teske.<p>
The agency's determination was based on a number of scientific findings.
Because it is a protein-based hormone, bST is broken down during digestion,
which renders it biologically inactive and incapable of having any effect in
humans or animals.  Even if injected in humans, bST has no effect, according to
studies done in the 1950's, which looked at natural bST as a possible treatment
for human dwarfism.  (It didn't work.)<p>
In addition, studies show that pasteurization destroys approximately 90 percent
of bST, natural or otherwise, that is present in milk.<p>
Also, studies have shown that recombinant bST does not affect the nutritional
qualities of milk.  Scientists are unable to detect a difference between milk
from bST-treated cows and from untreated cows.<p>
Summing up the public health issues surrounding bST, Kessler said, "there is
virtually no difference in milk from treated and untreated cows.  In fact, it's
not possible using current scientific techniques to tell them apart.  We have
looked carefully at every single question raised, and we are confident this
product is safe for consumers, for cows, and for the environment."<p>
<p>
<b>NIH Review</b> <p>
In 1990, a special panel of the National Institutes of Health also looked at
recombinant bST. Its members unanimously concluded that bST is effective in
increasing milk production and that the composition and nutritional value of
the milk from the treated cows are essentially the same as from untreated cows.
The panel also found that the meat and milk from the bST-treated herds
in the United States were as safe to consumers as those from untreated
cows.<p>
In addition, the panel found that well-managed, bST-treated cows  experienced
no  greater health problems than  untreated cows of equal production and that
calves from cows administered bST have normal birth weights, growth, and
development.<p>
FDA also reviewed scientific data to see how recombinant bST affects cows. It
concluded that bST causes no serious or long-term health effects in treated
cows or their offspring.<p>
However, FDA found evidence in the clinical trial data submitted by Monsanto
that sometribove-treated have a slightly increased  incidence of
mastitis , a common infection of a cow's udder. A September 1992  by the
Accounting Office raised concerns that antibiotic treatment  for mastitis could
lead to increased antibiotic residues in milk or meat. This could pose a
potential health problem-for example, to people who are allergic to the
antibiotics.<p>
In March 1993, an FDA advisory committee met to  discuss these concerns. The
committee  concluded that adequate safeguards are in place to prevent unsafe
levels of antibiotic residues from entering the milk supply.<p>
<p>
<b>Ensuring Milk Safety</b><p>
Drugs such as antibiotics are to be used in food-producing animals only
under approved conditions and with appropriate withdrawal periods, as
established by FDA,  to ensure that the food is safe for people to eat.<p>
FDA samples meat and milk to make sure unsafe drug residues are not present.  
Milk safety also is ensured by the National Conference on Interstate Milk
Shipments, an organization of federal health officials, state health and
agricultural regulators, and members  of the dairy industry. The conference
oversees a Voluntary Cooperative State-Public Health Service Program for
Certification of Interstate Milk Shippers (IMS) to administer  milk safety
rules. Responsibilities under this program are divided between state agencies
and FDA.<p>
The states are the primary operators of the IMS program, with FDA providing
scientific, technical and inspection  assistance. All 50 states and the
District of Columbia participate in IMS, and nearly 150,000 dairy farms and 800
milk plants, representing almost 90 percent of the total milk production in the
United  States, are covered .<p>
In addition, the dairy industry currently tests every tanker truck of milk for
penicillin-like beta-lactum drugs  before processing. Beta-lactum are the most
commonly used drugs for treating  mastitis.<p>
Milk found to have unsafe residues must  be discarded and producers responsible
for unsafe residues are subject to regulatory sanctions.<p>
Because of all these safeguards, FDA was able to conclude that the increased
risk to human health posed  by mastitis and the resulting use of antibiotics is
insignificant and manageable. Said Teske: "As long as the drugs for treating
mastitis are administered properly, there shouldn't be any problems  with
residues in the milk or meat."<p>
Nevertheless, Monsanto has agreed to take additional steps to ensure
that bST use  does not lead to an increase in  antibiotic residue  levels.<p>
"In addition to all of the studies, and the current nationwide milk monitoring
system, we have put in place an extensive post-approval marketing program that
will assure that food products from bST-treated cows meet the high of safety
required by our statute and demanded by the public," Kessler said.<p>
Monsanto will conduct a post-approval monitoring program that includes the
following elements:<ul>
<li> a two-year tracking system of milk production and drug residues in 21 top
dairy states that will periodically compare  the amount of milk discarded after
sometribove is marketed  to the amount discarded prior to approval 
<li>  a 12-month comparison of the proportion of milk discarded due to positive
drug tests between sometribove treated and untreated herds 
<li> a reporting  system to monitor all sometribove use and follow-up on all
complaints
<li> selection of a sample of 24 commercial dairy herds, using  sometibove to be
specifically  monitored for mastitis drug use, and the resulting loss of
milk.</ul>
Labeling of milk and other foods from bST-treated cows was another issue FDA
considered during its review. In May, the  agency's food and veterinary
medicine advisory committee met for two days to discuss labeling. Based on the
committee members' conclusions, and on its own review, FDA concluded
that it lacks a basis under the stature to require  special labeling of foods
from bST-treated cows. Food companies may voluntarily label their products as
long  as the labeling is truthful and not misleading.<p>

<b>Economic Concerns</b> <p>
During the years recombinant bST has been under review, organizations also have
publicly expressed their concern about potential  economic effects of bST on
small dairy farmers and the federal dairy price support program. <p>
Those groups have contended that since bST increases milk production there
would be more milk on the market. The groups say that more milk would drive
small, family dairy farmers out of business because they could not compete
with big farms when milk prices are lower and would also drive up the cost of
the dairy support program.<p>
Economic issues, by law, are not part of FDA's drug approval decision-making
process and therefore were  not considered. However, Congress included a
90-day moratorium on the sale of bST in its budget reconciliation bill which
President Clinton signed on Aug. 10. 1993. During the 90-day period, the Office
of Management and Budget will address the economic concerns.<p>

<H3>Tracers in Animal Feed</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.01)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
There have been inquiries about the use of reduced iron coated with color,
as a "tracer" in animal feed, without declaring its presence on the label.  The
purpose of the "tracer" in this instance is to provide a quick method to help
assure that the drug component containing the tracer is present in the Type A
medicated article, and that when formulated into a finished feed, it has been
uniformly mixed.<P>
Regulations in 21 CFR 501.100(a)(3)(ii)(c) exempt from label declaration a
harmless substance added to an animal food for a technical or functional effect
in its processing, where it is present at insignificant levels and has no
technical or functional effect in the finished animal food.  A harmless
inactive ingredient of a Type A medicated article is not required to be
declared on the label under the drug provisions of the Federal, Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act.<P>
Section 512 of the Act requires preclearance of all ingredients in a new
animal drug Type A medicated article by means of an approved new animal drug
application or supplement.  *Inclusion of tracers in Type A medicated articles
does not fall under 21 CFR 514.8(a)(5) (changes which may be placed in effect
without the approval of a supplemental NADA).  Similarly, it does not fall
under 21 CFR 514.8(d)(3) (changes that should be placed into effect at the
earliest possible time because they give increased assurance of identity,
strength, quality and purity).*<P>
POLICY:<P>
A harmless substance, such as reduced iron colored with a permitted FDC
color, present at insignificant levels in a medicated or non-medicated animal
feed as a tracer to help assure the presence of and thorough mixing of a
component, is exempt under 21 CFR 501.100(a)(3)(ii)(c) from the requirement
that its presence be declared on the label of the finished feed. Such a tracer
is not considered to have a technical or functional effect on the finished
feed. <P>
A harmless tracer used in a Type A medicated article to help assure

<H3>Availability of Bulk Chemicals for Animal Drug Use</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.20)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
There are a number of firms engaged in the importation or domestic
distribution of bulk drug and chemical substances for teaching, law enforcement
or research uses.  These are exempted from the requirement for adequate
directions for use by 21 CFR 201.125.  Problems have arisen and regulatory
actions have been taken recently in cases where a firm was using this type bulk
drug/chemical substance for the manufacture of unapproved new animal drugs or
was advertising the products for unqualified uses in the animal drug and feed
trade. <P>
Questions also arise concerning the intended use of the product (see 21 CFR
201.128) and whether there is an approved or otherwise valid use in the animal
drug and feed trade. <P>
POLICY: <P>
When chemical substances are promoted for animal drug or feed use they are
brought under the jurisdiction of the Act.<P>
When a bulk chemical has a bonafide use in human or animal medicine not
requiring approval, it may be shipped domestically or imported for that use
provided it is not offered or intended for an unapproved use.<P>
Where the intended use of a bulk chemical substance makes it a new animal
drug it must be covered by an approved NADA or INAD.  The intended use may be
determined by labeling, advertising, promotion, or previous mode of sale or by
the definition found in 21 CFR 201.128.  If there is no approved NADA or INAD
it is adulterated within the meaning of Section 501(a)(5) in that it is unsafe
within the meaning of Section 512.<P>

<H3>Diversion of Contaminated Food for Animal Use</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.05)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
FDA does not object to the diversion to animal feed of human food
adulterated with rodent, roach, or bird excreta.  However, since rodent, roach,
or bird excreta are vectors for microorganisms deleterious to the health of
animals, including such things as parasite eggs, salmonella, leptospira, or
other pathogenic organisms, diversion has not been authorized except following
a heat treatment appropriate to destroy such organisms.<P>
POLICY:<P>
Diversion of rodent, roach, or bird contaminated food for animal feed use,
whether pursuant to a court order or a voluntary action, requires heat
treatment to destroy pathogenic organisms.  The *Center for* Veterinary
Medicine (HFV-236) should be contacted on a case-by-case basis concerning
suitability of proposed treatment, whether pursuant to a court order or a
voluntary action.<P>

<H3>Adequate Directions for Use (Species Designation) - Animal Drugs and
Veterinary Devices</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.24)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
The effects of drugs and medical treatment of animals may vary from drug to
drug and from species to species due to physiological and other species
differences.  In addition, the effectiveness of the drug and use of a medical
device may be expected to vary within a species due to the sex of the animal or
to significant differences in age, weight, size, etc.  *Further*, it may be
necessaryto have directions for use of the drug and medical device in
subspecies or varieties of animals *or even in wider taxonomic groupings* for
the labeling to be adequate.<P>
The *Center for* Veterinary Medicine requires species specific labeling for
*each new animal drug and feed containing a new drug to be submitted for
approval prior to marketing.  Medical device labeling may not be false or
misleading and must be adequately labeled for the intended use(s).  However, at
the present there is no specific regulation reflecting these
requirements.*<P>
POLICY:<P>
Animal drug (including medicated feed) and veterinary device labeling *is*
in violation of Section 502(f) of the Act if it fails to *identify the target
species or* bear directions for use which are adequate for each target *animal
group* for which it is intended.<P>

<body>
CVM UPDATE
<P> Center for Veterinary Medicine<br>
Issued by: Office of Management, Communications and Education Branch, HFV-12 Food
and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville, MD 20855<br>
 (301) 594-1755<br>
FAX (301) 594-1831 <p><b>FDA
APPROVES FOOD ADDITIVE PETITION FOR FORMALDEHYDE</b><P>
In the April 9, 1996 <b>Federal Register</b>, FDA announced that the Agency is
amending the food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of
formaldehyde (37 percent aqueous solution), at the rate of 5.4 pounds per ton
(2.5 kilograms per ton) as an antimicrobial food additive for maintaining
complete poultry feeds salmonella negative for up to 14 days.  This action is
in response to a food additive petition filed by Anitox Corp, Buford,
Georgia.<P>
Salmonella is known to cause animal disease.  The effect of subclinical cases
of salmonella on animal production is difficult to quantitate.  However, there
are circumstantial data suggesting a potential link between the organisms in
feed and organisms causing human and animal salmonellosis.  For this reason in
1990, FDA announced a salmonella negative goal for animal feed and feed
ingredients.<P>
The availability of compounds that can control re-contamination of a feed with
salmonella is important to achieving the goal of salmonella negative for animal
feed and feed ingredients.  In the September 28, 1995 <b>Federal Register</b>,
FDA defined salmonella negative as 10 samples, from a production lot, testing
negative for salmonella using the culture procedure described in the 7th
Edition of FDA's Bacteriological Analytical Manual.  <P>
FDA has evaluated the data in the food additive petition for formaldehyde and
other relevant material.  The Agency concluded that formaldehyde (37 percent
aqueous solution) is safe when used at the rate of 5.4 pounds (2.5 kilograms)
per ton of poultry feed, and that the regulations should be amended in Title
21, Part 573.460.<P>
Additional information on this food additive approval is available in the
<b>Federal Register</b> announcement or by contacting Dr. Daniel G. McChesney,
Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV-222), Food and Drug Administration, 7500
Standish Place, Rockville, MD 20855, 301-594-1728.  Any person who will be
adversely affected by this regulation may file written objections on or before
May 9, 1996, with the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug
Administration, Room 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, MD 20857.<P>

<H3>Refusals of Formula Information During Inspection of Feed Mills
Manufacturing Feeds Requiring Approved Medicated Feed Applications</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.16)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
Composition information is essential to establish whether medicated feeds
are being manufactured in compliance with medicated feed application approvals,
the requirements of applicable regulations, or if they are otherwise
adulterated or misbranded.<P>
Feed mills have occasionally refused to allow review or copying of formulae
or batch assay records for feeds containing new animal drugs subject to
medicated feed application approval, contending that the quantities of non-drug
ingredients are trade secrets or that Section 704 of the Act does not provide
authority to inspect formulae of medicated feeds.  Manufacturers are required
to submit a quantitative statement of the active ingredient(s) but only a
qualitative listing of the non-drug ingredients as part of their medicated feed
application.<P>
FDA's authority to inspect both quantitative and qualitative formulae of
medicated feeds is based on Section 512(m)(5) of the Act.  The medicated feed
CGMP's (21 CFR 255.102) require the Master Record File to contain qualitative
and quantitative information for each drug and non-drug ingredient.<P>
It is essential that qualitative information be obtained to determine
whether the ingredients are generally recognized as safe and suitable for
animal feed use.  In this regard the regulations may prohibit the use of
certain non-drug ingredients.  For example, bentonite may not be used in
medicated feeds containing amprolium.  Also, the regulations require the
labeling of feeds containing certain food additives to bear warnings, cautions,
or other information should certain ingredients be used (e.g., ammoniated rice
hulls).<P>
On the other hand, quantitative information on some non-drug ingredients
may be essential to determine compliance with limitations specified in the
regulations for certain ingredients (e.g., menadione dimethylpyrimidinol
bisulfite).  Quantitative information is always necessary for active drug
ingredients to determine whether the finished product is formulated to conform
with the permitted levels specified in the regulations and with the approved
medicated feed application.<P>
POLICY:<P>
Refusals of the following information by medicated feed manufacturers
warrant consideration of administrative/regulatory follow-up:<P>
1.   Quantitative composition of active drug ingredients. <P>
2. Quantitative composition of non-drug ingredients when such information
is essential for a determination as to compliance with a limitation established
by regulation. <P>
3. Qualitative composition of all other non-drug ingredients. <P>

<H3>*Drugs for Odor Control and Conception in Pet Animals* </H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.11)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
The Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is aware of products on the market
intended for use primarily in companion animals, such as dogs and cats and
other small animals, for the control of body odors. Labeling representations
range from the complete control of breath and body odors generally, to the
masking or prevention of estrus odors, and to direct claims for prevention of
mating or conception. Chlorophyll, antibiotics such as chlortetracycline, and
other drugs, have been included as active ingredients. <P>
We believe that products, including products with known drug properties
such as antibiotics, intended for systemic use in animals to prevent body odors
or conception are drugs because they meet the definition in 201(g)(1)(C) and/or
201(g)(1)(A). In the absence of expert recognition, supported by scientific
data establishing that any of these claims are valid, the products are new
animal drugs. * * Topically applied products that contain ingredients with
known drug properties, such as antibiotics, may be new animal drugs for the
same reason when indicated for the control of odor or conception. <P>
On the other hand, CVM believes that topically applied chlorophyll-based
products intended merely to mask or control odors constitute animal cosmetics
(grooming aids) which are not regulated by the statute since the definition of
cosmetics in Section 201(i) pertains only to human use products. <P>
POLICY:<P>
Chlorophyll-based products for systemic use constitute a low order of
regulatory priority, provided that claims are limited to masking, suppressing,
or controlling body odor in animals, and safety concerns are not involved. CVM
places a higher priority on regulatory action under Section 501(a)(5) against
systemic chlorophyll products where the labeling contains direct claims for
contraceptive use. <P>
Antibiotics or other drug components promoted for suppression, masking or
control of animal body odor also have a higher priority for regulatory action
under Section 501(a)(5). *  * <P>
REGULATORY ACTION GUIDANCE: <P>
Regulatory action against chlorophyll-based animal drugs labeled merely for
the masking, suppression, or control of animal body odors has a low regulatory
priority. However, new animal drug charges may be recommended against such
products where the labeling contains direct representation to prevent
conception. Other unsubstantiated claims should be reviewed by the Center
before regulatory action is recommended. <P>
Regulatory action, based on Section 501(a)(5), will be considered where
antibiotics, or any drug components other than chlorophyll, are distributed
with indications for use for the masking, suppression, or control of animal
body odors.<P>

<H3>CVM GUIDELINES and <a href="#guidance">GUIDANCE</A></H3>
<P>
Guidance documents are similar to guidelines in that they attempt to assist the public
 by providing information useful when interacting with CVM<P>
Guidelines reflect principles commonly recognized by the scientific
community as appropriate and necessary for collecting scientific data. A person
may follow a guideline or may choose alternate procedures. The person choosing
to use alternate procedures should discuss them with the agency to prevent an
expenditure of money, effort, and time on activities that may later be deemed
unacceptable to CVM. A guideline does not bind the agency and it does not
create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits for or on any person.
Where a guideline states a requirement imposed by statute or regulation,
however, the requirement is law and must be followed.<P>
A listing of these documents follows with links to selected documents that are 
currently on line. More will be added - ordering information for all 
documents may be found at the bottom of this page.

<H3>Unsafe Contamination of Animal Feed from Drug Carryover</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.29)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
The *Center for* Veterinary Medicine has long been aware of the phenomenon
of so-called "cross-contamination" of feed with low levels of drugs during
manufacture of medicated animal feeds.  This carryover may occur as a result of
utilizing equipment common to the manufacture of both medicated and
non-medicated feed.  It may be due to design and construction of the equipment,
poor dust control, or inadequate clean- out procedures between sequential
batches of feed.  From inspectional experience, however, it is apparent that
even in the best constructed and managed feed mill the complete elimination of
all batch to batch carryover is not a practical possibility given the realities
of feed manufacturing.  The Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations
(CGMPRs) recognize this by requiring adequate clean-out procedures so as to
"avoid" excessive drug carryover and prevent what is termed "unsafe"
contamination. <P>
Where drug carryover from the manufacture of medicated feed results in
unsafe contamination in other feeds, it constitutes a violation of the good
manufacturing practice regulations (21 CFR *).  The feeds are adulterated
within the meaning of 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act.  The adulteration of
non-medicated feed with unsafe contamination is likewise a violation of GMPRs
(21 CFR **).<P>
Our interpretation of the CGMPRs is that in each and every instance where
the mill clean-out procedures or other manufacturing practices are such that
carryover is suspected, it is our burden to prove that the contamination is
"unsafe . . .".  To do this requires inspectional and analytical information as
to the immediate cause and responsibility for the carryover and an analysis by
veterinarians and toxicologists not only as to the safety of the carryover
residues to the animal for whom the feed is intended but in the case of
food-producing animals, whether the meat, milk, or eggs may be expected to
contain tissue residues <br>
hazardous for humans.  <P>
At the present time we are preparing a proposal concerning this
problem for publication in the <i>Federal Register</i>.  This will announce
requirements for data to provide a basis for establishing safe tolerances for
drug carryover in animal feed.  It will also require submission of methodology
sufficient to determine low level carryover residues in animal feed.
Completion of the task will require some years. <P>
The document will propose establishing several classes or groups of drugs
ranging from, on the one hand, those for which we have data to establish the
safety of drug carryover at the lowest established use level to, on the other
hand, those which are suspect or known carcinogens or which exhibit special
toxicological properties.  In between will be other classes of drugs for which
a carryover level can be tolerated with the level being set at a point where
the data establishes that it will be safe. <P>
POLICY: <P>
Pending promulgation of a regulation defining "unsafe" contamination
and setting forth tolerances for drug carryover in a feed as a result of feed
mill manufacturing procedures, inspectional effort will be concentrated in the
area of drug carryover contamination by those drugs exhibiting carcinogenic or
other special toxicological properties.  These have been tentatively identified
as including: <P>
   Carbadox <br>
   Chlormadinone Acetate <br>
   Diethylstilbestrol                  <br>
   Dimetridazole                       <br>
   3, 5-Dinitrobenzamide               <br>
   Furazolidone <br>
   Ipronidazole <br>
   Melengestrol Acetate <br>
   Nihydrazone <br>
   Nitrofurazone <P>
Carryover of drugs not in the above group may be unsafe if the level
of carryover is sufficient: Therefore, good manufacturing practice
requires they also be controlled. <P>
In addition to formal regulatory action, withholding and/or
withdrawal of approval for new animal drug applications *(FD-1900s)* for
medicated feeds will be considered when levels of contamination are more than
"de minimus," and constitute a hazard to animal or human health. <P>

PRODUCTS</title></head><body>
<h3>U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION</H3>
 Position Paper <br>
<H2>ANIMAL USE IN TESTING FDA-REGULATED PRODUCTS</H2>
 
 
Current laws administered by FDA --including the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic (FD&amp;C) Act -- are intended to ensure product safety and
effectiveness, thereby protecting consumers' health. These laws place
responsibility on FDA to ensure that human and animal drugs, biologics and
medical devices are safe and effective and that food products are safe and
wholesome.<P>
Animal testing by manufacturers seeking to market new products is often necessary
to establish product safety. FDA supports and adheres to the provisions of
applicable laws, regulations, and policies governing animal testing, including
the Animal Welfare Act and the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals. Moreover, in all cases where animal testing is used,
FDA advocates that research and testing derive the maximum amount of useful
scientific information from the minimum number of animals and employ the most
humane methods available within the limits of scientific capability.<P>
FDA advocates the use of validated non-whole animal techniques, which may
include such screens and adjuncts as <I>in vitro </I>&#160;(e.g., tissue culture)
methodologies and biochemical assays. As an example, FDA announced in the
<I>Federal Register </I>&#160;of Feb. 19, 1988, the availability of guidelines for
the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) test as an end-product endotoxin test for
human injectable drugs (including biological products), animal injectable drugs
and medical devices. The guidelines inform manufacturers of acceptable methods
of validating the LAL test so that it can be used as an alternative to the
rabbit pyrogen test. At present many other procedures intended to refine,
reduce or replace animal testing are still in the relatively early stages of
development. FDA encourages all efforts to develop and implement non-animal
models and believes that these procedures will ultimately result in significant
reductions and refinements in animal testing.<P>
 With respect to cosmetic products, the FD&amp;C Act does not specifically
require that cosmetic manufacturers test their products for safety in the
context of premarket approval by the Agency. However, FDA strongly urges
cosmetic manufacturers to conduct toxicological or other tests necessary to
substantiate the safety of a particular cosmetic product. If the safety of a
cosmetic product is not adequately substantiated, the product is considered
misbranded and may be subject to regulatory action unless the principal display
panel bears the statement, "Warning--the safety of this product has not been
determined."<P>
Much of the attention given to animal testing has focused on the LD50 test and
the Draize eye and skin irritancy tests. FDA does not require LD50 test data to
establish levels of toxicity, and in 1988, published a policy statement in the
<I>Federal Register </I>&#160;to clarify this position.<P>
The Draize eye and skin irritancy tests continue to be considered among the
most reliable methods currently available for evaluating the safety of a
substance introduced into or around the eye or placed on the skin. Non-animal
tests, such as <I>in vitro </I>&#160;tests, may be useful as screening tools to
indicate the relative toxicity or safety of a substance that comes into contact
with the eye or skin. However, the responses and results of <I>in vitro
</I>&#160;tests alone do not necessarily demonstrate the safety of a substance. The
effects of a substance on a biochemical reaction or on a specific cell or
tissue in culture may differ from its effect on a specific organ system in the
animal as a whole.<P>
The precise nature of testing needed to determine the safety or effectiveness
of a specific product regulated by FDA depends upon the characteristics and
intended use of the product. More specific guidance may be obtained through
consultation with FDA scientists on a case-by-case basis.<P>

<H3>Chloramphenicol as an Unapproved New Animal Drug - Direct Reference Seizure
Authority</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.33)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
Chloramphenicol is a potent, broad spectrum antibiotic drug.  The drug,
when used in humans, is associated with many toxic effects and, therefore,is
used only in life-threatening situations when less toxic drugs are not
effective.  The principal toxic effect is the development of a type of bone
marrow depression (aplastic anemia) in susceptible individuals, which is
usually irreversible and fatal.  Since this condition only occurs in humans, an
appropriate animal test model has never been developed.  The onset of the
condition is not dose dependent. <P>
Chloramphenicol in various dosage forms is currently approved for use in
non-food producing animals (dogs and cats) as codified in 21 CFR Part 520-529.
The new animal drug applications (NADAs) for the oral solution form of
chloramphenicol were revoked because of widespread illegal use in food animals.
See 51 FR 1367 and 51 FR 1441 (January 13, 1986).  The current labeling for the
approved chloramphenicol products bears a specific warning statement that the
drug is not to be used in animals raised for food production. <P>
*Chloramphenicol, for animal use, is a new animal drug.  The drug must be
the subject of an approved NADA for legal commercial marketing.  In addition,
chlorampenicol is a veterinary prescription drug and must be used by or under
the direction of a licensed veterinarian.  The drug must be handled in
accordance with the requirements of Section 503(f) of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act and 21 CFR 201.105 to meet the exemption from bearing adequate
directions for use.*<P>
REGULATORY ACTION GUIDANCE:<P>
Direct reference seizure of chloramphenicol products, which are unapproved
new animal drugs, may be submitted by district offices to the Office of the
General Counsel through the Division of Case Management and Operations
(HFC-210), provided the following criteria are met:<P>
1.   The drug contains chloramphenicol and is labeled for use in food
producing animals;<P>
2.   The drug contains chloramphenicol and is labeled for use in dogs
and/or cats, however, its intended use as determined by the method of sale or
promotion, is for food producing animals and the intended use in food producing
animals is well documented by investigator observations, treatment records,
and/or determination of chloramphenicol residues in treated animals;<P>
                     or<P>
3.   The drug contains chloramphenicol and it is intended for an unapproved
use in animals, or for the manufacturing of animal drugs, which are not
approved, and no approved NADA exists for the drug sampled, as determined by
consultation with CVM, Case Guidance Branch (HFV-236).<P>
Remarks<P>
1.   Determine by analysis or label statement that the product contains
chloramphenicol.<P>
2.   If the drug is in bulk containers not bearing directions for use in
animals, for direct reference seizure intended use must be clearly documented
to support use in animals or to manufacture an unapproved drug.<P>
3.   Interstate origin of the drug or its components must be well
documented.<br>Specimen Charge <P>
*Article was adulterated when introduced and while in interstate commerce
and is adulterated while held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce,
within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5), in that the article is a "new animal
drug" within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. 321(v)(1), which is unsafe within the
meaning of 21 U.S.C. 360b(a)(1)(A) since no approval of an application filed
pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 360b(b) is in effect with respect to its use or intended
use.* <P>

<H3>Drugs Packaged for Infusion or Injection of Food-Producing Animals</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.39)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
CVM has received several complaints about products labeled for oral,
topical, or other routes of administration that are packaged in a manner
customarily considered to be for parenteral administration.  Among the products
packaged in this manner are aloe vera products labeled for topical use in
shurjet/squeeze jets (squeeze tubes with long tips that are routinely used for
intramammary infusion); probiotic products labeled for oral use packaged in
syringes with sterile diluent in plastic vials with udder infusion canulas
and alcohol pads; and selenium vitamin E and other vitamin/mineral products
labeled for oral use packaged in sterile vials closed with a metal ring and
rubber injection stopper.<P>
CVM is very concerned about the safety of products not approved for
parenteral use which are infused or injected into food-producing animals.  The
health consequences associated with this practice are potentially serious for
both the animal and humans consuming milk or meat from animals treated with
these products.  Oral products, particularly those labeled for food use, are
not ordinarily prepared under the same stringent controls as those products
intended for parenteral drug use.  Also, the residue depletion curve for
parenterals is likely to be altogether different than that for oral or topical
use.<P>
CVM believes that the packaging and labeling of these products is a
subterfuge to avoid the more stringent regulatory requirements for parenteral
drugs.  It is not economically or scientifically rational for any oral or
topical products to be packaged in sterile containers such as injection seal
closure vials or with associated devices such as cannulas and injection
syringes.  The intended use of these products is for parenteral administration
not withstanding the labeled directions and/or indications.  These products are
therefore drugs under &szlig;201(g) of the Act and are subject to all the
applicable requirements of the Act.<P>
POLICY:<P>
Products that are intended for oral or topical administration should not be
packaged to facilitate parenteral administration.  Products intended to be
administered to food-producing animals, packaged in a manner that suggests
parenteral administration, but labeled for oral, topical or other routes of
administration, will be considered by FDA to be drugs intended for parenteral
administration.  If these products do not bear adequate directions for
parenteral administration, they will be deemed misbranded within the meaning of
&szlig;502(f)(1) and/or &szlig;502(i)(1).<P>
REGULATORY ACTION GUIDANCE:<P>
A warning letter should be recommended to HFV-236 for commercial animal
products labeled for oral, topical, or other routes of administration, but
packaged in a manner considered to be suitable for infusion or injection in
food animals.  If such products are packaged for non-food animal use, Case
Guidance Branch (HFV-236) should be contacted for guidance. <P>

<H3>Human-Labeled Drugs Distributed and Used in Animal Medicine</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.35)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
* This Compliance Policy Guide explains how FDA will exercise its
enforcement discretion with respect to distribution and use of human-labeled
drug products for use in animals.  It is FDA's  intent to:<P>
-  eliminate promotion by manufacturers, distributors, and
pharmacies;<P>
-  ensure that distribution and dispensing are made only in response to
requests by veterinary practitioners (practitioner driven);<P>
-  refrain in ordinary circumstances from enforcement actions when human
drugs are used or dispensed by veterinarians in treating non-food-producing
animals;<P>
-   take enforcement action against veterinarians who cause illegal
residues in food-producing animals;<P>
-   limit use of human-labeled drugs in treating food-producing animals to
very narrow circumstances; and<P>
-   prohibit use except by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian in
the course of his or her practice.<P>
The key regulatory elements under this policy are determination of whether
or not (1) the distribution and dispensing are practitioner driven and (2) the
veterinary practitioners limit their uses of human-labeled drug products to
treating non-food animals, with certain narrow exceptions.  Since distribution
and dispensing are to be veterinary practitioner driven, and since distributors
and pharmacists, after properly distributing the drug, ordinarily cannot
control end uses, this policy places primary responsibility on the
veterinarian. This policy is not intended to permit the distribution of
human-labeled drug products to veterinarians where prohibited or limited by
state laws.<P>
FDA is aware that human-labeled drug products have been promoted and
distributed by manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies for use in animals
and that such drugs are being prescribed, dispensed, and administered by
veterinarians for animal use.<P>
Promotion of human-labeled drug products for veterinary use by these
sources has included acts such as advertising animal use in veterinary
publications; distribution of labeling and promotional materials suggesting or
recommending use of these products in animals; or oral statements from sales
personnel describing or recommending use in animals.  Such promotion causes the
drugs to be misbranded under Section 502(f)(1), or adulterated new animal drugs
under Section 501(a)(5), or both.  Furthermore, such promotion may subvert the
new animal drug approval process by creating a disincentive for drug
manufacturers to seek such approvals.<P>
Most veterinary use of human-labeled drug products occurs in non-food
animal practice (companion, sporting, exotic, etc.).  Many of the maladies of
pets and other non-food animals cannot be treated in accordance with current
standards of veterinary practice without the use of human-labeled drugs since
appropriate drug products bearing veterinary labeling often do not exist.
Because of this, FDA has generally refrained from taking enforcement actions in
this area because there is no expected adverse impact upon the public health.
 <P>
FDA is very concerned about the use of human-labeled drugs in
food-producing animals because of the increased potential for illegal drug
residues in meat, milk, and eggs.  Human-labeled drug products have not, among
other things, undergone testing for residue depletion from edible tissues.
Appropriate withdrawal times to avoid illegal residues in food can only be
estimated.<P>
Nevertheless, there are legitimate and important veterinary needs for
human-labeled drugs in the treatment of disease or to prevent pain in
food-producing animals in instances where there simply are no animal drug
products available that would avoid animal suffering or death.  Examples
include, but are not necessarily limited to analgesics and anesthetics for
pain, sedation, surgery, insulin for ketosis, and antidotes for
poisonings.<P>
POLICY:<P>
A.  Distribution and Dispensing<P>
Labeling, advertising, oral representations, or any other act by a
manufacturer, distributor, or pharmacy which establishes an intended use of
human-labeled drugs for animal use is subject to regulatory action.  However,
the simple listing of human-labeled drug products in price sheets and
catalogues distributed to veterinarians will not ordinarily be subject to such
action.  Dispensing pharmacists are required by Section 503(f) to label
dispensed drugs in accordance with the prescribing veterinarian's instructions,
including the name and address of the dispenser, the serial number and date of
the order or of its filing, the name of the licensed veterinarian, and
directions for use and any cautionary statements. Providing this information
does not constitute promotion against which the agency is prepared to take
action.<P>
High priority will be placed on actions against manufacturers,
distributors, and pharmacies who promote the substitution of human-labeled drug
products for animal drugs for economic reasons.<P>
B.  Use of human drugs by veterinarians in professional practice<P>
(i)  Use in non-food-producing animals; e.g., dogs, cats, horses<P>
Under usual circumstances, veterinary practitioners may consider the use of
human-labeled drug products in non-food producing animal practice without the
threat of FDA enforcement actions. In rare circumstances, for example, when the
health of the treated animals is harmed, regulatory attention by FDA would be
considered or, preferably, referred to the State veterinary licensing authority
for investigation.<P>
(ii) Use in food-producing animals; e.g., cattle, swine, poultry<P>
Use of human-labeled drug products in food-producing animals should be
extremely limited, primarily because of the increased potential for illegal
drug residues in meat, milk, and and eggs.  For example, it is ordinarily
unacceptable to use a human-labeled product for common disease conditions in
food animals because approved veterinary-labeled drug products; e.g.,
antibacterials, anti-inflammatory agents, etc. are available.  The food animal
veterinarian assumes greater responsibility when he or she uses a human drug
rather than a veterinary drug.  Use of human-labeled drugs may be considered by
food animal veterinarians only when they have:<P>
- made a careful and definitive diagnosis and evaluation of the condition
for which the drug is to be used, and are otherwise operating within the
confines of a veterinarian/client/patient relationship;<P>
- made a deliberate determination that there is no other appropriate
veterinary-labeled therapy; i.e., there is no marketed veterinary labeled drug
product specifically labeled for the disease condition to be treated or the
veterinary drug has been found clinically ineffective by the veterinarian in
the animals to be treated; and<P>
- taken adequate steps to prevent the occurrence of illegal residues in
edible animal products.  This should include a review of the best available
toxicological and tissue distribution and tissue residue depletion data and
establishment of an extra long drug withdrawal period prior to marketing meat,
milk, or eggs.  The animal owner or manager should be given explicit written
withdrawal instructions.  The practitioner should have a high degree of
confidence that the client will follow the drug withdrawal instruction.<P>
Regulatory action should be considered when an illegal residue occurs even
if the veterinarian followed the foregoing precautions.  The enforcement
discretion that might be accorded to veterinarians will not be extended to lay
persons; .g., owners, who administer human-labeled drugs either to
food-producing or nonfood animals without the supervision of a licensed
veterinarian operating within the framework of a valid
veterinarian/client/patient relationship.<P>
Veterinarians are expected to follow cautionary handling and disposal
provisions, if any, specified in human drug labeling to protect handlers and
the environment.<P>
REGULATORY ACTION GUIDANCE:<P>
The highest priority for regulatory attention is for follow-up on reports
of illegal tissue residues from human-labeled drugs.  Follow the instructions
in Compliance Program 7371.006, <i>Illegal Drug Residues in Meat and
Poultry</i> and Compliance Program 7371.008, <i>National Drug Residue Milk
Monitoring Program</i>.  Consultation with Case Guidance Branch for guidance
under this policy is indicated when encountering other suspected violations,
especially where there is substitution of human-labeled drugs for treatment of
common disease conditions in food animals.<P>
The initial enforcement action of choice is ordinarily a Warning Letter.
Center concurrence is<br>
required prior to issuance.  Depending on the circumstances, one or more of
the following charges would be appropriate.<P>
   -  402(a)(2)(D) - food adulterated by illegal residue from a new animal
drug;<P>
   -  402(a)(2)(A) - food adulterated by illegal residue from a
human-labeled drug;<P>
   -  501(a)(5) -  adulterated drug (labeled for human use which is
accompanied by labeling indicating it for animal use which causes it to  be
unsafe under Section 512(a) as an unapproved new animal drug);<P>
   -  502(f)(1) - misbranded human drug when not used as labeled;
misbranded human drug promoted for animal use in ways other than by labeling
(see 21 CFR 201.128).*<P>* Material between asterisks is new or revised. *<P>

<H3>Moisture Damaged Grain</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.10)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
In the past *CVM* has authorized the diversion of moisture-damaged grain as
well as other food materials for animal feed use.  Such authorization has
always had to take into consideration the nature and source of the water since
fires from grain elevator explosions are often quenched using sea water or
river water which may contain sewage, pathogenic organisms, chemical wastes or
other toxic substances.  Similar problems are posed when foodstuff is flooded
following hurricanes or other natural disasters.  Even more serious is the mold
growth which may occur in wet foods.  Certain molds such as <i>Aspergillus
flavus</i> produce aflatoxins which are toxic or carcinogenic to certain
animals including man, and if present in animal feed, can result in the
presence of aflatoxin residues in foods produced by the ingesting
animal.<P>
Authorization of the conversion of moisture-damaged grain to animal feed
use must be made on a case-by-case basis to include consideration whether
actual or suspected pathogenic organisms, chemical pollutants, mold growth and
toxins can be satisfactorily removed or neutralized by one or more of several
procedures available.  The choice of reclamation action must be based upon
knowledge of all of the facts.<P>
POLICY:<P>
Moisture-damaged and/or moldy foodstuffs may be considered for conversion
to animal feed use.  However, in each case authorization will be made by *CVM*
in consultation with *CFSAN* based upon information concerning the nature and
source of the moisture and the actual or suspected type of contamination and
whether the damaged material may be rendered safe for use as animal feed.
*Requests for diversion should follow the procedures outlined in Compliance
Policy Guide 7126.20, "Diversion of Adulterated Human or Animal Food To
Acceptable Animal Feed Use."* <P>
*Material between asterisks is new or revised.*<P>

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES<br>
PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE<br>
FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION<br>
CENTER FOR VETERINARY MEDICINE<br>

<p>

<b>I.   Role of the Food and Drug Administration</b><ol>

<li>    Safeguarding public health. -- We believe the public should not
unknowingly or needlessly be exposed to injurious substances.<p>

<li>    Safeguarding health of treated animals. -- Drugs added to feed should
possess an adequate margin of safety so inadvertent overdosage will not result
in excessive mortality or retardation.</ol><p>

<b>II.  Handling of Investigational Food Animals</b><p>

    <ol><li>Data to support residue safety.<p>
<ul>
 <li>  a.  Toxicity should include a minimum of one subacute study in an appropriate
       laboratory animal.

  <li>  b.  Information available on structure and metabolism of the drug should be
       provided.

  <li>  c.  A residue method--not necessarily adequate for enforcement purposes--should
       demonstrate when tissues are free from residues.

  <li>  d.  A tissue depletion curve is helpful in determining a proper withdrawal
       time.
            
</ul><p>

    <li>    Safety of Drug to Investigational Animals.<p>

        The Division of Toxicological Evaluation serves only in an advisory
capacity.<p>

    <li>    Additional Factors Considered.<p>

    Include type of food involved (eggs, milk, etc.), number of animals, and
general type of drug we are dealing with.<p></ol>

<b>III. Data to Provide Final Regulation</b><p><ol>

<li>    Safety to animal -- Should demonstrate a 3-5 fold margin of
safety.<p>

 <li>Numbers -- Not less than 25-30 birds per test group and at least five
mammals per group.<p>

<li>    Pathology -- Gross autopsy on all test animals.  Histopathology on a
representative number from each test group and sections, to be taken from any
abnormal tissues noted.</ol> <p>

<b>IV.  Safety to Humans</b><p>

A conference should be arranged with the Center for  Food Safety and Applied
Nutrition concerning protocols and data requirements prior to initiating any
studies.<p>

<H3>Uncooked Meat for Animal Food</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.23)</b><P>
BACKGROUND <P>
*CVM is aware of the sale of dead, dying, disabled, or diseased (4-D)
animals to salvagers for use as animal food.  Meat from these carcasses is
boned and the meat is packaged or frozen without heat processing.  The raw,
frozen meat is shipped for use by several industries, including pet food
manufacturers, zoos, greyhound kennels, and minkranches.  This meat may
present a potential healthhazard to the animals that consume it and to
thepeople who handle it.*<P>
POLICY<P>
*Uncooked meat derived from 4-D animals isadulterated under
Section 402(a)(5) of the Act,and its shipment in interstate commerce
for animalfood use is subject to appropriate regulatoryaction.*
<P>
REGULATORY ACTION GUIDANCE<P>
*Districts should conduct preliminaryinvestigations only as
follow-up to complaints orreports of injuries and should contact CVM
beforeexpending substantial resources.  Before thedistricts
recommend regulatory action, they shouldcontact Case Guidance Branch,
HFV-236, foradvice and assistance with case
development.*<P>

<H3>Animal Drugs for Euthanasia</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.17)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
Euthanasia, or painless killing, is widely practiced by veterinarians to
destroy unwanted pets and other animals.  It is accomplished by a variety of
methods one of which involves drug injection.  Pest control is not considered
euthanasia, and the substances used in this practice are usually regulated by
the Environmental Protection Agency. <P>
POLICY: <P>
*CVM* considers products intended for animal euthanasia to conform to the
definition of a drug under section 201(g) of the Act since they are clearly
intended to affect the function of the body by inducing death.  Moreover, with
one exception, namely sodium pentabarbital, *CVM* considers all such products
to be new animal drugs, within the meaning of section 201(w) which may be
legally marketed only after approval of an NADA.  The data must establish that
the product results in a humane and painless death when used as directed.
Euthanasia drugs may be distributed only under the veterinary prescription
legend. <P>

<b>INFORMATION ON PREVALENT TICK-BORNE DISEASES</b><P>
<P>
Among the many tick-borne diseases which are transmitted to man and animals,
three stand out as most prevalent.  Each of these diseases occurs seasonally in
the United States--most incidences occurring in summer and fall.  People and
animals that spend a lot of time outside in wooded areas are most likely to be
affected.<P>
The following symptoms for each disease are common to humans and animals with
minor exceptions.  For example, a rash is not easily found in animals.<P>
<b>Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever</b><P>
This disease is caused by <b>Rickettsia rickettsii</b>, a microorganism which
is usually transmitted by <b>Ixodidae</b> (hard ticks).  The species most
commonly involved are <b>Dermacentor andersoni</b> (wood tick), <b>Dermacentor
variabilis</b> (dog tick), and <b>Amblyomma americanum</b> (Lone-Star tick of
the southern United States, particularly Texas and Louisiana).<P>
Man, dogs and cats, farm animals, and wildlife species are affected.  People
should examine themselves and their pets for ticks after each trip outside.
The onset of symptoms may be abrupt.  Common symptoms are fever, chills, severe
headaches, muscle pains, and a rash.<P>
The mortality rate for Rocky Mountain spotted fever is less than 10 percent if
an antibiotic is started promptly.  Some patients may require supportive
therapies, such as intravenous fluids, steroids, and nasogastric feedings.
Improvement should be rapid (36 to 48 hours).  The exact treatment should be
determined by the animal's veterinarian or, in the case of a human, a personal
physician.<P>
<b>Tick Paralysis</b><P>
This disease is most commonly caused by female hard ticks of the
<b>Dermacentor</b> species.  Both man and animal may be affected; the animals
most affected are dogs, cattle, and sheep.<P>
A flacid paralysis progresses from the back to the front of the affected animal
and is due to a toxin injected when the ticks feed.  Paralysis is most likely
to occur from prolonged feeding and bites located along the spine, neck, or
head in people as well as animals.<P>
Symptoms include anorexia, lethargy, muscle weakness, lack of coordination, and
nystagmus (involuntary, rapid movement of the eyeball).<P>
Bite sites should be cleansed with soap and water.  If bare hands are used to
remove the tick, care must be taken to avoid squeezing as this may inject more
toxin.  Hands should be washed immediately after disposing of the tick.  If the
bite wounds are inflamed or look infected, an antibiotic and steroid ointment
can be applied.  It's a good idea to consult a veterinarian on the proper way
to remove and dispose of ticks on pets.  Never use a lit cigarette or matches
to disengage the tick because of the obvious danger of a serious burn to the
animal.<P>
If respiratory or cardiac arrest has not occurred, removal of the tick(s)
usually leads to rapid and complete recovery.<P>
<b>Lyme Disease</b><P>
This disease, named after the small town of Lyme, Connecticut where a group of
people were initially affected in 1975, is the most prevalent disease
transmitted by ticks in the U.S.  It is caused by a spirochete called
<b>Borrelia burgdorferi</b> and has been reported in wildlife (moose, elk, and
deer), cattle and horses, dogs and cats, and man.  Cases have been diagnosed in
most States with a high incidence along the Eastern seaboard, Wisconsin, and
Minnesota.<P>
The ticks that transmit this disease are very small, the size of sesame seeds
as adults, and in approximately 30 percent of the confirmed cases, no tick
bites can be documented.<br>
 <br>
Symptoms include a bull's-eye rash in about 70 percent of human patients,
malaise, fatigue, joint pains, neurological signs, cardiac abnormalities, and
arthritis.  Patients develop antibody titers to the disease, but a single test
is difficult to interpret.  Rising titers with clinical signs indicate
infection and should be treated with systemic antibiotics for 10 days or
longer.<P>
Both the veterinarian and family physician should be notified if either a
member of the family or a pet develops symptoms after visiting an area where
ticks may live.  Most patients recover if they receive prompt treatment.  A
small percentage of cases require prolonged treatment for recovery, or fail to
respond.  <P>
In conclusion, the symptoms of these three tick-borne diseases can be easily
confused; therefore, both veterinarians and physicians need to carefully
investigate all patients with vague flu-like symptoms.  With a few simple
precautions, people and pets should be able to enjoy outside activities and be
protected against tick-borne diseases.<P>
<b>	People</b><P>
	1.	Use a good tick repellent before participating in outside activities.<br>
	2.	If possible, avoid areas with heavy brush, low-hanging tree limbs or long
grass.<br>
	3.	After returning home, remove all clothing worn outside and launder in hot
water and soap.<br>
	4.	Examine yourself carefully after all outside activities.<br>
	5.	Treat your home environment (inside and outside) at regular intervals
during the tick season to reduce the tick population.<br>
		Total elimination of ticks is unlikely due to natural reservoirs such as
mice, birds, deer, and other wildlife.<br>
	6.	Cut the grass  around your house and remove brush and low tree limbs to
decrease tick habitat and wildlife use of your property.<P>
<b>	Animals</b> <P>
	1.	Have your veterinarian set up your tick control plan.  <br>
	2.	Use flea and tick sprays as directed to avoid overdosing.<br>
	3.	Rotate flea products based on active ingredients rather than brand names to
prevent resistance.<br>
	4.	Examine pets for ticks after each outing and remove ticks as directed by
your veterinarian.<P>

<title>Care and Nurturing of Cats</title></head><body>	The following
consumer information is provided by Dr. Linda M. Wilmot, Division of Drugs<br>
	 for Non-Food Animals, Center for Veterinary Medicine. <P>
<P>
<b>CARE AND NURTURING OF CATS</b><P>
<P>
The cat (<i>Felis catus</i>) has been woven into human society for thousands of
years.  Cats have been alternately revered as gods (as in ancient Egyptian
culture) and feared as witch's "familiars" or connections to the devil (as in
Salem, Massachusetts during the witch trials).  Today we see them for what they
really are:  responsive, intelligent animals who adapt to most living
environments.<P>
With greater than 50 million cats living in American households, it is no
wonder that cats have now surpassed dogs as our favorite pets.  Cats make
wonderful companions because they are relatively easy to care for and offer a
lifetime of enjoyment. <P>
Along with the increased popularity of cats as pets comes the responsibility to
properly care for them . . . the responsibility to make sure that they are fed
properly and have appropriate shelter and adequate veterinary care.  Cats may
live fifteen or more years.  They have various personalities.  Some are
solitary individuals while others are more gregarious.  They are prone to
certain health problems and require minimal but routine care.<P>
Cats are carnivorous, which means that they have an absolute requirement for
some animal-source ingredients, such as meat, poultry, or fish, in their diets.
There is no such thing as a good vegetarian diet for a cat.  Without
animal-source ingredients in their diet they will become deficient in certain
nutrients which can prove life-threatening. <P>
When choosing a cat food, it is best to choose one that is appropriate for the
life-stage of the cat.  For example, kittens should receive kitten food and
adult cats should receive adult cat food.  Additionally, overweight cats can
benefit from a reduced calorie diet, just like humans.  It is important to
choose a food labeled as "complete and nutritionally  balanced" and that the
claims be substantiated by actual feeding  trials.<P>
There are several types of cat food available (dry, semi-moist, and canned) and
a cat owner should realize the advantages and disadvantages of each type
through a discussion with a veterinarian.  Fresh water should always be
available.  It is an old wives' tale that cats must have milk, and, in fact,
milk may cause a cat to have diarrhea. <P>
Every cat should be routinely evaluated by a veterinarian who is familiar with
the species.  The cat should be examined for any potential health problems.
Cats are prone to many of the same problems that people are.  Cancer, kidney
disease, heart disease, and dental disease are not uncommon.  The earlier a
problem is identified and addressed, the more likely the cat will respond in a
positive fashion.  As cat owners, we must help maintain their good health.
Many cats are amenable to routine brushing of their teeth with a cat
toothpaste.  Additionally, they should be examined for parasites known to
infect cats.  Most obvious to an owner would be ear mites or fleas, although
several species of intestinal worms can infest  cats and rob them of precious
nutrients.  It is important that these problems be treated, and there are very
effective drugs available.  Cats allowed to roam outdoors will obviously be
more prone to these parasites, unless the parasites have become established in
a household.<P>
As a general rule it is advisable to have a cat neutered, also called spayed
(for females) and castrated (for males).  Not only does it aid in control of
unwanted kittens,  but it also greatly minimizes the risk of problems
associated with the reproductive tract and behavioral problems associated with
sexually intact animals.  <P>
Female cats, also called queens, generally reach sexual maturity between four
and twelve months of age.  An unspayed female may be capable of producing
kittens for eight or more years.  Male cats, also called toms, usually become
fertile between six and eight months of age.  They  may remain so for fourteen
or more years.  Most veterinarians recommend that a cat be neutered at or after
six months of age, although there are individual opinions on this issue, and
interested cat owners should consult their veterinarians during one of their
cat's initial visits for examination and vaccination.<P>
There are several diseases for which cats should be vaccinated by a
veterinarian.  Feline rhinotracheitis, calici virus, and panleukopenia
(distemper) are potentially life-threatening diseases to which a cat can become
exposed.  They are caused by viruses which can easily be transmitted from cat
to cat. Some viruses can be carried on an owner's clothing after handling a
sick cat.  There are vaccines available for other diseases, such as rabies,
which has become endemic in certain areas of the country.  Therefore, it is
important that even indoor cats be vaccinated for these diseases.
Additionally, there are vaccines available for other viral diseases, feline
leukemia and feline infectious peritonitis, which are seen more commonly in
outdoor, stray cats, or in multi-cat households.  (This does not, however,
preclude indoor only cats from having these diseases.)  There are no effective
treatments for these diseases, and they should be prevented.  It is important
for cat owners to realize that there are numerous diseases, such as feline
immuno-deficiency virus infection, to which a cat can become exposed for which
there are no currently available vaccines or treatment.<P>
Also important for cat owners to understand is that cats are very sensitive to
certain medications and household products.  Cats do not metabolize aspirin
like people; it should only be used under the supervision of a veterinarian.
Acetaminophen (as in Tylenol) will kill cats and  its ingestion is considered
an emergency.  Additionally, products containing phenol, such as Lysol, should
not be used around cats because of their unique way of metabolizing these
products.  Some cats may like the taste of antifreeze, which contains ethylene
glycol, and, if ingested, will cause kidney failure if not treated immediately.
It is best not to use any questionable products around a cat until you have
checked with an authority.  Also, cats will often eat plants, some of which can
be toxic.  It is better to offer them sprouted feed oats to nibble on when they
get the urge to graze.<P>
Cats are often attracted to string-like objects, will eat tinsel, needles and
thread, rubber bands, and other similar materials.  Some cats are attracted to
electric cords.  Therefore, it is important to keep these things out of the
cat's environment or take measures to minimize their attraction to them.
Routine cleaning of kitty litter promotes good sanitation behavior.  Cat owners
must also set limits for their cats.  If they are not supposed to be in a
particular room or sharpening their nails on a particular piece of furniture,
this should be established from the moment the cat is adopted.  It is much
easier to prevent problems than to attempt to change established patterns of
behavior.  <P>
Cats depend on their owners  for the essentials of existence.  Providing them
with the proper care and treatment can mean a lifetime of companionship.  Cats
have much to give and ask for little in return.<P>

<H3>Recycled Animal Waste</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.34)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
Recycled animal waste is a processed feed productfor
livestock derived from livestock manure or amixture of manure and
litter.  Animal wastescontain significant percentages of protein,
fiber,and essential minerals and have been deliberately incorporated into animal diets for their nutrientproperties for
over 30 years.<P>
The recycling of animal waste as a feed ingredientis
primarily a local practice.  The bulk and weightof the product are such
that transportation costsfor significant interstate shipment is
generallyuneconomic.  Thus, the use of such material islargely
an intrastate matter.  Many state feedcontrol agencies have taken the
initiative inestablishing standards regarding the use of processed
animal waste as a feed ingredient.  Because of the local character of animal
waste usage as a feed ingredient and because the states have the capacity to
effectively regulate its use, the agency has revoked its previous policy
statement (21 CFR 500.40 <i>Use of Poultry Litter as Animal Feed</i>). <P>
The revocation of the policy statement represents a lessening of Federal
regulatory control in favor of state control.  However, this does not
constitute an endorsement of the use of recycled animal waste, nor has the
agency made any regulatory classification of this article (e.g., GRAS or food
additive). This action will not preclude FDA regulatory action on an ad hoc
basis against a particular shipment that clearly represents a health hazard if
the state(s) involved is unable to take the necessary action.  <P>
POLICY: <P>
The FDA will not take an active surveillance role in the regulation of
processed animal waste as an animal feed ingredient.  This role will be left to
the states.  If, however, the interstate shipment of waste which presents a
health hazard is brought to FDA's attention, and the state(s) involved cannot
take appropriate regulatory action, such action will be considered.  However,
the waste must be shown by analysis to contain levels of residues of drugs,
industrial chemicals, pesticides, pathogenic microorganisms or other
contaminants which are considered harmful to the animal or may result in
illegal residues in edible animal products. * *  District offices should
cooperate with the states if suspected or known adulteration occurs for which
the states request assistance or which they cannot handle. <P>
As these products will be regulated primarily by the states, we would
expect, to ensure uniformity of nomenclature, that they will conform to the
definitions promulgated by the Association of American Feed Control Officials,
as published in their "Official Publication" and as described in their "Model
Regulations for Processed Animal Waste Products as Animal Feed Ingredients."
While not officially recognized by FDA, Compliance Policy Guide 7126.08 regards
the AAFCO definitions as generally constituting the common or usual names for
animal feed ingredients.  As provided in this Guide, *CVM* must concur in the
suitability of AAFCO nomenclature whenever action is contemplated.

<H3>Action Levels for Aflatoxins in Animal Feeds</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.33)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
Aflatoxins are toxic by-products of mold growth oncertain
agricultural commodities. Since theirdiscovery in the early 1960's,
aflatoxins have beenshown to be carcinogenic to *laboratory test animals.*  In 1969,  FDA set an action level foraflatoxins at 20
ppb for all foods, including animalfeeds, based on FDA's analytical
capability and theagency's aim of limiting aflatoxin exposure to the lowest possible level.<P>
*Animal feeding studies conducted in the 1970'sand 1980's,
however, demonstrated that levels ofaflatoxins above 20 ppb could be
fed to certainfood-producing animals without presenting adanger
to the health of these animals or posing arisk to consumers of food
derived from theexposed animals.  On the basis of these scientific studies, the agency revised its action level in 1982to 300 ppb for
aflatoxins in cottonseed mealintended for use as a feed ingredient for
beefcattle, swine, and poultry; in 1989 to varyinglevels for
corn intended for use as a feedingredient for subgroups of the same
animals.  In1990, FDA issued guidance that aflatoxins inpeanut
products (i.e., peanuts, peanut meal,peanut hulls, peanut skins, and
ground peanut hay)intended for use as a feed ingredient are no more toxic to these same subgroups of animals than is aflatoxin in corn.
<P>
These changes in the action levels were premised on two underlying
principles:  (1) that FDA must show that an amount of aflatoxins in the feed of
a particular animal will support a charge of adulteration under section
402(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and (2) that FDA can
confirm the ultimate use of the animal feed ingredient in question. <P>
Action levels are not binding on the courts, the regulated industry, or the
agency (see:  55 FR 20782, May 21, 1990).  There may be situations where
circumstances warrant enforcement action at levels below an action level or
where enforcement action is not warranted even though an action level is
exceeded.* <P>
REGULATORY ACTION GUIDANCE: <P>
When samples of import or domestic shipments are analyzed in accordance
with applicable methods of the current Official Methods of Analysis of the
Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC), contact Case Guidance
Branch (HFV-236) if: <P>
1. The original and check analysis show the presence of aflatoxins above
the applicable action level, as follows: <P>
   *-300 ppb for corn and peanut products intended for finishing (i.e.,
feedlot) beef cattle; <P>
   -300 ppb for cottonseed meal intended for beef cattle, swine, or poultry
(regardless of age or breeding status); <P>
   -200 ppb for corn or peanut products intended for finishing swine of 100
pounds or greater; <P>
   -100 ppb for corn and peanut products intended for breeding beef cattle,
breeding swine, or mature poultry; <P>
   -20 ppb for corn, peanut products, and other animal feeds and feed
ingredients, but excluding cottonseed meal, intended for immature animals;
<P>
   -20 ppb for corn, peanut products, cottonseed meal, and other animal
feeds and feed ingredients intended for dairy animals, for animal species or
uses not specified above, or when the intended use is not
known;*<P>
         and<P>
2.   The identity of aflatoxin B1 is confirmed bychemical
deriviative formation.<P>
Before consulting with HFV-236, determine, ifpossible, the
intended use of the feed or feedingredient (animal species, age, etc.)
as well as theproportion of the ingredient in the mixed feed (number of pounds per ton).  If informationconcerning the intended
use is not available,consult with CVM when the presence of
aflatoxinshas been confirmed at levels above 20 ppb.<P>
In considering eforcement action for aflatoxinlevels below
an action level, consideration must begiven to the agency's ability to
support theadulteration charge.  Discussions of possible enforcement actions at levels below an action levelshould include
consideration of all compellingreasons for pursuing the action.
Similarconsideration is required if a field office believesthat
enforcement action at levels above an actionis not
warranted.<P>

<H3>Direct-Fed MicrobialProducts</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.41)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
Direct-fed microbial products are products that arepurported
to contain live (viable) microorganisms(bacteria and/or yeast).  The
labeling andpromotional materials, including advertisements,for
direct-fed microbial products state, suggest, orimply beneficial
effects in animals associated withthe products' content of viable
microorganisms.<b>  </b>(Note - This Guide does not address products marketed solely as silage additives intended toaffect only silage).
Direct-fed microbial productsare marketed in various forms (e.g., in
carriers formixing into feed, in oral pastes, and in
boluses).<P>
The promotion and marketing of direct-fedmicrobial products
(sometimes called probioticproducts) have increased greatly the past
fewyears.  Claims for these products are unproven.<b>  </b>Some claims
may be considered puffery; others areunproven claims for significant
disease conditionsand for improved productivity.  As competition in the marketing of these products increases,label/promotional claims
have become of greaterconcern to FDA.  Labeling and promotional
materialfor most direct-fed microbial products bear statedor
implied claims of benefits which, in theory, arederived from the
products' content of viablemicroorganisms.  Some of these products, however, are labeled or promoted only ascontaining live
microorganisms without otherclaims.<P>
The Official Publication of the Association ofAmerican Feed
Control Officials (AAFCO), underSection 36 Fermentation Products,
defines animalfeed ingredients derived from spent fermentation 
processes, and under Section 96 Yeast, definesyeast products.  For
regulatory purposes,direct-fed microbial products are considered a 
subclass of fermentation or yeast products<br>
 <P>********************************************************<br>
 <P>because they are similarly produced.  The defined ingredients have long
been used for the production of products intended for animal feed use, and FDA
is unaware of safety problems associated with these ingredients.  However,
AAFCO's Sections 36 and 96 include a number of ingredient definitions that
imply that unnamed sources of microorganisms are covered by these definitions.
Some firms have marketed direct-fed microbial products derived from
microoganims not listed by AAFCO or have permitted the fermentation process to
proceed beyond usual maximum number of microorganisms, raising questions about
the safety of these products. FDA is increasingly concerned about their safety
because of the diversity  of microorganisms being used and because of the
manufacturing processes involved.  As an example, according to some promotional
material, microorganisms in direct-fed microbial products produce substances
that in turn produce the claimed effects in the animal, and safety of these
substances is open to question. <P>
Because the products are often marketed in a dry form in a carrier intended
to be used as a component of feed, and because of their method of manufacture
and storage, there is significant question regarding whether specific products
even contain the viable microorganisms they purport to contain.  One way to
address this problem is to require firms to guarantee a specific quantity of
viable microorganisms in the labeling and then to provide a laboratory method
for testing the veracity of the guarantee. AAFCO has adopted a standard
statement for viable microorganism labeling.  Additionally, AAFCO specifies
that there should be a verifiable method to test the veracity of the
microorganism-guaranteed content specified in the labeling. <P>
The AAFCO statement is, "Contains a source of live (viable) naturally
occurring microorganisms" followed by a listing of each of the microorganisms
and the content guarantee, as colony-forming units per gram.  The guarantee
expression is specified in Regulation 4(g) of the Uniform State Feed Bill in
the AAFCO Official Publication. <P>
POLICY: <P>
1. A direct-fed microbial product with label/promotional claims for disease
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention is a new animal drug and is
adulterated under Section 501(a)(5) unless it is the subject of an approved new
animal drug application (NADA).<b>  </b>If the claims are in promotional
material thatcannot be documented as labeling, the productis
misbranded under Section 502(f)(1).<P>
2.   A direct-fed microbial product withlabel/promotional
claims for affecting thestructure or function of the body is a new animal 
drug because the claims are not derivedfrom its food
properties (i.e., the product doesnot act only as a source of nutrition
in theanimal's body) and is adulterated under Section501(a)(5)
unless it is the subject of anapproved NADA.  Such claims are
usuallyimproved animal productivity claims.  If theclaims are
in promotional material that cannotbe documented as labeling, the
product ismisbranded under Section 502(f)(1).<P>
3.   Ordinarily, a direct-fed microbial product that isnot
labeled/promoted with any therapeutic orstructure/function claims but
that contains oneor more microorganisms not listed in theAAFCO
Official Publication is a food additiveand is adulterated under Section
402(a)(2)(C),unless it is the subject of a food additive regulation.<P>
4.   A direct-fed microbial product listed by theAAFCO
Official Publication and labeled withthe AAFCO-approved label statement
for livemicroorganism content, and not labeled orpromoted with
any therapeutic orstructure/function claims, will be regulated as a food 
as defined in Section 201(f)(3) andusually will not require
FDA regulatoryattention.  It is anticipated that the states will monitor 
these products.  However, if FDA hassafety concerns about
these products, it willtreat them as not generally recognized as
safeand will regulate them as food additives subjectto FDA
enforcement attention.<P>
5.   A product containing microorganisms listed bythe AAFCO
Official Publication but notpurported to contain live microorganisms
andwith no label/promotional representations otherthan as a
source of designated nutrients will beregulated as a food as defined in
Section201(f)(3).  Although claims as nutrient sourcescould be
misleading, depending on directionsfor use, this type of product
usually will notrequire FDA regulatory attention.  It is anticipated that 
the states will monitor theseproducts.  However,
if FDA has safety concern about these products, it will treat them as not
generally recognized as safe and will regulate them as food additives subject
to FDA enforcement attention.  <P>
REGULATORY ACTION GUIDANCE: <P>
A direct-fed microbial product that is considered to be 1) an unapproved
new animal drug, or 2) an unapproved food additive, or 3) a misbranded drug
under 502(f)(1) should be considered for regulatory action.  The initial action
should be a *Warning* letter.  Submit recommendations to Case Guidance Branch,
HFV-236.  Seizure or injunction should be considered if the *Warning* letter
does not attain adequate correction.  Consultation with Case Guidance Branch is
recommended in determining the regulatory status of a product and in deciding
whether seizure or injunction is the more appropriate action to recommend.
<P>
A direct-fed microbial product that appears to be misbranded under Section
403(a) will be considered for regulatory action on a case-by-case basis.
Complete labels, labeling, and promotional material should be submitted to Case
Guidance Branch, HFV-236, for review.  <P>
Priority for enforcement attention should be given to products that are
unapproved new animal drugs or food additives, over products that are
misbranded.  As appropriate, the assistance of state feed control agencies
should be requested in obtaining corrections of violative products.  <P>

<html><head> <title>Dog Ownership Self-test</title></head><body><b>DOG OWNERSHIP
SELF-TEST</b><P>
1.	Have you read about the history of the breed of dog you plan to buy?  Do you
know the desired characteristics of this breed?  Do these characteristics fit
your life style?  Does the breed's activity level match yours?  <P>
2.	Do you have the necessary supplies for a new puppy?  You will need food and
water dishes, puppy foods, a crate or other safe resting place, a collar,
leash, comb and brush, etc.<P>
3.	Have you considered the cost in time and money to provide health care, food,
and training for a puppy?  Will you make an appointment with a veterinarian for
a health examination, shots, and worming if needed?  <P>
4.	Will you be able to take the time to introduce your new puppy to the routine
at your house?  It is best to get puppies on weekends or when you can take some
vacation time.<P>
5.	Have you located a puppy training class?  Do you know when your puppy can
start training?  Do you have books or pamphlets to help you cope with your
puppy until he or she is old enough for classes?  Most of the major dog food
companies, veterinarians, and pet supply shops carry this information.  Many
dog training clubs or schools also have new puppy information.<P>
6.	If you work outside the home, are you prepared to teach your puppy to spend
your working hours alone?  Since dogs are social animals, your puppy will not
want to be alone.  Expect your puppy to whine, cry, and/or bark when you leave
for work.  This is a normal survival behavior to get the pack leader (you) to
rescue the puppy before he or she gets into real danger.  If your puppy
protests being alone he may annoy your neighbors even if he doesn't bother you.
This can cause serious problems with your neighbors or landlord.  Many urban
and suburban dogs need to tolerate being alone eight to ten hours per day.
Your puppy's breeder, puppy books, veterinarian, or puppy class instructor
should be able to help you with this task.<P>
7.	Are you prepared to prevent environmental contamination by picking up and
properly disposing of your dog's feces?  This is necessary to protect yourself
from diseases that can be transmitted from your dog to you.  Your family,
friends, and neighbors may also become infected with diseases that can be
transmitted from your dog to people.  It is also necessary to prevent
reinfestation of your dog with worms from exposure to infective worm eggs and
larvae.<P>
8.	Have you planned to spay or neuter your pet?  Neutered pets are excellent
companions and they don't produce litters of unwanted puppies. <P>
	It is quite expensive and very labor intensive to provide proper medical and
nutritional care for your female dog and her puppies.  Males that are bred will
often try to escape from their yards to search for other females to breed.
This often leads to fights or accidental injuries.  Your male could also become
infected with diseases such as brucellosis or canine venereal tumor.  If your
dog has genetic defects or carries hidden genetic defects, breeding (especially
to a dog with the same defects) may often lead to puppies born with defects.
Progressive retinal atrophy (which causes blindness), hip dysplasia, heart
defects, and deafness are common examples of genetic diseases.  It takes
careful research and planning to raise healthy, well-adjusted puppies.
Breeding your male or female is almost always an expensive proposition which is
seldom profitable and does not alleviate behavior problems.  In most cases, you
can buy a quality puppy cheaper than you can raise one.<P>
If you have answered yes to all the questions above, best wishes on your new
dog!  On the other hand, if you have answered no to several of these questions,
dog ownership may not be for you.  While dogs make great companions and
friends, they also require a degree of responsibility that not everyone can
achieve.  Don't contribute to the huge number of dogs in animal shelters that
will be euthanized because no one wants them.  It would be inhumane to neglect
a dog's need for social interaction by keeping the animal constantly (1) tied
in the yard, or (2) locked in a basement or garage due to
behavior/housebreaking problems that could have been prevented.  <P>
Even worse is the owner who dumps his unwanted dogs on country roads or back
alleys to fend for themselves.  Most of these animals die from injuries,
starvation, or disease.  If you already have a dog and you have answered no to
several of these questions, consider finding a responsible owner to adopt your
dog.  If you aren't ready to take on the responsibility of owning a dog, please
don't contribute to over-population and dog behavior problems.<P>

<H3>Oral Iron Products for Baby Pigs <br>
</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.16)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
Pigs are born with only a limited store of iron.  The sow's milk is low in
this element, and unless piglets have access to outside sources, iron
deficiency anemia may develop in two to three weeks following birth.  This
happens mainly when baby pigs are kept indoors on concrete floors; a common
practice.  The hemoglobin levels decrease in the baby pig from 8-12 grams per
100 ml of blood at birth to as low as 2-3 grams in three to four weeks.
Feeding iron salts to sows during gestation has not been effective in
increasing reserves in newborn pigs.<P>
Since the time that commercial iron injectable preparations were introduced
for prevention and treatment of iron deficiency anemia, the use of oral
preparations in baby pigs (iron solutions, tablets and pastes) has declined.
The injectables are new animal drugs, as described in 21 CFR 510.440.  Various
oral preparations, however, continue to be marketed.  They are formulated using
different iron compounds and many are fixed combinations with minerals,
vitamins, or other substances in various dosage forms, doses, and dosing
intervals.  *CVM* is not aware of information that the dose, dosage internal,
and iron bioavailability for most of these products are adequate when label
directions are followed.  Nor are we aware that any product fed to pregnant or
nursing sows will significantly increase the iron content of sow's milk or
prevent iron deficiency anemia in baby pigs.<P>
POLICY:<P>
*CVM* considers all oral iron preparations labeled for the prevention or
treatment of iron deficiency anemia in suckling pigs to be new animal drugs
which may not be marketed unless approved by an NADA.  We would not, however,
object to the marketing of oral iron preparations as foods, labeled as
nutritional supplements.  Such products should provide nutrient levels
consistent with the suggestions of recognized authorities and may not bear any
drug claims, e.g., iron deficiency anemia.  Recommendations regarding
unapproved oral iron  preparations represented or implied to prevent  baby pig
anemia may be submitted to *CVM*  (HFV-236) for regulatory action under
501(a)(5).   *Warning* letter is the initial action of choice.  <P>
*Material beteween asterisks is new or revised.* <P>

<H3>Use of Statements Regarding NADA Approval by FDA in Labeling and
Advertising of New Animal Drugs</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.01)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
Section 301(l) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act specifically
prohibits any labeling or advertising representation that a new human drug has
been approved by FDA under the provision of Section 505 of the Act.  There is
no similar prohibition pertaining to labeling or advertising of new animal
drugs.  Section 512(i) of the Act provides that, upon approval of a new animal
drug, a regulation shall be published in the <i>Federal Register</i> setting
forth the terms of such approval.<P>
FDA approves a new animal drug as safe and effective when used only for the
purposes and under the conditions set forth in an NADA.  We do not guarantee
that every drug manufactured pursuant to the NADA meets all of the requirements
of the Act, nor could we do so.Approval of an NADA still leaves open the
possibility that the drug in question may be in violation of some other
provisions of the law (e.g., it is possible that the drug may be contaminated).
The agency is concerned that statements regarding FDA approval may be overly
broad and, therefore, could mislead individuals into believing that FDA has
approved the drug for conditions and purposes other than those conditions set
out in the approved labeling.  However, the agency recognizes that an
appropriate statement of FDA approval could be useful to users.  This policy
guide establishes conditions under which reference to FDA approval in labeling
or advertising of new animal drugs would be appropriate.<P>
POLICY:<P>
1.  Labels and package labeling may be revised only on the basis of a
supplemental NADA approval.<P>
2.  The label and package labeling may bear only the statement, "NADA
#_____, Approved by FDA."<P>
3.  The statement should appear at the bottom of the front panel of the
label on the immediate container and at the bottom of carton labeling
(preferably on the front panel).  It should appear at the very top (beginning)
or the very bottom (end) of inserts.<P>
4.  The type, style, size, color or other means of emphasizing the
statement should be no more prominent than the least prominent signal word
identifying cautionary information appearing on the label (or the text of such
cautionary information if no signal word is used to identify it).<P>
5.  The statement may not be placed to obscure or otherwise render less
conspicuous any necessary information on the labels or labeling.<P>
6.  The statement may be used in promotional labeling or advertising for
approved products.<P>
7.  Any additional statements in promotional material may be directed only
to the fact of NADA approval and may not characterize the basis, nature or
impact of that approval, either as it applies to a particular product or to
other approved or unapproved products.  The availability of a Freedom of
Information Summary (summary basis of approval) on file with FDA may be noted
in promotional material.  The specific section of the Code of Federal
Regulations which establishes the conditions of approval may be cited.<P>

<H3>Rendered Animal Feed Ingredients</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.24)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
Rendered animal feed ingredients include the various poultry, meat and
marine products which result from the rendering of these animal tissues.
Rendering of poultry and other animal tissues has been practiced for over a
hundred years as a means of salvaging valuable protein and fat content from
otherwise waste material.  For many years end products from rendering have been
used to feed animals.  The rendering industry utilizes packinghouse offal, meat
processing waste, restaurant waste and animal tissues from other sources
including animals that have died otherwise than by slaughter. <P>
There are two types of processes in use by the rendering industry to
process this material.  They are dry rendering, used for the largest portion,
and wet rendering.  Both rendering processes ensure that the resultant animal
feed ingredients pose no threat of disease transmission to animals which are
fed the material or to the health of humans consuming their edible products
(meat, milk, and eggs).  *CVM* has no evidence of human or animal health hazard
associated with the feeding of properly rendered and handled animal feed
ingredients despite the use of tissues from diseased animals or animals that
have died otherwise than by slaughter.  In addition, the *Center for*
Veterinary Medicine does not believe that Congress intended the Act to preclude
application of different standards to human and animal foods under Section 402.
Different standards have historically existed for human and animal food
concerned with aesthetics, the *Center* has permitted other aesthetic variables
in dealing with animal feed, as for instance the use of <i>properly treated</i>
insect or rodent contaminated food for animal feed. <P>
POLICY: <P>
No regulatory action will be considered for animal feed ingredients
resulting from the ordinary rendering process of industry, including those
using animals which have died otherwise than by slaughter, provided they are
not otherwise in violation of the law. <P>
Rendered animal feed ingredients which contain harmful
microorganisms, toxins or chemical substances may be considered adulterated
under Sections 402(a)(1) or (2) of the Act.  Where a rendering procedure itself
raises a question of disease transmission, the ingredient made may be deemed
adulterated under Section 402(a)(4). <P>
Where applicable, rendered animal feed ingredients should conform to
the definitions promulgated by the Association of American Feed Control
Officials, Inc. (AAFCO), as published in their "Official Publication," for feed
control purposes.  Compliance Policy Guide 7126.08 recognizes the AAFCO
definitions as generally constituting the common or usual names for animal feed
ingredients conforming in origin and content to these definitions.  Included
are such products as poultry by-product meal, meat meal, meat and bone meal and
fish meal.<P>

<H3>Failure to Register *and/or Drug List* </H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.25)</b><P>
REGULATORY ACTION GUIDANCE:<P>
1.   CRITERIA FOR DIRECT ISSUANCE OF A *WARNING* LETTER<P>
Districts are authorized to issue *Warning* Letters in accordance with
Chapter 8-10, Regulatory Procedures Manual when the following conditions are
met:<P>
a.   The firm is engaged in the manufacture, preparation, propagation,
compounding or processing of veterinary drugs and is subject to registration
*and drug listing* under Section 510 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act, and is not exempt under any of the provisions of 21 CFR, Part 207.
<P>
NOTE: Veterinarians compounding prescription drugs for use in their private
practice are not required to register.  Veterinarians manufacturing drugs for
resale must register. <P>
b. A current inspection includes an inventory of veterinary drugs on hand.
*  *  <P>
c. The establishment file documents that top level managers at the facility
have been advised verbally or in writing (see REMARKS) of the firm's
responsibility to register. <P>
d. The district has called the *FDA headquarters unit* responsible for
registration *and drug listing* to assure that no registration *or drug
listing* forms have been received. <P>
2. OTHER LEGAL SANCTIONS <P>
If issuance of the *Warning* Letter does not achieve correction, one of the
following legal actions should be recommended to *CVM,*Division of Compliance,
HFV-236 within one week after the response period expires: <P>
a. Seizure: <P>
When failure to register *and/or drug list* is the only actionable
violation and a firm fails to comply with the *Warning* Letter, seizure of all
products whose manufacture necessitates registration and/or in the
non-registered firm's possession, is the recommended action.  Applicable raw
materials may be included to bring a small lot up to seizable size.  Do not
recommend seizure of lots otherwise believed to be in compliance in the
possession of consignees.  *An inventory* of the drugs manufactured, repacked,
or relabeled should be submitted with the regulatory action request. <P>
b. Injunction: <P>
Injunction is only recommended when seizure action cannot be accomplished
(short supply items, small lots) or when seizure action fails to bring about
correction.  Include a full description of the establishment's business

<H3>Extra-Label Use of New Animal Drugs in Food-Producing Animals</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.06)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
Concern over the extra-label use of drugs in treating food-producing
animals and the possibility that human food may become adulterated with illegal
drug residues from such misuse has prompted a revision in the Center for
Veterinary Medicine (CVM) extra-label drug use policy.  Under the revised
policy, a finding of illegal drug residues no longer will be a prerequisite for
initiating regulatory action based on extra-label drug use of drugs in
food-producing animals.<P>
For the purpose of this policy, "extra-label use" refers to the actual or
intended use of a new animal drug in a food-producing animal in a manner that
is not in accordance with the drug labeling.  This includes, but is not limited
to, use in species or for indications (disease or other conditions) not listed
in the labeling, use at dosage levels higher than those stated in the labeling,
and failure to  observe the stated withdrawal time.<P>
FDA in the past has not sanctioned extra-label uses of drugs in
food-producing animals, but the agency has stated that it would refrain from
instituting regulatory action against licensed veterinarians for using or
prescribing in their practices any drugs they could legally obtain.<P>
Nevertheless, it has been FDA's position that veterinarians may be subject
to regulatory action for any violative drug residues in human food resulting
from their prescriptions, recommendations, or treatments contrary to label
instructions.  Similarly, anyone in the producing or marketing chain who could
be shown to have caused illegal drug residues through extra-label use of drugs
in food-producing animals has been subject to regulatory action.<P>
*In contrast, under usual circumstances veterinary practitioners may
consider the extra-label use of drug products in non-food-producing animal
practice without being subject to FDA enforcement actions.  In rare
circumstances, for example when the health of the treated animals is harmed,
regulatory attention by FDA would be considered or, preferably, referred to the
State veterinary licensing authority for investigation.*  <P>
POLICY: <P>
The use or intended use of new animal drugs in treating food-producing
animals in any manner other than in accord with the approved labeling causes
the drugs to be adulterated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the
Act) (sections 501(a)(5) and (6), 512(a)(1)(A) and (B), 512(a)(2)).  The agency
will consider regulatory action when such use or intended use is found, whether
by a veterinarian, producer, or other person.  Regulatory actions will also be
considered against distributors and others who might cause adulteration of
approved new animal drugs.  Nevertheless, extra-label drug use in treating
food-producing animals may be considered by a veterinarian when the health of
animals is immediately threatened and suffering or death would result from
failure to treat the affected animals.  In instances of this nature, regulatory
action would not ordinarily be considered provided all of the following
criteria are met and precautions observed:<P>
1. A careful medical diagnosis is made by an attending veterinarian within
the context of a valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship ***;<P>
2. A determination is made that (a) there is no marketed drug specifically
labeled to treat the condition diagnosed, or (b) drug therapy at the dosage
recommended by the labeling has been found clinically ineffective by the
veterinarian in the animals to be treated;<P>
3. Procedures are instituted to assure that identity of the treated animals
is carefully maintained;<P>
4. Significantly extended time period is assigned for drug withdrawal prior
to marketing meat, milk, or eggs; steps are taken to assure that the assigned
timeframes are met, and no illegal residues occur; and<P>
*5 The prescribed or dispensed extra-label drug (prescription legend or
over the counter) bears labeling information which is adequate to assure the
safe and proper use of the product.  At a minimum, the following label
information is recommended:<P>
a. The name and address of the veterinary practitioner.<P>
b. The established name of the drug (active ingredient), or if formulated
from more than one ingredient, the established name of each ingredient.<P>
c. Any directions for use specified by the practitioner (including the
class/species or identification of the animals; and the dosage, frequency,
route of administration, and duration of therapy).<P>
d. Any cautionary statements specified by the veterinarian.<P>
e. The veterinarian's specified withdrawal/discard time(s) for meat, milk,
eggs, or any food which might be derived from the treated animal(s).*<P>
Extra-label use of drugs in treating food-producing animals may under this
policy, therefore, be considered only in special circumstances.  The
"exempting" criteria do not include drug use in treating food-producing animals
by the layman.  Lay persons cannot be expected to have sufficient knowledge and
understanding concerning animal diseases, pharmacology, toxicology, drug
interactions, and other scientific parameters to use drugs in treating
food-producing animals in any way other than as labeled.<P>
Certain drugs may not be used in treating food-producing animals even under
the cited criteria.  This includes chloramphenicol.  Extra-label uses of drugs
in treating food-producing animals for improving rate of weight gain, feed
efficiency, or other producing purposes, or for routine disease prevention are
inappropriate as is use for therapeutic purposes other than under the
circumstances described above.  Also, the criteria cited above do not sanction
the sale and use, for any purpose, of new animal drugs that are not approved,
such as diethylstilbestrol (DES).  Furthermore, a drug (including a bulk drug)
may not be mixed into feed for any use or at a potency level not specifically
permitted by the regulations in 21 CFR Part 558, even if prescribed or ordered
by a veterinarian.<P>
REGULATORY GUIDANCE<P>
The highest priorities for regulatory attention regarding extra-label use
are:<P>
1. Instances where illegal residues occur.<P>
2. *In all food-producing animals:<br>
    Chloramphenicol<br>
    Clenbuterol<br>
    Diethylstilbestrol (DES)<br>
    Dimetridazole<br>
    Ipronidazole <br>
    Other nitroimidazoles<br>
    Furazolidone (Except for approved topical use)<br>
    Nitrofurazone (Except for approved topical use)<P>
3. In lactating dairy cattle:  <br>
    Sulfonamide drugs (except approved use of sulfa-dimethoxine,
sulfabromomethazine and sulfaethoxy-pyridazine)*<P>
4. Manufacturers and distributors who promote extra-label use of
drugs.<P>
5. The mixing of drugs into medicated feeds intended for extra-label
use.<P>
6. Extra-label use by laymen at their own initiative.<P>
***A valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship, as defined by the
American Veterinary Medical Association is the following:<P>
"An appropriate veterinarian-client-patient relationship will exist
when:<P>
(1)  the veterinarian has assumed the responsibility for making medical
judgements regarding the health of the animal(s) and the need for medical
treatment, and the client (owner or other caretaker) has agreed to follow the
instructions of the veterinarian; and when (2) there is sufficient knowledge of
the  animal(s) by the veterinarian to initiate at least  a general or
preliminary diagnosis of the  medical condition of the animal(s).  This means
that the veterinarian has recently seen and is  personally acquainted with the
keeping and  care of the animal(s) by virtue of an  examination of the
animal(s), and/or by  medically appropriate and timely visits to the  premises
where the animal(s) are kept; and when (3) the practicing veterinarian is
readily available for follow-up in case of adverse reactions or failure of the
regimen of therapy."<P>

<H3>Teat Dips and Udder Washes for Dairy Cows and Goats</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.30)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
A. Teat Dips <P>
Teat dips are drugs that are applied to the teats of lactating animals
immediately <i>following</i> milking and removal of the milking machine to
control the spread of mastitis.  Since the control of mastitis is inherent in
the purpose for using teat dips, the control of mastitis constitutes their
intended use whether or not specifically labeled for this purpose.  In the
FEDERAL REGISTER of August 9, 1977 (42 FR 40217), the agency published a
proposed regulation which would designate teat dips as new animal drugs and
require them to be subject to approved NADAs.  The proposed regulation has not
been finalized.  The comments submitted in response to the proposal and other
factors have resulted in a reevaluation of the intended regulation.  This Guide
establishes agency policy pending final disposition of the proposed
regulation.<P>
B. Udder Washes<P>
There are many products being marketed which are intended and labeled for
cleansing the udders of lactating cows and goats prior to milking.  Use of
these products is consistent with the Grade "A" Pasteurized Milk Ordinance
(1965 Recommendation of the United States Public Health Service) which includes
the following statements:<P>
The udders and teats of all milking cows shall be cleaned and treated with
a sanitizing solution just prior to the time of milking, and shall be
relatively dry before milking.  Udder washes may be classified as animal drugs
if formulated to contain one or more antimicrobial chemicals as active
ingredients, and labeling includes claims for controlling mastitis or the
spread of mastitis, or labeling includes other claims for controlling
microorganisms in or on the animal. <P>
POLICY:<P>
Teat dips and udder washes classified as drugs, may currently be marketed
without NADA approval.  At some future time, these drug products may be
required to comply with the NADA approval requirements of Section 512 of the
Act.<P>
Udder wash products promoted as cleansing agents and not classified as
drugs could be required to be the subject of food additive regulations unless
they are considered GRAS.  This decision will be made on individual products
based on directions for use and potential to contaminate milk and dairy
products.<P>
We do not expect to take regulatory action against teat dip and udder wash
drug products on a 501(a)(5) charge unless we have specific information that a
particular product may be harmful, or ineffective.  The *Center for* Veterinary
Medicine will continue to review the labeling of all teat dip and udder wash
products and provide comment on their regulatory status and appropriateness of
the labeling. <P>
Manufacturers of teat dips and udder washes falling within the drug
definition are subject to the registration and drug listing requirements of
Section 510 of the Act.  Part 211 of the GMP regulations is applicable to the
manufacture of teat dips and drug udder washes. <P>

<H3>Responsibility for Illegal Drug Residues in Meat, Milk and Eggs</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.05)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) regulates the marketing
of drugs for use in animals and the presence of residues of such drugs that may
occur in the products of treated animals marketed for food (meat, milk and
eggs).  Failure to observe label withdrawal periods before slaughter is the
principal cause of illegal drug residues.  Other causes may include failure to
observe other label directions, poor feed manufacturing practices and mix-ups.
Illegal drug residues in the edible products of treated animals can constitute
a hazard to the health of persons consuming such food.<P>
In determining responsibility for illegal residues the concept of
"causing," as expressed in Section 301 of the Act must be developed.  Acts
under the "causing" concept may be committed by one or more individuals in the
production and marketing chain when illegal residues occur and, if justified by
the facts, charges should be considered against these individuals.  Therefore,
all investigations of illegal residues should determine the culpability of any
and all individuals who may have acted (or failed to act) in such a way as to
be responsible for illegal residues.<P>
Such individuals could include farmers, feedmill operators, veterinarians,
livestock producers, animal dealers, brokers, etc.  In one instance, a
veterinarian administered a drug calling for a 30-day withdrawal time but
recommended marketing the treated animal within 5 days.  Another investigation
disclosed purchase of a cow at an auction by an animal vendor who then sold the
animal to a slaughter house without determining whether the animal had been
treated with drugs, and, if so, whether a withdrawal time was required and
followed.  Sick or injured animals may be marketed before a drug withdrawal
period has expired.  Poultry are sometimes double dosed in both feed and
drinking water.<P>
POLICY:<P>
Our policy is to hold responsible any individual in the production and
marketing chain who can be shown to have been responsible for having "caused"
(by any act of commission or omission) illegal drug residues in edible animal
products.<P>

<H3>Anthelmintics</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.12)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
Since no single active ingredient is effective to remove all species of
worms in animals, *CVM* has advised manufacturers of animal wormers that they
may represent their products for use only for the particular species of worm
for which they are effective.  *CVM* has further advised that not only should
the labeling of anthelmintic products bear the common name followed by the
scientific name of each worm species for which intended, but they may not be
represented as a "worm expeller" or"vermifuge" since such terminology may
represent a broad worm removal capability beyond that which the product
possesses.  *Anthelmintics marketed over-the-counter must also bear the label
statement "Consult your veterinarian for assistance in the diagnosis,
treatment, and control of parasitism," as required by 21 CFR 500.25(b).*
*Additionally, if the product is not generally recognized as safe and effective
for its labeled uses, it may not be marketed unless it is covered by an
approved new animal drug application.* <P>
POLICY: <P>
Anthelmintic preparations which are represented broadly as a vermifuge or a
worm expellant and are not species specific in their labeling are violative.
*CVM* will also consider safety and efficacy aspects of the products generally
to determine their new animal drug status and may initiate appropriate action.
<P>
*REGULATORY ACTION GUIDANCE: <P>
New animal drug charges may be recommended against such products where the
labeling and formulation lack general recognition of safety and effectiveness.
<P>
Regulatory action based on a misbranding charge under 502(f)(1) will be
considered when anthelmintics are not labeled with the common name, followed by
the scientific name of each worm species, or the label bears such terms as
"worm expeller" or vermifuge."* <P>

<title>HORSE OWNERSHIP--A PRIVILEGE AND A RESPONSIBILITY</title></head><body><P>
<b>INFORMATION FOR CONSUMERS</b><br>
<b>FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION</b><br>
<b>CENTER FOR VETERINARY MEDICINE</b><P>
		   The following consumer information is provided by Karen A. Kandra,
Consumer  
		   Safety Officer, Programs and Hearings Branch, Center for Veterinary
Medicine.<P>
<b>HORSE OWNERSHIP--A PRIVILEGE AND A RESPONSIBILITY</b><P>
The total equine population in the U. S. numbers approximately six million.
Horse owners seem to be increasing rapidly, but prospective owners must realize
the extensive commitment in time and money that being a responsible owner
entails, since the horse is totally dependent on its caretaker for its welfare.
Whether you are lucky enough to stable the horse where you live or employ the
services of a local boarding facility, there are many aspects of horse
management which should be considered.<P>
<b>Feeding</b><P>
Feeding horses is a science wherein the old adage "little and often" must be
followed.  The horse's stomach is extremely small in relation to its overall
size, so it cannot efficiently utilize a large amount of feed at one time.
Ideally, a horse should be fed two or even three times a day.  There are many
commercial feed mixtures available, and you should choose the proper one
depending on the intended use and amount of activity your horse will have.
Most horses do not require additional vitamin supplements, if fed the
appropriate commercial feed.<P>
A horse should get good clean hay in addition to fresh water and a mineral salt
block at all times.  The hay should be free of dust and mold and not contain
thorny weeds or nonpalatable material.  In the winter when pasture is not
available, the large round bales are an excellent source of hay.  They provide
activity to keep bored horses from chewing on the fences for lack of anything
else to munch on.  <P>
The horse's physical condition is totally dependent on the person who feeds
him.  If his ribs are showing, it is likely he's not getting enough to eat
(assuming he does not have parasites).  Conversely, if he's obese, he's getting
too much.  Horses should be fed individually to be sure they get their
prescribed amount.  If fed in a group, there may be one who wolfs down his own
feed and then runs to the other buckets before the more timid horses are
finished.  Progressive loss in condition despite a good appetite indicates a
need for consultation with your veterinarian.<P>
<b>Veterinary Care</b><P>
Parasites are a leading cause of death, but can definitely be prevented by
periodic de-worming.  Your veterinarian can recommend a specific program based
on the number of horses and their environment.  For example, two horses on 75
acres of pasture would not have the same exposure level as 50 horses on 75
acres.  There are several products approved which are effective against
different types of parasites.  Many are over-the-counter paste preparations
which are easy for a lay person to administer.  <P>
When choosing a veterinarian, select one who has an equine practice or at least
sees horses 50 percent of the time, rather than a small animal practitioner who
rarely sees large animals.  Usually you can check with your local veterinary
association or other local horse owners for a referral.  It's important to
develop a good relationship with your veterinarian since there is bound to be a
time when you will need to call the doctor out for an emergency.<P>
<b>Hoof Care</b><P>
When choosing a farrier (blacksmith), it is imperative to select a reputable
one, perhaps recommended by your veterinarian or other clients.  There is much
truth to the saying "no foot, no horse," and if a bad blacksmith ruins your
horse's feet, it can take up to a year to repair the damage done.  The horse's
feet need trimming every 6-8 weeks, and more often during the summer months
when the hooves grow faster.  If you intend to ride on hard or rocky surfaces,
the horse will need shoes to protect the hooves and keep them from cracking and
breaking.  Depending on the environment, it may be necessary to apply a
dressing  routinely to help keep the hooves from drying out.<P>
<b>Dental Care</b><P>
Annually, a veterinarian or horse dentist should be called to "float" or file
down the teeth.  He will examine the condition of the horse's mouth and may
have to extract some "wolf" teeth which may interfere with the bit.  This is a
simple procedure, not requiring surgery or anesthesia (unlike humans).  The
veterinarian or dentist will rasp any rough edges which may have developed on
the grinders.  This sharpness can cause pain and prevents the horse from
chewing his food thoroughly.  If you notice him dropping feed from his mouth
while eating, this is a strong indication that his teeth need attention.<P>
<b>General Management Recommendations</b><P>
In horse management, the key word is <b>prevention</b>.  Here are some
precautions to avoid a catastrophe:<P>
*	Think safety first.  Do not leave any sharp objects, i.e., wire, glass,
pitchforks, etc., where a horse might injure himself.<P>
*	 Don't leave any toxic substances, i.e., paint cans, antifreeze, gasoline, or
poisonous plants/trees within the horse's reach. <P>
*	Keep electrical plugs and cords out of reach of horses.<P>
*	Give annual vaccinations recommended by your veterinarian, which may include
tetanus, encephalomyelitis,  influenza, <br>
	 rhinopneumonitis, and rabies.<P>
*	Feed little and often, but do not overfeed.  A horse's digestive system is
very sensitive and reacts to any sudden change in diet.<br>
	Consult your veterinarian regarding the appropriate diet for the horse's age
and  activity level.<br>
  <br>
*	Always provide shelter from bad weather with a clean place to lie down.
Horses really do enjoy lying down,  despite the myth that they<br>
	only sleep standing up.  If you don't have a barn, a 3-sided loafing shed can
suffice as protection from 	summer sun and flies and<br>
	 winter wind and storms.  <P>
*	Clean fresh water (ice-free in winter) should be available at all times.
This means scrubbing tubs and buckets regularly.<P>
*	Groom horse often to remove dirt and stimulate the skin and coat.  <P>
*	Horses are happier if they have company.  If you own only one horse, perhaps
a neighbor's horse can suffice, or  a miniature donkey,<br>
	 goat, or even a chicken can be a barnyard companion.<P>
*	Horses are creatures of habit, so stick to a routine.  Feed them at
approximately the same times every day.  If you must go away,<br>
	employ the services of a dependable caretaker and leave the phone number of
your veterinarian in case of an emergency.<P>
* 	 Learn first aid for  minor abrasions, how to bandage wounds, and recognize
when a  cut needs stitches; also learn how to take the  
	horse's temperature,  pulse, and respiration.  The veterinarian will ask you
these vital signs when you call in an emergency.<P>
*	The first indication of illness is generally listlessness and/or lack of
appetite.  The temperature should then be  taken, and 	any 
	 elevation over 100-101 degrees should trigger a call to your veterinarian.
<P>
*	Pick out the hooves daily to remove stones and dirt and prevent thrush.<P>
*	If you are new at horse-keeping, choose an advisor--an experienced stable
manager--to consult when  necessary, join a horse club,<br>
	 read horse books.  There are endless sources of information on all aspects of
horse management.<P>

<TITLE>GUILTY PLEA IN RESIDUE CASE</TITLE>

August 9, 1996
<P>
<h3>
GUILTY PLEA IN RESIDUE CASE</h3>
<hr>
On July 18, 1996, in the federal court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Richard 
Eugene Gorr and Jeffrey Lee Gorr, operating as Gorr Livestock, pled guilty to 
conspiracy to introduce adulterated food into interstate commerce with the intent to 
defraud and mislead.  The Gorrs were livestock dealers, buying, selling, and 
transporting livestock, including cattle, obtained from farmers and auction markets, to 
meat packers for slaughter for food for human consumption.  Gorr Livestock 
specialized in sick, old, and crippled cattle which frequently had been treated with 
antibiotics and other drugs prior to sale or while they were in the possession of the 
Gorrs.  The Gorrs had been identified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food 
Safety and Inspection Service as the source for more than 30 animals containing 
illegal levels of drugs.  Also, on three separate occasions, the Gorrs purchased from 
undercover FDA agents animals which they were told were medicated, and 
subsequently sold those animals for human food.
<P>
This is the first undercover criminal investigation for the practice of knowingly selling 
medicated animals for slaughter for human food.  This investigation was a cooperative 
effort between FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations, FDA's Detroit District Office, the 
Michigan Department of Agriculture, and the Michigan State Police.
<P>
Sentencing is scheduled to take place on October 10, 1996.  Each defendant faces up 
to 6 months in prison and/or a fine of $10,000.

<H3>Guideline For Efficacy Studies For Systemic Sustained 
 Release Sulfonamide Boluses For Cattle</B></H3><P>
U.S. Department Of Health And Human Services Public Health Service<br>
Food And Drug Administration<br>
Center For Veterinary Medicine<P>

<b><i>I. Sustained Release as a claim for a cattle sulfonamide bolus implies
that fewer doses of the sustained bolus will be needed then with the
conventional bolus to prevent, control, or treat a systemic cattle disease. The
terms prolonged release, delayed release, timed release, controlled release or
related terminology are synonyms for sustained release for the purposes of this
guideline.</i></b><P>
The "sustained" release bolus must result in a dosage schedule that is
of practical benefit and results in a significant increase in drug effect
time.<P>
II. There are two ways that "sustained" release may be demonstrated.<P>
<b>Bioequivalency Studies: </b>This method may be used if the conventional
sulfonamide bolus has been evaluated, a regulation has been published, or when
there is adequate documentation in the literature for efficacy of the
conventional bolus at specified dosage levels. A crossover study is conducted.
In other words, a sulfonamide blood profile is generated using the conventional
bolus as the baseline for comparison with the sustained release bolus. The data
should be assembled so that a comparison can be made of the two blood profiles
to demonstrate bioequivalency of free sulfonamide.<p>
<b>2.	Controlled clinical studies: </b>This method should be used when
bioequivalency studies cannot be performed.<P>
Efficacy trials should be conducted with animals demonstrating the clinical
indication for use (shipping fever, pneumonia, etc.). A minimum of three
different dose levels must be titrated.<P>
<b>Test Groups Within the controlled Trials:</b><P>
1.	No drug<P>
2.	Conventional drug level No. 1<P>
3.	Conventional drug level No. 2<P>
4.	Conventional drug level No. 3<P>
5.	Sustained-release level No. 1<P>
6.	Sustained-release level No. 2<P>
7.	Sustained-release level No. 3<P>
The dose-response data from groups 5, 6, and 7 should provide the optimum use
level of the sustained-release drug formulation.<P>
The response data from groups 2, 3, and 4 compared to groups 5, 6, and 7 should
document efficacy comparability of the conventional drug and the
sustained-release drug. Three levels of the conventional drug are needed in the
absence of prior dose titration studies. The trials should be conducted so that
a valid statistical analysis can be made.<br><br><P>

<H3>Use of Type A Medicated Article Brand Names in Feed Labels</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.12)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
In response to an inquiry, CVM has advised a manufacturer of type A
medicated articles that there would be no objection to the franchised use of
trademark or brand or trade names of his products by feed mills in the product
names of their finished medicated feeds.  However, CVM believes that such use
of a brand (trade) name for a specific drug ingredient must be appropriate for
the intended use of the feed and must not be otherwise misleading to the
purchaser.  So as not to be misleading in any particular and to be fully
informative it was concluded that the labeling should include, along with the
trademark name of the type A medicated article used, the established names of
the active drug ingredients.<P>
The inquirer was further advised that CVM has no objection to the
franchised use of trademarks or brand (trade) names of active drug ingredients
elsewhere on the label of a medicated feed, provided that when viewed in its
overall context such use would not serve to misbrand the product.  CVM would
not concur in the use of these names in lieu of the required established name
in the label statement of active drug ingredients or in any other listing of
ingredients or in any statement of guaranteed analysis.  Finally, in the event
that a type A medicated article contains two or more drug ingredients, each of
which has its own trademark or brand (trade) name, which differs from the brand
(trade) name of the article, the names of the drug ingredients which accompany
the product name of the medicated feed on the label must be only the
established names.<P>
This position conforms completely with the model feed law and regulations,
and the labeling guidelines adopted by the Association of American Feed Control
Officials, Inc. (AAFCO), as set forth in their <i>Official Publication</i> and
enacted into law by most states.<P>
POLICY:<P>
When so franchised, medicated animal feed labels may bear the trademark or
brand (trade) name of their active drug ingredients so as to be fully
informative to the purchaser as to the source of the drug used.  They may only
be used in the product name of the medicated feed in a manner which is not
misleading.  They may not be used in lieu of the established drug name in the
statement of active drug ingredients or in any other ingredient or guaranteed
analysis statement.<P>

<H3>CGMP Regulations for Medicated Feeds - Daily Inventory Requirements</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.19)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
Under the "Second Generation Medicated Feeds" final rule published
in the <i>Federal Register</i> of May 3, 1986, new terminology, definitions,
and requirements for the need of approved medicated feed applications were
established.  The term "drug" is interpreted as referring only to type A
medicated articles since these articles are regulated as drugs.  Type A
products are intended solely for use in the manufacture of type A, B, or C
products.  Type B products are regulated as feeds, not as drugs.  Type B
products are intended solely for the manufacture of other medicated feeds.  Both type A medicated articles and type B medicated feeds may be used in
the manufacture of other type B or type C medicated feeds.  Type C products are
medicated feeds fed directly to animals, as finished, complete feeds. Category
II type A medicated articles have a higher potential of causing significant
residues in human food derived from animals than Category I type A medicated
articles.  Drugs in Category I have no withdrawal periods at the lowest use
level in each species for which they are approved.  Drugs in Category II have
withdrawal periods at the lowest use level, or are regulated on a "no residue"
basis, or with a "zero" tolerance because of carcinogenic concerns (21 CFR
558.3).  Only the use of Category II type A medicated articles in the
manufacture of medicated feeds require approved medicated feed
applications.<P>
The final rule also establishes two separate CGMP regulations applicable to
medicated feed manufacturers.  CGMP regulations in 21 CFR225.10 through
225.115 apply only to facilities manufacturing one or more medicated feeds for
which an approved medicated feed application is required.  Therefore, these
CGMP regulations, which include the daily inventory requirements of 21 CFR
225.42, apply only to those facilities using a Category II type A medicated
article to manufacture a medicated feed.<P>
Manufacturers using solely Category I type A medicated articles and/or type
B medicated feeds to manufacture medicated feeds are exempt from the need of
approved medicated feed applications.  Manufacturers that use only these
medicated products are required to be in compliance with a separate set of less
restrictive CGMP regulations 21 CFR 225.120 through 225.202.  There has been
confusion concerning the daily inventory requirements of the CGMP regulations
(21 CFR 225.42) which are applicable to the use of Category II type A medicated
articles.  This CPG clarifies the requirements of this CGMP section.<P>
POLICY:<P>
The daily inventory requirements of 21 CFR 225.42 are applicable to
Category II type A medicated articles used in the manufacture of medicated
feeds.  The term "daily" means each day a Category II type A medicated article
is in use.  Daily inventory records should show when and which Category II type
A medicated article was used, how much was used, and how much remains after
each use.<P>
When a feed manufacturer uses both Category I type A medicated articles and
Category II type A medicated articles, the daily inventory requirements of 21
CFR 225.42 will apply to the use of all type A medicated articles.  The 21 CFR
225.42 daily inventory requirements do not apply to type B medicated feeds used
in the manufacture of other medicated feeds.  <P>

<b>(CPG 7125.18)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
EDDI has been incorporated into animal feed and drug products for many
years for both nutritional and therapeutic purposes. It has been formulated in
salt/mineral mixtures and in liquids and powders for adding to feed or drinking
water. EDDI has been used as a supplemental source of iodine and is considered
generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for nutritional purposes when used at
levels consistent with good feeding practices (21 CFR 582.80).  EDDI products
also have been marketed with claims for the treatment and prevention of certain
diseases in several animal species, but primarily for "foot rot," soft tissue
"lumpy jaw" and "wooden tongue" in cattle. However, all such EDDI products
(including feeds) bearing therapeutic claims now are considered adulterated
under sections 501(a)(5) or 501(a)(6) of the act.<P>
On August 2, 1976, FDA published a regulation, 21 CFR 510.455, which
concluded that incorporating a drug into a medicated block causes the drug (and
the medicated block) to become a new animal drug for which an approved
application is required. A new animal drug application related to the use of
EDDI in medicated blocks at 50 mg/hd/day for prevention of "foot rot" in cattle
was submitted to FDA. However, the data were inadequate, and the application
was not approved.  Thus, there are no approved animal drug uses for EDDI in
medicated blocks. As a general rule salt blocks containing 0.17% EDDI are
intended to provide 50 mg/hd/day of EDDI.<P>
Based on the 1984 National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council
(NAS/NRC) monograph, "Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle" and the 1978
NAS/NRC monograph, "Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle," CVM considers 10
mg/hd/day of EDDI to be an appropriate maximum level to be recommended on
labeling of EDDI-containing products intended for routine supplementation of
iodine in the diet of both beef and dairy cattle.<P>
POLICY:<P>
All animal products containing EDDI that bear claims for treatment or
prevention of any animal disease (other than the prevention of iodine
deficiency) are considered unapproved new animal drugs or feeds bearing or
containing unapproved new animal drugs and are adulterated under section
501(a)(5) or section 501(a)(6) of the act, respectively. <P>
Cattle products labeled or formulated to provide 50 mg/hd/day of EDDI or
higher are considered to be animal drugs misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of
the act, even in the absence of disease treatment or prevention claims on
labels/labeling.  Depending upon the marketing history of the specific product
it may also be considered adulterated under sections 501(a)(5) or 501(a)(6).
<P>
Cattle products that are labeled or formulated to provide between 10
mg/hd/day and 50 mg/hd/day of EDDI, whether or not they bear claims for disease
treatment or prevention, may be adulterated drugs or feeds under sections
501(a)(5) or (a)(6), misbranded drugs under section 502(f)(1), or adulterated
foods under section 402(a)(2)(C), or misbranded foods under section 403(a). The
specific violation(s) that may be charged will be dependent on marketing
history and labeling of the products. <P>
REGULATORY ACTION GUIDANCE: <P>
Because of the marketing history of EDDI products, the agency will
implement a two tiered regulatory approach: <P>
1. Primary attention will be directed initially toward: <P>
   (a)  all animal products labeled with therapeutic claims regardless of
the level of EDDI, and, <P>
   (b)  cattle products formulated to provide 50 mg/hd/day or more
regardless of whether or not they bear therapeutic claims. <P>
2. Action will be considered on a case by case basis for all cattle
products containing between 10 mg/hd/day and 50 mg/hd/day with no therapeutic
claims. Enforcement decisions relative to products in this category will
require an evaluation of the product's past marketing history, quantitative
formula, labeling, promotional material establishing intended use, and a
consideration of prior warnings and the firms willingness to achieve voluntary
compliance. <P>
This CPG applies to all EDDI products introduced or delivered for
introduction into interstate commerce on or after September 1, 1986.<P>

  <H3> Compounding of Drugs for Use in Animals</H3>
<hr>
COMPLIANCE POLICY GUIDE
<br>
CHAPTER - 6
<br>
SUB CHAPTER - 600
<br>

BACKGROUND:<P>

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) does not distinguish compounding from
manufacturing or other processing of drugs for use in animals.  However, veterinarians and
pharmacists do manipulate drugs (e.g., combine or dilute finished dosage forms, prepare finished
dosage forms from bulk drug substances, or prepare injectables from powdered oral dosage
forms) to obtain products that differ from the starting materials.  
<P>
There is a potential for causing harm to public health and to animals when drug products are
compounded, distributed, and used in the absence of adequate and well-controlled safety and
efficacy data, adherence to the principles of contemporary pharmaceutical chemistry and current
good manufacturing practices. 
<P>
The Agency acknowledges the use of compounding within certain areas of veterinary practice.
The practice of veterinary medicine requires products to treat many conditions in a number of
different species, some of which have unique physiological characteristics.  FDA, other federal,
state agencies, and producer groups encourage drug sponsors to obtain approvals for all new
animal drugs. 
<P>
While the Agency acknowledges the use of compounding under certain circumstances, it is also
aware of adverse reactions and animal deaths caused by compounded drug products and is
concerned about the risks associated with compounding practices in veterinary medicine.  An
example is the recent death of cattle due to the presence of endotoxin in a parenteral product
prepared from spectinomycin approved for oral use. In addition, the Agency is greatly concerned
about pharmacies that produce large quantities of unapproved new animal drugs that are
essentially copies of FDA-approved products. These pharmacy products are actively advertised
and promoted, and sometimes are priced lower than the approved product.  The firms claim that
they are practicing within the scope of their state licenses.  However, it is apparent that some of
these firms use their pharmacy licenses to circumvent the entire drug approval process, and are
mass marketing products which have been produced with little or no quality control,
manufacturing standards to ensure purity, potency and stability. 
<P>
The pharmacokinetics and depletion times for residues from compounded products are not
known and the assigning of extemporaneous withdrawal times may result in potentially harmful
residues in food.  Excipients and vehicles from unapproved or unknown origins may pose
additional risks. 
<P>
Section 510(g)(1) of the Act exempts from the registration requirements licensed pharmacies
which do not compound drugs except exclusively within the regular course of their business of
dispensing or selling drugs at retail.  Section 510 (g)(2) exempts from the registration
requirements licensed practitioners who manufacture, prepare, propagate, compound, or process
drugs during the regular course of business of dispensing drugs at retail. The Act and regulations
do not, however, exempt such practitioners or pharmacists from the approval requirements in the
new animal drug provisions of Sections 501(a)(5) and 512.  Therefore, compounding allowed
under the Act is limited to the preparation of drug products which do not meet the definition of
new animal drugs.  In the absence of an approved new animal drug application (NADA), the
compounding of a new animal drug from any article, including an approved or unapproved
finished human or animal drug, or a bulk drug, results in an adulterated new animal drug in
violation of section 501(a)(5). 
<P>
Compounding from Approved Dosage Form Drugs: When the Animal Medicinal Drug Use
Clarification Act of 1994 (AMDUCA) goes into effect, it will allow the "extra-label" use of
approved animal and human drugs. It will also allow compounding from those approved drugs.
Under AMDUCA "extra-label" use, including compounding, will be subject to conditions
specified by regulation.  AMDUCA will become effective upon promulgation of the  regulations. 
The scope of compounding made legal upon the effective date of AMDUCA will also be
addressed by the regulations.  The proposed regulations were published in the Federal Register
on  May 17, 1996.  They have no effect until finalized.
<P>
Compounding from Bulk Drugs:  Two Federal Appeals Court decisions, United States v. Algon
Chemical Inc., 879 F.2d 1154 (3d Cir. 1989), United States v. 9/1 Kg.  Containers, 854 F.2d 173
(7th Cir. 1988), affirmed the FDA position that the Act does not permit veterinarians to
compound unapproved finished drug products from bulk drugs, unless the finished drug is not a
new animal drug. The principle established by the court applies equally to compounding by
pharmacists.  However, one of the courts acknowledged the Agency's policy that, if the need is
great and the risk small, the Agency may exercise regulatory discretion with respect to
veterinarians compounding from approved drugs under Compliance Policy Guide (CPG)
615.100, Extra-label Use of New Animal Drugs in Food-Producing Animals. <P>
DEFINITIONS:
<P>
The Act and accompanying regulations do not define compounding as different from other
processing of drug compounds.
<P>
Bulk drug is an active ingredient (in unfinished form) intended for manufacture into finished
dosage form drug products (from United States v. Algon Chemical Inc., 879 F.2d 1154 (3d Cir.
1989)).  See also 21 CFR 207.3 (a) (4).  Bulk drugs (or "bulk drug substances") may be supplied
in various size containers and may or may not meet USP standards. 
Compounding is defined, for the purposes of this CPG, as any manipulation to produce a dosage
form drug other than that manipulation that is provided for in the directions for use on the
labeling of the approved drug product, for example, the reconstitution of a sterile powder with
sterile water for injection. 
<P>
Compounding ordinarily not subject to regulatory action, is defined as compounding by a
licensed pharmacist or veterinary practitioner, when the criteria described in this document are
met, within the confines of a legitimate practice.  However, this document shall not be construed
to bind the FDA or otherwise constrain its enforcement discretion.  In addition, this document
imposes no new obligations. 
<P>
Compounding subject to regulatory action, is defined as compounding by a licensed pharmacist
or other practitioner, when the criteria described in this document are not met, even if it is
otherwise within the confines of a legitimate practice.  Compounding outside the confines of a
legitimate pharmacy or veterinary practice, whether by a pharmacist, veterinarian or other party,
is subject to regulatory action. 
<P>
"Legitimate practice" is defined as follows:
<P>
(a)  Pharmacist: A person licensed and operating in conformity with state law, and dispensing in
response to a valid prescription.
<P>
(b)  Veterinarian: A person licensed and operating in conformity with state law, and prescribing
or dispensing in response to a valid Veterinarian-Client-Patient Relationship (VCPR.)  

<P>
Valid Veterinarian-Client-Patient Relationship (VCPR)
<P>
A valid VCPR exists when: (1) the veterinarian assumes the responsibility for making medical
judgments regarding the health of the animal(s) and the need for medical treatment, and the client
(owner or other caretaker) agrees to follow the instructions of the veterinarian; and (2) the
veterinarian has sufficient knowledge of the circumstances to initiate at least a general or
preliminary diagnosis of the medical condition of the animal(s), i.e., the veterinarian has recently
seen and is personally acquainted with the keeping and care of the animal(s) by virtue of an
examination of the animal(s), and/or by medically appropriate and timely visits to the premises
where the animal(s) are kept; and (3) the practicing veterinarian is readily available for follow-up
in case of adverse reactions or failure of the regimen of therapy.  Source: American Veterinary
Medical Association.
<P>
POLICY:
<P>
Circumstances exist when it may be necessary for a veterinarian to compound, or direct for a
pharmacist to compound, an article that will result in an unapproved new animal drug.  There is
occasionally a need to utilize drugs labeled for human use, and much less commonly, bulk drug
substances, for compounding into an appropriate dosage form.  Some examples of these
situations include: combinations of anesthetic drugs for titrated administration; preparation of
dilute dosage forms for small, young, or exotic species patients; and usage of some antidote
preparations.  The Agency will exercise regulatory discretion and ordinarily would not take
regulatory action against violations of the Act resulting from compounding an unapproved new
animal drug if a determination is made that, in order to provide appropriate medical therapy, it is
necessary to compound a new animal drug when the following conditions are met: 
<P>
(1)  A legitimate medical need is identified (the health of animals is threatened and suffering or
death would result from failure to treat the affected animals), 
<P>
(2)  There is a need for an appropriate dosage regimen for the species, age, size, or medical
condition of the patient,
<P>
     and
<P>
(3)  There is no marketed approved animal drug which, when used as labeled or in an
"extra-label" manner in conformity with criteria listed in CPG 615.100, or human-label drug,
when used in conformity with criteria listed in CPG 608.100, may treat the condition diagnosed
in the available dosage form, or there is some other rare extenuating circumstance. (For example,
the approved drug cannot be obtained in time to treat the animal(s) in a timely manner, or there is
a medical need for different excipients.) 
<P>
After making the above determinations, the following criteria should  be met and precautions
observed: <P>

(1)  Dispensing by a licensed veterinarian; or the receipt of a valid prescription of a licensed
veterinarian by a pharmacist.  Dispensing should be within the confines of a valid
veterinarian-client-patient relationship.  Veterinarians should exercise professional judgment to
determine when compounding requires the services of a pharmacist.  Professional assistance is
appropriate when the complexity of compounding exceeds the veterinarian's knowledge, skill,
facilities, or available equipment. 
<P>
(2)  The veterinarian takes measures to ensure that:
<P>
     (a)  When used in food-producing animals: no illegal residues occur; a significantly extended
time period is assigned for drug withdrawal; and steps are taken to assure that the assigned time
frames are observed;
<P>
     (b)  The safety and efficacy of the compounded new animal drug is consistent with current
standards of pharmaceutical and pharmacological practices, e.g., known incompatibilities are
avoided; <P>

     (c)  Appropriate steps are taken to minimize risk of personnel exposure to potentially harmful
ingredients in the preparation process; and
<P>
     (d)  Procedures are instituted to assure that appropriate patient records for the treated animals
are maintained.
<P>
(3)  All drugs dispensed to the animal owner by the veterinarian or a pharmacist, bear labeling
information which is adequate to assure proper use of the product.  The following label
information should be included: 
<P>
     (a)  Name and address of the veterinary practitioner;       
<P>
     (b)  the active ingredient or ingredients;
<P>
     (c)  the date dispensed and the expiration date, which should not exceed the length of the
prescribed treatment except in cases where the veterinarian can establish a rationale for a later
expiration date; 
<P>
     (d)  directions for use specified by the practitioner, including the class/species or
identification of the animals; and the dosage, frequency, route of administration, and duration of
therapy; 
<P>
     (e)  cautionary statements specified by the veterinarian and/or pharmacist (this would include
all appropriate warnings necessary to ensure safety of human operators handling the finished
drug, especially if there are potential hazards of exposure to any components);  
<P>
     (f)  the veterinarian's specified withdrawal/discard time(s) for meat, milk, eggs, or any food
which might be derived from the treated animal(s) (while the veterinarian must set the
withdrawal time, the veterinarian in doing so may use relevant information provided by a
dispensing pharmacist although the veterinarian retains ultimate responsibility); 
<P>
     (g)  if dispensed by a licensed pharmacist, the name and address of the dispenser, serial
number and date of order or its filing;
<P>
     (h)  if dispensed by a veterinarian, the serial number; and  
<P>
     (i)  any other applicable requirements of state or federal law.  
<P>
(4)  The pharmacist adheres to the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy Good
Compounding Practices (GCP), or to equivalent state good compounding practice regulations,
except where provisions conflict with this CPG.  Among other practices, pharmacists should
keep records of compounding formulas, logs of compounded items and specific ingredients,
record of assurance of quality of raw materials; and information on adverse effects and product
failures.  Pharmacists should label compounded products with expiration dates that do not exceed
the prescribed period of treatment, and with withdrawal times furnished by the prescribing
veterinarian.
<P>
Veterinarians and pharmacists who compound or prescribe compounded medicaments and
pharmacists who compound medicaments according to these guidelines criteria set out above
would be considered to be engaged in extemporaneous compounding not ordinarily subject to
regulatory action. 
<P>
REGULATORY ACTION GUIDANCE:
<P>
Investigations will be conducted in coordination with state officials as specified in the October
26, 1995 letter from Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs (FDA) and Executive
Director, National Boards of Pharmacy, to state pharmacy and drug regulatory officials, and
FDA officials. 
<P>
FDA actions based on violative conditions will be consistent with state laws and regulations to
the extent possible.  Deviations from GCP may be deferred to state authorities for action.  In
general, the agency will place its highest regulatory priority on compounding products for use in
food animals.
<P>
A.   The following situations would likely indicate compounding subject to regulatory action and
the existence of one or more would ordinarily be of high regulatory priority.  
 <P>
     -Preparation for sale of large quantities of unapproved new animal drugs on an ongoing basis
and where no valid medical need or VCPR exists.  Compounding very limited quantities in
anticipation of future need is acceptable provided that a history of past need can be documented; 
 <P>
     -Compounding of medicaments that are essentially similar to FDA-approved products except
in rare instances where a legitimate need can be established, for example,  to treat animals on a
timely basis or to avoid problems caused by certain excipients.  
<P>
     -Substitution or recommendation by a pharmacist of a compounded medicament for a
prescription instead of using an FDA-approved product;
<P>
     -Compounding from bulk drugs for use in food animals, with the rare exception of those
medicaments that are permitted to be compounded by the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM)
through compassionate regulatory discretion or other means (such as certain antidotes, large
volume electrolyte products and other substances).  Because these items may be revised, an
official contact office at CVM has been designated to provide current information.  That contact
office is HFV-236, Case Guidance Branch, Division of Compliance, (301) 594-1785. 
<P>
     -Preparation for sale of unapproved new animal drugs on any scale which employ fanciful or
trade names, colorings or other additives, or in any way imply that the products have some
unique effectiveness or composition;
<P>
     -Advertising, promotion, display, sale, or other means of marketing, prepared unapproved
new animal drugs; and soliciting business to compound specific drug products, product classes or
therapeutic classes of drug products;
<P>
     -Offering compounded medicaments at wholesale to other state licensed veterinarians or
pharmacists or other commercial entities for resale;
     <P>
     -Offering financial incentives such as rebates and consulting fees; and  
<P>
     -Dispensing of large quantities of compounded medicaments, where questions of stability of
the finished product would arise;
<P>
     -Failing to follow good compounding practices, including current standards of pharmaceutical
and pharmacological practices, as described above;
<P>
     -Labeling a product with an expiration date that exceeds the prescribed treatment period;  
<P>
     -Labeling a product with a withdrawal time established by the pharmacist instead of the
veterinarian;      
<P>
     -Dispensing a disproportionate amount of compounded products out of state.  The primary
concern is the difficulty of maintaining proper relationships, for example,
pharmacist/veterinarian/client and VCPR.  Rare instances of specialized compounding to meet
emergency needs would not be considered disproportionate.  
<P>
B.   The following situations would indicate excessive risk to public health or to animals, or an
otherwise adverse risk/benefit ratio, of high regulatory priority: 
<P>
     -Instances where illegal residues occur in meat, milk, eggs, honey, or aquaculture products
and the residues were caused by the use of a compounded drug in association with the violation
being investigated; 
<P>
     -Compounding of medicaments for food-producing animals, especially those used in lactating
dairy animals, which cause a significant risk of illegal residues because, for example,
withholding times have not  been established by the veterinarian using adequate scientific
information; and 
<P>
     -Preparation of drug products that are essentially similar to products that have been removed
from the market due to regulatory concerns, for example, chloramphenicol, dimetridazole, DES
in food animals. 
<P>
C.   The following activities would indicate  compounding subject to regulatory action, and
possibly of high regulatory priority.  However, guidance from CVM should be solicited to assess
the potential public health threat and/or animal safety ( i. e.,  risk vs benefits). 
<P>
     -Instances where animals have been harmed or their safety unnecessarily compromised, such
as compounding a nonsterile product for parenteral or ophthalmic administration where a sterile
product is indicated, or other instances of not adhering to good compounding practices.  
<P>
     -Compounded substances that do not bear the required label information, including the name
of the authorizing veterinarian, the active ingredients, directions for use, cautionary statements,
and withdrawal times. 
<P>
D.   The following compounding situations would not ordinarily be considered for regulatory
action.  Appropriate state and local practice and pharmacy laws must be adhered to, however. 
  <P>
     -Compounding for non-food animals and minor food animal  uses where public health and
animal safety have not been threatened, and are of great need and small risk.  This would include
such common practices as: veterinarians' combining agents for anesthesia, large volume
parenterals, preparing appropriate dosage-forms for the size of the patient in question,
"animal-side" compounding, and other similar common practices that are widely accepted in the
day to day treatment of animal patients. 
<P>
     -Compounding from bulk drug substances for use in nonfood animals, including animals in
public and private aquaria, when  animal health is not threatened, and there is not a significant
risk of diversion of the bulk drugs or compounded drugs for use in food animals.  Bulk drug
substances would ordinarily be expected to be in small packages that meet or exceed USP
standards; see definition of "bulk drugs" above.  Compounding should be performed in
accordance with current standards of pharmaceutical practice (including referral to compendial
monographs or established pharmacy textbooks).
<P>
If circumstances exist on a case-by-case basis that indicate otherwise, the Field should request
guidance from CVM before considering regulatory action.  The preceding is not intended to be a
complete list of activities relating to compounding; there may be other factors which are
appropriate when assessing an individual case. 
<P>
GUIDANCE FOR CHARGING VIOLATIONS: 
<P>
A warning letter is ordinarily the first choice of action, when referral to state authorities is not
appropriate.  Injunction would be the usual choice of court action, although seizure should be
considered in the case of high priority drugs such as chloramphenicol or DES intended for use in
food animals.  Criminal action can be considered in egregious situations. 
<P>
Compounded drugs subject to regulatory action under this policy will ordinarily be charged as
unapproved new animal drugs, violative under Section 501(a)(5).  Deviations from GCP, if not
subject of state action will ordinarily be charged under Section 501(a)(2)(b).  The tissue residue
violations are covered under Section 402 (a) (2) (D).

<H3>Nutritional Supplements for Companion Animals</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.04)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
The *Center for* Veterinary Medicine is often asked to comment on the
status under the Act of products intended for the nutritional supplementation
of foods for animals.  Such products would include vitamins, minerals, protein
supplements, and fatty acid sources.  The diets of livestock, poultry and
fur-bearing animals are usually planned by nutritionists or other experts, and
the nutritional ingredients are sold through industrial channels.  On the other
hand, nutritionalsupplements for companion animals such as cats, dogs and 
horses not intended for food, as well asother pets, are
mostly sold over-the-counter directto lay customers and are generally
intended merelyfor the dietary supplementation of the particular species 
for which they are intended.<P>
Malnutrition, with the exception of obesity, isinfrequent in
companion animals.  Most receiveample nutrition to sustain healthy life
through theirregular daily diet.  Most dog and cat foods are likewise rich 
n nutrients either through the naturalcontent of the
ingredients or because ofmanufacturer supplementation.<P>
Animals on balanced rations do not require extranutritional
supplementation; in fact, excessiveamounts of certain nutrients may
cause healthproblems.  Nevertheless, *CVM* does not objectto
the OTC marketing of dietary supplements intablet, capsule, powder, or
liquid form forcompanion animals similar to the special dietary preparations 
sold for humans.  We have, however,advised that such
products should providemeaningful amounts of each of the nutrients
theyare represented to contain and these nutrientsshould be of
known value for the intended ortarget animal.<P>
The nutritional needs of animals do not necessarilyparallel
those of humans.  For instance, only a fewspecies are known to require
Vitamin C in theirdiet.  As most animals either receive adequate amounts of 
vitamins, minerals, protein (essentialamino acids), fat
(fatty acids) and carbohydrate intheir diet or are able to synthesize
them from aration balanced to observe National ResearchCouncil
nutrient requirements, we are not awarethat supplementation would serve
a usefulpurpose. FDA has published no regulationconcerning the
vitamin, mineral, or other dietaryproperties as special dietary
products for animalsas contemplated by section 403(j). In arriving at
alevel of supplementation which represents the bestinformation
presently available, FDA uses TheNutritional Requirements of Domestic
Animals, astandard test published by the National Academyof
Sciences-National Research Council.  We haveusually accepted as
adequate those productsproviding a meaningful level of nutrition
whencompared with the NAS/NRC recommendations.<b>  </b><P>
These products should not be misbranded by anydirect or
implied therapeutic or other claims for special benefits from their use.  This
would include representations for the products as a tonic, conditioner or toner
which is proscribed by 21 CFR*.  Nor should they bear such vague therapeutic
suggestions as promotion of "health," "stamina," "strength," or that they are
of any special value for breeding purposes or for show or racing purposes or
for working animals, or that by virtue of their formulation "i.e., "chelated,"
"timed release," "natural") they are superior to the ordinary vitamin-mineral
preparations of commerce.  We would consider animal nutritional supplements to
be adulterated if they contain upon analysis significantly more or
significantly less of label declaration of a nutrient which could effect the
health of the target animal.  Further, nutritional supplements should contain
no drugs or unsafe food additives, either as direct or indirect ingredients.
Guidance in individual cases may be obtained from HFV-236. <P>
Nutritional supplements marketed in injectable form are considered to be
drugs and are not purview to this guide.  As drugs, their status as new animal
drugs must be resolved on a case by case basis. <P>
POLICY: <P>
The *Center for* Veterinary Medicine will not generally object to the
marketing of nutritional supplements for oral administration to companion
animals provided they conform to the following restrictions: <P>
1. There is a known need for each nutrient ingredient represented to be in
the product for each animal for which the product is intended. <P>
2. The label represents the product for use only in supplementation of and

<H3>Large Volume Parenterals (LVP's) for Animal Use</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.31)</b><P>
Large volume parenterals or LVPs (sometimes called large volume injections)
are aqueous solutions usually supplied in volumes of at least 100 ml with sizes
of 250 ml, 500 ml, and 1000 ml most common.  Directions usually recommend that
large quantities be administered.  The usual route of administration is
intravenous (IV) but other routes, such as intraperitoneal (IP) or subcutaneous
(SQ or SC), are sometimes recommended. <br>
Examples of LVPs include: <P>
   o Calcium solutions <br>
   o Sodium chloride, Ringer's, sodium bicarbonate and other electrolyte
solutions <br>
   o Dextrose (glucose) and other sugar solutions <br>
   o Amino acid, peptide and other protein-fraction solutions <br>
   o Solutions containing a combination of the above, sometimes with
vitamins added <br>
   o Dextrans, and other plasma expanders <P>
All parenterals for animal use including LVPs must be sterile.* <P>
Preservatives (antimicrobial agents) are not permitted in LVPs in the
absence of an approved NADA that specifically establishes the safety of the
preservative, in a particular product.  If a preservative were to be added to
an LVP in a concentration adequate to prevent the multiplication of
microorganisms, an animal could receive a toxic dose of the preservative
because of the large amount of solution administered.  Based on limited animal
toxicity and epidemiological data it appears that at least one preservative
commonly used in small volume parenterals, benzyl alcohol, can be toxic, even
fatal, to animals when used in LVPs. <P>
Antimicrobial agents are permitted in multiple dose containers where the
preservatives are added to protect the products from inadvertent microbial
contamination during multiple entry and subsequent storage.  Only a small
amount of such a product is injected into any particular animal.<P>
LVPs should be supplied in container sizes appropriate for their intended
use or uses so that the majority of the contents would ordinarily be used
promptly following initial entry.  Too large a container size relative to
intended use would encourage retention of unused contents which could result in
microbial contamination of a product containing no preservatives.  Labeling of
LVPs should clearly indicate the lack of preservatives and should promote use
of contents promptly following initial entry and disposal of unused contents.
The concentration of individual ingredients should be clearly expressed.  If
the product is not a compendial item or the physiologic parameters are not
otherwise clearly defined, the label should bear an indication of the pH and
osmolarity (tonicity) of the solution.<P>
Labeling should in all other respects bear adequate directions for use and
not be false or misleading in any particular.<P>
POLICY:<P>
Large volume parenterals must be:<P>
   1) Sterile.<br>
   2) Free of preservatives.<br>
   3) Supplied in sizes appropriate to label claims facilitating use of the
contents promptly following initial entry.<br>
   4) Labeled to indicate that:  a) they contain no preservatives, b) they
are intended for use promptly following initial entry, and (c) any portions not
used promptly should be discarded.<br>
   5) Labeled to clearly indicate concentration of individual ingredients
and physiological parameters of the solution.<P>
LVPs that contain preservatives are considered new animal drugs and, in the
absence of an approved NADA, are deemed unsafe under section 512 of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the
Act. LVPs may also be considered new animal drugs for reasons other than the
presence of preservatives (e.g., due to other constituents of the formulation
or the claims made for the product).  LVPs which are not sterile (or which are
produced under unvalidated procedures) would violate 501(a)(2)(B), 501(b), or
501(c).  Failure to bear adequate labeling would result in violations of
502(a), 502(f)(1) or (2), among others. <P>
The *Center* will review labeling and batch records to determine compliance
with this policy.  Initial action will ordinarily be a *Warning letter* or, if
warranted by the circumstances, seizure. <P>
*Material between asterisks is new or revised.* <P>

<H3>Alternate Feeding of Different Medicated Feeds</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.36)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
Feedlots and other growers of food-producing animals sometimes adopt the
practice of separately feeding different medicated feeds, perhaps one in the
morning and a second in the afternoon, both containing drugs which, if in a
single feed, would require an approved medicated feed application.  This brings
into question drug safety and effectiveness, including the potential for
illegal residues, resulting from drug interference, potentiation, or other
factors. <P>
In some instances, medicated feed label directions for use are required to
specify that the medicated feed is to be fed as the sole ration.  In most
instances, however, medicated feed labels are silent on the issue. <P>
POLICY: <P>
The FDA does not approve of the practice of alternate feeding of different
medicated feeds, even when not specifically prohibited by the labeling of the
medicated feeds.  If this practice results in above tolerance tissue residues,
a violation of Section 402(a)(2)(D) occurs.  If a producer holding an approved
medicated feed application practices alternate feeding in opposition to
labeling approved for feeding as the sole ration, a violation of Section
512(m)(4) occurs and subjects the approved medicated feed application to
consideration of withdrawal proceedings if voluntary correction cannot be
obtained. <P>

<H3>Common or Usual Names for Animal Feed Ingredients</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.08)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
The Association of American Feed Control Officials, Inc. (AAFCO), is an
organization composed of officers of state and Federal governments responsible
for the execution of laws and regulations pertaining to the production and
labeling of animal feed.  A number of FDA employees are members of AAFCO which
exists to promote uniformity and clarity in feed law enforcement.  AAFCO *has
no legal mandate.* <P>
AAFCO annually publishes its <i>Official Publication</i>, a handbook which
contains, among other things, Official Feed Terms, which define many of the
terms commonly used in the feed manufacturing industry.  It also contains
Official and Tentative Definitions of Feed Ingredients, a codified set of
definitions for ingredients commonly used in animal feed.<P>
POLICY:<P>
The definitions, as they appear in the <i>Official Publication</i> of the
Association of American Feed Control Officials, Inc. (AAFCO), are generally
regarded as constituting the common or usual name for animal feed ingredients,
including pet food, as contemplated by 403(i)(1) and (2).  *Whenever ingredient
definition changes are contemplated by AAFCO, the Center for Veterinary
Medicine must concur in their suitability.*  Questions concerning specific
ingredient nomenclature or definitions should be submitted to the *Center for*
Veterinary Medicine (HFV-236) for resolution.<P>

<H3>Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) for Animal Use</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.23)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
DMSO is a by-product of the paper industry and is able to carry some drugs
rapidly through the skin.  Industrial grade DMSO is widely available for
various non-medical uses such as paint remover and antifreeze.  The *Center
for* Veterinary Medicine has received inquiries concerning the status of DMSO
for use in animals, probably prompted by the approval of DMSO for human use in
April 1978.  The product is a new animal drug with approved uses only in horses
and dogs (See 21 CFR 524.660, 524.981d and 524.981e).<P>
POLICY: <P>
DMSO used for any veterinary purposes other than approved uses reflected in
the CFR is a new animal drug without an approved new animal drug application
(NADA).  As such, it is adulterated under Section 501(a)(5) of the Act.
<P>
NOTE:  At least one state (Florida, Bill No. S. 699) has passed legislation
(1978) that prohibits interference with the use of DMSO. <P>

<H3>The Use of Antibiotic Drug Residue By-Products in Animal Feed</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.31)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
Mycelium presscake and other by-products of the production of antibiotic
drugs by fermentation of penicillium and streptomyces, as well as other mold
fermentation products, are widely sold in this country for use as ingredients
in animal feed.  They are defined in the official publication of the
Association of American Feed Control Officials.  We are also aware that small
amounts of mycelia and perhaps culture media do exist in so-called feed grade
antibiotic premixes. <P>
POLICY: <P>
We do not object to the use of mycelia and other by-products of mold
fermentation/antibioticpropagation in animal feeds provided the
antibioticactivity does not exceed two grams per ton ofcake and no more than
three pounds of cake isused per ton of animal feed.  This would
provideapproximately 0.002 ppm antibiotic activity to thefinal feed which we
consider to be insignificantand not to constitute a concern.  The labeling
ofthe animal feed must not make any claim for theantibiotic furnished by the
fermentation product.<P>

use in food-producing animals beforeAugust 24, 1982 (47 FR

<H3>Silage Ingredients</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG  7126.21)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
*CVM* has recently had to consider the status ofingredients
intended for use in silage.  Some ofthese are clearly intended for
pesticide use on rawagricultural commodities such as growing and otherwise unprocessed plant material.  These areregistered under
the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide,and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) by EPA.
EPA has alsoregistered some preservatives such as acetic and propionic acid for use on corn and grain beforeensiling.  EPA has
not registered any pesticides foruse on fermented
ensilage.<P>
While there is thus specific precedent for EPAapproval of
some silage additives, the largestportion now on the marketplace,
particularly thoseintended for use in silage for such uses as acidification aids, fermentation aids or for nutrientpurposes fall
under the jurisdiction of FDA.  Asilage ingredient is either generally
recognized assafe (GRAS) or, if not generally recognized as safe, a food additive which cannot be used unless thereis a regulation
for its safe use.  Therefore, a silageingredient may fall in one of the
followingcategories:<P>
1.   A pesticide or preservative subject to EPA jurisdiction<P>
2.   A GRAS food ingredient<P>
3.   A food additive requiring a regulation for safeuse and
legal marketing<P>
4.   An animal drug<P>
5.   A new animal drug<P>
Food additive regulations are promulgated andpublished in
the Federal Register on the basis ofscientific data and other
information submitted inthe form of a food additive petition (FAP).
TheFAP must contain data adequate to establish thatthe additive
is safe and will accomplish its intendedeffect in food (silage) whether
it be added for a nutritional, chemical, technical, or mechanical purpose.
Therefore, a food additive petition should have data to show that there is a
need for the additive for the purpose, and that it is safe at the lowest level
at which it accomplishes its intended effect in the target species.  The
concept of safety includes a showing that the additive leaves no unsafe
residues in edible products of animals. <P>
POLICY: <P>
A silage ingredient bearing therapeutic claims may be a new animal drug
requiring the approval of a new animal drug application (NADA) for the labeled
purposes.  Without the approved NADA the drug would be adulterated under
Section 501(a)(5) of the Act. <P>
A silage ingredient must either be GRAS (21 CFR*) or otherwise prior
sanctioned or must be the subject of an approved food additive petition for its
labeled purpose.  In either case, data should show that there is a need for the
additive for its intended purpose and that it is safe at the lowest level at
which it accomplishes its intended effect in the target species. The concept of
safety includes showing that the additive leaves no unsafe residues in edible
products of animals.  A food additive which does not meet these criteria is
adulterated under Section 402(a)(2)(C) of the Act in that it is unsafe within
the meaning of Section 409(a).  Also, making questionable claims for such
benefits as non-existent or exaggerated nutritional benefits, unwarranted
fermentation or other ensiling benefits, etc. would cause the silage ingredient
to be misbranded within the meaning of Section 403(a) of the Act. <P>
Silage ingredients registered by EPA as preservatives, which are not GRAS
and are not the subject of an approved food additive petition will be
considered by the *Center for* Veterinary Medicine on a case-by-case basis.

<H3>Status of Vitamins and Minerals in Type B and C Medicated Feed and in
Non-Medicated Feed</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.11)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
Poultry and livestock usually subsist entirely upon feeds scientifically
formulated to provide a diet complete with all known vitamin and mineral
requirements for maximum production.  Vitamins and minerals as well as other
nutrients are often provided to operators of feed mills in concentrated form to
facilitate mixing of medicated and non-medicated feed.  We have established no
regulations which set forth the optimum or required daily vitamin/mineral
intake for any animal species.  We are, however, guided in this regard by data
in the scientific literature and information appearing in such standard texts
as the Nutritional Requirements of Domestic Animals published by the National
Academy of Sciences - National Research Council or in other published
literature.  All medicated and non-medicated feeds should provide the target
species with adequate levels of each of the vitamins and minerals they are
labeled as containing in accordance with the published data. <P>
Beyond providing adequate nutritional levels of required vitamins and
minerals animal feed should not be misbranded by any direct or implied
therapeutic or other claim for special benefits from the nutritional content.
Nor should feeds be represented as tonic or conditioners or capable of
providing "stamina" or "strength" or for increasing milk or egg production or
butterfat content or bear any similar claims unless supported by the literature
or so approved. <P>
Animal feeds should be properly formulated so as to be safe for the animals
and so as not to produce unsafe tissue residues.  All nutritional additives in
feed should be either GRAS or the subject of a food additive regulation
prescribing their safe use.<P>
POLICY:<P>
The Center for Veterinary Medicine will not generally object to the
marketing of type B or type C medicated feeds or of non-medicated feeds
containing vitamins and minerals or other nutrients provided they conform to
the following guidelines:<P>
1.  The nutritional additives are either GRAS or the subject of a food
additive regulation describing their safe use.<P>
2.   The product provides vitamins and minerals or other nutrients it is
represented to contain at concentrations reasonably consistent with sound
nutritional practice for that species.<P>
3.   The labeling clearly states the common or usual name of each nutrient,
and is not otherwise false or misleading in any particular.<P>
4.   The labeling should bear no disease prevention or therapeutic claims,
including growth promotional representations attributed to the added
nutritional ingredients except where supportable by scientific data.<P>
5.   Finally, the product should neither be superpotent nor subpotent or
otherwise formulated so as to pose a hazard to the health of the target animal
or to humans consuming edible products derived from the target animal.<P>
While there is no formal compliance program concerning the vitamin-mineral
content of non-medicated feeds, appropriate regulatory action may be
recommended against seriously violative products.<P>

<H3>Canned Pet Food</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.18)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
Animal origin ingredients, including various poultry, meat and marine
products, are widely used in canned pet food as a source of protein.  These
ingredients should conform to the definitions promulgated by the Association of
American Feed Control Officials, Inc. (AAFCO), as published in their "Official
Publication," for feed control purposes. <P>
The pet food canning industry utilizes undecomposed animal and marine
tissues from various sources.  These include products of the rendering industry
such as various meat, poultry, and bone meals; meat scraps and offal from
packing house waste, freshly boned-out animals; and occasionally meat from
animals that may have died otherwise than by slaughter.  *Before processing
many of these commodities may be considered in violation of 401(a)(5),
however,* the *Center for* Veterinary Medicine *(CVM)* is aware of no instances
of disease or other hazard occurring from canned packing house offal or the
tissues of animals that may have died otherwise than by slaughter. <P>
The low acid canned food regulations (LACFRs) found in 21 CFR 507 are
applicable to canned pet foods.  When properly processed in accordance with

<H3>Biological Drugs for Animal Use</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.14)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
Animal biologicals are subject to both the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and
the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act (Public Law 430 of 1913, 73 Stat 832-833, 21 U.S.C.
151-158).  However, section 902(c) of the FD&amp;C Act states:  "Nothing
contained in this Act shall be construed as in any way effecting, modifying,
repealing, or superseding the provisions of ... the virus, serum, toxin, and
analogous products provisions of ... 37 Stat 832-833."  Animal biologicals are
not subject to the biologics provisions of the Public Health Service Act (42
U.S.C. 262).  The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), USDA
enforces the VST Act. <P>
The VST Act forbids the preparation, sale, barter, exchange, or shipment of
worthless, contaminated, dangerous or harmful animal biologicals in interstate
commerce.  It provides for licensure of products and establishments and
requires permits for the importation of animal biologicals. Regulations require
preparation of biologicals in accordance with an approved "Outline of
Production" so as to meet prescribed test requirements for purity, safety,
potency, and efficacy.  Regulations also require submission of all labeling and
claims to be made in advertising for approval.  Regulations pertaining to the
VST Act are found at 9 CFR 101-117. <P>
Animal biologicals produced and distributed in full conformance with the
VST are exempt from section 512 (see 21 CFR 510.4).  Licensing under the VST
Act is tantamount to registration and drug listing under section 510, and
registration and listing are not required for manufacturers of animal
biologicals which hold unsuspended and unrevoked licenses.  (See 21 CFR
207.65(g).)  However, all animal biological manufacturers unlicensed by the
USDA are required to register and list under Section 510 of the FD&amp;C Act.
Animal biologicals produced in accordance with the license and outline of
production are considered to be in compliance with good manufacturing practice
and would not be considered to be in violation of section 501(a)(2)(B).<P>
Animal biologicals are subject to sections 501 and 502 of the FD&amp;C Act,
with the exceptions of section 501(a)(2)(B), 501(a)(5) and 502(o).  Animal
biologicals in violation of the VST Act are subject to all provisions of the
FD&amp;C Act.  Intrastate animal biologicals may be subject to the FD&amp;C Act
if any of their components have moved in interstate commerce.<P>
The term biological is defined to mean "all viruses, serums, toxins and
analogous products of natural or synthetic origin, such as diagnostics,
antitoxins, vaccines, live microorganisms, killed microorganisms and the
antigenic or immunizing components of microorganisms intended for use in the
diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of diseases of animals."  (9 CFR
101.2(w)).<P>
POLICY:<P>
Districts should not inspect firms manufacturing only animal biologicals
unless such firms are unlicensed by the USDA because they do not market
finished products in interstate commerce.  Where a firm manufactures both
biologicals and non-biological animal drugs, inspection may include intrastate
biologicals not licensed by USDA.  If a manufacturer sells only in intrastate
commerce, but utilizes interstate components, the firm and its products are
subject to the FD&amp;C Act and may be inspected.  Districts may inspect
distributors of animal biologicals.  Animal biologicals imported without a
permit should be referred to local USDA officials for their action.<P>
When found in interstate commerce, animal biologicals which violate the
FD&amp;C Act are subject to regulatory action.  *CVM* Case Guidance Branch
(HFV-236) will consult as necessary with APHIS and otherwise keep them informed
of our actions. <P>
Violations of the VST Act should be referred to local USDA officials.
Although biologicals in violation of the VST Act become subject to certain
provisions of the FD&amp;C Act from which they were previously exempt (e.g.,
sections 510 and 512), any action under the FD&amp;C Act, in such cases, should
be initiated only in consultation with *CVM.* <P>

<H3>Proper Drug Use and Residue Avoidance by Non-Veterinarians</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.37)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
This Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) provides  regulatory guidance for the
development of cases resulting from the use of animal drugs contrary to label
directions ("extra-label use") by non- veterinarians in food-producing animals.
It also provides guidance on measures that can be taken by nonveterinarians to
ensure proper drug use and avoid illegal residues (See CPG 7125.06 (Sec.
615.100) for guidance on proper drug use by veterinarians).<P>
Extra-label use of drugs by nonveterinarians in food-producing animals is a
significant public health concern and a contributing factor in illegal residues
in edible animal tissue.  Such use of drugs is illegal under the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act).  Under the Act, virtually all drugs that are
intended for use in animals are subject to extensive pre-market approval
requirements.  New animal drugs (those drugs that are not generally recognized
as safe and effective for their labeled conditions of use) may not be legally
marketed unless they are the subject of an approved new animal drug application
(NADA).  A new animal drug that has not been approved is "unsafe" under Section
512 of the Act, and adulterated under Section 501(a)(5).<P>
The pre-market approval process ensures that when animal drugs are used in
accordance with the labeled directions (type of animal, medical conditions,
dosage, route of administration, and any other precautions or instructions for
the safe and effective use of the product, including withdrawal and milk
discard times) milk, eggs, and the edible tissues of slaughtered animals
treated with a drug will not contain potentially harmful or violative drug
residues.  The withdrawal time is the period following the last treatment with
the drug during which the animal may not be offered for slaughter and during
which products from this animal such as milk and eggs may not be offered for
sale.  The length of the withdrawal period is based upon the time necessary for
drug residues in the animal to deplete to levels that are shown to be
safe.<P>
The withdrawal period is based on residue studies conducted under the
labeled conditions of use (type of animal, dosage, route of administration) to
ensure that residues above levels that have been shown to be safe will not be
present in animal products used as human food.  Those levels, called tolerances
or safe concentrations, represent the amount of drug legally permitted in the
edible tissue of the animal.  The withdrawal period enables the animal to
metabolically reduce the drug level in its tissues to levels that are not of
public health concern.<P>
POLICY:<P>
A.   Use of Drug Products Contrary to Label Directions<P>
A new animal drug is "unsafe" under Section 512(a)(1) of the Act and
adulterated under Section 501(a)(5) when it is not used in accordance with its
approved label directions.  Therefore, use of an unapproved new animal drug or
of an approved new animal drug contrary to label directions constitutes a
violation of the Act.<P>
Use by veterinarians and nonveterinarians (e.g., livestock and poultry
producers, herdsmen, dealers, haulers, etc.) of veterinary drug products in
food-producing animals contrary to label directions is illegal.  Uses that are
contrary to label directions would include ignoring labeled withdrawal times or
milk discard times, using the product in a species not indicated on the label,
using the drug to treat a condition not indicated on the label, administering
the drug at a different dosage than stated on the label, or otherwise failing
to follow label directions for use and administration of the drug.<P>
FDA, in the exercise of its regulatory discretion, allows veterinarians,
acting in a valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship and in accordance
with the conditions outlined in CPG 7125.06 (See Sec. 615.100) ("Extra Label
Use of New Animal Drugs in Food-Producing Animals") to consider the use of a
new animal drug contrary to label directions when the health of the animal is
immediately threatened and suffering or death would result from failure to
treat the affected animal(s).  This policy applies only to licensed
veterinarians who administer, prescribe, or dispense drugs in accordance with
the policy guide and applicable state laws.  If the veterinarian does not
personally administer the drugs, certain labeling information is required, as
explained in CPG 7125.06 (See Sec. 615.100).  Also, no drug residues above
permitted levels may be present in the final food product whenever a drug is
used in an extra-label manner by a veterinarian.<P>
B.   Avoiding Drug Residues Through Proper Drug Use<P>
The presence in food of a residue of a new animal drug above permitted
levels causes the food to be adulterated under Section 402(a)(2)(D) of the Act.
The ability of persons who produce and sell food-producing animals and animal
products such as milk and eggs to have systems to monitor and control the use
of animal drugs is an indispensable adjunct to providing appropriate therapy
and is essential to avoiding illegal residues.  Such systems also enable
federal and state officials to monitor the food supply and ensure that it is
free of harmful drug residues.  Failure to establish and utilize such systems
can result in adulteration of live food-producing animals, for reasons
explained in the following paragraphs.<P>
The Act defines food as "(1) articles used for food or drink for man or
other animals... and (3) articles used for components of any such article."
[[section]]201(f). Food-producing animals, even though not in their final,
edible form, have been held to be food under the statute (<i>United States v.
Tomahara Enterprises Ltd.</i>, Food, Drug Cosm. L. Rep. (CCH) 38,217 (N.D.N.Y.
1983) (live calves intended as veal are food).  More generally, courts have
long held that unprocessed or unfinished articles are or can be food.  See
<i>Otis McAllister &amp; Co. v. United States</i>, 194 F.2d 386, 387 (5th Cir.
1952) and cases cited there (unroasted coffee beans are food).  Thus, FDA
regards live animals raised for food as "food" under the Act. <P>
Section 402(a)(4) provides that a food shall be "deemed" to be adulterated
"if it has been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions
whereby...it may have been rendered injurious to health."  The phrase
"insanitary conditions" in &szlig;402(a)(4) is not limited to filth or
bacteria.  Indeed, the courts have construed "insanitary conditions" in
&szlig;402(a)(4) to comprehend a variety of conditions that may render food
injurious to health.  See <i>United States v. Nova Scotia Food Products
Corp.</i>, 417 F. Supp. 1364, 1369-70 (E.D.N.Y. 1976), rev'd on other grounds,
568 F.2d 240 (2d cir. 1977); <i>United States v. 1200 Cans, Pasteurized Whole
Eggs</i>, 339 F. Supp, 131, 140-41 (N.D. Ga. 1972).  Thus, in the context of
holding food-producing animals, FDA believes that "insanitary conditions" could
include a lack of adequate controls concerning treatment of food-producing
animals with drugs. <P>
The "may have been rendered injurious to health" standard requires a
reasonable possibility of injury.  See <i>United States v. Lexington Mill &amp;
Elevator Co.</i>, 232,U.S. 399, 411 (1914); see also <i>Berger v. United
States</i>, 200 F.2d 818 (8th Cir. 1952).  In FDA's view, failure to maintain
adequate controls with respect to use of animal drugs could result in a
reasonable possibility of injury to human health because illegal drug residues
often result from a lack of such controls, and illegal drug residues could have
adverse toxicological effect on consumers, ranging from acute to chronic
reactions.  <P>
Under the circumstances described above, FDA may regard live animals raised
for food as adulterated under 402(a)(4). <P>
Persons involved in raising, handling, transporting, holding, and marketing
food-producing animals are encouraged to establish systems to ensure that
animal drugs are used properly and to prevent potentially hazardous drug
residues in edible animal products.  These control systems should include the
following measures: <P>
a)   Identifying and tracking animals to which drugs were administered, in
order to preclude the sale of edible animal tissue, milk, or eggs containing
illegal residues (identification may be by  specific animal identification, pen
or lot, quarantine/segregation, or other means); <P>
b)   Maintaining a system of medication/treatment records that, at a
minimum, identifies the animal(s) treated (individual animals, pens, lots,
etc.), the date(s) of treatment, the drug(s) administered, who administered the
drug(s), the amount administered, and the withdrawal time prior to slaughter
(and when milk, eggs, etc. can be used, if appropriate);<P>
c)   Properly storing, labeling, and accounting of all drug products and
medicated feeds;<P>
d)   Obtaining and using veterinary prescription drugs only through a
licensed veterinarian based on a valid veterinarian/client/patient
relationship; and<P>
e)   Educating all employees and family members involved in treating,
hauling, and selling the animals on proper administration techniques,
observance of withdrawal times, and methods to avoid marketing adulterated
products for human food.<P>
Establishing and maintaining such systems should help producers avoid
marketing milk, eggs, or edible animal tissue containing illegal residues and
avoid regulatory action based on Sections 402(a)(2)(D), 402(a)(4), or
501(a)(5).<P>
Persons who do not administer medications but who purchase or lease animals
for milking or sale for slaughter (such as livestock dealers) should also
establish and implement a record-keeping system.  This system should include
information on the source of the animal and whether the animal has been
medicated (when, with what drug, and the withdrawal period) to preclude
marketing of edible animal tissue, milk or eggs, that may contain illegal
residues. <P>
Such persons may also be subject to regulatory action if they market
animals containing illegal residues and have failed to take reasonable
precautions to prevent the sale of adulterated food.<P>
REGULATORY ACTION GUIDANCE:<P>
FDA investigators should determine the extent of the misuse of drugs in
food-producing animals during the course of their inspections or
investigations, such as when following up on an illegal tissue residue report
from United States Department of Agriculture/Food Safety and Inspection Service
or other information concerning improper drug use.  The occurrence of an
illegal tissue residue will be regarded as prima facie evidence of improper
drug use, and may be an appropriate subject for enforcement action.  Of course,
before recommending such action, FDA will also consider whether evidence of
proper drug usage, as described under the "Policy" section above, exists to
demonstrate that every reasonable effort has been made to preclude residues.
<P>
CVM is prepared to recommend regulatory action when drugs are misused as
described above.  If the misuse involves administration contrary to labeled
directions, the drug itself is adulterated under Section 501(a)(5).  If an
illegal residue is involved, the food is adulterated under Section
402(a)(2)(D).  Further, if an illegal residue is involved and inadequate
control measures are documented, the food (edible animal tissue, milk, or eggs)
may also be adulterated under Section 402(a)(4).  Except in egregious
situations, a Warning Letter is ordinarily the appropriate action of choice.
Compliance Program 7371.006, Illegal Drug Residues in Meat and Poultry,
provides additional regulatory guidance for illegal residues. <P>
Drug residues in milk should be handled according to Compliance Programs
7318.003, Milk Safety Program and 7371.008, National Drug Residue Milk
Monitoring Program. <P>

<B>Sec. 680.600</B><hr>
<H3>Sequencing as a Means to Prevent Unsafe Drug Contamination in the
Production, Storage, and Distribution of Feeds</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.35)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
Carryover of drugs from one batch or lot to the next batch or lot of feed
manufactured and handled in equipment at medicated feed mills and in bulk
delivery trucks is recognized as a problem in the feed industry.  Complete
breakdown and thorough cleaning of manufacturing and distribution equipment
following every batch of medicated feed is impractical.  Drug carryover may be
of little consequence if it does not constitute a hazard to the health of the
consuming animals or to humans consuming the edible products of these animals.
Factors to be considered in reaching such a determination include the toxicity
of the drug involved, the level of the drug carryover, and species and age of
animals for which the subsequent feed is intended. <P>
CGMP regulations, 21 CFR 225, recognize these facts and direct that
adequate steps be taken in the production of medicated feeds to prevent unsafe
contamination of animal feeds.  Unsafe contamination by animal drugs in
medicated or non-medicated animal feeds is defined as that level of drug
contamination in the animal feed which would result in an above tolerance
residue in the edible products of the consuming animal or which is injurious to
animals when the feed is fed as directed.  The level of drugs in animal feeds
which will constitute unsafe contamination may vary among species and ages of
consuming animals.  *<P>
* Each situation must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. <P>
Sequencing of the manufacture and handling of medicated feeds as a
method of preventing unsafe contamination is listed in 21 CFR 225.65 and may be
used under 21 CFR 225.165.  If properly planned and executed, it may be the
most practicable manner of dealing with the drug carryover problem under the
current state of feed manufacturing technology.  Sequencing is defined as the
preplanned order of production, storage, and distribution of different animal
feeds designed to direct drug carryover into subsequent feeds which will not
result in unsafe contamination.  The highest level of drug contamination
following a medicated feed occurs in the subsequent batch of feed handled or
processed in the equipment.  Therefore withdrawal and dairy cattle feeds should
never be mixed immediately after production of a medicated feed containing
category II drugs unless adequate measures are taken to prevent the carryover.
This principle applies in other instances as well, such as the production of
medicated feeds which pose special toxicity problems, e.g., monensin's toxicity
to horses.  Adequate measures to prevent carryover may include complete
physical cleaning of the entire system.  Since every system is unique, the firm
should take steps to establish procedures which will be adequate for their
operation to prevent unsafe contamination. The firm should have a plan
for reevaluating the sequencing procedures periodically to demonstrate that
unsafe contamination with drug residues is not occurring. <P>
The following are examples of acceptable principles to consider in
designing a sequencing procedure. <P>
1. Withdrawal and dairy cattle feeds should not be manufactured and
handled in the same equipment following medicated feeds containing category II
drugs, unless adequate cleaning procedures are followed.  Drugs with special
toxicity characteristics, such as monensin's toxicity to horses, require
special attention. <P>
2. Medicated feeds containing category II drugs may be followed by feed
intended for growing animals of the same species which are under market age or
weight. <P>
3. Feeds containing category II drugs may befollowed by
non-medicated supplements or concentrates or medicated top dressing
supplemental free choice type C feeds for growing animals of the same species
for which the prior feed was prepared.  These feeds do not constitute the sole
ration, so the level of any drug contamination would be further reduced either
in the final feed or through self-feeding of supplemental feed.<P>
4.   Feeds having a high potential for unsafe drug contamination
(withdrawal feeds, dairy feeds, etc.) should be manufactured first in the
sequence and the feeds with the most toxic drugs manufactured last in a
sequencing procedure, followed by complete physical clean-out of the
system.<P>
5.   The sequencing procedures and practices should be clearly understood
by all personnel responsible for medicated feed scheduling and production.
These should be readily available for their use as needed.<P>
POLICY:<P>
An appropriately designed sequencing plan is an acceptable means of
preventing unsafe contamination of medicated and non-medicated feeds with drug
residues.  The intent of this procedure is to prevent illegal residues in the
edible products from the animals consuming the contaminated feed and to prevent
injury to the consuming animals. *Warning* Letters are not indicated in drug
carryover contamination instances where the drug levels are not unsafe and
occur as the result of an appropriate predetermined plan.  *A warning letter is
appropriate if there is analytical or inspectional evidence that a category II
drug, in unsafe amounts, has been incorporated into the sequenced feed due to
lack of clean-out and sequencing controls.*<P>
*Material between asterisks is new or revised.*<P>

<H3>Use of Drug-Contaminated Products in Animal Feed</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.28)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
We have been requested to permit use of penicillin-contaminated nonfat dry
milk in the manufacture of animal feed. <P>
POLICY: <P>
We would consider the use of penicillin-contaminated nonfat dry milk as an
ingredient in a non-medicated feed as a violation of the FD&amp;C Act. <P>
A product contaminated with a drug, but otherwise suitable for use as an
ingredient in a feed, may not be used indiscriminately in a feed.  Use of such
a drug-contaminated product as a feed ingredient would be allowed only in a
feed which contains that specific drug at therapeutic or sub-therapeutic
(growth-promotion) levels.  The drug-contaminated product may then be used to
contribute to the feed an amount of drug up to the level approved for the feed.

<H3>Checklist Labeling for Custom Mixed Medicated Feeds</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.26)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
Questions often arise regarding the status of "checklist" type labeling for
custom mixed medicated feeds.  This type of label has been in common use by the
medicated feed industry for a number of years.  The *Center* has objected to
"checklist" labeling that lists multiple drugs, withdrawal periods and other
use instructions where the mill intends to *effect* proper labeling by manually
check marking the proper entries. <P>
For bulk medicated feeds, 21 CFR 225 allows a placard or other label to be
attached to the manufacturer's invoice or allows the invoice to be labeling for
these products, provided this labeling bears adequate directions for safe and
effective use.  The *Center for* Veterinary Medicine does not interpret this as
condoning "checklist" labeling of the kind described above for custom mixed
medicated feeds.  The *Center has considered* that "checklist" labels of the
type described above allow too much room for error since multiple entries have
to be filled out by hand on an individual basis. <P>
POLICY:<P>
For custom mixed medicated feed the *Center for* Veterinary Medicine
objects to the use of "checklist" type labeling containing multiple items
requiring entry of appropriate check marks.  However, for a product to be
deemed violative solely because of a "checklist" label, it must be shown that
an error on the particular label caused the violation(s). <P>
The *Center* does not object to the concept of "checklist" labeling where
the label lists a single drug or drug combination and a single withdrawal
period or other warning statement with the only checklist variable being drug
levels and use instructions as combined entries.  <P>
Violations of Sections 501(a)(2)(B) and 502(f)(1) would occur when labeling
of this kind is incorrectly checked by the manufacturer. <P>

<H3>Animal Grooming Aids</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.21)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
From time to time *CVM* receives inquiries concerning the status of
cosmetic articles intended for animal use.  The cosmetic definition in Section
201(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act refers only to the use of
such articles in man.  Therefore articles intended solely to cleanse or
beautify animals are not cosmetics within the meaning of 201(i) but are
commonly considered as "grooming aids."<P>
Where animal grooming aids are labeled or otherwise intended for
therapeutic purposes, they may be considered to be drugs.  This may occur when
a grooming aid is labeled to contain an active drug ingredient or to otherwise
suggest or imply a therapeutic benefit.<P>
POLICY:<P>
Grooming aid labeling bearing direct or implied therapeutic claims or
otherwise representing the product as a drug, such as by label reference to the
presence of an active ingredient, may be considered as a drug and perhaps new
animal drug as defined by Section 201(v) of the Act. <P>
Grooming aids for animals formulated and labeled only to cleanse or
beautify the animal are not subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act.<P>

<H3>Diversion of Adulterated Food to Acceptable Animal Feed Use</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.20)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
In the past, FDA has authorized the salvage of human or animal food
considered to be adulterated for its intended use by diverting that food to an
acceptable animal feed use.  Most of these instances have involved, but have
not been limited to, the interpretation of section 402(a)(3) and (4) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to allow different standards for foods
intended for human use vs. food intended for animal use, e.g., defect action
levels for filth in a food intended for human use but not for the same food
intended for animal feed use.  Diversion requests, however, have also included
USDA detained meat and poultry products contaminated with drug or other
chemical residues, as well as food and feed under voluntary industry recall or
quarantine that may be considered adulterated for their intended use(s).  To
assist in handling certain specific types of diversion requests, the Agency has
developed Compliance Policy Guide 7126.05.  [Diversion (after heat treatment)
of rodent, roach, or bird contaminated food for animal use.]  No single set of
criteria, however, can be prepared to cover diversion requests in all possible
situations.  This guide provides procedures for submitting requests to the
agency for authorization to divert adulterated foods for which no criteria have
been established. <P>
To facilitate handling, requests for diversion should be submitted in
writing to the appropriate FDA District Office.  The District will transmit the
requests to Division of Compliance, *Center for* Veterinary Medicine, HFV-230.
Each request should include the following information. <P>
a. Name and address of the requestor, and the name of the owner of the
subject articles. <P>
b. The precise physical location of the product. <P>
c. A precise identification of the product (including lot numbers, amount
of articles in each lot, etc.). <P>
d. The reason(s) the articles are considered adulterated for their
originally intended food uses. <P>
e. The levels, on a lot-by-lot basis, of any adulterant; all analytical
data regarding such levels of an adulterant, and the methodology used in
determining the levels of the adulterant. <P>
f. The cause of adulteration if known. <P>
g. The name and address of the proposed consignee. <P>
h. The reconditioning or denaturing procedure, if any. <P>
i. The proposed labeling as well as written information or instruction to
accompany the product. <P>
j. All special restriction information, e.g., the product may be under
detention by the United States Department of Agriculture and therefore require
an official correspondence between agencies regarding approval of the
diversion. <P>
k. The intended use of the diverted food.  This will include complete
description of the class of animals involved, whether they are food or non-food
producing, the part of the country in which the food will be used, and all
assurances that have been secured that indeed the food will be used as agreed.
<P>
l. All available information from the firm proposing the diversion on the
safety of the adulterant for the intended animal use and, where appropriate,
for the consumption of the edible products of the animals.<P>
m.   Information from the firm proposing the diversion, sufficient for a
determination whether disposition of such article, including packaging
material, will result in the release of a toxic substance into the environment
[See 21 CFR 25.1(f)(9) and (g) and proposed 21 CFR 25.24(d)(4).  An
Environmental Impact Analysis Report under 21 CFR 25.1(j) or an Environmental
Assessment under proposed 21 CFR 25.31 (44 FR 71747) is required if the
proposed disposition fails to meet the above criterion for exclusion].<P>
POLICY:<P>
Diversion requests will be handled on an ad hoc basis.  The *Center* will
consider the requests for diversion of food considered adulterated for human
use in all situations where the diverted food will be acceptable for its
intended animal food use.  Such situations may include:<P>
a.   Pesticide contamination in excess of the permitted tolerance or action
level.<P>
b. Pesticide contamination where the pesticide involved is unapproved for
use on a food or feed commodity.<P>
c.   Contamination by industrial chemicals.<P>
d. Contamination by natural toxicants.<P>
e.   Contamination by filth.<P>
f. Microbiological contamination.<P>
g.   Over tolerance or unpermitted drug residues.<P>
Some general policy issues to be considered while evaluating proposals for
diversion of food considered to be adulterated to animal feed use are:<P>
a.   A seizure action and a voluntary request for diversion are two
separate processes.  A seizure action and a request for diversion cannot
legally be processed simultaneously.  No diversion request submitted under this
guideline will be considered once a seizure recommendation has been forwarded
to headquarters.  If a seizure recommendation is withdrawn and if the
requirements of this policy are met, a diversion request may be entertained.
Naturally, a diversion-based means of reconditioning seized articles may be an
appropriate means of meeting the requirements of a court-ordered consent decree
arising from a seizure.  <P>
b. Diversion may only be allowed where there is a legally
enforceable assurance that the subject foods will not be placed into interstate
commerce before the request is approved and the products appropriately diverted
(i.e., meats not under USDA detention but nevertheless containing illegal
residues would be appropriate for seizure or state embargo but not for
diversion if the meats were already shipped in interstate commerce).
Accordingly, this policy will primarily apply to embargoed goods or bonded
goods to assure adequate control of the adulterated goods. <P>
c. Where diversion is legally appropriate, data are required to demonstrate
that the diverted use poses no safety hazards to the animals consuming the
diverted food and to the public who may be exposed to edible tissues of such
animals. <P>
d. The diversion policy does not sanction or authorize the blending
of the adulterated foods, i.e., the policy does not authorize the diluting of
an adulterated product to below a tolerance or action level. <P>

<H3>Salmonella Contamination of Dry Dog Food </H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.17)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
In a case involving salmonellosis diagnosed in a mother, daughter and the
family dog, the Milwaukee Health Department traced the cause to a dry dog food,
and a recall resulted.  Following the recall, *CVM* initiated an abbreviated
inspection and analytical survey of a representativenumber of
manufacturers of finished dry dog foodproducts to explore an industry
claim that it is animpossibility to manufacture this type of product without <i>Salmonella</i> contamination.<P>
The survey resulted in the examination of 207subsamples,
only two *of which* representingtwo different manufacturers were found
to bepositive for <i>Salmonella</i>.  The survey included nine (9) different manufacturing plants and eight (8)different
manufacturers, and covered extrudedcoated chunk as well as extruded
coated meal typedog foods.  These findings indicate that such products can be manufactured free of <i>Salmonella</i> contamination.<P>
Dried dog food products were reviewed in terms ofproduct
hazard characteristics and the humanpopulation exposure to establish a
risk categoryand ultimately a statistically appropriate sampling technique for <i>Salmonella</i> organisms in ten separatesubsamples
of 25 grams each, there is a 95%<i>Salmonella</i> organism in 83 1/3
grams of testedmaterial.  The hazard characteristics were chosen so as to parallel those for human food productssampled for
<i>Salmonella</i> contamination, since dogfood is usually brought into
the home and oftenprepared in the same area where meals are prepared for humans.  Also, dry dog food may bemixed with tap water
and allowed to sit for longperiods of time providing an appropriate
substratefor the growth of these organisms.  Moreover, petfood
dishes may be readily available to crawlinginfants, may be washed in
the same sink, and canotherwise serve as a direct source of
<i>Salmonella</i>contamination in the home.<P>
It was concluded that, based upon the samplingformula of 10
subsamples of 25 grams per sampleand in light of the fact that dry dog
food hascharacteristics that place it in a risk category, the presence of <i>Salmonella</i> contamination may not bepermitted.
That the industry can avoid <i>Salmonella</i>contamination was clearly
demonstrated by thesurvey.<P>
POLICY:<P>
The *Center for* Veterinary Medicine will considerdry dog
food adulterated under Section 402(a)(1)of the FD&amp;C Act when
<i>Salmonella</i> organisms arefound in one or more samples out of
10subsamples tested.<P>*  * The action of choice will be recall of the involved product code
or seizure, whichever is more appropriate to remove the adulterated material
from the market. <P>
*Material between asterisks is new or revised.* <P>

<H3>Medicated feeds -- Combined Batches</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.37)</b><P>
Medicated feed CGMPs (Part 225) and type A medicated article CGMPs (Part
226) - combining discrete batches into a commingled lot <P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
A number of manufacturers of type A medicated articles and medicated
feeds produce discrete batches in batch mixers which are subsequently combined
in a holding bin from which packaging occurs.  The batches in the holding bin
are often unit packaged to fill a single customer or packaging order.  Although
the product in the holding bin is not uniformly mixed as a unit, it is assigned
a single lot number.  The reason for this procedure is to permit efficient
production practices and to facilitate unit packaging. <P>
POLICY: <P>
A single lot number may be assigned to commingled batches as
described above provided the production and distribution records afford an
identifiable history back to the individual batch records.  If an individual
batch or any portion of the commingled lot is out of potency specification or
otherwise adulterated, the entire commingled lot will be considered
adulterated. <P>
Since the mixer batches are not subsequently mixed as a unit under
this procedure, there is no assurance that samples from the holding bin are
representative of the contents.  Therefore, the sampling and assay schedules in
the CGMPs are to be applied to the individual mixer batches, and not to the
commingled lot. <P>
As part of its internal quality control, the manufacturer should
determine that ingredient segregation does not occur in the holding bins during
the packaging process.  This may be done by sampling and assaying periodically
under an appropriately designed procedure, i.e., at appropriate intervals
during packaging until the bin is empty.<P>

<H3>Illegal Sales of Veterinary Prescription Drugs Direct Reference Authority
for *Warning* Letter Issuance</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.29)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
All veterinary drugs must bear adequate directions for lay use to comply
with Section 502(f)(1) of the act.  Since certain drugs intended for animal use
are toxic or have other potential for harmful effect or because the method of
use is not safe for lay use except under the supervision of a licensed
veterinarian, adequate directions for lay use cannot be prepared.  However,
these veterinary drug products are exempt from Section 502(f)(1) if all the
conditions stated in section 503(f)(2)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act (Pub. L. 100-670, Sec. 105, 102 Stat. 3971, 1988) and 21 CFR
201.105 are met.  Among other things, the labeling for this class of veterinary
drugs must bear the statement "Caution:  Federal law restricts this drug to use
by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian."  Furthermore, in order to
qualify for the exemption, a veterinary prescription (Rx) drug must either be
(1) in the possession of a person who is regularly and lawfully engaged in the
manufacture, transportation, storage, or wholesale or retail distribution of
veterinary drugs and is to be sold only to or on the prescription or order of a
licensed veterinarian for use in the course of his/her professional practice,
or (2) in the possession of a licensed veterinarian for use in the course of
his/her professional practice.<P>
Serious consequences to the public health and to animal health may result
from illegal sales and use of veterinary Rx drugs.  Misuse of veterinary Rx
drugs in food-producing animals may result in unsafe residues in edible
products from the treated animals and/or injury to the treated animals or
users.  These drugs must be used in accordance with the directions and
supervision of licensed veterinarians within the course of their professional
practice, which involves diagnosis of the disease condition and knowledge of
the animals to be treated, to be exempt from Section 502(f)(1).<P>
REGULATORY ACTION GUIDANCE:<P>
Compliance Program 7371.002 provides guidance on conducting investigations
of the illegal sale of veterinary Rx drugs.  The initial step in obtaining
correction of the illegal sales of veterinary Rx drugs is consideration of the
issuance of a *warning* letter.  When all of the following criteria are met
*warning* letters may be issued directly by the district for the illegal sales
of veterinary Rx drugs:<P>
(1) Investigations to document the illegal sales of veterinary Rx drugs
have been conducted in accordance with CP 7371.002, Part III, and<P>
(2) Investigation has revealed that illegal sales of the veterinary Rx
drugs are a sales practice and not a one-time occurrence.  Illegal sale of one
or more drugs on more than one occasion is required, and<P>
(3) The drug or drugs are listed in Attachment A of CP 7371.002 and are
labeled with the veterinary Rx legend, "Caution:  Federal law restricts this
drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian," and<P>
(4) The drug or drugs are veterinary Rx drug(s) which are approved and
listed in 21 CFR Parts 520-*529* for the specific sponsor(s) identified in the
regulation(s), and which bear the approved sponsor's labeling, and<P>
(5) No prescription or other order from a licensed veterinarian for the
sale or use of the veterinary Rx drug(s) by the purchaser is purported to
exist, and<P>
(6) Interstate origin documentation of the veterinary Rx drug(s) involved
is available. <P>
Cases involving illegal sale of veterinary Rx drugs which do not meet all
the criteria for direct issuance of *warning* letters may be submitted to the
Center for Veterinary Medicine, Case Guidance Branch (HFV-236) for
review.<P>
<i>Specimen Charge</i><br>
<i></i><br>
<i>Section</i> and <i>Brief Description</i> <P>
502(f)(1)<P>
The drugs are misbranded while held for sale after shipment in interstate
commerce within the meaning of Section 502(f)(1) in that the labeling fails to
bear adequate directions for use.  They are not exempt from such requirements
since they are veterinary drugs which, because of toxicity or other
potentiality for harmful effect, or the method of their use, are not safe for
use except under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian.  The drugs fail to
comply with the conditions prescribed by 21 U.S.C. 353(f)(2)(A) and 21 CFR
201.105 for exemption from Section 502(f)(1) in that they were sold without a
valid prescription or other order of a licensed veterinarian based upon a
legitimate veterinarian/client/patient relationship.<P>

<H3>Plastic Containers for Injectable Animal Drugs</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.32)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
Numerous veterinary injectable drugs not the subject of approved NADAs are
packaged in plastic containers, particularly large volume injectables.  Under
21 CFR 211.94, the manufacturer must have supporting analytical data and
written SOPs for the use of the container/closure system for each injectable
product.  At the present time *CVM* does not have available the kinds of
suitability data on specific products in its file that would allow us to
recognize the general safety of certain plastic containers for entire classes
of animal drug products.  Until those data are available, *CVM* will make
decisions on a case by case basis. <P>
*CVM* will provide comment and guidance regarding these products if the
following  information is submitted:<P>
1. labeling, <P>
2. the chemical/physical information that specifically characterizes the
plastic container and closure in question, <P>
3. available data or reference to data that is used to demonstrate that the
plastic container and closure are not reactive, additive or absorptive so as to
alter the safety, identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug beyond
the established requirements, <P>
4. available data or reference to data that is used to demonstrate that the
container closure system (including the plastic container) provides adequate
protection against foreseeable external factors in storage and use that can
cause deterioration or contamination (including bacterial) of the drug product,
and<P>
5.   reference to any former advisory opinion of the Agency rendered on
similar products using the same container and closure system, including
opinions by *FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and/or Center for
Biologics Evaluation and Research*.<P>
POLICY:<P>
Injectable animal drug products packaged in plastic containers not in
accord with 21 CFR 211.94 may be deemed adulterated under sections
501(a)(2)(B), and/or 501(a)(3), and/or 501(a)(5) of the Act depending upon the
adequacy of the supporting data.<P>

<H3>Water and Gravy in Pet Food</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.22)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
Most commercial pet foods contain a largepercentage of water
as an added ingredient.<b>  </b>Manufacturers argue that, due to the nature
andseasonal availability of the type of ingredients usedfor pet
foods the relative position of added waterin the ingredient listing
will vary widely thusmaking the use of one label impossible.  Also,
theystate that added water is required for properprocessing.  A
notice in the Federal Register (41FR 15731, April 14, 1976) reaffirmed
theAgency's position regarding the listing of water inthe
ingredient statement in descending order ofpredominance by weight.
However, this noticeallows it to be qualified (in the proper position
inthe listing) by "sufficient for processing" or somesuch
similar statement.<P>
In addition, a number of manufacturers haveadopted the
practice of declaring "gravy" as an ingredient of the pet food in a variety of
ways. Some contend that the listing of gravy in the order of descending
predominance, followed by a parenthetical listing of its components, conforms
to the requirements of the regulations (21 CFR *) in that "gravy" consists of
the common or usual name of an ingredient.  However, the industry has admitted,
in many cases, that the "gravy" is not even formulated as a separate
ingredient.  Review of cookbooks and other references shows no common
definition or formula for generic terms such as gravy, sauce, or broth.
<P>
POLICY: <P>
Water added to a pet food and not listed in the ingredient statement in
decreasing order of predominance is in violation of 21 CFR **.  As such, the
product is misbranded under Section 403(a).  When the qualifier, "sufficient
for processing" or some such similar statement is used, the added water must be
listed in its proper order and must indeed be necessary for the complete
processing of the product. Such terms as gravy, broth, or sauce used in the
listing of ingredients on pet food labels are not established common or usual
names as covered by 21 CFR *.  These terms may serve to mask the true relative
amount of added water and avert the intent of the Act and regulations.
Products so labeled are misbranded within the meaning of Section 403(i).
<P>
Pet foods in which added water has not been declared or added water is not
listed in proper order (21 CFR ***) may be deemed adulterated within the
meaning of Section 402(b). <P>
   * 21 CFR 501.4(b)(2)(i) <br>

<title>HOW TO PROVIDE A SAFE HOME ENVIRONMENT FOR YOUR PET</title>
<b>HOW TO PROVIDE A SAFE HOME ENVIRONMENT FOR YOUR PET</b><P>
There are many factors involved in the care and feeding of a household pet--a
nutritious diet, regular visits to the veterinarian, lots of love, and a safe
environment in which to live.  To sharpen an awareness of household hazards for
pet owners,  Dr. Sandra Woods has outlined six common hazards with suggestions
for prevention. <P>
1.  <b>Electric Shock</b> <P>
Puppies and kittens will chew on anything in their environment--it's a learning
process.  Biting a plugged-in electric cord attached to a turned-on appliance
may result in electrocution and immediate death.  If the pet does not die, it
will have fourth and fifth degree burns where the electricity contacts their
gums and/or tongue.  Prompt and extensive medical care is required to treat
such burns in order to prevent severe local infections or septicemia. <P>
This danger can be alleviated by keeping all cords out of reach or covered with
chew-proof cord guards (commercial or homemade).  Another idea is avoidance
training which, if carefully taught and periodically reinforced, will also
work.<P>
2. <b> Human Medications</b><P>
Since puppies and kittens may eat anything in sight, don't leave medications on
tables, chairs, or in open purses.  Acetominophen, the common headache remedy,
can kill cats by converting a large portion of their hemoglobin into
methemoglobin which cannot carry oxygen to body tissues.<P>
Ibuprofen, another pain killer, can be fatal to dogs.  It can cause gastric
ulcers and acute renal failure.             <P>
3.  <b>Pet Medications</b><P>
Many of the new canine and feline drug dosage forms are chewable products.  A
careless act of leaving a bottle of chewable tablets within reach may result in
your pet's consuming several months' supply in one meal.  This may also happen
with oral liquid formulations.<br>
Examples of products that may be involved include chewable heartworm
preventives (diethylcarbamazine and ivermectin) and liquid wormers (pyrantel
pamoate).<P>
If either human or pet medication accidents occur, call your veterinarian
immediately. The veterinarian needs to know the medicine consumed and the
symptoms, if any, because the appropriate treatment must be specific to that
medication.<P>
4.  <b>Covered Pool or Pond</b><P>
Pool covers, used to prevent leaves and grass from clogging pool filters, will
support the weight of a moving cat or small dog.  If, however, the animal stops
moving, it sinks!  The pet can  become trapped under the pool cover.
Heavily-coated breeds, such as chows and Lhasas, may be unable to swim to
safety when their coats become water logged.  <P>
A pond may also be hazardous to pets in the winter.  Cats and dogs may wander
onto ice too thin to support their weight.  A winter's dip in the pond may
result in hypothermia or drowning, not only for the pet but also for the person
who might decide to wade out for the rescue.<P>
The best rule to follow to avoid these water hazards is to keep your pet on a
leash and supervised in a yard with a pool or pond.  Training may help pets to
avoid the covered pool.<P>
5.  <b>Fertilizers</b><P>
Products intended to promote a healthy lawn can be hazardous to pets; for
example, fertilizers containing bone meal and nitrates.  The bone meal makes
the product taste like food and the nitrates interact with hemoglobin to
produce methemoglobin which, as in acetominophen toxicity, does not function as
an oxygen carrier to the tissues.<P>
Protect pets by keeping fertilizers locked up or stored in tightly closed
containers.  Do not let pets play on freshly fertilized lawns, and water
heavily after fertilizing to encourage absorption of the plant food.<P>
6. <b> Lead Paints</b><P>
Many oil-based paints that produce a high gloss finish contain lead.  Pets can
play with or chew on old paint brushes or stirring sticks, and lead poisoning
may result.  Lead poisoning can cause serious brain damage and anemia, and an
exposed pet's recovery depends on prompt discovery and rapid treatment by the
veterinarian.<P>
Keep all painting supplies in closed cabinets and properly dispose of used
brushes, rags, stirring sticks, etc.  Consumers should call or write their
local or county environmental office to find out how to dispose of
lead-containing products.  <P>
Poisoning cases are medical emergencies.  If you suspect your animal has been
poisoned, contact your veterinarian immediately.  If your veterinarian confirms
the poisoning, he should report the case to one of the poison control
centers--the Georgia Animal Poison Control Center at the College of Veterinary
Medicine, University of Georgia, or the National Animal Poison Control Center
at the College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Illinois.  Records are
maintained at these centers and toxicologists are always available for
consultation.<P>
The most useful information for consumers to consider to assure their pets'
safety at home is--prevention is more effective than treatment.<P>

<TITLE>GUILTY VERDICT IN VEAL FEED CASE</TITLE>


</HEAD>
<BODY>
August 29, 1996

<H3>GUILTY VERDICT IN VEAL FEED CASE</H3>
<hr>
On June 10, 1996, a Federal jury in Milwaukee, Wisconsin returned guilty verdicts on all twelve 
counts against the Vitek Corporation and the president of the firm, Jannes (John) Doppenberg.  
Vitek Supply Corporation, located in Oak Grove, Wisconsin, imports, manufactures and 
distributes animal drugs, feed, feed supplements, and feed premixes for food-producing animals, 
primarily veal calves.  Vitek and Mr. Doppenberg had been charged with conspiracy and 
smuggling unapproved drugs into the U.S., and adding these drugs to feed mixtures sold to veal 
producers.  The guilty verdicts came on five counts of smuggling, four counts of shipping 
misbranded drugs, two counts of shipping adulterated drugs, and one count of conspiracy.
<P>
Sherry Steffen, who was employed as Vitek's office manager, had been indicted on these same 
charges.  Ms. Steffen plead guilty to conspiracy to smuggle and distribute misbranded and 
adulterated animal drugs.  On August 6, 1996, Ms. Stefan was sentenced to 2 years probation, 
150 hours of community service, restitution to the U.S. Customs Service in the amount of 
$29,452.65, and a $25.00 special assessment to the court.
<P>
Evidence presented at the trial established that unapproved drugs were added by Vitek to its feed 
premix products and shipped to feed companies and growers.  Evidence was also presented 
showing that between 1988 and April 1994, Vitek sold over 1.7 million pounds of products 
containing unapproved drugs, valued at almost $1.3 million dollars.  The unapproved drugs 
included: clenbuterol, avoparcin, furaltadone, furazolidone, and nitrofurazone.
<P>
This conviction was the result of a cooperative investigation conducted by investigators from 
U.S. Customs, the FDA, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  Thomas P. Schneider, U.S. 
Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, made the following statement in conjunction with 
the guilty verdict:
<P>
"While there have been other convictions for using clenbuterol in show animals, this is the first 
conviction nationally where clenbuterol was introduced wholesale into animals being raised solely 
as part of our nation's food supply.  The evidence established an international conspiracy to 
smuggle clenbuterol and other drugs into this country from the Netherlands.  The evidence 
established that veal feed suppliers and veal producers throughout the country paid Vitek extra 
for veal premix containing these illegal and harmful animal drugs.  The U.S. Attorneys Office, 
U.S. Customs, FDA, and USDA are continuing this investigation and I expect additional charges 
soon."

<H3>Pet Food Labeling</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7126.09)</b><P>
BACKGROUND:<P>
We have recently responded to a questionconcerning the
proper way to label a frozen catfood product manufactured from headed
andgutted ocean fish with bone and skin removed.<b>  </b>The
manufacturer characterized the product as"minced fish" made from ground
fish such aspollock, haddock, or cod.<P>
We advised that we could not permit an ingredientto be represented
as containing "pollock orhaddock or cod" as the inquirer requested,
since,in our opinion, this would cause the product to be misbranded as

<H3>*Products for Control of Fleas and Ticks* Containing a Pesticide</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.28)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
*Topically applied products for control of fleas and ticks, other than
those with systemic action, and* flea and tick collars currently fall within
the purview of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, which
is administered by the Environmental Protection Agency.  Before EPA registers a
pesticide product for marketing, research data must be submitted to show that
the product is effective for the intended use and is safe when used according
to label precautions and restrictions.  Unfortunately, there are some
individual animals and breeds that may be unusually sensitive to certain
pesticide chemicals or the collars per se, so there are numerous complaints.
The instructions provided with these *products* usually provide instructions as
to what should be done if *problems* occur.  Articles registered by the EPA
have an EPA registration number listed on the label.<P>
POLICY:<P>
*Products containing a pesticide which are the responsibility of EPA
contain EPA registration numbers on the label, and inquiries regarding such
products or complaints should be referred to the Regulatory Division Office of
Pesticide Programs, Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202, Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), 1921 the nearest EPA regional office or advise the
inquirer to contact them directly.*<P>
If labeling of these articles contains claims for conditions other than for
fleas, and other external parasites, they may be drugs subject to regulation by
the FDA under the Memorandum of Understanding between FDA and EPA (CPG
7155b.08).<P>

<H3>Reconditioning of New Animal Drugs Seized Under Section 501(a)(5)</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125.19)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
There are several significant differences in the regulation of unapproved
new drugs for humans as compared to unapproved new animal drugs. <P>
Unapproved new human drugs are in violation of Section 505(a) of the Act.
New human drugs cannot be seized as violating Section 505(a) of the Act on a
301(k) charge.  New human drugs seized under a 505(a) charge cannot be
reconditioned but must be destroyed (304(d)(1)).  In the past where a human
drug product can be reconditioned in a manner to bring it into compliance, the
libel has been amended from a 505 charge to a misbranding charge to provide for
appropriate relabeling or other reconditioning. <P>
An unapproved new animal drug if sold commercially is adulterated within
the meaning of 501(a)(5) or 501(a)(6) of the Act and may be seized on a 301(a)
or 301(k) charge.  There is no exemption under Section 304 precluding the
reconditioning of an animal drug seized under 501(a)(5) or (6) of the
Act.<P>
POLICY:<P>
Where a new animal drug can be brought into compliance after seizure on a
501(a)(5) or 501(a)(6) charge, the *Center* may enter into a suitable consent
decree permitting reconditioning.  Some instances where reconditioning may take
place are:<P>
1.   Deletion of excessive therapeutic claims which caused the product to
be a new animal drug.<P>
2.   Deletion of any claim which would cause the product to be within FDA
jurisdiction, such as removal of drug claims changing a shampoo product into a
grooming aid not subject to regulation under the Act.<P>
3.   Conversion to an investigational animal drug subject to 21 CFR 511
requirements.<P>
4.   Approval of an NADA after seizure has taken place.<P>

Rockville, Maryland 20855<BR>
<H3>ABSTRACT</H3>

The Food and Drug Administration's Center Veterinary Medicine has developed
this GUIDELINE FOR ANTI-INFECTIVE BOVINE MASTITIS PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. This
guideline refers to the regulatory requirements and outlines general procedures
for conducting  evaluations for a drug product being considered for approval.
This guideline does not preclude alternative procedures which document animal
safety and effectiveness of a drug product.<BR>
<H3>FORWARD</H3>
Introduction :<BR>

This guideline has been assembled to inform the drug industry of (1) the
basis of certain regulatory requirements concerning animal drugs, and (2) the
types of data to be collected to demonstrate that a product is safe and
effective. This guideline does not address the human food safety data
requirements for the subject animal drug products.<BR>

Regulations:<BR>

Before the approval of a new animal drug is published in the FEDERAL
REGISTER, the drug's sponsor must demonstrate that the proposed drug is safe
and effective for use as recommended in the proposed labeling. The authority
upon which these requirements are based can be found in Section 512 of the
Federal Food Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b. Applicable Federal
regulations are 21 CFR 511 (New Animal Drug for Investigational Use) and 21 CFR
514 (New Animal Drug Applications).<BR>
<H3>I. ANIMAL SAFETY STUDY</H3>
The sponsor should demonstrate that its final product, which is
proposed for marketing, is safe to the target animal. In addition to the
safety study listed below, all test animals in the drug effectiveness trials
should be examined for adverse drug reactions<p>
<b>Irritation  Study (Lactating or Non-Lactating Products)</b><P>
Animal Selection: Select 6 normal mature cows and normal first-calf cows.
Half (3) of each group should have daily milk production ABOVE 50 lbs. (early
lactation) and half (3) BELOW 25 lbs. (late lactation). A profile on each test
animal should be submitted and includes the animal's age, present stage and
number lactations as well as daily milk production.<BR>
Data Collection: Information to be documented for the
pre-treatment, treatment, and post-treatment periods includes the following:
Animal ID, Farm Site, Trial No., Date, Test Day, Hour, Milk Production, and
Body Temperature. Parameters to be measured twice-a-day for all four quarters
include palpation results and quantitative somatic cell counts (QSCCs). Somatic
cell counts should be determined by quantitative count methods. For example,
"Direct Microscopic Somatic Cell Count in Milk" reported in Journal of Milk and
Food Technology, Vol. 31, No. 11, November 1968 , and "Design of Eyepiece
Reticles for Use in the Direct Microscopic Somatic Cell Count Method"
reported in the same volume. Electronic cell counting may also be used.  It
is advised that somatic cell counts be consistently determined in aliquot
samples taken from the total milk production of each quarter. Data sheets
should include a copy of the laboratories' analyses (QSCCs) with the
technician's signature  (for each cow.) <p>
<b>Treatment Periods:</b><P>
<OL> 
<LI>The PRE-TREATMENT period includes four  milkings (2 days) before
drug product is administered. This is the time span when base line observations
are made to establish normalcy in all test animals. During this period, it
is recommended that duplicate or consecutive milk samples for culturing be
taken  from all four quarters. This optional procedure helps identify a
pathogenic organism as the cause of udder irritation.
<LI>The TREATMENT period begins at the fifth milking after the test period
begins. The labeled dose schedule should be followed, and all four quarters are
to be treated.
<LI>The POST-TREATMENT period lasts for twelve milkings (6 days) after the
labeled milk withdrawal time.</OL> 
<H3>II. DRUG    EFFECTIVENESS    STUDIES</H3>
The sponsor should demonstrate that the final product will have the effect
the label indicates against infectious bovine mastitis. The presence of an
invading udder  pathogen (infection) and the presence of a cytologic reaction
(inflammation) are the two conditions under which the proposed drug is to be
tested regardless of the clinical degree (clinical or subclinical infectious
mastitis).<OL>
<LI>Efficacy data are to be collected on each udder pathogen for which a
claim is made (e.g., <I>Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae</I>) .
For data requirements pertaining to infectious bovine mastitis caused
environmental pathogens, pre-protocol CVM-sponsor discussions are strongly
recommended.
<LI>The degree of reported cytologic reaction (QSCC) is to be
reported.
<LI>Data should be collected using animals representative of the target
population/herd. Therefore, all lactating and non-lactating cows in the target
herd [depending on the label claim(s)] are to be surveyed. All those found to
have infectious mastitis are to be included in the clinical field
studies.
<LI>General herd/cow descriptive data should be submitted and
contain the following information: herd size, number of cows currently
lactating, the percent of lactating cows sampled in the herd,
the percent  of lactating cows affected by infectious mastitis,
approximate age of the cow, and stage of lactation. Separate data and analysis
should be provided for clinical mastitis and for subclinical mastitis.<BR>
<LI>A pre-treatment culture/cell survey is recommended for subclinical
infectious mastitis studies. It should include milk samples from all lactating
quarters on all cows in a herd or a composite milk sample from all lactating cows in a
herd. The data collected from this survey are to be submitted in the NADA. All
infected quarters of cows in the herd should be included in study.

<LI>For drug combination products, it is necessary to show that each
ingredient contributes to the total effectiveness of the product in infected
mastitic cows.

<LI>Any concurrent antibiotic or non-antibiotic therapy administered to a study
animal should be described and filed in the NADA submission. However, data from
these animals should not be included in the sponsor's analysis of the
data.

<LI>At least 100 infectious mastitis cases per pathogen well be required per
treatment group in the dose confirmation studies.

<LI>Herd Selection:<br>
 For a subclinical infectious mastitis treatment claim, it is recommended
that 20% of the animals in the herds selected for dose confirmation studies
should have least one quarter affected by subclinical infectious
mastitis.</OL>

<H3>III. CLINICAL    FIELD    TRIALS</H3>

A. Dose determination will be based on a control  and least three
non-zero drug levels in cows with subclinical mastitis    These trials should
be designed to define the optimum effective dose. Dose determination may be
conducted by as few as one investigator per each of two geographic locations.
These trials should  involve a minimum of six herds. Quarters on an individual
cow should be treated with a single drug level.<BR>
<BR>
B. Dose confirmation will be based on the optimum effective dose selected
from the dose determination studies and control group. Dose confirmation
studies may be conducted by as few as two independent investigators per each of
two different geographic locations. These trials should involve a minimum of
six herds. Quarters on an individual cow should be treated with one
drug.<P>

<H3>IV. DATA    PRESENTATION    AND    STATISTICAL    ANALYSIS</H3>

For each organism for which a claim is to be made, the cure rate data
should be sorted, summarized, and submitted herd for each investigator. Due to
large herd to herd differences in treatment response, the statistical analysis
should be conducted using statistical methods for discrete data that
account  for differences  due to herds and investigators.  If herd and
investigator differences are not accounted for in the statistical analysis, the
true treatment effect can be confounded with treatment sample sizes in the
various herds tested.

The control of subclinical infectious mastitis is measured by
incidence rate of recurrent and/or new infections.<P>
***NOTE As more information becomes available, the numerical ranges for the
post treatment somatic cell may require adjusting.
<H3>GLOSSARY    OF    TERMS</H3>
<OL>
<LI>Infectious Mastitis: Inflammatory condition mammary gland caused by pathogenic
microorganism. It is characterized by pathological changes of the udder
epithelium followed by inflammatory reactions and secretional changes. Evidence
of leukocytosis is found in the milk of affected quarters.
<LI>Infectious Mastitis (Clinical) : A form of mastitis characterized by the following:<BR>
     a. Grossly abnormal milk and presence of flakes or clots.<BR>
     b. Evidence of inflammation with apparent clinical tissue changes,
        swelling, heat and/or pain in the affected quarters.<BR>
     c. Evidence of leukocytosis in milk. <BR>
     d. Isolation of pathogenic microorganism in pure culture from fresh
         plating of milk sample is generally possible <BR>
     e. Drop in milk production.<BR>
<LI>Infectious Mastitis (Subclinical) : A form of mastitis without clinical 
signs of udder changes.  Visibly normal
milk with an abnormal mastitis screening test value and pathogenic
microorganism found on bacteriological culture.
<LI>Optimum Effectiveness of Drug: That level of drug 
(administered at its proper regimen) beyond which any
further incremental increase in drug level produces no meaningful improvement
in desired efficacy, or if further drug does provide increased efficacy, the
benefit is outweighed by increased risks in terms of human and/or animal
safety. 
<LI>Quantitative Somatic Cell Count: The Direct Microscopic Somatic Cell 
Count (DMSCC) or electronic somatic
cell counting techniques which determine the number of somatic cells in
milk.
<LI>Composite Milk Samples: A mixed sample of milk collected from all 
quarters at a single milking.
<LI>Consecutive Milk Samples: Milk samples collected at different milkings.
<LI>Duplicate Milk Samples: Two milk samples collected at a single milking.
<LI>Control Methods - Clinical Infectious Mastitis (Note- Regarding the
control group for clinical infectious mastitis, pre-protocol CVM sponsored
discussions are strongly recommended.)<BR>
  a. positive - approved drug used as a treatment in the control quarters.<BR>
                 The data documenting currently approved mastitis drug
                 products have not been evaluated in accordance with the
                 clinical mastitis parameters discussed in the guideline.<BR>
  b. milk out - control quarters are milked out every 3 to 4 hours for 36 hours.<BR>
  c. delayed treatment - the control quarters are not treated for a fixed number of hours<BR> 
                 after the diagnosis of clinical
                 infectious mastitis (whereas the treated group is 
                 treated immediately upon diagnosis by the investigator 
                 or dairyman).  The duration of the delayed treatment
                 period must be adequate to minimize the number of
                 spontaneous cures.  To score the delayed treatment
                 quarter as a failure, the presence of clinical infectious
                 mastitis prior to delayed treatment documented by
                 a QSCC and a positive strip cup.<BR>
            
<LI>Control Methods - Subclinical Infectious Mastitis <BR>
     a. no treatment<BR>
     b. placebo (vehicle)<BR>

<H3>Devices for Use in Animals </H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125a.01)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
There are many articles falling under the definition of a device in Section
201(h) of the FD&amp;C Act which are intended for animal use which are parallel
in intent and function to devices intended for human use.  There are, however,
a number of articles which are peculiar to animal use and have no parallel
human use.  Devices intended for animal use require no pre-marketing clearance.
They may, however, be deemed to be adulterated or misbranded under the general
provisions of 501 and 502 as may be determined by the *Center for* Veterinary
Medicine. <P>
POLICY: <P>
Articles intended for use in animals which conform to the definition of a
device under 201(h) and which are suspected as being hazardous or otherwise
adulterated or misbranded may be submitted to the *Center for* Veterinary
Medicine (HFV-236) with recommendations for regulatory action.  <P>
*Material between asterisks is new or revised* <P>

<B>CVM Guideline Number 55 - Supportive Data for Cat Food Labels Bearing "Reduces Urinary pH" Claims:
Guideline in Protocol Development
</B><P>
Guidelines state procedures or practices that may be useful to the persons
whom they are directed, but they are not legal requirements. Guidelines
represent the agency's position on a procedure or a practice at the time of
their issuance. A person may follow the guideline or may choose, to follow
alternate procedures or practices. If a person chooses to use alternate
procedures or practices, that person may wish to discuss the matter further
with the agency to prevent the expenditure of money or effort on activities
that may latter be determined to be unacceptable to FDA. A guideline does not
bind the agency, and it does not confer any rights, privileges, or benefits for
or on any person. When a guideline states a requirement imposed by statute or
regulation, however, the requirement is law and its force and effect are not
changed in any way by virtue of its inclusion in the guideline.

<B>Supportive Data for Cat Food Labels Bearing "Reduces Urinary pH" Claims: Guideline in Protocol Development
</B> <P>
1. Test diet formulations should be nutritionally complete and balanced. This
should be, demonstrated by, at minimum, the successful passage of an adult
maintenance feeding thai following current AAFCO protocols. Formulations should
be limited to ingredients that are justifiable on a nutritional basis, and
levels of ingredients should be consistent with sound nutritional practices.
<P>
2. Product utility (i.e., the ability of the diet to produce an appropriately
acidic urine) should be demonstrated by means of well controlled,
scientifically sound studies. At minimum, a concurrent control group of cats
fed a non-acidifying diet is needed to allow for meaningful comparisons. To
facilitate data collection, cats should be housed individually, not in groups.
The control diet may be a commercially available product or an experimental
formulation (such as the test diet minus its acidifying components). It should
also be nutritionally complete and balanced, preferably determined by previous
testing following AAFCO protocols. Adequate numbers of animals in control and
test groups, as determined by appropriate statistical methodology, should be
used in order to be able to detect statistically significant differences
between groups.
<P>
3. Data sufficient to demonstrate product safety are paramount. At minimum,
data should include veterinary observations on cat health, as well as
measurements of body weight, food consumption, urinalysis (including sediment
examination), serum chemistries, blood gases, and mineral balances (Ca, P, Mg,
K). Appropriate statistical comparisons should be conducted, using suitable
methodology and numbers of animals to confidently (95 %) detect statistically
significant (10%) differences, should they exist. Particular attention should
be paid to parameters that assess renal and bone function. A necropsy should be
performed on any animal that dies during the study, and the findings recorded.
The reason for any medical treatment or removal of any animal from the study
should be noted.
<P>
4. The length of the studies should be sufficient to assure product safety. At
minimum, a six-month study, consistent with the length of time to conduct an
AAFCO maintenance feeding trial, is needed. Food consumption and body weight
determinations should be measured routinely. Data on other parameters should be
collected on at least four occasions during the course of the study, including
the beginning and termination of the study.
<P>
5. The submission should include all data generated, and include both data on
individual animals and group summaries. Full discussion of product formulation,
experimental methodology, statistical methods, and interpretation of findings
should be included.
<P>
6. Data on additional parameters and/or longer studies may be required
depending on the study findings. It is prudent to keep animals on test and to
continue data collection while the six-month data is under review. Aliquots of
serum and urine samples should be frozen for possible additional testing.
<P>
7. These key points cannot address all specifics in protocol design.
Submissions of protocols or review is strongly encouraged. Questions on
details of the protocols should be resolved before the study is commenced.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
This guideline is intended to aid sponsors of New Animal Drug Applications
(NADAs) develop protocols for tests generating data to be included in NADAs to
show the effectiveness of topical/otic new animal drugs, and establishes
criteria for the evaluation of such data. The term "topical/otic drug" as used
in this guideline means an animal drug for topical application, including
administration to the external auditory canal, that is intended for the
prevention or treatment of a condition affecting, or that is intended to affect
the structure or function of, the integument and/or external auditory canal.<p>
This guideline is applicable only to topical/otic products containing any one
or a combination of antibacterial, antiinflammatory, and antifungal agents.
Topical products containing other types of active ingredients are infrequently
presented and are excluded from the scope of this guideline. The principles
enunciated in this guideline, and in particular those concerning dose
determination and the demonstration of the contribution of each active
ingredient, are uniquely designed for, and specifically limited in
applicability to, the development and evaluation of the topical/otic drugs
within its scope.<p>

This guideline is designed to provide general directions for acquiring
information pertinent to effectiveness and to promote uniform review of
submissions by the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). Sponsors are invited
to confer with appropriate CVM personnel prior to undertaking their studies.
Conferences may include total program and individual protocol reviews.
Appropriate protocols can be developed by mutual discussion among the sponsor's
and CVM's personnel.<p>

Critique of this guideline is encouraged and welcomed. As other methods for the
evaluation of topical/otic drugs and/or better experimental designs become
available, they may be incorporated as revisions.<p>

In accordance with the agency's regulation at 21 CFR 10.90(b), which states
agency policy regarding guidelines, this guideline does not prevent a sponsor
from attempting to satisfy the requirements for establishing the effectiveness
of topical/otic new animal drugs within its scope by collecting data in manners
other than those discussed in the guideline. It is recommended, however, that
prior to choosing to follow other procedures, the sponsor's personnel discuss
the matter with CVM's personnel to prevent the expenditure of resources on
activity that may later be determined to be unacceptable.

<h3>II. Rationale for Proposed Product</h3>

Initially, the drug sponsor should address the issue of whether there is
scientific justification or medical rationale for the proposed topical/otic
product. What is the etiology of the clinical condition(s) for which the
proposed product is indicated? Is there an identifiable population of animals
that would benefit from the use of the proposed product containing one or more
active ingredients (antiinflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal)? For example,
attached <b>Exhibit A </b>provides an etiological and epidemiological
exposition of canine and feline otitis externa. The same methods/principles
utilized in Exhibit A are applicable for documenting topical/otic product
rationale for other treatable conditions and different species. Complete
citations to all references relied upon should be included when documenting the
rationale for a new product.

<h3>III. Definitions of Topical Categories</h3>

The classes of topical/otic products discussed in this guideline exert proposed
beneficial effect(s) by either the treatment or prophylaxis of skin infections
and or inflammatory processes.<p>
<ol>
<li> First-aid product. A safe, non-irritating preparation to be applied to
adequately cleansed small superficial wounds, such as cuts, abrasions and
burns, that reduces microbial numbers and/or aids in prevention of infection
and does not interfere with normal wound healing.<p>

<li>Skin wound protectant. A safe, non-irritating preparation to be applied to
adequately cleansed small wounds that provides a protective physical barrier,
and neither delays healing nor favors the growth of microorganisms. Reference:
39 FR 33140 (September 13, 1974) regarding barrier testing for skin wound
protectants.<p>

<li>Skin wound antibiotic/antifungal. A safe, non-irritating antibiotic and/or
antifungal preparation that prevents or treats overt skin infection. Claims
stating or implying an effect against microorganisms must be supported by
controlled studies in the target species that demonstrate effectiveness in the
prevention or treatment of infection.<p>

<li>Skin wound antiinflammatory agent: A safe, naturally occurring or synthesized
steroidal or other agent used to reduce inflammation and thereby inhibit
pruritis associated with surface cuts, abrasions, burns or steroid responsive
dermatoses.</ol>
<h3> IV. Twelve Variables Affecting Efficacy</h3>
<p>
The following are 12 variable factors that significantly affect the efficacy
determination of topical/otic preparations:<p>
<ol>
<li>Amount of drug interfacing with skin
<li>Concentration/dilution of active ingredients
<li>Type of vehicle
<li>Solubility in vehicle
<li>Rate of release, penetration, absorption, etc.
<li>Surface area medicated
<li>Frequency and manner of application
<li>Contact time
<li>Degree of excoriation of lesion
<li>Accuracy of diagnosis (including characteristics of etiological agent(s),
pathogenicity, resistance, etc.) 
<li>Quantity of hair
<li>Presence of organic matter<p>
</ol>
<h3>V. Drug Release from Topical/Otic Preparations</h3><p>
It is essential to consider the influence of the vehicle on the effectiveness
of a topical preparation. The vehicle may be the controlling factor in the
release of the active ingredient(s) from the preparation. The following
discussion serves to clarify some of the problems involved in trying to assess
drug release and the resulting effectiveness.<p>

Drug release from any dosage form occurs at the interface between the vehicle
and the tissue to which it is applied. The drug must leave the vehicle and
enter the environment of the tissue before it can exert any biological
activity. There are many factors that influence the rate and extent of this
drug release. Some of these factors are: concentration of the drug in the
vehicle; solubility of the drug in the vehicle; diffusion coefficient of the
drug in the vehicle; partition coefficient of the drug between the vehicle and
the tissue. Influencing each of these factors are other conditions such as pH
of the vehicle, drug or tissue; temperature; degree of hydration of skin, etc.
Obviously, drug release from dosage form is not merely a simple matter of
smearing on a product and obtaining instantaneous results. Many
physico-chemical interactions eventually determine success or failure of a
product, apart from any activity of the active ingredient(s).<p>
From a physico-chemical viewpoint, an insoluble particle in a fairly viscous,
greasy vehicle would not be an ideal dosage form. If little or no diffusion through the vehicle takes place, then
the only portion of active ingredient available for biologic activity is that
which exists at the tissue interface at the time of application or that which
later comes in contact with the receding boundary of the ointment. Perhaps it
is for this reason that demonstration of effectiveness of topical/otic
ointments has been difficult in some well-controlled studies.<p>

Ointments have previously been the most widely used topical/otic drug dosage
forms. An occlusive vehicle (one that acts as a physical barrier), such as an
ointment, has certain advantages in treating small wounds, e.g., may aid in
wound healing. However, a higher concentration of the active ingredient can be
made available to the tissue site over a short period of time from a cream
formulation than from an ointment formulation. Other topical/otic dosage forms
(gels, solutions, lotions, etc.) have unique advantages and disadvantages.<p>

The release of drugs from various vehicles has been the subject of many reviews
and research papers. Consistently, these papers indicate that a formulation or
vehicle for a given chemical must be specifically designed for that chemical to
obtain maximum drug release. In formulating a cream or ointment, the physical
properties of the drug and vehicle must be balanced in such a way as to provide
optimum release. Specific additives may enhance or retard release of a chemical
from the vehicle.  For example, it has been shown that by simply incorporating
a surfactant, release of chloramphenicol and tetracycline from an ointment
formulation is enhanced.<p>
A review of the broad problem of' release of drugs from topically applied
dosage forms has been published by Grasso and Lansdown, <b>"Methods of
Measuring and Factors Affecting Percutaneous Absorption," </b>Journal of
Society of Cosmetic Chemists, 23:481-521, 1972.<p>

In situations where filing an NADA ordinarily requires comparative
bioequivalence testing of the subject drug with a like or similar formulation,
for topically applied products CVM may, under certain conditions, determine
that bioequivalence testing is not needed. When bioequivalence testing of
topical/otic products is needed, see CVM's <b>Bioequivalence Study Guideline,
Section III. B.</b>
<p>
The following, though not intended as an exhaustive list, are some of the
inactive ingredients frequently used as vehicular components in topical/otic
applications: <br>
Lactose<br>
Lanolin<br>
Mineral oil<br>
Petrolatum<br>
Polyethylene glycol
<h3> VI.  Discussion of Animal Models for Efficacy Testing</h3>

In dealing with the use of models of the infection/inflammation of minor
wounds, burns, and abrasions, the differences and similarities of a specific
model to naturally occurring infection/inflammation processes can be
examined.<ol>
 
<li> Normal infection process.<p>

a. Microbial organisms occur on the skin at the time of 
injury, or are often carried there or transmitted from an infected source, such
as a biting insect.<p>

b. A lesion occurs on the skin.<p>

c. The lesion provides the environmental situation required to allow the
organisms that are present, or have been applied as the lesion is made, to
reproduce and invade.<p>

d. An infected lesion results.<p>

e.  The organisms causing the infection are present at the time of injury.<p>

<li> Differences and similarities between natural and induced skin infection.<p>

a. In the natural infection, there is often a mixed population of
microorganisms; in the model, only 1 or 2 types of microorganisms have been
used. Whether model or natural infection, the new animal drug should be tested
against the organism(s) considered to be primary pathogen(s).<p>

b. In the model system, the organisms against which the antibiotic/antifungal
is acting are often those encountered in the normal surface flora. In the
natural infection, in addition to the normal surface flora, other organisms
(from exogenous sources) will likely be the infecting agents. These agents are
the specific target of the applied antibiotic/antifungal.<p>

c.  In the model system, organisms and active 
formulations may be inadvertently transmitted from one lesion to another, since
artificially produced lesions may be made at close intervals on the skin.<p>
</ol>
<h3>
VII. Classification, Testing Methodology, And Uses of Animal
Models</h3>
A.  Classification
<p>
Animal models may be developed in several ways to study antimicrobial agents.
Some examples are as follows:<p>
<ol>
<li>  Expanded flora test. This method can be used to evaluate broad spectrum
antibiotic activity against large numbers of both gram-positive and
gram-negative organisms induced by pretreatment occlusion. The expansion of
flora that normally occurs when an occlusive wrap is applied to the skin is
inhibited. A plastic wrap is applied for 48 
hours prior to application of antibiotic agent. To 
    be considered effective, a test material should 
    destroy 99 percent of
microorganisms. Bacterial counts will be low only if the 
antibiotic is active against both
gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.<p>

<li>  Occlusion test. This test primarily estimates the bacteriostatic activity of
an antibiotic against gram-positive microorganisms found on normal skin,
showing how well the agent prevents a small number of bacteria from rapidly
proliferating. Lesions are produced either by stripping with cellophane tape or
by application of ammonium hydroxide, followed by inoculation with pathogenic
organisms (usually staphylococci) and then covered by occlusive wrap. Lesions
may be treated with a test compound after inoculation, and then inhibition of
growth is observed or rapidity of healing is judged.<p>

<li>  Persistence test. This test determines the reservoir effect of the
antibiotic, or its ability to bind to the stratum corneum to give a prolonged
effect. In this test the antibiotic is usually applied 3 times daily for 3
days. After 3 days, these areas are occluded for 24 hours and then sampled for
bacteria. Occlusion allows bacterial growth in the presence of the specific
antibiotic being tested. The persistence of antimicrobial activity after
application on the skin extends the time over which an antibiotic can exert an
effect on a bacterial cell. This test is one means of measuring this
characteristic in an animal model.<p>

<li>  Reduction of expanded flora produced by occlusive wrapping of the site. The
inhibition of the expanded flora can be observed by application of antibiotics
after sufficient time period of occlusion with the wrap. Prevention of
expansion of the flora can also be used to test antibiotic activity. Antibiotic
is applied to the wound or test site, and after continued occlusion, the inhibition of expansion of the
flora is observed. The antimicrobial agent should eliminate the organism(s)
from most lesions cultured within 18 hours after the agent is applied.<p>

A similar model may be used in which the stratum corneum is removed by
producing blisters with ammonium hydroxide.<p>

<li>  In testing for prophylaxis the skin may be wrapped with occlusive plastic
film for 48 hours either before, during, or following application of topical
antimicrobial to determine the ability of the antimicrobial to suppress
microbial proliferation stimulated by the moist, warm environment of
occlusion.<p>
</ol>
B.  Testing Methodology <p>
Protocols should include methods to standardize the following variables in
animal models:<p>
<ol>
<li>  Location of contaminated wounds.
<li> Depth of incision.
<li> Type and quantity of inoculum.
<li>  Method of inoculation.
<li>  Time between inoculation and treatment.
<li>  Method of culturing.
<li>  Technique of treatment.
<li>  Method of wound closure.
<li>  System of grading infections.
</ol> <p>
The lesion is artificially made on the skin. Time is allowed for healing of the
lesions (24 hours).<p>

Pathogenic organisms are added to the lesion after 24 hours and allowed to
remain an appropriate period of time before application of
antibacterial/antifungal agents.<p>
In some testing situations, the normally occurring flora are allowed
to expand for varying times, producing successive replacement populations
before the antibacterial/antifungal is applied. In some instances, the
antibacterial/antifungal is added after 24-hour healing of the lesion to
prevent expansion of the flora.<p>

C. Animal Models for Skin Infection <p>
Several animal models have been used to demonstrate the therapeutic and
prophylactic effectiveness of topical antibacterials. In an extensive review of
such animal models, Miller (Reference #1) describes some of these 
models, including: the production of abscesses in inoculated suture stitches in
rats and guinea pigs; a rabbit ear-wound model; infection in inoculated and
depilated rat skin; surgical wounds in the rat; a burn model inoculated with
<i>Pseudomonas </i>&#160; in the rat. In addition to rats, guinea pigs and rabbits,
other test animals have included hamsters, mice, dogs and goats (References #1
- 13).<p>

Other methods for attempting to justify the inclusion of antifungal and/or
antiinflammatory components in topical/otic formulations are discussed in
Section IX.<p>

<h3>VIII. Inter-species Extrapolation and 
Dose Determination</h3>

The proper concentration of the active ingredient(s) and the proper vehicle of
a topical/otic drug may be tentatively selected based on non-target species
laboratory or clinical studies. (See Section IX, below.) Dose determination
studies in the target species will not ordinarily be required if a
therapeutically acceptable level of efficacy is demonstrated by controlled
studies in the target species involving the concentration(s) of the active
ingredient(s) and the vehicle tentatively selected from non-target species
studies. There are anatomical and physico-chemical differences among the human
and other animal species in the integument and external auditory canal.
However, in view of the above stated variables in Section IV and the basic
principles regarding vehicular components discussed in Section V, limited
differences in the concentration of active ingredient(s) and/or in vehicular
components may be only marginally significant or even essentially
irrelevant.<p>

Often, a topical/otic drug that is the subject of a new animal drug application
(NADA) is identical to, or a pharmaceutical equivalent of, a drug that is
approved under a new drug application (NDA) for use on humans. Unless the
individual circumstances require otherwise, CVM would not ordinarily object to
clinical testing in animals of a formulation that is identical to, or a
pharmaceutical equivalent of, an NDA-approved formulation without dose
determination studies having been conducted for the purpose of the NADA in
non-target species or in the target species. Additionally, each/all
component(s) in a formulation that is identical to or a pharmaceutical
equivalent of an NDA-approved formulation may also be tested in clinical
studies to establish "combination justification" for a veterinary drug, without
the necessity for prior dose titration studies having been conducted in the
target animal species.<p>
<h3>IX. Testing Procedures for Combination Topical/Otic Preparations</h3>

There are essentially three applicable components in the Center's
combination-drug policy: dose titration of the individual ingredients, testing
for an optimal combination (i.e., checking for non-interference and synergism),
and verification of the contribution of each constituent to the combination.
See 21 CFR 514.1(b)(8)(v) and CVM's <b>Guideline for Drug Combinations for Use
in Animals.</b>
<p>
The following is a schematic model that may be utilized in attempting to
determine efficacy for a 3-way combination 
(antiinflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal) (see also Section VIII, above):<p>

A.  Non-Target Species Studies: <p> <ol>
<li>Identify an optimum concentration (dose) and a vehicle that allows
expression of the activity of the antifungal component, using a guinea
pig/dermatophyte model; species other than guinea pig should be utilized when
necessary to achieve an appropriate, adaptable model. The dermatophyte(s) used
to induce the infections in the guinea pig will be pathogens known to infect
the target species. Clinical isolates, not stock cultures, should be used.<p>
<p>
<li>Using a bacterial challenge model in mice or other appropriate lab animal
species, develop similar data for the antibacterial component. Again the
pathogen used to induce the bacterial infection will be one known to infect the
target species. Clinical isolates, not stock cultures, should be used.<p>
<p>
<li>Using both of these models, demonstrate that the antimicrobial compounds are
compatible -- not antagonistic and, if synergistic, have the proper ratio of
the two to achieve desirable efficacy.<p>

<li>Recognized laboratory studies can be employed to demonstrate the
antiinflammatory effect and the relative potency of the antiinflammatory
component, i.e., thymus involution, liver glycogen deposition, eosinopenia,
carragheenan-induced edema response, etc. (Pharmacologic Techniques in Drug
Evaluation, Nodine &amp; Siegler, Chapter 69, pp. 491-500).<p>
<li>Using the same two models (above items 1 and 2), demonstrate that the
antiinflammatory agent does not interfere with the activity of either
antimicrobial. It has been shown previously that hydrocortisone is compatible
with an antibacterial for topical use. 
(Stritzler, C. &amp; I. Frank, A.M.A. Arch. Dermat. 71 1955, p. 736).<p>
</ol> <p>
B. Target Species Studies:
<p>
The proper concentrations of the active ingredients and the proper vehicle
would be tentatively selected from the above studies for further testing in the
target species. The following methodology would then be utilized to demonstrate
the contribution of each active ingredient, and overall efficacy in the target
species. <p>
  Group I    -   Appropriate control.<P>

  Group II   -   0 antifungal + optimal antibacterial <br>
                 + optimal antiinflammatory.<P>

  Group III   -  0 antibacterial + optimal antifungal <br>
                 + optimal antiinflammatory.<P>

  Group IV    -  0 antiinflammatory + optimal antifungal <br>
                 + optimal antibacterial.<P>
  Group V     -  Optimal antifungal <br>
                 + optimal antibacterial <br>
                 + optimal antiinflammatory.
<P>
The necessary group comparisons to verify that each component is contributing
to the combined efficacy of the product are as follows: <p> <ol>

<li>The antifungal action of Group V (3-way combo.) must be superior to that of
Group II to demonstrate the contribution of the antifungal agent.<p>

<li>The antibacterial action of Group V must be superior to that of Group III to
demonstrate the contribution of the antibacterial agent.<p>
<li>The antiinflammatory action of Group V must be superior to that of Group IV
to demonstrate the contribution of the antiinflammatory agent.<p>

<li>Group V must relate favorably to Group I with respect to all three drug
actions.</ol>
<p>
Conceptually, this methodology is appropriate for testing a new animal drug
against both artificially induced model infections and naturally occurring
infected cases in clinical field trials.<p>

The same basic concepts described above to test efficacy for a 3-way
combination may be appropriately reduced in scope for testing a product with a
single active ingredient or a 2-way combination.<p>

<h3>X. Summary</h3>
<p>
This guideline provides suggested directions for developmental design and
scientific evaluation of effectiveness studies for topical/otic animal drugs
containing any one or a combination of antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, and
antifungal agents. The document outlines critical elements involved in
establishing the rationale for a proposed product; defines topical categories;
identifies variables affecting efficacy; discusses the influence of drug
release from topical/otic preparations; provides classification, testing
methodology, and uses for animal models; enunciates a practical perspective for
assessing inter-species extrapolation and dose determination; and suggests
testing procedures for combination topical/otic preparations.<p>

<h3>EXHIBIT A</h3>
<p>
<b>An Etiological and Epidemiological Exposition of Canine and Feline Otitis
Externa</b>
<p>
Is there scientific justification or medical rationale for multi-ingredient
(antiinflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal) topical/otic preparations for use
on dogs and/or cats? Is there an identifiable population of dogs and/or cats
that would benefit from the use of the above described fixed 3-way drug
combination? The following information addresses the immediately preceding
issues.<p>

(1) Etiology: The cause of otitis externa is complex. Many factors have been
incriminated, but the exact etiology has not been determined. It has been
suggested that by the time the animal is presented for treatment the initial
cause may not be apparent.<p>

Factors associated with otitis externa are foreign bodies, matted hair, dried
wax, trauma to the ear from cleaning and examination, ectoparasites, allergic
response (generally associated with other allergic skin problems), bacterial
and fungal flora in the ear and excessive moisture. Probably the cause of
otitis externa is a combination of these factors. All the factors listed
produce irritation to the ear, which predisposes to the development of otitis
externa (Current Vet. Therapy, Kirk, VI Ed. 1977, Section 9, p 850).<p>
(2) The most frequent isolates from the ears of dogs and cats are yeasts of the
<i>Pityrosporon   spp.</i>&#160; and bacteria of the <i>Proteus spp., Pseudomonas spp.,
</i>&#160;and <i>Staphylococcus  spp. </i> &#160; It is felt that <i>Proteus  spp.</i>&#160; 
and  <i>Pseudomonas spp.  </i>&#160;can be primary pathogens in the disease. However,
<i>Staphylococcus  spp.</i>&#160; may be found in normal ears and may grow only in
response to inflammation initiated by some other factor.<p>

<i>Pityrosporon </i>&#160;is considered by some investigators to be a primary
pathogen and by others to be similar to <i>Staphylococcus. </i>&#160;If a pure
culture of <i>Pityrosporon </i>&#160;is isolated, it may be considered to be the
causative factor but could also be a secondary pathogen. Often there will be
mixed cultures from the ears, especially in chronic cases (Current Vet.
Therapy, Kirk, VI Ed. 1977, Section 9, pp 850-51).<p>
(3) The following summarizes relevant points relating to the microorganisms
occurring in conjunction with otitis externa in dogs and cats.<p>

<b>CONDUCT OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONS:
RESPONSIBILITIES OF
CLINICAL INVESTIGATORS AND MONITORS

<p>
CENTER FOR VETERINARY MEDICINE<p>
GUIDELINE<P>
<pre>
This guideline addresses the responsibilities under 21 CFR 511.1 
and section 512(j) of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(Act) of clinical investigators who conduct studies of investigational 
new animal drugs and of monitors of those studies. The guideline 
presents general principles and approaches for the conduct and 
monitoring of studies intended to investigate the effectiveness 
of a new animal drug. The guideline is equally applicable to
intramural and extramural research efforts intended to support a 
new animal drug application (NADA). All aspects of the guideline are 
not meant to apply to basic exploratory studies or other clinical 
studies not intended to be used to support an NADA, but the general 
principles stated in the guideline apply to all clinical studies. 
Thus, for example, clinical studies intended to support a food 
additive petition for animal use should be conducted in accordance 
with the guideline.

A guideline represents the agency's position on a procedure or 
practice at the time of its issuance. A guideline is not a legal 
requirement. A person may follow a guideline or may choose to follow 
alternative procedures or practices. If a person chooses to use 
alternate procedures or practices. that person may wish to discuss 
the matter further with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's
(FDA) Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) to prevent an expenditure 
of money and effort on activities that may later be determined to 
be unacceptable. A guideline does not bind the agency, and it does 
not create or confer any rights, privileges, immunities, or 
benefits for or on any person. When a guideline states a requirement 
imposed by statute or regulation, however, the requirement is law 
and its force and effect are not changed in any way by virtue of 
its inclusion in the guideline.

<b>I. CLINICAL INVESTIGATORS</b>
 
<b>A. Definition.</b>

The "investigator" is the individual, including one employed by 
or under contract to the sponsor, who conducts the study, who 
is responsible for the daily management of the study, who directs 
the administration or dispensing of the new animal drug, and who 
is responsible for implementing the study protocol and collecting 
and reporting study data. If a study is conducted by a group of
individuals, the investigator is the leader of the group. An 
individual may not serve as both the investigator and monitor 
of any one study. An individual who initiates an investigation 
(serves as a sponsor) and conducts studies relevant to the 
investigation is also included in the term investigator.

<b>B. Qualifications of investigators.</b>

An investigator must be qualified by scientific training and 
experience to conduct studies to investigate the effectiveness 
of a new animal drug and must understand all applicable 
requirements before receipt of a new animal drug.

<b>C. Responsibilities of investigators.</b>

    The investigator should:

    (1) Maintain in the study record a signed and dated copy of 
        the current study protocol, as amended; provide the reason for 
        each and every amendment and have it signed and dated by the 
        investigator and sponsor; record, and retain in the study 
        record any deviation from the protocol in a signed and 
        dated statement documenting the deviation and the reason 
        for its occurrence and also notify the sponsor of its 
        occurrence immediately;

    (2) Ensure that adequate and well-maintained facilities and 
        equipment, whether owned or leased are used to conduct the 
        study;

    (3) Ensure that the study is conducted according to the current 
        study protocol, as amended, all applicable regulations 
        including any authorization to slaughter animals treated 
        with an investigational new animal drug, for human food as 
        controlled by FDA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
        and any restrictions on the disposal of nonfood animals;

    (4) Collect and report the data in a manner that accurately and 
        completely reflects the unbiased observations of the study 
        (further information given is under paragraph(D) of this 
        section);
    
    (5) Be responsible for the control, storage, distribution, 
        and further mixing (if any) of the drug(s) shipped or 
        delivered to him by the sponsor for the conduct of  the 
        study: storage of the drug should be sufficiently secure 
        to provide controlled access to the investigational new 
        animal drug and be in accordance with the protocol and 
        label specifications;

    (6) Maintain records documenting drug receipt, distribution, 
        use, feed drug assay results (if further mixing by the 
        investigator is required), inventory levels, and the 
        disposition of any unused drug;

    (7) Ensure that any delegation of authority and work, including 
        any subcontracted work, is to individuals qualified by
        scientific training and experience to perform the assigned 
        duties;

    (8) Not redistribute the new animal drug to any individual not 
        authorized to receive the new animal drug;

    (9) Administer the new animal drug only to the number and type 
        of animals specified in the current study protocol, as
        amended;

    (10) Inform the owner of each animal that the new animal drug is 
        being used for research purposes, disclose the conditions of 
        any authorization to slaughter animals for human food or of 
        any restrictions on the disposal of non-food animals and 
        obtain and properly document the consent of such owner(s);

    (11) With the exception of privately-owned and housed animals, 
        which are maintained according to specific instructions 
        provided by the investigator, ensure that all animals are 
        kept under the direct supervision of the investigator or 
        individuals responsible to the investigator;

    (12) Comply with applicable laws and regulations governing 
        the humane care of animals and the proposed use of animals 
        intended for investigational purposes;

    (13) Ensure that the drug is administered according to the 
        correct dosing regimen, including dose, rate, route, and 
        duration of administration, and maintain records 
        documenting such facts;

    (14) Permit the study monitor or other authorized 
        representative of the sponsor, and FDA to inspect the 
        facilities used by the investigator for the study and, 
        for the purposes of verifying the validity of the data 
        collected for the sponsor, to inspect all records made or 
        kept by the investigator as part of or pertaining to the 
        study;
    
    (15) Document in the study record any veterinary care and 
        procedures, changes in animal health, or significant
        environmental changes; and

    (16) Maintain and retain all records and reports as described 
        below.

<b>D. Investigator recordkeeping and record retention.</b>

    (1) <b>Source data</b>.  Source data, for the purpose of this 
        guideline, means any work sheets, calibration data, 
        records, memoranda, or notes that reflect or are the 
        result of original observations and activities of a 
        study and that may be necessary to reconstruct and 
        evaluate the report of that study. "Source data"  may 
        include, but are not limited to, hand-recorded data 
        sheets, computer printouts, magnetic or electronic 
        media, dictated observations, photographic
        material, and data recorded from automated instruments. 
        The term "source data" is comparable to "raw data" as 
        used for non-clinical studies.
   
        <i>Valid </i>source data, whether handwritten or electronic, 
        should be attributable, original, accurate, contemporaneous, 
        and legible.  <i>Attributable </i>&#160;means the source data 
        can be traced, by signature (or initials) and date, to the 
        individual observing and recording the data. Should more than 
        one individual observe or record the data, that fact must be 
        reflected in the data entries. In automated data collection 
        systems, the individual responsible for direct data input 
        should be identified at the time of data input. <i>Original 
        </i>and <i>accurate </i>&#160;means the source data are the first
        true observations. <i>Contemporaneous </i>&#160;means the 
        source data are recorded at the time of observation. 
        <i>Legible </i>&#160;means the source data are readable, 
        recorded in a permanent medium (e.g. black ink for 
        written records and electronic records that are 
        unalterable), and, if corrected, corrected according to 
        accepted procedures.

        <i>Source data </i>&#160;should be maintained in an organized 
        manner and. where appropriate, be recorded in a bound 
        laboratory notebook or on forms designed specifically for 
        the recording of a particular observation(s). In particular,
        where both <i>animal patient records </i>&#160;and case report 
        forms are used, the initial recording of the observations 
        should be on the case report form; thereafter, the data 
        should be transcribed to the animal's patient record. This
        procedure makes the case report forms the source data. When 
        the first record of observation is on an animal patient 
        record, that record is considered the source data and 
        should be handled accordingly. In such a case, the data 
        transcribed from an animal patient record to the case 
        report form may be submitted to CVM in support of an 
        NADA in lieu of the animal patient record.

        <i>Any correction of source data </i>&#160;should be made so 
        as not to obscure the original entry, should be dated and 
        initialed at the time of the correction by the individual 
        making the correction  and should indicate the reason for 
        such change. If a portion of the source data needs to be 
        copied or transcribed for legibility, all information 
        from that portion of source data should be transferred 
        (including the properly noted corrections) and the reason 
        for the copying or  transcription explained in a dated 
        memorandum signed by the investigator. In such a case, 
        the source data, the copy or transcript of the source 
        data, and the memorandum should be kept together in the 
        study records.

        As protection against unintentional destruction, a true, 
        accurate and complete copy of the source data may be 
        prepared. The copy may be securely stored  with the 
        sponsor and replace the source data if they are 
        unintentionally destroyed.

    (2) <b>Animal records. </b>An investigator should prepare and 
        maintain complete and accurate records of all data pertinent 
        to all animals involved in the study. These records include, 
        but are not limited to, all observations, drug treatments, 
        veterinary care, descriptions, study selection criteria,
        and final  disposition.
    
    (3) <b>Disposition of drug. </b>An investigator is to 
        maintain signed or initialed, dated, complete, and 
        accurate records of the receipt and disposition of the 
        new animal drug, including the quantities used and the 
        final disposition. If the investigation is terminated, 
        suspended, discontinued, or completed, the investigator 
        should return any unused new animal drug, including feed 
        bearing or containing the new animal drug, to the sponsor 
        or otherwise provide for the safe disposition of the 
        unused new animal drug or feed bearing or containing the
        new animal drug.

    (4) <b>Retention of records.</b>

       (a)  <b>Records to be retained. </b>All source data, including 
            those produced electronically, and a copy of all 
            applicable reports discussed in this guideline, should 
            be retained by the investigator in a secure area which 
            protects the source data and records from deterioration, 
            destruction, tampering, and vandalism. The sponsor may 
            wish to keep a true, accurate, and complete copy of the 
            source data and reports in secure storage. That copy may 
            replace source data and records if they are  
            unintentionally destroyed.

       (b)  <b>Length of retention. </b>The investigator should retain 
            all source data, records and reports for a period of 2 
            years following the date on which an NADA, which is 
            supported by the results of the study, is approved for 
            the new animal drug or at least 5 years following the 
            date on which the results of the study are submitted 
            to FDA in support of an NADA, as informed in writing 
            by the sponsor. (If both conditions apply in a 
            particular situation, the shorter time period should 
            control.) If the investigator retires, relocates, goes 
            out of business, or for any other reason withdraws 
            from the responsibility of maintaining records for 
            the period of time requested, custody of all source 
            data and records should be transferred to the archives 
            of the sponsor. FDA should receive notice from the
            from the sponsor prior to such a transfer. 


<b>E. Investigator records and reports.</b>

    (1) <b>Safety reports. </b>An investigator should immediately 
        report to the sponsor any adverse effect related to human, 
        animal, or environmental  safety. Other adverse effects, 
        including deviations from expected performance or behavior     
        patterns of the animals not resulting in harm to the 
        animals used in the study, should be described as to their 
        nature and duration in a signed and dated statement in 
        the study record. All adverse effects should be noted in 
        the final investigator study report.

    (2) <b>Communication records. </b>The investigator should 
        maintain a truthful, accurate and complete record of all 
        visits and telephone conversations concerning the study. 
        This record should include, but not be limited to, visits      
        or other communications with the study monitor or other
        representatives of the sponsor and with representatives of 
        FDA. This record should also include the time and date of 
        the visit or telephone conversation, its purpose,the 
        name, title, and organizational affiliation of the 
        individual(s) involved, and a factual summary of the 
        visit or telephone conversation. All written 
        correspondence (both issued and received), guidance, 
        and written instructions should be maintained as a
        part of these records.

    (3) <b>Investigator study report. </b>Upon completion of each study 
        the investigator should prepare and submit to the sponsor 
        a signed, dated, detailed, and independent report that 
        describes all observations made during the study. The first 
        report submitted to the sponsor is the investigator's 
        "final" study report. Any and all subsequent changes to the
        report should be considered as amendments. The report should
        include sufficient detail to allow reconstruction or 
        replication of the study. The final investigator study 
        report should include, but not be limited to, the following:

        (a) The name, physical location, and mailing address of the 
            investigator, the specific facilities where each study was 
            performed, and the location of all animals during the 
            study if other than the investigator's facilities 
            specified above: 
            
        (b) The dates on which the study was initiated and 
            completed:

        (c) The objectives and procedures used in the conduct of 
            the study, a description of all management practices 
            used, and a record of all daily observations:

        (d) The number, species, breed or stock, sex, size, age, 
            and, when applicable, source of supply, physiological 
            state (e.g., lactating, prepubertal), disease state, 
            or other pertinent pathological findings of the animals 
            used, identification procedures, and final disposition 
            records for each animal;

        (e) The new animal drug identified by name, identity, 
            strength, purity, composition, quantity, and batch 
            or code mark to the extent known by the investigator:

        (f) A description of the dosing regimen, including dose, 
            rate, route, and duration of the administration with 
            the new animal drug;

        (g) A description of all adverse effects as described in 
            subparagraph (E)(1) of this Section, observed during 
            the study;

        (h) A description of all circumstances that could have 
            affected the quality or integrity of the data, speci-
            fying the time frame and the extent of their 
            occurrence;

        (i) The name of the study monitor and the associates, 
            colleagues, subcontractors, and employees of the 
            investigator involved, and the nature and extent 
            of their participation in the study;

        (j) The location of all source data and study records 
            and a statement as to whether any true, accurate, 
            and complete copy of the source data records was made;

        (k) A statement attesting to the accuracy and completeness 
            of the final investigator study report and stating 
            whether the data were collected in compliance with the 
            Act and FDA regulations for submission to FDA; and

        (l) An accurate and complete copy of all source data, 
            records, and reports obtaining to the study.

    (4) <b>Report amendments. </b>Any addition, deletion, or 
        correction to the final investigator study report should 
        be in the form of an amendment by the investigator. The 
        amendment should clearly identify that part of the study
        report that is being added, deleted, or corrected and the 
        reasons for the addition, deletion, or correction, and 
        should be signed and dated by the investigator and by the 
        individual who requested the amendment.

    (5) <b>Retention of reports. </b>The investigator should maintain 
        in the study records a true, accurate, and complete copy 
        of any record or report generated during or after the study 
        which includes, but is not limited to the final investigator      
        study report and all amendments.

<b>F. Inspection of investigator's records and reports.</b>

    FDA will not ordinarily accept any study as fulfilling a 
    requirement for approval of an NADA if the investigator who 
    conducted the study refuses to permit an inspection of all 
    pertinent records, any ongoing study, or facilities concerning 
    any FDA regulated product. The determination that a study will 
    not be accepted in support of an NADA does not, however, 
    relieve the sponsor of such a study of any responsibility  
    under any applicable statute or regulation to submit the 
    results of the study to FDA.

<b>II. MONITORS</b>

<b>A. Definition</b> 

    The monitor is the individual representing the sponsor who 
    oversees the investigator's implementation of a protocol, 
    the progress of the study, and ensures that the study is 
    conducted in accordance with all applicable requirements. 
    An individual may not serve as both the monitor and 
    investigator for any one study.

<b>B. Qualification of monitors</b>

    Monitors should be qualified by scientific training and 
    experience to monitor the investigator's implementation of a 
    protocol. They should be trained in quality control techniques 
    and data auditing procedures. Monitors should understand the 
    requirements for adequate and well-controlled studies. Monitors
    should understand all applicable requirements and be able to 
    determine whether the study was conducted in accordance with 
    these requirements.

<b>C. Prestudy visits</b>

    A monitor should:

    (1) Personally visit the facility of each investigator prior 
        to the investigator's initiation of each new study unless 
        such a visit has been made within one year prior to the 
        initiation of the new study (an investigator conducting 
        certain studies with limited numbers of animals of
        minor animal species or wild, free-ranging animals may 
        not need to be visited within this one year period); if 
        a previous FDA of inspection has indicated that a 
        corrective action is necessary, the monitor should
        personally visit the facility to ensure that the proper 
        corrective action has been taken prior to the initiation 
        of the new study;

    (2) Ensure that the investigator understands the investigational 
        status of the new animal drug, the nature and details of 
        the study protocol, the conditions of any authorization 
        to slaughter animals for human food or of any restrictions        
        on the disposal of nonfood animals (if applicable), and
        accepts his responsibilities in conducting the study as 
        described in Section I;

    (3) Ensure that the investigator has adequate facilities and 
        access to appropriate materials, resources, and an adequate 
        number of suitable animals to conduct the study;

    (4) Ensure that each investigator understands and agrees to 
        comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the 
        humane care of animals and the proposed use of animals 
        intended for investigational purposes; and 
        
    (5) Determine that the investigator and any individual involved 
        in the study will be able to devote appropriate time to the 
        proposed study.

<b>D. Periodic visits.</b>

A monitor should:

    (1) Maintain personal contact with the investigator at the site 
        of the study with sufficient frequency during the conduct 
        of each study to ensure that the responsibilities of the 
        investigator are being fulfilled: if the interval between        
        visits will be greater than 3 months, the monitor should
        explicitly state in the records the reason(s) for the longer 
        interval. The monitor should never, in any way, bias or be 
        a part of the record-keeping or the data collection      
        process, other than to ensure that the current study 
        protocol, as amended, and applicable requirements are 
        being followed. 
        
    (2)  Review the source data and other documents necessary to 
        make a determination that the responsibilities of the 
        investigator are being met for accuracy and completeness 
        of information:

    (3) Ensure that illegible or missing data and corrected data 
        entries are fully explained: and

    (4) Where associates of the investigator prepare a portion of 
        any report, ensure that the investigator reviews and verifies 
        the accuracy and validity of that portion and its 
        compatibility with the source data and study records.

<b>E. Records of communications with the investigators.</b>

    (1) The monitor should maintain a copy of all written 
        correspondence sent to or received from the investigator.

    (2) The monitor should prepare and maintain a truthful, 
        accurate, and complete records of each visit conducted. 
        These records should include the following:

        (a) The date(s) and time of each visit;

        (b) The name of all individuals involved;

        (c) The name, physical location, and mailing address of the 
            investigator visited;

        (d) A statement of the purpose of the visit; and

        (e) A summary of the factual findings sufficient to 
            describe the basis for the monitors evaluation and 
            conclusions and any actions taken by the monitor 
            and/or the investigator as a result of the visit.

<b>F.   Monitor's certification statement</b>

    The monitor should sign and date an affirmative statement, to be 
    included with the NADA, that identifies the study and states the 
    dates of visits to the study site, and certifies that the study 
    was monitored in accordance with this guideline and that the 
    findings from such visits were conveyed to the investigator and 
    the sponsor in a timely manner.

April 22. 1994, DRAFT

<b><P>Introduction</b><P>
<P>
In September 1990, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM or Center)
announced a policy of zero <I>salmonella</I> in animal feeds (Reference 5). Zero
<I>salmonella</I> in animal feeds may be achieved in several ways, including
the addition of chemical substances to the feeds. Such substances are deemed to
be unsafe food additives under section 409(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (the Act) (Reference 4), 21 SC 348(a), because none of them is
currently approved or generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use against
<I>salmonella</I> present in feeds. According to the Act, a food additive is
deemed to be unsafe unless it and its use or intended use conform to the terms
of an exemption or existing regulation prescribing the conditions under which
such additive may be safely used.
<P>
Companies or individuals (sponsors) intending to market an antimicrobial food
additive for use against <I>salmonella</I> in feeds are thus required by
section 409(b) of the Act to file a food additive petition to establish the
safety of the food additive for such use. Regulations governing the filing of
food additive petitions and setting out the conditions under which a food
additive or food containing a food additive intended for investigational use
shall be exempt from the requirements of section 409 of the Act can be found in
title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (Reference 3) under part 571, section
1 (21 CFR 571.1), and part 570, section 17 (21 CFR 570.17), respectively.
Briefly, a food additive petition must contain data establishing that the food
additive is safe and will have the intended effect and identify the amount of
additive necessary to accomplish this effect.
<P>
Our experience with food additive petitions indicates need for consistency in
evaluating the ability of anti-<I>salmonella</I> food additives to
achieve their intended effect of controlling <I>salmonella</I> in feeds. Thus,
the objective of these guidelines is to help to assure that appropriate utility
studies are conducted by sponsors and that uniform review and decision-making
are accomplished by CVM. This would facilitate the approval process for such
food additives.

<b><P>General considerations</b><P>

These guidelines pertain only to utility studies for chemical food
additives intended for use against <I>salmonella</I> present in feeds. Our
present policy is that such substances will be considered for approval only if
they are intended for use in maintaining <I>salmonella</I> free feeds free of
<I>salmonella</I> even after repeated exposure of the feeds to the
microorganism. Experiments designed to establish the utility of an
antimicrobial food additive for this purpose should be conducted in two main
stages consisting of laboratory and field trials. These trials should be well
planned and documented as protocols.


<P>
A protocol should contain a clearly expressed statement of purpose ,and details
of the materials, methods, and statistical tools that will be used in the
trial. The experiments should be designed to utilize finished feeds usually
consumed by the proposed target animal(s), and/or ingredients used in
manufacturing such feeds. Ingredients should be in compliance with definitions
specified for such feeds by the Association of American Feed Control Officials
(AAFCO). Finished feeds should be shown, by calculation and laboratory
analysis, to meet the nutritional requirements established for the target
animal(s) by the most current recommendations of the National Research Council
of the United States National Academy of Sciences. The target animal(s) should
be specified. For food additives containing two or more chemicals, the
composition of the food additive and the amount of each chemical must be
specified.
<P>
Sponsors are not required to submit protocols for review by CVM, and CVM review
does not bind the Center to accept data generated using such protocols. All the
same, sponsors are strongly encouraged to submit such protocols and do so well
before the initiation of experiment. Submitting the protocols to CVM for review
and comments before conducting the experiments generally facilitates the
approval process for the food additive.
<P>
Data should be collected and recorded in ways that will enhance confidence in
the integrity of data collected. Sponsors are referred to the Center's
guideline entitled "Conduct of Clinical Investigations: Responsibilities of
Clinical Investigators and Monitors for Investigational New Animal Drug Trials"
for detailed information about record keeping and record retention. To
facilitate the Center's review of statistical procedures, data used by the
sponsor in statistical analyses should also be captured on a diskette,
preferably in the form of an IBM compatable DOS ASCII file.  The diskette
should be included in the food additive petition.

<P><b>Laboratory trials</b><P>

<B>General</B>
<P>
The susceptibility of <I>salmonella</I> to insults has been shown to be
dependent on several factors, including water activity, pH, temperature, oxygen
content, type of medium, mode of contamination of medium, type of <I>salmonella</I>
intensify of the insult, and the duration of contact between <I>salmonella</I>
and the insult (Reference 11) .It is possible that manipulation of
these factors could, in the absence of uniform testing methods, result in the
overestimation of the anti-<I>salmonella</I> capabilities of food additives. To
ensure that the data relied on by the FDA to approve anti-<I>salmonella</I>
substances are not flawed because of these variables, the Center believes
that the substances should be subjected to a uniform testing method.
<P>
The goal of the uniform testing method should be to determine, in a consistent
manner, whether or not the anti-<I>salmonella</I> chemical food additives.are
able to maintain <I>salmonella</I>-free feeds free of <I>salmonella</I> for a
minimum of 14 days even if the feeds are repeatedly exposed to <I>salmonella</I>
during the period. Sponsors should conduct two laboratory experiments: a
"dose titration study" to determine the range of effective doses of the food
additive, and a "prevention of recontamination" study to assess the ability of
the minimum effective dose to maintain <I>salmonella</I>-free feeds free of
<I>salmonella</I> despite repeated exposure of the feeds to the microorganism.
The "prevention of recontamination" experiment should be duplicated in a
different laboratory by a different investigator. The specific requirements for
each of the two experiments follow:

<B>Dose titration (dose determination) study</B>
<P>
The CVM considers the "dose titration" study to be pivotal. The main purpose of
the study is to determine the range of doses over which the food additive is
effective against <I>salmonella</I> in feeds. As much as it is possible, the
range determined should include the minimum and maximum effective doses.
Various concentrations of the food additive should be tested against a mixture
of serotypes of <I>salmonella</I> inoculated into feed. The concentrations of
food additive used should be multiples of the proposed effective dose. That
dose should have been estimated earlier by the sponsor in preliminary studies
using standard laboratory techniques. A minimum of six concentrations of the
food additive in feed is recommended. One should be at zero, another at the
proposed effective dose, and two each below and above the proposed effective
dose (e.g. 0, 0.25X, 0.50X, 2.00X, and 4.00X; where X is the proposed effective
dose). When using data from the experiments to plot the dose response curve,
the dependent variable would be the concentration of <I>salmonella</I> in the
sample of feed while the independent variable would be the concentration of
food additive.
<P>
The feed used should be sterilized and efficacy of the techniques utilized in
sterilizing assessed by determining the microbiological profile of
representative samples collected from the feed before and after sterilization.
Components of that profile should include:
<UL>
	<LI>	 Aerobic plate count

	 <LI> <I>Escherichia coli</I> count

   <LI> 	Fungal spore count

	<LI>	Presence or absence of <I>salmonella</I>
</UL>
<P>
The sterilized feed should be divided into a minimum of seven lots,
including one control and one negative control. Each lot should be separately
treated with an appropriate amount of the food additive and then subdivided
into twelve or more units. The units should be randomly assigned to one of four
groups containing equal number of units. There should be three or more units
per group. Portions of each unit should be assayed for the food additive and
the remainder inoculated with <I>salmonella</I>. Throughout the experiment,
both the control containing <I>salmonella</I> but not the food additive and the
negative control containing neither <I>salmonella</I> nor the food additive,
should be handeled exactly like the other experimental lots of feed.
<P>
The method used in inoculating experimental feeds with <I>salmonella</I> can
influence the outcome of the dose titration study. Three methods are currently
available. Each involves inoculation with one of the following:

<UL> <LI>	Materials naturally contaminated with <I>salmonella</I>

 <LI>	Materials contaminated with <I>salmonella</I> in a way that
simulates natural contamination (simulated naturally contaminated materials)

	<LI>	Broth cultures of <I>salmonella</I>
</UL>
<P>
Contamination or recontamination of feeds with <I>salmonella</I> can occur
through several avenues including infected or contaminated wild birds, rats,
mice, and cockroaches (Reference 11) and it appears logical to utilize naturally
contaminated materials (e.g. feces) from these sources as inoculi for
experimental feeds. However, the use of this natural method of contamination
would be incompatible with the goal of uniform testing, because the
concentration of <I>salmonella</I> in such materials varies widely. Broth
cultures can be manipulated to provide inoculi containing fairly uniform
amounts of <I>salmonella</I> and their use in inoculation will significantly
reduce the. variability in <I>salmonella</I> concentration associated with the
natural method. However, the direct contamination of experimental feeds with
such inoculi may result in an overestimation of the ability of the food
additive to achieve its intended effect because <I>salmonella</I> present in
broth culture-inoculated feeds has been shown to be less resistant to insults
than that  present in naturally contaminated feeds (Reference 10). The use of a
method involving inoculation with simulated naturally-contaminated materials
will overcome, to a large extent, the deficiencies (variability in
concentration and reduction in resistance of <I>salmonella</I>) associated with
the natural and broth culture methods. Therefore, this method involving the
inoculation of feeds with simulated naturally-contaminated materials is
recommended.
<P>
A technique for producing simulated naturally-contaminated meat and bone meal
containing stable populations of <I>salmonella</I> has been described by Liu
and his co-workers (Reference 9), who also showed that the <I>salmonella</I>
present in feeds inoculated with the meal was more resistant to insults
than that present in feeds directly inoculated with broth cultures of
<I>salmonella</I>. Briefly, in the Liu et al technique, a sterile
suspension of meat and bone meal inoculated with
<I>salmonella</I> was incubated for 48 hr at 37 &#176; C. After
incubation, the suspension was centrifuged and the sediment dried, ground to a
fine powder and stored at 4 &#176; C pending its use as the inoculum for
experimental feeds. The population of <I>salmonella</I> in the meal was
reported to remain relatively stable over an 11-month period.
<P>
To produce simulated naturally-contaminated materials for use as inoculi for
experimental feeds in the dose titration study, sponsors should utilize the Liu
et al technique or any other similar one that is shown to equally or
more effectively ensure the stability of <I>salmonella</I> even during cold
storage.
<P>
One gram of inoculum should be deposited on a spot inside, and another on a
spot on top of, each unit without mixing. The inoculum should contain equal
amounts of ATCC cultures of <I>Salmonella typhimurium</I>, <I>Salmonella senftenberg</I>,
<I>Salmonella montevideo</I>, and <I>Salmonella enteritidis</I>, <I> S. typhimurium</I> is
being considered because of its universal nature, <I>S. senftenberg</I>.
because it has been reported to be one of the more resistant
serotypes (Reference 9),<I> S. montivideo</I> because it is reported to be the
serotype most frequently isolated from feeds and is said to have a relatively
high resistance (Reference 8), and <I>S. enteritidis</I> because it is a major
public health concern. Other <I>salmonella</I> serotypes that are of animal or
public health significance could be included by the sponsor, if desired.
<P>
Each inoculum should contain 10^8 colony-forming units (cfu) of <I>salmonella</I>.
It has been reported that the concentration of <I>salmonella</I> in the
feces of naturally infected mice can be as high as 2.3 x 10^5 cfu/fecal pellet
or 2.6 x 10^7 cfu/g of feces (Reference 6).
<P>
Because the antimicrobial activity of organic acids and other chemicals appear
to be time-dependent, the design of the dose titration study should permit
elucidation of the nature of that time-dependency when the chemicals are used
as antimicrobial food additives. The preferred method for achieving this is the
generation of a series of dose titration curves using data obtained from
analyses of the experimental units of feed at 1, 8, 24 and 48 hours after
inoculation of the feeds with <I>salmonella</I>. The four groups of feed should
be used for this purpose. The amount of inoculated feed constituting individual
units in each group should be enough to ensure its adequacy for quantitative
and qualitative analyses for <I>salmonella</I>. The number of samples to be collected
from each unit for <I>salmonella</I> analysis should be determined by a
statistical model that instills a 99% confidence that the two inoculi in the
unit will be captured among the samples collected. The analysis of all of the
inoculated feed in each unit would be compatible with this model.
<P>
Temperature, pH, water activity and other pertinent experimental conditions
should be specified. The experiment should be repeated one or more
times.Study of ability to maintain <I>salmonella</I>-free feed
free of <I>salmonella</I>.
<P>
The purpose of the second laboratory experiment is to demonstrate the
ability of the food additive to maintain <I>salmonella</I>-free feeds free of
<I>salmonella</I> for a minimum of 14 days, even if the feeds are repeatedly
exposed to <I>salmonella</I> during the period. !n this study, the level of
food additive determined in the dose titration study to be the minimum
effective dose should be added to sterilized feed, and challenged with
<I>salmonella</I> contained in a simulated naturally-contaminated material as
described earlier under the dose titration study. The challenge with
<I>salmonella</I> should be conducted at the beginning of the experiment and
again at day 14. A minimum of six representative samples each should be
collected from the treated feed and its controls at two time intervals after
each challenge with <I>salmonella</I> and analyzed qualitatively for
<I>salmonella</I>. The first time interval should be that at which the minimum
dose of the food additive was shown to be effective in the dose titration
study, and the second one 24 hours afterwards. The quantity of feed used in the
study should be enough to ensure its adequacy for the analysis for
<I>salmonella</I>. All of the feed should be used in analysis. As with the dose
titration study, temperature, pH, water activity, and other pertinent
experimental conditions should be specified. The experiment should also have
proper controls including a negative blank group and contain an adequate number
of replicates. The duration of the experiment and the number of challenges with
<I>salmonella</I> should be increased if a sponsor intends to claim a residual
effect for an anti-<I>salmonella</I> food additive that is longer than 14 days.
As stated earlier, this experiment should be duplicated in a different
laboratory by a different investigator.
<P>
The feeds used in the laboratory trials should consist of specified quantities
of compound feeds (e.g. broiler starter) and/or feeds intended for use in
manufacturing compound feeds (e.g. meat and bone meal). The feed used should
either be obtained commercially or self-produced. Details of the composition of
compound feeds (including all added drugs and additives) and the techniques
used for their manufacturing or processing should be specified. The amount of
feed assigned to each experimental group should be enough to permit the
collection of all required samples.
<P>
<P><b>Field trials</b><P>
<P>
The dose of food additive determined during the dose titration study to
be the appropriate effective dose should be further evaluated in field trials.
The purpose of a field trial is to determine if the food additive could be
safely used to achieve its technical effect(s) under actual conditions of use.
Such conditions of use would include those associated with the preparation,
storage and consumption of food additive-treated feeds. The quantity of feeds
used in the field trials and the conditions under which they are
manufactured/produced, stored, transported, and consumed should be the same as
those expected when the food additive is approved for use. Details of the
composition of the feeds should be specified and include all added drugs, GRAS
substances, and food additives. Samples should be collected from feeds at
specified locations and analyzed for <I>salmonella</I>. For feeds like meat and
bone meal, which are intended for use in manufacturing compound feeds, samples
should be collected immediately before and after the addition of food additive
and also immediately prior to usage of the food additive-treated feeds in
compounding. For compound feeds like broiler or hog starter rations, samples
should be collected immediately before and after the addition of the food
additive, and also just before and during the entire period the food
additive-treated feeds are made available for consumption by the target
animals. The number of samples to be collected at each location should be
determined by a statistical model that instills a 99% confidence that
<I>salmonella</I> will be captured among samples collected even if the
concentration of the microorganism in the feed was as low as 1 cfu/500
g. Additional criteria might need to be satisfied in field investigations
involving anti-<I>salmonella</I> chemical food additives intended for use
in the feeds of aquatic animals. Sponsors of such food additives are
referred to the Center's "Guideline for the evaluation of the Utility of Food
Additives in diets fed to Aquatic Animals."
<P>
 Because food additives are approved
for use on a nationwide basis, trials should be conducted in at least three
geographically different locations and during two different seasons of the
year, one of which should be the summer. Additional trials could be conducted
during one or both of the other seasons of the year if so desired by the
sponsor.

<P><b>Collection and analysis of samples</b><P>

The sampling techniques employed in this type of study are critical to
the validity of results obtained. Samples should be aseptically collected
without unduly disturbing the experimental feeds or target animals consuming
the feeds. FDA's Bacteriological Analytical Manual (Reference 2) contains
pertinent information about sample handling.
<P>
The time of sample collection should be recorded and scheduled so that storage
of samples prior to analysis is avoided as much as possible. If it is necessary
to store the samples, the conditions under which the samples are stored (e.g.,
temperature) should be specified and shown not to be inimical to either the
survival of <I>salmonella</I> or the maintenance of the integrity of nutrients.
The duration of storage should also be specified.
<P>
Laboratory analysis for <I>salmonella</I> should be initiated and the first
stages completed preferably within one hour after sample collection. If this is
not feasible, the activity of food additive in samples used for <I>salmonella</I>
analysis should be arrested immediately after sample collection using a
compound/technique that has been shown not to have any negative impact on the
survival of <I>salmonella</I>. The length of time between the collection of
samples and their analysis for <I>salmonella</I> should be specified.
<P>
Laboratory analyses should be conducted "blind." It is recommended that the
experimental feeds should be prepared and coded by one person or team and
samples collected from the feeds analyzed by a different person or team unaware
of the concentration of the food additive in the samples. If it is necessary to
transport samples, they should be packaged to ensure the maintenance of their
microbiological integrity during transportation. and sent by the fastest means
possible.
<P>
The concentration of <I>salmonella</I> present in feeds used in the dose
titration study should be determined by standard dilution and pour-plate
technique. In addition, because the sensitivity of this quantitative technique
is low when used in isolating <I>salmonella</I> from feeds containing injured
and/or very small numbers of <I>salmonella</I>, the technique should be
supplemented by a qualitative procedure that includes preenrichment-enrichment.
Samples of feed collected for <I>salmonella</I> analysis during field trials
should be analyzed qualitatively to determine the presence or absence of the
microorganism. The use of the quantitative and qualitative methods described in
the FDA's Bacteriological Analytical Manual (Reference 1,7) is recommended.
However, sponsors can use other analytical techniques provided those techniques
are demonstrated to be at least as sensitive and specific for
<I>salmonella</I>.

              nontopical antibacterial ingredient or animal drug, the
              Secretary shall not issue an order under paragraph (1)(E)
              refusing to approve an application for a combination animal 
              drug intended for use other than in animal feed or drinking
              water unless the Secretary finds that the application fails to
              demonstrate that--

                  ingredient or animal drug intended only for the same use as
                  another active ingredient or animal drug in the combination
                  makes a contribution to labeled effectiveness;

                  disparate dosing regimens, such active ingredients or 
                  animal drugs are physically compatible or do not have
                  disparate dosing regimens; and

                  nontopical antibacterial ingredient or animal drug, there 
                  is substantial evidence that each of the nontopical

            (d) PRESUBMISSION CONFERENCE- Section 512(b) (21 U.S.C. 360b(b))
          is amended by adding at the end the following:
            `(3) Any person intending to file an application under paragraph
          (1) or a request for an investigational exemption under subsection
          (j) shall be entitled to one or more conferences prior to such
          submission to reach an agreement acceptable to the Secretary
          establishing a submission or an investigational requirement, which
          may include a requirement for a field investigation. A decision
          establishing a submission or an investigational requirement shall
          bind the Secretary and the applicant or requestor unless (A) the
          Secretary and the applicant or requestor mutually agree to modify
          the requirement, or (B) the Secretary by written order determines
          that a substantiated scientific requirement essential to the
          determination of safety or effectiveness of the animal drug 
          involved has appeared after the conference. No later than 25
          calendar days after each such conference, the Secretary shall
          provide a written order setting forth a scientific justification
          specific to the animal drug and intended uses under consideration 
          if the agreement referred to in the first sentence requires more
          than one field investigation as being essential to provide
          substantial evidence of effectiveness for the intended uses of the
          drug. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as compelling 
          the Secretary to require a field investigation.'.
            (e) IMPLEMENTATION- 
                (1) IN GENERAL- Not later than 6 months after the date of
              enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human
              Services shall issue proposed regulations implementing the
              amendments made by this Act as described in paragraph (2)(A) of
              this subsection, and not later than 18 months after the date of
              enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue final
              regulations implementing such amendments. Not later than 12
              months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary
              shall issue proposed regulations implementing the other
              amendments made by this Act as described in paragraphs (2)(B)
              and (2)(C) of this subsection, and not later than 24 months
              after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall
              issue final regulations implementing such amendments.
                (2) CONTENTS- In issuing regulations implementing the
              amendments made by this Act, and in taking an action to review
              an application for approval of a new animal drug under section
              512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C.
              360b), or a request for an investigational exemption for a new
              animal drug under subsection (j) of such section, that is
              pending or has been submitted prior to the effective date of 
              the regulations, the Secretary shall--
                    (A) further define the term `adequate and well
                  controlled', as used in subsection (d)(3) of section 512 of
                  such Act, to require that field investigations be designed
                  and conducted in a scientifically sound manner, taking into
                  account practical conditions in the field and differences
                  between field conditions and laboratory conditions;
                    (B) further define the term `substantial evidence', as
                  defined in subsection (d)(3) of such section, in a manner
                  that encourages the submission of applications and
                  supplemental applications; and
                    (C) take into account the proposals contained in the
                  citizen petition (FDA Docket No. 91P-0434/CP) jointly
                  submitted by the American Veterinary Medical Association 
                  and the Animal Health Institute, dated October 21, 1991.
              Until the regulations required by subparagraph (A) are issued,
              nothing in the regulations published at 21 C.F.R. 514.111(a)(5)
              (April 1, 1996) shall be construed to compel the Secretary of
              Health and Human Services to require a field investigation 
              under section 512(d)(1)(E) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
              Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(d)(1)(E)) or to apply any of its
              provisions in a manner inconsistent with the considerations for
              scientifically sound field investigations set forth in
              subparagraph (A).
            (f) MINOR SPECIES AND USES- The Secretary of Health and Human
          Services shall consider legislative and regulatory options for
          facilitating the approval under section 512 of the Federal Food,
          Drug, and Cosmetic Act of animal drugs intended for minor species
          and for minor uses and, within 18 months after the date of 
          enactment of this Act, announce proposals for legislative or
          regulatory change to the approval process under such section for
          animal drugs intended for use in minor species or for minor uses.
          SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON RESIDUES.
            Section 512(d)(1)(F) (21 U.S.C. 360b(d)(1)(F)) is amended to read
          as follows:
                `(F) upon the basis of information submitted to the Secretary
              as part of the application or any other information before the
              Secretary with respect to such drug, any use prescribed,
              recommended, or suggested in labeling proposed for such drug
              will result in a residue of such drug in excess of a tolerance
              found by the Secretary to be safe for such drug;'.
          SEC. 4. IMPORT TOLERANCES.
            Section 512(a) (21 U.S.C. 360b(a)) is amended by adding the
          following new paragraph at the end:
            `(6) For purposes of section 402(a)(2)(D), a use or intended use
          of a new animal drug shall not be deemed unsafe under this section
          if the Secretary establishes a tolerance for such drug and any
          edible portion of any animal imported into the United States does
          not contain residues exceeding such tolerance. In establishing such
          tolerance, the Secretary shall rely on data sufficient to
          demonstrate that a proposed tolerance is safe based on similar food
          safety criteria used by the Secretary to establish tolerances for
          applications for new animal drugs filed under subsection (b)(1). 
          The Secretary may consider and rely on data submitted by the drug
          manufacturer, including data submitted to appropriate regulatory
          authorities in any country where the new animal drug is lawfully
          used or data available from a relevant international organization,
          to the extent such data are not inconsistent with the criteria used
          by the Secretary to establish a tolerance for applications for new
          animal drugs filed under subsection (b)(1). For purposes of this
          paragraph, `relevant international organization' means the Codex
          Alimenterius Commission or other international organization deemed
          appropriate by the Secretary. The Secretary may, under procedures
          specified by regulation, revoke a tolerance established under this
          paragraph if information demonstrates that the use of the new 
          animal drug under actual use conditions results in food being
          imported into the United States with residues exceeding the
          tolerance                           or if scientific evidence shows
          the tolerance to be unsafe.'.
          SEC. 5. VETERINARY FEED DIRECTIVES.
            (a) SECTION 503- Section 503(f)(1)(A) (21 U.S.C. 353(f)(1)(A)) is
          amended by inserting after `other than man' the following: `, other
          than a veterinary feed directive drug intended for use in animal
          feed or an animal feed bearing or containing a veterinary feed
          directive drug,'.
            (b) SECTION 504- The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is
          amended by inserting after section 503 the following:
                            `VETERINARY FEED DIRECTIVE DRUGS
            `SEC. 504. (a)(1) A drug intended for use in or on animal feed
          which is limited by an approved application filed pursuant to
          section 512(b) to use under the professional supervision of a
          licensed veterinarian is a veterinary feed directive drug. Any
          animal feed bearing or containing a veterinary feed directive drug
          shall be fed to animals only by or upon a lawful veterinary feed
          directive issued by a licensed veterinarian in the course of the
          veterinarian's professional practice. When labeled, distributed,
          held, and used in accordance with this section, a veterinary feed
          directive drug and any animal feed bearing or containing a
          veterinary feed directive drug shall be exempt from section 502(f).
            `(2) A veterinary feed directive is lawful if it--
                `(A) contains such information as the Secretary may by 
              general regulation or by order require; and
                `(B) is in compliance with the conditions and indications for
              use of the drug set forth in the notice published pursuant to
              section 512(i).
            `(3)(A) Any persons involved in the distribution or use of animal
          feed bearing or containing a veterinary feed directive drug and the
          licensed veterinarian issuing the veterinary feed directive shall
          maintain a copy of the veterinary feed directive applicable to each
          such feed, except in the case of a person distributing such feed to
          another person for further distribution. Such person distributing
          the feed shall maintain a written acknowledgment from the person to
          whom the feed is shipped stating that that person shall not ship or
          move such feed to an animal production facility without a 
          veterinary feed directive or ship such feed to another person for
          further distribution unless that person has provided the same
          written acknowledgment to its immediate supplier.
            `(B) Every person required under subparagraph (A) to maintain
          records, and every person in charge or custody thereof, shall, upon
          request of an officer or employee designated by the Secretary,
          permit such officer or employee at all reasonable times to have
          access to and copy and verify such records.
            `(C) Any person who distributes animal feed bearing or containing
          a veterinary feed directive drug shall upon first engaging in such
          distribution notify the Secretary of that person's name and place 
          of business. The failure to provide such notification shall be
          deemed to be an act which results in the drug being misbranded.
            `(b) A veterinary feed directive drug and any feed bearing or
          containing a veterinary feed directive drug shall be deemed to be
          misbranded if their labeling fails to bear such cautionary 
          statement and such other information as the Secretary may by 
          general regulation or by order prescribe, or their advertising 
          fails to conform to the conditions and indications for use 
          published pursuant to section 512(i) or fails to contain the 
          general cautionary statement prescribed by the Secretary.
            `(c) Neither a drug subject to this section, nor animal feed
          bearing or containing such a drug, shall be deemed to be a
          prescription article under any Federal or State law.'.
            (c) CONFORMING AMENDMENT- Section 512 (21 U.S.C. 360b) is amended
          in subsection (i) by inserting after `(including special labeling
          requirements' the following: `and any requirement that an animal
          feed bearing or containing the new animal drug be limited to use
          under the professional supervision of a licensed veterinarian'.
            (d) SECTION 301(e)- Section 301(e) (21 U.S.C. 331(e)) is amended
          by inserting after `by section 412' the following: `, 504,'; and by
          inserting after `under section 412,' the following: `504,'.

            (a) SECTION 512(a)- Paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 512(a) (21
          U.S.C. 360b(a)) are amended to read as follows:
            `(a)(1) A new animal drug shall, with respect to any particular
          use or intended use of such drug, be deemed unsafe for the purposes
          of section 501(a)(5) and section 402(a)(2)(D) unless --
                `(A) there is in effect an approval of an application filed
              pursuant to subsection (b) with respect to such use or intended
              use of such drug, and
                `(B) such drug, its labeling, and such use conform to such
              approved application.
          A new animal drug shall also be deemed unsafe for such purposes in
          the event of removal from the establishment of a manufacturer,
          packer, or distributor of such drug for use in the manufacture of
          animal feed in any State unless at the time of such removal such
          manufacturer, packer, or distributor has an unrevoked written
          statement from the consignee of such drug, or notice from the
          Secretary, to the effect that, with respect to the use of such drug
          in animal feed, such consignee (i) holds a license issued under
          subsection (m) and has in its possession current approved labeling
          for such drug in animal feed; or (ii) will, if the consignee is not
          a user of the drug, ship such drug only to a holder of a license
          issued under subsection (m).
            `(2) An animal feed bearing or containing a new animal drug 
          shall, with respect to any particular use or intended use of such
          animal feed be deemed unsafe for the purposes of section 501(a)(6)
          unless--
                `(A) there is in effect an approval of an application filed
              pursuant to subsection (b) with respect to such drug, as used 
              in such animal feed,
                `(B) such animal feed is manufactured at a site for which
              there is in effect a license issued pursuant to subsection
              (m)(1) to manufacture such animal feed, and
                `(C) such animal feed and its labeling, distribution, 
              holding, and use conform to the conditions and indications of
              use published pursuant to subsection (i) .'.
            (b) SECTION 512(m)- Section 512(m) (21 U.S.C. 360b(m)) is amended
          to read as follows:
            `(m)(1) Any person may file with the Secretary an application for
          a license to manufacture animal feeds bearing or containing new
          animal drugs. Such person shall submit to the Secretary as part of
          the application (A) a full statement of the business name and
          address of the specific facility at which the manufacturing is to
          take place and the facility's registration number, (B) the name and
          signature of the responsible individual or individuals for that
          facility, (C) a certification that the animal feeds bearing or
          containing new animal drugs are manufactured and labeled in
          accordance with the applicable regulations published pursuant to
          subsection (i), and (D) a certification that the methods used in,
          and the facilities and controls used for, manufacturing, 
          processing, packaging, and holding such animal feeds are in
          conformity with current good manufacturing practice as described in
          section 501(a)(2)(B).
            `(2) Within 90 days after the filing of an application pursuant 
          to paragraph (1), or such additional period as may be agreed upon 
          by the Secretary and the applicant, the Secretary shall (A) issue 
          an order approving the application if the Secretary then finds that
          none of the grounds for denying approval specified in paragraph (3)
          applies, or (B) give the applicant notice of an opportunity for a
          hearing before the Secretary under paragraph (3) on the question
          whether such application is approvable. The procedure governing 
          such a hearing shall be the procedure set forth in the last two
          sentences of subsection (c)(1).
            `(3) If the Secretary, after due notice to the applicant in
          accordance with paragraph (2) and giving the applicant an
          opportunity for a hearing in accordance with such paragraph, finds,
          on the basis of information submitted to the Secretary as part of
          the application, on the basis of a preapproval inspection, or on 
          the basis of any other information before the Secretary--
                `(A) that the application is incomplete, false, or misleading
              in any particular;
                `(B) that the methods used in, and the facilities and 
              controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and packing of
              such animal feed are inadequate to preserve the identity,
              strength, quality, and purity of the new animal drug therein; or
                `(C) that the facility manufactures animal feeds bearing or
              containing new animal drugs in a manner that does not accord
              with the specifications for manufacture or labels animal feeds
              bearing or containing new animal drugs in a manner that does 
              not accord with the conditions or indications of use that are
              published pursuant to subsection (i),
          the Secretary shall issue an order refusing to approve the
          application. If, after such notice and opportunity for hearing, the
          Secretary finds that subparagraphs (A) through (C) do not apply, 
          the Secretary shall issue an order approving the application. An
          order under this subsection approving an application for a license
          to manufacture animal feeds bearing or containing new animal drugs
          shall permit a facility to manufacture only those animal feeds
          bearing or containing new animal drugs for which there are in 
          effect regulations pursuant to subsection (i) relating to the use 
          of such drugs in or on such animal feed.
            `(4)(A) The Secretary shall, after due notice and opportunity for
          hearing to the applicant, revoke a license to manufacture animal
          feeds bearing or containing new animal drugs under this subsection
          if the Secretary finds--
                `(i) that the application for such license contains any 
              untrue statement of a material fact; or
                `(ii) that the applicant has made changes that would cause 
              the application to contain any untrue statements of material
              fact or that would affect the safety or effectiveness of the
              animal feeds manufactured at the facility unless the applicant
              has supplemented the application by filing with the Secretary
              adequate information respecting all such changes and unless
              there is in effect an approval of the supplemental application.
          If the Secretary (or in the Secretary's absence the officer acting
          as the Secretary) finds that there is an imminent hazard to the
          health of humans or of the animals for which such animal feed is
          intended, the Secretary may suspend the license immediately, and
          give the applicant prompt notice of the action and afford the
          applicant the opportunity for an expedited hearing under this
          subsection; but the authority conferred by this sentence shall not
          be delegated.
            `(B) The Secretary may also, after due notice and opportunity for
          hearing to the applicant, revoke a license to manufacture animal
          feed under this subsection if the Secretary finds--
                `(i) that the applicant has failed to establish a system for
              maintaining required records, or has repeatedly or deliberately
              failed to maintain such records or to make required reports in
              accordance with a regulation or order under paragraph (5)(A) of
              this subsection or section 504(a)(3)(A), or the applicant has
              refused to permit access to, or copying or verification of, 
              such records as required by subparagraph (B) of such paragraph
              or section 504(a)(3)(B);
                `(ii) that on the basis of new information before the
              Secretary, evaluated together with the evidence before the
              Secretary when such license was issued, the methods used in, or
              the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture,
              processing, packing, and holding of such animal feed are
              inadequate to assure and preserve the identity, strength,
              quality, and purity of the new animal drug therein, and were 
              not made adequate within a reasonable time after receipt of
              written notice from the Secretary, specifying the matter
              complained of;
                `(iii) that on the basis of new information before the
              Secretary, evaluated together with the evidence before the
              Secretary when such license was issued, the labeling of any
              animal feeds, based on a fair evaluation of all material facts,
              is false or misleading in any particular and was not corrected
              within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from
              the Secretary specifying the matter complained of; or
                `(iv) that on the basis of new information before the
              Secretary, evaluated together with the evidence before the
              Secretary when such license was issued, the facility has
              manufactured, processed, packed, or held animal feed bearing or
              containing a new animal drug adulterated under section 
              501(a)(6) and the facility did not discontinue the manufacture,
              processing, packing, or holding of such animal feed within a
              reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the
              Secretary specifying the matter complained of.
            `(C) The Secretary may also revoke a license to manufacture 
          animal feeds under this subsection if an applicant gives notice to
          the Secretary of intention to discontinue the manufacture of all
          animal feed covered under this subsection and waives an opportunity
          for a hearing on the matter.
            `(D) Any order under this paragraph shall state the findings upon
          which it is based.
            `(5) When a license to manufacture animal feeds bearing or
          containing new animal drugs has been issued--
                `(A) the applicant shall establish and maintain such records,
              and make such reports to the Secretary, or (at the option of 
              the Secretary) to the appropriate person or persons holding an
              approved application filed under subsection (b), as the
              Secretary may by general regulation, or by order with respect 
              to such application, prescribe on the basis of a finding that
              such records and reports are necessary in order to enable the
              Secretary to determine, or facilitate a determination, whether
              there is or may be ground for invoking subsection (e) or
              paragraph (4); and
                `(B) every person required under this subsection to maintain
              records, and every person in charge or custody thereof, shall,
              upon request of an officer or employee designated by the
              Secretary, permit such officer or employee at all reasonable
              times to have access to and copy and verify such records.
            `(6) To the extent consistent with the public health, the
          Secretary may promulgate regulations for exempting from the
          operation of this subsection facilities that manufacture, process,
          pack, or hold animal feeds bearing or containing new animal drugs.'.
            (c) TRANSITIONAL PROVISION- A person engaged in the manufacture 
          of animal feeds bearing or containing new animal drugs who holds at
          least one approved medicated feed application for an animal feed
          bearing or containing new animal drugs, the manufacture of which 
          was not otherwise exempt from the requirement for an approved
          medicated feed application on the date of the enactment of this 
          Act, shall be deemed to hold a license for the manufacturing site
          identified in the approved medicated feed application. The
          revocation of license provisions of section 512(m)(4) of the 
          Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by this Act, shall
          apply to such licenses. Such license shall expire within 18 months
          from the date of enactment of this Act unless the person submits to
          the Secretary a completed license application for the manufacturing
          site accompanied by a copy of an approved medicated feed 
          application for such site, which license application shall be 
          deemed to be approved upon receipt by the Secretary.
          Speaker of the House of Representatives.
          Vice President of the United States and  
          President of the Senate.

 INTRODUCTION
</a></b>
<P>
Therapeutic doses of antibiotics can cause adverse effects on the intestinal
microfloral ecology.  These adverse effects are of concern because the
intestinal microflora plays an important role in maintaining an individual's
health.  Also, perturbation of the intestinal microflora may compromise the
effectiveness of other drug therapies and thereby adversely affect health.
Finally, the use of antibiotics can lead to the selection of resistance.
Because the genetic elements coding for resistance are transmissible among
bacterial species, increasing the level of resistance in the general population
is undesirable.<P>
The Center believes that, under Section 512 of the Act, "safe" means that the
level of antimicrobial residues present in food will have no meaningful effect
on the intestinal microflora of consumers of the food.  Therefore, the Center
will consider antimicrobial activity as a valid endpoint for establishing the
tolerance for antimicrobial drugs.  <P>
While the adverse effects of high doses of antimicrobials are well defined, in
most cases the dose at which adverse effects on the intestinal microflora start
to occur have not been determined.  However, the data show that the adverse
effects of antimicrobials do display a dose-response relationship and,
therefore, "very low" levels of antimicrobials do not perturb the intestinal
microflora or select for resistant organisms and thus are "safe" within the
meaning of the Act.  In this guidance document, the Center is explaining the
level of antimicrobial activity that is "very low" and is describing the
conditions for establishing the safety of residues and obtaining tolerances for
antimicrobial new animal drugs.  This document also identifies those drugs that
could require additional human food safety microbiological testing.  <P>
The Center identified the following areas for which antimicrobial residues
represent a potential public health concern: 1) changes in the metabolic
activity of the intestinal microflora; 2) changes in antimicrobial resistance
patterns of the intestinal microflora; 3) changes in the colonization
resistance properties (barrier effect) of the microflora; and 4) changes in the
number of microorganisms and composition of the intestinal microflora.  The
Center intends to validate model systems to evaluate the effect of low levels
of antimicrobials on the human intestinal microflora and invites comments on
how to relate the effect of low doses of antibiotics produced in model systems
to an adverse biological effect in humans.  In addition, information on the
appropriate endpoints for monitoring the effects of the different classes of
antibiotics is requested.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC2">II. ANTIMICROBIAL NEW ANIMAL DRUGS THAT ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE SUBJECT TO
ADDITIONAL HUMAN FOOD SAFETY MICROBIOLOGICAL TESTING
</a></b>
<P>
There are three categories of antimicrobial products that, in most cases, will
not require special human food safety microbiological testing.  These
categories are described below.  Sponsors are responsible for adequately
demonstrating the safety of their products; one approach is to show that their
product falls into one of these categories.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC3">A.
 Antimicrobial Drugs with "Very Low" Residue Levels
</a></b>
<P>
After considering data from the standard battery of toxicology tests performed
on a large number of compounds including animal drugs and food additives, the
Center believes that the maximum acceptable daily intake (ADI) of
noncarcinogens should be 1.5 mg/person/day.  For antimicrobial products, this
ADI equals a maximum antibiotic dose of 1.5 mg/person/day from consuming
residues in food [1] (  When appropriate, the Center may
apply consumption factors to this value as described in "General Principles for
Evaluating the Safety of Compounds Used in Food-Producing Animals", FDA, 1986.)
  The Center concludes
that this level of antimicrobial residue in food qualifies as "very low" in
terms of microbiological endpoints because this level should produce no effects
on the intestinal microflora.  <P>
The basis for deciding that 1.5 mg/person/day represents a "very low" value in
terms of microbiological activity is that the effects of antibiotics on the
colonic bacteria are minimized by the large number and slow growth rate of
these cells.  Moreover, all studies on antibiotics performed to date support
1.5 mg/person/day as being below the effect level for humans.  It should also
be noted that the infrequency of exposure to residues further decreases the
potential for antibiotic drug residues having an adverse effects on the
intestinal microflora.  Specifically, although the ADI is calculated as the
amount of drug residue that can be safely consumed daily throughout one's
lifetime, actually the exposure to antibiotic residues is infrequent (less than
1% of the food derived from animals contains residues above tolerance) and
always below the ADI for lifetime exposure. <P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC4">B.
 Antimicrobial Residues with Limited Antimicrobial Activity
</a></b>
<P>
All new animal antimicrobial drugs consumed as residues will have been exposed
to the metabolic activities of the target animal.  The metabolic action of the
microflora and drug metabolizing enzymes of the target species may inactivate
the antibiotic.  Therefore, if the total drug residues exceed 1.5
mg/person/day, the sponsor could demonstrate that microbiologically active
residues do not exceed 1.5 mg/person/day.  For example, the sponsor could
provide <i>in vitro</i> MIC data comparing the microbiological activity of drug
metabolites to the parent compound to demonstrate that total microbiologically
active residues are below 1.5 mg/person/day.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC5">C.
 Antimicrobial Animal Drugs with No Adverse Effects on
</a> Intestinal Microflora at Doses Approved for the Target Species </b>
<P>
The potential of an antimicrobial agent to alter the intestinal microflora is
related to its dose, pharmacological properties, and the spectra of
antimicrobial activity.  For example, orally administered antimicrobial
products that are rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal
tract will have minimal effect on the intestinal microflora.  In some cases,
the Center requires an assessment of microbiological activity in the target
species as part of the target animal safety evaluation.  When appropriate, the
Center will consider this data to eliminate the human food safety concerns for
antimicrobial residues in food. 
<b>
<P>
<a name="RTFToC8">III.
ANTIMICROBIAL NEW ANIMAL DRUGS FOR WHICH ADDITIONAL
HUMAN FOOD SAFETY MICROBIOLOGICAL TESTING
COULD BE REQUESTED
</a></b>
<P>
Some new animal antimicrobial drugs could require additional microbiological
testing. Antimicrobial products that are most likely to be subject to
additional antimicrobial testing are those for which the sponsor is seeking a
safe concentration of microbiologically active residues greater than 1.5
mg/person/day.  <P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC11">A.
 Criteria for Acceptable Microbiological Tests
</a></b>
<P>
The intestinal microflora is a complex ecological system and the effects of
antibiotics on this system are also diverse and complex.  There is no validated
model system for the testing of all antimicrobial agents.  Therefore, CVM
intends to validate model systems to evaluate the effect of low levels of
antimicrobials on the human intestinal microflora.  The model system used to
establish the microbiological no effect level should evaluate changes in
metabolism of intestinal microflora, the selection of antimicrobial resistant
organisms, and/or changes in colonization resistance to potentially pathogenic
microorganisms, which are the endpoints of public health concern.  It will be
the sponsors' responsibility to identify the microbiological activity of their
product and to monitor the appropriate microbiological endpoint(s) to establish
the antimicrobial NOEL.<P>
At this time, the Center does not accept <i>in vitro</i> MIC data for
establishing the microbiological no-effect level because the Center does not
believe that these data predict the level of drug residues which elicit the
potential public health concerns.  <P>
Before conducting the study, the antibiotic should be characterized.  This
characterization should include the identification of the chemical structure,
the antibiotic drug class, and the spectrum of antimicrobial activity for the
compound.  The spectrum of antimicrobial activity should be defined in terms of
potential adverse effects of the antibiotic on the intestinal microflora.  In
most cases, data from <i>in vitro </i>systems or human clinical studies will be
appropriate for these preliminary determinations.<P>
As with all studies, the sponsor is encouraged to consult with the Center to
discuss the protocol before initiating the study.  <P>

<H3>The Status of Syringes and  Needles for Animal Use</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG  7125a.03)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
Since there are on the market a number of injectable drugs for animal use
which are approved for over-the-counter sale, it follows that the needles and
syringes necessary to deliver such drug to the animal must likewise be
available without prescription.  *CVM*, therefore, has never sought to require
that needles and syringes be restricted to prescription legend use.  *CVM* is
aware, however, that in certain areas devices of this nature may be restricted
to prescription sale by local or state laws. <P>
POLICY: <P>
*CVM* will not concur in regulatory action against needles and syringes
intended for animal use merely because they are distributed without
prescription legend labeling.  <P>
*Material between asterisks is new or revised* <P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>GUIDELINE 24</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY><H3>GUIDELINE 24 - GUIDELINE FOR DRUG COMBINATIONS FOR USE IN ANIMALS</H3>
<H5>October 1983</H5>
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services<BR>
Public Health Service<BR>
Food and Drug Administration<BR>
Center for Veterinary Medicine
<P>
Regulation 514.1 (b)(8)(v) of 21 CFR states the requirements for efficacy of
drug combinations as:<P>

"Each ingredient designated as active in any new animal drug combination must
make a contribution to the effect in the manner claimed or suggested in the
labeling, and, if in the absence of express labeling claims of advantages for
the combination such a product purports to be better than either component
alone, it must be established that the new animal drug has that purported
effectiveness."<P>
This guideline is the Bureau of Veterinary Medicine's interpretation of this
regulation. Specifically, prior to approval of a drug combination, the sponsor
is to submit information and data to demonstrate that the combination of drugs
provides a benefit that cannot be obtained by the use of each of the drugs
individually (i.e., each drug has made a contribution).<P>

When 3 or more drugs are used in the same combination, the resulting
benefit from the use of the full combination must be a benefit that cannot be
obtained from combinations involving a lesser number of drug components than
the number contained in the full combination (e.g., a 3-way combination must be
better than all possible 2-way combinations of the same 3 drugs).
<P>
This demonstration of benefit is satisfied when the sponsor has proven
that each active drug ingredient has made a meaningful contribution to the
overall effect (safety and/or efficacy) of the combination.
<P>
Demonstration of effectiveness of drug combinations is subject to the following
qualifications and restrictions:<P>
<B>1. Non-interference</B><P>
The effects of actions of each drug in the combination should be as good
as or superior to its actions when used alone. Exceptions to this
non-interference requirement will be considered only when the benefits of the
combination outweigh any reduction in potency of effectiveness incurred by an
individual drug component as a result of being included in the combination. If
appropriate, any decrease in efficacy should be clearly indicated on the
label.<P>
<B>2. Rationale</B>
<P>
When drug claims or drug actions are not the same, the sponsor is to provide
information and data to demonstrate the existence of a readily identifiable set
of animals that require or will benefit from such concurrent drug usage.
<P>
<B>3. Titration</B>
<P>
The level of each drug used in the combination has to be sufficient to produce
the claimed effect and each drug is to be administered according to its proper
regimen. The level of drug should not exceed its level for optimum
effectiveness in the particular combination. Optimum effectiveness is defined
as that single level of drug (administered at its proper regimen), beyond which
any further incremental increase in drug level produces no meaningful
improvement in desired efficacy, or if further drug doses provide increased
efficacy the benefit is outweighed by increased risks in terms of human and/or
animal safety.
<P>
The amount and kind of titration data required on each individual drug used in
the combination, collected in studies with the combination, will depend on:
<P>
(a) The quality of the titration data available on the individual components in
the combination;
<P>
(b) Whether a fixed point or range approval is requested on the individual
components in the combination; and
<P>
(c) The amount of data and information available on the type and extent of
possible interactions between the actions of the individual components in the
combination.
<P>
If however, the combination contains one or more new animal drugs with
production claims (e.g., growth promotion, feed efficiency, increased milk or
egg production), it is not necessary to provide titration data for the
production drug(s) from studies done with the combination, provided the drugs
have been previously approved for use at a particular dosage level or within a
given range.

<P>
<B>4. Ranges</B>
<P>
Ranges in dose levels for therapeutic or prophylactic drugs contained in
combinations will be allowed only when adequate directions can be written so
that the user knows when different levels of the drug should be used. The
conditions requiring the use of the various drug levels are to be clearly
identifiable so that changing the drug level will not change the desired
efficacy.
<P>
Ranges for production drugs that are included in combinations will be allowed
when it has been demonstrated that, over the entire range of drug use, an
increased dose results in an increased response. It is not necessary to
establish, through studies done with the combinations, the effective ranges for
the production drugs if two conditions are met. First, the ranges for these
drugs must have been previously approved. Second, the sponsors must demonstrate
that in combination each production drug contributes to the claimed effect at a
level selected by the sponsor that is within the approved range.
Note, however, that in any event the sponsors will be required to
conduct studies with the combination using the highest levels in the ranges, to
assess effects on animal safety. If these requirements are satisfied, the full
ranges that had been established for the individual production drugs will be
allowed for the combination use.
<P>
<B>5. General Efficacy</B>
<P>
In all cases the combination must be more effective than no treatment (or placebo) 
for all the claims associated with the combination.
<P>
<B>6. DESI Reviewed Drug Combinations</B>
<P>
Drug combinations found to be effective by the Drug Efficacy Study
Implementation program (DESI) are not subject to this guideline.
<P>
<B>7. Combination Claims and Treatment Comparisons</B>
<P>
Most of the various situations that are encountered when evaluating drug
combinations are listed below along with the necessary comparisons to
demonstrate efficacy:
<P>

a) If claims are different for each drug ingredient. i.e., 
<P>
 drug A has claim Y<BR>
 drug B has claim X.
<P>
  then it needs to be demonstrated that the combination is superior to drug B 
  alone for claim Y and superior to drug A alone for claim X. i.e.,
<P>
 (A+B)&gt; B for claim Y<BR>
 (A+B)&gt; A for claim X.
<P>
   Example:
   If drug A for strep organisms and drug B for staph organisms, then the
   combination of (A+B) is to be better than B alone for strep and better than A
   alone for staph.
 <P>
b) (i) If the claim is the same for each drug ingredient. i.e.,
 <P>
 drug A has claim X<BR>
 drug B has claim X
<P>
   then it needs to be demonstrated that the combination is superior to each of
   the component drugs alone for that claim, i.e.,
<P>
 (A+B)&gt; for claim X<BR>
 (A+B)&gt; for claim X.
<P>
   Example:  
   If drug A is for increased rate of weight gain and drug B is for increased
   rate of weight gain, then the combination of (A+B) is to be better than A alone
   and B alone for increased rate of weight gain.
 <P>
   (ii) If more than one claim is the same for each drug component. i.e.,
<P>
 drug A has claim X and Y<BR>
 drug B has claim X and Y
<P>      
      then it needs to be demonstrated that the combination is superior to each
      component drug for at least one of the claims. i.e., 
<P>
 A+B &gt; A for at least one claim<BR>
 A+B &gt; B for at least one claim.
<P>

   Example:
   If drug A is for staph and strep organisms and drug B is for staph and strep
   organisms, then the combination of (A+B) is to be better than A alone for
   either strep or staph and better than B alone for either strep or staph.
<P>   
c) (i) If one of the claims overlaps while a second claim does not, i.e.,
<P>
 drug A has claim X <BR>
 drug B has claim X and Y.
<P>       
   then it needs to be demonstrated that the combination is superior to drug B for
   claim X and superior to drug A for the non-overlapping claim Y, i.e.,
<P>

 (A+B)&gt; B for claim X<BR>
 (A+B)&gt; A for claim Y
<P>        
    Example: If drug A is for increased rate of weight gain and drug B is for increased
rate of weight gain and improved efficiency, then the combination of (A+B) is
to be better than B alone for increased rate of weight gain and better than A
for improved feed efficiency.
<P>   
   (ii) If there is an overlapping claim and each drug component has its own
unique claim, i.e.,
<P>
 drug A has claim X and Y  <BR>
 drug B has claim Y and Z. 
<P>      
 then it needs to be demonstrated that the combination is superior to drug A for
claim Z and superior to drug B for claim X, i.e..

<P>
 (A+B)&gt; A for claim Z<BR>
 (A+B)&gt; B for claim X.
 <P>     
   Example:
   If drug A is for strep and staph organisms and drug A is for strep and
   coliform organisms, then the combination of (A+B) is better than A for coliform
   and better than B for staph.

<P>
d) If the combination is intended to decrease the toxicity of individual
   active ingredients, i.e.,<P>

 drug A is toxic at X mg/ka<BR>
 drug B reduces the toxicity of drug A
<P>  
   then it needs to be demonstrated that the combination reduces the toxicity of
   drug A and is superior to drug B for the claims of drug A.
<P>  
 (A+B)&lt; A In toxicity<BR>
 (A+B)&lt; B for the claims of A
<P>  
   Example:
   If drug A is for anesthesia and drug B reduces the toxic effects of drug A,
   then the combination (A+B) is to result in lesser toxic effects than drug A
   alone and is to be better than drug B for anesthesia.
<P>
e)  If the claim for the combination is different from the claims for each of
   the individual drugs, i.e.,
<P>
 drug A has claim Y<BR>
 drug B has claim X<BR>
       the combination (A+B) has claim Z.
<P>
   then it needs to be demonstrated that the combination is superior to drug A and
   drug B for claim Z, i.e.,
<P>
 (A+B)&gt; A for claim Z<BR>
 (A+B)&gt; B for claim Z.
 <P>     
   Example:
   If drug A is for strep and drug B is for staph, and the combination is for <I>E. coli</I>,
   then the combination of (A+B) is to be better than A or B alone for <I>E. coli.</I>
 <P>
This guideline is intended to cover the majority of situations encountered in
dealing with drug combinations. On rare occasions a combination may be proposed
which is not specifically covered by this guideline. However, a careful
application of the underlying concepts presented above should be sufficient to
handle these situations, provided one keeps in mind the prime consideration for
justification of any combination - the full combination is to provide a benefit
that cannot be obtained from lesser combinations involving only a fraction of
the drug components contained in the full combination.

Docket No. 92D-0287<P>

NOTE: The information in this guidance document describes those procedures that
the agency finds acceptable during the review of applications for generic
animal drug products containing fermentation-derived drug substances. A person
may follow this guidance or may choose to follow alternative procedures. If a
person chooses to use alternative procedures, that person may wish to discuss
the matter further with the agency to prevent an expenditure of money and
effort on activities that may later be determined to be unacceptable to the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This guidance does not bind the
agency, and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, immunities, or
benefits for or on any person. When the guidance states a requirement imposed
by statute or regulation, however, the requirement is law and its force and
effect are not changed in any way by virtue of its inclusion in the
guidance.<P>
The agency recommends that persons routinely submit protocols of studies and
other investigations for review and comment prior to initiation.<P>
This guidance was written in response to a need perceived by the Center for
Veterinary Medicine in its work with the animal health industry.<P>
Written comments regarding this guidance are welcome and should be directed

<b>DEFINITIONS</b><P>
<b>Antibiotic New Drug Substance (NDS)</b>: An antibiotic active ingredient,
intended for incorporation into a finished dosage form, that meets the
statutory definition of a drug (e.g., an article intended for use in the
diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in
animals).<P>
The antibiotic NDS is a highly purified form of active ingredient which meets
or exceeds specifications listed in official compendia. It is obtained from the
fermentation suspension by extraction, isolation and purification procedures.
The antibiotic new drug substance may be converted to another antibiotic new
drug substance by subjecting it to further chemical reactions.<P>
<b>Biomass Drug Substance</b>: The dried, unpurified fermentation product which
contains the antibiotic new drug substance together with microbial cells,
residual nutrients, other fermentation components, and metabolic products. <P>
<b>Drug Product</b>: A finished dosage form (e.g., tablet, injectable, soluble
powder, etc.) or a Type A medicated article that contains an antibiotic new
drug substance and/or a biomass drug substance.  Type A medicated articles are
drug products that are intended solely for use in the manufacture of another
Type A medicated article or a Type B or Type C medicated feed.<P>
The terms "Drug Product" and "Finished Drug Product" are interchangeable.<P>
GUIDANCE ON GENERIC ANIMAL DRUG PRODUCTS<br>
CONTAINING FERMENTATION-DERIVED DRUG SUBSTANCES <P>
ABBREVIATED NEW ANIMAL DRUG APPLICATIONS AND MASTER FILES<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC1">I.
OBJECTIVE
</a></b>
<p>
Antibiotic drug substances derived from fermentation processes are known to
have antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral and antineoplastic properties. The
antibiotic new drug substance (NDS) or biomass drug substance can be utilized
as the active ingredient in a new animal drug product. Marketing such a drug
product requires the submission and subsequent approval of a new animal drug
application (NADA) or an abbreviated new animal drug application (ANADA), as
provided for in section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.<P>
This document presents information that should be considered for the submission
of fermentation/manufacturing information to the agency in ANADAs and master
files.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC2">II.  TYPES OF DRUG SUBSTANCES PRODUCED BY FERMENTATION
</a></b>
<p>
At the end of the fermentation process, the fermenter contains a large-volume
suspension. The suspension contains the antibiotic NDS, microbial cells,
residual nutrients, other fermentation components, and metabolic products. The
fermentation suspension can yield a compendial-grade antibiotic NDS (for use in
finished dosage forms), or a fermentation product containing the biomass and
antibiotic NDS (for use in Type A medicated articles and medicated feeds).<P>
A fermentation product containing the antibiotic NDS can be obtained directly
from the fermentation suspension.  Operations may include concentration
procedures which remove the liquid phase and/or filtration, blending with other
materials, and drying. The antibiotic NDS may be converted to another
antibiotic NDS by subjecting it to further chemical reactions. <P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC3">III.
MANUFACTURING INFORMATION
</a></b>
<p>
For approval of a generic animal drug product which contains a
fermentation-derived drug substance, complete manufacturing and control
information is required similar to that specified in 21 CFR Part 514.1 for the
antibiotic new drug substance or biomass drug substance and the finished drug
product.<p>

</ol>
Due to the dynamic nature of the fermentation process, the agency recognizes
that the microorganism strain, the composition of the growth media, and the
fermentation operating parameters are subject to frequent improvements in order
to maximize the yield of antibiotic NDS. It is therefore not practical to
specify exact amounts of components or specific fermentation operating
parameters in the ANADA or master file. Rather, the agency recommends that
quantities of each component and fermentation operating parameters, such as
temperature, pH, and aeration rate, be stated using "ranges". <P>
<b>Related Post-Approval Requirements</b><P>
Submission of a supplemental application is required for changes to the generic
product which fall outside the approved "ranges". <P>
Batch yield information for the most recent fermentation should be included in
each DER (for applications) or in each annual report (for master files). The
submission of this information is necessary since the agency must be informed
of the current state of each firm's evolving fermentation process. <P>

FINISHED DRUG PRODUCT INFORMATION:
</a></b>
<P>
The standards of purity, strength, and quality for the antibiotic new drug
substances which are incorporated into veterinary pharmaceutical dosage forms
(e.g., tablets, capsules, injectables, soluble powders, etc.) are identical to
the standards of purity, strength, and quality for the antibiotic new drug
substances which are incorporated into human pharmaceutical dosage forms.  The
standards for most antibiotic new drug substances are published in the USP and
in 21 CFR Parts 440-455 and 520-555.  Antibiotic NDS which meets or exceeds the
standards is referred to as "USP-grade" or "compendial-grade".<P>
The Center for Veterinary Medicine also permits the use of antibiotic new drug
substances of lower standards of purity, strength, and quality in the
production of medicated feeds, such materials are referred to as feed-grade.
These products may include biomass new drug substances.  However, the
requirements of purity, strength, and quality for the active component in
finished products are sufficient to ensure that such products will produce its
therapeutic, preventative or performance enhancement effects.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC7">A
FINISHED DOSAGE FORMS:
</a></b>
<P>
Finished dosage forms should be manufactured using USP-grade antibiotic NDS, or
equivalent as appropriate. <P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC8">B.
TYPE A MEDICATED ARTICLES AND MEDICATED FEEDS:
</a></b>
<P>
Type A Medicated Articles and medicated feeds can be manufactured using
USP-grade antibiotic NDS, feed-grade antibiotic NDS, or a biomass new drug
substance.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC9">V.
ANADA SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS
</a></b>
<P>
The sponsor of an new animal drug application (NADA) is required to submit to
FDA the chemistry and manufacturing and control information necessary to
support their submission. This information is generally described in 21 CFR
Part 514.1 for original new animal drug applications and in 21 CFR Part 514.8
for supplements to approved new animal drug applications. The chemistry and
manufacturing and control information requirements are identical for original
abbreviated new animal drug applications (ANADAs) and supplements to approved
abbreviated new animal drug applications.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC10">A.
COMPARISON DATA - ANADA (generic) vs. NADA (pioneer)
</a></b>
<P>
In order to obtain ANADA approval, chemical/structural/physical information
should be submitted which compares the proposed antibiotic new drug substance
or biomass new drug substance with the pioneer's new drug substance or a known
reference standard.  The methods, as proposed in the application, should be
properly validated. Information on the validation should be provided in the
document or be referenced to other documents.  For those cases where a known
reference standard does not exist  ([1] Where variable compositions of the antibiotic
moiety and the stabilizing moiety allow for a large number of possible
structures; for example, if tylosin tartrate were a biomass product where the
tartaric groups may be D-, D, L-, L, or meso.), in
addition to chemical/structural information as above, appropriate validated
methods should be proposed that compare the bioactivity of the generic and
pioneer active substances.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC11">B.
	DRUG SOURCE
</a></b>
<P>
If the antibiotic NDS is obtained from a manufacturer who holds an approved
Antibiotic Drug Application (ADA), Abbreviated Antibiotic Drug Application
(AADA),  or an approved New Animal Drug Application (NADA), the Center for
Veterinary Medicine may accept, without re-review, the chemistry and
manufacturing and controls information in the application. The ANADA should
contain a letter of authorization from the ADA, AADA, or NADA holder permitting
reference to the approved application on behalf of the ANADA applicant.<P>
The referenced application will be reviewed to determine whether the
information is current and whether the files have been properly updated. The
decision to accept the referenced submission will be made by the CVM
manufacturing and controls reviewer based on the data available.<P>
Chemistry and manufacturing and controls information describing the production
of an antibiotic NDS may also be referenced from a master file. The ANADA
should contain a letter of authorization from the master file holder permitting
reference to the master file on behalf of the ANADA applicant.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC12">C. FERMENTATION PROCESS
</a></b>
<P>
It may not be possible for a fermentation facility to exactly duplicate the
fermentation process which the pioneer currently uses to produce the antibiotic
NDS or the biomass new drug substance. This is due to the dynamic nature of the
fermentation process which may change frequently, and to the proprietary nature
of such information. <P>
Some non-proprietary information pertaining to the pioneer's new drug substance
is available and can be obtained from the Code of Federal Regulations, the
Federal Register, scientific books such as The Merck Index, and the published
scientific literature. For example:<P>
Monensin is listed in The Merck Index, 11th Edition, pages 
982-983. The monograph indicates that the producing microorganism is
<i>Streptomyces cinnamonensis</i>. It also
provides information regarding fermentation studies; it refers to an scientific
article entitled, "Monensin, a New Biologically Active Compound" by Stark et
al, which was published in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy in
1967.<P>
All generic finished drug products should utilize antibiotic NDS or biomass
drug substance that was produced by the same microorganism (genus and species)
that was used by the pioneer during his fermentation process. The agency
recognizes that the producing microorganism strains will differ due to each
firm's proprietary strain improvement program.  The agency also recognizes that
the chemical composition of the biomass drug substance changes significantly
due to the dynamic nature of the fermentation process. However, since the
generic biomass drug substance will be produced by the same microorganism that
is used by the pioneer, it will not be necessary to characterize this material
for submission in the ANADA. The safety of the biomass drug substance has been
demonstrated by the pioneer and years of use.<P>
An antibiotic NDS or biomass new drug substance, which was produced from
fermentation batches found to be contaminated (infected) with adventitious
microorganisms, may not be utilized in the production of generic finished drug
products until the potential that the invading microorganisms may have produced
a different antibiotic, a toxin, or other metabolic product which could
adversely affect the safety and effectiveness of the finished drug product has
been considered via a suitable deviation investigation. The use of such
material by holders of approved applications will be considered on a
case-by-case basis by the submission of a supplemental application. An
applicant must demonstrate that reprocessing/reworking procedures result in
antibiotic NDS or biomass new drug substance that is free of any contamination
that could adversely affect the safety and effectiveness of the finished
product.   <P>
Contaminated fermentation containing known common organisms that have been
shown by the application holder to not adversely impact drug product quality,
safety or isolation techniques can be forward processed without additional
special testing. <P>
Those fermentation batches confirmed to be contaminated with uncommon
microorganisms, that are  known pathogens, or produce a known antibiotic or
toxin may not be used in the production of finished drug products until it has
been demonstrated that the pathogen, antibiotic or toxin has no adverse impact
on product quality, purity or safety.<P>
An antibiotic NDS or biomass new drug substance produced from fermentation
batches that were contaminated with adventitious microorganisms that are known
to be pathogenic produce a known antibiotic or toxin may not be used in the
production of finished drug products until it has been demonstrated that the
pathogen, antibiotic or toxin is not present in the finished product.<P>

<b> <a name="RTFToC13">VI. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS </a></b>
<P>
The proposed generic drug product must meet the same regulatory requirements
which the pioneer's drug product currently meets. For example:<P>
An ANADA proposes a generic monensin Type A Medicated Article. The antibiotic
NDS and finished drug product must meet the following specifications prescribed
by 21 CFR Part 558.355(a) and 21 CFR Part 558.4(d) for Monensin:<P>
<b>21 CFR Part 558.355(a)</b>: Specification for Antibiotic NDS/Biomass New
Drug Substance<P>
Monensin, as the base or sodium salt, contains a minimum of 
90 percent monensin activity derived from Monensin A and a minimum of 95
percent derived from monensin A plus B. Using thin layer chromatography, the Rf
value must be comparable to a reference standard (the Rf value is the distance
the spots travel from the starting line divided by the distance the solvent
front travels from the starting line). The loss on drying is not more than 10
percent when dried in vacuum at 60deg.C for 2 hours. <P>
<b>21 CFR Part 558.4(d)</b>: Specification for Finished Drug Product<P>
Monensin is listed in the Category I table. The Assay Limit (percent of label
claim) for the Type A Medicated Article is 
90-110%. <P>
In addition to meeting all regulatory specifications listed in the Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR) for purity, strength, and quality, the antibiotic
NDS, biomass new drug substance, and finished drug product should comply with
any additional compendial requirements. The ANADA applicant should determine

if the proposed finished drug product is listed in the current USP/NF; if it
is, all additional specifications should be included in the ANADA
submission.<P>

<BODY><H3>CVM GUIDELINE 22 -LABELING OF ARECOLINE BASE DRUGS INTENDED FOR ANIMAL USE</H3>







<H5>BACKGROUND</H5>

Drugs containing arecoline intended for treating animals are to be limited to
use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian and should bear the label
statement specified in 21 CFR 201.105(b)(1), <B>"Caution: Federal law restricts
this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian,"</B> because of
toxicity and since adequate directions for use cannot be written by which the
layman can use such drugs safely for the purposes for which they are
intended.
<P>
It is a possible abortifacient and is contraindicated in pregnant animals. The
drug is unsafe in kittens and cats under one year of age.
<P>
Upon request, the administration will review the marketing status of any 
specific product and permit over-the-counter marketing only where it is shown
by adequate studies that such product is safe for use by the layman.
<P>
<B>POLICY</B>
<P>
Drugs containing arecoline intended for use in treating animals are limited to
use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. Arecoline-containing drugs
labeled for over-the-counter use are misbranded under 502(f)(1) of the Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act and are subject to regulatory action.

<h3>EXPORT OF NEW ANIMAL DRUGS FOR INVESTIGATIONAL USE</h3><p>



<b>(Revised 10/92)</b><p>



U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES<br>
PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE<br>
FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION<br>
CENTER FOR VETERINARY MEDICINE<p>
<b>CVM POLICY AND PROCEDURE GUIDELINE</b><p>

<b>EXPORT OF NEW ANIMAL DRUGS FOR INVESTIGATIONAL USE</b><p>
<pre>
<b>1.Purpose:</b>

This guide describes the requirements which must be met before new
animal drugs intended for clinical investigation in animals may be exported.
No clearance is required for <b>in-vitro</b> or laboratory animal research.
This does not, however, negate compliance with section 801(e) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and with 21 CFR 511.1(a).

<b>2.Export Requirements:</b>


New animal drugs intended for clinical investigation in animals may be exported
provided:

a.  A "Notice of Claimed Investigational Exemption for a New Animal Drug" is
    filed in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of 21 CFR 511.1 except that the
    commitment required by paragraph (b)(4)(v)(<b>a</b>) of that regulation is
    required only if edible products of animals treated with the investigational
    drug are intended for shipment to the United States.

b.  The notice is accompanied by a statement signed by the sponsor that the
    government of the country to which the drug is to be exported has been
    notified, or will be notified, of the intended investigational use of the drug
    in that country before any shipments of the drug to that country are made.
    Where a commitment is required by paragraph (b)(4)(v)(<b>a</b>) of 21 CFR
    511.1, the sponsor must also advise the government of the foreign country to
    which the investigational new animal drug is to be exported that neither the
    treated animals nor food from the treated animals may be shipped to the United
    States unless authorization is obtained in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of
    that regulation.
        
c.  In lieu of the labeling required in paragraph (b)(1) of that regulation,
    labeling shows that the drug is intended for export and:

 (1) Bears the following precaution.
 
     <b>"Caution</b>.  Contains a new animal drug for use only in
     investigational clinical trials.  Not for use in humans.  Edible products from
     animals used for investigation are not to be used for food in any manner
     contrary to the requirements of the country in which the clinical trials are to
     be conducted."

  (2) If the drug is intended for food-producing animals, the labeling 
      bears the following statement:

      "No official withdrawal time has been established for this product 
       under the proposed investigational use."

<title>Caution Urged in Use of Warbex</title>
</head>
<body>
<P>
<b>CVM UPDATE</b><br>
<b>FDA, Center for Veterinary Medicine</b><br>
<b>"Helping man and animals by ensuring the availability of safe and effective animal health products."</b> 
<P>
October 4, 1996<P>
<b>CAUTION URGED IN USING WARBEX</b><P>
Warbex&#174; is the tradename for the liquid form of the chemical
famphur, regulated by FDA as an animal drug, which is designed to be applied
topically to treat insect infestations.  The product is approved by the FDA for
use on beef cattle, dry cows, and replacement heifers to treat grubs and reduce
lice infestation.  <P>
There have been reports of death of wild birds due to the deliberate misuse of
Warbex&#174;, and even in some cases when the product is used
properly.  Warbex&#174; is being misused by soaking grain and other
items in the liquid famphur.  The contaminated grain or other products are then
used as bait or as a delivery vehicle to poison birds, rodents, or predators.
This practice introduces famphur into the wildlife food chain.  Endangered
species, as well as other predatory and scavenging birds, including eagles,
hawks, owls, and buzzards, etc., have died as a result of eating these poisoned
birds.  An undetermined number of bald eagles and red-tailed hawks in
Washington State have died after eating starlings that had been intentionally
poisoned.  Some of this illegal use may be occurring on dairy farms in other
States.  Birds have also died when Warbex&#174; has been applied to
the backs of cattle according to label directions.  Some bird species perch on
cattle backs and others pull cattle hair, and these birds may receive fatal
exposures to famphur. <P>
CVM views the misuse of this product as an unapproved use in violation of the
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and implementing regulations.  There are
discussions underway between the various Federal and State agencies involved to
decide how best to sanction or control individuals who use the product in this
illegal manner.  The State of Washington Department of Agriculture has taken
the unusual step of requiring registration of the animal drug as a pesticide
under State law.  A Pesticide Dealer License is now required for any outlet
which distributes Warbex&#174; in Washington.  <P>
CVM is working with Mallinckrodt Veterinary, Inc. and the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service to educate the public about potential hazards to wildlife
associated with Warbex&#174; Pour-On
13.2%.  Mallinckrodt is planning a public education campaign to try and
discourage misuse of Warbex&#174;.  Their educational materials will
also address the potential environmental problems from use of
Warbex&#174; according to the label and how to prevent them.
Mallinckrodt will advise product users to promptly dispose of any poisoned
birds in a manner that ensures that the carcasses are not available to other
predatory and scavenging birds.<br>

CVM UPDATE
<P> Center for Veterinary Medicine<br>
Issued by: Office of Management, Communications and Education Branch, HFV-12 Food
and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville, MD 20855<br>
 (301) 594-1755<br>
FAX (301) 594-1831 <p>
<H3>TWO YEAR REPORT ON BST</H3><P>
May 16,
1996<P>
FDA approved  Monsanto Company's recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST)
product, Posilac&#174;, in November 1993 after a comprehensive review
of the product's safety and efficacy, including human food safety.
Posilac&#174; is the only rbST product approved for increasing milk
production in dairy cattle.  The product has been commercially available since
February 4, 1994.  <P>
During the first year of commercial use of  Posilac&#174;,  a total of
806 reports of adverse effects were reported to Monsanto and submitted to FDA.
<P>
The following is a 24-month summary of the adverse experiences to
Posilac&#174; reported to FDA from February 4, 1994  through February
4, 1996.  During this period, FDA received 1438 adverse experience reports (See
table below.)  It is important to note that a report of an adverse effect in
relation to a drug does not itself establish that the effect was caused by the
drug.  FDA believes that 918 of the 1438 reports were <b>possibly</b>
associated with the use of Posilac&#174;, and that the other 520
reports were not  related to treatment with Posilac&#174;.  Also, the
reported clinical manifestations are known to occur in dairy cattle not
supplemented with Posilac&#174;.<P>
Of the 918 reports possibly related to the use of Posilac&#174;, 208
included mastitis, 185 included reproductive events, 165 involved increased
somatic cell counts, 157 involved digestive disorders, 154 included swelling of
the udder or abnormal milk, 150 included injection site reactions, and 113
included foot or leg problems.  In some cases, a single report contained
multiple conditions.<P>
The number and severity of the reported conditions will be the subject of a May
29,1996, Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee (VMAC) meeting.  The VMAC will
consider the need for label revisions to better characterize reported signs
that are possibly associated with the use of Posilac&#174;.<P>
FDA encourages dairy farmers and veterinarians to report all adverse reactions
associated with the use of rbST.  They may report such reactions to Monsanto,
to FDA through their veterinarian, or directly to FDA's Center for Veterinary
Medicine.  CVM accepts collect calls during working hours, and an answering
machine is available to record after-hours calls.  The telephone numbers are
(301) 594-1751 for collect calls during working hours, and (301) 594-1722 to
leave a message on evenings and weekends.<P>
<b>SUMMARY OF ADVERSE REACTION REPORTS ON POSILAC</b>&#174;<P>
 
The following table summarizes the important clinical manifestations (CM) from
the 918 adverse experience reports <b>possibly</b> related to the use of
Posilac&#174; from February 4, 1994 through February 4, 1996.  <P>
This summary is intended only as a general reference to the type of reactions
that veterinarians and dairy farmers have voluntarily reported to the
manufacturer or FDA.  Therefore, the summary is not by itself a basis for
determining drug association for a particular sign, safety or efficacy of the
drug, or determining the frequency or incidence rate of a clinical
manifestation.  Each of the reports may contain one or more CMs, and as a
result the number of CMs exceeds the number of reports.  The reported clinical
manifestations are known to occur in dairy cattle not supplemented with
Posilac&#174;.  <p>

<TITLE>CVM Guideline Number 20</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><P>
<H3>CVM Guideline &#35; 2O - ANTIBACTERIAL EFFECTIVENESS CRITERIA</H3>
<P>
<H5>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE</H5>
<H5>FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION</H5>
<H5>CENTER FOR VETERINARY MEDICINE</H5>

 
<P>
<B>ANTIBACTERIAL EFFECTIVENESS CRITERIA</B>
<P>
Criteria for establishing that the use of intermediate (prevention and
control) levels of an antibacterial drug in animal feeds elicit significant
beneficial effect in the explicit situations for which the drug is intended.
<P>
<B>SINGLE DRUGS:</B>
<P>
1. Drugs for which claims for control or prevention are made
should be qualified as to the situations in which they may offer beneficial
effects. Such qualifications should be explicitly indicated on the label.
<P>
2. For all claims, test animals should be compared with contemporary controls.
Efficacy data should be supplied from well-defined, well-designated, and
well-controlled experiments conducted by qualified investigators in areas
representative of the major production locales of the species of animal
involved. Individual experiments should be designed so that an independent
evaluation and decisions can be made from each. The experiments should be
designed so that differences in drug response due to age (also breed and sex
when pertinent) and degree of illness can be evaluated. The separate
experiments may be designed to permit the pooling of data into a single
analysis, if the degree of illness can be standardized.
<P>
The basal ration must contain the same ingredients and in the same amount as
found or proposed in the "carrier" of the drug as it will be marketed.

Research data must be generated utilizing any proposed lower limit if a range
is proposed. These levels must be verified by assay.
<P>
3. The usage of the product should be demonstrated under actual commercial
production conditions, when the disease condition, the claims, husbandry
practices, and the target species make it possible to conduct trials which will
result in data that can be evaluated and interpreted objectively. In the event
that actual commercial production condition studies will not result in such
data, then controlled studies should be designed that simulate as nearly as
possible actual commercial conditions. Where indicated, controlled studies
should be supplemented by field use studies as provided for under Section 512
(d)(3) of the FD&amp;C Act and Section 135.12 of the Regulations.
<P>
4. Studies should be conducted to terminal weight (slaughter or market) in all
classes of animals for which the drug is recommended. If terminal weight is not
slaughter weight (e.g., dairy replacement animals, feeder pigs), a post
treatment observation period should follow to determine: (1) the relative
maintenance of efficacy, (2) any detrimental effects due to drug withdrawal, or
(3) the effects of subsequent administration of the drug or drugs as may be
recommended by labeling.
<P>
5. Efficacy may be demonstrated employing both quantitative and qualitative
measures.<UL>

  <LI>   Quantitative measurements may include live weight gains (a reflection of
relative health only) lesion scores at slaughter, symptoms if can be graded,
temperatures, bacteriological cultures, tests of microbial susceptibility,
serology where appropriate, CBC's and any other appropriate tests.

  <LI>   Qualitative measurements may include signs, organism isolation and other
currently recognized qualitative measurements.

<LI>   The magnitude of the differences in quantitative and/or qualitative
measurement(s) between treated animals and adequate contemporary control
animals must be shown to be repeatable through the use of appropriate
statistical methodology.

</UL>
6. An antibacterial drug when fed at intermediate levels for prophylactic
purposes, shall not be less effective than the recognized therapeutic regimen
of the drug(s).
<P>
Controlled studies shall be conducted to determine whether claimed prophylactic
uses of antibacterial drugs in animal feed afford protection that is at least
as effective as the recognized therapeutic use administered at the time
clinical signs of disease become evident. Morbidity, mortality, weight gains,
and feed efficiency should be considered.
<P>
When the intermediate level has been shown to be effective, but must be used
for long-term feeding, especially up to slaughter, then this procedure must be
measured against short-term feeding at recognized therapeutic levels. An
exception to this could be made where the nature of the disease is such that
continuous treatment is indicated for control e.g., swine dysentery.
<P>
<B>DRUG COMBINATIONS:</B>
<P>
The criteria above apply also to combinations of drugs, therefore, they
will not be restated. Generally, when two or more drugs are combined, each must
be shown to contribute to the total effect of the product by appropriate
experimental design and scientific methodology.
<P>
1. Each drug in the combination must demonstrate its activity.
<UL>
 <LI>    When each drug of a combination affects different characteristics (e.g.,
anticholinergic drug or coccidiostat plus an antibacterial), the effect of each
drug (non-interference must be demonstrated.

  <LI>  For a drug combination containing drugs which have an effect on the same
characteristic, data must demonstrate that the combination results in an
additive effect.

  <LI>  For each antibacterial drug in a combination which contributes to one or
more independent characteristics (claims), data must demonstrate that each drug
contributes to the overall response for a significant population requiring such
concurrent therapy and that a diligent effort has been made to verify each
claim.</UL>

2. Controlled studies shall be conducted to measure the efficacy of minimum
levels of approved or proposed non-antibacterial drugs (e.g., coccidiostats) in
target animals in the presence of maximum claim levels of antibacterial drugs
when the concurrent use of such products is approved or proposed. These studies
must also assess the effect of the use of the antibacterial drug on the safety
of the non-antibacterial drug for the animal.
<P>
3. Controlled studies shall be conducted to evaluate the presence or absence of
changes in the residue picture of either drug(s) in combination. If there is a
change, the withdrawal time for the combination must reflect the change.
<P>
4. Controlled studies shall be conducted to evaluate the presence or absence
of changes. in the frequency or severity of adverse reactions produced by the
use of the drugs in combination.
<P>
5. Controlled studies shall be conducted to assess the effect on assay method
for any of the drugs in combination.

<H3>Use of Statements Regarding NADA Approval by FDA in Labeling and
Advertising of New Animal Drugs</H3><hr>
<b>(CPG 7125a.02)</b><P>
BACKGROUND: <P>
A veterinary device which has been the subject of regulatory attention is a
dog collar which is activated by barking resulting in an electric shock to the
dog which supposedly trains him to stop barking.  *CVM* believes the collars
fall under the definition of a device since they are intended to affect
barking, which is a natural dog function.  Complaints received, which were
later corroborated by our own testing, included severe burns in the collar area
and possible personality adjustment injuries to the dogs.  The shocking
mechanism was found to be activated not only by barking but by vehicle horns,
slamming doors or any other loud noise.  *CVM* concurred in regulatory action
against the device since it was deemed to be dangerous to the health of the
animal.<P>
POLICY:<P>
Dog collars which are activated by the noise of barking to produce an
electric shock are considered as hazardous to the health of the animal.

<B>I. Introduction</B><P>
A food additive cannot be shipped legally in interstate commerce until a food
additive regulation is promulgated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). The basis for a food additive regulation is a food additive petition
(FAP) that contains data demonstrating, among other things, the safety and
utility of the use of proposed additive. This guideline delineates the types of
evidence that may be used by sponsors to demonstrate the utility of food
additives used in aquaculture (see food additive definition in Section III).<P>

This guideline is not an exhaustive source of information on this topic.
Manufacturers and scientists are encouraged to consult the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act, particularly sections 201 (Definitions), 301 (Prohibited
Acts), and 409 (Food Additives), and the regulations in Code of Federal
Regulations 21 CFR 570.17 (investigational food additive) and 21 CFR 571 (food
additive petitions). Sponsors of food additives are also encouraged to consult
the Guideline on the Conduct of Clinical Investigations: Responsibilities of
Clinical Investigators and Monitors for Investigational New Animal Drug Trials,
for additional technical guidance.<P>

Guidelines state practices or procedures that may be useful but are not legal
requirements. The guideline represents the agency's position at the time of
issuance. A person may follow the guideline or may choose to follow alternate
practices or procedures. If a person chooses to use alternate practices or
procedures, that person may wish to discuss the matter further with the agency
to prevent an expenditure of money and effort on activities that may later be
determined to be unacceptable to FDA. The guideline does not bind the agency,
and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits for or on
any person. When a guideline states a requirement imposed by statute or
regulation, however, the requirement is law and its force and effect are not in
any way changed by virtue of its inclusion in the guideline.<P>

FDA will modify this guideline as needed. We are open to constructive
suggestions which will make the guideline a more meaningful tool for developing
data for FDA preclearance of aquaculture food additive products.<P> 
<B>II. General Considerations</B><P>
<B>A. Protocol Development</B><P>
The logical starting point in any experiment is a clear understanding of the
questions that need answering. The Center believes the time and effort put into
planning an experiment should be a rigorous component of the food additive
process. There is no regulatory requirement that sponsors of food additives
submit their experimental protocols to CVM, and CVM does not "approve"
protocols. However, the CVM strongly encourages submission of protocols prior
to initiation of the studies. The sponsor should allot sufficient time
for CVM comment and discussion of all issues in the design, well in advance
of initiation of the studies.<P>
The Center recognizes the diversity of food additive types. Consequently,
protocols may reflect idiosyncrasies in experimental design unique to the
product. Regardless of uniqueness, utility should be demonstrated through a
combination of laboratory and field trials conducted with the target species.
Sponsors are strongly urged to utilize this guideline when developing
protocols. For specific guidance regarding antimicrobial food additives,
sponsors should consult the "Guidelines for Utility Studies for anti-Salmonella
Chemical Food Additives in Animal Feeds."<P>
<B>B. Record Keeping</B><P>
The integrity of the data collected and reported is a critical component
in determining the utility of a food additive. The data should be collected and
managed such that they are valid. Valid data should have the following
characteristics: 1) They should be signed and dated by the person making the
observation entry; 2) They should be original (i.e., they should be the first
recording of the observations); 3) They should be legible; 4) They should be
contemporaneous; and, 5) They should be accurate. All data should be recorded
in a permanent manner. Each original data sheet should be signed by the person
making the observation and recording the data. If data are collected
electronically, proper system controls should be employed to ensure that data
have all characteristics above mentioned in order to be considered valid.
Additional information on investigator record-keeping and record retention can
be found in the Guideline on the Conduct of Clinical Investigations:
Responsibilities of Clinical Investigators and Monitors for Investigational New
Animal Drug Trials.<P>

<B>C. Analytical Assays</B>
<BR>
There must be assurance that the specific amount of the tested additive has
been incorporated into the feed. A quantitative approach is necessary to
provide this assurance, and it is achieved by chemical analysis. The results of
chemical analysis are usually available as a set of numbers representing
replicate determinations made under (as near as possible) identical conditions.
These numbers might correspond to percentage purity, etc. The  interpretation
of a raw data set answers two questions: (1) What is the best estimate of the
true value of the quantity being measured? and (2) How reliable is the number
as an estimator of the true value?<P>
Every analytical procedure possesses three main attribute categories:
applicability, reliability, and efficiency. The purposes of the analytical
procedure are to determine the composition of matter and the identity of its
components and their concentration. The reliability and confidence of these
determinations should be stated. The depth and breadth of the description of
these attributes depends upon the intended use of the method, i.e., research,
regulatory, or screening. In most cases the research method becomes the
regulatory one. The following parameters should be evaluated by the
petitioner:<P>
1) Applicability - The method of measurement should be specific for the analyte
(s) in question. The method should be able to separate or resolve the analyte
(s) from other substances and interfering compounds, i.e., it must be
selective. Every method has limits of measurement and they should be described
in terms of limit of detection and limit of determination
(quantitation). The range of use and measurement of the method should be
described. In addition, the following questions should be asked: (a) What
commodities or matrices will the method be applied to; (b) What is the
concentration range of the analyte to be measured; (c) Is the method linear
over this concentration range; and (d) Is the method susceptible to
interference?<P>
2) Reliability - This parameter addresses the accuracy of the measurement
system. Accuracy is described according to its systematic (bias) and random
(imprecision) errors. Random error is described as repeatability or
analyst-to-analyst, and day-to-day variation, and reproducibility, or
lab-to-lab variation. The method should be shown to be rugged or optimized, and
under control.<P>
3) Efficiency - The method should be easy and cost efficient to run. The level
of training and safety should be addressed.<P>

Once the error associated with the system of measurement is quantified, the
system must be validated in a matrix that is representative of field use. After
that, the petitioner should demonstrate that the active material can be
adequately mixed in a fish ration to be pelleted or extruded. This is best done
by mixing a production batch of feed, taking many samples of the feed
throughout the process and quantifying the analyte by multiple analysis. This
approach is valid also for the research feed batch prepared in the laboratory.
In addition, the petitioner should demonstrate the additive stability in the
market container, and in the feed. A stability protocol should be developed and
CVM concurrence obtained. Additional information on validation of analytical
methods can be found in the CVM guideline entitled "NRSP-7: Recommendations for
Evaluating Analytical Methods."<P>


<B>D. Nutritional Content and Preparation of Experimental Diets</B>
<P>
The Center believes that the experimental data should be collected on animals
consuming nutritionally adequate diets, except when the additive is a nutrient,
so that observed responses are attributable to the food additive rather than a
possible nutritional interaction or to confounding effects due to inadequate or
excessive amounts of certain nutrients. Nutrient recommendations for aquatic
animals, published by the National Academy of Sciences, National Research
Council, can serve as a reference for dietary formulation. However, sponsors
should be aware that nutritional information for aquatic animals is being
developed at a relatively rapid rate (e.g. Cowey et al. 1985, Lovell 1988,
Halver 1989, Takeda and Watanabe 1990). New research findings, particularly
those having a logical connection with the food additive, should be included in
the experimental design. As an alternative, diets may be formulated to meet
predominant commercial practices for the species and class of animal being fed.
Diets should be formulated and manufactured with those ingredients currently in
use with the target species.<P>


Experimental diets should be prepared from a basal diet which is uniform with
regards to nutrient densities and composition. If the basal diet is derived
from several mixer batches, the diet corresponding to each treatment group
should be composed of aliquots from each mixer batch. For example, if 3000
pounds of each experimental diet is needed and the mixer capacity is only 3000
pounds, the schedule in Figure 1 should be followed. In this example, only two
levels of the additive (zero and 1X proposed use level) are used.<P>

When individual batches are fed separately, each batch should be equally
divided among treatment groups. All treatments should be switched from batch 1
to batch 2 feed, from batch 2 to batch 3 feed, etc. at the same time. Also, the
experimental diets should be switched at the same time across treatment
groups (e.g., from starter to grower feeds). Additionally, diets used in
related laboratory and field studies should contain similar nutrient densities.
The procedures used to prepare the basal diet and collect feed samples should
be described in the protocol.
<P>
<HR>
Figure 1. Example of procedure for development of an uniform basal diet for a
food additive study.
<HR>
For the three batches, three thousand pounds of feed is mixed, and divided into
three (3) aliquots of 1000 pounds. The aliquots will be assigned randomly to
the two experimental groups and one reserve (spare) group. The aliquot assigned
to the reserve group will be used only if necessary.

<HR>
Diet 1- Obtained by combining the three 1000-pound aliquots. No food additive
is mixed with this diet. The diet is pelleted (see note below), assayed, and
bagged.
<P>
Diet 2 - Obtained by combining the three 1000-pound aliquots. The combination
is mixed with the food additive ( 1X proposed use level), then pelleted (see note
below), assayed, and bagged.<P>
Reserve - Obtained by combining the three 1000-pound aliquots and then remixed
(extra diet).<P>
<HR>
NOTE: Substitute extruded for pelleted where appropriate.
<P>

Proper mixing of feedstuffs and additives will ensure the uniform dispersal of
nutrients and food additive(s) in finished feeds. The sponsor and/or
investigator should be cognizant of the performance capabilities of the feed
mixer used to prepare the experimental diets. One method that can be used to
measure mixer performance is a determination of the mixing time required to
ensure that assays are either the lesser of a ten percent (or less) coefficient
of variation, or two times the analytical variation of the selected assay
(Behnke, 1991; Wicker and Poole, 1991). Each investigator should develop
standard operating procedures to prevent contamination of experimental
feeds.<P>

The form (pellet, extruded pellet, crumble, etc.) of the experimental diets
should reflect the predominant conditions of use. It is important to conduct
these studies using the predominant feed form because the milling process may
affect the utility of the food additive(s). Pelleted and extruded feeds are
subjected to varying degrees of temperature and pressure, which may affect the
stability of the food additive(s) and microbiological profile of the feed.
Manufacturing conditions, particularly for extruded diets, should be closely
monitored and reported.<P>

To demonstrate the nutritional adequacy of the experimental diet(s), the
sponsor should include in the protocol a complete and detailed list, including
amounts therein, of all feeds and vitamin-mineral premixes used in compounding
the basal diet. Feeds used in compounding should be those commonly used in each
geographical location of production. At a minimum, the calculated nutrient
levels of the uniform basal diet should be reported for crude protein, crude
fat, lysine, arginine, methionine, methionine + cystine, tryptophan, vitamin C,
and phosphorus (total and estimated available). If the food additive is known
to interact, either positively or negatively, with other nutrients, then the
levels of those nutrients should be reported as well. The sponsor should
substantiate nutritional adequacy by demonstrating that the calculated nutrient
levels meet the minimum requirement as established by the National
Research Council or more recent authoritative source.<P>

To ensure that the diets are within the formulated values specified in the
protocols, chemical analyses should be performed on the uniform basal diet and
all experimental diets after pelleting or extrusion. A composite sample from
each diet, which is representative of the diet, should be assayed for the
following; proximate components (crude protein, crude fiber, ash, crude fat and
moisture), lysine, methionine, cystine, arginine, tryptophan, phosphorus,
vitamin C, and degree of lipid oxidation. The exact number of analytical
replicates should be specified in the protocol. The sponsor should indicate
whether analyses are reported on an as-fed or dry matter basis and provide
sufficient information to determine key nutrient levels on either basis.<P>

The Center recommends using a 90% confidence interval to determine the adequacy
of the diet. The Center considers the confidence interval approach to be a
means by which the sponsor and/or investigator can be assured that the diets
are nutritionally adequate and acceptable to the Center for the nutrients
assayed. Nutrient concentrations that fall outside the confidence interval are
not necessarily unsatisfactory to the Center. The Center will consider the
magnitude of the deviation from the confidence interval and nutritional
circumstances when the adequacy of the diet is determined.<P>

The confidence interval approach can be applied in the following manner. The
sponsor should select a laboratory that will conduct the chemical analyses of
the manufactured feed. Once a laboratory has been selected, the sponsor should
obtain the coefficient of variation associated with each laboratory assay
procedure. The coefficient of variation and a reference to the methodologies
for each assay should be stated in the protocol.<P>
The 90% confidence interval (CI) for a diet formulated to contain a theoretical
(calculated) nutrient concentration is calculated as follows:<P>
<UL>
<LI>CI = X &#177; t&#40;alpha&#47;2, infinity&#41; *(CV * X),
</UL>
<P>
where,
<P><UL>
<LI>&#116;&#40;alpha&#47;2, infinity&#41; 
= &#116;&#40;.10&#47;2, infinity&#41; = 1.645

<P>
<LI>CV - coefficient of variation associated with the chemical<BR>
assay, and
<P>
<LI>X = theoretical (calculated) nutrient concentration.
</UL><P>
For example, a CI for a diet formulated to contain 0.50% dietary methionine,
given a hypothetical coefficient of variation of 12%, would be as follows:
<P><UL>
<LI>CI = 0.50% methionine &#177; 1.645 x (0.12 x 0.50), or
<P>
<LI>CI = 0.50% methionine &#177; 0.10%.
</UL><P>
Therefore, nutrient concentration for methionine may range from 0.40 to 0.60%
and will be acceptable to the CVM. Because it is equal to &#116;
&#40;0.10/2,infinity&#41;,  the
coefficient of variation used should be based on a large number of samples
(greater than 120).
<P>
For products labeled for a specific dietary nutrient concentration, the
chemically determined nutrient concentration should fall within the confidence
interval. When a single assay is conducted, the assay should fall within the
confidence interval, as given above. Because multiple assays of a single feed
sample provide additional information on the nutrient concentration, the assay
values should be averaged and the CI should be adjusted. This is necessary
because the CI concept is predicated on a single assay value. In this
situation, the sponsor can apply the adjusted CI method to the data. This
procedure will verify that the population from which the assay values are
collected is similar with respect to the mean and variance as the population
used to establish the assay coefficient of variation. The coefficient of
variation used in the confidence interval should be adjusted as follows:
<UL>
<LI>
Adjusted CV = CV/n,
</UL>
where,<UL>
<LI>CV = the coefficient of variation, and<P>
<LI>n = the square root of the number of assays conducted on a single feed
sample.
</UL>
<B>E. Physical Characteristics of the Diet</B><P>
Water stability evaluation of finished feeds, whether of the sinking or the
floating form, should be conducted after manufacturing and should include
physical and nutritional characterization. Chemical composition of the water
used should be thoroughly characterized and reported. Changes in nutrient
levels (particularly dry matter, crude protein, crude fat, crude fiber, ash,
phosphorus, and vitamin C), and food additive should be recorded from samples
removed from the water at 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 minutes. If a feed contains
crystalline amino acids, then their concentrations should also be determined.
These studies should be replicated in water at optimal temperature for the
target species and at 5&#176;C above and below that temperature. If the target
species is euryhaline, then these studies should be conducted in freshwater,
brackishwater and saltwater (i.e., 0, 6-10 and 30-40 ppt salinity,
respectively). If the target species is stenohaline on either extreme (i.e.,
either strictly freshwater or saltwater), then evaluations might appropriately
be conducted only in the salinity likely to be encountered in commercial
settings.<P>
Other food additives, whose intended effect may be on the pellet rather than
the target species (e.g., mold inhibitors, antioxidants, etc.), should be
evaluated in such a manner that resulting data are scientifically valid and
convincing in their claim of utility. It is best for sponsors to submit
protocols to the Center for comment as discussed in the Introduction to this
document. Whether the intended effect is on the pellet rather than the target
species, feeding trials should also be conducted. The combined physical diet
characterization and feeding data will help insure the Center of the utility of
the additive as well as the effect of feeding it to the target species.<P>
<B>F. Experimental Procedure</B><P>
<BR>
All studies designed to evaluate the utility of food additives in diets fed to
aquatic animals should follow all applicable local, state and federal
regulations, including, but not limited to, environmental regulations regarding
discharge of effluents from experimental sites. All personnel involved with the
investigations should have adequate scientific training and experience with the
species used in the experiments. The personnel responsible for the day-to-day
management of the animals and for making and recording observations ideally
should be blinded to the experimental treatments. The blinding procedures
should be described in the protocol.
<OL>
<LI> Design<P>
A number of different experimental designs have been used in nutritional
studies with aquatic animals. Thus, no single design is recommended. Again,
sponsors are encouraged to submit experimental protocols to CVM prior to
initiation of any study and wait for CVM comments before starting the
experiments. Salient points to consider include the following: 1) studies
should be conducted in a scientifically valid manner: 2) If a block experiment,
blocks should be homogenous with respect to environmental conditions, except in
field trials in which environmental conditions will vary; 3) If a Latin Square
experiment, it should be completely replicated: and 4) At least three
replicates of each experimental group should be used in all evaluations.  All
procedures relating to experimental design, assignment of animals and
treatments, and statistical analyses should be described in the protocol. A
completely randomized design should be considered for the evaluation of food
stability and leaching of nutrients.<P>
The protocols should include diagrams of the buildings and identify any
blocking and treatment allocation schemes used. Those diagram(s) should be
specific for each location and include the following: orientation of the
building, type of building, ventilation and lighting systems, dimensions of
experimental units, location of feeder, and location of aeration supply.<P>

The number of studies that will be conducted should be specified in the
protocol prior to initiation of any experimentation. For field trials, a
minimum of three studies representing different geographical locales should be
conducted.<P>
<LI>Animals<P>
Studies should be conducted using the target animal for which the food additive
is intended. The animals used should be from contemporary, commercial
genotypes. Healthy juveniles or adults representing the target age group, sex
and species should be used in the experiments. The source of the animals should
be documented. The age and health of the broodstock from which the animals
originated should also be described. Detailed records should be kept on
acquisition of animals, including past health records from the site of origin.
Transportation to the experimental site should be designed to minimize stress.
Procedures used during transportation should be those found in commercial
situations. Typical conditions are withholding feed prior to transport, careful
attention to water temperatures, maintenance of adequate dissolved oxygen
levels during transport, use of only approved chemicals, and loading rates that
do not result in excessive stress. Any compounds used during this period should
be documented, including dosages, frequency of application, and any observed
responses. After arrival at the experimental site, all animals should be
quarantined for a minimum of three weeks in holding units separate from those
to be used in the experiment. All observations must be reported in the FAP.<P>

Stresses outside the scope of the experiment should be minimized. Animals
should be handled gently at all times. During the experiment, animals should be
observed as frequently as required by good management techniques. The frequency
of observation should be specified in the protocol. The Center recognizes that
most aquatic animals are not domesticated, and losses of animals may occur.
However, those losses, when possible, should be thoroughly evaluated to
determine causes and a complete report of the gross necropsy findings and
histopathological examination, by a qualified professional, should be included
with the FAP. Bacteriology, virology and toxicology reports should be included
in those situations that warrant the additional evaluations.
<P>
Vaccination programs, if warranted, should be designed to protect the animals
against prevalent infectious disease (s), yet not debilitate the animals or
otherwise compromise the experiment. Information concerning any vaccination
program should be provided (i.e., method of administration, date of
vaccination, age at vaccination, source of vaccine, lot number, type of
vaccine, handling of vaccine, expiration date and any other pertinent
information).<P>
Gender of animals should be determined, minimally, on completion of the field
trials by post-mortem examination. A subsample of animals is appropriate in
large-scale studies, but the procedures for selecting samples should be
explained. While determining gender is impractical in some laboratory studies
because the animals are too young to have developed testes or ovaries, sex
determinations should be attempted in all phases of the evaluations.<P>

<LI> Feeding<P>

Feed allotments should be restricted in laboratory studies and ad libitum in
field trials. Restricted feed rates are those calculated and expressed as a
percent of body weight offered on a daily basis. The rate should be calculated
on the basis of dry weight of feed and wet weight of animal. Ad libitum feeding
means offering food until all of the animals appear satiated. The Center
recognizes that this can vary among sites and individuals judging satiation.
Thus, it is important to provide data indicating feed consumption when using
this feeding approach. This comparison will allow more precise information
regarding effective levels and extrapolation of those data to commercial
situations. The Center recognizes the impracticality of restricted feeding
studies with juveniles of some species (e.g., fish, crustaceans, mollusks,
etc., which, in commercial settings, are generally offered feed in excess and
at frequent intervals) and recommends feeding those species in a manner similar
to practical situations.<P>
If automatic feeders are used in field trials, they should be maintained in
such a way as to minimize feed wastage and calibrated as closely as possible.
If demand feeders are used in field trials, estimates of voluntary consumption
should be collected on a regular basis to allow for identification of changes
in consumption among treatment groups or as the studies progress.<P>
<LI> Loading<P>
  
An experimental unit is the physical container holding a group of aquatic
animals. Common experimental units are aquaria, tanks, cages, net pens,
raceways and ponds. Consistent methods should be used in placing the fish in
the experimental units to ensure the accuracy of the number of fish per unit.
The protocol should include a description of those methods. Extra animals
should not be placed in the experimental units. Fish which die during the
experiment should not be replaced.
<P>
The loading rate is established by determining the amount (in weight) of fish
that can be reared in a experimental unit which receives a known water flow
(e.g. gallon/minute). Factors that may influence the loading rate include water
quality, water temperature, water volume, rate of flow, rate of change, and
kind and size of fish held. The loading rate should be at a level that is
considered to elicit no adverse effects on the target species. If appropriate
loading rates are not known for the target species, then those considered
appropriate for a closely related species should be used. It is imperative that
the loading rate be maintained during the study. This may be done, for example,
by adjusting the water flow in proportion to the changes in total weight of the
fish in an experimental unit.<P>
 <LI> Laboratory Trials<P>
In the laboratory studies, the animal husbandry techniques used should be
designed to minimize stress of the animals and promote maximum weight gain.
While the Center recognizes that each species is distinct, some general areas
need to be considered in the experimental design and those should be adequately
addressed in the protocol. Water quality values should be maintained at levels
that will not elicit any adverse effect on the animals. While those values
could range widely due to varying susceptibility of the target species, some
common considerations are provided. Dissolved oxygen levels vary with
temperature, salinity and altitude. Regardless of conditions, dissolved oxygen
levels should be maintained at all times at 90% of saturation and monitored at
least daily in the experimental units. Nitrogenous compounds (particularly
ammonia-N and nitrite-N) should be maintained below levels that elicit adverse
response from the target species. If detailed toxicological studies have not
been conducted with the target species, then un-ionized ammonia-N and nitrite-N
levels should be maintained below 0.02 mg/L (Thurston et al., 1979) and 0.4
mg/L, respectively. Levels of nitrogenous products, including nitrate-N,
should be monitored in such a way as to assure minimal chance of transient
increases that might not be recorded. For example, experimental systems that
have established records of successful studies with the target species would be
preferred. Submission of water quality records, historical values if available
and those from the actual study, should be submitted with the FAP. Other water
quality variables should be closely monitored. Those include hardness (total-,
calcium-, and magnesium hardness), alkalinity (total-, carbonate- and
bicarbonate alkalinity), pH and carbon dioxide. As with the nitrogenous
compounds, values should be determined on a regular basis and the schedule
adopted should be described. Temperatures should be maintained at near optimal
for the target species and not vary more than &#177; 1&#176;C from the target
temperature. Studies should be conducted for a sufficient period of time to
define intended effects. Appropriate time frames for laboratory studies will
vary depending on species and food additive, but should be consistent with
similar studies published in the peer-reviewed literature.<P>

<LI> Field Trials<P>

The size of experimental unit used in field trials should be the same as those
used commercially. Further, sites of field trials should be in several areas
throughout the range of production of the target species. For example, sites
near the center of current production, and at the extremes should be included.
With aquatic animals, a range of sites in which water quality (temperature,
hardness, etc.) values may vary would provide more detailed information about
the food additive in a variety of commercial situations. This approach should
be seriously considered in the design. Animals should be grown until they reach
marketable size, based on current practices at the experimental site, or until
environmental conditions (e.g., temperatures at which the target species stops
growing) warrant cessation of the experiment. Stocking densities should be
those found in commercial practices in the area and should be reported. In
addition to the water quality values mentioned above (laboratory trials), other
water quality variables which are considered important in field trials should
also be monitored. Those include algal and zooplankton population and species
composition, and turbidity. If warranted, pesticide and heavy metal levels
should be determined in tissues of aquatic animals from field trials. The water
quality collection schedule should be adequately described in the protocol. The
CVM recognizes the daily changes in water quality in some production systems
for aquatic animals. However, water quality variables should be maintained in a
range considered to have no adverse effect on the target species. Protocols for
monitoring and maintaining water quality should be carefully documented.<P>

Additional studies should be conducted if the target species is commercially
raised in a variety of production systems, or if the sponsor intends to label
the food additive as appropriate for the target species raised in different
production systems. For example, if tilapia are the target species and the
sponsor desires to include the additive in diets fed in earthen ponds,
flow-through tanks, and recirculating systems, then additional studies should
be conducted in the distinct production systems.</OL><P>
<B>G. Investigator Report</B><P>
An investigator should prepare and submit to the sponsor upon completion of
each of the investigator's study(ies) a signed and dated, detailed, independent
report that evaluates all observations made during the study. The first report
submitted to the sponsor is the investigator's "final" report. Any and all
subsequent changes to the report should be considered as amendments. The final
report should include, but not be limited to, the following:
<OL>

specific facitity(ies) where each study was performed.
<LI> The dates on which the study was initiated and completed.

<LI> The objectives and procedures stated in the study protocol, which should
include any changes from the original protocol. A description of all management
practices used, which should include a record of all observations. Sufficient
detail should be provided to allow reconstruction or replication of the
study(ies).

<LI>  The number, species, stock or strain, source of supply, gender if known,
size and age, or any change in the health condition of the animals used should
be specified. The identification procedures, if used, and disposition records
for each animal should be provided.<BR>

<LI>  A description of the dosage regimen, and duration of the treatment should be
given. Records of the disposition of the unused food additive or animal feeds
containing the additive should be provided.

<LI> Records of all mixing or further dilution of the food additive, and results
of the assays in the feed.

<LI> All adverse reactions observed during the study.

<LI> A description of all circumstances that may have affected the quality or
integrity of the data. This should include specifying the time frame and the
extent of the occurrences.

<LI> The name of the study monitor, associates, colleagues, and employees
involved, and the nature and extent of their participation.

<LI>The location of all original copies of source data, specimens, samples, and
study records should be reported.

<LI>A statement attesting to the accuracy and completeness of the data, which
should include a statement acknowledging that the data were collected in
compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

<H3>CVM GUIDELINE 19 - ANIMAL HEALTH SAFETY CRITERIA </H3>

The following criteria must be satisfied in order to establish that the use of
low and/or intermediate levels of an antibacterial drug in animal feeds is a
safe practice from the aspect of animal health.  In general, such drug use
should not result in: (1) a significant adverse effect on the relative quantity,
prevalence, and shedding of salmonella organisms in the animal, (2) a
significant increase of salmonella organisms resistant to drugs used in
clinical veterinary medicine and to drugs not authorized for use in
food-producing animals, (3) disease that is more difficult to treat, (4)
adverse effect on the animal due to significant increase in the resistance of
coliforms to antibacterial drugs used in clinical veterinary medicine, (5)
enhanced pathogenicity of bacteria, (6) continuing increase in amount of drug
necessary to achieve the desired response.
<P>
<B>STUDIES NECESSARY IN ADDRESSING THE CRITERIA:</B>
<OL>
<LI> An antibacterial drug fed to animals shall not cause a significant adverse
effect on the relative quantity, prevalence (numbers of shedding animals),
duration of shedding, or the resistance characteristics of salmonella organisms
in the animals.  If any of these effects occur, then studies to assess their
clinical consequence must be undertaken.
<P>
Controlled studies must be undertaken to determine whether or not the
administration of an antibacterial drug at subtherapeutic levels results in:
<P>

a. an increase in the prevalence of salmonella in the intestinal tract of the
animal or the duration of shedding of these salmonella as compared to
controls.<P>
b. an increase in the proportion of resistant salmonella, the degree of
resistance and the spectrum of resistance including antibacterial agents not
authorized in food-producing animals (e.g., chloramphenical).<P>
c. disease that is more difficult or impossible to treat with therapeutic
levels of the same drug or if it is necessary to resort to another drug for
treatment.  (Clinical disease must be present as a natural or artificially
induced occurrence.)
 <P>
It is suggested that specific pathogen-free animals be used for determining the
effect of these drugs on an induced population of enteric organisms as outlined
in #1 above.  The baseline incidence of drug resistance in the indigenous flora
of the animals used in these studies should not exceed 20&#37; on a quantitative basis.
Additionally, the resistance spectrum within the resistant flora should be
delineated.<P>
<LI> An antibacterial drug fed to animals shall not promote a significantly
increased prevalence of coliforms that are resistant to antibacterial drugs
used in clinical veterinary medicine.<P>
 
a. Controlled studies shall be undertaken to determine whether or not the
administration of an antibacterial drug at low and/or intermediate levels to
target animals results in an increase in the numbers of coliforms bearing R-factors 
present in the intestinal tract of the animal.
<P>
b. If an increase on the coliforms bearing R-factors is found in trials
conducted under (a), then the resistance spectrum must be determined to
ascertain if there are determinants for resistance to antibacterial drugs used
in clinical veterinary medicine as well as to drugs not authorized in
food-producing animals, e.g., choramphenicol.<P>
c. If such resistance determinants are found in (b), animals must be maintained
and monitored to market weight to determine their clinical consequence.
  <P>
The baseline incidence of drug resistant organisms in the test and control
animals shall satisfy the criteria set forth in paragraph 1 of the document.<P>
<P>
<LI> The use of low and/or intermediate levels of an antibacterial drug shall not
enhance the pathogenicity of bacterial.  The association of toxin production
characteristics with transfer factors must be investigated in well-designed
studies.  To determine if the use of antibacterial drugs in animal feed
enhances pathogenicity of gram-negative bacilli, it should be possible to
conduct experiments to see if a plasmid for toxin production could become
linked to the R-factor and transferred <I>in vitro</I>.  If this can be established <i>in
vitro,</i> then experiments could be done in germ-free animals to see if the
phenomenon occurs <I>in vivo</I>.  If it can be demonstrated in germ-free animals,
experiments could then be done in conventional animals.
<P>
It is recognized that this criterion, at present, should not be a requirement
for maintenance of existing registrations or obtaining new registrations.
However, it is expected that sponsors who meet all other specified criteria and
who wish to market after the stated deadline be committed to initiate these
studies within the two (2) year timetable and report on such studies at regular
intervals to the FDA.  As additional information becomes available, it may be
necessary to incorporate these findings into a definite criterion. 
<P>
<LI>  The optimum usage level for each indication of use of the antibacterial
drug at subtherapeutic levels shall not increase significantly with continued
use.<P>
Once the optimum level is established, a study shall continue over succeeding
generations or populations of animals to determine if this same level continues
to yield the same measurable effect.

<TITLE>FDA PUBLISHES FINAL RULE ON EXTRALABEL DRUG USE IN ANIMALS</TITLE>


</HEAD>
<BODY>
November 12, 1996
<P>
<h1>FDA PUBLISHES FINAL RULE ON EXTRALABEL DRUG USE IN ANIMALS</h1><hr>
 <P>
In the November 7, 1996 Federal Register, FDA published a final rule to 
allow veterinarians to prescribe extralabel uses of certain approved animal 
drugs and approved human drugs for animals under certain conditions.  This 
action implements the Animal Drug Use Clarification Act of 1994 (AMDUCA).  
This regulation provides veterinarians with greater flexibility in the use 
of approved drugs in animals.  These regulations put AMDUCA into effect on 
December 9, 1996.
<P>
The notice of proposed rulemaking published in the Federal Register on May 
17, 1996.  FDA received and considered approximately 110 comments in 
preparing the final rule.
<P>
Prior to the enactment of AMDUCA, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(the Act) required users of approved new animal drug products to follow the 
exact directions on the labeling of the drug.  This extralabel use 
restriction precluded use of an approved drug in species or for indications 
(disease or other conditions) not listed in the labeling, use of an 
approved drug at dosage levels higher than those stated on the label, and 
other extralabel purposes.  In addition, the Act did not provide for the 
use of human drugs for treating animals.
<P>
Because of AMDUCA, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act will now permit 
veterinarians, like physicians, to prescribe extralabel uses of approved 
drugs for their patients.  Although certain restrictions have been placed 
on veterinarians prescribing animal and human drugs in an extralabel manner,
 these restrictions generally apply only to the use of drugs extralabelly 
in food-producing animals.  The key constraints are that any extralabel use 
must not result in violative residues in food-producing animals, the use 
must be by or on the order of a veterinarian within the context of a 
veterinarian-client-patient relationship, and the use must be in 
conformance with the new regulations.<P>

AMDUCA includes a number of provisions that permit the Agency to restrict 
extralabel use in certain circumstances.  For example, if there is a 
finding that there is a reasonable probability that an extralabel use may 
present a risk to public health from drug residues in animal-derived food, 
the Agency may establish a safe level for a residue for such extralabel use 
by regulation or order and may require the development of analytical methods for residue detection.  If, after 
affording an opportunity for public comment, FDA finds that an extralabel 
animal drug use presents a risk to public health or that no analytical 
method has been developed and submitted, the Agency may prohibit such 
extralabel use.  The following prohibitions currently apply to the uses of 
drugs in food-producing animals:
<ul>
<li>Chloramphenicol
<li>Clenbuterol
<li>Diethylstilbestrol (DES)
<li>Dimetridazole
<li>Ipronidazole
<li>Other nitroimidazoles
<li>Furazolidone (except for approved topical use)
<li>Nitrofurazone (except for approved topical use)
<li>Sulfonamide drugs in lactating dairy cattle (except approved use of 
sulfadimethoxine, sulfabromomethazine and sulfaethoxypyridazine)
</ul>
Neither AMDUCA nor the implementing regulations are intended to lessen the 
responsibility of the manufacturer, the veterinarian, or the food producer 
with regard to drug residues.  Under AMDUCA, any amount of residue 
resulting from an extralabel use would constitute a violation of the Act if 
a safe level or tolerance has not been established.
 <P>
Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations is now amended to add a new 
part 530, titled "Extralabel Drug Use in Animals.

<b>SECTION II(G)(1)(b)(4) OF THE PRE CLEARANCE GUIDELINES </b><BR>
<b>(OCTOBER 1975)</b><BR>
<pre>

(4) Specific Considerations for Lactating Dairy Cows

This section addresses those studies designed for purposes of supporting a
claim of increased milk production of some component therein for a drug.  This
section equally addresses those studies used to support the utility of food
additives and those studies designed to evaluate the animal safety of drugs and
food additives.

 [a] Claims
      
    [1] Increased milk production

        For this claim, the amount of milk produced during the entire lactating period
        (at least 305-days) should be measured.  If the claim is for a specific period
        of time which is less than 305-days, the data should support the claim for this
        specified period.  However, for the shorter period this increase should not
        affect (decrease) the level of milk production or any other related parameter
        during the remainder of the lactation period.  Of interest is the pounds of
        actual milk and yields adjusted for solids or other major constituent.

    [2] Increased production of milk component

        For this claim, the average composition of milk for that component for the
        entire lactation (at least 305-days) or the average component production for
        the entire lactation (at least 305-days) should be evaluated.  The period of
        increase for the respective component could also be of shorter duration if the
        data supports such.  The remainder of the lactation period for this component
        or any other parameter not intentionally affected could not be adversely
        affected by the increase during the period of treatment.

 [b] Design of studies


    [1] Full lactation studies

        ((a)) Cows to be used in these studies should be blocked or balanced into
              groups according to age, calving date and production during a three week
              standardization period immediately after parturition or previous DHIA production
              (if records are available) or other previous production records.  All cows used
              in such studies should have been previously maintained at the same location and
              at the same level of nutrition.  The use of first lactation cows should be kept
              to a minimum.  Cows within a block should be randomly assigned to treatment.

        ((b))  Other designs will be considered upon request.

        ((c))  Reference is also made to section II(A), (C), (D) and (H) of these
               guidelines.

    [2] Short term lactation studies

        ((a))   For the short term study which begins at parturition, the cows 
                should be blocked or balanced into groups on the basis of age, 
                calving date and production during a three week standardization 
                period immediately after parturition or previous DHIA production 
                (if records are available) or other previous production records. 
                For the short term study which begins at a time other than at
                parturition, cows should be blocked or balanced into groups on
                the basis of stage of lactation, level of production and body 
                weight observed during a three week standardization period.  The 
                cows within blocks should be randomly assigned to treatment groups.  
                As above, cows used in such studies should previously have been 
                maintained at the same location and at the same level of nutrition.

        ((b))   Other designs will be considered upon request.

        ((c))   Reference is also made to section II (A), (C) (D) and (H) of these
                guidelines.

 [c] Parameters to be measured

    [1] Milk yield - Daily milk weights from each cow are desired.  Other weighing
        periods will be considered.

    [2] Milk constitutents - Composite samples (morning and evening) taken
        bi-weekly and weighed for morning and evening milk yield are desired.

    [3] Cow weights

        ((a))   Ideally, cow weights should be taken at a constant time with relation to
                milking and feeding.

        ((b))   The initial weight for all studies should be taken on day zero of the
                standardization period followed by weights being taken on day 21 of the
                standardization period.  This last weight will serve as the day zero weight of
                the lactation trial.

        ((c))   For the full lactation or short term study, weights should be taken
                every three weeks and at the end of the study.  For those studies which begin
                at parturition weights should be taken at parturition, every subsequent three
                weeks and at termination of the study.

        ((d))   All weights should be based on one weighing.

 [d] Data to be provided for each study

   [1] Average daily milk yield for each cow and each treatment.

   [2] Fat and solids corrected milk for each cow and each treatment.
   
   [3] Milk fat (percent and total amount), milk SNF (percent and total amount)
       and milk protein (percent and total amount) for each cow and each treatment.

   [4] Total dry matter intake for each cow and each treatment.  Energy intake
       should be provided if possible (mcal NE or lbs TDN/day).

   [5] Body weight change for each cow and each treatment.

   [6] Persistency of milk and constituent yield for each cow and each treatment
       for the length of the designated experimental period with the base being the
       three week standardization period.  Subsequent three week periods will be used
       for persistency comparisons.  For complete lactation studies which begin at
       parturition, the base period will be the first month of lactation.

   [7] Efficiency (total FCM or SCM or specific component which may be affected
       by the additive/unit of energy intake) for each cow and each treatment.  This
       applies only to those studies in which the cows are not on pasture.

 [e] Cow Management

    [1] Full lactation studies - If the treatment begins at parturition or
        immediately following the three week standardization period, all cows should be
        adjusted to the basal diet two weeks prior to parturition.  Initiation of
        additive administration will depend on previous knowledge of the additive in
        question.

    [2] Short term lactation studies - The short term lactation study may begin at
        parturition, three weeks following parturition or at any other time during the
        lactation study.  If the study begins at parturition or three weeks following
        parturition, the basal diet should be fed beginning two weeks prior to
        parturition.  If the study begins during another part of the lactation period,
        the basal diet should be fed for a minimum of three weeks prior to initation of
        the study.
        
    [3] Herd health - The following are parameters of concern for the evaluation
        of the effects of herd health on treatments and <i>vice versa</i>: post-partum 
        interval, genital diseases, services required for conception, milk fever, 
        ketosis, mastitis, abortions, etc.  All herd health problems and therapy
        will be reported for each animal and each treatment.

    [4] Concentrate adjustment - Concentrate level should be adjusted every 14-28
        days in accordance with production level.

 [f] Animal Safety - See section II (G) (5). 

 [g] Statistical Analysis - If the cows are individually fed the additive, then
     the individual cow will be considered the experimental unit.  If the additive
     is provided on a group basis, the treatment group will be considered the
     experimental unit with more than one group per treatment (replicated in time or
     location) needed for a valid statistical analysis.  Section II (C) of these
     guidelines will be applicable in determining the minimum effective dose.</pre>

<b>Guideline No. 18</b><P>
<H3>Human Health Safety Criteria</H3><P>
U.S. Department Of Health And Human Services <br>
Public Health Service<br>
Food And Drug Administration<br>
Center For Veterinary Medicine<P>
 
<i>The following criteria must be satisfied in order to establish that
the use of low and/or intermediate levels of an antibacterial drug in animal
feeds is a safe practice from the aspect of human health. In general terms,
such drug use should not result in: (1) a significant adverse effect in the
relative quantity, prevalence and shedding of salmonella organisms in animals
(2) a significant increase of salmonella organisms resistant to drugs used in
human clinical medicine in the animal (3) a significant increase in the
resistance of coliforms to antibacterial drugs used in human clinical medicine
provided this resistance is transferable to bacteria in man (4) enhancement of
pathogenicity of bacteria, or (5) adverse effect to humans due to ingestion of
residues of the antibacterial drug, metabolites, or degradation
products.</i><P>
<b>STUDIES NECESSARY IN ADDRESSING THE CRITERIA:</b><P>
Initial categorization of each product as to resistance and R-factor
promoting potential must be accomplished. This categorization shall be
determined by submission of in <i>vitro </i>documentation from the published
literature or other data resulting from studies available to the drug sponsor.
An antibacterial product which is shown to promote gram negative transferable
resistance to drugs used in human clinical medicine must satisfy all criteria
of the Human Health Safety Criteria. Products which are shown not to promote
gram negative transferable resistance to drugs used in human clinical medicine
must undertake studies suggested in &#35; 1 and &#35; 4 below.<P>

1. An antibacterial drug fed to animals shall not cause a significant adverse
effect on the relative quantity, prevalence (numbers of animals shedding)
duration of shedding, or the resistance characteristics of salmonella in the
<i>food animal.</i><P>
Controlled studies shall be undertaken to determine whether or not the
administration of an antibacterial drug at subtherapeutic levels results in:<P>
<ul>
<li>a.	an increase in the relative quantity or prevalence of salmonella in animals
or the duration of shedding of these salmonella as compared to controls.<P>
<li>b.	an increase in the proportion of resistant salmonella, the degree of
resistance, and the resistance spectrum.</ul><P>
It is suggested that specific pathogen-free animals be used for determining the
effect of these drugs on an induced population of enteric organisms as outlined
in &#35; 1 above. The baseline incidence of resistance to drugs used in human
clinical medicine in the indigenous flora of the animals used in these studies
should not exceed 20% on a quantitative basis.<p>
2. An antibacterial drug fed to animals shall not promote an increase of
coliforms that are resistant to antibacterial drugs used in human clinical
medicine and capable of transferring this resistance to bacteria indigenous to
the intestinal tract of man. Studies must be undertaken to assess the
occurrence and significance of these events:<P>
<ul>
<li>a. Controlled studies shall be undertaken to determine whether or not the
administration of an antibacterial drug at low and/or intermediate levels to
target animals results in an increase in the numbers of coliforms beating
R-factors present in the intestinal tract of the animal or a change in
resistant spectrum of these organisms compared to those found in controls
receiving no anti-bacterial drug. The resistance spectrum must be determined to
ascertain whether or not there are present determinants for resistance to
antibacterial drugs used in human clinical medicine.<P>
<li>b. If the resistance determinants indicated in (a) are found, a sponsor may elect
to conduct additional studies to determine if such multiple drug resistance is
transferable to the indigenous coliforms in the intestinal tract <i>of </i>man.
The use of human subjects in such studies must be preceded by clearance from
the Food and Drug Administration as prescribed in the applicable portions of 21
CFR 130.3 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
</ul><P>
The baseline incidence of drug resistant organisms in the test and control
animals shall satisfy the criteria set forth in paragraph 1 of this
document.<P>
3. The use of low and/or intermediate levels of an antibacterial drug shall not
enhance the pathogenicity of bacteria which are capable of being transmitted to
man. The association of toxin production characteristics with transfer factors
must be investigated in well-designed studies. To determine if the use of
antibacterial drugs in animal feed enhances pathogenicity of gram-negative
bacilli, it should be possible to conduct experiments to see if a plasmid for
toxin production could become linked to the R-factor and transferred <i>in
vitro. </i>If this can be established <i>in vitro,</i> then experiments could
be done in germ-free animals to see if the phenomenon occurs <i>in vivo. </i>If
it can be demonstrated in germ-free animals, experiments could then be done in
conventional animals.<P>
It is recognized that this criterion, at present, should not be a requirement
for maintenance of existing registrations or obtaining new registrations.
However, it is expected that sponsors who meet all other specified criteria and
who wish to market after the stated deadline be committed to initiate these
studies within the two (2) year timetable and report on such studies at regular
intervals to the FDA. As additional information becomes available, it may be
necessary to incorporate these findings into a definite criterion.<P>
4. An antibacterial drug used at subtherapeutic levels in the feed of animals
shall not result in residues of the parent compound, metabolites, or
degradation products in the food ingested by man which are capable of causing
(1) an increase in the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria, (2) an increase in
the resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibacterial drugs used in human
clinical medicine.<P>
Controlled studies in appropriate test animals shall be conducted to determine
whether the consumption of food produced by animals receiving antibacterial
drugs will result in:<P>
<ul>
<li>a. An increase in the intestinal flora of the prevalence of pathogenic
bacteria.<P>
<li>b.	An increase in the degree and spectrum of resistance of the intestinal flora
to drugs used in human clinical medicine.
</ul><P>
Experimental procedures shall include appropriate consideration of maximum use
level, minimum withdrawal time and established tolerances.<P>
In addition, a literature survey shall be conducted to determine the incidence
of reports of hypersensitivity resulting from antibacterial drugs in food. The
literature survey shall include information regarding hypersensitivity
reactions occurring as a result of parenteral or topical exposure to
antibacterial drugs as well as those ingested in food. When hypersensitivity
has been shown, experiments in appropriate laboratory animals must be conducted
to develop estimates of what level of antibacterial drugs in food will cause
the production of hypersensitivity.<P>
<i>APPENDIX</i><P>
<b>DEFINITIONS:</b><P>
<i>1. Antibacterial drugs: </i>Term includes antibiotics, sulfonamides and
nitrofuran derivatives. The Agency reserves the right to include other
antibacterial drugs in this definition as additional information becomes
available.<P>
<i>2.	Animal feeds: </i>Any feedstuff including drinking water to Which
antibacterial drugs are added.<P>
<i>3.	Low levels: </i>Levels which carry production claims such as increase in
rate of weight gains and/or improved feed efficiency in clinically healthy
animals.<P>
<i>4. Intermediate levels: </i>Levels generally above the low-level but generally
below the optimum levels used for therapy of clinically sick animals, i.e., for
prevention and/or control of disease.<P>
<i>5.	Subtherapeutic levels: </i>Term is interchangeable with low levels and/or
intermediate levels as defined above.<P>
<i>6.	Therapeutic levels: </i>Levels which have been determined to be optimum
for the treatment of clinically sick animals.<P>
<i>7. Significant: </i>Interpreted as a statistically significant change.
Statistical significance will not be a criterion for the determination of a
public health hazard.<P>
<i>8.	Animal reservoir: </i>This encompasses the gram-negative enteric bacteria
in or on the animals or their excrement.<P>
<i>9. Coliforms: </i>The coliform group of bacteria includes the aerobic and
faculative anaerobic, gram-negative, nonspore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria
which commonly ferment lactose with gas formation within 48 hours at
35 &#176; C.<P>
	<i>10. Resistance spectrum: The </i>sensitivity or resistance of an organism to
antibacterial agents presently used in human clinical medicine as determined by
techniques and criteria accepted in clinical practice.</a><br><hr>

<P>
The Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has
revised its GUIDANCE DOCUMENT FOR ANTI-INFECTIVE BOVINE MASTITIS PRODUCT
DEVELOPMENT.  This guidance document serves to interpret statutory and
regulatory requirements and outlines general procedures for conducting
evaluations for an antimicrobial being considered for approval.  This guidance
document does not preclude alternative procedures which document animal safety
and effectiveness of an anti-microbial.<P>
This Guidance Document represents the agency's position on a procedure or
practice at the time of its issuance.  This Guidance Document is not a legal
requirement.  A person may follow the Guidance Document or may choose to follow
alternative procedures or practices.  If a person chooses to use alternate
procedures or practices that person may wish to discuss the matter further with
the FDA/CVM to prevent an expenditure of money and effort on activities that
may later be determined to be unacceptable.  This Guidance Document does not
bind the agency, and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges,
immunities, or benefits for or on any person.  When a Guidance Document states
a requirement imposed by statute or regulation, however, the requirement is law
and its force and effect are not changed in any way by virtue of its inclusion
in the guidance document.
<P>

<A NAME="3">FOREWORD</A></B>
<P>

<B>
Introduction:</B>
<P>
This guidance document has been assembled to inform the pharmaceutical industry
of the types of data that will demonstrate that an anti-microbial bovine
mastitis product is safe and effective for the cow.  This guidance document is
by no means complete; it deals with the <I>product-specific </I>issues listed
above.  Other useful general information may be found in CVM guidance documents
for Human Food Safety, Drug Stability, etc., which are available from the
Communications and Education Branch (HFV-12), FDA/Center for Veterinary
Medicine, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville, MD  20855.<P>

<B>
Regulations:</B>
<P>
Before a new animal drug is approved, the drug's sponsor must demonstrate,
among other relevant factors, that the proposed drug is safe and effective for
use as recommended in the proposed labeling.  The authority upon which these
requirements are based can be found in Section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b).  Applicable Federal regulations are Title 21
of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 514 which covers New Animal Drug
Applications.<P>
 
<P>
<H3><A NAME="i">I.	ANIMAL SAFETY STUDY</A></H3>
<P>
The sponsor must demonstrate that the product which it proposes to market is safe to 
the target animal.  The safety study listed below will demonstrate target animal safety.  
In addition, any adverse drug reactions occurring during efficacy trials should be 
reported.<P>
<UL>
<LI>A.	IRRITATION STUDY
<OL>
<LI><I> Animal Selection:</I>
<UL>
<LI>a.	Lactating cow products<BR>
Select 6 normal multiparous cows and 6 normal primiparous cows free of 
mastitis.  Half (3) of each group should have daily milk production ABOVE 
60 lb (early lactation) and half (3) BELOW 35 lb (late lactation).  A 
description of each test animal should be submitted stating the animal's age, 
lactation stage and number, and daily milk production.
<LI>b.	Non-lactating cow products<BR>
Select 6 normal multiparous (second lactation or more completed) cows and 
6 primiparous cows completing their first lactation.  A description of each 
test animal should be submitted stating the animal's age, number of 
lactations and, in case of multiparous cows, milk production for the previous 
lactation.</UL>
<LI><I> Data collection: </I> Information to be documented for the pre-treatment, treatment, 
withdrawal, and post-treatment periods should include animal identification, 
farm site, trial number, date of observation, test day and hour, individual milk 
production, and body temperature.  Parameters to be measured twice daily for 
all four quarters include palpation results indicating absence of swelling, 
redness and soreness.  Somatic cell counts should be determined by quantitative 
count methods as described under each treatment period.  Electronic cell 
counting may also be used.  It is advised that quantitative somatic cell counts 
(QSCC) be determined consistently in aliquot samples taken from the total milk 
production of each quarter.  Milk samples used in the determination of milk 
quality may also be taken from this sample.  Animal data should include a copy 
of the laboratory analyses (QSCCs) with the technician's signature and the dates 
of the analyses.
</OL>
<LI>B.	TREATMENT PERIODS
<OL>
<LI>The PRE-TREATMENT period includes at least four (4) milkings (Milking 
intervals are assumed to be 12 hours) before the drug 
product is administered.  Base line observations are made during this time to 
establish that test animals are healthy.  During this period two milk samples 
should be taken at a 24-hour interval for bacterial culture and QSCC 
determinations from all four quarters.  This procedure will help distinguish 
udder irritation due to the treatment in presence or in absence of a pathogenic 
organism.
<LI>The TREATMENT period begins at the fifth (5th) milking, or 60 hours from the 
beginning of the pre-treatment period.  The labeled dose schedule should be 
followed, and all four quarters should be treated with test article.  During this 
period two milk samples should be taken, at a 24-hour interval, from all four 
quarters for bacterial culture and QSCC determinations.
<LI>The WITHDRAWAL period begins with the last recommended treatment and 
continues for the labeled milk withdrawal time when the milk is discarded.  
During this period two milk samples should be taken, at a 24-hour interval, from 
all four quarters for bacterial culture and QSCC determinations.
<LI>The POST-TREATMENT period consists of the twelve (12) milkings1 after the 
proposed labeled milk withdrawal time.  During this period two milk samples 
should be taken, at a 24-hour interval, from all four quarters for bacterial culture 
and QSCC determinations.

<H3> <A NAME="ii">II.	GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR DRUG EFFECTIVENESS STUDIES</A></H3>

The sponsor must demonstrate final product efficacy, consistent with labeled use and 
indications against infectious bovine mastitis.  For clinical treatment claims, the 
presence of an invading udder pathogen, a cytologic reaction, and either abnormal milk 
or clinical signs (such as swelling, redness and soreness) or both are the conditions 
under which the proposed drug should be tested.  For sub-clinical treatment claims, the 
presence of an invading udder pathogen and a cytologic reaction are the conditions 
under which the proposed drug should be tested.
<UL>
<LI>A.	In the clinical study, the distribution of mastitis pathogens from the study will be 
utilized to determine the label efficacy statement.  A sufficient number of major 
udder pathogens will be required to demonstrate effectiveness.
<LI>B.	The degree of cytologic reaction (QSCC) should be reported.  This information will 
be used as a check of the numerical trend between the means of QSCC for "cured" 
and "not cured" cows within each treated group to determine if other studies are 
needed for inflammation and safety.
<LI>C.	Data should be collected using animals representative of the target population/herd.  
Therefore, all lactating or non-lactating cows in the target herd, depending on the 
label claim(s), should be surveyed.  All eligible (infected) cows in the herd should 
be available for inclusion in the trial.
<LI>D.	General herd/cow descriptive data should be submitted including total adult herd 
size, number of cows currently lactating, number and percentage of lactating cows 
sampled in the herd, number and percentage of lactating cows affected by infectious 
mastitis, approximate age of each cow, breed of each cow, current daily milk 
production, lactation number and stage of lactation.
<LI>E.	A pre-trial culture/sample survey is recommended for sub-clinical infectious 
mastitis studies.  It should include milk samples from all lactating quarters of all 
cows in a herd.  All infected quarters of cows in the herd should be available for 
inclusion in the study.

<LI>F.	The establishment of the efficacy of a combination product for the treatment of 
clinical mastitis should follow the current requirements for drug combinations.  
CVM strongly recommends that sponsors intending to develop combination 
products discuss data requirements as well as the merit of a particular drug 
combination before initiating studies.
<LI>G.	Any concurrent antibiotic or non-antibiotic therapy administered to study animals 
should be described together under a separate section, and reported in the NADA 
submission.  However, data from these animals should not be included in the 
sponsor's analysis of the data.
<LI>H.	Test animals should have no history of vaccination with products intended to cause 
or induce an immune-mediated anti-mastitis response.  Such products include but 
are not limited to vaccines, bacterins, immunomodulators, serum antibodies, or 
antitoxins.
<LI>I.	Herds participating in a clinical study must have a sufficient number of clinical 
mastitis cases to fill an adequate number of blocks.  The number of herds and the 
number of blocks in each herd should be specified prior to initiating the study to 
avoid potential problems with sequential testing.
<LI>J.	The study should be blinded and the details of the blinding method used should be 
provided.
</UL>
<H3><A NAME="iii">III.	CLINICAL FIELD TRIALS</A></H3>
<UL>
<LI>A.	DOSE DETERMINATION will be based on a control and at least three non-zero drug 
levels consisting of a less effective lower dose and a higher dose that is no more 
effective than the dose selected for field trials in cows with clinical mastitis.  These 
trials should be designed to define the target dose.  Where dose determination trials 
do not clearly demonstrate a target dose, it may be appropriate for the sponsor to 
repeat the trial with different doses or to take more than one dose into field 
confirmation studies.<BR>
Dose determination should be conducted in at least two geographic locations by at 
least two different investigators, where the investigator is defined as that individual 
receiving the drug shipment and supervising the trial.  These trials should involve a 
minimum of six herds.  The selection of geographic locations should be discussed 
with CVM prior to initiation of trials.  Quarters of individual cows should be treated 
with a single drug dose level.<BR>
In some cases, an appropriate experimentally induced mastitis infection (a model 
infection) could be used for dose determination.  This option should be discussed 
with CVM prior to initiation of dose determination trials.
<LI>B.	DOSE CONFIRMATION will be based on an appropriate dose selected from the dose 
determination studies.  These studies must contain a control (preferably negative) 
group.<BR>
Dose confirmation studies should be conducted in at least two different geographic 
(climatologic) locations. Each location should utilize a different investigator, where 
an investigator is defined as that individual receiving the drug shipment and 
supervising the trial.  These trials should involve a minimum of six herds.  The 
sponsor has the responsibility to provide an adequate number of cows to 
demonstrate the claimed treatment response.  Quarters of an individual cow should 
be treated with a single drug for which a claim is sought.<BR>
If a sponsor is considering a positively-controlled study, the sponsor should provide 
a basis for the need to have a positively-controlled study and discuss it with CVM 
prior to initiating the study.

<LI>C.	The PIVOTAL PARAMETERS for the effectiveness of the drug product are the
results of clinical response and bacteriological cultures.  Investigators
should refer to <I>Microbiological Procedures for the Diagnosis of Bovine
Mastitis</I>, National Mastitis Council (NMC) 1990.<P><OL>
<LI>	<I>Lactating Cow Claim for Clinical Infectious Mastitis</I><P>
<B>ENROLLMENT IN STUDY</B>
<UL>
<LI>a.	The experimental unit will be the lactating dairy cow with clinical
mastitis.  Only cows with a single quarter with clinical mastitis will be
enrolled.  CVM will use this single quarter data base to infer efficacy to all
cows with mastitis in 1 or more quarters.
<LI>b.	Cows with a diagnosis of clinical mastitis (visually abnormal milk with
clots, flakes, watery appearance, and/or udder clinical signs with swelling,
redness, and soreness) will be needed for enrollment in the study.  Diagnosis
of clinical mastitis should be made at the time of sampling by the
investigator, but at all other times may be assessed by farm personnel.
</UL><P>
<B>PRE-TREATMENT SAMPLING <I>(Investigators should screen herds in advance
of the pre-treatment samplings to encourage equal distribution of pathogens
among treatment groups.)</I></B>
<UL>
<LI>a.	Prior to treatment, single milk samples for microbiologic and
quantitative somatic cell count (QSCC) will be obtained.  The minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) and MIC breakpoint for the isolated mastitis
pathogens will be determined by using the National Committee for Clinical
Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) to evaluate the susceptibility of the organisms to
the new antimicrobial product.
<LI>b.	Milk from each enrolled quarter should be examined at the time of
sampling for signs of CLINICAL mastitis (abnormal milk with clots, flakes or
watery appearance).  Positive findings should be recorded on barn data record
forms and pooled with data from daily examinations at each milking.
</UL><P>
<B>TREATMENT</B>
<BR>
Only the single affected quarter will be treated.  Any cow developing
mastitis in additional quarters during her enrollment will be dropped from the
study and not considered a failure.  Cows requiring and/or receiving treatment
in an additional mastitic quarter will be excluded from consideration of
efficacy, but daily observations should continue.  Control group options
include:  pretrial, approved positive control drug treatment; milking every 3
or 4 hours; or delayed treatment.<P>
 <B>POST-TREATMENT SAMPLING</B><BR>
 A minimum of two single microbiology test samples will be obtained at least
 5 days apart during the assessment period (14 to 28 days post-treatment).
Two single QSCC samples will be obtained at the same time.
<P><B>ASSESSMENT OF CURE</B>  
<UL>
<LI>a.	Cure will be assessed between 14 and 28 days post-treatment based
on negative control study design.
<LI>b.	Clinically, a cured quarter must have normal milk and no clinical signs
of mastitis in that quarter (See C.1.b., above).
<LI>c.	Microbiologically, the mastitis pathogen isolated in the pre-treatment
sample must be absent from two post-treatment test samples.  If no
pre-treatment pathogen is isolated, the post-treatment sample must culture
negative.
<LI>d.	QSCC will not be used in the determination of cure for the individual
cow.
<LI>e.	QSCC results will only be used as a check of the numerical trend between
the means of QSCC for "cured" and "not-cured" cows within each treatment group
to determine if other studies are needed for inflammation and safety.
<LI>f.	Only clinical cases of mastitis in which a mastitis pathogen (reference
list to be determined) is isolated in the pre-treatment sample will be used to
calculate cure rate.  It will be necessary to submit to FDA/CVM the pre- and
post-treatment bacteriological culture data with the MIC profile from those
cows that were initially enrolled in the study but subsequently cultured
negative on the pre-treatment sample.
<LI>g.	The distribution of mastitis pathogens from the clinical study will be
utilized to determine the label efficacy statement.  An example for an
effective antibiotic for staphylococcal and streptococcal mastitis pathogens
will be: "Effective for the treatment of clinical mastitis caused by
<I>Staphylococcus</I> species such as <I>Staphylococcus</I> <I>aureus</I>, and
<I>Streptococcus</I> species such as <I>Streptococcus</I> <I>agalactiae</I>,
<I>Streptococcus</I> <I>dysgalactiae</I> and <I>Streptococcus uberis</I>." 
</UL><P>
<LI><I>Lactating Cow Claim for Sub-clinical Infectious Mastitis</I><P>
<B>ENROLLMENT IN STUDY</B>
<UL>
<LI>a.	All new anti-microbial products for mastitis in the lactating
dairy cow must show efficacy for clinical mastitis.  No new product will be
approved solely on the basis of sub-clinical data as in the old guidelines.
<LI>b.	To obtain a sub-clinical indication, additional sub-clinical data will
be required.  With acceptable clinical mastitis efficacy results, the
subsequent sub-clinical mastitis study will require that the new therapy
demonstrate efficacy but at a lower probability level (e.g., p&lt;0.10).  Fewer
cows may be necessary for the sub-clinical study since elimination of the
pre-treatment pathogen is required in the clinical study.  Sub-clinical
trial(s) will select cows with a positive quarter, thus fewer cows may be
needed.
</UL> <P>
<B>PRE-TREATMENT SAMPLING <I>(Investigators should screen herds in advance
of the pre-treatment samplings to encourage equal distribution of pathogens
among treatment groups.)</I></B>
<BR>
 The sub-clinical study will be a randomized study.  Prior to
treatment, two single microbiology and QSCC samples will be obtained at a
24-hour interval (Note:  Investigators should screen herds in advance of the
pre-treatment sampling to encourage equal distribution of pathogens among
treatment groups).<P>
  <B>TREATMENT</B>
<BR>In the sub-clinical study, only one quarter from any cow will be
treated.  For cows infected in multiple quarters, the quarter to be treated
will be randomly selected.  The other quarters will not be treated.  If
additional quarters of clinical mastitis require additional treatment, the cow
will be ineligible for inclusion in the study.
<P>
<B>POST-TREATMENT SAMPLING</B>
<BR>
At 14 to 28 days post-treatment, two single microbiology and QSCC
samples will be obtained at least 5 days apart.<P>
<B>ASSESSMENT OF CURE</B>
<UL>
<LI>a.	Cure will be assessed between 14 and 28 days post-treatment based
on negative control study design.  QSCC results will be used similarly in
sub-clinical studies as for clinical studies to detect changes and perhaps
indicate possible safety problems.
<LI>b.	Microbiologically, the mastitis pathogen isolated in the pre-treatment
samples must be absent from two post-treatment test samples.
<LI>c.	Products with acceptable efficacy data from both clinical and
sub-clinical studies will receive an indication similar to the following:
"Effective for the treatment of clinical and sub-clinical mastitis caused by
<I>Staphylococcus</I> species such as <I>Staphylococcus</I> <I>aureus</I>, and
<I>Streptococcus</I> species such as <I>Streptococcus</I> <I>agalactiae</I>,
<I>Streptococcus</I> <I>dysgalactiae</I> and <I>Streptococcus uberis</I>."
</UL><P>
<LI>	<I>Non-Lactating Cow Claim for Sub-Clinical Infectious Mastitis</I><P>
 Separate studies will be necessary to obtain a treatment and prevention
claim for products intended for use in dry cow therapy.  Treatment would mean
the elimination of infections which exist at the time of dry cow therapy.
Prevention would mean the "protection" from establishment of new infection
during the dry cow period.
<BR>For the prevention claim, it will be necessary to establish, through a
negatively-controlled group, the rate of new infection (estimates are
approximately 2 to  3 percent).<P>

<B>ENROLLMENT IN STUDY</B><BR>
 Cows in late lactation period with decreased milk production and
ready for drying off should be enrolled in the study.
<P>
<B>PRE-TREATMENT SAMPLING</B>
<UL>
<LI>a.	Investigators should collect two single milk samples at least 24
hours apart from each quarter for bacteriological culture, with the second
sample taken on the expected day of drying off.
<LI>b.	A QSCC should be determined for each quarter, from one of the
pre-treatment milk samples.
</UL><P>
<B>TREATMENT</B>
For both treatment and prevention claims, all quarters should be treated
after the second milk sample is collected.
<P>
<B>POST-TREATMENT SAMPLING</B>
<UL>
<LI>a.	For both treatment and prevention claims for dry cow therapy, two
single milk samples for bacteriological culture should be collected from each

IV.	DATA PRESENTATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
</A></H3>
For each organism for which a claim is sought, the cure rate data should be
sorted, summarized, and submitted by herd for each investigator.  Due to the
large variation between herds in treatment response and organism prevalence,
the statistical analysis should be conducted using statistical methods for
discrete data that account for the differences due to herds and investigators.
The specific statistical analysis used should be proposed and agreed to during
protocol development.  If herd and investigator differences are not accounted
for in the statistical analysis, the true treatment effect can be confounded
with the treatment response and sample size differences in the various herds
tested.  Although the herds and investigators are a random effect and should be
analyzed as such, many of the available statistical software packages do not
facilitate such an analysis.  Therefore, until appropriate methods become
generally available and accepted, it is permissible to consider algorithms that
treat herds and investigators as fixed effects for the statistical analysis of
these data.

<i>FREEDOM OF INFORMATION SUMMARY GUIDELINES</i><P>
<ul>
<li>A.  <i><A NAME="pog">Purpose of Guidelines</A></i><P>
The Freedom of Information (FOI) Summary Guidelines are designed to assist
New Animal Drug Application (NADA) sponsors in preparing an "FOI Summary" and
to assist the Center For Veterinary Medicine (CVM) in reviewing the Summaries
and preparing the Agency Conclusions sections.<P>
<li>B.  <i><A NAME="rsed">Release of Safety and Effectiveness Data:</A></i><P>
When approval of an original or supplemental NADA is published in the
<i>Federal Register, </i>a summary of the safety and effectiveness information
submitted to support the . approval of the application is publicly released by
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in accordance with 21CFR section
514.11(e). This regulation states that CVM may prepare its own summary or may
require the NADA sponsor to prepare one. The Center has elected to have the
NADA sponsor prepare the summary.<P>
<li>C. <i><A NAME="gc">General Considerations:</A></i><P>
Since the intent of the FOI Act is to inform the public at large, the FOI
Summary must be written clearly and, as much as possible, in language that the
average person can understand. However, this does not mean that scientific
accuracy or detail should be sacrificed, nor does it preclude the use of
medical or scientific terms.<P>
The summary shall provide safety and effectiveness data and other
information in sufficient detail to show the basis on which the agency approved
the NADA or supplement. As shown in the outline below, greater detail is
required for <i>pivotal </i>studies (those essential to a decision to approve)
than for <i>corroborative </i>studies (those which form a portion of the basis
for approval, but which are not, by themselves, essential to the decision to
approve). Studies submitted, but not relied on (as either pivotal or
corroborative).for the approval, need not be mentioned or described. However,
the Summary shall describe the well-controlled studies on which approval was
based including studies showing negative results. Results should be reported
for all treatment groups, except those. not contributing pertinent information
(positive or negative): to the label claims. <P>

An omission or deviation in the "data package," from what is
normally required for the type of drug being approved, should be noted and
explained by the sponsor if the reason for the difference is based on science.
If the difference is due to a policy decision or an applicable guideline, the
agency will explain the reason(s) for the difference in the Agency Conclusions
section.<P>
In the outline below, the Center has attempted to cover each significant
item that should be included in the Summary. Because of the dynamic nature of
the approval process, however, it will be necessary to exercise judgment with
respect to the presentation of data and information not specifically addressed
by the outline, but which are significant in the approval of the application.
In contrast, there will be circumstances in which it will be unproductive or
unnecessary to provide all of the information listed in the outline. For
example, if tests which were collateral to the objectives were conducted during
trials the results need not be summarized in the detail needed for tests on
which the drug's safety or effectiveness is being judged. The overriding guide,
therefore, should be the intent of the Freedom of Information Act as applied to
NADA approvals: to inform the public of the basis for the agency's approval of
an NADA in language that a lay person can understand.<P>
An exception to these general considerations is the use of published
literature as a portion of the safety or effectiveness data. If a study forming
a portion of the basis of approval is published in a generally available
English language publication, the FOI summary need include only a citation and
abstract. For studies published in a publication which is not readily
available, or is in a foreign language, the F0I Summary should contain a
detailed summary as described by these guidelines.<P>
<li><i><A NAME="appr">D. Approvals Requiring an FOI Summary:</A></i><P>
<ul>
<li>1.  <i>NADAs. </i>21 CFR 514.11(e) requires release of the FOI
Summary after publication of an approval in the <i>Federal Register. </i>A
Summary is required for all NADAs, including generic -(e.g., NAS/NRC) approvals
and NADAs supported by reference to data in previously approved NADAs.
<P>
<li>2.  <i>Supplements. </i>An FOI Summary is required for each supplemental
application that affects safety and/or effectiveness. The Summary need
encompass only the data submitted with the supplement, unless review of data in
the original NADA is required for approval of the supplement. In this case,
except as provided by Section 
E, the Summary must encompass the data contained in the supplement and the
safety and effectiveness data that was required to be reviewed from the
original NADA.</ul><P>
<li>E.  <i><A NAME="crs">Cross-References:</A></i><P>
If an application (NADA or supplement) requires a Summary, but a Summary
has been previously prepared that the Center believes is adequate,
cross-reference to the earlier Summary will be acceptable for applicable
portions of the new Summary.<P>
<li>F.  <i><A NAME="rev">Revision of FOI Summaries and Exemptions From Disclosure:</A></i><P>
<ul>
<li>1.  <i>Introduction</i><P>
A summary may be inadequate because it is not clearly written in terms that
an average person can understand, because it does not provide a sufficiently
detailed summary of the safety and effectiveness data, or for other reasons.
When an NADA sponsor submits a draft FOI Summary that the Center concludes is
inadequate, the Center may revise the Summary or, more likely, the Center will
advise the sponsor of the specific deficiencies and ask the sponsor to submit a
revised summary.<P>
<li>2.  <i>Exemption From Disclosure</i><P>
The names of private owners of animals used in studies, to determine
effectiveness, are ordinarily considered to be confidential and are not
required to be included in the FOI summary. The same rule applies to individual
identification of animals that could lead to identification of the owner, or
that for some other reason would be subject to claims of confidentiality. An
example of the latter is the name of a thoroughbred horse. Although data for
individual animals are ordinarily not required in the FOI summary, when such
data are appropriately presented care should be taken to avoid inadvertent
identification of the owner.<P>
Under-the FOI Act, trade secrets and confidential commercial information
are exempt from disclosure. In addition, the' disclosure of trade secrets
submitted to FDA is prohibited by 21 U.S.C. 331(j) and 18 U.S.C. 1905. Whether
information is exempt from disclosure as a trade secret or confidential 
commercial information must be determined on a case-by-case<br>
basis. The Center will use the following procedure to ensure that such
information is not inadvertently released without a sponsor's
knowledge:<P>
<ul>
<li>a. The Center will assume that the sponsor waives any confidentiality
objection with respect to material in the sponsor's draft, and to material
added in a revised draft written by the sponsor at the Center's
request.<P>
<li>b. If the Center makes substantive revisions to an FOI Summary, it will
request the sponsor's concurrence in those revisions. If the sponsor does not
concur, or if the Center asks the sponsor to include certain information and
the sponsor declines to do so on the basis of confidentiality, a representative
of the Center will consult verbally with the sponsor to attempt to resolve the
dispute. The Center employee will prepare a memorandum summarizing such
discussions.<P>
<li>c. If the dispute cannot be resolved on an informal basis, the sponsor must
provide in writing a specific basis for its objection. The sponsor must
adequately justify its objection to disclosure by providing specific reasons
applicable to the particular information in question.<P>
<li>d. The Center may accept the sponsor's explanation. If it does not, the
Center Director or Deputy Director, with the concurrence of the Office of
General Counsel, will formally notify the sponsor in writing that the Center
intends to include the disputed information and that, pursuant to 21CFR 20.46,
the sponsor has five days in which to sue the agency to enjoin the disclosure.
The letter will state why the Center does not agree with the sponsor's
views.<P>
<li>e. If suit is initiated, the FOI Summary will consist of all undisputed
information, together with a notation 
that litigation is pending to resolve the releasability of certain
additional information.<P>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>G.  <i><A NAME="subr">Submission Requirements:</A></i><P>
The sponsor should submit, as part of the NADA or supplement, an original
and three copies of the Summary, typed on plain white bond paper and
unsigned.<P>
<li><i><A NAME="pubd">H. Public Display of Documents by the Center:</A> </i><P>
The FOI Summary, together with the approved labeling and required
environmental documents (e.g., an Environmental Impact Analysis Report,
Environmental Assessment, or 
Environmental Impact Statement), will be placed on' public display with the
Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration at the time
the approval of the NADA is forwarded for publication in the <i>Federal
Register.</i><P>
<li>I.  <i><A NAME="fois">FOI Summary Outline</A></i><P>
<ul>
<li>1. <i><A NAME="geni">General Information:</A></i><P>
NADA Number:<P>
Sponsor (name and address):<P>
Generic Name:<P>
Trade Name:<P>
Marketing Status: Rx or OTC<P>
Effect of Supplement: If the application is a supplement, include a concise
statement explaining how the supplement modifies or changes the NADA.<P>
<li>2.  <i><A NAME="indc">Indications for Use</A>: </i>Indications ordinarily should be quoted
verbatim from the labeling. If the description of the indications is lengthy,
however, reference to the attached labeling is acceptable. <i>Do not
paraphrase.</i><P>
<li>3. <i><A NAME="dose">Dosage Form(s)</A>, Route(s) of Administration, and
Recommended Dosage(s):</i><P>

This section of the Summary should discuss each adequate and
well-controlled investigation separately, except that where data from two or
more separate investigations are pooled for analytical purposes, either of the
following may be applicable: (a) the results of the individual investigations
and the pooled results should be summarized and statistical analysis of the
pooled results should be reported, or (b), if the results of the investigations
are not individually considered in the approval decision, the pooled results
should be summarized and statistical-, analysis of the pooled results reported,
but the results of the individual investigations need not be summarized. In
case (b), however, the data will ordinarily be considered as constituting only
one "adequate and well-controlled" study. Where the scientific and statistical
justification for the pooling of data is not apparent from the description of
the design of the study, a brief justification should be given.<P>
The discussion should be descriptive and definitive, and the basis for
conclusions should be explained.<P>
<ul>
<li>a.  Pivotal Studies (Pivotal studies are those essential to the decision to approve the NADA.) The following information should be provided for each
pivotal study:<P>

<ul>
<li>(1) If a historical control is used, its use should be explained in terms
of 514.111(a)(5)(ii)(a)(4)(iv). When animals are used as their own controls,
the Summary should briefly explain why the use of the animals as their own
controls is acceptable in terms of  514.111(a)(5)(ii)(a)(2)(iii) and
explain which of the following treatments was administered, in the control
phase, to animals designated as self control animals: no treatment,
placebo treatment, or another drug (active treatment control).<P>

<li>(2) If active treatment control is used, and the control drug is a
new animal drug that is not the subject of a currently approved NADA for the
use in question, the reason why the drug is an appropriate control drug should
be explained.<P>
</ul>
<li>d) Diagnosis. Describe method(s) utilized.<P>

<li>e) Dosage form:<P><ul>
<li>(1) Tablets, capsules, injectable, etc.<P>
<li>(2) If the formulation used in the study is not same as the formulation to

fully described. If no adverse reactions were observed, a statement to that
effect should be included.<P>
<li>8)  Special issues:<P>
<ul>
 <li>a) Waivers (The waiver provisions apply only to field
investigations.) If, in accordance with the provisions of
514.111(a)(5)(ii)(a)(6), a waiver of any or all of the criteria defining
"adequate and well-controlled investigations" in 514.111(a){5)(ii) is sought
with respect to a specific clinical {field) investigation, a paragraph should
be included stating:<P>
<ul>
<li>(1) The specific provisions in the criteria from which the waiver is being
sought.<P>
<li> (2) Why the criteria are not reasonably applicable to the particular
clinical investigation.<P>
<li>(3) What alternative procedures, if any, have been employed.<P>
<li>(4) Results of the investigation.<P>

<li>(5) The basis upon which it can be concluded that the clinical
investigation has yielded substantial evidence of effectiveness.<P>
<li>(6) Citations of literature relied on to help support the waiver.<P>
 </ul>
<li> b) Combination drugs. If the application pertains to a combination
drug, the Summary should explain how the product complies with the combination
drug policy stated in 21CFR 514.1(b){8)(v) and the Center's combination drug
guidelines. Deviations from significant provisions of the guidelines should be
explained.<P>
 
<li> c) NAS/NRC drugs. If effectiveness is asserted on the basis of
equivalence to a drug that was subject of a National Academy of
Sciences/National Research Council review, any bioequivalence data presented
should be summarized. The FOI Summary should cite pertinent regulations and
<i>Federal Register </i>documents.<P>

that must be met to be within the scope of the Pipeline Policy.<P>
<li>d. Combination Drugs for Food Animals:<P>
If the NADA is for a combination of previously  approved drugs, this
section should contain a statement that each drug in the combination has
depleted to its safe concentration by the proposed withdrawal time and that the
drugs in the combination do not interfere with the regulatory assays for each
drug.<P>
<li>e. Generic Approvals<P>
If the subject NADA is approvable under the Agency's guidelines and
procedures for evaluating generic equivalent applications, the basis for this
classification should be stated.<P>
<li>f. Rx/OTC Status:<P>
This section is applicable to all original NADAs (except DESI NADAs), and
to all supplements for a new species or requesting change in the Rx/OTC
status.<P>
This section will include a brief statement explaining why a drug is to be
categorized as either Rx or OTC. The explanation should not be comprised
exclusively of a conclusion, e.g., "adequate directions can/cannot be written."
If a product is to be Rx, this section should list each substantial reason why
adequate directions for laymen's use cannot be written. If the drug is to be
OTC, explanations given should anticipate any substantial question that might
be raised as to why the product is categorized as OTC, e.g., why a layman may

<h3>GUIDELINE 13</H3>
<H3>GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATION OF 
 EFFECTIVENESS OF NEW ANIMAL DRUGS 
 FOR USE IN FREE-CHOICE FEEDS</H3>

(January 1985)<br>
<br>
<br>
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES<br>
PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE<br>
FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION<br>
CENTER FOR VETERINARY MEDICINE<p>
<b>Background:</b><p>

This guideline is a revision of <b>The Cattle Medicated Block
Guideline</b>.  It is applicable to all free-choice feeds that may contain new
animal drugs.  The variant pattern of consumption of free-choice feeds (blocks,
loose minerals, and liquid feeds) by ruminants (cattle and sheep) is well
known.  Intake enticement and control are necessary to provide a relatively
steady quantity (amount and frequency) of medicated feed consumption.
<p>
When a drug is added to a free-choice feed, it is important that the target
animal consumes enough of the drug for the drug to be effective, but does not
consume an excessive amount of drug which might cause toxicity or violative
drug residues.  Since there is a large variation in consumption of free-choice
feed, both intake control and effectiveness of the drug must be demonstrated
when the drug is consumed on an irregular basis.
<p>
Feed composition (i.e., levels of salt, molasses, minerals or protein),
physical form, and in some cases, drug content, regulate consumption and
consequently dosage of a drug.  Therefore, any change in feed composition,
physical form, or drug content will require a supplemental approval of the
specific free-choice feed.
<p>
New animal drugs must have been shown to be safe to the target animal, and
edible products from treated animals must have been shown to be safe for humans
before they can be considered under these guidelines.  Though not a
requirement, new animal drugs are normally approved for continuous use (e.g.,
feedlot) before they are approved for use in free-choice feeds.  Thus,
historical data are usually available for review before drugs are to be used in
free-choice feeds.  In the event there are no historical data on such a new
animal drug, all aspects of Form FD 356 apply in developing the approval
application.
<p>
<b>Purpose:</b><p>

The purpose of these guidelines is to assist drug and/or feed
manufacturers in the development of data necessary for approval to market new
animal drugs in free-choice feeds.  These guidelines reflect current knowledge
and are subject to revisions to accommodate new information and provide for
circumstances now unforeseen.<P>
<b>Scope</b>:<P>

The guidelines are intended to:<ol>

<li>    Assist in developing information and data needed to support Agency approval
for the addition of production type new animal drugs to free-choice feeds.

<li>    Clarify approval procedures for adding production type new animal drugs to
free-choice feeds.</ol>
<p>
<b>Efficacy Requirements and Data Analysis</b>:
<p>
To determine the range of effectiveness of a drug in free-choice feeds,
hand-fed pasture studies are recommended.  Data should be collected for each
claim/production class.  These data may be collected in conventional pasture
studies or in drylot studies (restricted to feed efficiency claims) where fresh
pasture clippings and/or other feed are transported to the animals.  The data
are to represent three geographical locations in which the medicated
free-choice feed will be marketed.  Ideally, these studies should be designed
to determine the dose-response characteristics of the drug including the
"Effectiveness Range," "Plateau," and the "Depression of Production Parameter"
areas as described in the following graph.<p>
<IMG SRC="guide13.gif" ALT="efficacy requirements and data analysis graph" ALIGN=TOP><p>
The "Effectiveness Range" is the levels of drug which give an increasing
production response with increasing dosage.  The "Plateau" is the part of the
response curve beyond the "Effectiveness Range" that does not result in a
change in production when the drug level is increased.  The "Depression in
Production Parameter" portion of the curve is beyond the "Plateau" and
represents the area where a reduction in effectiveness occurs with an increase
in dose.
<p>
The minimum data that must be available from the dose-response studies (hand
feeding) are a description of the "Effectiveness Range."  However, if
available, the additional data dealing with the "Plateau" and "Depression of
Production Parameter" will be useful to facilitate the decision-making process
described in the next two sections of this guideline.  For the purpose of this
guideline, when the "Depression of Production Parameter" portion of the curve
has not been determined, any drug level consumed above the highest level tested
will be considered to be in the "Depression of Production Parameter" area of
the dose-response curve.  If the sponsor of the hand-feeding data desires an
NADA approval for hand feeding the drug to pastured animals, all aspects of
Form FD 356 apply in developing the new animal drug application.  Reference is
made to the "Research Model," "Definitions," and "Administrative Procedures"
sections below.
<p>
Once the dose-response data are available, a sponsor of a medicated free-choice
feed may obtain approval through either of the following approaches.  The
application for approval for each medicated free-choice feed must contain both
efficacy and consumption data.  Efficacy data may be collected for each
medicated free-choice feed as described in "Approach I."  The data must be
specific for that particular approval.  Alternately, efficacy data may come
from a general medicated free-choice approval and be universally applicable as
described in "Approach II."
<p>
<b>Approach I:</b>
<p>
A manufacturer may choose to pursue approval of a medicated free-choice
feed for which free-choice efficacy data have not been collected.  If
dose-response data as described above are available, the feed manufacturer may
collect efficacy and consumption data in at least one location and consumption
data at a minimum of two additional locations within the proposed market area.
The efficacy study must be sufficiently replicated to show the drug to be
repeatedly effective in the free-choice feed.  The consumption studies should
approximate as close as 
possible the efficacy studies in number of animals, replications, duration, and
Coefficients of Variation (CVs) are to be determined for both the efficacy
study and the two consumption studies.  If there are significant consumption
differences among the locations and if the mean consumption for any location
falls above the "Plateau" or below the minimum effective level (lowest point on
the "Effectiveness Range"), the medicated free-choice feed is not approvable.
The CVs of the consumption studies must be equal to or less than the CV of the
efficacy study.  The data generated in these studies apply only to the
claim/production class and ruminant species involved, and these data may not be
used to generate approval for any other free-choice feed.  Reference is made to
the "Research Model," "Definitions," and "Administrative Procedures" sections
below.
<p>
<b>Approach  II</b>:
<p>
Using the "Effectiveness Range" for the drug obtained in the hand-fed pasture
studies, the drug will be tested in a free-choice feed (block, loose mineral,
or liquid feed).  Three studies in three geographical locations are to be
conducted to determine drug efficacy and drug consumption in an appropriate
free-choice environment.
<p>
It is important that the average drug consumption for the studies be within the
"Effectiveness Range."  The consumption data and the efficacy data are to be
analyzed and a CV for the pooled studies determined for the treatment
consumption data.  This CV is a measure of random differences among the

weekly observation periods after appropriate adjustments have been made for
time, location, replicates, and animal numbers.  It is important also to note
that this CV will be determined only from those animals that consumed the
medicated free-choice feed.  The sponsor of these studies must request and
obtain an approval to market the tested medicated free-choice feed.  A
regulation concerning use of the medicated feed must be published.  These data
may be referenced to support approval of an unlimited number of medicated
free-choice feed applications for the specific claim/animal class if used in
conjunction with appropriate consumption data as described below.
<p>
All other medicated free-choice feed manufacturers must simply collect
consumption data under the conditions of the previously described
efficacy/consumption studies.  At least three studies 
are required, and they should represent the proposed market area of the
medicated free-choice feed.  A minimum of three replicates at each location
should be used, and the design need not have unmedicated control groups.
However, the consumption studies should approximate as close as possible the
studies used to establish efficacy in terms of number of animals, replications,
and duration; or the estimate of the CV obtained from these consumption studies
must be adjusted for differences in design from the efficacy studies,
particularly in numbers of animals, to make the two CVs comparable.  It is
important that the average drug consumption for the study be within the
"Effectiveness Range."  An appropriate pooled CV as described above is to be
calculated for these consumption data.  If there are significant consumption
differences among the locations and if the mean consumption for any location
falls above the "Plateau" or below the minimum effective level (lowest point on
the "Effectiveness Range"), the medicated free-choice feed is not
approvable.
<p>
The two CVs from the two groups of studies will be compared to determine if the
data from the consumption studies are similar to the consumption data obtained
in the efficacy trials.  The CV of the consumption studies must be equal to or
less than the CV of the consumption studies must be equal to or less than the
CV for the efficacy studies.
<p>
Reference is made to the "Research Model," "Definitions," and "Administrative
Procedures" sections below.  All aspects of Form FD 356 apply in developing an
application associated with the consumption data.  Additionally, all aspects of
Medicated Feed Application (FD 2800) apply.
<p>
<b>Administrative Procedures:</b><p>

<b>Background</b>:  Depending on the amount of cooperation between the
drug sponsor and the manufacturer of the free-choice feed, the collection of
data needed for approval of an NADA involving a medicated free-choice feed may
take either of the above approaches.  Either the sponsor or manufacturer may
generate any component of the data needed for a medicated free-choice approval;
however, it is probable under "Approach II" that the hand-feeding and
free-choice feed efficacy studies will be collected by the drug sponsor, while
the consumption data is collected by the free-choice feed manufacturer.
<p>
Regardless of the data collection process employed, Agency approval will be for
either an original NADA or a supplemental NADA.  The data generated under the
hand-feeding studies and under 
the efficacy studies with a medicated free-choice feed should result in NADA
approvals for the applications(s) sponsor.  The hand-feeding studies would
provide for the use of the drug in hand-fed pasture situations, and the
medicated free-choice feed efficacy data would provide for the use of the drug
in the specific free-choice product for the claim/production class.
<p>
<b>Process</b>:  To obtain approval to market a specific medicated
free-choice feed, the applicant may use either of the following administrative
approaches:<ol>

<li>    File an NADA which contains dose-response data along with free-choice feed
efficacy data and consumption data as described in "Approach II" plus
information to satisfy all other parts of the Form FD 356.

<li>    File an NADA which contains dose-response data along with efficacy and
consumption data as described in "Approach I" plus information to satisfy all
other parts of the Form FD 356.

<li>    File a medicated feed application (FD 1800) to manufacture an approved
specific medicated free-choice feed whose formula has been published in the
FEDERAL REGISTER.

<li>    Establish a Master File which contains consumption data as described in
"Approach II" or the efficacy and consumption data as described in "Approach I"
and which contains appropriate manufacturing and stability data as described in
the Form FD 356.  The sponsor of the Master File must authorize the Agency to
reference the data in its Master File to support approval of a supplemental
NADA (submitted by a drug sponsor who has generated the appropriate
dose-response data and has generated efficacy data as described in "Approach
II."  The drug sponsor must request permission to market a medicated
free-choice feed for the claim/production class used in the conduct of
consumption and/or efficacy data.  Approval of the supplement will not be
published in the FEDERAL REGISTER because the approval will not affect or alter
the content of the regulation.  The approval will provide a basis for the
medicated free-choice feed manufacturer to submit for Agency approval a
medicated feed application (FD 1800) under section 512(m) of the act.

<li>    Establish a master file which contains the efficacy and consumption data as
described in "Approach I" and which contains appropriate manufacturing and
stability data as described 

    in the Form FD 356.  The sponsor of the master file must authorize the Agency
to reference the data in its master file to support approval of a supplemental
NADA.  The drug sponsor must request permission to market a medicated
free-choice feed for the claim/production class used in the conduct of the
consumption and efficacy data.  Approval of the supplement will be published in
the FEDERAL REGISTER and will provide a basis for a specific medicated
free-choice feed manufacturer to submit for Agency approval a medicated feed
application (FD 1800) under section 512(m) of the act for the tested
formulation.</ol>
<p>
<b>Research Model:</b><ol>

supplemental feed.  Treatment and control animals must receive similar
supplemental feed.

<li>    <b>Medication</b>:  Records must be made on all medical treatment received
by the animal.

<li>    <b>Death</b>:  The cause of death for all animals in the study should be
determined by necropsy.

<li><b>Drug Consumption</b>:  Medicated free-choice feed must be available at
all times and consumption determined weekly (each seven days) with feed
weighbacks (orts) adjusted for environmental losses (item 7 above).

<li>    <b>Pasture Conditions</b>:  The amount, quality, and type of feed available

<h3>Guideline 37</h3>
<h3>GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS OF NEW ANIMAL DRUGS FOR USE IN POULTRY
FEEDS FOR PIGMENTATION</H3>
Prepared by:<br>
Center for Veterinary Medicine<br>
Food and Drug Administration<br>

March, 1984<br>
<br>
Guidelines for Evaluation of Effectiveness of New Animal Drugs for Use in
Poultry Feeds for Pigmentation<br>
<p>
These guidelines are the Center for Veterinary Medicine's (CVM) interpretation
of new animal drug regulations in Part 514 (21 CFR Part 514) as regards the
efficacy data requirements for pigmentation claims for poultry drugs. These
guidelines supersede the 1975 Preclearance Guidelines for Production Drugs as
they relate to pigmentation uses.<br>
<p>
I.  Background on the Pigmentation Mechanism and Sources of Pigment<br>
<p>
    Yellow corn, corn gluten meal, aztec marigold meal, alfalfa leaf meal,
bermuda grass meal, algae meal, and possibly other green leaf meals are
used in formulating broiler rations to enhance the yellow color of the
broiler chicken carcass and in laying hen rations to enhance the yellow
color of the egg yolk. The yellow color of the carcass and yolk is a    result
of xanthophyll and associated carotenoids in the feed being absorbed
through the intestine, metabolized, and deposited in the skin   and fat of
the bird, or in egg yolk.
<p>
    Under normal storage conditions for some of these feed ingredients, the
xanthophylls and carotenoids are not very stable. The stability of
xanthophylls has been enhanced by the manufacture of a liquid product   which
is made by extracting the xanthophyll from natural sources. The stabilized
liquid product is then added to the mixer when the complete feed is
manufactured, resulting in improved stability of the xanthophyll    level in
the complete feed.
<p>
    The concentration of xanthophyll and associated carotenoids in the
complete broiler feed is closely correlated to the intensity of the skin
color in broiler chickens. It is generally accepted by poultry
nutritionists that a concentration of 16 grams of xanthophyll per ton of
complete broiler feed is adequate to produce a broiler of medium to light
pigmentation. An unhealthy or diseased bird may appear pale and may not
deposit the pigments as efficiently as a healthy bird. Many industry
service men use skin color to aid in evaluating the health  condition of the
flock.
<p>
II. Color Additives<br>
<p>
Color additives as defined in Section 201(t) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act and 21 CFR 70.3(f), e.g., dried algae meal, Section 73.275(21 CFR
73.275), or Aztec marigold meal and extract, Section 73.295 (21 CFR 73.295),
must be approved under the color additive section of the regulations (21 CFR
71.1) before they can be legally marketed or used in the formulation of poultry
diets. This includes extracts of pigments from feed ingredients and other
sources of naturally occurring pigments, or synthetic pigments. This guideline
does not apply to color additive approval.

<p>
III. Rationale and Policy Statement<p>

    New animal drugs that increase rate of weight gain (or increase the rate
of egg production) and improve feed efficiency may also improve carcass
(skin/fat) and egg yolk pigmentation by enhancing xanthophyll   utilization.
Improved pigmentation is an effect closely associated with  the improved
feed efficiency and increased rate of weight gain claims    and is attributed
to improved absorption and subsequent deposition of the xanthophylls and
carotenoids in skin/fat and egg yolk. CVM   recommends the following wording
for the carcass pigmentation claim, "improved carcass pigmentation," and
the following wording for the egg   yolk pigmentation claim, "improved egg
yolk pigmentation."
<p>
    The pigmentation claim would normally be approved for the single drug
before it is approved in a drug combination.
<p>
A. Single Drugs
<P>
    (1) Carcass Pigmentation Claim
<P> 
        The pigmentation data may be collected from the same feeding 
        trials as  the growth and feed efficiency data. The three 
        production claims (1) increased rate of weight gain, (2) 
        improved feed efficiency, and (3) improved pigmentation are 
        closely associated effects which are measured independently.
 <P>
    (2) Egg Yolk Pigmentation Claim
 <P>
        Data requirements are similar to those for carcass 
        pigmentation. The protocol should indicate the frequency of
        egg yolk pigmentation scoring (e.g., whether one day/week, 
        one week/month, 10%/day, or some other sampling is proposed), 
        because 100% of the eggs produced would normally not need
        to be scored.
<P>
B.  Drug Combinations
<p>
    Data should demonstrate, in accordance with the current CVM "Guidelines
for Drug Combinations for Use in Animals," that the combination of two  or
more drugs (whether marketed as a combination drug premix or marketed   as
single drug premixes to be combined in complete medicated feeds) is
effective for improved carcass (or egg yolk) pigmentation claims. Under
those guidelines, the combination should be shown to be superior to one or
more of the component drugs (A statistically significant difference (P=.05)
should be demonstrated).
<p>

IV. Protocol Design and Data Requirements
<p>
Protocols should be submitted to Document Control Staff (HFV-16), Center for
Veterinary Medicine, Room 6B-45, Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers
Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857, for review before studies are begun.
<p>
The method of statistical analysis should be determined in advance, and
described in the protocol.
<p>
The same protocol design should be used for all trials so that data can be
tested for homogeneity and pooled (if tests so indicate) for statistical
evaluation.
<p>
Number of birds per replicate, number of replicates per treatment,
and number of times the experiment is repeated depend upon expected differences
and the ability to measure these differences. These matters should be discussed
with a statistician during protocol development and included in the
protocol.
<p>
The data should be collected from broiler (for carcass claims) or laying hen
(for yolk claims) feeding trials conducted in at least three geographical
locations from one day of age to market weight (7-8 weeks of age for broilers),
or in the case of laying hens, from sexual maturity to a period representative
of the egg production cycle.
<p>
The broiler feeding trials should be conducted in floor pens, starting with
day-old, apparently disease-free chicks. Floor space per chick should be the
same for all pens (at a single site), should be reported, and should simulate
actual use conditions. Litter conditions, equipment, and housing should
simulate actual use conditions, e.g., report whether clean litter or built-up
litter is used. Lighting conditions should be reported and should be equal
among treatments.
<p>
The laying hen feeding trials may be conducted in either floor pens or cages.
Experimental conditions should be described similarly as with broiler feeding
trials.
<p>
Diet formulas should include the percent of each feed ingredient, level of
added vitamins, minerals, xanthophyll, and drug. The basal diet should contain
normal levels of xanthophyll from natural sources. The diets should be analyzed
for xanthophyll and drug levels (for each mix or batch). The diets should meet
National Research Council requirements for nutrient composition. The raw data
should be submitted for all observations, weights, and evaluations. A complete
description of testing procedures and flock management should be provided.

<p>
    A. For Single Drugs:
<p>
    Treatments should be (a) control--no medication; and (b) only one   drug, at
one or more levels. If approval for a dose range is  requested, three
or more non-zero levels should be tested to adequately measure the
dose-response.
<P>
    B. For Drug Combinations:
<p>
    Treatments should be (a) control--anticoccidial in feed; and
    (b) control (anticoccidial) plus one or more additional drug(s) at one or
more levels. If more than one level, three or more  non-zero levels should
be tested to adequately measure the dose-response.
<p>
    For specific guidance in protocol design, refer to the current
    CVM "Guidelines for Drug Combinations for Use in Animals."
<p>
V.  Collecting the Pigmentation Data   
<p>
 A. Carcass Data
 <p>   Birds to be evaluated for pigmentation should be selected at the    beginning
of the study and identified by numbered wing bands. Double banding is
suggested, i.e., one band on each wing.
<p>
    A minimum of 20% of the birds from each replication, with   approximately
equal numbers of each sex, should be evaluated  for pigmentation. However,
if the 20% figure is less than six (6)  birds, an absolute minimum of three
males and three females should  be evaluated from each replication (or
pen).
<p>
    Carcass pigmentation data may be obtained by:
<p>
    (1) Visually scoring the degree of pigmentation in a specific 
        area of skin or shank by using a color chart or fan as the 
        standard;
<p>
    (2) Chemically extracting the pigment from a specified area of 
        skin, and using a spectrophotometer to determine the level of 
        xanthophyll; or
<p>
    (3) Employing a reflectance colorimeter (color eye) to determine 
        the color density in a specific area of skin.
<p>
    If a color fan (or chart) method is used and more than one observer scores
the birds, the scores should be reported by observers,  replication and
treatment. Each observer should score birds from    all treatments.
<p>
    A complete description of the method used, including a description  of the
lighting in the work area in which the scoring was made and how the samples
were prepared for scoring, should be submitted.
<p>
B. Egg Yolk Data
<p>
    Egg yolk pigmentation data may be obtained by (1) separating the    yolk from
albumen and individually scoring the yolk color with a  color fan or chart,
or (2) individually assaying colorimetrically   (Association of Official
Agricultural Chemists, 1970). A percentage  of eggs from each treatment
should be scored at scheduled intervals (daily, weekly, biweekly, or
monthly) throughout the egg production  cycle.
<p>
VI. Other Methods of Data Generation
<p>
    Protocols should be submitted to CVM for approval before collecting 
pigmentation data using methods other than those described in this 
Guideline. 
<p>
VII.    Literature References
<p>
    The following references provide good summaries of the available 
literature on broiler pigmentation.

<br>
Dated:	May 1990 <p>
<b>2. Indications for Use:</b><br>
<br>
Lincomycin hydrochloride, provided as Type A Medicated Articles in premix form
(Lincomix 50 and Lincomix 20), is indicated for swine uses as follows:<p>
20 g lincomycin per ton of complete feed:  For increase in rate of weight gain
in growing-finishing swine.  Feed 20 grams of lincomycin per ton of complete
feed as the sole ration form weaning to market weight.<p>
40 g lincomycin per ton of complete feed:  For control swine dysentery.  Feed
40 grams of lincomycin per ton of complete feed as the sole ration.  For use in
animals or on premises with a history of swine dysentery but where symptoms
have not yet occurred, or for control of swine dysentery following treatment
with 100 grams of lincomycin per ton of complete feed.<br>
  <p>
<b>3. Dosage Form, Route of Administration, Recommended Dosage:</b><p>
Lincomix Premix is a medicated premix (Type A Medicated Article) and is
available in two concentrations:  20 and 50 grams lincomycin per pound.  Each
concentration is available in 50lb bags.<p>
Lincomix Premix must be thoroughly mixed in feeds before use. Lincomix Premixes
may be used to make either Type B or Type C Medicated Feeds.<p>
For increase in rate of weight gain in growing-finishing swine, feed 20 grams
of lincomycin per ton of complete swine feed.<p>
For control of swine dysentery, feed 40 grams of lincomycin per ton of complete
swine feed.<br>
  <p>
<b>4. Effectiveness:</b><p>
Effectiveness of Lincomix Premixes for control of swine dysentery is addressed
in FOI Summaries made available 30 June 1976 (<B>41 FR 26855</B>).  Effectiveness of
Lincomix Premixes for increased rate of weight gain in growing-finishing swine
is addressed in a FOI Summary made available 9 April 1986 (<B>51 FR 12137/8</B>).<p>
<b>5. Animal Safety:</b><p>
Target animal safety is addressed in FOI Summaries made available 30 June 1976
(<B>41 FR 26855</B>) and 9 April 1986 (<B>51 FR 12137/8</B>).<br>
  <p>
<b>6. Human Safety:</b><p>
A. Toxicity Tests and Tolerance<p>
Toxicity tests are addressed in the FOI Summary included with a Supplemental
New Animal Drug Application (NADA 111-636).  The FOI Summary was made available
31 January 1990 (<B>55 FR 3208/9</B>).<br>
<br>
No tolerance is required for the 20 and 40 g/ton use levels of lincomycin in
swine.  The previously established tolerance of 0.1 part per million for
negligible residues of lincomycin in the edible tissues of swine (<B>21CFR
556.360</B>) still applies to the 100 and 200 g/ton use levels of lincomycin in
swine and is not affected by this supplement.<p>
B. Safe Concentration of Total Residues<p>
1. No Observed Effect Level <br>
As referenced in the FOI Summary for NADA 111-636, the lowest No Observed
Effect Level (NOEL) from the oral feeding toxicity studies is 30 mg/kg body
weight.<p>
2. Safe Concentration (SC) Calculations<p>
<pre>
Safe Concentration = (ADI x Weight of Average Adult)
                     _______________________________
                     
                      Daily Consumption of Meat<p>
</pre>				
Where: 
<pre>
Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) = (lowest NOEL)/(Safety Factor)
</pre>
 and Safety Factor (SF) of 1000 is used because 90 day feeding study data were used.<br>
Daily Consumption of Meat is 500 grams.<br>
Weight of an average adult is 60kg.<br>
Lowest NOEL (No Observable Effect Limit) is 30mg/Kg,<p>
Therefore:<p>
 ADI = 0.03/kg and <p>
<pre>
SC  =  (0.03mg/kg x 60kg)/500g  =  3.6 g/kg or 3.6ppm<p>
</pre>
Present FDA policy limits SC to no more than 3.0 ppm unless chronic toxicity
data were used for the SC calculations.<p>
Using the Consumption Factors cited in the CVM Guideline, Guideline for
Establishing a Tolerance, dated September 1986, the following SC values apply
per swine tissue:<br>

<sup>**</sup>Mean of 6 animals.<br>

* Concentrations expressed as lincomycin free base equivalents.  In addition,
microbiological assays on edible tissues of the swine from the 20 and 40 g/ton
groups show parent lincomycin to be less than 0.1 ppm at zero day withdrawal,
the tolerance that still applies for the 100 and 200 g/ton use levels.<p>
7.  Comparative Metabolism<br>
High Pressure Liquid Chromatographic and Thin Layer Chromatographic procedures
were used to profile metabolites of lincomycin in the urine, feces and liver of
swine and rats each orally administered <sup>14</sup>C labeled lincomycin
hydrochloride.<p>
Rats were dosed at 15 or 300 mg/kg body weight whereas swine were dosed at 200
g/ton of complete feed.  Rats were sacrificed while on treatment.  Two pigs
were sacrificed four hours post last treatment and two at six days post
treatment.  Non-medicated feed was administered to pigs during the six day
preslaughter drug withdrawal interval.<p>
Feces and gastrointestinal tract contents of pigs and rats contained the major
portion (70%) of the excreted drug.  Excretion in both species is mostly by the
GI tract due, in part, to the poor oral absorption of lincomycin.<p>
The most prevalent compound in urine of rats and swine is parent lincomycin.
In addition to lincomycin there are 15 other metabolites in swine urine of
which 10 are also present in urine of rats.<p>
Parent lincomycin is the most prevalent compound in the feces of rats and
swine, excepting in swine at two days (48h) post last treatment when lincomycin
concentrations in feces is extremely low.  Of the six other metabolites present
in feces of swine tested while on treatment, three are also present in feces of
rats.<p>
Metabolites of lincomycin are extensive in the liver, numbering 26, which
includes parent lincomycin.  Of these, 20 are also present in liver of orally
treated rats.  These 20 metabolites comprise at least 90% of the total residue
and, therefore, additional studies were not required for assessing the
toxicological concern of the remaining metabolites.<p>
Collectively, the urine, feces and liver profiles show quantitative differences
between rat and swine in the metabolism of lincomycin but a remarkable
similarity on a qualitative basis.  Nearly all metabolites found in the swine
urine, feces and liver were also present in corresponding samples from rats.
Therefore, rats used in the toxicity study were auto-exposed to the same
compounds as would humans consuming uncooked edible tissues of lincomycin
treated swine.<p>
D.  Establish the Withdrawal Period<p>
Total <sup>14</sup>C lincomycin residue data for several feed use levels
demonstrate that total residues are well below the established safe
concentrations per tissue at zero day withdrawal, even when administered at
exaggerated doses (i.e., at 100 g/t which is 2.5x the 40 g/t use level),
thereby supporting the zero day withdrawal for the 20 and 40 g/t feed use
levels.<br>

F.  Anti-microbial Drugs Intended for Long-term, Subtherapeutic Use in Animal
Feeds<p>
Please refer to the FOI Summary made Available 30 June 1976 (<B>41 FR 26855</B>), for
referral to studies completed in accordance with provisions of <B>21CFR558.15</B>.<br>
  <p>
<b>7.  Agency Conclusions:</b><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of Section
512 of the Act and demonstrate that human food products derived from swine when
fed lincomycin at 20 g/ton and at 40 g/ton with a zero withdrawal period are
safe.<p>
This supplemental NADA is regarded as a Category II application under CVM's
supplemental policy, (<B>42 FR 64367</B>; December 23, 1977), and which required a
complete review of the food safety data.  The supplement provides for
establishment of a safe concentration and a shortening of the withdrawal period
from 6-days to 0-days for swine fed lincomycin at 20 and 40 grams per ton of
complete feed.  The sponsor has provided all the toxicological (by reference to
NADA 111-636) and residue chemistry data that are necessary for the approval of
the supplemental application.<p>
Data from a two generation toxicology study show a no observed effect level
(NOEL) of 1000 mg/kg.  The safe concentration for lincomycin was calculated
(1000x safety factor) on the basis of the 30 mg/kg NOEL for embryotoxicity.
The safe concentration calculated for total residues at zero days of drug
withdrawal are:  3 ppm for muscle, 9 ppm for liver, 12 ppm for kidney and fat.
Comprehensive metabolism studies established that rats are exposed essentially
to the same metabolites as are humans consuming edible products from swine
treated with lincomycin; therefore, further toxicity testing was not required.
Residue depletion studies in this application demonstrate that total residues
of lincomycin (from 14-C labeled lincomycin studies) are well below the
calculated safe concentrations when the drug is fed to swine at 20 and 40 grams
per ton of feed.  In addition, residues of parent lincomycin in edible tissues
of swine treated with 20 and 40 g/ton were less than 0.1 ppm, the tolerance
that still applies for the 100 and 200 g/ton use levels.<p>
The shortening of the withdrawal period from 6-days to 0-day, for swine fed
lincomycin at 20 and 40 grams per ton, qualifies lincomycin to be classified as
a Category I drug, under <B>21CFR558.4</B>.  This change to Category I also, changes
the upper limit for drug concentration of the Type B medicated feeds from 10
grams to 20 grams per pound of product.<br>

<h3>Points to Consider</h3>

Center for Veterinary Medicine<p>
<p>
<h3>Preliminary Considerations for Development of a  
Guideline Enabling Flexible Labeling of Antimicrobials for 
Therapeutic Use </h3> 
<h4>PREAMBLE</h4> 
The need for the development of flexible labeling associated with therapeutic
antimicrobials has been recognized by the American Veterinary Medical
Association (AVMA), the Animal Health Institute (AHI), and the Center for
Veterinary Medicine (CVM). The Center has considered the issues which must be
addressed when suggesting a change in current labeling practices and invites
comments on the following "Points to Consider" in affecting changes in current
practices while continuing to protect the Nation's food supply from
antimicrobial residues. The Center has discussed these general principles with
other governmental agencies, private consultants, and experts in the fields of
pharmacokinetics and microbiology. Based on these discussions, the Center
believes that the following data elements are integral to developing an
indicated dose and establishing a dose range for therapeutic antimicrobials.<p>

This document is being presented for consideration and comment by all
interested parties. The responses from this comment period, and any public
discussions which may ensue, will be considered during the drafting of one or
more guidelines. These guidelines will direct the development of <i> in vitro 
</i> &#160; microbial inhibition data and <i> in vivo </i> 
 &#160; pharmacokinetic data leading
to a suggested dose, within an acceptable dose range, to be conveyed in the
labeling along with considerable pharmacokinetic and microbial inhibition
information to assist veterinarians in choosing an appropriate therapeutic
regime.<p>

The Center is dedicated to improving the approval process by utilizing the best
science currently available to facilitate more flexible labeling and,
therefore, more useful animal drug products, and to that end presents this
document for comment.

<h4>BACKGROUND</h4>

The Center for Veterinary Medicine has for some time recognized that, at least
with respect to therapeutic antimicrobials, the "traditional" dose titration
investigations used to establish an "optimal" dose were not particularly
consistent with current veterinary practices or scientific principles and
techniques. On October 21, 1991, the AVMA and the AHI jointly filed a citizen
petition requesting the Center to utilize a broader scope of scientific data in
assessing the effectiveness and establishing an appropriate dose for veterinary
drugs. The Center, in a response dated October 6, 1992, agreed that there were
deficiencies in the traditional methodology for dose determination and efficacy
demonstration. Center scientists increased their efforts to collect and analyze
current applicable scientific information which would support the use of
alternative data to support approval of prescription therapeutic antimicrobial
NADA's.<p>

The immediate goal of the Center is to formulate one or more guidelines
suggesting an alternative approval path which will expedite the approval
process by utilizing pharmacokinetic and <i>in vitro </i>&#160; and pharmacokinetic
data. Standards regarding the quality of the <i>in vitro </i>&#160; data remain to be
determined. Combining the appropriate <i>in vitro </i>&#160; data with the appropriate
pharmacokinetic data will enable the Center to approve a therapeutic range for
new antimicrobials.<p>

Utilizing the case of greatest concern (i.e., food animal therapeutics), the
Center's perception of flexible labeling is prescription drug labeling which
bears not only a suggested dose for each disease claim within an acceptable
dose range, but also <i>in vitro</i> &#160;microbial sensitivity information and
pharmacokinetic information about the drug (including information correlating
dose and residue depletion) useful to attending veterinarians. Flexible
labeling is to enable veterinarians, operating within a valid
veterinary-client-patient relationship, to use their professional training to
interpret the scientifically based description of the drug's pharmacological
characteristics, to select an appropriate therapeutic regime from the approved
safe and effective dose range, and to specify an appropriate withdrawal time
associated with the treatment regime selected. 
<h4>SPECIFIC POINTS TO CONSIDER </h4>

<b>Determining  <I>in vitro </i>&#160; Microbial  Efficacy:</b> 
<p>
(I) <i>The effective range of sensitive organisms,  and the primary-
mode of activity (bacteriocidal or bacteriostatic) of a drug entity must be
determined.</i><p>

A. Establish the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) and minimum
bacteriocidal concentrations (MBC's) to demonstrate the drug's effect on a
variety of bacterial pathogens. This includes all isolates of veterinary
pathogens collected to support the label claim. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) for each
pathogen should also be determined. Zone of inhibition data should be collected
for the purpose of inclusion in the label insert.<p>

B.  For each potential veterinary pathogen (Genus/species) in a particular
target species, the Center suggests 30 to 50 isolates. The number of total 
isolates to support a single bacterial claim will be considered on a case by
case basis. The Center suggests a total of at least 500 isolates for labels
involving multiple bacteria. These isolates should be collected from a variety
of geographic locations and should include a variety of Genus/species and
serotypes. These data should be collected by more than one laboratory and no
one laboratory should be responsible for a disproportionate number of claimed
pathogen isolates.<p>

At this time, the only reliable standards available to the Center for
evaluation of <i>in vitro </i> &#160;microbiology data are those established by the
National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) 771 East Lancaster
Avenue, Villanova, Pennsylvania 19085. Refer to the following human guidelines,
but make appropriate veterinary revisions when using these documents.<p>

Development of <i>in vitro </i> &#160;Susceptibility Testing Criteria and Quality
Control Parameters (NCCLS Document M23-T Vol. 10 No. 9).<p>

Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria that Grow
Aerobically (NCCLS Document M7-A2 Vol. 10 No. 8).<p>

Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Disk Susceptibility Test (NCCLS
Document M2-A4 Vol. 10 No. 7).<p>

Isolates from a limited number of veterinary pathogens specific to the intended
claim(s) are not likely to provide enough information about the spectrum of a
drug entity's activity. Therefore, a list of veterinary pathogens specific to
each target animal is being offered for comment. After the Center has evaluated
the comments received a final list of veterinary pathogens will be developed to
serve as a standard battery of bacteria with respect to which the diversity of
a drug's <i>in vitro </i> &#160;microbial activity can be demonstrated.

<h4>Developing Pharmacokinetic Data:</h4>

(I)<I> The chemical behavior characteristics of the drug entity must be defined.</I><p>
<p>
A.  Determine if plasma, serum, or whole blood is to be the tissue of analysis
in future trials.<p>

B. Determine if there are active metabolites of the drug, and define the
relationship between the concentration and relative activities of the parent
compound versus that of these active metabolite(s).<p>
<p>
C.  Define the protein binding characteristics of the parent compound and/or any
active metabolite(s).<p>

D.  Determine the pKa and the octanol/water partition coefficient of the parent
compound and any active metabolite(s).<p>


(II) <i>Pharmacokinetics of an intravenous preparation of the active ingredient and
major  metabolite(s).</i><p>

These trials are to be conducted in healthy representatives of the target
species which adequately represent the heterogeneous population for which the
drug is proposed. The number of animals required for these trials will depend
on the variability between individual observations. The greater the individual
animal variability associated with the drug's pharmacokinetics the larger the
number of animals necessary to obtain meaningful kinetic estimates for each
sub-population (i.e., age, sex, class of animal).<p>

A. Determine the steady state volume of distribution. The potential for nonlinear
kinetics should be evaluated by estimating Vdss over three evenly spaced dosing
regimes (two of which must represent the proposed extremes of the therapeutic
range).<p>

B. Define the apparent terminal elimination rate constant.<p>

C. Define the total body clearance.<p>

D.  Define the routes of excretion and to what extent each route contributes to
total excretion.<p>
E. Define the AUC(0-<IMG SRC="infty.gif" ALT="infinity symbol" ALIGN=middle>) 
and the MRT. <P>
F. Determine the lowest serum level which results in adverse effects. It should be
noted, unlike the previously accepted target animal safety investigations, this
trial design will be a tolerance titration of the drug entity in each target
species.<p>
G. Propose a pharmacokinetic model which explains the serum concentration/time
profile of the parent compound and any major (&gt;10%) metabolite(s).<p>

H. Propose appropriate methodology to demonstrate a relationship between the serum
concentration of the drug entity and/or metabolite(s) with the tissue
concentrations observed in the target animal. Conduct trials to define this
relationship.<p>

(III) <i>Pharmacokinetics of the final formulation: </i>
<p>
A. SINGLE DOSE ADMINISTRATION:<p> 
<ol>
<li>AUC(0-<IMG SRC="infty.gif" ALT="infinity symbol" ALIGN=middle>) 
[AUC(0-LOQ) + C(Final) / K(el)] 
<li>Cmax 
<li>Tmax 
<li>Kel 
</ol> <p>
B.  MULTIPLE DOSE ADMINISTRATION: 
<ol>
<li>AUC(0-Tau)*  (See note below)
<li>Cmax 
<li>Tmax  
<li>Cmin**  (See note below)
<li>Peak to trough ratio for multiple dosing schedule.** (See note below).<p>
</ol>
*   Where 0-Tau equals one dosing interval at steady state for the final labeled
dose.<p>

** Trough concentration (Cmin) is defined as the lowest concentration observed
during a single dosing interval (either at steady state or after the final
labeled dose). <p>
C.  IF FINAL FORMULATION IS OTHER THAN INTRAVENOUS:<p>
<ol>
<li>Determine the bioavailability (F) of the dosage form.<p>

<li>If bioavailability is less than 1 (100% absorbed) characterize the source of
loss (e.g., first pass effect, non-absorbed drug, etc.).<p>

<li>If the drug's absorption process is saturable, determine the dose at which
saturation begins to occur.<p>
</ol>

<b>Determining the Therapeutic Range and Therapeutic Window:</b>
<P>
<i> (I)  Assessment of the <i>in vitro </i>  &#160; and pharmacokinetic data will
result in a tentative therapeutic range.</i><p>

The therapeutic range of the drug for each target species will be determined by
assessing the <i>in vitro </i> &#160; microbial sensitivity and the drug's availability
at the proposed sites of infection for pathogens which represent the extremes
of the drug's sensitivity.<p>

The extremes of the therapeutic window will be tentatively established
utilizing the low end of the therapeutic range and assessment of the target
animal safety trial relative to the proposed class and species for which the
drug is intended.<p>

<b>Developing the Residue Depletion Package:</b><p>

<i>(I) To correlate residue depletion with dose over the dose range the sponsor
should determine the residue depletion time for the final formulation
administered to the target species for each* (See note below) proposed route of administration
at both extremes of the therapeutic window.</i> 
<p>
* The Center may consider the development of a Residue Depletion Package using
the route of administration which would result in the longest withdrawal
period.<p>


<b>Clinical Trial Evaluation of the Indicated Dose:</b><p>

<i>(I) A clinical trial which verifies the effectiveness of a "suggested" dose for
each claim predicted from <i> in vitro </i> &#160; and pharmacological
data:</i><p>
A.   One clinical trial will be required to assess the efficacy of the "suggested"
dose for each disease claim. However, as the Center is suggesting that only one
trial need be conducted, the trial design should incorporate the following
additional parameters.<p>
<ol>
<li>The blood levels of the drug and/or active metabolite(s) observed during the
clinical trial must be comparable with the blood levels seen during the
pharmacokinetic trials conducted in healthy animals. (Sampling at Tmax may be
sufficient). 

<li>Culture results of the causative agent(s) present during the clinical trial
should demonstrate the agent(s) adequately represent the bacterial strains
isolated in the <i>in vitro </i>&#160; investigations. The cultures should be taken
before treatment is initiated and after the treatment is concluded with the
investigational drug, and the sensitivity/resistance pattern established for
the investigational drug and other antimicrobials.<p>

INFORMATION SUMMARY</b><P>
<P>
<b>1. GENERAL INFORMATION:</b><P>
NADA Number: 011-315<P>
Sponsor: The Upjohn Company<br>
Kalamazoo, Michigan 49001<P>
Generic Name: Neomycin sulfate<P>
Trade Name: NEOMIXR 325 Soluble Powder and NEOMIXR AG 325 Soluble Powder<P>
Marketing Status: OTC<P>
<b>Date Stamped:</b>	03/04/92<P>
<b>2. INDICATIONS FOR USE:</b> <P>For the treatment and control of colibacillosis
(bacterial
enteritis) caused by <I>Escherichia coli </I> susceptible to neomycin sulfate in cattle
(excluding
veal calves), swine, sheep and goats.<P>
<b>3. A. DOSAGE FORM:</b><P> Soluble Powder.<P>
<B>B. ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION:</B><P> NEOMIX 325 and NEOMIX AG 325 are
administered orally in water or milk.<P>
<B>C. RECOMMENDED DOSAGE:</B><P>The drug is administered at 10 mg neomycin sulfate
per
pound of body weight (equivalent to 7 mg neomycin base) per day in divided
doses for a
maximum of 14 days.<P>
<b>4. EFFECTIVENESS:</b><P> NADA 011-315 was originally approved as safe for use as
labeled 
on March 21, 1958. The drug was the subject of National Academy of
Sciences/National
Research Council (NAS/NRC) reports which were published in the <b>FEDERAL
REGISTER</b>
of January 19, 1971 (DESI 11-315V, 36 FR 837). The NAS/NRC evaluated the drug
as
"probably effective" for use in the control and treatment of bacterial
enteritis in cattle,
horses, sheep, swine, goats, cats, turkeys, chickens, ducks, and mink, and as a
wet
antibacterial dressing in swine, cattle, sheep, and dogs. The NAS/NRC stated in
relevant
part: (1) the labeling should warn that treated animals must actually consume
enough
medicated feed or medicated water to provide a therapeutic dose under the
conditions that
prevail - as a precaution, the label should state the desired oral dose per
unit of animal
weight per day for each species as a guide to effective use of the preparation
in drinking
water or feed; (2) the labeling should warn that oral neomycin sulfate is not
indicated if
animals have developed a septicemia as systemic levels of neomycin are not
obtained
because of the low degree of absorption from the gastrointestinal tract; (3)
the disease
claims for preparations administered orally must be restricted to disease
involving the
gastrointestinal tract because of the chemical and pharmacological properties
of neomycin
sulfate; and (4) each disease claim should be properly qualified as
"appropriate for use in
(name of disease) caused by pathogens sensitive to (name of drug)", and if the
disease
claim cannot be so qualified the claim must be dropped. <P>
The Food and Drug Administration concurred with the academy's findings,
interpreting 
the phrase " ...cannot be so qualified ..." in paragraph (4) to mean " ...is not
supported by
adequate data ..." (See 36 Fed. Reg. 837). FDA then proceeded to review all
available
data relating to the effectiveness of products subject to NADA 011-315 to
determine which
label claims were supported by the requisite proof of effectiveness. That
review resulted 
ina letter dated December 10, 1985, addressed to the Animal Health Institute
(AHI), in 
whichthe agency stated that it had "concluded that such data supported
effectiveness for 
the treatment and control of colibacillosis (bacterial enteritis) caused by
<I>Escherichia coli</I>
susceptible to neomycin sulfate in cattle, sheep, and goats, and porcine
colibacillosis
caused by E. coli susceptible to neomycin sulfate."<P>
Thereafter, the sponsor complied with the evaluation of NAS/NRC and FDA's
conclusions
in the following manner:<P>
1. One disease of the gastrointestinal tract (colibacillosis in cattle, swine,
sheep and goats)
has been properly qualified as being caused by pathogens sensitive to neomycin
sulfate.
Disease claims which were not so qualified (including all claims involving use
in poultry,
horses, mink, dogs and cats) have been deleted from labeling.<P>
2. The appropriate oral dose of 10 mg neomycin sulfate per unit of animal
weight per day
in each species has been incorporated in the labeling.<P>
3. The revised labeling contains the statements that treated animals must have
the
medicated water adjusted to compensate for variation in age and weight of the
animal, the
nature and severity of disease signs, and environmental temperature and
humidity, each of
which affects water consumption.<P>
4. The labeling also contains a statement that the use of oral neomycin is not
indicated as
a sole treatment, if the animals develop septicemia.<P>
<B>5. ANIMAL SAFETY:</B><P> NADA 011-315 was originally approved as safe on March 21,
1958.<br>
No further safety data are required.<P>
<b>6. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><P>
The NAS/NRC evaluation of the drug is concerned only with the effectiveness and
safety
of the drug for the treated animal. FDA's approval of the supplemental
application did not
involve reevaluation or reaffirmation of the human food safety data in the
parent
application.<P>
Tolerance<P>
A tolerance of 0.25 ppm is already established for edible tissue of calves and
0.15 ppm
for milk (21 CFR 556.430). The tolerance of 0.25 ppm in edible tissues also
applies to 
swine,sheep, and goats. The tolerance of 0.15 ppm for milk also applies to
goats.<P>
Withdrawal Time<P>
The withdrawal times are those previously established in 21 CFR 558.20: 30 days
for
cattle (excluding veal calves), and 20 days for swine and sheep. The withdrawal
time is
 30 days for goats.<P>
Regulatory Methods for Residues<P>
The regulatory analytical method for detection of residues of the drug is a
microbiological
test using <I>Staphylococcus epidermidis</I> suspension. The method is as published by
the
Food and Drug Administration, "Antibiotic Residues in Milk, Dairy Products and
Animal
Tissues: Methods, Reports, and Protocols", revised October 1968, reprinted
December
1974.<P>
<b>7. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
This supplemental NADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act
and
demonstrates that neomycin sulfate soluble powder, when used under its
proposed
conditions of use, is safe and effective for the labeled indications. The
approval provides
for use of neomycin sulfate soluble powder for the treatment and control of
colibacillosis
(bacterial enteritis) caused by <I> Escherichia coli </I> susceptible to neomycin
sulfate in cattle
(excluding veal calves), swine, sheep and goats.<P>
The "probably effective" finding of the NAS/NRC regarding neomycin sulfate
which was
published in the <b>FEDERAL REGISTER</b> of January 19, 1971, was subsequently
reviewed by  FDA, resulting in the December 10, 1985 letter to AHI discussed
above. , the "probably effective" status for neomycin sulfate soluble powder,
NADA 011-315, was upgraded to"effective" status with respect to the claims noted
in the previous paragraph. The firm submitted revised labeling to conform to the
letter to AHI and, therefore, this supplemental NADA complies with the NAS/NRC
evaluation and FDA's conclusions.<P>
Neomycin sulfate soluble powder for use in food-producing animals is currently
on the
market as an over-the-counter product. Accurate diagnosis can be made with a
reasonable
degree of certainty by the layman, and the conditions for use described in the
labeling are
likely to be followed in practice. Therefore, the Center for Veterinary
Medicine has
concluded that this product should retain over-the-counter marketing status.<br>
 
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is
a
Category II change. The approval of this change is not expected to have any
adverse
effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug and, therefore,
did not require
a re-evaluation of the human food or target animal safety data in the parent
application. 
<br>
Under the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988, this
approval
does not qualify for an exclusivity period under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of
the Federal,
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b (c)(2)(F)(iii)) because the
supplemental
application does not contain reports of new clinical or field investigations or
human food
safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the
approval and
conducted or sponsored by the applicant.

<b>EFFECTIVENESS: </b><P>
NADA 065-252 was originally approved as safe for use as
labeled on February 18, 1954. The drug was the subject of National Academy of
Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) reports which were published in
the <b>FEDERAL REGISTER</b> of November 21, 1969 (<B>FR 69-13826</B>).<P>
The Academy evaluated these products as probably effective for the treatment of
bacterial diseases involving the gastrointestinal tract in poultry, swine, and
calves.<P>
The Academy stated that:<P>
1. Each disease claim should be properly qualified as "appropriate for use in
(name of disease) caused by pathogens sensitive to (name of drug)." If the
disease cannot be so qualified, the claim must be dropped.<P>
2. Label claims for these preparations must be restricted to diseases involving
the gastrointestinal tract because of the chemical and pharmacological
properties of the streptomycin sulfate.<P>
3. The label should warn that treated animals must actually consume sufficient
medicated water to provide a therapeutic dose under the conditions that
prevail. As a precaution, the label should declare the desired oral dose in
terms of the amount of drug per pound of animal weight per day for each species
as a guide to effective use of the preparation in drinking water.<P>
4. Label claims made "for prevention of" or "to prevent" should be replaced
with "as an aid in the control of" or, "to aid in the control of."<P>
5. Labeling should carry a warning pertaining to the development of
streptomycin resistant organisms.<P>
6. Dosage levels recommended in the labeling are low.<P>
The Food and Drug Administration concurs with the Academy's evaluation. This
evaluation is concerned only with the drug's effectiveness and safety to the
animal to which administered. It does not take into account the safety for food
use of food derived from drug-treated animals. Nothing herein will constitute a
bar to further proceedings with respect to questions of safety of these drugs
or their metabolites as <i> </i>residues in food products derived from treated
animals.<P>
The Food and Drug Administration proceeded to review all available data
relating to the effectiveness of products subject to NADA 065-252 to determine
which label claims were supported by the requisite proof of effectiveness. That
review resulted in a letter to the sponsor dated September 23, 1992, in which
the agency stated that it had "concluded that such data supported effectiveness
for bacterial enteritis in chickens, swine and calves."<P>
Thereafter, the sponsor complied with the evaluation of NAS / NRC / DESI and FDA's
conclusions in the following manner:<P>
1. Each disease claim on the label has been properly qualified with the
appropriate genus and species of bacteria susceptible to streptomycin sulfate.
Except for poultry the disease was defined as non-specific. Disease claims
which were not so qualified have been deleted.<P>
2. Label claims for this preparation have been restricted to infectious
bacterial enteritis. The appropriate oral dose of 10-15 mg per pound body
weight daily in each species has been incorporated in the labeling.<P>
3. The manufacturer's label carries the warning statement that treated animal
must have the medicated water adjusted to compensate for variation in age and
the weight of the animal, the nature and severity of disease signs, and
environmental temperature and humidity, each of which affects water
consumption.<P>
4. Claims made for prevention have been dropped completely.<P>
5. The label carries a warning statement pertaining to the development of
streptomycin resistant organisms.<P>
<b>ANIMAL SAFETY:</b><p>
NADA 065-252 was originally approved as safe on February
18, 1954. No further safety data are required.<P>
<b>HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><P>
The NAS/NRC evaluation of the drug is concerned only with the effectiveness and
safety of the drug for the treated animal. FDA's approval of the supplemental
applications did not involve reevaluation or reaffirmation of the human food
safety data in the parent application.<P>
The supplemental application providing for the revision of the tolerance from
"zero" to 2.0 ppm in kidney and 0.5 ppm in all other edible tissues of calves,
swine, and poultry reflects the change in FDA policy regarding the concept of
residue tolerance.  No new toxicity data are submitted in support of the change
because the values cited above are consistent with the tolerance level that
would have been established when the drug was originally approved ( February
18, 1954).<P>
Under the zero tolerance concept, no detectable residues of a new animal drug
were permissible in edible tissues of treated food animals when tissues were
assayed using available analytical methods.  However, as analytical
technologies advanced, methodologies became increasingly sensitive and capable
of measuring progressively smaller amounts of drug residues in tissues.
Therefore, FDA adopted the concept of maximum negligible, or permissible,
residues which reflect the lower level of quantitative sensitivity of the
official regulatory analytical method. Also, considered in this process is 
the relative consumption of various tissues.<P>
The levels of 2.0 ppm in kidney and 0.5 ppm in other tissues reflects the
levels of streptomycin which FDA considers to be safe and at which USDA has
been monitoring for residues for a number of years. The requested tolerances
have already been determined to be scientifically acceptable to the agency.
Revision of 21 CFR 556.610 formally acknowledges the reality of streptomycin
residue monitoring.<P>
<b>AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><P>
The DESI finalization supplemental NADA satisfies the requirements of section
512 of the Act and demonstrates that Strep SoL, when used under its proposed
conditions of use, is safe and effective for the labeled indications. The
approval provides for use of Strep SoL for the treatment of infectious
enteritis in chickens, swine, and calves.<P>
The "probably effective" finding of the NAS/NRC/DESI regarding Strep SoL which
was published in the <b>FEDERAL REGISTER</b> of November 21, 1969, was
subsequently reviewed by FDA, resulting in the upgrade to "effective" status
with respect to the claims noted in the previous paragraph. The firm submitted
revised labeling to conform and, therefore, this supplemental NADA complies
with the NAS / NRC / DESI evaluation and FDA's conclusions.<P>
Strep SoL for use in food-producing animals is currently on the market as an
over-the-counter product. When the NADA was reviewed under NAS/NRC/DESI
program, it was an over-the-counter product and this marketing status remains
unchanged. Therefore, the Center for Veterinary Medicine has concluded that
this product should retain overthe-counter marketing status.<P>
Additionally, the supplemental application providing for revision of the
tolerance from "zero" to 2.0 ppm in the kidney and 0.5 ppm in the edible
tissues of calves, swine, and chickens is acceptable and is approved.<P>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), these
are Category II changes. The approval of these changes are not expected to have
any adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug and,
therefore, did not require a reevaluation of the human food or target animal
safety data in the parent application.<P>
Under the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988, these
approvals do not qualify for an exclusivity period under section
512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act U.S.C.360b
(c)(2)(F)(iii)) because the supplemental applications do not contain reports of
new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue
studies) and in the case of food producing animals, human food safety studies
(other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approvals and
conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<P>

<TITLE>FOOD ADDITIVE PETITION FOR RADIATION OF POULTRY FEED </TITLE>


</HEAD>
<BODY>
CVM UPDATE
<P> Center for Veterinary Medicine<br>
Issued by: Office of Management, Communications and Education Branch, HFV-12 Food
and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville, MD 20855<br>

FAX (301) 594-1831 <p>
October 20, 1995 <P>

<H3>FDA APPROVES FOOD ADDITIVE PETITION FOR RADIATION OF POULTRY FEED </H3>
<P>
In the September 28, 1995 <B>Federal Register</B>, the FDA
announced that the Agency is amending the food additive regulations to provide
for the safe use of gamma radiation from cobalt-60 in an absorbed dose range of 2
kiloGrays (kGy) (0.2 Megarads) (Mrad) to 25 kGy (2.5 Mrad), in poultry feed
products. This action is in response to a food additive petition filed by Nordion
International, Inc., Kanata, Ontario, Canada. 
<P>The use of irradiation was
evaluated based on its ability to render poultry feeds and poultry feed
ingredients salmonella negative. Salmonella is known to cause animal disease. The
effect of subclinical cases of salmonella on animal production is difficult to
quantitate. There are, however, substantial circumstantial data suggesting a
potential link between the organisms in feed and organisms causing human and
animal salmonellosis. For this reason in 1990, FDA announced a goal of salmonella
negative for animal feed and feed ingredients. FDA has defined salmonella
negative as 10 samples from a continuous production lot testing negative for
salmonella using the culture procedure described in the 7th edition of FDA's
<I>Bacteriological Analytical Manual</I>.<P>
 Data submitted by the sponsor indicate that an
irradiation dose of 1.0 kGy effectively reduces the salmonella count by 1 log
cycle (one decimal reduction). To ensure that irradiation achieves the intended
purpose, all portions of the feed must receive at least the minimum absorbed
dose. The minimum absorbed dose should be based on initial salmonella
concentration using the relationship that 1 kGy reduces salmonella concentration
by 1 log cycle. Based on the statistical power of the sampling plan, the minimum
dose should be no less than 2 kGy in order to ensure that the salmonella negative
definition is met.
<P> Data submitted by the sponsor indicate that irradiation does
have a minimal effect on the content of some nutrients such as water soluble
vitamins and some amino acids. Feeds treated by irradiation should be formulated
to account for such nutritional loss.
<P> FDA has evaluated the data in the petition
and other relevant material. The Agency concluded that irradiation of poultry
feeds and poultry feed ingredients is safe when the feed is formulated to allow
for nutritional loss, and that the regulations should be amended by adding new
section (Title 21, Part 579.40.)<P>
This amendment will allow the marketing of irradiation equipment by
manufacturers, such as Nordion, for use by the poultry feed industry. Irradiation
of poultry feed products is to be performed in a facility licensed by the U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Irradiators are to be operated in conformance to
the requirements of the U.S. Department of Energy (10 CFR 51). The sponsor has
indicated that there are currently at least twenty contract irradiation
facilities in the U.S. capable of irradiating poultry feed products.
<P> Additional
information on this food additive approval is available in the <B>Federal Register</B>
announcement or by contacting Dr. Sharon A. Benz, Center for Veterinary Medicine
(HFV-226), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville, MD
20855, 301-594- 1724. Any person who will be adversely affected by this
regulation may file written objections on or before October 30, 1995, with the
Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, Room 1-23,
12420 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, MD 20857.

<h3>PROTECTING LABORATORY ANIMALS</h3>

<i>A Statement from the United States Public Health Service</i><p>
As a result of a recent lawsuit brought by two animal protectionist
organizations, a Federal court ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) to reconsider its exclusion of rats, mice, and birds from coverage under
the Animal Welfare Act. In the judge's opinion, "the USDA's decision not to
regulate these species sent a message that researchers may subject these
animals to cruel and  inhumane conditions." 
<p>
People who are familiar with the extensive system of U.S. laws, regulations,
guidelines and principles that protect the welfare of laboratory animals would
not necessarily agree with the judge's comment.  The Public Health Service
(PHS) wants to reassure the American people that other laws exist to safeguard
the welfare of rats, nice, and birds, species that comprise about 90% of
research animals.<p>
According to the Health Research Extension Act, over 1,000 institutions
receiving funds from the PHS to conduct animals experiments are required to
comply with the provisions of the Act and to follow the recommendations in the <i>
Guide for the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Guide)</i>.  The Guide was
prepared to assist researchers in maintaining high quality care for all
commonly-used  laboratory animals. It includes the Government principles for
animal care and use adopted by all agencies and institutions that conduct
federally-supported animal research. This guide also applies under
another Federal law, the Good Laboratory Practices Act. Research
laboratories that conduct studies using rats and mice are regulated by the
PHS's Food and Drug Administration and are subject to inspections.<p>
In addition, most institutions that do not receive PHS funding 
follow the <i>Guide</i>.
  For example, laboratory animal breeders, pharmaceutical
manufacturers, and commercial research laboratories that may not be subject
to USDA and PHS regulations voluntarily participate in a national
program of certification by the American Association for
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. This private organization monitors
institutional animal care  programs to be sure they maintain the standards set
forth in the <i>Guide.</i><p>
 
Animal use is an integral component of biomedical and behavioral research and
testing. The vast majority of scientists recognize that good science and good
animal care go hand-in-hand and would not tolerate or condone cruelty to, or
inhumane treatment of, any laboratory animal.<p>

<B>B. ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION:</B><P>    Oral
 
<P>
<B>C. RECOMMENDED DOSAGE:</B> <P>10 mg/pound body weight (cattle, swine and sheep),
various concentrations in water for poultry and in food for honey bees.<P>

 
<B>4.	EFFECTIVENESS:</B><P> NADA 008-622 was originally approved as safe for use as 
labeled on September 17, 1952. The drug was the subject of National Academy of 
Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) reports which were published in the 
FEDERAL REGISTER of May 5, 1970 (FR 70-5446). The Academy evaluated Terramycin Animal 
Formula Soluble Powder as effective for use in the treatment of hexamitiasis.  
They evaluated the product as probably effective when used for the control and 
treatment of specific diseases of livestock and poultry and concluded that use 
may result in faster gains and improved feed efficiency under appropriate conditions.<br>	
<P>
The Academy concluded that:<br>	
1.    Labels and package inserts require extensive revision. There is inadequate 
documentation of claims, excessive claims are made and bold conclusions are reached 
in the 	absence of sufficient controlled experimental evidence.<P>
2.    Claims for growth promotion or stimulation are not allowed and claims for 
faster gains and/or feed efficiency should be stated as "may result in faster gains 
and/or 	improved feed efficiency under appropriate conditions."<P>	
3.    Each disease claim should be properly qualified as "appropriate for use in 
(name of disease) caused by pathogens sensitive to (name of drug)" and if the disease 
cannot be so qualified the claim must be dropped.<P>	
4.    The label claims "for prevention of" or, "to prevent" should be replaced with 
"as an aid in the control of" or, "to aid in the control of."<P>	
5.    The label claim pertaining to egg production and 	hatchability should be modified 
to read, "May aid in maintaining egg production and hatchability, under appropriate 
conditions, by controlling pathogenic organisms."<P>	
6.    The labels should carry a warning that treated animals under the conditions 
that prevail must actually consume 	sufficient medicated water, or medicated feed, to 
constitute 	a therapeutic dose. As a precaution the labels should state what the desired 
oral dose is in terms of animal weight per 	day for each species to serve as a guide 
to effective use of the preparations in drinking water or feed.<P>	
7.    The labels should declare the dosage for the treatment of individual animals 
in terms of the amount of drug which should be given per unit of animal weight.
 
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration concurs with the Academy's findings,
interpreting the phrase "...cannot be so qualified..." in paragraph (3) to mean
"...is not supported by adequate data..." (See Fed. Reg. vol. 35, NO. 87-Tues,
May 5, 1970). FDA then proceeded to review all available data relating to the
effectiveness of products subject to NADA 008-622 to determine which label claims
were supported by the requisite proof of effectiveness. That review resulted in
a letter to the firm dated February 19, 1982, in which the agency stated that
it had concluded that such data supported effectiveness for the control and
treatment of bacterial diseases susceptible to oxytetracycline hydrochloride in
poultry, cattle, swine, sheep, and bees.<P>
Thereafter, the sponsor complied with the evaluation of NAS/NRC and FDA's
conclusions by submitting a supplemental application which revised the labeling
of its oxytetracycline HCl soluble powder in the following manner:

 
<P>
1.	The appropriate oral dose of 10 mg per pound body weight daily in each species 
(swine, cattle, and sheep) has been incorporated in the labeling.<P>
2.	Claims for growth promotion or feed efficiency are not included.<P>
3.	Each disease claim on the label has been properly qualified with the appropriate 
genus and species name susceptible to oxytetracycline hydrochloride. Disease claims 
which were not so qualified have been deleted.<P>
4.	Claims made for prevention have been revised to read "Control of..." where appropriate.<P>
5.	Claims for egg production and hatchability are not included.<P>
6.	The manufacturer's label carries the warning statement that treated animals must 
have the medicated water adjusted to compensate for variation in age and the weight of
the animal, the nature and severity of disease signs, and environmental temperature
and humidity, each of which affects water consumption.<P>
7.	The labels carries the appropriate dosage for the treatment of individual animals
in terms of the amount of drug which should be given per unit of animal weight.<P>
 

<b>5.	ANIMAL SAFETY:</b><P> NADA 008-622 was originally approved as safe on
September 17, 1952. No further safety data are required.<P>
<b>6.	HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b> <P>The NAS/NRC evaluation of the drug is concerned
only with the effectiveness and safety of the drug for the treated animal.
FDA's approval of the supplemental application did not involve re-evaluation or
reaffirmation of the human food safety data in the parent application. The firm
submitted a separate supplement requesting a tolerance of 0.1 ppm for uncooked
edible tissues in sheep be codified.<br>


 
WITHDRAWAL TIMES:<P> Turkeys, swine, cattle and sheep:  5 days <br>
Honey Bees-Remove at least 6 weeks prior to main honey flow.
 
<br>
REGULATORY METHOD FOR RESIDUES: <P>The regulatory analytical method for detection
of residues of the drug is a microbiological test using <i>Bacillus</i>
<i>cereus var. mycoides</i> (ATCC 11778) suspension. The method is as published
by the Food and Drug Administration, "Antibiotic Residues in Milk, Dairy
Products an Animal Tissues: Method, Reports, and Protocols, revised October
1968, reprinted December 1974.<P>
<b>7.	AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><P>
The DESI finalization supplemental NADA satisfies the requirements of section
512 of the Act and demonstrates that Oxytetracycline Soluble Powder
(Terramycin) when used under its proposed conditions of use, is safe and
effective for the labeled indications. The approval provides for use of
Oxytetracycline Soluble Powder for the control and treatment of specific
diseases in swine, cattle, sheep, poultry and honey bees.<P>
The "probably effective" finding of the NAS/NRC regarding Oxytetracycline
hydrochloride which was published in the <b>FEDERAL REGISTER</b> of May 5,
1970, was subsequently reviewed by FDA, resulting in the upgrade to "effective"
status with respect to the claims noted in the previous paragraph. The firm
submitted revised labeling to conform and, therefore, this supplemental NADA
complies with the NAS/NRC evaluation and FDA's conclusions.<P>
Oxytetracycline Soluble Powder for use in food-producing animals is currently
on the market as an over-the-counter product. When the NADA was reviewed under
NAS/NRC/DESI program, it was an over-the-counter product and this marketing
status remains unchanged. Therefore, the Center for Veterinary Medicine has
concluded that this product should retain over-the-counter marketing status.<P>
Additionally, the supplemental application providing for addition of the
tolerance of 0.1 ppm in uncooked edible tissues in sheep is acceptable and
approved.<P>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), these
are Category II changes. The approval of this changes is not expected to have
any adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug and,
therefore, did not require a re-evaluation of the human food or target animal
safety data in the parent application.<P>
Under the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988, these
approvals do not qualify for an exclusivity period under section
512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b
(c)(2)(F)(iii)) because the supplemental applications do not contain reports of
new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue
studies) and in the case of food producing animals, human food safety studies
(other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval and
conducted or sponsored by the applicant were required.<P>

ROLE OF ANIMAL TESTING</title></head><body>
<h3>PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE
ROLE OF ANIMAL TESTING</h3>

<i>A Statement from  the United States Public Health Service</i><p>
 This statement has been prepared to inform the general public about the
need for animal testing to ensure that medications, vaccines, environmental
chemicals, and a wide variety of consumer products, including cosmetics, are
safe for the public when used appropriately. The Public Health Service (PHS) is
concerned that animal activist organizations are trying to convince the public
incorrectly that product testing in animals is outdated and no longer
necessary.<p>
 Consumers may be further confused  by announcements that some
companies have stopped testing their products in laboratory animals. For
example, two ways in which a company can make such a claim are by using only
ingredients that historically are known to be safe or that have been previously
tested in animals and found to be nontoxic. When new ingredients need to meet
testing and safety requirements, it is often necessary  to test them in one
or more animal species.<p>
To protect the public from unexpected or unintended effects of toxic
substances, some PHS agencies conduct and support toxicological testing to
determine the harmful effects of commonly used products. To judge
whether a product may be unhealthy, even deadly, for humans and animals,
scientists called toxicologists must know how the substance is absorbed,
distributed, used, stored, and released by the body. For some products,
it may be necessary to identify long-term, cumulative health effects, such as
the potential to cause cancer, promote birth defects, affect reproduction, or
harm the nervous system. Without laboratory animals, scientists would lose a
fundamental method for obtaining the data needed to make wise decisions about
potential health risks.<p>
The PHS agencies support many initiatives to develop and validate systems to
reduce dependency on animal testing. Scientists have become skilled in
culturing a wide variety of tissue and organ cells outside the living body (in
vitro) and in writing computer programs that simulate human and animal
systems.<p>
Human and animal cell cultures are being used increasingly to screen toxic
substances before progressing to whole-animal testing. When in vitro studies
show that a substance is toxic, testing it in animals may not be necessary.
Computer models are also being used to help predict the properties of
substances and their probable actions in living systems. Although
computers can store and analyze enormous amounts of data, some information must
come from experimental animals. These non-animal research tools have reduced
our dependence on animals, but they cannot completely replace experimental
animals for the foreseeable future.<p>
Toxicologists have the responsibility  to treat laboratory animals with great
care and compassion. Today, all projects involving animal testing supported by
funds from the PHS must comply with the regulations of the Animal Welfare Act,
as amended, and the Health Research Extension Act. These laws were
enacted to protect research animals. An institution that uses
laboratory animals for any purpose must operate a sound animal care program.
The PHS fosters quality control in animal care and has a high regard for
the welfare of laboratory animals.<p>
The American people want assurance that the products they use in
recovery from illness and daily living are safe; the U.S. Congress has
enacted laws that require the safety of products; and the scientific
community endeavors to promote the public health through animal testing. Dr.
James O. Mason, Assistant Secretary  for Health, has put it this way: "Whole
animals are essential in research and testing because they best reflect the
dynamic interactions between the various cells, tissues, and organs comprising
the human body."<p>
The number of products used by society has increased greatly since animal
testing began, but adverse health effects are relatively uncommon. This is, in
itself, compelling evidence for the predictive value of animal testing of
products for human use.<p>

<b>EFFECTIVENESS:</b><P>
NADA 065-140 was originally approved as safe for use as
labeled on July 5, 1966. The drug was the subject of National Academy of
Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) reports which were published in
the <b>FEDERAL REGISTER</b> of July 8, 1970 (<B>35 FR 10966</B>). The Academy
evaluated this drug as probably effective for oral treatment of animal diseases
when such diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms sensitive to
tetracycline hydrochloride, diseases such as: (1)Enteric and respiratory
diseases in poultry (2) gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in swine; (3)
infected wounds, gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in calves, sheep,
and goats; (4) digestive system and respiratory diseases, pyelonephritis,
peritonitis, infected wounds, abscesses, ulcers, and secondary bacterial
invaders in dogs and cats; (5) coccidiosis in dogs; and (6) hexamitiasis in
turkeys.<P>
The Academy concluded that: ( 1 ) Most of the dosage directions provide for a
less than effective dose, and the recommended minimum oral dose for large
animals is 10 milligrams per pound of body weight daily in divided doses and
for small animals 25 milligrams per pound of body weight in divided doses; (2)
claims for the treatment of viral diseases must be limited to microorganisms
belonging to the psittacosis-lymphogranuloma group; (3) each disease claim
should be properly qualified as "appropriate for use in (name of disease)
caused by pathogens sensitive to (name of drug), "and if the disease cannot be
so qualified the claim must be dropped; (4) claims made "for prevention of" or
"to prevent" should be replaced with "as an aid in the control of" or
"to aid in the control of"; (5) as applicable, the manufacturer's label should
warn that treated animals must actually consume enough medicated water or
medicated feed to provide a therapeutic dose under the conditions that prevail;
as a precaution, the label should state the desired oral dose per unit of
animal weight per day for each species as a guide to effective use of the
preparation in drinking water or feed.<P>
The Food and Drug Administration concurs with the Academy's findings,
interpreting the phrase "...cannot be so qualified..." in paragraph (3) to mean
"...is not supported by adequate data..." (See <B>Fed. Reg. vol. 35, NO. 131-Wed.,
July 8, 1970</B>). FDA proceeded to review all available data relating to the
effectiveness of products subject to NADA 065-140 to determine which label
claims were supported by the requisite proof of effectiveness. That review
resulted in a letter to the sponsor dated July 1, 1992, in which the agency
stated that it had concluded that such data supported effectiveness only for
the control and treatment of certain bacterial diseases susceptible to
tetracycline hydrochloride in calves, swine, chickens and turkeys.<P>
Thereafter, the sponsor complied with the evaluation of NAS/NRC and FDA's
conclusions in the following manner:<P>
1.	The appropriate oral dose of 10 mg per pound body weight daily in certain
species has been incorporated in the labeling. The 25 mg per pound body weight
is appropriate for chickens and turkeys.<P>
2.	Claims for viral diseases have been deleted from the labeling completely.<P>
3.	Each disease claim on the label has been properly qualified with the
appropriate genus and species of bacteria susceptible to tetracycline
hydrochloride. Disease claims which were not so qualified have been deleted.<P>
4.	Claims made for prevention have been revised to read "Control of..." where
appropriate.<P>
5.	The manufacturer's label carries the warning statement that treated animals
must have the medicated water adjusted to compensate for variation in age and
the weight of the animal, the nature and severity of disease signs, and
environmental temperature and humidity, each of which affects water
consumption.<P>
<b>ANIMAL SAFETY:</b><P>
 NADA 065-140 was originally approved as safe on July 5,
1966. No further safety data <i> </i>are required.<P>
<b>HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><P>
 The NAS/NRC evaluation of the drug is concerned only
with the effectiveness and safety of the drug for the treated animal. FDA's
approval of the supplemental application did not involve reevaluation or
reaffirmation of the human food safety data in the parent application.<P>
 <B>&#167  556.720 Tetracycline</b><P>
A tolerance of 0.25 part per million has already been established for
negligible residues of tetracycline in uncooked edible tissues of calves,
swine, sheep, chickens, and turkeys.<P>
Withdrawal times: 5 days (calves), 4 days (swine, chickens and turkeys).<P>
<b>AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><P>
This supplemental NADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrates that TET-SOL 324 Tetracycline Soluble Powder when used under its
proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for the labeled indications
for use in calves, swine, chickens and turkeys.<P>
The "probably effective" finding of the NAS/NRC regarding Tetracycline
hydrochloride which was published in the <b>FEDERAL REGISTER</b> of July 8,
1970, was subsequently reviewed by FDA, resulting in the upgrade to "effective"
status with respect to the claims noted in the previous paragraph. The firm
submitted revised labeling to conform and, therefore, this supplemental NADA
complies with the NAS/NRC evaluation and FDA's conclusions.<P>
TET-SOL 324 for use in food-producing animals is currently on the market as an
over-the-counter product. When the NADA was reviewed under NAS / NRC / DESI
program, it was an over-the-counter product and this marketing status remains
unchanged. Therefore, the Center for Veterinary Medicine has concluded that
this product should retain over-the-counter marketing status.<P>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is
a Category II change. The approval of this change is not expected to have any
adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug and,
therefore, did not require a reevaluation of the human food or target animal
safety data in the parent application.<P>
Under the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988, this
approval does not qualify for an exclusivity period under section
512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b
(c)(2)(F)(iii)) because the supplemental application does not contain reports
of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue
studies), and in the case of food producing animals, human food safety studies
(other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval and
conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<P>

<b>Objective:</b>  To document, in onchocerciasis patients, the safety and efficacy of treatment with ivermectin.<P> 
<b>Study Design:</b>   A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled study
comparing three doses of ivermectin (100, 150 and 200 &#181;g/kg).  Enrollment
criteria specified hospitalized male and female patients, 12 to 60 years of age
with moderate or severe infections  with <i>Onchocerca volvulus </i>but
otherwise in good health.  Patients were monitored, in hospital, for adverse
signs.  Safety endpoints included ophthalmologic examinations, physical
examinations, hematology, blood chemistry and urinalysis.  A total of 1278
patients were treated as follows:  ivermectin at 100 &#181;g/kg (319), 150 &#181;g/kg (322), 200 &#181;g/kg (322), placebo (315).<P><b>Safety Report:</b>  All doses of ivermectin were well tolerated.  As expected,
adverse reactions related to microfilarial death were common.  Overall, 47.6 to
52.8% of persons in the treatment groups, and 29.8% of persons in the placebo
group showed clinical adverse experiences.   None of these were considered
serious, and no persons were discontinued from the study.  There was an episode
of transient hypotension in a person taking anti-hypertensive therapy and
choloroquine, not thought to be drug-related, and an isolated episode of
possible hypoglycemia.<P><b>3. An open study of the Tolerability, Safety and Efficacy of Single Oral 150 &#181;g/kg doses of ivermectin (MK-933) in children 5 to 12 years of age with onchocerciasis.</b><P><b>Study # 5544, Protocol # 545-00<P>Investigator:</b>  Professor M. Lariviere, M.D., University of Paris.<P><b>Site:</b>  Odienne Hospital, Ivory Coast<P><b>Objective:</b>  To investigate, in children 5 to 12 years of age and infected with
<i>O. volvulus, </i>the tolerability, laboratory and clinical safety, and
efficacy of a single oral dose (150 mg/kg) of ivermectin.<P><b>Study Design:</b>  An open study in male (n=71) and female (n=32) children with
onchocerciasis and otherwise in good health.   All patients were hospitalized
for at least seven days following administration of ivermectin and monitored
for adverse signs. Safety endpoints  included ophthalmologic  examination,
physical examination, hematology, blood chemistry and urinalysis.<P><b>Safety Report:</b>  Ivermectin was well tolerated.  The most common clinical
experience was headache and myalgia.  No clinical adverse reactions were
considered serious and no laboratory adverse experiences  were  reported.<P><b>4.  Signs of ivermectin toxicosis in man.</b><P>Results of accidental overdosing with ivermectin - containing veterinary products suggest that the acute signs and symptoms of ivermectin intoxication in man are similar to those observed in laboratory animals, however, the doses required to elicit these signs are higher in man.<P><b>Ivermectin Adverse Reactions Database</b><P>Clinical Summaries Case Report # 00014493.<P>A two-year old male ingested a quantity of IVOMEC&#174; injectable formulation for cattle (10 mg/ml of ivermectin) and received an estimated ivermectin dosage of approximately 6-8 mg/kg.  The patient exhibited
drowsiness, ataxia, vomiting, mydriasis, right bundle branch block, ventricular
ectopy and weakness.  The child recovered with no apparent after affects.<P>
Clinical Summaries Case Report # 00052048.<P>
A 16-year old male was reported to have ingested 11.5 ml of the IVOMEC&#174; Injectable formulation for cattle.  Symptoms included mydriasis,
vomiting, pallor, tachycardia, somnolence, variable blood pressure and
urticaria.  On follow-up, the patient was noted to have recovered from all
symptoms with the possible exception of urticaria.  Exposure was estimated at
115 mg total dose or 10X the therapeutic human dose of ivermectin.<P><b>B. Safe Concentration Of Residues</b><P>The safe concentration for drug residues represents the amount of drug, parent and metabolites, which can be consumed daily throughout a lifetime.<P><b>Allowable Daily Intake</b><P>These human studies support the findings of the laboratory animal toxicity
studies with ivermectin that indicate that the primary human food safety
concern for ivermectin is related to its neurotoxic effects.  The human clinical
database on ivermectin also indicated that the mouse teratology study, which
was used to establish the safe concentration in the original approval, is not
the most appropriate model for this calculation.  Considering the results of
the standard battery of toxicology studies conducted with ivermectin, and the
information obtained in the human studies, the 90-day dog study with a NOEL of
0.5 mg/kg/day for neurotoxicity is a more appropriate study for establishing
the safe concentration for ivermectin.<P>The subchronic and chronic effects of ivermectin were quantitatively similar.
Therefore, the 1000-fold safety factor, which is generally applied to the
90-day studies to extrapolate to chronic exposure, is inappropriate.  Rather, a
500-fold safety factor is assigned to the NOEL of 0.5 mg/kg/day obtained in the
90-day dog study.  The new ADI for ivermectin is  0.5 mg/kg/day divided by 500
or 1 &#181;g/kg/day.<P><b>Safe  Concentration</b><P>A safe concentration in muscle of cattle is calculated from the acceptable daily intake; assuming the average weight of man to be 60 kg and the daily human intake of muscle to be 500 grams.
<pre>

                                 (60  kg) (1 &#181;g/kg/day)
Safe concentration in muscle=    ---------------------- = 120 ppb
                                       500 g/day

</pre>
The safe concentration of residues in liver, kidney and fat are derived from
this number using appropriate food consumption values (food factors) for these
tissues:<P>
Liver:  120 ppb X 2 (food factor) = 240 ppb<P>Kidney:  120 ppb X 3 (food factor) = 360 ppb<P>Fat:  120 ppb X 4 (food factor) = 480 ppb<P><b>Injection  Site</b><P>Ingestion of an entire injection site from an IVOMEC-treated animal is
considered an unlikely event.  The human food safety assessment of injection
site exposures is based on acute toxicity of ivermectin.  Clinical studies
conducted in healthy non-parasitized  volunteers demonstrate that a 15 mg
oral dose of ivermectin is well tolerated.  Applying a ten-fold safety factor
to this 15 mg oral dose and a consumption value of 500 grams results in a safe
concentration of 3 ppm at injection sites.<P><b>C. Metabolism And Total Residue Depletion Studies</b><P>Section 6.C. of the Freedom of Information Summary issued at the time of
approval (February 13, 1984) of IVOMEC&#174; (ivermectin) Injection
for cattle describes metabolism of 3H labeled MK-933 in cattle,
comparative metabolism in rats and total residue depletion from edible tissues.
No additional total residue depletion or metabolism studies were provided in
this supplement.  Residue data generated in radiolabeled study RN-190 was used
to recalculate the tolerance (See Below).<P><b>D. Recalculation Of The Tolerance</b><P>The residue data generated in RN-190 was used to calculate the tolerance for
residues of ivermectin H2B1a (marker substance) in cattle liver (marker tissue)
based upon a safe concentration of 240 ppb for total residues of ivermectin.
Based upon results of that study, ivermectin Bla represents approximately 42
percent of the total ivermectin residues in liver when residues are at the safe
concentration of 240 ppb.  The tolerance for the marker residue derived from
that relationship is 100 ppb (42 percent of 240 ppb = 100.8 ppb).<P><b>E. Studies Demonstrating A Withdrawal Period</b><P>A tissue residue depletion study (ASR 13527) was conducted to determine the
marker residue (H2Bla) concentrations in edible tissues of cattle at times following treatment with IVOMEC&#174; injection for cattle
injected subcutaneously at the recommended use level.  Crossbred, beef type
cattle, aged 12-14 months and weighing between 287 and 401 kg were used.  Six
male castrates and six females were slaughtered on each of days 21, 28, 35, 42,
49 and 56.  Six untreated cattle (3 male castrates, 3 females) served as controls.  Marker residue assays were conducted on liver tissue and injection site samples using the high performance liquid chromatography fluorescence
determinative  assay  method.<P>

</pre>
Statistical analysis of the residue depletion data generated in ASR 13527, using the tolerance of 100 ppb in liver, yields a withdrawal period of 34 days.  However, the <b>official withdrawal</b> period is set at <b>35 days</b> as the 35-day sacrifice group in study 13527 was the first group in which all injection site residues were below the safe concentration (3 ppm) assigned for residues of ivermectin at the injection site.<P>
<b>VII. Agency Conclusions</b><P>The data submitted in support of this supplement satisfy the requirements of
Section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA).  Based on the
additional toxicology data submitted, the tolerance for ivermectin Bla in
cattle liver has been changed from 15 ppb to 100 ppb and a 35-day withdrawal
period in cattle has been calculated.<P>Although the human data are limited to acute (therapeutic/accidental) exposure
to ivermectin, it appears that neurotoxicity is the endpoint of toxicological
concern.  The agency established the drug's safe concentration on the animal
model which was the best predictor of this toxic endpoint.<P>Under the Center's supplemental approval policy [21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)], this is
a Category II change.  The approval of this change is not expected to have any
adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug.
Accordingly, this approval did not require a reevaluation of the safety and
effectiveness data in the parent application.<P>Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the FFDCA, this approval for food producing
animals does not qualify for marketing exclusivity because the supplemental
application does not contain new clinical or field investigations (other than
bioequivalence or residue studies) and new human food safety studies (other
than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval and conducted
or sponsored by the applicant.

<p>
The purpose of the studies was to determine the effect of Synovex &#174;
 S when reimplanted at day 70 on rate of weight gain and feed efficiency
in feedlot steers. At each location, 96 medium-frame beef steers were allocated
to three groups on the basis of weight in a randomized complete block design (4
blocks of 3 pens with 8 steers per pen). The animals were blocked on the basis
of initial weight. Group 1 (-/-)consisted of non-implanted steers (controls);
Group 2 (S/-) steers were administered Synovex S implants on day 1 (beginning
of feeding period); Group 3 (S/S) animals were implanted with Synovex S
implants on days 1 and 70. Average initial weights of animals at the three
locations ranged from 734 to 748 pounds. The animaIs were slaughtered when
visual inspection suggested that approximately 70% would grade USDA Choice.
Average daily gain and feed efficiency data are summarized in Table 1 for each
of the three studies:<P>

<br>
A randomized complete block design was used for all studies and the data were
pooled by analysis of variance to determine the significance of the effect of
reimplanting Synovex &#174;   S on average daily gain and feed
efficiency. Steers implanted with 
Synovex &#174;   S on days 1 and 70 were shown to be better than
nonimplanted controls (P &#60 &#32 0.001) and better than steers implanted only on
day 1 (P &#60 &#32 0.05) for average daily gain. Feed efficiency of animals
implanted on day 1 or on days 1 and 70 was significantly better than that of
non-implanted controls (P &#60 &#32 0.05) but no differences were observed between
the two implanted groups. These data indicate that the replantation of
Synovex &#174;   S is effective for increasing weight gain in steers
fed in confinement for slaughter.<P>
The effects of treatment on carcass parameters (dressing percent, yield grade,
quality grade, and marbling score), and on the incidence of liver abscesses
were evaluated at slaughter. A reduction in marbling score and percent grading
choice was observed for the S/S group. Because of the observed decrease in
marbling scores, the following statement is required on the label: Studies have
demonstrated that reimplantation of Synovex &#174;   S can result in
decreased marbling scores when compared to non-implanted steers. No effect of
treatment was seen on dressing percent, yield grade, or the incidence of liver
abscesses.<P>
<B>5. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY</B><P>
Pivotal Studies: <P>
A. Drug Tolerance Study:<P>
A drug tolerance study was conducted by Dr. Donald E. Bidlack, Department of
Pathology, Syntex Research, 3401 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, CA. The purpose of
the study was to evaluate the acute effects of exaggerated overdosing on
steers. Three mixed beef-breed steers averaging 325 kg were assigned to the
study. Two of the steers received 21 consecutive daily subcutaneous injections
of 75 mg estradiol benzoate and 75 mg progesterone in sesame oil. This dose was
estimated to be approximately 25 times the release rate for estradiol benzoate
and progesterone from Synovex &#174;   S implants. The control steer
received subcutaneous injection of sesame oil (vehicle) for the same period.
Observations and laboratory measurements continued for two weeks after the end
of dosing. All steers were euthanized and necropsied at study termination. All
preserved tissues were examined microscopically.<P>
    Changes associated with the treatment regimen were seen in the two steers
that received estradiol benzoate and progesterone. Sexual behavior,
characterized by posturing (placing the head on the back or rump of
another animal) or mounting (as if to breed) was seen in one or both
treated steers on study days 10, 30, and/or 35 when cattle were allowed to
commingle. Subtle tailhead prominence was present, concurrent with relaxation
of the perirectal musculature, in one treated steer. Slight eversion of rectal
mucosa or rectal prolapse was present in the treated steers. The condition was
observed while the animals were lying down, but it corrected spontaneously when
the animals were standing.<P>
Body weight gains, feed consumption, heart rates, and rumen activity were not
adversely affected by the treatment regimen. The treated steers gained an
average of 64.5 kg during the study while the control steer gained 39 kg.
Sporadic swelling of some of the injection sites, considered to be associated
with the nature of the sesame oil formulations, was present in all steers,
including the control animal.<P>
Other changes were observed clinically, but were considered related to
intercurrent conditions and unrelated to the treatment regimen.<P>
Alkaline phosphatase levels were increased in both treated steers beginning
with study day 10. In the absence of significant histopathologic changes, the
alkaline phosphatase increases were not considered relevant.<P>
No gross histopathologic changes attributable to systemic effects of estradiol
benzoate/progesterone were present in any tissues. The local swellings of some
of the injection sites were characterized microscopically by mixed leukocytic
infiltration and fibrosis. Oil droplets were present in the sections. These
changes were considered associated with subcutaneous injections of sesame
oil.<P>
B. Drug Safety Study:<P>
A target animal safety study was conducted by Dr. James Sheldon, CAVL, Inc.,
P.O. Box 1296, Casa Grande, AZ. The purpose of the study was to assess the
safety to feedlot cattle of Synovex &#174;   S when reimplantation
occurred. Thirty-six beef-type steers with an initial mean weight of 200.6 kg
were allotted to four treatment groups, with each group composed of three
replicate pens of three steers (9 steers per treatment group). Steers were
implanted with Synovex &#174;   S in multiples of the clinically
recommended dose. Groups were designated as follows: Group 1 - Sham control;
Group 2 - 1X Synovex &#174;   S; Group 3 - 3X Synovex &#174;
 S; Group 4 - 5X Synovex &#174;   S. The steers were implanted on
study day 1 and reimplanted on study day 63. The cattle were fed a
roughage/concentrate ration typical for cattle in confinement. Body weights
(fasted) and feed consumption were recorded at approximately monthly intervals
and at study termination for this 206-day study. Hematology and serum chemistry
determinations were made at the same intervals. The animals were observed daily
and the clinical condition of the animals was recorded weekly and when a change
in clinical condition was observed. At study termination, gross pathologic
examinations were conducted on all animals. Protocol-specified tissues were
preserved in 10% formalin and archived.<P>
No Synovex &#174;   S treatment-related deaths occurred during the
study. One steer died of pneumonia on study day 6 and was replaced (study day
7). There were no clinical abnormalities in steers attributable to
Synovex &#174;   S treatment. Changes associated with
restraint-related injuries were present. Implant retention was satisfactory,
but edema and/or abscessation of the implant site occurred in 1 or 2 animals in
groups 1, 3, and 4. There were no clinically significant effects of
Synovex &#174;   S on hematologic or serum chemistry parameters during
the study. No Synovex &#174;   S treatment-related effects were
observed for body weight gain, dry matter feed intake, or feed efficiency. No
gross pathologic changes attributable to Synovex &#174;   S treatment
were present.<P>

Progesterone) at 70 Days After Initial Implantation in Steers.</b><p>
The permitted increments of estradiol concentrations above those concentrations
naturally present in untreated steers are: 120 ppt for muscle; 480 ppt for fat;
360 ppt for kidney; and 240 ppt for liver (<B>21 CFR 556.240</B>).<P>
The permitted increments of progesterone concentrations above those
concentrations naturally present in untreated steers are: 3 ppb for muscle; 12
ppb for fat; 9 ppb for kidney; and 6 ppb for liver (<B>21 CFR 556.540</B>).<P>

<b>Residue Study in Steers Implanted with a Single Implant:</b><p>
After a single Synovex &#174;   S implant in 58 steers weighing
approximately 700 lb, steers were slaughtered and tissues were analyzed for
estradiol and progesterone levels after 15, 30, 61, 90, and 120 days. The data
indicated that the concentrations of estradiol and progesterone in edible
tissues of steers implanted with Synovex &#174;   S were well below
the permitted levels at all time points (see Table 2 on following page).<P>

Based
on these data, the maximum levels of estradiol and progesterone that would be
expected in edible tissues of steers reimplanted with Synovex &#174;
 S approximately 60 days after the initial implant were estimated. We used
observed values at 61 days after a single implant as baseline. The tissue
values at 61 days were added to the tissue values at 15 days after the first
implant minus the control value. For estradiol, the calculated worst case
values after reimplantation with Synovex &#174;   S were 78.2 ppt for
fat, 16.2 ppt for muscle, 9.0 ppt for liver, and 18.5 ppt for kidney. The
allowable concentrations above background are 480 ppt for fat, 120 ppt for
muscle, 240 ppt for liver, and 360 ppt for kidney. The ratios of the worst case
estradiol concentrations following reimplantation to the maximum concentrations
after the initial implant were 1.9, 1.7, 1.3, and 1.4 for fat, muscle, liver,
and kidney, respectively. These worst case estimates were supported by a study
in which blood levels of estradioI were measured in cattle reimplanted with
Synovex &#174;   S after 63 days. The worst cast estimates for
progesterone levels after reimplantation were all well below the permissible
concentrations.<P>
<b>Steer Plasma Hormone Concentrations After Reimplantation:</b><br>
 <br>
The plasma study was conducted on steers weighing approximately 450 lb. Nine
steers were treated with a Synovex &#174;   S implant on study day-1
and day-63. Nine untreated steers served as controls. Blood was collected on
days: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 63, 64, 66, 69, 76, 83, 90, 104, 125, 140,
168, and 206. Plasma samples were analyzed for estradiol and progesterone.<P>
<i>Highest Mean (peak) Plasma Levels. </i>The results showed that following the
first implantation, the highest mean concentration of plasma estradiol was 57.8
pg/mL on day-63 just before reimplantation. The highest mean concentration of
estradiol after reimplantation was 99.2 pg/mL on day-104 (approximately 40 days
after reimplantation). The ratio of these values was 1.7. Following the first
implantation, the highest mean concentration of progesterone was 1186 pg/ml on
day-21 and after reimplantation, the highest mean concentration was 1910 pg/ml
on day-206 (ratio = 1.6). <br>
 <br>
<i>Overall Mean Plasma Levels.  </i>The overall mean plasma levels of estradiol
and progesterone during the two time periods were calculated. For estradiol,
the mean plasma level for days 1-63 was 38.2 pg/mL, and the mean plasma level
for days 64-125 was 53.5 pg/mL. For progesterone, the mean plasma levels for
corresponding days were 766 pg/mL and 995 pg/mL, respectively. Hence, the
ratios of the mean plasma levels after the second implant to the first implant
yielded 1.4 for estradiol and 1.3 for progesterone.<P>
<i>Area Under the Curve (AUC) Plasma Levels. </i>The AUCs for estradiol and
progesterone after the first and the second implant were calculated. For
estradiol, the AUC for days 1-63 was 2258, and the AUC for days 64-128 was
3746. The ratio of these AUCs was 1.66. For progesterone, the AUC for days 1-63
was 53858, and the AUC for days 64-128 was 67340. The ratio of these AUCs was
1.25.<P>
As explained above, for edible tissues, the ratios of the calculated worst case
values after reimplantation to the maximum concentrations following a single
implant were no greater than 2 for both estradiol and progesterone. The data
for<b> </b>plasma hormone concentrations are therefore consistent with
calculated values for<b> </b>edible tissues. Taken together, these data show
that tissue hormone levels would not reach violative levels in steers following
reimplantation of Synovex&#174;  S 63 days after the initial implant. Since we
do not anticipate that the hormone levels resulting from reimplantation after
63 days and 70 days would be significantly different, we conclude that residues
of estradiol and progesterone following reimplantation of Synovex&#174;
increases above endogenous levels and do not pose any human food safety
concern.<P>
<B>7. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</B><P>
Adequate data were provided to demonstrate the safe and effective use of
Synovex &#174;   S when reimplanted at approximately day 70 for
additional improvement in rate of weight gain in steers fed in confinement for
slaughter.<P>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is
a Category II change providing for the reimplantation of Synovex &#174;
 S in steers fed in confinement for slaughter. The approval of this change
is not expected to have any adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of
this new animal drug. Accordingly, this approval did not require a reevaluation
of the safety and effectiveness data in the parent application.<P>
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval for food producing animals qualifies for three years of marketing
exclusivity beginning on the date of approval because the supplemental
application contains reports of new clinical investigations (other than
bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval of the application
and conducted or sponsored by the applicant. The three years of marketing
exclusivity applies only to the change in the labeling (providing for the
reimplantation of Synovex &#174;   S at approximately day 70 in steers
fed in confinement for slaughter) for which the supplemental application was
approved.<P>

<A NAME="RTFToC2">REGULATION
OF ANIMAL ELECTRONIC IDENTIFICATION PRODUCTS
</A></H3>
<P>
<I>CVM has received a number of inquiries about how the Agency regulates
implantable electronic identification devices for use in animals.  The
following is an update on this subject.  This applies only to implantable
electronic identification products intended for the sole purpose of animal
identification.</I><BR>
<P>
Implantable electronic identification device (EID) products that are used to
identify individual animals are being developed by several companies.  The
products consist of a very small transponder which is implanted in the body of
the animal (in the ear, for example), and a component (reader) that interprets
the transmission from the transponder.  <P>

<H4>
<A NAME="RTFToC3">CVM
supports the development and use of animal identification products....
</A></H4>
<P>
    CVM supports the development and use of animal identification products and
believes that these products can produce benefits for livestock producers, the
agricultural industry, regulatory agencies, and consumers.  Proper
identification of animals at slaughter makes possible traceback of the
slaughtered animal to its source.  This traceback greatly facilitates FDA's
investigations to determine cause and responsibility when residues of drugs or
chemical contaminants are found in edible tissue.  Presently, FDA staff is
working with manufacturers of implantable EID products to facilitate their
availability.<P>
    Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), FDA may regulate
implantable EIDs intended for use in animals as food additives.  A food
additive is defined by the Act as "any substance, the intended use of which
results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, in its
becoming or otherwise affecting the characteristics of any food."  Also, under
the Act, food includes animal feed.<P>
    To ensure public health and the safety of the food supply, FDA has determined
that EIDs must not be implanted in an edible portion of an animal unless a
<I>human food additive</I> regulation for this use has been published.
Noncompliance with this requirement would render the food product adulterated
and subject to FDA regulatory action.  Currently, no human food additive
petitions have been approved for EIDs intended to be implanted in an edible
portion of any animal, nor does FDA anticipate approving any of these types of
petitions because of the kinds of component materials currently present in
EIDs. <P>
    Nonedible portions of slaughtered animals are routinely rendered to become
part of animal feed.  Unless the implanted EID unit is removed and properly
discarded prior to rendering, it likely will become part of animal feed.
Therefore, implantable EID products that might become part of feed are
regulated by FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) as <I>animal food
additives</I>.<P>
    In some specific cases, CVM may exercise enforcement discretion and not take
regulatory action against the use of an animal food additive that is not
covered by a food additive regulation.  With regard to EIDs intended for
implantation in nonedible portion of animals (such as ears and ligaments), CVM
may exercise its enforcement discretion and not take regulatory action if
manufacturers provide safety information on each implantable model intended for
marketing.  The information must be adequate to assure that there are no human
food safety concerns arising from the consumption of products (meat, milk, or
eggs) from animals that have consumed feed containing rendered products with
EID component material.  Further, the information must be adequate to assure
that there are no environmental concerns associated with the proposed use.  If
the human food safety and environmental safety concerns are satisfactorily
addressed, the Agency will notify the manufacturer in writing that, as a matter
of regulatory discretion, sale of the specific model EID may take place without
an animal food additive regulation.<P>
    To assure that the implant will not enter human food, the implantation site
should be in an area that will minimize potential for migration to edible
tissue.  The EID manufacturer must receive concurrence from U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) as to the acceptability of the implantation site(s).  <P>
    At this time, there is no acceptable implantation site for swine.  This is
because all portions of the pig may be used for human food.  An alternative for
swine would be to incorporate the EID in a plastic ear tag that could be
removed at slaughter.<P>
    CVM does not require data (human food safety or environmental safety) from
firms marketing implantable EID products solely for pet animals (e.g., dogs,
cats, pet birds), including horses that will not be used for food purposes, and
laboratory animals.  These products may be marketed at this time.  <P>
    Questions about CVM's electronic identification device policy may be directed
to Richard E. Jewell, CVM Division of Compliance, Case Guidance Branch, 7500
Standish Place, HFV-236, Rockville, MD 20855, or by calling (301) 594-1785.  
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC4">FDA'S
VIEW ON THE USE OF NON-TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS IN ANIMAL FEEDS
</A></H3>
<P>
<I>The following are excerpts from a presentation made by Daniel G. McChesney,
Ph.D., Leader of CVM's Feed Safety Team, at the Food Waste Recycling Symposium
held January 22 &amp; 23, 1996, in Atlantic City, New Jersey.</I><BR>
<P>
FDA has primary responsibility in the Federal government for food safety in the
United States.  The Agency enforces the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(FFDCA), and food safety related aspects of the Public Health Service Act
(PHSA).  Under these Acts, FDA is responsible for ensuring that human foods and
animal feeds are safe and, among other things, do not contain illegal residues
of drugs, pesticides, environmental contaminants, or microorganisms, including
mycotoxins and bacterial toxins, that are harmful to public health.  The
Department of Agriculture (USDA) is responsible for the safety of human food
products resulting from the slaughter of food animals.<P>
    FDA has widespread responsibilities to help ensure preharvest food safety
under these Acts.  For example, one mission of FDA's Center for Veterinary
Medicine (CVM) is to regulate the levels of contaminants permitted in animal
feeds to ensure that the food for man and animals is safe and free of illegal
drugs, industrial chemicals, pesticide residues, and harmful bacteria. <P>
    The FFDCA defines food as "articles used for food or drink for man or other
animals . . . and articles used for components of any such article."
Therefore, any waste product, garbage, by-product or co-product, regardless of
source, that is intended to be used as a feed ingredient or becomes part of an
ingredient or feed is considered a "food" under the FFDCA and thus subject to
regulation.  Furthermore, it is the position of FDA that a product intended for
use as a feed or feed ingredient must not be adulterated as defined by Section
402 of the FFDCA.  The Act has numerous provisions for establishing
adulteration.  The most appropriate subsections of the Act that apply to
garbage, waste products, by-products and co-products state, in part, that a
food (feed) shall be deemed to be adulterated "if it bears or contains any
poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health" and
that "a food shall be deemed to be adulterated if it is otherwise unfit for
food (feed)."  Additionally, the FFDCA states that a food (feed or feed
ingredient) can be considered adulterated if "it bears or contains any food
additive which is unsafe (unapproved) with in the meaning of Section 409."<P>
    The definition of food and the regulations referred to above have important
implications for companies or municipalities wishing to market garbage, waste
products, by-products or co-products as an animal feed or feed ingredient.
These companies or municipalities must realize that they are producing a food
product and have an obligation to produce a safe and wholesome product.  In
order to be able to do this, they must consider the source, the ingredients,
and the quality of the ingredients used in the principal product and ensure
that these do not result in garbage, waste products, by-products or co-products
that will cause the adulteration of the feed, feed ingredient or animal tissue,
or human food.<P>
    The potential economic and resource conservation benefits for using
non-traditional sources for animal feed ingredients and feed can be
substantial.  The variety of waste products, by-products and co-products that
are being considered for use in animal feed is growing rapidly, and with
improvements in processing technology and their application, the FDA
anticipates even more rapid growth in the future.  Government, whether it be
Federal or State, cannot  develop regulations rapidly enough to address each
product and the nuances associated with it.  Therefore, an approach that
establishes basic safety requirements, product identity, and removes government
as the quality control department for a company or municipality is needed.  In
the "traditional" animal feed industry, Federal and State governments have
established regulatory guidance (tolerances, action levels) for safety related
issues and the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), has
established definitions for product identity.  Industry has the primary
responsibility for quality assurance and producing an unadulterated product.
Government's role is one of oversight to ensure that industry is fulfilling its
role.<P>

<H4>
    
<A NAME="RTFToC5">HACCP</A></H4>
<P>
    To address the quality assurance issue, FDA suggests that manufacturers
implement a HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points) program to address
safety issues associated with their product.<P>
    FDA chose the HACCP approach because it is preventative and addresses the root
causes of food safety problems including those associated with production,
storage, and transportation.  Furthermore, the HACCP approach requires the
manufacturer to analyze, in a rational, scientific manner, its production
processes in order to identify critical control points.  Essential parts of
industry's role under HACCP are to establish critical limits and monitoring
procedures, and to maintain records documenting adherence to the critical
limits related to the identified critical control points.  Meeting these
requirements results in continuous self-inspections by industry.  Analysis and
control is confirmed by government oversight of the industry's monitoring.  As
such, a HACCP-based approach provides an appropriate balance between the
responsibilities of industry and government in ensuring food safety.<P>
    The following are examples of FDA's views on non-traditional products proposed
for use in animal feeds.
<H4> 
<A NAME="RTFToC6">Concerns
and Evaluation Criteria
</A></H4>
<P>
    CVM's principal concerns over the use of garbage, waste products, by-products,
or co-products are related to the poorly defined nature of the product; the
numerous sources that can range from restaurants, to laundries, to industrial
manufacturers; the collection vehicles/receptacles which can vary from
dedicated trucks and receptacles to collection by the same trucks used to pump
septic systems;  the variety of contaminants possible; and the level of
control (or lack of control) encompassed by local, and State laws/regulations.
<P>
    In addition to the concerns stated above, the processing of potentially
recyclable material can vary from minimal with no testing for contaminants to
commercial processing, such as rendering, with pesticide and chemical screens.
Clearly, with all these variables, regulating this portion of the recycling
industry is challenging.  Regulating the materials on an other than a
case-by-case basis at the Federal level is currently not feasible.<P>
    Case-by-case evaluations are currently made by FDA regarding the safety of
these products and their compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act.  The evaluations do not address whether the collection, disposal and
processing of these products comply with State, local, or other Federal laws
which might apply to waste disposal. <P>
    The safety evaluations are currently made using all available information.
This information includes, but is not limited to, the source (i.e. restaurants,
food processors, etc.); the contaminants present or likely to be present;  the
process used in processing the material for animal feed; screening procedures
for detecting chemical, microbiological, and filth contaminants; collection
methods/vehicles; and agreements between the supplier and processor outlining
the suppliers responsibilities for preventing contamination of the recyclable
material.
<H4><A NAME="RTFToC7">Grease</A></H4>
<P>
    FDA is opposed to the use of sewer grease or any product which has come in
contact with or passed through the same drain as sanitary sewer water or solid
matter as a component of human or animal food.  Furthermore, the Agency is also
opposed to the use of grease of unknown origin as a component of human or
animal food.  FDA affirmed this position through regulatory action in August
1990 in which a Warning Letter was issued to a Colorado firm and again in 1994
with Warning letters to firms in Georgia and Alabama.  The basis for issuance
of the Warning Letters was that sewer grease or grease of unknown origin are
"unfit for food" and therefore adulterated because the potential contaminants
could not be known with any certainty.  The FDA position specifically addresses
sewer grease and grease of unknown origin and should not be interpreted as
unilaterally applying to all grease trap waste.<P>
    FDA is opposed to the use of grease trap waste from floor drains, pot wash
drains, dishwasher drains, sink drains, etc. in animal feed <I>unless</I> the
contaminants were known (or not present) and did not result in unsafe tissue
residues in milk, meat, and eggs or present a health hazard to animals.  The
Agency has not opposed the use in animal feed of "restaurant grease" or
"sludge" when it consists entirely of edible by-products used in, or obtained
from, the preparation of human food.<P>
    In addition to FDA guidance, the 1995 Official Publication of AAFCO includes a
Note in the Fats and Oils section and definitions addressing this issue.
<H4><A NAME="RTFToC8">Filter
Cake
</A></H4>
<P>
    FDA does not object to the use of a filter cake material generated from the
manufacturing of cheeses and salad dressings in animal rations for swine, beef
cattle, or poultry provided it: 1) contained only food grade chemicals and/or
chemicals approved for use on food contact surfaces; 2) was not collected or
flocculated using polyacrylimides; 3) complies with the AAFCO definition of
"Dairy Food By-Products."  Furthermore, the Agency strongly recommends that the
product to be recycled be collected at the cheese and salad dressing
manufacturer in dumpsters designated for this use, that the dumpsters are
regularly cleaned, and that the product be fed within three days of collection
because of the high potential for spoilage and production of mycotoxins.<P>
    In reaching this decision, FDA used data that were submitted directly to FDA
by the company and information supplied by the Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency. <P>

<H4>
    
<A NAME="RTFToC9">Cafeteria
Garbage
</A></H4>
<P>
    Garbage (dehydrated) is defined by AAFCO as a product  "composed of
artificially dried animal and vegetable waste (which has been) collected
sufficiently often that harmful decomposition has not set in, and from which
have been separated crockery, glass, metal, string, and similar materials.
(Further) it must be processed at a temperature sufficient to destroy all
organisms capable of producing animal diseases."  If part of the grease and fat
is removed, it must be designated as "Degreased Dehydrated Garbage."  <P>
    In general, FDA would not object to feeding a product meeting this definition,
provided it was not adulterated with a substance that would result in animal
health problems or produce residues in meat, milk, or eggs (i.e., pesticides,
industrial chemicals, pathogenic microorganisms, drug residues, etc.).<P>
    It is also worth noting that there are specific Federal regulations that deal
with the feeding of garbage to swine.  These regulations were promulgated by
USDA's Animal and Plant Inspection Service (APHIS) to address the potential for
the transmission of animal diseases.  Feeding garbage to swine requires abiding
by the regulations and obtaining a license from USDA.   <P>
    These USDA/APHIS regulations state that "No person shall feed or permit the
feeding of garbage to swine unless the garbage is treated to kill disease
organisms . . . at a facility operated by a person holding a valid license for
the treatment of garbage."  These regulations also state that "Garbage shall be
heated throughout at boiling (212 degrees F. or 100 degrees  C. at sea level)
for 30 (thirty) minutes.  Garbage shall be agitated during cooking, except in
steam cooking equipment, to ensure that the prescribed cooking temperature is
maintained throughout the cooking container for the prescribed length of time."
<P>
    An issue that has not been dealt with regard to garbage is whether it is
appropriate to include biodegradable packaging and utensils.  FDA has not
reviewed the safety of this practice because, to date, no company has requested
this nor have data been submitted for evaluation.  A product containing these
materials may not meet the AAFCO definition of garbage.    <BR>
<B></B>
<H4>
    
<A NAME="RTFToC10">Newsprint</A></H4>
<P>
    FDA has objected to the use of newsprint as a feed ingredient and as a bedding
material.  Since bedding is often consumed by the animal, the basis for this
objection is the same for both uses.  FDA initially objected to the use of
newsprint because of concerns that the process used in bleaching wood pulp
could lead to dioxin residues in the paper and that the ink may contain
chemicals that could present an animal safety problem or a residue problem in
products destined for human consumption.<BR>
 <BR>
    Over the last several years, the process of bleaching wood pulp has changed so
that FDA's concerns for dioxin contamination are minimal.  However, the problem
with inks still exists.  Several newspapers have switched to vegetable-based
inks and use  approved dyes for color.  Until this is an industry-wide
practice, the Agency will continue to object to the general use of newsprint as
a feed ingredient or bedding material.  FDA recognizes that there may be a
limited number of cases in which the particular facts and controls may enable
newsprint to be safely used.  The Agency will accept proposals for these cases
and provide a case-by-case review and opinion. <P>
    In addition to the safety concerns associated with the use of newsprint as a
feed ingredient, an AAFCO definition for the product would need to be
established prior to its use in commercial feeds.<P>

<H4>
<A NAME="RTFToC11">Distillers
Dried Grains
</A></H4>
<P>
    In April 1994, at least 4,632 cattle from 7 feedlots in Kansas became ill and
706 died.  Initial investigation showed that all the feedlots had recently
purchased and fed milo distillers dried grains and solubles (MDDGS) from a
local ethanol production facility.  An on-farm epidemiological investigation by
the Kansas State Department of Agriculture, the Kansas City District Office of
the FDA, and CVM showed that in addition to the MDDGS that all affected
feedlots were also feeding a particular ionophore antibiotic.  <P>
    The FDA investigation showed that the MDDGS was contaminated with several
analogues of two macrolide antibiotics.  Then, FDA conducted a detailed
inspection of the local ethanol production facility which showed that this
facility had processed and distilled some waste ethanol which contained two
macrolide antibiotics and several analogues.  This distillation took place
immediately prior to the outbreak of the cattle deaths.  After distillation,
the solids from the waste ethanol were added to the MDDGS and caused the MDDGS
to be contaminated with several analogues of two macrolide antibiotics.  <P>
    Finally, a feeding trial performed by Kansas State University showed
conclusively what CVM suspected following the on-farm epidemiological
investigation.  In the feeding trial, the macrolide antibiotic contaminated
MDDGS in conjunction with FDA approved amounts of the ionophore antibiotic
reproduced the clinical signs and lesions noted in the field.  The FDA approved
amounts of the ionophore antibiotic with uncontaminated MDDGS produced no ill
effects and the macrolide antibiotic contaminated MDDGS without the ionophore
antibiotic also produced no ill effects.  CVM believes that the macrolide
contaminated MDDGS may have potentated the toxic effects of the ionophore
antibiotic.<P>
    The Center for Veterinary Medicine is concerned about both animal health and
public safety.  This contamination in Kansas killed feedlot cattle and also
caused the potential for unsafe residues in the meat from surviving animals.
The contaminated MDDGS was also sold to dairies in several states and had the
potential to cause unsafe residues in the milk supply.  While the FDA tested
the milk from dairies exposed to the contaminated MDDGS and the USDA tested the
meat from exposed animals in the feedlots to assure ourselves of a safe food
supply, both agencies want to prevent the need to use limited resources to make
such determinations in the future.<P>
    This example clearly illustrates our concern with the use of garbage, waste
products, by-products, and co-products and the difficulty that there will be in
developing universal guidance to cover the numerous products likely to be
introduced on the market in the next several years.<P>
    As recycling becomes more common and non-traditional sources of ingredients
enter the animal feed market, FDA wants to stress upon this segment of industry
that they are producing a feed ingredient and have an obligation to produce a
safe and wholesome product.  Almost anything added during the process which
does not become part of the primary product could become a component of animal
feed.  Therefore, only ingredients of the highest specifications and with a
past history of safe use should be used.  Industry should review all the steps
involved in producing the feed by-products and, most importantly, avoid the use
of ingredients or processes that might result in poisonous or deleterious
substances entering animal feed.

REGULATORY DILEMMA OF NEWLY EMERGING DISEASES: BSE
</A>
                            
<A NAME="RTFToC13">by

</H3>
<I>The following article is a discussion of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE), as an example of a newly emerging disease.  The article illustrates some
of the difficulties and successes that regulators have in dealing with these
types of diseases.</I>  <P>
An emerging disease is one that is diagnosed in a new species, where the agent
has not been identified or thoroughly characterized, when the pathogenesis is
poorly understood, and where the zoonotic potential is unclear.  There is
little published research available at the time of the emergence of the
disease, and health regulators have to make decisions before further research
can be completed.  The dilemma for regulators is what precautions, such as
regulations and requirements, should be proposed to protect human and animal
health without placing unnecessary physical and economic burdens on producers,
processors, and consumers.  Regulators are forced to make these determinations
in the absence of thorough scientific studies.<P>
    In outbreaks of emerging diseases such as canine parvo virus, AIDS, and Eboli,
it has been very difficult to predict long range sequelae in order to implement
protective steps in the early stages of an epidemic.  In the absence of
historical data on agents, diseases, and epidemics, the long-term sequelae only
can be hypothesized by using other similar diseases as untested models where
the predictive power of such comparisons is unknown.  Emerging diseases, such
as BSE, pose challenges to regulators, and require interagency cooperation.<P>
    In the beginning of an outbreak of an emerging disease such as BSE, the
scientific, medical and regulatory community is at a tremendous disadvantage in
determining that an unknown agent is attacking.  The clinical signs may be
similar to a classical disease with new features or lacking others.  New
species may be affected with signs of a disease seen previously in related or
unrelated species.  A completely new syndrome unlike any seen in the past may
evolve.  Often, the measurable events can only be linked epidemiologically into
a description that can be used to propose control measures.<P>

<H4>
<A NAME="RTFToC14">Background
on BSE
</A></H4>
<P>
    BSE is a transmissible, slowly progressive, degenerative disease of the
central nervous system of adult cattle which is similar to scrapie in sheep.
This disease has a prolonged incubation period in cattle following oral
exposure (2-8 years) and, once symptoms appear, is invariably fatal.  BSE was
first recognized as a new distinct disease of cattle by researchers at the
Central Veterinary Laboratory of the British Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries, and Foods at Weybridge, England in November, 1986.  However, there
were indications that the first clinical case of BSE was observed as early as
April, 1985.  <P>
    The clinical signs of BSE involve behavioral, gait and postural abnormalities,
and usually begin with apprehension, anxiety, and fear.  Some cows may paw the
ground or continuously lick their nostrils.  There is increased reaction to
sound and touch.  A swaying gait, sometimes coupled with high stepping of the
feet, is most evident in the hind limbs.  Kicking in the parlor is also a
frequently reported sign and may be accompanied by an unexpected nervousness at
entrances.  Changes in the normal behavior of the individual cow may be
manifested as a change in the milking order, separation from the rest of the
herd while at pasture, disorientation, staring at imaginary objects, and
excessive licking of the nose or flanks.  <P>
    There are few if any gross pathological changes evident at necropsy other than
loss of body condition in some animals.  However, post mortem histopathology of
BSE closely resembles other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE's).
Histopathological examination also demonstrates bilaterally symmetrical
degenerative changes in gray matter neuropil and neuronal vacuolation.  Because
of their structure and methods of replication, the BSE agents do not provoke an
antibody response in the host, removing the possibility of detecting their
presence by serological techniques or of preparing protective vaccines.<P>

<H4>
    
<A NAME="RTFToC15">BSE
Epidemic in the United Kingdom (UK)
</A></H4>
<P>
    Since BSE was first diagnosed in the United Kingdom in December 1986, more
then 155,000 cattle have contracted the disease.  BSE has now been reported in
France, Switzerland, Oman, Portugal, the Republic of Ireland, and Northern
Ireland.  <P>
    Epidemiological studies in the UK have characterized the outbreak of BSE in
that country as an extended common source epidemic.  Each case, therefore, has
been a primary case due to exposure to a single common source of infection.
Investigators have identified several major risk factors that apparently
contributed to the emergence of the disease and the resultant epidemic in the
UK.  USDA identified the following risk factors for BSE in the UK: <BR>
<UL>
<LI>large sheep population relative to the cattle population;
<LI>a large, uncontrolled, scrapie incidence rate;
<LI>the production of greaves, an incompletely processed intermediate product
in the rendering process;
<LI>changes in rendering processes, like the reduced use of solvent
extraction, and;
<LI>the feeding of large amounts, up to 4 percent of the diet, of meat and
bone meal to young dairy calves.</UL><BR>
    The only common factor in the cattle with BSE is that feed containing meat and
bone meal was fed to the affected animals.  Further epidemiological studies,
including computer simulation of the epidemic in the United Kingdom, suggest
that feed contaminated by a TSE agent was the cause of the disease.  Two
possible hypotheses as to the original source of this agent were consistent
with the epidemiological findings -- that it was the agent of scrapie itself,
or that it was a cattle-adapted strain of a scrapie-like agent.  <P>
    In the UK, dead sheep, many of which may have died of scrapie and cattle with
BSE, were picked up by "knackers" for rendering into animal feed.  This
material was partially rendered into "greaves" which contained large amounts of
the scrapie/BSE agent, and was fed to dairy calves in large amounts.  The
spread of BSE appeared to be facilitated by the feeding of rendered
BSE-infected cattle back to calves.  BSE agent recycled from cows to calves
until the ruminant-to-ruminant feeding ban in 1989.<P>

<H4>
    
<A NAME="RTFToC16">Efforts
to Control BSE in the UK
</A></H4>
<P>
    In the late 1970s and early 1980s, many rendering plants in Britain switched
from the hydrocarbon extraction solvent rendering method using live steam to a
heat extraction method.  The heat extraction method apparently allowed the
survival of BSE present in UK cattle.<P>
    In an extensive research project, various rendering processes used in the
European Union were tested for their ability to inactivate the BSE agent in 15
pilot scale facsimiles.  BSE brains were mixed with intestine and bone to
replicate raw materials.  The variables were type of process (continuous or
batch), time, temperature, atmosphere, amount of fat, and particle diameter.
Meat and bone meal was produced from each of the processes, and suspensions
were assayed in inbred mice for infectivity.  Four of the 15 processes produced
meat and bone meal with detectable BSE infectivity, and one process showed no
reduction in titer over the original raw material.  These processes were banned
for use in the EC.<P>
    Regulatory controls taken to manage the BSE epidemic and minimize public
health risks in the UK and other countries include an action to make the
disease reportable (June, 1988); a ban on the feeding of ruminant-derived
protein supplements to other ruminants (July, 1988); compulsory slaughter and
incineration of suspect cattle (August, 1988); and a ban on the feeding of the
specified offals or their products to all pet and farm animals (September,
1990).  There is no direct evidence that scrapie or BSE is a hazard to human
health.  Nevertheless, British authorities have banned from human foods and all
animal feeds the use of specified bovine organs (brain, spinal cord, thymus,
tonsils, spleen, and intestines), from cattle over 6 months of age and products
derived from them.<P>

<H4>
    
<A NAME="RTFToC17">Efforts
to Prevent BSE in the U.S.
</A></H4>
<P>
    The first step in dealing with an emerging animal disease, such as BSE,
is identifying and measuring the risks to U.S. livestock posed by other
countries with the disease, and understanding conditions in the U.S. which
might lead to an outbreak.<P>
    To date, no cases of BSE have been diagnosed in the U.S.  If a BSE outbreak
occurred in the U.S., there would be a significant animal health risk and a
perceived human risk.  The animal health risk would be from ruminants consuming
rendered infected cattle.  The perceived human risk would come from fears that
humans could be at risk for Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (CJD) from consuming
foods, dietary supplements, or drugs derived from bovine tissues.  Also, it
would likely have a devastating economic effect on the U.S. cattle industry.
Not only would the sale of beef in the U.S. likely plummet, as it did in
Britain, but domestic use and exports of cattle by-products would likely be
restricted until the U.S. could demonstrate the disease was eradicated or under
control.  Since BSE has a mean 3.5 year incubation period, it would take a long
time to demonstrate safety of U.S. cattle by-products following the diagnosis
of the first case.<P>
    The reduction in the titer of TSE agents by the processes used by renderers in
the U.S.  is one of the important conditions in the U.S. that is protective
against a UK-type epidemic.  Renderers in the U.S. did not manufacture greaves
as in the in the UK.  The small sheep population, small amount of scrapie,
large cattle population, lack of feeding meat and bone meal to young bovines,
young age of U.S. dairy cattle, in addition to the rendering conditions are
reducing the risk of BSE in U.S. indigenous bovines.<P>
    USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) regulations for
Foreign Animal Diseases along with many special regulations for BSE have helped
prevent importation of BSE animals into the U.S.  APHIS has also carried out an
effective surveillance program for BSE in U.S. cattle and performed several
thorough risk assessments for BSE in the U.S. to monitor the change in risk for
U.S. cattle.  APHIS has prohibited the importation of live cattle and zoo
ruminants from Great Britain since July, 1989.  Pathologists at the National
Veterinary Service Laboratories (NVSL) and the Iowa State University are
examining bovine brains submitted.  NVSL personnel have examined over 2,000
bovine brains and none of these specimens contained lesions with the
characteristics and distribution typical for BSE.<P>
    In 1989, the National Renderers Association and the Animal Protein Producers
Industry recommended to their members that they voluntarily refrain from
rendering sheep offal for inclusion in cattle feed.<P>
    BSE was still an emerging disease in 1992, and as discussed, little factual
information was known except that feed ingredients from UK rendering were
transmitting BSE and it was similar to scrapie.  Therefore, in 1992, the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) carried out a survey of current rendering
practices in the U.S.  The survey showed that the rendering industry voluntary
ban was not adequately effective.  The survey showed some rendered adult sheep
protein getting into U.S. cattle feed.  Limited inspections of rendering plants
were conducted to:<P>

<UL>
<LI>assess compliance by U.S. renderers with the industry imposed voluntary
ban on rendering adult sheep for cattle feed,
<LI>identify rendering plant practices concerning adult sheep, and 
<LI>determine if rendered adult sheep protein by-products are sold or labeled
for use as feed or feed components for cattle.  </UL><BR>
    Fifteen plants were identified and investigated that were estimated to process
greater than 85 percent of the adult sheep rendered in the U.S.  The 15 plants
rendering adult sheep carry out a variety of management schemes.  Eleven render
adult sheep with heads, seven render sheep separately from other species, and
four render sheep that have died of causes other than slaughter.  The rendering
industry voluntary ban did not appear to be fully implemented since 6 of the 11
renderers processing adult sheep with heads are selling rendered protein
by-products to cattle feed producers.  A positive result of the survey was
communication of the scrapie/BSE issue and on-the-spot decisions to comply with
the voluntary ban. <P>
    In 1993, FDA determined that the most prudent course of action was to develop
means to further reduce the risk to U.S. cattle.  The FDA issued letters to
manufacturers of drugs, biologics, devices, dietary supplements, and animal
products urging them to use only cattle products from non-BSE countries in
their products.  A regulation was proposed to protect cattle from the
possibility that scrapie had caused BSE.  The major benefits of the regulation
were:<P>

<UL>
<LI>increased protection of human and animal health, 
<LI>increased consumer confidence in the use of U.S. cattle by-products,  and 
<LI>reduced risk of economic loss to the U.S. cattle industry</UL><BR>
    At that time, these benefits seemed to far outweigh the cost of implementing
the regulation by the slaughter and rendering industries, the cost of
enforcement by the government, and the economic loss to sheep producers.
However, today this may no longer be true. Other causes for BSE have been
proposed, and research is being conducted to test them.  The comments to the
1993 proposal have pointed out that the steps would have been very expensive to
carry out, and they may be unnecessary.  No evidence of BSE having zoonotic
potential has been found.  FDA continues to evaluate the new information on
TSE's, and will take appropriate necessary steps to protect public and animal
health.<P>
    BSE is an example of an emerging disease with considerable impact on USDA,
FDA, and the world.  Regulators have an especially difficult task in protecting
human and animal health in the face of inadequate scientific information.  The
successful solution to the UK BSE epidemic and no evidence of BSE's presence in
the U.S. is testimony to the advantages of government Agency communication and
cooperation in the face of a devastating emerging disease.<P>

ANALYZES PESTICIDES IN ANIMAL FEEDS
</A></H3>
<P>
In Fiscal Year 1995, 556 domestic feed samples (532 surveillance and 24
compliance) and 69 import feed samples (65 surveillance and 4 compliance) were
collected and analyzed for pesticides by the FDA.  Of the 532 domestic
surveillance samples, 301 (56.6 percent) contained no detectable pesticide
residues and only 2 (0.4 percent) contained residues which exceeded regulatory
guidance (see Table I).  Of the 65 import surveillance samples, 29 (44.6
percent) contained no detectable pesticide residues, and only 1 (1.5 percent)
contained residues which exceeded regulatory guidance.  <P>
    Two domestic samples of corn (1 each from Virginia and Missouri) contained
.034 and .304 parts per million (ppm) of chlorpyrifos-methyl.  One import
sample of feather meal from Canada contained .060 ppm of diphenylamine.  Since
there is no tolerance established for chlorpyrifos-methyl on corn or for
diphenylamine on poultry, these samples were considered to have exceeded
regulatory guidance.<P>
    In the 231 domestic surveillance feed samples in which one or more pesticides
were detected, there were 346 residues (254 quantifiable and 92 trace).
Malathion, chlorpyrifos-methyl, diazinon, chlorpyrifos, and pirimiphos-methyl
were the most frequently found pesticides and accounted for 90.75 percent of
all residues detected in feed (see Table II). <BR>

SAFETY EVALUATION OF TRANSGENIC ANIMALS
</A> 
 by Margaret Ann Miller, Ph.D. and John C.
Matheson III, MSPH
</A></H3>
<P>
Recombinant DNA (rDNA) and related genetic modification techniques are being
applied to food-producing animals.  These modifications are being performed for
a variety of reasons such as to produce biologics and pharmaceuticals, optimize
the nutritional value of derived food products, improve animal growth rate and
reproduction, prevent animal disease, select superior strains, identify
individuals, and preserve genetic stocks.  Many of these applications fall
outside the purview of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic (FFD&amp;C) Act which
is enforced by FDA.  In other cases, the product claims for the genetic
modification and the animals containing them are very similar to those of
products currently regulated by FDA.  While the Agency has not published a
formal policy on the regulation of these "transgenic" animals, some of these
techniques and product claims may come under the FFD&amp;C Act. <P>
    Products regulated as new animal drugs in the United States are subject to a
pre-market review process to determine efficacy and safety.  Product safety
includes target animal safety, safety to the environment, and safety for
consumers of food derived from treated animals.  The new animal drug approval
process permits experimental animals to enter the food supply after the FDA
determines that the food products are safe for human consumption.  Although it
is difficult to predict for future products, the current regulations can
accommodate the present generation of genetically modified animals for which
food safety may be of concern. <P>
    During the past few years, the FDA has published several policy statements and
guidelines discussing the Agency's position on the regulation of products
produced by biotechnology.  For example, in May 1992, FDA published a document
in the <I>Federal Register</I> entitled "Statement of Policy: Foods Derived
from New Plant Varieties."  This document outlines the decision-making process
and safety assessment that food producers should follow prior to marketing
"transgenic" plants as human food and animal feed.  Also, in 1995, FDA's Center
for Biologics Evaluation and Research published a guidance document "Points to
Consider in the Manufacture and Testing of Therapeutic Products for Human Use
Derived from Transgenic Animals."  This document discusses guidance for the
manufacture of pharmaceuticals by "Biopharm" animals as well as a
recommendation that the FDA determine food safety before these animals enter
the human food supply. <P>
    Other Federal agencies also regulate genetically modified animals.  USDA has
authority to regulate viruses under the Virus, Serum, and Toxin Act.
Therefore, when viral vectors are used to introduce the new genetic material
into animals, the viral component of the gene construct may be under the
jurisdiction of USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.  <P>
    USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is responsible for ensuring
the safety, wholesomeness and accurate labeling of all meat, meat food products
and poultry products under the Federal Meat Inspection Act and Poultry Products
Inspection Act.  FSIS has developed a Points to Consider document "Safety
Evaluation of Transgenic Animals from Transgenic Animal Research."<P>
    EPA regulates all pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and
Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and controls the use of genetically engineered
microorganisms (GEMs) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).  EPA is
not principally involved in regulating transgenic animals.<P>
    FDA is the primary agency responsible for the regulation of food products
intended for human consumption.  FDA has responsibility for the safety of milk
and dairy products, fish and shellfish, and animal drug products.  To date, FDA
has not published a formal policy statement on how the FFD&amp;C Act applies to
the regulation of new gene transfer technologies when used in food-producing
animals.  In transgenic animal experiments, the new genetic material may be
introduced into either the germ line or all or some somatic cells.  In many
cases, the expression product and the product claims for the transgene are
identical or very similar to products which are currently regulated by the
Agency as animal drugs.  <P>
    The FFD&amp;C Act defines drugs based upon their functional claims rather than
their chemical structure or manufacturing source.  Some transgenic animals will
be regulated under the animal drug provisions of the FFD&amp;C Act.  When the
genetic material is introduced into somatic or germ cells to produce a
phenotypic change in the animal or its offspring, it would be considered to be
an animal drug.  On the other hand, when a genetic procedure is used to map the
genome and phenotypic change is achieved through selection and traditional
breeding, it would not be considered to be involving the use of an animal
drug.<P>
<B> </B>The animal drug approval process is primarily designed for drug
sponsors seeking FDA approval to market drugs in interstate commerce.  However,
this process is also used to facilitate research on food-producing animals so
that the experimental animals can enter the food supply.  Researchers
conducting experiments with animal drugs in food-producing animals can
establish an Investigational New Animal Drug Application (INAD) with the CVM.
<P>
    Under the INAD process, researchers have an opportunity to conduct all the
studies required to support the commercial marketing approval.  Once the
sponsor demonstrates the safety of food products from the treated animals, the
experimental animals can enter the food supply.  <P>

<H4>
<A NAME="RTFToC21">Human
Food Safety Requirements For Animal Drugs
</A></H4>
<P>
    While FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) regulates the
vast majority of food for humans, i.e., food commodities consumed directly by
humans, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) ensures the safety of animal
drug residues which are regulated as indirect food additives.  The safety
determination for animal drug residues in food for humans ("human food safety")
is not dictated by the drug claims but by the chemical nature and biological
activity of the drug entity.  The human food safety concern for animal drug
residues focuses on the assessment of chronic low level exposure effects of
drug residues in edible tissues.  Generally, the concentration of drug residues
in edible tissues are not high enough to produce acute toxicity. <P>
    For most animal drugs, the human food safety evaluation involves the
completion of the standard battery of toxicology tests and residue and
metabolism studies.  These toxicology tests are designed to determine the dose
at which the compound produces an adverse effect in test animals and a dose at
which the drug produces no adverse effect, i.e., the no observed effect level
(NOEL).  The observed effect does not always represent a toxic effect.
Pharmacological, hormonal, and microbiological effects are all considered
adverse biological effects in the human food safety evaluation.  For certain
drug classes, additional specialized tests are required to establish a NOEL for
these physiological effects. <P>
    In addition to the general food safety provisions of the FFD&amp;C Act, the
Delaney Clause prohibits the use of carcinogenic compounds as animal drugs when
they leave residues in food.  Therefore, if the animal drug or its metabolites
are structurally related to a demonstrated carcinogen or if the compound tests
positive in the genetic toxicology studies, additional carcinogenicity studies
may be required. <P>
    Following completion of all the toxicology studies, the NOEL of the most
sensitive effect from the most appropriate toxicology study is divided by a
safety factor to determine an acceptable daily intake (ADI).  The ADI
represents the highest amount of total residue of the compound that is allowed
in edible tissues of the target animal.  This total residue consists of parent
compound, free metabolites, and metabolites that are covalently bound to
endogenous molecules, and is very difficult to measure on a routine basis.
Rather than measuring the total residues in all the edible tissues, CVM
establishes one value, a tolerance, in one tissue, the target tissue for
monitoring drug residues.  The tolerance is established so that when residues
are below the tolerance in the target tissue, the whole carcass is safe.  To
establish the tolerance for the drug, the drug sponsor conducts a residue
depletion study to determine when the concentration of total drug residues is
below the ADI.<P>
    This food safety assessment process using a toxicology test battery works very
well for drugs that have toxicology endpoints which display a clearly
observable dose-response relationship.  This approach is not appropriate for
determining the food safety of all animal drugs and certainly must be modified
for assessment of transgenic animals.<P>
    The FFD&amp;C Act also requires a determination of the safety of compounds
formed in food as a result of drug treatment.  For "traditional" animal drug
products this provision serves as a basis for an examination of metabolites.
For the recombinant protein products, CVM has interpreted this provision to
require examination of the food safety implications of secondary metabolic
changes which occur as a result of drug treatment.  For genetically modified
animals this provision could require an assessment of pleiotrophic changes. <P>

<H4>
<A NAME="RTFToC22">Recombinant
Animal Drug Products 
</A></H4>
<P>
    To date, the biotechnology products approved by CVM have been proteins
produced by recombinant DNA technology using a bacterial fermentation system.
The desired gene is isolated and fused with plasmid DNA.  The recombinant
plasmid is cloned or inserted into a gram negative bacterial host, usually
<I>Escherichia coli</I>.  Under fermentation conditions, these transformed
microorganisms become factories which produce large quantities of the protein
hormone product at relatively low cost.  The protein product is isolated and
purified from the bacteria.  When treated under defined conditions, the product
assumes a conformation which is biologically active.  In many respects the
production of recombinant protein hormones is not substantially different from
the production of other new animal drugs made by fermentation processes. <P>
    The food safety evaluation for recombinant protein hormone products is similar
to that performed for other protein products approved as animal drugs.  On the
other hand, the toxicology studies conducted to demonstrate the human food
safety of protein products are considerably different from those just described
for more traditional animal drug products.  <P>
    For protein hormones that are biologically active in humans and for
recombinant proteins with altered amino acid sequences, the human food safety
assessment compares the oral bioavailability of the protein to the
concentration of the protein residues in tissues.  For compounds with extremely
low oral bioavailability, it is possible for humans to consume the entire dose
administered to the food animal with no food safety concerns.  In other cases,
the sponsor must quantify the protein hormone concentration in edible tissue to
assure an adequate margin of safety between the oral dose where no
bioavailability is demonstrated and the levels expected to be consumed by
humans as residues.<P>

<H4>
<A NAME="RTFToC23">Food
Safety Determination of Transgenic Animals
</A></H4>
 <BR>
    The diversity of transgenic animal technologies that might result in food
products being offered from human consumption demands a flexible scientific
approach to meeting the food safety statutory standard.  A brief survey of the
types of transgenic animals being produced supports this contention.<P>

 
    
<A NAME="RTFToC24">Transgenic
Animals Containing an Animal Drug
</A> 
<P>
    The statutory food safety requirements for animal drug residues
resulting from  genetic modification of animals are the same as those for other
animal drugs.  Basically, the food products produced from genetically modified
animals must be as safe as those from nontransgenic animals, and the sponsor of
the transgenic animals must demonstrate safety of the animal products before
the animals can enter the food supply.  The standard battery of toxicology
studies used to establish the safety of "traditional" animal drugs are not
appropriate for assessing the safety of transgenes in genetically modified
animals.  Also, the "traditional" withdrawal period may be difficult to apply
to transgenic animals.  It may not always be possible to "turn-off" the
expression of the transgene, and thereby limit exposure to the expression
product to a tolerance concentration.  Also, the transgene will still be
present in the animal.  In cases where there are food safety concerns for the
expression products and not the transgene, a tolerance approach could apply.<P>
    CVM does not plan to offer a standard set of guidelines on how the food safety
determination for transgenic animals must be conducted.  Sponsors seeking
approvals for transgenic animals with animal drug claims are, instead,
encouraged to contact the CVM early in the development process so that a
case-specific human food safety program can be designed.  <P>
    Many different transgenic animal products could potentially be offered to the
market for food, yet few living examples are available for evaluation.
Ultimately, transgenic animals modified specifically to improve the economics
of producing them for food or to improve other desirable characteristics, such
as lean-to-fat ratios, are expected to be a common situation.  Gene therapy may
be used to combat disease in specific tissues, such as treatment of mastitis,
or to create secondary sites for the release of growth hormones or other
production enhancement gene products.  Stable germ lines containing genetic
modifications that relate to productivity or disease resistance are also
likely, particularly in fish.<P>
    Generally, the human food safety assessment for transgenic animals will be
more similar to that performed on recombinant protein products than that
performed on the "traditional" drugs.  The product's sponsor will need to
demonstrate the safety of: 1) the transgene, including the promoter and other
unexpressed regions; 2) the expression products and 3) in some cases,
pleiotrophic effects, in edible animal products.  Information on the biology of
the genetic modification from the scientific literature, data on the
biochemical characterization of the transgene and the expression products,
information on the mode of action, data on the quantity of transgenes and
expression products, and studies investigating oral bioavailability of the
expressed protein will be useful in performing the food safety assessment.
<P><A NAME="RTFToC25">Biopharm
Animals
</A> 
<P>
    Biopharm animals have been genetically modified to manufacture a human or
veterinary drug or biologic substance, a food additive, or other product of
commercial value.  The substance is then harvested from milk, blood or other
tissue of the animal.  The genetic modification can be either a germ line
(heritable) modification, or a somatic cell/gene therapy involving the
introduction of the modified genes into cells of a particular organ or tissue
of an individual.  The main emphasis of these efforts is on harnessing the
metabolic capabilities of the animal to produce a product in lieu of using, for
example, chemical synthesis, fermentation, or extraction from a dilute natural
source. <P>
    Biopharm animals are usually of the same species that humans use for food, so
it can be anticipated that sometimes it will be desired to salvage them for
food, thereby avoiding other more costly means of carcass disposition.  Safety
evaluation of food derived from biopharm animals would include, in addition to
the factors addressed above, an evaluation of effect of the management of the
animals on their residue profile.  Animal management would be examined for the
potential for unsafe residues of drugs and other chemicals that were used
during the utilization of the animal as a protein factory. <P>
    Not surprisingly, biopharm animals are sometimes managed with research
compounds, unapproved and approved drugs and biologics in order to facilitate
production of biopharm products.  Because of later purification steps, these
research compounds do not appear as residues in the biopharm product, however
the residues may remain in portions of the animal that might be offered for
food.  If the safety of these residues in animal tissues cannot be
demonstrated, the animals cannot be offered for food.  <P>

 
    
<A NAME="RTFToC26">Transgenic
Animals Containing Food Additives and Color Additives
</A> 
<P>
    A third grouping of transgenic animals are those modified in a manner
to affect their quality as food for humans.  Examples might include cattle
producing more nutritionally complete milk, fish that produce more omega-3
fatty acids, and farm-raised trout whose flesh is pinker.  It is anticipated
that CFSAN, rather than CVM, will evaluate these types of modifications under
the food additive, color additive or Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS)
provisions of the FFD&amp;C Act.  <P>

<H4>
<A NAME="RTFToC27">Summary
And Conclusions
</A></H4>
<P>
    Many of the product claims being anticipated for transgenic animals, such as
improved growth, improved feed efficacy, improved carcass characteristics, and
improved disease resistance, are the same as animal drug claims.  Any
regulation of transgenic animals under the FFD&amp;C Act will require a
demonstration of human food safety before the animals enter the human food
supply.  <P>


<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC29">QUESTIONS
AND ANSWERS ON ADES
</A></H3>
<P>
This issue of the <I>FDA Veterinarian</I> contains the third in a series of
questions and answers that are frequently asked about CVM's Veterinary Adverse
Drug Experience (ADE) program.  <P>
<B>Q.   If I decide to report an ADE, who should I contact?</B><BR>
<P>
<B>A.   </B>You should first call the drug company.  Inform them that you wish to
report an ADE, and ask to speak to a technical services veterinarian.  The
technical services veterinarian should ask a series of questions about the
experience, complete a form called the FDA 1932, and forward the report to CVM.
We suggest the drug company as your first point of contact because many
companies also will offer clinical advice or diagnostic assistance.  CVM does
not provide these services.  Drug company telephone numbers can be obtained
from the publications <B>Compendium of Veterinary Products</B> (North American
Compendiums, Inc.) and <B>Veterinary Pharmaceuticals and Biologics</B>
(Veterinary Medicine Publishing Company).  <P>
    If you wish to confirm that your report was forwarded, or prefer not to call
the drug company, you can contact CVM directly at (301) 594-1722 or toll-free
at (800) FDA-1088.  Please ask to speak to one of the veterinarians responsible
for the ADE monitoring program.  CVM can also provide a supply of prepaid
mailers (Form FDA 1932a).  These mailers are available by writing or
telephoning CVM and are also distributed at veterinary medicine meetings and
seminars.<P>
    If the ADE involves a product other than a drug, the following numbers may be
useful.  The telephone number to reach USDA regarding biologics is (800)
752-6255.  The phone number to reach EPA regarding topical insecticides is
(800) 858-7378.<P>
    A third option for reporting is the Veterinary Practitioners' Reporting
Network (USP PRN) sponsored by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP).  The USP
PRN program is an independent, non-government reporting program.  The telephone
number to reach USP regarding any veterinary product is (800) 4-USP PRN.<P>
<B>Q.   Does CVM review reports that involve extra-label use of animal
drugs?</B><BR>
<P>
<B>A.   </B>The reporting of ADEs associated with extra-label use is important to
the veterinary profession.  Under the Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act of
1994, veterinarians can, in the future, administer drugs more freely in an
extra-label manner.  About one third of the current ADE reports on file involve
extra-label use.  CVM is also interested in ADEs involving human drugs used in
veterinary practice, and in ADEs involving animal drugs marketed without FDA
approval.<BR>

<P>
    In the January 2, 1996, <I>Federal Register</I>, the FDA announced that the
Agency is amending the food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of
menadione nicotinamide bisulfite as a nutritional supplement for the prevention
of vitamin K deficiency and as a source of supplemental niacin in chicken and
turkey feed when used at a rate not to exceed 2 grams per ton (g/t) of complete

<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC28">INFORMATION
ON MARKETING A PET FOOD PRODUCT
</A></H3>
<P>
<I>The following article is provided in response to numerous inquiries CVM has
received concerning pet food regulations.</I><BR>
<P>
There is no requirement that pet food products have premarket approval by FDA.
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act does require that pet foods, like
human foods, be pure and wholesome, contain no harmful or deleterious
substances, and be truthfully labeled.  Canned pet foods must be processed in
conformance with low acid canned food (LACF) regulations designed to ensure
that the finished product is free of any viable microorganisms. Producers must
file acceptable processing methods with the Agency.  These LACF regulations
[listed in Title 21 of the <I>Code of Federal Regulations</I> (CFR), Part 507]
are equivalent to the LACF requirements for canned foods intended for human use
.<P>
    The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act states that foods intended for man or
animals are adulterated if they contain color additives that have not been
proven safe to the satisfaction of FDA for that particular use.  Title 21 of
the CFR, Parts 73, 74, and 81 list the approved color additives and the
conditions under which they may be safely used in food, including the amounts
that may be used.<P>
    Regulations which apply specifically to food additives in animal pet foods are
published in Title 21, Part 573 of the CFR.  Additives in pet food must be
approved by FDA based on scientific evidence that supports their safety and
utility. If FDA has reason to believe there is a problem with the safety of a
particular food additive, the Agency can take action to have it removed from
the market.<P>
    There are also Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) substances  which are
permitted  to be used in pet foods, because of their long history of safe use
in foods.  These are published in Title 21,  Part 582 of the CFR.<P>
    Regulations concerning the labeling of pet food are published in Title 21,
Part 501 of the CFR.  Copies of the CFR may be purchased from the
Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC
20402.<P>
    Pet food labeling is regulated at two levels.  The Federal regulations,
enforced by FDA, establish standards for all animal feeds:  proper
identification of the product as a pet food; net quantity statement (weight,
volume, or count); name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or
distributor; and proper listing of all ingredients in descending order of
predominance by weight and identified by their common or usual names.  Some
States also enforce their own labeling regulations.  Many of these follow the
pet food regulations of the Association of American Feed Control Officials
(AAFCO), a nongovernment advisory body with representatives from all States.
<P>
    The Association of American Feed Control Officials has issued a series of pet
food regulations that has served as a model for State laws and regulations.
These include more specific requirements regarding product names, flavor
designations, guaranteed analysis, nutritional adequacy statements, proper
ingredient names, and other aspects of labeling.  The organization also
provides test requirements or protocols for manufacturers so that they can meet
State requirements of proof of safety and nutritional quality before a pet food
is marketed.  A product clearly identified as a "snack" or "treat" does not
require a nutritional adequacy statement, but it must meet the other pet food
regulations.<P>

<B>4.	EFFECTIVENESS:</B><p>
 NADA 65-256 was originally approved as safe for use as
labeled on May 17, 1954. The drug was the subject of National Academy of 
Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) reports which were published in
the FEDERAL REGISTER of July 8, 1970 (35 FR 10966). The Academy evaluated this 
drug as probably effective for oral treatment of animal diseases when such 
diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms sensitive to tetracycline
hydrochloride, diseases such as: (1 )Enteric and respiratory diseases in 
poultry (2) gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in swine; (3) infected 
wounds, gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in calves, sheep, and goats; 
(4) digestive system and respiratory diseases, pyelonephritis, peritonitis, 
infected wounds, abscesses, ulcers, and secondary bacterial invaders in dogs 
and cats;(5) coccidiosis in dogs; and (6) hexamitiasis in turkeys.
The Academy concluded that: (1) Most of the dosage directions provide for a 
less than effective dose, and the recommended minimum oral dose for large 
animals is 10 milligrams per pound of body weight daily in divided doses and 
for small animals 25 milligrams per pound of body weight in divided doses; (2) 
claims for the treatment of viral diseases must be limited to microorganisms 
belonging to the psittacosis-lymphogranuloma group; (3) each disease claim 
should be properly qualified as "appropriate for use in (name of disease) 
caused by pathogens sensitive to (name of drug), " and if the disease cannot 
be so qualified the claim must be dropped; (4) claims made "for prevention of" 
or "to prevent" should be replaced with "as an aid in the control of" or "to 
aid in the control of"; (5) as applicable, the manufacturer's label should warn that treated 
animals must actually consume enough medicated water or medicated feed to 
provide a therapeutic dose under the conditions that prevail as a precaution, 
the label should state the desired oral dose per unit of animal weight per day 
for each species as a guide to effective use of the preparation in drinking 
water or feed.<p>
	The Food and Drug Administration concurs with the Academy's findings, 
interpreting the phrase "...cannot be so qualified..."   in paragraph (3) to 
mean "...is not supported by adequate data..." (See Fed. Reg. vol. 35, NO. 
131-Wed., July 8, 1970). FDA proceeded to review all available data relating 
to the effectiveness of products subject to NADA 65-269 to determine which 
label claims were supported by the requisite proof of effectiveness. That 
review resulted in a letter to the sponsor dated July 1, 1992, in which the 
agency stated that it had concluded that such data supported effectiveness 
only for the control and treatment of certain bacterial diseases susceptible 
to tetracycline hydrochloride in calves and swine.<p>

Thereafter, the sponsor complied with the evaluation of NAS/NRC and FDA's 
conclusions in the following manner:<p>

1.	The appropriate oral dose of 10 mg per pound body weight daily in each 
species has been incorporated in the labeling.<p>

2.	Claims for viral diseases have been deleted from the labeling 
completely.<p>

3.	Each disease claim on the label has been properly qualified with the 
appropriate genus and species of bacteria susceptible to tetracycline 
hydrochloride. Disease claims which were not so qualified have been deleted.<P>

4.	Claims made for prevention have been revised to read "Control of..."
where appropriate.<P>

5.	The manufacturer's label carries the warning statement that treated 
animals must have the medicated water adjusted to compensate for variation in 
age and the weight of the animal, the nature and severity of disease signs, 
and environmental temperature and humidity, each of which affects water 
consumption.<P>

<B>4.	ANIMAL SAFETY:</B><p>
 NADA 65-269 was originally approved as safe on May 17, 
1954. No further safety data are required.<P>

<B>6.	HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</B><p>
 The NAS/NRC evaluation of the drug is concerned only 
with the effectiveness and safety of the drug for the treated animal. FDA's 
approval of the supplemental application did not involve reevaluation or 
reaffirmation of the human food safety data in the parent application.<P>

<B>556.720 Tetracycline</B><P>

A tolerance of 0.25 part per million has already been established for 
negligible residues of tetracycline in uncooked edible tissues of calves, 
swine, sheep, chickens, and turkeys.<P>

Withdrawal times: 7 days -swine, 4 days-calves<P>


<B>7.	AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</B><P>

This supplemental NADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act 
and demonstrates that POLYOTIC Soluble Powder when used under its proposed 
conditions of use, is safe and effective for the labeled indications. The 
approval provides for use of POLYOTIC Soluble Powder for the control and 
treatment of bacterial enteritis and bacterial pneumonia in swine and calves.<P>

The "probably effective" finding of the NAS/NRC regarding Tetracycline 
hydrochloride which was published in the FEDERAL REGISTER of July 8, 1970, was 
subsequently reviewed by FDA, resulting in the upgrade to "effective" status 
with respect to the claims noted in the previous paragraph. The firm submitted 
revised labeling to conform and, therefore, this supplemental NADA complies 
with the NAS/NRC evaluation and FDA's conclusions.<P>

POLYOTIC Soluble Powder for use in food-producing animals is currently on the 
market as an over-the-counter product. The extensive over-the-counter 
marketing history of the products indicate that the conditions of use 
described in the labeling are reasonably certain to be followed in practice. 
Therefore, the Center for Veterinary Medicine has concluded that this product 
should retain over-the-counter marketing status.<P>

Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (<B>21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)</B>), this 
is a Category II change. The approval of this change is not expected to have 
any adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug and, 
therefore, did not require a reevaluation of the human food or target animal 
safety data in the parent application.

Under the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988, this 
approval does not qualify for an exclusivity period under section 
512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b 
(c)(2)(F)(iii)) because the supplemental application does not contain reports 
of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalency or residue 
studies ) and in the case of food producing animals human food safety studies 
(other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval and 
conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<P>

daily.<P>
<b>3.   DOSAGE</b><P>
 a.	DOSAGE FORM:   Soluble powder<br>
b.	ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION:	Oral via drinking water<br>
c.	RECOMMENDED  DOSAGE:   See preceding  indications  For Use.<P>
<b>4..EFFECTIVENESS</b><p>
  
The  effectiveness  of  OXY WS (TM)<i> </i> (MEDAMYCIN &#174; ) 
Soluble  Powder (oxytetracycline HCl)  was reviewed by the National Academy of
Sciences/National  Research Council  Drug Efficacy Study Implementation
(NAS/NRC  DESI)  and has  been  deemed  effective when labeled as specified in
the Indications and Recommended Dosage sections presented above  (<B>35 FR 7089</B>,
May 5,   1970).<P>
Studies  in  the  original  NADA demonstrated  the  bioequivalence  of
Pfizer's  Terramycin &#174;   Soluble  Powder  and  Fermenta's OXY
WS (TM)   (MEDAMYCIN &#174; )  Soluble Antibiotic in chickens. To
support a formula modification,  this supplemental NADA contains another
bioequivalence study in chickens.<P>
A  crossover  bioequivalence  and  palatability  study  using 148  Hubbard
Rock-Cornish  chicks  (74  males,  74  females) approximately eight weeks of
age was conducted at the Fort Collins,   Colorado  research  facility  of
Fermenta  Animal Health Company by Dr.  J.  Szanto.   The chicks were divided
into  two  groups,  120  medicated  and  28  unmedicated  controls.  Pfizer's
Terramycin  Soluble Powder Concentrate and Fermenta's  OXY  WS (TM)
 (MEDAMYCIN &#174; )    Soluble  Antibiotic  were administered in the
drinking water for 14 consecutive days at an approximate concentration of 800
mg oxytetracycline HCl per gallon.<P>
Weight gains were measured on days  O,  5,  9 and 13 during the study.  Water
consumption was monitored daily from day -7 through day 13  for each
animal group and feed consumption was monitored daily  from day  -14  through
day  13  for each animal group.  Blood samples were collected on days 5, 9 and
13.<P>
The combined  (male and female)  average daily weight gains per bird for each
medicated group was as follows:   Fermenta OXY WS (TM)
 (MEDAMYCIN &#174; ) ,  66 g/bird; Pfizer Terramycin &#174; ,  65 g/bird;
unmedicated control,  56 g/bird.   The combined average water  consumption  for
the medicated groups was  310 mL for the Fermenta product,  306 mL for the
Pfizer product and 279 mL for the unmedicated controls.  The feed conversion
rate  (feed/gain)  was  identical for the two medicated groups   (2.4);   the
unmedicated  controls  feed  conversion rate  was  2.6.  Combined  (male  and
female)  average  blood levels of oxytetracycline were 0.174  ppm for Fermenta
OXY WS (TM)   (MEDAMYCIN &#174; )   and 0.169 ppm for the Pfizer
product.<P>
The  blood  concentration  data  show  no  difference  between the  two
medicated  groups.    All  parameters  examined  (feed consumption,  drinking
water  consumption,  feed  conversion rate,   serum  drug   levels)   are
indicative   of   complete comparability between the reference drug product
(Pfizer) and Fermenta's OXY WS (TM)   (MEDAMYCIN &#174; ) .<P>
<b>ANIMAL SAFETY</b><p>
  
The animal safety of oxytetracycline hydrochloride soluble powder is recognized
under the conditions outlined in the NAS/NRC  DESI  review of the product with
reference to the indications  for use,  route of administration,  recommended
dosages and limitations of use as specified in 35 FR 7089, May  5,  1970.
Therefore,  to  assure  animal  safety,  oxytetracycline hydrochloride soluble
powder is to be used in accordance  with  NAS/NRC  recommendations  and  is
not  to  be used  for  more  than  14  consecutive  days  in  chickens  or
turkeys.<P>
<b>6.  HUMAN SAFETY</b><p>
  
<b>Residue Depletion Studies</b><p>
  
The  following  studies  establish  a  withdrawal  time when residues of
oxytetracycline hydrochloride are at or below the established tolerances in
edible tissues when  given  the  Fermenta  product  at  the  recommended label
doses.<P>
Forty  large  white  turkey  poults,   approximately  14 weeks  of  age  (36
medicated,  4  unmedicated  controls) were used to determine the tissue residue
depletion rate  of  oxytetracycline  HCI.    OXY WS (TM)   (MEDAMYCIN &#174; ) 
was  administered  in the drinking water continuously for 14 consecutive days
at a final drug concentration to deliver 25 mg oxytetracycline HCI per pound
body weight.    Blood,  skin/fat,  liver  and  muscle  tissue samples
collected  at  0,  4,  8,  12,  18  and  24  hours after withdrawal of
medicated water were analyzed for residues of oxytetracycline by
microbiological assay. Blood  samples  were  collected  from  all  birds  just
prior to euthanasia.   The control birds were negative for  detectable  levels
of  oxytetracycline  at  time  0 and 24 hours post drug withdrawal. The average
tissue concentrations  were  less  than  1  ppm  for  all  time points.<p>

Thirty-two Hubbard Rock-Cornish chicks (24 medicated, 8 unmedicated controls),
approximately 8 weeks of age were used to determine the tissue  residue
depletion rate  of  oxytetracycline  HCI.  OXY  WS (TM)
 (MEDAMYCIN &#174;  )<p>
Soluble  Antibiotic  was  administered  ad  libitum via the  drinking  water
for  14  consecutive  days  at  an approximate       drug    concentration
of    800   mg oxytetracycline HCl per gallon.   Muscle,  liver,  and skin/fat
tissue  samples  collected at 0,  1,  2,  3,  4 and 5 hours post withdrawal of
the medicated drinking water were analyzed for residues of oxytetracycline by
microbiological  assay.    The  control  birds  were negative for detectable
levels of oxytetracycline at time  0  and  5  hours  post  medication.    The
average tissue concentrations were less than the 1 ppm tolerance at all time
points.<p>

D.	Analytical Method for Residues.<p>
<br>
 The  regulatory  analytical  method  for  detection  of residues of
oxytetracycline is a microbiological test using <i>Bacillus cereus</i> spore
suspension-   The method, "Antibiotic  Residues  in  Milk,  Dairy  products,
and Animal  Tissues:  Methods,  Reports,  and  Protocols"  , Revised October,
1968,  Reprinted December,  1974,  is published by the Food and Drug
Administration.  The method was fully validated by the Research Laboratory  and
the  analytical  limits  developed  by  the laboratory  were  well  below  the
published  tolerance levels.  The results of the residue depletion studies
presented in this  summary demonstrate that the residues are below the
established tolerances in edible tissues  (<B>21 CFR 556.500</B>) after a four day
withdrawal period  in turkeys and a zero withdrawal in chickens.<P>
<b>7.  AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><P>
The data submitted in support of this supplemental NADA satisfy the
requirements of section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that Fermenta's product,
Oxytetracycline Soluble Powder, when used under its proposed conditions of use
is safe and effective in turkeys and chickens.<P>
The sponsor submitted bioequivalency data for chickens which demonstrated
biological equivalence to the approved pioneer product. This supplement is
approved under DESI "me-too" pipeline provision and therefore the sponsor had
to submit residue studies to satisfy human food safety requirements. The
withdrawal period for turkeys is 4 days, and there is no withdrawal period for
chickens. The tolerance for oxytetracycline has been previously established in
edible tissues of chickens and turkeys:<br>
(a) 3 parts per million in uncooked kidney<br>
(b) 1 part per million in uncooked muscle, liver, fat, and skin.<P>
Oxytetracycline Soluble Powder for use in food-producing animals is currently
on the market as an over-the-counter product. Adequate directions for use have
been written for the layman, and the conditions for use prescribed in labeling
are likely to be followed in practice. Therefore, the Center for Veterinary
Medicine (CVM) has concluded that this product retains over-the-counter
marketing status.<P>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106
(b)(2)(v)(vii)), this is a Category II change. The approval of this change is
not expected to have any adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this
new animal drug and, therefore, did not require a reevaluation of the human
food or target animal safety data in the parent application.<P>
This approval does not qualify for an exclusivity period under any of the
provisions of section 512 (c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act, (21 U.S.C. 360b (c)(2)(F) (iii) because the supplemental
application does not contain reports of new clinical or field investigations
(other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and, in the case of food
producing animals, human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or
residue studies) essential to the approval and conducted or sponsored by the
applicant.<P>

<b>3. DOSAGE FORM(S), ROUTE(S) of ADMINISTRATION AND RECOMMENDED DOSAGE:</b><P>

A.	DOSAGE FORM:<P>
Soluble Powder Concentrate<P>
B.	ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION:<P>
Oral<P>
C.	RECOMMENDED DOSAGE:<P>
10 mg/pound body weight.<P>

<B>4.	EFFECTIVENESS:</B><P>
 NADA 65-441 was originally approved as safe for use as
labeled on May 17,1954. The drug was the subject of National Academy of 
Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) reports which were published in 
the <B>FEDERAL REGISTER</B> of July 8, 1970 (<B>35 FR 10966</B>). The Academy evaluated this 
drug as probably effective for oral treatment of animal diseases when such
diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms sensitive to tetracycline 
hydrochloride, diseases such as: (1 ) Enteric and respiratory diseases in 
poultry (2) gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in swine; (3) infected 
wounds, gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in calves, sheep, and goats; (4) 
digestive system and respiratory diseases, pyelonephritis, peritonitis, 
infected wounds, abscesses, ulcers, and secondary bacterial invaders in dogs 
and cats; (5) coccidiosis in dogs; and (6) hexamitiasis in turkeys.<P>

The Academy concluded that: (1) Most of the dosage directions provide for a 
less than effective dose, and the recommended minimum oral dose for large 
animals is 10 milligrams per pound of body weight daily in divided doses and 
for small animals 25 milligrams per pound of body weight in divided doses; (2) 
claims for the treatment of viral diseases must be limited to microorganisms 
belonging to the psittacosis-lymphogranuloma group; (3) each disease claim 
should be properly qualified as "appropriate for use in (name of disease) 
caused by pathogens sensitive to (name of drug), " and if the disease cannot 
be so qualified the claim must be dropped; (4) claims made "for prevention of" 
or "to prevent" should be replaced with "as an aid in the control of" or "to 
aid in the control of"; (5) as applicable, the manufacturer's label should warn that treated animals 
must actually consume enough medicated water or medicated feed to provide a 
therapeutic dose under the conditions that prevail as a precaution, the label 
should state the desired oral dose per unit of animal weight per day for each 
species as a guide to effective use of the preparation in drinking water or 
feed.<P>

The Food and Drug Administration concurs with the Academy's findings, 
interpreting the phrase "...cannot be so qualified..." in paragraph (3) to 
mean "...is not supported by adequate data..." (See <B>Fed. Reg. vol. 35, NO. 
131-Wed.</B>, July 8, 1970). FDA proceeded to review all available data relating 
to the effectiveness of products subject to NADA 65-441 to determine which 
label claims were supported by the requisite proof of effectiveness. That 
review resulted in a letter to the sponsor dated July 1, 1992, in which the 
agency stated that it had concluded that such data supported effectiveness 
only for the control and treatment of certain bacterial diseases susceptible 
to tetracycline hydrochloride in calves and swine.<P>

Thereafter, the sponsor complied with the evaluation of NAS/NRC and FDA's 
conclusions in the following manner:<P>

1.	The appropriate oral dose of 10 mg per pound body weight daily in each 
species has been incorporated in the labeling.<P>

2.	Claims for viral diseases have been deleted from the labeling 
completely.<P>

3.	Each disease claim on the label has been properly qualified with the 
appropriate genus and species of bacteria susceptible to tetracycline 
hydrochloride. Disease claims which were not so qualified have been deleted.<P>

4.	Claims made for prevention have been revised to read "Control of..." 
where appropriate.<P>

5.	The manufacturer's label carries the warning statement that treated 
animals must have the medicated water adjusted to compensate for variation in 
age and the weight of the animal, the nature and severity of disease signs, 
and environmental temperature and humidity, each of which affects water 
consumption.<P>

<B>4.	ANIMAL SAFETY:</B><P>
 NADA 65-441 was originally approved as safe on May 17, 
1954. No further safety data are required.<P>

<B>6.	HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</B><P>
 The NAS/NRC evaluation of the drug is concerned only 
with the effectiveness and safety of the drug for the treated animal. FDA's 
approval of the supplemental application did not involve reevaluation or 
reaffirmation of the human food safety data in the parent application.<P>

CFR Paragraph <B>556.720 Tetracycline</B><P>

A tolerance of  0.25 part per million has already been established for 
negligible residues of tetracycline in uncooked edible tissues of calves, 
swine, sheep, chickens, and turkeys.<P>
Withdrawal times: 7 days -swine, 4 days-calves<P>


<B>7.	AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</B><P>

This supplemental NADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act 
and demonstrates that POLYOTIC Soluble Powder Concentrate when used under its 
proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for the labeled indications. 
The approval provides for use of POLYOTIC Soluble Powder Concentrate for the 
control and treatment of bacterial enteritis and bacterial pneumonia in swine 
and calves.<P>

The "probably effective" finding of the NAS/NRC regarding Tetracycline 
hydrochloride which was published in the <B>FEDERAL REGISTER</B> of July 8, 1970, was 
subsequently reviewed by FDA, resulting in the upgrade to "effective" status 
with respect to the claims noted in the previous paragraph. The firm submitted 
revised labeling to conform and, therefore, this supplemental NADA complies 
with the NAS/NRC evaluation and FDA's conclusions.<P>

POLYOTIC Soluble Powder Concentrate for use in food-producing animals is 
currently on the market as an over-the-counter product. The extensive over-
the-counter marketing history of the products indicate that the conditions of 
use described in the labeling are reasonably certain to be followed in 
practice. Therefore, the Center for Veterinary Medicine has concluded that 
this product should retain over-the-counter marketing status.<P>

Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this 
is a Category II change. The approval of this change is not expected to have 
any adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug and, 
therefore, did not require a reevaluation of the human food or target animal 
safety data in the parent application.<P>

Under the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988, this 
approval does not qualify for an exclusivity period under section 
512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b 
(c)(2)(F)(iii)) because the supplemental application does not contain reports 
of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue 
studies) and in the case of food producing animals human food safety studies 
(other than bioequivalency or residue studies) essential to the approval and 
conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<P>

<B>EFFECTIVENESS:</B><P>
NADA 065-440 was originally approved as safe for use as labeled
on June 23, 1953.  The drug was the subject of National Academy of
Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) reports which were
published in the <b>FEDERAL REGISTER</b> of July 21, 1970 (<B>35 FR 11647</B>).
The Academy evaluated these products as probably effective for growth promotion
and feed efficiency and the treatment of animal diseases caused by pathogens
sensitive to chlortetracycline.<P>
The Academy states that: (1) Claims made regarding "for prevention of"
or "to prevent" should be replaced with "as an aid in the control of" or "to
aid in the control of"; (2) claims for growth promotion or stimulation
are disallowed and claims for faster gains and/or feed efficiency should be
stated as "may result in faster gains and/or improved feed efficiency under
appropriate conditions"; (3) each disease claim should be properly
qualified as "appropriate for use in (name of disease) caused by
pathogens sensitive to (name of drug) "; if the disease cannot be so
qualified the claim must be dropped; (4) claims pertaining to egg
production and hatchability should be changed to "May aid in maintaining egg
production and hatchability, under appropriate conditions, by controlling
pathogenic microorganisms"; (5) the labels should warn that treated
animals must actually consume enough medicated water or medicated feed to
provide a therapeutic dosage under the conditions that prevail and, as a
precaution, state the desired oral dose per unit of animal weight per day for
each species as a guide to effective usage of the preparation in drinking water
or feed: and (6) effective blood levels are required for each recommended
dosage.<P>
The Food and Drug Administration concurs with the Academy's findings,
interpreting the phrase "...cannot be so qualified..." in paragraph (3)
to mean "...is not supported by adequate data..." (See <B>Fed. Reg. vol.
35, NO. 140-Tues., July 21, 1970</B>). FDA proceeded to review all available data
relating to the effectiveness of products subject to NADA 065-440 to determine
which label claims were supported by the requisite proof of effectiveness. That
review resulted in a letter to the sponsor dated April 20, 1992, in which the
agency stated that it had concluded that such data supported effectiveness only
for the control and treatment of certain bacterial diseases susceptible to
chlortetracycline hydrochloride in chickens, turkeys and swine.<P>
Thereafter, the sponsor complied with the evaluation of NAS/NRC and FDA's
conclusions in the following manner:<P>
1.	Appropriate oral doses of 10 mg per pound body weight daily in swine and
cattle, 200-1000 mg/gallon for chickens and 400 mg/gal and 25 mg per pound body
weight for turkeys when treating bluecomb disease (transmissible
enteritis, coronaviral enteritis).<P>
2.	Claims for inappropriate viral diseases have been deleted from the labeling
completely.<P>
3.	Each disease claim on the label has been properly qualified with the
appropriate genus and species of bacteria susceptible to chlortetracycline
hydrochloride. Disease claims which were not so qualified have been deleted.<P>
4.	Claims made for prevention have been revised to read "Control of..." where
appropriate.<P>
5.	The manufacturer's label carries the warning statement that treated animals
must have the medicated water adjusted to compensate for variation in age and
the weight of animals, the nature and severity of disease signs, and
environmental temperature and humidity, each of which affects water
consumption.<P>
<b>ANIMAL SAFETY:</b><P>
NADA 065-440 was originally approved as safe on June
1953. No further safety data are required.<P>
<b>HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><P>
The NAS/NRC evaluation of the drug is concerned only
with the effectiveness and safety of the drug for the treated animal.  FDA's
approval of the supplemental application does not involve reevaluation or
reaffirmation of the human food safety data in the parent application. The
tolerances for residues of chlortetracycline are codified at <B>21 CFR 556.150.</B><P>
Withdrawal times: 24 hours for chickens, turkeys and cattle and swine.<P>
<b>AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><P>
This supplemental NADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrates that AUREOMYCIN Soluble Powder Concentrate when used under its
proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for the labeled indications.
The approval provides for use of AUREOMYCIN Soluble Powder Concentrate for the
control and treatment of specific diseases in swine, cattle, chickens and
turkeys.<P>
The "probably effective" finding of the NAS/NRC regarding chlortetracycline
hydrochloride which was published in the <b>FEDERAL REGISTER</b> of July 21,
1970, was subsequently reviewed by FDA, resulting in the upgrade to "effective"
status with respect to the claims noted in the previous paragraph. The firm
submitted revised labeling to conform and, therefore, this supplemental NADA
complies with the NAS/NRC evaluation and FDA's conclusions.<P>
When NADA 065-440 was reviewed under NAS / NRC / DESI program, it was an
over-the-counter product and this marketing status remains unchanged.
AUREOMYCIN Soluble Powder Concentrate for use in food-producing animals are
also currently on the market as over-the-counter products. Therefore, the
Center for Veterinary Medicine has concluded that this product should retain
over-the-counter marketing status.<P>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (<B>21 CFR
514.106(b)(2)</B>), this is a Category II change. The approval of
this change is not expected to have any adverse effect on the safety or
effectiveness of this new animal drug and, therefore, did not require a
reevaluation of the human food or target animal safety data in the parent
application.<P>
Under the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988, this
approval does not qualify for an exclusivity period under section
512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal, Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b (c)(2)(F)(iii))
because the supplemental application does not contain reports of new clinical
or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies)
and in the case of food producing animals human food safety studies
(other than bioequivalency or residue studies) essential to the approval
and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<P>

<p>
 <b>4.  Target Animal Safety and Effectiveness </b><P>
    The Supplemental New Animal Drug Application for milbemycin oxime tablets
contains adequate and well-controlled studies, which demonstrate safety and
confirm efficacy in puppies four to eight weeks of age and two pounds of body
weight or greater.<P>
    <b>Dose Establishment</b><P>
    No additional dose establishment work was required.  The minimum target dose
of milbemycin oxime 0.5 mg/kg body weight is established in NADA 140-915 for
the currently approved label indications.<P>
    <b>Target Animal Safety</b><P>
    Milbemycin oxime safety in dogs greater than 8 weeks of age is contained in
NADA 140-915.  To evaluate the safety of milbemycin oxime in younger puppies,
two rising dose toxicity studies in puppies beginning at 2 weeks and ending at
8 and 3 weeks of age respectively were performed: one pivotal study (six weeks
duration) and one corroborative study (two weeks duration).  Both studies were
conducted with the final tablet formulation.<P>
    Transient neurological signs were observed at elevated milbemycin oxime doses,
in 10% of puppies that  reacted at 5-9 mg/kg and up to 83% that reacted at
doses greater than 15 mg/kg.  The severity and duration of the signs increased
with elevated milbemycin oxime doses.  All animals returned to normal within 48
hours, and in most puppies the clinical signs were gone within six (6) hours
irregardless of the puppy's age.<P>
    <b>Pivotal Safety Study</b><P>
    A six week safety study in beagle puppies beginning at 2 weeks of age, given
oral doses of milbemycin oxime (as tablets) at dosage levels ranging from 5X to
&gt;30X the recommended minimum dose rate (0.5 mg/kg).<P>

    <b>Study Director:</b> Martin R. Gilman, Ph.D.<P>
    <b>Animals:</b><p>        Pure bred Beagle puppies.<br>
                Three groups of 12 puppies each, 6 males + 6 females beginning at 2 weeks
of age.<br>
                Control - 1 group of 12 puppies received placebo tablets.<P>
    <b>Dosage form:</b><p>    Tablets were combined to achieve the desired dose levels.  Group
1 received one 2.3 mg tablet, Group 2, three 2.3 mg tablets and Group 3, five
2.3 mg tablets. <P>
    <b>Dosage:</b>     Control (placebo tablets)<P>
    <b>Group 1</b><p>   1X dose range (2.3 mg tablet), average dose received was 2.98 (6X
labeled minimum effective dose) mg/kg at 2 weeks to 0.83 mg/kg (1.6X labeled
minimum effective dose) at 8 weeks.<P>
    <b>Group 2 </b><p>   3X dose range (3 X 2.3 mg tablets = 6.9 mg), average dose received
was 9.61 mg/kg (19X labeled minimum effective dose) at 2 weeks to 2.66 mg/kg
(~5X labeled minimum effective dose) at 8 weeks.<P>
    <b>Group 3 </b><p>  5X dose range (5 X 2.3 = 11.5 mg tablet), average dose received was
14.72 mg/kg (~29X labeled minimum effective dose) at 2 weeks to 4.41 mg/kg (~9X
labeled minimum effective dose) at 8 weeks.<P>
    <b>Route of Administration:</b>    Orally by tablet, finished dosage form.<P>
    <b>Test Duration:</b>          Puppies received one dose at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of age.<P>
    <b>Pertinent Parameters Measured:</b><p>   Clinical observations, body weights, hematology and blood
chemistry, and urine analysis.<P>
    <b>Results:</b><P>
    A typical, reversible macrolide-induced syndrome was observed at elevated
doses of milbemycin oxime.  The effects were similar in severity and duration
to those observed in older dogs (see Freedom of Information Summary for
original NADA 140-915) and were dependent on milbemycin oxime dose.  Effects
were not age or sex dependent.  Two puppies in the 1X group and two in the 3X
group exhibited diarrhea.  Thirteen puppies in the placebo (1), 3X (4) and 5X
(8) groups exhibited neurological signs consisting of trembling, vocalization,
and/or ataxia.  GGT (gamma glutamyl transferase) was slightly increased in the
3X and 5X groups but not the 1X group.  No other adverse side effects were
observed during the study.<P>
    <b>Conclusion:</b><P>
    This toxicity study demonstrated the safety of milbemycin oxime in puppies
between four and eight weeks of age or greater and two pounds body weight or
greater.  There were no animals in the 1X group observed with adverse clinical
signs and abnormal clinical chemistry profiles.  Animals (2 weeks of age) were
observed in the 3X and 5X groups with adverse clinical signs.  No clinical
signs were seen in the 3X group at 4, 6 or 8 weeks.  Puppies four weeks and
older had only minor neurological signs in the 5X group.  The severity and
duration of clinical signs appeared to be dose dependent.  Therefore
Interceptor is recommended for use in puppies four weeks of age or greater and
two pounds of body weight or greater.  <P>

group 3 (11.5 mg) following the second and third dosing.  Tremors were in 2 of
3 animals in group 3 following the second dosing and all animals following
third dosing.  One group 3 animal was sensitive to touch following post-dosing.
All of the affected animals were normal 24 hours post dosing.<P>
    <b>Conclusion:</b><P>
    This toxicity study indicated the safety of milbemycin in puppies three weeks

<b>Corroborative Safety and Efficacy Studies</b> (1987-88 &amp; 1989-90
Clinical Trial Data from Puppies Between Two and Eight Weeks of Age)<P>
<b>Objective</b><P>
    A multi-location, well-controlled clinical field trial was conducted during
1987-88.  The overall objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
monthly administration of milbemycin oxime for the prevention of heartworm
disease and removal and control of hookworm infection when used under typical
veterinary practice conditions.  A second clinical field trial was conducted
during 1989-90 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of monthly administration of
milbemycin oxime for the additional indications of removal and control of
roundworms and whipworms when used under typical veterinary practice
conditions.  Safety and efficacy data from puppies, eight (8) weeks of age and
less, enrolled in the 1987-88 and 1989-90 clinical field trials was extracted
and analyzed in support of the label change for this supplement to the NADA.<P>
    <b>Methods</b><P>
Dogs received monthly milbemycin oxime treatments for a total of ten months (11
treatments) in the 1987-88 clinical field trial and for a total of two months
(3 treatments) in the 1989-90 clinical field trial.<P>
    <b>Dosage and Administration</b><P>
    Milbemycin oxime tablets were administered orally at the recommended minimum
dosage level of 0.5 mg/kg body weight at monthly dosing intervals.  The
recommended dosing schedule was:<P>

</pre>

<b>Results</b><P>
    <b>1987-88 Clinical Field Trial</b><P>
    A total of twelve puppies (6 females and 6 males) from four (4) veterinary
hospitals, five to eight weeks of age, received INTERCEPTOR (milbemycin oxime)
at the recommended label dose.  The hospitals were located in the following
states:  Florida and South Carolina (Table 3).<P>
    Of the twelve puppies enrolled, seven (7) puppies (58.3%) successfully
completed the 10-month study regimen.  The puppy population breakdown, by breed
and sex and by age and weight at the first milbemycin oxime dosing, is given in
Table 1.<P>
    There were no investigator documented adverse reported reactions.  Comments
were received from owners, most concerning vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss.
However, these responses were not treatment related as determined by the
investigator.  Also, diarrhea, vomiting and anorexia are included on the
approved label for Interceptor&#174; Flavor Tabs.<P>
    One hundred percent (100%) of the seven (7) puppies, six to eight weeks of age
at the study initiation, were heartworm free after receiving 10 months of
milbemycin oxime at monthly intervals.  Eighty-nine percent (89%) of nine (9)
puppies were cleared of hookworm (Ancylostoma caninum) fecal egg shedding 7-10
days after receiving the first milbemycin oxime treatment.  One hundred percent
(100%) of the reinfected puppies were cleared 7 to 10 days after each
subsequent treatment.  Complete control of hookworm infections, as measured by
the total number of puppies free of fecal egg shedding, was one hundred percent
(100%) after four (4) milbemycin oxime treatments in puppies less than eight
weeks of age at study initiation.  Additionally six (6) puppies (100%) were
cleared of roundworms (<i>Toxocara canis</i>&#160;) after a single milbemycin treatment.<P>
    <b>1989-90 Clinical Trial</b><P>
    A total of 19 puppies (7 females and 12 males) from four veterinary hospitals,
three to eight weeks of age and enrolled in this field trial, received
INTERCEPTOR (milbemycin oxime) at the recommended label dose.  The hospitals
were located in the following states:  Alabama, Florida, Texas and California
(Table 3).  Of the 19 puppies enrolled, 18 puppies (94.7%) successfully
completed the 60-day study regimen.  The puppy population breakdown, by breed
and sex and by age and weight at the time of first dosing, is given in Table 2.
  <P>
    Eighteen of nineteen (94.7%) puppies (3 to 8 weeks of age) were cleared of
roundworm (<i>Toxocara canis</i>&#160;) fecal egg shedding after the first milbemycin
oxime treatment, and 100% of dogs were cleared after each subsequent treatment.
Total (100%) control of all roundworm infections was established in the puppy
population after two (2) milbemycin oxime treatments.  There were no adverse
reactions noted during the study. <P>
    The number (%) of puppies (3 to 8 weeks of age) cleared of hookworm
(<i>Ancylostoma caninum</i>&#160;) fecal egg shedding was 100%, 7 to 10 days after
each milbemycin oxime treatment.  Control of hookworm infections was 91.7%
after two (2) milbemycin oxime treatments.  One puppy out of the twelve that
completed the trial was shedding hookworm eggs at each monthly recheck,
presumably due to reinfection (the prepatent period of <i>A. caninum</i>&#160; is
14-21 days).<P>
    Although whipworm infection is not considered a disease of young puppies and
the prepatent period is greater than eight weeks six cases were diagnosed as
positive for whipworms upon initial exam.  All were fecal negative at the 7-10
day recheck and remained free of whipworms throughout the remainder of the
trial.  Control of whipworm infection was 100%.<P>

<b>Conclusions</b><P>
    The data in this supplement establishes the safety and confirms the efficacy
of milbemycin oxime administered one time for the removal of intestinal
nematode infections in puppies four to eight weeks of age.  In addition,
monthly administration of milbemycin oxime was safe and effective in the
control of intestinal nematode infections and in the prevention of heartworm
infections in puppies four to eight weeks of age.  <P>
<b>6.  Human Safety</b><P>
    Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not required for approval of this supplemental NADA.  The drug is to be labeled
for use in dogs, which are non-food animals.<P>
<br>
<b>7.  Agency Conclusions</b><P>
    The data in support of this supplemental NADA application complies with
the requirements of Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the
implementing regulations.  It demonstrates that Interceptor &#174; (milbemycin
oxime) flavor tabs, when used under the labeled conditions of use, are safe and
effective.  <P>
    According to the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106), this
is a Category II change.  This supplement provides for the use of milbemycin
oxime in dogs four weeks of age or greater and two pounds of body weight or
greater.  This approval did require a reevaluation of the safety and
effectiveness data in the parent application and evaluation of new target
animal safety data submitted in the supplemental application.  <br>
    <br>
    Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(FFDCA), this approval qualifies for THREE years of marketing exclusivity
beginning on the date of approval because the supplemental application contains
reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence
studies) essential to the approval of the application and conducted or
sponsored by the applicant.  The three years of marketing exclusivity applies
only to new weight (two pounds or greater) and age (4 weeeks of age or greater)
specifications for which the supplemental application was approved.  This
exclusivity period will expire three years from the date of the approval
letter.<P>
    The drug is restricted to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian
because professional expertise is required to determine the existence of
hookworm, roundworm and/or whipworm infection.  In addition, professional
expertise is required to determine the existence of heartworm infection, and to
then properly treat existing heartworm infection prior to starting treatment
with Interceptor &#174; (milbemycin oxime) flavor tabs in a prevention
program.<br>

<h3><a name="MOD II">
FDA DEDICATES MOD II</A></H3><p>
                         by Karen A. Kandra<br>
<br>
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reached a major milestone on October 21,
1996, as the new home of FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM), Office of
Research was dedicated by FDA Commissioner, Dr. David Kessler, and other
dignitaries who played important roles in bringing the project to fruition. <br>
<br>
	In October 1994, a group of people gathered in Calverton, MD, and made a
commitment  to work together to produce a state-of-the-art research facility,
destined to become one of the foremost large animal research centers in the
world.  Congressman Steny Hoyer, Senator Paul Sarbanes, and Senator Barbara
Mikulski (all from Maryland) each provided strong support and were instrumental
in getting the project off the ground.  A team of qualified professionals was
headed up by Jag Bhargava, Development Director for the General Services
Administration (GSA), who cooperated with the contractor, William M. Schlosser
Company, Inc., design architects of S3E, and Parsons Brinkerhoff, and officials
from CVM and other parts of FDA to complete this challenging project six months
ahead of schedule as well as under budget.  The unprecedented success of this
project is the result of a partnering effort involving hard work, dedication,
and personal sacrifices of many individuals with the same goal. <br>
<br>
The new animal research center will serve the entire Agency's large animal
needs and will provide the opportunity for collaborative efforts with the
University of Maryland, the United States Department of Agriculture, and other
scientific organizations to conduct critical research so vital to the
protection of the Nation's food supply.	<br>
<br>
The MOD II complex encompasses 60 acres on Muirkirk Road in Laurel, Maryland.
There are 18 buildings on the site including the main building, which contains
office and administrative support space, laboratories, and multipurpose animal
rooms.  There are 31 laboratory rooms which are designed for chemistry,
biochemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, immunology, nutrition, and
toxicology.  Laboratory rooms include a radioactive materials lab, mass
spectrometry lab, walk-in cold room, and an analytical instrument room.
Equipment includes 49 chemical fume hoods, 5 radiation fume hoods, and 4
biological safety cabinets.  <br>
<br>
The facility includes small and large animal clinics, each with exam rooms;
surgery rooms; recovery rooms; X-ray suites; and necropsy areas.  The large
animal clinic is equipped with a walk-in refrigerator and freezer and is served
by an overhead monorail system.<br>
<br>
There are separate animal buildings to house beef cattle, horses, lactating
cattle, calves, sheep, and swine.  Animal holding areas contain fully
adjustable pens to offer flexibility in research study design.  The dairy
building can accommodate 14 lactating cows in the milking parlor and 10 veal
calves.  There is also a dog building with individual pens and sheltered
outside runs.  The feed processing facility has the capability to prepare
customized animal rations, and conduct feed processing research.  The site also
includes 38 acres of pasture.<br>
<br>
An aquaculture building provides approximately 5,700 net square feet of usable
space to accommodate a variety of fresh water aquatic species.  Water flow
rates and temperature are adjustable to each of the twelve 500 gallon insulated
tanks, and twenty-four 100 gallon tanks available.  One room is equipped to
conduct metabolism studies and can incorporate radiolabeled compounds.<br>
<br>
The animal research buildings are all environmentally controlled (temperature
and humidity).  All animal research buildings contain an animal holding area,
an office/lab room, and a feed storage area.  Research buildings are supported
by the heating and cooling plant, which is also equipped with generators to
provide emergency power.<br>
<br>
The Office of Research at MOD II will carry out the following important
functions:<br>
<br>
<UL>
<LI>conduct studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of drugs, feed additives,
diagnostic agents and devices used in animals.  <br>
<br>
<LI>review tissue residue and animal feed methods for drugs in support of new
animal drug approvals and other regulatory activities.<br>
<br>
<LI>develop and validate analytical methods for drug residues, additives, and
contaminants in animal tissues and feeds.<br>
<br>
<LI>develop databases on the pharmacokinetics of drugs and feed additives in
animals including fish.<br>
<br>
<LI>conduct depletion studies of residues of animal drugs, feed additives, and
contaminants (natural and industrial) in food animals including fish.<br>
<br>
<LI>conduct metabolism studies in food animals, including fish, which identify
other residues of concern from the use of drugs.

<a name="PRICE">SUBSCRIPTION PRICE INCREASE</A><br>
<br>
The Government Printing Office has informed us that the subscription price for
the <i>FDA Veterinarian</i> has been increased to $9.00 per year domestic and
$11.25 per year for foreign subscriptions.  These price increases are due to
increased costs of printing and mailing.  While we regret that these increases
were necessary, we believe that these prices still represent a good value for a
newsletter full of information you can use right away.  Subscription order
forms are available through the <i>FDA Veterinarian</i>.  In addition, credit
card subscription orders may be placed by telephone (202) 512-1800 or by fax
(202) 512-2250.  VISA, MasterCard, and Discover cards are accepted.<br>

<a name="LITE">NEW RULES FOR "LITE" PET FOODS</A><P>
                                    by David A. Dzanis, D.V.M., Ph.D., DACVN<P>
As Americans become more health conscious with respect to food for their own
consumption, they are reading food labels and choosing products more carefully.
Many people are extending this scrutiny to food for their pets as well.  Pet
food labels are regulated by different rules than are foods for human
consumption, but reading and understanding a pet food label will enable
consumers to make proper food choices for their pets, too.<br>
<br>
	Pet food labeling is regulated at two levels.  The Federal regulations,
enforced by FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM), establish standards
applicable for all animal feeds: proper identification of product, net quantity
statement, manufacturer's address, and proper listing of ingredients.  Some
States also enforce their own labeling regulations.  Many of these follow the
model pet food regulations established by the Association of American Feed
Control Officials (AAFCO), which establishes other labeling requirements such
as the guaranteed analysis, nutritional adequacy statement and calorie content
statement.  CVM works very closely with AAFCO on developing the model
regulations.<br>
<br>
	Obesity in pets is probably the most common nutritional problem today.  Thus,
it is not surprising that more and more "lite" pet food products are now
available.  However, the new FDA regulations governing the use of these types
of terms for human food products do not apply to pet foods.  Thus, there have
been problems with how some pet food manufacturers were using the term and how
consumers were perceiving these claims.  For example, even if one
manufacturer's "lite" pet food was lower in calories than its regular product,
the calorie contents of products vary widely.  Thus, one company's "lite"
product could actually be higher in calories than another's regular product.
Also, some claims were made based on volume, not weight, so a pet food could be
"lite" simply by "puffing up" the food with more air.  Finally, calorie content
statements as stipulated in the AAFCO model regulations were only voluntary,
and in practice rarely appeared on pet food labels.  These facts made it
difficult for the pet owner to fully assess and compare the calorie content of
products and determine whether a "lite" product was truly "lite."  <br>
<br>
	In August, new AAFCO model regulations governing the use of descriptive terms
such as "lite" and "low fat" were passed by the membership at its annual
meeting in San Diego.  These new rules represent several years of hard work by
the AAFCO Pet Food Committee and input from the industry to develop a means to
allow for non-misleading use of these terms on pet food labels.  As a result of
the new regulations, some firms will be required to modify either their labels
or formulas for some products.<br>
<br>
	Terms such as "lite" and "low calorie" convey a very strong message to
consumers.   In FDA regulations for human foods, "lite" foods must be a set
percentage lower in calories and fat compared to an industry average for each
category of food (for example, snack foods, bakery products, breakfast
cereals).  Few people would expect a "lite" ice cream to be as low in calories
as "lite" ketchup, but it is not unreasonable to expect a "lite" ice cream to
be lower in calories than the average regular ice cream on the market.  The
comparison must be based on an equal amount of both products.  In most cases,
the amounts are based on equivalent weights.  For example, all snack food
claims are based on a 30-gram (approximately one-ounce) serving size, whether
popcorn, pretzels, or cheese puffs.  The use of smaller serving sizes or a
comparison on volume was deemed inherently misleading.  Thus, a product cannot
be "lite" simply because the product is offered in one-half ounce pieces
instead of one ounce.  Instead, the serving size is "two pieces."  Also, a
cheese puff is not "lite" even if a cup of it contains less calories than a cup
of pretzels.   <br>
<br>
	Although the specifics are different, the rationale used for human foods were
also employed in the new AAFCO regulations.  Three different categories of pet
foods, based on moisture content, were established (see Table 1).  The criteria
the product must meet is in terms of weight, not volume, and an AAFCO calorie
content statement must also be on the label.  The maximum calorie allowances
for "lite" pet foods reflect a percentage reduction in calories relative to the
average calories found for products on the market under each category.  The
percentage reduction compared to the average is 15 percent for dog foods, and
10 percent for cat foods.  These percentages are less stringent than those
required for human "lite" products (33 percent) to accommodate the different
nature of pet foods.  Also, unlike for human foods, where a "lite" claim refers
to both calorie and fat reduction, a "lite" claim for a pet food only means it
is lower in calories (see "lean," below).    <br>
<br>
	For products that cannot meet the criteria to be called "lite," comparative
claims (for example, "less" or "reduced" calories) are still allowed.  However,
"less" claims must include the percent reduction and the product of comparison.
An example would be "Brand X Special Cat Food has 25 percent less calories than
Brand X Original Formula."  Again, these comparisons should be made on the
basis of weight, not volume.  Comparing products between categories (e.g., a
canned vs. a dry food) is misleading.  Any product bearing a "less" claim must
make a valid AAFCO calorie content statement as well.  <br>
<br>
	The fat-related claims mirror those for calories.  The term "lean" to describe
low fat is assumed equivalent to "lite" as an alternative to low calorie.
Instead of a calorie content statement, products bearing fat-related claims
must state a maximum fat content in addition to the required minimum guarantee.
Table 2 shows the maximum fat contents allowed for various categories of pet
food bearing a "lean" claim.<br>
<br>
	The new regulations won't become effective before January 1998, although some
products may bear revised labels before that time.  Regardless, simply feeding
a pet a "lite" product will not address its problems with weight control all by
itself.  Proper portion control, elimination of snacks, and a sound exercise
program are all important components to helping the pet achieve a healthy
weight.  <br>

<a name="POSILAC">VMAC ENDORSES POST-APPROVAL MONITORING PROGRAM FOR POSILAC&#174;</A><br>
<br>
The Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee (VMAC) met on November 20, 1996 to
consider the issue of bovine somatotropin (bST).  FDA approved Monsanto
Company's Posilac&#174; in November 1993, following an extensive and
comprehensive review of the product's safety and efficacy, including human food
safety.  Posilac&#174; is currently the only recombinant bovine somatotropin
product approved for increasing milk production in dairy cattle in the U.S.
Prior to approval, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) determined that use
of Posilac&#174; caused a small increase in the incidence of mastitis and an
increase in the use of medications for mastitis and other health problems.  At
a meeting held in March 1993, the VMAC concluded that the increased potential
for drug residue in milk could be managed by practices currently in use by the
dairy industry.  <br>
<br>
	At the time of commercial introduction of Posilac&#174;, the Monsanto Company
initiated a Post-Approval Monitoring Program (PAMP) to determine if mastitis
incidence and antibiotic use was manageable under actual use conditions and to
determine if label directions were adequate.  The key components of the PAMP
were:<br>
<br>
1.	A proactive system of collecting Adverse Drug Experience Reports,<br>
<br>
2.	A program of tracking milk residues by key dairy States before and after the
approval of Posilac&#174;,<br>
<br>
3.	A 28-herd study to evaluate Posilac&#174; under actual conditions of use.<br>
<br>
	This PAMP is the most extensive post-approval study ever conducted for any
animal product.  The herd component involved 28 herds representing 1213 cows in
key dairy producing States.  The results of this study reflect the general good
health of dairy cattle given Posilac&#174; for a single lactation under
commercial conditions.  Stringent requirements were placed on the participants
regarding data collection, recordkeeping, veterinary consultation, daily
observations, etc.  Throughout the entire program, FDA closely monitored all
PAMP activities.  Special drug experience reports were submitted to CVM every
90 days, including status reports, units of product sold, etc.  FDA conducted
on-site inspections of the PAMP components five times during the Program.
During these visits investigators reviewed raw data, interviewed clinical
investigators, reviewed the firm's Quality Assurance Standard Operating
Procedures for the herd study, and reviewed test article storage and inventory.
In addition, CVM scientists conducted farm inspections of 10 herds selected
from the 28 herds.  They interviewed herd managers and veterinarians, reviewed
the recordkeeping systems, and observed drug administration and inspected drug
storage areas and inventories.  No significant problems were found.  Data
integrity was acceptable, and farm records from data entry to data analysis
showed excellent fidelity.  CVM concluded from data collected in the PAMP that
the effects of the use of Posilac&#174; in this study were in close agreement
with the effects observed in the preclearance studies.  <br>
<br>
	Monsanto officials presented information from their State tracking program
showing that there have been no changes in the percentage of milk discarded due
to violative residues attributable to the use of Posilac&#174;.<br>
<br>
	The Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee was asked to consider the following
two questions prior to the start of the meeting:<br>
<br>
1.	Does the proposed revised labeling for Posilac&#174; provide adequate
directions for actual conditions of use?<br>
<br>
2.	Do the results of the Post-Approval Monitoring Program adequately address
the safety of the milk supply as it relates to the use of Posilac&#174;?<br>
<br>
	At the end of the meeting each VMAC member affirmatively responded to these
questions.  The VMAC concluded that the labeling of Posilac&#174; provides
adequate directions for actual conditions of use.  In addition, the VMAC
endorsement of the final results of the PAMP confirms that bST is indeed safe
and has no adverse effect on the milk supply.<br>
<br>
	FDA management also agrees that Monsanto Company's Post-Approval Monitoring
Program adequately addressed the safety of the milk supply as related to
Posilac&#174;.  Recently, Dr. Michael A. Friedman, FDA's Deputy Commissioner
for Operations, told the Monsanto Company, "The issues surrounding this highly
visible product are in many ways a microcosm of the science and public policy
challenges that industry and the Agency face in bringing new products to the
market place that offer potential benefits to society...I believe the
outstanding quality of your studies and your commitment to working closely with
the Agency in meeting your PAMP goals establish a model for successfully
dealing with challenging approval issues."<br>
<br>
<a name="EXTRALABEL">FDA PUBLISHES FINAL RULE ON EXTRALABEL DRUG USE IN ANIMALS</A><br>
 <br>
In the November 7, 1996 <i>Federal Register</i>, FDA published a final rule to
allow veterinarians to prescribe extralabel uses of certain approved animal
drugs and approved human drugs for animals under certain conditions.  This
action implements the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act of 1994
(AMDUCA).  This regulation provides veterinarians with greater flexibility in
the use of approved drugs in animals.  These regulations put AMDUCA into effect
on December 9, 1996.<br>
<br>
	The notice of proposed rulemaking published in the <i>Federal Register</i> on
May 17, 1996.  FDA received and considered approximately 110 comments in
preparing the final rule.<br>
<br>
	Prior to the enactment of AMDUCA, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(the Act) required users of approved new animal drug products to follow the
exact directions on the labeling of the drug.  This extralabel use restriction
precluded use of an approved drug in species or for indications (disease or
other conditions) not listed in the labeling, use of an approved drug at dosage
levels higher than those stated on the label, and other extralabel purposes.
In addition, the Act did not provide for the use of human drugs for treating
animals.<br>
<br>
	Because of AMDUCA, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act will now permit
veterinarians, like physicians, to prescribe extralabel uses of approved drugs
for their patients.  Although certain restrictions have been placed on
veterinarians prescribing animal and human drugs in an extralabel manner, these
restrictions generally apply only to the use of drugs extralabelly in
food-producing animals.  The key constraints are that any extralabel use must
not result in violative residues in food-producing animals, the use must be by
or on the order of a veterinarian within the context of a
veterinarian-client-patient relationship, and the use must be in conformance
with the new regulations.<br>
<br>
	AMDUCA includes a number of provisions that permit the Agency to restrict
extralabel use in certain circumstances.  For example, if there is a finding
that there is a reasonable probability that an extralabel use may present a
risk to public health from drug residues in animal-derived food, the Agency may
establish a safe level for a residue for such extralabel use by regulation or
order and may require the development of analytical methods for residue
detection.  If, after affording an opportunity for public comment, FDA finds
that an extralabel animal drug use presents a risk to public health or that no
analytical method has been developed and submitted, the Agency may prohibit
such extralabel use.  The following prohibitions currently apply to the uses of
drugs in food-producing animals:<br>
<br><BLOCKQUOTE>
Chloramphenicol<br>
Clenbuterol<br>
Diethylstilbestrol (DES)<br>
Dimetridazole<br>
Ipronidazole<br>
Other nitroimidazoles<br>
Furazolidone (except for approved topical use)<br>
Nitrofurazone (except for approved topical use)<br>
Sulfonamide drugs in lactating dairy cattle (except approved use of
sulfadimethoxine, sulfabromomethazine and
	sulfaethoxypyridazine)</BLOCKQUOTE><br>

	Neither AMDUCA nor the implementing regulations are intended to lessen the
responsibility of the manufacturer, the veterinarian, or the food producer with
regard to drug residues.  Under AMDUCA, any amount of residue resulting from an
extralabel use would constitute a violation of the Act if a safe level or
tolerance has not been established.<br>
 <br>
	Title 21 of the <i>Code of Federal Regulations</i> is now amended to add a new
part 530, titled "Extralabel Drug Use in Animals."  A link to the text of the
rule is available for review or downloading on CVM's Internet Website at

<A NAME="MINOR">MAJOR CONCERNS FOR MINOR SPECIES</A><P>
                                                         by Karen A. Kandra<br>
<br>
On September 12-13, 1996, FDA cosponsored the eighth NRSP-7/FDA workshop
titled, "Drug Availability for Minor Species in the 21st Century."  Animal
producers, veterinarians, scientists, and regulators attended the workshop to
exchange ideas on approaches to disease problems and drug priorities.<br>
<br>
	The USDA/Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service National
Research Support Project No. 7 (NRSP-7) is designed to address the shortage of
minor use animal drugs by funding and overseeing the efficacy, animal safety,
human food safety research and the environmental assessment required for drug
approval.   Minor animal drug uses are analogous to human orphan drug uses, for
which the market is insufficient to justify the costly research expenditures by
a pharmaceutical firm necessary to obtain FDA approval.  Minor species are
defined by exclusion.  That is, any that are not major species.  Major species
are horses, cattle, swine, turkeys, chickens, dogs, and cats.  Minor species
include sheep, goats, fish, gamebirds, rabbits, ratites, and deer among others.
Minor uses also include certain diseases in major species that occur
infrequently or in limited geographical locations.<br>
<br>
	Projects are prioritized from Animal Drug Requests which originate from a
variety of sources:  producer groups, academicians, and pharmaceutical
companies.  The regional coordinators, principal investigators, and CVM
collaborate to determine what data is required to support safety and efficacy
claims for the product requested, and then to develop protocols for any
necessary studies.  Results of these studies are reviewed by CVM, and
ultimately are placed in a Public Master File, which may be used by a
pharmaceutical company to support an original or supplemental New Animal Drug
Application (NADA).<br>
<br>
	In the past 10 years, NRSP-7 has received over 280 requests.  The majority of
these requests are not feasible for one reason or another.  However, the data
necessary to support approvals for 24 of these requests have been published as
Public Master Files.  Of these, 19 have been used to support supplemental
NADA's, and have been approved.  Two complete files have not been acted upon by
the company.  Three requests have been recently completed and are waiting for
filing of supplemental NADA's.  These are formalin for fish,
sulfadimethoxine/ormetoprim for chukar partridges, and ivermectin injection for
bison.  NRSP-7 has several additional public master files nearing completion.
There are currently more than 30 other projects in development for more than 17
drugs and 10 species.<br>
<br>
	At the September workshop, introductory comments were made by Dr. Alistair I.
Webb, University of Florida, and Drs. Stephen Sundlof and Andrew Beaulieu of
the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM).  Dr. Andres de la Concha from the
Texas Agriculture Experiment Station followed with a discussion of the lack of
drugs to treat diseases of sheep and goats.  Internal parasites and pneumonia
are the most important diseases of sheep and dairy goats.  Dr. de la Concha
cited antibiotics and anthelmintics as the most needed drugs.<br>
<br>
	Dr. Lowell Wilson, Pennsylvania State University, addressed the medical needs
of veal calves.  He stated that the average slaughter age is now 19-20 weeks,
doubling in the last 10 years.  He sees the following drug needs for veal
calves: amoxicillin, ampicillin, penicillin, and decoquinate.<br>
<br>
	Dr. Barry Marshall, New Zealand Embassy, spoke about farm raised deer.  He
said that about 1.5 million deer are farmed in the United States on 4,500
farms.  The market for New Zealand venison exports is about $144 million, and
live deer about $600,000.<br>
<br>
	Mr. Bill MacFarlane of MacFarlane Pheasant Farm, Janesville, Wisconsin,
addressed problems associated with the production of game birds.  About 25 to
50 million birds are produced annually.  These birds are raised outdoors, and
stress is a concern.  Gapeworm and blackhead are common diseases.  Medications
provided in drinking water are not practical since birds drink from puddles
during rainy seasons.  The need for approved medicated feeds is critical since
extra-label use does not apply to medicated feeds.<br>
<br>
	Dr. Thomas Nickerson, Weaverville, CA, discussed drug availability for
ratites.  Emus are popular for their meat and leather; ostriches for meat,
feathers, and hide; and rheas for body fat on the tail used to make oil for
moisturizing skin.  Drugs are needed to treat diseases such as avian influenza,
external parasites, flukes, and equine encephalitis in emus.  Most diseases
attack young birds under 3 months of age, and the birds are not slaughtered
until approximately 10 months of age.  The ratites have a renal-portal system
which carries drugs directly to the kidney, causing more toxicity, which is a
unique problem.<br>
<br>
	Dr. William Lance, Wildlife Pharmaceuticals, Inc., discussed the needs of
zoologic species.  This is a focused market, since only about 10,000 animals
are included.  Major needs are reproductive modifiers, long-acting
neuroleptics, sustained-release antibiotics, and anthelmintics.<br>
<br>
	Dr. John Pitts, Quicene, WA, addressed the problems of aquaculture.  The
aquaculture industry has successfully cooperated with CVM and the
pharmaceutical industry in prioritizing the drug needs of the industry and
assisting with studies to support future approvals.  The need for medicated
feeds is also paramount in this industry.<br>
<br>
	Dr. Ruth Francis-Floyd, University of Florida, discussed the problems of the
ornamental fish industry.  This is an industry worth over fifty million dollars
per year where there are no approved drugs.  Aquarium fish are growing in
popularity and the biggest problems facing the species are external parasites,
bacterial infections, and fungal infections.<br>
<br>
	Dr. Chris Hayhow, Hoechst Roussel, addressed the drug availability issues for
rabbits, a species which has a growing market in fur, exhibition, pets, and
laboratory areas.  He estimated that 2.3 million households have rabbits, with
pet ownership increasing rapidly.  Special challenges facing rabbit enthusiasts
are disease, parasites, and production problems in their animals.  There are
currently only three approved products: sulfaquinoxaline, lasalocid, and
tetracycline.<br>
<br>
	Dr. Brad Smith, Oregon State University, reported on the growing popularity of
llamas.  With about 100,000 in North America, they are increasing at a rate of
about 25 percent per year.  Now used as companion animals, as well as for
guarding sheep, they are prone to P. tenuis, a gastrointestinal nematode, liver
flukes, and bacterial diseases like tuberculosis, Johne's disease, and
brucellosis.  The alpaca is a smaller animal, similar to llamas, very popular
for its quality fur.  Both llamas and alpacas are gaining in popularity and
long-term growth of the industry is expected.<br>
<br>
	On the second day of the workshop, speakers from the pharmaceutical industry
presented their perspective on the problem.  There was common agreement that
firms adding minor species claims to their labels increase legal liability.
This potentially places the company's assets and major species claims at risk.
Despite these risks, several companies have gone through the process of
supplementing their approved labels with minor species claims.<br>
<br>
	In order to successfully expand the availability of minor use therapeutants,
there is a need for NRSP-7, pharmaceutical companies, and CVM to collaborate
early in the product development planning, including the design of study
protocols.  These cooperative efforts benefit all parties and expedite the
process.<br>
<br>
	The workshop concluded with a lively panel discussion chaired by Dr. Robert
Ringer, the National Coordinator of the NRSP-7 program.  Members of the panel
included Dr. Joe Gloyd of AVMA, Dr. James Wilkerson, a lawyer and veterinarian,
Dr. Harold Hafs of Rutgers University, Dr. Kurt Mann, a veterinary advisor to
the House Committee on Agriculture, Dr. Michael Blackwell, Deputy Director of
the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine, and Dr. Richard Carnevale of the Animal
Health Institute.  The discussion touched on many issues introduced throughout
the 2-day workshop.  Most comments concentrated on how to improve the program
so as to increase availability of therapeutic drugs labeled for minor species,
and means to address the problems facing specific industries.<br>
	NRSP-7 will publish the proceedings from this workshop by the summer of 1997.

<A NAME="CODEX">VETERINARY CODEX HOLDS TENTH SESSION IN COSTA RICA</A><p>

   by Karen A. Kandra<br>
<br>
The Codex Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods held its Tenth
Session from October 29 to November 1, 1996 in San Jose, Costa Rica, at the
invitation of the U.S. Government in cooperation with the Government of Costa
Rica and the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA).
The Session was chaired by Dr. Stephen Sundlof, Director, FDA, Center for
Veterinary Medicine.  Attendees represented 34 member countries and 12
international organizations.<br>
<br>
	An important role of Codex is working to improve food quality and safety while
facilitating international trade and harmonization.  There was a major
discussion concerning elements of risk assessment for the determination of
veterinary drug residues in food.  The Committee identified seven areas
requiring further work:<br>
<br>
<UL>
<LI>better delineation of the respective roles of the Committee and Joint FAO/WHO
Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA);<br>
<br>
<LI>improvement of transparency of the process;<br>
<br>
<LI>recognition that the application of safety factors and other conventions to
address uncertainty were not strictly scientifically based and therefore,
introduced an element of risk management into the risk assessment process;<br>
<br>
<LI>consideration of the benefits of the use of veterinary drugs as well as
risks, for animals as well as humans;<br>
<br>
<LI>problems in relation to animal studies and the potential of using in vitro
studies as alternatives for such studies;<br>
<br>
<LI>problems related to the generation of residue data for minor species;<br>
<br>
<LI>problems related to old substances which had not been evaluated under modern
criteria, but which were still in use in many countries, and substances on the
so-called "inactive list."</UL><br>

	The recommendations of the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA)
for thirteen veterinary drugs were evaluated.  Acceptable Daily Intakes (ADI's)
and Maximum Residue Limits (MRL's) were allocated/confirmed for clenbuterol,
abamectin, moxidectin, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, tetracycline,
neomycin, spiramycin, cypermethrin and -cypermethrin, and tilmicosin.  MRL's
for cypermethrin, 
-cypermethrin, and tilmicosin in sheep milk were made temporary pending further
information.  A temporary ADI and temporary MRL's were established for
thiamphenicol.  The JECFA could recommend neither an ADI nor MRL's for
xylazine.<br>
<br>
	A working paper on procedures for assessing the effects of antimicrobial
veterinary drug residues in food on the human intestinal microflora was
reviewed.<br>
<br>
	The International Office of Epizootics reported on the progress of the
"International Cooperation on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for
Registration of Veterinary Medicinal Products" (known as VICH).  In the short
term, it was decided to establish five working groups which would consider the
following topics: Guidelines on Quality, Safety, Good Clinical Practice,
Efficacy of Anthelmintics, and Ecotoxicology.<br>
	<br>
	Another important issue discussed was Guidelines on Residues at Injection
Sites.  The intention of the proposed guidelines was to ensure consumer safety,
enhance residue monitoring practices, and to assist in trade facilitation.
There was general support that the calculation of risk from consumption of
residues at the injection site should be based on the principles of acute
reference dose.  The Committee invited JECFA to examine the issues raised in
the paper and in the present discussion.  It also requested that the paper be
revised in light of this advice and be circulated for comments prior to
submission for consideration at its next Session.<br>
<br>
	There was an extensive discussion regarding the methods of analysis and
sampling for residues of veterinary drugs at the Ninth Session held in 1995.
The Committee recalled the decision that if no method of analysis acceptable to
the Committee was available to monitor an MRL, that the MRL should not be
advanced beyond Step 7 to full acceptance by the Committee.  Noting that its
Terms of Reference required the Committee "to determine criteria for analytical
methods used for the control of veterinary drug residues in foods" but did not
extend to the consideration of methods of analysis, the Committee agreed that
all MRL's currently retained at Step 7 should be considered for acceptance by
advancement to Step 8.  <br>
<br>
	The Committee also discussed a paper prepared by the Delegation of Australia
and other delegations on the validation of analytical methods.  Many of the
issues raised in the paper were of potential concern in other areas of the
Commission's work, including pesticide residues, contaminants, and
microbiological analysis.  The Committee proposed that the Commission request
FAO, together with WHO, to give consideration to convening an Expert
Consultation on the question of methods validation for food control
purposes.<br>
<br>
	The delegation of the United States, with assistance from other delegations,
presented a paper on the evaluation of residues of veterinary drugs in milk and
milk products.  The Committee noted that the proposals contained in the
document were directed towards the prevention and monitoring of veterinary drug
residues.  Drug monitoring programs should be undertaken at an early point in
the milk collection system.  Problems such as the dilution of affected milk
from individual cows or herds with other milk could be addressed this way.  It
was proposed that an integrated test system, drawing on the principles of the
Hazard Analysis/Critical Control Point (HACCP) System, would be effective in
combining screening and more investigatory tests at Critical Control Points.<br>
<br>
	The Committee noted the need for more data on the fate of residues during milk
processing, e.g., pasteurization, spray drying, and cheese-making.  The
Committee also suggested the need for further data on the distribution of
residues between different milk components (milk fat, whey, protein) following
the administration of veterinary drugs by different routes (e.g., intramuscular
use compared to intramammary use).<br>
<br>

<A NAME="VMAC">NEW COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR VMAC</A><br>

<br>
<A NAME="MILL">FEED MILL LICENSING NOW A REALITY</A><P>
                              by Dr. W. D. Price, Dr. Malcolm Thomas, and James
Tessmer<br>
<br>
Medicated Feed Applications (MFA's), or 1900's are now a thing of the past.  On
October 9, 1996, the President signed the Animal Drug Availability Act of 1996
(ADAA), which amends Section 512(m) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(the Act) to require a single facility license rather than multiple MFA's for
each feed mill as previously required.  FDA intends to revise its regulations
to clarify that a license will be required for the manufacture of feeds using
Category II, Type A medicated articles, the manufacture of free choice feeds,
and the manufacture of liquid Type B feeds where the formula or specifications
are not published in the 21 CFR 558 regulations.<br>
<br>
	Following are some frequently asked questions concerning licensing:<br>
<br>
	<b>What are the advantages of Feed Mill Licensing?</b><br>
<b></b><br>
	This amendment streamlines the paper work process for the approval to
manufacture medicated feeds.  Now any feed manufacturing facility which
currently holds one or more approved MFA's automatically holds a transitional
license.  The transitional license is valid up to 18 months, and will terminate
unless converted by CVM to a license upon receipt (within the 18-month period)
of a license application accompanied by a copy of an approved MFA.<br>
<br>
	<b>If I have an approved MFA, how do I submit a license application?</b><br>
<b></b><br>
	License applications will be accepted in letter form, and should include the
following:<br>
<br>
<UL><LI>full statement of the business name, address, and FDA registration central
file number (CFN) of the specific manufacturing site;<br>
<br>
<LI>the name and signature of the responsible individuals for that facility;<br>
<br>
<LI>the certification statement that the animal feeds bearing or containing new
animal drugs are manufactured and labeled in accordance with the applicable
regulations published pursuant to 512 (i) of the Act; and<br>
<br>
<LI>the certification statement that the methods used in, and the facilities and
controls used for, manufacturing, processing, packaging, and holding such
animal feeds are in conformity with good manufacturing practice as described in
21 CFR 225.</UL>
<br>
	<b>If I do not have an approved MFA, how do I submit a license
application?</b><br>
<br>
	Register with FDA and submit a license application as outlined above.  <br>
<br>
	<b>What happens when a feed mill license application is filed?</b><br>
<b></b><br>
	It is checked for completeness.  If it is incomplete, it will be returned to
the applicant.  If it is complete, CVM will request a feed mill inspection of
the facility by FDA Field unless the mill is covered under the transitional
provisions of the October 9, 1996 act, in which case a license will issue.
Upon completion of the inspection, a license  will issue if the facility is
found to be in substantial compliance with CGMP requirements.  If the result of
the inspection is classified Official Action Indicated (OAI), the license will
not be approved unless FDA and the applicant agree on an extended review time
(beyond 90 days) so that the applicant has time to correct the deficiencies and
FDA has reinspected.<br>
<br>
	<b>What is required prior to shipment of a Type A Medicated Article for use in
medicated feeds?</b><br>
<b></b><br>
	Prior to shipment of a new animal drug intended for use in the manufacture of
medicated animal feed, the seller must have a written statement from the buyer
that the buyer has a feed mill license and possesses current approved Type B
and/or C feed labeling for the drug, unless FDA has exempted by regulation
manufacturers of animal feed bearing or containing such drug from the
requirement to hold a license.  In the event that the buyer is not the feed
manufacturer, the buyer must provide the seller with a statement that the drug
will be sold only to feed mill license holders.  The source of the labeling is
the approved labeling in the new animal drug application (NADA), and is
available from the Type A article manufacturer or the distributor.<br>
<br>
	<b>How does licensing affect the records and assay requirements?</b><br>
<b></b><br>
<b></b>	Licensees are required to establish and maintain all records and make
such reports as required by regulation or order issued under 512 (m)(5)(A) of
the Act and as now published in 21 CFR 510.301.  They are also required by good
manufacturing practice regulations to establish and maintain a program of
sampling and analysis of at least three representative samples of the medicated
feed collected at periodic intervals during the calendar year.  The program
must provide for sampling and assay of the first batch manufactured.  If a
medicated feed contains a combination of animal drugs, only one of the drugs
need be subject to analysis each time, provided the one tested is different
from the one(s) previously tested.  Reports of assays shall be kept on the
premises for not less than 1 year after the date of manufacture of the
medicated feed.<br>
<br>
	<b>Do licensees still have to register and be inspected?</b><br>
<b></b><br>
<b></b>	Licensees are required to register every year with the FDA.  Licensees
will be subject to biennial inspections, the same as MFA holders, and if
regulatory action is indicated, will be subject to the same regulatory
procedures as MFA holders were.<br>
<br>
	<b>Where do feed mills get approved Type B and C medicated feed labels?</b><br>
<b></b><br>
<b></b>	Type A medicated article manufacturers are required to have Type B and
C Blue Bird labeling (model labeling) approved as part of the New Animal Drug
Application (NADA) approval procedure.  The seller, Type A medicated article
manufacturers or the distributor, is required to furnish Type B and/or C
medicated feed labels to the feed mill prior to shipment of the Type A
medicated article.<br>
<br>
	<b>How will licensing affect the Veterinary Feed Directive?</b><br>
<br>
	CVM is working on regulations to implement the Veterinary Feed Directive drug
provisions of the ADAA.  In accordance with Congress' directive, FDA will not
delay any approvals of veterinary feed directive drugs pending the publication
of implementing regulations.<br>
<br>
	CVM is available to answer questions during the transition to a feed mill
licensing system.  For additional information, please contact the Division of
Animal Feeds, Office of Surveillance and Compliance, Center for Veterinary
Medicine, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville, MD 20855, telephone 301-594-1724.<br>

<A NAME="BIOTECH">UPDATE ON BIOTECH PLANTS</A><P>
                         by Dr. M. Alewynse and Dr. W. D. Price<br>
<br>
On May 29, 1992, the FDA published a Statement of Policy: Foods Derived from
New Plant Varieties in the <i>Federal Register</i>.  This statement laid out
issues that individuals should consider during the development of new plant
varieties which includes those developed using rDNA techniques.  After
publication of the policy, FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition
(CFSAN) and Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) initiated a voluntary
consultation process where the developer of a new plant variety consults with
the Agency about safety and regulatory issues prior to marketing.  In June
1996, these procedures were formalized.  Included in the procedures are the CVM
concerns published in the <i>FDA Veterinarian</i> by Price and Alewynse
(September/October 1995).  Typically, the developer submits summary information
about the safety and nutritional assessment of the plant to FDA.  The Agency
may then conclude the consultation process by issuing a letter to the developer
which indicates that there are no unresolved issues associated with that
variety.  The consultation procedures are described in more detail on CFSAN's
WWW site 	(http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/consulpr.html).  <br>
<br>
	Twenty-five consultations involving eight different crops, including both
human foods, such as tomatoes, and traditional animal feedstuffs, like the
soybean, have been completed.  In 1994, the Agency and plant developers
concluded eight consultations.  During 1995, seven consultations were
concluded; and by November, 1996, another ten had completed the process.  Some
of the consultations involved several different plant lines.  In 1996, the
first multiple trait plant, corn to be marketed for both its insect protection
and herbicide tolerance qualities, completed the consultation process.<br>
<br>
	At the present time, five different consultations have been concluded for
tomatoes which exhibit modified ripening or softening behavior.  Several
potatoes which contain the cryIIIA gene product to confer insect protection
have also been examined.  In addition, virus resistant squash has completed the
process.<br>
<br>
	For crops such as corn and soybeans which have traditionally been used in
animal feed, the primary focus of trait development has been to improve insect
resistance and plant tolerance to herbicide application.  Insect resistance has
been accomplished by plant expression of insecticidal proteins.  At the present
time, genes obtained from <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> have been utilized to
obtain the insecticidal trait.  This characteristic has been incorporated into
both cotton and corn.  In corn, the desired effect, a reduction in European
corn borer infestations, has been the subject of five consultations.  These
insecticidal proteins are classified as pesticides by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) which is responsible for licensing these genetically
modified crops.  However, FDA is still responsible for the wholesomeness of the
plants.<br>
<br>
	Herbicide tolerance is also a trait of interest to plant breeders and has been
the subject of nine consultations.  Many herbicides can not be used on or have
a limited time when they can be applied to crops.  By engineering a gene into
the plant which allows herbicide application without injury or yield reduction,
firms hope to aid farmers in the control of field weeds.  With herbicide
tolerant crops, weeds can be treated anytime they become a problem which allows
more freedom in the timing of herbicide application.  Corn, cotton, canola, and
soybeans have all been modified to be tolerant to different herbicides.  FDA
has the sole responsibility for the safety of these genetically modified crops,
while EPA regulates the use of the herbicide.<br>
<br>
	In addition, several consultations have dealt with modifications to aid
traditional plant breeding, such as male sterility in corn, and hybridization
in oilseed rape.  Plant composition has also been changed using rDNA
techniques.  Canola has been modified to produce oil containing an increased
level of laurate, making its composition similar to coconut oil which is used
in nondairy whipped toppings.<br>
<br>
	The use of antibiotic resistance marker genes in the development of biotech
plants has been a concern.  Plant breeders have indicated in the consultation
process that kanamycin (kanr), &#223; lactam, chloramphenicol, and
aminoglycoside resistance genes have been used in several modified plants
released thus far.  Only the kanr gene produces a product in the plant.
Calgene Inc. filed a Food Additive Petition (FAP) for aminoglycoside 3'
phosphotransferase II (NPT II) encoded by the kanr gene.  This gene product
appears in small quantities in the Flavr Savr&#153; tomato, and cotton, rape
(canola) and potato varieties.  The FAP was approved after a thorough review
which substantiated that NPT II would not raise a safety concern.  It was also
concluded that NPT II would not significantly affect the stability of neomycin
in animal feed.<br>
<br>
	Genes encoding resistance to kanamycin, &#223; lactam, chloramphenicol, and
aminoglycoside antibiotics have been used in the development of other modified
plant varieties, but these genes are not expressed in those plants.  These
genes have bacterial promoters to target expression in bacteria where the total
gene construct to be inserted in the crop is cloned, and are used only as a
gene detection tool.  Convincing arguments have been made by the plant
developers that it is highly unlikely that a functional copy of these genes
would be transferred from the plant to rumen or gut microflora.  However, the
use of antibiotic resistance marker genes continues to be an issue on the
international scene.  <br>
<br>
	CFSAN and CVM in cooperation with USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service have
participated in several international meetings, including those with Japan and
the European Union (EU) in an attempt to harmonize preclearance requirements.
CVM has worked with Canada, Japan, and the EU on guidance for animal feed use
of Novel (biotech) Foods.  Labeling of food and feed derived from new plant
varieties appears to be an issue within the EU.  In the U.S., labeling has only
been suggested for high laurate canola oil because of the compositional
changes.  Feed or food labeling would be required in the U.S. if there is a
safety issue, such as the presence of an allergen or a significantly higher
level of a toxic factor, such as gossypol in cottonseed, or if the product
would be misbranded, due to changes in composition, such as occurred in high
laurate canola.<br>
<br>
	The following table lists plant varieties which have completed the
consultation process as of December 6, 1996.  The table includes the name of
the developer, the crop, the trait, and the source of the genetic material
conferring the trait.  An updated version of the table is maintained at the
CFSAN WWW site (<A HREF="http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/biocon.html">http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/biocon.html</A>).<br>

<a name="APPROVAL">APPROVAL WITHDRAWN</a><br>
<br>
	In the November 18, 1996 <i>Federal Register</i>, FDA published a notice
stating that the Agency is withdrawing approval of a new animal drug
application (NADA 125-226) for tylosin Type A medicated articles to make
tylosin Type C medicated feeds.  This NADA was held by Countrymark Cooperative,
Inc. (formerly Indiana Farm Bureau Cooperative). The sponsor requested the
withdrawal of approval because it no longer makes Type A medicated articles for
use in Type C medicated feeds.<br>
<br>
<a name="PROPOSAL">PROPOSAL TO WITHDRAW APPROVAL</a><br>
<br>
	In the November 20, 1996 <i>Federal Register</i>, FDA published a notice that
the Agency is providing an opportunity for a hearing on a proposal to withdraw
approval of a new animal drug application (NADA) for Protamone-D (iodinated
casein tablets) for dogs, held by Agri-Tech, Inc., because the applicant has
failed to submit required periodic reports.<br>
<br>
<a name="PETITION">FOOD ADDITIVE PETITION FILED</a><br>
<br>
	Milwhite, Inc., has filed a petition proposing that the food additive
regulations be amended to provide for the safe use of hydrated sodium calcium
aluminosilicate as a binder of aflatoxins in feeds and drinking water.
Additional information is included in the November 20, 1996 <i>Federal
Register</i> (page 59101) and from Dr. Henry E. Ekperigin, Center for
Veterinary Medicine (HFV-222), FDA, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville, MD 20855,
(301) 594-1724.<br>
<br>
<a name="RESIDUE">SENTENCING IN DRUG RESIDUE CASE</a><br>
<br>
On October 10, 1996, Eugene Gorr and Jeffrey Lee Gorr of Petersburg, Michigan,
were fined $25,000 each and sentenced to three years probation as a result of
their guilty pleas to conspiracy to introduce adulterated food into interstate
commerce with the intent to defraud and mislead.  During the probation period,
the Gorrs must perform 50 hours of community service per year.  The defendants
were also ordered to comply with the terms of the plea agreement.<br>
<br>
	The Gorrs were livestock dealers, buying, selling, and transporting livestock,
including cattle, obtained from farmers and auction markets, to meat packers
for slaughter for food for human consumption.  The Gorrs had been identified by
the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service as the
source for more than 30 animals containing illegal levels of drugs.  Also, on
three separate occasions, the Gorrs purchased from undercover FDA agents
animals which they were told were medicated, and subsequently sold those
animals for human food.<br>
<br>
	During their sentencing, Judge Nancy Edmonds commented that the Gorr's
practice of selling cattle adulterated with drug residues was not a crime of
negligence, but of overreaching and greed on the part of the defendants.  <br>
<br>
<a name="VEAL">INDICTMENTS IN VEAL DRUG CASES ANNOUNCED</a><br>
<br>
On November 21, 1996, U.S. Attorney, Thomas P. Schneider, Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
announced Federal indictments in the ongoing nationwide investigation into the
smuggling, distribution, and use of illegal drugs in the veal industry.<br>
<br>
	Gerard Hoogendijk of the Netherlands has been indicted as the principal
supplier of these black market drugs.  Hoogendijk is the owner of Pricor, B.V.,
the Dutch animal premix company which owns a majority of Vitek, a firm
previously convicted on twelve counts of conspiracy, smuggling and distribution
of unapproved animal drugs into and throughout the United States.  The new
indictment charges Hoogendijk with nine Federal offenses including conspiracy
to defraud the United States and to smuggle and distribute misbranded and
adulterated animal drugs.  Hoogendijk is also charged with six smuggling
counts.  Both the conspiracy and smuggling charges each carry a prison term of
up to five years, a fine of up to $250,000, or both.  In addition, Hoogendijk
is charged with two counts of introducing the drug clenbuterol into interstate
commerce, an offense which carries a maximum prison term of three years, a fine
of up to $250,000, or both.  Arrangements are continuing with the Dutch
government for the extradition of Hoogendijk, who is a Dutch citizen.<br>
<br>
	Additional indictments were returned against Travis Calf Milk, Inc., and its
President, Gerald R. Travis; and VIV, Inc. (aka Hying America), and its
operators Jan Van Den Hengel and Hennie Van Den Hengel.  They are charged with
conspiracy to smuggle and distribute unapproved, adulterated and misbranded
animal drugs.  Each of the defendants is also charged with five additional
counts of violating food and drug laws prohibiting the distribution or receipt
of unapproved and adulterated animal drugs.  In addition, VIV and the Van Den
Hengels are accused of smuggling various chemicals into the U.S., resulting
from a seizure of animal drugs found concealed in a container destined for
Vitek in February, 1994.<br>
<br>
	The indictments allege that both VIV and Travis Calf Milk, Inc., received over
200,000 and 150,000 pounds, respectively, of Vitek veal feed supplements
containing clenbuterol, zinc bacitracin, and/or avoparcine.  Travis Calf Milk,
a Wisconsin feed company, is accused of using the unapproved drugs in its veal
feed.  VIV, a Pennsylvania veal grower, is accused of using the unapproved
drugs on veal raised in its own facilities.<br>
<br>
	If convicted, the corporate defendants face fines of up to $500,000 on each
count, totaling $3,500,000 for VIV and $3,000, 000 for Travis Calf Milk, Inc.
Jan and Hennie Van Den Hengel face fines of up to $250,000 for each count, up
to five years in prison for each of the smuggling and conspiracy counts, and up
to three years in prison for each of the adulterated drug charges.<br>
<br>
	A plea agreement was reached with Provimi Veal Corp., a Wisconsin corporation
charged with violating food and drug laws prohibiting the distribution of
adulterated and misbranded animal drugs which stem from their involvement in a
1988-89 lamb raising venture.  Information provided alleges that Provimi was a
half-owner of Vitek from 1988 until 1992 and purchased lambs fed with Vitek
products containing clenbuterol.  In early 1992, Provimi sold its interest in
Vitek before the current investigation began.  <br>
<br>
	These charges are the result of over three years of joint investigations
conducted by criminal investigators from U.S. Customs, the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), and the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).  Also
involved are attorneys from the Office of Consumer Litigation in the Department
of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of Wisconsin,
as well as numerous State and local agencies, including the Pennsylvania State
Police.  Investigations are ongoing and additional indictments are expected in
the near future.<p>
<a name="VIOLATE">VAN LEEUWENS VIOLATE CONSENT DECREE</a><br>
<br>
On November 12, 1996 in the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of
California, a Stipulation and Order was signed by the judge and filed finding
defendants Arie, Clara, Arnold, Barry, and Jon Van Leeuwen had violated a
Consent Decree of Permanent Injunction entered by the court on October 4, 1995,
and were, therefore, liable for Civil Contempt.  <br>
<br>
	The Van Leeuwens owned and operated two dairies in Modesto, California.  The
original injunction action against the Van Leeuwen Dairy was based on 16
reports of illegal drug residues in cull dairy cows offered for slaughter
during the period from January 22, 1991 through November 17, 1994.  The illegal
residues included the following drugs:  streptomycin, oxytetracycline,
penicillin, sulfamethazine, tetracycline, sulfathiazole, gentamicin,
erythromycin, and chlortetracycline.  At that time the Consent Decree
permanently restrained and enjoined Arie C. and Clara G. Van Leeuwen from
administering to cattle any article of new animal drug and introducing or
delivering for introduction into interstate commerce any article of food
consisting of cattle or their edible tissues unless and until the defendants
had established and implemented systems to control the use and administration
of drugs to their cattle to avoid illegal drug residues, including an
identification system, a written recordkeeping system, a drug inventory and
accountability system, another system which ensures that each animal had been
held for the proper withdrawal period, and a quarantine or segregation system
for medicated animals.<br>
<br>
	After the Consent Decree was entered, FDA held a meeting with the Van Leeuwens
and their attorney to discuss the requirements of the Consent Decree and
conducted four inspections where the requirements were thoroughly explained to
the owners.  In spite of these efforts, the Van Leeuwens had failed to develop
and implement adequate systems and continued to sell animals for slaughter
contrary to the requirements of the Consent Decree.  The Van Leeuwens failed to
take the injunction seriously and continued to violate the law while making
promises of compliance.<br>
<br>
	Under the Stipulation and Order, the defendants were ordered to comply with
the Injunction at both dairies and to permanently identify all cattle with an
ear tag and provide FDA with a list of ear tag numbers each month.  The
defendants will be fined $100 per day until they have demonstrated compliance
with the injunction, except that fine will be purged if they demonstrate
compliance within 60 days of the Order.  Subsequent violations of the
injunction will result in a sanction of $1,000 for each animal sold in
violation of the injunction and $1,000 for any other violation of the
injunction.  Defendants were also ordered to pay $2,500 for costs incurred by
the Government in monitoring compliance with the injunction to date.<br>
<br>
<a name="REGULATORY">REGULATORY ACTIVITIES</a><br>
<br>
A warning letter was sent to Brabant Farm, Verona, NY, for drug residue
violations.  The firm medicated cows without maintaining medication records and
did not observe adequate withdrawal periods.<br>
<br>
	Russell F. Leone, a livestock dealer from Utica, NY, was sent a warning letter
for drug residue violations.  The firm did not implement adequate procedures to
prevent medicated cows from entering the food supply.<br>
<br>
	A warning letter was sent to Foster Farms, Livingston, CA, for above tolerance
levels of arsenic in poultry, failure to follow withdrawal times, failure to
conduct assays of medicated feeds, and failure to review production records.<br>
<br>
	Roseland Elevator, Blomkest, MN, a firm that produces medicated feed, was sent
a warning letter for not maintaining adequate daily drug records and not
conducting assays of medicated feeds.<br>
<br>
	A warning letter was sent to Lindsay Farms, Masonville, IA, for deviations
from the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations for medicated feed.<br>

Supplement</title></head><body><b>Freedom of Information Summary For 065-010</b><P>
<b>1. General Information:</b><P>
NADA No. 065-010<P>
Sponsor:<p>
 Norbrook Laboratories Limited<br>
Newry<br>
Northern Ireland BT35 6JP<P>
Product Name: AQUA-CILLIN<P>
Generic Name: Sterile Penicillin G Procaine Suspension USP<P>
Marketing Status: Over the Counter (OTC)<P>
Date Stamped:  07/16/92<P>
Effect of Supplement:<p> This supplement provides for the reduction of the milk
withholding period from 72 hours (6 milkings) to 48 hours.<P>
<b>2. Indications for Use:</b><P>
Penicillin G Procaine is an antibacterial agent which is effective against a
variety of pathogenic organisms, chiefly in the gram-positive category. Sterile
Penicillin G Procaine Suspension is recommended for treatment of bacterial
pneumonia (shipping fever) caused by <i>Pasteurella multocida</i> in cattle and
sheep, erysipelas caused by <i>Erysipelothrix insidiosa</i> in swine and
strangles caused by <i>Streptococcus equi</i> in horses.<P>
<b>3. Dosage and Administration:</b><P>
Sterile Penicillin G Procaine Suspension should be administered by the
intramuscular route. The product is ready for injection after warming the vial
to room temperature and shaking to insure a uniform suspension. The recommended
daily dosage of penicillin is 3,000 units per pound of bodyweight (one ml per
100 lbs. bodyweight). Continue daily treatment until recovery is apparent and
for at least one day after symptoms disappear, usually in two to three days.
Treatment should not exceed four consecutive days. No more than 10 mL should be
injected at any one site in adult livestock: rotate injection sites for each
succeeding treatment.<P>
<b>WARNING</b><P>
Exceeding the recommended daily dosage of 3,000 units per pound of bodyweight,
administering at the recommended level for more than four consecutive days
and/or exceeding 10 mL intramuscularly per injection site, may result in
antibiotic residues beyond the withdrawal time. Milk taken from treated dairy
animals within 48 hours after the latest treatment must not be used for food.
Discontinue use of this drug for the following time period before treated
animals are slaughtered for food. Cattle - 10 days; Sheep - 9 days; Swine - 7
days. Not for use in horses intended for food.<P>
<b>4. Target Animal Safety and Effectiveness:</b><P>
The change provided by this supplement does not affect the underlying safety or
effectiveness in the parent application.<P>
<b>5. Human Food Safety:</b><P>
A milk residue depletion study was performed by Norbrook Laboratories Limited
at their research farm in Rostrevor, Co. Down, Northern Ireland. Twenty
lactating Friesian cows weighing from 940 to 1480 pounds (average 1120 pounds)
were given intramuscular injections of 3000 units of penicillin G procaine per
pound of body weight, once daily for four days. During the study the cows were
milked at 6-hour intervals (four times per day).<p>
Average milk production during the study was 15 - 27 kg per cow per day
(overall average of 20 kg/cow/day). Milk samples were stored frozen (at about
-20  C) until assayed.<P>
Milk samples were analyzed for penicillin G residues using the standard
procedure from FDA's "Antibiotic Residues in Milk, Dairy Products, and Animal
Tissues: Methods, Reports, and Protocols" (the "Green Book", revised October
1968), which employs the <i>Sarcina lutea</i> organism. The limit of detection
was 0.0063 units/mL. The mean residues for the samples collected 6, 12, 18, 24,
30, and 36 hours after the last dose are shown below in the table.<P>

 Mean of values for 20 cows unless otherwise noted.<P>
** The samples from 12 of the 20 cows were below the limit of
detection (LOD), and the mean was computed using the LOD (0.0063 units/mL) for
those samples.<P>
*** The samples from 19 of 20 cows were below the
LOD.<P>
<br>
Analysis of the data using the statistical method described in FDAs "General
Principles for Evaluating the Safety of Compounds Used in Food-Producing
Animals" (a 99% statistical tolerance limit and a 95% confidence interval)
showed that the data support a 48-hour milk discard period.<P>
<b>6. Agency Conclusions:</b><P>
Under the agency's supplemental approval policy, <B>21 CFR 514.106</B>(b)(2)(x), this
is a Category II change that did not require a reevaluation of the safety and
effectiveness data in the parent application.<P>
This supplemental application for sterile penicillin G procaine suspension
provides for reduction of the milk withholding period from 72 hours to 48 hours
and this is supported by a milk residue depletion study.<P>
The agency has determined under <B>21 CFR 25.24</B>(d)(1)(i) that this action is of a
type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on
the human environment.  Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an

of Information Summary</b><P>
<b>1. General Information:</b><P>
NADA Number: 039-417<P>
Sponsor: <P>
Rhone-Poulenc, Inc.<br>
500 Northridge Road, Suite 620<br>
Atlanta, Georgia 30350<P>
Generic Name: Decoquinate, Type A Medicated Article.<P>
Trade Name: Deccox&#174<P>
Marketing Status: OTC<P>
Date Stamped:  04/12/91<P>
Effect of Supplement:<P>
This supplement extends to non-ruminating calves the 
claim for the prevention of coccidiosis.<P>
<b>2. Indications for Use:</b><p> For the prevention of coccidiosis 
in non-ruminating and ruminating calves and cattle caused 
by <i>E. bovis</i> and <i>E. zurnii</i>.<P>
<b>3. Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended 
Dosage:</b><P>
a. Dosage Form: Type A Medicated Article.<P>
b. Route of Administration: Oral.<P>
c. Recommended Dosage: Thoroughly mix Deccox&#174  into the 
ration at a rate to provide decoquinate at a daily dose 
of 22.7 mg/100 lb. (0.5 mg/kg) of body weight. Feed for 
at least 28 days during periods of coccidiosis exposure 
or when experience indicates that coccidiosis is likely 
to be a hazard.<P>
<b>4. Effectiveness:</b> The original approval for the use of 
decoquinate in ruminating calves and cattle was published 
at <B>41 FR 53003 12/3/76</B>. Effectiveness data from the 
original approval remain adequate for this class of 
calves. Ruminating cattle were selected as the target 
class of cattle due to the potential compromise of 
efficacy by the biological flora in the rumen, dilution 
of drug by the large volume of feed and water in the 
rumen, and other pharmacodynamic activities of the rumen.<P>
<b>5. Animal Safety:</b> The original approval for the use of 
decoquinate in ruminating calves and cattle was published 
at <B>41 FR 53003 12/3/76</B>. Target animal safety data from 
the original approval remain adequate for this class of 
calves.<P>
<b>6. Human Safety:</b><P>
A. Toxicity Data and Tolerances<P>
The toxicity data in NADA 039-417 support the tolerances 
for residues of decoquinate found in <B>21 CFR 556.170</B>. 
These tolerances are 2 ppm for edible tissues other than 
muscle and 1 ppm for muscle.<P>
B. Total Residue and Metabolism Data<P>
Previous total residue C14 studies submitted under NADA 
039-417 for ruminating cattle medicated with approximately 
5 mg/kg (10x) for 7 days resulted in the following total 
residues:<P>
Fat--1.10 ppm<br>
Liver--0.94 ppm<br>
Kidney--0.36 ppm<br>
Muscle--0.18 ppm<P>
These levels are substantially lower than the established 
tolerances. For that reason, and in light of the limited 
metabolism of decoquinate, the total residues obtained at 
the 10x dose, and an adequate margin of safety weighed 
against the differences in metabolism that may occur in 
non-ruminating animals, additional metabolism studies 
were not required.<P>
C. Residue Depletion Study<P>
Decoquinate residues were determined in 8 non-ruminating 
calves treated with decoquinate (0.5 mg/kg) in milk 
replacer for 28 days. All the tissue samples contained 
levels of decoquinate below 0.5 ppm. The range of values 
for each tissue group is shown below.<P>
Tissue<br>
muscle--0.08 - 0.15 ppm<br>
liver--0.11 - 0.30 ppm<br>
kidney--0.14 - 0.30 ppm<P>
Fat was not analyzed due to insufficient sample being 
available. The results of this residue study establish a 
zero-day withdrawal period for non-ruminating calves 
treated with 0.5 mg decoquinate/kg body weight.<P>
<b>7. Agency Conclusions:</b><P>
The data submitted in support of this supplemental NADA 
satisfy the requirements of section 512 of the Act and 
demonstrate that Deccox&#174  (decoquinate), when used under 
its proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for 
the labeled indications. The supplement provides for 
expanding the claim for the use of decoquinate to non- 
ruminating calves for the prevention of coccidiosis 
caused by <i>E. bovis</i> and <i>E. zurnii</i>.<P>
Decoquinate for use in food-producing animals is an over-the-counter 
product. Accurate diagnosis can be made with 
a reasonable degree of certainty by the layman, and the 
conditions for use prescribed on the labeling are likely 
to be followed in practice. Therefore, the Center for 
Veterinary Medicine has concluded that this product 
should remain under over-the-counter marketing status.<P>
Under FDA's regulation concerning approval of 
supplemental applications (21 <B>CFR 514.106</B>(b)(2)(vi)) this 
is a Category II change because the claim was expanded 
for the use of decoquinate in non-ruminating calves to 
prevent coccidiosis caused by <i>E. bovis</i> and <i>E. zurnii</i>. The 
approval of this supplement neither poses an increased 
human risk from exposure to the drug nor alters the 
condition of the drug's safety in non-ruminating and 
ruminating calves. Thus, a re-evaluation of the data in 
the parent NADA was not required.<P>
The approved decoquinate premix is codified in <B>21 CFR 
558.195</B> as a Type A medicated article for use in broiler 
chickens, cattle, ruminating calves and goats for the 
prevention of coccidiosis. The tolerance is codified in 
section <B>21 CFR 556.170</B> and is established at 2 ppm in 
tissues other than skeletal muscle and 1 ppm in skeletal 
muscle for negligible residues of decoquinate in the 
edible tissues of cattle and goats. Withdrawal before 
slaughter is not required.<P>
Under Section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug 
and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)], this 
supplemental approval does not qualify for exclusivity 
because neither new clinical or field investigations nor 
human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or 
residue studies) were essential to the approval. <br>

compliance with the National Academy of Science/National Research Council-
Drug.  Efficacy Study Implementation (NAS/NRC/DESI) recommendations.The other
supplemental application is a Category II change in tolerance for drug residues
from zero to 0.1 ppm for beef tissues.<p>
<b>Date Stamped:</b>  06/30/93<p>
<b>II.	INDICATIONS FOR USE:</b><p>
<b></b>Indicated for bovine respiratory disease (shipping fever complex and
bacterial pneumonia) associated with <i>Pasteurella multocida</i><b>
</b>susceptible to erythromycin.<p>
<b>III.     DOSAGE FORM, ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION AND RECOMMENDED DOSAGES:</b><p>A.	Sterile solution<br>
B.	Intramuscular injection only<br>
C.	4 mg/pound body weight (2 mL/100lbs) once daily up to 5 days<p>
<b>IV.    EFFECTIVENESS:   </b><p>NADA 012-123 was originally approved as  safe
for use as labeled on March 22,  1960.   The drug was  the  subject  of
National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council/Drug Efficacy Study
Implementation  (NAS/NRC/DESI)  reports which were published in the <b>FEDERAL
REGISTER</b> of August 18,  1970: The Academy evaluated these products as probably
effective in the treatment of certain diseases  in cattle, sheep,  swine,
horses,  dogs,  cats,  chickens,  and turkeys.<br>


The Academy stated:<p>

a.	Each disease claim should be properly qualified "appropriate for use
(name of disease)  caused by pathogens sensitive to  (name of drug)",  and if
the disease  claim cannot  be  so  qualified the claim must be dropped.<p>

b.	Claims made regarding "for prevention of" or "to prevent" should be
replaced with "as an aid in the control of" or "to aid in the control of."<p>

c.	The  dosage  in  large  animals  and  frequency  of administration  in
all  species  need  to  be documented - the dosage should be expressed on the
basis  of  milligrams  of  erythromycin  per pound of body weight.<p>

d.	The resistance statement and statements claiming more effectiveness than
other microbial agents need to be deleted.<p>

e.	Certain  items  in  the  labeling  need  revision, including withdrawal
times, cautions, misleading association of sensitivity statement and certain
diseases and the recommended use as an aid in curtailing weight  losses  due
to  handling  and transporting cattle.<p>

f.	Directions   for   use   should provide for administering  the
preparation with  sterile equipment.<p>

g.	Directions for lay use are inadequate.<p>
</ul>The Food and Drug Administration concurs with the Academy's findings;
interpreting the phrase "...cannot be so qualified ..." in paragraph  (a.)
to mean  "...is  not  supported by adequate  data..." FDA  then
proceeded  to  review  all available data  relating to the effectiveness  of
products subject to NADA 012-123 to determine which label claims were
supported by the  requisite proof of effectiveness. That review resulted
in  a  letter  dated  January  21, 1976, addressed to the firm ,  in which the
agency stated that it had  concluded  that  data  supported  effectiveness  for
the/ treatment of bovine respiratory disease only.<p>
Thereafter,  the  sponsor  complied  with  the  evaluation  of NAS/NRC and the
FDA's conclusions in the following manner:<p>


1.	The disease claim has been qualified as to the causative pathogen which
is susceptible  to  erythromycin.    All other disease claims and several
animal species have been deleted from the indications for use.<p>

2.	The labeled indications have been revised to  read,  "For  the
treatment  of  bovine respiratory   disease   (shipping   fever complex  and
bacterial   pneumonia)..." instead of  "Is indicated for prompt  and effective
treatment   of conditions resulting  from  infections caused  by organisms..."<p>


3.	The dosage and frequency of administration in cattle has been
documented.  On January 21,   1976,   the  Center  for VeterinaryMedicine
determined the efficacy portion of  the  application  to  be  complete  by
virtue  of  the  fact  that  bioavailability and   comparability   data
submitted adequately  demonstrated  that  sufficient drug levels were
maintained at a dosage of 4  mg per pound body weight  administered daily for
up to 5 days.<p>

4.	The  labeling has  been  revised to delete the  resistance  statement
and  statements claiming more effectiveness.<p>

5.	The labeling has been revised to include appropriate withdrawal times
and cautions, and to delete the other items mentioned above.<p>

6.	The directions  for use have been revised to include the precautions to
administer the preparation with sterile equipment.<p>

7.	Adequate  directions  for  lay  use for administering this drug by
theintramuscular route are included.<p>
<b>V.	ANIMAL SAFETY</b>;<p>
<b>NADA </b> 012-123 was originally approved as  safe on March 22, 1960.
Safety of this product is also substantiated by the absence of any adverse
effects reported in three new studies:  a bioequivalency study,  and the
treatment periods of a milk residue  study and a tissue residue study.<p>
During these three studies,  24 animals were given two separate
injections   14  days  apart,   five  animals  were  given  three consecutive
daily  injections  and  18  animals  were  given  five consecutive  daily
injections.     The  injections  were  given intramuscularly in the  leg  or neck at  
a dose  of  4  mg/lb.  body weight. Transient reactions such as injection site 
swelling were observed  over  a  few days  following  these  injections,  but  
no evidence  of  hemorrhage, fibrosis,  or  necrosis  was  externally observable.<p>
Gross  histopathological  examination was made  of  tissues  at  and
surrounding the injection site following intramuscular injections to 18  cattle
of 6.5 ml to  8.8 mL/site of GALLIMYCIN INJECTION. These animals were each
given a single daily injection for five days.   Three animals per time period
were then sacrificed at  6, 12,  18,  24,  36,  and  48  hours  post-last  dose
(injection  #5). Injection site #3 was excised for examination.   Gross
inspection revealed that injection site lesions were variable in size with
approximate average dimensions of 1.25 cm diameter X 2.9 cm deep. Injection
site  lesions were  characterized by  a  central  core  of muscle  tissue,
tan-gray  to  gray  in  color  and  surrounding this central area of
discoloration was a dark red zone of more normalappearing   muscle   with
obvious   areas    of   hemorrhage.<p>
Histopathological examination revealed a central core of acutely necrotic
muscle fibers.   Surrounding this central core was a zone of muscle fibers in
various stages of degeneration characterized by mineralization  of  the
sarcoplasm.    Livers  and  kidneys  were examined  grossly  and
histopathologically  with  no  unusual  or unexpected observations reported.<p>
Results  of  these  studies  indicate  that  a  cautionary  label statement
concerning the trimming of cattle tissues during the dressing process is
necessary based on the withdrawal period for the product.<p>

<br>		Las Cruces, New Mexico  88001
<br>		Dr. John H. Kinzell<p>
B.	Tissue Residue Depletion Studies:<p>
	A  single  tissue  residue depletion  study was  conducted in cattle to determine the residues of erythromycin following the  administration  of  GALLIMYCIN  INJECTION.    The  dosage regimen was:   intramuscular injection at 4 mg/lb.  of body weight for five consecutive days.   Residue determinations were made at 6,  12,  18,  24,  36 and 48 hours post last-dose.  Three  animals  were  sacrificed  at  each  time  period  and tissues were excised for erythromycin assay.

*standard
deviation<p>
Residues at  the  injection  site depleted slowly.    However, using  a
conservative  30-hour  half-life,  residue  at  the injection  site  will
deplete  to  a  consumption  adjusted tolerance of 1.0 ppm within 6 days.
Muscle remote from the injection  site  was  less  than  0.075  ppm at  48
hours.    A withdrawal period was calculated by a statistical procedure based
on the kidney depletion data from this study.   Using the  99%  statistical
tolerance  limit  with  95%  confidence procedure on the residue depletion data
for erythromycin in edible tissues,  it was determined that   a 6-day
withdrawal period for cattle treated with up to  4 mg per pound body weight
would be acceptable (less than 0.1 ppm erythromycin).<p>
Temporary  tissue  irritation  follows  injection.  To  avoid excessive trim,
cattle should not be slaughtered within 21 days of last injection.<p>
<b>Regulatory Method for Tissue Residues:</b><p>
The regulatory analytical method for detection of residues of erythromycin is a
microbiological test using <i>Micrococcus luteus</i> suspension.   This
method has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and was fully
validated by the research  laboratory.    The method is  capable  of measuring
residues of erythromycin at the tolerance level of 0.1 part per million for
edible tissues.  The supplemental application providing for the revision of the
tolerance from "zero" to 0.1 ppm reflects the change in FDA policy regarding
the concept of residue tolerance.   No new toxicity data were used to revise
the tolerance because 0.1  part  per million  is  equivalent  to the  tolerance
level that  would  have  been  established  when  the  drug  was originally
approved  (March  22,  1960).    Furthermore,  this tolerance is consistent
with data supporting the published tolerance of 0.1 ppm in uncooked edible
tissues of swine.<p>
Under the-zero tolerance concept,  no detectable residues of a  new  animal
drug were  permissible  in  edible  tissues  of treated  food  animals  when
tissues  were  assayed  using available  analytical  methods.     However,   as
analytical technologies  advanced,  methodologies  became  increasingly
sensitive  and  capable  of  measuring progressively  smaller amounts of drug
residues in tissues. Thus,  residues which were  not  detectable  using
older,  less  sensitive  methods (i.e., zero residues)  began  to  be  found
using  the  more advanced  analytical  methods.    Therefore,  FDA  adopted the
concept  of  maximum  negligible,  or  permissible,  residues which reflect the
lower level of quantitative sensitivity of the   official   regulatory
analytical   method. For erythromycin,  this level is 0.1 part per
million.<p>
The validated regulatory analytical method for detection of erythromycin
residues  is  filed  in  the  Food  Additives Analytical     Manual  on
display  in  FDA's  Freedom  of Information Public Room  (Room 12A-30), 5600
Fishers  Lane, Rockville, MD  20857.<p>
VII.   <b>AGENCY</b> <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
The DESI finalization supplemental NADA satisfies the requirement of  section
512  of  the  Act  and  dem'onstrates  that  GALLIMYCIN INJECTION,  200 mg/mL,
when used in accordance with its proposed conditions  of  use,  is  safe  and
effective  for  the  labeled indications.     The  approval  provides  for  use
of  GALLIMYCIN INJECTION,  200  mg/mL  for  the  treatment  of  bovine
respiratory disease   (shipping  fever  complex  and  bacterial  pneumonia)
associated with <i>Pasteurella multocida</i><b> </b>susceptible to
erythromycin.<p>
The	"probably  effective"  finding of  the NAS/NRC/DESI  regarding Erythromycin
which  was  published  in  the  <B>FEDERAL  REGISTER</B>  of Auguest 18,  1970 was
subsequently reviewed by FDA,  resulting in a January 21,  1976 letter to
Sanofi.    NADA 012-123 was upgraded to "effective" status with respect to the
claim noted in the previous paragraph.   The firm submitted revised labeling to
conform to the letter and,  therefore,  this  supplemental NADA complies with
the NAS/NRC/DESI evaluation and FDA's conclusions.<p>
GALLIMYCIN INJECTION,  200mg/mL for use in food-producing animals is currently
on the market as an over-the-counter product.   When the NADA was reviewed
under NAS/NRC/DESI program,  it was an over the-counter product and this
marketing status remains unchanged. Therefore,  the Center for Veterinary
Medicine has concluded that this product should retain over-the-counter
marketing status.<p>
Additionally,  the supplemental application providing for revision of the
tolerance from "zero" to 0.1 ppm for cattle is acceptable and is approved.<p>
Under  the  Center's   supplemental  approval  policy   (21   CFR 514.106(b)
(2)  these  are Category  II  changes.    The  approval  of these changes are
not expected to have any adverse effect on the  safety of this new animal drug
and,  therefore,  did not require a re-evaluation of the human food or target
animal safety data in the parent application. <p>
<b></b>Under the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988,
these  approvals  do not  qualify  for an exclusivity period under section
512(c)(2)(F)(iii)  of the Federal,  Food,  Drug,  and Cosmetic   Act   (21
U.S.C.360b(c) (2) (F) (iii))   because   the supplemental applications do not
contain reports of new clinical or  field  investigations  (other  than
bioequivalence  or  residue studies)  and in the case of  food producing
animals,  human food safety  studies  (other  than bioequivalence  or  residue
studies) essential  to  the  approvals  and  conducted  or  sponsored by  the
applicant.<br>

Ford Dodge, IA 50501-0518<P>
Generic Name: Kanamycin, pectin, bismuth subcarbonate, 
activated attapulgite (aluminum magnesium 
silicate)<P>
Trade Name: Amforol&#174  Veterinary Oral Tablets<P>
Marketing Status: Rx<P>
Effect of Supplement:<P>
This supplement provides for a revised 
formulation for Amforol&#174  Veterinary Oral 
Tablets without aminopentamide hydrogen 
sulfate. The following issues are addressed:<P>
A. Dose of aminopentamide in original 
formulation<P>
B. Rationale for removing aminopentamide<P>
C. Safety and efficacy of new formulation<P>
<b>II. DOSE OF AMINOPENTAMIDE IN ORIGINAL FORMULATION</b><P>
Aminopentamide is an antispasmodic and anticholinergic 
agent which reduces peristalsis thereby reducing 
propulsive activity. The amount of aminopentamide in 
Amforol's original formulation was 0.033 mg per tablet, 
only 1/6 to 1/12 of the dose recommended when 
aminopentamide alone is given orally to the dog.<P>
<b>III. RATIONALE FOR REMOVING AMINOPENTAMIDE</b><P>
In recent years, clinicians have modified their 
recommendations for the treatment of acute non-specific 
diarrhea. Published literature now suggests that the use 
of antispasmodics / anticholinergics is not indicated in 
the routine treatment of small animals with diarrhea. 
They may produce intractable diarrhea due to ileus.<P>
In cases of spasmodic diarrhea, 
antispasmodics / anticholinergics may result in a 
therapeutic benefit. However, the use of anticholinergics 
should be restricted to documented cases of spasmodic 
diarrhea since their routine use in other types of 
diarrhea may impair normal motility.<P>
The following references suggest that anticholinergic 
drugs like aminopentamide may be contraindicated in the 
routine management of diarrhea.<P>

<b>IV. EFFICACY OF NEW FORMULATION</b><P>
The removal of aminopentamide hydrogen sulfate which was 
present at subtherapeutic levels will not have an adverse 
effect on the product's efficacy. The new formulation 
provides:<P>
<li>Kanamycin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic<br>
<li>Pectin<br>
<li>Attapulgite (aluminum magnesium silicate), an activated 
clay mineral <br>
<li>Bismuth subcarbonate<P>

reformulated product:<P>

<b>V. SAFETY OF NEW FORMULATION</b><P>
Kanamycin sulfate<P>
Orally administered kanamycin sulfate is generally 
considered to be poorly absorbed systemically through 
intact intestinal mucosa, although the possibility of 
increased absorption through ulcerated or denuded areas 
should be considered especially when the dose is 
increased.<P>
Dogs, particularly those weighing less than 5 pounds, 
should be observed for systemic nephrotoxic and ototoxic 
side effects due to systemic absorption of kanamycin 
sulfate from ulcerated areas following oral 
administration. Since orally administered kanamycin 
sulfate is not expected to reach therapeutic levels, 
Amforol should not be prescribed for treating Salmonella 
septicemia. A "Contraindication" appears on the labeling 
as follows:<P>
"Amforol is contraindicated in treatment of Salmonella 
septicemias."<P>
Bismuth subcarbonate<P>
Orally administered bismuth subcarbonate is an insoluble 
salt and generally not absorbed in significant amounts. 
There is documentation of systemic absorption from an 
ulcerated gastrointestinal tract.<P>
Systemically available bismuth has been associated with 
hepatopathy, nephropathy and neurotoxicity in humans. The 
neurotoxic syndrome has been characterized by lack of 
energy, muscle twitching, confusion, convulsions and 
coma.<P>
Winship, K. A."Toxicity of Bismuth Salts" Adv. Drug 
React. Ac. <i>Pois. Rev</i>. 2 1983 103-121.<P>
Hoffman, R. S. et al "Bismuth Absorption and Myotonic 
Encephalopathies After Bismuth Subsalicylate Therapy" <i>Vet</i> 
<i>Hum Toxicol</i> 31 (4) Aug. 1989.<P>
An adverse reaction reported central nervous system 
disfunction in two dogs after use of Amforol Suspension 
at the recommended dose.<P>
The "Side Effects" section of the labeling includes:<P>
"The bismuth subcarbonate in Amforol (Veterinary Oral 
Tablets) may produce darkening of the tongue and stools 
which can be confused with melena. Prolonged exposure to 
orally administered bismuth salts has been associated 
with encephalopathies in other species. Signs may include 
lack of energy, muscle twitching, confusion, convulsions 
and comas."<P>
Activated attapulgite (aluminum magnesium silicate) and 
pectin when orally administered have not been reported to 
produce toxicity.<P>
See the original FOI for additional information.<P>
<b>VI. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><P>
Removal of aminopentamide increases the safety of 
Amforol. The reformulation is supported by substantial 
evidence of safety and effectiveness as found in the 
veterinary and human medical literature. The 
effectiveness of the reformulated product is also based 
on data in the original approval human monographs for 
antidiarrheal products and NAS/NRC reviews.<P>
The data meet the requirements of Section 512 of the Act 
and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations. The 
data demonstrate that the product when used according to 
the approved labeling is safe and effective for the 
treatment of bacterial enteritis caused by susceptible 
strains of <i>E. coli</i>, <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Shigella</i>,
<i>Alcaligenes</i> 
<i>faecalis</i>, <i>Proteus</i> spp. and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>.<P>
This product must be dispensed under a prescription 
because the expertise of a veterinarian is necessary for 
the diagnosis of etiologies causing enteritis. A 
veterinarian's expertise is also needed to monitor 
response to treatment and to detect and treat adverse 
reactions if they occur.<P>
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii), 
this change in the drug product does not qualify for 
exclusivity because new clinical or field investigations 
were not required for approval.

September 25, 1996
<P>

<h3>CVM ANNOUNCES TOLL-FREE NUMBER FOR REPORTING ADES</h3>

FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has a new toll-free telephone 
number to report suspected adverse drug experiences.  The new number is 
1-888-FDA-VETS.  Calls will be forwarded to a veterinarian in CVM's 
Division of Surveillance.  The number is also equipped with voice-mail to 
record messages received outside of normal working hours. 
<P>
CVM monitors reports of adverse drug experiences (ADE) for animal drug 
products, medicated feeds, and veterinary devices.  The definition of an 
ADE is any side effect, injury, toxicity, or sensitivity reaction (or 
failure to perform as expected) associated with use of an animal drug, 
whether or not determined to be attributable to the drug.  Lack of 
effectiveness is also considered an adverse effect. 
<P>
During 1995, CVM received more than 3,000 reports.  Every report is 
evaluated by a veterinarian and entered into a computer database.  In cases 
where public or animal health is judged to be at risk, the initial review 
leads to follow-up activity.  The final result can be a product recall; 
change in product labeling; or, in rare circumstances, removal of a product 
from the market.<P>

<B>FREEDOM OF INFORMATION SUMMARY<p></B>

<B>I. General Information:</B><p>

<B>NADA No.: 132-337</B><p>

Sponsor:</B> <p>
Miles, Inc. <br>
Agriculture Division  <br>
Animal Health Products  <br>
P. O. Box 390  <br>
Shawnee Mission, Kansas 66201<P>

Generic Name: Cythioate<p>

Trade Name: Proban &#174;  90 mg tablets<p>

Marketing Status: Rx<p>

Effect of Supplement:<p> This supplement amends the NADA to provide for a
90 mg tablet and minor labeling changes. The currently approved tablet
is 30 mg.<p>

Date of Summary: 4/25/94<p>

<B>II. Indications for Use:</B><p>

The indications for use remain the same as currently approved.
Proban &#174;  tablets are indicated for the control of fleas on infested
dogs.<p>

<B>III. Dosage Forms, Route(s) of Administration and Recommended
Dosage(s).</B><p>

The 90 mg tablet is administered orally to dogs of all ages according
to the approved dosage of 30 mg cythioate per 20 pounds of body weight
every third day or twice a week.<p>

<B>IV & V. Safety & Effectiveness:</B><p>

The approval of the 90 mg tablet did not require safety and
effectiveness data, as the dosage remains the same.<p>

The supplement provides for minor revisions to the labeling for the
product, as follows:<p>

1. The veterinary prescription legend has been moved from the back
panel to the front panel of the package insert.<p>

2. The "Indications" section has been revised to read, as follows:<p>

"INDICATIONS: PROBAN (cythioate) is indicated for the control of fleas
on infested dogs. It may be used to treat dogs of all ages (see
contraindications)."<p>

3. The replacement of the "Duration of Treatment" section with an
"Efficacy" section to read, as follows:<p>

<B>EFFICACY:</B> Well controlled laboratory tests have demonstrated the
effectiveness of PROBAN in killing fleas on the dog, when administered
according to the recommended treatment schedule for one week. When used 
on a regular basis, PROBAN also kills fleas that infest the dog between 
treatments. Clinical field trials confirmed these results.<p>

<B>Note:</B> As with all flea control products for dogs, treatment with
Proban &#174;  must be used with a control program aimed at reducing flea
populations and flea breeding areas in the dog's environment (bedding,
carpets, yard, etc. - see Precautions)."<p>

4. An addition to the "Precautions" section relating to a controlled
safety study where no adverse reactions were observed in dogs which
received three times the labeled dosage for a one year duration.<p>

5. The addition of the FDA approval statement.<p>

<B>VI. Human Safety</B><p>

A. Human Food Safety<p>

Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in
food, were not required for approval of this NADA. The formulation is
labeled for use in dogs only.<p>

B. Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration<p>

The labeling contains adequate directions for use and thus poses no
human safety hazard. The labeling contains adequate "WARNING" and
"CAUTION" statements.<p>

<B>VII. Agency Conclusions</B><p>

Under the Center's supplemental approval policy <B>21 CFR 514.106 (b)(2)</B>,
this is a Category II change because it provides for a new tablet
size. The approval of this supplemental new animal drug application
had no adverse effect on the safety and effectiveness of this new
animal drug. Accordingly, this approval did not require a
re-evaluation of the safety and effectiveness data in the parent
application.<p>

Under Section 512 (c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Generic Animal Drug and Patent
Term Restoration Act of 1988, this supplemental new animal drug
application does not qualify for marketing exclusivity. The additional
studies submitted with the supplement were conducted as requested by
FDA to correct deficiencies in the original data supporting safety and
efficacy of the 1968 approval, and were not essential to the approval
of this supplement.<p>

The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(d)(1)(iii) that this
action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a
significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an
environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is
required.<p>

The expertise of a trained professional is required for a definitive
diagnosis, to monitor the results of treatment, and determine the
occurrence of adverse effects; therefore, the drug is a prescription
product.<p>

<B>VIII. LABELING</B><p>

1. Bottle insert, 90 mg tablets<br>

2. Dispensing envelopes, 90 mg tablets<br>

3. Unit label, 90 mg tablets<br>

4. Foil strip, 90 mg tablets<br>

5. Shipper stencil, 50 tablet bottles<br>

6. Shipper stencil, foil strip tablets, 500 tablet count<br>

<h3><a name="RTFToC1">Game
Birds Take Another Shot at the Drug Approval Game
</a></h3>
                                           by Meg Oeller, D.V.M. and Steven D.
Vaughn, D.V.M.<P>
The game bird industry in this country includes the raising of pheasants,
quail, partridges, ducks, and wild turkeys.  These birds are raised for sale to
restaurants, direct to consumers, or for release into hunting areas.  The North
American Game Bird Association (NAGA) conservatively estimates that 5 to 10
million pheasants, 5 to 12 million Bobwhite quail, 15 to 25 million Coturnix
(Japanese) quail, 2 to 4 million Chukar partridges, 100 to 300 thousand
Hungarian partridges, 500 thousand to 1 million Mallard ducks, and 100 to 200
thousand wild turkeys are hatched and raised in the U.S. each year.<P>
    These birds face all of the challenges faced by other animals raised in
groups.  They are subject to infectious diseases, parasitism, and production
pressures which often necessitate the use of animal drugs.  As minor species,
they also face the problem that few animal drugs have undergone testing and
review to gain FDA approval for them.  A minor species is any other than
horses, cattle (except veal), swine, dogs, cats, chickens, and turkeys.<P>
    In most cases, it is not economically worthwhile for a pharmaceutical company
to pursue a minor use approval.  The income from the sale of an animal drug for
minor species use is limited to such an extent that it rarely can offset the
cost of development, production and marketing.  In many respects, minor
species/minor use drugs are similar to "orphan drugs" in human medicine.
Unfortunately, at the present time, unlike orphan drugs for human use, there is
no statute that provides economic incentives for pharmaceutical sponsors to
pursue animal drug approvals for minor species.  This is an area worthy of
further exploration. <P>
    The limited number of drugs approved for use in minor species places producers
such as the game bird growers in a predicament.  The producers are prohibited
by law from treating their own animals with drugs that are not specifically
approved for such a use.   Under a policy of regulatory discretion,
veterinarians are permitted to use animal drugs in an extra-label manner,
including for minor species.  The FDA policy on the extra-label use of animal
drugs in food-producing animals defines the limits of regulatory discretion to
exclude the production of a medicated feed containing an animal drug that was
not specifically approved for that use.  <P>
    Recently, the passage of the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act
(AMDUCA) essentially legalized FDA's regulatory discretion policy. AMDUCA
created a legal means for minor species producers to gain access to drugs for
use in their animals through a veterinarian.  However, the provisions of the
act did not completely address the needs of the minor species producers.
Despite the value of using the services of a veterinarian, the economic value
of  many minor species animals is such that the producers cannot always justify
the extra expense to treat their animals.  Further, the husbandry practices for
many minor species, including game birds, makes medication in the feed the most
practical way to achieve appropriate dosing.  For example, catching birds for
multiple injections or oral dosing of medication is labor intensive and
dangerously stressful for the birds.  Game birds raised in large outdoor pens
will preferentially drink rain water over medicated water making this method of
drug administration unreliable.<P>
    The North American Game Bird Association is taking the initiative on behalf of
its members to address this dilemma.  The game bird producers want to work
within the law, and protect the safety of their customers who consume game
birds.  They also want drugs available for use in their animals to be safe and
effective.  They recognize that the best solution is to get drugs approved
specifically for their birds.  Toward this end, the organization has followed
the model of the aquaculture industry and established a committee to identify
and prioritize the drug needs of the industry.  Their president met with CVM's
Center Director, USDA representatives, and the National Research Support
Project #7 (NRSP-7) minor species program liaison to develop a long-term
plan.<P>
    The NAGA has identified 14 animal drugs, already approved in other species,
that are needed for the production of game birds.  These include coccidiostats,
antimicrobials, anthelmintics, and growth promotants.  First priority projects
will be for therapeutic needs.<p>

    NRSP-7 assists groups such as the NAGA by providing administrative assistance
and funding for studies to support minor use approvals.  These studies are
reviewed by CVM and subsequently published in a Public Master File (PMF).  The
studies are intended to support the drug's efficacy, safety to the treated
animal, safety in human food, and safety to the environment.  This data may
then be referenced by a pharmaceutical company to support expansion of their
label to include the minor use indication.  The pharmaceutical companies
provide the necessary manufacturing information, and in many cases, other
support to complete the New Animal Drug Application.  The following drugs have
already been approved for use in game birds.<p>

<p>
    NRSP-7 has been instrumental in the approvals of 2 of the 5 drugs approved for
use in pheasants, 3 of the 5 drugs approved for use in quail, and for the only
drug approved for use in partridges.  There are also 4 drugs currently approved
for use in ducks.  One of the products on the NAGA's list is already an NRSP-7
project which is complete and ready for publication.  Two others are already
projects with studies in progress.  The other proposals are being examined for
feasibility and potential sponsor support.<P>
    FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine will continue to meet with NAGA and
NRSP-7 representatives to discuss the data requirements that would be necessary
to develop the drugs on the prioritized list.  Working together, product
development plans are being constructed.  CVM will also assist NAGA and NRSP-7
by advising and offering suggestions in the design of the necessary studies.<P>
    The cooperative efforts of NAGA, NRSP-7, the FDA Center for Veterinary
Medicine, and pharmaceutical companies should lead to the eventual approval of
the necessary drugs for use in game birds.  Achievement of this common goal
will answer the needs of the regulated industry while protecting the public
welfare without placing an undue financial burden on the pharmaceutical
companies.  That is good news for everyone.<P>
    Minor species issues will be discussed in detail at the 8th Bi-annual NRSP-7
Workshop to be held September 12 and 13, 1996, at the Holiday Inn in Bethesda,
MD.  The workshop is open to the public and is enhanced by the diversity of
attendees.  Interested readers are invited to participate in the Workshop.<P>

<a name="RTFToC2">FDA
AND UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND FORM JOINT INSTITUTE
</a></h3>

by Karen A. Kandra<P>
On April 15, 1996, FDA signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the
University of Maryland to create a unique partnership designed to increase the
quality of research and public health policy, and to promote more efficient use
of research resources.  Named the "Joint Institute for Food Safety and Applied
Nutrition" (JIFSAN), this partnership will be jointly administered, and
function as a multi-disciplinary research program.<P>
FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. and University of Maryland President,
Dr. William E. Kirwan signed the MOU in the presence of many dignitaries,
including: HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala, Congressman Steny H. Hoyer, Senator
Paul S. Sarbanes, Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, and Governor Parris N.
Glendening.<P>
The FDA is the leading Federal regulatory agency responsible for promoting and
protecting public health,  continually striving to keep its scientists abreast
of the latest scientific developments, and often relying on consultation with
other academic organizations.  The University of Maryland is the Washington
area's most comprehensive research institution, serving as the primary center
for graduate study and research, and providing undergraduate instruction across
a broad spectrum of academic disciplines.  The MOU allows the pooling of the
two organization's internationally recognized scientific expertise, equipment,
and facilities. <P>
 It is expected that the collaborative research conducted by the Center and the
University's scientists in the Joint Institute will include studies on risk
assessment, nutritional analyses, and other scientific investigations
contributing to the four major elements of FDA's food program:<P>

<ul>
<li>Food security related to pathogens, contaminants, and toxins;

<li>Regulatory science applied to the review of food ingredients,
international      standards, and educational research;

<li>Nutrition and clinical studies related to nutrient quality, safety and
labeling;

<li>Evaluation of technological innovations in the food industry and
consumer       behavior.</ul><P>
In addition, FDA and University scientists will participate in seminars,
workshops, and other scientific forums to expand their expertise.  Similarly,
graduate and undergraduate students will have access to specialized training,
internships and independent research.  <P>
FDA's participation in the Joint Institute is enhanced by the recent decision
of the General Services Administration to build a new facility for both the
Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition and the Center for Veterinary
Medicine in the College Park area, where construction is expected to be
completed by the year 2000. <P>
This cooperative relationship will benefit both organizations substantially by
the interchange of expertise, which will ultimately strengthen the scientific
and professional base of both FDA and the University of Maryland.  There will
be opportunities to network with other nearby health agencies and share
specialized equipment.  CVM's new state-of-the-art large animal research
facility in Beltsville is nearing completion, with occupancy expected in early
FY 97.  The USDA's Animal Research Center is also a short distance from College
Park.   In this environment of shrinking resources, this joint endeavor will
promote growth which may otherwise be impossible.  The Joint Institute plans
future partnerships with industry as well as other State and Federal Government
agencies.<P>

<P>
    In the May 15, 1996 <i>Federal Register</i>, FDA published a final rule to
reflect that two new animal drug applications (NADA's) held by Schering-Plough
Animal Health were being combined into one, one NADA was being withdrawn, a
supplemental NADA was being approved, and a tolerance for residues of
gentamicin in chickens was being added.<P>
    The firm requested that NADA 47-486 for Garasol &#174; Injection (5
mg. gentamicin per ml) for turkeys be included in NADA 101-862 Garasol
&#174;.  The NADAs are combined as NADA 101-862.  NADA 47-486 is
withdrawn.  <P>
    Schering-Plough also filed a supplemental NADA (101-862) providing for the use
of 50 and 100 mg/ml gentamicin sulfate injection for turkeys at the same dosage
and for the same indications as currently approved.  In addition, Title 21,
Part 566.300 of the <i>Code of Federal Regulations</i>,  is amended to provide
for tolerances for gentamicin residues in chickens as well as turkeys.<P>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC4">UPDATE
ON BSE
</a></h3>
<P>
In the <i>Federal Register</i> of August 29, 1994, FDA issued a proposed rule
declaring that specified offal from adult (more than 12 months of age) sheep
and goats is not generally recognized as safe for use in ruminant feed and is
an unapproved food additive when added to ruminant feed.  FDA proposed this
action because the specified offal may contain the agent that causes scrapie, a
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) of sheep and goats. <P>
Since the proposal was issued, the Agency has been evaluating the comments
submitted on the proposal, monitoring the scientific advances made in
understanding the interrelationships among animal TSE's, and participating in a
number of national and international task force/symposia to better understand
the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic in the United Kingdom
(U.K.)   BSE has been diagnosed in over 160,000 head of cattle in the U.K.
Epidemiological evidence gathered in the U.K. suggests a link between an
outbreak of BSE and feeding animals protein derived from ruminants.  <P>
In recent months, ten cases of a variant form of Creutzfeldt-

Jakob
disease (v-

CJD),
a spongiform encephalopathy in humans with a new clinical and neuropathological
profile, have been identified in the U.K.  The appearance of 10 cases of v-

CJD
raises a possibility of a link to BSE.  However, a link with BSE cannot be
confirmed on the basis of this evidence alone.  <P>
  
No cases of BSE have been diagnosed in the U.S.  Despite the fact that there is
no problem with BSE in the U.S., the Agency believes it would be prudent to
take action to ensure that  BSE will not become a problem.  In the May 14, 1996
<i>Federal Register</i>, FDA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(ANPRM) soliciting comments on the issue of using  protein derived from
ruminants (for example, cattle, sheep, and goats) in ruminant feed.   FDA is
interested in receiving information and comments to use in assessing  whether
these proteins are safe for use as a ruminant feed.  Additional information
about the notice can be obtained in the <i>Federal Register</i> or by
contacting Dr. George Graber, Center for Veterinary Medicine, HFV-

220,
Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville, MD 20855.<P>
In addition to the ANPRM, on May 9, 1996, FDA issued a letter to manufacturers
of FDA-regulated products for animals signed by Dr. Michael A. Friedman, Deputy
Commissioner for Operations to reiterate the Agency's concerns previously
expressed regarding BSE.  The letter strongly recommended that firms
manufacturing FDA-regulated products take whatever steps are necessary to
assure themselves and the public that they are not using ingredients from
cattle born, raised, or slaughtered in countries where BSE exists.  The list of
countries where BSE is know to exist is maintained by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.  As of May 1996, those countries are as follows: <P>

<ul>
<li>    Great Britain (including Northern Ireland and the Falklands)
<li>    Switzerland
<li>    France
<li>    Republic of Ireland
<li>    Oman
<li>    Portugal</ul><P>
    In another effort to deal with the issue of BSE and other transmissible
spongiform encephalopathies, USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS) and FDA's CVM co-hosted a symposium titled "Tissue Distribution,
Inactivation and Transmission of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies of
Animals".  The forum, which was held on May 13-14, 1996, fostered a scientific
discussion on TSE and approaches to controlling animal products and feed in
order to manage any risk of TSE to animal health.  <P>
    At the symposium, government, industry, and other scientific experts presented
information on risk management applied to TSE; current science on the tissue
distribution, inactivation, and transmission of TSE; current commercial
processing of animal proteins in the U.S.; HACCP application to the rendering
industry; and the feed industry's use of rendered ingredients.  USDA and FDA
also discussed major actions being taken by their agencies on BSE.  Additional
information on these actions will be included in future issues of the <i>FDA
Veterinarian</i>.<P>

<a name="RTFToC5">FEED
SUPPLEMENTS FOR HORSES: BUYER BEWARE 
</a></h3>
<i>The following article was adapted from a speech presented by Sharon A. Benz,
Ph.D., PAS to the Annual Meeting of the American Horse Council, June 3, 1996,
Washington, DC.  The article provides information on feed supplements for
horses which may be helpful for owners in making their purchasing decisions.
Veterinarians and equine nutritionists may wish to duplicate this article and
provide copies to their interested clients.   As always, material which appears
in the FDA Veterinarian is free of copyright and may be reproduced without
permission.</i><P>
FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine is responsible for the regulation
of animal drugs, medicated feeds, animal food additives, and devices for use in
animals.  Feed ingredients, food additives, and drugs used in horse feeds and
supplements are subject to the exact same laws as feed ingredients, food
additives, and drugs for other domestic animal species.  These products are
also regulated in the exact same manner.<P>
    Everyone who owns a horse wants it to look and perform at its best, and part
of this is good nutrition.  Therefore, owners are often searching for new feed
supplements that will improve the horse's health or provide a competitive edge
in the show ring or on the race track.  Unfortunately, the subjective nature of
most of the evaluations of equine performance lends itself to the promotion and
sale of many dubious products.  These products may not pose an imminent health
threat to a horse, that is, if a horse eats them it will not be acutely harmed.
However,  the effects of their long-term or high-level use may not be known or
their usefulness may not be supported by valid scientific research.  <P>
<b> Legal Background</b><P>
    While most of us call the grains, hays, etc. that horses consume
"feed," the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), defines it as food.
That is, food is an article used for food or drink for man or other animals. In
a precedent-setting judicial decision, "food" was described as an article that
provides taste, aroma, or nutritive value.  Foods are considered generally
recognized as safe or GRAS as sources of taste, nutrition, or aroma.  <P>
    A food additive as defined by the Act is a substance which directly or
indirectly becomes a component or otherwise affects the characteristics of a
food.  A substance is not a food additive if it is generally recognized as safe
(GRAS) for its intended purpose by scientists qualified by training and
experience to make such a determination.  Some examples of food additives are
anticaking agents, pelleting aids, and preservatives. Under the Act, a food
additive is unsafe unless a regulation is promulgated providing for its safe
use.<P>
    The definition of a drug is pretty straightforward.  A drug is any substance,
food or non-food, that is used to treat, cure, mitigate, or prevent a disease.
A drug is also any non-food substance that is intended to affect the structure
or function of the animal. Drugs must be shown to be safe and effective for
their intended use. Any product administered by injection is also considered a
drug.<P>
    Part of what distinguishes a food from a drug or a food additive is the
intended use.  For example, when vitamin E is used as a source of an essential
dietary nutrient, it is considered a food.  If it is used to treat or prevent
azoturia or tying up syndrome, it is a drug.  The legal distinction between a
food and a drug is critical in terms of FDA's regulatory authority.  A new drug
or new animal drug must be subject to an approval process prior to marketing.
Adequate data from controlled scientific studies to demonstrate the safety and
efficacy of the drug for its intended use are required before a drug may be
approved.  Unapproved drugs on the market are deemed adulterated drugs and may
be subject to regulatory action.  In contrast, the law does not require a food
to be subject to a premarket approval process unless it  is considered to be a
food additive.  <P>
    Going back to the vitamin E example, if the label for a vitamin E supplement
bears claims that consumption of the product will treat, prevent, or otherwise
affect azoturia or tying up syndrome, such claims establish the intent to offer
the vitamin E supplement as a drug.  Furthermore, since vitamin E is not
approved for this use, it is considered an unsafe new animal drug under the
Act.  This vitamin E supplement would be subject to regulation by FDA as a drug
as well as a food.  A company must remove the drug claims to restore its
regulatory status as a food.<P>
    Lastly, there are various products being called "nutraceuticals." There are no
laws or regulations that define what a nutraceutical is.  The term was coined
to describe the increasing number of products offered for the prevention or
treatment of disease but marketed under the guise of food supplements.  These
may include products that contain levels of essential nutrients beyond what is
recognized for normal nutrition or contain nutrients that are not recognized as
essential for the intended species, such as omega-3 fatty acids.  Presently,
these substances are considered new animal drugs if the labeling bears claims
to treat or prevent disease.  The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act
that was recently passed by Congress limits FDA's authority regarding these
types of substances for humans.  However, CVM's assessment of the new law is
that  it was not intended and does not apply to animal feeds.  This assessment
was published in the <i>Federal Register</i> on April 22, 1996.<P>
<b> Specific Examples</b><P>
    The following are specific examples of unapproved products and a
discussion of why horse owners should think twice before buying them.  The
first group of supplements is products which fill no recognized nutritional
need in the horse's diet.  There are no acceptable research studies in
peer-reviewed journals, nor has the Agency seen information to support the
safety and usefulness of these products.  Most  of these products have only
anecdotal information and some case studies attributed to them.  <P>
    An example of this type of product is Gamma Oryzanol, which appears to be a
relatively new product in the horse industry that is being publicized as a
growth promotant and as a safe natural alternative to anabolic steroids.  Gamma
Oryzanol is an extract of rice bran and has not been proven safe or effective
for use as a growth promotant in horses.  There is one growth promotant
approved for use in horses.  That approval is for chlortetracycline for use as
a growth promotant in horses under one year of age.<P>
    Octacosanol is a substance that is  being promoted to improve endurance and
speed reaction time, to strengthen muscles and to reduce oxygen debt. This
substance is found naturally in small amounts as a component of plant waxes and
some vegetable oils, notably wheat germ oil.  It has not been shown to be safe
and effective for any use in horse feeds.<P>
    Superoxide dismutase (SOD) or Dismutase is an enzyme that has a number of
important oxidative functions in cells including red and white blood cells and
muscle cells.  It is often sold as a feed supplement for treatment of
musclo-skeletal inflammation and stress, and for disease prevention.  Since
enzymes are proteins and proteins are digested in the gut, SOD would also be
digested in the same way as other proteins in the diet are digested to amino
acids or peptides for absorption.  Therefore, it is unlikely that any intact
enzyme would be absorbed and available to the cells in a horse's body.  This
product is basically a very expensive protein source.<P>
    Mucopolysaccharides are being promoted for use in feeds to increase synovial
fluid viscosity in the joints and improve and strengthen the integrity of the
joints.  Mucopolysaccharides are components of connective tissue and joints.
There are various forms of mucopolysaccharides on the market, such as
glycosaminoglycans and chrondroitin sulfates.  The products are most often
derived from bovine trachea, animal cartilage, and Australian perna canaliculus
mussel.  When these products are promoted to treat non-infectious degenerative
joint dysfunction of carpal joints in horses or to increase synovial fluid
viscosity in the joints, they are considered unapproved new animal drugs
because  they have not been proven to be safe and effective for these purposes.
 When given orally, there is a question as to the extent of absorption of these
compounds and how they reach the affected joint in sufficient amounts to have
any effect.<P>
    Other products that are being promoted as digestive aids and sources of
minerals are just normal components of soil such as humic acids and
montmorilonite. Humic acids are the decomposition products of organic matter,
particularly dead plants, and are found in the soil.  Montmorilonite is a type
of clay found in the soil which is permitted for use in the feed industry as an
anticaking agent in feeds.  These compounds are not approved and not shown to
be safe as digestive aids and have not been proven to serve as a source of
minerals to animals.  <P>
    Diatomaceous earth, another substance taken from the soil, is being promoted
as a natural dewormer.  It is the silicon skeletons of ancient plankton that
settled to the sea floor. It is an approved food additive as an anticaking
agent or as an inert carrier not to exceed 2 percent of the diet.  As a
dewormer, it would be considered an unapproved new animal drug, and has not
been shown to be either safe or effective for this purpose.  In fact, there was
a recent study that found diatomaceous earth was ineffective as a dewormer.
This study, completed at the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary
Medicine, concluded that diatomaceous earth had no effect whatsoever on fecal
egg counts or packed cell volume in sheep.<P>
    There is a product being promoted as vitamin B-15.  It is also called Pangamic
Acid and sometimes Dimethylglycine (DMG).  Pangamic acid is a poorly defined
chemical mixture allegedly isolated from apricot pits.  These products may vary
considerably in the composition.  Some are mixtures of calcium gluconate and
DMG and others contain diisopropylamine dichloroacetate, which is a drug.
Pangamic acid is neither a vitamin nor a dietary requirement for any animal.
Proponents claim that it decreases lactate production and plasma lactate levels
after exercise and that it improves speed.  Neither pangamic acid or DMG or
diisopropylamine dichloroacetate has been proven safe or effective for any use
in horse diets. <P>
    Another group of products includes nutrients that are being promoted for
therapeutic effects. Tryptophan and magnesium are two nutrients--tryptophan is
an amino acid and magnesium an essential mineral--that are being marketed for
sedative and calming purposes. The amounts being used greatly exceed that
needed for nutritional purposes.  Tryptophan has been the subject of much
scrutiny since several people who took tryptophan supplements developed
Eosinophilic Myalgia Syndrome, which is a painful and crippling nerve
degeneration disorder. Tryptophan is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) to
improve the quality of the protein source at nutritional levels.  Tryptophan
has not been shown to be safe and effective for use as a sedative. Moreover,
giving tryptophan in large doses for sedative purposes can cause severe amino
acid imbalances and deficiencies in other amino acids, and can also be toxic.
Similarly, large doses of magnesium can interfere with the utilization of other
minerals and result in mineral imbalances.<P>
    Phenylalanine is another amino acid that is often promoted for therapeutic
purposes as a painkiller.  Phenylalanine is also GRAS when added in small
quantities to diets to improve protein quality.  It is not approved and has not
been shown to be safe and effective as a painkiller.  Like tryptophan, large
doses of phenylalanine can cause severe amino acid imbalances and may be
toxic.<P>
    Vitamins are an interesting subject because not all vitamins that are dietary
essentials for one species are dietary essentials for other species. Vitamin C,
or ascorbic acid, is a good example.  Humans, non-human primates, guinea pigs,
and rainbow trout have a dietary requirement for vitamin C because it can not
be synthesized by the body.  It is not a dietary essential for horses.  Horses
can synthesize vitamin C in their bodies.  Moreover, the National Research
Council's (NRC's) Nutrient Requirements of Horses states that horses do not
absorb dietary vitamin C to any great extent. Some recent studies have
indicated that older, geriatric horses may not be able to synthesize enough
vitamin C to meet their requirements, but this has not been suggested for any
other class of horse.  Vitamin C, as well as various bioflavonoids, are often
promoted to stop bleeding in racehorses.  It has not been proven effective to
stop bleeding and would be considered an unapproved drug for this purpose. <P>
    Another vitamin often promoted for use in horse diets is biotin, a B vitamin,
which is a dietary essential for humans, pigs, chickens, dogs, and cats, among
others.  The horse's requirements for biotin, as for most of the B vitamins,
should be met by bacterial synthesis in the cecum and large intestine with
sufficient amounts absorbed to supply the animal's requirements without the
need for dietary supplementation. The NRC's 1989 publication "The Nutrient
Requirements of Horses" does not list a dietary requirement for biotin.  No
controlled studies have been published that establish a dietary biotin
requirement above that supplied by intestinal synthesis.  Some have theorized
that biotin will promote hoof growth based on the fact that, in animals that
have been shown to have dietary biotin requirements, a biotin deficiency is
characterized by poor hoof growth.  However, FDA is not aware of any data in
peer-reviewed scientific journals that indicates that biotin has an effect on
hoof growth in horses.  Biotin products that make claims for increased or
improved hoof growth are unapproved food additives.<P>
    Herbs and plant extracts are also marketed as feed supplements.  Many herb
products are marketed as sedatives.  While many herbs are GRAS as spices,
natural seasonings, or flavorings and are probably not unsafe to feed to
horses, products often contain herbs that are not considered GRAS.  There are
no scientific data in horses on the safety and usefulness of herb products.
Most information available on these products is anecdotal.  Generally,  the
levels of the natural constituents in herbs can vary greatly as a result of the
parts of the plant harvested, the growth stage of the plant at harvest, and
processing methods. Herbs also contain chemicals that can be harmful, such as
certain alkaloids.  Toxicities have been associated with comfrey and chaparral
in humans, and horsetail and snakeroot are known to be toxic to horses. <P>
<b> Advice for Horse Owners</b><P>
    While many of the products mentioned above are unlikely to do anything
to benefit horses, they may be found in local feed or tack shops.  These
products are not removed from the market because most of FDA's limited
resources must be focused on products or incidences that pose a known hazard to
human or animal health.  Thus, FDA does not always have the time or resources
to take enforcement action against products that are more fraudulent than
dangerous.  This is also true of feed programs administered by State
governments.  Therefore, horse owners must protect themselves from fraudulent
products.  Horse owners should be aware of the following signs when considering
purchasing feed supplements.<P>
    First, they should look for disclaimers on the label or promotional material
that read: "This is not a drug," and then other statements on the label claim
that the product prevents, mitigates, treats, or cures a disease.  The FDA does
not allow the use of  disclaimers on approved products. So, if the product has
such a disclaimer, it is not approved.  These types of products may be
indirectly unsafe to horses, if owners are trying to treat their own horses
rather than seeking advice from their veterinarian.<P>
    Second, owners should look for  exaggerated claims for a product or products
that are too good to be true.  These are products that may solve a variety of
problems, make horses win at shows, improve mental attitude, etc. <P>
    Third, horse owners should look for statements on products that use scare
tactics.  For example, products that claim that a horse has been suffering from
a deficiency for years and owners never knew it.  Other products may claim that
they are totally unique and unlike any other feed supplement on the market and
that it contains vitamin X or a new special ingredient. <P>
    Lastly, horse owners should look carefully at the label and learn how to
interpret them.  All labels for feed supplements should have a statement that
describes the intended use of the product, for example, a vitamin and mineral
supplement.  The label should also have a list of ingredients.  Federal
regulation requires that the ingredients be listed by the common or usual name
in descending order of predominance by weight.  The list of ingredients can
also help owners distinguish between a poor quality supplement and a good
quality one.  For example, the relative availability of copper from copper
oxide is very low and generally less than 10 percent when compared to the
copper sulfate, which is highly available.  Therefore, a poor quality
supplement may list copper oxide as a source of copper.    <P>
    Also, horse owners should look at the guaranteed analysis. For complete feeds,
many States now require guarantees be given for crude protein, fiber, and fat;
calcium; phosphorus;  copper; selenium; zinc; and vitamin A.  Guarantees should
also be given for any other major nutrients in the feed or supplement that is
emphasized in the labeling.  For example, if a label states "Horse supplement X
with Vitamin E," the vitamin E content of that supplement should be guaranteed
on the labeling.  In addition, quantities must be given in English units and
there must be adequate directions for use on the label that can be practically
followed.  If the guarantees are not provided on a per serving basis, some
simple calculations can provide owners with the amount per serving.  Owners
could then compare this figure to the daily requirement for that nutrient for
the horse.  Many times what looks like a great supplement may only provide 1 to
2 percent of the daily amount of a nutrient required by a horse!<P>
    An educated horse owner is the best horse owner.  If horse owners have any
questions about the safety or usefulness of a product, they should not hesitate
to contact an equine nutritionist or their veterinarian.  If horse owners still
have questions, they may write to the Center for Veterinary Medicine.<P>

<a name="RTFToC7">COMBATING
ANIMAL HEALTH FRAUD
</a></h3>
<P>
Health fraud flourishes in the animal drug and feed industries.  Disease
conditions in prized animals, such as racehorses or family pets, sometimes
prompt animal owners to seek miracle cures and quick fixes.  Additionally,
products which promise greater profits to farmers and ranchers and products
which promise certain conveniences or other advantages to animal owners may
make for easy victims of health fraud.<P>
Perpetrators of animal health fraud are easily able to target promotional
campaigns to desired audiences.  There are numerous trade press publications
directed to consumers who are involved in various animal-oriented professions
or avocations.  There are dog fancier and hunting dog magazines, journals for
pleasure horse or racehorse enthusiasts, and publications directed to all
aspects of food animal production.  Such publications allow for selected
placement of advertisements, as well as provide mailing lists for health fraud
promoters.<P>
Not all false or misleading or inadequately substantiated claims made in
conjunction with animal products are considered health fraud.  The designation
is normally associated with ineffective or unproven products for which a broad
range of generalized medical/therapeutic or function claims or greatly
exaggerated claims are made.  For example, marketing an iron preparation
intended for the prevention of anemia in baby pigs, in the absence of an
approved NADA, would constitute a violation of the Act.  However, it would not
be considered health fraud since iron is essential to the prevention of anemia.
On the other hand, marketing an electric shock device with claims to mitigate
the effects of snake bite in cattle would be considered health fraud because
the claim is false and without rational basis.<P>
Health fraud products which present a direct health hazard to animals (or to
humans) have the highest priority for enforcement.  An example would be an
electric dog training collar, which is shown to cause injury to dogs.<P>
Economic fraud is of somewhat lower priority for enforcement in animal drugs
and feeds.  Examples include:<P>

<ul>
<li>harmless but unproven nutritional supplements which purport to make
horses win more races, make sows produce larger litters, or make animals
resistant to any number of diseases.  MSM (methylsulfonyl methane) is an
example.

<li>products which claim to "build blood," usually in performance animals,
thereby  increasing stamina, improving breeding, etc.

<li>pet foods to which certain drugs (such as chlortetracycline) are added
with a claim  for eliminating body odors associated with pets.

<li>enzyme products, and direct fed microbial products with live organisms
which make  therapeutic function claims for improving the health or
productivity of animals.</ul><P>
CVM attempts to make information regarding significant trends in health fraud
available to the public through issuances of press releases, talk papers, and
the <i>FDA Veterinarian</i>, and through the FDA Public Affairs and Health
Fraud Staff and other communications channels.<P>
Veterinary products suspected of being fraudulent or otherwise misbranded or
adulterated should be reported to the FDA District Office.<P>

<a name="RTFToC8">CVM
OFFICE OF NEW ANIMAL DRUG EVALUATION EXTERN PROGRAM
</a></h3>
                               by Elizabeth Reese, D.V.M. &amp; Thomas Letonja,
D.V.M., M.S., Ph.D.<P>
CVM has initiated a new program to foster continuing education of review
scientists in the development, production, and evaluation of animal drugs by
facilitating communication among regulatory and drug sponsor scientists.  This
new initiative, titled, the "CVM Extern Program," involves direct interaction
between CVM and drug sponsor scientists.  Time is split between the sponsor's
headquarters and visits to external Study Investigators at study sites.<P>
Broad areas of interest to CVM include animal drug feasibility studies, new
animal drug discovery, animal drug development, efficacy evaluation, safety
evaluation, and animal drug manufacturing.  <P>
The first Extern Program was successfully completed in Animal Health Product
Development with Pfizer Central Research in Groton, CT.  Drs. M. E. Reese
(Division of Therapeutic Drugs for Non-Food Animals, Equine and Antimicrobial
Drugs Branch, HFV-114) and Thomas Letonja (Division of Therapeutic Drugs for
Food Animals, Antiparasitic and Physiologic Drugs Branch, HFV-135) participated
in a two-week program (April 8 - 19, 1996).<P>
The first week, Drs. Reese and Letonja visited Pfizer's research headquarters
in Groton, CT.   During this time, Drs. Reese and Letonja participated in an
orientation tour of the facilities and an introduction of the animal health
development organization and personnel.  They also participated in ongoing
Project Team activities and attended several meetings and discussions.  Drs.
Reese and Letonja presented a seminar to explain CVM's organization, the review
process of a typical submission and our interactions with other Federal and
State regulatory organizations.  The seminar was well attended by Animal Health
Product Development personnel and generated an animated exchange between CVM
representatives and Pfizer's personnel. <P>
The second week of the Program focused on the monitor visits of clinical trial
sites.  Time was arranged by each Project Team based on ongoing activities.
The externs traveled to clinical investigator sites accompanied by Pfizer's
monitors.  Dr. Reese visited sites located in Louisiana and Texas, and Dr.
Letonja interacted with external collaborators in Texas and Wisconsin.  Back in
Groton, the final day of the second week was reserved for discussion of the
visit, the mutual benefits derived, and the future direction of the extern
program.    <P>
Both the Pfizer participants and the CVM Externs were enlightened by all the
issues discussed and enjoyed the free exchange of information between the two
organizations.<P>

<a name="RTFToC10">UPDATE
ON CODEX
</a></h3>
                        by Sharon R. Thompson, D.V.M.<P>
The Codex Alimentarius Commission was named as the international reference
organization for health and safety measures relating to food in the Uruguay
Round Text on Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures.  This text was brought
into force with the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on
January 1, 1995.  The WTO is the multilateral organization that will implement
international trade rules and is the successor organization to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).<P>
The primary objective of the WTO is to liberalize world trade and place it on a
secure basis, thus contributing to economic growth and development.  The WTO
also functions as the principal international body concerned with
multilaterally negotiating the reduction of trade barriers and other measures
that distort competition.  Additionally, it serves as a place for countries to
raise their concerns regarding the trade policies of their trading partners.<P>
Prior to the WTO agreement, there were no effective international rules to
distinguish trade-protectionist measures from legitimate import regulations to
ensure food safety or to otherwise protect the health of people, animals, and
plants.  Under the SPS text, each nation can continue to make a sovereign
determination of its acceptable level of risk.  Alternatively, countries may
use international standards.  A nation utilizing an international standard such
as a Codex maximum residue limit for veterinary drug residues is seen as
meeting its obligations under the provisions of the SPS agreement.<P>
The SPS agreement does recognize the right of countries to maintain standards
which are stricter than international standards.  However, stricter measures
must be based on science and be justifiable as a consequence of a
non-discriminatory lower level of acceptable risk.  The SPS agreement is
designed to curtail current import restrictions that are based on arbitrary and
unsubstantiated health and safety concerns.  It is also intended to prevent
countries from avoiding commitments under the WTO agreement to open their
markets.<P>
Because of the awareness within Codex that issues related to veterinary drug
residues were creating restrictions to trade in meat and meat products, a
separate Codex Committee was formed in 1986 to develop standards to address
this problem.  The Codex Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Food
(CCRVDF) has been meeting on a regular basis since its formation and has
contributed greatly to the Codex process, both through its development of drug
residue standards and its illumination of the need to clarify that Codex
decisionmaking must be based on science.<P>
Veterinary drug residue standards are proposed to the CCRVDF by the FAO/WHO
Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA).  The JECFA recommends an
acceptable daily intake (ADI) and a maximum residue limit (MRL) for a
veterinary drug residue in a specific food commodity.   An MRL is essentially
equivalent to a "tolerance," which is the term used in the U.S.  The CCRVDF can
either accept, reject, or modify the recommendations of the JECFA and makes a
decision whether to forward the draft standard through the Codex Step
procedure.  The CCRVDF first considers the draft standard at Step 4.  If the
Committee decides to advance the draft standard, it will be forwarded to the
Codex Alimentarius Commission for adoption at Step 5.  If the Commission reacts
positively to the draft standard, it is then returned to the CCRVDF for
consideration as a final draft at Step 7.  Final adoption takes place by the
Commission at Step 8 when the draft standard is forwarded from the Committee in
final form. <P>
This process is very time-consuming. Although the CCRVDF has been meeting
regularly since 1986, the first standards for veterinary drug residues in food
were not adopted by the Commission until 1993.  This delay stems from the
controversial nature of the first standards developed by the CCRVDF, those for
the growth-promoting hormones.  In fact, although these standards were first
presented to the Commission for adoption at Step 8 in 1991, final adoption did
not occur until the Commission meeting in July 1995.  <P>
Standards for the following compounds were adopted at Step 8 (final stage) at
the 20th and 21st Sessions of the Codex Alimentarius Commission:<P>
    Albendazole<br>
    Benzylpenicillin<br>
    Carbadox<br>
    Closantel<br>
Estradiol 17-B<br>
Flubendazole<br>
Isometamidium<br>
    Ivermectin<br>
    Oxytetracycline<br>
Progesterone<br>
Sulfadimidine<br>
Testosterone<br>
Thiabendazole<br>
        Trenbolone Acetate<br>
Zeranol<P>
In the National Performance Review on Reinventing Food Regulations released in
January 1996, FDA and FSIS committed to develop proposed procedures within one
year on the review of Codex standards for consideration for acceptance.
Currently, FDA only has procedures in place for review of Codex food commodity
standards.  FDA decisions to accept Codex standards will include the
opportunity for public review and comments, especially if a need is identified
to revise or revoke existing U.S. requirements.  Finalized procedures would
allow CVM to make decisions on the acceptance of Codex veterinary drug residue
standards, for the purposes of imported food commodities and/or domestic food
production.<P>
  
The National Performance Report also highlighted the need to develop a
procedure to allow acceptance of Codex standards when no approval for the drug
exists in the U.S.  The acceptance of this type of Codex standard would only
apply to imported food commodities.  Use of the drug in the U.S. would still
require the filing and approval of a new animal drug application.  FDA is
supportive of legislative change to address this problem.<P>
Finally, the U.S. believes that the scientific basis of Codex standards must be
enhanced.  This issue was outlined in the U.S. Codex Strategic Plan and
continues to be a focus of U.S. efforts in Codex.  The U.S. is not suggesting
that Codex has not utilized good science in the past; however, we believe that
certain changes are needed to make the scientific basis of the standards clear,
consistent, and transparent.  Examples of these changes would be to encourage
FAO/WHO to establish minimum data sets for JECFA/JMPR, to establish criteria
for selecting experts for expert groups and to make vacancies publicly
available, and to assure clear and adequate documentation of the basis for
decisionmaking on each standard.  The U.S. believes that these changes are
necessary to pave the way for greater acceptance of Codex standards in the
U.S.<P>
These ongoing harmonization efforts, undoubtedly, will impact on the trade of
meat and meat products in the future.  The adoption of Codex MRLs for
veterinary drug residues by member countries of the Codex Alimentarius
Commission will benefit animal producers in exporting worldwide.<P>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC12">QUESTIONS
AND ANSWERS ON ADES
</a></h3>
<P>
This issue of the <i>FDA Veterinarian</i> contains the fifth in a series of
questions and answers that are frequently asked about CVM's Veterinary Adverse
Drug Experience (ADE) program.<P>
Q.  Why should veterinarians in practice care about reporting an ADE?<P>
A.  Veterinarians in practice depend on the information available in drug
labeling to make informed choices about the risks and benefits associated with
the use of a drug.  The purpose of ADE monitoring is to ensure that animal drug
labeling is adequate and accurate.<P>
    In spite of the highest standards for safety and effectiveness that exist for
FDA approval, not everything is known about a drug when it is first marketed.
Due to the limited size and controlled nature of premarketing clinical trials,
only the most common adverse events will be observed and included in product
labeling at the time of FDA approval.  An accurate safety profile emerges only
after a product is marketed and the number and spectrum of animals receiving
the drug increases.<P>
    As a practicing veterinarian, you are in a unique position  to observe adverse
clinical outcomes associated with the use of drug products.  Some of these
problems may only be associated with extra-label drug use.  You can assist in
the development of a complete safety profile by reporting adverse experiences.
Such reports are often the first signal that a problem exists.  By
participating in the reporting program and contributing to our knowledge of
animal drugs, you provide a valuable service to animals, the public, and your
colleagues in the veterinary profession. <P>
Q.  Where can I obtain information for a specific drug concerning potential
adverse reactions?<P>
A.  The drug manufacturer is usually the best source for this type of
information.  Other sources include the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine, the
FDA/CVM Internet World Wide Web server (http://www.cvm.fda.gov/), the National
Animal Poison Control Center and veterinary computer networks, such as VIN
(America Online) and NOAH (Compuserve).<P>

<a name="RTFToC9">CVM
ISSUES LETTER TO VETERINARIANS ON FLUOROQUINOLONES
</a></h3>
<P>
On March 25, 1996, CVM issued a letter to bovine, swine, and poultry veterinary
practitioners, advising them of their responsibility as part of the public
health community regarding the use of fluoroquinolones.  The FDA recently
approved sarafloxacin (Saraflox 7 WSP and Injection) for use in broiler
chickens and growing turkeys for the control of morbidity associated with
<i>Escherichia coli</i> organisms.  This is the first fluoroquinolone approved
for use in food-producing animals.  Enrofloxacin (Baytril 7) is approved for
use in dogs and cats.  <P>
    Experts acknowledge that the use of fluoroquinolones in animals may facilitate
the emergence of bacterial resistance.  When this occurs in enteric pathogens,
the potential for transfer to humans exists, especially through food.
Cross-resistance occurs throughout this entire class of drugs; therefore,
resistance to one fluoroquinolone would compromise the effectiveness of all
fluoroquinolone drugs.  Evidence from some European researchers indicates that
quinolone-resistant bacteria, particularly <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> and some
strains of <i>Salmonella</i>, are emerging in treated animal populations.  The
use of fluoroquinolones in food-producing animals is of particular concern to
the human medical community because these drugs are used to treat a variety of
infectious conditions.  Practitioners are asked to do their part in preventing
possible resistance by avoiding unnecessary or inappropriate treatment of
animals with these drugs.  Their cooperation is vital to ensure the continued
availability of these products.<P>

                         by Linda A. Burgos, D.V.M.<P>
On May 30, 1996, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) hosted a symposium
sponsored by the CVM Training Committee.  The invited speaker was American
Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) President-Elect, Mary Beth Leininger,
D.V.M.  <P>
Dr. Leininger highlighted the attributes of the veterinary medical profession
and emphasized the importance of the profession to the general well-being of
humans as well as animals.  She spoke of the new atmosphere at the AVMA to
focus on serving the needs of its members.  Dr. Leininger discussed the various
tasks facing the AVMA such as representing the veterinary profession to the
world, and providing a network to connect all of the diversities within the
profession.<P>
Dr. Leininger informed the seminar attendees about ways to access the AVMA.
She discussed how to get questions answered, how to get action from the AVMA,
how to get scientific articles published in the organization's two journals,
and how to get involved in the AVMA.  Dr. Leininger emphasized the availability
and willingness of the AVMA staff members answering the telephones to assist
veterinarians.  Dr. Leininger even offered her voice mail telephone number and
electronic mail address followed by a sincere invitation for veterinarians to
use these means to contact her.  Dr. Leininger may be reached at the AVMA by
calling 1-800-248-2862, Extension 318.  Her e-mail address is
74232.1150@compuserve.<P>
Dr. Leininger responded to questions from the audience.  She addressed issues
such as the increasing legal value of companion animals, pet health insurance
and third party payment of animal health care, and the roles of the AVMA
President.  Dr. Leininger cited the roles of the AVMA President as being chief
spokesperson for the organization and the primary public relations person for
the veterinary medical profession.  Her goals for her term as AVMA President
are to re-emphasize the importance of AVMA members and provide for their needs.
The symposium concluded with closing remarks by Center Director Stephen F.
Sundlof and presentation of a certificate of appreciation to Dr. Leininger.<P>

FDA/CVM and the USDA/CSREES National Research Support Project Number 7 (NRSP-7)
are sponsoring a workshop titled "Drug Availability for Minor Species in the
21st Century." <P>
    The Minor Use Animal Drug Program has been working since 1982 to develop the
necessary data to obtain drug approvals for minor species.  The changing
regulatory and economic situation offers challenges and opportunities to fill
the increasing need for minor use drugs.  The incentives for development of
these drugs are few, and the impact of the Animal Medicinal Drug Use
Clarification Act of 1995 (AMDUCA) is unclear.  <P>
    NRSP-7 and FDA/CVM are drawing together advocates and critics of schemes for
providing drugs for these minor indications in a workshop to be held September
12-13, 1996 at the Holiday Inn, Bethesda, Maryland.  It will feature a series
of speakers to focus attention on various species, i.e., sheep and goats, veal
calves, deer, game birds, ratites, zoologic species, aquaculture, ornamental
fish, rabbits, and llamas.  In addition, there will be representatives from the
pharmaceutical industry to address their concerns and problems.  The format
will include small integrated groups to formulate priorities and strategies to
move into the next century.   The main goal of the workshop is to allow
interaction with various groups and discuss priorities and problems
encountered.<P>

<b>2.  TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><P>
Target animal safety data from the FOI summary for PMF 5366, <B>57 FR 49486</B>,
November 2,  1992, demonstrated that administration of morantel tartrate in
feed at 10 times the recommended dose for 3 consecutive days is safe and
nontoxic to goats.<P>
Efficacy data from the FOI summary for <B>PMF 5366</B>, <B>57 FR 49486</B>, November 2, 1992,
demonstrated that morantel tartrate at 10 mg/kg body weight, as a single
treatment, is efficacious in removing 99.3, 97.7, and 91.4%, respectively, of
adult <i>Haemonchus  contortus,  Ostertagia (Teladorsagia)  circumcincta,
</i>and <i>Trichostrongylus  axei </i>from the abomasum of goats.<P>
<b>3.  HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><P>
Toxicity Testing:<br>
These have been adequately addressed in the FOI summary for <B>PMF 5366</B>.<P>
Target tissues, marker residues, and tolerances:  Because this is a minor
species application, the target tissues, marker residues and tolerances for
morantel tartrate residues in cattle were applied to goat.  The target tissue
is liver, and, because the drug is approved for use in lactating animals, milk
is also considered a target tissue.  The marker residue for both liver and milk
is N-methyl-l,3-propanediamine (MAPA).  The tolerance for MAPA in liver is 0.7
ppm (<B>21 CFR 556.425</B>).  Although an official tolerance for MAPA in milk was not
established in <B>21 CFR 556.425</B>, a research (unofficial) tolerance of 91 ppb of
MAPA was established based on data submitted to support the dairy cattle
approval.  Therefore, a tolerance of 91 ppb of MAPA was used to evaluate
residues of morantel tartrate in goat milk.<P>
Withdrawal Time:  Residue depletion data submitted under <B>PMF 5366</B>, <B>57 FR 49486</B>,
November 2, 1992, support a 30 day withdrawal period for a single 10 mg
morantel tartrate/kg body weight dose to goats and a zero milk discard period
for a single 10 mg morantel tartrate/kg body weight dose to goats.<P>
<b>4.  AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><P>
The data submitted in support of this supplemental NADA comply with the
requirements of section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that morantel tartrate,
when used under the proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for the
removal and control of gastrointestinal nematodes in goats.<P>
Based on tissue and milk residue studies, a 30 day slaughter period and a 0-day
milk discard period are assigned for goats treated with morantel tartrate at
the recommended  dosage.<P>
The original approval of morantel tartrate was as an over-the-counter drug.
Accurate diagnosis of parasitism in goats, which is the new species to be added
to the label, can be made with reasonable degree of certainty by the layman.
Adequate directions for use have been written for the layman, and the
conditions for use prescribed on the labeling are likely to be followed in
practice.   Therefore, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has concluded
that this product shall have over-the-counter marketing status.<P>
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this
action and has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on
the human environment and that an environmental impact statement is not
required.   The agency's finding of no significant impact (FONSI) and the
evidence supporting that finding are contained in an environmental assessment,
which may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Park Building
(Room 1-23), 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, Maryland  20857.<P>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy <B>21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)</B>, this is a
Category II change.  The approval of this change is not expected to have any
adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug.<P>
Under Section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval for food producing animals does not qualify for marketing
exclusivity because the supplemental application does not contain reports of
new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue
studies) and new human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or
residue studies) essential to the approval and conducted or sponsored by the
applicant.<P>

Extralabel Drug Use in Animals

AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a final rule
to allow veterinarians to prescribe extralabel uses of certain approved
animal drugs and approved human drugs for animals. This action
implements the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act of 1994 (the
AMDUCA). This rule will provide veterinarians greater flexibility for
using approved drugs for animal use.

DATES: This final rule is effective December 9, 1996.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard L. Arkin, Center for
Veterinary Medicine (HFV-238), Food and Drug Administration, 7500
Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301-594-1737.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    On October 22, 1994, the President signed into law the AMDUCA (Pub.
L. 103-396). Prior to enactment of the AMDUCA, section 512 of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360b) had
provided that a new animal drug (NAD) was deemed unsafe unless it was
subject to an approved application and the drug, its labeling and its
use conform to such approved application. Therefore, use of an NAD
without an approved application or in a manner different from that set
forth in an approved application resulted in the drug being unsafe
under the act. Section 501(a)(5) of the act (21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5))
provides that a drug deemed to be unsafe under section 512 of the act
is adulterated. The AMDUCA allows veterinarians to prescribe extralabel
uses of approved animal drugs and approved human drugs for animals.
    The provisions of the AMDUCA relating to extralabel use of approved
NAD's provide that such use must be in accordance with conditions
specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary)
by regulations. The animal drug provisions also include several
safeguards in allowing veterinarians to prescribe drugs for extralabel
uses: (1) If the Secretary finds there is a reasonable probability that
an extralabel use may present a risk to the public health, the
Secretary may establish a safe level for a residue for such extralabel
use by regulation or order, and may require the development of
analytical methods for residue detection; (2) the Secretary may, by
general regulation, provide access to records of veterinarians to
ascertain any use or intended use that the Secretary determines may
present a risk to the public health; and (3) if the Secretary finds,
after affording an opportunity for public comment, that an extralabel
animal drug use presents a risk to the public health or that no
acceptable analytical method has been developed and submitted, the
Secretary may prohibit such extralabel use by order. In addition, the
AMDUCA provides that an extralabel use of an approved NAD is not
permitted if there is an approved animal drug with the same active
ingredient, dosage form, and concentration provides for that different
use.
    The AMDUCA also allows veterinarians to prescribe approved human
drugs for use in animals under conditions specified by the Secretary by
regulations. The human drug provisions do not, however, contain the
express conditions set out in the statute for extralabel use of
approved NAD's.
    The AMDUCA adds a new section 301(u) to the act (21 U.S.C. 331(u))
which provides that failure to comply with the regulations or orders
implementing the AMDUCA is a prohibited act. The AMDUCA amends section
301(e) of the act to provide that failure to maintain records or
provide access to records of veterinarians, as provided by general
regulations, is a prohibited act. In addition, the AMDUCA amends
section 512(l) of the act to require drug sponsors to keep records and
make reports regarding extralabel uses.
    Neither the AMDUCA nor the implementing regulations are intended to
lessen the responsibility of the manufacturer, the veterinarian, or the
food producer with regard to violative drug residues or other adverse
impact on human health. Under the act and this final rule, any amount
of residue that may present a risk to the public health resulting from
an extralabel use would constitute a violation of the act subject to
enforcement action, if a safe level or tolerance has not been
established. Residue exceeding an established safe level would also
constitute a violation of the act, as would residue resulting from an
extralabel use where the residue exceeds an established tolerance. The
provisions of the AMDUCA are effective upon adoption of a final rule
implementing the statute. The AMDUCA requires publication of a final
rule within 2 years of the date of enactment.
    As noted in the preamble to the proposed rule, until publication of
a final implementing rule makes the AMDUCA effective, extralabel use of
drugs in animals continues to be a violation of the act. FDA's existing
enforcement policies relating to extralabel use have been described in
two FDA Compliance Policy Guides (CPG's) entitled ``Extralabel Use of
New Animal Drugs in Food-Producing Animals'' and ``Human-Labeled Drugs
Distributed and Used in Animal Medicine.'' The extralabel CPG's were
issued to provide information and direction to FDA personnel in the
field about the circumstances in which FDA would ordinarily take
regulatory action against extralabel use of approved NAD's and human
drugs in animals and those situations in which the agency would
ordinarily exercise its regulatory discretion and not take action.
    The scant legislative history of the AMDUCA includes evidence that
the AMDUCA was intended to codify policies similar to those in FDA's
CPG's . The agency has generally followed policies similar to those in
the existing CPG's in this final rule. It is anticipated that these
CPG's will be withdrawn after this final rule is published. FDA may, as
necessary, issue additional CPG's or other guidance related to
extralabel use of animal and human drugs.

II. The Proposed Rule

A. Summary of the Proposed Rule

    In the Federal Register of May 17, 1996 (61 FR 25106), FDA
published a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement the AMDUCA. The
rule as proposed would apply to the extralabel use in an animal of any
approved NAD or approved human drug used by or on the lawful order of a
veterinarian within the context of a veterinarian-client-patient
relationship. Human drugs include approved new human drugs, as well as
over-the-counter (OTC) drugs marketed under OTC monographs as safe and
effective and not misbranded within the meaning of 21 CFR part 330.
    Consistent with the policies expressed in the CPG's, the proposed
rule limited extralabel uses for food-producing animals to those that
provide alternative treatment modalities when the health of an animal
is threatened, or suffering or death may result from failure to treat
an animal, i.e., therapeutic uses. The proposal asked for comment on
requests

[[Page 57733]]

to permit extralabel drug use for some nontherapeutic uses, but did not
provide for such uses.
    The proposed rule included a number of definitions, including
definitions for the phrases ``a reasonable probability that a drug's
use may present a risk to the public health,'' ``use of a drug may
present a risk to the public health,'' and ``use of a drug presents a
risk to the public health.'' In defining these phrases, the agency
considered the common meaning of the words in these phrases, and other
regulations in which FDA has defined similar concepts.
    The proposed rule reiterated the statutory prohibition against the
advertising and promotion of extralabel drug uses. It provided for the
inspection of veterinary records by FDA investigators, including
records required under the act and regulations and State veterinary
practice and pharmacy acts, to ascertain any extralabel use that the
agency has determined may present a risk to the public health. The
proposed rule specified particular extralabel uses that are not
permitted, i.e., extralabel use by a lay person (except when under a
veterinarian's supervision), extralabel use in or on an animal feed,
extralabel use resulting in any residue which may present a risk to the
public health, and extralabel use resulting in any residue above an
established safe level or tolerance. The proposal also included
labeling requirements. In addition, it provided conditions for
compounding of approved NAD's and approved human drugs.
    The proposal would require the prescribing or dispensing
veterinarian to: (1) Diagnose and evaluate the conditions; (2)
establish a substantially extended withdrawal period prior to marketing
of milk, meat, or eggs supported by appropriate scientific information;
(3) institute procedures to assure that the identity of the treated
animal or animals is carefully maintained; and (4) take appropriate
measures to assure that assigned timeframes for withdrawal are met and
no illegal drug residues occur in any food. The proposal included some
additional conditions for permitted extralabel uses in food animals of
a human drug, or of an NAD approved only in use in nonfood animals.
    The proposal also stated that FDA may prohibit the extralabel use
of an approved new animal or human drug in food-producing animals if
FDA determines that an acceptable analytical method needs to be
established and this method has not been established or cannot be
established, or use of the drug presents a risk to the public health.
It added that a prohibition may be a general ban on the use of the drug
or class of drugs, or may be limited to a specific species, indication,
dosage form, route of administration, or combination of factors.
    The proposed rule also included procedures for establishing and
announcing safe levels, for developing analytical methods, and for
issuing orders prohibiting extralabel uses of drugs in food-producing
animals. The proposed rule also included provisions regarding
extralabel drug use in nonfood animals.
    In addition to publishing the proposed rule in the Federal
Register, FDA gave notice of the publication of the proposed rule by
various additional means and invited comments. The comment period for
the proposed rule lasted 75 days, closing July 31, 1996. Several
requests for an extension of the comment period were denied to enable
the agency to meet the statutory deadline for publishing the final
rule.

B. Discussion of Comments

    FDA received approximately 110 comments on the proposed rule. A
discussion of the comments and FDA's responses follows:
1. Issues on Which FDA Requested Comment
    (1) The agency invited comment as to whether extralabel use should
be permitted when an approved drug is found by the veterinarian to be
ineffective in a particular clinical situation. The AMDUCA provides
that an extralabel use of an approved animal drug is not permitted if
an approved NAD with the same active ingredient in the same dosage form
and concentration exists for that use. The animal drug CPG contains an
exception that permits an extralabel use where the veterinarian finds,
within the context of a valid veterinary-client-patient relationship,
that an approved NAD is clinically ineffective for its intended use.
However, neither the statute nor the proposed rule contained a similar
provision.
    A large number of comments contended that the regulations should
provide such an exception. The comments stated that veterinarians
frequently encounter clinical situations in which an approved drug is
ineffective. One comment observed that approved drugs are effective
under labeled conditions in most circumstances, so that it would not be
inconsistent with the approval provisions of the act to provide for
extralabel use in specific situations in which a drug is ineffective
under labeled conditions. The comment asserted that the AMDUCA is
intended to codify policies similar to those in the CPG's, such as the
``clinically ineffective'' provision.
    FDA recognizes that the AMDUCA does not provide any explicit
exceptions to its prohibition against extralabel drug use when an
approved NAD with the same active ingredient in the same dosage form
and concentration exists for that use. The agency believes, however,
that not allowing extralabel drug use in situations in which the
approved NAD is clinically ineffective would produce an absurd result.
Under established principles of statutory construction, a statute
should be construed to avoid an absurd result. (See e.g., Rowland v.
California Men's Colony, 113 S. Ct. 716, 720 (1993).)
    Under the act, an NAD can be found to be effective even though the
drug may not be effective in treating all target animals for the
labeled indication. The statute requires that there be substantial
evidence that an NAD is effective for its labeled indications. The
legislative history of the 1962 Amendments, which added the
effectiveness standard to the act, indicated that evidence sufficient
to meet the ``substantial evidence'' standard could be met where ``the
studies * * * show that the drug will help a substantial percentage of
patients in a given disease condition but will not be effective in
other cases.'' (See S. Rept. 1744, 87th Cong. 2d sess., Part 1 at 16
(1962).) For those cases in which an approved NAD is not clinically
effective, it is as if the drug does not exist for that condition.
Under the AMDUCA, if there is no approved NAD for a particular
condition, veterinarians are allowed to use a drug extralabelly;
however, veterinarians would not be allowed to use a drug extralabelly
in essentially the same situation, that is, when the approved NAD is
clinically ineffective.
    Therefore, the agency has concluded that, under the AMDUCA,
allowing extralabel drug use when the approved NAD is clinically
ineffective is legally supportable. The agency cautions, however, that
veterinarians must have a basis for determining that the use of the
approved NAD is clinically ineffective in the animal or animals
involved. Unsupported claims of clinical ineffectiveness will not be
allowed to circumvent the statutory prohibition against extralabel drug
use when an approved NAD for that condition exists. Proposed
Sec. 530.20(a)(1) has been amended to provide for extralabel drug use
in the case of an approved NAD that is clinically ineffective.
    (2) The agency asked for comment as whether extralabel use of
animal and

[[Page 57734]]

human drugs should be permitted for nontherapeutic uses such as
improved reproductive responses in terrestrial and, especially, in
aquatic food-producing animals.
    More than a dozen organizations and several individuals advocated
extralabel use for all reproductive purposes. One comment objected to
the concept, several comments could be interpreted to be in opposition,
and one other comment urged the agency to be extremely judicious in
granting such an exception. Reasons advanced for allowing reproductive-
related extralabel uses included: All reproductive uses are
therapeutic; drugs used for reproductive purposes pose little human
food safety threat, and in fact some broodstock (e.g., broodfish) can
be considered nonfood animals; reproductive use of drugs is especially
important in minor species (e.g., aquaculture) and other limited
situations (e.g., contraceptive uses in nuisance animals and free
ranging wildlife) for which few drugs are approved; and extralabel use
of reproductive drugs conserves animal resources, and allows
application of new technology (e.g., embryo transfer and artificial
insemination).
    The agency agrees that the comments have identified some important
reasons for extralabel use of drugs for nontherapeutic reproductive
purposes. The agency believes that some, but not all, reproductive-
related drug uses are therapeutic and would be permitted under the
final rule. However, after further consideration the agency has
concluded that the statute is not intended to provide for extralabel
use of drugs for nontherapeutic purposes. For example, Senator Coats
identified the problem of the AMDUCA was intended to address as ``too
few approved animal health products to treat all animal illnesses,'' as
such:
     in order to treat animals adequately and to alleviate animal
suffering, veterinarians must use some products in an extra-label
fashion * * * [AMDUCA] is at best a short-term solution to a long-
term and larger problem-the lack of drugs available to treat
animals. The legislation, as it passed, will not address this
problem * * * [W]e must address the larger and increasingly urgent
problem of animal drug availability.
(140 Congressional Record S14272 (daily ed. October 5, 1994).)
The agency believes that including nontherapeutic uses in these final
rules is beyond the scope of the AMDUCA's intent to allow the legal use
of drugs extralabelly to treat animal illnesses. Allowing
nontherapeutic uses would extend the AMDUCA's scope into the animal
drug availability issues, issues that Congress reserved to address at
another time. In this regard legislation was recently enacted, the
Animal Drug Availability Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-250), that is
intended to streamlime the animal drug approval process to increase the
availability of approved animal drugs. The new legislation should
decrease the need for extralabel use of drugs as more animal drug
products for both therapeutic and nontherapeutic uses are approved. The
agency also notes that it anticipates examining extralabel use which is
not covered by the AMDUCA, such as nontherapeutic extralabel drug use,
in the context of determining regulatory priorities. The agency will
either issue another CPG or determine on a case-by-case basis those
situations, if any, which fall outside the scope of the AMDUCA that
would be of low regulatory priority.
    (3) One comment, from the American Association of Swine
Practitioners (AASP), advocated extralabel use for what the association
called ``therapeutic preventative medicine.'' An example would be
extralabel use for medicated early weaning and segregated early weaning
of pigs, to avoid morbidity or death loss that can be quite high among
weaned pigs if treatment is delayed until clinical signs appear. AASP
noted that the preventive extralabel use is appropriate in those
clinical situations in which the veterinarian is well acquainted with
the production system, the profile of the animals and the diseases
present or likely to occur. The agency agrees that as long as the
health of the animals is threatened, extralabel uses for preventive
purposes is acceptable. The proposed rule did not include the word
``immediately,'' which had appeared before the word ``threatened'' in
the CPG. This change was made to make it clear that preventive uses
when the health of the animal is threatened are permitted. However, the
agency cautions that the veterinarian must have a rational basis, such
as that cited by AASP in the case of weaned pigs, for determining that
the health of the animals is actually threatened. Also, preventive
extralabel use would be subject to other restrictions in the
regulations, such as restrictions on extralabel use of drugs
administered in feed.
    (4) The agency asked for comment on appropriate ways to balance
extralabel use with the need to preserve the goal of increased
availability of NAD's approved for such uses under section 512 of the
act. Although the agency made the request in connection with its
discussion of nontherapeutic extralabel uses, the comments addressed
the issue more generally.
    The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) stated that
Congress, by permitting use of a less expensive approved human drug in
companion animals when an approved NAD is available, placed higher
priority on reducing costs to consumers and pet owners than on
incentives for drug manufacturers. The comment stated that this
emphasis is appropriate because ``the real problem of animal drug
availability pertains to approved animal drugs for use in food
animals.'' With regard to food animals, AVMA and AASP emphasized the
need for extralabel uses for which the market is extremely small and
therefore would provide little financial incentive to drug
manufacturers even if extralabel use were restricted. The Animal Health
Institute (AHI), which represents a number of animal drug
manufacturers, focused on what it called a double standard created by
the proposed regulations. According to AHI, the regulations allow the
veterinarian to determine whether a drug is safe, until FDA determines
otherwise; on the other hand, a drug that goes through the approval
process is considered unsafe until the sponsor proves it to be safe.
The comment concluded that, ``given this scenario, a company may
conclude that it doesn't make business sense to expend the considerable
resources necessary to prove safety (and efficacy) for new label
claims.'' Other comments suggested that the agency should create
incentives for drug manufacturers to submit new animal drug
applications (NADA's), for example, by revising the approval
requirements.
    The agency recognizes the need for increased availability for
animal drugs and has provided for such availability as allowed under
the AMDUCA in these regulations. In addition, as indicated above,
recent legislation the Animal Drug Availability Act of 1996 has been
enacted to increase the availability of approved animal drugs. The
legislative history indicates Congress' concern about the availability
of approved drugs and discussed its intention to deal with the drug
availability issue separately. With regard to the ``double standard''
comment, the regulation does not create

[[Page 57735]]

the standard but merely implements the statute that allows
veterinarians, under regulations issued by FDA, to prescribe drugs for
animals that have not undergone the full complement of studies required
for the approval process. The changes requested are not within the
scope of this rulemaking.
    (5) The agency asked for comment with respect to a policy that
would allow or encourage sponsors to provide extralabel drug use
information, regarding significant adverse events, on product labeling.
A number of comments supported the inclusion of information on
significant adverse events related to extralabel use on a drug's
labeling. The agency is continuing to explore its legal and policy
options in this regard and will consider these comments during that
process. Several related comments suggested that FDA should provide
more publicity on the need to report adverse reactions related to
extralabel use, through the existing reporting procedures for reporting
adverse drug events. FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has
developed and distributed widely a brochure which answers a number of
frequently asked questions about CVM's adverse drug experience (ADE)
reporting system. The brochure specifically addresses reporting of
extralabel use-associated ADE's. CVM will take other similar proactive
measures as resources permit.
2. General Comments
    (6) One comment suggested that although CPG 7125.06 makes a
distinction between extralabel drug use in food animals versus
companion animals, the proposed regulations do not appear to make this
distinction. The agency believes that the regulations clearly
distinguish between the extra-label requirements for food-producing
animals and companion animals, and that the differences are extensive;
that is part 530, subpart C contains detailed and specific provisions
relating to extralabel drug use in animals intended to provide human
food. On the other hand, part 530, subpart D provides minimal
conditions related to extralabel drug use in animals not intended for
human consumption.
    (7) One comment suggested that target animal safety should be an
important consideration when prescribing extralabel use of a drug. The
comment suggested that the target animal safety profile of a drug
should be established so that the animal being treated is not unduly
exposed to risk. While considerations of target animal safety are not
specifically addressed in the AMDUCA, as is food safety, the agency
believes that the veterinarian is responsible for exercising
professional judgment regarding animal safety in prescribing extralabel
drug use. For that reason, both the CPG and the final rule require a
valid veterinary-client-patient relationship to ensure that animal
safety is properly taken into consideration. Therefore, the agency has
not conditioned extralabel drug use on the establishment of a safety
profile for the target animal.
    (8) Several comments questioned FDA's conclusion that the AMDUCA
does not permit the agency to restrict use of a human drug in nonfood
animals even though an approved NAD may exist for the same uses. One
comment pointed out that the agency found authority in the act to
require use of an approved NAD in a food-producing animal before use of
a human drug is permitted, and the comment argued that the agency could
use the same authority to provide a similar restriction for drug use in
nonfood animals. The comment stated that it would be prudent for FDA to
do so to protect the safety of the target animal, because an approved
NAD will bear labeling for the safe use of the NAD in the target
animal, while a human drug will not have such labeling. Several
comments noted that restricting use of a human drug in nonfood animals
will maintain an important incentive for animal drug sponsors to pursue
such approvals, especially in minor species. One comment stated that
FDA's economic impact analysis does not consider the impact on small
animal drug companies of allowing use of human drugs when approved
animal drugs are available.
    As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, the AMDUCA's human
drug provisions do not contain an express provision similar to the one
that requires use of an approved animal drug as a prerequisite to
extralabel use of another approved animal drug. The agency reiterates
its belief that because of the broad public health implications in the
treatment of food animals, it is prudent to require the use of an
approved NAD if one exists. Because such broad public health
implications do not apply to nonfood animals, the agency does not
believe the statute supports a similar restriction for nonfood animals.
    With regard to the comment concerning the economic impact analysis,
the requirement that the agency analyze a proposal's economic impacts
on small businesses is intended to disclose the economic burden that
would be imposed on small business by the imposition of a new
government regulation. Because FDA's analysis of the rule's impacts
concludes with a certification that it will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, no further
analysis is required.
    (9) One comment, from AHI, advocated that FDA vigorously enforce
the new regulations. A number of other comments, mostly from
veterinarians' groups, indicated that enforcement against extralabel
drug use should be minimal. A number of comments asked how specific
provisions of the regulations would be enforced.
    The agency expects that its enforcement activities related to
extralabel use outside the scope of the statute will continue at
approximately the same level as actions under the CPG's in the past. As
in the past, the agency expects to identify areas for highest priority
enforcement attention, such as prohibited uses and situations in which
violative drug residue occurs in human food. Enforcement instructions
to FDA's field offices will be available as they are developed in the
future.
    (10) A number of State and university wildlife departments asked
that use of drugs in free-ranging wildlife be exempted from the AMDUCA
(i.e., be allowed unrestricted extralabel use) because free-ranging
feral animals are not generally classified as food animals, and because
it is generally impractical to maintain the veterinary-client-patient
relationship provided for in the regulation. Several comments also
asked that wildlife biologists be allowed to make extralabel uses
because veterinarians are not always available.
    The agency understands that some free-ranging wildlife may be
harvested for human food, and therefore they are considered to be food
animals. Accordingly, extralabel drug use in such animals must be in
conformity with the provisions of the regulation applicable to food
animals. In addition, the agency believes that the timing of extralabel
drug use should take into consideration periods of harvest (e.g.,
hunting seasons). The provisions of the regulation related to nonfood
animals would apply to free-ranging wildlife that are not harvested for
human food. The agency recognizes the unique applicability of the
veterinary-client-patient relationship to free-ranging wildlife. The
agency believes that Congress intended that veterinarians be
responsible for overseeing the extralabel use of drugs. However, the
agency also recognizes the significant role of wildlife biologists,
typically State or Federal employees, in administering drugs to free-
ranging wildlife under the general supervision of a veterinarian

[[Page 57736]]

who may also be a government employee and intends that such situations
fall within the scope of a valid veterinary-client-patient
relationship. In view of the above, the agency believes that changes to
the regulations are not necessary.
    (11) One comment requested confirmation from the agency that it
will not delay approvals or withdraw approvals of existing NADA's, if
analytical methods are not developed for detection of extralabel use.
It is not the intention of the agency to delay approval of a NADA, or
take action to withdraw an approved NADA, if such methods are not
developed. The agency notes, however, that section 512(e)(1) of the
act, as amended by the AMDUCA, provides for withdrawal of an approval
of a drug as unsafe under the condition of extralabel use as authorized
under section 512(a)(4)(A).
    (12) One comment questioned the economic assessment on two bases:
(1) Whether the costs of method development included the cost of method
validation, and (2) whether the assessment included the cost of
developing toxicology data in order to establish a safe level. Methods
validation costs, which would range from $20,000 to $40,000 for each
trial, were not included in the cost estimates in the proposal's
economic assessment. Thus, the total cost for developing a method would
range from $110,000 to $390,000, with an intermediate level of about
$200,000 for each study. Assuming that two methods would be developed
during an average year, and that one method would require a metabolism
study costing $100,000, the annual cost impact would be $500,000 rather
than $440,000 as estimated in the proposal. This comparatively small
increase in estimated costs does not materially affect the conclusions
of the economic assessment under Executive Order 12866 and the
Regulatory Flexibility Act. The agency does not expect to require the
development of new toxicology data in order to establish a safe level,
but may rely on available data for that purpose.
    (13) One comment suggested that one means of reducing the risks to
public health attributed to extralabel use of drugs in animals is for
the agency to proactively determine, through use of a prioritized list,
the extralabel use of drugs that may cause a higher risk. The comment
suggested that the regulations contain provisions for developing
methods, conducting tissue residue studies, and assessing toxicity of
those drugs considered most likely to present public health concerns.
    FDA agrees with this comment, and believes that the AMDUCA and the
final regulations essentially conform to the comment's request. The
agency will continuously evaluate information relating to extralabel
uses. If FDA should have concerns regarding a particular extralabel use
(i.e., if the agency finds that there is ``a reasonable probability
that a drug's use may present a risk''), the agency may establish a
safe residue level or require the development of a practical analytical
method. This decision would be reached by assessing toxicity data,
among other information. Similarly, FDA may take additional actions if
the agency finds that an extralabel use ``may present a risk'' or
``presents a risk.'' The effect of this procedure would be to establish
FDA's ``priority list,'' as requested in the comment. Accordingly, the
agency believes that it is unnecessary to revise the regulations.
    (14) Comments from several organizations and individuals stated
strong concern about the implications of extralabel use for the
development and transfer of antimicrobial resistance. In general, the
comments asserted that extralabel use in food animals can increase risk
of drug resistance to human pathogens because studies show that
antimicrobial resistance can be transmitted to humans through
consumption of animal products and through contact with livestock;
extralabel uses of drugs in food and water (``environmental uses'')
should be prohibited; extralabel use of fluoroquinolines and
glycopeptides (such as vancomycin) should be prohibited; and
antimicrobials approved only for use in humans should not be permitted
for extralabel use in food animals. One comment also suggested
prohibiting herd or flock treatment, when only a few animals exhibit
symptoms.
    Specifically, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
stated that the proposed rule does not provide adequate public health
safeguards to prevent the emergence of antimicrobial resistance to
agents that are important in human medicine. CDC stated that the use of
antimicrobial agents in animals presents a risk to the public health as
defined in the proposed rule, and noted that the proposed rule does not
address the hazard caused by use of antimicrobials at low doses and for
prolonged periods. CDC proposed that the extralabel use of
antimicrobials be based on the results of culture and sensitivity
testing, and that more stringent criteria should be applied to the
extralabel use of antimicrobial drugs that are approved only for human
use including approval for such use only on a compassionate basis. CDC
also commended CVM for its commitment to safeguards for the prevention
of increased antimicrobial resistance including CVM's establishment and
continued sponsorship of the collaborative FDA, CDC, and U.S.
Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) National Antimicrobial Resistance
Monitoring System.
    The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) stated that
CVM has acknowledged that bacteria resistant to fluoroquinolones could
emerge even in therapeutic uses of the drugs, that cross-resistance
occurs in the drugs, and that extralabel use of fluoroquinolones will
be restricted. CSPI also recommended that subtherapeutic extralabel use
be prohibited in aquaculture. The current chair of FDA's Anti-Infective
Drugs Advisory Committee and of the Antimicrobial Use and Clinical
Trials Committee for Infectious Disease Society of America commented
that recent presentations have suggested that less drug usage can
result in a reduction of resistance. That comment, and several others,
referred to general recommendations that have been made to the medical
profession for prudent use of antimicrobials to reduce resistance.
    The agency has spent many years studying the effect of
antimicrobial drug use in animals on the selection of resistant
bacteria and acknowledges the concerns expressed for the public health.
The agency believes that several factors will provide the basis to
adequately safeguard the public health: (1) Responsible therapeutic
drug use by veterinarians, as described in this regulation; (2)
provisions for adequate recordkeeping, including the requirement for
specifying dose and duration of treatment; and (3) resistance
monitoring efforts. FDA, CDC, and USDA have implemented a national
surveillance program to monitor changes in antimicrobial
susceptibilities of zoonotic pathogens from human and animal clinical
specimens, from healthy farm animals, and from carcasses of food-
producing animals at slaughter plants. This has been done in response
to recommendations from a 1994 joint FDA advisory committee meeting
regarding fluoroquinolones as well as a 1995 American Society for
Microbiology Task Force on Antibiotic Resistance. The monitoring system
will provide descriptive data on the extent and temporal trends of
antimicrobial susceptibility in Salmonella from the human and animal
populations. The goals are to use the information in a timely way to:
(1) Guide veterinarians

[[Page 57737]]

and physicians; (2) prolong the lifespan of drugs that are approved;
(3) facilitate the identification of resistance in either population as
they arise; and (4) identify areas for more detailed investigation by
the appropriate group. Moreover, the monitoring system will provide
direction to initiate studies designed to answer some of the more
vexing scientific questions regarding the resistance issue. The early
identification of emerging resistance will allow agencies to focus
educational efforts in the human and veterinary medical communities on
the appropriate use of antimicrobial agents.
    The agency believes that the selection of resistant human pathogens
could be a basis for restricting extralabel drug use provided that
these organisms can be shown to present a risk to the public health.
The agency will allow extralabel use of drugs administered in drinking
water only for therapeutic purposes, and information on resistance will
be evaluated in relation to individual drugs and classes of drugs that
might be administered by this means. Subtherapeutic use of drugs in
animals is typically accomplished by adding drugs to feed at a low dose
and over a long-term period. Such uses are ordinarily for
nontherapeutic or production purposes. As explained elsewhere
extralabel use of drugs in feeds and for production purposes are not
allowed under the AMDUCA. Therefore, this should not be a factor in any
resistance issues arising from extralabel drug use.
    The agency has decided to initiate the process specified by the
AMDUCA to prohibit extralabel use of approved fluroquinolones and
glyecopeptides, for animal or human use, in food producing animals. An
order to this effect will be published in the Federal Register, in the
near future. The agency does not have information that meets the
statutory requirement (that such extralabel use presents a risk to the
public health) for across-the-board prohibition of the extralabel use
of antimicrobial drugs that are approved only for use in humans. The
agency has not determined what, if any, authority it has to require
sensitivity testing but the agency believes that such testing is part
of the responsible practice of veterinary medicine. Finally, as to
treatments of groups of animals when only a few are sick, the agency
believes that this is not likely to occur because of cost
considerations.
    (15) One comment suggested that the agency needs to expand the
scope of the regulations to include environmental concerns, and animal
health and well-being, as well as human health. The agency agrees that
environmental and animal well-being are included in the term ``public
health,'' and intends to interpret the term broadly in making
determinations under this regulation. Of course, consistent with the
language of the AMDUCA and the underlying purposes of the act, the
major public health consideration is human health.
    (16) One comment requested that extralabel drug use criteria and
precautions address environmental safety questions. The agency believes
that veterinarians should take environmental impacts into account when
they make an extralabel use of an animal drug. They are expected to
comply with any applicable Federal or local requirements, and to report
environmental problems to CVM through the ADE reporting system.
    (17) One comment suggested that the regulations be modified to
suggest that good management practice, preventative health management
plans, and quality assurance programs be used to minimize the need for
extralabel (and routine) drug use in livestock systems. The agency
agrees that these are important steps in minimizing risk to the public
associated with extralabel drug use in food animals. However, the
agency does not believe the regulations need to be modified because
these measures are part of normal veterinary and animal management
practices.
3. Comments on Specific Sections
    a. Scope (Sec. 530.1)
    (18) One comment, apparently assuming that the regulations apply
only to OTC drugs and expressing concern about illegal OTC sale of
prescription drugs directly to farmers, suggested that the regulations
should apply to veterinary prescription drugs. The agency confirms that
the regulations apply to all approved drugs, whether prescription or
OTC. OTC sale of prescription drugs is illegal under the act, and that
status is not changed in any way by the enactment of the AMDUCA or the
publication of this regulation.
    b. Purpose (Sec. 530.2)
    (19) One comment suggested that the proposed regulation's stated
purpose did not adequately recognize the importance of minimizing
animal pain and suffering in permitting extra-label use. The agency
considers the clause ``when the health of animals is threatened,'' in
Sec. 530.2, to include the concept of minimizing animal pain and
suffering.
    c. Definitions (Sec. 530.3)
    (20) One comment stated that the regulations do not define the term
``food producing animal,'' and asked if this term would include species
that are used for food in other countries but not in the United States.
As an example the comments cited horses that are to be exported from
the United States for food. Another comment suggested that the
definition of food-producing animals should not include food-producing
animals that are in early life stages. Another comment stated that
dairy heifer calves should be considered nonfood, since they will not
be used to produce food (milk) for 2 years. The agency has not defined
the term ``food-producing animal'' in the regulation because its
meaning (i.e., those animals that are intended to provide food for
human consumption) is the same for purposes of this rule as it is for
any other purpose under the act. Thus, horses may be food or nonfood
animals, depending on their intended use. If they are intended to be
exported for human consumption, they would be considered to be food-
producing animals. Further, the agency does not ordinarily distinguish
food-producing from nonfood-producing animals based on life-stages or
production classes.
    (21) One comment suggested that the term ``drug sponsor'' be
defined. The terms ``drug sponsor'' and ``sponsor'' are used to refer
to the person who holds the approved NADA. We have not provided a
definition of ``drug sponsor'' or ``sponsor'' in Sec. 530.3, because
these terms are not used in the regulations in new part 530.
    (22) A number of comments requested clarification of the phrase
``adverse event'' as used in the definitions of risk to the public
health (Sec. 530.3(c), (d), and (e)). One comment suggested defining
the term in relation to the preservation of animal health, while
recognizing any science-based risk to the public health. One comment
suggested that the term ``adverse event'' be replaced by ``adverse
public health event.'' Another comment suggested that the
interpretation of ``adverse event'' was too narrow when confined to
those events currently considered reportable adverse drug reactions
required by 21 CFR 510.300 and 510.301. The agency's use of the phrase
``adverse events'' in these sections is related to the public health.
As explained above, the agency intends to interpret the term ``public
health'' to include animal and environmental safety in addition to
human health. The agency did not intend for the term ``adverse event''
to be interpreted as related only to animal ``adverse drug reactions.''
In fact, the primary focus will be on human health.
    (23) One comment concluded that the description of the agency's
means of determining risk as defined in

[[Page 57738]]

Sec. 530.3(c), (d), and (e) suggested that one agency's employee would
make this decision or recommendation. The comment suggested that the
agency involve FDA's Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee (VMAC) in
making risk determinations. Several comments proposed that the agency
have defined and open processes for determining whether the statutory
criteria are met. Many comments requested that the definition of these
terms incorporate the concept that the determinations would be based on
documented or reliable scientific information. Several comments
suggested that the thresholds be more rigorous, e.g., ``may be likely
to cause,'' ``may cause,'' and ``has a direct causative link'' to an
adverse public health consequence, respectively, for Sec. 530.3(c),
(d), and (e). Several comments insisted that FDA was applying a double
standard, i.e., by holding veterinarians to strict scientific
requirements (see Sec. 530.20) while requiring only minimal scientific
information in making the threshold findings.
    It was not the intention of the agency to suggest that decisions
would be made by an FDA employee. Any decision regarding the risk to
the public health would be an agency decision made by the appropriate
agency official acting under the authority of Secretary as delegated or
redelegated under the act.
    FDA will consider seeking advice from VMAC, as appropriate, on
issues relating to the implementation of the AMDUCA. As explained
elsewhere in the preamble, and as reflected in the regulations, the
agency will use defined processes, provide opportunity for public
comment, and provide for public information on its risk determinations.
FDA believes that the risk determinations, especially the determination
that leads to prohibition of a particular extralabel use, typically
will involve documented scientific information. However, the agency
believes that it is not limited to making risk determinations based
solely on documented scientific information, but may use other suitable
information as appropriate. Finally, the agency believes that its
interpretations of the statutory criteria in Sec. 530.3(c), (d), and
(e) are consistent with the plain meaning of the words, past agency
interpretations of similar words, and the overall congressional
purpose, and therefore has not adopted the suggested changes to
Sec. 530.3(c), (d), and (e).
    With regard to the ``double standard'' comment, the agency believes
that both the requirements for threshold determinations and those for
veterinarian use of extralabel drugs in food animals are consistent
with the AMDUCA and the agency's responsibility to protect the public
health.
    (24) Some comments sought clarification of the term ``safe level.''
For example, one comment asked for clarification of the third sentence
in proposed Sec. 530.3(g), which distinguishes ``safe level'' from
other concepts such as ``safe concentration'' and ``tolerance.'' The
latter two terms are applied to approved drugs. A ``safe level'' within
the meaning of the AMDUCA is one that presents essentially no human
food safety concern.
    (25) Several comments suggested adding the word ``edible'' before
``animal tissues'' in the first sentence of Sec. 530.3(g). The agency
agrees, and it has made the change.
    (26) Many comments suggested that the definition provided in
proposed Sec. 530.3(h) for ``veterinarian'' and ``veterinary-client-
patient relationship'' was adequate for individual practitioners, but
needed to be amended to provide for group practices, in which several
veterinarians may provide for the veterinary needs of an individual
client or patient. The agency agrees with this comment, and it will
interpret the regulation accordingly.
    (27) Comments stated that graduation from an accredited institution
should not be a prerequisite for a veterinarian to make extralabel
uses, as stated in the preamble. The agency agrees, but no change is
required in the regulation because the regulation did not state an
accreditation requirement.
    (28) One comment suggested that the veterinarian is responsible for
determining the appropriate timeliness of visits, a concept that is
included in the definition of veterinary-client-patient relationship in
Sec. 530.3(h). The agency agrees that timeliness is ordinarily
determined by generally accepted standards of veterinary medicine
practice, and it has not specified a timeliness standard in the
regulation.
    d. Advertising and promotion (Sec. 530.4)
    (29) Several comments suggested that the section of the regulation
prohibiting advertising and promotion of extralabel uses, Sec. 530.4,
be modified to permit the mere listing of human labeled drug products
in price sheets and catalogs that are distributed to veterinarians. The
agency agrees that this practice is acceptable because we do not
consider mere listing of human labeled drug products in price sheets
and catalogs distributed to veterinarians to be advertising and
promotion of extralabel use. However, the agency does not believe that
it is necessary to modify the regulation as suggested.
    e. Records (Sec. 530.5)
    (30) Approximately two dozen organizations and individuals
expressed objection to one or more provisions of the section related to
recordkeeping and access to records. Only one comment favored the
provision. The comment suggested a uniform Federal requirement and
additional records besides those specified in the regulations,
including dates of administration and use of a form specified by FDA.
Generally, the comments characterized the requirement as confusing,
excessive, and burdensome. The comments stated that notwithstanding
FDA's preamble statement to the contrary, States do not uniformly
require the records listed in the proposed regulation; in fact, the
comments asserted, some States have no recordkeeping requirements at
all. Several comments said, in contrast, that veterinarians keep and
are encouraged to keep adequate records in accordance with generally
accepted standards of practice and AVMA Guidelines for Prescription
Drugs. The comments also stated that FDA should not mandate
recordkeeping; the agency should specify the records that are directly
related to extralabel use and access should be limited to those
records; inspection should be preceded by procedural restrictions
(e.g., an open process for determining when the statutory threshold of
``may present a risk to the public health'' is met, along with evidence
that a particular veterinarian is engaged in the extralabel use in
question before records are requested); and client confidentiality
should be respected under State confidentiality laws. In addition,
comments questioned FDA's use of the records as an enforcement tool.
    FDA acknowledges that the comments are correct in their assertion
that not all States require the records listed in the proposed
regulation. The agency wishes to clarify the main purpose of records
inspection, that is, to ascertain the extent and nature of an
extralabel use that the agency has determined may present a risk to the
public health information gathered in the inspection may lead to
prohibition of the particular extralabel use. The main purpose of the
inspection, therefore, is not enforcement of these regulations as
apparently understood by the comments. The agency believes that most
veterinarians keep records that would be adequate for FDA's
information-gathering purposes, whether by State law or standard
veterinary practice. Such records would

[[Page 57739]]

include identification of the drug, condition treated, species, dosage,
duration, number of animals treated, and withdrawal time. However, the
agency has concluded that it should specify minimal recordkeeping
requirements in order to accomplish the purposes of the act. Congress
has clearly provided authority for such requirement.
    The agency emphasizes that the requirement to keep the records
applies only to extralabel uses, and the records access provisions
apply only after the agency has determined that a particular use may
present a risk to the public health. As discussed in response to the
next comment, the agency will give public notice of such
determinations.
    The agency will consider a system using notification and
appointments when it develops its procedures for records inspections.
The agency's personnel who collect and review records will be
instructed to protect client confidentiality. As suggested by one
comment, veterinarians will be allowed to copy or reformulate records
to provide inspectors with only information required by the
regulations.
    The regulation has been modified in accordance with this
discussion.
    (31) A number of comments suggested that FDA give public
notification of a ``determination'' that an extralabel use in animals
``may present a risk to the public health,'' and that such notice be
provided prior to initiating record inspections related to the
particular use. The agency will provide informal public notification
(e.g., articles or notices in the CVM Update or on the CVM Homepage
(http://www.cvm.fda.gov) on the Internet World Wide Web) when it has
determined that a particular use ``may present a risk to the public
health.'' It is likely that in most cases, this informal public
notification will be prior to FDA initiating inspections of
veterinarian records related to a particular use.
    f. Feed use drugs (Sec. 530.11(b))
    (32) Several comments addressed the provision of the AMDUCA
(Section 4(a)) and the regulation, Sec. 530.11(b), that prohibits
extralabel use of a drug ``in or on an animal feed.'' The American Feed
Industry Association commented that the proposed regulation is correct,
that it would clearly prohibit--without limitation or exception--the
extralabel use of drugs administered in or on feed. The National Grain
and Feed Association strongly supported the prohibition. Comments from
organizations representing aquaculture, pheasant growers, and wildlife
interests requested exceptions for their species. These groups
contended, for example, that extralabel uses should be permitted of
medicated feeds that are properly formulated and labeled in accordance
with regulations. Several groups suggested that there should be
exceptions for use of feed to administer drugs to individual animals.
    FDA believes that the act as amended by the AMDUCA does not allow
extralabel use of a feed use drug (Type A article) in medicated feed or
an extralabel use of the medicated feed. As stated earlier, the agency
anticipates examining extralabel use which is outside the scope of
AMDUCA in the context of determining regulatory priorities. In this
regard, the agency notes that in the past, as a matter of enforcement
discretion, the agency generally has not objected to mixing a drug with
an individual animal's feed, and does not expect to change its
regulatory priorities in this regard.
    g. Labeling (Sec. 530.12)
    (33) One comment sought clarification of the agency's intention, as
stated in the preamble discussion of Sec. 530.12, to allow labeling of
case quantities of drugs. The agency believes case-labeling is
appropriate when large numbers of animals need to be treated in an
extralabel manner for a short period (e.g., feedlot use).
    (34) Several comments objected to the provision in Sec. 530.12(c),
which requires that labeling identify ``the animal'' in which the drug
is to be used. The comments proposed that the regulation allow for
identification of a group of animals, i.e., a herd, where appropriate.
Suggestions included requiring pen number, pasture, lot number, or
other defining characteristic. The agency agrees, and it has modified
the regulation accordingly.
    (35) One comment suggested that the labeling requirements in
Sec. 530.12(a) be modified to allow the labeling to display either the
name and address of the veterinarian, or the name of the veterinarian
and the name and address of the dispensing pharmacy. The comment stated
that most State pharmacy acts require the name and address of the
pharmacy to appear on the labeling, while the pharmacy keeps the
address of the veterinarian in its files. The comment stated that in
many cases, the label is too small to include both addresses. The
agency agrees, and it has modified the regulation accordingly.
    h. Compounding (Sec. 530.13)
    (36) One comment suggested that rules implementing the AMDUCA
should not include regulations regarding compounding. The comment
suggested that the regulation merely state that the AMDUCA does not
authorize compounding from bulk drugs or unapproved drugs, and refer to
separate guidance on compounding. Compounding for use in food animals
raises unique concerns with respect to drug residues. The detailed
regulations for extralabel use of finished products, while generally
applicable to compounding, do not fully address these unique concerns.
    Therefore, the agency believes that regulations specific to
compounding allowed as a result of the AMDUCA are necessary.
    (37) In contrast, several comments requested that CPG 608.400,
``Compounding of Drugs for use in Animals,'' be issued under notice and
comment procedures so that the entire content of CPG would be made part
of the regulations. CPG's, which set out FDA's regulatory priorities
are intended to provide information and guidance. Because such policies
are discretionary, they are not binding either on the agency or the
public and can be changed from time to time. Notice and comment
rulemaking and resulting regulations, on the other hand, establish
policies which have the force and effect of law. Therefore, the use of
such procedures is not appropriate for CPG's. The agency notes that it
followed its usual practice and published a Federal Register notice
that announced the availability of the CPG (61 FR 34849, July 3, 1996)
which included the entire text of the CPG and specifically provided
opportunity for comment.
    (38) One comment suggested that all cutaneously administered
compounds (e.g., foot bath preparations) be exempted from the
compounding restrictions. The agency believes that the comment may
refer to the use for compounding of drug products that have not been
approved. Because the AMDUCA applies only to approved drugs, the agency
does not have authority in its implementing regulations to exempt
extralabel use, including compounding, of unapproved drugs. If the
comment intended to address compounding from approved drugs for a
specific use (i.e., cutaneous administration), such compounding must be
consistent with these final rules. As stated above, further detailed
guidance for compounding is provided in its compounding CPG.
    (39) One comment recommended that Sec. 530.13 be modified to be
consistent with Sec. 530.20 to state that, if available, an approved
animal drug must be utilized for compounding before using a human drug
for compounding. The agency agrees, and it has made the appropriate
modification of Sec. 530.13. To be consistent with Sec. 530.30,
however,

[[Page 57740]]

the restriction will apply only to drugs compounded for use in food
animals.
    (40) One comment suggested that the recently issued CPG on
compounding contradicts the second sentence in Sec. 530.13(a), and that
this sentence should be deleted. The sentence states that the
regulations shall not be construed as permitting compounding from bulk
drugs. On the other hand, the CPG states that the agency will generally
exercise enforcement discretion in very limited circumstances with
regard to compounding from bulk substances. The comment suggests a
misunderstanding of the difference in scope and purpose between the
AMDUCA and its implementing regulations, and the compounding CPG. The
AMDUCA applies only to approved products, therefore, compounding from
bulk drugs could not be permitted under the AMDUCA regulations.
However, limited compounding from bulk substances may be subject to
FDA's enforcement discretion as expressed in the CPG. Thus, the second
sentence in Sec. 530.13(a) is not in conflict with the CPG.
    i. Conditions for extralabel use in food animals (Sec. 530.20)
    (41) One comment suggested it would be appropriate to add language
to Sec. 530.20 to state that an animal owner administering an
extralabel drug under a valid veterinary-client-patient relationship
shall be responsible for maintaining animal identification and
observing the established withdrawal periods. The agency agrees that
the animal owner as well as the veterinarian has responsibility to
assure that steps are taken to avoid the occurrence of unsafe drug
residues. However, the agency does not believe that the regulations
need to be amended to state the animal owner's responsibility because
the responsibility is emphasized elsewhere, e.g., in CPG 615.200,
Proper Drug Use and Residue Avoidance by Non-Veterinarians.
    (42) Comments suggested that Sec. 530.20(a) should be revised by
deleting the words ``and human drugs'' at the end of the sentence. The
comments asserted that the deletion would provide for compliance with
the specific language in the AMDUCA, and would conform to the language
contained in the CPG 7125.35. The agency disagrees with the suggestion,
which would mean that safeguards that would be applied to extralabel
use of animal drugs in food animals would not be applied when human
drugs are used in food animals. The agency believes that Congress did
not intend a lesser standard of protection for the public when human
drugs are used in food animals, and that the AMDUCA provides the
necessary authority to apply the standards to use of human drugs.
    (43) Approximately two dozen organizations and individuals
commented on the provisions in Sec. 530.20(b) that would require
veterinarians to: (1) Document the medical rationale for use of a human
or nonfood animal drug in food animals, and (2) if there is no
published scientific information on the public health implications,
determine that the animal and its food products will not enter the
human food supply. A large number of comments opposed these provisions.
Comments stated that the provisions would essentially preclude
extralabel use in food animals and exotic animals; that the provisions
are inconsistent with standards elsewhere in the regulation (e.g.,
``reasonable probability of risk''); and that there is no serious drug
residue problem (related to extralabel use by veterinarians) to be
solved. Specifically, the comments stated that: (1) The requirement for
published scientific information would exclude extralabel use of some
60 therapeutic agents, now permitted by the CPG's; (2) the regulation's
requirement for published scientific information is unclear; (3) the
regulation places unreasonable responsibility on the veterinarian, and
it may result in substandard care for food animals; and (4) the
regulation contradicts the agency's past position that there are no
nonfood food animals. Most of those commenting suggested deleting these
provisions from the regulation. Several suggested that the scientific
information should be specified to include pharmacokinetic and
toxicological information and data from sources such as the Food Animal
Residue Avoidance Database, sponsors, etc. in addition to peer reviewed
journals. One comment suggested that the restriction on food animal use
should apply only if there is scientific information that identifies a
problem. Several suggested that the regulation should require a 6
months withdrawal period, instead of permanent prohibition from food
use.
    The agency is primarily concerned that the veterinarian have a
scientific basis for an extralabel use, and is especially concerned
where the veterinarian is using in a food animal a drug that is not
approved for food animal use. The agency notes that the human drug CPG
contains several restrictions in addition to those contained in the
animal drug CPG, and that the human drug CPG states that use of human
drugs in food animals is expected to be rare. Thus, the agency believes
that there is not only a rational basis but also precedential policy
that applies to the provisions of Sec. 530.20(b).
    The agency believes that the rationale for restricting use of human
drugs in food animals applies as well to use in food animals of drugs
approved only for nonfood animals. Such drugs often contain the same
active ingredients as approved human drugs. Thus, the agency expects
the veterinarian to have scientific information on which to base such
use, but has deleted the requirement that the data be ``published.''
Essentially, the agency expects that the veterinarian will have a
scientific basis for using in food animals a drug that is not approved
in any food animal, but that scientific information could be derived
from a variety of sources, and that the veterinarian's rationale will
be recorded in appropriate records. Accordingly, the agency has
retained in Sec. 530.20(b)(1) of the final rule the requirement for a
medical rationale (i.e., a rational basis for using the drug), but has
removed from the regulation the proposed requirement for documentation.
    With respect to the veterinarian's responsibility for keeping
animals out of the food supply, the agency believes that this
obligation can be met by informing the client of the client's
responsibility not to allow an animal to enter the human food supply.
The agency has revised the regulation accordingly.
    With the changes described above, FDA believes that the AMDUCA
regulation will not preclude the use of approved drugs that previously
have been available for extralabel use. Nor does the regulation
contradict the agency's general policy that certain classes of animals
are food animals regardless of circumstances.
    (44) One comment suggested that the requirement in Sec. 530.20(c)
for a veterinarian to ``consider'' the extralabel drug be clarified to
state that a veterinarian must utilize an animal drug, if one is
available to treat the condition. The agency agrees and has revised the
language accordingly. The agency has also deleted the requirement for
documenting consideration of an approved animal drug (Sec. 530.20(c)).
In these cases, however, a veterinarian will be expected to be able,
upon request, to explain and support the use of a human drug or nonfood
animal drug in food animals.
    j. Prohibitions for food animals (Sec. 530.21)
    (45) A few comments suggested that Sec. 530.21(a), (a)(2), and (b)
be modified by adding the term ``extralabel'' prior to the word ``use''
to clarify the prohibition

[[Page 57741]]

is for the ``extralabel use''' of a drug. The agency agrees, and it has
made the appropriate changes.
    (46) One comment asked who would be responsible for conducting and
paying for the development of analytical methodology for drug residue
detection. The comment suggested that this research could be done by
USDA and a public master file established as is presently done for
minor species claims. The AMDUCA does not specify who has the
responsibility for method development. Methods may be developed under a
variety of scenarios. The drug sponsor, FDA, USDA, States, or a
consortium of interested parties are all possible participants. The
agency is willing to work in partnership with the private and public
sectors to ensure that the methods are developed when needed.
    (47) A number of comments suggested that the agency exceeded its
authority when it proposed to allow the prohibition of extralabel-label
drug use of a class of drugs. The agency disagrees. Where a class of
drugs has one or more common elements that cause a particular risk, FDA
believes the statute authorizes prohibition of the entire class of
drugs. Examples of situations where the agency has prohibited
extralabel use of a class of drugs are the sulfonamide and
nitroimidazole drug classes, which are excluded from extralabel use in
the animal drug CPG. One comment suggested that as safer new analogs of
drugs are being developed it is inappropriate to prohibit a class of
compounds. The agency agrees. If safer analogs are developed for a drug
that is in a prohibited class of drugs, the agency may amend the
prohibited list as appropriate.
    k. Safe levels and analytical methods (Sec. 530.22)
    (48) One comment expressed concern over the perception that the
agency has in the regulations developed two standards of safety
concerning human food safety in food animals, i.e., safe levels and
tolerances. The comment asserted that establishment of a safe level
without complete toxicology data implies that FDA is willing to accept
a lower standard of safety for extralabel use of drugs in food animals.
The comment recommended that safe levels should be established based on
drug metabolism and toxicology data. It also stated the criteria used
by FDA to establish human food safety for extralabel use should be made
public. The agency notes that the AMDUCA clearly directs the agency to
permit extralabel uses that have not gone through the rigors of testing
provided by the NADA process. The law directs the agency to develop
regulations that provide veterinarians the latitude to practice
veterinary medicine, while protecting public health. As specific
criteria for establishing human food safety are developed, information
relating to those criteria will be provided to the public.
    The agency has also added the words ``safe concentration'' in
addition to the word ``tolerance'' in Secs. 530.11 and 530.22. This is
because the term ``safe concentration'' is used in some instances to
describe safe levels of approved products.
    (49) Several comments questioned the appropriateness of setting a
safe level on the basis of the lowest level that can be measured by a
practical analytical method. The comments stated that this is not a
sound scientific basis for protecting the public health. The agency
notes that where a safe level cannot be established on the basis of
toxicological and other scientific information, it may require the
development of an analytical method having state-of-the-art residue
detection capability. Such methods can be used in an empirical strategy
to minimize risk, i.e., to control or limit public exposure to residues
of animal drugs for which toxicological safety information is lacking.
However, the agency will not establish a safe level on this basis
unless it has concluded that the lowest level of measurement
sufficiently protects the public health. All relevant scientific
information will be reviewed before doing so.
    l. Safe levels (Sec. 530.23)
    (50) A number of comments suggested that the agency modify
Sec. 530.23(a)(1) to include the basis for the agency's finding in the
notice that establishes a safe level, and that CVM should invite the
public to comment before that safe level becomes final. One comment
suggested that the procedure described in Sec. 530.22 be followed. The
agency agrees with the suggestion as to the basis for the finding, and
it has amended Sec. 530.23(a), accordingly. However, the agency
believes that it is not necessary to have additional procedural
provisions because the regulation provides an opportunity for public
comment after the safe level is established. If comments received after
the safe level is established bring new information to light, the
agency may revoke or modify the safe level as appropriate.
    m. Analytical methods (Sec. 530.24)
    (51) On its own initiative, the agency has modified proposed
Sec. 530.24 to include a specific process for issuance of an order
announcing a specific analytical method or methods for the
quantification of extralabel use drug residues above the safe levels
established under Sec. 530.22 for extralabel use of an approved human
drug or an approved animal drug. This process is the same as that in
Sec. 530.23 for setting a safe level. Under the modified procedure, the
agency will publish in the Federal Register a notice of the order,
including the name of the specific analytical method or methods and the
drug or drugs for which the method is applicable.
    n. Prohibited uses (Sec. 530.25)
    (52) One comment requested that Sec. 530.25(h) be reworded to
require FDA to publish a safe level, whenever possible, rather than
prohibit an extralabel use. The regulations do not require publication
of a safe level first because the statute provides the agency with
flexibility through use of the word ``may.'' It is FDA's intention,
however, to consider establishing a safe level prior to prohibiting a
drug's extralabel use unless the agency finds it necessary to protect
public health to prohibit the extralabel use of a drug without first
establishing a safe level.
    The agency has also inserted a provision in Sec. 530.25(b) that an
order of prohibition may be issued if the agency determines that an
analytical method cannot be established. This provision was included in
Sec. 530.21 of the proposed rule but left out of corresponding
Sec. 530.25. This would apply in situations in which the agency has
determined, based on information available to it, that development of a
practical method related to the particular extralabel use is not
technically feasible. This determination would be subject to comment
during the comment period on the prohibition order. This allows the
agency to protect the public health by eliminating the time that would
elapse if the agency were to follow the procedure specified in
Sec. 530.22 for requiring development of an analytical method, in cases
where the agency believes that an acceptable method cannot be
developed.
    The agency understands that Congress expected the agency to
prohibit those extralabel uses that were prohibited under the animal
drug CPG, without following the prohibition procedures prescribed by
the AMDUCA. For example, Senator Heflin stated, ``This bill authorizes
FDA to incorporate in its initial regulations the list of prohibited
extralabel uses of drugs specifically listed by name in the current
compliance policy guide. Any new restrictions would have to go through
the procedures established in this law prior to being prohibited.''
(140 Congressional Record S14071 (daily ed.

[[Page 57742]]

October 4, 1994).) Accordingly, Sec. 530.41 in the final regulations
includes a list prohibiting extralabel uses as specified in the CPG.
    o. Nonfood animal drugs (Sec. 530.30)
    (53) A number of comments pointed out an inconsistency between the
preamble statement (61 FR 25106 at 25111) and the regulation
(Sec. 530.30(a)) regarding extralabel uses in nonfood animals of human
drugs where an approved NAD exists. The agency notes that the
regulation is correct, but the preamble incorrectly stated that use of
human drug is not permitted if an approved NAD for such use exists,
i.e., the words ``or human drug'' were inadvertently added to the
preamble.
    (54) Many comments suggested that a new Sec. 530.30(c) be added to
read ``Extralabel use of a drug approved for human use is permitted in
nonfood-producing animals even if there is an identical approved new
animal drug.'' Although the agency agrees that this statement is
correct, the agency does not believe that the statement is necessary in
the regulation because of the broad language in Sec. 530.30(a).

III. Effective Dates

    Under section 2(d) of the AMDUCA, the amendments to the act
permitting the extralabel use of certain approved animal drugs and
approved human drugs for animals become effective upon the adoption of
final rules implementing the amendments. This final rule becomes
effective December 9, 1996.

IV. Environmental Impact

    The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action
is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a
significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an
environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is
required.

V. Analysis of Impacts

    FDA has examined the impacts of the final rule under Executive
Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354) (5
U.S.C. 601 et seq). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess
all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when
regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize
net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public
health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this final rule is consistent with
the regulatory philosophy and principles identified in the Executive
Order. In addition, the final rule is not a significant regulatory
action as defined by the Executive Order.
    Most of the requirements in this final rule have already been
implemented by regulated industry, veterinarians, and pharmacists in
response to the existing CPG's relating to extralabel drug use in
animals and the passage of the AMDUCA, FDA guidance, and industry trade
associations' recommendations, as well as the requirements of State
veterinary practice acts and as customary elements of good veterinary
medical practice.
    The actual cost to industry and the public associated with this
final rule will be quite minimal. The AMDUCA was enacted to legalize
extralabel use of certain approved new human and animal drugs in
veterinary medicine, and to provide FDA with specific regulatory tools
to assure food safety. The scant legislative history of the AMDUCA
includes evidence that the AMDUCA was intended to codify policies
similar to those in FDA's CPG's.
     FDA is likely to require the establishment of a safe drug residue
level for one to two drugs per year after the final rule becomes
effective. An analytical methodology for drug residue detection may be
required for each of these drugs. The sponsor may be willing to provide
the methodology in some cases, while in others, FDA, the sponsor, and,
perhaps, a third party, may negotiate a cooperative arrangement for
methodology development. In the proposal, FDA estimated the cost for
development of methodologies to range from about $90,000 for a drug for
which there are few problems in developing a procedure, upward to about
$350,000 for a drug which presents significant problems in methodology
development, with an additional $100,000 required for a drug metabolism
study. One comment to the proposal concerned the inclusion of the costs
of methods validation in the above costs. FDA did not include these
costs, which range from about $20,000 to $40,000 for each trial, in its
proposal. Adding the midpoint of this range to the previous estimate of
$170,000 for a drug presenting an intermediate level of difficulty, FDA
estimates methodology development costs for the final rule to be about
$200,000 for each of these drugs. The agency estimated in its proposal
that the average year would see the development of two of these
intermediate level drug methodologies, with one of those drugs
requiring a metabolism study. FDA did not receive any comments about
this estimate and retains it for use in the final rule. Thus, total
cost impacts for development of two methodologies and one metabolism
study are estimated at $500,000 per year. The agency believes that the
final rule does not impose any significant new extralabel drug use
recordkeeping requirements for sponsors or veterinarians that are not
currently required by other sections of the act or under State
veterinary practice acts, or that are not kept by veterinarians as part
of customary veterinary practice.
    The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze
regulatory options that would minimize any significant impact of a rule
on small entities. The final rule, for the most part, implements
existing FDA policy, and most of the requirements in this final rule
have already been implemented by regulated industry, veterinarians, and
pharmacists in response to the existing CPG's relating to extralabel
drug use in animals and the passage of the AMDUCA, FDA guidance, and
industry trade associations' recommendations. Further, because FDA
estimates that only two entities will incur economic impacts annually,
the agency certifies, in accordance with section 605(b) of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, that this final rule will not have a
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis is
required.

VI. Federalism

    FDA has analyzed this final rule in accordance with the principles
and criteria set forth in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that
this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to
warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment.

VII. Unfunded Mandates Act of 1995

    The Unfunded Mandates Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4) (2 U.S.C. 1532)
requires an agency to prepare a budgetary impact statement before
promulgating any rule likely to result in a Federal mandate that may
result in expenditures by State, local, and tribal governments or the
private sector of $100 million or more in any 1 year. As discussed in
the preamble, the final rule essentially reflects current agency
policies with respect to extralabel drug use in animals and imposes
minimal new Federal requirements. Because this rule will not impose a
cost of $100 million or more on any governmental entity or the private
sector, no budgetary impact statement is required.

VIII. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995

    This final rule contains information collection provisions that are
subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under
the Paperwork

[[Page 57743]]

Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520). Therefore, in accordance
with 5 CFR 1320, the title, description, and the description of
respondents of the information collection requirements are shown below
with an estimate of the annual reporting burden. Included in the
estimate is the time for reviewing instructions, gathering and
maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the
collection of information.
    Title: Extralabel Drug Use in Animals--Final Rule
    Description: This final rule provides that FDA may require the
development of an acceptable analytical method for the quantification
of residues above an established safe level. FDA estimates that it will
likely establish safe levels for one to two drugs per year if the rule
is finalized, and that an analytical methodology for drug residue
detection will be required for each of these drugs. If no method is
provided, the Secretary may prohibit the extralabel use. This
requirement may be fulfilled by any interested person. FDA believes
that the sponsor may be willing to provide the methodology in some
cases, while in others, FDA, the sponsor, and perhaps a third party may
negotiate a cooperative arrangement for method development.
    Description of Respondents: Persons, sponsors, States, or Federal
Government.

    None of the 110 comments received had an impact on the Paperwork
Reduction Act requirements. As a result, OMB has waived its option to
review the paperwork at the final rule stage. Therefore, the
information collection provisions in the final rule are approved under
OMB Control No. 0910-0325 and are effective upon publication of this
document. OMB approval expires on July 31, 1999. An agency may not
conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB
control number.

IX. Congressional Review

    This rule is not a major rule for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.,
Subtitle E of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of
1996 (Pub. L. 104-121). Agency reports on this final rule have been
submitted to Congress and the Comptroller General as required by 5
U.S.C. 801 et seq.

List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 530

    Administrative practice and procedures, Advertising, Animal drugs,
Animal feeds, Drugs, Labeling, Prescription drugs, Reporting and
recordkeeping requirements.

(21 U.S.C. 321, 331, 351, 352, 353, 355, 357, 360b, 371, 379e).

Subpart A--General Provisions

Sec. 530.1  Scope.

    This part applies to the extralabel use in an animal of any
approved new animal drug or approved new human drug by or on the lawful
order of a licensed veterinarian within the context of a valid
veterinary-client-patient relationship.

Sec. 530.2  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to establish conditions for extralabel
use or intended extralabel use in animals by or on the lawful order of
licensed veterinarians of Food and Drug Administration approved new
animal drugs and approved new human drugs. Such use is limited to
treatment modalities when the health of an animal is threatened or
suffering or death may result from failure to treat. This section
implements the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act of 1994 (the
AMDUCA) (Pub. L. 103-396).

Sec. 530.3  Definitions.

    (a) Extralabel use means actual use or intended use of a drug in an
animal in a manner that is not in accordance with the approved
labeling. This includes, but is not limited to, use in species not
listed in the labeling, use for indications (disease or other
conditions) not listed in the labeling, use at dosage levels,
frequencies, or routes of administration other than those stated in the
labeling, and deviation from the labeled withdrawal time based on these
different uses.
    (b) FDA means the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

[[Page 57744]]

    (c) The phrase a reasonable probability that a drug's use may
present a risk to the public health means that FDA has reason to
believe that use of a drug may be likely to cause a potential adverse
event.
    (d) The phrase use of a drug may present a risk to the public
health means that FDA has information that indicates that use of a drug
may cause an adverse event.
    (e) The phrase use of a drug presents a risk to the public health
means that FDA has evidence that demonstrates that the use of a drug
has caused or likely will cause an adverse event.
    (f) A residue means any compound present in edible tissues that
results from the use of a drug, and includes the drug, its metabolites,
and any other substance formed in or on food because of the drug's use.
    (g) A safe level is a conservative estimate of a drug residue level
in edible animal tissue derived from food safety data or other
scientific information. Concentrations of residues in tissue below the
safe level will not raise human food safety concerns. A safe level is
not a safe concentration or a tolerance and does not indicate that an
approval exists for the drug in that species or category of animal from
which the food is derived.
    (h) Veterinarian means a person licensed by a State or Territory to
practice veterinary medicine.
    (i) A valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship is one in
which:
    (1) A veterinarian has assumed the responsibility for making
medical judgments regarding the health of (an) animal(s) and the need
for medical treatment, and the client (the owner of the animal or
animals or other caretaker) has agreed to follow the instructions of
the veterinarian;

Subpart B--Rules and Provisions for Extralabel Uses of Drugs in Animals

Sec. 530.10  Provision permitting extralabel use of animal drugs.

    An approved new animal drug or human drug intended to be used for
an extralabel purpose in an animal is not unsafe under section 512 of
the act and is exempt from the labeling requirements of section 502(f)
of the act if such use is:
    (a) By or on the lawful written or oral order of a licensed
veterinarian within the context of a valid veterinarian-client-patient
relationship; and
    (b) In compliance with this part.

Sec. 530.11   Limitations.

    In addition to uses which do not comply with the provision set
forth in Sec. 530.10, the following specific extralabel uses are not
permitted and result in the drug being deemed unsafe within the meaning
of section 512 of the act:
    (a) Extralabel use in an animal of an approved new animal drug or
human drug by a lay person (except when under the supervision of a
licensed veterinarian);
    (b) Extralabel use of an approved new animal drug or human drug in
or on an animal feed;
    (c) Extralabel use resulting in any residue which may present a
risk to the public health; and
    (d) Extralabel use resulting in any residue above an established
safe level, safe concentration or tolerance.

Sec. 530.12  Labeling.

    Any human or animal drug prescribed and dispensed for extralabel
use by a veterinarian or dispensed by a pharmacist on the order of a
veterinarian shall bear or be accompanied by labeling information
adequate to assure the safe and proper use of the product. Such
information shall include the following:
    (a) The name and address of the prescribing veterinarian. If the
drug is dispensed by a pharmacy on the order of a veterinarian, the
labeling shall include the name of the prescribing veterinarian and the
name and address of the dispensing pharmacy, and may include the
address of the prescribing veterinarian;
    (b) The established name of the drug or, if formulated from more
than one active ingredient, the established name of each ingredient;
    (c) Any directions for use specified by the veterinarian, including
the class/species or identification of the animal or herd, flock, pen,
lot, or other group of animals being treated, in which the drug is
intended to be used; the dosage, frequency, and route of
administration; and the duration of therapy;
    (d) Any cautionary statements; and
    (e) The veterinarian's specified withdrawal, withholding, or
discard time for meat, milk, eggs, or any other food which might be
derived from the treated animal or animals.

    (6) All relevant State laws relating to the compounding of drugs
for use in animals are followed.
    (c) Guidance on the subject of compounding may be found in guidance
documents issued by FDA.

Subpart C--Specific Provisions Relating to Extralabel Use of Animal and
Human Drugs in Food-Producing Animals

Sec. 530.20   Conditions for permitted extralabel animal and human drug
use in food-producing animals.

    (a) The following conditions must be met for a permitted extralabel
use in food-producing animals of approved new animal and human drugs:
    (1) There is no approved new animal drug that is labeled for such
use and that contains the same active ingredient which is in the
required dosage form and concentration, except where a veterinarian
finds, within the context of a valid veterinarian-client-patient
relationship, that the approved new animal drug is clinically
ineffective for its intended use.
    (2) Prior to prescribing or dispensing an approved new animal or
human drug for an extralabel use in food animals, the veterinarian
must:
    (i) Make a careful diagnosis and evaluation of the conditions for
which the drug is to be used;
    (ii) Establish a substantially extended withdrawal period prior to
marketing of milk, meat, eggs, or other edible products supported by
appropriate scientific information, if applicable;
    (iii) Institute procedures to assure that the identity of the
treated animal or animals is carefully maintained; and
    (iv) Take appropriate measures to assure that assigned timeframes
for withdrawal are met and no illegal drug residues occur in any food-
producing animal subjected to extralabel treatment.
    (b) The following additional conditions must be met for a permitted
extralabel use of in food-producing animals an approved human drug, or
of an animal drug approved only for use in animals not intended for
human consumption:
    (1) Such use must be accomplished in accordance with an appropriate
medical rationale; and
    (2) If scientific information on the human food safety aspect of
the use of the drug in food-producing animals is not available, the
veterinarian must take appropriate measures to assure that the animal
and its food products will not enter the human food supply.
    (c) Extralabel use of an approved human drug in a food-producing
animal is not permitted under this part if an animal drug approved for
use in food-producing animals can be used in an extralabel manner for
the particular use.

Sec. 530.21  Prohibitions for food-producing animals.

    (a) FDA may prohibit the extralabel use of an approved new animal
or human drug or class of drugs in food-producing animals if FDA
determines that:
    (1) An acceptable analytical method needs to be established and
such method has not been established or cannot be established; or
    (2) The extralabel use of the drug or class of drugs presents a
risk to the public health.
    (b) A prohibition may be a general ban on the extralabel use of the
drug or class of drugs or may be limited to a specific species,
indication, dosage form, route of administration, or combination of
factors.

Sec. 530.22  Safe levels and analytical methods for food-producing
animals.

    (a) FDA may establish a safe level for extralabel use of an
approved human drug or an approved new animal drug when the agency
finds that there is a reasonable probability that an extralabel use may
present a risk to the public health. FDA may:
    (1) Establish a finite safe level based on residue and metabolism
information from available sources;
    (2) Establish a safe level based on the lowest level that can be
measured by a practical analytical method; or
    (3) Establish a safe level based on other appropriate scientific,
technical, or regulatory criteria.
    (b) FDA may require the development of an acceptable analytical
method for the quantification of residues above any safe level
established under this part. If FDA requires the development of such an
acceptable analytical method, the agency will publish notice of that
requirement in the Federal Register.
    (c) The extralabel use of an animal drug or human drug that results
in residues exceeding a safe level established under this part is an
unsafe use of such drug.
    (d) If the agency establishes a safe level for a particular species
or category of animals and a tolerance or safe concentration is later
established through an approval for that particular species or category
of animals, for that species or category of animals, the safe level is
superseded by the tolerance or safe concentration for that species or
category of animals.

Sec. 530.23  Procedure for setting and announcing safe levels.

    (a) FDA may issue an order establishing a safe level for a residue
of an extralabel use of an approved human drug or an approved animal
drug. The agency will publish in the Federal Register a notice of the
order. The notice will include:
    (1) A statement setting forth the agency's finding that there is a
reasonable probability that extralabel use in animals of the human drug
or animal drug may present a risk to the public health;
    (2) A statement of the basis for that finding; and
    (3) A request for public comments.
    (b) A current listing of those drugs for which a safe level for
extralabel drug use in food-producing animals has been established, the
specific safe levels, and the availability, if any, of a specific
analytical method or methods for drug residue detection will be
codified in Sec. 530.40.

Sec. 530.24   Procedure for announcing analytical methods for drug
residue quantification.

    (a) FDA may issue an order announcing a specific analytical method
or methods for the quantification of extralabel use drug residues above
the safe levels established under Sec. 530.22 for extralabel use of an
approved human drug or an approved animal drug. The agency will publish
in the Federal Register a notice of the order, including the name of
the specific analytical method or methods and the drug or drugs for
which the method is applicable.

[[Page 57746]]

    (b) Copies of analytical methods for the quantification of
extralabel use drug residues above the safe levels established under
Sec. 530.22 will be available upon request from the Communications and
Education Branch (HFV-12), Division of Program Communication and
Administrative Management, Center for Veterinary Medicine, 7500
Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855. When an analytical method for the
detection of extralabel use drug residues above the safe levels
established under Sec. 530.22 is developed, and that method is
acceptable to the agency, FDA will incorporate that method by
reference.

Sec. 530.25  Orders prohibiting extralabel uses for drugs in food-
producing animals.

    (a) FDA may issue an order prohibiting extralabel use of an
approved new animal or human drug in food-producing animals if the
agency finds, after providing an opportunity for public comment, that:
    (1) An acceptable analytical method required under Sec. 530.22 has
not been developed, submitted, and found to be acceptable by FDA or
that such method cannot be established; or
    (2) The extralabel use in animals presents a risk to the public
health.
    (b) After making a determination that the analytical method
required under Sec. 530.22 has not been developed and submitted, or
that such method cannot be established, or that an extralabel use in
animals of a particular human drug or animal drug presents a risk to
the public health, FDA will publish in the Federal Register, with a 90-
day delayed effective date, an order of prohibition for an extralabel
use of a drug in food-producing animals. Such order shall state that an
acceptable analytical method required under Sec. 530.22 has not been
developed, submitted, and found to be acceptable by FDA; that such
method cannot be established; or that the extralabel use in animals
presents a risk to the public health; and shall:
    (1) Specify the nature and extent of the order of prohibition and
the reasons for the prohibition;
    (2) Request public comments; and
    (3) Provide a period of not less than 60 days for comments.
    (c) The order of prohibition will become effective 90 days after
date of publication of the order unless FDA publishes a notice in the
Federal Register prior to that date, that revokes the order of
prohibition, modifies it, or extends the period of public comment.
    (d) The agency may publish an order of prohibition with a shorter
comment period and/or delayed effective date than specified in
paragraph (b) of this section in exceptional circumstances (e.g., where
there is immediate risk to the public health), provided that the order
of prohibition states that the comment period and/or effective date
have been abbreviated because there are exceptional circumstances, and
the order of prohibition sets forth the agency's rationale for taking
such action.
    (e) If FDA publishes a notice in the Federal Register modifying an
order of prohibition, the agency will specify in the modified order of
prohibition the nature and extent of the modified prohibition, the
reasons for it, and the agency's response to any comments on the
original order of prohibition.
    (f) A current listing of drugs prohibited for extralabel use in
animals will be codified in Sec. 530.41.
    (g) After the submission of appropriate information (i.e., adequate
data, an acceptable method, approval of a new animal drug application
for the prohibited extralabel use, or information demonstrating that
the prohibition was based on incorrect data), FDA may, by publication
of an appropriate notice in the Federal Register, remove a drug from
the list of human and animal drugs prohibited for extralabel use in
animals, or may modify a prohibition.
    (h) FDA may prohibit extralabel use of a drug in food-producing
animals without establishing a safe level.

Subpart D--Extralabel Use of Human and Animal Drugs in Animals Not
Intended for Human Consumption

Sec. 530.30  Extralabel drug use in nonfood animals.

    (a) Because extralabel use of animal and human drugs in nonfood-
producing animals does not ordinarily pose a threat to the public
health, extralabel use of animal and human drugs is permitted in
nonfood-producing animal practice except when the public health is
threatened. In addition, the provisions of Sec. 530.20(a)(1) will apply
to the use of an approved animal drug.
    (b) If FDA determines that an extralabel drug use in animals not
intended for human consumption presents a risk to the public health,
the agency may publish in the Federal Register a notice prohibiting
such use following the procedures in Sec. 530.25. The prohibited
extralabel drug use will be codified in Sec. 530.41.

Subpart E--Safe Levels for Extralabel Use of Drugs in Animals and Drugs
Prohibited From Extralabel Use in Animals

Sec. 530.40  Safe levels and availability of analytical methods.

    (a) In accordance with Sec. 530.22, the following safe levels for
extralabel use of an approved animal drug or human drug have been
established: [Reserved]
    (b) In accordance with Sec. 530.22, the following analytical
methods have been accepted by FDA: [Reserved]

Sec. 530.41  Drugs prohibited for extralabel use in animals.

    The following drugs are prohibited for extralabel animal and human
drug uses in food-producing animals:
    (a) Chloramphenicol;
    (b) Clenbuterol;
    (c) Diethylstilbestrol (DES);
    (d) Dimetridazole;
    (e) Ipronidazole;
    (f) Other nitroimidazoles;
    (g) Furazolidone (except for approved topical use);
    (h) Nitrofurazone (except for approved topical use); and
    (i) Sulfonamide drugs in lactating dairy cattle (except approved
use of sulfadimethoxine, sulfabromomethazine and
sulfaethoxypyridazine).

<B>MGA<sup> &#174  </sup>100/200 PREMIX <br>
MGA<sup> &#174  </sup>500 LIQUID PREMIX<p>
(MELENGESTROL ACETATE)</B><p>
<b>1. General Information:</b><p>
NADA Numbers:	<B>034-254</B> and <B>039-402</B><p>
Sponsor:	The Upjohn Company<br>
	Agricultural Division<br>
	Kalamazoo, MI    49001<p>
Generic Name:	Melengestrol acetate<p>
Trade Names:<p>	MGA<sup> &#174  </sup>100/200 Premix<br>
	MGA<sup> &#174  </sup>500 Liquid Premix<p>
Marketing Status: 	Over the Counter (OTC)<p>
Effect of Supplement:	This supplement provides for the removal of the
requirement for a 48-hour drug withdrawal period prior to slaughter for heifers
fed melengestrol acetate.<p>
<b>Date Stamped:</b>	06/29/94<p>
<b>2. Indications for Use:</b><br>
<b></b><br>
For increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency and suppression of
estrus (heat) in heifers fed for slaughter.<p>
<b>3. Dosage Form(s), Route(s) of Administration and Recommended Dosage:</b><p>
The dosage form is Oral (Feed). The route of administration is oral via the
feed. The recommended dosage is 0.25 to 0.5 mg melengestrol acetate per head
per day.<p>
<b>4. Effectiveness:</b><p>
This supplement for the removal of the required 48 hour withdrawal period prior
to slaughter does not affect the efficacy information contained in the current
NADAs.<p>
<b>5. Target Animal Safety:</b><p>
This supplement for the removal of the required 48 hour withdrawal period prior
to slaughter does not affect the target animal safety information contained in
the current NADAs.<p>
<b>6. Human Safety:</b><p>
A. Tolerance:<p>
The human food safety studies defining the toxicity of melengestrol acetate
(MGA) are contained in NADAs 034-254 and 039-402, and a detailed summary of
these studies has been published (Lauderdale et al., 1977. J. Toxicol. &#38 
Environ. Health 3:5-33). Based on a reevaluation of these studies, it was
determined that the endpoint of toxicological concern is hormonal activity. It
was concluded that residues of parent MGA at or below 25 ppb in edible tissues
of treated animals will not elicit a hormonal response.<p>
Therefore, a tolerance of 25 ppb is established for residues of the parent
compound, MGA, in edible tissues of treated animals. This tolerance corresponds
to the limit of sensitivity of the regulatory method. For monitoring purposes,
fat is the target tissue.<p>
B. Study to establish the withdrawal period:<p>
The following study was conducted to quantitate melengestrol acetate, at zero
time withdrawal, in fat of heifers fed melengestrol acetate at 0.5 mg/head
daily under commercial feeding conditions in the United States of America.<p>
<b>Investigator:</b>	L.F. Krzeminski<br>		The Upjohn Company<br>
Kalamazoo,MI<p>
<b>Animals: </b>A total of 259 feedlot, mixed breed beef heifers were utilized;
seven heifers<b> </b>from each of 25 commercial feedlots where melengestrol
acetate was delivered to feed via a conventional commercial supplement and
seven heifers from each of 12 commercial feedlots where melengestrol acetate
was delivered to feed via a micro-ingredient delivery machine (micro-machine).
The feedlots were located in the states of TX, OK, CO, KS, IA, SD, MO, IN, OR
and WA.<p>
<b>Route of administration: </b>Oral: melengestrol acetate was provided in feed
in a manner practiced at each feedlot. Both conventional supplements and
micromachines were utilized.<p>
<b>Dose and duration of administration: </b>Prior to initiation of the study,
cattle were fed melengestrol acetate at 0.25 to 0.45 mg/head daily during the
finishing phase consistent with the commercial practice of each feedlot. At the
initiation of the study (14 days prior to slaughter), the daily dose of
melengestrol acetate was increased to 0.5 mg/head daily, the highest approved
dose, and remained at this dose until slaughter.<p>
<b>Slaughter time:</b> Cattle were slaughtered at zero time withdrawal which
was defined as the interval from last feeding of melengestrol acetate to
slaughter. These intervals ranged from 0.5 to 27.5 hours among the 37 groups of
cattle. Of the 37 groups of cattle, 27/37 were slaughtered at less than 10
hours after last feeding, 8/37 were slaughtered between 11 and 16 hours after
last feeding and 2/37 were slaughtered at 18 and 27.5 hours after last
feeding.<p>
<b>Tissue residues: </b>At the time of slaughter approximately 1 lb. of
perirenal (kidney) fat (target tissue) was collected from each heifer,
individually packaged and shipped to The Upjohn Company for determination of
melengestrol acetate (marker residue) concentration using the procedure
described in JAOAC 59:507515: 1976. The lowest level of reliable measurement of
this procedure has been determined to be 10 ppb.<p>
All 84 samples from cattle fed melengestrol acetate delivered via a
micro-machine had residues below 10 ppb. Assay values were obtained from 174 of
175 fat samples (1 of 175 fat samples was not assayed) obtained from heifers
administered melengestrol acetate from a conventional feed supplement. Of the
174 samples 139 contained melengestrol acetate residue below 10 ppb; the
remaining 35 samples contained residues of melengestrol acetate between 10. 1
and 18.6 ppb.<p>
A statistical analysis of the data was conducted to determine the 99th
percentile with 95% confidence at 12 hours withdrawal (practical zero). The
value was found to be less than 25 ppb.<p>
<b>Conclusions: </b>This study demonstrates that cattle fed melengestrol
acetate at 0.5 mg/head daily (the highest approved dose) and slaughtered at a
zero time withdrawal have residues of melengestrol acetate in fat well below
the tolerance of 25 ppb.<p>
<B>C. Regulatory methods:</B><p>
The official AOAC method (JAOAC 59:507-515:1976), sensitive to 10 ppb, is used
as the regulatory method for tissue residues of melengestrol acetate.<p>
<b>7. Agency Conclusions:</b><p>
Under the Center's supplement approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is a
Category II change providing for the removal of the requirement for a   48-hour
withdrawal period prior to slaughter for heifers fed MGA. This supplement
evoked a re-evaluation of the toxicity data contained in NADAs 034-254 and
039-402.<p>
Adequate data were submitted for MGA which permitted the Agency to conclude
that a withdrawal period is not necessary for heifers fed MGA.<p>
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval for food producing animals does not qualify for marketing
exclusivity because the supplemental application does not contain new clinical
or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and new
human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies)
essential to the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>

for reproduction.<P> <b>Date Stamped:</b>	03/30/94<P>
<b>INDICATIONS FOR USE:</b><P> For increase rate of weight gain and
improved feed conversion.<P> <b>DOSAGE FORM(S), ROUTE(S) OF
ADMINISTRATION AND RECOMMENDED DOSAGE:</b><P> The dosage form is
implantation. The route of administration is subcutaneous
implantation on the posterior aspect of the ear by means of an
implant gun. The implant must not be placed closer to the head than
the edge of the auricular cartilage ring farthest from the head. The
recommended dosage is one implant containing 36 mg of zeranol. Each
implant is made up of three pellets with each pellet containing 12 mg
of zeranol. Each implant is contained in a separate chamber of a
multiple dose cartndge.<P> <b>EFFECTIVENESS:</b><P> This supplement
for the deletion of the caution statement against the use of
RALGRO<sup>&#174</sup> in heifer calves intended for reproduction
does not affect the efficacy information contained in the current
NADA.<P> <b>TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY:</b><P> A target animal safety study
was conducted by Drs. P.F. Arthur and M.F. Liu at the University of
Alberta, Alberta, Canada. The purpose of the study was to evaluate
the effect of RALGRO<sup>&#174</sup> implants administered to
suckling heifer calves on their subsequent reproductive performance.
Suckling heifer calves, between one and three months of age were
randomly allotted to three dose groups, 50 animals per group. Heifers
were either implanted with a single dose of RALGRO<sup>&#174</sup> on
Day 0 (RALGRO<sup>&#174 </sup> 1X Group), implanted with two doses of
RALGRO<sup>&#174,</sup> one on Day 0 and a second at weaning
(RALGRO<sup>&#174</sup> 2X Group), or were not implanted (Control
Group). At approximately 15 months of age, the heifers were placed in
pastures with bulls for a 60-day breeding season. The pregnant
heifers calved the following spring and were re-bred and checked for
pregnancy following the second breeding season.<P> The calving rate
(number of live calves born per number of animals allotted to a dose
group) for each of the three groups of heifers was 70% (Control
Group), 77% (RALGRO<sup>&#174</sup> 1X Group), and 74%
(RALGRO<sup>&#174</sup> 2X Group). One-sided lower 90% confidence
bounds on the difference in calving rates between the control and the
two treated groups demonstrate no significant adverse effect of the
RALGRO<sup>&#174</sup> treatment on calving rate in the first
breeding season. No adverse treatment effects were found for calving
difficulty (P= 0.42), birth weight (P= 0.85), and the pregnancy rate
in the second breeding season (P= 0.84). The weaning weights of
calves born to heifers treated with RALGRO<sup>&#174</sup> had
similar weaning weights (P= 0.87) to calves born to untreated
heifers.<P> <b>HUMAN SAFETY:</b><P> This supplement for the deletion
of the caution statement against the use of RALGRO<sup>&#174</sup> in
heifer calves intended for reproduction does not affect the human
safety information contained in the current NADA.<P> <b>AGENCY
CONCLUSIONS:</b><P> Adequate data were provided to demonstrate that
RALGRO<sup>&#174</sup> had no adverse effect on subsequent
reproduction when administered to heifer (suckling beef) calves after
30 days of age. Under the Center's supplement approval policy (21 CFR
514.106(b)(2)), this is a Category II change providing for the
deletion of the labeling disclaimer against the use of
RALGRO<sup>&#174</sup> in heifer (suckling beef) calves intended for
reproduction. The approval of this change is not expected to have any
adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal
drug. Accordingly, this approval did not require a re-evaluation of
the safety and effectiveness data in the parent application.<P> Under
section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act, this approval for food producing animals qualifies for three
years of marketing exclusivity beginning on the date of approval
because the supplemental application contains a report of a new
clinical investigation (other than bioequivalence or residue studies)
essential to the approval of the application and conducted or
sponsored by the applicant. The three years of marketing exclusivity
applies only to the change in the labeling (deletion of the caution
statement in the labeling against the use of RALGRO<sup>&#174</sup>
in heifer (suckling beef) calves intended for reproduction) for which
the supplemental application was approved.<P> <P> <b>LABELING:</b><P>

<h1>FDA CVM UPDATE</h1>
<b>	           FDA, Center for Veterinary Medicine</b><br>
<b> 		<i>"Helping man and animals by ensuring the availability </i></b><br>
<b><i>		of safe and effective animal health products."</i></b><P>
December 19, 1996<P>
<b>VAN LEEUWENS VIOLATE CONSENT DECREE</b><P>
On November 12, 1996 in the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of
California, a Stipulation and Order was signed by the judge and filed finding
defendants Arie, Clara, Arnold, Barry, and Jon Van Leeuwen had violated a
Consent Decree of Permanent Injunction entered by the court on October 4, 1995,
and were, therefore, liable for Civil Contempt.  <P>
The Van Leeuwens owned and operated two dairies in Modesto, California.  The
original injunction action against the Van Leeuwen Dairy was based on 16
reports of illegal drug residues in cull dairy cows offered for slaughter
during the period from January 22, 1991 through November 17, 1994.  The illegal
residues included the following drugs:  streptomycin, oxytetracycline,
penicillin, sulfamethazine, tetracycline, sulfathiazole, gentamicin,
erythromycin, and chlortetracycline.  At that time the Consent Decree
permanently restrained and enjoined Arie C. and Clara G. Van Leeuwen from
administering to cattle any article of new animal drug and introducing or
delivering for introduction into interstate commerce any article of food
consisting of cattle or their edible tissues unless and until the defendants
had established and implemented systems to control the use and administration
of drugs to their cattle to avoid illegal drug residues, including an
identification system, a written recordkeeping system, a drug inventory and
accountability system, another system which ensures that each animal had been
held for the proper withdrawal period, and a quarantine or segregation system
for medicated animals.<P>
After the Consent Decree was entered, FDA held a meeting with the Van Leeuwens
and their attorney to discuss the requirements of the Consent Decree and
conducted four inspections where the requirements were thoroughly explained to
the owners.  In spite of these efforts, the Van Leeuwens had failed to develop
and implement adequate systems and continued to sell animals for slaughter
contrary to the requirements of the Consent Decree.  The Van Leeuwens failed to
take the injunction seriously and continued to violate the law while making
promises of compliance.<P>
Under the Stipulation and Order, the defendants were ordered to comply with the
Injunction at both dairies and to permanently identify all cattle with an ear
tag and provide FDA with a list of ear tag numbers each month.  The defendants
will be fined $100 per day until they have demonstrated compliance with the
injunction, except that fine will be purged <P>
if they demonstrate compliance within 60 days of the Order.  Subsequent
violations of the injunction will result in a sanction of $1,000 for each
animal sold in violation of the injunction and $1,000 for any other violation
of the injunction.  Defendants were also ordered to pay $2,500 for costs
incurred by the Government in monitoring compliance with the injunction to
date. <hr>

<B>MGA<sup>&#174</sup>  100/200 PREMIX <br>
MGA<sup>&#174</sup>  500 LIQUID PREMIX<P>
(MELENGESTROL ACETATE)</B><P>
<b>1. General Information:</b><P>
NADA Numbers:	<B>034-254</B> and <B>039-402</B><P>
Sponsor:<P>The Upjohn Company<br>
	Agricultural Division<br>
	Kalamazoo, MI    49001<P>
Generic Name:	Melengestrol acetate<P>
Trade Names:<p>	MGA<sup>&#174 </sup> 100/200 Premix<br>
	MGA<sup>&#174 </sup> 500 Liquid Premix<P>
Marketing Status: 	Over the Counter (OTC)<P>
Effect of Supplement:	This supplement provides for the removal of the
requirement for a 48-hour drug withdrawal period prior to slaughter for heifers
fed melengestrol acetate.<P>
<b>Date Stamped:</b>	06/29/94<P>
<b>2. Indications for Use:</b><P>
For increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency and suppression of
estrus (heat) in heifers fed for slaughter.<P>
<b>3. Dosage Form(s), Route(s) of Administration and Recommended Dosage:</b><P>
The dosage form is Oral (Feed). The route of administration is oral via the
feed. The recommended dosage is 0.25 to 0.5 mg melengestrol acetate per head
per day.<P>
<b>4. Effectiveness:</b><P>
This supplement for the removal of the required 48 hour withdrawal period prior
to slaughter does not affect the efficacy information contained in the current
NADAs.<P>
<b>5. Target Animal Safety:</b><P>
This supplement for the removal of the required 48 hour withdrawal period prior
to slaughter does not affect the target animal safety information contained in
the current NADAs.<P>
<b>6. Human Safety:</b><P>
A. Tolerance:<P>
The human food safety studies defining the toxicity of melengestrol acetate
(MGA) are contained in NADAs 034-254 and 039-402, and a detailed summary of
these studies has been published (Lauderdale et al., 1977. J. Toxicol. &#38 
Environ. Health 3:5-33). Based on a re-evaluation of these studies, it was
determined that the endpoint of toxicological concern is hormonal activity. It
was concluded that residues of parent MGA at or below 25 ppb in edible tissues
of treated animals will not elicit a hormonal response.<P>
Therefore, a tolerance of 25 ppb is established for residues of the parent
compound, MGA, in edible tissues of treated animals. This tolerance corresponds
to the limit of sensitivity of the regulatory method. For monitoring purposes,
fat is the target tissue.<P>
B. Study to establish the withdrawal period:<P>
The following study was conducted to quantitate melengestrol acetate, at zero
time withdrawal, in fat of heifers fed melengestrol acetate at 0.5 mg/head
daily under commercial feeding conditions in the United States of America.<P>
<b>Investigator:</b>	L.F. Krzeminski<br>		The Upjohn Company<br>
Kalamazoo,MI<P>
<b>Animals: </b>A total of 259 feedlot, mixed breed beef heifers were utilized;
seven heifers<b> </b>from each of 25 commercial feedlots where melengestrol
acetate was delivered to feed via a conventional commercial supplement and
seven heifers from each of 12 commercial feedlots where melengestrol acetate
was delivered to feed via a micro-ingredient delivery machine (micro-machine).
The feedlots were located in the states of TX, OK, CO, KS, IA, SD, MO, IN, OR
and WA.<P>
<b>Route of administration: </b>Oral: melengestrol acetate was provided in feed
in a manner practiced at each feedlot. Both conventional supplements and
micromachines were utilized.<P>

<b>Dose and duration of administration: </b>Prior to initiation of the study,
cattle were fed melengestrol acetate at 0.25 to 0.45 mg/head daily during the
finishing phase consistent with the commercial practice of each feedlot. At the
initiation of the study (14 days prior to slaughter), the daily dose of
melengestrol acetate was increased to 0.5 mg/head daily, the highest approved
dose, and remained at this dose until slaughter.<P>
<b>Slaughter time:</b> Cattle were slaughtered at zero time withdrawal which
was defined as the interval from last feeding of melengestrol acetate to
slaughter. These intervals ranged from 0.5 to 27.5 hours among the 37 groups of
cattle. Of the 37 groups of cattle, 27/37 were slaughtered at less than 10
hours after last feeding, 8/37 were slaughtered between 11 and 16 hours after
last feeding and 2/37 were slaughtered at 18 and 27.5 hours after last
feeding.<P>
<b>Tissue residues: </b>At the time of slaughter approximately 1 lb. of
perirenal (kidney) fat (target tissue) was collected from each heifer,
individually packaged and shipped to The Upjohn Company for determination of
melengestrol acetate (marker residue) concentration using the procedure
described in JAOAC 59:507515: 1976. The lowest level of reliable measurement of
this procedure has been determined to be 10 ppb.<P>
All 84 samples from cattle fed melengestrol acetate delivered via a
micro-machine had residues below 10 ppb. Assay values were obtained from 174 of
175 fat samples (1 of 175 fat samples was not assayed) obtained from heifers
administered melengestrol acetate from a conventional feed supplement. Of the
174 samples 139 contained melengestrol acetate residue below 10 ppb; the
remaining 35 samples contained residues of melengestrol acetate between 10.1
and 18.6 ppb.<P>
A statistical analysis of the data was conducted to determine the 99th
percentile with 95% confidence at 12 hours withdrawal (practical zero). The
value was found to be less than 25 ppb.<P>
<b>Conclusions: </b>This study demonstrates that cattle fed melengestrol
acetate at 0.5 mg/head daily (the highest approved dose) and slaughtered at a
zero time withdrawal have residues of melengestrol acetate in fat well below
the tolerance of<br>
25 ppb.<P>
C. Regulatory methods:<P>
The official AOAC method (JAOAC 59:507-515:1976), sensitive to 10 ppb, is used
as the regulatory method for tissue residues of melengestrol acetate.<P>
<br>
<b>7. Agency Conclusions:</b><P>
Under the Center's supplement approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is a
Category II change providing for the removal of the requirement for a   48-hour
withdrawal period prior to slaughter for heifers fed MGA. This supplement
evoked a re-evaluation of the toxicity data contained in NADAs 034-254 and
039-402.<P>
Adequate data were submitted for MGA which permitted the Agency to conclude
that a withdrawal period is not necessary for heifers fed MGA.<P>
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval for food producing animals does not qualify for marketing
exclusivity because the supplemental application does not contain new clinical
or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and new
human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies)
essential to the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<P>

 NADA Number: 140-338<P>
Sponsor: The Upjohn Company<br>
7000 Portage Road<br>
Kalamazoo, MI  49001<p>
Generic Name: Ceftiofur sodium <p>
Trade Name: NAXCEL &#174; Sterile Powder<p>
Marketing Status: Prescription product which includes the caution  statement "Federal (USA) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order
of a veterinarian."<p>
Effect of Supplement: The supplement provides data in support of a
request for approval of Naxcel &#174;  Sterile Powder for an additional species
(equine).  The issue of the Freedom of Information (FOI) Summary should be
considered an extension of previously approved version describing data in
support of Naxcel &#174;, NADA 140-338, approved as a treatment for respiratory
disease in cattle January 25, 1988.<P>
<b>II.	INDICATIONS FOR USE </b><P>
NAXCEL Sterile Powder is indicated for the treatment of respiratory infections
in horses associated with <i>Streptococcus zooepidemicus</i> &#160;  &#160; .<P>
<b>III.	DOSAGE FORM, ADMINISTRATION AND RECOMMENDED DOSAGE </b><P>
NAXCEL Sterile Powder should be reconstituted as follows:<P>
1 gram vial - Reconstitute with 20 mL Sterile Water for Injection or
Bacteriostatic Water for Injection. Each mL of the resulting solution contains
ceftiofur sodium equivalent to 50 mg ceftiofur.<P>
4 gram vial - Reconstitute with 80 mL Sterile Water for Injection or
Bacteriostatic Water for Injection. Each mL of the resulting solution contains
ceftiofur sodium equivalent to 50 mg ceftiofur.<P>
Store unreconstituted product in a refrigerator 2 &#176; -8 &#176; C
(36 &#176; -46 &#176; F). Store reconstituted product either in a
refrigerator 2 &#176; -8 &#176; C (36 &#176; -46 &#176; F) for
up to seven days or at controlled room temperature
15 &#176; -30 &#176; C (59 &#176; -86 &#176; F) for up to 12
hours. Reconstituted NAXCEL can be frozen for up to eight weeks without loss in
potency or other chemical properties. Carefully thaw the frozen material under
warm to hot running water, gently swirling the container to accelerate thawing.
The frozen material may also be thawed at room temperature.<P>
Administer by intramuscular injection to horses at a dosage of 1.0-2.0 mg per
pound of body weight (2.2-4.4 mg/kg). Treatment should be repeated every 24
hours.  At the concentration of 50 mg/mL, this dose requires a treatment volume
of 2-4 mL reconstituted sterile solution per 100 lb body weight.  A maximum of
10 mL may be administered per injection site.  Treatment should be repeated at
24 hour intervals, continued for 48 hours after clinical signs have
disappeared, and should not exceed 10 days.<P>
<b>IV. 	EFFECTIVENESS </b><P>
 A. Pivotal Studies <P>
 1. Determination of Dose <P>
 a. Introduction <p>
		The [[beta]]-lactam class of antibiotics work primarily on infections located
in the extracellular spaces of the body.  For these types of antibiotics,
plasma drug concentrations are more closely related to efficacy than are tissue
homogenate concentrations.  In tissue homogenates, the active drug
concentration at the infection site is diluted by the intracellular fluid
volumes released during the homogenization process.  Thus, historically from
literature, the [[beta]]-lactam pharmacokinetic value most correlated with
efficacy is the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration, not maximum
plasma concentration (Cmax) or area under the curve (AUC).  Accordingly, the
antimicrobial activity of ceftiofur and its active desfuroyl- ceftiofur
metabolites depends on the extracellular tissue concentrations.<P>
		Substantial historical information with the use of ceftiofur sodium in three
species for which it is approved (i.e., bovine, poultry, swine) indicates that,
at efficacious doses, plasma concentrations of ceftiofur and desfuroylceftiofur
metabolites remain above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the
target pathogens for the interval between injections. The well established
relationship of dose/blood concentration/ efficacy in the bovine was bridged to
the blood concentration/time profile in the horse.  In the bovine at the
approved dosage regimen (0.5-1.0 mg ceftiofur equivalents/lb body weight
administered intramuscularly once daily for 3-5 days), concentrations remain at
or above 0.2 &#181;g ceftiofur equivalents/mL plasma for the entire interval between
doses.  This is several-fold higher than the MIC required to inhibit 90% of the
tested isolates associated with bovine respiratory disease (MIC(90)) &#60; &#61; 
0.06 &#181;g ceftiofur equivalents/mL).<P>
		Based on the above data, an efficacious dose of ceftiofur sodium in horses
was predicted.  The efficacious dose is defined as one which results in blood
concentrations of ceftiofur and its desfuroylceftiofur metabolites exceeding
the MIC(90) of the target pathogen (<i>Streptococcus zooepidemicus</i> &#160; )
throughout the dosing interval.  Since the dose extrapolation depends on the
assumption that the penetration of ceftiofur and its active metabolites into
the equine and bovine pulmonary tissues are comparable, the bovine and equine
ratio of blood/lung homogenate concentrations were compared.  Thus, an
appropriate equine ceftiofur dose was derived on the basis of: 1) plasma
pharmacokinetics, particularly, the time above MIC(90) versus either Cmax or AUC,
and 2) verification that ceftiofur plasma pharmacokinetics can predict drug
concentrations within the equine lung.<P>

		This <i>in vitro</i> &#160;  study used bacterial isolates collected from the
respiratory tract of treated and control horses (60) with respiratory
infections from the Confirmation of Dose Study: Ceftiofur vs. Placebo (See IV.
A. 2. b.).  MICs of 101 clinically isolated pathogens, representing 12 genera
and 20 species, were determined for ceftiofur sodium and twelve comparator
antimicrobial compounds or combinations (amikacin, amoxicillin, ampicillin,
cephalothin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin,
penicillin G, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/ sulfadiazine).
Of the 101 isolates, 51 were identified as <i>Streptococcus zooepidemicus</i> &#160; .
The isolates were obtained by transtracheal wash and/or nasopharyngeal swab.
The <i>Streptococcus zooepidemicus</i> &#160;  isolates were very sensitive to
ceftiofur and the other  [[beta]]-lactam antibiotics.  The MIC(90) for all the
[[beta]]-lactam antibiotics was determined to be &#60; &#61; 0.06 &#181;g/mL, except
for amoxicillin.  <i>Streptococcus zooepidemicus</i> &#160;  was less sensitive to the
other compounds tested, except for erythromycin which also had an MIC(90) of
&#60; &#61; 0.06 &#181;g/mL.  In general, ceftiofur was the most active compound
against all the bacterial isolates tested, except for <i>Bordetella
bronchiseptica</i> &#160;  and <i>Pseudomonas</i> &#160;  spp.  The resistance of these
gram-negative, nonfermentors from horses is similar to the MIC values
previously reported for these bacteria from other animals.<P>

Ceftiofur vs. Ampicillin (17 horses, See IV. A. 2. c.) and the corroborative
Equine Clinical Study: Ceftiofur vs. Ampicillin, (29 horses, See IV. B.
1.) The isolates were collected by transtracheal wash and/or nasopharyngeal
swabs. MICs of 62 clinically isolated pathogens were determined for ceftiofur
sodium and seven comparator antimicrobial compounds (ampicillin sodium,
erythromycin, gentamicin, penicillin G, tetracycline hydrochloride,
sulfadiazine and trimethoprim).  Of the 62 isolates, 38 (61%) were identified
as <i>Streptococcus zooepidemicus</i> &#160;  (10 isolates from the 17 horse study and
28 from the 29 horse study).  They were obtained from horses from the following
geographically diverse states: CO, IL, KY, MI, OH, TN and VA.  Beta-hemolytic
streptococci, <i>Pasteurella </i> &#160; spp. and <i>Escherichia coli</i> &#160;  were
previously reported as aerobic bacteria most frequently associated with equine
respiratory disease.  In this study, 40 (64%) of the isolates were
beta-hemolytic streptococci (<i>Streptococcus zooepidemicus</i> &#160;  was represented
by 38 (95%) of the beta-hemolytic streptococci) and 6 (10%) were <i>Pasteurella
</i> &#160; spp.  The remaining isolates were a variety of bacterial species.  The
ceftiofur MICs for all the beta-hemolytic streptococci were &#60; &#61; 0.03
&#181;g/mL and a mean 0.27 &#181;g/mL for the <i>Pasteurella</i> &#160;  spp. The other
comparator drugs exhibited less <i>in vitro</i> &#160;  activity against the same
equine isolates.<P>

		The purpose of this study was to compare the <i>in vitro</i> &#160;  activity of
ceftiofur and desfuroylceftiofur (main metabolite of the parent compound)
against bacterial pathogens of veterinary significance from equine and other
domestic species.  They were evaluated for <i>in vitro</i> &#160;  activity against
<i>Escherichia coli</i> &#160;  (n = 40), <i>Haemophilus somnus</i> &#160;  (n = 59),
<i>Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae</i> &#160;  (n = 50), <i>Streptococcus equi</i> &#160;  (n =
12), and <i>Streptococcus zooepidemicus</i> &#160;  (n = 48); the later two pathogens
were isolated from horses with respiratory infections.  Within the limitations
of the assay, ceftiofur and desfuroylceftiofur were identical in activity
against the gram-negative organisms.  The MIC(90) for both ceftiofur and
desfuroylceftiofur against <i>E. coli</i> &#160;  was 0.5 &#181;g/mL; 0.0078 &#181;g/mL and 0.015
&#181;g/mL , respectively, for <i>A. pleuropneumoniae</i> &#160; ; &#60; &#61; 0.0019 &#181;g/mL
for <i>H. somnus,</i> &#160;  and &#60; &#61; 0.0019 &#181;g/mL and 0.03 &#181;g/mL, respectively,
for streptococci.   Although desfuroylceftiofur was less active <i>in vitro</i> &#160; 
than ceftiofur against the streptococcal species tested, both compounds are
highly active.<p>

		The primary objective of this study was to determine a dose which would
produce a blood concentration above the MIC(90) of the target equine respiratory
pathogen (<i>Streptococcus zooepidemicus</i> &#160; ). Four Quarter Horse male horses
and eight mixed-breed female horses, weighing 972 to 1360 lb, were injected
intramuscularly with a single bolus dose of 1 mg ceftiofur equivalents/lb body
weight (2.2 mg ceftiofur equivalents/kg body weight). Groups of four horses
each were euthanized at 1, 12, and 24 hours after treatment, and total lung
tissues were collected.  Blood samples were collected at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4,
8, 12 and 24 hours postdosing or up until the time of euthanasia. For each
experimental subject, the plasma and lung concentrations of ceftiofur and all
desfuroylceftiofur metabolites were determined by their conversion to
desfuroylceftiofur acetamide and the subsequent measurement of
desfuroylceftiofur acetamide by HPLC and UV detection. <P>
		The average maximum plasma concentration of ceftiofur and desfuroylceftiofur
metabolites (Cmax) of 4.46 +/- 0.93 &#181;g ceftiofur equivalents/mL of plasma
occurred 1.25  &#177;  0.46 hours after injection. These concentrations declined to
0.99  &#177;  0.16, 0.47  &#177;  0.15, and 0.17  &#177;  0.02 &#181;g ceftiofur equivalents/mL of
plasma at 8, 12, and 24 hours, respectively, after injection. Plasma
concentrations were above the minimum concentration required to inhibit 90% of
the isolates tested (MIC(90)) for the entire 24-hour period (i.e. the interval
between doses). These results are similar to those obtained in the bovine at
the lower end of the approved bovine dosage range of 0.5-1.0 mg/lb. The mean
residence time of ceftiofur and desfuroylceftiofur metabolites was estimated to
be 4.6  &#177;  1.0 hours. <P>
To verify that the equine plasma level data adequately reflect the drug
concentrations in the target organ, the bovine ratio and equine ratio of
blood/lung homogenate drug concentrations (ceftiofur and desfuroylceftiofur
metabolites) were compared.  This ratio provides valuable insight into the
similarity of drug penetration into the target organ of both animal species.
Because of errors associated with the relationship of total lung homogenate
drug concentrations to the MIC values for the target respiratory pathogen (see
IV. A. 1. a., Introduction), it was necessary to use the ratio of blood/tissue
drug concentrations in lieu of using lung homogenate concentrations alone.  <P>
The measured total lung homogenate concentrations of ceftiofur and its
desfuroylceftiofur metabolites in horses were 1.40  &#177;  0.36, 0.27  &#177;  0.07, and
0.15  &#177;  0.08 &#181;g ceftiofur equivalents/g of lung tissue (wet weight) at 1, 12,
and 24 hours after dosing, respectively. The equine lung homogenate
concentrations at 12 and 24 hours after injection were similar to those plasma
concentrations observed at the corresponding blood sampling times. In general,
the ratio of plasma/lung homogenate concentration observed in the equine study
was equal to or greater than those estimated from the bovine study, thus
supporting the contention that the penetration of ceftiofur and its
desfuroylceftiofur metabolites into the pulmonary extravascular spaces of the
equine is equal to or greater than that observed in the bovine.<p>
		 
	<b>		d.	Conclusions Regarding Determination of Dose</b><P>
Intramuscular administration of 1.0 mg ceftiofur equivalents/lb of body weight
to horses resulted in rapid absorption; Cmax was achieved within 1-2 hours
after injection. Concentrations of ceftiofur and desfuroylceftiofur metabolites
in the plasma remained above the MIC(90) for the targeted respiratory pathogen
(<i>Streptococcus zooepidemicus</i> &#160; , MIC(90) &lt;= 0.06 &#181;g ceftiofur
equivalents/mL) for 24 hours after treatment, the projected dosing interval.
Comparison of the lung homogenate data from the equine and the bovine indicate
that ceftiofur and desfuroylceftiofur metabolites readily diffuse from the
plasma into the pulmonary extracellular spaces. These data indicate that the
target tissue (lung) is exposed to concentrations of ceftiofur and
desfuroylceftiofur metabolites that exceed the MIC(90) of the respiratory
pathogens of interest for the majority of the dosing interval. It is on that
basis that the dose of 1.0 mg ceftiofur equivalents/lb of body weight was
deemed appropriate for confirming drug efficacy in clinical/field trials.<P>
<b>2. Confirmation of Dose</b><P>
<b>a. Introduction</b><P>
		The combination of pharmacokinetic and <i>in vitro</i> &#160;  data was
utilized in determining the potentially effective dose of 1 mg/lb given SID
(once a day) intramuscularly.  This dose was then taken to the field and
evaluated for safety and efficacy under actual conditions of use in two
well-controlled clinical studies.  In one clinical study, ceftiofur and a
placebo were used, and the second study utilized ceftiofur and ampicillin.  The
2 mg/lb ceftiofur dose, the upper dose of the recommended dosage range, was
established on the basis of safety data generated in the target animal safety
study.  The safety data are presented in the Safety section of this document.<P>

		This was a blinded, well-controlled clinical efficacy study.  Sixty (60)
horses with naturally acquired respiratory infections were randomly assigned to
two study groups: 30 to ceftiofur and 30 to the placebo (saline) group.  A
transtracheal wash (TTW) and a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) were performed on each
horse.  From the TTWs, <i>Streptococcus zooepidemicus</i> &#160; was cultured from 26
of the 30 ceftiofur treated horses and from 25 of the 30 placebo treated, a
total of 51 isolates.  The results obtained via the NPS were similar to those
obtained by the TTW procedure: ceftiofur, 28/30; and 25/30 of the placebo
cultured positive for <i>Streptococcus zooepidemicus</i>.  <i>Streptococcus</i> &#160; 
is considered an opportunistic pathogen infrequently isolated form a
transtracheal wash taken from normal horses (1 Sweeney CR, Beech J, Roby KA. 
Bacterial isolates from tracheobronchial aspirates of healthy horses.  Am J Vet Res, 
Vol 46, No 12, 1985.) .  Other pathogens isolated include
<i>Actinobacillus</i> &#160;  spp., <i>Aeromonas</i> &#160;  spp., <i>Bordetella</i> &#160;  spp.,
<i>Corynebacterium</i> &#160;  spp., <i>Klebsiella</i> &#160;  spp., <i>Moraxella</i> &#160;  spp.,
<i>Pasteurella</i> &#160;  spp., <i>Pseudomonas</i> &#160;  spp., <i>Staphylococcus</i> &#160;  spp.,
and <i>Streptococcus </i> &#160; spp. <P>
		Ceftiofur was administered at 1 mg/lb (2.2 mg/kg) SID intramuscularly, and
saline was administered at the same volume and in the same manner as ceftiofur.
Both treatments were continued for 48 hours after the animals became afebrile
and asymptomatic, but did not exceed 10 days of therapy.  The mean treatment
duration for the ceftiofur treated group was 8.2  &#177;  0.4 days and for the
controls 9.9  &#177;  0.1 days.  <P>
		Twenty-eight (93%) of the horses treated with ceftiofur showed clinical
improvement and 2 (7%) were classified as failures on the last day of
treatment; whereas, only 6 (20%) of the controls improved and 24 (80%) were
failures.  Clinical improvement is defined as near disappearance of all
clinical signs or fully recovered on the last day of treatment.  Body
temperature reduction on the third day after two treatments (days 1 &amp; 2)
was significantly greater (P&lt;0.01) for the ceftiofur group than for the
controls (1.49 vs. 0.03 &#176; F, respectively).  <P>
		Day 7 post-treatment evaluation for the 28 horses treated with
ceftiofur that showed clinical improvement on the last day of treatment
revealed that 26 horses completely recovered/cured, 1 remained the same, and 1
relapsed. Of the two ceftiofur horses that were treatment failures on the last
day of treatment, one remained a failure and one partially recovered on the Day
7 post-treatment evaluation.  <P>
		Day 7 post-treatment evaluation for the 6 control horses that showed clinical
improvement on the last day of treatment revealed that one fully recovered and
the remaining 5 relapsed. Of the 24 control horses that were treatment failures
on the last day of treatment, 11 were failures, 9 partially improved and 4
recovered on the Day 7 post-treatment evaluation.  <P>
Ceftiofur was well tolerated by the animals treated. There were no adverse
reactions in either treatment group. <P>

This was a blinded, well-controlled clinical efficacy study in horses with
naturally acquired respiratory infections. This study was designed to compare
the therapeutic efficacy of ceftiofur sodium  (1.0 mg/lb, 2.2 mg/kg; SID) with
ampicillin sodium, FDA approved, as the positive control drug at its
recommended treatment level of 3 mg/lb (6.6 mg/kg, given BID [two treatments
per day]).   Both treatments were continued for 48 hours after clinical
symptoms were no longer evident (maximum of 10 days). <P>
Seventeen (17) horses with naturally acquired respiratory infections were
included in the study: nine were treated with ceftiofur and eight with
ampicillin.  On the basis of pretreatment characteristics, the two treatment
groups were comparable. Clinical improvement (last day of treatment) was
recorded for 9 (100%) of the patients treated with ceftiofur and 7 (88%) of the
animals receiving ampicillin. Complete recovery/cure (assessment on the last
day of treatment) was noted for 8 (89%) of the ceftiofur patients and 6 (75%)
of those treated with ampicillin. <P>
At Day 7 post-treatment, 9 (100%) of the ceftiofur patients and 5 (63%) of the
horses treated with ampicillin had a complete recovery/cure. Both therapies
reduced body temperature to an afebrile level after two days of treatment.
Other variables (depression/malaise, respiratory/dyspnea, nasal discharge) were
also assessed during the study; these data further confirmed the efficacy of
the treatments. <P>
Bacterial isolates were cultured from transtracheal wash aspirates and/or
nasopharyngeal swabs (pretreatment). For the ceftiofur group: 5 horses had both
a transtracheal wash (TTW) and a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), the remaining 4
horses received only a TTW. Five of the nine TTWs and 4/5 of the NPSs resulted
in positive cultures for <i>Streptococcus zooepidemicus</i>. In the ampicillin
treatment group, 4 horses had both the TTW and the NPS and the remaining 4
horses had only a TTW. Five of the eight TTWs and 2/4 of the NPSs resulted in
positive cultures for <i>Streptococcus zooepidemicus, </i> &#160; a total of 10
isolates. Other pathogens isolated were <i>Acinetobacter</i> &#160;  spp.,
<i>Actinobacillus</i> &#160;   spp.<i>, Moraxella  </i> &#160; spp.<i>, Pasteurella
</i> &#160; spp.<i>, Staphylococcus  </i> &#160; spp.<i>, and Streptococcus  </i> &#160; spp.<i>
</i> &#160; Both therapies were well tolerated: diarrhea was not observed
post-treatment, and neither pain nor swelling was observed at the injection
sites. <P>
			<b>d.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> <b>Regarding Dose Confirmation</b><P>
Ceftiofur sodium administered SID intramuscularly at 1.0 mg/lb (2.2 mg/kg) of

This was a non-blinded, well-controlled clinical efficacy study in
horses with naturally acquired respiratory infections. This study was designed
to compare the therapeutic efficacy of ceftiofur sodium (1.0 mg/lb, 2.2 mg/kg;
SID) with ampicillin sodium, FDA approved, as the positive control drug at its
recommended treatment level of 3 mg/lb (6.6 mg/kg), given BID.   <P>
Twenty-nine (29) horses with naturally acquired respiratory infections were
included in the study: 15 were treated with ceftiofur and 14 with ampicillin.
Both treatments were continued for 48 hours after clinical symptoms were no
longer evident (maximum of 10 days). On the basis of pretreatment
characteristics, the two treatment groups were comparable. The study was
conducted by seven investigators located in CO, FL, KY, MI, MN, TX and VA.  <P>
Data from this study indicated ceftiofur sodium was safe and efficacious as a
therapy for respiratory infections in horses.  Clinical improvement (last day
of treatment) was recorded for 13 (87%) of the patients treated with ceftiofur
and 13 (93%) of the animals receiving ampicillin. Complete recovery/cure
(assessment on the last day of treatment) was noted for 11 (73%) of the
ceftiofur patients and 7 (50%) of those treated with ampicillin.  Partial
recovery was noted for 2 (13%) of the ceftiofur and 6 (43%) of the ampicillin
treated animals.  Two (13%) of the ceftiofur treated horses and one (7%)
ampicillin treated were classified as treatment failures.  <P>
At Day 7 post-treatment, 11 (73%) of the ceftiofur patients and 7 (50%) of the
horses treated with ampicillin had completely recovered/cured. Partial recovery
was noted for 2 (13%) of the ceftiofur group and 5 (36%) of the ampicillin
treated group.  Treatment failure was noted for 2 (13%) of the ceftiofur group
and 2 (14%) of the ampicillin treated horses.  <P>
Both therapies reduced body temperature to an afebrile level after two days of
treatment. Other variables (depression/malaise, respiration/dyspnea, nasal
discharge) were also assessed during the study.  These data further confirmed
the efficacy of the treatments. <P>
Bacterial isolates were cultured from transtracheal wash aspirates or
nasopharyngeal swabs (pretreatment). The most common pathogen cultured from the
horses was <i>Streptococcus zooepidemicus </i> &#160; (n = 28); other pathogens that
were isolated included <i>Streptococcus  </i> &#160; spp.<i>, Pseudomonas  </i> &#160; spp.<i>,
Staphylococcus  </i> &#160; spp.<i>, Escherichia  </i> &#160; spp.,<i> Klebsiella </i> &#160; spp.<i>,

</i> &#160; spp.<i>, Serratia </i> &#160; spp. and <i>Aeromonas  </i> &#160; spp. <P>
In conclusion, ceftiofur sodium  given  SID intramuscularly at 1.0 mg/lb (2.2
mg/kg) of body weight was safe and efficacious as a therapy for respiratory
infections in horses.  Both treatments were well tolerated: diarrhea was not
observed post-treatment and neither pain nor swelling were observed at the

<b>a. Introduction</b><P>
Target Animal Tolerance (TAT) and Target Animal Safety (TAS) studies
were conducted in horses.  The purpose of the TAT study was to demonstrate the
potential systemic toxic signs of ceftiofur, and the purpose of the TAS study
was to establish the margin of safety of the drug.  In the TAT study, ceftiofur
sodium was given intravenously to horses at 10 times and 25 times the 1.0 mg/lb
(2.2 mg/kg) dose for 10 days.  In the TAS study, ceftiofur was given daily for
one month at 1, 3 and 5 times the 1.0 mg/lb (2.2 mg/kg) dose.  When considering
the upper end of the dose range (2.0 mg/lb), ceftiofur sodium was tested at
0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 times the dose.  <p>

		The purpose of the Target Animal Drug Tolerance study was to demonstrate the
potential systemic toxic signs of ceftiofur sodium in male (gelding) horses
following 10 days of daily intravenous infusion of up to 25 times the 1.0 mg/lb
dose.  This study was conducted in accordance with  the GOOD LABORATORY
PRACTICES regulation.  Twelve adult male (gelding) horses were divided into
three groups of four each. Horses in these groups received a single daily
intravenous infusion of either 0 mg/lb/day (saline), 10 mg/lb/day, or 25
mg/lb/day of an aqueous solution (50 mg/mL, marketed formulation) of ceftiofur
for 10 days. The horses were observed for clinical signs from study days -8 or
-7 to 11. Body weights were determined on study days -8 or -7, 1, 6, and 11.
Pelleted feed consumption was measured on study days -8 or -7 to 11.  Physical
examinations were conducted on study days -8 or -7 and 11. Hematology and
clinical chemistry parameters were determined on study days -8 or -7, -4, 4, 8,
and 11. The horses were euthanatized and necropsied on study day 11.
Urinalysis was conducted on urine collected at necropsy.   Organ weights were
determined at necropsy and histopathology was conducted on a complete set of
tissues from all horses.<P>
Clinically, intestinal disturbance was detected in both ceftiofur treated
groups, but the incidence tended to be greater in the high dose group. The
clinical signs included:  diarrhea, dehydration, rolling (colic), eating
bedding straw, and a dull (inactive, sluggish) demeanor. Decreased pelleted
feed consumption was detected in horses from both ceftiofur treated groups, but
was more severe in the high dose group. The two horses (one low dose and one
high dose) with the most severe diarrhea lost weight during the study. <P>
Hematologic changes related to acute inflammation and stress were detected in
both ceftiofur treated groups. The hematologic changes included:  increased
numbers of white blood cells (segmented and band neutrophils), decreased
numbers of lymphocytes, and an increased fibrinogen. Serum chemistry changes
related to decreased food consumption and diarrhea were detected from both
ceftiofur treated groups. The serum chemistry changes included:  decreased
concentrations of glucose, urea nitrogen, and albumin, and an increased
bilirubin concentration.  <P>
Organ weight changes were limited to a mild decrease in the mean absolute and
relative liver weights of the high dose group. Drug-related gross pathologic
changes were limited to an increase in abdominal fluid in one horse of the low
dose group. Drug-related histopathologic changes were detected in the cecum and
bone marrow of horses from both ceftiofur treated groups. These histopathologic
changes included: submucosal edema and inflammation, excessive mucus and
bacteria on the mucosal surface of the cecum, and hyperplasia of the leukocyte
series in the bone marrow.<P>
Ceftiofur administered intravenously at a dose of 10 or 25 mg/lb/day changed
the bacterial flora of the large intestine leading to inflammation   with
subsequent diarrhea and other clinical signs.  Decreased pelleted feed
consumption and a loss of body weight were also associated with treatment at
these doses. The adverse effects were most severe a few days after dosing was
initiated and tended to become less severe toward the end of the 10-day dosing
period.<P>

This was an acute Target Animal Safety (TAS) study.  The purpose of this study
was to evaluate the safety of ceftiofur sodium in male (gelding) horses
following one month of daily intramuscular injections at 1, 3, and 5 times the
1.0 mg/lb dose.  In addition, the horses' ability to reverse any toxic effects
within a one month recovery period was evaluated. This study was conducted in
accordance with the  GOOD LABORATORY PRACTICES regulation.<P>
Twenty (20) adult male (gelding) horses were divided into four groups: six
horses in each of the saline control and high dose groups, and four horses in
each of the low and intermediate dose groups. Horses in these groups received a
daily intramuscular injection of either 0 mg/lb/day (saline control), 1
mg/lb/day (50 mg/mL), 3 mg/lb/day (100 mg/mL), or 5 mg/lb/day (200 mg/mL)
[doses are expressed in terms of the free acid ceftiofur] of an aqueous
solution for 30 days. Four horses from each group were euthanatized and
necropsied on study day 31 or 32. The remaining horses from the saline control
and high dose groups were euthanatized and necropsied on study day 60. The
following types of data were collected:  clinical observations, physical
examinations, pelleted food consumption, body weight, hematology, serum
chemistry, urinalysis, organ weights, gross necropsy observations, and
histopathology.<P>
A very slight to mild decrease in pelleted food consumption was detected in the
horses receiving the 3 and 5 mg/lb/day of ceftiofur. The decreased food
consumption began on study day 2 and lasted for approximately nine days.
Generally, mild skeletal muscle irritation was detected at the injection sites
in all dose groups receiving ceftiofur. The incidence and severity of the
muscle irritation tended to increase with each successive increase in the
concentration of the dosing solution.  Increases in serum concentrations of
aspartate aminotransferase(AST, SGOT) and creatine phosphokinase(CPK) were
detected in some of the ceftiofur treated horses.  The increases were
attributed to mild skeletal muscle damage at the injection sites. Edema,
reddening, and pallor were observed during gross examination of skeletal muscle
at some of the injection sites of the ceftiofur treated horses.  Microscopic
lesions of hemorrhage, edema, inflammation, separation of muscle fibers, and
necrosis were observed at some of the injection sites of the ceftiofur treated
horses. The muscle lesions resolved by regeneration of muscle fibers leaving
small focal areas of fibrosis.<P>
Ceftiofur sodium was generally well tolerated when administered intramuscularly
to male horses at doses up to 5 mg/lb/day for 30 days. The drug-related changes
detected in this study were limited to a transient decrease in food consumption
in horses receiving 3 and 5 mg/lb/day of ceftiofur sodium and generally mild
skeletal muscle irritation at the injection sites of ceftiofur sodium treated
horses which resolved by regeneration of muscle fibers and leaving small focal
areas of fibrosis. The more severe lesions were associated with the higher
concentrations of the dosing solution.  This study supports a dosage of 1.0 to
2.0 mg/lb of body weight, a safe treatment level with an adequate margin of
safety.<P>

horses receiving the 3 and 5 mg/lb/day of ceftiofur. The decreased food
consumption began on study day 2 and lasted for approximately 12 days.
Generally, mild skeletal muscle irritation was detected at the injection sites
in all dose groups receiving ceftiofur. The incidence and severity of the
muscle irritation tended to increase with each successive increase in the
concentration of the dosing solution.  Increases in the number of segmented
neutrophils in peripheral blood and increases in serum concentrations of
aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and
fibrinogen were detected in some of the ceftiofur treated horses and were
attributed to mild skeletal muscle damage at some of the injection sites.
Reddening and pallor were observed during gross examination of skeletal muscle
at some of the injection sites of the ceftiofur treated horses.  Microscopic
lesions of hemorrhage, edema, inflammation, and necrosis were observed at some
of the injection sites of the ceftiofur treated horses. The muscle lesions
resolved by regeneration of muscle fibers leaving small focal areas of
fibrosis.<P>
Ceftiofur sodium was generally well tolerated when administered intramuscularly
to female horses at doses up to 5 mg/lb/day for 30 days. The drug-related
changes detected in this study were limited to a transient decrease in food
consumption in horses receiving 3 and 5 mg/lb/day of ceftiofur sodium and
generally mild skeletal muscle irritation at the injection sites of ceftiofur
sodium treated horses which resolved by regeneration of muscle fibers leaving
small focal areas of fibrosis.  This study supports a dosage of 1.0 to 2.0
mg/lb of body weight, a safe treatment level with an adequate margin of
safety.<P>
<b>e. Conclusions Regarding the Safety of Ceftiofur in Horses</b><P>
In the tolerance study, drug toxicity was observed as expected. None of
the horses died, and the adverse effects were most severe within the first few
days after dosing was initiated and tended to become less severe toward the end
of the 10 day dosing period.  In the safety studies, ceftiofur was well
tolerated at the 1.0, 3.0 and 5.0 mg/lb dosage levels given daily for one
month.  Effects that were observed were minimal and transient. The dosage range
of 1.0-2.0 mg/lb (2.2-4.4 mg/kg) of body weight given SID intramuscularly was
established as being safe for horses. <P>

This was a preliminary target animal tolerance study. The purpose of this study
was to obtain preliminary data on the potential toxicity of ceftiofur sodium in
horses following three daily 25X intravenous doses of the recommended 1.0 mg/lb
dose. This study provided preliminary data on the adverse clinical effects of
ceftiofur in horses prior to the initiation of the dose determination and field
efficacy studies. These data contributed to the design of the definitive drug
tolerance and target animal safety studies. These data were not intended for
target animal safety evaluation and the study was NOT INSPECTED FOR COMPLIANCE
WITH THE GOOD LABORATORY PRACTICES REGULATION.<P>
Six adult male (gelding) horses were divided into two groups of three each.
Horses in these groups received intravenous infusions of either 0 mg/lb/day
(saline) or 25 mg/lb/day of an aqueous solution (50 mg/mL) of ceftiofur for
three days. The horses were observed for clinical signs from study days -3 to
11. Body weights were determined on study days -3, 4, and 11. Pelleted feed
consumption was measured on study days -2 to 11. Physical examinations were
conducted on study days -3, 4, and 11. Hematology and clinical chemistry
parameters were determined on study days -3, 4, and 11. One control horse and
one treated horse were euthanatized and necropsied on study day 4. Of the three
ceftiofur treated horses, two developed diarrhea and one developed colic. A
very slight to severe decrease in pelleted feed consumption and a loss of body
weight were also associated with ceftiofur treatment. All three ceftiofur
treated horses had an increase in serum bilirubin concentration on study day 4.
Increased numbers of neutrophils and decreased numbers of lymphocytes were
detected in peripheral blood of all ceftiofur treated horses on study day 4.
One of two surviving ceftiofur treated horses also had an increased number of
neutrophils in circulating blood on study day 11, and a slight increase in
serum fibrinogen on study days 4 and 11. Moderate diffuse edema of the
descending colon was observed in the ceftiofur treated horse necropsied on
study day 4. Histopathologic examination of this descending colon revealed
acute inflammation.<P>
In conclusion, ceftiofur at a dose of 25 mg/lb changes the bacterial flora of
the large intestine leading to inflammation of the large intestine with
subsequent diarrhea and colic. Decreased pelleted feed consumption and a loss
of body weight were also associated with treatment at this dose.<P>

This was a preliminary target animal safety study. The purpose of this study
was to obtain preliminary data on the clinical safety of ceftiofur sodium in
horses following 30 days of daily intramuscular injection at 5X the 1.0 mg/lb
dose and to evaluate the resolution of lesions within a 30 day recovery period.
This study provided preliminary data on the adverse clinical effects of
ceftiofur in horses prior to the initiation of dose determination and field
efficacy studies. These data contributed to the design of definitive drug
tolerance and target animal safety studies. These data were not intended for
target animal safety evaluation and the study was NOT INSPECTED FOR COMPLIANCE
WITH THE GOOD LABORATORY PRACTICES REGULATION.<P>
Twelve (12) adult male (gelding) horses were divided into two groups of six
each. Horses in these groups received intramuscular injections of either 0
mg/lb/day (saline) or 5 mg/lb/day of an aqueous ceftiofur sodium solution (150
mg/mL, not the marketed formulation) for 30 days. The horses were observed for
clinical signs from study days -7 to 60. Body weights were determined on study
days -7, 1, 11, 21, 31 and 60. Physical examinations were conducted on study
days -7, 31, and 60. Hematology and clinical chemistry parameters were
determined on study days -7, -4, 11, 31, and 60. Ceftiofur was tolerated when
administered to horses at 5 mg/kg for 30 days. <P>
The only definitive drug-related changes detected in this study were increased
serum concentrations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) on study
days 11 and 31 which were attributed to mild skeletal muscle damage at the
injection sites. The apparent skeletal muscle damage was considered to be mild
because the serum enzyme changes were reversible by study day 60 and no
swelling or reddening was observed at the injection sites.<P>
In conclusion, ceftiofur was well tolerated when given at 5 mg/lb/day for 30
days. Drug related effects were mild and reversible.<P>
		<b>3.</b> <b>Muscular Irritation of Ceftiofur Hydrochloride and Ceftiofur

This was a preliminary target animal safety study. The purpose of this study
was to determine the gross irritation properties of ceftiofur sodium (200
mg/mL) and ceftiofur hydrochloride (100 mg/mL, experimental formulation) when
administered to horses by intramuscular injection. Muscle irritation was
evaluated in horses following either a single 2.5 mg/lb intramuscular injection
of ceftiofur hydrochloride in cottonseed oil or a single 5.0 mg/lb
intramuscular injection of ceftiofur sodium in water for injection. <P>
Six horses were used sequentially for each portion of the study. Adverse
effects (pain, itching, edema, swelling or erythema) were not observed
following administration of the ceftiofur sodium. Slight swelling was observed
at the injection sites of horses treated with ceftiofur hydrochloride at six
hours post-treatment. The swelling persisted until 48 hrs post-treatment in two
of the horses. Blood samples were collected before and after treatment (until
144 hours post-treatment) and the serum analyzed for changes in creatine kinase
(CK) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Transient elevations were observed
for CK serum levels in animals injected with the ceftiofur salts. The AST serum
levels for the horses injected with both formulations remained constant at all
sampling periods.<P>
In conclusion, these data suggested ceftiofur hydrochloride in cottonseed oil
is slightly irritating when injected into equine muscle, while administration
of the sodium salt in water for injection was non-irritating and well
tolerated.<P>
<b>VI. DOSE RANGE </b><P>
A dose range of 1-2 mg/lb body weight per day was established for
Naxcel &#174; . The basis for the dose range is as follows:<P>
There can be considerable variability in an infectious disease from case to
case, outbreak to outbreak, and over a period of time. Since respiratory
disease in the horse can be acute or chronic and be present in various degrees
of severity and with complications, a higher dose may be appropriate in some
cases. Target animal safety data indicates that there are no serious adverse
effects at 5 mg/lb/day. Therefore, the margin of safety for the upper end of
the dose range is greater than 2.5X. Due to the volume necessary to achieve the
recommended dosage range (2-4 cc/100 lb body weight), it is unlikely that a
dose much higher than 2 mg/lb would be given inadvertently.  Therefore it was
not considered necessary to conduct a 5X margin of safety study at the 2 mg/lb
dose level.<P>
Normally, the Center would require the upper end of the dose range be tested in
clinical field trials. However, the safety and efficacy of the upper end of the
dose range are established by the following factors: Ceftiofur sodium is
approved for use in three other species (bovine, poultry, and swine) and an
extensive safety and efficacy data base exists for these species. Ceftiofur is
a beta-lactam antibiotic, and this class of antibiotics is well recognized to
have a wide margin of safety. Target animal safety studies demonstrate an
adequate margin of safety, even for the upper end of the dose range. In
summary, due to the data base for this beta-lactam antibiotic drug in other
animal species as well as the target species (horse), it was not considered
necessary to have tested the 2 mg/lb dose in the field trials.<P>
<b>VII.	 HUMAN SAFETY </b><P>
	A. 	Human Safety relative to consumption of drug residues:  
 <p>
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not required for approval of this NADA. The drug is approved for use only in
horses that are not to be used for food. The product labeling under the heading
<b>Residue Warning</b> reads "Not for use in horses intended for food."<P>
	B. 	Human Safety relative to possession, handling, and administration:  <P>
When used according to label instructions, the product poses no hazard to the
administrator of the product. The <b>Caution</b> statement on the product
labeling restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed
veterinarian. The label also indicates "Not for human use. Keep out of the
reach of children" under the <b>Warning </b>heading. If the user of the product
is hypersensitive to the product, the statement under the package insert
heading <b>Warning </b>is sufficient to warn those individuals. <P>
<b>VIII. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS </b><P>
The data in support of this supplemental NADA complies with the requirements of
Seciton 512 of the Act and Section 514.11 of the implementing regulations.  It
demonstrates that Naxcel &#174;  Sterile Powder(ceftiofur sodium), when used under
labeled conditions of use is safe and effective for the treatment of
respiratory infections in horses associated with <i>Streptococcus
zooepidemicus.</i> &#160; <p>
 
According to the Center's supplemental approval policy (42 FR 6436), this is a
Category II change.  This supplement provides for an additional species
(equine).  The approval of this change is not expected to have any adverse
effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug.  Accordingly,
this approval did not require a reevaluation of the safety and effectiveness
data in the parent application.  <p>
 
 The pharmacokinetic and <i>in vitro</i> &#160;   microbiological data were
utilized to support the determination of a effective dose of 1.0 mg/lb; this
dose was confirmed to be efficacious and safe for treating respiratory
infections in horses in clinical/field studies. The upper end of the dosage
range (2.0 mg/lb) was established on the basis of safety data in the target
animal. The recommended dosage range (1.0-2.0 mg/lb) gives the practitioner
greater flexibility of using the drug based on his/her clinical judgment. <p>
 For the safe and effective use of Naxcel &#174;  Sterile Powder (ceftiofur
sodium), it is necessary to provide a diagnosis of respiratory disease in
horses which only a trained professional can accomplish. Naxcel is currently a
prescription product for use in food animals.  We have determined that
Naxcel &#174;  Sterile Powder (ceftiofur sodium) remain as a prescription product
for use in horses also. <P>
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21
U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii), this approval for non-food producing animals
qualifies for three years of marketing exclusivity beginning on the date of
approval because the application contains reports of new clinical or field
investigations (other than bioequivalence studies) essential to the approval of
the application and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.  <P>

<b>Roche Ruminant Free-Choice Liquid Type C Lasalocid Medicated Feed</b><p>
Three well-controlled clinical studies were conducted with one formulation of a
lasalocid (150 g/ton) liquid Type C medicated feed to demonstrate consumption
of the drug with variation less than or equal to the variation (CV = 35.07) in
the studies used to establish the effectiveness of lasalocid in self-limiting
free-choice supplemental feeds (approved 2/12/86). These studies each had three
replicates. Lasalocid intake for the three studies was 171, 139, and 146
mg/head/day which are all within the 60-200 mg/head/day approved dose of
lasalocid to pasture cattle. The coefficient of variation for intake was 33.9%
for these three studies.<p>
<b>Oklahoma Study</b><p>
This study was conducted at USDA ARS Forage and Livestock Research Lab, El
Reno, Oklahoma, by Dr. W.A. Phillips.<p>
Thirty-six stocker steers, approximately eight months old with average initial

<b>Agency Conclusions</b><p>
This supplemental NADA satisfies the requirements of section 512(b) of the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and demonstrates that
Bovatec  &#174  68 (dry Type A medicated article) and
Bovatec  &#174  20 (liquid Type A medicated article), when used
under the proposed conditions of use is safe and effective for the labeled
indications. The ruminant free-choice liquid Type C medicated feed labeling
must indicate a two month after manufacture expiration date.<p>
Under the Center for Veterinary Medicine's supplemental new animal drug
application policy-(<B>21 CFR 5 14.106</B>), this is a Category II change providing
for the use of lasalocid in a ruminant free-choice liquid Type C medicated
feed, a self-limiting supplemental feed in pasture cattle (slaughter, stocker,
feeder cattle, and dairy and beef replacement heifers).<p>
The use provided by this supplement does not constitute an expanded use because
this is only a change in type of carrier for the drug. Only animals presently
receiving lasalocid under existing approvals (see <B>21 CFR 558.31l</B>) will receive
this medicated liquid feed. Therefore, a review of the underlying effectiveness
and safety data under NADA 096-298 is not required.<p>

<br>
<b>EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>NADA 065-123 was originally approved as safe for use as
labeled on April 27, 1955. The drug was the subject of National Academy of
Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) reports which were published in
the <b>FEDERAL REGISTER</b> of July 8, 1970 (<B>35 FR 10966</B>). The Academy
evaluated this drug as probably effective for oral treatment of animal diseases
when such diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms sensitive to
tetracycline hydrochloride, diseases such as: (1)Enteric and respiratory
diseases in poultry (2) gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in swine; (3)
infected wounds, gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in calves, sheep,
and goats; (4) digestive system and respiratory diseases, pyelonephritis,
peritonitis, infected wounds, abscesses, ulcers, and secondary bacterial
invaders in dogs and cats; (5) coccidiosis in dogs; and (6) hexamitiasis in
turkeys.<P>
The Academy concluded that: (1) Most of the dosage directions provide for a
less than effective dose, and the recommended minimum oral dose for large
animals is 10 milligrams per pound of body weight daily in divided doses and
for small animals 25 milligrams per pound of body weight in divided doses; (2)
claims for the treatment of viral diseases must be limited to microorganisms
belonging to the psittacosis-lymphogranuloma group; (3) each disease claim
should be properly qualified as "appropriate for use in (name of disease)
caused by pathogens sensitive to (name of drug), "and if the disease cannot be
so qualified the claim must be dropped; (4) claims made "for prevention of" or
"to prevent" should be replaced with "as an aid in the control of" or "to aid
in the control of"; (5) as applicable, the manufacturer's label should warn
that treated animals must actually consume enough medicated water or medicated
feed to provide a therapeutic dose under the conditions that prevail as a
precaution, the label should state the desired oral dose per unit of animal
weight per day for each species as a guide to effective use of the preparation
in drinking water or feed.<P>
The Food and Drug Administration concurs with the Academy's findings,
interpreting the phrase "...cannot be so qualified..." in paragraph (3) to mean
"...is not supported by adequate data..." (See <B>Fed. Reg. vol. 35, NO. 131-Wed.,
July 8, 1970</B>). FDA proceeded to review all available data relating to the
effectiveness of products subject to NADA 065-123 to determine which label
claims were supported by the requisite proof of effectiveness. That review
resulted in a letter to the sponsor dated July 1, 1992, in which the agency
stated that it had concluded that such data supported effectiveness only for
the control and treatment of certain bacterial diseases susceptible to
tetracycline hydrochloride in chickens and turkeys.<P>
Thereafter, the sponsor complied with the evaluation of NAS/NRC and FDA's
conclusions in the following manner:<P>
1.	The 25 mg per pound body weight and 400 mg/gal are appropriate for turkeys
and 200-800 mg/gal is appropriate for chickens.<P>
2.	Claims for viral diseases have been deleted from the labeling completely.<P>
3.	Each disease claim on the label has been properly qualified with the
appropriate genus and species of bacteria susceptible to tetracycline
hydrochloride. Disease claims which were not so qualified have been deleted.<P>
4.	Claims made for prevention have been revised to read "Control of..." where
appropriate.<P>
5.	The manufacturer's label carries the warning statement that treated animals
must have the medicated water adjusted to compensate for variation in age and
the weight of the animal, the nature and severity of disease signs, and
environmental temperature and humidity, each of which affects water
consumption.<P>
<b>ANIMAL SAFETY:</b><p> 
NADA 065-123 was originally approved as safe on April 27,
1955. No further safety data are required.<P>
<b>HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p> 
The NAS/NRC evaluation of the drug is concerned only
with the effectiveness and safety of the drug for the treated animal. FDA's
approval of the supplemental application did not involve reevaluation or
reaffirmation of the human food safety data in the parent application.<P>
 <B>&#167 556.720 Tetracycline</B><P>
A tolerance of 0.25 part per million has already been established for
negligible residues of tetracycline in uncooked edible tissues in chickens, and
turkeys.<p>
Withdrawal times: 4 days-chickens and turkeys<p>
<b>AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
This supplemental NADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrates that Tetracycline Soluble Powder when used under its proposed
conditions of use, is safe and effective for the labeled indications for use in
chickens and turkeys.<P>
The "probably effective" finding of the NAS/NRC regarding Tetracycline
hydrochloride which was published in the <b>FEDERAL REGISTER</b> of July 8,
1970, was subsequently reviewed by FDA, resulting in the upgrade to "effective"
status with respect to the claims noted in the previous paragraph. The firm
submitted revised labeling to conform and, therefore, this supplemental NADA
complies with the NAS/NRC evaluation and FDA's conclusions.<P>
Tetracycline Soluble Powder for use in food-producing animals is currently on
the market as an over-the-counter product. When the NADA was reviewed under
NAS / NRC / DESI program, it was an <i> </i>over-the-counter product and this
marketing status remains unchanged. Therefore, the Center for Veterinary
Medicine has concluded that this product should retain over-the-counter
marketing status.<P>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is
a Category II change. The approval of this change is not expected to have any
adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug and,
therefore, did not require a reevaluation of the human food or target animal
safety data in the parent application.<P>
Under the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988, this
approval does not qualify for an exclusivity period under section
512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b
(c)(2)(F)(iii)) because the supplemental application does not contain reports
of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue
studies) and in the case of food producing animals, human food safety studies
(other than bioequivalency or residue studies) essential to the approval and
conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<P>

Accepted Name:  Fenbendazole<P>

Trade Name:  PANACUR &#174;<P>

Marketing Status:  Rx<P>

Effect of Supplement:<P> This supplement provides for an expanded use of
fenbendazole in a new species (goats).<P>

Date of Summary:  April 25, 1994<P>

<B>2. INDICATIONS FOR USE</B><P>

For the removal and control of stomach and intestinal worms, <I>Haemonchus
contortus</I> and <I>Ostertagia circumcincta</I>, in goats.<P>

<B>3. DOSAGE FORM, ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION, AND RECOMMENDED DOSAGE</B><P>

Fenbendazole 10% suspension will be marketed as an oral anthelmintic in 1000 mL
multidose glass bottle.<P>

The drug is to be administered orally to goats as a single dosage of 5 mg
fenbendazole per kg of body weight.<P>

<B>4. EFFECTIVENESS</B><P>

This has been addressed in <B>PMF 5118, 56 FR 13650</B>, April 3, 1991.<P>

<B>5. ANIMAL SAFETY</B><P>

This has been addressed in <B>PMF 5118, 56 FR 13650</B>, April 3, 1991.<P>

<B>6. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY</B><P>

a. <I>Toxicity Studies</I> - These have been adequately addressed in the
original approval.<P>

b. <I>Tolerance for Residues </I>- A tolerance of 0.8 ppm is established for
parent fenbendazole in liver of goats.<P>

c. <I>Metabolism and Total Residue Depletion Studies</I> - Adequate data on
metabolism have been submitted for cattle under approved NADA 128-620 and no
unique metabolites of toxicological concern are anticipated to result from the
recommended use of fenbendazole in goats.<P>

d. <I>Withdrawal Time </I>- Residue depletion data submitted under <B>PMF 5118, 56
FR 13650</B>, April 3, 1991, support a 6-day preslaughter withdrawal time for goats
treated with the recommended dose of fenbendazole 10% suspension.<P>

<B>7. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</B><P>

The data submitted in support of this supplemental NADA satisfy the requirements
of Section 512 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and 21 CFR 514.106 of the
implementing regulations.  The data demonstrate that fenbendazole 10% suspension
Panacur &#174; is safe and effective, when used in accordance with labeling
directions, for the removal and control of stomach and intestinal worms,
<I>Haemonchus contortus</I> and <I>Ostertagia circumcincta</I>, in goats.<P>

The human food safety data submitted under <B>PMF 5118, 56 FR 13650</B>, April 3, 1991,
indicate that the goats treated with fenbendazole at the recommended dosage will
require 6 days for the depletion of fenbendazole residue from the edible
tissues.<P>

The agency concludes that appropriate directions for use have been written for
prescription use of this oral suspension drug in goats.  The currently approved
fenbendazole suspension is codified in Section 21 <B>CFR 520.905a</B> for use in
cattle.<P>

The agency has carefully considered the potential environment effects of this
action and has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on
the human environment and that an environmental impact statement is not
required. The agency's finding of no significant impact (FONSI) and the evidence
supporting that finding are contained in an environmental assessment which may
be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA 305), Park Building (Room 1-23),
12420 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, MD 20855.<P>

Under the agency's supplemental approval policy, 21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)(vii), this
is a Category II change that did not require a reevaluation of the safety and
effectiveness data contained in the Public Master File (PMF) 5118.<P>

Under Section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval does not qualify for marketing exclusivity because no new clinical
or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and no
new human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies)
essential to the approval of the supplement were conducted or sponsored by the
applicant.<P>

<b>4.
 EFFECTIVENESS:</b> NADA 065-071 was originally approved as safe for use as
labeled on June 23, 1953. The drug was the subject of National Academy of
Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) reports which were published in
the <b>FEDERAL REGISTER</b> of July 21, 1970 (<B>35 FR 11647</B>). The Academy
evaluated these products as probably effective for growth promotion and feed
efficiency and the treatment of animal diseases caused by pathogens sensitive
to chlortetracycline.<p>
The Academy states that: (1) Claims made regarding "for prevention of" or "to
prevent" should be replaced with "as an aid in the control of" or "to aid in
the control of"; (2) claims for growth promotion or stimulation are disallowed
and claims for faster gains and/or feed efficiency should be stated as "may
result in faster gains and/or improved feed efficiency under appropriate
conditions"; (3) each disease claim should be properly qualified as
"appropriate for use in (name of disease) caused by pathogens sensitive to
(name of drug) "; if the disease cannot be so qualified the claim must be
dropped; (4) claims pertaining to egg production and hatchability should be
changed to "May aid in maintaining egg production and hatchability, under
appropriate conditions, by controlling pathogenic microorganisms"; (5) the
labels should warn that treated animals must actually consume enough medicated
water or medicated feed to provide a therapeutic dosage under the conditions
that prevail and, as a precaution, state the desired oral dose per unit of
animal weight per day for each species as a guide to effective usage of the
preparation in drinking water or feed: and (6) effective blood levels are
required for each recommended dosage.<P>
The Food and Drug Administration concurs with the Academy's findings,
interpreting the phrase "...cannot be so qualified..." in paragraph (3) to mean
"...is not supported by adequate data..." (See <B>Fed. Reg. vol. 35, NO.
140-Tues., July 21, 1970</B>). FDA proceeded to review all available data relating
to the effectiveness of products subject to NADA 065-071 to determine which
label claims were supported by the requisite proof of effectiveness. That
review resulted in a letter to the sponsor dated April 20, 1992, in which the
agency stated that it had concluded that such data supported effectiveness only
for the control and treatment of certain bacterial diseases susceptible to
chlortetracycline hydrochloride in chickens, turkeys and swine.<P>
Thereafter, the sponsor complied with the evaluation of NAS/NRC and FDA's
conclusions in the following manner:<P>
<b>1.</b>	Appropriate oral doses of 10 mg per pound body weight daily in swine
and cattle, 200-1000 mg/gallon for chickens and 400 mg/gal and 25 mg per pound
body weight for turkeys when treating bluecomb disease (transmissible
enteritis, coronaviral enteritis).<P>
<b>2.</b>	Claims for inappropriate viral diseases have been deleted from the
labeling completely.<P>
<b>3.	</b>Each disease claim on the label has been properly qualified with the
appropriate genus and species of bacteria susceptible to chlortetracycline
hydrochloride. Disease claims which were not so qualified have been deleted.<P>
<b>4.</b>	Claims made for prevention have been revised to read "Control of..."
where appropriate.<P>
<b>5.</b>	The manufacturer's label carries the warning statement that treated
animals must have the medicated water adjusted to compensate for variation in
age and the weight of animals, the nature and severity of disease signs, and
environmental temperature and humidity, each of which affects water
consumption.<P>
<b>ANIMAL SAFETY:</b> NADA 065-071 was originally approved as safe on June 23
1953. No further safety data are required.<P>
<b>HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b> The NAS / NRC evaluation of the drug is concerned only
with the effectiveness and safety of the drug for the treated animal. FDA's
approval of the supplemental application does not involve reevaluation or
reaffirmation of the human food safety data in the parent application. The
tolerances for residues of chlortetracycline are codified at  <B>21 CFR
556.150.</B><P>
Withdrawal times: 24 hours for chickens, turkeys, swine and cattle.<P>
<b>AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><P>
This supplemental NADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrates that AUREOMYCIN Soluble Powder when used under its proposed
conditions of use, is safe and effective for the labeled indications. The
approval provides for use of AUREOMYCIN Soluble Powder for the control and
treatment of specific diseases in swine, cattle, chickens and turkeys.<P>
The "probably effective" finding of the NAS/NRC regarding chlortetracycline
hydrochloride which was published in the <b>FEDERAL REGISTER</b> of July 21,
1970, was subsequently reviewed by FDA, resulting in the upgrade to "effective"
status with respect to the claims noted in the previous paragraph. The firm
submitted revised labeling to conform and, therefore, this supplemental NADA
complies with the NAS/NRC evaluation and FDA's conclusions.<P>
When NADA 065-071 was reviewed under NAS / NRC / DESI program, it was an
over-the-counter product and this marketing status remains unchanged.
AUREOMYCIN Soluble Powder for use in food-producing animals are also currently
on the market as over-the-counter products. Therefore, the Center for
Veterinary Medicine has concluded that this product should retain
over-the-counter marketing status.<P>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is
a Category II change. The approval of this change is not expected to have any
adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug and,
therefore, did not require a re-evaluation of the human food or target animal
safety data in the parent application.<P>
Under the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988, this
approval does not qualify for an exclusivity period under section
512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b
(c)(2)(F)(iii)) because the supplemental application does not contain reports
of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue
studies) and in the case of food producing animals human food safety studies
(other than bioequivalency or residue studies) essential to the approval and
conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<P>

 Effect of Supplement:<P>	<B>21 CFR 558.95</B> currently provides for the use of 
bambermycins in poultry and swine. This supplement provides for the use of 
bambermycins in cattle fed in confinement for slaughter for increased rate of 
weight gain and improved feed efficiency.<P>

<B>2.     Indications for Use:</B><P>

For increased rate of weight gain and improved feed efficiency in cattle fed 
in confinement for slaughter.<P>

<B>3.    Dosage Form, Route of Administration, and Recommended Dosage:</B><P>
Flavomycin &#174;   is supplied as three (3) Type A Medicated Articles in 50 lb. 
multi-walled bags. The Type A Medicated Articles contain 2 g bambermycins per 
pound4 g bambermycins per pound, and 10 g bambermycins per pound. The drug 
isadministered orally by mixing the Type A Medicated Article into cattle 
supplements (Type B Medicated Feed) and complete cattle feed (Type C Medicated 
Feed). The dosage is 1-4 g bambermycins/ton (in a Type C medicated feed) to supply 10-20 
mg bambermycins/hd/day.<P>

<B>4.     Effectiveness:</B><P>

<B>Pivotal Dose Titration Studies:</B><P>

This New Animal Drug Application is based on adequate and well-controlled 
studies demonstrating the effectiveness of bambermycins for increased rate of 
weight gain and improved feed efficiency in feedlot cattle. The pivotal studies are dose 
titration studies in which the parameters measured are the same parameters as 
measured in clinical (field) studies. These studies were conducted using 
similar protocols so the results may be pooled and summarized.<P>

The 1830 test animals used in these nine (9) feedlot studies were crossbred 
animals of European breeds. There were 6 to 20 steers or heifers per pen with 
each treatment replicated 4 to 6 times. The initial animal weights ranged from 
400 to 900 lbs. and the studies were terminated when the animals reached 
slaughter weights and condition (1,000 to 1,200 lbs.). Feeding periods ranged 
from 84 to 238 days depending on initial weights and energy level in the diet. 
Low energy (high roughage/low concentrate) to high energy (low roughage/high 
concentrate) diets were fed. Bambermycins was administered via the feed in the 
following doses: 0.0, 2.5, 5.0,10.0, 20.0, and 40.0 mg bambermycins per head 
per day. The results from the nine (9) studies are summarized as follows:<P>

A randomized complete block design was used for all studies and the data were 
pooled by Analysis of Variance to determine the significance of the effect of 
bambermycins on average daily gain (ADG) and feed efficiency (FIG). A weighted 
regression analysis was used because the error mean squares were 
heterogeneous. Additionally the pooled analysis was conducted using the 
treatment means from each experiment weighted by the reciprocal of its error 
mean square. The data were analyzed by least squares and effective ranges were 
determined by nonoverlapping confidence intervals. Based on the results of the 
least squares analysis and the regression analysis a range of 10-20 mg 
bambermycins/hd/day was approved for increased rate of weight gain and 
improved feed efficiency. Data from this pooled analysis are presented in the 
following table.<p>

The highest approved use level of bambermycins is 20 mg/hd/day. This was 
established as the 1 X dose level. Multiples of the highest use level were 
then tested as follows (mg/hd/day): control (0.0 mg), 1 X (20.0 mg), 5X (100.0 
mg), 15X (300 mg) and 75X (1500 mg). The 75X dose was the drug tolerance 
portion of this study and was fed for 21 days. Bambermycins was fed 
continuously from study initiation to slaughter for the 1 X, 5X, and 15X 
groups. The duration of treatment for these groups was 150 to 166 days or a 
normal growing finishing period for feedlot steers and heifers.

The 75X calves were fed bambermycins for 21 days, then depurated for 23 days 
prior to sacrifice and disposal. They were observed twice daily for any 
adverse effects attributable to bambermycins. Blood samples were drawn from the 75X 
animals prior to initiation and on days 10, 21, 25 and 30. These samples were 
assayed for bambermycins residues.

The control, 1 X, 5X and 15X cattle were observed once daily for abnormal 
behavior, depression, anorexia, urine or feces abnormalities and abnormal skin 
or hair coat. Blood samples were collected prior to initiation of treatments 
and on days 45, 90, 135 and just prior to slaughter. The following assays and 
cell counts (hematology) were done on all samples.

The control, 1 X, 5X, and 15X cattle were sacrificed at the end of the study 
and the weights of the major organs (heart, liver, spleen, kidneys and lungs) 
were obtained. Additionally the following list of tissues were collected for 
histopathological examinations: pituitary gland, thyroid glands, parathyroid 
glands, adrenal glands, spleen, liver, kidneys, bone with marrow and marrow 
smear. A complete necropsy was conducted on each animal. Carcass quality 
evaluations were conducted and each carcass was evaluated for quality grade, 
yield grade, rib eye area, marbling and fat thickness.<p>

Results<p>

The calves remained healthy and exhibited no observable adverse effects in any 
of the treatments. There were no adverse effects on feed efficiency and 
average daily gain. The results from the remaining parameters measured were 
summarized as follows:<p>

*	There were no changes, due to the drug, in the blood chemistry or 
hematology variables that are of biological importance to the target 
animal.<p>

*	No gross lesions or abnormalities were observed in any tissues. There 
were	no significant findings in the necropsy and histopathology reports. 
There	were no significant differences in organ weights.<p>

There were no significant findings in the carcass quality evaluations.<p>

*	No adverse effects due to bambermycins were seen in the 75X cattle (drug
tolerance study). No bambermycins residues were detected in any of the
blood samples from the 75X animals.<p>

The study was conducted at International Research and Development Corp., 
Matrawan, Michigan 49071. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the 
carcinogenicity of bambermycins (Flavomycin &#174; ) mycelium cake in a two year 
feeding study. Bambermycins was offered in the diet at concentrations of 0, 1, 
2, and 4 percent. The actual level of bambermycins in the diets was 0.0, 
466.0, 932.0, and 1,864.0 grams per ton of diet. Fifty (50) male and 50 female 
mice were initiated at each dosage level and in each of two control groups.<p>

The mice were observed daily for signs of overt toxicity and for mortality. 
Individual body weights and food consumptions were recorded weekly for the 
first 14 weeks and once every two weeks thereafter. Complete necropsies were 
performed on all mice that died or were sacrificed during the study. At the 
termination of the study, all surviving mice were sacrificed by carbon dioxide 
asphyxiation and necropsied. Representative tissues were fixed in formalin and 
stained in hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological examination.<p>

No treatment-related effects were seen after 18 months of treatment (chronic 
toxicity portion of the study). After two years of treatment, there were no 
toxicologically significant treatment-related macroscopic or microscopic 
changes of neoplastic or non-neoplastic nature in mice of either sex or at any 
dosage level.<p>

<p>
The study was conducted at International Research and Development Corp., 
Matrawan, Michigan 49071. Bambermycins was offered in the diet at 
concentrations of 0, 1, 2, and 4 percent. The actual level of bambermycins in 
the diets was 0.0, 466.0, 932.0, and 1,864.0 grams per ton of diet. Sexually 
mature rats were divided in two control and three treatment groups consisting 
of 50 males and 50 females each. These rats were used to produce offsprings to 
be used in the chronic study to evaluate the toxicological and carcinogenic 
potential of bambermycins with exposure beginning in utero. The bambermycins 
mycelia was administered orally two weeks before mating of the Fo generation. 
Following weaning, sixty (60) F1 pups per sex per group were initiated in the 
chronic phase of the study.<p>

During the in utero phase of the study, parental animals and pups were 
observed for mortality and signs of overt toxicity twice a day. Individual 
parental body weights and food consumptions were measured except during mating 
periods. Maternal body weights were recorded at specified intervals during 
gestation and lactation. Reproductive and litter parameters assessed included 
male and female fertility indices, parturition, gestation length, litter size, 
mean number of viable and stillborn pups, pup survival, and mean pup body 
weight during lactation.<p>

In the chronic phase of the study, the rats were observed twice daily for 
appearance, behavior, signs of overt toxicity, moribundity, and mortality. 
Individual body weights and food consumptions were measured weekly for the 
first 14 weeks and every other week thereafter. Ophthalmoscopic examinations 
were conducted during weeks 2, 13, 26, 51, 78, and 104. Clinical laboratory 
tests were performed on 10 rats/sex/group at 3, 6, 12,
8, 24 months of the study. The clinical laboratory tests included 
hematological, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis determinations.<p>

After 12 months of dosing in the chronic phase of the study, 10 rats/sex/group 
were sacrificed and necropsied. All rats that died, those sacrificed in 
extremis, and all survivors at termination of study were also necropsied. 
Weights of brain, kidneys, liver, heart, spleen, testes, thyroid/parathyroid, 
ovaries, and adrenals were recorded for animals sacrificed at 12 months and at 
study termination. A complete set of tissues was fixed and stained for 
histological examination in all control groups and high dose rats, and all 
animals that died or were sacrificed in extremis. All
gross lesions, masses, and their regional lymph nodes were also
histologically examined.<p>

No treatment-related effects were seen during the in utero phase of the study. 
At termination of the chronic toxicity phase of the study (one year interim 
report), the only changes observed were increases in the relative and absolute 
weights of livers and kidneys particularly in the 4% and some of the 2% 
groups. Females of the 2% group had an increase in absolute and relative liver 
weight and absolute kidney weight. Males of this group also had increased 
liver and kidney weights. Only the relative kidney weight of the 2% males was 
higher than the controls. Consequently, the NOEL for the 1-year chronic 
toxicity study is 1% of mycelial bambermycins in the feed.<p>

After two years of treatment, no differences were seen in appearance, 
behavior, survival rate, body weight gain and food consumption. The only 
effect observed was an increase in absolute and relative liver and kidney 
weights mainly in the males of the 4% group. No macroscopic or microscopic 
lesions of either neoplastic or non-neoplastic nature, or hematological, 
biochemical and urinary changes occurred in any group after an in utero 
exposure followed by two years of oral administration of bambermycins mycelia.<p>

Consequently, bambermycins mycelia was found to be non-carcinogenic in 2-year 
chronic feeding studies in rats and mice.<p>

Several toxicity studies were performed between 1962 and 1968 at Hoechst A.G., 
Frankfurt, Germany. They include a two-year reproduction study in rats, a 
chronic (2 year) feeding toxicity study in rats, sub-acute (90 days) oral 
toxicity studies in rats and dogs, and oral acute toxicity studies in rats and 
mice.<p>

The two-year reproduction study (RR-1-64) collected data from five generations 
when bambermycins mycelia was fed at 0 and 25 mg/kg of feed to rats. The only 
effect observed was a slightly lower number of litters in the treated groups 
compared to the controls. No differences were found in litter size, pup 
weight, and pup mortality. The chronic feeding study in rats also showed no 
adverse effects on body weight, mortality, hematology, liver glycogen, blood 
sugar levels, urinalysis, organ weights, or histopathology when bambermycins 
mycelia was fed at 0 and 50 mg/kg of feed.<p>

The 90-day rat study showed no effects on body weight gain, feed consumption, 
mortality, behavior, functional tests, hematology, urinalysis, organ weights, 
or histopathology when bambermycins was fed at 0, 1,000 (mycelia), and 10,000 
mg (semi-purified) bambermycins per kg of feed. The 90-day dog study also 
showed no adverse effects on body weight, general condition, hematology, blood 
glucose levels, urinalysis, or hematology when bambermycins was fed to 17-
month old dogs at 400 and 4,000 mg/kg of feed in the mycelial and semi-
purified forms.<p>

Oral acute toxicity studies in rats and mice showed no toxicity in rats given 
up to 40 g mycelia per kg body weight (containing 90 mg bambermycins) within 
8-1/16 hours. In mice, no effects were seen with up to 90 g/kg body weight of 
mycelia containing 202.5 mg bambermycins when given within 7-1/2 hours. When 
purified bambermycins was used no effects occurred with 10 grams/kg body 
weight in one single application or with two applications, each of 10 grams/kg 
body weight, given within a two hour interval.<p>

A teratology study for bambermycins was not required because: a) all the 
toxicity studies demonstrated that bambermycins is non-toxic when given at 
doses of up to 1,000 times the highest use level (20 mg/head/day), b) study 
number 327-047 showed no effects on reproductive or litter parameters when 
rats were exposed to the drug In Utero, and c) study number RR-1-64 showed no 
adverse or teratogenic effects in rats exposed to high levels of bambermycins 
through 5 generations.<p>

B.     Safe Concentration of Residues<p>

Based on the 1-year toxicity portion of the 2-year toxicity carcinogenicity 
study in rats, the NOEL for mycelial bambermycins was 1%. Considering a daily 
product intake of 571 mg/kg, a 100-fold safety factor, and a purity of the 
product of 5.12%, the calculated safe concentration for pure bambermycins in 
muscle is 35 ppm. However, for the reasons discussed in Section C, the safe 
concentration for bambermycins in muscle is being limited to 3 ppm. Since only 
minimal or no signs of toxicity were observed even at the very highest doses, 
radiolabelled metabolism and residue studies were not required for the 
bambermycins.<p>

Route of Administration:           Oral, fed 1 lb/day
</pre>
<p>
A cattle tissue residue study was conducted in which unlabeled bambermycins 
was fed to one animal at 0 mg/hd/day and to six animals at 400 mg/hd/day (400 
mg/hd/day is 20 times the highest approved dose). Six animals were fed 400 
mg/hd/day for sixty-six (66) days. The animals were slaughtered while on 
medication (no withdrawal). After a 66-day feeding period no bambermycins 
residues were found in the kidney, liver, muscle, skin and fat from these 
treated animals.<p>

Because a study in cattle showed that residues are below the detection limit 
of the method (0.0125 ppm), a tolerance will not be set and a method will not 
be required. Since the actual residue levels are far lower than the calculated 
safe concentration and safe concentrations are limited to the level of 
residues that is required for appropriate use of the drug, the 35 ppm 
concentration will not be assigned to bambermycins. A safe concentration of 3 
ppm in muscle is being assigned instead. This level permits the appropriate 
use in the target species and is consistent with current concepts concerning 
allowable residues of antibiotics in food-producing animals.<p>

D.	Withdrawal Time:<p>
A zero (0) withdrawal time is established for bambermycins because no residues 
are found in any tissue after bambermycins is fed at many times the approved 
use level.<p>

E.	Studies were conducted to determine the effect of bambermycins on 
the quantity, prevalence, and duration of salmonella shedding and on
antimicrobial resistance in indigenous coliforms and salmonella in 
cattle (J. Anim. Sci. 44(5): 734 and J. Anim. Sci. 45(6): 1239). These 
studies were conducted to meet the requirements of 21 CFR 558.15. The use of
bambermycins in cattle feed did not increase the quantity, prevalence or duration of
salmonella shedding. There was no increase in the frequency of
resistance in the indigenous coliforms or salmonella.<p>

F.	Regulatory Methods:<p>
A regulatory tissue assay method is not required because of the establishment of a zero
(0) withdrawal period in cattle. However, the research method, a microbiological assay
method is used to assay tissues for bambermycins residues. The method titled,
"Quantitative Agar Well Plate Assay of Bambermycins (Flavomycin)in Organs and Tissues" is
on file at the Center for Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish
Place, Rockville, MD. 20855.<p>

<B>7. Aqency Conclusions:</B><p>

This supplemental NADA satisfies the requirements of section 512(b) of the 
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and demonstrates that bambermycins 
(Flavomycin &#174;  )when used under the proposed conditions of use is safe and 
effective for the labeled indications.<p>

Under the Center for Veterinary Medicine's supplemental new animal drug 
application policy (21 CFR 514.106), this is a Category II change providing 
for the use of bambermycins in feedlot cattle. However, this action did not 
require a reevaluation of the safety and effectiveness data in the parent 
application.<p>

Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 
this approval for food producing animals qualifies for three years of 
marketing exclusivity beginning on the date of approval because the 
supplemental application contains reports of new clinical or field 
investigations and human food safety studies essential to the approval of the 
application and conducted or sponsored by
the applicant. The three years of marketing exclusivity applies only to the 
claims of increased rate of weight gain and improved feed efficiency in cattle 
fed in confinement for slaughter for which the application was approved.<p>

<B>FREEDOM OF INFORMATION SUMMARY</B><p>
<B>NADA number:  140-856<p></B>

<B>1.	General Information:</B><p>


Sponsor:	<p>
Intervet, Inc.<br>
405 State Street, P.O. Box 318<br>
Millsboro, DE 19966<p>

Established Name: Serum gonadotropin and chorionic gonadotropin for injection<p>

Trade Name:           	 P.G. 600&#174;<p>

Marketing Status:    	OTC<p>
Date: AUG 30 1993<p>
Effect of Supplement:<p>	The original application provides for use of P.G.600&#174;  
in prepuberal gilts. The supplement extends the conditions of use to include 
sows at weaning.<p>

<B>2.    Indications for use:</B><p>

PREPUBERAL GILTS: P.G. 600&#174;  is indicated for induction of fertile estrus 
(heat) in healthy prepuberal (non-cycling) gilts over five and one-half months 
of age and weighing at least 85 kg (187 lb.). CAUTION: Treatment will not 
induce estrus in gilts that have already reached puberty (begun to cycle). 
Gilts that are less than five and one-half months of age or that weigh less 
than 85 kg (187 lb.) may not be mature enough to continue normal estrus cycles 
or maintain a normal pregnancy to full term after treatment.<p>

SOWS AT WEANING: P.G. 600&#174;  is indicated for induction of estrus in healthy 
weaned sows experiencing delayed return to estrus. CAUTION: Treatment will not 
induce estrus in sows that are returning to estrus normally three to seven 
days after weaning. Delayed return to estrus is most prevalent after the first 
litter; the effectiveness of P.G. 600&#174;  has not been established after later 
litters.  Delayed return to estrus often occurs during periods of adverse 
environmental conditions and sows mated under such conditions may farrow 
smaller than normal litters.<p>

<B>3.    Dosage Forms, Route of Administration and Dosage:</B><p>

P.G. 600&#174;  is available in two package sizes:<p>

SINGLE DOSE VIALS - Five vials containing white freeze dried powder, plus five 
vials containing sterile diluent. When reconstituted, each single dose vial (5 
mL) contains 400 IU serum gonadotropin and 200 IU chorionic gonadotropin 
(equivalent to 200 USP Units chorionic gonadotropin).<p>

FIVE DOSE VIALS - One vial containing white freeze dried powder, and one vial 
containing sterile diluent. When reconstituted, the five dose vial (25 mL) 
contains 2000 IU serum gonadotropin and 1000 IU chorionic gonadotropin 
(equivalent to 1000 USP Units chorionic gonadotropin).<p>

One dose (5 mL) of reconstituted P.G. 600&#174; , containing 400 IU serum 
gonadotropin and 200 IU chorionic gonadotropin, should be injected into the 
gilt or sow's neck behind the ear with a 20G X 1.5 inch hypodermic needle. 
Prepuberal gilts should be injected when they are selected for addition to the 
breeding herd. Sows should be injected at weaning during periods of delayed 
return to post-weaning estrus.<p>

<B>4.     Effectiveness:<p>
</B>
The original application contains data establishing that P.G. 600&#174;  is 
effective for induction of fertile estrus in healthy prepuberal gilts and that 
the recommended dose of P.G. 600&#174;  contains the optimal amount of each 
gonadotropin for that indication.<p>

Pivotal Studies in Sows<p>

A two-phase clinical study was conducted to establish that P.G. 600&#174;  is also 
effective for induction of estrus in healthy weaned sows experiencing delayed 
return to estrus, and to confirm that the dose of P.G. 600&#174;  recommended for 
induction of estrus in prepuberal gilts is also the optimal dose for this 
indication. Phase I was conducted from September, 1985 to August, 1986, and 
included 473 sows on 4 farms in Missouri and North Carolina. Phase II was 
conducted from July to December, 1987, and included 822 sows on 8 farms in 
Indiana, Missouri and North Carolina.<p>

The trials in Indiana were conducted by L. Kirk Clark, D.V.M., Ph.D., 
Associate Professor of Veterinary Medicine at Purdue University; the trials in 
Missouri were conducted by Billy N. Day, Ph.D., Professor of Animal Science, 
and Ronald O. Bates, Ph.D., State Swine Breeding Specialist, at the University 
of Missouri - Columbia; and the trials in North Carolina were conducted by 
Jack H. Britt, Ph.D., Professor of Animal Science at North Carolina State 
University.<p>

Sows at weaning on each farm either served as controls or received a single 
full dose of P.G. 600&#174;  (the "Field Trials"), and additional sows on one farm 
in each state also received either one-half dose of P.G. 600&#174;  or a double 
dose of P.G. 600&#174;, and the control sows on these farms received a placebo 
(the "Dose Confirmations").<p>

The sows were observed for estrus, and those in estrus were mated and allowed 
to farrow. Estrus response during Days 3-7 post-weaning was studied, and among 
sows in estrus during Days 3-7, percent of sows rebred after first mating, 
percent of sows farrowed after any mating, number of live pigs per litter, and 
number of dead pigs per litter were analyzed.<p>

Estrus response was studied with linear modeling and logistic regression, 
using a backward elimination procedure. Data for sows that exhibited estrus 
before Day 3 were deleted, and data for the remaining sows were coded as 
either "0" (anestrus during Days 3-7) or "1" (in estrus during Days 3-7). The 
parity of each sow was also coded as either "1" (Parity 1) or "2+" (Parity 2 
or greater). The full model included: Treatment (Dose), Parity, and Treatment 
x Parity interaction.<p>

Parity was considered as both an effect modifier and a confounder: Effect 
modification was defined as a significant interaction term (P is less than 0.05) and if 
the interaction term was not significant, it was removed from the model.  
Confounding was defined as a two-fold change, or a change in sign, in the odds 
ratio for Treatment if Parity was removed from the model. If confounding was 
not present, Parity was also removed from the model. The 95 percent confidence 
intervals on the odds ratios for the comparisons of interest were then 
examined, and if the confidence interval for a given ratio excluded 1.0, it 
was considered statistically significant.<p>

Percents of sows rebred and farrowed, and numbers of live and dead pigs per 
litter, were analyzed in ordinary least-squares analyses of variance for the 
randomized complete-block design, with farms as blocks. Percents were 
transformed with the arcsine transformation and numbers were transformed as 
the natural logarithm of the number plus 1. The model included: Farm, Month 
and Year of treatment nested within Farm, Treatment, Farm by Treatment 
interaction, Parity, Farm by Parity interaction, and Treatment by Parity 
interaction.<p>

Least-squares means and their 95 percent confidence intervals were generated, 
and differences between the means were tested for significance (P is less than 0.05) with 
the Protected Least Significant Difference (Protected LSD) Test: If Treatment 
by Parity interaction was significant (P is less than 0.10), differences between means for 
Treatments within Parities were tested; if Treatment by Parity interaction was 
not significant, but Treatment was significant (P is less than 0.05), differences between 
main effect means for Treatment were tested; and if neither Treatment by 
Parity interaction or Treatment was significant, differences were not tested.<p>

In Phase I, treatment with P.G. 600&#174;  did not affect estrus response during 
Days 3-7.  Nor did treatment with P.G. 600&#174;  affect percent of sows rebred, percent of 
sows farrowed, or number of dead pigs per litter among sows in estrus Days 3-
7. In the Dose Confirmation, however, sows that received the full dose of P.G. 
600&#174;  farrowed larger live litters than sows that received the other dose 
levels of P.G. 600&#174;  (Table 1).<p>

The study confirmed published reports cited in the supplemental application 
that sows must be experiencing delayed return to estrus if they are to respond 
to exogenous gonadotropins such as those in P.G. 600&#174;, and that delayed 
return to estrus is more prevalent after the first litter than after later 
litters. Therefore, the results of the study establish that P.G. 600&#174;  is 
effective for induction of estrus in those weaned sows that are experiencing 
delayed return to estrus, and that the dose of P.G. 600&#174;  recommended for 
induction of estrus in prepuberal gilts is also the optimal dose for this 
indication.<p>

Published reports were also cited in the supplemental application that delayed 
return to estrus often results from adverse environmental conditions, such as 
high ambient temperatures, which may also reduce live litter size.<p>

<B>5.	Animal Safety:</B><p>

The original application contains data confirming the safety of the new animal 
drug in both gilts and sows.  Those conclusions may be found in the original 
application's F.O.I. summary.  Therefore, no additional animal safety studies 
were required to support the supplemental application.<p>

<B>6.	Human Food Safety:</B><p>

Toxicity Tests and Residue Studies<p>

The original application contains data showing the human food safety of P.G. 
600&#174;. No additional human food safety studies were required to support the 
supplemental application.<p>

<B>7.	Agency Conclusions:</B><p>

This supplemental NADA satisfies the requirements of section 512(b) of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and demonstrates that P.G. 600&#174;  (Serum 
gonadotropin and chorionic gonadotropin), when used under the proposed 
conditions of use is safe and effective for the labeled indications.<p>

Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this 
is a Category II change. The approval of this change is not expected to have 
an adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug. 
Accordingly, this approval did not require a reevaluation of the safety and 
effectiveness data in the parent application.<p>

P.G. 600&#174;  is categorized for over-the-counter use marketing status. Adequate 
directions for use are provided on the label such that the layman can safely 
and effectively administer the product. The conditions for use, prescribed on 
the label, are likely to be followed in practice by producers. The product is 
for production purposes (induction of estrus) with no special training 
required for proper use.<p>

<B>Freedom of Information Summary</B><p>
<B>NADA No.:	111-798</B><p>

<B>I.      General Information:</B><P>

Sponsor:<p>
Miles, inc.<br>
Agriculture Division<br>

Shawnee Mission, Kansas 66201<p>
	
Generic Name: Praziquantel<p>
	
Trade Name: Droncit &#174  Feline Cestocide Tablets<p>

Effect of Supplement:<p>
This supplement amends the NADA to provide for a
11.5 mg spherical tablet, which is half the concentration of the previously 
approved 23 mg tablet, for cats.<p>

<B>II.	Indications for Use:</B><p>

	The indications for use remain the same as currently approved. Droncit 
Feline Cestocide Tablets are indicated for the removal of the following feline 
cestodes: Dipylidium caninum and Taenia taeniaeformis.<p>

<B>III.	Dosage Forms, Routes of Administration and Recommended Dosages:</B><p>

	The 11.5 mg tablet is administered orally to cats 4 pounds and under.<p>

<B>IV & V.	Safety and Effectiveness:</B><p>

	The approval of the 11.5 mg tablet did not require safety and 
effectiveness data. The approval was based on an environmental assessment, 
labeling, and manufacturing information on containers/closures, dissolution, 
and stability of the 11.5 mg tablets.<p>

<B>VI.	Human Safety:</B><p>

A.   Human Food Safety<p>

Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food,
were not required for approval of this supplement. The drug is used in
cats, which are non-food animals.<p>

B.   Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration<p>

The labeling contains adequate directions for use and thus poses no human 
safety hazard.<p>

<B>VII.	Agency Conclusions:</B><p>

Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (<B>55 FR 46045</B>: codified at <B>21 
CFR 514.106</B>), published November 1, 1990, this is a Category II change because 
it provides for a new tablet size. The approval of this supplemental new 
animal drug application is supported by adequate safety and effectiveness data 
for this new animal drug. Accordingly, this approval did not require a re-
evaluation of the safety and effectiveness data in the parent application. 
Under section 512 (c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F), this approval does not qualify for any term of 
marketing exclusivity because no new clinical or field investigations 
conducted by the sponsor were essential to the approval of this supplemental 
NADA.<p>

The expertise of a trained professional is required for a definitive 
diagnosis, to monitor the results of treatment, and determine the occurrence 
of adverse effects; therefore, the drug is a prescription product.<p>

<B>4. EFFECTIVENESS:</B><p>

Background<p>

The usual methods of establishing efficacy in domesticated animals were not feasible 
in zoo and wildlife animals. Difficulty of restraint for dosing, absence of disease models 
and inability to necropsy selected animals for worm counts due to the animals' intrinsic 
value precluded the most direct method of assessing efficacy. Efficacy in exotic 
ruminants was assessed by the measurement of parasite ova counts determined 
before and after treatment. The efficacy of fenbendazole in bighorn sheep (<I>Ovis </I>
<I>canadensis canadensis</I>) was provided through <B>Public Master File 5071</B>.<p>
1. Suidae<p>

Safe-Guard &#174;  is approved in domestic swine (<B>49 FR 3846, Jan. 31, 1984</B>) with a 
treatment regimen of 3 mg/kg bw daily for 3 days for removal and control of large 
roundworms (<I>Ascaris suis</I>), nodular worms (<I>Oesophagostomum dentatum</I> and <I>O. 
quadrispinulatum</I>), small stomach worms (<I>Hyostrongylus rubidus</I>), kidneyworms 
(mature and immature <I>Stephanurus dentatus</I>), and lungworms (<I>Metastrongylus apri</I>). 
Many of these parasites occur in wild suidae.<p>

Study No.:                       1008/76/1-E

Starting Date:                   May,1979

End Date:                        Oct. 1979

Study Director:                  H.N. Becker, DVM, E. R. Bradley, DVM

Test Substance and 
   Dosage Form:                  Fenbendazole from 20% premix (Type A Medicated Article)
   
Animal Species:                  Feral swine 

Number of Animals:               20 feral swine (10 per treatment group) 

Drug level tested 
  & Duration of Dosing:          0 and 3 mg/kg bw x 3 days
  
Route of Administration:         Oral, via the feed
</pre>

A pivotal controlled study in Feral Pigs by Drs. H.N. Becker and E.R. Bradley, College 
of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL involved a naturally 
occurring infestation of <I>Stephanurus dentatus</I> and <I>Ascaris suum</I>. One group of ten 
(10) feral swine was given 3 mg/kg bw Safe-Guard daily for 3 days in the feed. A 
second group of 10 animals served as untreated controls. Both groups were 
necropsied three weeks later and examined for evidence of adult and larval kidney 
worms. Non-treated pigs showed evidence of infection (live worms) in the perirenal 
and ureteral areas, while treated animals were devoid of live worms. Live kidneyworm 
larvae were found in the livers of untreated animals while treated pigs did not harbor such larvae. Urine 
samples from 8/10 treated animals were devoid of kidneyworm eggs while 8/9 control 
(non-treated) swine had <I>S. dentatus</I> eggs in their urine.<P>

A complete reduction of ascarid and nodular worm eggs was observed in treated pigs. 
The results indicated that the drug was 100% effective in reducing the number of 
ascarid and nodular worm eggs.<P>

2. Ruminants<P>

Ruminants constitute the largest number of animals in zoo and wildlife park 
environments and represent the class of animals in which fenbendazole has been 
most thoroughly investigated. Fenbendazole is approved in domestic cattle (<B>53 FR 
14788, April 26, 1988</B>) at a level of 5 mg/kg bw against the common nematodes.<P>

End Date:                        Oct. 1987

Study Director:                  D. Janssen, DVM and J. Allen, DVM
 
Test Substance
  & Dosage Form:                 Fenbendazole from 4% Premix (Type A Medicated Article)
  
Animal Species:                  Zoo animals (nondomestic ruminants)
 
Number of Animals:               55 nondomestic ruminants (37 antilopinae, 12 hippotraginae and 6 caprines)

Drug level tested 
  and Duration of Dosing:        2.5 mg/kg bw x 3 days
  
Route of Administration:         Oral via the feed
</pre>

A pivotal study was conducted by Dr. Janssen, San Diego Wild Animal Park, 
Escondido, CA 92027. A total of 55 animals out of a population of 1000 kept in 
pastures ranging from 20-120 acres were randomly selected for this study. Among the 
37 antilopinae were 2 Indian blackbuck, 2 Kenya Impala, 9 Persian Gazelles, 6 
Slenderhorn Gazelles, 5 Roosevelt Gazelles, 5 Thompson's Gazelles, 6 Addra 
Gazelles and 2 Mhorr Gazelles. The hippotraginae sub-family included 3 Addax, 2 
Roan Antelope, 5 Fringe Eared Oryx and 2 Arabian Oryx for a total of 12. The third 
sub-family, caprinae, included 2 Armenian Moufflon and 4 Russian Saiga.<p>

4% Fenbendazole Premix was mixed into the feed and pelleted to provide a level of 
7.5 mg/kg bw total dose. This feed, after assay, was available over a 3 day period and 
consumption/dose ingested measured by dividing the dose of fenbendazole 
consumed by the estimated biomass for that enclosure. Fecal examinations were 
conducted 2-14 days before and 5-20 days after treatment ended. Results of treatment 
are summarized in Table 1.<p>

Efficacy of the premix against endoparasites in the ruminants was determined by 
comparison with pre- and post-treatment fecal egg counts. Dosages calculated from 
feed consumption percentages were 3.6 to 8.5 mg/kg. Dosages of less than 5 mg/kg resulted in 
80% to 100% reductions in fecal egg counts, and dosages of greater than 5 mg/kg resulted in 
98% to 100% reductions in fecal egg counts. With all dosage groups considered, 
<I>Strongyloides</I> and <I>Nematodirus</I> eggs were the most sensitive to treatment, with 100% 
reductions in fecal egg counts. Strongyle and <I>Trichuris</I> egg counts were reduced 90% 
and 96% respectively.<p>

The dose of fenbendazole for exotic ruminants is based on the differences in efficacy 
noted against the common parasites when comparing a dose of less than 5 mg/kg total dose 
over a three-day period with a dose of greater than 5 mg/kg total dose over a three-day period 
(Janssen,
D.L 1985. JAVMA 187: 1189). The efficacy surpassed 90% when fenbendazole was
administered at greater than 5 mg/kg; whereas, the efficacy was less than 90% when doses less than 5
mg/kg were administered. In order to assure that a sufficient dose is ingested by each
member of a herd, a dose of 7.5 mg/kg over a three-day period (2.5 mg/kg/day) was
selected.<p>

<B>5. ANIMAL SAFETY</B><p>

Animal safety has been adequately addressed for all species included in the 
supplemental NADA. Safety studies for bighorn sheep (<I>Ovis canadensis canadensis</I>) 
are included in Public Master File 5071, and those studies are described in a Freedom 
of Information Summary. Safety in feral swine (<I>Suis scrofa)</I> is based on data contained 
in this NADA for domestic swine.<p>

The following ruminants were treated in this Target Animal Safety Study:<p>

Thomson's Gazelle (<I>Gazella thomsoni thomsoni</I>)<br>
Bongo (<I> Tragelaphus eurycerus</I>)<br>
Addax (<I>Addax nasomaculatus</I>)<br>
Aoudad (<I>Ammotragus lervia</I>)<br>
Pere David Deer (<I>Elaphurus davidianus</I>)<br>
Sable Antelope (<I>Hippotragus niger</I>)<br>
Guanaco (<I>Lama glama guanacoe</I>)<br>
Hartman's Mountain Zebra (<I>Equus zebra hartman</I>)<br>
Camel (<I>Camelus dromedarius</I>)<br>
Blesbock (<I>Damaliscus dorcas phillipsi</I>)<p>

This study was conducted by R. B. Burns, DVM at the Louisville Zoological Gardens, 
Louisville, KY. A total of 58 animals were given fenbendazole in this study. 
Fenbendazole premix (Type A Medicated Article) was mixed into the standard 
supplemental zoo ration in use at the Louisville Zoo. After blending, the medicated 
ration was pelleted. The pelleted ration was assayed for fenbendazole content. 
Enough medicated feed was provided to achieve the 15X and 30X dose based on the 
expected fenbendazole concentration in the feed. Actual fenbendazole recovery from 
the feed varied from 76.7% to 86.7% of the expected value. Therefore, the actual dose 
that animals received is based on the feed assay recoveries as summarized in Tables 
2 and 3.<p>

The actual excess intake of fenbendazole ranged from 2.3X to 22.5X for the animals 
(Table 2) in the drug tolerance 30X treatment group (75 mg/kg bw x 3 days). The 
excess intake of fenbendazole ranged from 1.6X to 17.7X for the animals (Table 3) in 
the 15X treatment group (37.5 mg/kg bw x 9 days). Ingestion of both the medicated 
and non-medicated feed varied resulting in variable intake of fenbendazole as 
indicated in Tables 2 and 3. Minimum required intakes over 3X and 5X were achieved 
in all animal groups with the exception of the Pere David Deer. The Pere David Deer 
also failed to completely consume their usual unmedicated ration.<p>

There were no clinically apparent adverse effects observed in any animal during the 
trial. The usual methods of establishing safety in domesticated animals, including 
routine bloodwork and necropsies, were not feasible in the animals in this study due to 
animals' intrinsic value.<p>

<B>6. HUMAN SAFETY</B>

This supplement is for use of fenbendazole in hoofed zoo and wildlife animals. 
Because these types of animals do not constitute a component of the human diet, 
residue and metabolism studies were not required to support approval of this 
supplement to NADA 131-675. To cover the possibility that the fenbendazole premix 
may be used to treat animals in the wild that are hunted, the product is restricted from 
use for 14 days prior to and during the hunting season. The 1 4-day period provides 
an interval for residues of fenbendazole to deplete from animals that might be hunted 
and then used for food purposes.<p>

<B>7. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</B>

The data in support of this supplemental NADA complies with the requirements of 
Section 51 2 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations. It 
demonstrates that Safe-Guard &#174;  medicated premix (4%, 8%, and 20% fenbendazole 
premix) when used under the labeled conditions in indicated zoo and wildlife species 
is safe and effective.<p>

According to the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106), this is a 
Category II change. This supplement provides for the minor use claim as a dewormer 
in zoo and wildlife animals. The approval of this change has no adverse effect on the 
safety and effectiveness of the animal drug. Accordingly, this approval did not require 
a reevaluation of the safety and effectiveness data in the parent application.<p>

Under section 51 2(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, this 
approval for non-food producing animals qualifies for THREE years of marketing 
exclusivity beginning on the date of approval because the supplemental application 
contains reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence 
studies) essential to the approval of the application and conducted or sponsored by 
the applicant. The three years of marketing exclusivity applies only to the new species 
and claims for which the supplemental application was approved.<p>

The original NADA is labeled for OTC distribution. The current supplement maintains 
OTC status. The statement, "Consult your veterinarian for assistance in the diagnosis, 
treatment, and control of parasitism", appears on the labeling.<p>

The product will be used primarily by individuals with specialized training in the care 
and management of rare and exotic species and wildlife animals. If a condition 
develops that could be confused with parasitic infection, this statement addresses 
recommendations to assist these individuals.<p>

<B>2. Indications for Use</B>:<p>

Panacur &#174;  (fenbendazole) is used for control of the following
internal parasites in the families Felidae and Ursidae.<p>

Felidae:<p> Lion (<I>Panthera leo</I>). For control of ascarids
(<I>Toxocara cati</I>, <I>Toxascaris leonina</I>), hookworms
(<I>Ancylostoma spp.</I>).

spp.</I>)

Cheetah (<I>Acinonyx jubatus</I>). For control of ascarids
(<I>Toxocara cati</I>, <I>Toxascaris leonina</I>).

Pumas (<I>Felis concolor</I>), Panthers (<I>Panthera spp.</I>),
Leopards (<I>Panthera pardus</I>), Jaguars (<I>Panthera onca</I>). For
control of ascarids (<I>Toxocara cati</I>, <I>Toxascaris leonina</I>),
hookworms (<I>Ancylostoma spp.</I>), tapeworms (<I>Taenia
hydatigena</I>, <I>T. krabbei</I>, <I>T. taeniaeformis</I>).<p>

Ursidae:<p> Black Bears (<I>Ursus americanus</I>). For control of

hookworms (<I>Ancylostoma caninum</I>), tapeworms (<I>Taenia
hydatigena</I>, <I>T. krabbei</I>).

Polar Bears (<I>Ursus maritimus</I>) and Grizzly Bears (<I>Ursus
horribilis</I>), for control of ascarid (<I>Baylisascaris
transfuga</I>, <I>Toxascaris leonina</I>).<p>

<B>3. Dosage Forms, Routes of Administration and Recommended Dosages:</B><p>

A.Dosage Form: 22.2% Granules<p>

Route of Administration: Orally, mixed with food or as a top
dressing.<p>

Recommended Dosage: Felidae and Ursidae: 10 mg/kg/bw daily for
3 days.<p>

<B>4. Effectiveness</B>:<p>

The effectiveness of fenbendazole as an anthelmintic in Felidae
and Ursidae is established by data from six controlled studies.
There are three studies involving 29 members of the family
Felidae and three studies involving 26 members of the family
Ursidae. The Ursidae studies involved administration of
the drug for two days. There was 100% reduction in ascarid ova
observed for some of the studies in bears while an 80% reduction of
ascarid ova was observed in one study; whereas, there was 100%
reduction in <I>Ancylostoma</I> and <I>Taenia</I> spp. ova in the
studies where they were observed. Because of the lack of substantial
adverse effects and in order to assure that bears consume an adequate
dose for ascarids, bears should be treated for three days which is the
labeled duration of treatment in the major species for which the drug
is labeled.<p>

Critical trials in minor species are often not feasible due to obvious
difficulty in obtaining adequate numbers and the value of the animals.
Therefore, each animal served as its own control as authorized under
21 CFR 514.111(a)(5)(ii)(a)(2)(iii). The control procedure used was a
comparison of pre and post treatment parasite ova counts. Pre and post
treatment ova counts is the most appropriate control procedure
available for species included under wild Felidae and
Ursidae.<p>

Although false positive and false negative fecal samples do occur, the
pronounced difference in pre versus post treatment values in greater
than 90% of animals tested significantly illustrates the effectiveness
of Panacur &#174;  when administered according to label instructions.
Statistical methodology was not applied to these studies because the
animals served as their own controls and the results are obvious.<p>

Well controlled data supporting the approval of fenbendazole in major
species (<B>21 CFR 520.905</B>) horses, cattle, domestic dogs and swine) have
demonstrated substantial evidence of efficacy.<p>

A. Felidae<p>

1. Dr. P. J. Knapmann<br>
 Six Flags Great Adventure<br>
  Jackson, N.J. 08527<p>

A pivotal clinical field trial providing evidence for efficacy and
safety of Panacur &#174;  was conducted on four (4) lions and seventeen
(17) Siberian tigers. Fecal samples were obtained on 4 lions and 6 of
17 Siberian tigers. The four lions were positive for <I>Toxascaris</I>
pre-treatment. Fenbendazole was administered at a dosage of 10
mg/kg/bw daily for three (3) days.<p>

In the lions, there were no ova seen on day 7 post treatment, but
reappearance at day 30 post-treatment. One animal was also
positive for <I>Toxocara</I> at day 30.<p>

Four of the 6 Siberian tiger samples were positive for
<I>Toxascaris</I> pre-treatment. All 17 animals were treated,
and fecal samples from the six animals were negative for
<I>Toxascaris</I> at days 7 and 30. Unspecified tapeworm segments were
noted at day 7 in two of the samples. There were no were (sic) side
effects noted.<p>

2. Dr. William Foster<br>
Louisville Zoological Gardens<br>
1100 Trevilian
Way, Louisville, KY 40213<p>

This pivotal clinical field trial providing evidence for efficacy and
safety of Panacur &#174;  included 5 (five) Siberian tigers. They included
animals of both sexes and ranged in age from 1 1/2 years to 10 years
old. The animals weighed 250 lbs. to 400 lbs. Pre-treatment 
fecal examination revealed the presence of <I>ascarid</I> spp.
Treatment of the tigers with a dose of 10 mg/kg/bw (one animal
received 13.3 mg/kg) daily for three days resulted in total reduction
of ova shedding at days 7 and 14 post-treatment. There were no
adverse reactions noted.<p>

3. Mr. Gerald Brady<br>
 Bear Country, U.S.A.<br>
  Rapid City, S.D. 57709<p>

This pivotal clinical field trial providing evidence of efficacy and
safety of Panacur &#174;  included 13 (thirteen) pumas. Pre-treatment 
fecal examinations of six of the pumas revealed the presence of ova
from <I>Toxocara</I>, <I>Toxascaris</I>, <I>Ancylostoma</I>, and
<I>Taenia</I> spp. Treatment with Panacur &#174;  at 10 mg/kg/bw daily for
three (3) days resulted in total elimination of ova shedding at day 7
post-treatment for <I>Toxocara</I>, <I>Toxascaris</I>, and
<I>Taenia</I>. There was one animal positive for <I>Ancylostoma</I>
spp. pre-treatment and one animal positive for
<I>Ancylostoma</I> spp. post-treatment. All but two of the
animals took the drug without hesitation. There were several reports
of loose stools among the pumas ingesting the Panacur &#174;  granules.<p>

B. Ursidae<p>

1. Mr. Gerald Brady<br>
M.S. Bear Country U.S.A.<br>
Rapid City, S.D. 57709<p>

This pivotal clinical field trial providing evidence of efficacy and
safety of Panacur &#174;  consisted of 105 (one hundred five) bears of
which 20 (twenty) had pre-treatment fecal exams examined for
parasite ova. Sixteen of the twenty were positive for ascarids,
<I>Ancylostoma</I>, and/or <I>Taenia</I> spp.. The bears were
treated with Panacur &#174;  orally at a dose level of 10 mg/kg/bw daily for two days.
Results demonstrated a 100% reduction in ova shedding for
<I>Ancylostoma</I> and <I>Taenia</I> spp. and 80% reduction in ascarid
ova. All but two animals took the drug without hesitation. There were
several reports of loose stools among the bears ingesting the
Panacur &#174;  granules.<p>

2. Dr. P. J. Knapmann<br>
Six Flags Great Adventure<br>
Jackson, N.J. 08527<p>

This pivotal clinical field trial providing evidence of efficacy and
safety of Panacur &#174;  consisted of seven (7) brown bears. Fecal counts
were conducted on seven animals and three were positive for ascarids
and one for Ancylostoma spp. ova. Treatment consisted of fenbendazole
administered at a rate of 10 mg/kg/bw daily for two consecutive days.
This treatment resulted in 100% negative stools at 7 and 30 days post-
treatment. There were no reported adverse effects.<p>

3. Dr. William Foster<br>
Louisville Zoological Gardens<br>
 Louisville, KY  40213<p>

This pivotal clinical field trial providing evidence of efficacy and
safety of Panacur &#174;  included two female and one male 7 and 8 year old
polar bears weighing 400 lbs to 600 lbs, which were diagnosed via pre-
treatment fecal exams as having ascarid spp. Treatment consisted
of administering Panacur &#174;  granules at 10 mg/kg/bw daily for two
days. Results, as measured by detection of ova shedding, indicate that
the drug was 100% effective at 7 and 14 days post treatment.<p>

<B>Corroborative Studies</B><p>

1. Dr. William Foster<br>
 Louisville, Zoological Gardens<br>
  1100 Trevilian Way<br>
   Louisville, KY 40213<p>

This corroborates field trial included one male and one female
cheetah, both 5 years old and weighing 80 lbs to 85 lbs, which showed
evidence of <I>Toxascaris</I> ova on pretreatment fecal examination.
They were treated with 6.5 mg/kg/bw for one day and did not show
evidence of ova shedding when feces were examined on days 7 and 14.
There were no reports of adverse effects.<p>

2. Professor K. Enigk<br>
 Parasitology Institute<br>
  University of Hannover<br>
   W. Germany<p>

This corroborative field trial involved sixty-six (66) animals
including 25 lions, 20 tigers, 10 pumas, 4 leopards, 1 black panther,
and 6 jaguars. A dose level of 10 mg/kg/bw for one treatment proved to
be effective in the above species against <I>Toxascaris</I> spp. This
level did not provide acceptable efficacy against <I>Toxocara</I> or
<I>Ancylostoma</I> spp. Ten mg/kg/bw daily for three (3) days provided
100% reduction in <I>Toxocara</I>, <I>Toxascaris</I>, and
<I>Ancylostoma</I> spp. infections in the 11 tigers dosed for that
time period.<p>

3. Dr. D. C. Hall<br>
 Vilas Park Zoo<br> 
 Madison, Wisconsin 53715<p>

The corroborative study involved one polar bear (weighing 797 lbs) and
two grizzly bears (weighing 175 lbs). Pre-treatment fecal
examination of the polar bear and one grizzly bear was positive for
ascarid shedding. Animals were dosed at a level of 10 mg/kg/bw daily
for two days. Post treatment fecal examination of the polar bear was
negative at days 7, 14, and 21. The grizzly bear continued to shed
diminishing numbers of ova on days 7 and 14, and becoming negative at
day 21.<p>

<B>Efficacy Summary Statement</B><p>

Efficacy studies submitted to support the use of Panacur &#174;  granules
in wild Felidae and Ursidae were conducted using fecal
egg counts to monitor effectiveness. The traditional controlled
efficacy study (where animals are sacrificed and worms are counted)
could not be used in these studies due to the rarity and high value of
the animals. Parasites were often only identified to the genus level
(and sometimes only to order level, i.e. ascarids) from egg
identification following fecal examination. This was done because of
the relative host specificity and likelihood of helminth species
affecting wild Felidae and Ursidae. Based on the
following references, the species that would be expected to be found
in wild Felidae and Ursidae and against which Panacur &#174; 
would expect to have efficacy based on the studies conducted, are used
in the label indications.<p>

Felidae<p>

For ascarid species in Felidae <I>Toxocara cati</I></I> <I>and
Toxascaris leonina</I> are both common and either or both species
could be present in animals at any location or from any sources
(Soulsby).<p>

The identification of <I>Taenia</I> spp. is used based on the fact
that one of several species may be present, and the actual
distribution of different species in wild Felidae has not been
fully delineated. Identification of species by egg examination is
impossible.<p>

For hookworm species, <I>Ancylostoma tubaeforme</I>, <I>A.
braziliense</I>, <I>A. paraduodenale</I> or <I>A. ceylanicum</I> may
be present depending on geographic location of the zoo or the
source of the animal (Soulsby). The eggs of these species cannot be
distinguished from one another; therefore, the designation of
<I>Ancylostoma</I> spp. is given on the label. This is also the
designation used by Fowler (see reference).<p>

Ursidae<p>

In Ursidae, the most common ascarid species is <I>Baylisascaris
transfuga</I>, being nearly ubiquitous (Soulsby, Pence et al).
<I>Toxascaris leonina</I>, might be expected from black bears in
southern coastal regions (Pence et al, Crum et al).<p>

Pence et al identified two species of <I>Taenia</I>, <I>T.
hydatigena</I> and <I>T. krabbei</I>. However, the researchers
indicated that species identification was not always possible and
groups these (and any other possible species) together as
<I>Taenia</I> spp.<p>

The hookworm species that has been identified in the black bear is
<I>A. caninum</I> (Pence et al, Crum et al) which is found in southern
regions.<p>

5. <B>Target Animal Safety</B><p>

1. Dr. William Foster<br>
 Louisville Zoological Garden<br>
  Louisville, KY  40213<p>

This study was a pivotal toxicity study providing information
supporting the safety of Panacur &#174;  granules in members of the
families Felidae and Ursidae. Five big cats, including
two jaguars, one puma, one lion, and one Siberian tiger representing
both sexes and ranging in age from 2 to 15 years of age were dosed
with the drug. Additionally, three polar bears ranging in age from 7
to 9 years of age and representing both sexes were dosed with 100
mg/kg/bw of the drug for four (4) days. The Felidae were dosed
with 100 mg/kg/bw for six (6) days.<p>

In one jaguar and the lion, there were periods of inappentence (sic)
following the initial consumption of fenbendazole at ten times the
recommended level. It is noted that the ambient temperature at the zoo
during this study was higher than normal; therefore, the role of the
extreme heat on appetite can be considered.<p>

Large cats offered 5X the dose for twice the duration and polar bears
dosed at 10X the dose for 1.33 times the duration provides evidence
that at exaggerated doses for greater than the indicated duration, the
drug is not associated with adverse reactions. The only remarkable
finding is that the overdosed animal may not consume the drug.<p>

Due to the nature of the study, safety parameters were limited to
those which could be obtained from clinical observation of the
animals. Necropsies were not necessary nor feasible because of the
absence of adverse effects and the value of the animals.<p>

Traditional clinical (laboratory) target animal toxicity studies would
ordinarily not be feasible for rare, exotic, or endangered wildlife
species. It is concluded that the safety of Panacur &#174;  granules in
members of the families Felidae and Ursidae is
demonstrated under actual conditions of use in clinical field trials
(see "Effectiveness" section).<p>

The margin of safety is demonstrated in a limited number of animals
which are dosed with ten (10) times the recommended amount of the
Panacur &#174;  granules for up to twice the recommended duration. The
nature of the animals being studied necessitated avoidance of
unacceptable or irreversible adverse reactions.<p>

<B>Human Safety</B>:<p>

This supplement is for use of this product in zoo and wildlife
animals. Because these types of animals do not constitute a component
of the human diet, residue and metabolism studies were not required to
support approval of the supplement to NADA 121-473. To cover the
possibility that the fenbendazole granules may be used to treat
animals in the wild that are hunted, the product is restricted from
use for 14 days prior to and during the hunting season. The 14-day
period provides an interval for residues of fenbendazole to deplete
from animals that might be hunted and then used for food purposes.<p>

<B>Agency Conclusions</B>:<p>

The data in support of this supplemental NADA complies with the
requirements of Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the
implementing regulations. It demonstrates that Panacur &#174;  granules
(22.2%) when used under the labeled conditions in indicated zoo and
wildlife species is safe and effective.<p>

According to the Center's supplemental approval policy (<B>21 CFR
514.106</B>), this is a Category II change. This supplement provides for
the minor use claim as a dewormer in zoo and wildlife animals. The
approval of this change has no adverse effect on the safety and
effectiveness of this new animal drug.<p>

Accordingly, this approval did not require a reevaluation of the
safety and effectiveness data in the parent application.<p>

Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act, this approval for non-food producing animals
qualifies for THREE years of marketing exclusivity beginning on the
date of approval because the supplemental application contains reports
of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence
studies) essential to the approval of the application and conducted or
sponsored by the applicant. The three years of marketing exclusivity
applies only to the new species and claims for which the supplemental
application was approved.<p>

The drug is restricted to use by or on the order of a licensed
veterinarian because professional expertise is required to determine
the existence of endoparasitic infections in these species and to
properly differentiate the most likely types of infections.<p>

<b>3. EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>

Efficacy was established in the approval under NADA 128-620 and its supplement
(48 FR 42809, September 20, 1983, and 53 FR 40058, October 13, 1988).  No new
studies were conducted to establish effectiveness associated with the use of
fenbendazole in dairy cattle of breeding age.<p>

<b>4. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY:</b><p>

Animal safety was established in the original approval under NADA
128-620 and its supplement (48 FR 42809, September 20, 1983, and 53 FR 40058,
October 13, 1988).  No new studies were conducted to establish animal safety
associated with the use of fenbendazole in dairy cattle of breeding age.<p>

<b>5. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>

A. Toxicity Tests:<p>

Toxicity and teratogenicity studies were presented in the original NADA 128-620
and were conducted in Hoechst Research Laboratories in Frankfurt, Germany and
in the United States.  Fenbendazole was determined to be safe to human health
when food derived from treated animals is ingested (48 FR 42809, September 20,
1983).<p>

B. Safe Concentrations and Tolerances<p>

Safe concentrations for fenbendazole total residues in cattle tissues were
established with the original NADA 128-620 and are listed below along with the
tissue consumption factors that were used.<p>

<pre>
Tissue			Safe Concentration

muscle			5 ppm
liver			10 ppm (factor of 2)
kidney			l5 ppm (factor of 3)
fat			20 ppm (factor of 4)

</pre>
The tolerance and marker residue for fenbendazole in cattle also were assigned
with the original NADA 128-620.  The tolerance in cattle liver (the target
tissue) is 0.8 ppm parent fenbendazole (the marker residue) as measured by the
regulatory assay.<p>

Newly established with this supplement to NADA 132-872 are a safe concentration
and a tolerance for residues of fenbendazole in milk.  The safe concentration
for fenbendazole total residues in milk is set at 1.67 ppm (1/3 of the 5 ppm
safe concentration in muscle tissue).  The 1.67 ppm value was determined using
FDA's approach to assigning safe concentrations based on food factors (44 FR
17070, March 20, 1979).<p>

As explained in Part C below, the marker residue for fenbendazole in milk is
the sulfoxide of parent fenbendazole.  The tolerance is assigned at 0.6 ppm,
although the marker residue never reaches that level in the milk from cattle
treated at the approved dosing rate of 5 mg/kg body weight.  The tolerance
value was calculated from the marker residue to total residue percentage when
total fenbendazole residues are at a maximum in milk.  That maximum occurs in
the range of 24 to 36 hours following dosing, and at that time, the sulfoxide
represents approximately 35% of the total residue present.  Accordingly, the
tolerance for the fenbendazole sulfoxide is set at 0.6 ppm (35% of the 1.67 ppm
safe concentration).<p>

C. Total Residue and Metabolism Studies<p>

Tissue residue depletion and metabolism studies in cattle were presented in the
original NADA 128-620.  Based on data from those studies, an eight (8) day
withdrawal time in edible tissues (muscle, liver, fat, kidney) was established
(48 FR 42809, September 20, 1983).  The total residue studies summarized below
were submitted with this supplement to describe fenbendazole residues in
milk.<p>

Milk Total Residue Study.<p>

A study designed to measure residues in milk from one untreated and five
^14C-fenbendazole-treated lactating dairy cattle was conducted to
determine the total residue profile as a function of time, to identify
metabolites of fenbendazole in milk, and to select a marker substance to
monitor residues in milk of lactating dairy cattle.<p>

</pre>
After an acclimatization period, a morning milk sample was taken from each cow
prior to treatment.  This sample served as a blank control for the study.
Following this milking, five cows received fenbendazole suspension by stomach
tube.  This aqueous suspension of labeled (^14C) fenbendazole and
unlabeled fenbendazole contained approximately 2 mCi activity/g.  The amount of
fenbendazole administered to each cow by stomach tube was calculated to equal
5.0 mg/kg body weight.  The stomach tube was flushed with suspension solution
to assure complete delivery.  A control cow received suspension solution which
did not contain fenbendazole.  Morning and afternoon milk samples were
collected for six days following drug administration.  After six days the
residues were below the level of detection.<p>

Total residues for each whole milk sample from each cow were determined by
scintillation counting.  Each sample was assayed in triplicate by dissolving
0.5 ml aliquots of blended sample in 12 ml of scintillation cocktail.  Before
counting, each sample was placed in the dark for one hour to reduce
contributions from chemiluminescence.  Selected whole milk samples were also
centrifuged, and 0.5 ml aliquots of fat and water portions were counted to
determine label distribution.<p>

For metabolic profiling, milk samples were extracted by matrix solid phase
dispersion (MSPD) techniques, and the absolute recovery of total label was
determined by scintillation counting of the extracts.  The distribution of the
extracted label between remaining parent drug and metabolites was determined by
HPLC analyses using UV diode array and in-line radiolabel detection.  The
identity of radiolabeled peaks was matched with known standards for the
metabolites of fenbendazole based on retention time and UV-diode array spectra.
Samples were also assayed quantitatively by HPLC using an internal
(mebendazole) standard and correcting for recovery.<p>

The results from the radiolabel assay for total residues in whole milk and the
HPLC analyses of metabolites in whole milk averaged for the five cows as a
function of time are presented in Table 1.<p>

<b>(1)</b> All residue levels were below the target of 0.83 ppm for the 1X tracer study
(one-half the 1.67 ppm established safe concentration).  No residues were
detected in milk from the placebo (control) cow.

<b>(2)</b> Ratio percent used to calculate tolerance level.
</pre>

At all times following administration of fenbendazole to lactating dairy
cattle, residues in milk of fenbendazole and its metabolites were below the
established safe concentration, and the total residue was evenly distributed
between the fat and aqueous fractions of the whole milk.<p>

Metabolic profiling of the total residues indicated that the concentration of
parent drug in milk was negligible.  The sulfoxide and sulfone metabolites of
fenbendazole were the compounds that contributed to milk residues.  The
sulfoxide metabolite of fenbendazole was established to be the marker residue
as it was present at levels significantly higher than parent fenbendazole or
its sulfone metabolite.  No other metabolites of fenbendazole were found in
milk.<p>

Milk Tolerance Calculation.<p>

In Table 1 above, the ratio percent value of fenbendazole sulfoxide, the marker
residue, to total residues was 35.4% at 36 hours following fenbendazole
administration.  At this time total residues in milk were greatest.  The
tolerance was calculated by multiplying the ratio percent of fenbendazole
sulfoxide to total residues by the safe concentration (1.67 ppm).  The
tolerance was established to be 0.6 ppm (600 ppb).<p>

D.  Calf Tissue Total Residue Study.<p>

A study was conducted to measure residues in calves born to ^14C
fenbendazole-treated dairy cattle.  Total residue profiles in calf liver,
kidney, fat and muscle were measured to provide data demonstrating the extent
to which fenbendazole and its metabolites are transferred to and retained by
the tissues of calves born to fenbendazole-treated cows.<p>

Route of Administration           Oral, administered once to the cow             

</pre>
Eight days prior to anticipated calving, six pregnant dairy cows were moved to
an approved facility for acclimation and for study conduct.  Three days after
the start acclimation, each cow was administered fenbendazole by stomach tube
at a dose calculated to equal 5.0 mg/kg body weight.  The drug was administered
as an aqueous suspension of labeled (^14C) and unlabeled fenbendazole
and contained approximately 2 mCi activity/g.  One of the six cows was
administered carrier only and was the control for the study.  The calf from the
control cow and calves from three cows receiving fenbendazole were delivered by
cesarean surgery approximately 70 hours after dosing; the other two calves from
treated cows were delivered by natural birth at 4 and 25 hours post-dosing.
One calf died 5 hours after delivery, three treated calves and the control calf
were sacrificed 24 hours after delivery, and one treated calf was sacrificed 48
hours after delivery.  Surviving calves received colostrum from treated dams
and milk replacer as needed for 24 to 48 hours after birth and prior to
sacrifice.<p>

Total residues for the described tissues were determined by oxidation of 0.5 g
tissue samples in triplicate and scintillation counting (Table 1).  Each sample
was placed in the dark for one hour to reduce contributions from
chemiluminescence.<p>

For metabolic profiling, liver tissue from one calf was extracted by matrix
solid phase dispersion (MSPD) techniques, and the absolute recovery of total
label was determined by scintillation counting of the extracts.  The
distribution of the extracted label between parent drug and metabolites was
determined by HPLC analyses using UV diode array and in-line radiolabel
detection.  The identity of radiolabeled peaks was matched with known standards
for the metabolites of fenbendazole based on retention time and UV-diode array
spectra.<p>

Results indicated that the label was distributed between the sulfone (34%) and
sulfoxide (58%) metabolites of fenbendazole and parent fenbendazole (8%).  No
other radiolabeled metabolites were observed in the liver.  Profiles of kidney,
fat and muscle tissue from all calves using HPLC indicated the presence of the
sulfoxide and sulfone metabolites.  The parent drug, fenbendazole, was present
in trace quantities.  No other metabolites were indicated.<p>

It was concluded from the residue data above, that in calves born to and
consuming colostrum from fenbendazole-treated dams, residues of fenbendazole in
liver, kidney, fat and muscle were below the established safe concentrations.
Residue levels in liver, kidney, fat and muscle as a percent of the safe
concentrations were 13.98%, 3.52%, 1.93% and 6.12%, respectively.  Therefore,
meat from calves born to fenbendazole-treated dams is safe even when
fenbendazole is administered prior to parturition.<p>

E.  Milk Residue Tolerance Study.<p>

A study with non-radiolabeled fenbendazole was conducted to determine the total
quantity of fenbendazole and its metabolites in whole milk as a function of
time and to expand the examination to include use of the actual market
formulation.  A further objective was to determine whether incurred
fenbendazole residues or its metabolites demonstrate activity in three commonly
used milk antibiotic screening tests, Charm II assay, Delvotest P and
<i>Bacillus stearothermophilis</i>&#160;disc assay.  For this study fenbendazole
suspension 10% at a rate of 5 mg/kg body weight was administered to ten
lactating dairy cows; an additional cow served as a control.<p>

</pre>
Animals used in this study were selected from the Holstein herd maintained at
the LSU Agricultural Experimental Station.  All lactating dairy cows were at
least thirty days postpartum and were producing a target minimum of 20 kg of
milk per day.  Animals were managed in the same manner as the remaining cow
herd.  The ration consisted of concentrate and corn silage, and the cows grazed
Bermuda and rye grass.  Cows were monitored for reproductive function, were
bred by artificial insemination, and were treated for reproductive dysfunction
according to standard herd practices.<p>

Cows were weighed within twenty-four (24) hours of drug administration.  The
ten treated cows received Safe-Guard&#168; Suspension 10% in an amount
to equal delivery of 5.0 mg fenbendazole/kg body weight.  The control cow was
untreated.<p>

Cows were machine milked in the morning prior to treatment.  Milk samples were
collected at that milking and were used as blank controls for the study.  Milk
samples (100 mL) were then collected at the 4:00 AM and 4:00 PM milkings for
seven days following fenbendazole treatment.<p>

For metabolic profiling, milk samples were extracted by matrix solid phase
dispersion (MSPD) technique.  The amount of parent drug and metabolites was
determined quantitatively by HPLC analyses using UV diode array detection.  The
identity of peaks was matched with known standards for the metabolites of
fenbendazole based on retention time and UV-diode array spectra.<p>

The administration of fenbendazole at a target dose of 5.0 mg/kg body weight as
suspension 10% to lactating dairy cows produced residues in whole milk
identifiable as fenbendazole sulfoxide, fenbendazole sulfone and trace
quantities of fenbendazole.  Peak residue time in milk was twenty-four (24)
hours after administration, and the peak fenbendazole sulfoxide marker level
was 0.12 &#177;0.03 ug/mL (Table 1).  No residues of fenbendazole were
detected in the control cow.<p>

Antibiotic residue test screening was conducted on milk samples from three (3)
treated cows chosen randomly.  The samples were collected at 12 hour intervals
for 72 hours post-dose.  Tests performed included the Charm II assay, Delvotest
P, and <i>Bacillus stearothermophilis</i>&#160;disc assay.  Zero time samples were
included in all antibiotic screening tests; Delvotest P and <i>B.
stearothermophilis</i>&#160;disc assay also included milk collected from the control
animal at 12 hour intervals for 72 hours post-dose.  Examinations indicated
that the incurred residues from cows receiving fenbendazole suspension 10% at a
rate of 5.0 mg/kg body weight had no discernible or consistent affect on the
assays in term of producing false positive or suspect sample results.  No
sample from any cow examined gave a "positive" response to the Delvotest P and
<i>Bacillus stearothermophilis</i>&#160;disc assay.  Assay results of ten antibiotic
classes indicated that fenbendazole and its metabolites do not interfere or
cross-react with any consistency in the Charm II assay.<p>

It was concluded that the fenbendazole sulfoxide marker residue level was below
the tolerance level, and therefore, total residues were below the established
safe concentration for milk.  A zero-day withdrawal period was approved for use
of fenbendazole suspension 10% in dairy cattle of breeding age.  It was further
concluded that use of fenbendazole does not interfere with the practice of
antibiotic drug screening.<p>

F.  Milk Discard and Slaughter Time<p>

A zero (0) milk discard time is established for fenbendazole in dairy cattle of
breeding age.  The milk residue depletion studies described in Parts C and E
above demonstrate that the maximum levels of fenbendazole residues in milk are
well below the 1.67 ppm safe concentration and 0.6 ppm tolerance when lactating
dairy cows are treated at the approved dosing rate of 5 mg/kg body weight.
Accordingly, no discard of milk is required following treatment with
fenbendazole.<p>

An eight (8) day withdrawal time in edible tissues (muscle, liver, fat and
kidney) was established in the original NADA 128-620 (48 FR 42809, September
20, 1983) and applies to dairy cows treated with fenbendazole.<p>

G.  Regulatory Methods:<p>

A regulatory milk assay method is not required because of the establishment of
a zero (O) milk withdrawal period in lactating dairy cattle.  However, an HPLC
assay method is on file at FDA/CVM in Rockville, MD.<p>

A regulatory tissue method was developed as part of the original fenbendazole
approval.  The method, entitled, "Determination Procedure for the Measurement
of Fenbendazole in Bovine Liver Tissue", is on file at the FDA's Freedom of
Information Office, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.<p>

<b>6.  	AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>

The data submitted in support of this supplement satisfy the requirement
of Section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA).  The
toxicology data on fenbendazole that were submitted with the original NADA
128-620 have allowed the establishment of a safe concentration of 1.67 ppm for
total residues of fenbendazole in milk.  From the residue and metabolite data
on fenbendazole in dairy cattle that was submitted with this supplement, a
tolerance of 0.6 ppm is established as the tolerance for residues in milk of
the fenbendazole sulfoxide metabolite (the marker residue).  Because the
maximum levels of residues found in milk of fenbendazole-treated cattle are
well below the safe concentration and tolerance noted above, no discard of milk
(zero milk withdrawal) is required.  The slaughter withdrawal time of 8 days
required for treated dairy cattle is the same as established for beef cattle
under the original NADA 128-620.<p>

Under the Center's supplemental approval policy [21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)(v and
x)], the addition of dairy cattle to the claim is a Category II change.  The
approval of this change is not expected to have any adverse effect on the
safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug.  Accordingly, this approval
did not require a reevaluation of the safety and effectiveness data in the
parent application.<p>

Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the FFDCA, this approval for food producing
animals does not qualify for exclusivity because the supplemental application
does not contain new clinical or field investigations (other than
bioequivalence or residue studies) and new human food safety studies (other
than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval and conducted
or sponsored by the applicant.<p>

<b>Established Name:</b> Halofuginonc Hydrobromide<p> 
<b>Trade Name:</b> STENOROL&#174; <p>
<b>Marketing Status:</b> Over-the-Counter (OTC) <p>
<b>Date of Summary:  </b>September 19, 1994<p> 
<b>2.   INDICATIONS FOR USE:</b> <p> 
The original approval for this NADA provided for the use of
halofuginone hydrobromide in complete feeds for broiler chickens for the
prevention of coccidiosis. This supplemental submission has been filed to
provide for the same dose level of 2.72 g/t (3 ppm) to be fed to replacement
cage laying chickens and replacement broiler breeder chickens for the
prevention of coccidiosis caused by <i>Eimeria tenella, E. necatrix, E.
aacervulina, E. maxima, E. brunetti, </i>and <i>E.  mivati / mitis.</i><p>
<b>3.   DOSAGE FORM, ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION AND RECOMMENDED DOSAGE:</b> <p> 
STENOROL&#174; is marketed as a Type A medicated article (premix). The
halofuginone hydrobromide type A medicated article is sold in one
concentration: 2.72 grams halofuginone hydrobromide activity per pound (6 grams
per kilogram of premix).<p> 

<b>Dosage and Administration:</b><p> The route of administration of the drug
is oral via the feed.    Halofuginone hydrobromide is added to replacement cage
layer complete feed and replacement broiler breeder complete feed at a 
concentration of 2.72 g/ton.    The resultant feed containing the drug is
then fed continuously as the sole    ration. Halofuginone hydrobromide must
be withdrawn from replacement    cage layer feed at 20 weeks of
age. Halofuginone hydrobromide   must be withdrawn from replacement
broiler breeder feed at 16 weeks of  age. If the replacement cage layers and
broiler 
breeders are sold for slaughter, halofuginone hydrobromide must be withdrawn 4
days before slaughter.<p> 
<b>4.  EFFECTIVENESS:</b> <p> 
<b>A. Pivotal Battery Confirmation Study:</b><p> 
The efficacy data for halofuginone hydrobromide in broiler chickens is located
in its parent NADA and the FOI contains a summary of the data (NADA 130-951 -
50 FR 33718 - August 21, 1985). The efficacy data from eighteen pivotal battery
confirmation studies contained in the parent NADA 130-951 demonstrates
effectiveness of halofuginone hydrobromide in broiler chickens and in broiler
breeder chickens.<p> 
In addition to the broiler chicken battery confirmation studies contained in
the parent NADA 130-951 which correspondingly demonstrate effectiveness in
replacement broiler breeders, this supplement to an approved application
contains an adequate and well controlled battery study demonstrating the
effectiveness of halofuginone hydrobromide when fed to replacement female cage
laying chickens. An investigation using recent field isolates from broiler
producing regions in the United States was carried out in batteries to prove
the effectiveness of halofuginone against 6 
    pathogenic coccidia of chickens.    The investigator conducted an  experiment
in two phases (Study    1 and Study 2) involving recent field   strain isolates
of coccidia: <i>Eimeria tenella, E. necatrix, E. acervulina,
maxima, E. brunetti, </i>and <i>E. mivati / E. mitis .</i> 
 
The battery study for the effectiveness claim was conducted by Dr. Carey
Quarles, Colorado Quality Research, Inc. 1401 Duff Drive, Suite 700, Fort
Collins, Colorado 80524.<p>

    and Dosage Form -       STENOROL&#174;   2.72 g/lb<br>   
    Species and Age -

Number of Chicks    -
60<br>  Drug Level Tested   -   2.72 g/t (3 ppm)<br>    Route of Administration -   Fed
orally in diet<p> 
The experimental groups were:    Infected medicated, unmedicated uninfected and
unmedicated infected. Oral infections with speculated oocysts ranged from
moderate to severe with clinical signs and 
    pathology characteristic of the <i>Eimeria </i>&#160;species employed.    The 
investigation was conducted using a strain of cage laying   chickens that    are
commonly available in the given areas. The chickens were     approximately two
weeks of age when the investigation was started. The     parameters were weight
gain, feed efficiency, mortality due    to 
coccidiosis, lesion scores, droppings (fecal) scores, and oocysts passage
counts. The following Tables 1 through 7 are the result of pooling the data by
species.<p> 
A total of 960 Leghorn female chickens were used in the trial to demonstrate
the effectivencss and safety of halofuginone hydrobromide.The chicks were randomly
 assigned to treatment and cage level within a battery.
Treatment assignment to batteries was preselected based on treatment and cage
level within a battery. Uninfected controls were maintained in the top battery
decks to prevent accidental infection and consumption of medicated feed. Each
treatment consisted of six replicates of ten female chicks each. The study was
conducted in two phases to test all single <i>Eimeria </i>&#160;species and mixed
species (Study 1 and Study 2).<p> 
Prevention of mortality, reduction of lesion scores and reduction of fecal
scores are the major parameters used to demonstrate anticoccidial
effectiveness. Examination of the data presented in Tables 1 through 7
demonstrates a reduction in mortality, lesions scores, and fecal scores
compared with the unmedicated infected control. Weight gain and feed efficiency
for the medicated groups were better than the unmedicated infected controls.<p>

regions of the United States were used in the study. Treatments were randomly
assigned to pens within a block, and sixty female Leghorn were randomly
assigned to a pen. Each of two treatments were replicated five times, and 600
Leghorn birds were used. An unmedicated infected group was the control which
represented one treatment, and a medicated infected group represented the
second treatment at 2.72 g/t. Chickens were exposed to coccidia (mixed
<i>Eimeria </i>&#160;spp.) challenge via the feed. Medication was fed continuously
from day 1 until the termination of the study at 56 days of age. Table 8

</pre>
<b>CONCLUSION:</b><p> Efficacy was evaluated on the basis of coccidiosis induced
mortality, lesion scores, body weight and feed efficiency. STENOROL at 3 ppm
(2.72 g/t) effectively reduced mortality, intestinal lesion scores, and
improved weight gain. Observations confirmed that there were no adverse drug
effects, including no abnormal droppings and no wet litter.<p> 
<b>C. Clinical Field Trials</b><p> 
The clinical field trials data for halofuginone hydrobromide in broiler
chickens is located in its parent NADA and in the FOI Summary. (NADA 130-951 -
50 FR 33718 - August 21, 1985). The data from eight clinical trials and
floor-pen trials demonstrates safety and effectiveness of halofuginone
hydrobromide in broiler chickens, and replacement cage layer and broiler
breeder chickens.<p> 
<b>5.   TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY </b><p> 
The target animal safety data for halofuginone hydrobromide in broiler chickens
is located in its parent NADA and the FOI contains a summary of the data (NADA
130-951 - 50 FR 33718 - August 21, 1985). The target animal safety data from an
acute oral toxicity study and a well controlled floor-pen study contained in
the parent NADA 130-951 demonstrate safety of the halofuginone hydrobromide in
broiler chickens.<p> 
In addition to the broiler chicken target animal safety studies contained in
the parent NADA 130-951, this supplement to an approved application contains an
adequate and well controlled target animal safety study demonstrating the
safety of halofuginone hydrobromide when fed to replacement cage laying
chickens and replacement broiler breeder chickens.<p> 
The above effectiveness studies (Section 4) adequately demonstrated that there
were no adverse effects when halofuginone hydrobromide at 3 ppm was included in
the feed. However, further evaluation by Dr. Carey Quarles, Colorado Quality
Research, Inc., Fort Collins, Colorado 80524, of the target animal safety of
halofuginone hydrobromide was studied in a well controlled floor-pen study.<p>

Although halofuginone hydrobromide is not intended for use in cage laying
chickens in production, additional data were collected after the 140-day
growing period to determine the effect of feeding halofuginone hydrobromide
during the growing period on subsequent egg production and egg quality
characteristics. Halofuginone hydrobromide was withdrawn from all diets at 140
days (Table 11).<p>

<b>CONCLUSION:</b><p> When halofuginone hydrobromide was fed at 3, 9 and 15 ppm, average
body weight was decreased when compared with the control group. Feed efficiency
was decreased with the 9 and 15 ppm levels of halofuginone hydrobromide.
Hematological factors and tissue morphology were not influenced 
with any treatment level of halofuginone hydrobromide.  Leghorn chickens fed 
    the 3 ppm level of halofuginone hydrobromide during the growing period had 
numerically greater egg production when compared with birds fed the control 
during the growing period. Egg quality characteristics were not influenced with
3 and 9 ppm of halofuginone hydrobromide. Egg production, feed efficiency, egg
weight, and egg shell thickness were decreased only in birds fed 15 ppm
hallofuginone hydrobromide during the growing period.<p> 
<b>REPLACEMENT BROILER BREEDER CHICKENS</b><p> 
Although halofuginone hydrobromide is not intended for use in broiler breeder
chickens in production, additional data were collected after the 112-day
growing period to determine the effect of feeding halofuginone hydrobromide
during the 
growing period on subsequent fertility and hatchability.
Halofuginone hydrobromide was withdrawn from all diets at 112 days.<p> 

Through mutual agreement between the sponsor and Food and Drug Administration, replacement
broiler breeders fed  the 15 ppm level of halofuginone hydrobromide were 
  destroyed after 84 days on experiment 
due to high mortality, poor weight gain and poor feed 
consumption.<p> 
  
The results of this study for replacement broiler breeder chickens are
presented in Table 12 and 13.<p>

<b>6.  HUMAN FOOD SAFETY </b><p> 
The original NADA contains an FOI Summary and complete information that
demonstrate that food from animals fed halofuginone hydrobromide is safe for
human consumption (NADA 130-951 - 50 FR 33718 - August 21, 1985).<p> 
<b>7.  AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b> <p> 
The data submitted in support of this supplemental NADA satisfy the
requirements of Section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that halofuginone
hydrobromide when used under its proposed conditions of use is safe and
effective for its labeled indications. The supplemental approval provides for
the use of halofuginone 
hydrobromide (STENOROL&#174;)   at 2.72 g/t (3 ppm) in replacement cage
laying chickens and replacement broiler breeder chickens to prevent coccidiosis
caused by <i>E. tenella, E. necatrix, E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. brunetti, </i>
and <i> E mivati / E. mitis .</i><p>  
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy [21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)], this is
a Category II change. The approval of this change is not expected to have any
adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug.
Accordingly, this approval did not require a reevaluation of safety and
effectiveness data in the parent application.<p> 
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act,
this approval qualifies for THREE (3) years of marketing exclusivity beginning
on the 
date of approval because the supplemental   application contains reports of
new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residues
studies) essential to the approval of the application    and conducted or
sponsored by the applicant. The THREE years of marketing exclusivity applies
only to the current supplemental approval.<p> 
Proper use by non-veterinarians can be expected because poultry producers
routinely use medicated feed containing an animal drug for the prevention of
coccidiosis in broiler chickens and turkeys. Directions are clearly written and
there is reasonable certainly that the conditions of use, including mixing
directions on the label, can and will be followed by the producer. The agency
has concluded that this product can be approved for over-the-counter use.<p>

<B>Effect of Supplement:</B><P>

  This supplement provides for removal of the requirement for a preslaughter 
  drug withdrawal period for heifers fed melengestrol acetate in combination 
  with monensin. Previous approvals have required a 48-hour preslaughter drug
  withdrawal for melengestrol acetate.<P>


<b>II.  Indications for Use:</b><P>This supplement does not affect the
labeled indications for the combination of melengestrol acetate and monensin
which are:<P>For increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency
and suppression of estrus (heat) in heifers fed in confinement for
slaughter.<P>
<b>III.  Dosage form, Route of Administration and
Recommended Dosage</b><P>
<pre>
Dosage Form:                    Feed

Route of Administration:        Oral

Recommended Dosage:
Melengestrol Acetate            0.25 to 0.4 mg/head/day
Monensin (as Monensin sodium)   50 to 360 mg/head/day 
                                (5 to 30 g/ton air dried complete feed).

</pre>
Approval has been granted to feed 0.25 to 0.4 mg melengestrol acetate
per head per day in combination with 5 to 30 g monensin per ton of air dried
complete feed. Each additive may be provided via separate supplements or in a
single combination supplement either liquid or dry. The supplement containing
melengestrol acetate must be fed at a rate of 0.5 to 2.0 pounds per head and
may be top dressed onto or mixed with a complete feed containing monensin.<P>

<b>IV. Effectiveness</b><P> 
This supplement does not affect the labeled indications for this combination.<P>

<b>V.  Animal Safety</b> <P>
The supplement does not affect target animal safety for this combination.<P> 

<b>VI. Human Safety</b> <P> 

<b>1. Tolerance and withdrawal period.</b><P>
As stated in the Freedom of Information Summary for the supplemental application
for melengestrol acetate (NADA's 034-254 and 039-402), concurrently approved
with this application, the tolerance of melengestrol acetate (MGA) is
established as 25 ppb in edible tissue of treated animals and fat is designated
as the target tissue for monitoring purposes. The approval also provides for
the deletion of the 48-hour withdrawal period.<P> 

A tolerance of 0.05 ppm
has been established for negligible residues of monensin in the edible tissues
of cattle (<B>21 CFR 556.420</B>). No preslaughter withdrawal period is required for
cattle fed monensin (<B>21 CFR 558.355</B>).<P>

<b>2. Residue depletion.</b><P>
Data previously summarized in Freedom of Information Summaries for NADA's
124-309 and 125-476, dated 30 April 1990, demonstrate that the concentration of
melengestrol acetate in fat is below the tolerance of 25 ppb established by the
approval of the supplemental application for MGA (NADA's 034-254 and 039-402) and
that the concentration of monensin in liver is below its tolerance when heifers
are fed melengestrol acetate, tylosin and monensin in combination; each at
their highest approved dosage, and slaughtered without a pre-slaughter
withdrawal. This study is summarized below.<P>

Groups of heifers were fed
for 90 days either no additive (control, n=14) or melengestrol acetate,
monensin and tylosin in combination at 1X (n=7), 3X (n=7) or 5X (n=7) the
highest dosage approved for the three-way combination of these three additives
(1X = 0.5 mg melengestrol acetate, 30 g monensin/ton air dried feed and 10 g
tylosin/ton air dried feed). This provided melengestrol acetate at dosages of
1.25X, 3.75X and 6.25X the highest approved dosage (0.4 mg/day) for the two-way
combination of melengestrol acetate and monensin. The heifers were slaughtered
at practical zero withdrawal.<P>

Perirenal fat samples were collected
from all heifers for quantification of melengestrol acetate concentration using
the method described in JAOAC 59:507-515:1976. This method has a limit of
sensitivity of 10 ppb. All fat samples from heifers in the control and 1X
treatment groups had concentrations of melengestrol acetate below 10 ppb. The
average concentrations of melengestrol acetate in fat samples from heifers in
the 3X and 5X dose groups were 29.2 ppb (range 18.2 to 39.6 ppb) and 42.2 ppb
(range 35.8 to 49 ppb), respectively.<P>Liver samples were collected
from seven of the control heifers and from the seven heifers in the 1X
treatment group for analysis of monensin and tylosin concentration. Neither
monensin or tylosin were detected in any of the liver samples. The limits of
detection for these analyses were 0.04 and 0.1 ppm for monensin and tylosin,
respectively.<P>

<b>3. Conclusion</b><P> 
The concentration of melengestrol
acetate in fat is below the tolerance of 25 ppb and residues of monensin in
liver are below the established tolerance for monensin when heifers are
slaughtered without a preslaughter withdrawal following feeding of melengestrol
acetate and monensin in combination at their highest approved dosage
levels.<P>

<b>4. Assay noninterference</b>
<P> Data have been summarized in
Freedom of Information Summaries for NADA's 124-309, 125-476, 138-792 and
138-870 demonstrating that presence of melengestrol acetate does not interfere
with the tissue residue assay for monensin and presence of monensin does not
interfere with the tissue residue assay for melengestrol acetate.<P>

<b>5. Regulatory methods</b>
<P>Practical regulatory methods for analysis of tissue
residues of melengestrol acetate and monensin may be found in the <i>Food
Additives Analytical Manual</i> on display in FDA's Freedom of Information
Public Room (Parklawn Building, Room 12A30).<P>

<b>6. Conclusions</b><P>
This supplement provides for the removal of the regulation for a 48 hour
preslaughter drug withdrawal period for melengestrol acetate when melengestrol
acetate and monensin are fed in combination. No changes are made in either the
approved dosage range of either compound or in the target class of livestock.
The data submitted support the conclusion that the concentration of
melengestrol acetate in fat is below the established tolerance for melengestrol
acetate and that the concentration of monensin in liver is below the
established tolerance for monensin when heifers are slaughtered without a
preslaughter withdrawal following the combined feeding of melengestrol acetate
and monensin at their highest approved dosage level. Accordingly, approval of
this change is not expected to have adverse effects on public health or food
safety.<P>

<b>VII. Agency Conclusions</b> 
<P> Under the Center's
supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is a Category II
change providing for the removal of the requirement for a 48 hour withdrawal
period prior to slaughter for heifers fed melengestrol acetate when
melengestrol acetate is fed in combination with monensin. This supplement
evoked a reevaluation of the toxicity data for MGA contained in NADA's 034-254
and 039-402.<P> Adequate data were submitted in NADA's 034-354, 039-402,
124-309, and 125-476 which permitted the Agency to conclude that a withdrawal
period is not necessary for heifers fed this combination.<P> Under
section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, this
approval for food animals does not qualify for marketing exclusivity because
the supplemental application did not contain new clinical or field
investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and new human
food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to
the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<P>

<b>IV.  Effectiveness</b><p>

Pivotal Study<p> 

Comparison of PSGAG levels in the synovial fluid of the equine carpus and

hock joints after a single intramuscular injection of 500 mg 3HPSGAG<p>

This study was performed to compare the levels of PSGAG achieved in the
synovial fluid of the equine carpus and hock joints after a single
intramuscular injection of 500 mg 3HPSGAG.<p>

The study was performed at the Boren Veterinary Teaching Hospital of Oklahoma
State University at Stillwater, Oklahoma.  Investigators included:<p>

Lawrence DeBault, Ph.D., Department of Pathology at Oklahoma University Medical
Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed all liquid scintillation analyses.
Peter Panse, MD of the pharmacokinetics department of Luitpold Pharma GmbH was
responsible for preparation of the test drug.<p>

The purpose of this study was to determine the levels of PSGAG achieved in the
equine hock joint following a single intramuscular injection of 500 mg PSGAG,
and to compare these levels to those achieved in the equine carpus.<p>

Eight healthy mature horses 2 years old to aged (4 geldings, 2 stallions, 2
mares) (5 Quarterhorses, 2 Thoroughbreds, 1 Paint) served as test animals.  The
horses had no clinical evidence of degenerative joint disease.<p>

The test drug was tritium labeled PSGAG prepared by Dr. Peter Panse.  Each
ampule contained 1 mL of a solution of 500 mg 3HPSGAG with a total
radioactivity of 2.0447 mCi per ampule.  The test drug was administered by
intramuscular injection into the lateral cervical region.  Synovial fluid
samples were collected by aseptic arthrocentesis from the carpus and hock
joints prior to injection of the radiolabeled drug and at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24
hours after injection.<p>

Samples were subjected to liquid scintillation analysis.  The values from the
liquid scintillation (expressed as decays per minute per 200  L) were converted
to g PSGAG/mL synovial fluid.  The results are summarized in table one:<p>

In order to assess the bioequivalence in the PSGAG levels of the hock joint
relative to that of the originally approved carpal joint, the area under the
curve was calculated by integrating a smooth nonlinear regression line. The
equation selected for fitting describes the concentration of an intermediate B
in the compartmental model A -&#62; B &#60;-&#62; C, with all rate constants
fit as first order rate constants.  The AUC was calculated using only the
actual data points, and not extrapolated through the "tail area".  These values
were analyzed using a paired samples t-test since each horse contributed an
area for each synovial fluid type.<p>

joints<P>

Using the calculated area under the curve values, a 90% confidence interval was calculated on the difference between the areas under the curve of the synovial fluid for the carpal joint and the hock joint.  The 90% confidence intervals used the standard deviation of the paired t-test as the error estimate.  In order to show bioequivalence, the confidence interval should lie within +/- 20% of the reference mean, i.e., the carpal joint.  As shown in table 3 below, this is true for the carpal and hock joints.<p>

Conclusions drawn from this study were:<p> <ol> 

<li>Drug levels achieved in the hock were bioequivalent to those in the
carpus.<p>

<li>The efficacy of Adequan i.m. in the treatment of non-infectious degenerative and/or traumatic joint dysfunction of the equine carpal joint has been demonstrated in clinical trials.  It is reasonable to assume that equivalent efficacy would be expected in the treatment of non-infectious degenerative and/or traumatic joint dysfunction of the equine hock joint, since drug levels in the carpus and hock are bioequivalent. </ol> <p>

Corroborative Study<p>

Radiolabeled Pharmacokinetic Study of Adequan&#174; i.m. in the Horse<P>

This study was a pharmacokinetic study of tritium-labeled PSGAG which examined serum, carpal synovial fluid, and carpal articular cartilage levels of the drug after intramuscular injection.  The study also examined the effect of Adequan intraarticular injections on hyaluronic acid levels in the carpal synovial fluid.<p>

Scintigraphy of articular cartilage and bone; preparation of the radiolabeled
PSGAG<P>

The purpose of this study was to determine serum, urine, and synovial fluid
PSGAG levels after intramuscular injection of 500 mg of tritium-labeled PSGAG
(3HPSGAG) at selected intervals and to assay bone and cartilage levels at 96
hours post injection.  Synovial fluid parameters including hyaluronic acid
content were also determined at selected intervals.  The effect of an induced
cartilage lesion was also examined on the kinetics of the drug when compared to
its distribution in the normal synovial joint.<p>

Eight mature horses (2-14 years of age, 3 geldings, 5 females; 7 Quarterhorse,
1 Appaloosa) which were determined to be healthy and free of carpal joint
disease were utilized in the study.  A defect was created in the distal dorsal
medial articular surface of the left radial carpal bone by means of an
arthoburr via arthroscopy.  The right carpus served as a normal joint for
comparison.  The horses were allowed to recover for at least 12 days prior to
administration of the radiolabeled drug.<p>

The test drug contained 500 mg of PSGAG labeled with tritium.  The specific
radioactivity of the solution was 1.739 mCi per mg of PSGAG for a total of 881
mCi per 500 mg dose.  The test drug was prepared by Dr. Peter Panse at
Luitpold-Werk in Munich, West Germany.<p>

The test article was administered by intramuscular injection into the lateral cervical area.  The dose used in the study was 500 mg.  After injection the horses were observed for 96 hours and the various tissue fluids were collected.
The horses were euthanized 96 hours post-injection and cartilage and bone
tissues were collected.<p>

The following parameters were examined:<P>  <OL>

<LI>)   Serum, urine and carpal synovial fluid 3HPSGAG levels at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12,24,
48, and 96 hours after injection.<p>
<LI>)   Carpal synovial fluid for hyaluronic acid levels at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48,
and 96 hours after injection.<p>
<LI>)   Carpal synovial fluid for routine clinical analysis prior to arthroscopy and
96 hours after injection.<p>
<LI>)   Cartilage and subchondral bone samples at 96 hours for 3HPSGAG content.</ol>
<p>
All synovial fluid, cartilage and bone samples were collected from both the target joint (damaged left carpus) and the contralateral normal joint (right carpus).  Two cartilage and subchondral bone samples were taken from the radial carpal bone of each joint.  These included a sagittal section through the area of the lesion on the left carpus and a similar area of the right carpus.  The remaining distal radial carpal bone cartilage was collected from each knee and designated as the distal sample.<p>

The results of the study are presented in Tables four to eight.<p>

<li>)  A factorial analysis of variance was performed on cartilage and bone samples
taken at 96 hours.  Factors included time (half the samples were analyzed for
radioactivity at a later time after the experiment), location (sagittal versus
distal) and side (left versus right).  No statistically significant differences
were detected between left and right or sagittal and distal sections.<p>

<li>)  Relationships between pharmacokinetic parameters and 3HPSGAG levels in the
various tissues and hyaluronic acid levels in the synovial fluid were
investigated by correlation and regression analysis.  No significant

 Conclusions drawn from the study include: <p> <ol>

<li>)  PSGAG is systemically absorbed and distributed via the bloodstream.<p>

<li>)  The normal carpal joint and the joint with the surgically created defect
responded in a similar fashion with slightly greater increases noted in the
joint with the damaged cartilage.<p>

<li>)  Serum and synovial fluid 3HPSGAG were highly correlated over time after
intramuscular injection.<p>

<li>)  Injection of 500 mg of PSGAG led to a statistically significant increase in
synovial fluid hyaluronic acid content at 24, 48 and 96 hours after injection
in both the target and control joint. Based on the data from the Pivotal
Study above, this should also occur in equine hock joints.<p>

<b>V.Animal Safety</b> <P>

Information concerning the safety of Adequan&#174; i.m. is contained in the
existing FOI Summary for this product (NADA 140-901, 21 CFR 522.1850).<p>

This supplemental approval uses the same dose and route of administration of
Adequan&#174; i.m. as in the original application.  Therefore, no additional
safety studies were required.<p>

Reproduction:<P>

The following statement appears in the product labeling:<p>

    "Studies have not been conducted to establish safety in breeding horses."<p>

<b>VI.Human Safety Relative to Food Consumption</b><p>

Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not required for approval of this supplemental NADA.  The drug is approved for
use only in horses that are not to be used for food and is to be labeled "Not
for use in horses intended for food."<p>

Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration<p>

The labeling contains adequate caution statements, i.e. "Keep this and all
medications out of the reach of children."<p>


<b>VII.Agency Conclusions</b><p>

This supplemental NADA is supported by data that comply with the requirements
set forth in Section 512 of the Act and 21 CFR 514.111 of the regulations.
These data reveal that when Adequan&#174; i.m. is used according to the
conditions set forth in the labeling, it is a safe and effective medicament.<p>

According to the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106), this
is a Category II change.  This supplement provides for the additional claim to
include the treatment of noninfectious degenerative and/or traumatic joint
dysfunction and associated lameness of the hock joint in horses.  The approval
of this change relied on the safety and effectiveness data in the parent
application and evaluation of new efficacy data submitted in the supplemental
application.<p>

In order to use Adequan&#174; i.m. properly, the diagnosis of degenerative or
traumatic hock joint dysfunction and associated lameness must be made.  Only a
veterinarian, suitably qualified by training and experience, can make such a
diagnosis.  Therefore the drug product is classified as a prescription drug.<p>

Lasalocid
at all levels was effective in controlling the infections of single or mixed
species of coccidia as measured by weight gain, feed conversion and lesion
scores when compared to infected, unmedicated controls (IUC).  Lesion scores
were determined by direct examination of the intestines and were rated from 0
(normal) to 4 (life threatening).  In the group that received mixed infections,
the lesion scores are higher than 4 because the scores of each affected portion
of the intestine are added.<p>
No coccidiosis mortality occurred in lasalocid-medicated groups while
coccidiosis mortality of  2.5&#37; (<i>E. adenoeides </i>), 7.5&#37; (<i>E.
gallopavonis </i>) and 7.5&#37; (mixed) occurred in the IUC groups.  No adverse drug
effects were observed. <p>
These data confirm that the effective lasalocid dosage range is 75-125 ppm
(68-113 g/ton) in the diet.<p>
<b>B.  Pivotal Floor-Pen Studies</b><ol><p>
<li>Dr. Larry McDougald, Athens, Georgia, conducted a well-controlled floor-pen
study using 40, day-old male turkey poults started in each of 18 pens for 10
weeks.  There were three lasalocid treatments (0, 75, and 125 ppm) with 6 floor
pens randomly allocated to each treatment.  <p>
    At 14 days of age poults were infected with recent mixed field isolates of
<i>E. adenoeides, E. gallopavonis</i>&#160; and <i>E. meleagrimitis</i>&#160; by  direct
exposure in the feed.  Five poults of each pen were sacrificed and lesion
scores determined on days 21 and 28 of the study.  The following results were
obtained:<p>

Lasalocid at all levels was highly effective in preventing coccidiosis as
measured by weight gain, feed conversion, lesion score, and mortality when
compared to infected unmedicated controls.  One bird died with coccidiosis when
medicated with lasalocid at 75 ppm and none died with coccidiosis when
medicated at 125 ppm.  Infected, unmedicated birds experienced a 24.17&#37;
mortality (58/240).  <p>
It was concluded that lasalocid at 75 and 125 ppm in the diet was effective in
reducing lesion scores and mortality in young male turkeys when challenged with
mixed infections of <i>E. meleagrimitis, E. gallopavonis</i>&#160; and <i>E.
adenoeides </i>.<p>
<li>Dr. Paul Waibel, St. Paul, Minnesota, conducted a controlled floor-pen
challenge study using mixed field isolates of <i>E. meleagrimitis, E.
gallopavonis</i>&#160; and <i>E. adenoeides </i>.  The efficacy of lasalocid
anticoccidial activity was evaluated in 540 Large White Nicholas strain female
turkey poults in floor-pens under simulated commercial conditions.  The turkey
hens were divided into three groups of six replicate pens each and received
either a nonmedicated diet or 75 ppm or 125 ppm lasalocid continuously from day
zero to 10 weeks of age.  The turkeys were challenged with the field isolates
of coccidial oocysts mixed in the feed at 14 days of age and scored for
coccidial lesions seven days later. <p>

mixed coccidial oocysts at 14 days of age had heavier body weights, better feed
conversion and lower mortality at 10 weeks of age when  compared to infected,
nonmedicated female turkeys.  Also, both groups of lasalocid-medicated turkeys
had lower coccidial lesion scores seven days post-coccidial exposure than the
infected, nonmedicated group.  These results support the claim that lasalocid
is an excellent anticoccidial compound in female turkeys when added to diets
over a range of 75 ppm to 125 ppm.  No adverse drug reactions were observed.
No adverse or unusual litter conditions were noted.  Leg and feather conditions
were within normal limits.</ol><p>

<b>C.  Corroborative Studies, Commercial Production</b><ol><p>
<li>Dr. Larry McDougald, Athens, Georgia, conducted a controlled, unchallenged
study in turkeys.  Two hundred sixty-four female and 204 male turkey poults
(Nicholas commercial type broad-breasted white turkey breed) were fed in a
floor-pen study from hatch to market age (15 weeks for female and 20 weeks for
male birds).  Male and female birds were housed in separate pens with 17 males
and 22 females per pen.  Three pens of males and three pens of females were
assigned to each of four treatments,  1) unmedicated feed;  2) lasalocid 75
ppm;  3) lasalocid 125 ppm; and  4) monensin 100 ppm.  Brooding heat was
provided as needed by electric heat bulbs and gas heaters.  The building was of
conventional construction with side curtain allowing natural ventilation.
Lighting was provided by evenly spaced 40 watt bulbs mounted on the ceiling.
Turkeys were randomly assigned to pens and pens were randomly assigned to
treatment.  The following was observed:<ul><p>
<li>a.  Lasalocid has a positive effect on growth and feed conversion when given at
75 or 125 ppm in the feed through market weight (15 weeks for females and 20
weeks for males) in comparison with unmedicated controls.<p>
<li>b.  There were no untoward effects of feeding lasalocid.<p>
<li>c.  The water consumption was not affected by lasalocid medication.<p>
<li>d.  Litter quality was the same as controls or was slightly improved when
lasalocid was given, especially at 125 ppm.<p>
<li>e.  Incidence of leg problems (twisted legs or other abnormalities which
contribute to crippling) was very low throughout the study.<p>
<li>f.  Tibial dyschondroplasia scores were very low at 5 weeks of age.  There was
no evidence that any drug treatments contributed to higher or lower scores.<p>
<li>g.  The treatment with lasalocid at 75 or 125 ppm had no apparent effect on
death losses.<p>
Growth and feed conversion data are summarized below.</ul><p>

<li>Dr. Jeffrey Davidson, Tulare, California, evaluated the utility and safety
of continuous lasalocid medication in turkeys using commercial facilities and
rations in 3,000 Nicholas Broad Breasted White, newly hatched female turkey
poults.  During the brooding period, 1 sq. ft/poult was provided, and after six
weeks of age to market weight 2.25 sq. ft/poult was provided.  The turkey hens
were medicated with 113 g lasalocid/ton of feed, continuously from day one
through 15 weeks of age, and nonmedicated withdrawal rations were fed to 17
weeks of age.<p>

 
        The results were as follows:<p>

No
adverse drug reactions, abnormal feathering, leg problems or abnormal litter
conditions were observed.<p>
The results of this study demonstrate the safety and utility of continuous
lasalocid medication under commercial conditions in female turkeys.<p>
<li>Dr. Paul Waibel, St. Paul, Minnesota, conducted a commercial study with male
turkeys using lasalocid.  Ten thousand four hundred (10,400) Nicholas male
turkeys were fed 113 g lasalocid/ton medicated feed from day one to 14 days
prior to market at 17 weeks and 5 days.  A control flock of the same number of
birds was fed chlortetracycline for the first week and 50 g/ton zinc bacitracin
to market.  The lasalocid treated birds were heavier,  average 25.44 vs 25.27
pounds, had a slightly higher percent condemnation, 1.84 vs 1.03 and a slightly
higher feed conversion, 3.002 vs 2.954.  <br>
The lower percent of grade A birds (64.8&#37; lasalocid, 70.5&#37; controls), as well
as the higher percent of condemnation in the lasalocid group were attributed to
poor weather conditions (blizzard) and a longer transport time to the
processing plant.  Treated turkeys and controls were not shipped to slaughter
on the same date.<p>
It was concluded that lasalocid has commercial utility in current production
methods.<p>
<li>Dr. James Sandstrom, Willmar, Minnesota conducted the following study.
Lasalocid was provided in feed at 113 g/ton (125 ppm) at eight days of age to
10,000 male Nicholas turkeys and was withdrawn from feed three weeks prior to
market at 17 weeks 5 days. Average weight gain was 25 pounds per bird and
average feed conversion was 2.92.  Total mortality of 5.28&#37; was reported as
lower than average for that location.  There were no undesirable effects due to
lasalocid.  Litter condition, droppings, feathering and leg quality were equal
to or better than expected industry results.  Flock health indicated that
coccidiosis was controlled.<br>
<li>Dr. Dennis Rahn, Rice Lake, Wisconsin, conducted a commercial feeding trial
with lasalocid in 23,046 Nicholas hens.  Turkeys were started on lasalocid at
113 g/ton at day one and fed for 84 consecutive days.  The average weight at 96
days was 13.6 pounds, feed conversion was 2.47, livability was 94.2&#37;, Grade A's
89.7&#37; and plant condemnation was 0.30&#37;.  <br>
    The conclusions were that the performance of turkey hens fed lasalocid was
very good, feathering was excellent. No signs of toxicity due to lasalocid were
noted.  Feed conversion and percent Grade A were average for the location.<p>
<li>Mr. Roger James, Marshville, North Carolina, evaluated lasalocid under
commercial conditions in 8,796 Nicholas Large White male turkeys fed
continuously from day one at 113 g/ton until withdrawal 14 days prior to
slaughter at 22 weeks of age.  The livability was 85.66&#37;, average weight was
35.36 pounds and feed conversion was 3.19 at 22 weeks of age.  No clinical
coccidiosis was evident.  Early mortality was due to aspergillosis.  No adverse
drug effects were noted.<p>
<li>Dr. Jeffrey Davidson, Tulare, California, evaluated lasalocid at 113 g/ton
under commercial conditions in 2,850 male and 4,500 female Nicholas Broad
Breasted White turkeys from days one to 91 in females and days one to 108 in
males.  Medicated feed was withdrawn 15 days prior to slaughter at 106 days
from the hens and 19 days prior to slaughter at 127 days from the males.  The
males had 93.9&#37; livability, average live weight of 30.14 pounds and a feed
conversion of 2.57; females 95.9&#37; livability, average live weight of 18.1
pounds and a feed conversion of 2.35.  No coccidiosis was observed, feathering
and litter conditions were normal.  No adverse reactions were noted.<p>
<li>Drs. L. Volker and O. Hurstel, Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co. Ltd., Basle,
Switzerland, and Neuilly S/Seine, France conducted a commercial feeding study
of lasalocid at 90 ppm and 125 ppm in the feed involving a total of 40,480
young turkeys at five locations in western France (Brittany).  Females were
slaughtered at twelve weeks, males at 14-16 weeks.  No problems were reported.
<p>
The investigators concluded that lasalocid at 90 ppm and 125 ppm provided
prevention of coccidiosis under intensive large scale conditions practiced in
western France.  <p>

Parameters evaluated were growth rate, feed conversion, hematological and
biochemical blood values, organ weight, post-mortem findings and
histopathological assessment of sections of the heart, liver, spleen, kidneys,
gonads, thyroids, adrenals, gizzard, eyes and brain of male and female turkeys
of the 0 and 375 ppm lasalocid groups.<p>
Continuous dietary administration of lasalocid at 125, 187.5, 250 and 375 ppm
(i.e., maximum use level, 1.5X, 2X and 3X) to commercial turkeys, from one day
old to 16 weeks old, resulted in the following changes in comparison with the
control (untreated) group:<p>
At week 16,0 male and female birds given lasalocid at 375 ppm had increased
white blood cells and basophils together with increased glutamic-oxaloacetic
transaminase (GOT) and phosphorus levels.  Birds given lasalocid at 250 ppm
also had raised glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) levels at week 16.
These findings were not associated with any clinical observations.<p>
Analysis of the organ weights showed heavier kidneys at week 12 and heavier
brains at week 16 in birds given lasalocid at 250 and 375 ppm and lower adrenal
weights in the 375 ppm birds at 16 weeks.<p>
No treatment-related abnormalities were seen at post-mortem examination.  A
number of birds, distributed across all groups, were sacrificed as a result of
leg abnormalities which included limb abduction, intertarsal joint deformity
and/or enlargement, tibiotarsal dyschondroplasia, displaced tendons, etc.  <p>
These abnormalities were all considered to be of usual occurrence in
intensively reared turkeys.  A slight treatment-related trend may be linked to
the greater body weights attained by the birds in the groups given
lasalocid.<p>
<p>
There were dose-related improvements in body weight in the birds given
lasalocid.  These were most marked in the male birds during the first 12 weeks
of the study and in the female birds during the first 6 weeks of the study.<p>
There were increases in feed consumption in the male birds during certain
periods of the trial.  In some cases these increases were associated with
meaningful improvements in feed conversion ratios.  There were no differences
in feed consumption and feed conversion ratios in the female birds.<p>
Treatment-related changes were not detected in the sections of heart, liver,
spleen, kidneys, gonads, thyroids, adrenals, gizzard, eyes and brain examined
from the control male and female turkeys and the highest lasalocid (375 ppm)
male and female turkeys killed at termination.<p>
It was concluded that continuous dietary administration of lasalocid at 125 ppm
(maximum use level) to turkeys from day one to 16 weeks has no adverse
treatment-related effects on growing turkeys.<p>
<li>Dr. Jeffrey Davidson, Tulare, California, conducted a safety study using 204
turkeys, equal numbers of each sex.  The birds were placed into twelve floor
pens and randomly assigned to treatments.  Treatments were 0, 125 and 600 ppm
lasalocid in the feed from day one through 8 weeks of age.  Parameters measured
were body weight, feed consumption, feathering, leg soundness and blood
clotting time.  Birds fed the highest drug level had wet litter weeks three
through eight.  There were no gross or histo-pathological changes observed and
there were no differences between treatments for performance, feathering, leg
soundness and blood clotting time.  Feed consumption was higher for the 125 ppm
lasalocid group over control and the 600 ppm groups.  Body weight was highest
for the 125 ppm group over those of the controls and the highest level of
lasalocid.  Study treatments and observations (average of four replicates at 56
days) are shown in the following table.<p>

Lasalocid is safe in young turkeys at the proposed maximum use level of 125 ppm
and based on the results of this study appears safe even at 600 ppm in the
diet.  No adverse reactions, other than wet litter at the highest treatment
level, were observed.<p>
<li>Dr. Larry McDougald, Athens, Georgia, conducted a controlled safety study in
turkeys.<p>
Two hundred sixty-four female and 204 male turkey poults (Nicholas commercial

No
adverse clinical/toxicological  signs were seen in birds fed lasalocid at 113
g/ton. Birds fed lasalocid at 226 g/ton showed some decreased weight gain and
apparent loss of appetite and were listless (four of six pens) for one to three
days followed by a good recovery.  No mortality occurred in any of the groups.
It was concluded that inadvertent feeding of lasalocid to breeding age turkeys
at the recommended dose of 113 g/ton (125 ppm) would have no significant
clinical or toxicological effects.<p>

<b>6.   HUMAN SAFETY</b><p>
<b>A.  Toxicity Tests and Safe Concentrations of Residues.</b><p>
The Agency has established safe concentrations for total residues of lasalocid
in turkey tissues as follows:  2.0 ppm in muscle, 6.0 ppm in liver, and 12 ppm
in skin/fat.  These values were determined using the procedure for setting safe
concentrations for veterinary drugs published in the <i>Federal Register</i>&#160; of July
22, 1994 (Volume 59, page 27499).<p>
The toxicity studies that support the safe concentrations listed above are summarized
 in the original Freedom of Information Summary for NADA 96-298.<p>

<b>B.  Total Residue  and Metabolism Studies.</b><p>
The levels of lasalocid total residues in tissues of turkeys were established in
Study Report No. HLR B-107'740 conducted by Dr. D. R. Hawkins at the Huntingdon
Research Centre, England.  In that investigation, sixteen turkeys (eight males
and eight females) were administered 14C-labeled lasalocid at a concentration of
125 ppm (1X) in their feed for 14 days.  The birds were sacrificed at eight hours
(six birds) and at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours (two birds each) following the
medication period. Samples of muscle, liver, kidney, abdominal fat, and
skin/subcutaneous fat were collected and were assayed for total radioactivity.
The average total radioactivity values are listed below.<p>

The patterns of metabolites present in the excreta and livers of turkeys treated
with 14C-lasalocid in the study described above were determined and were compared
with the patterns obtained with three  toxicological test species, the dog, rat,
and mouse. The metabolite profiling procedure involved sample extraction and
fractionation, preparative layer chromatography, and high performance liquid
chromatography analysis of the major fractions
obtained.<p> 

The extraction of the 8-hour turkey livers in the total residue
study showed that approximately 48&#37;  of the tissue radioactivity was
extracted into methanol, while 52&#37; of the radioactivity remained as bound
residue in the liver tissue.  The fractionation and chromatography of the
extracted radioactivity indicated that lasalocid is extensively metabolized.  The
only major component identified in turkey liver was parent lasalocid, which
represented 3.8&#37; of the radioactiviy present.  Unchanged lasalocid
represented 18&#37; of the radioactivity present in dog liver, 28&#37; in mouse
liver, and 32&#37; in rat liver.<p>
The patttern of lasalocid metabolites in turkey excreta was very similar to the
pattern present in mouse feces.  All of the components present in the turkey
pattern  were present in at least one of the toxicological species.<p>
<b>Bioavailability of the Turkey Liver Residue and Calculation of the Liver Total
Residue of Human Food Safety Concern</b><p> A bioavailability study  in the rat
based on the Gallo-Torres model  ("Methodology for the Determination of
Bioavailability of Labeled Residues," H. E. Gallo-Torres, <i> Journal of
Toxicology and Environmental Health ,</i> 2, 827-845 (1977)) was conducted at the
Huntingdon Research Centre, Huntingdon, England (Report SCR 124893) in order to
assess the relative bioavaliability of the lasalocid residue in turkey liver. 
Two groups of four rats each were used to measure the bioavailabilities of the
incurred lasalocid residue in turkey liver and of parent 14C-lasalocid.  The
study yielded bioavailability values of 5.76&#37; for the incurred liver residue
and 43.9&#37; for parent 14C-lasalocid.  This equates to a relative
bioavailability of 13&#37; and allows an 87&#37; discount of the bound lasalocid
residue in turkey liver.<p>

</pre>

A value for the lasalocid turkey liver total residue of concern was determined by
discounting a portion (87&#37;) of the bound residue.  This was done by first
calculating a total residue value for the turkey liver at 6 hours (zero)
withdrawal.  The residue study described in Part B used 8 hours as the zero
withdrawal interval and extrapolation of the data in that study gave a value of
3.76 ppm to use as the turkey liver total residue value at 6 hours off
medication.  The bound portion of the 6 hour liver total residue represents 1.96
ppm. The  extractable portion is the remaining 1.80 ppm, based on 48&#37;
extractability determined in the metabolite profiling work with the residues in
liver (see Part B).<p>
The lasalocid total residue of concern in turkey liver was calculated by adding
the extractable residue (1.80 ppm) and 13&#37; of the bound residue to give a
final value of 2.05 ppm as shown in the following calculation.<p>
 
<pre>

                           &#61;        1.80 ppm         &#43;   0.13   X   1.96 ppm
                           
                           &#61;        2.05 ppm     
                           
</pre>

<b>D.  Withdrawal Time</b><p>
The total residue and liver residue bioavailability data described above support
a zero withdrawal for the use of lasalocid in turkeys.  The total residue of
concern in turkey liver has been calculated to be 2.05 ppm at zero withdrawal.
That value is less than one-half the safe concentration of 6.0 ppm in turkey
liver.  In many cases, total residue studies are conducted at 1.5X (or greater)
the intended dosing rate.  When that is done, the tissue total residue must be
less than the safe concentration to qualify for zero withdrawal, rather than
one-half the safe concentration with the 1X dosing rate as in the case of this
NADA.  <p>
<b>Regulatory Methods</b><p>
No regulatory method is required for the use of lasalocid in turkeys, because the
residue data included in the NADA have met the requirements for zero withdrawal
with waiver of the regulatory method.  Those data have established that, at zero
withdrawal, total redidue concentrations of concern in all edible tissues of
turkeys treated at the intended dosage level of lasalocid are well below the safe
concentraitons listed in Part A.
<p>
<b>7.   AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
The data submitted in support of this supplemental NADA 96-298 satisfy the
requirements of section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA).
The data demonstrate that lasalocid sodium, when used at the proposed
conditions, is safe and effective for the labeled indications.  The approval
provides for the use of lasalocid sodium in the range of 68 to 113 grams per
ton (75 - 125 ppm) of feed, to prevent coccidiosis caused by <i>Eimeria
meleagrimitis, E. gallopavonis</i>&#160;, and <i>E. adenoeides</i>&#160; in growing
turkeys.<p>
Proper use by non-veterinarians can be expected because poultry producers
routinely use medicated feed containing an animal drug for the prevention of
coccidiosis in growing turkeys.  Directions are clearly written and there is
reasonable certainty that the conditions of use, including mixing directions on
the label, can and will be followed by the producer.  The agency has concluded
that this product can be approved for over-the-counter use.  <p>
The data demonstrate that total residues of lasalocid sodium and its
metabolites are well below the safe concentrations in all edible tissues at a
zero withdrawal time.  Consequently, the requirement for a regulatory method to
monitor residues of the drug was waived.<p>
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the FFDCA, this approval for food producing
animals qualifies for THREE years of marketing exclusivity begining on the date
of approval because the supplemental application contains reports of new
clinical or field investigations essential to the approval of the application
and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.  The three years of marketing
exclusivity applies only to the use of lasalocid sodium in growing turkeys, in
the range of 68 to 113 grams per ton (75 - 125 ppm) of feed, to prevent
coccidiosis caused by <i>Eimeria meleagrimitis, E. gallopavonis </i>, and <i>E.
adenoeides </i>.<p>

Substances Prohibited From Use in Animal Food or Feed; Animal 
Proteins Prohibited in Ruminant Feed

AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

ACTION: Proposed rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to amend 
the regulations to provide that animal protein derived from ruminant 
and mink tissues is not generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use in 
ruminant feed, and is a food additive subject to certain provisions of 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act). The proposed 
regulations would establish a flexible system of controls, designed to 
ensure that ruminant feed does not contain animal protein derived from 
ruminant and mink tissues in a manner that encourages innovation. FDA 
is also considering alternatives to this proposed ruminant-to-ruminant 
prohibition, and is requesting comment on the relative merits and 
disadvantages of the alternatives. FDA is proposing this action because 
the feeding to ruminants of protein derived from potentially 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE)-infective tissues may 
cause TSE in animals. TSE's are progressively degenerative central 
nervous system (CNS) diseases of man and animal that are fatal. 
Epidemiologic evidence gathered in the United Kingdom (U.K.) suggests 
an association between an outbreak of a ruminant TSE, specifically 
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and the feeding to cattle of 
protein derived from sheep infected with scrapie, another TSE. Also, 
scientists have postulated that there is an epidemiologic association 
between BSE and a form of human TSE, new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
disease (nv-CJD) reported recently in England. BSE has not been 
diagnosed in the United States. However, this proposed rule is intended 
to prevent the establishment and amplification of BSE in cattle in the 
United States, and thereby minimize any risk which might be faced by 
animals and humans.

DATES: Written comments by February 18, 1997. FDA proposes that any 
final rule that may issue based on this proposal become effective 60 
days after the date of its publication in the Federal Register. Submit 
written comments on the collection of information requirements by February 18, 1997.

ADDRESSES: Submit written comments to the Dockets Management Branch 
(HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 12420 Parklawn Dr., rm. 1-23,

I. Summary

A. Introduction

    In the Federal Register of May 14, 1996 (61 FR 24253), FDA 
published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) that 
solicited information and public comment on the issue of using protein 
derived from ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats, deer, and elk) in 
ruminant feed. The agency requested information and comment on a number 
of issues because it was assessing whether to prohibit the use of 
ruminant protein in ruminant feed. BSE has not been identified in the 
United States. The agency issued an ANPRM because of its concern about 
the possible adverse effect on animal and human health if TSE's were to 
be spread through animal feed. After reviewing the ANPRM comments and 
other sources of information, the agency is proposing to prohibit the 
use of ruminant and mink animal tissue in the feed of ruminants. 
Because TSE has been found in U.S. mink, the agency is also including 
mink tissue in the proposed prohibition. The agency is also considering 
alternatives to the proposed ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition, 
including the alternative of taking no action.

B. GRAS Status of Ruminant and Mink Tissues

    The agency is proposing to declare that protein derived from tissue 
from ruminant animals and mink is not GRAS, by qualified experts, for 
use in ruminant feed and is therefore a ``food additive'' under the 
law. As a result, because neither a food additive regulation nor an 
exemption is in effect for ruminant and mink tissues intended for 
feeding to ruminants, such tissues would be deemed adulterated. Milk 
and gelatin proteins derived from ruminants, and blood from cattle are 
exempt from the proposed prohibition. The proposed rule does not apply 
to any nonprotein animal tissues such as tallow or other fats.
    Expert opinion that the tissues are GRAS would need to be supported 
by scientific literature, and other sources of data and information, 
establishing that there is a reasonable certainty that the material is 
not harmful under the intended conditions of use. Expert opinion would 
need to address topics such as whether it is reasonably certain that 
BSE does not, or will not, occur in the United States; whether it is 
reasonably certain that the BSE agent will not be transmitted through 
animal feed, i.e., that the processed tissues are not infected by the 
agent, are deactivated by the rendering process or are not transmitted 
orally; and whether it is reasonably certain that the agent will not be 
transmitted to humans through consumption of ruminant products. 
``General recognition'' cannot be based on an absence of studies that 
demonstrate that a substance is unsafe; there must be studies to 
establish that the substance is safe. Also, the burden of establishing 
that substance is GRAS is on the proponent of the substance. See U.S. 
v. An Article of Food * * * Co Co Rico, 752 F.2d 11 (1st Cir. 1985).
    Although the ANPRM did not specifically ask for opinion on the GRAS 
issue, a number of comments from scientific organizations and 
individual scientists strongly suggest that the comments would support 
the view that ruminant and mink tissue is not GRAS when fed to 
ruminants. Some of these comments submitted data and information that 
would support such opinions. Only a few comments included statements by 
scientists, or scientific organizations, to the contrary. Similarly, 
the opinions stated by scientists who spoke during a 1996 symposium on 
TSE's would, in general, support the ``nonGRAS'' position. The 
symposium, ``Tissue Distribution, Inactivation and Transmission of 
Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies,'' was cosponsored by FDA and 
USDA, and was held in Riverdale, MD, on May 13 and 14, 1996.
    FDA has searched for but has not found sufficient literature or 
other sources of data and information that would, on balance, support 
expert opinion that ruminant and mink protein is GRAS as a ruminant 
feed additive. Previous comments on the agency's proposal to prohibit 
the feeding of specified sheep and goat offal (59 FR 44584, August 29, 
1994) did not include either written GRAS opinions from qualified 
experts, or data and information that would support such opinions. The 
relevant data and information, and lack thereof, are discussed more 
fully in this section, and in section II. of this document. See Section 
III.A., of this document, for a further explanation of ``GRAS'' and 
``food additive.''

C. The ``No Action'' Alternative

    Even when, as in this case, FDA has taken steps leading to a 
tentative determination that a substance added to food is not GRAS, the 
agency is not required to issue a proposal declaring that the substance 
is not GRAS and is a food additive subject to section 409 of the act. 
Section 570.38 provides that the agency may take such an action. The 
agency considered the possibility of not issuing a proposal with regard 
to the feeding of ruminant and mink tissues to ruminants.
    The fact that the data and information do not document an immediate 
threat to the U.S. public health supports this ``no action'' 
alternative. Moreover, certain of the available data and information 
can be used to support the view that the threat, if any, is minimal.
    The evidence suggesting that there is no immediate threat is 
summarized as follows. First, BSE has not been detected in cattle in 
the United States despite an extensive surveillance effort that has 
been in place for several years. Restrictions on the importation of 
cattle, cattle products and feed ingredients from BSE-affected 
countries are in place to minimize the possibility of BSE entering into 
the United States. Surveillance, training of veterinary practitioners 
and diagnosticians, and other efforts are in place to detect any 
occurrence of BSE quickly, and to minimize its spread among the cattle 
population. No empirical scientific evidence is available to establish 
that BSE will occur from any of the possible sources, such as 
transmission from another U.S. species in which TSE's have been 
diagnosed; spontaneous occurrence in cattle; or importation of live 
animals or animal feed products carrying the BSE agent. For example, 
transmission between any two species is difficult to predict, based on 
available data, because of variability in species barriers (Ref. 1).
    Second, even if BSE did develop in the United States there is no 
conclusive scientific evidence that the disease would be spread through 
animal feed, the product that provides FDA's jurisdictional nexis. 
Although there is strong epidemiological evidence that the feeding of 
processed tissue from sheep containing scrapie to cattle caused the 
widespread BSE infections in the United Kingdom, many experts believe 
that the chances that the United States will have a BSE outbreak, 
similar to the epidemic that took place in the United Kingdom, are low. 
For example, most of the industry practices and other conditions 
believed to have been associated with the BSE epidemic in the United 
Kingdom do not exist in the United States. Further, the U.K. 
epidemiological evidence of transfer from sheep to cattle has not been 
confirmed by direct scientific data. This has caused some to question 
the assumption that the BSE originated from scrapie (Ref. 1). Further, 
some

[[Page 554]]

experimental information suggests that the TSE's in general are not 
readily transferred by the oral route. Experimentally, the oral route 
has been suggested to be the least efficient means of transmission for 
TSE's (Ref. 1).
    Third, the postulated connection between BSE and CJD has not been 
definitively established. Scientists have theorized an association 
between BSE and the recent appearance of nv-CJD in the United Kingdom. 
While the epidemiological association, both in time and geography, of 
these two diseases in the United Kingdom provides suggestive evidence 
of an association between the two, the available evidence does not 
establish causation. Although the BSE agent has been transmitted to 
laboratory animals, the species barrier between cattle and humans may 
be higher than between cattle and mice (Ref. 1). Epidemiological 
evidence linking BSE with classical CJD is even less supportive. 
Although CJD occurs in the United States, nv-CJD has not been reported 
in this country.
    The FDA's conclusion that there is no immediate threat to the 
public health in the United States is supported by a statement from the 
World Health Organization (WHO) that the ``risk, if any, of exposure to 
the BSE agent in countries other than the U.K. is considered lower than 
in the U.K.'' (Ref. 2). A number of comments to the ANPRM made a 
similar assertion, urging that FDA's regulatory decision be made on the 
basis of scientific information and contending that the available 
information did not support the contemplated action.

D. The Basis for the Agency's Proposed Action

1. General Discussion
    Even though there is no immediate threat to the U.S. public health 
and some information that indicates that a threat, if any, is minimal, 
after careful consideration the agency has tentatively concluded that 
regulatory action is necessary to protect animal and human health. The 
agency has reached that tentative conclusion because there is a growing 
body of data and information that affirmatively raises public health 
concerns.
    The data and information raise concern that BSE could occur in 
cattle in the United States; and that if BSE does appear in this 
country, the causative agent could be transmitted and amplified through 
the feeding of processed ruminant protein to cattle, and could result 
in an epidemic. The agency believes that the high cost, in animal and 
human lives and economics, that could result if this scenario should 
occur, justifies the preventive measure reflected by the proposed 
regulation. Although the agency expects some continued voluntary 
reduction in the feeding of ruminant and mink tissues to ruminants, the 
reduction is not expected to be extensive enough to obviate the need 
for mandatory preventive measures.
    Statements from several prominent public and animal health 
organizations support this proposal to regulate the feeding of ruminant 
tissues to ruminant animals. For example, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) has urged the agency to adopt a ruminant-
to-ruminant feed prohibition (Ref. 3), and USDA has recommended the 
same action. Although WHO considers the risk in countries such as the 
United States to be minimal, that organization has nevertheless called 
on all countries to prohibit the use of ruminant tissues in ruminant 
feed (Ref. 2).
    A number of comments to the ANPRM, including comments by several 
consumer groups, supported regulatory action by FDA. The Pharmaceutical 
Research and Manufacturers of America urged FDA to take all necessary 
steps to prevent an outbreak of BSE, and to prevent the potential 
spread of BSE should a case occur in the United States. One 
pharmaceutical firm emphasized the importance of acknowledging public 
perception, stating that a ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition would 
``significantly decrease the concern regarding this perceived risk.'' 
Another pharmaceutical firm characterized the risk as ``small but 
real.'' A group of livestock producers, veterinary associations and 
scientific organizations cited the WHO recommendations to support their 
call for a voluntary ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition. The group stated 
that such a prohibition would ``eliminate any risk, no matter how 
remote [and would] totally prevent BSE from ever occurring in the 
United States.''
    The agency is concerned about the public health issues raised but 
not resolved by the available scientific information. The fact that the 
causative agent or agents for TSE's have not been clearly identified, 
and their transmissibility has not been fully characterized, adds to 
the concern. However, certain information that is well documented 
supports the agency's decision as well. TSE's are 100-percent fatal 
diseases that have been diagnosed in humans and a number of animal 
species. The diseases are progressively degenerative CNS diseases that 
are characterized by a relatively short clinical course of neurological 
signs. TSE's have a prolonged incubation period, i.e., 2 to 8 years in 
animals, and scientific evidence supports the view that TSE's can be 
transmitted in the preclinical stage. There is no practical method to 
detect the presence of TSE's during the preclinical stage.
2. Analysis of Risk Factors
    This section describes the evidence that supports the agency's 
tentative conclusion. The evidence relates to the risks that BSE could 
occur in cattle in the United States; that the BSE agent or other TSE 
agents could be amplified in the cattle population by the feeding of 
ruminant and mink tissues to cattle; and that the agent could 
potentially be transmitted to humans.
    a. The risk of BSE occurring in the United States. BSE has not been 
diagnosed in the United States. FDA does not have evidence to support 
the theory that BSE already exists, undiagnosed, in this country. 
However, the agency does find plausible the arguments of the theory 
that BSE could develop in the United States from three possible 
sources: Transmission of TSE's from other susceptible species, 
spontaneous occurrence, and importation in live animals or animal 
products.
    The evidence concerning transmission from other species is 
summarized as follows. TSE's other than BSE have been diagnosed in 
animals in the United States. These include scrapie in sheep and goats, 
transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME), and chronic wasting disease 
(CWD) in deer and elk. Feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE) has been 
diagnosed in cats in other countries. In general, the TSE's have been 
shown to be naturally transmissible within species and are believed by 
some scientists to be naturally transmissible (as distinguished from 
experimentally transmissible), at least to a limited extent, between 
species. Consumption of meat and bone meal (the predominant animal 
tissue-containing product fed to animals) which was produced under 
conditions similar to the meat and bone meal which was implicated in 
the U.K. BSE epidemic, as well as the feeding of raw bovine tissue, 
also appeared to cause TSE in exotic cats and various zoo animals. This 
implies that the species barrier for BSE may be uncharacteristically 
low. (See e.g., Refs. 3 and 4). In addition to the epidemiological 
evidence relating to TSE transmission from sheep to cattle in the 
United Kingdom, there is limited experimental evidence of transmission

[[Page 555]]

of the BSE agent from cattle to sheep. Many laboratory animal species 
have also been experimentally infected following the administration of 
tissues from animals with TSE disease.
    There is some evidence to support the theory that BSE can occur 
spontaneously in cattle. The leading theory as to the causative agent, 
e.g., infectious protein or prion, inherently suggests that the BSE 
could occur spontaneously. Additional support arises from the fact that 
85 percent of CJD cases are sporadic, and have no familial or 
identifiable link as to their cause. Recent surveillance information 
from Northern Ireland and Switzerland also supports the spontaneous 
theory. In these countries, BSE has occurred in cases in which no 
exposure to rendered protein can be found, and there is no evidence of 
BSE in the parental stock or herd mates of affected animals (Ref. 5).
    As described more fully in section II.F.1.b. of this document, 
USDA-APHIS has implemented import restrictions on live animals and 
animal products from BSE-affected countries. As a result of the 
restrictions, the potential risk of BSE occurring in this country as a 
result of exposure from imported cattle and imported animal protein 
products appears to be small (Ref. 6). However, the risk from foreign 
sources of BSE introduction into the United States cannot be dismissed 
entirely because the USDA import restrictions are unlikely to be 100 
percent effective even though no cases of BSE have been diagnosed to 
date in the United States. The USDA regulations are intended to reduce 
or control risk, not completely eliminate it. See e.g., 56 FR 63866, 
December 6, 1991.
    b. The risk of amplification in the cattle population. Research has 
shown that various animal tissues can transmit BSE infectivity. There 
is also evidence supporting the view that the agent could be 
transmitted orally (e.g., through animal feed). Although some 
experimental evidence suggests that the TSE's in general are more 
readily transmitted by means other that the oral route, research also 
suggests that the BSE agent is more susceptible to oral transmission. 
In most cases (e.g., the U.K. epidemic) the natural route of exposure 
to TSE's including BSE is suspected to be oral. This belief is 
supported by the dramatic decline in BSE cases in the United Kingdom 
following implementation of the ruminant-to-ruminant feeding 
prohibition. In the United Kingdom, where more than 160,000 cases of 
BSE have been diagnosed, a 1988 ban on the feeding of ruminant-derived 
protein supplements to other ruminants was associated with a steady 
decrease in the disease incidence starting in 1993. The 5-year period 
between the initiation of the ruminant-to-ruminant ban and the decline 
in the incidence of BSE is consistent with the known incubation period 
in cattle of 2 to 8 years. Further, preliminary experimental data show 
that the BSE agent can be transmitted orally to cattle through feeding 
of material from an infected cow (Ref. 3). Thus, there is a chance that 
BSE could be spread in animal feed if it developed in the U.S. cattle 
population, whether spontaneously, from another species or by some 
other means.
    The greatest risk factor for cattle may not be the single 
occurrence of a BSE case. Instead, the greatest risk may arise from the 
potential, given the prolonged incubation period, for unrecognized 
amplification of BSE in the cattle population, resulting in a potential 
for greater animal exposure. The possibility of risk from recycling 
ruminant tissues is enhanced by the fact that current rendering methods 
have not been shown, and are not expected, to completely deactivate the 
BSE agent, and that practical tests are not available for detecting 
either the BSE agent in rendered material or the presence of ruminant 
material in feed.
    The preliminary experimental cow-to-cow TSE transmission data 
previously described occurred with as little as a single dose (one-time 
exposure) of 1 gram of brain material from the infected cow, indicating 
a low transmitting dose. This means, among other things, that FDA 
cannot determine the level of feed ingredients from animals tissues, if 
any, that is considered safe in ruminants.
    c. The risk of transmission of humans. Finally, there exists the 
theoretical possibility of the transmission of a TSE in animals, such 
as BSE, to humans. CDC agrees that the link between BSE, and TSE's in 
humans, has not been fully demonstrated. Some of the ANPRM comments 
agreed. For example, one pharmaceutical firm stated that the evidence 
is not entirely conclusive. Nevertheless, a body of epidemiological and 
experimental evidence is developing to support the postulated 
association between BSE and nv-CJD. This and other scientific evidence 
developed more fully in section II leads the agency to propose for 
comment the prudent risk reduction regulatory action that is 
incorporated in the proposed rule.

E. Enforcement Provisions

    The agency is issuing this proposed rule within the context of 
comprehensive government-wide efforts to minimize the risks previously 
described, and within the statutory authority provided to the agency. 
The proposed rule has two major components. First, the agency proposes 
to prohibit feeding animal materials derived from ruminant and mink 
tissues to ruminants, in the absence of a food additive regulation or 
investigational exemption. Thus, the prohibition would ensure that 
tissues which could contribute to a TSE epidemic by spreading the 
causative agent rapidly would not be allowed in ruminant feed.
    The second component of the rule provides for a system of controls 
to ensure that the proposed rule would achieve its intended purpose. 
These provisions are necessary because limited controls are in place, 
or available, to prevent the spread of BSE through animal feed in the 
United States, should BSE occur. The proposed regulation places two 
general requirements on persons that manufacture, blend, process and 
distribute animal protein products, and feeds made from such products. 
The first requirement is to place cautionary labeling on the protein 
and feed products. The second is to provide FDA with access to sales 
and purchase invoices, for compliance purposes.
    Firms that handle animal protein products from both ruminant and 
nonruminant sources, and that intend to keep the two kinds of products 
separate, would have certain additional requirements. These 
requirements would relate to the need for separate facilities or 
cleanout procedures; the need for standard operating procedures 
(SOP's); and in the case of renderers, their source of nonruminant 
material. Similar requirements would be placed on firms that handle 
animal feed containing animal protein products from both ruminant and 
nonruminant sources, and intend to keep the two kinds of feed separate. 
Requirements would be greater for the firms that intend to separate the 
animal protein products and feeds, because of the greater risk these 
operations would present for the possibility that ruminant protein 
might be fed, inadvertently, to ruminants.
    However, the regulatory system would be flexible, allowing the 
regulated firms to innovate and choose the most cost-effective means of 
compliance. For example, some or all of the regulatory requirements 
previously described would not apply if any of the following 
innovations were developed and validated by FDA: Processing methods 
that deactivate the agent that causes BSE; test methods to detect the 
presence of the agent; or methods of marking or otherwise identifying 
the

[[Page 556]]

material that contains ruminant protein. Further, the agency will 
consider modifying or revoking any final rule that is published 
prohibiting the use of ruminant and mink tissues in ruminant feed, if 
scientific and technical advances permit even greater flexibility than 
that offered in the proposed regulation. Conversely, the diagnosis of 
one or more cases of BSE in the United States, or new scientific 
findings, could lead to stricter regulatory requirements.

F. Alternatives

    The agency is soliciting comments on several alternative means of 
minimizing the risk of transmitting TSE's in ruminant feed, in addition 
to the proposed ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition. These alternatives 
include:
    (1) A partial ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition which would exclude 
all ruminant and mink tissues from ruminant feed except those bovine 
tissues that have not been found to present a risk of transmitting 
spongiform encephalopathy. Possible exclusions include slaughter 
byproducts from cattle that have been inspected and passed in inspected 
slaughter facilities, except tissues that have been shown through 
experimental trials and bioassays to transmit spongiform 
encephalopathy. Examples of the latter might include the brain, eyes, 
spinal cord and distal ileum. The agency solicits comments on the scope 
of this alternative;
    (2) A prohibition on the feeding of all mammalian tissues to 
ruminants;
    (3) A prohibition on the feeding of rendered material from those 
animal species in which TSE's have been diagnosed in the United States 
(sheep, goats, mink, elk, and deer);
    (4) A prohibition on the feeding of specified offal from adult 
sheep and goats as proposed in 1994;
    (5) Other alternative approaches that meet the agency's regulatory 
objectives and that might be suggested in comments to the proposed 
rule. The agency may in any final rule issued adopt such alternative 
approaches. Such alternatives may be more or less stringent than this 
proposal or may be a combination of provisions from this proposal and 
other alternatives. For example, one such option might be a proposal to 
exclude from the scope of any regulation certain facilities that apply 
specified risk-reduction measures in addition to, or in place of, those 
included in the regulation FDA is proposing in this publication. 
Therefore, the agency specifically requests comments on other 
approaches that would achieve the agency's regulatory objectives. Any 
proposed alternative approaches should be explained in detail, and 
their justification should be well documented. To the extent possible, 
please include information on costs and benefits of the proposals; and
    (6) The ``no action'' alternative as it relates to this proposed 
rule. Again, detailed explanation and well-documented justification 
should be presented.
    The agency's views on the advantages and disadvantages of these 
options appears in section V of this document. The agency invites 
comments on the relative merits and disadvantages of all these 
alternative concepts.
    FDA has estimated that the annualized costs of the proposal, 
comprised of both the direct compliance costs and various indirect 
gains and losses, would range from $21.4 to $48.2 million. The agency 
also estimated that the annualized costs could range from $45.0 to 
$56.5 million for the mammalian-to-ruminant option; from $28.5 to $37.3 
million for the partial ruminant-to-ruminant option; and would total 
less than $10 million for each of the remaining options. On the other 
hand, if the agency chooses the ``no action'' option and a BSE epidemic 
occurs, the above costs could be expanded by a great magnitude.
    Because the body of scientific research related to TSE's is growing 
rapidly, the agency will place in the Docket copies of relevant 
scientific literature published after the agency completes work on this 
proposal, and before the agency completes work on any final regulation. 
The agency will add to the Docket, as appropriate, a brief statement of 
its assessment of the significance of the literature, and will invite 
comments. However, substantive changes from the proposed rule would be 
made in accordance with the discussions in the preceding paragraphs and 
the Administrative Procedure Act.

II. Background

A. TSE's

1. Scrapie
    Scrapie is a slowly progressive, transmissible disease of the CNS 
in sheep and goats. Scrapie is characterized by a prolonged incubation 
period averaging 2 years, followed by a clinical course of 2 to 6 
months when the animal exhibits sensory and motor malfunction, 
hyperexcitability, and death. The agent presumably moves from infected 
to susceptible animals by direct or indirect contact and enters through 
the gastrointestinal tract. Consequently, its spread appears to be both 
vertical (mother to offspring in utero) (Ref. 7) and horizontal (direct 
contact) between sheep (Ref. 8). Early signs of scrapie include subtle 
changes in behavior or temperament which may be followed by scratching 
and rubbing against fixed objects. Other signs include loss of 
coordination, weight loss despite a good appetite, biting of feet and 
limbs, tremor around head and neck, and unusual walking habits (Ref. 
9).
    The scrapie agent is found in lymphatic tissue (spleen, thymus, 
tonsil, and lymph nodes) in sheep with preclinical infections; however, 
in clinically affected sheep, the agent is identified in the 
intestines, nervous tissues (brain and spinal cord), and lymphatic 
tissues as determined by experimental infectivity studies in a 
susceptible animal model (Ref. 8). The brain has been demonstrated to 
have the highest level of infectivity of all tissues (Ref. 10).
    Scrapie is known to have existed in Britain, Ireland, France, and 
Germany for over 200 years. It has been observed in the United States 
and Canada for about 50 years. The first case of scrapie in the United 
States was diagnosed in Michigan in 1947. From 1947 through January 
1993, approximately 653 flocks have been diagnosed with scrapie (Ref. 
11). At the present time, there are 67 known scrapie-infected flocks 
(flocks with sheep diagnosed with scrapie), and there are 8 known 
scrapie-source flocks (flocks to which scrapie-infected sheep were 
traced) (Ref. 12). In the absence of an antemortem diagnostic test, it 
is not possible to establish with absolute certainty that a flock is 
free of scrapie. Moreover, lack of reporting, the long incubation 
period, and open range husbandry practices in the western United States 
make it difficult to detect classical clinical signs and completely 
monitor scrapie in the United States.
2. BSE
    BSE is a transmissible, slowly progressive, degenerative disease of 
the CNS of adult cattle. This disease has a prolonged incubation period 
in cattle following oral exposure (2 to 8 years) and is always fatal. 
BSE is characterized by abnormalities of behavior, sensation, posture, 
and gait. These signs are similar to those seen in sheep that are 
infected with scrapie. BSE is associated with spongiform lesions in the 
gray matter neuropil of the brainstem and neuronal vacuolization (Ref. 
13). The clinical signs usually begin with changes in animal behavior, 
and may include separation from the rest of the herd while at pasture, 
disorientation, or excessive licking of the nose or flanks (Ref. 14). 
The most common history given by the herdsman was nervousness

[[Page 557]]

or altered behavior or temperament, weakness associated with pelvic 
limb ataxia, paresis, and loss of body weight (Ref. 15). In some 
animals there are few gross pathological changes at necropsy associated 
with BSE other than the loss of body weight. However, postmortem 
histopathology of BSE distinguish it from other neurological disorders 
(Refs. 16 and 17). Neither vertical nor horizontal transmission has 
been documented for BSE.
    BSE was first recognized as a new cattle disease by researchers at 
the Central Veterinary Laboratory of the British Ministry of 
Agriculture, Fisheries, and Foods at Weybridge, England in November 
1986. As of November 15, 1996, BSE had been diagnosed in Great Britain 
in more than 165,000 head of cattle from more than 31,000 herds. Cases 
have been confirmed in 59.2 percent of the dairy herds and 15.3 percent 
of the beef herds (Ref. 18). The BSE epidemic curve for Great Britain 
peaked in January 1993 and is decreasing steadily, concomitantly with 
changes in rendering and feeding practices. BSE has also been reported 
in native cattle of Northern Ireland, Guernsey, Jersey, Isle of Man, 
the Republic of Ireland, Switzerland, France, and Portugal. BSE has 
been confirmed in cattle exported from Great Britain to Oman, the 
Falkland Islands, Germany, Denmark, Canada, and Italy.
    There have been no cases of BSE in cattle in the United States. 
There has been one case of BSE in a cow imported into Canada from Great 
Britain. That cow was destroyed, along with its herdmates and other 
nearby cattle considered by animal health authorities in Canada to have 
possibly been exposed to the cow with BSE (Ref. 19).
3. Other Animal TSE's
    Other animals have TSE's with typical characteristics of long 
incubation, neurological degeneration, and a 100-percent death rate. 
These animals include: Mink, elk and deer, zoo ruminants, and exotic 
and domestic cats.
    TME is a mink disease with clinical signs and brain lesions similar 
to those of sheep infected with scrapie. TME is a rare disease in the 
United States. Since the disease was first recognized in 1947, in 
Wisconsin, four additional outbreaks have occurred in the United 
States. The last outbreak occurred in 1985 and was limited to a single 
mink ranch in Wisconsin (Ref. 20).
    CWD of deer and elk is characterized by emaciation, changes in 
behavior and excessive salivation, polydipsia, and polyuria. The 
clinical course is from several weeks to 8 months, and the disease is 
invariably fatal (Ref. 20). From 1967 to 1979, CWD was observed in 53 
captive mule deer in Colorado and Wyoming. Clinical signs were seen in 
adult deer and included behavioral alterations, progressive weight loss 
and death in 2 weeks to 8 months. Consistent histopathologic change was 
limited to the CNS and characterized by widespread spongiform 
transformation of the neuropil. The disease is a specific, 
spontaneously occurring form of spongiform encephalopathy (Ref. 21). 
Topographic distribution and lesion severity were most similar to those 
of scrapie and BSE. The duration of the clinical disease did not 
significantly influence lesion distribution or severity in either 
species (Ref. 22).
    Scrapie-like encephalopathies have been described in certain zoo 
ruminants, i.e., a nyala, an Arabian oryx, and a greater kudu. Clinical 
signs included ataxia and loss of coordination with a short, 
progressive clinical course. Histopathological examination of the 
brains revealed spongiform encephalopathy characteristic of that 
observed in scrapie and BSE (Refs. 23, 24, and 25). Strain typing of 
the agent suggests that all of the cases are directly related to BSE.
    Seventy domestic cats in the United Kingdom have developed FSE, a 
spongiform encephalopathy that was never previously reported. The cats 
all had progressive, neurological disease involving locomotor 
disturbances, abnormal behavior and, in most cases, altered sensory 
responses. Histopathological examination of the central nervous system 
revealed changes pathognomonic of spongiform encephalopathy; this 
included widespread vacuolization of the gray matter neuropil and 
neuronal perikarya (Refs. 26 and 27). Infective tissue from several of 
these cases, when injected into mice, resulted in brain lesions with a 
distribution and morphology that is undistinguishable from the lesions 
produced by BSE infective tissue injected into mice.
4. TSE's of Humans
    The TSE's of humans are divided into specific clinical types, which 
may appear similar histopathologically but are either transmitted 
differently or demonstrate different patterns of distribution and 
prevalence.
    a. CJD. CJD was first described in 1920 and 1921 when it was known 
as ``spastic pseudosclerosis'' or ``subacute spongiform 
encephalopathy'' (Ref. 28). The illness exists throughout the world and 
is claimed to have a similar prevalence in each of the countries tested 
with an annual incidence of approximately one case per million of the 
population. Autopsies are sometimes not performed on persons who may 
have died of CJD and many older people dying of a dementing illness do 
not have autopsies performed. There is an increased incidence among 
Libyan Jews (26 cases per million) and spatial or temporal clusters in 
areas of Slovakia, Hungary, England, the United States, and Chile. The 
average age of a typical CJD victim is 56 years of age, and only a few 
cases involving persons between 4 and 29 years have been reported prior 
to 1993. Between 4 and 15 percent of cases have a familial connection 
with other cases. There is a slightly higher incidence of CJD in women 
compared to men. Clinical prodromal symptoms start with changes in 
sleeping and eating patterns, and often include confusion, 
inappropriate behavior, vague visual complaints and/or ataxia. Those 
symptoms progress over a few weeks to a clearly neurological syndrome. 
A rapid onset of neurological symptoms appears in 20 percent of cases, 
most commonly myoclonic jerks and dementia with loss of higher brain 
function and behavioral abnormalities. The disease progresses with 
continued deterioration in cerebral and cerebellar function, and the 
onset of seizures. Ninety percent of the cases end in death within 1 
year of onset. Diagnosis is by clinical assessment of patients and by 
examination of electroencephalogram patterns. Post mortem diagnosis is 
currently carried out by histological examination of cerebral tissue 
under the light microscope, although this is not always reliable. 
Research techniques that have been used to demonstrate CJD (and other 
TSE's) include electron microscopic examination of brain tissue 
extracts for scrapie-associated fibrils (SAF), immuno-staining of the 
tissue for prion-protein (PrP) antigens, western blotting of extracted 
PrP antigens and the intracerebral injection of tissue suspensions into 
test animals.
    In some patients, the source of CJD has been claimed to be an 
infection transferred from other patients with the condition. For 
example, in one case, cerebral electrodes that had been sterilized with 
alcohol and formalin vapor after use in a patient with CJD, were used 
in the brains of two young epileptic patients, both of whom contracted 
CJD after a short incubation. The transfer of CJD by corneal transplant 
in 1 patient, by cadaveric dura mater grafts in several patients and by 
pituitary-derived human growth hormone injections in over 80 patients 
has also been reported.

[[Page 558]]

    Only the medical procedures described previously have been 
conclusively linked to transmission. The transmission of the disease 
from animal sources has been suggested; see further discussion in 
section II.C. of this document.
    b. nv-CJD. A previously undetected new variant of CJD (nv-CJD) was 
reported by British scientists at a meeting of international experts 
convened by WHO on April 2 and 3, 1996 (Ref. 29), and published 3 days 
later (Ref. 30).
    The major evidence for the existence of nv-CJD is the recognition 
of a new neuropathologic profile and the unusually young ages of 10 
U.K. patients. Although all the cases had evidence of the pathognomonic 
spongiform changes characteristic of classic CJD, and therefore were 
appropriately classified as a form of CJD, the clinical course of the 
disease was atypical of classic CJD. The most striking and consistent 
neuropathologic feature of nv-CJD was the formation of amyloid plaques 
surrounded by halos of spongiform change. Plaques were extensively 
distributed throughout the cerebrum and cerebellum. Many of these 
plaques resembled those in kuru and were visible when examined by 
routine staining methods.
    The temporal cluster of cases of nv-CJD in young patients (three 
were teenagers, five were in their twenties, and two were in their 
thirties at onset of disease) is highly unusual. Five of the eight 
deceased patients died before 30 years of age. (The expected annual 
mortality rate for CJD in persons under 30 years of age is less than 
five per billion.) The characteristic clinical features of the nv-CJD 
cases were: (1) A psychiatric presentation, (2) onset of a progressive 
cerebellum syndrome with ataxia within weeks or months of the initial 
presentation, (3) memory impairment with dementia in the late stages, 
(4) myoclonus, and (5) the absence of electroencephalographic changes 
typical of classic CJD.
    Review of the patients' medical histories and consideration of 
various risk factors for CJD yielded no adequate clues as to the cause 
of this disease. The PrP genotype was determined for eight cases. The 
researchers noted that all genotypes were methionine homozygotes at 
codon 129 of the PrP gene. The research did not identify any of the 
known mutations associated with the inherited forms of CJD (Ref. 30).
    Although scientists have stated that exposure to the BSE agent 
prior to the U.K. bans described in section II.F. of this document is 
the most plausible explanation for these findings, no clear 
epidemiologic link to BSE was identified. (See further discussion in 
section II.C. of this document.) Another potential explanation is 
exposure to TSE agents from animals other than cattle. Because the 
United Kingdom reinstituted epidemiological surveillance for CJD in 
1990, increased surveillance is still another potential reason for the 
identification of this cluster of 10 cases of nv-CJD.
    c. Gertsmann-Strausller-Scheinker (GSS) syndrome. GSS syndrome is 
an autosomal dominant condition in about 50 percent of siblings of 
reference cases (Ref. 28). The disease is similar to CJD except that it 
has a more extended onset and duration, a tendency towards cerebellar 
ataxia as the initial predominant neurological sign, and a large number 
of amyloid plaques present among the spongiform encephalopathic changes 
of the brain. The extensive distribution of amyloid plaques in the 
patient's brain is an observation shared by GSS syndrome and v-CJD. It 
has been transmitted to monkeys and rodents by intracerebral 
inoculation.
    d. Kuru. Kuru is a condition of the Fore people of the Okapa 
district of the Eastern Highland in Papua New Guinea, in which a 
practice of ritual cannibalism of fellow tribesmen took place until 
approximately 1956 (Ref. 28). This TSE disease, which affected mainly 
adult women and children of both sexes, caused an annual disease 
specific mortality of approximately 3 percent. Most deaths of women in 
the tribe occurred through this disease. Some men who died from this 
disease were thought to have contracted it when they were young. Kuru 
may be transmitted by eating infected tissue or through open wounds. 
The brains of dead tribal members were eaten by women and children and 
the muscle tissue by men. The cohort of children born since 1957 have 
not suffered from kuru at all.
    Clinically the disease causes a progressive cerebellar ataxia, 
uncoordinated movements, neurological weakness, palsies, and decay in 
brain stem function. Most patients dying of kuru are not demented, a 
major clinical difference between kuru and CJD.
    e. Fatal familial insomnia (FFI). FFI is another inherited TSE-
linked disease (Ref. 31). FFI is characterized clinically by 
untreatable progressive insomnia, dysautonomia, and motor dysfunctions. 
The disease often starts between 35 and 60 years of age and leads to 
death within 7 to 32 months. FFI is characterized pathologically by 
atrophy, neuronal loss, and gliosis in the anterior and dorsomedial 
nuclei of the thalamus (Ref. 32). FFI has been successfully transmitted 
to mice (Ref. 33), but not to primates.
5. Etiology
    The cause of TSE's is controversial. The TSE agent: (1) Is 
presumably smaller than most viral particles and is highly resistant to 
heat, ultraviolet light, ionizing radiation, and common disinfectants 
that normally inactivate viruses or bacteria; (2) causes little 
detectable immune or inflammatory response in the host; and (3) has not 
been observed microscopically.
    Resistance of the TSE agent to physical and chemical methods that 
destroy nucleic acid have essentially ruled out conventional 
microbiological agents as the cause. Currently, the infectious protein 
or prion theory is favored. Other proposed causes are an unconventional 
virus, consisting of virus-coded protein and virus-specific nucleic 
acid with unconventional properties, and a ``virino'' consisting of a 
core of nontranslated nucleic acid associated with host cell proteins 
(Ref. 34). Proposed causes of TSE's with less supporting evidence are: 
(1) Retroviruses (Ref. 35), (2) a spiroplasma (Refs. 36 and 37), (3) 
organophosphates (Ref. 38), and (4) peptide hormones (Ref. 39).
    The prion theory suggests that the causative agent is a normal host 
protein (PrP or PrP-C) that is posttranslationally transformed into the 
causative agent or PrP-Sc. Transformation of the PrP can occur from 
rare somatic mutation of the prion gene, spontaneously or from contact 
with extraneous PrP-Sc. The spread of BSE in the United Kingdom is 
postulated to have occurred through the feeding of ruminant protein 
that contained the PrP-Sc protein and thus follows the portion of the 
theory that involves contact with extraneous PrP-Sc. This explanation 
requires that one accept that abnormal prion protein from sheep crossed 
the species barrier and resulted in BSE in cattle. An alternate 
explanation is that a spontaneous mutation or transformation or other 
nonorally induced event, occurred and resulted in undetected disease in 
a bovine. These explanations are not mutually exclusive and it is 
possible that both occurred.
    Recent surveillance information from Northern Ireland and 
Switzerland tend to support the spontaneous mutation as a method by 
which BSE can occur. Northern Ireland has had more than 10 cows produce 
offspring, after the feeding ban, that developed BSE. Thus, 10+ cases 
are theorized to be spontaneous because there is no evidence of feeding 
meat and bone meal to the offspring and the dams are alive

[[Page 559]]

and show no signs of BSE (Ref. 5). Switzerland, which has one of the 
most aggressive BSE investigational surveillance of any European Union 
(EU) country, has reported 205 cases of BSE. Some of these cases are in 
animals that were fed only grass and hay (Ref. 5). Regardless of how 
the initial cases occurred, however, the resulting unrecognized disease 
was amplified by the feeding of ruminant protein to ruminants.
    Additional support for the feasibility of the TSE spontaneous 
mutation explanation is the fact that 85 percent of all CJD cases are 
sporadic and have no familial or identifiable link as to their cause. 
It is these cases that give rise to the very stable, 1 in a million per 
year, world wide incidence of the disease. DeArmond and Prusiner (Ref. 
40), and Lansbury and Caughey (Ref. 41) have postulated that a 
noninduced somatic cell mutation or the spontaneous conversion of PrP-C 
into PrP-Sc are plausible explanations for the sporadic cases of CJD. 
DeArmond and Prusiner theorized that the 1 in a million

    * * * may represent the combined probabilities that a mutation 
occurs in the PRNP gene, the probability that the mutation leads to 
the synthesis of the PrP-cjd (the abnormal protein), and the 
probability that the resultant PrP-cjd targets other neurons for the 
synthesis of more PrP-cjd at a rate fast enough to cause clinical 
disease in the patient's lifetime.

    The etiology of human and animal TSE's are similar. Therefore the 
spontaneous mutation explanation cannot be dismissed with regard to 
BSE.
6. Pathogenesis
    Following oral exposure of goats or sheep to the scrapie agent, the 
agent first accumulates in gut-associated lymphoid organs (tonsils and 
Peyers patches of terminal ileum) and later in other lymphoid organs, 
such as spleen and thymus, and finally in the spinal cord and brain 
(Ref. 8).
    Likewise, in mice inoculated intra-peritoneally with the CJD agent, 
the agent localizes first in Peyer's patches and spleen, followed by 
the central nervous system (Ref. 42). The agent may enter the body 
through macrophages in the tonsils and domes over Peyer's patches in 
the intestine (distal ileum). The proposed routes of spread from the 
point of entry to other tissues and central nervous system are blood 
stream or nerve trunks. In experimentally inoculated animals, spread 
from the inoculation site in the eye of monkeys and peritoneum of mice 
has been shown to be by optic and splanchnic nerves respectively (Ref. 
43).
    Other investigators have demonstrated transient infectivity in the 
blood of experimentally infected laboratory animals, and naturally 
occurring infections of humans and mink, causing speculation that the 
agent is carried in the blood (Refs. 45 to 49). With one exception in 
serum (Ref. 50), all attempts to isolate TSE agents from the blood or 
milk of sheep or cattle have failed (Refs. 51 to 54). When TSE agents 
are injected intravenously into mice, the rate of clearance from the 
blood is extremely rapid (Ref. 55). In natural cases of BSE, 
infectivity has been found only in the brain, spinal cord, and eye; in 
experimental cases the agent has also been identified in the ileum 
(Ref. 56).
    The question of disease mechanism remains open. Candidate 
mechanisms are the storage or accumulation of a large amount of 
abnormal PrP in the brain (Refs. 57 to 60), or insufficient amounts of 
normal PrP.
7. Transmission
    There is little information about the natural transmission of TSE's 
of animals. In most cases the natural route of exposure to the TSE 
agent is suspected to be oral, although genetic disposition is known to 
play a role in sheep scrapie (Ref. 61). Investigators have suspected 
transmission of scrapie in sheep and goats by ingestion of placenta and 
have been successful in experimentally transmitting scrapie by feeding 
placenta to sheep (Ref. 62); however, genotyping of the PrP gene was 
not conducted.
    In 1993, a study by Foster, et al., (Ref. 63) using a line of sheep 
in which natural scrapie does not occur demonstrated that sheep can be 
experimentally infected with BSE by intracerebral or oral 
administration. The intracerebral challenge resulted in five of six 
sheep developing the disease. The oral challenge resulted in one of six 
sheep developing the disease. Brain and spleen were recovered from the 
orally infected sheep and from one of the intracerebrally injected 
sheep. Goldmann, et al. (Ref. 64), confirmed that both sheep had the 
same PrP genotype. In 1996, Foster, et al. (Ref. 65) reported the 
results of injecting homogenized tissue harvested from these infected 
animals into a panel of mice. Transmission from the brains and spleen 
of both sheep gave incubation periods and pathology in mice similar to 
those seen in direct BSE transmissions from cattle to mice. Foster's 
work supports the position that BSE can cross species barriers by the 
oral route and that, when judged by the mouse bioassay, the disease 
manifested in sheep retains the incubation time and pathology 
characteristic of BSE rather than scrapie. However, the manifestation 
of BSE in the sheep is histopathologically and clinically 
indistinguishable from natural scrapie.
    Information regarding the interaction of the TSE agents and the 
environment is limited. In 1964, Gordon reported the transmission of 
scrapie among bands of unrelated sheep on pasture. The mode of 
transmission was unknown (Ref. 66). In an effort to eradicate scrapie 
from Iceland a large area was depopulated of sheep and restocked with 
new sheep following a period of 3 years. Despite this effort, a few 
flocks of the new sheep developed scrapie; the origin was believed to 
be from scrapie that survived in the environment and not from 
reintroduction of the agent with the new sheep or through contaminated 
hay remaining on farms. However, a 1996 report suggests that six 
species of hay mites may be potential vectors associated with 
transmission of TSE's in Iceland (Ref. 67).
8. Genetics
    There is a genetic component associated with several of the human 
TSE diseases. A specific point mutation at codon 178 is associated with 
fatal familial insomnia (Ref. 68). Point mutations at codons 102, 105, 
117, 145, 198, and 217 are associated with GSS syndrome (Ref. 69). 
Point mutations at codons 178, 180, 200, 210, and 232 are associated 
with CJD (Refs. 68 and 70). Various insertions into the octapeptide 
repeat region of the PrP gene have also been associated with human 
TSE's (Ref. 71). It appears that the methionine/valine polymorphism at 
codon 129 may modify the phenotype and the transmission rate from GSS 
syndrome patients to mice (Ref. 72). No abnormalities in the sequence 
of the PrP gene in kuru patients were found.
    There is also a genetic component associated with sheep scrapie. 
Point mutations at codon 171 of the sheep PrP gene are linked to the 
disease in the Corriedale, Lacaune, Romanov, Suffolk, and Texel breeds 
(Refs. 73 to 76).
    An analysis of 370 cattle from Scotland revealed no difference 
between healthy cattle and cattle with BSE in the number of octapeptide 
repeat sequences (either five or six) and in a silent HindII 
restriction site polymorphism on the PrP gene (Ref. 77). No data were 
found that compared the sequence of the PrP gene of healthy deer, elk, 
mink, and goats with those afflicted by TSE's.
9. Diagnostics
    Because of the long incubation period, the ability to diagnose the 
presence of a BSE infection prior to the onset of the

[[Page 560]]

clinical disease would enhance the efficacy of surveillance and 
prevention programs. Because there is no fully characterized immune 
response to BSE or scrapie, diagnosis in live animals has been thought 
to be possible only when clinical signs are evident and must be 
confirmed by histopathology at post mortem (Ref. 10), or brain biopsy 
of moribund patients. Recently published research suggests antemortem 
tests for the TSE agent may be possible.
    The observation of histopathological changes in the brain, such as 
vacuolization of the brainstem in BSE are positive indicators of 
disease (Ref. 78). Other available diagnostic tests are 
immunohistochemical staining and immunoblotting of the abnormal protein 
(Ref. 10). Detection and titration of the TSE agent can also be 
accomplished by intracerebral inoculation in mice or hamsters with a 
brain homogenate from a suspected animal. After an appropriate 
incubation period, the brain of the laboratory animal is examined for 
histopathological changes characteristic of TSE (Ref. 8).
    The potential antemortem tests that have been published are 
described as follows: (1) Tests specific for PrP: (a) A capillary 
electrophoresis test (Ref. 79), and (b) a western blot test with 
increased sensitivity (Ref. 80); and (2) tests which identify 
metabolites of infected animals or humans: (a) A cyclic voltametric 
method which describes metabolites in urine (Ref. 81), and (b) an 
immunoblot test describing metabolites in cerebral spinal fluid (Ref. 
82). Antemortem tests have not yet been validated for practical use.
    Recent research has shown some promise for antemortem testing. 
Research by Shreuder et al. (Ref. 83), detected scrapie-associated 
PrPsc protein in tonsils from scrapie susceptible sheep about a year 
before the expected onset of the clinical disease. The research holds 
promise for preclinical detection in sheep, but needs further 
development. With regard to cattle, the researchers concluded that the 
technique may not work but is worth investigating. Research by Hsich et 
al. (Ref. 84), describes an experimental assay in humans and animals. 
The research found that a positive immunoassay in human dementia 
patients supports a diagnosis of CJD. The authors concluded that the 
assay may be helpful in premortem diagnosis of TSE in humans and 
animals showing clinical signs associated with TSE's. The validity of 
the test as a preclinical screen has not been established.
10. Inactivation
    The agency considered requiring procedures for the manufacture of 
animal-derived proteins that would inactivate TSE infectivity. There 
have been several studies on the inactivation of TSE agents. The only 
broad generalization that can be drawn is that agents that denature 
protein can diminish the infectivity of the TSE agents. TSE infectivity 
does not appear to be markedly diminished by radiation or UV-light.
    Recent research (Ref. 85) showed that 11 of the 15 rendering 
procedures tested produced meat and bone meal with no detectable BSE 
infectivity in a mouse bioassay. Only limited conclusions can be drawn 
about safety from these 11 procedures because the infectivity titer of 
the spiked starting material (which consisted of 10 percent brain) was 
several logs lower than that typically found in brain that is not 
minced and not stored at -20  deg.C. Also, the question of the adequacy 
of the mouse bioassay as the regulatory test which acceptably assures 
the absence of TSE infectivity to animals or man remains to be answered 
through future research investigations.
    The four procedures that failed included two protocols using 
continuous vacuum rendering of high fat material and two protocols 
using continuous atmospheric rendering of natural fat material. The 
continuous vacuum rendering processes that failed were 120  deg.C for 
20 minutes at a vacuum of 0.38 bar and 121  deg.C for 57 minutes at a 
vacuum of 0.4 bar. The continuous atmospheric rendering processes of 
natural fat material that failed were end temperatures of 112 and 122 
deg.C after 50 minutes; however, end temperatures of 123 and 139  deg.C 
after 125 minutes both inactivated the BSE agent. Unexpectedly, the BSE 
agent was inactivated by three wet rendering processes that only 
reached a maximum temperature of 119  deg.C with a cooking time of 240 
minutes, a maximum temperature of 101  deg.C with a cooking time of 120 
minutes, and a maximum temperature of 72  deg.C with a cooking time of 
240 minutes under a vacuum of 0.85 bar.
    Preliminary, unpublished results indicate that the only rendering 
process which completely inactivates the scrapie agent (which was 
spiked with higher infectivity than that in the BSE experiments 
described in this section) is batch rendering under pressure (Ref. 86). 
The agency encourages more research in this area.

B. The Association Between Scrapie and BSE

    Epidemiological studies of the outbreak of BSE in the United 
Kingdom, including a computer simulation of the BSE epidemic, have 
characterized it as an extended common-source epidemic. Each case has 
been considered a primary case resulting from exposure to a single 
common source of infection. It is believed in the United Kingdom that 
rendered feed ingredients contaminated with scrapie infected sheep, or 
cattle with a previously unidentified TSE, served as the common source 
of infection. One study demonstrated that meat and bone meal could be 
incorporated into cattle feed in sufficient quantity to transmit BSE to 
some of the animals that consumed the feed (Ref. 87). Thus far, other 
research including research by USDA has not confirmed that the feeding 
of U.S.-origin scrapie-infected feed ingredients to cattle produces 
BSE. Therefore, the theory that BSE evolved naturally in cattle has not 
been ruled out (Ref. 88). See also the discussion in II.A.5. of this 
document.
    Furthermore, the U.K. studies suggest that the spread of BSE 
appeared to have been exacerbated by the practice of feeding 
ingredients from rendered BSE-infected cattle to cattle, including 
young calves, a practice that was subsequently banned. Incomplete 
immediate compliance with the feeding ban may account for the fact that 
some cattle born after the ban continue to be infected with BSE and has 
complicated any theory of vertical transmission of the disease. The 
research findings of maternal transmission of BSE are inconclusive, but 
if it occurs, it does so at a rate insufficient to maintain the 
epidemic (Ref. 89).

C. The Association Between Animal TSE's and Human TSE's

    All the animal and human TSE's have been shown to be transmissible 
experimentally to laboratory animals. The human and animal diseases are 
pathologically similar and share some etiological similarities. TSE's 
are not officially considered zoonotic diseases, i.e., known to be 
naturally transmissible from animals to humans. The distribution of CJD 
in the world does not coincide with that of scrapie in sheep or of BSE 
in cattle. Human exposure to sheep or cattle has a low correlation with 
CJD. However, the recent report from the United Kingdom of nv-CJD, and 
its possible relationship to BSE, is causing scientists around the 
world including those at CDC to

[[Page 561]]

reevaluate whether BSE may be a zoonotic disease.
    This concern is further supported by the recent report of 
experimental BSE transmission to macaques, with the development of nv-
CJD-like plaques in these monkeys (see the following discussion in this 
section).
    The possibility of transmission of TSE's from animals to humans has 
been suggested, most recently in connection with the identification of 
nv-CJD in the United Kingdom. Scientists in the United Kingdom 
concluded that the nv-CJD cases may be unique to the United Kingdom, 
raising the possibility that they are causally linked to BSE. The 
scientists stated that ``the common neuropathological picture may 
indicate infection by a common strain of the causative agent, as in 
sheep scrapie in which strains of the disease have been identified * * 
* '' (Ref. 30). The United Kingdom Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory 
Committee (SEAC) stated that ``although there is no direct evidence of 
a link, on current data and in absence of any credible alternative the 
most likely explanation at present is that these cases are linked to 
exposure to BSE before introduction of the SBO [specified bovine offal] 
ban in 1989'' (Ref. 90). A WHO consultation in April 1996 concluded 
that ``a link has not yet been proven between v-CJD in the U.K. and the 
effect of exposure to the BSE agent. The most likely hypothesis for v-
CJD is the exposure of the United Kingdom population to BSE'' (Ref. 2). 
However, a second WHO consultation, in May 1996 concluded that ``the 
clinical and neuropathological features of the newly recognized CJD 
variant do not provide information which could be used to prove the 
possible link between this disease and BSE in cattle'' (Ref. 91).
    The recent finding of florid amyloid plaques in the brains of 
macaques inoculated with suspensions of BSE-infected cow brains 
increases suspicion that exposure to the BSE agent may be the source of 
nv-CJD. Amyloid plaques have never before been seen in monkeys with 
TSE's, and the florid plaques resembled those in nv-CJD patients (Ref. 
92). In a recent paper by Collinge, et al. (Ref. 93), it is stated that 
``strains of transmissible encephalopathies are distinguished by 
differing physicochemical properties of PrPsc, the disease-related 
isoform of prion protein, which can be maintained on transmission to 
transgenic mice. 'New variant' CJD has a strain characteristic distinct 
from other types of CJD and which resembles those of BSE transmitted to 
mice, domestic cat and macaque, and is consistent with BSE being the 
source of this new disease. Strain characteristics revealed here 
suggest that the prion protein may itself encode disease phenotypes.''
    The possible association between BSE and nv-CJD may be further 
clarified by results from studies that are under way (e.g., 
experimental inoculation of brain tissue from the nv-CJD patients into 
mice).

D. Infectivity of Specific Tissues

    The WHO in a recent publication has summarized the infectivity of 
various tissues from sheep, goat, and cattle (Ref. 94). Scientific 
studies are currently being conducted in which calves are fed 
homogenized brain tissue from United Kingdom cattle confirmed to have 
BSE, and then various tissues are collected from the calves at 4-month 
intervals (Refs. 56 and 95). The tissues from these calves are being 
analyzed for the presence of the BSE agent. The study has been in 
progress for 18 months and only brain, spinal cord, and retina have 
been shown to be highly infectious. Distal ileum has been shown to be 
infectious, but much less than the previously mentioned tissues. No 
other tissues, most notably, muscle meat, milk, or blood have been 
shown to be infectious. The results of these current experiments 
parallel the previous research as summarized by WHO. However, the 
agency notes that infectivity of other tissues that might be fed to 
ruminants has not been definitively determined. This is, in part, 
because of the lack of desired sensitivity in the available assay 
methods.
    In summary, meat, milk, milk products, and blood have not been 
shown to transmit BSE infectivity. These products are considered safe 
for human consumption by health authorities including the WHO.

E. Potential Risk of TSE's to the United States

1. Overview
    This proposed FDA action is designed to reduce the risk of a BSE 
epidemic in the United States and thereby protect the health of animals 
and possibly of people if there is, in fact, a zoonotic relationship 
between BSE and CJD. Risk is defined as the probability of an adverse 
effect to an individual or a population. The four steps that are 
typically involved in risk analysis are hazard identification, hazard 
exposure, dose response, and risk characterization.
    While BSE has not been found in the United States, the agency 
believes it presents a potential risk to the health of animals and 
people. There are incubational and symptomatic similarities (as well as 
several differences) among the TSE's. The scientific characterization 
of these diseases is incomplete. However, interspecies cross-infections 
have been scientifically demonstrated by parenteral injection and oral 
routes of exposure.
    The typically long incubation period and the potentially 
devastating effect that a BSE outbreak would have on animal health and 
U.S. agribusiness also supports a conservative regulatory approach 
aimed at prevention. While the current level of exposure to products 
derived from animals with a TSE is extremely low or absent, the 
potential consequences of such exposure and the apparent small intake 
of the agent needed to achieve infection in some animals further 
encourage a conservative regulatory policy.
    Dose response assessments will be difficult because of the lack of 
good exposure data and the possibility of different susceptibilities, 
e.g., age or genetic factors, in different subpopulations. Although the 
TSE's are generally transmissible to laboratory animals following 
intraperitoneal (ip) or intracerebral (ic) routes of administration, 
the limited data that are available following the oral route of 
administration suggests that this route is much less efficient than ip 
or ic. Currently, it is quite difficult to make an accurate dose 
response assessment for a TSE agent following oral administration.
    A number of actions, in addition to this proposed rule, have been 
taken to manage a reduction in risk that BSE will enter the United 
States cattle population. Restrictions have been placed on the 
importation of live cattle (July 1989) and ruminant products (e.g., 
meat and bone meal, bone meal, blood meal, offal, fat, and glands) from 
countries which have BSE. Live animals imported prior to the 
restrictions on imports have been regularly monitored by Animal and 
Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) veterinarians, and APHIS is 
currently in the process of purchasing the remaining live cattle for 
diagnostic research purposes. Histopathological examination of brain 
tissues has been carried out on more than 5,000 specimens from cattle 
that were disabled or that demonstrated neurological signs prior to 
slaughter or on the farm, e.g., nonambulatory or rabies-negative 
cattle. Histopathological and immunohistochemical examination of the 
nonambulatory or ``downer'' cows has been carried out since 1993. There 
has been no finding of BSE in tissues from these animals. These animals 
represent the highest BSE risk in the country, however, they also 
represent an extremely small percentage of the cattle

[[Page 562]]

slaughtered in the United States. This active surveillance program is 
continuing and may be expanded. The expansion of this program was 
indirectly supported by a comment to the ANPRM that all ``downer'' cows 
should be examined for BSE.
    Voluntary actions by industry have reduced the feeding of rendered 
sheep proteins to ruminants and the rendering of adult sheep. A 
voluntary Scrapie Flock Certification Program was implemented in 1992. 
The program, a cooperative effort among industry, State animal health 
officials and APHIS, seeks to reduce the prevalence of scrapie in U.S. 
sheep. A considerable educational effort continues to increase the 
awareness of veterinarians, veterinary laboratory diagnosticians, 
livestock and related industry businesses, and producers to the early 
clinical signs of BSE. Videos of United Kingdom BSE affected animals 
have been distributed to USDA veterinarians to enhance their ability to 
clinically diagnose BSE in suspect live animals. CDC has recently 
published an update (Ref. 96) of its previous review of national CJD 
mortality and the results of active CJD surveillance in five sites in 
the United States. These reviews did not detect evidence of the 
occurrence of the newly described variant form of CJD in the United 
States. As an important complement to these other public health 
efforts, this proposed rule would declare that animal protein derived 
from ruminant and mink tissues is an unapproved food additive for use 
in ruminant feeds, and would establish enforcement procedures. These 
actions, individually and collectively, contribute to a greatly reduced 
risk of a BSE epidemic ever occurring in the United States.
2. Comparison With the U.K. Conditions
    Investigators have identified several major risk factors that 
apparently contributed to the emergence of the disease and the 
resultant epidemic in the United Kingdom. These are: (1) A large sheep 
population relative to the cattle population, (2) a large, 
uncontrolled, scrapie incidence rate, (3) the production of 
``greaves,'' an incompletely processed intermediate product in the 
rendering process, (4) changes in rendering processes, such as the 
reduced use of solvent extraction, and (5) the feeding of significant 
amounts, up to 4 percent of the diet, of meat and bone meal to young 
dairy calves.
    In addition to the risk factors described in section II.E.2. of 
this document, the practice of processing dead sheep and cattle in the 
United Kingdom likely contributed to the amplification of the TSE 
agent. In the United Kingdom, sheep which may have died of scrapie and 
cattle with BSE, were picked up by ``knackers'' for rendering into 
animal feed. This material was partially rendered into ``greaves,'' 
which might have contained large amounts of the scrapie/BSE agent, and 
was fed to dairy calves in large amounts. The spread of BSE appeared to 
be facilitated by the feeding of rendered BSE-infected cattle back to 
calves. The BSE agent is postulated to have recycled from cows to 
calves through ruminant-to-ruminant feeding until the practice ceased 
following the 1989 ban on the practice.
    In the United States, the cattle population is much larger than the 
sheep population, the incidence of scrapie is much lower and a scrapie 
control program is in place; renderers in the United States do not 
manufacture greaves; and the rendering processes used in the United 
States are thought to reduce the titre (level) of TSE agents if any. 
The lack of a practice of feeding large amounts of meat and bone meal 
to calves in the United States, and the comparatively younger average 
age of U.S. dairy cattle are also differences that are believed to be 
important in protecting the United States against a U.K.-type BSE 
epidemic. Nevertheless, scrapie does exist in the United States, sheep 
are rendered and included in ruminant feed, the rendering process does 
not totally inactivate TSE agents, and calves are fed meat and bone 
meal. Therefore the risk of a BSE epidemic in the United States, while 
much less, cannot be completely discounted.

F. Historical Efforts to Control TSE's

1. U.S. Actions
    a. FDA. FDA is the Federal agency responsible for the safety and 
effectiveness of a large number of products and commodities. Briefly, 
these include, drugs for use in people and animals, human biological 
products, medical devices, food, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and 
animal feeds. Each of these product groups provides the potential for 
the transmission of spongiform encephalopathies in man or animals. FDA 
formed a Working Group composed of the Deputy Commissioner for 
Operations and representatives from the Centers to consider TSE's in 
relation to FDA regulated products. As a result of the Working Group's 
deliberations, FDA has taken the following actions:
   --- In 1992, letters were sent to manufacturers of dietary 
supplements asking those manufacturers to reformulate their products to 
be certain they do not contain materials from BSE or scrapie infected 
animals;
   --- In 1993, letters were sent to manufacturers of drugs, 
biologics, and devices asking them not to use bovine-derived materials 
from countries with BSE; and
   --- In 1996, letters were sent to manufacturers of drugs, 
biologics, devices, and animal feeds noting a possible relationship 
between BSE and nv-CJD and asking that they not use materials from BSE 
countries.
    In 1992, FDA conducted a survey of major sheep rendering plants to 
determine compliance with a 1989 voluntary industry ban on the use of 
adult sheep offal in ruminant feeds. The voluntary ban and results of 
the survey are described in section I.F.3. of this document. In the 
Federal Register of August 29, 1994 (59 FR 44584), FDA published a 
proposed rule proposing to declare that specified offal from adult 
sheep and goats is an unapproved feed additive in ruminant feed 
(hereinafter referred to as the August 1994 proposed rule). In the 
Federal Register of May 14, 1996, FDA published an ANPRM stating that 
FDA was considering whether to provide that the use of protein derived 
from ruminants in ruminant feed be prohibited.
    An international symposium entitled ``Tissue Distribution, 
Inactivation, and Transmission of Transmissible Spongiform 
Encephalopathies'' and cohosted by APHIS and FDA's Center for 
Veterinary Medicine (CVM) was held on May 13 and 14, 1996, in 
Riverdale, MD. The symposium participants engaged in discussion of 
findings from unpublished, recently completed, and in-progress 
scientific investigations on TSE's, and optimal approaches to managing 
any risk of TSE's to animal health.
    b. USDA. USDA policy has been both proactive and preventive. The 
Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) and APHIS have been active in 
taking measures in surveillance, prevention, and education about TSE's. 
In 1990, APHIS created a BSE Issues Management Team to analyze risks of 
BSE to the United States, disseminate accurate information about the 
disease, and act as a reference source for responding to questions 
about BSE. APHIS has also collaborated in the education of veterinary 
practitioners, veterinary laboratory diagnosticians, industry and 
producers on the clinical signs and pathology of BSE.
    APHIS has increased its surveillance efforts to verify that the 
United States is free of BSE and to detect the disease should it be 
introduced into the United

[[Page 563]]

States. As part of an ongoing active surveillance program, more than 60 
veterinary diagnostic laboratories across the United States, and the 
National Veterinary Service Laboratories (NVSL) of APHIS, continue to 
examine bovine brains from the following sources: (1) APHIS 
investigations in the United States where suspected encephalitic 
conditions in cattle are reported under the foreign animal disease 
investigation program; (2) CDC and State public health laboratories 
(specimens from bovine that were found negative for rabies); and (3) 
FSIS (specimens from ``downer'' cows or those exhibiting CNS 
abnormalities). More than 5,000 bovine brains have been examined, and 
none of these specimens contained lesions with the characteristics and 
distribution typical for BSE (Refs. 12 and 97). APHIS is currently in 
the process of purchasing the 69 living cattle (from a total of 496 
cattle) imported from the United Kingdom between 1981 and 1989. In July 
1989, the importation of live ruminants and ruminant products from all 
countries known to have BSE in native animals was banned.
    USDA continues to analyze and report epidemiologic findings and 
potential risks to the United States. In 1991, USDA issued two reports 
analyzing risk factors associated with BSE in the United Kingdom based 
on the British hypothesis of the disease occurring as a result of 
feeding scrapie-contaminated meat and bone meal (Refs. 98 and 84). 
Because of some similarities in the animal industries between the two 
countries, the possibility of BSE occurring in the United States could 
not be eliminated. However, the probability of occurrence was 
determined to be very low as the amount of sheep offal was found to be 
0.6 percent of all U.S. rendered product compared to the estimate of 14 
percent of all U.K. rendered product. Furthermore, the incidence of 
scrapie in the United States is much lower than in Great Britain; a 
scrapie eradication or control program has been in effect in the United 
States and rendered products are not routinely incorporated into calf 
diets as was the practice in the United Kingdom.
    Since 1991, USDA has closely followed scientific findings and has 
updated the BSE risk factor analysis, first in 1993 (Ref. 99) and as 
recently as February 1996 (Ref. 4). Changes within each of the risk 
factors have been evaluated, and because there has either been no 
change or a decrease in the magnitude of risk factors, the overall risk 
of BSE in the United States is believed to have decreased. The 
February, 1996 report estimated the maximum potential 1-year period 
prevalence of BSE to range from 2.3 to 12 cases per 1 million adult 
cattle. In other words, under the worst case scenario between 
approximately 115 and 600 adult cattle would become infected with BSE 
each year, in a U.S. population of nearly 50 million adult cattle.
    APHIS has had a scrapie control program in effect since 1952. 
Flocks that have been enrolled in the voluntary certification program 
for sheep for 5 years, and have not had a diagnosed case of scrapie 
within 5 years or a case traced back to the flock during that period, 
may apply for APHIS certification and be officially identified as such. 
This new control effort provides a mechanism to recognize flocks as 
scrapie-free in the absence of a live animal diagnostic test.
    There is no official USDA program on TME or CWD. Although the last 
TME case detected in the United States was in 1985, monitoring for this 
disease continues. APHIS cooperates with State wildlife and diagnostic 
officials in Colorado and Wyoming in the limited areas where CWD has 
been reported.
    In December 1991, APHIS placed a ban on importation of certain 
products of ruminant origin from countries known to have BSE (56 FR 
63865, December 6, 1991). These products include: Meat and bone meal, 
bone meal, blood meal, offal, fat, and glands. In addition to 
prohibiting the materials listed previously, the regulation requires 
that imported meat for human or animal consumption from bovines be 
deboned, with visible lymphatic and nervous tissue removed; that it be 
obtained from animals which have undergone a veterinary examination 
prior to slaughter; and that it be obtained from ruminants which have 
not been in any country in which BSE has been reported during a period 
of time when that country permitted the use of ruminant protein in 
ruminant feed. APHIS may allow the importation of the banned products 
under a special permit for scientific or research purposes, or under 
special conditions to be used in cosmetics. No bovine meat from the 
United Kingdom has been allowed to be imported into the United States 
by FSIS for human consumption since before the BSE epidemic occurred in 
the United Kingdom. The network of private veterinary practitioners 
that refers unusual cases to veterinary schools or State diagnostic 
laboratories around the United States provides an extensive 
surveillance system. FSIS performs both antemortem and post mortem 
inspections at all federally-inspected slaughter establishments, and 
inspectors condemn all animals with central nervous system disorders. 
State-inspected slaughter operations follow the same procedures.
    USDA also maintains a database on these and other conditions. The 
Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory Reporting System (VDLRS) is a database 
of selected disease conditions submitted by 29 State and university 
veterinary diagnostic laboratories throughout the United States, and 
includes the results of histologic examinations for BSE. The VDLRS is a 
cooperative effort of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory 
Diagnosticians (AAVLD), the U.S. Animal Health Association (USAHA), 
APHIS' Veterinary Service Centers for Epidemiology and Animal Health, 
and the 29 laboratories mentioned previously.
    c. Public Health Service (PHS). i. CDC. CDC conducts surveillance 
for CJD through examination of death certificate data compiled by the 
National Center for Health Statistics, CDC, for U.S. residents for whom 
CJD was listed as one of the multiple causes of death (Ref. 100). These 
data indicate that the annual CJD mortality rates in the United States 
between 1979 and 1993 have been relatively stable, ranging between only 
0.8 case per million in both 1979 and 1990 and 1.1 cases per million in 
1987. In addition, CJD deaths in persons younger than 30 years of age 
in the United States remain extremely rare (&#60;5 cases per billion per 
year) (Ref. 101).
    CDC is working with the Council of State and Territorial 
Epidemiologists to consider expansion of current CJD surveillance. CDC 
is also working with its four established Emerging Infections Programs 
(Minnesota, Oregon, Connecticut, and the San Francisco Bay area, 
California), the Georgia Department of Human Resources, and the Atlanta 
Metropolitan Active Surveillance Program to pilot enhanced surveillance 
efforts for CJD (Ref. 101). This effort includes an active search for 
v-CJD as described in the United Kingdom (Ref. 30). On August 9, 1996, 
the results of this enhanced CJD surveillance effort was published; no 
evidence of the occurrence of the newly described variant form of CJD 
was found in the United States. No evidence of v-CJD has been found in 
the United States.
    ii. National Institutes of Health (NIH). A project of the 
Laboratory of Central Nervous System Studies of the National Institute 
of Neurological Diseases and Stroke is conducting investigations on 
slow, latent, and temperate viral infections associated with chronic 
degenerative neurological diseases. Important areas of study are the 
pathogenesis of slow infections and mechanisms of persistence in kuru 
and

[[Page 564]]

CJD. Also intensive molecular, biological, genetic, and immunological 
studies are being conducted on amyloid formation in the brain in 
Alzheimer's disease, normal aging, Down's syndrome, and slow viral 
infections, and the elucidation of the de novo generation of infectious 
amyloid proteins from normal host precursor proteins in kuru, CJD, GSS 
syndrome, scrapie and BSE. Research on TSE's has also been conducted by 
the NIH Laboratory of Persistent Viral Disease. FDA maintains close 
contact with scientists in the laboratories and expects to use their 
expertise in the evaluation of inactivation methods and transmission 
studies.
    iii. Other actions. On April 8, 1996, an interagency meeting at CDC 
including representatives from CDC, NIH, FDA, USDA, and the U.S. 
Department of Defense was held to disseminate conclusions from the WHO 
consultation regarding v-CJD and to coordinate preventive activities 
among these agencies to address the BSE and CJD issues.
2. International Actions
    a. United Kingdom. Regulatory controls taken to manage the BSE 
epidemic in the United Kingdom and to address public health concerns 
include: (1) An action in June 1988 to make the disease reportable; (2) 
a ban in July 1988 on the feeding of ruminant-derived protein 
supplements to other ruminants; (3) an order in August 1988 for the 
compulsory slaughter and incineration of BSE suspect cattle; (4) a ban 
in November 1989 on the inclusion of specified bovine offal (brain, 
spinal cord, thymus, spleen, tonsils, and intestines) for human 
consumption; and (5) a ban in September 1990 on use of specified bovine 
offal in any animal feed.
    A CJD Surveillance Unit was established to monitor CJD numbers in 
the United Kingdom. SEAC, consisting of experts in neurology, 
epidemiology, and microbiology from outside the British government, was 
established in 1990 to oversee all aspects of TSE's and human and 
animal health. USDA has a representative on this committee.
    Major regulatory actions occurring after the SEAC report on nv-CJD 
(Ref. 90) include legislation to ban the feeding of mammalian meat and 
bone meal to any farmed animal, and legislation to ban the use of 
cattle head meat for human consumption.
    b. WHO. WHO has held meetings on the spongiform encephalopathies in 
1991, 1993, 1995, and 1996, and a meeting in collaboration with the 
Office International des Epizooties (OIE) in 1994. The general purposes 
of these meetings were to review the existing state of knowledge on 
spongiform encephalopathies including BSE, to evaluate possible means 
of transmission, and to identify risk factors for infection. A specific 
purpose was to review the possible human public health implications of 
animal spongiform encephalopathies, with special emphasis on BSE. The 
group of international experts convened in April 1996 by WHO 
recommended that all countries should ban the use of ruminant tissues 
in ruminant feed. The WHO group also declared that milk and milk 
products, including such products from the United Kingdom, are safe for 
human consumption and that gelatin in the food chain is considered safe 
because its preparation effectively destroys BSE. Finally, the group 
concluded that tallow could be safe if effective rendering procedures 
are in place (i.e., rendered as protein-free) (Ref. 2).
    c. OIE. OIE has supported the U.K. ban on the use of specified 
offals and has recommended that the same action be taken in other 
countries with a high incidence of the disease (Ref. 102). OIE has held 
meetings in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1995, and 1996, and has developed 
guidelines concerning animals and animal products to prevent movement 
to unaffected countries.
    d. European Community (EC). The EC has held a series of meetings 
related to BSE. Following issuance of the U.K. SEAC statement 
suggesting a possible link between nv-CJD and BSE, the EC imposed a ban 
on British cattle, beef and bovine derivatives (Ref. 103).
3. Voluntary Measures by the U.S. Animal Industries
    a. Voluntary ban on rendering adult sheep. In 1989, the National 
Renderers Association (NRA) and the Animal Protein Producers Industry 
(APPI) recommended to their members that they stop rendering adult 
sheep or providing sheep offal for sale as meat and bone meal for 
inclusion in cattle feed (Ref. 104). Following the recommendation of 
the voluntary ban, FDA carried out a survey of current practices in the 
United States for rendering or otherwise disposing of adult sheep 
carcasses and parts, specifically head, brain, and spinal cord. Limited 
inspections of rendering plants were conducted in 1992 to: (1) Assess 
compliance by U.S. renderers with the voluntary ban; (2) identify 
rendering plant practices concerning adult sheep; and (3) determine if 
rendered adult sheep protein byproducts were being sold or labeled for 
use as feed or feed components for cattle. Of the 19 plants surveyed, 
15 rendered carcasses or offal of adult sheep. These 15 plants 
processed more than 85 percent of the adult sheep rendered in the 
United States. Eleven of the 15 plants rendered carcasses of adult 
sheep with heads, 7 of the 15 rendered sheep carcasses separately from 
other species, 6 of the 15 maintained meat and bone meal from adult 
sheep separate from meat and bone meal from other species, and 4 of the 
15 rendered sheep that had died of causes other than slaughter. Six of 
the 11 renderers processing adult sheep with heads had sold meat and 
bone meal to manufacturers of cattle feed. Thus, the rendering 
industry's voluntary ban on the rendering of adult sheep or providing 
sheep offal for use in cattle feed was not fully implemented at the 
time of the survey (Ref. 105).
    b. Voluntary ban on feeding ruminant proteins to ruminants. On 
March 29, 1996, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA), the 
National Milk Producers Federation, the American Sheep Association, the 
American Veterinary Medical Association, the American Association of 
Veterinary Medical Colleges, and the American Association of Bovine 
Practitioners announced the recommendation of a voluntary ban on the 
feeding of ruminant-derived proteins to ruminant animals (Ref. 106). 
USDA, PHS, the American Society of Animal Science, and other 
organizations announced support for the voluntary ban (Refs. 107 and 
108). According to the NCBA (Ref. 109), a comprehensive communication 
strategy, seeking removal of ruminant-derived proteins from the rations 
of ruminants, was implemented in May 1996 by the feed industry, 
nutritionists, veterinarians, extension specialists, and dairy and beef 
producers. NCBA has not conducted a survey to assess the impact of its 
communication strategy; however, NCBA did point out that past requests 
for voluntary action by the cattle industry have been quite successful, 
approaching 90 percent compliance. In contrast, an anonymous comment to 
the ANPRM suggested a compliance level of less than 5 percent (Ref. 
110). FDA has not conducted a survey to ascertain the level of 
compliance with the voluntary ban.

G. Processing Animal Tissues for Feed Ingredients

1. Current Rendering Practices
    The following discussion on current rendering practices comes 
directly from comments supplied to FDA in response to the ANPRM from 
representatives of

[[Page 565]]

APPI and NRA. Knowledge about the four basic types of rendering systems 
that are most commonly used in the United States today may be crucial 
in dealing with the TSE issue in this country. Data on the inactivation 
of the BSE and scrapie agents following simulation of the most commonly 
used basic types of rendering systems in the United States could be 
quite useful, especially because some of these systems do not appear to 
have been used in the only published rendering study on BSE 
inactivation (Ref. 85).
    Rendering, the process of cooking raw material to remove the 
moisture and fat from the solid protein portion of animal tissues, has 
been practiced by humans for more than 2,000 years. The United States 
rendering industry has developed over the last 160 years. Modern 
rendering systems are high-technology recycling processes that 
efficiently convert animal byproducts (shop fat and bone, beef and pork 
slaughterhouse materials, poultry offal, fish, etc.) to stable protein 
and fat supplements for feed.
    Current technology consists of four basic types of rendering 
systems--batch cooker, continuous cooker, continuous multi-stage 
evaporator, and continuous preheat/press/evaporator. All systems 
consist of three basic steps: Grinding the raw material, cooking it to 
remove moisture, and separating the melted fat from the protein solids.
    Batch cookers are multiple units, each consisting of a horizontal, 
steam-jacketed cylindrical vessel with an agitator. Batch cookers are 
operated at atmospheric pressure. The cooked material is discharged to 
the percolator drain pan, which contains a perforated screen that 
allows the free-run fat to drain and be separated from the protein 
solids known as ``tankage.''
    Because ``tankage'' contains considerable fat, it is processed 
through a screw press to complete the separation of fat from solids. 
The fat discharged from the screw press usually contains fine solid 
particles that are removed by either centrifuging or filtration. The 
protein solids discharged from the screw press are known as 
``cracklings,'' which normally are screened and ground with a hammer 
mill to produce protein meal.
    The continuous cooker rendering system normally consists of a 
single continuous cooker, operating at atmospheric pressure. The 
discharge from the continuous cooker usually passes across either a 
vibrating screen or stationary perforated screen to allow the free-run 
fat to drain. The subsequent steps in the continuous cooker rendering 
process are similar to those described before for the batch cooker.
    In the continuous multi-stage evaporator rendering system, crushing 
is used as the first stage of size reduction of the raw material. A fat 
recycle stream is then used to deliver the material as a pumpable 
slurry through the secondary grinding step to reduce further the 
particle size. Particle size and fat ratios are important components of 
this system. The slurry discharge from the final stage of evaporation 
is pumped to a centrifuge which removes most of the fat and part of it 
is recycled back to the second stage of size reduction. The solids 
discharged from the centrifuge are conveyed to screw presses which 
complete the separation of fat from the protein solids.
    The continuous preheat/press/evaporator rendering system is known 
by a variety of names including the Stord dewatering rendering system 
and the Atlas low temperature wet rendering system. In either case, raw 
material is ground in two stages and passes through the preheater to 
raise the temperature to 180 to 190  deg.EF before entry to the twin 
screw press. The press separates this material into two phases: A 
presscake of solids containing moisture and a low fat concentration, 
and a liquid containing mostly water (stickwater) with fine solids, 
soluble protein, insoluble protein and melted fat.
    The press liquid is processed either by passing through a 
multistage evaporator system to remove the water before centrifuging to 
remove the fine solids from the fat, or by passing through a centrifuge 
to separate the fat before multistage evaporation of the remaining 
water/fine solids fraction. The liquid separation system consisting of 
two stages of centrifuges completes the separation of the melted fat 
from the solids and water. In this system, the screw press normally 
used to process the ``tankage'' is no longer needed. Longer drying 
times are needed with this system as compared to previous systems 
because of the early fat removal (less fat means less effective heat 
transfer).
    The agency encourages further research into methods of deactivation 
of the BSE agent during the rendering process.
2. Assay Methodologies for Proteins
    Enforcement of the proposed regulation would be facilitated if a 
test to detect and distinguish ruminant from nonruminant materials in 
feeds or feed ingredients was available. However, practical assays that 
could be used to enforce the proposed regulation are not available at 
this time. The test procedure would need to exhibit a high degree of 
sensitivity and selectivity; that is, the test must be able to detect 
the analyte of interest to the exclusion of other components. A test 
for acceptable rendered products in animal feed must therefore be able 
to discriminate and differentiate between permitted and prohibited 
animal derived proteins. Other factors of importance are the ruggedness 
of the test method, speed, and simplicity of design.
    An enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) based analytic method 
that is both sensitive (detects low levels of analyte) and specific 
(detects primarily the analyte of interest) is one possibility. ELISA 
is a relatively straightforward methodology. There are numerous 
commercial sources for antisera capable of binding to bovine, ovine, 
porcine, and caprine proteins. Antisera have also been generated from 
muscle extracts and validated for use in USDA-approved ELISA methods to 
determine the identity of raw and cooked meats (Refs. 111 and 112). 
However, rendered products present a unique problem because rendering 
causes the destruction of most of the antibody binding epitopes needed 
for an ELISA test. Therefore, detection of rendered proteins by a given 
antibody cannot be automatically assumed.
    Other potential methodologies include western blot analysis, 
capillary electrophoresis, and high pressure liquid chromatography. The 
applicability of these three methods to this issue has not been 
addressed. Furthermore, they require expensive, specialized equipment 
and a high degree of technical competence.
    The agency encourages research to detect and distinguish ruminant 
from nonruminant materials in rendered products and animal feeds.

III. Statutory Provisions Regarding Food Additives

    The term ``food'' as defined in the act includes animal feed. 
Section 201(f) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(f)) defines food as ``articles 
used for food or drink for man or other animals'' and ``articles used 
for components of any such article.'' Furthermore, any substance whose 
intended use results or may reasonably be expected to result in its 
becoming a component of food is a food additive unless, among other 
things, it is GRAS or is the subject of a prior sanction. Section 
402(a)(2)(C) of the act (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)) deems food adulterated 
``if it is, or it bears or contains, any food additive which is unsafe 
within the meaning of section 409 * * *.'' Under section 409(a) of the 
act (21 U.S.C 348(a)), a food additive is unsafe unless

[[Page 566]]

a food additive regulation or an exemption is in effect with respect to 
its use or its intended use.
    A food additive regulation is established by the submission and 
approval of a food additive petition, as provided in 21 CFR 571.1, or 
on FDA's initiative as provided in 21 CFR 570.15. FDA on its own 
initiative or at the request of an interested party, also may propose 
to determine that a substance intended for use in animal feed is not 
GRAS and is a food additive subject to section 409 of the act as 
provided in Sec. 570.38 (21 CFR 570.38). Subsequent to the publication 
of such a proposal and after consideration of public comments, FDA may 
issue a final rule declaring the substance to be a food additive and 
require discontinuation of its use except when used in compliance with 
a food additive regulation.

A. GRAS Determination

    A determination that a substance added directly or indirectly to a 
food is GRAS, is generally based on specific information regarding the 
composition of the substance, its use, method of preparation, methods 
for detecting its presence in food, and information about its 
functionality in food (21 CFR 570.35) as determined by experts 
qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety 
of such a substance. A substance added to food becomes GRAS as the 
result of a common understanding about the substance throughout the 
scientific community familiar with safety of such substances. The basis 
of expert views may be either scientific procedures, or, in the case of 
a substance used in food prior to January 1, 1958, experience based on 
common use in food (Sec. 570.30(a)) (21 CFR 570.30(a)). General 
recognition of safety through experience based on common use in food 
prior to January 1, 1958, may be determined without the quantity or 
quality of scientific studies required for the approval of a food 
additive regulation. However, substances that are GRAS based on such 
use must be currently recognized as safe based on their pre-1958 use. 
(See United States v. Naremco, 553 F.2d 1138 (8th Cir. 1977); compare 
United States v. Western Serum, 666 F.2d 335 (9th Cir. 1982).) A 
recognition of safety through common use is ordinarily to be based on 
generally available data and information (Sec. 570.30(c)). An 
ingredient that was not in common use in food prior to January 1, 1958, 
may achieve general recognition of safety only through scientific 
procedures.
    General recognition of safety based upon scientific procedures 
requires the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as is 
required to obtain approval of a food additive regulation for the 
ingredient (Sec. 570.30(b)). (See United States v. Naremco, 553 F.2d at 
1143.) A substance is not GRAS if there is a genuine dispute among 
experts as to its recognition (An Article of Drug * * * Furestrol 
Vaginal Suppositories, 251 F. Supp. 1307 (N.D. Ga. 1968), aff'd 415 
F.2d 390 (5th Cir. 1969).) Further, general recognition of safety 
through scientific procedures must be based upon published studies 
(United States v. Articles of Food and Drug Colitrol 80 Medicated, 372 
F. Supp. 915 (N.D. Ga. 1974), aff'd, 518 F.2d 743, 747 (5th Cir. 
1975)), so that the results are generally available to experts. It is 
not enough, in attempting to establish that a substance is GRAS, to 
establish that there is an absence of scientific studies that 
demonstrate the substance to be unsafe; there must be studies that show 
the substance to be safe (United States v. An Article of Food * * * Co 
Co Rico, supra.)
    Conversely, a substance may be ineligible for GRAS status if 
studies show that the substance is, or may be, unsafe. This is true 
whether the studies are published or unpublished (50 FR 27294 at 27296, 
July 2, 1985). If there are studies that tend to support a finding that 
a particular substance is GRAS, but also studies that tend to support a 
contrary position, the conflict in the studies, just as a conflict in 
expert opinion, may prevent the general recognition of the safe use of 
the substance.

B. Prior Sanction

    Under section 201(s) of the act, the term ``food additive'' does 
not apply to any substance used in accordance with a sanction or 
approval granted prior to enactment of section 201(s) of the act and 
granted under the act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 
451 et seq.), or the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 et 
seq.). Section 570.38(d) provides that if the Commissioner of Food and 
Drugs is aware of any prior sanction for use of a substance, he will, 
concurrently with a notice determining that a substance is not GRAS and 
is a food additive subject to section 409 of the act, propose a 
separate regulation covering such use of the substance.
    In the case of the materials subject to this proposed rule, FDA has 
determined that it is unaware of any applicable prior sanction. Any 
person who intends to assert or rely on such sanction is required to 
submit proof of the existence of the applicable prior sanction. The 
failure of any person to come forward with proof of such an applicable 
prior sanction in response to this notice will constitute a waiver of 
the right to assert or rely on such sanction at any later time.

C. Food Additive Status of Ruminant Tissues

    The agency recognizes that processed ruminant byproducts have a 
long history of use in animal feeds without known adverse effects. 
However, the evidence as discussed in sections I and II.A. through 
II.D. of this document, for the development of a new pattern of disease 
transmission, now indicates that these ingredients can no longer be 
categorically regarded as safe. The agency tentatively concludes that, 
based on this evidence, use of such products in ruminant feed is not 
GRAS. The agency is proposing this regulation in light of the findings 
and conclusions described in sections I and II in this notice. Nor is 
the agency aware of a prior sanction for any feed products that contain 
these tissues. Therefore, FDA is proposing that the addition of protein 
derived from ruminant tissues to ruminant feed would constitute the use 
of an unapproved food additive because no regulation is in effect 
providing for such use. Any ruminant feed that contains protein derived 
from ruminant and mink tissues would be adulterated. Accordingly, FDA 
is proposing to list protein derived from ruminant tissues in part 589.

IV. Comments

    FDA's May 1996 ANPRM requested public comment and information on 
all aspects of TSE's, including BSE, and the potential consequences of 
a prohibition on the feeding of ruminant protein to ruminants. The 
agency received nearly 600 comments, including many that were submitted 
long after the comment period ended. The agency has attempted to 
address the comments in this proposal. If there are any significant 
concerns that the agency has not addressed, these concerns should be 
brought to the agency's attention in timely comments on this proposal. 
Comments that were specific to the topics covered by the other sections 
of this preamble were considered in the preamble as written. Comments 
are discussed in the text of some of these sections. The following is a 
general discussion of the comments received.
    Many comments, especially from renderers, meat packers, feed 
companies and farmers, opposed the prohibition of ruminant protein 
being fed to ruminants. The main reasons offered were the lack of 
evidence of BSE in the United States, lack of scientific data to 
support the proposal in the absence of

[[Page 567]]

BSE, environmental concerns, lack of an assay or other practical means 
to support enforcement, and the economic hardship that would fall upon 
the animal producers, slaughter facilities, renderers, feed 
manufacturers, and packers. Support for such a prohibition from 
consumer groups, pharmaceutical firms, scientists and veterinarians, 
and some livestock organizations, emphasized a potential effect on 
human health, the experience and data from the United Kingdom, and 
significant economic detriment if a BSE epidemic were to occur in this 
country. Other comments described a need to ensure that exported U.S. 
bovine-derived products met international standards and guidelines, and 
to maintain consumer confidence in the beef and dairy industries even 
though those comments acknowledged that there is a minimal potential 
risk of infectivity to animals and humans.
    The agency requested scientific information regarding the 
occurrence, transmission, etiology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, and 
inactivation of TSE agents. Many comments were received that contained 
useful scientific information that was considered in the preparation of 
this proposed rule, as described in this preamble and supporting 
documents.
    Three comments suggested that the documented existence of nonBSE 
TSE's, and the presence of ``downer'' cows (cows unable to walk) in the 
United States is evidence that BSE is present in this country. Three 
comments stated that the BSE surveillance in the United States provides 
sufficient assurance that BSE does not exist in this country. A number 
of persons commented on whether specific tissues, such as milk, blood, 
and gelatin, should be excluded from any prohibition, with nearly all 
supporting such exclusion.
    The agency requested information on the economic impact of the 
described action. Numerous comments provided data on volume of product 
impacted, potential economic benefits, and cost of compliance to 
affected persons. The data were used to develop the preliminary 
economic assessment supporting this proposed rule.
    The agency requested information on the environmental impact and 
potential mitigating factors of the described action. Many comments 
stated that alternative disposal of the prohibited carcasses would be 
less environmentally safe than rendering. These and other comments were 
considered in the development of the environmental assessment.
    Numerous comments were received regarding the need to prohibit only 
tissues that have been demonstrated to be infective. Generally, the 
comments stated that tissues that have been proven to be noninfective 
should be exempted. Although the agency is proposing a rule that would 
prohibit the use of all ruminant-derived protein in ruminant feeds, the 
agency will, as explained elsewhere in this document, consider a 
partial ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition as well as a mammalian-to-
ruminant prohibition.
    Many comments supported establishment of Hazard Analysis Critical 
Control Points (HACCP) for the rendering industry, often with 
concurrent support for current good manufacturing practices (CGMP's) 
for animal-derived proteins. For example, the American Feed Industry 
Association proposed a specific set of Good Manufacturing Practices for 
the producers of animal protein products, and the National Renderers 
Association proposed a specific HACCP regulation for rendering 
operations. The agency agrees that the need for HACCP, perhaps 
supported by CGMP's, for animal-derived proteins could be considered in 
future rulemaking. Several comments were received regarding labeling 
requirements for animal-derived proteins. The majority of the comments 
supported a statement of the origin of animal-derived protein. The 
agency has included a labeling requirement in the proposed rule.

V. Analysis of Alternatives

A. Overview

    In addition to the proposed ruminant-to-ruminant rule, the agency 
is considering alternative approaches. The alternatives include: (1) 
excluding from ruminant feed all ruminant and mink materials except 
those that have not been found to present a risk of transmitting 
spongiform encephalopathy (partial ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition); 
(2) prohibiting the use in ruminant feed of all mammalian protein 
(mammalian-to-ruminant prohibition); (3) prohibiting the feeding of 
materials from species in which TSE's have been diagnosed in the United 
States (sheep, goats, mink, deer, and elk); (4) prohibiting the feeding 
of specified sheep and goat offal, as proposed by the agency in 1994; 
(5) other alternatives that might be proposed by the comments; and (6) 
no action.
    Analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the options 
follows. Analysis of costs and benefits, including detailed economic 
analysis, also appears in section IX. of this document. Environmental 
consequences are discussed in section VIII. of this document.
    In determining the scope of the final rule, the agency will weigh 
carefully the comments received, along with material contained in the 
administrative record for this proposal and the comments submitted in 
response to the ANPRM. Comments regarding the scope of the rule, 
including those comments supporting other options other than the 
proposed option, should be addressed accordingly.

B. Ruminant-to-Ruminant Prohibition

    Advantages of this option, compared with the ``no action'' option, 
are discussed in detail in section I. of this document. The advantages 
of this option that are discussed in that section would apply if BSE 
were to occur in this country. As discussed in separate sections that 
follow, there would also be environmental and economic advantages to 
the ruminant-to-ruminant option, if BSE were to occur in this country. 
Disadvantages of the ruminant-to-ruminant option, compared to the ``no 
action'' option, would be relevant primarily if BSE did not occur in 
the United States. These disadvantages would include the time and 
expense required to comply with the provisions of the regulation, and 
the limited, short term environmental effects described in section 
VIII. of this document.
    Compared with the mammalian-to-ruminant option, the ruminant-to-
ruminant option has the advantages of being tailored more precisely to 
the identified scientific concerns, and less burdensome on the affected 
industries. Economic and environmental costs would be less. The major 
disadvantage is that the ruminant-to-ruminant option results in more 
complexity for the regulated industries, and thereby provides less 
assurance of compliance. This is explained further in the discussion of 
the mammalian-to-ruminant option, in section V.D. of this document.
    Compared to the other remaining options, which are less 
restrictive, the ruminant-to-ruminant option provides greater assurance 
of protection of the public health and, if BSE were to occur in the 
United States, lower economic and environmental costs. The 
disadvantages relate generally to the greater economic and 
environmental costs that would be incurred if BSE did not occur in the 
United States.

C. Partial Ruminant-to-Ruminant Prohibition

    As an alternative to the proposed ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition, 
the agency is considering a partial

[[Page 568]]

ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition which would exclude from ruminant feed 
all ruminant and mink materials except those that have not been found 
to present a risk of transmitting spongiform encephalopathy. The 
exclusions would be in addition to milk products, gelatin and bovine 
blood, which are excluded in the proposed rule. Possible exclusions 
include slaughter byproducts from bovine that have been inspected and 
passed in inspected slaughter facilities, except the brain, eyes, 
spinal cord, and distal ileum. The four named tissues would be 
prohibited because they have been shown through experimental trials and 
bioassays to transmit spongiform encephalopathy. The remaining tissues 
have not been demonstrated to transmit spongiform encephalopathy.
    This option has the advantage of having its prohibitions based 
primarily on scientific information related to infectivity of specific 
tissues. A number of persons who commented on the ANPRM urged the 
agency to base its regulation entirely on such scientific information. 
In addition, this option would likely involve lower lost sales revenues 
to the affected industries, and could have fewer adverse economic 
effects, than would the other options.
    However, the agency has three concerns with regard to the adequacy 
of this option in providing sufficient protection for the public 
health. First, FDA recognizes that it may be impractical in the 
slaughter and rendering processes to segregate and exclude the bovine 
tissues that have not been found to present a risk. For example, USDA 
has expressed reservations that separating the distal ileum from the 
other intestinal offal could jeopardize a slaughter plant's ability to 
meet pathogen reduction goals required under USDA's HACCP regulations. 
Furthermore, regulatory enforcement of a prohibition affecting only 
specified bovine tissues may be impractical in the absence of specific 
diagnostic methods for identifying protein derived from such tissues. 
If a partial prohibition were adopted, it would be based on a finding 
that practical methods can be implemented for segregating, processing, 
storing, and identifying feed materials derived from tissues that have 
not been found to present a risk.
    Second, this option would be inconsistent with actions taken in a 
number of other nations. For example, CDC has commented that any 
prohibition of lesser scope than a ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition 
would place the United States out of step with the international public 
health community.
    Third, limiting the prohibition of tissues to those that have been 
shown to be infective would not address the risk that may be presented 
by other tissues. Definitive assays using methods more sensitive than 
currently available methods might identify such additional tissues as 
infective. The possibility of undetected low dose exposure cannot be 
eliminated, particularly for tissues such as lymph nodes and spleens 
which would be expected to be infective (Ref. 1).
    These issues raise a substantial question as to whether the tissues 
could be GRAS. To achieve the highest level of public health 
protection, the agency believes that it may be reasonable to assume 
that, in the absence of scientific data definitively establishing that 
each tissue does not transmit spongiform encephalopathy, all ruminant 
tissues present a risk of infectivity.
    The agency nevertheless welcomes comments on this alternative to 
the proposed ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition and especially invites 
comments on possible practical means of separating the distal ileum in 
compliance with USDA and industry standards, as well as the 
practicality of the removal of brain, spinal cord, and eye and the 
segregation of these tissues from others in the slaughter plant.

D. Mammal-to-Ruminant Prohibition

    The agency received comments in support of a rule that would 
prohibit the use in ruminant feed of all mammalian-derived protein. For 
instance, the American Feed Industry Association, NRA, and APPI 
expressed concerns that segregating certain mammalian derived proteins 
from others would not be feasible because of regular commingling of 
protein products at feed mills and rendering facilities. A mammalian-
to-ruminant prohibition would provide greater assurance of industry 
compliance than either a partial or total ruminant-to-ruminant 
prohibition because practical analytical methods exist for 
distinguishing mammalian from nonmammalian proteins. Implementation of 
a mammal-to-ruminant prohibition by the regulated industries would be 
less complex, and would reduce the potential for contamination of 
cattle feeds with material intended for feeding monogastric animals. 
Contamination of cattle feeds with material intended for feeding 
nonruminants was the primary reason that the United Kingdom has 
prohibited mammalian proteins in the rations of cattle. A mammal-to-
ruminant prohibition would enable the continued use of Association of 
American Feed Control Officials definitions for the purpose of 
identifying and labeling products covered by the prohibition, and would 
not require additional or new labeling. Finally, concerns were 
expressed that allowing certain products containing meat and bone meal 
to be used in ruminant feeds while prohibiting others would lead to 
instability in financially sensitive commodity markets for animal 
protein.
    On the other hand, the agency is not aware of any scientific data 
that establish or suggest TSE infectivity in nonruminant mammals except 
in mink. Thus, excluding nonruminant tissues from ruminant feed would 
be based primarily on the view that the possibility of infection of 
nonruminant tissue through cross-contamination or commingling with 
ruminant tissue is sufficient to preclude GRAS status for the 
nonruminant tissue. However, FDA is aware that some portions of the 
affected industries would prefer to segregate ruminant from nonruminant 
tissues, and believe that such separation is practical. Accordingly, 
the agency invites comments on the relative merits and disadvantages of 
a mammal-to-ruminant prohibition compared with a total or partial 
ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition.

E. Prohibition of Materials From U.S. Species Diagnosed With TSE's 
(Sheep, Goats, Mink, Deer, and Elk)

    This option would involve requiring that ruminants not be fed any 
proteins derived from any U.S. animal species in which a TSE has been 
diagnosed. This includes sheep, goats, mink, deer, and elk. This 
approach would eliminate the scrapie agent, along with TME and CWD, 
from ruminant feed, and thereby reduce the risk of BSE in cattle caused 
by TSE transmission from other species. However, it would not prevent 
the spread of BSE among cattle if BSE occurred for some other reasons, 
e.g., by a spontaneous mutation in cattle or importation of animals 
with BSE, and the animals were processed and subsequently included in 
ruminant feed. As explained in section IX. of this document, this 
option involves lower economic costs than the three options previously 
described, in the absence of a BSE outbreak.

F. Sheep-Specified Offal Prohibition

    The option of prohibiting only protein from specified offal from 
sheep and goats for use in ruminant feed would eliminate the scrapie 
agent from bovine feed. However, it would not prevent the spread of BSE 
among cattle if BSE occurred for some other reason, e.g., by

[[Page 569]]

a spontaneous mutation in cattle or importation of animals with BSE, 
and the animals were processed and subsequently included in ruminant 
feed. The agency notes that if it were to select this option, it would 
reconsider its statement in the 1994 proposed rule that sheep less than 
12 months of age presented a minimal risk. Cases of scrapie in sheep as 
young as 7 months have been reported (Ref. 113). Although the risk 
presented by young animals may be minimal, excluding them may provide 
inadequate protection to the public health. As explained in section IX. 
of this document, this option involves lower economic costs than the 
options described previously, in the absence of a BSE outbreak.

G. No Action

    The advantages and disadvantages of this option, in relation to the 
other options, are discussed in detail in section I. of this document 
and in the preceding subsections of this section, as well as the 
environmental and economic sections. In general, this option offers 
lower economic and environmental costs if BSE does not occur in the 
United States, and higher such costs (in addition to public health 
implications) if BSE does occur.

VI. Description of the Proposed Rule

A. Introduction

1. Regulatory Alternatives
    Typically, FDA regulates products that are of public health concern 
through a combination of regulatory tools including: labeling for 
appropriate use; CGMP regulations and, recently, HACCP regulations; 
specifications for the product or its manufacture; and testing to 
determine the presence or level of the agent of concern. Use of two or 
more of these means provides for appropriate reinforcement to ensure 
that the public is protected.
    The agency's choice of readily available approaches for regulating 
animal protein products derived from ruminant and mink tissues is 
limited. For example, there are no practical tests for the presence of 
the TSE agent or of ruminant protein in animal feed. No commercial 
method of deactivating the TSE agent in animal protein products has 
been scientifically validated as effective. None of the agency's CGMP 
or HACCP regulations apply to this situation. Labeling requirements can 
be used but, by themselves, do not meet the agency's regulatory 
objectives.
2. The Regulated Industry
    Often, the industry that manufactures and distributes an FDA-
regulated product is fairly easily characterized. This facilitates 
regulation. That is not the case for animal protein products, as the 
following brief overview makes clear.
    Renderers collect animal tissues from a variety of sources, and 
process these tissues into both protein and nonprotein products. The 
renderers may be specialized (packer/renderer) or independent. The 
packer/renderer, which involves a renderer associated with a large 
slaughter operation, specializes in one species--primarily cattle, 
swine, or poultry. Thus, whether the packer/renderer handles ruminant 
materials is fairly easily determined. The independent renderer, on the 
other hand, obtains a variety of raw materials ranging from restaurant 
scraps to byproducts from multi-species slaughtering operations to dead 
animals obtained from farmers. Typically, the independent renderer does 
not have a practical method to separate incoming ruminant from 
nonruminant materials, and thus commingles both ruminant and 
nonruminant materials in the rendering process. The rendered product is 
typically designated ``meat and bone meal,'' but rendering operations 
produce a variety of other products. Renderers sell their products to 
animal protein blenders, animal feed manufacturers or pet food 
manufacturers. Virtually all rendered material at present is used 
ultimately for pet food or the feed of livestock or poultry.
    Animal protein blenders mix animal and plant protein materials to 
meet a protein guarantee stated on the label, and to make a balanced 
nutritional product. Typically, the blender does not separate ruminant 
from nonruminant animal protein in its blending operation, although it 
may keep mammalian, poultry, fish and soybean meal protein separate at 
least in the initial stages. The blender sells its products to feed or 
pet food manufacturers. Some renderers also blend animal protein 
products.
    Feed manufacturers use the protein material to make a complete feed 
(ready to be feed to animals), or a concentrated feed that needs to be 
further diluted (blended) before it can be fed to animals. The feed may 
be manufactured by an off-farm miller, or on the farm. Feed that is 
manufactured off-farm may be sold to one or more persons (for blending 
and/or further distribution) before reaching the farm.
    Farmers that feed animals typically raise one species, but may have 
more than one (including both ruminants and nonruminants). Only about 
10 percent of all animal protein products are fed to ruminants (mainly 
cattle) but approximately half of all animal protein products comes 
from ruminants.
3. Enforcement Considerations
    The industry scenario described in the preceding section presents 
unique enforcement challenges. The agency is aware, from the comments 
to the ANPRM and other sources, of concerns that the regulatory impact 
be minimized. The agency is also aware of the need to provide incentive 
for innovation, e.g., in testing methodology and manufacturing 
technology, that would reduce the need for regulation. Finally, the 
agency is aware of the need, in designing a regulatory program, to 
acknowledge the different circumstances that exist in the industries 
previously described.
    Therefore, the agency has designed a proposed regulatory scheme 
using the following principles. First, the agency has identified 
minimally necessary requirements to meet its regulatory objectives. The 
agency's goal is to apply risk management principles that minimize 
risk. Second, the proposed regulation applies greater restriction where 
the risk is greater--for example, where a firm handles both ruminant 
and nonruminant materials and intends to keep them separated. Third, 
the agency intends to rely on normal business records for much of the 
documentation it needs.
    A fourth and most important principle concerns the related 
objectives of flexibility and providing incentives to reduce 
recordkeeping and labeling requirements. The proposed regulation 
provides for the reduction or elimination of recordkeeping and labeling 
requirements, upon the development of methods for detection, 
deactivation, or verification of product identity. These provisions are 
described further in the discussion that follows.
    Industry-wide adoption of scientific advances including, or in 
addition to, those specified in the regulation, could ultimately lead 
to amendment or revocation of any final regulation. An example of an 
additional method would be the development of a practical method to 
detect the presence of ruminant protein in animal protein products or 
feed, which could be used for quality control by firms that separate 
ruminant from nonruminant protein, and by firms downstream from 
renderers.
    Similarly, research leading to identification of the TSE causative 
agent and the etiology of BSE, and the characterization of the zoonotic 
nature of animal TSE's, could also lead to amendment or revocation of 
any final regulation.

[[Page 570]]

    The agency has tentatively decided not to place any record keeping, 
labeling or other specific requirement on firms that handle only 
protein materials from nonruminant sources. An example would be a 
rendering operation that is part of a swine slaughter operation. 
However, if these firms would use or intend to use animal protein 
products containing ruminant tissues in ruminant feed, or caused such 
use or intended use, the feed would be adulterated under the act.
    The agency has also tentatively decided to require farmers (those 
responsible for feeding ruminant animals) only to make available copies 
of invoices and labeling for feed purchases. Farmers would not be 
required to maintain written procedures for handling animal protein 
products. These minimal requirements would apply even if the farmers 
were feeding both ruminant and nonruminant animals. Purchase records 
would be used primarily for traceback purposes. Because only minimal 
requirements would be placed on farmers, the proposed rules require 
that labeling for the animal protein and feed products caution against 
feeding the products to ruminants. Comments on these two tentative 
decisions are encouraged.

B. Outline of the Proposed Regulation

    The proposed regulation places two general requirements on persons 
that manufacture, blend, process, and distribute animal protein 
products and feeds made from such products. The first requirement is to 
place cautionary labeling on the protein and feed products. The second 
is a requirement to provide FDA with access to sales and purchase 
invoices, for compliance purposes. For example, an invoice obtained 
from a feed manufacturer for a protein product not labeled with the 
cautionary statement could be used to trace back to the supplying 
renderer to ensure that it manufactures and distributes animal protein 
product from nonruminant sources.
    Firms (renderers, blenders, and feed manufacturers and 
distributors) that handle animal protein products from both ruminant 
and nonruminant sources, and that intend to keep the products separate, 
would have certain additional requirements related to their source of 
nonruminant material; the need for separate facilities or cleanout 
procedures; and the need for SOP's. The same requirements would apply 
to firms that handle feeds containing animal protein products from both 
ruminant and nonruminant sources, and that intend to keep the feeds 
separate. Requirements would be greater for these operations because of 
the greater risk they would present for the possibility of ruminant 
protein being fed to ruminants.
    The proposed rule provides that some or all of the regulatory 
requirements would not apply if innovations such as development of test 
methods and deactivation processes for TSE agents were scientifically 
validated and put into commercial use. Provisions for use of such 
methods do not imply that the agency believes that such agents are or 
will be in the animal protein products. The objective is to minimize 
the risk that the agent would occur in the products, regardless of the 
level of risk. Certain minimal but additional requirements would be 
imposed in such circumstances. For example, because the innovations 
likely would be applied by renderers, the renderers would need to 
certify to downstream customers that the methods were being utilized.
    Section 589.2000(a) presents definitions of certain words used in 
the regulation. The definition of ``protein derived from ruminant and 
mink tissues'' excludes blood from bovines, milk proteins, and 
gelatins. Thus, those products are not subject to the regulatory 
provisions of the regulation. The proposed rule does not apply to any 
nonprotein animal tissues such as tallow or other fats. ``Renderer'' 
includes firms, not traditionally considered to be included within the 
definition of that term, but that collect animal tissues from various 
sources and subject them to minimal processing before offering the 
materials for use in animal feed. Also, ``feed manufacturers'' is 
defined to include both off-farm and on-farm feed manufacturing 
operations.
    Section 589.2000(b) declares that protein derived from ruminant and 
mink tissues is not GRAS when intended for use in the feed of ruminant 
animals. The use or intended use of such material in ruminant animal 
feed causes the feed to be adulterated.
    Section 589.2000(c) establishes regulatory requirements for 
renderers that manufacture products that contain or may contain protein 
derived from ruminant and mink tissues. (``May contain'' allows for the 
fact that the renderer may not be able to determine the species of some 
incoming material). These renderers typically process both ruminant and 
nonruminant materials, but do not attempt to separate ruminant from 
nonruminant materials. Section 589.2000(e) covers renderers that intend 
to separate such materials. As mentioned, renderers that process 
exclusively nonruminant materials are not covered by the specific 
requirements of the regulation. Section 589.2000(c) applies to animal 
protein products intended for use in animal feeds, as well as animal 
feeds containing such products.
    Two requirements would be placed on renderers covered by 
Sec. 589.2000(c). First, they would be required to label their products 
to indicate that they contain (or may contain) protein derived from 
ruminant and mink tissues, and that the materials should not be fed to 
ruminant animals or used to manufacture feed for ruminants. Second, the 
renderers would be required to maintain copies of sales invoices for 
all their animal protein products, and to make those copies readily 
available for inspection. As an example, FDA would use the invoices to 
follow up with customers to verify that the customers are not using the 
products to manufacture ruminant feed. Because sales invoices are 
normal business records, the agency believes that the additional burden 
imposed by this requirement would be minimal.
    Section 589.2000(c) renderers would be exempted from the labeling 
and record requirements if they used a manufacturing method that 
deactivates the agent that causes TSE's, or a test method that detects 
the presence of the agent that causes TSE's. Both methods would have to 
be validated by FDA, and made available to the public. The regulation 
would require ``routine'' use. That is, renderers would be required to 
use the test method on all incoming material or in each batch it 
manufactures.
    Section 589.2000(c) renderers would be exempted from the record 
requirements (but not the labeling requirement) if they used a safe 
method to mark the presence of the materials. The marking could be 
visible to the naked eye, e.g., through use of a dye, or by a nonvisual 
means. One ANPRM comment recommended use of a colored uniform fine iron 
product to identify specific feed ingredients. If the marking is not 
visible, the marking agent must be detectable by a method that has been 
validated by FDA, and made available to the public. The mark must be 
permanent, i.e., it must be visible in mixed feed as used on the farm.
    Section 589.2000(d) establishes regulatory requirements for persons 
other than renderers and persons responsible for feeding ruminants that 
handle animal protein products or feeds containing such products. This 
includes protein blenders, and feed manufacturers and distributors. 
However, as in the case of renderers, those firms that would otherwise 
be included in Sec. 589.2000(d) but that handle both ruminant and 
nonruminant

[[Page 571]]

materials and intend to separate the materials would be covered by 
Sec. 589.2000(e) instead. Protein blenders, and feed manufacturers and 
distributors, that handle only nonruminant materials are excluded from 
the regulatory requirements of the proposed rule.
    Persons covered by Sec. 589.2000(d) would be subject to the same 
requirements as renderers, i.e., labeling and records. The records 
would include invoices both to cover purchases and sales of animal 
protein products and feeds containing those products. For on-farm 
mixers, production records could be substituted for sales invoices.
    Section 589.2000(d) firms would be exempt from the labeling and 
record requirements if they purchased materials from renderers that 
certified the use of deactivation or detection methods as described in 
Sec. 589.2000(c). They would also be exempt from the labeling and 
record requirements if they purchased materials from persons other than 
renderers who certified that they purchased materials from renderers 
who certified the use of deactivation and detection methods as 
described in Sec. 589.2000(c). Paragraph (d) firms would also be exempt 
if they used the deactivation or detection methods described in 
Sec. 589.2000(c), where use of such method is appropriate for the 
particular firm.
    Paragraph (d) firms would be exempt from the record requirements if 
they purchased visibly-marked materials, or purchased from renderers 
that certified the use of marking methods as described in 
Sec. 589.2000(c). They would also be exempt from the record 
requirements if they used the marking methods as described in 
Sec. 589.2000(c).
    Section 589.2000(e) establishes regulatory requirements for 
renderers, protein blenders, feed manufacturers and distributors, and 
independent haulers that handle both ruminant and nonruminant 
materials, and intend to keep the products separate. Section 
589.2000(e) establishes four kinds of requirements. First, the firms 
would have the same labeling and recordkeeping requirements as 
specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Sec. 589.2000, except that the 
labeling requirement would apply only to the ruminant and mink 
materials. Second, a renderer's source of nonruminant protein materials 
would be limited to single-species facilities, i.e., facilities 
slaughtering only swine. A renderer could purchase nonruminant protein 
from more than one single-species facility. The agency believes that 
this restriction is necessary because of its understanding that it is 
not likely to be feasible for mixed species slaughterhouses to 
undertake the additional compliance costs, and possibly additional 
facility costs, that would be required to assure separation of ruminant 
and nonruminant materials. The restriction would therefore help assure 
that enforcement of Sec. 589.2000(e) would be practicable. However, the 
agency specifically requests comments on this provision.
    Third, the firms would be required to establish separate equipment 
and facilities for the two kinds of materials, or cleanout procedures 
to prevent cross contamination. Fourth, the firms would need to 
establish written SOP's specifying the cleanout procedures, if used, 
and specifying procedures for separating the materials from the time of 
receipt until the time of shipment. Although Sec. 589.2000(e) applies 
to several different kinds of firms, the agency's preliminary 
expectation is that only feed manufacturers and distributors will find 
it feasible to separate ruminant and nonruminant materials. As an 
example, a feed manufacturer might obtain ruminant materials from an 
independent renderer and swine materials from a packer/renderer, and 
use these materials to manufacture feed both for ruminants and 
nonruminants. The feed manufacturer would be required to meet the 
criteria listed previously, including the use of separate equipment and 
facilities or cleanout procedures, and the establishment of SOP's. The 
requirements of Sec. 589.2000(e) would be applicable in the 
transportation process, whether the material is hauled by the feed 
manufacturer or another party such as an independent hauler. The 
requirement for separate facilities, procedures or SOP's would not 
apply to a firm, e.g., a feed mill or hauler, that handles only 
nonruminant materials, or only ruminant materials. Nor would it apply 
to a firm that handles both ruminant and nonruminant materials but does 
not attempt to separate the two kinds of materials.
    The paragraph (e) firms would be exempted from the labeling and/or 
record keeping requirements, and the requirements related to sourcing, 
facilities and SOP's, if they meet the appropriate criteria for 
exemption. That is, renderers covered by Sec. 589.2000(e) would be 
exempt from the labeling and recordkeeping requirements if they used 
deactivation or detection methods, and from the recordkeeping 
requirements if they used marking methods. Blenders and feed 
manufacturers and distributors would be exempt in a similar manner.
    Section 589.2000(f) establishes requirements for those who are 
responsible for feeding ruminant animals. The only requirement 
contained in this paragraph is that those persons make available to FDA 
copies of purchase invoices and labeling for all incoming feeds. 
However, Sec. 589.2000(f) does not apply to the feed manufacturing 
portion of farms and feedlots that have on-farm feed manufacturing 
operations. Section 589.2000 (d) and (e) would apply in those 
instances. Furthermore, persons who feed or intend to feed ruminant 
protein to ruminant animals would be subject to regulatory action for 
using or intending to use an unapproved feed additive as established in 
Sec. 589.2000 (b).
    Section 589.2000(g) establishes that violations of Sec. 589.2000 
(c) through (f) would cause animal protein products or feed containing 
animal protein products to be adulterated under sections 402(a)(4) or 
402(a)(2)(d) of the act, or misbranded under section 403(a)(1).
    Section 589.2000(h) establishes inspection and records retention 
requirements for persons covered by section 589.2000 (c) through (f). 
Records that are required under those paragraphs would need to be kept 
for a minimum of 2 years. The agency believes that this time period is 
adequate for purposes of verifying compliance with the regulation's 
procedural requirements. The agency invites comments on the need for a 
longer retention period related to the BSE incubation period, 
especially the practicality of using such records for epidemiologic 
investigation.
    Section 589.2000(h) also requires that written procedures required 
by the regulation be made available for inspection and copying by FDA. 
The written procedures referred to are those specified in 
Sec. 589.2000(e)(3). Affected firms would be required to have a copy of 
the current procedures available at all times.

VII. Specific Protein Sources

    A number of comments discussed the exemption of certain tissues, 
including fluids, from any prohibitory rule. Most commentors favored 
the exemption of one or more tissues, including milk products; blood 
products; skeletal muscle and gelatin; and a variety of other tissues 
including both protein and nonprotein materials. Most of the comments 
cited published studies as well as positions taken by the European 
Union, European Commission, WHO and the government of France. The 
agency's comments on the status of milk, gelatin and blood follow. In 
addition, we discuss a comment on the use of canine and feline derived 
protein.

[[Page 572]]

A. Milk Proteins

    Data available to the agency suggests that milk proteins do not 
transmit the TSE agent. Research with oral exposure, intracerebral, and 
intraperitoneal administration of milk or mammary glands from BSE-
infected bovine to normal and BSE-sensitive mice has not demonstrated 
the development of TSE's (Refs. 42 and 52). An expert group under the 
auspices of WHO recommended that all countries prohibit the use of 
ruminant tissues in ruminant feed. The WHO expert group also declared 
that milk and milk products, including such products from the United 
Kingdom, are safe for human consumption. In addition, OIE has 
recommended, because of lack of infectivity, that restriction of import 
or transit of milk products from healthy animals from BSE countries 
need not be instituted. Therefore, the proposed rules provide that 
protein derived from ruminant tissues does not include milk proteins 
derived from bovine, ovine, caprine, and cervine.

B. Gelatin Proteins

    Data available to the agency suggest that gelatin does not transmit 
the TSE agent. The WHO has concluded that gelatin in the food chain is 
considered to be safe, as the conventional manufacturing process for 
gelatin has been demonstrated to significantly inactivate any residual 
infective activity that may have been present in source tissues (Ref. 
2). FDA concurs with this statement and the scientific information on 
which it is based. Thus, the proposed rule excludes gelatin from 
protein derived from ruminant tissues.

C. Blood Meal Proteins

    Data available to the agency suggests that bovine blood components 
do not transmit the TSE agent (Refs. 56, 78, and 94). Therefore, the 
proposed rule does not include blood meal from bovine as a protein 
derived from ruminant tissues.

D. Canine and Feline Derived Proteins

    One comment suggesting that canine- and feline-derived proteins 
should not be fed to ruminants because of the finding of FSE in 
domestic cats in the United Kingdom. The agency is also aware of an 
ethically-based objection by some to the rendering of the carcasses of 
pet animals. TSE has not been diagnosed in dogs or other canines. FSE 
has not been diagnosed in the United States. The agency has considered 
the information provided by the comments and the published scientific 
literature (Refs. 26 and 27), and has preliminarily determined that 
there is no measurable risk of the spread of TSE's from canine- or 
feline-derived proteins to ruminants in the United States. However, the 
agency is inviting further comment on this issue.

VIII. Environmental Impact

    FDA has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of 
this proposed rule and of five possible alternative actions. In doing 
so, the agency reviewed ANPRM comments submitted by a number of 
organizations and individuals. The comments were mostly concerned with 
the volume of material (e.g., dead animals and slaughter byproducts) 
that would be affected, and the nonrendering or rendering alternative 
means by which these materials could be disposed of, or utilized, 
safely. Comments suggested a number of uses for the processed 
materials, other than ruminant feed, including use in nonruminant 
animal feed and fertilizers, and disposal methods such as on-farm 
burial, landfilling, and incineration.
    In the environmental assessment that accompanies this proposed 
rule, FDA evaluated the environmental consequences of six different 
options. These included: No action; ruminant and mink-to-ruminant 
prohibition (the proposed action); partial ruminant and mink-to-
ruminant prohibition; mammalian-to-ruminant prohibition; prohibition of 
feeding tissues from any animal species in which TSE has been detected 
in the United States; and sheep and goat specified offal prohibition.
    The environmental assessment considered each of the alternatives in 
the context of two scenarios. The first assumes that BSE does not occur 
in the United States, regardless of the alternative selected. The 
second scenario assumes that BSE does occur in the United States, again 
regardless of the alternative selected. In the first scenario, the 
assessment considered environmental impacts related to on-farm 
disposal, landfill, incineration, and industry wastes produced. The 
second scenario considered environmental impacts related to production 
losses and impacts, wildlife exposure, on-farm disposal, landfill, and 
incineration.
    In the first scenario (no BSE), the ``no action'' alternative does 
not have environmental consequences because it is the ``status quo'' or 
baseline alternative. Environmental impacts for the other alternatives 
ranged from slight to moderate increases in environmental effects. For 
the proposed option (ruminant-to-ruminant) there would be moderate 
increases in environmental effects from on-farm disposal and landfill 
use, and slight increases in the other effects. Increases in waste 
disposal (on-farm, landfill, etc.) are anticipated to be temporary, 
however, as the markets are expected to adjust quickly to the more 
restricted uses of the ruminant materials.
    In the second scenario (occurrence of BSE), the greatest negative 
environmental effect would occur in the case of the ``no action'' 
alternative. This is because the likely spread of the BSE agent through 
animal feed before the first BSE case is diagnosed would result in 
disposal of large numbers of animals by means other than rendering. 
Similar large impacts would occur with the sheep and goat, and TSE 
animal, options. Minimum environmental consequences would occur with 
the proposed option (ruminant-to-ruminant), because the spread of the 
BSE agent would have been controlled. Minimum to small effects would 
result from the remaining two options, partial ruminant prohibition and 
mammalian-to-ruminant prohibition.
    The agency has concluded that the proposed rule will not have a 
significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental 
impact statement is not required. FDA's finding of no significant 
impact (FONSI) and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in 
an environmental assessment (EA) prepared under 21 CFR 25.31, may be 
seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. 
and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FDA invites comments and submission 
of data concerning the EA and FONSI.

IX. Analysis of Impacts

    FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive 
Order 12866, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), 
and under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (Pub. L. 104-4). Executive 
Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of 
available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to 
select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including 
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other 
advantages; and distributive impacts and equity). The Regulatory 
Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that 
would minimize any significant impact of a rule on small entities. The 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act requires that agencies prepare an 
assessment of anticipated costs and benefits before proposing any rule 
that may result in an annual expenditure by State, local, and tribal 
governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of 
$100,000,000 (adjusted annually for inflation). FDA

[[Page 573]]

concludes that this proposed rule is consistent with the principles set 
forth in the Executive Order and in these two statutes.
    A study of the impacts on industry of the proposed rule (on file 
with the Docket Management Branch (Ref. 114)) conducted for FDA by the 
Eastern Research Group (ERG), a private consulting firm, and the 
discussion in the remainder of this section, demonstrate that the 
proposed rule constitutes an economically significant rule as described 
in the Executive Order. The agency has further determined that the 
proposed rule will have a significant impact on a substantial number of 
small entities. The proposal makes no mandates on government entities 
and is estimated to result in aggregate net annual costs ranging from 
$21.4 to $48.2 million to the private sector.

A. The Need for Regulation

    Although BSE has not been diagnosed in the United States, the need 
for regulatory action is based on a need to protect U.S. livestock from 
the risk of contracting BSE. In its guidelines for the preparation of 
Economic Impact Analyses, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
directs Federal regulatory agencies to determine whether a market 
failure exists, and if so, whether that market failure could be 
resolved by measures other than new Federal regulation. In this 
instance, private incentive systems for both suppliers and purchasers 
may fail in markets for cattle, rendering, and ruminant feed. The 
potential for market failure among the suppliers in these sectors 
results from the externality that could be created by individual 
suppliers imposing economic hardships on other suppliers within the 
industry. The potential for market failure among the purchasers results 
from the inadequate information that would be available to purchasers 
of potentially infective products.
    Any renderer, feed manufacturer, or cattle producer that permits 
animal protein derived from ruminants and mink to be placed in ruminant 
feed increases the risk that other renderers, feed manufacturers, or 
cattle producers will suffer the severe economic consequences that 
would follow an outbreak of BSE in the United States. The industry is 
aware of this risk, as evidenced by the existence of voluntary programs 
aimed at reducing the transmission of the infectious agent. These 
include an adult sheep rendering ban recommended by the NRA, a 
recommended ban on the feeding of rendered ruminant protein to 
ruminants by the NCBA and others, and scrapie-free certification 
programs by individual sheep producers. Although the benefits of such 
programs--the reduction or elimination of the risk of an outbreak of 
BSE and the increased consumer confidence in the safety of the 
industries' products--accrue to all members of these industries, 
compliance with these measures is incomplete, because individual 
noncomplying members can avoid the costs of risk reduction measures 
while still enjoying the benefits of compliance by others in the 
industry.
    If purchasers could easily identify the risks of infective agent 
contamination associated with products from specific suppliers, they 
could more easily take defensive actions to reduce these risks (e.g., 
refusing products from cattle known to have consumed specified ruminant 
proteins). Purchasers are unlikely to obtain the information they need, 
however, for several reasons. First, the long incubation period for BSE 
creates a lag between the actual onset and the recognition of the 
disease and could lead to a suboptimal level of risk prevention by the 
concerned parties during the incubation period. By the time the first 
signs of disease are observed, many animals may have been already 
exposed. Moreover, renderers sell their product to feed manufacturers 
who frequently combine proteins from many different plant sources and 
animal species to produce cattle feed. Ruminant producers, therefore, 
have no sure way of knowing whether a particular batch of feed is free 
from potentially infective proteins and cannot easily avoid purchasing 
risky feed. Finally, if renderers or feed manufacturers do not believe 
that BSE is an important threat they may choose not to take preventive 
action, regardless of the risk levels perceived by epidemiological 
experts or consumers.

B. Benefits

    The proposed rule would reduce the risk of an outbreak and 
subsequent proliferation of BSE disease in the United States. It may 
also forestall the loss of consumer confidence in the U.S. beef market 
due to concerns about BSE and its implications. Thus, the benefits of 
this proposal would include the value of reduced risks to human and 
animal health and to the economic stability of the U.S. livestock and 
livestock dependent industries compared to the ``no action'' option. In 
technical terms, these benefits measure the expected value of the 
future disease-related costs that might be averted by the proposed 
rule. Specifically, they are calculated as a product of three factors: 
(1) The probability that, in the absence of this rule, BSE would be 
introduced and proliferate in the United States, (2) the costs, both 
direct and indirect, that would be associated with the spread of BSE in 
the United States, and (3) the extent to which the proposed rule would 
reduce the likelihood of BSE proliferation.
    BSE has not been detected in the United States and the probability 
that it currently exists is remote. Nevertheless, it is possible that 
BSE could develop in the future. Once developed, BSE could remain 
undetected for several years because of its long incubation period and 
because, at present, it can be diagnosed reliably only by microscopic 
brain examination after death. During the period between introduction 
and diagnosis, the disease could spread as it apparently did in the 
U.K. via intake of infective feed. If regulation was delayed until 
after discovery, the costs would be substantial. By addressing the 
central risk factors associated with BSE, FDA believes that the 
proposed rule would eliminate the vast majority of the BSE-related 
risks and costs.
    BSE was first detected in the U.K. in November 1986, and a ban on 
ruminant offal in ruminant feed was imposed in the U.K. in July 1988 
(Ref. 115). An analysis of cattle born before and after the feed ban 
went into effect suggests that the feed ban significantly decreased 
disease transmission (Ref. 116). This analysis found that the incidence 
of confirmed BSE roughly doubled each year for animals born between 
July 1985 and July 1988, but declined precipitously in animals born in 
August 1988 compared to the previous year and continued to fall 
thereafter. Because BSE has a long incubation period, however, a 
decrease in the incidence was not evident until several years after the 
initial feed ban was implemented. The incidence of BSE peaked in 1992 
at 36,681 detected cases, or approximately 0.3 percent of the UK's 11.5 
million cattle. Despite a sharp decrease in the incidence rate since 
then, by the end of 1996, more than 165,000 cases of BSE will have been 
detected, with one-third of all U.K. cattle herds infected (Refs. 115 
and 117).
    The likelihood that BSE will someday be developed in the United 
States cannot be estimated with any confidence, although U.S. risk 
factors are believed to be significantly smaller than existed in the 
United Kingdom of the early 1980's. As described previously, the 
various remaining modes include transmission from scrapie-infected 
sheep or other animals with TSE, e.g., through meat and bone meal; 
introduction via imported

[[Page 574]]

animals; and spontaneous introduction (which in some TSE's has been 
hypothesized to occur at a rate of about 1 case per million per year). 
USDA import controls and the voluntary bans on sheep offal and ruminant 
tissues in ruminant foods reduce the risk of disease introduction but 
cannot completely eliminate it.
    Although FDA cannot quantitatively estimate the risk of a 
significant BSE outbreak in the United States, the agency has used the 
U.K. experience, modified to account for major differences in 
circumstances, to assess the consequences of the potential spread of 
the disease within the United States. If BSE were introduced in this 
country, the pattern of disease spread would presumably be similar to 
that in the United Kingdom, with most symptomatic disease appearing in 
older cattle (the average time for BSE symptoms is approximately 5 
years after infection (Ref. 115)). The rate of spread of symptomatic 
disease would probably differ, however, because compared with the pre-
BSE U.K. dairy industry, U.S. dairy cows are younger and are exposed to 
meat and bone meal in feed later in life than was true in the United 
Kingdom (Ref. 118). United Kingdom dairy animals were historically fed 
meat and bone meal as calves, whereas U.S. dairy cows ingest meat and 
bone meal primarily as adults.
1. Methodology
    To develop an illustrative estimate of the number of cattle that 
might be lost to BSE infection if the disease were to occur in the 
United States in the absence of regulation, FDA extrapolated from the 
experience in the United Kingdom, but adjusted for the differences in 
cattle age and potential age of exposure to meat and bone meal. This 
extrapolation assumes that the detection of BSE in this country would 
quickly lead to a ruminant-to-ruminant feed prohibition but that, as in 
the United Kingdom, BSE incidence would nonetheless continue to 
increase for 6 years due to the disease's long incubation time (hence 
several years of disease spread before the diagnosis of the first 
case). To account for the difference in cattle age-related risk 
factors, FDA assumed that, if BSE occurred in the United States, the 
affected animals would be predominately dairy cows of age 4 or more, 
rather than age 3 and up as in the U.K. (due to the differences in age 
of exposure.) The difference of 1 year is based on the agency's 
estimate that U.S. cattle are first exposed to meat and bone meal 1 
year later than U.K. cattle. Therefore, the onset of the clinical 
disease is estimated to start 1 year later. Accordingly, only 47 
percent of U.S. dairy cows are age 4 and up (about 4.8 million cows), 
while 90 percent of United Kingdom cows are age 3 and up (about 2.6 
million cows). Thus, a lower percentage of U.S. cattle were assumed to 
be at risk of symptomatic BSE, and the projected rate of death was 
proportionately lower. Based on the relative size of the U.S. and U.K. 
dairy cattle populations, these projections suggest that if BSE were 
introduced in the United States and spread in a similar manner, the 
disease would destroy 299,000 U.S. cattle over 11 years (4.8 x 2.6 x 
162,000 U.K. BSE deaths). (These calculations assume that a feed 
prohibition would be implemented very soon after the first case is 
diagnosed, and that the prohibition would immediately begin to affect 
the underlying rate of new infection. If a feed prohibition were not 
implemented at that time, the number of cattle deaths would be much 
higher.)
    Other adjustments could be made to this estimate, but their effect 
on the direction of the results would be uncertain. For example, 
compared with U.K. practices before 1988, U.S. dairy cattle consume a 
higher proportion of concentrated feed that contains meat and bone 
meal. On the other hand, most U.S. concentrate contains a lower 
percentage of meat and bone meal (and a higher percentage of vegetable-
based proteins). If BSE infectivity in feed is highly dose-dependent, 
these factors could cause FDA's cost estimate to be either too high or 
too low, if one of the factors is dominant over the other.
    The risks and costs associated with BSE when it occurs are 
primarily of three types. First, there is the possible risk and 
associated cost of ruminant-to-human transmission of TSE disease. The 
proposed rule would reduce this risk by eliminating the main routes by 
which ruminants might acquire transmissible TSE, greatly reducing any 
risk incurred by the human consumption of ruminant-derived products. 
Thus, the proposed rule would reduce the risk of future mortality, 
morbidity, and health care costs due to human TSE. Second, there is the 
risk of livestock losses. These losses include not only the deaths of 
BSE-infected animals, but also the loss and disposal costs of other 
animals that would be destroyed, either to contain the immediate spread 
of disease or to restore consumer confidence in the safety of beef and 
dairy products. Third, there are the costs associated with decreased 
domestic sales and exports of beef and other bovine-derived products 
until consumer and international confidence could be restored.
2. Reduced Risk to Public Health
    As discussed earlier, scientists believe that the nv-CJD cases 
identified in the U.K. may have been associated with the BSE epidemic. 
If indeed there were such an association, and if BSE were to occur in 
this country, there would be a risk of spreading BSE-related human TSE 
in the United States The proposed rule therefore might avert human 
deaths in the United States, although the number of deaths cannot be 
estimated. The proposed rule would also save the health care and other 
costs associated with treating individuals with the disease.
3. Reduced Risk of Direct Livestock Losses
    For estimating the present value of livestock losses if BSE 
occurred in the United States, FDA assumed that the first case of BSE 
would not be detected--even in the absence of the proposed rule--for 4 
years. Based on an estimated value of $502 per animal (Ref. 119) and 
disposal costs of $4 per animal, direct losses from the death of 
299,000 BSE-infected cattle would reach $151 million over 11 years 
(starting 4 years from now). At a discount rate of 7 percent, the total 
present value of these losses is $75 million.
    In addition to the animal losses from direct infection, a 
significant outbreak would probably lead to the eradication of high-
risk animals to restore consumer confidence. Switzerland, for example, 
has proposed slaughtering all cattle born before that country 
implemented a feed ban, or approximately one-eighth of its national 
herd (Ref. 120). The United Kingdom has begun a program to destroy and 
incinerate all animals over age 30 months as they reach the end of 
their useful life, or about 1 million animals in 1996 and a total of 
4.7 million over 6 years. In addition, the United Kingdom has a program 
to slaughter some unmarketable male dairy calves (126,000 had been 
slaughtered as of August 1996) and up to 147,000 additional ``high-
risk'' animals (Refs. 115 and 121). Even if the U.K. eradication of 
animals were limited to a one-time total of 1 million cattle (about 8.7 
percent of their cattle stock), similar measures in the United States, 
if they occurred immediately upon detection of the disease, would 
result in the one-time destruction of $4.58 billion worth of cattle, 
with a present value of $3.49 billion.
4. Costs of Future Regulation
    Moreover, the ability to control a BSE outbreak once it occurred 
would require putting in place restrictions on the use

[[Page 575]]

of ruminant proteins in ruminant feeds that would be at least as 
restrictive as the measure under this proposed rule. Presumably, the 
total costs of implementing a ruminant-to-ruminant feed prohibition at 
that point would be at least as great as the low estimates for this 
proposed rule, or $21.4 million per year. The present value of these 
future regulatory costs would total approximately $240 million. 
Moreover, this estimate may vastly understate the economic impact 
because the market value of ruminant-derived proteins could disappear 
if there were an actual outbreak.
5. Reduced Risk of Losses in Domestic Sales and Exports
    If BSE were to emerge in the United States, the news could greatly 
reduce both domestic sales and exports of bovine products. In the 
United Kingdom, domestic consumption fell by more than 20 percent 
between 1988 and 1990 and has not yet fully recovered (Ref. 122), 
presumably due to continuing concerns about possible links between BSE 
and CJD. If U.S. consumers acted similarly, U.S. producers of beef 
products could lose over $9 billion in annual sales (Ref. 123). 
Alternatively, U.S. consumers might demonstrate considerably less 
concern, as the U.K. experience may have improved the ability of U.S. 
risk managers to communicate both the extent of the risk of contracting 
CJD from the consumption of beef and the responsiveness of the 
government's safety policies. Nonetheless, it remains probable that the 
uncertainty surrounding a serious BSE outbreak would lead U.S. 
consumers to reduce their consumption and spending on beef by a 
significant amount. Also, at the same time that U.K. domestic sales of 
beef were declining due to the fear of BSE, the volume of U.K. exported 
beef fell by nearly 16 percent (Ref. 122). Based on U.S. beef exports 
in 1994 of approximately $2.2 billion (Ref. 109), a proportional 
decline of this magnitude would reduce U.S. exports by up to $0.3 
billion per year.
    While the values of such lost domestic and international sales 
would reduce the profits of the U.S. beef industry and the enjoyment of 
some U.S. consumers of beef, they do not provide an accurate measure of 
societal costs, because competitor industries, such as poultry, pork, 
and seafood, would gain new profits. Thus, the net costs that would 
result from such potential shifts in consumer spending cannot be 
precisely discerned without extensive economic modeling. While FDA 
examined a partial equilibrium model for projecting the approximate 
losses of consumer and producer surplus within the market for beef 
products, the agency could not adequately quantify the likely effects 
on the markets for substitutes of beef. Consequently, FDA could not 
estimate the net economic cost of these lost sales. Nevertheless, the 
magnitude of these potential costs could be substantial and the agency 
requests public comment on how the appropriate measurement 
methodologies could be developed and applied.
    Finally, even in the absence of evidence of BSE in the United 
States, consumer concern about BSE could affect beef consumption and 
expenditures. Thus, one benefit of implementing the proposed rule now 
is that it might prevent a loss of consumer confidence in the beef 
market, irrespective of the actual risk of BSE. FDA did not attempt to 
quantify this potential loss, but believes that it also may be 
substantial, particularly in light of the recent increased U.S. 
publicity of BSE and its hypothesized links to CJD.
6. Total Losses Averted
    In summary, the losses averted by the proposed rule include the 
expected value of the costs associated with BSE itself, and the 
potential value of forestalling a drop in domestic and international 
demand for U.S. beef due to BSE-related causes. The first component 
largely reflects the statistical probability that BSE could occur and 
spread within the United States and the potential $3.7 billion cost of 
destroying BSE-exposed livestock. The second primarily measures the 
expected loss to U.S. consumers and producers that would result from 
reduced sales. While FDA has not quantified these latter costs, 
plausible scenarios indicate that they could reach billions of dollars. 
Moreover, these figures have not included the possibility of lost lives 
and treatment costs associated with treating human TSE.
    Finally, the expected benefits of the proposed rule are slightly 
lower than the sum of the expected value of all the costs associated 
with BSE, because the rule would not totally eliminate all of the 
related risk (e.g., due to the possibility of spontaneous introduction 
of disease and the possible incomplete compliance with the rule). FDA 
believes, however, that any remaining risk would be extremely small. In 
addition, because the rate of BSE infection and the associated costs 
would probably vary geographically (as scrapie does now) (Ref. 98) , 
the benefits would vary across regions of the country.
7. Comparison of Alternatives
    As described elsewhere in this document, FDA is considering five 
alternatives to the proposed rule, in addition to other options that 
might be offered in the comments. The first three of these alternatives 
are: (1) No action (relying on voluntary industry activities), (2) 
prohibit only materials from U.S. species in which TSE has been 
diagnosed, and (3) a prohibition on proteins from specified sheep and 
goat offal in ruminant feed. Compared with the proposed action, 
prohibiting proteins from all U.S. TSE species provides similar 
reductions in the risk that BSE might be introduced, with a sheep/goat 
specified offal protein ban and no action providing progressively less 
risk reduction. The TSE species alternative, however, would be 
significantly less effective in limiting the spread of BSE (e.g., after 
spontaneous introduction) until BSE was diagnosed and cattle were added 
to the list of TSE species. Likewise, the two other alternatives would 
be significantly less effective in inhibiting the spread of ruminant-
to-ruminant transmission of disease once BSE is introduced. Thus, the 
expected value of the benefits of each of the three rejected options is 
substantially lower than the proposed rule, although the amount of 
difference cannot be estimated precisely.
    The agency is also considering two other alternatives: (1) A 
mammalian-protein-to-ruminant prohibition, and (2) a partial ruminant-
to-ruminant prohibition which would exclude all ruminant and mink 
tissues except certain bovine tissues. Compared with the proposed rule, 
both alternatives offer similar benefits in substantially inhibiting 
the initial introduction of BSE. The extent of inhibition of the spread 
of disease (and associated costs), however, would be different.
    The mammalian protein alternative would further reduce the spread 
of disease compared with the proposed rule, by reducing the risk of 
cross-contamination within rendering and processing plants. Thus, this 
alternative would bring the expected value of the BSE-related costs 
even closer to zero than would the proposed measure. However, the 
incremental benefit is small if cross- contamination under the proposed 
measure does not pose a substantial risk.
    The partial ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition would be less 
effective than the proposed measure, because it would be more 
administratively difficult to enforce. Thus, this alternative would not 
reduce the expected value of the

[[Page 576]]

BSE-related costs as much as the proposal. Again, however, the exact 
difference cannot be estimated, but would vary depending on the likely 
level of compliance under the alternative.

C. Industry Impacts

    The ERG study examines the composition, size, and scale of economic 
activity for the various affected industry sectors and provides 
estimates of the cost and high and low market impacts (depending on the 
size of the price change for restricted meat and bone meal of five 
regulatory options (see Table 1).

1. The Proposed Rule
    The proposed alternative would prohibit the use of ruminant and 
mink protein in ruminant feeds. Currently, only about 10 percent of the 
meat and bone meal supply is used in ruminant feed, but over 80 percent 
of the meat and bone meal contains some ruminant material. ERG forecast 
that because no mixed-species slaughtering or rendering establishments 
would find it profitable to separate ruminant from nonruminant offal, 
most would continue to contain ruminant material. ERG estimated that 
affected renderers and feedmills would incur total direct compliance 
costs ranging from $10.2 to $27.6 million per year. Renderers would 
bear annual costs of about $6.3 million and feed mills would bear 
annual costs of from $3.8 to $21.3 million. Arrayed by compliance 
category, transportation costs were estimated at $7.6 million; 
documentation costs for activities to ensure control of ruminant feed 
constituents ranged from $1.5 to $1.8 million; and capital costs and 
operating costs ranged from $1.0 to $8.2 million and $0.1 to $10.1 
million, respectively, due primarily to the need for some feedmills to 
expand their capacity to offer both ruminant and nonruminant feed 
products under a high market impact scenario.
    Because consumer response to the rule is uncertain, ERG could not 
develop a precise projection of future meat and bone meal prices. ERG 
estimated, however, that the regulatory prohibition of marketing 
ruminant meat and bone meal to ruminants would lower the price of this 
product by from $25 to $100 per ton, decreasing rendering industry 
revenues by from $63.2 to $252.8 million per year. In contrast, a lower 
MBM price would increase sales of meat and bone meal to the nonruminant 
sector and the resulting increased profits for that sector would 
offset, at an aggregate level, most revenue losses. Although ERG did 
not quantify this effect, FDA determined that the assumption of a fixed 
supply of meat and bone meal and a linear demand for nonruminant feed 
implies that purchasers of mixed-species meat and bone meal for 
nonruminant uses would save from $60.0 to $240.2 million annually, 
because of the lower meat and bone meal costs. This estimate assumes a 
total meat and bone meal supply of 2.5 million tons, changes in price 
ranging from $25 to $100 per ton, and an increase in nonruminant 
consumption of meat and bone meal of about 250,000 tons. In addition, 
manufacturers of ruminant feed would incur higher costs if they could 
not use ruminant proteins. In an analysis prepared for the feed 
industry, protein substitutes, such as soybean meal and other minerals 
necessary to provide the same nutritional level as that provided by the 
meat and bone meal, were estimated to cost approximately $31.75 per ton 
more than meat and bone meal (Ref. 125). FDA believes that this 
estimate is overstated, because it assumes that soybean meal alone 
sells for $20 per ton more than meat and bone meal. In fact, their 
respective market prices are currently similar. Nevertheless, FDA used 
the reported $31.75 per ton differential to estimate that the higher 
price of alternative proteins would increase ruminant feed costs by 
about $8.0 million per year.
    As a result, FDA estimates that the aggregated annualized costs of 
this proposal, comprised of both the direct compliance costs and the 
various indirect gains and losses, would total

[[Page 577]]

from $21.4 to $48.2 million. Although the greatest initial burden would 
fall on the rendering and feed manufacturing sectors, ERG noted that 
the final distribution of these impacts would shift; renderers would 
pass back the economic impacts to slaughterers, who, in turn, would 
pass them back to cattle producers. FDA judged, however, that of the 
small renderers dependent upon farmers' and ranchers' dead stock for 
their raw materials, 20 to 25 would be likely to close. ERG also 
forecast that these impacts would cause a decline in prices for 
slaughter-weight cattle of $1 to $5 per head. In the long run, ERG 
foresaw a modest reduction in the size of the U.S. cattle herd.
    In response to its ANPRM, FDA received comments on the possible 
impacts of the proposal from both individuals and industry. The 
submission from the American Feed Industry Association (AFIA) contained 
an analysis of the animal feed market that was based on the assumption 
that the proposal would taint the safety of all meat and bone meal 
(both ruminant and nonruminant), to the extent that even nonruminant 
animal producers would refuse to purchase the product. This loss of 
wholesale value was estimated at $523 million. Further, the AFIA 
comment estimated the cost for disposing of this meat and bone meal at 
$349 million and for substituting to higher priced feeds at $74 million 
annually.
    FDA questions the conclusions of the AFIA report, largely because 
the proposed rule does not prohibit the use of ruminant proteins in 
nonruminant feeds and there is no evidence that this market would 
disappear. As noted earlier, nonruminant feed use currently constitutes 
about 90 percent of the meat and bone meal market. While some 
nonruminant producers may be wary of ruminant MBM after the proposal 
becomes final, the broad media coverage of BSE in the United Kingdom 
and the voluntary prohibition of ruminant MBM in ruminant feeds have 
already provided nonruminant producers with substantial information on 
the relevant risks. The implications of the ERG study are that most of 
the major nonruminant sectors that use ruminant meat and bone meal in 
their feeds would continue this practice, particularly at sharply lower 
MBM prices. Because ERG believed that all stocks of meat and bone meal 
would find a commercial outlet within the nonruminant feed sector, they 
projected no additional disposal costs and far smaller revenue losses 
than AFIA.
2. Partial Ruminant-to-Ruminant Prohibition
    ERG also estimated the economic impact of a partial ruminant-to-
ruminant prohibition, which would prohibit only the use of proteins 
from designated ruminant tissues in ruminant feeds. ERG projected that 
cattle packer/renderers and approximately one-half of the large cattle 
packers would choose to separate the designated and nondesignated 
tissues. As shown in Table 1, this change in processing would lead to 
increased costs from capital investments, increases in operating and 
transportation expenses, training, and documentation activities. 
Further, ERG projected, under the high market impact scenario, that 
some feedmills would expand their facilities to offer both restricted 
and nonrestricted meat and bone meal. They estimated the annualized 
direct compliance costs for this option at from $23.5 to $27.9 million. 
In addition, ERG projected that this option would cause price declines 
of from $25 to $100 per ton for the meat and bone meal derived from 
designated tissues, leading to decreases in renderer revenues of from 
$28.8 to $115.4 million per year. As discussed previously, FDA again 
assumed a fixed supply of meat and bone meal and a linear demand for 
nonruminant feed to calculate that purchasers of mixed-species meat and 
bone meal for nonruminant uses would save from $27.4 million to $109.6 
million annually because of the lower meat and bone meal costs. Adding 
additional protein substitution costs of $3.7 million and other 
indirect costs raises the estimated net aggregate costs for this 
alternative to $28.6 to $37.4 million.
3. Mammalian-to-Ruminant Prohibition
    The third option assessed was the prohibition of mammalian protein 
in ruminant feeds. ERG projected that slaughtering and rendering 
establishments would have no reason to separate offal because very few 
of these establishments process both mammals and nonmammals. They 
estimated annualized direct compliance costs for this option at $31.6 
million. ERG forecast that, regardless of the size of the price decline 
for restricted meat and bone meal, some feedmills would expand their 
capacity to offer both restricted and nonrestricted meat and bone meal, 
resulting in increased capital and plant operating costs. The majority 
of the remaining regulatory costs are composed of documentation costs. 
Assuming that a regulatory prohibition on marketing restricted meat and 
bone meal to ruminants would cause the price of the restricted meat and 
bone meal to fall by from $25 to $100 per ton, ERG projected that this 
option would reduce renderer revenues by from $76.4 to $305.6 million 
per year. Alternatively, under the same assumptions as applied above, 
FDA found that purchasers of mixed-species meat and bone meal for 
nonruminant uses would save from $72.6 million to $290.3 million 
annually, because of the lower meat and bone meal costs. Adding 
additional protein substitution costs of $9.7 million and other 
indirect costs raises the estimated net aggregate costs for this third 
option to from $45.1 to $56.6 million.
4. Other Regulatory Alternatives
    FDA also considered two less restrictive options for controlling 
the spread of an outbreak of BSE in the United States: A prohibition of 
all sheep, goat, mink, deer, and elk proteins in ruminant feed; and a 
prohibition of sheep and goat proteins in ruminant feed. The first of 
these alternatives would require that ruminants not be fed proteins 
from any species in which a TSE was diagnosed in the United States, 
which includes sheep, goats, mink, deer, and elk. ERG anticipated 
minimal regulatory impacts for sheep, lamb, and goat producers because 
most renderers already require that sheep, lamb, and goat offal be 
excluded from mixed species meat and bone meal. ERG estimated that this 
alternative could restrict the use of up to 34,150 tons of offal 
annually from the various species, or about 0.3 percent of all 
mammalian offal rendered. Using an estimated cost of $150/ton for 
landfill disposal, ERG calculated that the disposal costs for this 
alternative could equal $5.1 million. Furthermore, ERG estimated that 
the meat and bone meal and tallow manufactured from offal generates 
revenues of about $500/ton of processed material. Under this option, 
meat and bone meal production would fall by 8,450 tons per year, 
reducing industry revenues by an estimated $4.2 million annually.
    The final alternative would restrict only sheep and goat protein 
from use in ruminant feed. This alternative is similar to the agency's 
1994 proposal, which pertained only to adult sheep and goats. Most 
sheep and goats are currently excluded by renderers from being rendered 
into mixed species meat and bone meal. ERG estimated that this 
alternative would restrict the use of up to 1,200 tons of offal, or 
about 0.01 percent of all mammalian offal rendered. At $150/ton for 
landfill disposal, the disposal costs would equal $0.2 million. ERG 
calculated that

[[Page 578]]

production of meat and bone meal under this option would be restricted 
by only 300 tons per year, leading to revenue losses of about $0.1 
million.
    ERG noted that the disposal costs presented for the latter two 
alternatives are high-end estimates because of the likelihood of onsite 
disposal for deer and elk taken by hunters. Further, these alternatives 
were not expected to have a measurable effect on the price of meat and 
bone meal because they would affect only 0.3 percent and 0.01 percent 
of the meat and bone meal markets, respectively. In contrast to the 
first three options, these rules would not change the demand for meat 
and bone meal, but would restrict the supply of meat and bone meal. Any 
postregulation increase in price, therefore, would increase revenues of 
renderers and costs of purchasers of meat and bone meal by an almost 
equal amount. ERG reported that this decrease in supply would have a 
negligible effect on meat and bone meal prices.

D. Small Business Impacts

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to prepare a 
regulatory flexibility analysis if a rule would have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The discussion in 
this section, as well as in other sections of this document, and the 
ERG report, constitute the agency's compliance with this requirement.
    The Regulatory Flexibility Act asks for a succinct statement of the 
purpose and objectives of the rule. As explained previously in this 
document, FDA is proposing this measure to address the risk to U.S. 
livestock associated with feeding ruminant proteins to ruminants. 
Existing epidemiological evidence suggests a link between an outbreak 
of BSE in the United Kingdom and the practice of feeding products to 
cattle that included ruminant proteins. This rule would prohibit that 
practice. Thus, the need for regulatory action is based on the need to 
prevent the spread of BSE and thereby to protect the health of animals 
and to minimize any risk that might be posed to humans from BSE.
    The Regulatory Flexibility Act also requires a description of the 
affected small entities. The ERG study includes counts of entities in 
each class of industry that are involved in ruminant production and 
meat preparation. The vast majority of all of these firms are 
considered small businesses according to size standards set by the 
Small Business Administration. There are 282 rendering plants, of which 
204 have fewer than 500 employees, including all of the 152 independent 
renderers. ERG also estimated that 30,000 feedmills, all with fewer 
than 500 employees, could be affected by this rule. An estimated 1.4 
million enterprises are engaged in ruminant production. These include 
businesses engaged in the production of beef and dairy cattle, 
including farmers and ranchers, stocker operators, and cattle feeders, 
and other ruminant producers. The slaughtering industry contains more 
than 4,000 establishments. Of this total, however, only 130 are packer/
renderers that could have compliance requirements and about 52 of these 
establishments have fewer than 500 employees. ERG estimated that almost 
300,000 small establishments are engaged in meat processing. These 
businesses would have no direct compliance activities, but could be 
affected indirectly by altered renderer practices. Also, about 150,000 
small producers of nonruminant animals could gain from lower feed 
costs.
    The RFA also requires a description of the recordkeeping 
requirements of the proposed rule. The ERG report presents detailed 
estimates of these costs. ERG found that the rule would require certain 
feed manufacturers to develop new written operating procedures. In 
addition, affected firms would have to retain invoices but FDA believes 
this activity is already generally accepted business practice.
    Finally, the Regulatory Flexibility Act asks for an evaluation of 
any regulatory overlaps and regulatory alternatives that would minimize 
costs to small entities. FDA is unaware of any significant regulatory 
conflicts with other Federal rules. FDA examined five regulatory 
alternatives in addition to no action: (1) The ruminant-to-ruminant 
prohibition; (2) the partial ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition; (3) the 
mammalian-to- ruminant prohibition; (4) the prohibition of all sheep, 
goat, mink, deer, and elk proteins in ruminant feed; and (5) the 
prohibition of specified sheep and goat proteins in ruminant feed. The 
ERG report provides a detailed comparison of the respective impacts of 
these alternatives and found that the estimated direct compliance costs 
are lower under the proposed rule ($10.2 to $27.6 million) than under 
two of the alternative rules ($23.5 to $27.9 million for the partial 
ruminant-to-ruminant option, $31.6 million for the mammalian-to-
ruminant option). The other alternatives would not be nearly as 
effective at reducing the risk of an outbreak and spread of BSE, but 
are considerably less costly. As many of the above projections are 
uncertain, FDA particularly invites additional data or comment on the 
effects of the proposed and alternative rules on any group of small 
businesses.

E. Unfunded Mandates Analysis

    Based on the ERG study, FDA estimated that aggregate expenditures 
by the private sector that result from the proposed rule, issued under 
21 CFR 589.2000, will range from $10.2 to $27.6 million per year. As 
described in section IX.B. of this document, the benefits of this 
measure accrue both to the general public (through decreased risks to 
health) and to the livestock and associated industries. The costs of 
the measure are borne by the private sector, primarily the rendering 
and animal feed industries. Because FDA anticipates no significant 
additional costs to State, local, or tribal governments, this 
regulatory action does not require an assessment under the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act.

X. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995

    This proposed rule contains recordkeeping requirements that are 
subject to public comment and review by OMB under the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-13). Therefore, in accordance with 5 
CFR part 1320, a description of reporting requirements is given in 
Table 2 of this document, with an estimate of the annual collection of 
information burden. Included in the estimate is the time for reviewing 
instructions, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing 
and reviewing the collection of information.
    With respect to the following collection of information, FDA is 
soliciting comments on: (1) Whether the proposed collection of 
information is necessary for proper performance of FDA's functions, 
including whether the information will have practical utility; (2) the 
accuracy of FDA's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of 
information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions 
used; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of the 
collection of information on those who are to respond, including 
through the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of 
information technology, when appropriate.
    Title: Substances Prohibited from Use in Animal Food or Feed; 
Animal Proteins Prohibited in Ruminant Feed.
    Description: The proposed rule (Sec. 589.2000) provides that 
protein derived from ruminant and mink tissues is not GRAS for use in 
ruminant feed and is a food additive subject to section 409 of the act. 
Proteins derived from

[[Page 579]]

animal tissues contained in such feed ingredients in distribution 
cannot be readily determined by recipients engaged in the manufacture, 
processing and distribution, and use of animal feeds and feed 
ingredients. To achieve the public and animal health objectives of this 
proposed rule, the agency believes that manufacturers, processors, 
distributors, and users must be responsible for ensuring and 
appropriately maintaining the identity of the specific nature of the 
components of animal protein products and animal feeds containing these 
products.
    Thus, under the agency's authority in section 701(a) (21 U.S.C. 
371(a)) of the act to issue regulations for the efficient enforcement 
of the act, this proposed rule places three general requirements on 
persons that manufacture, blend, process and distribute products that 
contain or may contain protein derived from ruminant and mink tissues, 
and feeds made from such products. The first requirement is for 
cautionary labeling of these products with direct language developed by 
FDA. The second requirement is for these establishments to provide FDA 
with access to their purchase and sales invoices for compliance 
purposes. FDA believes that maintenance of such records is a usual and 
customary part of normal business activities for such firms. These two 
requirements are not within the scope of the Paperwork Reduction Act. 
The third requirement is recordkeeping which requires that the firms 
develop standard operating procedures if they intend to keep ruminant 
and mink material separate from nonruminant material. The agency is 
aware that the certification procedures provided in Sec. 589.2000(d) of 
the regulation could be interpreted as imposing a paperwork burden on 
certain industry segments. However, the agency notes that the 
certification procedures apply only where new technology (e.g., a 
deactivation method) is developed. The agency was unable to estimate 
when such technology might be developed, what its characteristics and 
costs would be, and other essential information needed to make 
realistic estimates of any paperwork burden. Therefore, such costs are 
not included in this proposed rule. However, the agency specifically 
requests comments and information related to the factors that would 
determine the extent of any paperwork burden.
    The recordkeeping burden in Table 2 has been estimated using the 
typical average size establishment that is expected to handle animal 
protein from both ruminant and nonruminant sources, or feeds containing 
these products, and intend to keep them separate. FDA's preliminary 
estimate is that only a fraction of feed manufacturers and distributors 
will separate their products. Independent renderers were excluded from 
the burden estimates based on information provided for the economic 
estimate. Packer/renderers were excluded because they are single 
species processors.
    Under these recordkeeping requirements, for which records must be 
made available for FDA inspection, an estimated 2,000 feed mills would 
handle both restricted and nonrestricted products and would develop 
standard operating procedures for keeping ruminant and mink material 
separate from nonruminant material from the time of receipt to time of 
shipment. The estimate in the burden chart is based on the time 
required to develop and establish the written procedures and is a one 
time requirement. The 2,000 firms will also incur annual operating cost 
estimated at $10 million, because of the flushing, sequencing and other 
procedures that will be required. It is estimated that 1,000 of the 
firms may incur capital cost for the construction of separate 
facilities. These costs have been annualized for 10 years, at $7.119 
million per year. The remaining firms are expected to be able to meet 
the regulation's requirements without incurring capital cost.
    The agency has submitted copies of the proposed rule to OMB for its 
review of these requirements. Interested persons are requested to send 
comments regarding this collection of information by February 18, 1997, 
but not later than March 4, 1997 to the Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs, OMB (address above), Attn: Desk Officer for FDA.
    Description of Respondents: Distributors, feed manufacturers, 
blenders and renderers.

List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 589

    Animal feeds, Animal foods, Food additives.

    Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under 
authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, it is 
proposed that 21 CFR part 589 be amended as follows:

PART 589--SUBSTANCES PROHIBITED FROM USE IN ANIMAL FOOD OR FEED

    1. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 589 continues to read as 
follows:

    Authority: Secs. 201, 402, 409, 701 of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321, 342, 348, 371).

    2. New Sec. 589.2000 is added to subpart B to read as follows:


Sec. 589.2000  Animal proteins prohibited in ruminant feed.

    (a) Definitions. (1) Protein derived from ruminant and mink tissues 
means any protein-containing portion of ruminant animals or mink, 
excluding blood from bovines, milk proteins and gelatin.
    (2) Renderer means any firm or individual that processes slaughter 
byproducts, animals unfit for human consumption, meat scraps or food 
waste. The term includes persons who collect such materials and subject 
them to minimal processing, or distribute them to firms other than 
renderers whose intended use for the products may include animal feed. 
The term includes renderers that also blend animal protein products.
    (3) Blender means any firm or individual which obtains processed 
animal protein from more than one source or from more than one species, 
and subsequently mixes (blends) or redistributes an animal protein 
product.
    (4) Feed manufacturer and distributor includes manufacturers and 
distributors of complete and intermediate feeds intended for animals, 
and includes on-farm in addition to off-farm feed manufacturing and 
mixing operations.
    (5) Nonruminant protein includes protein from nonruminant animals 
and from vegetable sources.
    (b) Food additive status. The Food and Drug Administration has 
determined that protein derived from ruminant and mink tissues is not 
generally recognized as safe for use in ruminant feed because it may 
contain transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE)-infective 
material, and is a food additive subject to section 409 of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act). In the absence of a regulation 
providing for its safe use as a food additive under section 409 of the 
act, the use or intended use in ruminant feed of any material that 
contains protein derived from ruminant and mink tissues causes the feed 
to be adulterated and in violation of the act, unless it is the subject 
of an effective notice of claimed investigational exemption for a food 
additive under Sec. 570.17 of this chapter. The Food and Drug 
Administration has determined that ruminant and mink derived protein is 
not prior sanctioned for use in ruminant feeds.
    (c) Requirements for renderers that are not included in paragraph 
(e) of this section. (1) Renderers that manufacture products that 
contain or may contain protein derived from ruminant and mink tissues 
and that are intended for use in animal feed shall take the following 
measures to ensure that materials identified in paragraph (b) of this 
section are not used in the feed of ruminants:
    (i) Label the materials as follows: ``Contains (or may contain) 
protein derived from ruminant and mink tissues. Do not feed to ruminant 
animals, and do not use to manufacture feed intended for ruminant 
animals''; and
    (ii) Maintain copies of sales invoices for the materials, and make 
the copies available for inspection and copying by the Food and Drug 
Administration.
    (2) Renderers described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be 
exempted from the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) 
of this section if they:
    (i) Use exclusively a manufacturing method that has been validated 
by the Food and Drug Administration to deactivate the agent that causes 
TSE's and whose design has been made available to the public; or
    (ii) Use routinely a test method that has been validated by the 
Food and Drug Administration to detect the presence of the agent that 
causes TSE's and whose design has been made available to the public. 
Products found to contain the agent that causes TSE's shall be labeled 
``Not for Use in Animal Feed.'' Records of the test results shall be 
made available for inspection by the Food and Drug Administration.
    (3) Renderers described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section who are 
not exempted under paragraph (c)(2)(i) or paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this 
section will be exempted from the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) 
of this section if they use a permanent method, approved by FDA, to 
mark the presence of the materials. If the marking is by the use of an 
agent that cannot be detected on visual inspection, the renderer must 
use an agent whose presence can be detected by a method that has been 
validated by the Food and Drug Administration and whose design has been 
made available to the public.
    (d) Requirements for protein blenders, and feed manufacturers and 
distributors, that are not included in paragraph (e) of this section. 
(1) Protein blenders, and feed manufacturers and distributors, that 
manufacture, blend, process and distribute products that contain or may 
contain protein derived from ruminant and mink tissues shall:
    (i) Comply with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and
    (ii) Maintain copies of invoices for purchase of animal protein 
products or feeds containing such products, and make copies available 
for inspection and copying by the Food and Drug Administration.
    (2) Protein blenders, and feed manufacturers and distributors, 
shall be exempt from paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) of this 
section if they:
    (i) Purchase animal protein products from renderers that certified 
compliance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section or purchase such 
materials from parties

[[Page 583]]

that certify that the materials were purchased from renderers that 
certified compliance with paragraph (c)(2); or
    (ii) Comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section where appropriate.
    (3) Protein blenders, and feed manufacturers and distributors, 
shall be exempt from paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section if they:
    (i) Purchase animal protein products that are marked or purchase 
such materials from renderers that certified compliance with paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section, or purchase such materials from parties that 
certify that the materials were purchased from renderers that certified 
compliance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section; or
    (ii) Comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section where appropriate.
    (4) Copies of certifications as described in paragraphs (d)(2) and 
(d)(3) of this section, shall be made available for inspection and 
copying by the Food and Drug Administration.
    (e) Requirements for persons that intend to separate ruminant/mink 
and nonruminant/mink materials. (1) Renderers, protein blenders, feed 
manufacturers and distributors, haulers and others that manufacture, 
process, blend and distribute both protein products derived from 
ruminant and mink tissues or feeds containing such products, and 
protein products from other animal tissues or feeds containing such 
products, and that intend to keep those products separate shall:
    (i) Comply with paragraphs (c)(1) or (d)(1) of this section as 
appropriate except that the labeling requirement shall apply only to 
products derived from ruminant and mink tissues or feeds containing 
such products;
    (ii) In the case of a renderer, obtain nonruminant (excluding mink) 
materials only from single-species facilities;
    (iii) Provide for measures to avoid commingling or cross-
contamination:
    (A) Maintain separate equipment or facilities for the manufacture, 
processing, or blending of such materials; or
    (B) Use clean-out procedures or other means adequate to prevent 
carry-over of ruminant and mink derived protein into animal protein 
products or feeds that may be used for ruminants; and
    (iv) Maintain written procedures specifying the clean-out 
procedures or other means, and specifying the procedures for separating 
ruminant and mink materials from nonruminant materials (excluding mink) 
from the time of receipt until the time of shipment.
    (2) Renderers, blenders, and feed manufacturers and distributors 
will be exempted from appropriate requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section, if they meet the appropriate criteria for exemption under 
paragraphs (c)(2) or (c)(3), and (d)(2) or (d)(3) of this section.
    (f) Requirements for establishments and individuals that are 
responsible for feeding ruminant animals. Establishments and 
individuals that are responsible for feeding ruminant animals shall 
maintain copies of purchase invoices and labeling for all feeds 
received, and make the copies available for inspection and copying by 
the Food and Drug Administration.
    (g) Adulteration and misbranding. (1) Animal protein products, and 
feeds containing such products, that are not in compliance with 
paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, excluding labeling 
requirements, will be deemed adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C) or 
402(a)(4) of the act.
    (2) Animal protein products, and feeds containing such products, 
that are not in compliance with the labeling requirements of paragraphs 
(c) through (f) of this section will be deemed misbranded under section 
403(a)(1) of the act.
    (h) Inspection; records retention. (1) Records that are to be made 
available for inspection and copying, as required by this section, 
shall be kept for a minimum of 2 years.
    (2) Written procedures required by this section shall be made 
available for inspection and copying by the Food and Drug 
Administration.
